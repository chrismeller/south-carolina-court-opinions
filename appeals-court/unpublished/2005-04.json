Talley, both of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Paul Keller appeals the trial courtâ€™s decision granting a directed verdict on his causes of action for breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, specific performance, quantum meruit, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel, and fraud.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nKeller entered into an agreement with Robert Harrell whereby Keller agreed to purchase Harrellâ€™s twenty-five and one-half percent interest in RDLPW corporation, the owner of a gym called Boiling Springs Club.Â  To secure the payment of all, or a portion of the purchase price, Keller executed a promissory note to Harrell.Â  RDLPWâ€™s attorney drafted the agreement for the sale of stock and minutes of consent regarding the proposed transaction.Â  Although the minutes of consent required the consent of all the shareholders, only two of the five shareholders (Harrell and David Gillespie) signed the instrument.Â  The remaining shareholders were Leon Galloway, Phil Holden, and Wayne\r\nTruesdale.&nbsp; \r\nIn January 2000, Keller accompanied Gillespie to a RDLPW shareholderâ€™s meeting where Keller was introduced to Galloway, Holden, and Truesdale.Â  At the meeting, the group discussed the proposed transfer of Harrellâ€™s stock to Keller and Kellerâ€™s potential role in the business.Â  The parties discussed Keller implementing a personal training program, working to cut costs in the operation of the gym, and organizing the books of the corporation.Â  Following these discussions, Keller asserts the shareholders voted unanimously in favor of approving the sale and transfer of Harrellâ€™s stock to him,[1] paying him $2,000 per month for his consulting services, and paying him twenty-five percent of all revenue derived from the personal training program he was to develop.Â  \r\nKeller testified he devoted approximately fifteen to thirty hours per week to the operation of Boiling Springs Club.Â  He reduced costs at the facility and implemented a personal training program that he estimated generated approximately $4,000 per month.Â  Keller testified he provided his services in reliance on the shareholdersâ€™ promise he would be compensated.Â  In fact, Keller only received one check from the corporation in the amount of $2,000 for his services.Â  \r\nAt an August 2000 shareholdersâ€™ meeting, Keller testified he requested the three remaining shareholders sign the minutes of consent previously signed by Harrell and Gillespie, which would accomplish the transfer of Harrellâ€™s shares to him.Â  However, the shareholders refused to sign the agreement â€œat that time.â€Â  \r\nSeveral weeks later, Keller learned Galloway had purchased Harrellâ€™s shares and transferred them to his son, Jeff.Â  Holden and Truesdale were at some point â€œvoted outâ€ of RDLPW, so the only remaining shareholders were Galloway and his son, Jeff.Â  Subsequently, Galloway gave Holden and Truesdale stock that entitled them to a greater ownership interest in RDLPW than they previously enjoyed.Â  The corporationâ€™s financial records indicate the Boiling Springs Club was operating at a loss at the end of August 2000.Â  \r\nKeller brought this action against RDLPW and Galloway in November 2000, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, specific performance, quantum meruit, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel, and fraud.Â  RDLPW answered and filed a third-party complaint against Harrell, denying liability and alleging any liability should lie solely with Harrell.Â  Harrell did not answer the cross-complaint and was held in default.Â  The parties tried the matter before a jury.Â  After Keller presented his evidence, both RDLPW and Galloway moved for a directed verdict on all causes of action.Â  The trial court granted the motion.Â  Keller appeals.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.â€Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  The trial court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inferences are in doubt.Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Â Â Â Â Â  Breach of Contract\r\nKeller argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on his claims for breach of contract in regard to the sale of stock.[2]Â  We disagree.\r\nTo recover under a breach of contract theory of liability, a plaintiff bears the burden of showing the existence of a contract, its breach, and damages resulting therefrom.Â  Fuller v. E. Fire &amp; Cas. Ins., Co., 240 S.C. 75, 89, 124 S.E.2d 602, 610 (1962).Â  The necessary elements of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration.Â \r\nCarolina Amusement Co., Inc. v. Connecticut Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co., 313 S.C. 215, 220, 437 S.E.2d 122, 125 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  A valid offer â€œidentifies the bargained for exchange and creates a power of acceptance in the offeree.â€ Id.\r\nKeller admitted the contract that existed for the sale of stock was purely between himself and Harrell.Â  Keller testified he and Harrell negotiated the price, and RDLPW did not agree to anything in the contract.Â  The only involvement RDLPW had with regard to the agreement for the sale of stock was the vote taken at the shareholdersâ€™ meeting.Â  Truesdale, Gillespie, and Holden testified the shareholders voted unanimously to approve the transfer of shares from Harrell to Keller and to accept Keller as a new shareholder.Â  However, only Gillespie and Harrell signed the minutes of consent approving the sale, even though the document itself required the written approval of all the shareholders.[3]Â  Furthermore, Harrell, not RDLPW, owned the stock, and the shareholdersâ€™ vote to approve the transfer of the shares was insufficient to establish a contract between Keller and RDLPW.Â  Likewise, no contract existed between Keller and Galloway.Â  Galloway had no involvement in the contract between Harrell and Keller and was simply a shareholder of the corporation.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court did not err in directing a verdict on Kellerâ€™s claim for breach of contract in regard to the sale of the stock.Â  \r\nKeller next argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on his claim for breach of contract in regard to his services.Â  We agree.\r\nAs noted above, the necessary elements of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration.Â  Id.Â  A valid offer â€œidentifies the bargained for exchange and creates a power of acceptance in the offeree.â€Â  Id.  \r\nThe evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Keller, reflects that Keller offered to work for RDLPW to cut costs in exchange for $2,000 per month and to design and implement a personal training program for twenty-five percent of the profits generated.Â  The shareholders accepted the offer by unanimous vote, thereby forming a contract with Keller.Â  Gillespie, Truesdale, and Holden, testified they all agreed to the deal, and RDLPW made one payment of $2,000 to Keller for his services.Â  Based upon these facts, we find the trial court erred in granting the directed verdict with regard to Kellerâ€™s claim for breach of the contract for his services.\r\n2.Â  Â Â Â Â  Equitable Causes of Action\r\nKeller argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on his equitable causes of action, including promissory estoppel and quantum meruit.Â  We agree as to the monetary claims only.\r\nA cause of action for equitable estoppel is distinctly different from a cause of action for breach of contract.Â  Our courts recognize a remedy in equity if the claimant can prove: (1) the presence of a promise unambiguous in its terms; (2) reasonable reliance upon the promise by the party to whom the promise is made; (3) the reliance is expected and foreseeable by the party who makes the promise; and (4) the party to whom the promise is made must sustain injury in reliance on the promise. Â Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C. 477, 483-84, 570 S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The applicability of the doctrine depends on whether the refusal to apply it would be virtually to sanction the perpetration of a fraud or would result in other injustice.Â  Citizens Bank v. Gregoryâ€™s Warehouse, Inc., 297 S.C. 151, 154, 375 S.E.2d 316, 318 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Unlike a contract that requires a meeting of the minds and consideration, promissory estoppel looks at a promise, its subsequent effect on the promisee, and in certain cases bars the promisor from making an inconsistent disposition of the property involved.Â  Satcher, 351 S.C. at 484, 570 S.E.2d at 538-39.\r\nAbsent an express contract, recovery under quantum meruit is based on quasi-contract, the elements of which are: (1) a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention by the defendant of the benefit under conditions that make it unjust for him to retain it without paying its value.Â  Columbia Wholesale Co., Inc. v. Scudder May N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129, 130 (1994).\r\nAlthough Keller did not present evidence whereby a jury could find the existence of a contract, he did present sufficient evidence under a promissory estoppel or quantum meruit theory to survive a directed verdict motion.Â  Three shareholders, Gillespie, Truesdale, and Holden, testified the shareholders agreed unanimously to pay Keller $2,000 per month and twenty-five percent of the personal training revenues he generated.Â  Keller reasonably relied on these promises and worked fifteen to thirty hours per week for the benefit of RDLPW, which was a foreseeable result of the promise.Â  Keller cut costs, managed the finances, and implemented a personal training program, but RDLPW paid him only $2,000 in return for his services.Â  \r\nWe hold Keller presented sufficient evidence yielding more than one inference on his claims based upon promissory estoppel and quantum meruit.Â  Therefore, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict on Kellerâ€™s equitable causes of action as to his monetary claims only.Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s grant of a directed verdict as it relates to the transfer of stock.\r\n3.Â  Â Â Â Â  Breach of Contract Accompanied by a Fraudulent ActÂ Â Â Â Â  \r\nKeller argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on his cause of action for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act in regard to the sale of stock.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to have a claim for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, the plaintiff must establish three elements: (1) a breach of contract; (2) fraudulent intent relating to the breaching of the contract, not merely to its making; and (3) a fraudulent act accompanying the breach. Harper v. Ethridge, 290 S.C. 112, 119, 348 S.E.2d 374, 378 (Ct. App. 1986). The fraudulent act is any act characterized by dishonesty in fact or unfair dealing.Â  Id.Â  â€œFraud,â€ in this sense, â€œassumes so many hues and forms, that courts are compelled to content themselves with comparatively few general rules for its discovery and defeat, and allow the facts and circumstances peculiar to each case to bear heavily upon the conscience and judgment of the court or jury in determining its presence or absence.â€Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 466, 560 S.E.2d 606, 612 (2002) (citation omitted).Â  Breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act is a cause of action â€œex contractu,â€ or based upon a contract or promise; therefore, a contract must provide a basis for the claim.Â  Lister v. NationsBank of Delaware, N.A., 329 S.C. 133, 144, 494 S.E.2d 449, 455 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nKeller presented no evidence that could persuade a jury to conclude he had a contract for the sale of stock with RDLPW or Galloway.Â  Because the existence of a contract is a prerequisite to a cause of action for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, the trial court committed no error.\r\n4.Â  Â Â Â Â  Fraud[4]\r\nKeller argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on his cause of action for fraud in regard to the sale of stock.Â  We disagree. \r\nTo prove fraud, a plaintiff must show:Â  (1) a representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) the speakerâ€™s knowledge of its falsity; (5) his intent that it should be acted upon by the person; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) his reliance on its truth; (8) his right to rely thereon; (9) and his consequent and proximate injury.Â  Mutual Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. McKenzie, 274 S.C. 630, 633, 266 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1980).\r\nKeller did not present sufficient evidence of the elements of fraud at trial.Â  Keller essentially contends that because the corporation voted to transfer Harrellâ€™s stock to him, and the stock ended up in the hands of Galloway, fraud was necessarily committed.Â  Moreover, he argues that in reliance on the shareholders representation, he worked at the gym for seven months because he considered himself a shareholder of RDLPW.Â  Inasmuch as there were certain statutory requirements to effectuate the transfer of the stock, and Keller has neither shown that those requirements were satisfied nor how Galloway personally prevented the transfer of the shares, the fact that Galloway purchased the shares himself does not prove fraud. Accordingly, Keller offered insufficient proof of fraud, and the grant of the directed verdict in Gallowayâ€™s favor was proper.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n5.Â  Â Â Â Â  Exclusion of Evidence\r\nFinally, Keller contends the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of a witness regarding conversation(s) between shareholders or agents of RDLPW, which â€œinvolved the avoidance of payment obligations to Mr. Kellerâ€ because the witness could not recall the exact date the conversations occurred.Â  Because Keller made no proffer of the excluded evidence, we are precluded from considering this argument on appeal.Â  Alleged prejudicial error from the exclusion of evidence at trial is not demonstrated absent a proffer of that evidence at trial.Â  Greenville Memorial Auditorium v. Martin, 301 S.C. 242, 243, 391 S.E.2d 546, 547 (1990).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nKeller presented no evidence that he had a contract for the sale of stock with Galloway or RDLPW.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not commit error in granting a directed verdict on that issue.Â  However, Keller did present sufficient evidence that he had a contract for services he rendered to the corporation.Â  Thus, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s order as it relates to breach of contract for services rendered to RDLPW.Â  Further, Keller presented sufficient evidence to survive a directed verdict motion on his equitable claims of promissory estoppel and quantum meruit as against the corporation for the monetary damages he seeks but not as to the transfer of stock.Â  Moreover, Keller sought damages against Galloway only on his fraud claim but did not sufficiently support his claim of fraud.Â  Finally, we do not decide whether the trial court improperly excluded testimony of a witness because there was no proffer of the statement.Â  Therefore, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  As best we can tell, RDLPW is a close corporation formed pursuant to section 33-18-101 to 500 of the South Carolina Code (1990).Â  Section 33-18-110 requires a shareholder who wishes to sell his stock to a non-shareholder to obtain the written consent of all shareholders or, pursuant to section 33-18-120, to first offer it to the corporation in writing. They may then approve the transfer by a â€œvote of the holders of a majority of votes entitled to be cast . . ., excluding votes in respect of the shares covered by the offer.â€\r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  In his brief, Keller asserts we should reverse the trial courtâ€™s granting of a directed verdict on his cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  However, he makes no arguments and cites no authority for his position.Â  Therefore, the issue is abandoned on appeal.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994); Stier, Kent &amp; Canady, Inc. v. Jackson, 317 S.C. 179, 183, 452 S.E.2d 606, 609 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  It appears Keller elected to proceed under section 33-18-120(b)(3), which would have permitted the transfer of Harrellâ€™s shares to him upon the written approval of all of the outstanding shares of the corporation.\r\n[4] Kellerâ€™s attorney conceded at oral argument that he was not claiming fraud against the corporation, but rather against Galloway only. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-237","title":"Williams v.

Williams, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nCurtis L. Ott, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tim Williams brought this action against New Century Investigations, Inc., Premier Investigations, Inc., Robert A. Cook, and Donna Lindsey (collectively Respondents), alleging causes of action for fraud and breach of contract with fraudulent intent.Â  The trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nWilliams, a South Carolina resident, worked as a customer services representative for Premier Investigations, a company incorporated in Florida with corporate offices in North Carolina, from December 1996 through January 1997.Â  After Premier terminated his employment in January, Williams requested his unpaid wages.Â  When he was not paid, Williams brought suit in Richland County, South Carolina, against Premier, CEO Robert Cook, and President Donna Lindsey.Â  Cook and Lindsey were both North Carolina residents and were dismissed from the lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  Premier, as the only remaining defendant, filed an Offer of Judgment in the amount of $21,000.Â  Williams accepted the judgment in August 1997, and the judgment was entered by the court in February 1998.Â  Despite the offer and acceptance of judgment, Premier never paid Williams.Â  Williams domesticated the judgment in North Carolina and attempted to enforce it, but he was unsuccessful.Â  \r\nWilliams filed his complaint in the current action in August 2002.Â  In his complaint, he alleged Cook and Lindsey established New Century Investigations in February 1997 using assets from Premier and for the purpose of continuing Premierâ€™s business.Â  Further, he alleged Respondents created New Century for the purpose of defrauding creditors.Â  Williams contended Cook and Lindsey conspired on behalf of Premier by making the Offer of Judgment with the intention of never paying the judgment.Â  \r\nIn his complaint, Williams maintained a cause of action for fraud against Respondents.Â  His complaint centers on the transfer of Premierâ€™s assets to New Century prior to Premier making the Offer of Judgment.Â  Additionally, he asserts a cause of action against all parties but New Century, alleging:Â  (1) his employment contract was breached by the failure to pay his wages; and (2) Cook made a verbal agreement to pay the judgment against Premier and this was breached when he moved Premierâ€™s assets to New Century and did not pay Williams. \r\nPrior to filing an Answer, Respondents filed a motion to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  Respondents maintained:Â  (1) the claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata as they originated from the same facts as Williamsâ€™ 1997 action; (2) the claims were an improper collateral attack on the judgment against Premier; (3) Williams should have brought this action under a Rule 60, SCRCP motion and not in a separate cause of action; (4) the complaint was barred by the statute of limitations; (5) the court lacked personal jurisdiction over Cook, Lindsey, and Premier; and (6) the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to set forth a cause of action for fraud or breach of contract with fraudulent intent as to any party.Â  During the hearing on the motion, Williams informed the trial court that he was not attempting to appeal or have the prior judgment against Premier reconsidered, he was merely attempting to collect on the former judgment.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the doctrine of res judicata applied to bar the current action.Â  The court also concluded the lawsuit as brought was not the appropriate vehicle by which to attack the judgment or to collect the judgment.Â  The court found even if Williams had properly filed under Rule 60, SCRCP, the filing would have been untimely.Â  Finally, the court concluded the causes of action against New Century failed as a matter of law.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  In considering such a motion, the trial court must base its ruling solely on allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  If the facts and inferences drawn from the facts alleged in the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is improper.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 527, 511 S.E.2d 69, 73 (1999).Â  In deciding whether the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, the appellate court must consider whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief.Â  Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 5, 522 S.E.2d 137, 139 (1999).Â  A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) should not be granted if facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom entitle the plaintiff to relief under any theory.Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Discovery\r\nWilliams contends the trial court erred in dismissing his complaint before he had the opportunity to commence discovery.Â  We disagree.\r\nWilliams appears to be arguing it was premature to dismiss his case without allowing adequate discovery.Â  However, Respondents did not move for summary judgment, but they instead moved to dismiss under Rule 12, SCRCP.Â  Pursuant to Rule 12, determinations of whether to dismiss the complaint are made based upon the pleadings of the party.Â  Baird, 333 S.C. at 527, 511 S.E.2d at 73.Â  While discovery may be allowed, or even required, before consideration of a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, SCRCP, the same is not true for a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).Â  Because a dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, is based solely on the allegations within the four corners of the complaint, further discovery is not necessary.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to allow discovery prior to deciding the motion to dismiss based upon the pleadings.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Res Judicata\r\nWilliams maintains the current case is not barred by the doctrine of res judicata because it does not re-litigate the issues previously determined in the 1997 action.Â  While some of the claims raised by Williams are new claims, other claims are the same and are, therefore, barred from re-litigation.\r\nâ€œUnder the doctrine of res judicata, â€˜[a] litigant is barred from raising any issues which were adjudicated in the former suit and any issues which might have been raised in the former suit.â€™â€Â  Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999) (quoting Hilton Head Ctr. of South Carolina, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n of South Carolina, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987)).Â  â€œTo establish res judicata, the defendant must prove the following three elements: (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe 1997 action was a suit for damages arising out of Premierâ€™s failure to pay Williams his wages for time worked between December 1996 and January 1997.Â  The present action includes a claim for the wages under paragraphs 29-30 of the complaint.Â  This claim is clearly barred under the doctrine of res judicata, as it is the same issue previously litigated between the same parties.\r\nWilliams also brings a claim for fraud as a result of the conveyance of Premierâ€™s property to New Century in an effort to avoid payment of the judgment rendered.Â  Fraudulent conveyances of property in an effort to defraud creditors may be set aside as void.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-23-10(A) (Supp. 2004) (codifying the Statute of Elizabeth and noting that conveyances of any lands, goods, or chattel for the purposes of defrauding creditors are void); see also Windsor Prop., Inc. v. Dolphin Head Constr. Co., 331 S.C. 466, 470-71, 498 S.E.2d 858, 860 (1998) (noting that fraudulent conveyances to defraud creditors are void).Â  \r\nWilliamsâ€™ fraudulent conveyance claim was not an issue against any of the parties in the prior litigation.Â  Further, although Premier, Cook, and Lindsey were all named parties in the prior litigation, New Century was not a named party.Â  Thus, Williamsâ€™ claim for fraudulent conveyance is not barred by the doctrine of res judicata, and the trial court erred in making this finding. Because Williams presented a valid claim, we reverse the trial court as to this issue and remand the matter for further proceedings.[2]\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Proper Action\r\nWilliams contends the trial court erred in finding his claim was brought as an improper action.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe trial court found that if Williams was seeking to set aside the prior judgment, the proper means by which to challenge it would have been pursuant to Rule 60, SCRCP.Â  Although the rule generally allows a party to file for relief from judgment within a â€œreasonable time,â€ the rule specifies that a party may move for relief from judgment due to fraud only within one year after the judgment.Â  Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP.Â  Williamsâ€™ claims for fraud and breach of contract with fraudulent intent may be interpreted as collateral attacks on a valid judgment.Â  As the prior judgment was entered in February 1998 and the underlying cause of action was not filed until August 2002, Williams did not file within one year of the judgment.Â  Further, if Williamsâ€™ complaint is interpreted generally as an independent action for relief from judgment, he still failed to file within a reasonable time period.Â  See Rule 60, SCRCP (allowing independent actions to challenge a prior judgment if filed within a â€œreasonable timeâ€).Â  Thus, if Williams was seeking to be relieved from the prior judgment, we agree with the trial court that his motion was untimely.[3]Â  \r\nHowever, based upon Williamsâ€™ arguments at the hearing on the motion to dismiss and in his appellate brief, we believe that Williams was seeking to enforce the prior judgment, not be relieved from it.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a party may execute a judgment by filing a writ of execution.Â  Rule 69, SCRCP.Â  The procedures for enforcing a writ of execution are governed by statute.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-180 (2005) (providing that a judgment may be enforced by execution); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-10 through â€“90 (2005) (providing the kinds of execution and a ten-year time period for execution).Â Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough Williams asserted he was seeking to collect on the prior judgment, the causes of action as raised in Williamsâ€™ complaint cannot be construed as an action to execute or collect the judgment against Premier.Â  Williams also failed to file a motion for a writ of execution pursuant to Rule 69, SCRCP, and he failed to follow the procedures for enforcement pursuant to the statutes.Â  Because Williams failed to follow the procedures for execution, the trial court correctly concluded the vehicle used by Williams to collect his judgment was improper.[4]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court did not commit any error in failing to order discovery prior to a motion to dismiss based upon the pleadings.Â  We find the doctrine of res judicata applies to bar claims against the parties arising out of the original employment contract and the failure of Premier to pay Williamsâ€™ wages.Â  However, res judicata cannot be used to bar Williamsâ€™ claim of fraudulent conveyance, and this cause of action should be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.Â  We find no error with the trial courtâ€™s determination that Williams brought an improper action if he was seeking to enforce his judgment.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2]Â  The trial court found that Williams discovered the alleged fraudulent conveyance from Premier to New Century two years and eight months prior to filing the underlying action.Â  This finding was not appealed by any of the parties.Â  Thus, any question regarding the statute of limitations for Williamsâ€™ fraudulent conveyance claim in the current action has been decided and is the law of the case.Â  \r\n[3]Â  We note that in order to obtain relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) due to fraud, the fraud must be extrinsic, not intrinsic.Â  Raby Constr. L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 20-21, 594 S.E.2d 478, 483 (2004).Â  The trial court in this matter did not determine whether the allegations of fraud amounted to intrinsic or extrinsic fraud, and Williams does not complain about the failure to make this ruling on appeal. \r\n[4] Williams maintains he correctly brought his collection action within a reasonable time.Â  Because we find he did not actually bring an action to execute judgment, we need not determine this issue.Â  However, were he to bring an action to execute or collect the judgment in the proper jurisdiction, it would be subject to the specific statute of limitations relating to that action.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-238","title":"Branch & Island Waterfront Flats v.

(â€œWater Companyâ€) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s denial of its Rule 59, SCRCP motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a new trial after the jury returned a verdict in favor of Island Waterfront Flats, Inc. (â€œWaterfront Flatsâ€).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nWaterfront Flats was incorporated by Kenneth Branch in 1993 or 1994.Â  Branch testified that Waterfront Flats owned a 0.52 acre tract of land in Goat Island Resort in Clarendon County, South Carolina.Â  Waterfront Flats purchased the property from Branch who acted as an officer and was the sole shareholder of the corporation. \r\nPrior to the incorporation of Waterfront Flats, Branch owned and operated a small, private water system for the area from 1980 through 1986.Â  In 1986, a court order established the Water Company to own, operate, and maintain the water facility.Â  In 1993 or 1994, Branch and Waterfront Flats made a demand for water taps on the 0.52 acre tract of land owned by the corporation.Â  The Water Company refused this demand.Â  As a result, Branch and Waterfront Flats, acting individually and as representatives of a class of plaintiffs, initiated this lawsuit on June 15, 1995.Â  The Complaint alleged that the Water Company failed to provide records, along with numerous other allegations of wrongful conduct primarily related to the providing of water and sewer services to lots developed by Waterfront Flats.\r\nAfter a lengthy procedural process, the case was tried before a jury. The jury returned a verdict of $100,000 in favor of Waterfront Flats.[1]Â  The Water Company made a motion for JNOV and, in the alternative a new trial, both of which were denied by the circuit court.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn ruling on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and to deny the motion where either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002); Bailey v. Segars, 346 S.C. 359, 365, 550 S.E.2d 910, 913 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  This court will not disturb a trial courtâ€™s ruling unless that decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence or the courtâ€™s conclusions of law have been controlled by an error of law.Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999); South Carolina Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 521, 548 S.E.2d 880, 885 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Water Company argues the circuit court erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a new trial.Â  As one of its arguments in support of this contention, the Water Company asserts the applicable statute of limitations bars Waterfront Flatsâ€™ lawsuit. \r\nWe preface our discussion of this issue by noting that Waterfront Flats has repeatedly failed to adhere to the established appellate court procedure.Â  Specifically, Waterfront Flats failed to file a brief, failed to reply to this courtâ€™s request for supplementation to the record on appeal, and failed to appear at oral argument.Â  Based on these facts alone, this court would be justified in reversing the judgment in favor of Waterfront Flats.Â  See Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR (â€œUpon the failure of respondent to timely file a brief, the appellate court may take such action as it deems proper.â€); Wierszewski v. Tokarick, 308 S.C. 441, 444 n.2, 418 S.E.2d 557, 559 n.2 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding that where respondent failed to file a brief appellate court deemed it proper â€œto reverse on the points presented rather than to search the record for reasons to affirmâ€); see also Smith v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 284 S.C. 469, 471, 327 S.E.2d 348, 349 (1985)(holding, under prior appellate court rules, the supreme court would not â€œgrope in the darkâ€ in order to identify errors).\r\nDespite the failure of Waterfront Flats to file a brief, we deem it proper to address the merits of this appeal.Â  As will be discussed, we agree with the Water Company that the statute of limitations barred Waterfront Flatsâ€™ lawsuit.\r\nSection 15-3-530 of the South Carolina Code of Laws provides the applicable statute of limitations in this action is three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (2005).Â  South Carolina follows the discovery rule outlined in section 15-3-535, which provides the statute of limitations begins to run from the date the injured party knew or should have known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action exists.Â  Martin v. Companion Healthcare Corp., 357 S.C. 570, 575-76, 593 S.E.2d 624, 627 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (2005).Â  \r\nThe exercise of reasonable diligence means an injured party must act promptly when the facts and circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist.Â  The statute of limitations begins to run from this point, not when advice of counsel is sought or a full-blown theory of recovery developed.Â  Snell v. Columbia Gun Exch., Inc., 276 S.C. 301, 303, 278 S.E.2d 333, 334 (1981); Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 418, 483 S.E.2d 477, 482 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The date on which discovery should have been made is an objective rather than subjective question.Â  Kreutner v. David, 320 S.C. 283, 285, 465 S.E.2d 88, 90 (1995).Â  â€œTherefore, the statutory period of limitations begins to run when a person could or should have known, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a cause of action might exist in his or her favor, rather than when a person obtains actual knowledge of either the potential claim or of the facts giving rise thereto.â€Â  Dorman v. Campbell, 331 S.C. 179, 184-85, 500 S.E.2d 786, 789 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nâ€œ[E]very corporation has perpetual duration and succession in its corporate name and has the same powers as an individual to do all things necessary or convenient to carry out its affairs including, without limitation, power to sue and be sued, complain, and defend in its corporate name.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-302(1) (Supp. 2004).Â  â€œA corporation is not a natural person and maintains a separate and distinct identity apart from its shareholders.â€Â  Mangum v. Maryland Cas. Co., 330 S.C. 573, 576, 500 S.E.2d 125, 127 (Ct. App. 1998) â€œâ€˜This oft-stated principle is equally applicable, whether the corporation has many or only one stockholder.â€™â€ Id. (quoting Costas v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n, 283 S.C. 94, 102, 321 S.E.2d 51, 56 (1984)). \r\nGenerally, a corporate officerâ€™s knowledge, which is acquired in his official capacity, is imputed to the corporation. See Equitable Trust Co. of Columbia v. Columbia Natâ€™l Bank, 145 S.C. 91, 115, 142 S.E. 811, 817 (1928) (â€œSubject to certain qualifications and exceptions . . . , it is well settled that, if an officer or agent of a corporation acquires or possesses knowledge of facts, in the course of his employment, and as to matters which are within the scope of his authority, his knowledge is imputable to the corporation.â€)(citation omitted); Citizensâ€™ Bank v. Heyward, 135 S.C. 190, 190, 133 S.E. 709, 709 (1925) (recognizing general rule that notice to an agent is notice to principal, particularly in cases of corporations); 18B Am. Jur. 2d Corporations Â§ 1442 (2004) (â€œA corporationâ€™s knowledge is entirely imputed to it from the knowledge possessed by its officers and agents.Â  In accordance with general agency principles, a corporation generally is charged with knowledge of facts that its agents learn within the scope of their employment.â€); see also Multimedia Publâ€™g of South Carolina, Inc. v. Mullins, 314 S.C. 551, 555, 431 S.E.2d 569, 572 (1993) (â€œA corporate director is chargeable with all matters pertaining to the corporationâ€™s affairs, of which he has or should have knowledge in the exercise of the duties required of him as a director.â€); Tele-Port, Inc. v. Ameritech Mobile Communications, 637 N.W.2d 782, 854 (Wisc. Ct. App. 2001) (â€œKnowledge acquired by an employee of a corporation during his or her employment and concerning something pertinent to the subject matter of that employment, so that the employee therefore becomes an â€˜agentâ€™ of the employer for the purposes of that information, is notice to the corporation for statute-of-limitations purposes, irrespective of whether the employee communicates that knowledge to anyone else in the corporation.â€).\r\nThis case, however, presents the question of whether knowledge acquired by a corporate officer or shareholder prior to incorporation may be imputed to the corporation for the purposes of the statute of limitations.Â  As will be more thoroughly discussed, we believe Branchâ€™s prior knowledge regarding the problems with the insufficient water and sewer capacity was imputed to the corporation and, thus, the lawsuit against the Water Company was barred by the three-year statute of limitations.Â  \r\nIn May 1980, Branch, Sue S. Branch, and Harvey Bowen (collectively â€œBranchâ€) purchased the tract of land that is the subject of this dispute at a time when the water and sewer had not been approved by DHEC.Â  A DHEC employee, who assessed the water and sewer situation, testified that DHEC began issuing orders as early as 1983 indicating there were capacity problems.Â  By 1986, Branch was on notice, based on a court order, that the water system for the property was at capacity.Â  This order, dated August 26, 1986, arose out of a foreclosure action involving the property purchased by Branch.Â  Specifically, the Estate of W.B. Davis, Jr., the mortgagee, brought suit against the mortgagors, which included Branch, pursuant to the notes, mortgage, and security agreement.Â  The order outlines the terms of a settlement agreement which, among other provisions, established the respective property rights of the Davis Estate and Branch.Â  The court also found that the Davis Estate was entitled to a minimum of twenty-four water and sewer hookups or taps.Â  In an effort to accommodate this provision, the court ordered Branch to remove from the existing system the required number of water and sewer taps.Â  The court also noted that Branch â€œacknowledged that they have used up the capacity of the existing system by the addition of various mobile home and trailer hookups and taps placed on the property by the defendants Branch, Branch and Bowen, or by and with their consent.â€ \r\nDuring his testimony, Branch also admitted that in 1989 the Water Company refused his request to â€œtap on.â€Â  He further characterized the process to procure taps as a â€œtough up-hill battle.â€Â  Even though it appeared that the water and sewer system was at capacity, Branch auctioned a number of the lots in 1990.Â  Branch stated that some of these lots were without water and sewer.Â  Branchâ€™s partner in this endeavor, George Pennington, testified that he began requesting water for the lots in 1990, but never received the taps.Â  In the midst of these problems, Branch deeded the property to Waterfront Flats, a corporation in which Branch was an officer and the sole shareholder.Â  However, not until 1995, after the corporation was formed, did Branch and Waterfront Flats institute this action against the Water Company.Â  \r\nUnder the specific facts of this case, we find that Branch knew or should have known that there might be a claim against the Water Company as early as 1986 when the property dispute with the Davis Estate resulted in the order stating that the water and sewer system was at capacity.Â  Because Branch was an officer and the sole shareholder of Waterfront Flats, his prior knowledge of the capacity problems was imputed to the corporation for the purposes of the statute of limitations.Â  See Equitable Trust Co. of Columbia, 145 S.C. at 114, 142 S.E. at 818 (â€œ[I]f knowledge is acquired by an agent while not acting for the corporation, but afterwards he acts for the corporation in a matter in which it becomes his duty to communicate the fact his knowledge is imputed to the corporation.â€) (citation omitted); see also Hice v. Hi-Mil, Inc., 273 S.E.2d 268, 272 (N.C. 1981) (holding that â€œwhen the interests of the individual officer or director are so clearly aligned with those of the corporation, the corporation is properly charged with the knowledge of the individualâ€); Whitten v. Bob Kingâ€™s AMC/Jeep, Inc., 231 S.E.2d 891, 895 (N.C. 1977) (â€œAs a rule, the knowledge of the promoters cannot be imputed to the corporation, although an exception to the rule may exist in a case where the promoters become directors and stockholders in the corporation or are the controlling stockholders.â€); Thompson v. Air Power, Inc., 448 S.E.2d 598, 603 (Va. 1994) (â€œNexus sufficient to provide an equitable reason for disregarding the separate corporate existences is generally established by showing control, interaction, or other similar involvement between the corporations or their agents.â€); cf. Robinson v. GEO Licensing Co., 173 F. Supp.2d 419, 424 (D. Md. 2001) (recognizing that knowledge acquired by engineers who had become employees of corporation could be imputed to corporation even though these engineers acquired the knowledge prior to the commencement of the principal/agent relationship); Whitten, 231 S.E.2d at 895 (holding that where the sole shareholder, president, and general manager of the corporation had complete knowledge of the provisions of a contract entered into prior to incorporation, such knowledge became the knowledge of the corporation).\r\nBecause Branch was aware of the water and sewer capacity problems as early as 1986, it was incumbent upon him to assert a claim against the Water Company prior to 1995.Â  His failure to timely do so precludes him, and in conjunction Waterfront Flats, from bringing this lawsuit.Â  To hold otherwise we would have to ignore Branchâ€™s prior knowledge and, as a result, permit Branch to circumvent the statute of limitations merely by transferring his interests through the incorporation of Waterfront Flats.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.[2]\r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Branch abandoned his individual claims prior to the submission of the case to the jury.Â  Therefore, Waterfront Flats is the only respondent on appeal.Â  \r\n[2]Â Â  In light of our disposition of the statute of limitations issue, we decline to address the Water Companyâ€™s remaining issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-239","title":"State v.

Hearn, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJames Lee Bell, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers-Communication Workers of America, AFL-CIO appeals the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of its causes of action against Local 273 Land Company.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn the 1960s, the members of Local #273 formed the Furniture Workerâ€™s Realty Company (Realty Company), an eleemosynary corporation.Â  After its formation, Realty Company purchased two lots of land located in Sumter, South Carolina.Â  The members of Local #273 subsequently formed Local 273 Land Company (Land Company), also an eleemosynary corporation, and in 1982, Realty Company deeded the lots to Land Company.Â  \r\nIn 1986, Local #273 and Land Company voted to execute a note and mortgage on the lots in favor of the United Furniture Workers of America (UFWA).Â  Later in 1986, UFWA merged with the International Union of Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America (IUE).Â  In 1996, the plant that Local #273 was affiliated with closed.Â  Due to the plant closing, Local #273 dissolved.Â  In 2000, IUE merged with the Communication Workers of America (CWA) to form\r\nIUE-CWA.&nbsp; \r\nThe 1999 IUE constitution required local unions that disband to transfer all assets and property to IUE.Â  Based on this provision in the IUE constitution, IUE-CWA filed suit in 2003 against Land Company seeking declaratory judgment for the recovery of real property, a declaration of a constructive trust, and an accounting.Â  Land Company responded by filing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(6).Â  The trial court granted Land Companyâ€™s motion.Â  IUE-CWA then filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  The trial court denied this motion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nRule 12(b)(1), SCRCP, allows a court to dismiss an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Issues relating to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, including on appeal.Â  Bunkum v. Manor Prop., 321 S.C. 95, 99-100, 467 S.E.2d 758, 761 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œLack of subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived and should be taken notice of by this Court.â€Â \r\nAmisub of South Carolina, Inc. v. Passmore, 316 S.C. 112, 114, 447 S.E.2d 207, 208 (1994).\r\nThe decision whether to grant a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), SCRCP, for lack of personal jurisdiction, must be resolved upon the facts of each particular case.Â \r\nEngineered Prod. v. Cleveland Crane &amp; Engâ€™g,\r\n262 S.C. 1, 4, 201 S.E.2d 921, 922 (1974).Â  A finding of personal jurisdiction by the trial court is binding unless unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â \r\nNucor Corp. v. Faneuil Constr. Inc., 264 S.C. 458, 462, 215 S.E.2d 634, 635 (1975).\r\nIn deciding whether to grant a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the trial court must view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.Â \r\nBergstrom v. Palmetto Health Alliance,\r\n  358 S.C. 388, 395, 596 S.E.2d 42, 45 (2004). Â Based on the complaint, if the facts alleged and the inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case, the motion should be denied.Â \r\nCarolina Care Plan, Inc. v. United HealthCare Serv., Inc., 361 S.C. 544, 550, 606 S.E.2d 752, 755 (2004).Â  â€œIn deciding whether the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, the appellate court must consider whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief.â€Â \r\nBergstrom, 358 S.C. at 395, 596 S.E.2d at 45.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIUE-CWA argues the trial court erred in granting Land Companyâ€™s motion to dismiss due to its failure to bring the cause of action within the applicable statute of limitations.Â  IUE-CWA asserts its claims for declaratory judgment, declaration of a constructive trust, and for an accounting are all equitable in nature, and therefore, statutes of limitations do not apply. \r\nI.Â  Application of Statutes of Limitations to Action to Recover Real Property\r\nIn considering whether the trial court properly dismissed IUE-CWAâ€™s action for declaratory judgment, we need not consider whether IUE-CWA brought this claim within the applicable statutory period.Â  Rule 220(c), provides:Â  â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€Â  Therefore, we may affirm the decision of the trial court based on IUE-CWAâ€™s failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  IUE-CWAâ€™s complaint states IUE-CWA brings its action for declaratory judgment â€œpursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-10 et seq. (1976) (Recovery of Real Property)â€.Â  Section 15-67-10 of the South Carolina Code (2005) provides:Â  \r\n\r\nPersons who may bring action to determine adverse claim.\r\nAny person in possession of real property, by himself or his tenant, or any person having or claiming title to vacant or unoccupied real property may bring an action against any person who claims or who may or could claim an estate or interest therein or a lien thereon adverse to him for the purpose of determining such adverse claim and the rights of the parties, respectively.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\nIn viewing the complaint in the light most favorable to IUE-CWA, we find IUE-CWA does not allege facts from which it would be entitled to relief pursuant to section 15-67-10.Â  IUE-CWA did not allege it had possession of the property in question, nor did it allege it had or claimed title to â€œvacant or unoccupied property.â€Â  Therefore, the trial court correctly concluded:Â  â€œI find that the Plaintiff was not and has not been in possession of the subject property or a part thereof as reflected by the allegations in the Complaint and the exhibits attached thereto by the Plaintiff.â€Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of IUE-CWAâ€™s cause of action for declaratory judgment relating to the recovery of real property pursuant to section 15-67-10 et. seq..Â  \r\nIn addition, IUE-CWA asserts because the Land Company and Local 273 were â€œvirtually indistinguishableâ€, a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether Local #273 was in possession of the parcels until it was disbanded in 1996.Â  Thus, IUE-CWA argues the pleadings present a fact question of whether or not the statute of limitations on its action for the recovery of real property began to run on September 30, 1996.Â  If so, IUE-CWA maintains it brought its claim within the ten-year statutory period provided in section 15-3-340 of the South Carolina Code (1976).Â  We agree IUE-CWA alleges the Land Company was â€œcompletely owned[1] by Local Union #273.â€Â  Importantly, IUE-CWA does not allege the Land Company was its alter ego and in possession of the property during the ten year limitations period.Â  Thus, these allegations do not serve to overcome IUE-CWAâ€™s failure to allege the possession requirements of section 15-3-340.\r\nIUE-CWA also argues if the statue of limitation provided in section 15-3-520(a) of the South Carolina Code (1976) applies to its causes of action, the trial court erred in applying the statute to the facts of this case.Â  Specifically, IUE-CWA asserts the statute of limitations based on the note and alleged mortgage[2] executed in its favor began to run on March 24, 1986, and clearly this action was commenced well within the twenty-year statutory period provided in section 15-3-520(a). Again, these arguments relate to IUE-CWAâ€™s cause of action for recovery of real property.Â  We have already determined the trial court correctly dismissed this cause of action due to IUE-CWAâ€™s failure to state facts sufficient to constitute this cause of action.Â  Therefore, regardless of the trial courtâ€™s application of these statutes of limitation, we find the trial court properly dismissed this cause of action for failure to state a claim. Moreover, as indicated in the heading to Article 5, section 15-3-520(a) does not apply to actions for the recovery of real property. We do not read IUE-CWAâ€™s complaint as alleging an action on a bond and mortgage as contemplated by section 15-3-520(a).\r\nII.Â  Application of Statutes of Limitation to Equitable Causes of Action\r\nIn regard to IUE-CWAâ€™s causes of action for the imposition of a constructive trust and for an accounting, IUE-CWA is correct in stating statutes of limitation are not applicable to equitable causes of action.Â  See Dixon v. Dixon, Op. No.\r\n25925 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 18, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 3 at 27) (â€œThis Court has held that the statute of limitations does not apply to actions in equity.â€).Â  â€œAn action to declare a constructive trust is one in equity . . . .â€Â \r\nMacaulay v. Wachovia Bank of South Carolina, N.A., 351 S.C. 287, 294, 569 S.E.2d 371, 375 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In addition, â€œ[a]n action for an accounting is . . . equitable in nature.â€ Byrd v. King,\r\n245 S.C. 247, 255, 140 S.E.2d 158, 161 (1965).Â  \r\nThe trial court stated:Â  \r\n\r\nI find that the Plaintiff is beyond the Statute of Limitations pursuant to the Â§ 15-3-340; Â§ 15-3-350; Â§ 15-3-520(1); and 15-3-530(1) of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, 1976, as amended, since more than a twenty (20) year period has passed concerning the real property and more than six (6) years have passed pursuant to contractual obligation; and that this Court lacks jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(2) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure; \r\n. . . .\r\n\r\nSections 15-3-340 and 15-3-350 of the South Carolina Code (2005) pertain to the statutes of limitation governing actions for the recovery of real property.Â  Section 15-3-520 of the South Carolina Code (2005) provides the statute of limitations for actions on a note secured by a mortgage.Â  Section 15-3-530 of the South Carolina Code (2005) supplies the statute of limitation for actions upon a contract.Â  Because an action to declare a constructive trust and an action for an accounting are equitable causes of action, these statutes of limitation do not apply.Â  Therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing IUE-CWAâ€™s causes of action to declare a constructive trust and action for an accounting. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court properly dismissed IUE-CWAâ€™s action for declaratory judgment pursuant to the statute governing the recovery of real property.Â  However, we find the trial court improperly dismissed IUE-CWAâ€™s complaint concerning itsâ€™ request for a declaration of a constructive trust and for an accounting.Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The trial court concluded that this allegation is conclusory, rather than factual, and may be disregarded citing Firemanâ€™s Ins. Co. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 302 S.C. 234, 236, 394 S.E.2d 855, 856 (Ct.

Hayes, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-241\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2005 â€“ Filed April 6, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nKimberly Allen Raber, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam D. Robertson, III, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Gateway Supply Company, Inc., asks this court to re-examine its quantum meruit claim against Richland County School District One.Â  The trial court entered judgment in favor of the District, declining to award Gateway Supply the value of plumbing materials furnished to a subcontractor in the construction of Forest Heights Elementary School.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe District hired Cleckley &amp; McGee, Inc. as general contractor for the construction of Forest Heights Elementary School.Â  Cleckley &amp; McGee subcontracted the plumbing work on the building to Mark Monroe.Â  Monroe installed plumbing fixtures, which were sold to him on credit by Gateway Supply, based on a credit application and guaranty agreement signed by Monroe and his wife, Magdline.Â  However, Monroe discontinued his plumbing business and did not pay Gateway Supply the $83,500 he owed for the fixtures. \r\nGateway Supply notified the District of Monroeâ€™s unpaid bill and of its claim against the payment and performance bond.Â  The District did not respond to Gateway Supplyâ€™s notice.Â  However, when the school was completed, the District paid Cleckley &amp; McGee in full.Â  At the time Gateway Supply notified the District of its claim, Cleckley &amp; McGee owed Monroe $44,369 on the subcontract.Â  The District paid a total of $550,622 to Cleckley &amp; McGee after Gateway notified the District of its claim. \r\nGateway Supply sued Cleckley &amp; McGee to recover under the payment a performance bond it posted for the project.Â  Gateway Supply recovered $38,533, its pro rata share of the amount owed to Monroe by Cleckley &amp; McGee at the time Gateway Supply furnished its notice.Â  Gateway Supply also sought to recover from Magdline on her personal guaranty.[2]Â  Magdline never answered the complaint, and the circuit court issued a default judgment against her for $68,511.79, which represents the balance for materials installed at the school, $5,225 in interest, and $18,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. \r\nGateway Supply also claimed breach of contract and sought damages based on quantum meruit against the District. Â The circuit court dismissed the breach of contract claim but permitted the quantum meruit claim to go forward.Â  The parties stipulated to the facts, and after trial, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of the District.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n Quantum meruit is an equitable remedy.Â  Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 8, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000).Â  In an action in equity, tried by the judge alone, without a reference, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Doe v. Clark, 318 S.C. 274, 276, 457 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1995).Â  This broad scope of review does not require the appellate court to disregard the findings of the trial court.Â  In re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, 571, 544 S.E.2d 854, 857 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Also, the appellant is not relieved of its burden of convincing this court that the circuit court committed error in its findings.Â  Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387-88, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001).Â  When this court is sitting in equity, we are to consider the equities of both sides, balancing the two to determine what, if any, relief to give.Â  See Foreman v. Foreman, 280 S.C. 461, 464-65, 313 S.E.2d 312, 314 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGateway Supply argues the circuit court erred in dismissing its quantum meruit claim.[3]Â  Specifically, Gateway Supply contends that the Districtâ€™s retention of the plumbing fixtures was unjust because the District made payments to Cleckley &amp; McGee after Gateway gave notice of Monroeâ€™s unpaid bill.Â  We disagree. \r\nTo recover under a quantum meruit theory, the following elements must be demonstrated: â€œ(1) a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention by the defendant of the benefit under conditions that make it unjust for him to retain it without paying its value.â€Â  Columbia Wholesale Co. v. Scudder May N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129, 130 (1994) (citations omitted); see also Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 9, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000) (adopting the quantum meruit test set forth in Scudder May).Â  Â â€œCourts addressing a claim of unjust enrichment by a subcontractor against a property owner have typically denied recovery where the owner in fact paid on its contract with the general contractor.â€Â  Scudder May, 312 S.C. at 262, 440 S.E.2d at 131 (citations omitted).[4]\r\nIn this case, although Gateway Supply conferred a benefit on the District, and the District realized that benefit, Gateway Supply has not indicated how the District is retaining the benefit under conditions that make it unjust to do so without paying its value.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina law provides for suits on payment bonds by remote claimants in the Mechanicâ€™s Lien statute for private construction contracts and in the Procurement Code for state construction contracts.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 29-5-440 (Supp. 2004) (providing for a suit on payment bond under the Mechanicâ€™s Lien chapter for every person who has furnished labor or materials to a bonded contractor or its subcontractor who has not been paid in full) and 11-35-3030(2)(c) (Supp. 2004) (providing for a suit on payment bond under the Procurement Code for every person who has furnished labor or materials to a bonded contractor or its subcontractor who has not been paid in full).Â  In both the private and public sector, a remote claimant, such as Gateway Supply, ensures the right to collect on the bond by giving notice to the contractor.Â  See id.Â  However, only in the law applying to mechanicâ€™s liens has the legislature provided that a lienholder shall be preferred to a contractor.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-50 (Supp. 2004) (â€œAny person claiming a lien under the provisions of this chapter who shall have given notice . . . shall be entitled to be paid in preference to the contractor. . . and no payment by the owner to the contractor thereafter shall operate to lessen the amount recoverable by the person so giving the notice.â€). \r\nIn this case, Cleckley &amp; McGee was awarded the construction contract under the Procurement Code.Â  See S.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 11-35-3010 (Supp. 2004). Gateway Supply was required to send notice to Cleckley &amp; McGee to collect on the payment and performance bond.Â  However, the notice does not require the District to pay Gateway Supply before paying Cleckley &amp; McGee.Â  Compare S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-35-3010 to -3060 with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-50.Â Â  \r\nTherefore, in balancing the equities, we find the District properly paid for the plumbing materials by satisfying its contract with the general contractor, Cleckley &amp; McGee.Â  Moreover, it was Gateway Supply that made the decision to sell the plumbing fixtures on credit to Monroe.Â  It would be inequitable to hold the District liable for Gateway Supplyâ€™s extension of credit.Â  Finally, we find Gateway Supply received its pro rata share of the bond claim and has a judgment against Magdline Monroe for the unpaid portion of its claim, interest, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Whether or not Gateway Supply can collect on its judgment against Magdline does not require a determination that the Districtâ€™s retention of the plumbing supplies was unjust.Â  To the contrary, Gateway Supply has a valid judgment in satisfaction of the entire amount it is due; thus, we find it would be unjust to entitle Gateway Supply to a potential double recovery.Â  \r\nAccordingly, because the equities favor the District, the order of the circuit court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Mark Monroe filed bankruptcy, and his liability to Gateway Supply was presumably discharged.Â  \r\n[3] Gateway Supply presented six issues on appeal arguing the trial court erred in entering judgment in favor of the District, each concerning specific findings of the trial court.Â  Because our scope of review permits us to find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we decline to separately address each issue presented by Appellant.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (finding an appellate court need not address remaining issues win disposition of prior issues is dispositive).\r\n[4] Gateway Supply argues the trial court erred in relying on Scudder May because it involved a private sector quantum meruit claim, not a public sector quantum meruit claim as in the present case.Â  We do not find this distinction conclusive because whether the claims are public or private under statutory law is merely one element relevant in balancing the equities, as discussed below.Â  See Foreman v. Foreman, 280 S.C. 461, 464-65, 313 S.E.2d 312, 314 (Ct.

Thomas Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-255\r\nHeard April 4, 2005 â€“ Filed April 7, 2005\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Todd Raymond Ellis, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Robert McKenzie, and Gary H. Johnson, II, both of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this civil action, Shirley Towne appeals the circuit courtâ€™s grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) in favor of State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, arguing the circuit court erred in holding judicial estoppel precluded Towneâ€™s argument to the jury.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn November 1999, a van driven by Bernard Stanley crossed the roadwayâ€™s center line and hit a vehicle driven by Towne, causing her to suffer various injuries.Â  In November 2001, Towne initiated this action claiming personal injury and defamation.Â  In her complaint, Towne asserted Clean It, Inc., doing business as Pro Clean, owned the van driven by Stanley.Â  Pro Clean filed an answer admitting ownership of the vehicle driven by Stanley and admitting the accident occurred while Stanley was acting within the course and scope of his employment with Pro Clean.Â  State Farm filed an answer and counterclaim, questioning whether its commercial liability policy issued to Pro Clean provided coverage for the accident.Â  \r\nIn December 2001, State Farm proposed a settlement, offering Towne the limits of Pro Cleanâ€™s liability policy as well as Towneâ€™s underinsured motorist coverage.[1]Â  Towne accepted the settlement and executed a covenant and agreement not to execute in consideration for the payment of the limits of Pro Cleanâ€™s policy in the amount of $100,000.00.Â  Towne also obtained payment of an additional $100,000.00 from her underinsured motorist carrier in exchange for a policy release.Â  In executing both settlement agreements, Towne made certain factual representations, including the assertion that the vehicle operated by Stanley was owned by Pro Clean.Â  The covenant and agreement not to execute and the policy release made no assertions or representations that the vehicle driven by Stanley was owned or â€œnon-ownedâ€ under State Farmâ€™s commercial liability policy issued to Pro Clean.Â  Towne specifically reserved the right to pursue recovery in the settlement documents under the commercial liability policy and that was the sole issue for consideration in State Farmâ€™s declaratory judgment action.\r\nWhen the declaratory judgment action proceeded to trial, Towne argued the vehicle driven by Stanley in the accident constituted a â€œnon-ownedâ€ vehicle under the definition provided in State Farmâ€™s commercial liability policy issued to Pro Clean.Â  State Farm moved for a directed verdict based on judicial estoppel, arguing that Towne was precluded from asserting the vehicle was â€œnon-ownedâ€ under the commercial liability policy because she had previously asserted that Pro Clean owned the vehicle.Â  The circuit court denied the motion, holding judicial estoppel was inapplicable to this action because Towne had not persuaded a court to accept her earlier position regarding ownership of the vehicle and was not attempting to mislead the court with a new position.Â  The issue was submitted to the jury, which found the vehicle to be â€œnon-ownedâ€ under the definition found in the policy.Â  State Farm moved for JNOV, arguing Towne should be judicially estopped from arguing the â€œnon-ownedâ€ vehicle exception to the jury because she had previously asserted that Pro Clean owned the vehicle involved in the accident.Â  The motion was granted by the circuit court.Â  Towne timely appealed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n In ruling on a motion for JNOV, the trial judge should not disturb the factual findings of a jury unless a review of the record discloses no evidence that reasonably supports them.Â  Horry County v. Laychur, 315 S.C. 364, 367, 434 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1993).Â  â€œThe jury verdict will be upheld if there is any evidence to sustain the factual findings implicit in the juryâ€™s verdict.â€Â  Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 515, 445 S.E.2d 651, 654 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  In making this determination, the judge must view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Gilliland v. Doe, 357 S.C. 197, 199, 592 S.E.2d 626, 627 (2004).Â  The trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  Curcio v. Caterpillar, Inc., 355 S.C. 316, 320, 585 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2003).Â  The trial judge must deny the motion when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inferences are in doubt.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003).Â  \r\nâ€œWhen considering the motion, neither this court nor the trial court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony and evidence.â€Â  Reiland v. Southland Equipment Service, Inc., 330 S.C. 617, 634, 500 S.E.2d 145, 154 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  We will reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling on a JNOV motion only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or where the ruling is controlled by an error of law.Â  Hinkle v. Natâ€™l Cas. Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616, 618 (2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Judicial Estoppel\r\nTowne asserts the trial court erred in granting State Farmâ€™s motion for JNOV in finding judicial estoppel precluded Towne from taking the position argued to the jury.Â  We agree.\r\nJudicial estoppel is an equitable concept that prevents a litigant from asserting a position inconsistent with, or in conflict with, one the litigant has previously asserted in the same or a related proceeding.Â  Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 251, 489 S.E.2d 472, 477 (1997).Â  Judicial estoppel as an equitable concept is a discretionary doctrine and should be applied sparingly with clear regard for the facts of the particular case.Â  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, 342 S.C. 352, 368, 536 S.E.2d 698, 706 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The application of judicial estoppel must be determined on a case-by-case basis, and must not be applied to impede the truth-seeking function of the court.Â  Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 83-84, 552 S.E.2d 767, 772 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure the integrity of the judicial process, and to prevent manipulation of the judicial system by the litigants.Â  Quinn v. Sharon Corp., 343 S.C. 411, 414, 540 S.E.2d 474, 475 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nIn Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 83, 552 S.E.2d 767, 772 (Ct. App. 2001), this court provided the following general guidelines for the doctrine of judicial estoppel to apply: (1) two inconsistent positions taken by the same party or parties in privity with one another; (2) the positions must be taken in the same or related proceedings involving the same party or parties in privity with each other; (3) the party taking the position must have been successful in maintaining that position and have received some benefit; (4) the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to mislead the court; and (5) the two positions must be totally inconsistent.Â  Recently, in Cothran v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 215-16, 592 S.E.2d 629, 632 (2004), our supreme court reaffirmed the Carrigg guidelines, holding them to be necessary elements for the doctrine of judicial estoppel to apply.\r\nThe evidence in this matter fails to satisfy the fourth necessary element of judicial estoppel.Â  The Cothran court held, as an element of judicial estoppel, the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to mislead the court.Â  Id. at 215-16, 592 S.E.2d at 632.Â  We find no evidence Towne sought to intentionally mislead the trial court.Â  To the contrary, the issue advanced to the jury in the declaratory judgment action was whether the vehicle involved in the accident qualified as a â€œnon-ownedâ€ vehicle under the definition provided in State Farmâ€™s commercial liability policy.Â  An assertion of ownership made by Towne in pleadings or in settlement documents does not preclude adjudication of that separate contract issue, nor does it preclude a finding that the vehicle qualified under the definition found in the policy.Â  Therefore, there was no intentional effort to mislead the court by Towne and without an intentional effort to mislead the court judicial estoppel cannot apply.\r\nII.Â  Additional Sustaining Grounds\r\nState Farm advances three additional sustaining grounds to allow this court to affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of JNOV in the event we find judicial estoppel inapplicable to the facts of this case.Â  Essentially, State Farm alleges Towne should be judicially bound by her pleadings.Â  We find this argument to be without merit.Â  \r\nWe hold any representations made by Towne in her pleadings in regard to the ownership of the vehicle involved in the accident are separate and distinct from the issue of whether the vehicle constitutes an exception to the â€œnon-ownedâ€ vehicle coverage afforded in State Farmâ€™s commercial liability policy issued to Pro Clean.Â  Therefore, any representations made by Towne in her pleadings have no bearing on whether the vehicle constitutes a â€œnon-ownedâ€ vehicle under the definition found in the commercial liability policy and do not judicially bind Towne in the declaratory judgment action.\r\nREVERSED. \r\nANDERSON, BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] State Farm provided insurance both to Towne as underinsured motorist coverage and Pro Clean as liability coverage and a commercial liability policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-256","title":"State v.

Dudek, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, and Ernest Charles Grose, Jr., of Greenwood, for Appellant.\r\n          Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia; and Solicitor William Townes Jones, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  PER CURIAM: This appeal arises from the conviction of Terrence Edwards for charges related to the death of Jonathan Blackston.Â  Edwards complains the State made statements during his trial that were inconsistent with those made by the State during a co-defendantâ€™s plea hearing.Â  Additionally, he argues prejudicial evidence should have been excluded.Â  We affirm. \r\n  FACTS  \r\n  Terrence Edwards and Sergio Marshall were indicted for the offenses of murder, armed robbery, grand larceny of a vehicle, possession of a pistol by a person less than twenty-one years of age, and possession of a firearm or knife during the commission of a violent crime.Â  All of the charges arose from the shooting of Jonathan Blackston.\r\nMarshall pled guilty to all of the charges and was sentenced to a total of thirty-five years imprisonment.Â  Subsequently, the case against Edwards went to trial.Â  The jury found against Edwards on all counts.Â  The court sentenced Edwards to thirty years imprisonment for murder, twenty-five years consecutive for armed robbery, and five years concurrent on each of the charges of grand larceny of a vehicle, possession of a pistol by a person under the age of twenty-one years of age, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\n  â€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829&nbsp;(2001).Â  â€œThis Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.â€Â  Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  \r\n  LAW AND DISCUSSION\r\n  \r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collateral and Judicial Estoppel\r\n  Edwards appeals his conviction, arguing the State pursued theories against him and Marshall that were inconsistent and should have been barred by collateral and judicial estoppel.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n  South Carolina courts have not specifically addressed the applicability of collateral or judicial estoppel in criminal prosecution.Â  The United States Supreme Court has recognized that collateral estoppel may be applied in cases of federal criminal law.Â  Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 443-44 (1970).Â  Collateral estoppel in practice â€œsimply means that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.â€Â  Id. at 443.Â  \r\n  We have adopted a rule for determining whether a party in South Carolina is precluded from relitigating an issue with a nonparty.Â  â€œ[T]o assert collateral estoppel successfully, the party seeking issue preclusion still must show that the issue was actually litigated and directly determined in the prior action and that the matter or fact directly in issue was necessary to support the first judgment.â€ Beall v. Doe, 281 S.C. 363, 371, 315 S.E.2d 186, 191 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\n  â€œJudicial estoppel precludes a party from adopting a position in conflict with one earlier taken in the same or related litigation.â€Â  Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 251, 489 S.E.2d 472, 477 (1997).Â  The doctrine exists to protect the integrity of the judicial process and courts rather than to protect litigants from allegedly improper or deceitful conduct by their adversaries. Id.Â  The supreme court has stated the following elements are necessary for the doctrine of judicial estoppel to apply: (1) two inconsistent positions taken by the same party or parties in privity with one another; (2) the positions must be taken in the same or related proceedings involving the same party or parties in privity with each other; (3) the party taking the position must have been successful in maintaining that position and have received some benefit; (4) the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to mislead the court; and (5) the two positions must be totally inconsistent.Â  Cothran v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 215-216, 592 S.E.2d 629, 632 (2004).\r\n  Importantly, a threshold determination in any discussion of the applicability of either collateral or judicial estoppel is that two inconsistent statements were made.Â  To determine this, the court must examine the exact language used at Marshallâ€™s plea hearing and Edwardsâ€™ trial.Â  \r\n  Chief Sheriffâ€™s Deputy Marion Johnson and Solicitor Townes Jones provided the factual predicate for the crime against Marshall.Â  Johnson began by explaining:\r\n  \r\n    Marshall . . . kind of held back on us, wouldnâ€™t tell us anything . . . .Â  He did come forward and admitted to shooting â€“ the defendant admitted to shooting . . . the victim . . . .Â  There were two gunshot wounds to the body, one to the arm and the other to the back of the head.Â  There was also blunt trauma around the chest and arms and the rest of the body. . . .Â  They also did take a wallet from the pocket of Mr. Blackston which contained about one hundred and fifteen dollars, and they split the money up and went to the Anderson County Fair . . . .\r\n  \r\n  Next, the court asked about Marshallâ€™s motive.Â  Johnson replied, â€œFrom what Mr. Edwards states and the best we can determine they were out there, and they were rolling up a joint . . . and for some reason Mr. Marshall was the one that actually shot Mr. Blackston.â€Â  \r\n  Solicitor Jones then interrupted and stated: \r\n  \r\n    [R]elying solely on the evidence that we would be prepared to present at trial in this case, you know, we would have presented to the jury that this defendant and the victim were together alone, they were acquaintances, and they had no prior evidence of a significant problem or threat to do bodily harm to either prior (sic) to this occasion.Â  But . . . there were verbal disagreements or verbal remarks between the two that one could surmise and conclude amounted to a kind of machismo standoff . . . .Â  [A]nd unfortunately a relationship that on the surface appeared to be one that involved friendship turned quickly, abruptly deadly.Â  That would be our argument.\r\n  \r\n  The solicitor continued regarding motive: \r\n  \r\n    We would not be able to argue that we had evidence to show that there was a conspiracy or that there was any plan and intent to commit this robbery, but nevertheless, the fact that it was conducted in conjunction with the murder in our opinion would give rise to argue at least that it was in the mind of the murderer.\r\n  \r\n  And concluded, â€œ[W]hat I have presented to you would have been the argument that we would have made from the facts that we felt we would have had at trial.â€ \r\n  Later, at Edwardsâ€™ trial, the solicitor in his closing statement explained the shooting might have begun as a robbery, but if Blackston refused, â€œMr. Gunman says enough of that, pop.â€Â  The solicitor continued by saying, â€œAssuming that Sergio was the shooter,â€ Edwards â€œhelped him move the body,â€ â€œget away from the scene,â€ they gave each other an alibi, and â€œaid[ed] and abet[ted] each other.â€Â  \r\n  Edwards argues the State suggested he was the gunman in the closing statement whereas the factual predicate in the Marshall plea shows the Stateâ€™s understanding and theory was that Marshall was the gunman.Â Â  \r\n  After a careful review of the record, we cannot determine the solicitorâ€™s comment that â€œMr. Gunman says enough of that, pop,â€ constitutes a suggestion Edwards was the gunman.Â  Edwards seeks to pair this language with the solicitorâ€™s comments on Edwardsâ€™ claim he was just an accessory after the fact with regards to the robbery charge.Â  The solicitor did ridicule such a claim, characterizing Edwardsâ€™ counselâ€™s argument as, â€œHeâ€™s going to try to tell you what I did for [Marshall] was dumb.Â  It was dumb and it was, uh, letâ€™s see, accessory after the fact.Â  He was already shot and dead, and Terrence came along and helped him afterwards, or he was already robbing him and Terrence just kind of helped him afterwards, kind of.â€Â  The solicitor did anticipate and attack the arguments likely to be advanced on behalf of Edwards, but we do not see how that attack contradicts the Stateâ€™s comments at Marshallâ€™s plea hearing.\r\n  In examining the transcript from the plea hearing, the only comment that gives the court pause is the solicitorâ€™s statement that â€œrelying solely on the evidence that we would be prepared to present at trial in this case . . . we would have presented to the jury that this defendant and the victim were together alone, . . .Â  [and the] friendship turned quickly, abruptly deadly.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The solicitorâ€™s use of the word â€œaloneâ€ is the linchpin of Edwardsâ€™ case.Â  However, when read against the full explanation that had just been provided to the court by Johnson, it is not enough.Â  Johnsonâ€™s explanation clearly showed that another person, Edwards, was present and a co-defendant in this case.Â  As such, any reliance on the term â€œaloneâ€ is mitigated by the fuller explanation provided to the court by the State.Â  Just as a court cannot view a term in isolation when interpreting a statute or contract, or determining whether a jury charge is in error, we will not wrench from context a comment made by the solicitor in this case.Â  See e.g. Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495-96, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134&nbsp;(2003).\r\n  After a careful reading of the Stateâ€™s explanation of the case in the Marshall plea hearing and the Stateâ€™s arguments at trial, we find no inconsistent position.Â  We specifically decline to address South Carolinaâ€™s adoption of either collateral estoppel or judicial estoppel in the criminal context, and instead hold that neither would apply because there was no inconsistency between the solicitorâ€™s positions.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admission of statement by Edwards\r\n  Edwards also argues a statement he made to police was so prejudicial that it should not have been admitted into evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\n  Edwards argues the court erred in admitting his statement: â€œSergio and I had joked before about robbing somebody.â€Â  He asserts it should have been excluded because the State was collaterally and judicially estopped from trying to make a planned robbery an issue based on its assertions at Marshallâ€™s plea hearing.Â  Edwards also argues the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.Â  We disagree.\r\n  After asserting that the State was barred from entering this evidence based on collateral and judicial estoppel, Edwards does not address this issue in the body of his argument.Â  In Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Partnership, 312 S.C. 102, 439 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. App. 1993), this court found an issue was abandoned on appeal when the parties raised the issue in their statement of appeal but did not argue it in their brief.Â  Id. at 106, 439 S.E.2d at 285.Â  We similarly find Edwards has abandoned this issue on appeal because he has not discussed it in his brief.\r\n  However, even if we were to consider the issue on appeal, we would determine that neither collateral nor judicial estoppel barred the introduction of the evidence that Marshall and Edwards joked about committing a robbery.Â  The Stateâ€™s explanation of the crime at Marshallâ€™s plea hearing was that:\r\n  \r\n    We would not be able to argue that we had evidence to show that there was a conspiracy or that there was any plan and intent to commit this robbery, but nevertheless, the fact that it was conducted in conjunction with the murder in our opinion would give rise to argue at least that it was in the mind of the murderer. \r\n  \r\n  This statement is at best inconclusive and unclear.Â  It admits the State did not have admissible evidence of a conspiracy to commit a robbery while also maintaining its commission in conjunction with the murder suggests it was in Marshallâ€™s mind.Â  The explanation that the State could not prove a conspiracy to commit robbery should not prevent introduction of the portion of the statement discussing the joking reference to robbing someone.\r\n  Edwards also argues the statement should have been excluded because it was overly prejudicial.Â  Rule 403, SCRE, says otherwise admissible evidence â€œmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . .â€Â  â€œUnfair prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis.â€Â  Kennedy v. Griffin, 358 S.C. 122, 127, 595 S.E.2d 248, 250&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004). \r\n  â€œA trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in â€˜exceptional circumstances.â€™â€Â  State v.

App. 2001).Â  â€œWe review a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding Rule 403 pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard and are obligated to give great deference to the trial courtâ€™s judgment.â€Â  State v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 48, 596 S.E.2d 488, 492&nbsp;(2004). \r\n  Because the testimony was that Edwards was at the scene of the crime, the joke was relevant to show he was acting in unison with Marshall.Â  Although the joke was certainly prejudicial, we also find it relevant.Â  We note the admission of the joke did not prevent Edwards from presenting a defense that he was merely present and not involved with the shooting.Â  In fact, this appears to have been the ultimate strategy of trial counsel.Â  It resulted in charges by the judge on mere presence and â€œthe hand of one is the hand of all.â€Â  We cannot determine that the testimony engendered any undue tendency in the jury to reach a verdict of guilty solely or even primarily on this evidence.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court did not abuse his discretion by allowing the testimony into evidence.\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  ANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-257","title":"State v.

Miller, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-273\r\nHeard March 9, 2005 â€“ Filed April 8, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLaurel R.S. Blair, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nStanley Earl McLeod, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal by a co-trustee of an order approving a proposed division of the assets of a testamentary trust.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1987, W.V. Haas died testate, survived by his widow, Nell P. Haas, and four children, W.V. Haas, Jr., (Appellant) Jean H. Gillespie, John E. Haas (John), and Susan K.H. Betenbaugh (Betenbaugh).[1]Â  Haasâ€™s will established two testamentary trusts, one for Mrs. Haas and the other for Haasâ€™s children.Â  Pursuant to the terms of the will, the trusts were to be merged after the death of Haasâ€™s widow and then distributed in four equal shares:Â  one share outright to Appellant, one share outright to Gillespie, one share outright to John, and one share to be held in trust by the co-trustees for the benefit of Betenbaugh and her son.[2]Â  \r\nIn his will, Haas specified how the funds held in trust for Betenbaugh and her son were to be handled by the co-trustees.Â  The relevant provision stated as follows:Â  â€œMy Trustees . . . shall encroach upon the corpus of the trust for up to One Thousand ($1,000) Dollars per month on a non-cumulative basis for the personal living expenses of my daughter, Susan K.H. Betenbaugh.â€Â  He also named his four children as co-executors and co-trustees of his estate, with the proviso that â€œJohn Edward Haas, serve as Chairman of my Co-Executors and Co-Trustees and, in the event of any deadlock in voting . . . John Edward Haas . . . shall cast the deciding ballot and shall unilaterally determine the course of action to be taken and shall break such deadlock.â€[3]Â  \r\nAs contemplated in the will, the trusts were merged after Mrs. Haasâ€™s death in 1999; however, the co-trustees could not agree on the final distribution of trust assets or on a $12,000 distribution to Betenbaugh.Â  Because of these disagreements, Respondents filed this action in probate court requesting approval of their proposed division of the trust.Â  Appellant answered and counterclaimed, alleging Respondents breached their fiduciary duty in dividing the trust assets and in allowing the distribution to Betenbaugh.Â  Appellant also sought an accounting by Respondents and a review of compensation and fees.\r\nThe probate court found the trust was ripe for termination and distribution according to Haasâ€™s will.Â  Pursuant to South Carolina Code section 62-7-707,[4] the court found that Respondents â€œappear to constitute a majority of Trustees and may therefore divide and distribute the Trust . . . assets into four (4) equal shares, pursuant to and in compliance withâ€ Haasâ€™s will and required them to provide a written accounting to all trust beneficiaries.Â  As to the division itself, the probate court ordered that (1) for valuation purposes, the appraised value of the real property trust assets would be used without any adjustments for capital gains or real estate commissions; (2) an appraisal of trust property at Lake Hartwell would be adjusted before the final distribution to account for lots sold after the prior appraisal and for utility development costs; and (3) trust property consisting of Pawleys Island beachfront real estate could be distributed to Respondents and Gillespieâ€™s children because of their strong interest in that asset.Â  Finally, the court upheld the $12,000 distribution to Betenbaugh, finding it was neither a violation of the trust terms nor a breach of fiduciary duty.[5]Â  \r\nAppellant then filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment of the probate court and a motion for sanctions, alleging in part:Â  (1) the probate court erred in finding Respondents did not breach their fiduciary duties or violate the terms of the trust; (2) Respondents improperly used â€œhindsightâ€ to distribute stocks based on what their market values were before the distribution; (3) Respondents did not divide the trust into four equal shares; and (4) Respondents intentionally disregarded an Architectural Review Committee concern about one of the properties distributed to Appellant.Â  The motion was held in abeyance, and the court required Respondents to complete the accounting and to address Appellantâ€™s concerns.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing on the motions, the probate court issued an order denying all matters raised in Appellantâ€™s motions except for the Architectural Review Committee issue.Â  The circuit court affirmed the findings of the probate court. Â This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIf the proceeding in the probate court is in the nature of an action at law, the circuit court may not disturb the probate courtâ€™s findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses there is no evidence to support them.â€[6]Â  â€œOn the other hand, if the probate proceeding is equitable in nature, the circuit court, on appeal, may make factual findings according to its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€[7]Â  When both the probate court and the circuit court, however, have considered the equitable claims and agree on the resolution of the issues, this court will not disturb their findings unless there is no evidence to support them in the record.[8]Â  \r\nHere, then, we will reverse a factual finding by the probate court only if the record has no evidence to support it.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  We find no merit to Appellantâ€™s contention that the $12,000 distribution to Betenbaugh was a cumulative distribution in violation of the trust terms. \r\nAlthough the trust specified that the distributions to Betenbaugh were to be non-cumulative, there is nothing in the trust terms that prohibited the distributions to be retained in the trust until such time as a full disbursement would be made.Â  Respondents both testified that Betenbaugh requested the $1,000 distributions but asked that they be deferred so she could save up enough money to purchase a car.Â  John testified that he made the distribution at Betenbaughâ€™s request and that Respondents, as two of the three co-trustees, approved the distribution.Â  Furthermore, Appellant himself testified that, although he did not recall Betenbaughâ€™s request, it was likely that he would have agreed to the distributions.Â  \r\n2.Â  Appellant contends Respondents ignored assumptions and qualifications on the appraisal when making the distribution.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trust clearly required the parties to divide the trust into four equal shares.Â  To achieve an even distribution of the trust property, the parties obtained an appraisal of all the property.Â  \r\nAppellant points to four main reasons the use of the appraisal values was improper.Â  First, the appraisal indicated one of the properties had a blocked easement, which would prevent access to the water.Â  Second, he asserts the values used in the appraisal should have been adjusted because the property would no longer be an entire development but would be split among multiple owners.Â  Third, he maintains the property allocated to him has been affected by grading done to the remaining properties.Â  Lastly, he argues there are other water access problems with the property that would prevent the appraisals from being accurate.\r\nWe first note Appellant failed to provide any evidence of the appropriate values to assign to the properties.Â  He has not shown how any of the property values would be affected by changes to the appraisal.Â  Second, we find there is ample evidence in the record to support the probate courtâ€™s findings that the issues raised did not adversely affect the distribution or constitute breaches by Respondents of their fiduciary duty.\r\nAlthough the appraisal indicated the interior lots owned by the trust may not have water access because of a fence erected by an adjoining landowner, John testified there was no fence blocking the access.Â  Appellant himself also testified the walkway is open and free from obstructions.Â  Furthermore, John testified the trust was not involved in litigation over the validity of the easement and, for the easement to be deemed abandoned, the trust would have to be a party to any litigation regarding the quality of the easement.\r\nAt trial, Appellant testified the value of the property would change if there were multiple owners trying to sell the same property.Â Â  Although the appraiser appeared to agree with this assertion, Appellant, when suggesting a division of the property, testified if one party owned the waterfront lots and another owned the interior lots, there should be no dilution of value as the parties would not be selling identical properties.Â  He testified:Â  â€œWe wouldnâ€™t be competing.Â  Iâ€™d be selling bananas and theyâ€™d be selling onions or vice versa.â€Â  The property was divided so there would be little to no competition among the owners to sell their lots.Â  In addition, neither Robinson nor Appellant attempted to quantify the diminution in the value of the property that would result from multiple ownership.\r\nRespondents had some of the lots graded so the placement of power lines would not be disrupted when the property was developed, causing driveways and other roads to be cut into the ground.Â  Appellant presented evidence of runoff resulting from this grading but never presented any testimony regarding either the costs to fix the runoff or the diminution in the value of the property as a result of the runoff.Â  As a result, there could only be speculation as to the change in the value of the property from its appraised value.[9]\r\nAccording to the appraisal, the remaining real property Appellant was to receive was a waterfront lot for which a pier permit could not be obtained because the neighboring lots had already received permits.Â  The inability to obtain a pier permit was figured into the valuation, and Appellant has not presented any evidence suggesting it was improperly disregarded in the appraisal.Â  \r\nWe therefore hold the probate court and the circuit court properly determined Respondents committed no breach of fiduciary duty in dividing the property based upon the appraised values.\r\n3.Â  We find no merit to Appellantâ€™s contention that the division was improper because Respondents failed to give him the lots he expressed a desire to own and instead kept the property for the partnership they created to contain their shares.\r\nThe order of the probate court dated August 29, 2002, provided the distribution was to comply with S.C. Code Ann. Section 62-7-302.Â  Section 62-7-302 provides that â€œ[a] A trustee shall consider in investing and managing trust assets those circumstances of the following as are relevant to the trust or its beneficiaries: . . .(h) an assetâ€™s special relationship or special value to the purposes of the trust or to one or more of the beneficiaries.[10]\r\nAlthough at trial Appellant testified he desired the waterfront lots instead of interior lots in Huntington Heights, he also acknowledged he had no â€œemotional tiesâ€ to any of the property and would be satisfied to sell all the property and receive cash. Â This admission is sufficient to support the probate courtâ€™s rejection of Appellantâ€™s assertion that Respondents failed to consider any special relationship between Appellant and the particular properties he desired to receive.\r\n4.Â  Appellant contends Respondents distributed the stocks in the trust using market hindsight in order to distribute stocks with the greatest loss to him while retaining the other stocks for themselves.Â  In support of this argument, he notes that the stock he received in the distribution suffered a loss of 3.5 per cent whereas the stocks allocated to the other beneficiaries suffered a loss of only 1.8 per cent.Â  The probate court, however, found there was no basis for this assertion.Â  We hold the record supports this finding.\r\nJohn described the method used for distributing the stocks.Â  He maintained the stocks to be distributed were selected on July 12.Â  Then using the valuations based on the July 30 statements, the final allocations of stocks were made.Â  He testified the accounts were not zeroed out until August and a dividend was received and distributed in September.Â  Specifically, John was asked â€œDid you look back at the stock values in order to determine how to attribute more losses to [Appellant]?â€Â  He responded:\r\n\r\nWe never looked back except for that reason.Â  We looked back to the July 30th time.Â  We never looked forward to see how it - - how it was affected at that time, and couldnâ€™t - - matter of fact, couldnâ€™t until we got the statement at the end of the month, unless you looked at it daily.Â  \r\n\r\n5.Â  Finally, Appellant argues the probate court erred in finding Respondents did not breach their fiduciary duty in rejecting his offer of $730,000 for the Pawleys Island beach house, asserting he made a good faith offer that exceeded the appraised value of the property.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellant testified he was making the offer with the hope of altering the appraisal value for the property.Â  The record indicates he contacted the appraiser to determine whether an offer made before his appraisal would affect the value placed on the property.Â  The following colloquy explains his motives:\r\n\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  Okay.Â  And so why did you make that call to [the appraiser]?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  To find out if that would influence his appraisal.\r\nQ.Â Â Â Â Â  So that you could get a higher value for the assets to give to the other beneficiaries?\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  If - - - if it was going to influence the appraisal, it would have had a bearing on what - - - at what point I made the offer, yes.Â \r\n\r\nIn our view, this testimony is sufficient to uphold the probate courtâ€™s refusal to find that Respondents breached a fiduciary duty in refusing Appellantâ€™s offer.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  John and Betenbaugh will also be referred to collectively as â€œRespondents.â€Â  \r\n[2]Â  Betenbaughâ€™s son, David V. Betenbaugh, was a named party to the action.\r\n[3] Gillespie died before this litigation ensued, and, although her children (Stephen D. Gillespie and Laura G. Greer) were made parties to this action, they were not co-trustees and were named in the will only as beneficiaries.\r\n[4]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-707(a) (Supp. 2004) (providing that â€œ[a]ny power vested in three or more trustees may be exercised by a majorityâ€).\r\n[5]Â  The probate court found that similar distributions to the other beneficiaries, including Appellant, did not violate the trust terms or constitute a breach of fiduciary duty.Â  \r\n[6]Â  In re Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 361, 434 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1993).Â  \r\n[7]Â  Id. at 361-62, 434 S.E.2d at 257-58. \r\n[8]Â  See Dean v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey A. Jacobs, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Randall Scott Tyler appeals his convictions for murder, first-degree burglary, and criminal conspiracy.Â  Tyler contends the trial court violated his constitutional right to confront an adverse witness by admitting testimonial hearsay statements made by his non-testifyingÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  co-defendant, Travis Harsey.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn July of 2002, Tyler asked his wifeâ€™s uncle, Jimmy Williams, to give him a ride to Harseyâ€™s home.Â  Williams obliged, and in the car on the way to Harseyâ€™s home, Tyler told Williams that he was mad at Robert â€œCorkyâ€ Lewis over a dispute involving money.Â  Tyler and Lewis were both drug dealers.Â  Tyler bought drugs from Lewis, and Harsey bought drugs from Tyler.Â  Tyler testified that he needed a ride to Harseyâ€™s so Harsey and he could go to Lewisâ€™s home to buy â€œcrystal methâ€ from him.\r\nWhen they arrived at Harseyâ€™s home, Harsey was there along with his girlfriend and some children.Â  Tyler and Harsey went into a separate room and talked for about ten or fifteen minutes.Â  Williams entered the room to tell them he was ready to leave.Â  When he did so, he saw a magazine for a semiautomatic pistol containing what appeared to be at least one bullet lying on the bed.Â  Tyler and Harsey told Williams they were going to Lewisâ€™s home.Â  One of the children in the home observed that Harsey had a gun.Â  Everyone in the house knew about the gun before Tyler and Harsey left.Â  At that time, Tyler and Harsey were dressed in jeans or baggy pants and t-shirts.Â  \r\nLater that night, Donna Hutto, Lewisâ€™s girlfriend, was awakened by the sound of arguing outside her home.Â  She recognized the voices of Tyler and Lewis.Â  Hutto had known Tyler for two or three years, and had seen him approximately ten to twenty times prior to the date of the incident.Â  Hutto heard Lewis identify the other speaker as â€œRandy,â€ and noticed that Lewis sounded scared.\r\nHutto looked out the front window to see if Tylerâ€™s car was parked outside, but saw no cars other than those belonging to Lewis and her.[1]Â  Hutto then looked into the backyard and saw Tyler walking into the garage.Â  He was wearing a baseball cap, a baseball jacket, jeans, and a partial mask.Â  Hutto recognized Tyler even though most of his face was covered.Â  She heard Tyler order Lewis to go into the house.Â  She could tell something was wrong because of the fear in Lewisâ€™s voice.Â  Hutto did not see or hear anyone else other than Lewis and Tyler. \r\nConcerned, Hutto left and drove to her brotherâ€™s home to call the police.Â  As she pulled out of the narrow driveway, she did not see any other vehicles.Â  When Hutto and her brother returned, Lewis was dead.\r\nPolice arrived soon afterward and found Lewis had six gunshot wounds and three blunt trauma injuries to the top of his head.Â  They found signs a struggle had occurred and that an intruder had searched the building.Â  For example, a dresser drawer in the main bedroom had been taken out and appeared to have been rummaged through.Â  Additionally, an overturned bar stool appeared to have been shoved up into the ceiling tiles in order to access an area above the ceiling where Lewis kept money.Â  Also, police found several sets of knuckle marks with traces of blood in the ceiling tiles.Â  \r\nHutto specifically identified Tyler as having been at her home and involved in an altercation with Lewis on the night of Lewisâ€™s murder.Â  She identified Tyler in a photo lineup without hesitation.\r\nThe next morning, Tyler told Williams that Lewis and he had argued.Â  Tyler also told Williams he had seen Harsey shoot Lewis, and he believed Lewis was dead.Â  Tyler asked Williams to fabricate an alibi that they were fishing on the date of the murder.Â  Williams initially obliged, but when pressed by police he admitted taking Tyler to Harseyâ€™s home on the day of the murder.Â  Tylerâ€™s family also told police Tyler and Williams were fishing that night.\r\nDNA testing confirmed that the blood from the knuckle marks on the ceiling in Lewisâ€™s house was Tylerâ€™s.Â  Also, after Tyler was arrested, officers noticed healing injuries on Tylerâ€™s knuckles.\r\nDuring a police interview, Harsey said that he had parked his car â€œback up towards the road hidden from [Lewisâ€™s] home.â€Â  Williamsâ€™s testimony led to Harseyâ€™s arrest and the underlying charges. \r\nTyler and Harsey were tried separately.Â  At trial, Tyler testified Harsey and he were engaged in a routine drug transaction with Lewis when Harsey unexpectedly pulled a gun and attempted to rob Lewis.Â  Tyler testified he immediately ran out of the house and got into Harseyâ€™s car as Harsey was leaving.Â  Over Tylerâ€™s objections, the court admitted Harseyâ€™s hearsay statement to police that he parked his car so that it was â€œhidden from [Lewisâ€™s] homeâ€ when they visited Lewis on the night of his murder.Â  The jury convicted Tyler of all charges and sentenced him to life in prison.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  â€œWe are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.â€Â  Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  Concerning the admission of evidence, the trial courtâ€™s determination will be sustained absent error and resulting prejudice.Â  State v. Brown, 333 S.C. 185, 189, 508 S.E.2d 38, 40 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe only issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in admitting Harseyâ€™s hearsay statement about where he parked the car.Â  Tyler maintains admission of the statement violated his right of confrontation because Harsey was tried separately and thus could not be cross-examined at trial.Â  Although we agree that the statement should not have been admitted, we find the error harmless. \r\nâ€œâ€˜Hearsayâ€™ is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  Harseyâ€™s out-of-court custodial statement was admitted at trial as a statement against interest under the hearsay exception of Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE.Â  Tyler does not dispute this ruling.Â  Instead, Tyler argues that the statement was testimonial in nature and thus violated his constitutional right of confrontation. \r\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in relevant part, that â€œ[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.â€Â  This provisionâ€”the â€œConfrontation Clauseâ€â€” has been incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment and applied to both federal and state prosecutions.Â  Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 406 (1965).Â  The Confrontation Clause ensures the right of an accused to cross-examine witnesses against him in court.Â  Additionally, it defines the scope of the admissibility of out-of-court statements.Â  Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 65 (1980), overruled in part by Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).Â  \r\nIn Crawford, the United States Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause bars use of out-of-court statements that are testimonial in nature, unless the declarant was unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine that witness.Â  Crawford 541 U.S. at 53-54.Â  The Crawford court expressly declined to formulate a comprehensive definition of â€œtestimonial,â€ but noted that ex parte testimony at a preliminary hearing and statements taken by police during interrogations must be considered testimonial under any standard.Â  Id. at 51-52.Â  \r\nBecause Harsey made the statement during a custodial interview with police, the statement is testimonial under Crawford.Â  See United States v. Jones, 393 F.3d 107, 110 (2nd Cir. 2004) (noting interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within the testimonial class).Â  Therefore, the admission of the statement was erroneous.Â  The State concedes this issue in its brief, as it only argues that admission of the evidence was harmless error. \r\nâ€œIt is well established that violations of the Confrontation Clause, if preserved for appellate review, are subject to harmless error review . . . and Crawford does not suggest otherwise.â€Â  United States v. McClain, 377 F.3d 219, 222 (2nd Cir. 2004).Â  Crawford violations do not mandate a new trial where the government can show beyond a reasonable doubt the error did not contribute to the verdict obtained.Â  Id.Â  To determine whether a Crawford violation is harmless error, a court must find it clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty even absent the inadmissible evidence.Â  United States v. Gilbert, 391 F.3d 882, 884 (7th Cir. 2004).Â  \r\nSouth Carolina law is in accordâ€”â€œ[e]rror is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€Â  State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 144, 591 S.E.2d 646, 653 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œWhether an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case.â€Â  Id. at 144, 591 S.E.2d at 652. â€œGenerally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.â€Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 380-81, 580 S.E.2d 785, 795 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Insubstantial errors not affecting the result are harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe admission of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence.â€Â  Pagan, 357 S.C. at 145, 591 S.E.2d at 653.\r\nHere, we find the admission of Harseyâ€™s statement, although erroneous, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Absent the improper hearsay, we find overwhelming evidence of Tylerâ€™s guilt as to all three charges: (1) criminal conspiracy, (2) murder, and (3) first degree burglary.Â  \r\nConspiracy is defined as â€œthe combination between two or more persons for the purpose of accomplishing an unlawful object or lawful object by unlawful means.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (2004).Â  The gist of the offense of conspiracy is the agreement or combination.Â  State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 133, 437 S.E.2d 75, 80 (1993).Â  Under South Carolina law, no overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is requiredâ€”the crime is the agreement itself.Â  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 323, 555 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2001).Â  To establish the existence of a conspiracy, neither proof of an express agreement nor direct evidence are essential.Â  Id.Â  However,Â  â€œthe conspiracy may be sufficiently shown by circumstantial evidence and the conduct of the parties.â€Â  Id.Â  The State must show a shared, single criminal objective to act together for their shared mutual benefit.Â  Gunn, 313 S.C. at 134, 437 S.E.2d at 80. \r\nTyler admitted Harsey and he went to Lewisâ€™s home to buy illegal drugs.Â  Additionally, circumstantial evidence suggests Tyler and Harsey were plotting to harm Lewis.Â  For example, Tyler told Williams in the car that he was mad at Lewis over a dispute involving money.Â  While at Harseyâ€™s house, Williams found the two alone in a room in which a magazine containing at least one bullet was visible.Â  One of the children in the house also saw the gun, and soon everyone in the house knew about it.Â  When Tyler and Harsey arrived at Lewisâ€™s house, Hutto noticed Tyler had changed clothes and was wearing a jacket, hat, and mask although it was mid-July.Â  Finally, evidence of Tylerâ€™s blood on the ceiling tiles suggests that Tyler did not run off immediately, as he claimed, but carried out a preconceived plan to rob Lewis.Â  \r\nThus, we find Tylerâ€™s guilt was conclusively proven even without the erroneously admitted evidence that Tyler and Harsey had hidden Harseyâ€™s car while at the murder scene.Â  We find admission of the statement was harmless as to the criminal conspiracy charge.Â  \r\nWe likewise find an abundance of evidence to support Tylerâ€™s burglary conviction.Â  To prove burglary in the first degree, the State must show that the defendant entered a dwelling without consent with the intent to commit a crime therein, and one of several aggravating circumstances were present.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (Supp. 2004).Â  The aggravating circumstances alleged in the indictment are established: \r\n\r\n(A) . . . \r\n  \r\n(1) Â Â Â  when, in effecting entry or while in the dwelling or in immediate flight, he or another participant in the crime:\r\n    \r\n(a) Â Â Â  is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive; or\r\n(b) Â Â Â  causes physical injury to a person who is not a participant in the crime; or\r\n. . .\r\n    \r\n(2) Â Â Â  the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a combination of both; or\r\n(3) Â Â Â  the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\r\n  \r\n\r\nId.Â  No break-in is required; it is sufficient that the entry be without consent.Â  State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 288 n.4, 350 S.E.2d 180, 185 n.4 (1986).\r\nHutto testified she saw and heard Tyler order Lewis into the house.Â  She noticed that Lewis appeared fearful.Â  Tyler does not assert that he had consent, or that the structure was not a dwelling.Â  The same evidence tending to show the existence of a conspiracy also tends to establish intent to commit a crime therein.Â  Tyler or Harsey had a gun, and Tyler donned a mask and heavy clothing to disguise his features.Â  In addition, police found the drawer had been rifled through and the ceiling damaged, and Tylerâ€™s blood was on the ceiling.Â  \r\nMoreover, all of the aggravating factors included in the indictment are present. Either Tyler or Harsey was armed with a deadly weapon, and they inflicted physical injury toâ€”and in fact killedâ€”Lewis, who was not a party to the crime.Â  Tyler also had two prior convictions for breaking and entering with intent to steal in Michigan.Â  Finally, the intrusion occurred after dark, sometime after 10:30 p.m.Â  Thus, we find the elements of first-degree burglary are established without the improperly admitted evidence.\r\nFinally, we find sufficient evidence to support Tylerâ€™s murder conviction.Â  Although the evidence does not clearly indicate who fired the fatal shot, the evidence nevertheless sustains Tylerâ€™s conviction.Â  Under the Pinkerton doctrine, each conspirator is liable for all acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy regardless of which conspirator actually committed the act.Â  Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 646-47 (1946); State v. Steadman, 257 S.C. 528, 543, 186 S.E.2d 712, 717 (1972); see also 16 Am. Jur. 2d Conspiracy Â§ 19 (2004).Â  Such liability is limited to acts within the scope of the conspiracy and acts reasonably foreseeably stemming from the conspiracy.Â  Pinkerton, 328 U.S. at 647-48.Â  Because evidence compellingly indicates Tyler and Harsey conspired to harm Lewis, Tyler is liable for Lewisâ€™s murder if it was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy or if it was a reasonably foreseeable result.Â  We find such evidence exists beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nEvidence that Tyler told Williams he was mad at Lewis and that Tyler and Harsey conversed in low tones in the back room with a gun point to the presence of malice.Â  The evidence further establishes that a physical confrontation with Lewis was within the scope of the conspiracy.Â  Moreover, evidence that Tyler wore a mask and ordered Lewis into the house, and that Tylerâ€™s blood was found on the ceiling tiles tends to show motive and a preconceived plan.Â  \r\nAny prejudicial effect arising from the Confrontation Clause violation was minimal because Tylerâ€™s repeated attempts to mislead the police evidenced guilt and undermined his credibility.Â  Tyler admitted that he told Williams to lie to police and to tell them they were fishing.Â  Tylerâ€™s family gave police the same alibi.Â  Tyler also told police to look for his brother instead, when in fact Tylerâ€™s brother was in Michigan on the date the incident occurred.Â  \r\nFinally, other evidence permitted an inference that the car had been hidden.Â  Hutto testified she looked out the front window and did not see a car.Â  She saw no other vehicles when she drove away.Â  An aerial photograph showed that there was no other place near the house to park.Â  We find Harseyâ€™s statement was cumulative to this evidence. \r\nBecause we find all of Tylerâ€™s convictions are supported beyond reasonable doubt by other evidence, we find no prejudice resulted from the erroneously admitted evidence.Â  Accordingly, the Crawford violation here was harmless. \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Lewis and Hutto lived in a house set back from the road and almost completely surrounded by woods.Â  Other than the driveway and carport, the only other ordinary place to park a car was in front of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-275","title":"baril v.

Morgan, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nHerbert W. Louthian, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Marolyn Baril brought this action for breach of an employment contract against Aiken Regional Medical Centers (Hospital).Â  A jury returned a verdict in favor of Baril, and Hospital appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMarolyn Baril, a nurse, brought this action for breach of an alleged employment contract after she was terminated by Hospital in 1999.Â  In 2001, the circuit court, Judge Rodney A. Peeples then presiding, granted summary judgment to Hospital.Â  On appeal, we reversed and remanded the matter for trial, concluding there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether Hospitalâ€™s policies and conduct created an employment contract, whether Hospital terminated Baril with just cause, and whether Baril made reasonable efforts to mitigate her damages.Â  See Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 573 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 2002) (a more detailed recitation of the factual background in this case is contained in the Baril I opinion).[1]  \r\nUpon trial, the jury returned a verdict for Baril in the amount of $210,000.00.Â  Hospital now appeals this verdict on ten enumerated grounds that can largely be grouped around its assertions that there was no evidence it breached an employment contract, Baril failed to mitigate her damages, and that the trial court failed to properly charge the jury on damages, improperly charged the jury on implied covenants and employer rights, allowed inadmissible evidence, and failed to grant Hospitalâ€™s post-trial motions.Â  A review of these issues follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Breach of an Employment Contract \r\nHospital argues that, even assuming the parties entered into a contractual relationship, it did not breach the alleged agreement.Â  Hospital asserts an employer is not liable for breach of contract if the employer had a reasonable, good faith belief (even if mistaken) that it had just cause to terminate an employee, and the undisputed evidence in this case is that it was justified in its belief it had cause for termination.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhile Hospital does not characterize its argument as the trial court erred in failing to grant either a directed verdict or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, this is inherent in its position.Â  \r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, this Court must employ the same standard as the trial courtâ€”that is, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Sauers v. Poulin Bros. Homes, Inc.,&nbsp;328 S.C. 601, 605, 493 S.E.2d 503, 504-05&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\nâ€œIn ruling on motions for directed verdict and JNOV [judgment notwithstanding the verdict], the trial court is required . . . to deny the motions where either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003) (quoting Strange v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994)).Â  \r\nâ€œThis Court will reverse the trial courtâ€™s rulings on these motions only where there is no evidence to support the rulings or where the rulings are controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Hinkle v. Natâ€™l Cas. Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 92, 96, 579 S.E.2d 616, 618&nbsp;(2003).Â  â€œWhen considering the motions, neither this Court nor the trial court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony and evidence.â€Â  Sauers, 328 S.C. at 605, 493 S.E.2d at 505. \r\nHospitalâ€™s argument is, in essence, that it did not knowingly allow other employees to place long-distance telephone calls through its toll-free line or allow any employee to instruct coworkers to violate a Hospital policy.Â  Hospital further asserts it â€œhad no legal or contractual duty to conduct a more laborious, time-consuming investigation than it conducted to support its decision.â€Â  It also points to the fact that ten other employees had been fired over a three-year period for various instances of fraud, theft, or dishonesty.Â  \r\nIn reviewing the record, however, we conclude there was testimony suggesting that Hospital did not have a reasonable, good faith belief for its termination of Baril.Â  First, Hospital knew of prior tension between Baril and one of her coworkers, Holly Martinez de Andino.Â  Second, it made the decision to fire Baril before hearing her explanation of the incident.Â  Third, Barilâ€™s proffered explanation was reasonable on its face.Â  Fourth, Hospital never interviewed Beth Pearson, the nurse Baril had initially spoken to before another employee transferred the call, to seek her description of the event.Â  Fifth, there was testimony that other people had similarly used Hospitalâ€™s toll-free number.Â  In this case, Barilâ€™s call had a nexus to Hospitalâ€™s work, as she would not have called had she not received the message that Hospital was looking for her.Â  Considering this and all of the evidence in the light most favorable to Baril, as we are required to do, we conclude the trial court did not err in submitting the case to the jury and in denying the motions for a directed verdict and a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\r\nII.Â  Damages \r\nHospital next argues that Baril should be barred from any recovery in this action because she failed to mitigate her damages and that the trial court committed error in its instructions on the issues of future and nominal damages.Â  We disagree.\r\na.Â  Mitigation \r\nIn Baril I we stated the rule on mitigation and noted that, generally, it is for a jury to determine whether a party acted reasonably to mitigate damages:\r\n\r\nA party injured by the acts of another is required to do those things a person of ordinary prudence would do under the circumstances, but the law does not require him to exert himself unreasonably or incur substantial expense to avoid damages.Â  Whether the party acted reasonably to mitigate damages is ordinarily a question for the jury.\r\n\r\nBaril I, 352 S.C. at 285, 573 S.E.2d at 838 (citation omitted).\r\nAt trial, Baril offered several reasons for her failure to seek employment at another hospital immediately after her termination.Â  First, she explained that she did not want to reveal to potential employers in the medical field that she had been fired, which would impugn her reputation.[2]Â  Second, she testified that she went to school for an extended period to become a family nurse practitioner.Â  Third, she would have had to leave her residence in Aiken to find another hospital position.Â  Fourth, Baril continued in a teaching position at the University of South Carolina at Aiken that she had held before her termination by Hospital and any further employment would have interfered with her teaching schedule.Â  At the time of this trial in 2003, Baril had resigned her teaching position and accepted full-time employment as a nurse practitioner, but she was laid off from that position prior to trial and was again seeking employment.Â Â Â  \r\nIn Baril I we found material issues of fact existed as to whether Baril made reasonable efforts to mitigate her damages; we concluded reasonable minds could disagree, so the issue should be resolved by a jury and not as a matter of law by the court.Â  Baril I, 352 S.C. at 285, 573 S.E.2d at 838.Â  \r\nWe again conclude the evidence presented issues of fact for determination by a jury as to whether Baril adequately mitigated her damages.Â  Moreover, we note the trial court correctly charged the jury that a discharged individual â€œis obligated to mitigate damages by accepting available alternative employment of the same or similar character.â€Â  The court further stated:Â  â€œ[A] party who claims that damages should have been minimized has the burden of proving that they could have been avoided or reduced, and itâ€™s up to you, the jury, to determine whether or not the employee has fully mitigated her damages.â€Â  Thus, the jury was free to accept or reject the testimony it heard regarding mitigation and to consider Barilâ€™s actions in determining her damages.Â  \r\nb.Â  Future Damages \r\nHospital next contends the trial court erred in charging the jury on future damages because no evidence warranted such a charge.Â  Hospital does not argue the charge as given was not a correct statement of the law; rather, it reasserts its mitigation argument, asserting Baril was not entitled to future damages because she did not seek employment for two years.Â Â Â  \r\nOur supreme court has made it clear that future damages are recoverable in actions for wrongful termination:Â  â€œA wrongfully discharged employee suing for breach of contract is entitled to receive the amount of the employeesâ€™ net losses caused by the employerâ€™s breach.Â  Such losses may include back pay as well as future damages.â€Â \r\nSmall v. Springs Indus., Inc., 300 S.C. 481, 484, 388 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1990) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nâ€œUnder current South Carolina law, the standard of admissibility for evidence of future damages is â€˜any evidence which tends to establish the nature, character, and extent of injuries which are the natural and proximate consequences of the defendantâ€™s acts . . . if otherwise competent.â€™â€Â \r\nPearson v. Bridges, 344 S.C. 366, 372, 544 S.E.2d 617, 620 (2001) (quoting Martin v. Mobley, 253 S.C. 103, 109, 169 S.E.2d 278, 281-82 (1969)).Â  \r\nIn the case before us, the trial court charged the jury according to current law.Â  We can find no error warranting reversal in this regard, especially in light of the fact that we have determined the court did not err in its rulings on the issue of mitigation.\r\nc.Â  Nominal Damages \r\nHospital also contends the trial court erred in refusing its request to charge the jury on nominal damages. \r\nâ€œThe law to be charged to the jury is determined by the evidence at trial.â€Â  Frazier v. Badger, 361 S.C. 94, 101, 603 S.E.2d 587, 590 (2004).Â  â€œIn reviewing jury charges for error, appellate courts must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.â€Â  Id.\r\nBecause we reject Hospitalâ€™s argument that Baril failed, as a matter of law, to mitigate damages and find Baril did introduce evidence of a loss of income, we conclude a charge on nominal damages is not supported by the facts of the case.Â  See Cleveland v. Bryant, 16 S.C. 634, 635 (1882) (â€œIt is only in cases destitute of facts that the judge is warranted in charging [on nominal damages] as requested here.Â  A judge may err in acceding to requests of the kind made in this case, but he will seldom err in refusing them; certainly, in such refusals as to matters of fact he should be safe from reversal by this court.â€).\r\nIII.Â  Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair DealingÂ  \r\nHospital next argues the trial court erred in allowing Baril to seek recovery for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing because she never pled this cause of action.Â  We disagree.\r\nOur recent decision in RoTec Services, Inc. v. Encompass Services, Inc., 359 S.C. 467, 472-73, 597 S.E.2d 881, 884 (Ct. App. 2004) makes it clear that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is not an independent cause of action, but is an implied term in every contract that is subsumed in a claim for breach of contract.Â  Thus, Baril was not required to plead breach of the implied covenant as a separate claim.\r\nIV.Â  Employersâ€™ RightsÂ  \r\nHospital contends the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on employersâ€™ rights.Â  We disagree.\r\nHospital specifically asserts:Â  â€œThe Trial Courtâ€™s refusal to charge the jury on the rights of employers prejudiced [it], as it had the unfettered right to determine the level and severity of its employeesâ€™ misconduct.Â  The Trial Court erroneously deprived the jury of this legal standard . . . .â€Â  \r\nOne example of Hospitalâ€™s proposed jury charges on employersâ€™ rights is as follows:\r\n\r\nEmployers enjoy the latitude and autonomy to make whatever business decisions they desire and to establish and enforce whatever policies and procedures that they deem appropriate.\r\nEmployers, and not employees, have the right to determine the level of severity of an employeeâ€™s misconduct and to apply [its] policies accordingly.Â  \r\n\r\nAlong these lines, Hospital also proposed charges related to Barilâ€™s duty of loyalty, such as employees â€œmust, at all times, abide by and follow their employerâ€™s instructions and policies . . . even if the employee considers those instructions and policies harsh and severe.â€Â  Another one instructed that if an employee is disloyal, he or she can forfeit the right to notice or a lesser disciplinary action and could be barred from receiving damages.Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œIn reviewing jury charges for error, appellate courts must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.â€Â  Frazier v. Badger, 361 S.C. 94, 101, 603 S.E.2d 587, 590 (2004).Â  â€œIf the instructions of the trial court, construed as a whole, correctly state the law, there is no reversible error.â€Â  Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 53, 557 S.E.2d 676, 686 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œTo entitle an appellant to reversal, the trial courtâ€™s instructions must be not only erroneous, but also prejudicial, and the enumeration of hypercritical exceptions will not suffice to overthrow a juryâ€™s verdict.â€Â  Id.\r\nWe have reviewed Hospitalâ€™s proposed charges and find no error in the trial courtâ€™s instructions to the jury.Â  We conclude the trial courtâ€™s instructions fairly set forth the law and we discern no prejudice to Hospital.Â  In the first instance, the charges regarding an employerâ€™s unfettered right to set policy is a broad generalization that is not applicable here.Â  We further conclude the charges related to Barilâ€™s duty of loyalty are factually inappropriate to this case.\r\nV.Â  Evidence \r\nHospital alleges the trial court erred in allowing certain testimony about its disciplinary policy and employeesâ€™ use of Hospitalâ€™s toll-free number.Â  We disagree.\r\na.Â  Statements Regarding the Disciplinary PolicyÂ  \r\nHospital argues the trial court erred in allowing testimony that Richard Lowe, Hospitalâ€™s Director of Human Resources, told Baril that Hospital policies, particularly the progressive disciplinary policy, would prevent her from being targeted for termination.Â  \r\nHospital argues this evidence should have been excluded because Baril never alleged an oral contract and this evidence violated the parol evidence rule by allowing extrinsic evidence regarding a promise of fairness.Â  Contrary to Hospitalâ€™s assertion, we do not regard this evidence as an attempt to demonstrate an oral contract.Â  Rather, it was meant to reveal Hospitalâ€™s own understanding and intent with regard to its employment handbook.Â  Thus, we find no error in this regard.\r\nb.Â  Use of Toll-Free Number \r\nHospital also argues the trial court should not have allowed testimony of other employeesâ€™ use of Hospitalâ€™s toll-free number because Baril did not demonstrate Hospital management ever allowed employees to use the toll-free number in such a manner.Â  \r\nBaril presented evidence that although she was terminated for using the toll-free line for personal use, she had actually used it for the business purpose of responding to a call placed by Hospital.Â  Baril had also contended Hospital did not have a published policy on the use of the toll-free number and that no one had ever been fired based on alleged misuse of the number.Â  Baril presented the evidence of other employeesâ€™ use of the toll-free number to demonstrate other employees did not regard this as a Hospital policy.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s admission of this testimony.Â  See Gamble v. Intâ€™l Paper Realty Corp., 323 S.C. 367, 474 S.E.2d 438 (1996) (stating the admission or exclusion of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion).\r\nVI.Â  Post-Trial Motions \r\nFinally, Hospital asserts the trial court should have granted its motion for a remittitur or exercised its power under the thirteenth juror doctrine to grant a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn its motion to alter or amend the judgment, Hospital maintained the evidence indicated Baril suffered either no damages or only nominal damages and â€œ[c]ertainly, there should be no future damages.â€Â  Alternatively, Hospital argues its motion for a new trial nisi remittitur should have been granted and Barilâ€™s damages should be reduced for the two years she did not specifically pursue employment in another hospital setting.Â  As to its request for a new trial absolute under the thirteenth juror doctrine, Hospital contended the juryâ€™s questions regarding whether it was to determine if Baril were treated fairly indicate the jury did not understand the trial courtâ€™s instructions; therefore, the trial court should have granted a new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  \r\nâ€œOn appeal, this court presumes the jury awarded an amount of damages within its discretion and it views all the evidence and the inferences reasonably deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict.â€Â  Howle v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 288 S.C. 586, 601, 344 S.E.2d 157, 165 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  â€œThe denial of a motion for a new trial nisi is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Oâ€™Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 527, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993).Â  â€œ[O]n appeal of the denial of a motion for a new trial nisi, this Court will reverse when the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive requiring the granting of a new trial absolute.â€Â \r\nId.\r\nâ€œUnlike a motion for directed verdict, the trial judge weighs the evidence under the thirteenth juror doctrine and need not view it in the light most favorable to the opposing party.â€Â  McEntire v. Mooregard Exterminating Servs., Inc., 353 S.C. 629, 633, 578 S.E.2d 746, 748 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œMoreover, the question of whether to grant a new trial upon the facts is one addressed to the discretion of the trial judge.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIn reviewing the denial of a motion for a new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine, we consider only whether there is any evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s decision.â€Â  Haselden v. Davis, 341 S.C. 486, 506, 534 S.E.2d 295, 306 (Ct. App. 2000), affâ€™d, 353 S.C. 481, 579 S.E.2d 293 (2003).Â  â€œTo reverse such a denial, we must find the moving party was entitled to a directed verdict at trial.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nHospitalâ€™s remittitur argument essentially reiterates its previous arguments regarding mitigation.Â  We have previously determined that mitigation was properly submitted to the jury.Â  We, therefore, find no error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  We likewise find there is evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny a new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine as there was sufficient evidence to present a jury question in this case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment below is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Hospital terminated Baril in 1999 after she reportedly used Hospitalâ€™s toll-free line to make a personal call while she was on vacation in Washington state.Â  Hospital found the call violated its written policy HR116 prohibiting â€œ[d]ishonesty, fraud, theft (regardless of amount), [or] unauthorized removal of hospital property,â€ each of which constituted a â€œcritical offenseâ€ warranting immediate termination.Â Â Â Â  \r\nBarilâ€™s explanation was that she called Hospital on the toll-free line after receiving a message from her sister that Hospital was looking for her.Â  When Baril finished speaking to Hospitalâ€™s staff, she asked to be transferred to her sister to follow up. According to Hospitalâ€™s phone bill, Baril spoke to her sister for about .32 of a minute, or about twenty seconds.Â  Baril told her sister that she had received the message and that she had confirmed that Hospital knew she was on vacation, so nothing further was needed.Â Â Â  \r\nBaril offered to pay for the call, but Hospital refused to accept payment.Â  There is no evidence in the record as to any monetary loss suffered by Hospital for the call.Â  Baril believed the true cause of her termination was not the call, but that another employee, Holly Martinez de Andino, had targeted her for termination.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Baril did, however, work at several part-time positions as a nurse practitioner that did not require her to reveal her separation from Hospital.Â  For example, she worked at a clinic and also with a physician who already knew her.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-276","title":"Collins v.

Creson, of Augusta, for Appellant.\r\nJeffrey Raymond Moorehead, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this domestic action, Paul D. Collins (Husband) argues on appeal that the family court judge erred in providing an outline of her decision to the parties to use in drafting the proposed order.Â  Additionally, Husband contests alimony, fairness of the division of property, transmutation of a car he owned prior to the marriage, and the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm in part, modify in part, and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Annette M. Collins (Wife) were married in 1983.Â  The parties had two sons, one born in 1984 and one born in 1988.Â  The parties separated in February 2002 when Wife and the children left the marital home.Â  On March 15, 2002, Wife brought a pro se action for child support.Â  After Husband filed an answer and a counterclaim for separate support and maintenance, Wife retained counsel and filed an amended complaint in which she also sought separate support and maintenance.Â  \r\nThe family court judge issued a temporary order granting sole custody of the children to wife.Â  Husband was ordered to pay $479.30 per month in child support for the two children, decreasing to $322.48 after the oldest son reached the age of majority in August 2002.Â  Husband was further ordered to pay $800 per month in alimony.Â  \r\nAfter the hearing, the family court judge provided counsel for each of the parties with an outline of her decision and instructed Wifeâ€™s counsel to prepare a draft order.Â  The order awarded sole custody of the children to Wife and specified the visitation schedule for Husband.Â  Husband was ordered to pay child support of $106.13 per week and alimony of $560 per month.Â  The marital home and the land were awarded to Husband, but he was ordered to pay Wife 50% of the property value within 60 days after the order was filed.Â  Wife was allowed to keep the marital lot, on which she placed the mobile home in which she was living, with a 50% offset to Husband.Â  The marital personal property was divided approximately 50/50.Â  A Camaro Z28 automobile owned by Husband prior to the marriage was included as marital property and awarded to Husband.Â  Finally, Husband was ordered to pay Wifeâ€™s attorney fees in the amount of $1,500.Â Â  \r\nBoth parties filed motions to alter and amend the judgment.Â  The family court judge denied both motions.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Use of Outline\r\nHusband first argues that the family court judge erred in providing an outline of her decision to both parties to aid in drafting the final order.Â  Husband argues the outline rendered it unclear whether the family court judge considered all the factors required by law in reaching her decision, and it provided insufficient guidance for preparation of the final order.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code lists fifteen factors for the court to consider in equitably apportioning a marital estate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004); Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Similarly, section 20-3-130(C) requires the family court judge to consider thirteen factors in determining alimony.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2004); Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 290, 555 S.E.2d 386, 390 (2001).Â  This court will affirm an order for equitable distribution if it can be determined that the family court judge addressed the statutory factors sufficiently for us to conclude she was cognizant of the factors.Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Neither the apportionment of marital property nor the decision to award alimony will be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Hinson .v Hinson, 341 S.C. 574, 577, 535 S.E.2d 143, 144 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting the decision to award alimony will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion); Bungener v. Bungener, 291 S.C. 247, 251, 353 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding the apportionment of marital property is discretionary).Â  \r\nThe family court judgeâ€™s outline as provided to the parties merely indicated her ultimate decision regarding distribution and alimony; it did not recite that the judge had considered all the factors required by law in reaching her decision.Â  Nevertheless, in the final order, each statutory factor was considered and discussed.Â  The order noted the length of the marriage, the party having primary custody of the minor children, the partiesâ€™ respective earnings, and the identity and value of the marital property.Â  Further, the section addressing alimony specifically listed eighteen reasons supporting an award of alimony, including the age and health of the parties, the contributions made to the marriage by each party, the conduct of each party, and the standard of living of the parties.Â  The family court judge signed the order and denied Husbandâ€™s motion to alter or amend the order based upon the use of the outline.Â  We find sufficient evidence that the family court judge considered all the factors required by law.Â  The family court judge also had the opportunity to make any changes she thought necessary before she signed the order.Â  Thus, there was no abuse of discretion.\r\nII. Alimony\r\nRelying upon E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812 (1992), and on Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 489 S.E.2d 212 (Ct. App. 1997), Husband argues the family court judge erred in awarding alimony to Wife because she is self-supporting and he has no financial ability to pay her alimony.Â  He further asserts that the amount of alimony was excessive.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 183-84, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support that is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€Â  McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 599, 506 S.E.2d 1, 9 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse in the position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.Â  Id.Â  However, alimony should not â€œserve as a disincentive for spouses to improve their employment potential or to dissuade them from providing, to the extent possible, for their own support.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThis case was an action for separate maintenance, not a divorce.Â  In actions for separate maintenance, alimony is to be awarded according to the factors applied in divorce actions.Â  Riverbark v. Riverbark, 301 S.C. 175, 178, 391 S.E.2d 232, 233 (1990); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-140 (Supp. 2004)(noting that when determining alimony in actions for separate support and maintenance, the family court considers the factors for awarding alimony in a divorce action).Â  Factors to be considered in making an alimony award include:Â  (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and non-marital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) other factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2004).Â  Permanent periodic alimony is the favored form of alimony under South Carolina law.Â  Jenkins, 345 S.C. at 95, 545 S.E.2d at 535.Â  â€œIf a claim for alimony is well-founded, the law favors the award of permanent periodic alimony.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nAs noted above, the family court judge considered all the statutory factors in reaching her decision, especially the income, financial condition, and standard of living of the parties.Â  The judge noted that Wife had living expenses of $1,269.50 per month and an imputed minimum wage income of $892.67 per month.Â  Wife was also awarded $101.08 per week in child support.[1]Â  Although the judge found Wife would benefit from further education, the judge also found that further education would not substantially increase Wifeâ€™s income potential.Â  The judge noted that Wifeâ€™s standard of living substantially decreased upon the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  \r\nAs to Husband, the family court judge noted that he earned $3,871.11 in gross monthly income, had $2,192 in monthly expenses, and would receive $37,500 in marital property in the equitable distribution.Â  Considering those factors and the great likelihood that Husbandâ€™s income would increase, the judge specifically found that Husband would be able to pay alimony in the amount of $560 per month.Â  In awarding Wife $560 in permanent, periodic alimony, the family court judge reduced Husbandâ€™s prior $800 alimony obligation from the temporary order.Â  \r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the award of alimony to Wife.Â  Wife earned substantially less than Husband and suffered a decrease in her standard of living.Â  Based upon Husbandâ€™s gross income at the time of the final hearing, Husband should be able to pay his own expenses, child support, and $560 in alimony to Wife each month, with funds remaining.Â  Thus, despite Wifeâ€™s ability to earn her own income, we find the award and amount of alimony was supported by the record.[2]Â  \r\nIII. Equitable Distribution\r\nHusband argues the family court judge erred in equitably dividing the marital property.Â  Specifically, Husband faults the judgeâ€™s inclusion of a Camaro owned prior to the marriage as marital property to be divided and the decision to award 50% of the interest in the marital home to Wife.Â  We agree in part.\r\nA. Transmutation of the Camaro Z28 Automobile\r\nâ€œThe apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Greene, 351 S.C. at 340, 569 S.E.2d at 399.Â  If the family court judge weighs the factors listed in the statute, the decision will be affirmed on appeal regardless of whether this court might have weighed the specific factors differently.Â  Id.Â  Our focus is on the overall fairness of the apportionment.Â  Id.  \r\nUnder the equitable apportionment statute, only marital assets are divided.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004).Â  Marital property is defined in section 20-7-473 as â€œall real and personal property acquired by the parties during the marriage which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation, regardless of how legal title is held.â€Â  Hatfield, 327 S.C. at 368, 489 S.E.2d at 217.Â  \r\nProperty owned by one of the spouses before the marriage, however, can be transmuted into marital property.Â  Transmutation occurs when nonmarital property:Â  â€œ(1) becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable; (2) is titled jointly; or (3) is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property.â€Â  Id.Â  The spouse claiming transmutation bears the burden of producing objective evidence that the parties regarded the property as common property during the marriage.Â  Greene, 351 S.C. at 338, 569 S.E.2d at 398.Â  â€œThe mere use of separate property to support the marriage, without some additional evidence of intent to treat the property as marital, is not sufficient to establish transmutation.â€Â  Id.\r\nBoth parties testified that Husband owned the Camaro prior to the marriage.Â  However, there was conflicting testimony as to whether the car was debt-free at the time of the marriage.Â  Wife testified that Husband had taken out a second loan on the car that he continued to pay after the parties married.Â  Husband testified that the loan was paid off before the marriage began.Â  Husband also admitted that Wife drove the car â€œfor awhile during the marriage.â€Â  The family court judge found the Camaro was marital property, valued the car at $1,000, and awarded it to Husband in the 50/50 division of the property.Â Â  \r\nThe only evidence presented at trial was that Husband owned the car prior to the marriage and that Wife used the car on occasion.Â  We can discern no evidence from the record that the parties intended the Camaro to be marital property.Â  Wifeâ€™s mere use of Husbandâ€™s car on occasion would not support transmutation, absent more.Â  Further, the fact that Husband continued to pay on the car after the parties married would not indicate an intent to transmute the car.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the family court judgeâ€™s finding that the car was marital.\r\nIn the instant case, the family court judge ordered a division of the property resulting in a near 50/50 split.Â  There is nothing in the record meriting a reversal of this provision.Â  As discussed above, the family court judge considered all the statutory factors in making her decision.Â  Therefore, we affirm the order to the extent that it calls for a 50/50 split of the marital property.Â  However, because we find the family court judge erred in awarding the Camaro to Husband as part of his 50% share of the marital estate, we modify the order by reducing the total marital estate by $1,000, the value of the Camaro.Â  Husband shall be awarded $500 to bring his property award closer to the 50/50 division the family court judge intended.Â Â  \r\nB. Disposition of the Marital Home\r\nHusband asserts the judge erred in awarding Wife a one-half interest in the marital home by failing to consider the amount of alimony Husband was required to pay, his inability to pay his own expenses, and his inability to pay Wife her half-interest in the home without selling the home. Â \r\nâ€œIn order to effect an equitable apportionment, the family court may require the sale of marital property and a division of the proceeds.â€Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 360, 384 S.E.2d 741, 745 (1989).Â  The family court can also grant one spouse title to the marital home as part of the equitable distribution.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe family court judge awarded the marital home to Husband.Â  However, to effectuate a 50/50 division of the marital property, Husband was required to pay Wife her half-interest in the home within sixty days after the order was filed.Â  Since the house was valued at $26, 941, this payment, minus offsets, totaled $12, 471.Â  \r\nWe see no impropriety in the amount of the award.Â  As previously discussed, the family court judge considered the statutory factors in rendering a division of the marital estate.Â  However, we find the judgeâ€™s requirement that Husband pay Wife her 50% interest in the house within sixty days to be inequitable insofar as it would require Husband to dip into his retirement.Â  Accordingly, we modify the family court judgeâ€™s award to allow Husband ninety days to either sell or mortgage the house in order to raise the funds necessary to pay Wife if he is unable to pay her half-interest. \r\nIV. Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband argues the family court judge erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife because she is self-supporting and the award of alimony was improper.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nThe family court may order payment of attorneyâ€™s fees to a party pursuant to statute.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(H) (Supp. 2004).Â  Whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the award will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bowen v. Bowen, 372 S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d 271, 272 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The family court should consider: the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fee; the beneficial results obtained by counsel; the financial conditions of the parties; and the effect of the fee on each partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  E.D.M., 307 S.C. at 476-77, 415 S.E.2d at 816.Â  To determine the amount of an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider: the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; the time necessarily devoted to the case; counselâ€™s professional standing; the contingency of compensation; the beneficial results obtained; and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991). \r\nHusband essentially argues that the award of $1,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife should be reversed because it was based primarily upon the award of alimony.Â  As previously discussed, we believe the alimony award was proper.Â  Further, we find no abuse of discretion in the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family court judge specifically noted in the final order that beneficial results were obtained for Wife in that she prevailed on the issue of alimony.Â  The judge considered the nature of the action, the complexity of the issues presented, the time devoted to the case, the skill and reputation of Wifeâ€™s attorney, and the partiesâ€™ respective abilities to pay.Â  Accordingly, we find no error with the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the family court judge did not abuse her discretion in providing an outline to the parties to aid in drafting an order.Â  We further find no abuse of discretion in the award of alimony and the amount awarded.Â  We affirm the equitable distribution scheme to the extent that it provides for a 50/50 division of the property.Â  We reverse the final order as to the transmutation of the automobile and modify the 50/50 division of marital property to award Husband $500 to bring his property award closer to the 50/50 division intended.Â  We modify the order so as to allow Husband 90 days to sell or mortgage the marital home if he is unable to pay Wife her share.Â  Finally, we affirm the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family courtâ€™s order is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED in part, MODIFIED in part, and REVERSED in part. \r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â As of February 10, 2005, the partiesâ€™ youngest child should have reached the age of seventeen.Â  However, the family court judgeâ€™s order failed to indicate whether Husbandâ€™s child support obligation would end when the child reached the age of eighteen.Â  Accordingly, we do not know when Husbandâ€™s child support obligation ends.Â  Because neither party raised this issue on appeal, it is not before us on review.Â  \r\n[2] Further, we find Husbandâ€™s reliance upon E.D.M. and Hatfield misplaced as the facts are distinguishable.Â  In E.D.M., our supreme court found alimony to the wife was inappropriate as she was employed, self-sufficient, had significant savings, had medical expenses that were likely to decrease in the future, and made minimal contributions during the four-and-a-half year marriage.Â  E.D.M., 307 S.C. at 476, 415 S.E.2d at 815-16.Â  Likewise, in Hatfield, this court affirmed the family court judgeâ€™s denial of alimony to the wife where she had ample means to support herself.Â  Hatfield, 327 S.C. at 367, 489 S.E.2d at 216 (noting that the wife had a bachelorâ€™s degree in business administration and two associateâ€™s degrees, had been in the workplace for many years, held many responsible positions, had substantial assets, and was considerably younger than the husband).Â  Here, the family court judge found that although Wife could work, her standard of living since the time of separation had decreased and she was in need of alimony.Â  We agree with this finding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-277","title":"State v.

Hicks, Earle G. Prevost, of Greenville, Charles S. Bradford, of York and Michael E.\r\nKozlarek, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This case relates to the foreclosure sale of certain real property.Â  Owner Brian K. Wells and his brother J. Scott Wells appeal from an order of the master-in-equity denying Brianâ€™s motion for relief from the judgment and dismissing Brian and Scottâ€™s independent action in equity.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBrian owned a parcel of real property in York County worth approximately $135,000.[1]Â  On March 12, 1998,[2] Brian executed a note and mortgage in the amount of $46,662 against the property in favor of NationsBank, which is now Bank of America.Â Â  \r\nBrian defaulted on the mortgage and Bank of America brought a foreclosure action in 2002.Â  Brian failed to answer or otherwise plead.Â  Bank of America sent Brian notice of the foreclosure hearing, but he failed to appear.Â  Brian has admitted that he knew of both the foreclosure and the hearing.Â  The master entered a decree of foreclosure on May 16, 2002, and the decree was served upon Brian.Â  Brian did not appeal from this decree. \r\nThe decree directed that the property be sold at a public sale on July 1, 2002.Â  Because Bank of America also sought a deficiency judgment, the decree provided, in relevant part, as follows:\r\n\r\nBecause a personal deficiency judgment has been sought, the sale will not be final as of the closing of bidding on sales day but will remain open for thirty (30) days for upset bids.Â  Plaintiff reserves the right to waive its right to a deficiency, which deficiency waiver may be in writing prior to the sale.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Notice of Sale was advertised in The Herald for three consecutive weeks and provided, in relevant part, as follows:\r\n\r\nSince a deficiency judgment is being sought, bidding will not be final as of sales day but will remain open for 30 days for upset bids.Â  The plaintiff reserves the right to waive deficiency up to and including the date of the sale.Â  \r\n\r\nOn June 28, 2002, the Friday before the Monday on which the public sale was scheduled, Bank of America waived its right to a deficiency judgment by a letter to the master.Â  Brian was not sent a copy of this letter.Â Â Â  \r\nBrian did not attend the July 1, 2002 public sale.Â  At the sale, the master announced that the deficiency had been waived, so the sale would be final at the close of the bidding.Â  Walter G. Matthews and Carol A. Matthews were the successful bidders and bought the property for $52,100.48.Â  The Matthews were given a Masterâ€™s Deed for the property and asserted control over the property by evicting Brian.Â  \r\nBrian subsequently filed a motion under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, for relief from the judgment.Â  Brian and Scott also filed a separate action in equity to collaterally attack the judgment and sale.Â  Scott alleged that he was a creditor of Brian and that Brianâ€™s lost ability to bid on the property deprived Brian of the funds to repay him.Â  After a hearing, the master issued an order reaffirming the sale and ratifying the deed to the Matthews.Â Â  \r\nBrian and Scott filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment which was denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nMotions for relief under Rule 60(b) are within the masterâ€™s discretion, and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Hillman v. Pinion, 347 S.C. 253, 255-56, 554 S.E.2d 427, 429 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the masterâ€™s order is controlled by an error of law or is without evidentiary support.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Rule 60(b) Motion\r\nBrian[3] argues that the master should have granted his motion for relief from judgment because the judgment was the result of excusable neglect and the judgment was void.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œIn determining whether to grant a motion under Rule 60(b), the trial judge should consider: (1) the promptness with which relief is sought, (2) the reasons for the failure to act promptly, (3) the existence of a meritorious defense, and (4) the prejudice to the other party.â€Â  Mictronics, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 510-11, 548 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Brian seeks relief based upon two grounds: (1) excusable neglect or mistake; and (2) that the judgment is void. \r\nA. Excusable Neglect\r\nBrian initially argues that he did not know that Bank of America had waived its right to seek a deficiency judgment because he was never served with the notice.Â  Thus, he argues, he was prejudiced because he had no notice the sale would be final, denying both Brian and Scott the opportunity to place upset bids thirty days after the sale.Â  \r\nPursuant to Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, a court â€œmay relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for . . . mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.â€Â  Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  However, a party may not invoke Rule 60(b) as a substitute for an appeal from a final judgment, particularly when the issue could have been litigated at trial and on appeal.Â  Tench v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Educ., 347 S.C. 117, 121, 553 S.E.2d 451, 453 (2001).Â  Instead, Rule 60(b) â€œis an appropriate remedy for good faith mistakes of fact if all other applicable factors are met.â€Â  Hillman, 347 S.C. at 256, 554 S.E.2d at 429.Â  This rule generally may not be used as a vehicle for relief from mistakes of law.Â  Id.Â  Failure to understand the legal process does not constitute excusable neglect under Rule 60(b).Â  Hill v. Dotts, 345 S.C. 304, 310, 547 S.E.2d 894, 897 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nBrian knew that his property was to be sold on July 1, 2002, and he failed to take any action in that regard.Â  He essentially argues that he would have taken some action to protect himself if he had known what the post-foreclosure sale procedures would have been.Â  As will be discussed in more detail below, Rule 71(b), SCRCP, allows a creditor to waive the right to a deficiency judgment in writing at any time prior to the sale.Â  Thus, Bank of America acted within its authority to waive a deficiency judgment.Â  Brianâ€™s decision not to protect his rights through appearance and his misunderstanding regarding what would happen after the foreclosure sale did not rise to the level of mistake or excusable neglect.Â  His actions, instead, amounted to a mistake of law and relief was not available under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the masterâ€™s decision to deny relief pursuant to Rule 60(b) in this regard.\r\nB. Void Judgment\r\nBrian next contests the propriety of the foreclosure sale itself, arguing that the decree, as administered through the subsequent sale, failed to meet the requirements imposed by law because he was not given due process.Â Â Â  We address the many arguments in support of Brianâ€™s claim separately.\r\n1. Decree\r\nBrian essentially argues that the original foreclosure decree was void because it was somehow altered by the procedures of the subsequent sale.Â  \r\nRule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, provides that a party may seek relief from judgment where the judgment is void.Â  However, the definition of void for Rule 60(b)(4) purposes â€œonly encompasses judgments from courts which failed to provide proper due process, or judgments from courts which lacked subject matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction.â€Â  McDaniel v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 324 S.C. 639, 644, 478 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œA judgment is not rendered void by irregularities which do not involve jurisdiction.â€Â  Universal Benefits, Inc. v. McKinney, 349 S.C. 179, 183, 561 S.E.2d 659, 661 (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â  \r\nBrian has not offered anything tending to show that the decree of foreclosure was invalid.Â  Brian admits that he had notice of the foreclosure action, the hearing, and the decree.Â  He concedes that he did not appear in the foreclosure action prior to the entry of judgment and that he did not appeal the decree.Â  The evidence in the record shows that due process was given to Brian prior to entry of the decree, and Brian does not challenge the masterâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction over the foreclosure action.Â  Thus, nothing in the record indicates that the decree was a â€œvoidâ€ judgment.Â  Therefore, Brianâ€™s only challenge to the decree would have been pursuant to an appeal.Â  Because he failed to appeal from the decree, the validity of the decree is the law of the case and Brian has waived any right to challenge it. \r\n2. Foreclosure Sale Violated Due Process\r\nBrian argues the foreclosure sale was void because the lack of notice regarding the withdrawal of the waiver of deficiency amounted to a lack of due process.Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œProcedural due process requires notice, the opportunity to be heard in a meaningful way, and judicial review.â€Â  Blanton v. Stathos, 351 S.C. 534, 542, 570 S.E.2d 565, 569 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, there is â€œno requirement of law that parties to a suit for foreclosure be given personal notice of a judicial sale.â€Â  Peoples Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc. v. Graham, 291 S.C. 178, 182, 352 S.E.2d 511, 514 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  All that is required is that the requirements of law for public notice of judicial sales are met.Â  Id.Â  \r\nDue process requirements were met in this case.Â  Brian does not dispute that he received notice of the hearing and the decree.Â  The sale was properly advertised.Â  He was not entitled to personal notice of the sale.Â  If he had attended the sale, he would have heard the announcement that the deficiency had been waived.Â  Nor was Brian entitled to personal notice of the waiver.Â  No statute or rule imposes such a requirement, and this court is not empowered to append additional requirements to the statutory scheme.Â  See Ex parte Moore, 352 S.C. 508, 511, 575 S.E.2d 561, 562 (2003) (noting that the terms of a judicial sale are controlled by court order, Rule 71, SCRCP, and statute, and finding the imposition of a bright-line 5:00 p.m. deadline on judicial sales was not allowed by statute and should be reversed). \r\nScott also claims that his due process rights were violated by the same actions.Â  He claims that he lost the right to redeem the property at its true value and to, consequently, reduce the debt owed to him by Brian.Â Â  \r\nScott was not a party to the foreclosure action.Â  Instead, he requested to have the Rule 60(b) motion treated as an independent action in equity.Â  â€œA party is not bound by the label he puts on his paper.Â  A motion may be treated as an independent action or vice versa as is appropriate.â€Â  11 Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ.2d Â§ 2868 (1995).Â  However, Scottâ€™s argument fails because he has no protected interest in the subject property.Â  \r\nTo have a property interest triggering due process protection, a person must â€œshow that he was arbitrarily and capriciously deprived of a cognizable property interest rooted in state law.â€Â  Sunset Cay, LLC v. City of Folly Beach, 357 S.C. 414, 430, 593 S.E.2d 462, 470 (2004).Â  Although the record indicates that Scott was the prior owner of the underlying property and conveyed it to Brian, the record does not indicate any terms of the conveyance, including any debt owed by Brian.Â  Even assuming Scott was Brianâ€™s creditor, there is no evidence that Scott had any security interest in the property, or any other interest justifying his inclusion in this proceeding.Â  Therefore, Scott lacks standing to challenge the validity of this foreclosure sale through Rule 60(b).Â  Further, in spite of his lack of standing, Scott received notice of the sale through the advertisement and had the opportunity to bid on the property at that time.Â  \r\n3. Application of Rule 71(b)\r\nBrian argues that the waiver should not have changed the statutory requirement that bidding remain open for thirty days after the sale.Â  He asserts that the master erred in relying upon Rule 71(b) instead of the statutes regarding the procedures at a judicial sale. \r\nâ€œThe terms and conditions of a judicial sale are controlled by court order, Rule 71, SCRCP, and statute.â€Â  Ex parte Moore, 352 S.C. at 510, 575 S.E.2d at 562.Â  The General Assembly provided by statute that in foreclosure sales the bidding must remain open for thirty days after the sale for upset bids.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-720 (2005).Â  However, when the creditorâ€™s complaint states that he is waiving right to a deficiency judgment, the thirty-day requirement does not apply.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-760 (2005).Â  When this occurs, the notice of sale must state that no deficiency judgment has been demanded and therefore the sale will be final as of the date of the foreclosure sale.Â  Id.Â  \r\nRule 71 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure also addresses the procedure for foreclosure sales.Â  Subsection (b) of that rule provides, in relevant part, as follows:Â  \r\n\r\nUnless the pleadings state that no personal or deficiency judgment is demanded or any right to such judgment is expressly waived in writing, the bidding shall not be closed upon the day of sale but shall remain open until the thirtieth day after such sale exclusive of the day of the sale.\r\n\r\nRule 71(b), SCRCP (emphasis added).Â  The enabling legislation for the Rules of Civil Procedure contains a statement of legislative intent that in the event of a conflict between a rule and a procedural statute, the rules should control.Â  Act No. 100 Â§ 3, 1985 S.C. Acts 277. \r\nAlthough the statutes appear to require notice of the waiver in the complaint and notice of sale, Rule 71(b) allows waiver to be made in writing and contains no time requirement.Â  In fact, case law prior to the adoption of Rule 71 contemplated that the choice of whether to seek a deficiency judgment need not be made in the complaint.Â  See e.g. Perpetual Bldg. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n of Anderson v. Braun, 270 S.C. 338, 339-40, 242 S.E.2d 407, 407-08 (1978) (holding that the right to seek deficiency judgment is incidental to the mortgage foreclosure and that the language of section 15-39-760 indicates the General Assemblyâ€™s intent to deny a deficiency judgment only when it has been expressly waived).Â  Because the right to seek a deficiency judgment belongs to the creditor, so does the right to waive a deficiency.Â  We do not interpret the statutes as forbidding a creditor to later waive its right to a deficiency if it is not originally done in the pleadings.Â  Thus, allowing a party to waive the right to a deficiency at any time prior to the sale pursuant to Rule 71(b), SCRCP, does not conflict with the statutory procedures regarding foreclosure sales. \r\nAlthough Bank of America prayed for a deficiency judgment in the original foreclosure complaint, Bank of America notified the master in writing that it wanted to waive its right to deficiency prior to the sale.Â  Both the decree and the notice of sale provided notice that Bank of America was reserving its right to waive its claim for a deficiency up to the time of sale.Â  All parties involved in this matter and the general public were on notice of the possibility that the foreclosure sale could be final the day of sale if the bank waived its right to a deficiency.Â  Because Bank of America properly notified the master in writing of its waiver of deficiency, the thirty-day requirement did not apply, and the master properly found that the sale was final.\r\n4. Disparity Between Notice of Sale and the Decree\r\nBrian argues that the sale was invalid because the language of the notice of sale varied from the language in the decree.Â  As set forth above, both documents contained language providing for the possibility of a waiver prior to the sale.Â  The decree stated that Bank of America could waive its right to a deficiency â€œin writing prior to the sale.â€Â  However, the notice stated that the bank could waive the deficiency â€œup to and including the date of the sale.â€Â Â Â  \r\nBecause we find that Rule 71(b) allows a waiver of deficiency to be made in writing at any time prior to the sale, we find the difference to be immaterial.Â  The inclusion of language providing notice of the possibility of a waiver was consistent with the statutory framework and with Rule 71(b).Â  The master did not abuse his discretion in finding that the difference between â€œprior to the saleâ€ and â€œup to and including the date of the saleâ€ did not result in a lack of notice to Brian or materially prejudice him. \r\nIn summary, we hold that the master did not abuse his discretion in denying the Rule 60(b) motion because Brian cannot meet the standard provided in Mictronics, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 510-11, 548 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Although he promptly sought relief, he has no explanation for the failure to appeal from the decree.Â  The foreclosure sale is not void for lack of due process.Â  Further, the sale is not void due to the timing of the written waiver of deficiency or because the notice of sale language regarding the reservation of the right to waive deficiency was worded differently than from the decree.Â  \r\nIV. Equitable Claims\r\nBrian and Scott argue that their independent action in equity was the proper procedure for Scott, as a non-party to the initial judgment, to challenge the foreclosure sale.Â  They argue that the master erred in denying the independent action in equity because the underlying judgment was the result of mistake.Â  Finally, they assert the master erred in finding the equities favored the Matthews as bona fide purchasers.Â  Although we agree that an independent action in equity is the proper method for a non-party to challenge a judgment, we find that the Wellsâ€™ independent action lacked merit.Â  We agree with the master that the Matthews are bona fide purchasers.\r\nA. Mistake as Grounds for Independent Action in Equity\r\nThe ability to seek relief from judgment due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect pursuant to Rule 60(b) does not limit a courtâ€™s power to â€œentertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.â€Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  An independent action in equity is also the proper vehicle through which a non-party to the original action may challenge the prior judgment.Â  First Carolinas Joint Stock Land Bank of Columbia v. Knotts, 191 S.C. 384, 401-02, 1 S.E.2d 797, 805 (1939) (noting that it was appropriate for the bank to bring an independent action in equity to test the propriety of judgments in actions to which it was not a party).Â  A judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive as to parties to the action and those in privity and may not be set aside by evidence that it was irregular or improperly obtained.Â  Knotts, 191 S.C. at 401-02, 1 S.E.2d at 805.Â  Moreover, a judgment normally may not be impeached in a separate action unless there is evidence of fraud, collusion, or want of jurisdiction.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nWe do not dispute that a non-party, such as Scott, is entitled to bring an independent action in equity to challenge a judgment.Â  However, we find no merit to Scottâ€™s argument on appeal that he was entitled to relief from the judgment due to mistake.Â  Scottâ€™s argument in support of this issue on appeal is that mistake was alleged in Brianâ€™s motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, and the same reasons apply equally to Scottâ€™s claim.Â  However, Brianâ€™s arguments rely upon â€œexcusable neglectâ€ and Scott does not specify what â€œmistakeâ€ entitled him to relief.Â Â  \r\nTo the extent that Scott attempts to argue that the lack of notice of the written waiver of deficiency caused him prejudice, we find the master did not err in denying his independent action for relief from the judgment.Â  As previously discussed, Bank of Americaâ€™s decision to waive its right to a deficiency judgment prior to the foreclosure sale did not violate statutory law and was made pursuant to procedural rules.Â  Further notice was given at the foreclosure sale that it would be final. Â Scottâ€™s failure to appear at the foreclosure sale to place a bid on the property because he mistakenly believed that he would have thirty days after the sale in which to place an upset bid does not amount to a mistake entitling him to relief. \r\nB. Balancing the Equities\r\nBrian asserts the master erred in finding the Matthews, as purchasers, were entitled to greater protection under equity.Â  Citing Goethe v. Cleland, 323 S.C. 50, 448 S.E.2d 574 (Ct. App. 1994), he argues that the improprieties in handling the sale invalidated the purchasersâ€™ title.\r\nWith regard to innocent purchasers, the South Carolina Code provides as follows:\r\n\r\nUpon the execution and delivery by the proper officer of the court of a deed for any property sold at a judicial sale under a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction the proceedings under which such sale is made shall be deemed res judicata as to any and all bona fide purchasers for value without notice, notwithstanding such sale may not subsequently be confirmed by the court.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-870 (2005).Â  Generally, public policy requires that â€œthe validity of judicial sales be upheld, if in reason and justice it can be done.â€Â  Cumbie v. Newberry, 251 S.C. 33, 37, 159 S.E.2d 915, 917 (1968).Â  Thus, generally, a â€œpurchaser in good faith at a judicial sale is not affected by irregularities in the proceedings or even error in the judgment,â€ so long as the purchaser made inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court ordering the sale and whether all the proper parties were before the court when the order was made.Â  Id.Â  Thus, while a bona fide purchaser may not have knowledge of irregularities in the procedures, a bona fide purchaser is charged with knowledge of the terms of the judgment.Â  Goethe, 323 S.C. at 55, 448 S.E.2d at 576.Â  \r\nIn Goethe, the creditor requested a deficiency judgment in the foreclosure pleadings.Â  However, the order erroneously provided that the sale would be final as of the date of the sale, in violation of the requirement that bidding remain open for thirty days for upset bids.Â  Goethe 323 S.C. at 52, 448 S.E.2d at 575.Â  The property was auctioned under the erroneous order, but the Clerk of Court discovered the error before the buyer could comply with the bid.Â  Consequently, no deed was ever issued.Â  Id. at 55, 448 S.E.2d at 576.Â  This court affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s decision to set aside the sale, noting that the purchaser was not a â€œbona fide purchaser for valueâ€ without notice of the irregularity of the proceedings because: the sale was never completed; the purchaser was charged with notice of the terms of the judgment indicating that the mortgagor sought a deficiency judgment; and the purchaser was charged with the knowledge that the proper procedure when a deficiency is sought is that the bidding remains open for thirty days.Â  Goethe, 323 S.C. at 55, 448 S.E.2d at 576-77.\r\nThe facts in the present case are distinguishable.Â  As previously discussed, the correct procedures were followed regarding notice of the final sale and waiver of the deficiency. Â The notice of sale and the decree both indicated that Bank of America could choose to waive the right to a deficiency.Â  The master announced at the sale that the deficiency judgment was waived and the sale would be final.Â  Thus, there were no irregularities that would affect the judicial sale.Â  Further, a deed was delivered to the Matthews.Â  We find no error with the masterâ€™s determination that the Matthews were bona fide purchasers without notice. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that Brian has failed to demonstrate excusable neglect or mistake sufficient for relief from a judgment under Rule 60(b).Â  We further hold that Brian has waived any right to contest the decree under Rule 60(b) by failing to appeal, and that Bank of Americaâ€™s written waiver without notice to Brian did not violate either Brianâ€™s or Scottâ€™s due process rights because the waiver was proper under Rule 71(b) and notice to other parties is not required by law.Â  We find no material disparity between the terms of the decree and the notice of sale.Â  Additionally, we find no mistake that would justify granting relief to Scott in his independent action in equity.Â  Finally, we hold that even if the sale were conducted improperly, it may not be set aside because the Matthews are good faith purchasers for value without notice.Â  Accordingly the order of the master is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED. \r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  It appears that Scott was the prior owner of the property and conveyed it to Brian on March 2, 1998.Â  However, nothing in the record indicates the terms of the conveyance.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Brian and Scott allege in their brief that the mortgage was actually executed in 1996.Â  The mortgage documents in the record show a date of March 12, 1998, and the master held in his decree that the mortgage was executed on that date.Â  Neither Brian nor Scott argues on appeal that the master erred in finding the mortgage was executed on March 12, 1998.Â  Thus, that finding is the law of the case.\r\n[3]Â  Although only Brian was a party to the foreclosure action and the motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, it appears from the Wellsâ€™ brief that Scott is joining in on all of Brianâ€™s arguments.Â  As will be discussed more fully below, because Scott was only a party to the separate action in equity, only his arguments on appeal relating to the separate equity action will be addressed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-280","title":"State v, Hall","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2005-UP-280","description":null,"date":"2005-04-20","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoBodyText\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.documentbody1\r\n\t{font-family:Verdana;}\r\n.SpellE\r\n\t{}\r\n.Section1\r\n\t{page:Section1;}\r\n.Section2\r\n\t{page:Section2;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nThe State,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent,\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nStanley Melvin Hall,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAppellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Spartanburg County\r\nJohn C.

Hutson, both of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Robert E. Hill appeals the trial courtâ€™s dissolution of his partnership with Virginia C. Harbert and the apportionment of partnership proceeds.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1998, Hill and Harbert formed a partnership to purchase residential homes at foreclosure sales, renovate them, and sell them for profit.Â  Under their oral partnership agreement, Hill was to locate the houses and oversee their remodeling and renovation.Â  Harbert was to arrange for or provide the financing.Â  \r\nIn practice, however, the partnership quickly developed into a one-person operation with Harbert handling many of Hillâ€™s assigned responsibilities.Â  Harbert incurred the expense of hiring an employee to supervise renovations.Â  Additionally, Harbert became concerned Hill was using partnership assets for his personal business.Â  \r\nDue to Hillâ€™s actions, Harbert â€œfiredâ€ him in August 2000.Â  Hill retained tools and a pick-up truck purchased for use in partnership ventures.Â  Harbert continued to make payments on the truck, but Hill abandoned it in Tennessee with extensive damage to the exterior and electrical system.Â  \r\nIn an effort to wind up the partnership, Harbert incurred additional expenses to repair the vehicle so it could be sold.Â  Harbert also completed renovations and sold three homes owned by the partnership.Â  \r\nHill sued Harbert in 2001 seeking judicial dissolution of the partnership and an accounting of partnership assets.Â  Hill also alleged breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.Â  \r\n The trial court held a bifurcated trial, found a partnership existed, ordered the partnership dissolved, and granted judgment for Harbert in the amount of $10,255.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA case with legal and equitable issues presents a divided scope of review.Â  Kuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 589, 538 S.E.2d 15, 20 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  When legal and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal or equitable for purposes of the applicable standard of review on appeal.Â  Corley v. Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 92, 485 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1997). \r\nAn action for damages arising from breach of fiduciary duty is at law, but the suit must sound in equity if equitable relief is sought.Â  Bivens v. Watkins, 313 S.C. 228, 230, 437 S.E.2d 132, 133 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  In an action at law, the trial judgeâ€™s findings of fact will be upheld unless without evidentiary support.Â  Corley, 326 S.C. at 92, 485 S.E.2d at 99.\r\nAn action for an accounting of a partnership is equitable.Â  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  On appeal, the appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Fiduciary Duty\r\nHill asserts the trial court erred in finding Harbert did not breach her fiduciary duties.Â  Hill specifically complains that Harbertâ€™s management of the partnership assets and bookkeeping constituted a breach.Â  We disagree.\r\nA partnership imposes a fiduciary relationship upon individuals who are obligated to refrain from taking advantage of one another by even the slightest misrepresentation or concealment.Â  Lawson v. Rogers, 312 S.C. 492, 498-99, 435 S.E.2d 853, 857 (1993).Â  A fiduciary relationship imposes mutual duties of loyalty, good faith, and fair dealing.Â  Id.  \r\nâ€œParties in a fiduciary relationship must fully disclose to each other all known information that is significant and material, and when this duty to disclose is triggered, silence may constitute fraud.â€Â  Ellie v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 100, 594 S.E.2d 485, 497 (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Anthony v. Padmar, Inc., 320 S.C. 436, 449, 465 S.E.2d 745, 752 (Ct. App. 1995)).\r\nThe behavior of a partner is not governed by marketplace principles or with an eye to personal advantage, but to universally recognized obligations of loyalty, good faith, and fair dealing between partners.Â  See Few v. Few, 239 S.C. 321, 336, 122 S.E.2d 829, 836 (1961); Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 251, 599 S.E.2d 467, 472 (Ct. App. 2004); see also 59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership Â§ 420 (1987).\r\nA partnership may be dissolved, but those fiduciary duties continue to exist during the winding up period when the partnership affairs are completed.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-920 (Supp. 2004).Â  If a partnership agreement does not stipulate an ending date, then the partnership is an agreement at will, subject to dissolution by the act of one or more partners.Â  McPherson v. J.E. Sirrine &amp; Co., 206 S.C. 183, 208, 33 S.E.2d 501, 511 (1945); see also 59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership Â§ 819 (1987).\r\nHill offered no evidence to demonstrate Harbert denied him access to partnership accounts or records or prohibited him from participating in the management of the business.Â  To the contrary, Hill admitted on cross-examination that he had access to the partnership books.Â  The record reveals the partnership began with the parties collaborating to share responsibilities and declined to the point that Hill became an inactive member who caused conflict with members of the work crew when he did choose to participate.Â  \r\nHarbert acted within her rights as a partner to terminate the partnership.Â  Harbert also acted properly to begin the process of winding up the partnership affairs by renovating and selling the partnershipâ€™s remaining assets.Â  \r\nII.Â  Partnership Funds\r\nHill argues the trial court erred by finding he failed to establish the amount of partnership funds Harbert allegedly spent without authority.Â  We disagree.\r\nHill alleges Harbert spent partnership funds on renovating two properties that were not owned by the partnership.Â  Hill acknowledged Harbert maintained meticulous accounting records.Â  Hill was unable to demonstrate that either of the two properties was renovated with partnership funds.Â  A plaintiff has the burden of proof on allegations raised in his pleadings.Â  See Smith v. Smith, 50 S.C. 54, 65, 27 S.E. 545, 550-51 (1897) (finding moving party in an equity action has burden of proving he was aggrieved and party must provide more than mere allegations in the pleadings).Â  Hill failed to provide any evidence that Harbert spent partnership funds on non-partnership properties.\r\nWe therefore affirm the trial court in its determination that Hill failed to prove the amount of partnership funds, if any, spent by Harbert in an allegedly unauthorized manner.\r\nIII.Â  Apportionment\r\nHill asserts the trial court erroneously apportioned the partiesâ€™ assets and liabilities based on the parties respective conduct as well as their relative contributions to the business.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn dissolution of a partnership, each partner has an equal right to possession of partnership property and assets, as they are joint property of the partners.Â  59A Am. Jur. 2d Partnership Â§ 894 (1987).\r\nWe note the parties stipulated the trial court could apportion partnership property in an equitable manner, a manner that necessitates weighing the behavior and actions of the parties.Â  We are mindful of the deference we give to the trial court who was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the parties and their witnesses.Â  See Townes Assocs., 266 S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 775.Â  Moreover, our own review of the record indicates the trial court had ample evidence to support its conclusion that Hill owed Harbert $10,225 in partnership proceeds.Â  \r\nHill maintained exclusive possession of several partnership assets including tools and a company truck.Â  Hill violated his duty to the partnership by abandoning the truck in another state in such a deteriorated condition that it had to undergo extensive repairs before it could be sold.Â  As the trial court correctly noted:Â  â€œWhat [Hill] ignores is the obligation to use partnership property in good faith and in furtherance of the partnership business.â€Â  \r\nAccordingly, we conclude the trial court did not err in its apportionment of partnership assets and liabilities.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-284","title":"State v.

Jack, of Baltimore, for Appellant.\r\nJoseph F. Singleton, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â  Data Search, Inc. appeals the master in equityâ€™s order finding it liable for damages to Money First Financial Services for providing incorrect title information related to a mortgage loan closing.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 2000, W.E. and Lois Montgomery sought to refinance their existing mortgage with Money First.Â  Money First contracted with Data Search to perform a title search of the Montgomerysâ€™ property and assist in the loan closing.Â  Money First chose Data Search due to the previous work it had done as an agent for Stewart Title Guaranty Company in connection with the Montgomerysâ€™ existing mortgage that was closed in 1999.Â  Money First retained Stewart Title to issue a title insurance policy.Â  \r\nData Search in turn employed a title abstractor to research the title and, following the closing, record the mortgage.Â  This was the same abstractor who examined the title and issued a report on the 1999 mortgage.Â  In 1999 and 2000, the abstractorâ€™s report noted the Montgomerys only had a life estate in their land.Â  \r\nIn updating her 1999 report for the 2000 loan, the abstractor informed Data Search they had incorrectly reported the Montgomerys owned the property in fee simple.Â  A Data Search representative informed the abstractor that Data Searchâ€™s records indicated the Montgomerys owned the property as tenants in common, and the representative instructed the abstractor to record the mortgage.Â  \r\nPrior to closing, Stewart Title issued a title commitment through Data Search, its agent, which stated the Montgomerys owned the subject property in fee simple.Â  Data Search served as closing agent for the loan and issued a first lien title clearance letter that failed to inform Money First of the true state of the Montgomerysâ€™ ownership interest.Â  Both the title commitment and final title policy issued by Data Search stated the Montgomerys held a fee simple interest in the property.Â  Money First loaned a substantial sum in reliance on Data Searchâ€™s assertions regarding the extent of the Montgomerysâ€™ ownership of the property.Â  \r\nAfter closing, Money First assigned its mortgage to Key Bank.Â  The Montgomerys subsequently defaulted on the loan.Â  Key Bank began foreclosure proceedings and, as a result, learned the true status of the Montgomerysâ€™ title.Â  Due to the error, Money First was obligated to repurchase the mortgage from Key Bank.Â  \r\nMoney First commenced a foreclosure action on the mortgage and sought damages against Data Search and Stewart Title for breach of contract as well as negligence.Â  The master bifurcated the matter and issued an order of foreclosure that resulted in a public sale, at which the highest bid was $4,001.Â  Money First received a deficiency judgment of $133,112.54.Â  \r\nThe master found the value of the mobile home and property would be $23,000 had the title been as reported by Data Search.Â  The master further found the value of the mobile home and property with the title as it actually existed to be $4,000.Â  The master ordered Stewart Title to pay Money First damages in the amount of the value of the property as reported, less the actual value of the land, or $19,000.Â  \r\nThe master further found Data Search breached its contract and was negligent in failing to disclose the true status of the Montgomerysâ€™ title, reasoning that Money First relied on Data Searchâ€™s misrepresentations and as a result incurred damages of $133,112.54.Â  The master ordered Data Search to pay that amount as the foreseeable damages resulting from its misrepresentations.Â  Data Search appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA case asserting breach of contract and seeking money damages is an action at law.Â  Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  An appellate court will not disturb the findings of fact of a judge, sitting without a jury in an action at law, unless those findings are without evidentiary support.Â  Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co. of California, 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).[1]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nData Search asserts the master in equity failed to apply the proper measure of damages and thus erred in ordering it to pay damages of $133,112.54.Â  Data Search argues the correct measure of damages is the difference between the fair market value of the property without the title defect and the fair market value of the property with title as it actually existed.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn a breach of contract action, damages serve to place the nonbreaching party in the position he would have enjoyed had the contract been performed.â€Â  South Carolina Fed. Sav. Bank v. Thornton-Crosby Dev. Co., 303 S.C. 74, 77, 399 S.E.2d 8, 10-11 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  Normally damages â€œconsist of two distinct elements:Â  (1) out-of-pocket costs actually incurred as a result of the contract; and (2) the gain above costs that would have been realized had the contract been performed.â€Â  Id. at 11, 399 S.E.2d at 77.\r\nA party proves damages by showing an actual loss that would not have been incurred but for the defendantâ€™s breach of the contract.Â  Drews Co. v. Ledwith-Wolfe Assocs., 296 S.C. 207, 213, 371 S.E.2d 532, 535 (1988).Â  In addition, a plaintiff must demonstrate any loss was a natural and foreseeable consequence of the breach that had been reasonably contemplated by the parties at the time the contract was made.Â  Id.\r\nMoney First contracted with Data Search to determine the extent of the Montgomerysâ€™ interest in the property.Â  Data Search further agreed to act as the closing agent.Â  In that capacity, Data Search was instructed to close the transaction only if the Montgomerys could grant Money First a first mortgage security lien on the property, and on the condition that a policy of title insurance was issued in keeping with the loan commitment.Â  \r\nData Search breached its contractual obligations at numerous points.Â  It erroneously reported the state of the title in the initial title commitment and in the first lien title clearance letter completed after closing.Â  Data Search directed its agent to record the mortgage even after the title examiner advised the company that the Montgomerys only possessed a life estate interest in the land.\r\nData Searchâ€™s principal breach was in failing to notify Money First of the true nature of the title.Â  Data Searchâ€™s actions were to its own benefit, but to Money Firstâ€™s detriment.Â  The record demonstrates Money First would neither have funded the mortgage initially nor been required to repurchase it had Data Search not breached its contractual obligations.Â  \r\nMoney First demonstrated it was foreseeable it would incur the damages awarded by relying on Data Searchâ€™s intentional misrepresentations.Â  Simply put, Money First would not have incurred $133,112.54 in damages but for Data Searchâ€™s breach.Â  Accordingly, the master in equity correctly ordered an amount of damages that placed Money First in the same position it was in before the transaction occurred.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] There is some confusion in the record as to whether this was an action based on negligence or contract.Â  For purposes of this appeal, it makes no difference, for the measure of damages would be the same in either case.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-292","title":"SCE&G v.

Mark Hayes, II, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-292\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2005 â€“ Filed April 21, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nCatherine Derrick Taylor, Francis P. Mood, Dalhi N. Myers, and Sarah P. Spruill, all of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nFred David Butler, Marcus A. Manos, and J. David Black, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This appeal arises from a dispute between South Carolina Electric and Gas (SCE&amp;G) and Aiken Electric Cooperative (Co-op) over the right to serve electricity to a newly constructed school.Â  The South Carolina Public Service Commission (PSC) and circuit court found in favor of the Co-op.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1993, Lexington School District Number 4 acquired a large tract of unimproved property located on Highway 321.Â  This property is within territory assigned to SCE&amp;G for electrical service by the PSC.Â  However, a portion of the property is located within a 300-foot corridor the Co-op is entitled to serve pursuant to section 58-27-620(1)(d)(iii) of the South Carolina CodeÂ  (1977).Â  \r\nIn 1999, the school district decided to build Sandhills School, a combined elementary and intermediate school, on the property.Â  Both SCE&amp;G and the Co-op submitted proposals to provide electrical service to the school.Â  The Co-opâ€™s proposal explained that a portion of the structure needed to be built within the 300-foot corridor in order for it to provide service to the school.Â  The school district accepted the Co-opâ€™s bid and to comply with their request, constructed a storage and maintenance facility within the Co-opâ€™s 300-foot corridor.Â  \r\nThe main building is constructed outside of the 300-foot corridor, and the Co-op did not deliver electricity directly to the storage and maintenance facility within its 300-foot corridor.Â  Rather, in order to comply with sound and safe engineering practices, the Co-op delivered service directly to the main school building and transmitted energy back to the maintenance and storage facility.Â  Â Â \r\nOn May 15, 2000, SCE&amp;G filed a complaint before the PSC arguing that it had the exclusive right to serve the Sandhills School.Â  On May 3, 2002, the PSC approved the Co-opâ€™s provision of service to the school.Â  After SCE&amp;Gâ€™s motion for reconsideration was denied, it appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the PSCâ€™s decision.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe Public Service Commission is recognized as the â€˜expertâ€™ designated by the legislature to make policy determinations regarding utility rates; thus, the role of a court reviewing such decisions is very limited.â€Â  GTE Sprint Communications Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 288 S.C. 174, 179, 341 S.E.2d 126, 128-29&nbsp;(1986).Â  The appellate courts employ â€œa deferential standard of review when reviewing a decision of the Public Service Commission and will affirm that decision when substantial evidence supports it.â€Â  Duke Power Co. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 343 S.C. 554, 558, 541 S.E.2d 250, 252&nbsp;(2001).Â  This court may not substitute its judgment for the commissionâ€™s, especially on questions where there is room for a difference of opinion.Â  Id.Â  â€œBecause the Commissionâ€™s findings are presumptively correct, the party challenging a Commission order bears the burden of convincingly proving the decision is clearly erroneous, or arbitrary or capricious, or an abuse of discretion, in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the PSC is traditionally given, just as any other agency, respectful consideration in their interpretation of a statute.Â  Nucor Steel v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 310 S.C. 539, 543, 426 S.E.2d 319, 321&nbsp;(1992).Â  â€œWhere an agency is charged with the execution of a statute, the agencyâ€™s interpretation should not be overruled without cogent reason.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nSCE&amp;G argues, based on legislative intent and the potential for absurd results, that the only sound reading of section 58-27-610(2) of the South Carolina Code (1977) requires that electricity actually be delivered within the 300-foot corridor.Â  We disagree.\r\nAccording to the plain meaning rule of statutory interpretation, it is not the courtâ€™s place to change the meaning of a clear and unambiguous statute.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581&nbsp;(2000).Â  â€œWhere the statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Id. Â Section 58-27-620(1)(d) of the South Carolina Code (1977) provides:Â  \r\n\r\nWith respect to service in all areas outside the corporate limits of municipalities, electric suppliers shall have rights and be subject to restrictions as follows: (1) Every electric supplier shall have the right to serve: . . . (d) If chosen by the consumer, any premises initially requiring electric service after July 1, 1969, (i) Which are located wholly or partially within three hundred feet of the lines of such electric supplier and also wholly or partially within three hundred feet of the lines of another electric supplier, as each of such supplierâ€™s lines exist on July 1, 1969 or as extended to serve consumers that the supplier has the right to serve or as acquired after July 1, 1969.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\nA plain reading of section 58-27-620 shows it is applicable to the case at hand.Â  The first two requirements are metâ€”the school required service after July 1, 1969 and chose the Co-op.Â  Additionally, the premises are located â€œpartiallyâ€ within 300 feet of the Co-opâ€™s lines.Â  This plain reading is buttressed by the substantial deference afforded the decisions made by agencies entrusted with the task of interpreting statutes.Â  Nucor, 310 S.C. at 545, 426 S.E.2d at 321.Â  The PSC interpreted section 58-27-620 in just this manner in a prior decision.Â  In that case, the PSC ruled, inter alia, that a portico and covered driveway located within 300 feet of an existing line supported the right to provide electrical service to a main hospital and medical building.Â  In re Hartsville H.M.A., Inc., Order No. 98-450 (Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n June 16, 1998).Â  \r\nHowever, SCE&amp;G argues the court must examine the definition of â€œpremises.â€Â  â€œPremisesâ€ is defined in 58-27-610(2) as:Â  \r\n\r\n[T]he building, structure or facility to which electricity is being or is to be furnished; provided, that two or more buildings, structures or facilities which are located on one tract or contiguous tracts of land and are utilized by one electric consumer for farming, business, commercial, industrial, institutional or governmental purposes, shall together constitute one â€˜premises,â€™ except that any such building, structure or facility shall not, together with any other building, structure or facility, constitute one â€œpremisesâ€ if the electric service to it is separately metered and the charges for such service are calculated independently of charges for service to any other building, structure or facility.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\nSpecifically, SCE&amp;G argues the phrase â€œto which electricity is being or is to be furnishedâ€ is not precisely defined.Â  They argue two interpretations existâ€”that the electricity be â€œultimately providedâ€ or alternatively â€œactually deliveredâ€ to a building within the electric supplierâ€™s assigned territory.Â  SCE&amp;G suggests the Co-opâ€™s argument is that the statute merely requires an electric supplier to â€œultimately provideâ€ electricity to a building at least partially within its 300-foot corridor.Â  \r\nSCE&amp;G urges the adoption of the â€œactual deliveryâ€ interpretation and supports its argument with potential scenarios regarding provider overreach.Â  However, section 58-27-620 specifically addresses the right of a provider to supply a premises if it is â€œlocated wholly or partiallyâ€ within the corridor.Â  Section 58-27-610 also broadly defines â€œpremisesâ€ so that it can include more than one building and more than one tract of land.Â  This language demonstrates the legislatureâ€™s intention to read this exception and the underlying term broadly.Â  Thus, it is logical to conclude that this broad legislative intent should be extended to the phrase â€œto which electricity is being or is to be furnished,â€ especially when we give an agency substantial deference in its interpretation of a statute.Â  \r\nSCE&amp;G also argues the intent of the legislation was to avoid higher costs and duplication of infrastructure.Â  While the Co-op has upgraded its lines to provide service to the school and also constructed new lines outside of its corridor in order to serve the school, we do not find that the statute prohibits these activities if they are undertaken to serve a premises the Co-op is entitled to serve under section 58-27-620. \r\nFinally, SCE&amp;G argues the PSCâ€™s interpretation of section 58-27-620 could lead to absurd results.Â  It uses an apartment complex example to illustrate this contention.Â  SCE&amp;G contends it would allow the Co-op to deliver power to a master-metered apartment complex outside its service territory if some power was routed back to a security station at the apartmentâ€™s entrance, which was within the Co-opâ€™s service area.Â  However, this broad reading of section 58-27-620 is checked by the definition of â€œpremises.â€Â  That definition states no building or group of buildings can constitute a single premises, â€œif the electric service to it is separately metered and the charges for such service are calculated independently of charges for service to any other building, structure or facility.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-610(2) (1977).Â  This would prevent an apartment complex from being only partially located within the corridor because it would be unusual if the buildings were not separately metered and the charges calculated independently.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the circuit courtâ€™s ruling is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., WILLIAMS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-293","title":"SCDSS v.

[2]   \r\nThe family court held a final hearing on January 21, 2003.Â  By order dated February 17, 2003, the family court terminated Normanâ€™s parental rights pursuant to South Carolina Code section 20-7-1572(2) because she was not able to remedy within a reasonable period of time the conditions prompting the childrenâ€™s removal.[3]Â  Norman filed a timely motion to alter or amend the judgment, which the family court denied.&nbsp;\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nNorman alleges the family court erred in finding there was clear and convincing evidence that she failed to remedy the conditions warranting the removal of Justin and Justice.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 20-7-1572 allows the family court to terminate parental rights upon a finding of one or more of several enumerated grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child.[4]Â  Section 20-7-1572(2) permits termination if:\r\n\r\nThe child has been removed from the parent pursuant to Section 20-7-610 or Section 20-7-736, has been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan by court order or by agreement between the department and the parent, and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal.[5]\r\n\r\nThe family court found â€œthe minor children have lived outside the residence of their mother . . . since September 12, 2001.â€Â  The family court based removal of Justice and Justin from Normanâ€™s care on physical neglect and the threat of harm to the children.Â  Moreover, the family court found â€œthe home of [Norman] cannot be made appropriate within a reasonable length of time despite reasonable and meaningful efforts on the part of [DSS] to offer appropriate rehabilitat[ive] services.â€Â  Accordingly, the family court held â€œbecause [Norman] has not been able to remedy conditions which made removal necessary, the Court finds that termination of her parental rights is authorized pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2).â€Â  \r\nWe agree with the family courtâ€™s termination of Normanâ€™s parental rights and will not substitute our judgment for that of the family court, which was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.[6]Â  Moreover, the evidence at the termination hearing supports the family courtâ€™s finding that Norman was unable to make her home appropriate within a reasonable length of time despite reasonable and meaningful attempts by DSS to provide assistance.\r\nThe children were in the custody of DSS for the sixteen months before the final hearing.Â  Sandy Polk, a foster care supervisor with DSS, testified that none of Normanâ€™s seven children were in her physical custody when this case came to trial.Â  All the children had been placed with new families or were in foster care.[7]Â  In describing her concern about Normanâ€™s parenting skills, Polk related a incident occurring while Norman was visiting with one of her other children during which the child placed a screw in his mouth and Norman attempted to extricate it with a coat hanger.Â  In addition, Normanâ€™s husband testified he had a friend stay with Norman 75 per cent of the time to help her manage her children when they were in her care.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Norman has a nomadic history, moving as often as fifteen times to live with either family or friends.Â  Immediately prior to the termination hearing, Norman and her husband faced eviction from their home and, as a result, voluntarily surrendered two other children to DSS.Â  Norman often failed to cooperate with DSS by moving from residence to residence and failing to notify DSS of her relocations.Â  Although Normanâ€™s present husband provided some measure of stability, it is undisputed that, shortly before the hearing, both he and Norman were arrested for criminal domestic violence following an altercation between them.Â  \r\nPolk further testified Norman had a history of mental health problems stemming from diagnoses of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.[8]Â  Although Polk acknowledged that Norman had been treated for this problem, Polk further stated that Norman was following through with the treatment only â€œinconsistently.â€Â  When pressed to answer whether she felt that Normanâ€™s condition had improved to the point where she would no longer be a threat to the children, Polk replied only that, although she hoped that was the case, she could not provide assurance that Norman would not be a danger to her children.Â  In response to a question from Normanâ€™s attorney as to whether Normanâ€™s home could be made safe within twelve months, Polk replied that it could be an â€œinnumerable amount of monthsâ€ and that â€œthe parents are no more stable today, as I sit here, to take these children than they were when they were removed.â€\r\nConsidering the foregoing in view of the time the children have spent in foster care, we affirm the family courtâ€™s termination of Normanâ€™s parental rights to Justin and Justice pursuant to South Carolina Code section 20-7-1572(2).Â  We nevertheless take this opportunity to extend our gratitude to Normanâ€™s counsel for his vigorous efforts on behalf of his court-appointed client during both the family court proceedings and this appeal.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in deciding the issue on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The complaint also alleged failure to visit and failure to support as grounds for termination; however, DSS acknowledged at the final hearing that Norman had exercised visitation and provided support according to her means.Â  \r\n[3] The family court also terminated the parental rights of Maurice Carter.Â  Carter did not appeal the termination.\r\n[4]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2004).Â  In her brief, Norman challenges only the finding that she had not remedied the conditions that prompted the removal of the children.\r\n[5]Â  Id. Â§ 20-7-1572(2).\r\n[6]Â  See Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct.

Dâ€™Agostino, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this divorce action, Larry Mabe (Husband) appeals the inclusion of certain assets in the marital estate, the apportionment of the marital property, the grant of alimony to Dorothy Mabe (Wife), and the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married in 1983 and separated in 2000.Â  Both parties had been married previously.Â  Wife was 65 years old and Husband was 62 at the time of trial.Â  Both parties are currently disabled and on fixed incomes.Â  Husbandâ€™s gross monthly income is $1,302.00 and Wifeâ€™s gross monthly income is $559.00.Â  They do not have any children together. \r\nAt the time of the marriage, Wife owned a 1979 Pontiac Sunbird and some clothes.Â  About a year later, Wife received approximately $17,000.00 from the sale of the marital home from her first marriage.Â  Wife invested the money in annuities and listed Husband as the beneficiary.Â  \r\nHusband and Wife moved into a house Husband owned in Clover, South Carolina.Â  At the time of the marriage, Husband also owned real property in Belmont, North Carolina, and York County, South Carolina, as well as several vehicles, a 401-K pension plan, and a tax-deferred savings plan through his employer, General Electric.Â  \r\nAfter Wife received the sales proceeds from her former home, the parties signed an â€œAgreementâ€ regarding their property.Â  The agreement recited that their respective assets were separately owned and stated that their â€œagreement now is that whatâ€™s hers will be hers, and whatâ€™s his will continue to be his.â€Â  Although both parties signed the agreement voluntarily, neither party sought independent legal advice and a single attorney prepared the document.Â  \r\nThe couple subsequently moved to a home Husband owned debt-free in Belmont, North Carolina.Â  They renovated the home, and Wife helped with painting, putting up paneling, and installing insulation.Â  Wife also worked in the yard.Â  Husband was the primary wage earner, bringing in 91.32 per cent of the coupleâ€™s income during the course of the marriage.Â  \r\nHusband eventually sold everything except a 1977 Ford Truck, a 1969 Chevrolet Nova, and an acre of land with a garage on it.Â  Husband and Wife had a joint checking account together.Â  When Husband sold one of his properties, he deposited the proceeds into the joint checking account and he and Wife â€œenjoyed the money together.â€Â  When the parties sold the marital home in Belmont, they used the proceeds, along with the proceeds of several other investments, on a truck and camper.Â  The couple lived in the camper and traveled together.Â  The camper was titled in Husbandâ€™s name, but Wife believed the parties owned it together.Â  \r\nLater, Husband and Wife returned to Clover, where they built a garage apartment.Â  Wife helped with the construction.Â  The parties lost most of their assets through bad investments.Â  They also spent some of the money.Â  \r\nHusband left Wife one day while she was at church.Â  Husband took the truck and camper, leaving Wife with only her car.Â  Wife was forced to go live with her daughter.Â  Husband allowed Wife to retrieve her personal belongings from the camper thirty days later with a police escort.Â  Husband later changed the locks.Â  Husband testified he left because Wifeâ€™s daughter was addicted to drugs and sometimes homeless or in prison for extended periods, obligating Wife and Husband to care for Wifeâ€™s daughter and her children.Â  \r\nAfter Husband left, Wife filed for divorce.Â  Husband refused to accept service, and subsequently served divorce papers on Wife from Tennessee.Â  Wife hired an attorney in Tennessee and incurred $660.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees to obtain a dismissal of that action.Â  Husband then filed an answer and counterclaim to Wifeâ€™s action. Â \r\nThe family court issued a temporary order in which Husband was ordered to pay $350.00 per month for spousal support.Â  Husband subsequently dropped insurance coverage on the camper, and the camper was apparently stolen shortly thereafter.Â  Husband then went to live in the garage apartment. \r\nAfter a trial on the merits, the family court issued an order granting the divorce and awarding $250.00 per month in permanent periodic alimony to Wife, making an equitable distribution of the marital property, and awarding Wife $4,500.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Husband argues the agreement he and Wife signed shortly after they married and their actions during their marriage â€œprove an intent to maintain the separate property of each.â€Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nProperty may be excluded from the marital estate by written contract executed either before or after the marriage.[2]Â  To be presumed fair and equitable, however, a contract must meet several requirements.Â  The parties must have executed the contract voluntarily, with both parties represented by separate counsel.[3]Â  Additionally, full financial disclosure must be provided to each party, including information as to income, debts, and assets.[4]Â  \r\nWe agree with the family courtâ€™s finding that the agreement in this case did not meet these requirements.Â  It is undisputed the parties were not separately represented by counsel.Â  Moreover, although Husband alleged on appeal that both parties were aware of each otherâ€™s assets, Wife testified that neither party made any financial disclosure.Â  In our view, then, the family court correctly determined that the agreement only evidenced the partiesâ€™ intent to keep their non-marital property separate and did not address the ownership of property acquired during the marriage after the execution of the agreement. \r\nWe further agree with Wifeâ€™s argument that, notwithstanding the partiesâ€™ intent about their separate property when they signed the agreement, their combined actions and conduct throughout the marriage evidenced a different intent.[5]Â  \r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in finding the proceeds from the sale of his non-marital assets became transmuted simply by placement into the joint banking account.Â  We, however, do not interpret the appealed order to make this finding; rather, the family court determined these funds lost their non-marital character not only because they were deposited into the joint account into which Wife deposited her earnings, but also because they were co-mingled with marital funds and because Husband was unable to strictly account for them.Â  We find no error in this conclusion.[6]\r\nWhen the Clover property was sold, part of the proceeds went to renovate the Belmont property, where the couple lived for some time.Â  Wife helped with the renovation efforts.Â  Some of the proceeds went toward the purchase of the garage package and generator, which the parties used in support of the marriage.Â  Again, Wife helped with the construction efforts.Â  Additional proceeds went into an account with Fortis Investors; however, the Fortis account was also funded with money from the joint checking account, to which both parties had access and which both parties used.Â  Finally, Husband acknowledged that he and Wife simply spent a part of the proceeds of the Clover property.Â  \r\nThe proceeds of the sale of the Belmont home were likewise untraceable.Â  Some of the proceeds were invested in the Briar Cliff RV Resort and later used to purchase the camper and truck as well as the kit to build the garage apartment.Â  Although the camper was acquired partly through the trade-in of non-marital property belonging to Husband, we hold the record supports the family courtâ€™s finding that the truck and camper were marital property.Â  Husband and Wife purchased the camper for their joint use.Â  Some of Wifeâ€™s disability income was used toward the purchase, and Wife testified she understood that they were buying it jointly.Â  The truck was used to haul the camper and for other marital purposes.Â  Even Husband admitted that â€œwe went truck shopping.â€Â  The parties lived in the camper for some time and traveled extensively.Â  \r\nWhen Husband sold the nine-acre parcel in York County, he provided the financing to the buyer at twelve per cent interest.Â  Husband admitted that he and Wife enjoyed the proceeds together.Â  \r\nHusband also had substantial assets in the form of a General Electric savings plan.Â  To the extent contributions were made during the marriage, these funds were marital property.[7]Â  From this, Husband invested a substantial amount with Alliance Leasing.Â  When Alliance Leasing went bankrupt, Husband received approximately $53,000.00, which he placed into a Wachovia account in his name.Â  Wife also separately invested her own funds with Alliance leasing, from which she got back only about $600.00.Â  When the parties divorced, only $32,000.00 remained in this account.Â  The family court found that Husband had not met his burden of showing the extent to which funds from the account constituted non-marital property.Â  We concur.Â  Nothing in the record provides information necessary to make such a determination. \r\nHusband further argues that the family court should not have held him accountable for the loss of the camper.Â  We find no error.Â  The temporary order enjoined both parties from â€œdisposing of, conveying out, transferring, secreting, or hiding any marital assets.â€Â  After the temporary order, husband cancelled the insurance on the camper.Â  Husband testified that shortly thereafter, the camper was stolen and he received no insurance proceeds from the loss.Â  We see no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s decision.Â  It would be inequitable to punish Wife for Husbandâ€™s failure to maintain the insurance policy, particularly when, as here, Husband took the camper when he left the marriage, resulting in Wife having no place no live.[8]  \r\n2.Â  Husband next argues that, because he made most of the monetary contributions, the family court erred in awarding Wife 35 per cent of the marital estate.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s apportionment of the marital estate.[9]\r\nHere, the family court in this case recited that it considered all the statutory factors regarding equitable apportionment found.Â  Although Husband made the most of the monetary contributions to the marital estate, Wife made significant indirect contributions, assisting with both the Clover renovation and construction of the garage apartment and doing yard work and painting.Â  Furthermore, the marriage was fairly long in duration, Wife now has the lesser earning capacity, and Husbandâ€™s actions directly contributed to the breakup of the marriage.Â  We find no abuse of discretion. \r\n3.Â  Husbandâ€™s next contention is that the family court should not have awarded Wife alimony of $250.00 per month.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.[10]  \r\nThe marriage lasted 18 years, a relatively long duration. Wife is now disabled and in her sixties.Â  Additionally, Wife suffered emotionally due to the breakup of the marriage.Â  \r\nAlthough Husband is also disabled, his income is higher than hers.Â  Both parties are on fixed incomes.Â  Wifeâ€™s education and prior work experience are limited; therefore, training is unlikely to improve her earning potential.Â  In addition, Husband received 65 per cent of the marital estate in the equitable distribution.\r\nAlthough the standard of living during the marriage was in dispute, Wife testified that they had â€œa good life standard of livingâ€ without financial problems, and Husband admitted they enjoyed money from the sale of his investments.Â  \r\nConsidering the foregoing, we hold the award of alimony to Wife in the amount of $250.00 per month was within the family courtâ€™s discretion.\r\n4.Â  We reject Husbandâ€™s argument that the family court erred in awarding Wife attorneyâ€™s fees she incurred to defend the divorce action he filed in Tennessee.\r\nThe family court has no jurisdiction to award attorneyâ€™s fees for actions brought in another court.[11]Â  Nevertheless, under South Carolina Code section 20-3-130(H), the family court has the authority to â€œorder one party to pay a reasonable amount to the other for attorney fees, expert fees, investigation fees, costs, and suit money incurred in maintaining an action for divorce from the bonds of matrimony.â€[12]\r\nIn our view, the family court acted properly in requiring Husband to reimburse Wife for attorneyâ€™s fees she incurred as a result the Tennessee lawsuit.Â  Here, the fees in dispute were awarded at the temporary hearing upon a finding by the family court that Husbandâ€™s actions â€œnecessitated the Plaintiff having to hire an attorney in Tennessee to get an action dismissed.â€Â  After Wife filed for divorce in South Carolina, Husband evaded service, went to Tennessee, where he apparently had no prior contacts, and attempted to commence a separate divorce action there by making questionable assertions that he was a â€œbona fide resident of Jefferson County, Tennessee,â€ and that â€œthe acts complained of were committed while Husband was a resident of Jefferson County, Tennessee.â€Â  Given the possibility that Wifeâ€™s South Carolina action could have been halted because an action between the parties regarding the same matters was pending in another court,[13] we hold the reimbursement to Wife of the fees she incurred to have this other action dismissed was properly granted as a â€œcostâ€ necessarily incurred in maintaining the present case.\r\n5.Â  Husband also challenges the amount of the attorneyâ€™s fees award.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.[14]Â  The family court awarded $4,500.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wifeâ€™s attorney submitted an affidavit of fees and costs of $3,230.34, including 22.30 hours of work and costs in the amount of $898.34.Â  Wife conceded that this amount also includes charges incurred at the temporary hearing, in which Wife was awarded attorneyâ€™s fees of $500.00; however, Husband acknowledged he never paid the fees awarded in the temporary hearing.Â  The attorneyâ€™s fees awarded for the hiring and communications with the Tennessee attorney totaled $660.00.Â  In addition, trial time was not included in Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fee affidavit.Â  The family court expressly recited each of the required factors in the appealed order[15] and emphasized Wifeâ€™s success in receiving alimony as well as an equitable interest in the marital property.Â  Under these circumstances, we affirm the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  See Bailey v.

Drew, Jr., Master-in-equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-295\r\nSubmitted April 1, 2005 â€“ Filed April 25, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDaniel L. Draisen, of Anderson, for Appellant.\r\nGeorge P. Sullivan and David J. Brousseau, all of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:&nbsp; Edwin E. Middlebrook appeals from an order by a master-in-equity approving a sales contract for real property owned by tenants in common, each of whom received his or her ownership interest in the property through inheritance.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHenry Anderson died intestate in 1945 leaving approximately thirty-three acres of real property located in Anderson County, South Carolina.Â  The real property passed by intestate succession to Henryâ€™s heirs as tenants in common.Â  \r\nHenry was survived by his wife, Carrie Anderson, eight children, one grandchild of a predeceased daughter, and two grandchildren of a predeceased son.Â  Carrie died in 1971.Â  After Carrieâ€™s death, Alvin Anderson, a son of Henry, petitioned for and received letters of administration for Henryâ€™s estate.Â  Publication for a final settlement of the estate was accomplished in 1983 and 1984, but a final settlement was never actually achieved.Â  In 1989, Alvin died, and Willie Anderson, another son of Henry, was named personal representative.Â  When Willie died in 1993, the estate was still not finally settled and no substitute personal representative was ever named.Â  \r\nSince the death of Carrie, the eight children have died, each leaving multiple heirs.Â  In fact, the number of co-tenants of the thirty-three acres, Henryâ€™s sole asset at death, has grown to a total of sixty-nine.Â  In the time since Willieâ€™s death, Edna Evans, a granddaughter of Henry and one of a handful of relatives still living in Anderson, looked after the property, and has coordinated the paying of taxes on it.Â  She did this by calling the oldest relative from each part of the family and asking him or her to pay a portion of the taxes.Â  According to Evans, some would not pay and she would make up any shortfall.Â  In 1997, Evans had the timber cut on the property and used the timber funds to pay the property taxes.Â  At the date of the hearing, only $310 remained from the timber funds, and the expected taxes were in excess of $1,000.Â  \r\nEvans sought court approval to sell the property to third parties whom she contracted with in 1997.Â  The sale was specifically conditioned on court approval.Â  Evans filed a complaint asking the court to determine the â€œtrue owners as tenants in commonâ€ of the property and to order the sale of the property according to the contract for sale.Â  \r\nEdwin Middlebrook, one of the co-tenants, challenged the request for court approval of the sale of the property.Â  Middlebrookâ€™s answer asked the court to determine the identity of the co-tenants and the interests of each, and requested the property first be offered to the tenants in common at private auction before approval of the contract for sale.Â  At trial, all parties stipulated to the determination of heirs as alleged in Evansâ€™s complaint.Â  Middlebrook admitted he learned of the property in approximately 2001 when he received a letter from Evans discussing the sale of the property.Â  At trial, Middlebrook offered to pay $60,000 for the property in order to keep it in the family and stated he would be willing to pay more, suggesting he would match the highest price.Â  Middlebrook admitted $60,000 was a fair price for the property.Â  \r\nThe master-in-equity found the contract should be approved, and the property sold for $60,000 in accord with the contract between Evans and the third parties.Â  Additionally, the court ordered the proceeds divided according to the heirsâ€™ ownership interests in the property.Â  Middlebrook appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA partition action is an equitable action, heard by a judge alone and, as such, this Court on review may find facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Anderson v.

App. 1996) (finding an action to quiet title and partition property, where father died intestate and there was no indication that property was probated, to be an action in equity).Â  However, we are not required to disregard the findings of the master.Â  Freeman, 323 S.C. at 98, 473 S.E.2d at 469.Â  â€œNor are we required to ignore the fact that the master, who saw and heard the witnesses, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility.â€Â  Id. at 98, 473 S.E.2d at 470.\r\nLAW AND DISCUSSION\r\nMiddlebrook alleges three errors by the master-in-equity.Â  First, he argues the master did not have subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Second, he asserts the master erred in finding a sales contract when Evans did not first seek and receive an order from the probate court to sell the property.Â  Third, he argues the master erred by upholding the contract for sale with the third parties when an heir was willing to purchase the property for the same price. \r\n1.Â  Subject matter jurisdiction\r\nMiddlebrook argues section 62-1-302 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) controls and vests the probate court with exclusive original subject matter jurisdiction thereby rendering the master-in-equity without jurisdiction in this case.Â  We disagree.[1]  \r\nSection 62-1-302 provides:\r\n\r\nTo the full extent permitted by the Constitution, and except as otherwise specifically provided, the probate court has exclusive original jurisdiction over all subject matter related to: (1) estates of decedents, including the contest of wills, construction of wills, and determination of heirs and successors of decedents and estates of protected persons . . . .\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  \r\nIn this case, the master was not asked to determine the heirs and successors of Henry Anderson.Â  In fact, all the parties stipulated to the determination of the heirs as alleged in Evansâ€™s complaint.Â  Rather, the master relied on the subject matter jurisdiction granted by section 15-61-50 of the South Carolina Code (1976).Â  This section states, â€œThe court of common pleas has jurisdiction in all cases of real and personal estates held in joint tenancy or in common to make partition in kind or by allotment . . . .â€Â  See also Eichor v. Eichor, 290 S.C. 484, 487, 351 S.E.2d 353, 354&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986). \r\nTherefore, we find the master had subject matter jurisdiction over the present case pursuant to section 15-61-50.Â  \r\n2.Â  Failure to obtain an order of sale from the probate court \r\nMiddlebrook argues the master-in-equity erred in upholding the contract between Evans and the third parties because Evans did not first obtain an order of sale from the probate court.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nMiddlebrook argues certain sections of the probate code require an order of sale from the probate court before a sales contract for estate property can be entered.Â  He relies on sections 62-3-711, 62-3-911, and 62-3-1301 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004).Â  However, we find these sections are inapplicable to this case.Â  \r\nSection 62-3-711 (b) provides, â€œExcept where the will of the decedent authorizes to the contrary, a personal representative may not sell real property of the estate except as authorized pursuant to the procedure described in Section 62-3-1301 et seq. . . . .â€Â  In this case, the actions complained of were not taken by the personal representative.Â  Additionally, Evans entered into the contract conditioned upon court approval, which was granted.Â  Thus, this section does not require an order of sale from the probate court prior to the sale of the property.\r\nSection 62-3-911 provides the probate court the power to partition property either in kind or by sale.Â  It specifically states:Â  \r\n\r\nWhen two or more heirs or devisees are entitled to distribution of undivided interests in any personal or real property of the estate, the personal representative or one or more of the heirs or devisees may petition the court prior to the closing of the estate, to make partition. After notice to the interested heirs or devisees, the court shall partition the property in kind if it can be fairly and equitably partitioned in kind. If not subject to fair and equitable partition in kind, the court shall direct the personal representative to sell the property and distribute the proceeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Embracing Middlebrookâ€™s position would require us to find this provision negates the power of the circuit court to hear cases involving partition of real property in an estate.Â  See S.C. Code Â§ 15-61-50 (1976).Â  However, â€œrepeal by implication is disfavored, and is found only when two statutes are incapable of any reasonable reconcilement.â€Â  See, e.g., Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Natâ€™l Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 558, 462 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1995).Â  Accordingly, we interpret section 62-3-911 as providing the probate court with tools necessary to effectively handle an estate, not granting it the exclusive ability to partition property held by co-tenants who received the property through an estate.Â  Therefore, we find this section does not require an order of sale from the probate court.\r\nFinally, Middlebrook argues section 62-3-1301 prevents the master from upholding the sale of the property because it states: â€œThe provisions of this Part are herby declared to be the only procedure for the sale of lands by the court, except where the will of the decedent authorizes to the contrary.â€Â Â  First, this section concerns powers of the probate court.Â  Because we found the master properly has jurisdiction to partition the property, this section is inapplicable.Â  Additionally, the heading just above section 62-3-1301 explains that it provides a mechanism to allow for the â€œ[s]ale of real estate by probate court to pay debts.â€Â  See Lindsay v. Southern Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co.,&nbsp; 258 S.C. 272, 277, 188 S.E.2d 374, 376&nbsp;(1972) (allowing reference to the title of an act to determine legislative intent).Â  Preservation of the property to pay estate debts is not an issue in this case.Â  Henry Anderson died in 1945 and based on articles of publication run in area newspapers in 1971, 1983, and 1984, it does not appear his estate has any outstanding debts.\r\nBecause the sections Middlebrook seeks to rely on are inapplicable, we find the master did not err by upholding the validity of the sales contract.\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Sale of the property to a third party rather than an heir \r\nMiddlebrook argues the master erred in upholding a contract with the third parties when an heir was willing to purchase the property for the price offered by the third parties.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[A] court of equity may allocate a portion of the property under partition to one or more heirs while disposing of the remainder by sale.Â  Nevertheless, the division must be fair to all of the co-tenants.â€Â  Pinckney v. Atkins, 317 S.C. 340, 345, 454 S.E.2d 339, 342&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nSection 15-61-50 specifies: \r\n\r\nThe court of common pleas has jurisdiction in all cases of real and personal estates held in joint tenancy or in common to make partition in kind or by allotment to one or more of the parties upon their accounting to the other parties in interest for their respective shares or, in case partition in kind or by allotment cannot be fairly and impartially made and without injury to any of the parties in interest, by the sale of the property and the division of the proceeds according to the rights of the parties.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  This section does not specify a sale must be public or that property must first be offered to the heirs.Â  In Pruitt v. Pruitt, 298 S.C. 411, 414, 380 S.E.2d 862, 864&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1989), we stated that â€œthe disparate testimony as to the value of the subject property requires partition by public sale, which will afford each party an opportunity to back her own judgment of value by bidding for the interest of the other.â€Â  In this case, Middlebrook agreed that $60,000 was a fair price for the property.Â  Additionally, the price was supported by the testimony of two certified real estate appraisers.Â  \r\nMiddlebrook apparently is motivated by a desire to keep the property in the family.Â  However, he had ample opportunity to act upon this desire prior to the hearing.Â  Moreover, he never presented a firm offer beyond promising the contract price and â€œmore, depending on what the price is.â€Â  Accordingly, we find the master did not err in upholding the sales contract with the third parties.Â Â  \r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the order of the master-in-equity is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We recognize Middlebrookâ€™s claim that the master lacked subject matter jurisdiction can be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  See, e.g., Simmons v. Bellamy, 349 S.C. 473, 476, 562 S.E.2d 687, 689&nbsp;(Ct.

Mathison, Jr., of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.\r\nR. Nicholas Felix and Terry A. Finger, both of Hilton Head Island, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Shamrock Entertainment Corp., Inc., appeals from the decision of the trial court finding The Beach Market, L.L.C., had the right to place restrictions on Shamrockâ€™s use of common areas in the shopping center owned by Beach Market and in which Shamrock was a tenant.Â  Additionally, Shamrock appeals the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Beach Market and Lara Development Company, Inc., the denial of its injunction prohibiting the restrictions, and the finding it breached the lease.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nShamrock operates Hincheyâ€™s Chicago Bar and Grill, and has been the tenant under a commercial lease in a shopping center in Hilton Head since 1996.Â  Lara Development was the original landlord.Â  Lara Development allowed Shamrock to purchase outdoor furniture and to operate a seating area on the concrete plaza adjoining the buildings comprising the shopping center.Â  Shamrock served food and beverages, including alcoholic beverages, to patrons seated in the plaza.\r\nLara Development sold the shopping center to Beach Market, L.L.C. in 1999.Â  In the spring of 2000, Bruce Kimball, a fifty-percent owner of Beach Market, became concerned regarding excessive trash and noise occurring on the plaza late at night.Â  Beach Market sought to restrict the consumption of alcohol and other uses of the plaza.Â  Beach Market placed signs in the plaza specifically restricting the consumption of alcohol in the evenings.Â  Subsequently, Beach Market propagated and disseminated rules and regulations related to the use of the plaza as well as the sale of food and beverages.Â  \r\nIn July 2000, Beach Market applied in magistrateâ€™s court for the ejectment of Shamrock, alleging Shamrock was in default of the lease.Â  Shamrock instituted this declaratory judgment action, claiming the lease allowed the use of the plaza, or in the alternative the lease was modified to allow the use of the plaza.Â  Shamrock sought a temporary restraining order and injunction prohibiting the enforcement of Beach Marketâ€™s rules.Â  \r\nAfter the magistrateâ€™s court action was dismissed, Beach Market answered and asserted there was no provision in the lease allowing the use of the plaza.Â  It sought to eject Shamrock because of the unauthorized use of the plaza. Â Lara Development also answered, denying Shamrockâ€™s allegations.Â  In reply to Beach Marketâ€™s counterclaim for breach of the lease, Shamrock asserted that even if its right to use the plaza was not included in the lease, Beach Market waived its right to prohibit or restrict the use of the plaza.Â Â  \r\nLara Development was granted an involuntary non-suit as to any claims alleged by Shamrock.Â  The trial court denied Shamrockâ€™s request for an injunction and denied Beach Marketâ€™s request for an eviction.Â  The court found the lease did not allow the use of the plaza, either originally or through a modification.Â  The court held Beach Market retained the right to place reasonable restrictions on the use of the plaza and had not waived that right.Â  It concluded Beach Marketâ€™s prohibition of alcohol consumption on the Plaza after 11:00 p.m. was reasonable.Â  Finally, the court awarded Beach Market and Lara Development attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  After the denial of Shamrockâ€™s motion for reconsideration, this appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  This is ultimately an action to determine the partiesâ€™ rights under the lease.Â  Therefore, the action is one at law.Â  See eg., Pruitt v. South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 343 S.C. 335, 339, 540 S.E.2d 843, 845 (2001) (stating an action to construe a contract is an action at law); Skull Creek Club Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Cook and Book, Inc., 313 S.C. 283, 286-87, 437 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Additionally, an action for an ejectment is an action at law.Â  Skull Creek, 313 S.C. at 286, 437 S.E.2d at 165.Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Terms of Lease\r\nShamrock contends the lease provides for its use of the plaza to serve food and beverages.Â  Additionally, Shamrock maintains the lease was ambiguous and should be read to include the use of the plaza.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn construing a contract, the primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties as determined by the contractâ€™s language.Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003).Â  If its language is plain, unambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable interpretation, that language alone determines the instrumentâ€™s force and effect.Â  Jordan v. Security Group, Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993).\r\nThe lease included the following relevant provisions.\r\n\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Leased Premises.Â  Landlord hereby leases to Tenant . . . Units 101, 102, and 103-B, The Beach Market . . . [t]he Leased Premises are depicted on the attached plan of Beach Market.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Permitted Use of the Leased Premises.Â  Tenant shall use and occupy the Leased Premises for the operation of a full service restaurant, including the sale of beer, wine and alcoholic beverages, subject to the terms and conditions in this Lease, and for all such uses as may be customarily incidental to Tenantâ€™s business. . . . Tenant shall have the exclusive right to sell alcoholic beverages, excluding beer, wine and low-alcohol drinks for on-premises consumption at The Beach Market.Â  \r\n\r\nAt oral argument, Shamrockâ€™s counsel conceded that the definition of â€œLeased Premisesâ€ does not include the plaza.Â  However, it contends the second paragraph provides it authority to sell food and beverages for consumption on the plaza, as that is an activity that is â€œincidental to Tenantâ€™s business.â€Â  We disagree and find a proper reading of paragraph two expressly limits it to the â€œLeased Premises.â€Â  Nothing in this paragraph can be read to allow Shamrock the use of the plaza when the paragraph begins:Â  â€œTenant shall use and occupy the Leased Premisesâ€ and does not include the plaza.Â  Furthermore, the last sentence granting Shamrock the exclusive right to sell alcoholic beverages for â€œon-premisesâ€ consumption does not provide it with authority to utilize the plaza to conduct its business without being restricted by the propertyâ€™s owner.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly determined the lease did not grant Shamrock the right to use the plaza for the operation of its business.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Modification of Lease\r\nShamrock argues Lara Development modified the lease by allowing Shamrock to use the plaza to conduct business and by allowing Shamrock to provide outdoor furniture for use on the plaza.Â  We disagree and find there was no modification of the lease.\r\nâ€œIt is well established that â€˜[a] written contract may be modified by a subsequent agreement of the parties, provided the subsequent agreement contains all the requisites of a valid contract.â€™Â  The necessary elements of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration.â€Â \r\nSauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 405-06, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003) (citation omitted).Â  In addition, \r\n\r\n[i]t is well settled in South Carolina that in order for there to be a binding contract between parties, there must be a mutual manifestation of assent to the terms.Â  Furthermore, the assent must be as to all of the terms of the contract.Â  Some terms are considered indispensable to a binding contract.Â  Among these are price, time and place.Â Â  \r\n\r\nEdens v. Laurel Hill, Inc., 271 S.C. 360, 364, 247 S.E.2d 434, 436 (1978) (citations omitted).\r\nâ€œWhen the existence of a contract is questioned and the evidence either conflicts or gives rise to more than one inference, the issue of the contractâ€™s existence becomes a question for the finder of fact.â€Â  Sherman v. W&amp;B Enterprises, 357 S.C. 243, 250, 592 S.E.2d 307, 310 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nWe find the evidence is susceptible to more than one inference as to Lara Development and Shamrockâ€™s mutual assent to the terms of a modification.Â  The record supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that the parties did not intend a modification of the lease to grant Shamrock a leasehold interest in the plaza, which would allow Shamrock unlimited use of the plaza twenty-four hours a day.Â  While Lara Development may have consented to Shamrockâ€™s use of the plaza for food and beverage service during normal restaurant hours, it denied any modification of the lease.Â  Furthermore, there was no additional consideration provided for the right to use the plaza.Â  Shamrock contends the additional business brought in constituted consideration.Â  However, this is speculative at best and there is no indication in the record indicating there was additional business brought into the shopping center.Â  Shamrock did not pay for the right to use the plaza, nor did it offer anything of value to Lara Development.[1]Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s finding that there was no modification of the lease. \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Estoppel and Waiver of Ownerâ€™s Rights\r\nShamrock argues the trial court erred in finding Lara Development and, subsequently, Beach Market did not waive their right to place restrictions on the use of the plaza.Â  It also contends Beach Market should be estopped from placing restrictions on the use of the plaza.Â  We find Beach Market retained the right to place restrictions on the property it owned which was not leased to Shamrock. \r\nWaiver is a question of fact for the finder of fact.Â  Parker v. Parker, 313 S.C. 482, 487, 443 S.E.2d 384, 391 (1994). Waiver is a voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a known right.Â  Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horiz. Prop.Â  Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 388 (1992).Â  A party is not necessarily barred from enforcing a right where a previous deviation from its rights has been allowed.Â  Rabon v. Mali, 289 S.C. 37, 40, 344 S.E.2d 608, 610 (1986).Â  A partyâ€™s waiver of the right to object to a minor violation of its rights does not result in waiver of the right to object to a subsequent and more substantial violation.Â  Gibbs v. Kimbrell, 311 S.C. 261, 268, 428 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nEstoppel applies when a party, relying upon what another has said or done, changes its position to its detriment.Â  Id.Â  In addition, estoppel applies â€œwhen a party observes another dealing with his property in a manner inconsistent with his rights and makes no objection while the other changes his position in reliance on the partyâ€™s silence; the partyâ€™s silence is acquiescence that estops him from later seeking relief.â€Â \r\nId.Â  \r\nâ€œA tenant has been defined to be one who occupies the lands or premises of another in subordination to that otherâ€™s title, and with his assent, express or implied.â€Â  Columbia Ry., Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Jones, 119 S.C. 480, 490112 S.E. 267, 271 (1922).Â  â€œProperty in a thing consists not merely in its ownership and possession, but in the unrestricted right of use, enjoyment, and disposal.â€Â  Gasque v. Town of Conway, 194 S.C. 15, 8 S.E.2d 871, 873 (1940), overruled on other grounds, McCall by Andrews v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985) (overruling cases that held the State could not be sued without its consent).Â  Property owners also possess the right to protect their property.Â  See State v. Thompson, 349 S.C. 346, 350, 563 S.E.2d 325, 327 (2002).Â  \r\nBeach Market as the owner of the shopping center possesses the right to control those portions not leased to the tenants.Â  As the plaza was a common area, it was subject to the restrictions established by Beach Market.Â  By merely allowing Shamrock to utilize the plaza to serve food for a portion of its lease, Beach Market did not waive its right to place restrictions on that use if they become necessary. Â The trial court found Beach Market did not waive its right to limit the use of the plaza.Â  There was no evidence in the record to show Beach Market intentionally abandoned its right to protect its property or to forego placing reasonable restrictions on the propertyâ€™s use.Â  Additionally, Beach Market placed the restrictions in an effort to reduce the litter and other damage being done to the property by the number of people utilizing the plaza.Â  Accordingly, we find Beach Market retained the right to use or restrict the use of the plaza.\r\nIn addition, we find Beach Market is not estopped from limiting Shamrockâ€™s use of the plaza.[2]Â  As evidence of its detrimental reliance for its estoppel defense, Shamrock relies on its acquisition of outdoor furniture for the purpose of serving food and alcoholic beverages to persons on the plaza.Â  However, at the most, we find the incurring of this expense would afford it only a right to continue serving food and alcohol on the plaza during normal restaurant hours, a practice Beach Market is not seeking to restrict.Â  It does not grant Shamrock unlimited use of plaza for patrons milling about consuming alcohol into the morning hours.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find the trial court properly determined Beach Market, as the owner of the plaza, retained and did not waive the right to place restrictions on the plazaâ€™s use.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Lara Development\r\nShamrock contends the trial court erred in finding it failed to assert a claim upon which relief may be granted against Lara Development.Â  Shamrock asserts it was error to grant Lara Developmentâ€™s motion for an involuntary dismissal.Â  We disagree.\r\nPursuant to Rule 41(b), SCRCP:Â  â€œAfter the plaintiff in an action tried by the court without a jury has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant . . .Â  may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.â€Â  Rule 41(b) allows the judge as fact finder to weigh the evidence, determine the facts, and render judgment against the plaintiff if justified at this stage of the trial.Â  Johnson v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., 308 S.C. 116, 118, 417 S.E.2d 527, 529 (1992).Â  \r\nShamrockâ€™s complaint sought a declaratory judgment requesting the court find the restrictions placed by Beach Market after it took possession of the shopping center were invalid.Â  Additionally, Shamrock alleged it was a breach of its lease by Beach Market to place the restrictions on the plazaâ€™s use and to otherwise injure its business.Â  It sought an injunction prohibiting enforcement of the restrictions.Â  None of these claims assert any action by Lara Development that injured Shamrock, nor do the claims request any relief against Lara Development.Â  Accordingly, the dismissal of the claims against Lara is affirmed.Â  \r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Shamrockâ€™s Breach of Lease\r\nShamrock asserts the trial court erred in finding it breached the lease by utilizing the plaza and allowing excess littering and other damage to occur.Â  Although the trial court found a breach of the lease, it refused to order eviction.Â  Accordingly, we find no reversible error in the trial courtâ€™s finding of a breach.Â  See McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987) (stating that this court has long recognized that â€œwhatever doesnâ€™t make any difference, doesnâ€™t matterâ€).\r\nVI.Â Â Â  Damages\r\nShamrock asserts there was no evidence of damages and the master erred in finding Shamrock caused Beach Market damages through its use of the plaza.Â  We disagree.\r\nBeach Market provided evidence that it had to expend money to clean the area of the plaza, including the removal of excessive litter left by patrons of Shamrock.Â  While there may be no permanent damage to the property, there was evidence of damage to the landscaping, bathrooms, and parking area due to the late night use of the property.Â  Accordingly, we find evidence to support the findings of the master regarding damages created by Shamrockâ€™s use of the plaza.\r\nVII.Â Â  Injunction\r\nShamrock contends the trial court erred in failing to award an injunction.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn injunction is a drastic remedy and should be cautiously applied only when legal rights are unlawfully invaded or legal duties are willfully or wantonly neglected.Â  LeFurgy v. Long Cove Club Owners Assâ€™n, Inc., 313 S.C. 555, 558, 443 S.E.2d 577, 578 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  In this case, we have found no legal right of Shamrock being abridged by Beach Market.Â  Accordingly, as we find Beach Market had the right to place the restrictions on the use of the plaza, we conclude the trial court properly denied Shamrockâ€™s request for an injunction.\r\nVIII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nShamrock maintains the court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Lara Development and Beach Market.Â  The lease provided for the payment of attorneyâ€™s fees to the prevailing party in a dispute regarding the lease.Â  Shamrockâ€™s main contention is that the decision of the trial court should be reversed making Shamrock the prevailing party.Â  As we affirm the decision of the trial court, we find no error in its award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Lara Development and Beach Market under the terms of the lease.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL,JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Shamrock contends consideration for the modification existed in the detriment it incurred in purchasing furniture for the Plaza.Â  See Shayne of Miami v. Greybow, Inc., 232 S.C. 161, 167, 101 S.E.2d 486, 489 (1957) (stating consideration may consist of any benefit to the promisor or in a loss or detriment to the promisee). Â Â Our decision to affirm the trial courtâ€™s finding of no modification is based solely on the partiesâ€™ intent as to a modification.Â  We mention the lack of formal consideration only as evidence the partiesâ€™ did not intend a modification of the lease to grant Shamrock a leasehold interest in the plaza.Â  \r\n[2] Our conclusion remains the same applying either an equitable or law standard of review.Â  See Maher v. Tietex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 381 n.1,Â  500 S.E.2d 204, 209 n.1 (Ct.App.1998) (noting claim of equitable estoppel would fail under either a law or equity standard of review).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-298","title":"Rosenblum v.

Barr, III, of Charleston, and Gregory Milam Alford, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\nGale Carbone, Pro Se, of South Belmar, and Ralph E. Tupper, of Beaufort, for Respondents.\r\nCharles H. Gibbs, Jr., of Charleston, and Thomas Holloway, of Beaufort, for Respondent-Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â  This is an appeal from the final order of the trial court:Â  (1) entering judgment against Doug Muraglia and Michael and Gayle[1] Carbone for civil conspiracy; (2) refusing to subordinate the interests in real property of Nick Rini and Suntrust Mortgage to a mortgage held by Rosenblum; and (3) denying Rosenblumâ€™s foreclosure of the mortgage.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRosenblum, Michael Carbone (Carbone), and Muraglia are all residents of New Jersey.Â  Rosenblum testified that after liquidating a family business, he placed the assets in several law firm trust accounts, including a firm for which both Carbone and Muraglia worked.Â  When Rosenblum requested Carbone return the money, Carbone initially stalled.Â  He subsequently admitted that he and Muraglia had invested the money in different things and had lost the money.Â  In order to repay Rosenblum, Carbone executed in favor of Rosenblum a mortgage note for $200,000.Â  He secured the debt with a mortgage on property in Hilton Head he and Gayle had purchased in 1997.Â  Although Gayleâ€™s signature appears on the mortgage dated March 20, 2000, which purports to convey a mortgage interest on the entire property, Gayle in fact had conveyed her half interest in the property to Muraglia in 1998.[2] Â Â In addition, Michael Carbone signed a Demand Promissory Note in the amount of $220,300 to Rosenblum.Â  Rosenblumâ€™s counsel acknowledged at oral argument that both notes constituted the same obligation.Â  \r\nFour days after executing the notes and mortgage in favor of Rosenblum, Carbone deeded his one-half interest in the property to Muraglia.Â  Muraglia then filed and recorded his deed in the Office of the Register of Deeds for Beaufort County on March 29, 2000.Â  Rosenblum did not record his mortgage until March 31, 2000.Â  \r\nOn October 6, 2000, Rosenblum brought suit against Carbone in New Jersey to collect on the Demand Promissory Note.Â  He maintained in the action that the note was secured by the mortgage on the Hilton Head property.Â  On April 4, 2001, Carbone declared bankruptcy.Â  In his petition to the bankruptcy court, Carbone listed the $220,300 note as an unsecured debt owed to Rosenblum.Â  The bankruptcy court discharged the note.Â  As a result, on September 28, 2001, the New Jersey court dismissed Rosenblumâ€™s action with prejudice, finding the note was discharged.Â  \r\nIn the meantime, Rosenblum initiated the current action.Â  On February 27, 2001, Rosenblum filed a lis pendens in Beaufort County on the Hilton Head Property.Â  Twenty-one days later, after the lis pendens expired, Rosenblum filed the original complaint in this action, seeking to set aside the conveyance from Carbone to Muraglia.Â  The complaint alleged Carbone transferred the property to Muraglia in an attempt to defraud Rosenblum.Â  \r\nOn April 20, 2001, Muraglia entered into a contract to sell the Hilton Head property to Rini.Â  On November 19, 2001, the attorney handling the closing for both Muraglia and Rini sent a fax request to Rosenblumâ€™s attorney to determine the status of the lis pendens and to have it removed from the property.Â  Even though the lis pendens was not removed, Muraglia sold the property to Rini on November 26, 2001.Â  \r\nRosenblum amended his complaint to add as parties Rini and FedFirst, which had Riniâ€™s mortgage on the property.Â  In his second amended complaint, Rosenblum alleged the Carbones and Muraglia engaged in a civil conspiracy and sought the additional relief of foreclosure on the mortgage to the Hilton Head property, equitable subordination, and an injunction as to the proceeds of the sale to Rini.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the Carbones and Muraglia engaged in a civil conspiracy â€œto cheat [Rosenblum] from his money.â€Â  It awarded as damages the amount that would have been due under the note, $269,500.00.Â  However, the trial court concluded Rini was an innocent purchaser for value of the property and refused to subordinate FedFirstâ€™s mortgage or Riniâ€™s ownership to the interest of Rosenblum.Â  Finally, the referee found the mortgage held by Rosenblum was â€œnot entitled to be recorded . . . .â€Â  Rosenblum filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied.Â  Rosenblum, Muraglia, and Rini appealed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether the action is one at law or in equity is determined by the nature of the pleadings and the character of the relief sought.Â  In re Estate of Holden, 343 S.C. 267, 278, 539 S.E.2d 703, 709 (2000).Â  The appellate court will apply the appropriate standard of review for a particular issue in a case that contains both legal and equitable issues.Â  Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 331 S.C. 398, 416, 503 S.E.2d 191, 200 (Ct. App. 1998).Â Â  \r\nAn action for civil conspiracy is an action at law; the trial judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld on appeal unless they are without evidentiary support.Â  Gynecology Clinic v. Cloer, 334 S.C. 555, 557, 514 S.E.2d 592, 592-93 (1999).Â  This case also involves Rosenblumâ€™s requests to foreclose his mortgage.Â  â€œAn action to foreclose a real estate mortgage is an action in equity.â€Â  BB &amp; T of S.C. v. Kidwell, 350 S.C. 382, 387, 565 S.E.2d 316, 319 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  On appeal from an action in equity, this court may â€œfind facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nÂ A.Â Â Â Â  Personal and Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nMuraglia asserts the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss due to lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction.Â  As to the issue of personal jurisdiction, we find Muragliaâ€™s argument so conclusory as to be abandoned.Â  See Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œSouth Carolina law clearly states that short, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for review.â€).Â Â  \r\nAlthough Muragliaâ€™s argument as to the trial courtâ€™s lack of subject matter jurisdiction is equally conclusory, we will address this argument as this court may address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte.Â  See Lake v. Reeder Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 248, 498 S.E.2d 650, 653 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œLack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be raised for the first time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte by the court.â€).Â  \r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the courtâ€™s power to hear and determine a particular class of cases.Â  Whaley v. CSX Transp., 362 S.C. 456, ___, 609 S.E.2d 286, 295 (2005).Â  The trial court certainly had the power to hear and determine actions forÂ  subrogation and foreclosure of a mortgage and civil conspiracy.Â  Accordingly we find Muragliaâ€™s argument that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction is meritless.Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel\r\nMuraglia argues Rosenblumâ€™s claims are barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.Â  He maintains Rosenblum raised the same issues or could have raised the issues in his New Jersey lawsuit.Â  We agree.[3]\r\nRes judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior action between those parties.Â  Plum Creek Dev. Co., Inc. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999).Â  Under the doctrine of res judicata, â€œ[a] litigant is barred from raising any issues which were adjudicated in the former suit and any issues which might have been raised in the former suit.â€Â  Id.Â  (quoting Hilton Head Ctr. of S.C., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n of South Carolina, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987)).Â  â€œTo establish res judicata, the defendant must prove the following three elements: Â (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit.â€Â \r\nId.Â  \r\nâ€œUnder the doctrine of collateral estoppel, once a final judgment on the merits has been reached in a prior claim, the relitigation of those issues actually and necessarily litigated and determined in the first suit are precluded as to the parties and their privies in any subsequent action based upon a different claim.â€Â  Richburg v. Baughman, 290 S.C. 431, 434, 351 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1986).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A party may assert nonmutual collateral estoppel to preclude relitigation of a previously litigated issue unless the party sought to be precluded did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first proceeding, or unless other circumstances justify providing the party an opportunity to relitigate the issue.Â  Wade v. Berkeley County, 330 S.C. 311, 317, 498 S.E.2d 684, 687 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nIn the New Jersey action, Rosenblum sought to collect on the $220,300 Demand Promissory Note, which his counsel admitted was the same debt as the mortgage note.Â  In his complaint, he asserted that although he had accepted the mortgage to secure the note, â€œCarboneâ€™s actions rendered the Collateral worthless.â€Â  The New Jersey Superior Court dismissed Rosenblumâ€™s action with prejudice.Â  \r\nRosenblumâ€™s New Jersey action and South Carolina action both sought collection of the same debt.Â  The dismissal of Rosenblumâ€™s case with prejudice constitutes an adjudication on the merits.Â  See Nelson v. QHG of S.C., Inc., 354 S.C. 290, 311, 580 S.E.2d 171, 182 (Ct. App. 2003), affâ€™d in part and revâ€™d in part on other grounds by 362 S.C. 421, 608 S.E.2d 855 (2005), (â€œA case that is dismissed â€˜with prejudiceâ€™ indicates an adjudication on the merits and, pursuant to res judicata, prohibits subsequent litigation to the same extent as if the action had been tried to a final adjudication.â€).Â  As Rosenblum has already sought unsuccessfully to collect the debt in New Jersey, he is precluded from seeking collection of the same debt in South Carolina.Â  Thus, he had no right to foreclose the mortgage.Â  See 55 AmJur.2d Mortgages Â§ 359 (1996) (stating anything that operates to extinguish the debt necessarily operates to discharge the mortgage). \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Civil Conspiracy\r\nMuraglia asserts the trial court erred in finding Rosenblum proved he participated in a civil conspiracy and in awarding damages as a result.Â  We disagree.\r\nA civil conspiracy consists of (1) a combination of two or more persons, (2) for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff, (3) which causes the plaintiff special damages.Â  Hammond v. Butler, Means, Evins &amp; Brown, 300 S.C. 458, 463, 388 S.E.2d 796, 798 (1990).Â  â€œConspiracy may be inferred from the very nature of the acts done, the relationship of the parties, the interests of the alleged conspirators, and other circumstances.â€Â  Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 S.C. 595, 601, 358 S.E.2d 150, 153 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  â€œCivil conspiracy is an act which is by its very nature covert and clandestine and usually not susceptible of proof by direct evidence; concert of action, amounting to a conspiracy, may be shown by circumstantial as well as direct evidence.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nRosenblum testified Carbone confessed that he and Muraglia had taken Rosenblumâ€™s money to invest it and had lost it.Â  Rosenblum also recounted how a few days after Carbone executed the mortgage, Muraglia informed Rosenblum that he had filed a mortgage[4] before Rosenblum and taunted him, â€œ[H]a, ha, ha, you ainâ€™t getting [the property].â€Â  The record demonstrates that although Carbone had executed the mortgage in favor of Rosenblum, he quickly conveyed his interest in the same property to his alleged co-conspirator, who immediately filed the deed to win a â€œrace to the courthouse.â€Â  Under our limited standard of review of this action at law, we find the record supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that a civil conspiracy existed.Â  \r\nMuraglia asserts that Rosenblumâ€™s claim for civil conspiracy should fail because Rosenblum failed to prove any â€œspecial damagesâ€ as the remedy he sought was the same as he sought in his equitable claims.Â  We find no indication in the record that Muraglia raised this specific argument to the trial court.Â  Therefore, it is not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\nMuraglia also asserts that as at the most Rosenblum was ever entitled to is Carboneâ€™s interest in the property, the proper measure of damages would have been the equity value of that half interest, not the full amount of the extinguished promissory note executed by Carbone.Â  Muraglia failed to raise this argument to the trial court either at the hearing or in a post-trial motion when he learned of the trial courtâ€™s award of damages.Â  Accordingly, we find this argument not preserved.Â  See Godfrey v. Heller, 311 S.C. 516, 520, 429 S.E.2d 859, 862 (Ct.App.1993) (where an appellant learns for the first time when the appellant receives the order that the respondent would be granted certain relief, the appellant must move, pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment to preserve the issue).Â  Therefore, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s award of damages on Rosenblumâ€™s civil conspiracy claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.[5]\r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] While the caption of the case lists her as â€œGaleâ€ Carbone, the documents in the record show her signing as â€œGayleâ€ Carbone.Â  For purposes of this opinion, she will be referred to as â€œGayle.â€\r\n[2]  There were allegations that Gayle did not sign the mortgage herself.Â  \r\n[3] During the trial, Muraglia and Rini moved to dismiss the action and sought a directed verdict on the grounds that the action was barred by res judicata, collateral estoppel, or judicial estoppel. Â The trial court took the motions under advisement but never explicitly ruled on the motions.Â  As Rini and Muraglia were the prevailing parties as to subrogation and foreclosure of the mortgage, they were not required to secure a ruling on these issues in order to preserve them for appeal.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v.

Reams, of Atlanta and Todd R. Davidson andÂ  D. Michael Henthorne, both of Anderson, for Appellant.\r\nTodd Raymond Ellis, Smith Ellis &amp; Stuckey, PA, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Anderson Area Medical Center, Inc. appeals the trial courtâ€™s judgment in favor of Insulation Supply Company, Inc. (â€œISCâ€) in a collection action for work completed at the behest of ISC by its subcontractor, Aesthetic Designs, Inc. (â€œADIâ€).Â  Anderson Medical argues the trial court erred in (1) allowing ISC to recover because ISC was not properly licensed and (2) in calculating the recovery amount.Â  We affirm.1\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn July 2000, Anderson Medicalâ€™s facility was facing action by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) regarding fireproofing and fire-stopping concerns.Â  To avoid being fined or closed, Anderson Medical needed to repair areas of insufficient or failed fireproofing and fire-stopping material at its Health Campus facility.Â  Anderson Medicalâ€™s general contractor, Beers Construction, did not come back and remedy the fireproofing problems when initially demanded.Â  Anderson Medical then contacted ISC about performing the work.Â &nbsp; \r\nISC is an insulation company that had previously contracted with Anderson Medical on over forty projects since 1996 for the installation and removal of insulation and asbestos as well as, through a subcontractor, for fireproofing services.Â  Tripp Morris, the vice-president of projects at ISC, testified he met with Anderson Medical representative Mr. Chapman, toured the area where the problems existed, and was asked to begin work on the project right away, or that day if possible.Â  Morris informed Chapman that ISC did not perform fireproofing work but subbed out that type of work, that ISCâ€™s regular fireproofing subcontractor was unavailable and that ISC did not have its own crews available to start the work immediately.Â  Chapman asked Morris to find someone to get on the job so Anderson Medical could avoid DHEC sanctions.Â  Morris then suggested to Chapman that a good candidate for the job would be Charles Chason, owner of ADI.Â  Morris informed Chapman that ADI was a general carpentry contractor that had no fireproofing experience, but Chason was reputable, and the company was based there in Anderson so it would cut down on hotel and per diem charges of employees that would be incurred if they used ISCâ€™s employees.Â  \r\nMorris, Chason and Chapman met at the Health Campus facility where Chapman reiterated the need to get the job started and asked for a proposal.Â  On July 22, 2000, Morris forwarded to Anderson Medical ADIâ€™s proposal to ISC.Â  The proposal set forth ADIâ€™s hourly rates and provided ISC would supply all fireproofing materials and application equipment while ADI would supply all labor for the repair work and all labor and materials to clean the work areas.Â  Morris told Chapman ISC would charge Anderson Medical cost plus 20% to perform the work.Â  The plan was for ISC and ADI to begin work on the deficient areas so that Anderson Medical would not be fined, and to work until the projectâ€™s general contractor, Beers Construction, could come back in and complete the work.Â  ADI was told to proceed with the project.Â  \r\nAt the beginning of the project, Morris was at Anderson Medical twice a week to oversee the work and to ensure ADI met the hospitalâ€™s requirements.Â  Whenever he made site visits, he would check the areas worked on for deficiencies and make sure there were no problems and that Anderson Medical was satisfied.Â  Between November 2000 and March 2001, ISC sent three invoices to Anderson Medical demanding payment of a total of $294,829 for the work performed.Â  After DHEC apparently became satisfied with the progress on the fireproofing problems, Anderson Medical terminated ISC and ADIâ€™s work on the project, but refused to pay the submitted invoices.Â  Thereafter, in January 2002, Beers Construction and its fireproofing contractor undertook the remaining remedial repairs.Â  \r\nISC brought suit against Anderson Medical alleging causes of action of breach of their agreement and quantum meruit.Â  The trial court, sitting without a jury, determined the charges of ISC, with an adjustment for some misapplication, were reasonable and proper and ordered Anderson Medical to pay $278,909.19.Â  Anderson Medical filed a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, arguing ISC failed to abide by South Carolina contractor licensing requirements because ADI held only a Group Two license and ISC failed to supervise ADI as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-11-270, thereby precluding recovery in this case.Â  The trial court denied Anderson Medicalâ€™s motion to alter or amend and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an action at law, tried without a jury, the appellate courtâ€™s jurisdiction is limited to the correction of errors of law and the trial judgeâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless found to be without evidence that reasonably supports his findings.Â  Kemp V. Rawlings, 358 S.C. 28, 34, 594 S.E.2d 845, 848 (2004).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s findings are equivalent to those of a jury in an action at law.Â  King v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 317 S.C. 385, 389, 453 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1995).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South Carolina Contractorâ€™s Licensing Statutes\r\nAnderson Medical first contends the trial court erred in ruling ISC could recover where ISC failed to abide by the requirements imposed by the licensing statutes.Â  In particular, Anderson Medical asserts ADI lacked the required license for a job of that magnitude and ISC failed to provide the supervision required by law.Â  Thus, it argues ISC is precluded from bringing an action in either law or equity to enforce the provisions of the agreement.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we question whether Anderson Medical has properly preserved this issue for review.Â  While Anderson Medical asserted in its motion to alter or amend it argued at trial that ISC failed to abide by the licensing requirements, there is absolutely no evidence in the record before us that this issue was raised at the trial level.Â  Anderson Medical did not raise these licensing statutes as a defense in its answer.Â  Further, the record contains no argument of counsel before the trial court, and neither the order for judgment nor the order denying Anderson Medicalâ€™s motion to alter or amend indicate the issue was actually raised below.Â  See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œA party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.â€); Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C. 201, 215, 493 S.E.2d 826, 834 (1997) (the burden is on the appellant to provide an adequate record on appeal).Â  At any rate, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s determination that ISC is entitled to recover.Â  \r\nTo perform general or mechanical contracting services in excess of $5,000.00, an entity must obtain an appropriate license from the South Carolina Contractorâ€™s Licensing Board.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 40-11-10 and 40-11-30 (2001).Â  A general contractor with a Group Two license is limited to bidding on jobs that do not exceed $100,000.00.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-11-260(A)(2) (2001). 2Â  Further, Â§ 40-11-370(C) of the South Carolina Code provides an entity which does not possess a valid license â€œmay not bring an action either at law or in equity to enforce the provisions of a contract.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-11-370(C) (Supp. 2004).Â  However, our licensing statutes also provide that â€œ[l]icensees may utilize the services of unlicensed subcontractors to perform work within the limitations of the licenseeâ€™s license group and license classification or subclassification; provided, the licensee provides supervision.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-11-270(C) (2001).Â  Although ADI possessed only a Group Two license, ISC held the requisite general contractorâ€™s license for the work performed.Â  Thus, ISC would not be precluded from recovery under Â§ 40-11-370(C) as long as ISC provided supervision to ADI pursuant to Â§ 40-11-270(C).\r\nOn appeal, Anderson Medical contends the trial court determined ADI worked under the direct supervision of Anderson Medical and not ISC.Â  It therefore argues the trial court determined ISC â€œperformed no level of supervisionâ€ of ADI and, thus, did not comply with Â§ 40-11-270(C).Â  We disagree.\r\nAt trial, Morris testified that he told Anderson Medical, â€œif we do some work for the hospital, youâ€™re going to have to have somebody with me the whole time showing me what needs to be done, where to go, and weâ€™ll get it done.â€Â  He stated that before ISC would accept the contract with Anderson Medical, they would have to agree to â€œprovide our forces with someone from the hospital to direct us in what work to be performed at the hospital, because the scope of the work was so large . . . they had to be there to tell us what to do.â€Â  Morris further testified the arrangement was for him to supervise and oversee the project to make sure that ADIâ€™s work met the requirements of the hospital.Â  He stated: \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the project I was probably there twice a week for a couple hours each time.Â  After maybe a month of the project into force, I would probably visit the project once every couple of weeks just to observe the work, talk with my subcontractor to make sure things were okay with the hospital, we werenâ€™t causing any problems.\r\n\r\nHe further testified he was in contact with the hospital by telephone twice a week every week throughout the entire project and did not charge the hospital for any man-hours he personally spent on the job.Â  \r\nADIâ€™s owner, Chason, was asked at trial about Morrisâ€™ visits to the job site and his supervision over the project.Â  Chason responded that Morris was on the project in the beginning once a week and thereafter twice a month, but they had continuous conversations by phone and Chason alerted Morris every week of the status of the project and immediately informed him of any problems that arose.Â  Morris would direct ADI to make adjustments whenever he had any concerns with the project.Â  When asked if he felt he had inadequate supervision from ISC, Chason testified, â€œNo sir.Â  We were loaded with supervision from ISC and from Anderson Medical Center.â€Â  \r\nWhile the court did state in its order that â€œin the latter part of July 2000, ADI was told to proceed with the project under the direct supervision and direction of [Anderson Medical]â€, it made no specific finding that ISC did not provide supervision on the project.Â  Further, while the record before us clearly demonstrates that Anderson Medical provided someone from the hospital to direct both ISC and ADI in what work was to be performed, the only evidence of record is that ISC supervised ADI in the performance of that work.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in ruling in favor of ISC. 3Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valuation Method\r\nAnderson Medical next asserts the trial court erred in calculating the reasonable price for the fireproofing work.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nAn agreement to do work on a cost-plus basis does not mean that one has the right to expend any amount of money he may see fit upon the work, regardless of the propriety, necessity, or honesty of the expenditure, and then compel repayment by the other party, who has confided in his integrity, ability, and industry.Â  Indeed, in any cost-plus contract there is an implicit understanding between the parties that the cost must be reasonable and proper.Â  \r\n\r\nWatson &amp; Howell Builders v. Billingsley, 310 S.C. 39, 41, 425 S.E.2d 43, 44 (Ct. App. 1992) (citation omitted).\r\nAnderson Medical contends the trial court applied an erroneous method for calculating a reasonable price for the project.Â  Specifically, it objects to the trial courtâ€™s comparison of ADIâ€™s weekly charges with those from Beers Construction when Beers came back on the job, contending Beers completed more work for less money.Â  \r\nThe trial court did compare the weekly charges of Beers and ISC, but did not, as Anderson Medical claims, base its conclusion the charges were reasonable entirely on the fact the weekly wages were commensurate.Â  Rather, the court considered that both ISC and ADI lacked experience at the beginning of the contract, a fact of which Anderson was fully advised, and there was a greater difficulty of work in the areas that ISC and ADI completed.Â  Additionally, the trial court found Anderson Medicalâ€™s primary concern was the avoidance of sanctions and Anderson Medical apparently determined the length of time involved was proper as it did not direct ISC or ADI to cease work on the project until the fireproofing and fire-stopping issues were resolved with DHEC.Â  Anderson Medical found itself in the position of needing immediate remedial work performed on its building and requested ISC to subcontract the work to ADI to avoid sanctions from DHEC.Â  It accepted that ISC would subcontract the work to the inexperienced ADI.Â  Thus, the fact that ADI may have progressed more slowly than Beers does not mean the charges were unreasonable.Â  Further, ISC presented the expert testimony of Donald Nicholson, who stated he reviewed the time sheets, man-hours and difficulty in the location of the job.Â  Nicholson stated, â€œI believe that based on what Iâ€™ve seen, what Iâ€™ve observed as clean up, what I know to be the technique and means and methods of hallways, pipes, sprinkler heads . . . the protection and cleaning of all that and the time on the time sheets and the man hours involved, I believe that to be a pretty correct number based on the information I have.â€Â  We find the evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s determination the charges were reasonable and proper.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 For purposes of this appeal, ISC concedes ADI held a Group Two license at the time it performed the work in question.Â  \r\n3 See Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-301","title":"Griffin v.

Shell Suber, Jr. and Robert J. Thomas, both of Columbia, for Appellant. \r\nClifford O. Koon, Paul D. de Holczer, and Mary Frances Gibson, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Home Shop Realty Company appeals from the trial judgeâ€™s denial of a directed verdict and award of attorneyâ€™s fees in favor of Shirley and Henry Griffin and Jacquelyn and Michael Burke on their breach of contract action.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2000, Eugene Grissom McDonald was employed as a real estate agent for Home Shop Realty, a real estate brokerage company.Â  McDonald was also the sole member of a limited liability company called White Oak Properties, LLC.Â  White Oak was formed for the purpose of purchasing, renovating, and reselling investment property.Â  In April of 2000, White Oak purchased real estate located at 4676 Crystal Drive in Columbia for $62,000.Â  White Oak, through McDonald, renovated the property and listed it for sale in October of 2000 for $128,000.Â  The multiple listing service for real estate named Home Shop Realty as the real estate listing office.Â  \r\nDuring that same time, the Griffins became interested in purchasing investment property to be used as a residence by the Burkes, their daughter and son-in-law.Â  While house hunting, the Burkes saw the Crystal Drive property with a Home Shop Realty sign in the front yard listing McDonaldâ€™s number as the contact number.Â  The Burkes called the number, talked with McDonald, and were shown the property.Â  Based on the Burkesâ€™ representations, the Griffins decided to purchase the Crystal Drive property.Â Â Â  \r\nOn December 13, 2000, the Griffins entered into a contract for sale with White Oak, through McDonald, to purchase the Crystal Drive property for $122,000.Â  On December 28, 2000, the Griffins entered into an installment sales contract with White Oak for the same property.Â  From this sale, Home Shop Realty was paid $250 in commissions or administrative fees, and the Griffinsâ€™ real estate agent was paid $4,270 in commissions.Â  \r\nWhen the Burkes moved into the Crystal Drive home, they discovered numerous problems with the residence, including a defective foundation.Â  The Griffins and Burkes sued McDonald, White Oak, and Home Shop alleging breach of the contract for sale, fraud, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, negligent misrepresentation, civil conspiracy, violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act, and piercing the corporate veil.Â  \r\nAt trial, Shirley Griffin and the Burkes all testified that they knew McDonald and White Oak were the owners and sellers of the Crystal Drive property.Â  McDonald signed the contracts for sale as the seller of the property on behalf of White Oak.Â  Neither the Burkes nor the Griffins alleged that McDonald was acting as an agent for Home Shop in signing the contract for sale or testified that he or she believed Home Shop was the owner and seller.\r\nHome Shop moved for a directed verdict on the grounds that McDonald was the seller, and there was no evidence McDonald was acting as the agent of Home Shop.Â  The trial judge denied the motion.Â  The causes of action were submitted to the jury through a special verdict form.Â  The jury rejected all of the Burkesâ€™ and Griffinsâ€™ causes of action, except breach of contract.Â  Through the special verdict form, the jury found â€œDefendants breached the Contract for the purchase of the home on Crystal Drive,â€ and that â€œDefendants should take the home back and return the purchase money to the Plaintiffs.â€Â  The jury did not distinguish between any of the defendants and did not award any other damages.Â  \r\nThrough an â€œOrder Dealing with Post-trial Motions,â€ the trial judge granted the Griffinsâ€™ and Burkesâ€™ motion for attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $40,626.Â  Home Shop made a â€œMotion for an Interpretation of the Verdict or in the alternative Judgment For This Defendant Not Withstanding the Verdictâ€ on the grounds that it was not a party to the contract for sale.Â  The trial judge denied the motion, stating:\r\n\r\nHome Shop presented evidence at trial and argued at the appropriate times that no agency relationship existed between Home Shop and the McDonald Defendants that would render Home Shop liable to a judgment in this case.Â  However, ample evidence was presented at trial that Home Shop allowed the McDonald Defendants to list and sell property through Home Shopâ€™s brokerage.Â  A Home Shop sign was placed on the subject property as an advertisement for sale.Â  Whit Suber, the owner and Broker at Home Shop, entered the premises on one or more occasions during the time the house was listed for sale according to the key box activity report which was entered into evidence.Â  Home Shop was also the listing Broker when the house was listed on the multiple listing service.Â Â  Suber denied that he ever personally showed the house to potential buyers.Â  However, the uncontradicted evidence of his accessing the multiple listing service key box and his failure to provide a plausible explanation for his entry other than â€œshowingâ€ the house, is sufficient to allow the jury to reasonably infer the existence of an agency relationship.Â  At the very least, the uncontradicted documentary and testimonial evidence of Home Shopâ€™s sign being on the property supports an inference of apparent authority.Â  \r\n\r\nFinally, the judge denied all of White Oakâ€™s and McDonaldâ€™s motions.Â  The trial judge reiterated that judgment was entered against all defendants - McDonald, White Oak, and Home Shop.Â  Home Shop renewed its motions and argued that attorneyâ€™s fees should not be assessed against it because it was not a party to the contract.Â  These motions were also denied.Â  Home Shop appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHome Shop asserts the trial judge erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict on the breach of contract claim because there is no evidence that Home Shop was a party to the contract for sale or participated in the sale.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn reviewing a denial of a motion for directed verdict, this court must view all evidence and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the opposing party.Â  Bultman v. Barber, 277 S.C. 5, 7, 281 S.E.2d 791, 792 (1981).Â  â€œHowever, this does not give the Court license to ignore facts unfavorable to that party.Â  In essence, we must determine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe Griffins do not dispute that Home Shop was not a party to the contract for sale or the installment sales contract between themselves and White Oak and McDonald.[1]Â  Because Home Shop was not a party to the contract, â€œit owed no duty or obligation thereunder.â€Â  Drafts v. Shull Sausage Co.,&nbsp; 276 S.C. 52, 54, 275 S.E.2d 577, 578&nbsp;(1981); see also Roundtree Villas Assâ€™n, Inc. v. 4701 Kings Corp.,&nbsp; 282 S.C. 415, 423, 321 S.E.2d 46, 51&nbsp;(1984) (finding the trial judge erred in failing to grant a directed verdict on a breach of warranty claim, even though warranties existed, because the appellants did not enter into any warranty agreements).\r\nRather, the Griffins assert that Home Shop should be held to a duty under the contract for sale because McDonald was acting as Home Shopâ€™s agent in connection with the sale.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough McDonald may or may not have acted as an agent for Home Shop with respect to marketing the property, there is absolutely no evidence that McDonald acted as an agent for Home Shop in signing the sales contract.Â  See Frasier v. Palmetto Homes of Florence, Inc., 323 S.C. 240, 244, 473 S.E.2d 865, 867 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œA party asserting agency as a basis of liability must prove the existence of the agency, and the agency must be clearly established by the facts.â€).Â  \r\nWith respect to the contract for sale of the Crystal Drive property, McDonald signed the contract himself as seller and owner, on behalf of White Oak.Â  The Griffins never alleged that Home Shop was the actual owner or seller of the property.Â  The only potential agency relationship that could exist with respect to the Griffins breach of contract claim is the relationship between McDonald and White Oak.Â  See Peoples Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club,&nbsp; 310 S.C. 132, 145-46, 425 S.E.2d 764, 773&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1992) (â€œAgency is a fiduciary relationship which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another to be subject to the control of the other and to act on his behalf.â€).\r\nAs a result, the trial judge erred in denying Home Shopâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the Griffinsâ€™ breach of contract cause of action.[2]Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The Griffins argue that Home Shopâ€™s argument is not preserved for appeal because although Home Shop argued that McDonald was not acting as its agent, it never argued that it was not a party to the contract for sale.Â  However, Home Shopâ€™s argument has consistently been that McDonald, not Home Shop, was the seller of the house and that McDonald did not act as an agent of Home Shop in the sale.Â  Simply because Home Shop has changed the specific terminology used in its argument on appeal does not mean the issue is not preserved.Â  See McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co.,&nbsp; 325 S.C. 327, 344, 479 S.E.2d 67, 75&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (â€œ[An argument] should be sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the [issue] so that it can be reasonably understood by the trial judge.â€).\r\n[2] Home Shop also argues that the trial judge erred in assessing attorneyâ€™s fees against it because it was not a party to the contract.Â  We need not address this issue on appeal.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (finding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issues is dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-302","title":"In the Interest Of S.
