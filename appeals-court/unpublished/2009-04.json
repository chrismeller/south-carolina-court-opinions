Scott\r\n  Dover, of Pickens, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: In this domestic matter, Husband asserts the family court abused\r\n  its discretion in (1) approving and adopting the settlement agreement, (2)\r\n  awarding an equal allocation of marital property, and (3) awarding fractional\r\n  interests in the parties' Florida property.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nBob W. Young (Husband) and\r\n  Carol Jennings Young (Wife) were married on November 9, 1974.Â  The parties were\r\n  married for thirty years and have no children.Â  \r\nHusband and Wife separated\r\n  on or about May 4, 2004. Â Husband filed a complaint on July 15, 2004, and an\r\n  amended complaint on August 6, 2004, seeking separate support and maintenance,\r\n  equitable division, attorney's fees, and other relief.Â  On August 31, 2004,\r\n  Wife filed an answer and counterclaim seeking a divorce, equitable division,\r\n  attorney's fees, and other relief. \r\nA final hearing was held\r\n  before the Honorable Timothy L. Brown on April 10, 2006.Â  At the call of the\r\n  case, Husband made a motion to amend his pleadings to include one year of\r\n  continuous separation as an alternative ground for divorce as well as a request\r\n  for attorney's fees.Â  Counsel for Husband then placed into the record a\r\n  partial agreement of the parties as to all issues with the exception of the\r\n  percentages of the distribution of the marital estate, attorney's fees, and\r\n  divorce.Â  Among the issues stipulated in the partial agreement was a waiver of\r\n  alimony.Â  Counsel for Husband also noted that the parties agreed Husband would\r\n  remain in the marital home but that the home would be placed for sale at an\r\n  agreed upon price. Â Thereafter, Husband's counsel stipulated as to the valuations\r\n  of various personal items, bank accounts, and retirement accounts.Â  Husband's counsel\r\n  also indicated the parties agreed Wife would share 25% interest in any earnings\r\n  relative to Husband's corporation, Vortex, Inc.Â  \r\nHusband's counsel further\r\n  informed the court that Husband and Wife agreed their Florida property, which\r\n  consists of a commercial building and billboard in Miami, FL, would not be sold\r\n  but would continue to be owned jointly by the parties, and that the proceeds\r\n  and liabilities would be divided subject to the percentage determined by the\r\n  court. Â Husband's counsel stated that the Florida property had severe\r\n  maintenance issues and liabilities but that it was generating a total of\r\n  $4,900.00 per month in income. Â Later during the hearing, counsel for both\r\n  parties reconfirmed the agreement that the Florida property would not be sold\r\n  but would continue to be owned jointly by the parties. Â Husband's counsel\r\n  reasoned that this situation was favorable because the sale of the property may\r\n  trigger an environmental issue rendering the property worthless. \r\nFollowing these\r\n  stipulations, the court noted that the equitable apportionment issues were not\r\n  fully resolved but that it would factor in the stated stipulations to the full\r\n  agreement.Â  However, the court stated that it would make no commitment to\r\n  accept the agreement; the court further indicated that testimony must be\r\n  offered as to whether the agreement was fair and as to whether it was entered\r\n  into freely, knowingly, and voluntarily.Â  After the court's remarks, Husband's\r\n  counsel stated that he was prepared to stipulate that neither party was under\r\n  the influence of alcohol or drugs, and that the agreement was arrived at freely\r\n  and voluntarily without any coercion. \r\nThereafter, testimony\r\n  from Husband and Wife was taken. Â Both parties assented that the agreement as\r\n  stipulated by counsel was entered into freely, knowingly, and voluntarily. Â Husband\r\n  testified that his net worth at the time of the marriage was $800,000.00 to\r\n  $1,000,000.00 and that his net worth at the time of the hearing was\r\n  approximately $238,286.00. Â Wife testified to her role as homemaker and her\r\n  direct contributions to Husband's business, such as attending seminars and\r\n  arranging social functions.Â  Wife also testified that she was directly involved\r\n  in the Husband's real estate development in North Carolina, for which she\r\n  contributed her skills as a licensed interior decorator in addition to\r\n  overseeing all the day to day workings of the development.Â  \r\nBy final order and\r\n  divorce decree dated May 23, 2006, the court granted Husband a divorce on the\r\n  ground of one year of continuous separation.Â  In apportioning the marital\r\n  estate, the court approved the agreement of the parties and divided the marital\r\n  assets evenly with the exception of Husband's ownership interest in Vortex,\r\n  Inc., which was divided 75/25 in favor of Husband.Â  As to the Florida property,\r\n  the court ordered the parties to retain joint ownership of the property and to\r\n  maintain a joint account for the rental proceeds.Â  The order further provided\r\n  that Husband would assume primary responsibility for the joint account and for\r\n  providing an accounting of all funds received and all expenses authorized to be\r\n  paid by him in association with the maintenance and upkeep of the property.Â \r\n  Any funds remaining in the joint account after the payment of expenses would\r\n  then be divided evenly between the parties.Â  The court also ordered $5,000.00\r\n  in attorney's fees to be paid from the rental income from the Florida property to\r\n  each party's attorney.Â  \r\nHusband timely filed a\r\n  motion to alter or amend, which was granted in part as to the allocation of\r\n  marital debts and several valuation errors.Â  The court also reduced Wife's\r\n  award of attorney's fees by $1,000.00.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the\r\n  family court, this court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Ray v. Ray, 374 S.C. 79,\r\n  83, 647 S.E.2d 237, 239 (2007). Â Despite this broad scope of review, the\r\n  appellate court is not required to disregard the findings of the family court\r\n  judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, and was in a better position to\r\n  evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Wooten\r\n    v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband first asserts the\r\n  family court erred in adopting the settlement agreement.Â  Specifically, Husband\r\n  asserts the agreement contains vague, ambiguous, and indefinite terms and is\r\n  not procedurally or substantively reasonable.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 43(k), SCRCP,\r\n  provides that &quot;[n]o agreement . . . in an action shall be binding unless\r\n  reduced to the form of a consent order or written stipulation signed by counsel\r\n  and entered in the record, or unless made in open court and noted upon the\r\n  record.&quot; Rule 43(k), SCRCP.Â  To comply with the requirements of Rule\r\n  43(k), the order or written stipulation must set forth the terms of the\r\n  settlement.Â  Galloway v. Regis Corp., 325 S.C. 541, 545, 481 S.E.2d 714,\r\n  715-16 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  However, such an agreement is still subject to review\r\n  by the family court to determine its fairness.Â  Jackson v. Jackson, 279\r\n  S.C. 618, 620, 310 S.E.2d 827, 828 (Ct. App. 1983).\r\nAgreements regarding\r\n  alimony, child support, or property issues must be presented to the family\r\n  court for approval.Â  McKinney v. McKinney, 274 S.C. 95, 97, 261 S.E.2d\r\n  526, 527 (1980) (holding that a marital agreement, even though plain and\r\n  unambiguous, is nevertheless subject to the duty of the family court judge to\r\n  rule upon its fairness).Â  As such, &quot;[w]hen approving a settlement\r\n  agreement, [the family court] must, first, determine if assent to the agreement\r\n  is voluntarily given, and, second, determine if the agreement is 'within the\r\n  bounds of reasonableness from both a procedural and substantive\r\n  perspective.'&quot;Â  Blejski v. Blejski, 325 S.C. 491, 497-98, 480\r\n  S.E.2d 462, 466 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting Burnett v. Burnett, 290 S.C.\r\n  28, 347 S.E.2d 908 (Ct. App. 1986)).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, we\r\n  find the family court's approval of the agreement was appropriate.Â  Â At the commencement\r\n  of the hearing, counsel entered into the record a partial agreement reached\r\n  between the parties.Â  The partial agreement provided for, among other things,\r\n  the sale of the marital home and joint ownership of their Florida property. Â Specifically,\r\n  with regard to the marital residence, Husband's counsel stipulated that Husband\r\n  would have &quot;four months to shop the house sale&quot; and &quot;all the\r\n  terms and price of sale will be subject to the approval of both.&quot; Â As to\r\n  the Florida property, Husband's counsel stated that the parties agreed the\r\n  property would not be sold but would &quot;continue to be owned by the\r\n  parties.&quot;Â  Wife's counsel further confirmed that &quot;[w]e did agree to\r\n  that, that it would remain jointly held by the parties in the percentages\r\n  determined by Your Honor for [the] future, forever, and that the profits or any\r\n  profits received from there will be divided in the same manner.&quot;Â  These\r\n  terms of the partial agreement reached by the parties were entered into the\r\n  court's record and acknowledged in open court prior to the parties' testimony.Â  \r\nAfter the partial agreement\r\n  was placed into the record, both parties were questioned as to the fairness of\r\n  the agreement and whether it was entered into freely and voluntarily.Â  Husband and\r\n  Wife testified that they freely and voluntarily entered into the agreement. Â Husband\r\n  further testified that the agreement was fair and reasonable and that it was\r\n  his desire that the agreement, subject to percentage, be approved by the\r\n  court.Â  While Husband asserts that he never assented to the terms of the\r\n  agreement concerning the marital residence and the Florida property, the record\r\n  reveals that the disputed terms are the precise terms stipulated by counsel\r\n  that Husband testified were fair and reasonable.Â  Â Accordingly, based on the\r\n  evidence in the record, we find the agreement was freely and voluntarily\r\n  entered into by Husband and Wife.[1]Â  \r\nHowever, our analysis\r\n  does not conclude here as the agreement must be approved by the family court\r\n  before it can be adopted and incorporated into the decree.Â  See Moseley\r\n    v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 353, 306 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1983) (&quot;In all\r\n  decrees entered after this decision, the parties may contract concerning their\r\n  property settlement and alimony, but the submitted agreement must be approved\r\n  by the family court.&quot;); Drawdy v. Drawdy, 275 S.C. 76, 77, 268\r\n  S.E.2d 30, 30-31 (1980) (stating approval of an agreement requires\r\n  consideration beyond whether the agreement was validly executed). Â This process\r\n  involves two distinct questions: whether the parties freely and voluntarily\r\n  entered into the agreement; and whether the agreement is reasonable. Â Blejski,\r\n  325 S.C. at 497-98, 480 S.E.2d at 466.Â  In the instant case, the court\r\n  questioned both parties regarding their agreement.Â  Testimony from Husband and\r\n  Wife revealed no indication that either party was under any duress, coercion,\r\n  or force at the time they entered into the agreement.Â  The court further found\r\n  that the parties negotiated their agreement with the benefit and advice of\r\n  independent and experienced counsel.Â  As to reasonableness, the court took into\r\n  consideration the parties' economic circumstances, their contributions, the\r\n  duration of the marriage, and the absence of marital fault in determining that\r\n  the substance of the agreement was fair.Â  Our review of the record supports the\r\n  family court's findings. Â \r\nTherefore, based on the\r\n  evidence in the record, we find no error in the family court's decision to\r\n  approve and enforce the agreement after determining that the agreement was entered\r\n  into freely and voluntarily and that the agreement was fair and reasonable.Â \r\n  Moreover, Husband testified that he agreed to be bound by the agreement; thus,\r\n  he cannot now complain that the agreement is unreasonable.[2]Â  See Harrison v. Bevilacqua, 354 S.C. 129, 139-40, 580 S.E.2d 109,\r\n  114-15 (2003) (stating petitioner cannot now complain the trial court erred\r\n  when it took his own suggestion); Doe v. Roe, 379 S.C. 291, 297, 665\r\n  S.E.2d 182, 185 (Ct. App. 2008) (stating that appellant cannot, on appeal,\r\n  complain of an issue to which he consented).Â  \r\nHusband next asserts the\r\n  family court erred in apportioning the marital estate equally.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe apportionment of\r\n  marital property is within the family court's sound discretion and will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  In making an\r\n  apportionment of a marital estate, the court must consider and give weight in\r\n  such proportion as it finds appropriate to fifteen factors enumerated in Section\r\n  20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2007).[3]Â \r\n  Upon review of the family court's equitable apportionment, this court looks to\r\n  the overall fairness of the apportionment and if the result is equitable, taken\r\n  as a whole, we may accept that apportionment even if this court might have\r\n  weighed specific factors differently than the family court.Â  Simpson v.\r\n    Simpson, 377 S.C. 527, 533, 660 S.E.2d 278, 282 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\nThe philosophy behind\r\n  equitable apportionment is articulated in Walker v. Walker, 295 S.C.\r\n  286, 368 S.E.2d 89 (Ct. App. 1988), as based on a recognition that marriage is,\r\n  among other things, an economic partnership. Id. at 288, 368 S.E.2d at\r\n  90.Â  As such, upon dissolution of the marriage, property accumulated during the\r\n  marriage should be divided and distributed in a manner reflective of each\r\n  spouse's contribution to its acquisition, regardless of which spouse owns legal\r\n  title.Â  Id.Â Â  The family court has wide discretion in determining the\r\n  contributions made by each spouse to the marital property.Â  Ball v. Ball,\r\n  314 S.C. 445, 448, 445 S.E.2d 449, 451 (1994). \r\nHere, the record reflects\r\n  the court properly considered the appropriate factors of Â§ 20-7-472 in awarding\r\n  each party a one-half interest in any marital property owned by the parties.Â Â  Specifically,\r\n  the court considered the duration of the marriage, the parties' ages, the\r\n  parties' incomes, the valuations of the properties, and the tax consequences.Â \r\n  Additionally, as to the contributions of each party, the court determined that,\r\n  when considered as a whole, the contributions of each party were equal in\r\n  value.Â  In so finding, the court noted that Husband provided little testimony\r\n  as to his direct contributions but that Wife provided abundant testimony as to\r\n  both her direct contributions associated with Husband's business and her\r\n  indirect contributions as a homemaker.Â Â  After weighing these factors and in\r\n  light of the agreement between the parties, the court determined that the\r\n  marital estate should be apportioned fifty percent to each spouse.Â  While there\r\n  is no presumption in favor of a 50/50 division in marital property, we note the\r\n  court's finding is consistent with this court's routine approval of an equal\r\n  division as an appropriate starting point in marriages of long duration.Â  See Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 214, 634 S.E.2d 51, 56 (Ct. App. 2006) (stating\r\n  equal division is an appropriate starting point in dividing an estate of a\r\n  long-term marriage).Â  Given the statutory factors and in view of the duration\r\n  of the marriage, the value of the marital property, and the incomes of the\r\n  parties, we find the court's distribution is fair and equitable.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the disposition of the marital assets on an equal basis was not an abuse of\r\n  discretion. \r\nLastly, Husband asserts\r\n  the family court erred in awarding a fractional ownership in the Florida\r\n  property.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe objective in dividing\r\n  marital property is to sever all joint interests in the property as completely\r\n  as possible.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 285 S.C. 308, 311, 329 S.E.2d 443, 445\r\n  (Ct. App. 1985).Â  Thus, absent compelling reasons, joint ownership should be\r\n  avoided.Â  Id. \r\nIn the instant case, the\r\n  parties presented compelling reasons for maintaining joint ownership. Â In\r\n  particular, the record indicates that the property generates a substantial\r\n  income and that a court ordered sale of the property may trigger existing\r\n  environmental issues rendering the property worthless.Â  Thus, although the\r\n  court should avoid awarding fractional interests in marital property, we find\r\n  compelling reasons exist for retaining the parties' joint ownership in this\r\n  property.Â  Furthermore, the parties specifically provided for joint ownership\r\n  in their partial agreement which was properly approved and adopted by the\r\n  family court. Â Moreover, testimony from Husband after the agreement was placed\r\n  on the record further confirmed his desire to retain joint ownership when, in\r\n  response to the question concerning whether he and Wife &quot;agreed to\r\n  maintain jointly [the Florida] property,&quot; Husband replied, &quot;You're\r\n  right.&quot;Â  Accordingly, the court's award of joint ownership in the Florida\r\n  property was not an abuse of discretion.[4]Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons,\r\n  the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, PIEPER, and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Additionally,\r\n  as to the Florida property, Husband asserts he was not questioned regarding a\r\n  modification to the parties' agreement.Â  The alleged modification consists of\r\n  the following statement by Husband's counsel: &quot;We agree that the property\r\n  is not to be sold but would continue to be owned by the parties as . . . joint\r\n  tenants in common of whatever percentage Your Honor assigns to it because we\r\n  don't want to trigger an environmental problem because it may not be worth\r\n  anything.&quot;Â  Because this statement by counsel merely reiterated the terms\r\n  that counsel previously noted on the record at the beginning of the hearing and\r\n  to which Husband voiced his assent, we find this argument meritless.Â  \r\n[2] In view of the assent to the agreement by Husband's counsel in open court, we\r\n  note the long standing rule that a client is bound by the actions of his\r\n  attorney.Â  See Shelton v. Bressant, 312 S.C. 183, 184, 439 S.E.2d\r\n  833, 834 (1993) (&quot;Acts of an attorney are directly attributable to and\r\n  binding upon a client.&quot;); Smith v. Pearson, 210 S.C. 524, 530, 43\r\n  S.E.2d 479, 481 (1947) (finding appellants bound by statement made by counsel\r\n  at the outset of hearing); Widdicombe v. Tucker-Cales, 366 S.C. 75, 90\r\n  n.5, 620 S.E.2d 333, 341 n.5 (Ct. App. 2005) (&quot;[A] party is generally\r\n  bound by stipulations made by their counsel.&quot;).Â  &quot;The parties to a\r\n  suit are bound by admissions, made by their attorneys of record, in open court,\r\n  or elsewhere, touching matters looking to the progress of the trial.&quot; Hall\r\n    v. Benefit Ass'n of Ry. Employees, 164 S.C. 80, 83, 161 S.E. 867, 868\r\n  (1932).Â  As such, Husband's assertion that the agreement stipulated by counsel\r\n  was not settled according to his terms does not entitle him to a new trial de\r\n  novo on these issues, especially where, as here, Husband assented to the terms\r\n  at trial.Â  See Shelton, 312 S.C. at 185, 439 S.E.2d at 834\r\n  (&quot;When a litigant voluntarily accepts an offer of settlement, either directly or indirectly through the duly authorized actions of his attorney, the\r\n  integrity of the settlement cannot be attacked on the basis of inadequate\r\n  representation by the litigant's attorney.&quot;).Â  \r\n[3] Pursuant to Act No. 361, 2008 S.C. Acts 3623, Section\r\n  20-7-472 has been transferred to Section 20-3-620. Â See Act No. 361,\r\n  2008 S.C. Acts 3623 (stating &quot;the transfer and reorganization of the code\r\n  provisions in this act are technical . . . and are not intended to be\r\n  substantive&quot;). Â Because Article 6 has not yet been bound, all citations to\r\n  the statute refer to Chapter 7.\r\n[4] Despite Husband's contention that the order fails to account for his costs\r\n  associated with the upkeep of the property, we find the family court's order\r\n  clearly enunciates that the costs and expenses of maintenance and upkeep of the\r\n  Florida property are to be deducted from the net proceeds; therefore, both\r\n  parties share equally in these costs.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-162","title":"Chandler v.

Coombs, Jr., Office of the Attorney\r\n  General, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Jerry W. Peace, of Greenwood, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Â In this criminal case, Alti Monte\r\n  Livingston Haskell (Haskell) appeals the trial court's decision to admit evidence over an objection of hearsay and its\r\n  decision not to grant a mistrial.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nHaskell and his co-defendant Clarence Harrison (Harrison) were\r\n  tried for the shooting of Roderick Gartrell (Victim).Â  On February 10, 2004,\r\n  Torey Brown (Brown) picked up Victim in Georgia and drove him to Abbeville,\r\n  South Carolina.Â  While in Abbeville, Brown and Victim visited Harrison and\r\n  Brown's girlfriend, Kytraundra Cole (Cole).Â  Cole resided in the Hickory\r\n  Heights apartment complex, which is known as the Village.Â  Â Â \r\nShortly after Brown and Victim arrived at Cole's apartment, Brown\r\n  left and went to the store while Victim walked through the Village.Â  Along the\r\n  way, Victim encountered Harrison.Â  According to Victim, Harrison suggested they\r\n  go to Cole's apartment and wait there for Brown to return from the store.Â  As\r\n  Victim approached Cole's apartment, an individual wearing a white bandanna,\r\n  which covered the individual's face from the nose down, jumped from nearby\r\n  bushes and said, &quot;Give it up.&quot;Â  Victim was shot in the mouth before\r\n  he could respond.Â  \r\nDetective\r\n  John Smith (Detective Smith) began investigating Haskell based upon Brown's\r\n  statements that Victim\r\n  implicated Haskell as the shooter.Â  Due to his apparent involvement in the\r\n  shooting, Haskell was indicted for assault and battery with intent to kill,\r\n  attempted armed robbery, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a\r\n  violent crime.Â  Haskell and co-defendant\r\n  Harrison were tried together.Â  Haskell was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to an aggregate term\r\n  of twenty years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Haskell argues the trial court erred in the following ways: (1)\r\n  refusing to suppress Detective Smith's testimony that Brown stated Victim said\r\n  Haskell was the shooter; (2) failing to grant a mistrial when Victim testified\r\n  the co-defendant had just been released from jail; and (3) failing to grant a\r\n  mistrial when Cole testified the solicitor told her, prior to her testimony\r\n  before the jury, that she could not assert her Fifth Amendment[1] right against self-incrimination. \r\nI. Detective Smith's\r\n  testimony \r\nDuring Harrison's\r\n  cross-examination of Detective Smith, the latter testified that Brown stated\r\n  Victim said Haskell was the shooter.Â  Haskell objected to this testimony on the\r\n  ground of hearsay.Â  Harrison argued Detective Smith's testimony was not hearsay\r\n  because it was not being offered to prove the truth\r\n  of the matter asserted.Â  Rather, Harrison contended, the testimony was\r\n  being offered to show Detective Smith began investigating Haskell based upon\r\n  Brown's statements.Â  The trial court allowed the testimony.Â  \r\nAn appellate court is bound by the trial court's factual findings\r\n  unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6,\r\n  545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  The\r\n  admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State\r\n    v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 577, 647 S.E.2d 144, 170 (2007).Â  To constitute\r\n  an abuse of discretion, the conclusions of the trial court must lack\r\n  evidentiary support or be controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Additionally, improper admission of hearsay testimony constitutes\r\n  reversible error only when the admission causes prejudice. State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).\r\nHearsay is an out of court statement offered to prove the\r\n  truth of the matter asserted in the statement.Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  The rule\r\n  against hearsay prohibits the admission of an out of court statement to prove\r\n  the truth of the matter asserted unless an exception applies. Rule 802, SCRE.Â \r\n  However, an out of court statement is not hearsay if it is offered to explain\r\n  why a government investigation was undertaken.Â  State v. Brown, 317 S.C.\r\n  55, 63, 451 S.E.2d 888, 894 (1994).Â Â  \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, Detective Smith's testimony regarding Brown's statements explained the\r\n  basis for Detective Smith's investigation of Haskell and Harrison.Â \r\n  Specifically, Detective Smith was asked, &quot;And [Brown's statements were] a\r\n  basis for you making the case?&quot;Â  Detective Smith replied, &quot;That was\r\n  the first step.&quot;Â  Detective Smith further testified he believed Brown when\r\n  Brown implicated Haskell.Â  Thus, Detective Smith's testimony does not\r\n  constitute hearsay, and therefore, the trial court did not commit reversible\r\n  error by admitting it.Â  See id. (holding police officers'\r\n  testimony regarding complaints they had received prior to establishing surveillance\r\n  of defendant's residence was nonhearsay because it was admitted to explain why\r\n  officers began their surveillance); see also Webb v. Elrod, 308\r\n  S.C. 445, 449, 418 S.E.2d 559, 562 (Ct. App. 1992) (&quot;Proof of a statement\r\n  introduced for the purpose of showing a party relied and acted upon it is not\r\n  objectionable on the ground of hearsay.&quot;).\r\nFurthermore, the statements relate to Haskell's character and do\r\n  not constitute hearsay.Â  German v. State, 325 S.C. 25, 28, 478 S.E.2d\r\n  687, 688 (1996).[2]Â \r\n  In German, the petitioner had been convicted of a drug offense.Â  Id.Â \r\n  at 27, 478 S.E.2d at 688.Â  During the trial, an undercover agent testified he\r\n  received several tips that the petitioner was distributing or selling drugs.Â  Id.Â \r\n  These statements specifically referred to the petitioner and not to drug\r\n  activity in general.Â  Id.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court explicitly\r\n  stated that the statements were not objectionable as hearsay but were comments\r\n  on the petitioner's character.Â  Id. at 28, 478 S.E.2d at 688.Â  Likewise,\r\n  Detective Smith's testimony that Brown\r\n  stated Victim said Haskell was the shooter was not\r\n  objectionable on hearsay grounds.Â  Â See also Rhodes v. State,\r\n  349 S.C. 25, 31, 561 S.E.2d 606, 609 (2002) (holding testimony from the\r\n  victim's friend that he gave the victim a yearbook with the defendant's picture\r\n  in it because the friend had heard rumors that the\r\n  defendant was involved in shooting &quot;a guy and a girl&quot; was not\r\n  objectionable on hearsay grounds but was\r\n  character evidence). \r\nII. Mistrial based on Victim's\r\n  testimony \r\nDuring cross-examination by the State, Victim was asked why he had\r\n  visited Abbeville.Â  Victim responded, &quot;Oh because . . . Brown, me and . .\r\n  . . [Harrison] were friends for a long time, and I think [Harrison] had just\r\n  got out of jail, or [Brown], or someone.&quot;Â  Harrison made a motion for a\r\n  mistrial, and Haskell joined in the motion.Â  The trial court denied this motion\r\n  but issued a curative instruction.Â  \r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. White, 371\r\n  S.C. 439, 443-44, 639 S.E.2d 160, 162-63 (Ct. App. 2006).Â Â  The trial court's\r\n  decision will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion\r\n  amounting to an error of law.Â  Id.Â  South Carolina courts favor the\r\n  exercise of wide discretion of the trial\r\n  court in determining the merits of such a motion in each individual case.Â  Id.Â  It is only in cases in which there is an abuse of discretion resulting in\r\n  prejudice to the defendant that this Court will intervene and grant a new\r\n  trial.Â  Id.Â  \r\nA manifest necessity must exist for the trial court to discharge\r\n  the jury and declare a mistrial.Â  Id.Â  However, the trial court is left\r\n  to determine, in its discretion, whether, under all the circumstances of each\r\n  case, such necessity exists.Â  Id.Â  The mistrial should be granted only\r\n  if there is a manifest necessity or the ends of public justice are served.Â  Id.Â  The trial court should first exhaust other methods to cure possible prejudice\r\n  before declaring a mistrial.Â  Id.\r\nIn this case, even if it is assumed the trial court's\r\n  decision not to declare a mistrial was an abuse of discretion, Haskell cannot\r\n  show resulting prejudice.Â  Victim testified that he thought Harrison, Brown, or\r\n  someone else was released from jail.Â  Victim made no mention of Haskell.Â  Thus,\r\n  the jury was not told Haskell was recently released from jail.Â  Consequently,\r\n  assuming Victim's testimony did result in prejudice to Harrison or Brown by\r\n  painting them as criminals, this prejudice did not carry over to Haskell\r\n  because his name was never mentioned.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the\r\n  trial court gave a curative instruction to the jury by striking Victim's answer\r\n  and ordering the jury not to consider it &quot;in any fashion when reaching a\r\n  verdict . . . .&quot;Â  It is well established that a curative instruction to the jury to disregard incompetent evidence and not to\r\n  consider it during deliberation is deemed to cure any alleged error in its\r\n  admission, even in criminal cases.Â  Id. at 445, 639 S.E.2d at 163.Â  \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, the trial court's curative instruction was sufficient to cure Victim's\r\n  vague statement that he believed Harrison, Brown, or some other individual had\r\n  gotten out of jail.Â  Thus, the trial court's decision not to declare a mistrial\r\n  was not reversible error. \r\nIII. Mistrial based on\r\n  Cole's Fifth Amendment right\r\nPrior\r\n  to Cole's testimony, and while the trial court was in recess, Cole got the solicitor's\r\n  attention as the solicitor was walking into court.Â  Cole informed the solicitor\r\n  she did not wish to testify and asked if it was possible for her not to\r\n  testify.Â  In this context, Cole asked the solicitor whether she could invoke\r\n  her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.Â  Apparently, the\r\n  solicitor did not address Cole's question regarding her Fifth Amendment right\r\n  but told Cole she would be called to testify.[3]Â \r\n  These facts came to light after Cole had testified.Â  Harrison moved for a mistrial,\r\n  and Haskell joined in the motion.Â  The trial court denied this motion.Â  \r\nAs explained above, the decision to grant or deny a mistrial is\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court, and it is only in cases in\r\n  which there is an abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice to the defendant\r\n  that this Court will intervene and grant a new trial.Â  Id. at 443-44,\r\n  639 S.E.2d at 162-63.Â  \r\nHaskell argues the trial court should have granted his mistrial\r\n  motion because Cole erroneously believed she could not assert her Fifth\r\n  Amendment right.Â  Haskell contends he was prejudiced because Cole had provided\r\n  a statement to an officer prior to her testimony and she was precluded from\r\n  providing truthful testimony at the trial, which may have contradicted her\r\n  earlier statement to the police, due to her belief that she could not assert\r\n  her Fifth Amendment right.Â  \r\nThe Fifth Amendment protects an individual against being\r\n  involuntarily called as a witness against herself in a criminal prosecution. State\r\n    v. Hook, 348 S.C. 401, 415, 559 S.E.2d 856, 863 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The Fifth\r\n  Amendment also allows an individual to refuse to answer questions when the\r\n  answer will tend to subject the person to criminal responsibility.Â  Id. \r\nIn the present case, Cole wished to exercise her Fifth Amendment\r\n  protection solely because she did not want to be involved in the trial.Â  When\r\n  asked by the solicitor, &quot;And at that time you communicated to me that you\r\n  didn't want to testify&quot; outside the presence of the jury, Cole responded, &quot;Yes.&quot;Â \r\n  The solicitor also posed the following question, &quot;And you really never\r\n  have wanted anything to do with [the trial] have you?&quot; Cole responded, &quot;No\r\n  sir.&quot;Â  Thus, the basis for Cole's hesitation to provide testimony at trial\r\n  was her desire not to take part in the trial.Â  \r\nThe Fifth Amendment does not operate to provide blanket protection\r\n  to those individuals who would prefer not to participate in a case.Â  See McCarthy v. Arnstein, 266 U.S. 34, 40 (1924) (&quot;[T]he privilege\r\n  [against self-incrimination] . . . applies . . . wherever the answer might tend to\r\n  subject to criminal responsibility him\r\n  who gives it.&quot;).Â  Additionally, if potential witnesses could claim Fifth\r\n  Amendment protection because of a desire to avoid testifying, it would be\r\n  tremendously difficult to conduct trials.Â  The trial court's denial of the\r\n  motion for mistrial was proper.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J., concurs in result only in a separate opinion. \r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J.:Â  I concur in the result of the\r\n  instant case because I believe we are bound by the Supreme Court's decision in State\r\n    v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 63, 451 S.E.2d 888, 894 (1994) (out of court\r\n  statement is not hearsay if it is offered to explain why a government\r\n  investigation was undertaken).\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J.:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I\r\n  believe the statement at issue was inadmissible hearsay.Â  In my opinion, the\r\n  offered explanation as to why the investigation was undertaken was not at issue\r\n  in this case and would improperly expand the use of this otherwise narrow\r\n  application of the law.Â  Moreover, I do not find the evidence was character\r\n  evidence.Â  Accordingly, because the evidence as to the identity of the shooter\r\n  was extremely weak, I would not find the error was harmless beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt and would reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\r\n  states in relevant part, &quot;No person shall be .\r\n  . . compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .&quot; U.S. Const. amend.\r\n  V.\r\n[2] In German, our Supreme Court concluded it had\r\n  erroneously decided the case of State v. Pollard, 260 S.C. 457, 196\r\n  S.E.2d 839 (1973).Â  In Pollard, a police officer was permitted to\r\n  testify regarding information he had received from other persons, which led to\r\n  the defendant's arrest. Pollard, 260 S.C. at 460, 196 S.E.2d 840.Â  The\r\n  police officer testified, in effect, that he had &quot;received information\r\n  from some other source or witnesses as the basis for his signing the warrant\r\n  [for the defendant].&quot;Â  Id.Â  Our Supreme Court reversed the\r\n  conviction and ordered a new trial, holding: &quot;The testimony of the\r\n  officer, that he signed the warrant upon the basis of information received from\r\n  witnesses who did not testify, was clearly hearsay and inadmissible.&quot; Id.Â \r\n  However, in German our Supreme Court held that Pollard was\r\n  incorrectly decided and the statements were not objectionable as hearsay but\r\n  were objectionable as improper comments on the defendant's character.Â  German, 325 S.C. at 28\r\n  n.2, 478 S.E.2d at 688 n.2.\r\n[3] According to Cole, the solicitor told her she could\r\n  not invoke the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. According to\r\n  the solicitor, he did not address Cole's question regarding her Fifth Amendment\r\n  right.Â  The trial court found the solicitor's testimony more credible than\r\n  Cole's testimony.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-166","title":"State v.

As to whether the trial court prohibited meaningful\r\n  cross-examination of the Stateâ€™s witnesses: State v. Simmons, 360 S.C.\r\n  33, 46, 599 S.E.2d 448, 454 (2004) (stating the failure to make a proffer of\r\n  excluded evidence will preclude review on appeal); State v.

Hawkins, 310 S.C. 50, 54,\r\n  425 S.E.2d 50, 57 (Ct.

Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003) (â€œA party may\r\n  not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal.â€); State v.\r\n    Holliday, 333 S.C. 332, 509 S.E.2d 280 (Ct. App. 1998) (stating to preserve an alleged error in\r\n  admitting evidence, the objection should be sufficiently specific to bring into\r\n  focus the precise nature of the alleged error so it can be reasonably\r\n  understood by the trial judge).Â  \r\n3.\r\n  As to whether the trial court abused its discretion in allowing inadmissible\r\n  hearsay into evidence: State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 58-59, 609 S.E.2d\r\n  520, 523 (2005) (internal citations omitted) (â€œTo preserve an issue for review\r\n  there must be a contemporaneous objection that is ruled upon by the trial court.

Sheheen, of\r\n  Camden, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: The South Carolina Department of Transportation (the\r\n  Department) appeals the circuit court's award of attorney's fees to Gloria\r\n  Hood. \r\nOn\r\n  June 30, 2004, the Department filed a notice of condemnation in Fairfield\r\n  County to acquire a 3.5-acre portion of Gloria Hood's 14.2-acre tract for a\r\n  highway project. Â The Department then filed an action to determine the\r\n  value of the condemned property.Â  After a jury trial resulting in a $100,000\r\n  verdict to Hood, the circuit court awarded attorney's fees pursuant to section\r\n  28-2-510 of the South Carolina Code. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-510(B)\r\n  (Supp. 2008) (providing a landowner who prevails in the trial of a condemnation\r\n  action may recover his reasonable litigation expenses). Â \r\nThe\r\n  Department thereafter filed two appeals with this court.Â  In its first appeal,\r\n  the Department argued the circuit court erred in admitting evidence of an\r\n  expired unexercised option contract to prove the value of Hood's property.Â  This\r\n  court agreed, reversing and remanding the action to the circuit court.Â  See S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. Hood, 381 S.C. 318, 672 S.E.2d 595 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009). Â Prior to the issuance of this court's opinion, the Department filed the\r\n  instant appeal concerning attorney's fees.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on this court's reversal of the Department's initial appeal, we hold Hood is not\r\n  entitled to attorney's fees under section 28-2-510(B) because Hood is no longer\r\n  the prevailing party.\r\nVACATED.

Ballenger, of Walhalla, for Guardian Ad Litem.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  Patrice C. (Mother) appeals the family\r\n  courtâ€™s final order terminating her parental rights (TPR) to her two minor\r\n  children (Children).Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Mother contends the family court\r\n  erred in finding she failed to remedy conditions and that TPR was in Children's\r\n  best interests.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  grounds for TPR must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;Upon review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the\r\n  record as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination [of\r\n  parental rights].&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C.\r\n  602, 609, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â  However, despite our broad scope of\r\n  review, we are not required to disregard the findings of &quot;the family\r\n  court, who saw and heard the witnesses, [and] was in a better position to\r\n  evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.&quot;Â  Id. at 609, 582 S.E.2d at 423.Â  The family court may order TPR upon finding one or\r\n  more of eleven statutory grounds is satisfied and also finding TPR is in the\r\n  best interest of the child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2008).Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we note Mother only appeals from the finding that she failed to remedy\r\n  conditions.Â  She does not challenge the findings that she willfully failed to\r\n  support Children or Children were in foster care for fifteen of the most recent\r\n  twenty-two months.Â  Accordingly, these two findings are the law of the case,\r\n  and the dispositive issue is whether TPR was in Children's best interests.Â  See Sloan v. Dep't of Transp., 365 S.C. 299, 307, 618 S.E.2d 876, 880 (2005)\r\n  (&quot;The failure to appeal an alternative ground of the judgment below will\r\n  result in affirmance.&quot;).Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  TPR case, the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration.Â  S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000).Â  &quot;The interests of the child shall prevail\r\n  if the child's interest and the parental rights conflict.&quot; Â S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620 (2008).Â  \r\nWe find clear and convincing evidence in the record\r\n  supports the family court's finding that termination of Motherâ€™s parental\r\n  rights was in Children's best interests.Â  The trial court found that Mother was\r\n  not in a position to provide housing or financial support for Children because\r\n  she was in a treatment program for her drug addiction and both children had\r\n  special needs.Â  Although Mother was addressing her drug abuse problems by\r\n  attending Serenity Place, she had not yet remedied her drug addiction.Â \r\n  McMichael, the manager of Serenity Place, acknowledged it would take longer for\r\n  Mother to complete the treatment program, and she could not pinpoint when Mother\r\n  would be ready to take care of Children again. \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the record provided by Mother on appeal is too sparse to support a reversal of\r\n  the family court's findings on Children's best interests.Â  We do not know:Â  (1)\r\n  the extent of the bond between Mother and Children, (2) the frequency of\r\n  Mother's visitation with Children, (3) how Children were responding to foster\r\n  care, and (4) whether the Guardian ad Litem recommended TPR.Â  Mother has the\r\n  burden to provide a sufficient record for review on appeal.Â  See S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Sims, 359 S.C. 601, 606 n.3, 598 S.E.2d 303, 306\r\n  n.3 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Accordingly, the family court correctly determined TPR\r\n  was in Children's best interests.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KONDUROS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-175","title":"SCDSS v.
