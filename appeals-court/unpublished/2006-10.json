Macaulay, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-339\r\nSubmitted September 1, 2006 â€“ Filed October 3, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLarry A. Welborn, of Anderson, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam R. Harbison, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Charles Eckartz appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision affirming the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s (Commission) order finding Stone Creek Cove Homeowners Association, Inc., and Cincinnati Insurance Companies (hereinafter referred to jointly as â€œStone Creekâ€) are entitled to stop paying disability benefits related to Eckartzâ€™s headaches.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 4, 2001, while working at a restaurant owned by Stone Creek, Eckartz slipped and fell sustaining injuries to his right and left elbows.Â  Stone Creek agreed to pay Eckartz temporary disability benefits for the elbow injuries.Â  The single commissioner found Eckartzâ€™s elbows reached maximum medical improvement by November 11, 2001.Â  This finding was based on medical records from two treating physicians and Eckartzâ€™s own testimony.Â  \r\nOn January 10, 2002, Eckartz began experiencing severe headaches, which he attributed to a reaction to pain medication prescribed to treat his elbows.\r\nEckartz contends Stone Creek should continue paying disability benefits to treat his headache problems.Â  \r\nOn April 16, 2003, the single commissioner ordered Stone Creek to provide an independent medical examination to discern whether Eckartzâ€™s headaches were causally related to his work injury.Â  The commissioner also ordered Stone Creek to continue paying temporary benefits pending her determination as to whether Eckartzâ€™s headaches were casually related to his work injury.Â  \r\nDr. Paul Brill performed an independent medical exam of Eckartz.Â  Among other things, he administered a CT scan to determine the cause of Eckartzâ€™s headaches.Â  Unfortunately, this scan was not optimal because the images it produced were degraded due to Eckartzâ€™s movement during the procedure.Â  Apparently, Eckartz had a kidney stone that caused him too much discomfort to remain still.Â  On August 27, 2002, Dr. Brill stated he could â€œnot say with any degree of certainty that [Eckartzâ€™s] headaches are causally related to his work injury.â€Â  Dr. Brill recommended an MRI of the brain, an MRA of the Circle of Willis, and a complete ophthalmologic exam.[1]Â  As of September 4, 2003, after an MRI and an MRA exam, Dr. Brill was unable to give a decisive medical opinion as to the cause of Eckartzâ€™s headaches and reiterated his recommendation for a complete ophthalmologic exam. \r\nEckartz subsequently moved to southern Florida where he was scheduled for an eye exam in Fort Myers, Florida on December 23, 2003. Eckertz called the ophthalmologistâ€™s office on December 17, 2003 to reschedule that appointment for January 22, 2004.Â  Eckartz did not attend the appointment.Â  \r\nEckartz wrote a letter to the commissioner explaining he rescheduled due to a conflicting medical appointment.Â  He also claimed he did not know about the December 23, 2003 appointment until the day before.Â  Further, Eckartz asserted he did not go to the January 22, 2004 appointment because he was informed the commissioner stopped the test, and he could not personally afford the appointment.Â  Eckartz claimed part of his difficulties was due to his lack of transportation and his mail coming to him in â€œconvoluted ways.â€ \r\nOn October 28, 2003, the single commissioner found Dr. Brillâ€™s statements regarding causation to be incomplete and asked for a more complete analysis by Dr. Brill once the eye exam was performed.Â  The commissioner then found Eckartzâ€™s reasons for missing his eye appointments were not credible. Â The commissioner concluded Stone Creek was entitled to stop paying benefits as of September 26, 2002, because Eckartz refused treatment, and Stone Creek was entitled to a credit for any overpayment of disability benefits.Â  \r\nEckartz timely appealed the single commissionerâ€™s ruling to an appellate panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  The appellate panel affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s ruling.Â  Eckartz appealed that decision to the circuit court, which affirmed the panel.Â  Eckartz now appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act applies to appeals from decisions of the Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  In an appeal from the Commission, neither this Court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œAny review of the [C]ommissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€Â  Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Accordingly, we limit review to deciding whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Corbin, 351 S.C. at 617, 571 S.E.2d at 95.Â  Substantial evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the full commission reached.Â  Lockridge, 344 S.C. at 515, 544 S.E.2d at 844.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEckartz argues the circuit court erred in affirming the commissionâ€™s finding that he failed to provide substantial evidence causally relating his headaches to his work injuries and that he failed to provide a credible reason for not attending his medical appointments.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Commissionâ€™s appellate panel relied, in part, upon reports from Dr. Brill, who performed an independent medical evaluation on Eckartz.Â  Dr. Brill noted that Eckartzâ€™s MRI and MRA were normal and showed no evidence of an intracranial aneurysm.Â  Dr. Brill further opined that: \r\n\r\n[i]t would be somewhat atypical to develop sudden and such severe and persistent migraine headaches without some provoking factor . . . [but despite the normal MRI and MRA] his headaches could, in part, be due to his hypertension, and again, I feel it is important that we rule out any orbital pathology and assess his intra-ocular pressures with a complete ophthalmologic evaluation.\r\n\r\nAs of August 27, 2002, Dr. Brill could â€œnot say with any degree of certainty that [Eckartzâ€™s] headaches [were] causedly (sic) related to his work injury from 7-4-01.â€Â  \r\nOn Dr. Brillâ€™s recommendation and upon the commissionerâ€™s order, Stone Creek set up a complete ophthalmologic exam for Eckartz near his new home in Florida.Â  The Commissionâ€™s appellate panel found Eckartz rescheduled this eye exam and failed to appear for his rescheduled appointment.Â  The panel based its finding on Eckartzâ€™s own statements and on the records provided by the ophthalmologistâ€™s office.Â  \r\nFinally, the panel found Eckartzâ€™s reasons for missing the rescheduled eye exam appointment were not credible.Â  It based its decision on records from the doctorâ€™s office along with Eckartzâ€™s own testimony. Â The record and testimony showed Eckartz knew about the appointments and simply failed to keep them.Â  \r\nEckartz failed to provide any evidence that his headaches were a result of either his injuries or a reaction to pain medication.Â  Further, Dr. Brillâ€™s report found no evidence causally relating Eckartzâ€™s current condition to his work injury.Â  Therefore, the circuit court was correct in finding a lack of causal connection.Â  In addition, the record contains ample evidence, as noted above, to support the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that Eckartzâ€™s reasons for missing his doctorâ€™s appointments were not credible.\r\nEckartz also argues the circuit court misapplied South Carolina Code Ann. Section 42-15-60 (1985) in holding Eckartz must show he was justified in refusing treatment.Â  We disagree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Section 42-15-60 states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIn case of a controversy arising between employer and employee, the Commission may order such further medical, surgical, hospital or other treatment as may in the discretion of the Commission be necessary. . . . The refusal of an employee to accept any medical, hospital, surgical or other treatment when provided by the employer or ordered by the Commission shall bar such employee from further compensation until such refusal ceases. . . .\r\n\r\nEckartz now claims he ceased his refusal and would like to be examined by the ophthalmologist and continue receiving temporary disability benefits.Â  However, a workersâ€™ compensation award must not be based on surmise, conjecture, or speculation.Â  Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 81, 564 S.E.2d 354, 358 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  We find neither Eckartzâ€™s fall, nor a bad reaction to pain medication, could cause his alleged eye problem.Â  Dr. Brillâ€™s report merely speculated that Eckartzâ€™s condition could be caused by hypertension or optical problems.Â  In fact, Dr. Brillâ€™s September 4, 2003 report shows the results of the MRI and MRA were normal.\r\nOn September 4, 2003, Eckartzâ€™s condition was shown to be unrelated to his work injury of July 4, 2001.Â  The circuit court was justified in affirming the commissionâ€™s finding that based on Dr. Brillâ€™s opinion after the MRI and MRA, Eckartzâ€™s benefits should be terminated.Â  No evidence exists to the contrary. Â Therefore, the circuit court did not err in affirming the commissionerâ€™s decision to stop Eckartzâ€™s benefit payments.Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is\r\n AFFIRMED.

Cordell Maddox, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-340\r\nSubmitted September 1, 2006 â€“ Filed October 5, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWheeler M. Tillman, of North Charleston, Pro Se.\r\nMichael A. Jones, of Durham, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Wheeler Tillman brought suit against his former client, Joe Grant, to recover attorneyâ€™s fees under a fee agreement.Â  The agreement provided if Grant fired Tillman before settlement or a verdict, Tillman would receive a contingency percentage of the settlement or an hourly fee, whichever was more.Â  The trial court found the amount due under the hourly rate was unreasonable and awarded Tillman attorneyâ€™s fees equal to the contingency percentage.Â  Tillman appeals arguing he is entitled to the hourly rate.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 3, 1998, Grant, his sister, and his brother-in-law were involved in a motor vehicle collision with a tractor-trailer. Â Grant[1] hired Tillman to represent him in a personal injury action he brought against the trucking company.[2] Â On April 1, 1999, Grant and Tillman signed an attorney/client contract.Â  The relevant portion of the contract provided:\r\n\r\nIn the event that I fire my Attorney before settlement or verdict, then I agree to pay my Attorney at the rate of $175.00 per chargeable hour for the work which he has performed in my case, or an amount equal to the contingent percentage set forth in this Contract multiplied by the highest offer made, whichever amount is greater.\r\n\r\nThe contingency percentage was set at forty percent.Â  \r\nOn March 26, 2003, near the end of the first day of trial in the personal injury action, Grant agreed in court to settle the case for $90,000.Â  The trial court declared that the â€œterms of the settlement were placed on the record and the parties acknowledged their consent to settle.â€Â  The trucking company issued a settlement check and prepared a general release, which it delivered to Tillman.[3]Â  \r\nOn numerous occasions, Tillman attempted to contact Grant to have him sign the release.Â  However, Grant did not respond to any of his phone calls or letters.Â  Eventually, the trucking company made a motion to compel settlement.Â  On June 6, 2003, the trial court granted the motion.Â  Tillman still attempted to contact Grant to no avail.Â  Approximately one month after the trial court granted the motion to compel settlement, Grant called Tillman and agreed to meet the following day.Â  At the meeting, Grant requested copies of deposition transcripts and refused to sign the release.Â  Â Â \r\nOn July 8, 2003, the trial court issued a rule to show cause against Grant for his failure to sign the release.Â  At the rule to show cause hearing on July 21, 2003, Grant again refused to sign the release and fired Tillman.Â  The trial court allowed Grant a continuance in order for Grant to obtain new counsel.Â  \r\nOn November 18, 2003, Tillman filed suit against Grant for breach of contract.Â  Tillman alleged he spent 353.8 hours on Grantâ€™s case and Grant owed him $61,915 in attorneyâ€™s fees under the hourly rate and $8,320.12 in costs.Â  Additionally, Tillman requested reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in bringing the collection action.Â  After Grant failed to serve an answer, Tillman filed an application for default judgment against Grant.Â  The trial court found Grant in default.Â  Further, the trial court found the amount Tillman would be entitled to under the hourly rate was excessive, unreasonable, and unconscionable.Â  In determining the amount was unreasonable, the trial court applied the following factors: â€œ(1) nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency and compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.â€Â  The court awarded Tillman the amount he would have received under the contingency agreement, $36,000. Â The court also awarded Tillman the costs he incurred in the personal injury matter as well as the attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in bringing the collection action.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA suit to recover attorneyâ€™s fees is an action at law. Â Weatherford v. Price, 340 S.C. 572, 578, 532 S.E.2d 310, 313 (Ct. App. 2000). Â \r\n\r\nAn action by an attorney for compensation, whether on a written contingency agreement or on a quasi-contractual obligation to pay the reasonable value of services prior to its breach, sounds in contract.Â  The proper form of action by which to enforce payment, generally, is by an action at law on the contract . . . .\r\n\r\nLester v. Dawson, 327 S.C. 263, 268, 491 S.E.2d 240, 242 (1997).Â  On appeal of an action at law tried without a jury, the factual findings of the trial court will not be disturbed unless found to be without any evidence which reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s findings.Â \r\nTownes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). Â Additionally, the appellate court can correct errors of law.Â  Okatie River, L.L.C. v. S.E. Site Prep,\r\nL.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d 468, 472 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTillman claims the trial court abused its discretion in failing to determine the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees according to the hourly rate and in failing to make specific findings of fact. Â We disagree.\r\nThe relationship between an attorney and client is by nature a fiduciary one. Â Hotz v. Minyard, 304 S.C. 225, 230, 403 S.E.2d 634, 637 (1991); see also \r\nWeatherford v. Price, 340 S.C. 572, 582, 532 S.E.2d 310, 315 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œThe relationship of an attorney with his or her client is highly fiduciary in its nature and of a very delicate, exacting and confidential character, requiring a high degree of fidelity and good faith.â€). Â The courts examine agreements between attorneys and clients with the utmost care to avoid any improper advantage to the attorney.Â \r\nRoyal Crown Bottling Co. v. Chandler, 226 S.C. 94, 105, 83 S.E.2d 745, 750 (1954).Â  In the interest of the profession, the court has the jurisdiction â€œto see that an attorney will not lower his profession by cheapness, nor promote his own interest by extortion, as well as to the safeguarding of the trust relation which an attorney bears to the public.â€Â \r\nBank of Enoree v. Yarborough, 120 S.C. 385, 393, 113 S.E. 313, 315 (1922).Â  Therefore, the court will not allow attorneys to impose excessive charges on their clients because attorneys owe the public a duty of trust.Â \r\nColey v. Coley, 94 S.C. 383, 386, 77 S.E. 49, 50 (1913).Â  The factors a trial court should consider in determining reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees are:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; (2) time and labor devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) fee customarily charged in the locality for similar services; and (6) beneficial results obtained.\r\n\r\nBlumberg v. Nealco Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 494, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1993).\r\nWe have reviewed the record, including Tillmanâ€™s time sheets from the personal injury action, and in light of the Blumberg factors listed above, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the contingency fee. &nbsp;In comparing the contingency fee to the hourly fees, we find the hourly fees were excessive because they nearly doubled the amount due under the contingency agreement.&nbsp; Further, the hourly fees would have nearly exhausted Grantâ€™s settlement of $90,000. Â In our view, the contingency fee provided Tillman with just compensation for his services.&nbsp; Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s award of the contingency fee instead of the hourly rate was not an abuse of discretion. [4]\r\nTillman claims the trial court abused its discretion by not awarding him attorneyâ€™s fees for his services rendered to Grant after he agreed to settle in court until he fired Tillman.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe contingency fee encompasses all fees owed to Tillman in the underlying personal injury suit.Â  Therefore, it would have been improper for the trial court to award Tillman additional fees in the same action when it determined that awarding Tillman more than the contingency clause would be unreasonable.Â  However, it was proper for the trial court to award Tillman costs for his time spent attempting to collect his fees.Â  The current collection action is distinctly different from the personal injury action.Â  Because Grantâ€™s behavior caused Tillman to spend time collecting a fee that was rightfully his, the court was justified in awarding Tillman reasonable damages.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Tillman the contingency fee instead of a fee based on an hourly rate.Â  It is incumbent on the trial court to examine attorneyâ€™s fees to ensure they are not unreasonable.Â  The trial court found that the fee would be unreasonable and excessive, if it was determined by the hourly rate.Â  Evidence in the record supports such a finding.Â  Therefore, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.[5]Â \r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Grantâ€™s sister and brother-in-law brought suit with Tillman as their attorney as well.Â  They behaved in the same manner as Grant: agreeing to settle, not responding to Tillmanâ€™s attempts at contact, and firing the attorneys just before settling.Â  This suit involves only the attorneyâ€™s fees for Grantâ€™s case.\r\n[2] Before Grant hired Tillman, he hired other attorneys to represent him in the personal injury action.Â  He fired the first attorney, and the second one withdrew.Â  Grant then hired Michael Rose, who associated Tillman to be lead counsel in the case.Â  Rose and Tillman also associated Tom Johnson for the case.Â  Rose and Johnson are not involved in Tillmanâ€™s lawsuit.\r\n[3] Some confusion exists regarding the settlement draft or check.Â  Grant claims he never saw the settlement draft while Tillman claims he asked Grant to sign it, but it eventually expired and had to be returned to the trucking company.Â  \r\n[4] Further, we note Tillman originally sought only the contingency fee.Â  It was not until Grant refused to release Tillmanâ€™s payment from the settlement that Tillman sought the hourly fees.Â  It is apparent from the record that Tillman grew frustrated with Grant, and this suit arose out of that frustration.\r\n[5] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-341","title":"State v.

Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia, Cecil Kelly Jackson, Third Circuit Solicitor's Office, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tyrone Rouse appeals his convictions for armed robbery, kidnapping, and possessing a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Rouse argues the trial court should have directed a verdict of not guilty based on insufficient evidence.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 5, 2001, four or five masked men entered a Burger King Restaurant in Sumter, South Carolina.Â  After closing time, the men entered through the restaurantâ€™s back door as one employee attempted to exit to take out the trash.Â  Once inside, the men held that employee on the floor, forced another employee inside the walk-in freezer, and held the manager at gunpoint while they stole over $4000. \r\nAfter the men left, the manager reported the robbery to the police. Â One patrol officer heard the call and drove around the area looking for any suspicious cars.Â  After a few minutes, he spotted a car with five occupants and began to follow the car.Â  He noticed that once his patrol car pulled up behind the car, all of the passengers appeared to slump down in their seats so as to not be seen. Â The car obeyed all traffic laws and stopped for over thirty seconds at stop signs, despite a lack of traffic.Â  Eventually, the car pulled into a driveway and as the officer stopped behind it, all of the carâ€™s occupants exited the vehicle and fled.Â  The patrol officer found, among other things, masks, a gun, and a cell phone in the car. Â During the ensuing investigation, police officers discovered a bank deposit bag, a Burger King deposit slip, some rolled quarters, and fingerprints on the carâ€™s interior and exterior.Â  \r\nMonths later, Marcus Wright, the employee who attempted to take the trash out during the Burger King robbery, was fired for stealing from the register.Â  That attempted theft apparently raised suspicion that Marcus was involved in the earlier robbery.Â  Two days later, the police arrested Marcus for his involvement as an accessory in the Burger King robbery.Â  After his arrest, Marcus gave a statement to police implicating Quinton Weldon, Samuel Dinkins, Aaron Rouse, and Tyrone Rouse in the Burger King robbery.Â  \r\nAt trial, Marcus Wright and Aaron Rouse, Tyrone Rouseâ€™s brother, testified that Tyrone participated in the robbery. Â Also at trial, Officer Brett Baker testified the police lifted Tyrone Rouseâ€™s fingerprints from the driverâ€™s side, side-view mirror of the get-away car.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTyrone Rouse argues the trial court erred in denying a motion for a directed verdict of not guilty based on insufficient evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen analyzing the denial of a directed verdict motion, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).Â  â€œThe trial court, in a directed verdict motion, is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not with its weight.â€Â  State v. Elmore, 368 S.C. 230, 234, 628 S.E.2d 271, 273 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The trial court must be affirmed if the record contains any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Avery, 333 S.C. 284, 509 S.E.2d 476 (1998); State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 274, 400 S.E.2d 131 (1991).\r\nâ€œUnder the â€˜hand of one is the hand of allâ€™ theory of accomplice liability, one who joins with another to accomplish an illegal purpose is criminally liable for everything done by his confederate incidental to the execution of the common design and purpose.â€Â  State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 194, 562 S.E.2d 320, 324 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Armed Robbery \r\nTyrone Rouse was convicted of armed robbery, kidnapping, and possessing a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Armed robbery is a â€œrobbery while armed with a pistol, dirk, slingshot, metal knuckles, razor or other deadly weapon.â€Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330 (2003).Â  In addition, armed robbery is defined as a violent crime.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-60 (2006).Â  Burger Kingâ€™s manager, Robert Horton, as well as Amy Fullard, the employee who was trapped in the freezer, along with Marcus Wright and Aaron Rouse testified as eye witnesses that at least one gun was used in the robbery.Â  Police provided evidence at trial which tends to link Tyrone to this crime.Â  The officers found Tyroneâ€™s fingerprints on the outside of the get-away car as well as a gun and masks inside the car.Â  The subsequent investigation revealed a bank deposit slip, rolls of quarters similar to the ones stolen from the Burger King, and a bank deposit bag.Â  The trial court found a combination of direct evidence and substantial circumstantial evidence linking Tyrone Rouse to the robbery.\r\nB. Kidnapping\r\nKidnapping is defined as a violent crime pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Section 16-1-60 (2006).Â  A person is guilty of kidnapping if he unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away any other person by any means whatsoever without authority of law.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â  16-3-910 (2003).Â  Kidnapping â€œcommences when one is wrongfully deprived of freedom and continues until freedom is restored.â€Â  State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 13, 512 S.E.2d 99, 105 (1999); See State v. Vazsquez, 364 S.C. 293, 613 S.E.2d 359 (2005) (Vazsquez was found guilty of kidnapping after he forced two restaurant employees into the restaurantâ€™s freezer and closed the door).Â  At trial, Robert Horton, Amy Fullard, Marcus Wright, and Aaron Rouse testified that Amy was placed in the walk-in freezer with the door closed.Â  Thus, the trial court found direct evidence linking Tyrone Rouse to the kidnapping.\r\nC. Possessing a Firearm During the Commission of a Violent Crime\r\nArmed robbery and kidnapping are violent crimes pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Section 16-1-60 (2006).Â  Because at least one gun was used to rob Burger King, the elements of possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime are satisfied.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490 (2003).Â  Robert Horton, Amy Fullard, Marcus Wright, and Aaron Rouse testified that a gun was used during the Burger King robbery. Â In addition, police found a gun, ski masks, and other evidence in the car used by the assailants after the robbery.Â  Again, the trial court found direct and substantial circumstantial evidence linking Tyrone Rouse to the crime of possessing a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe State presented direct evidence that Tyrone Rouse and his accomplices committed the crimes charged.Â  Under the â€œhand of one is the hand of allâ€ theory of accomplice liability, it makes no difference whether Tyrone Rouse was the person who actually held a gun or forced Amy Fullard into the freezer, as long as it is proven that one of his accomplices committed the act according to their common purpose. As to the armed robbery and possessing a firearm during the commission of a violent crime charges, the State provided circumstantial evidence in addition to direct evidence implicating Tyrone Rouse in the crimes.Â  Therefore, the trial court was justified in denying Rouseâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]Â \r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-342","title":"SCDSS v.

Corrigan, III, of Charleston, for Guardian Ad\r\nLitem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Jane Doe (Mother) and Richard Roe (Father) appeal the termination of their parental rights (TPR) to their minor children.[1]Â  We affirm.[2]  \r\nFACTS\r\nMother and Father are the biological parents of three minor children.Â  Mother is also the parent of a fourth minor child, whose father is unknown and identified in these proceedings as John Doe.[3]Â  \r\nOn September 12, 2002, the parentsâ€™ two-year old son cut his arm on broken glass while playing unattended in the familyâ€™s yard.Â  The child received emergency treatment at a local hospital, which notified the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) that a possible child neglect situation existed.Â  DSS immediately investigated the family residence, where it discovered generally squalid and unsafe conditions.Â  DSS also found Mother was unable to control the children and was rearing them alone while Father remained incarcerated on pending charges related to his alleged rape of an eighty-year old woman. \r\nThe family court held a removal hearing on September 13, 2002. Mother voluntarily placed the children in DSS custody and admitted exposing them to â€œa threat of harm of physical neglect.â€ The family court ordered a treatment plan requiring, among other things, that Mother provide a safe and stable home for the children, undergo a mental health assessment, secure stable employment, and complete anger management counseling.Â  The plan required both parents to undergo psychological evaluations to assess their parenting abilities, submit to substance abuse assessments, and repair and clean the family residence.Â  Additionally, the plan required the parents to successfully complete domestic violence counseling if they resumed cohabitation.Â  This order was not appealed.\r\nIn July 2003, Father was released from jail after his alleged victim died and the charges against him were subsequently dismissed.Â  He then moved back into the family residence, returned to work, and began participating in his treatment plan. Â In particular, he made improvements to the family residence to make it safer for the children, engaged in the required counseling, and submitted to drug screenings.\r\nThe family court returned physical custody of the children to the parents on February 9, 2004.Â  At the time, Mother and Father had made improvements to the family residence to make it safer for the children to inhabit.Â  However, the court found Mother was incapable of caring for the children alone and returned the children on the condition that Father be available to care for the children while at home.Â  Â Â \r\nOn the evening of June 23, 2004, Father was stabbed while shooting pool at a local club. Â Thereafter, he was hospitalized for several days.Â  No other family members appeared genuinely willing to help Mother care for the children, so the parties agreed to return physical custody of the children to foster care.Â  Â Â \r\nFather tested positive for alcohol use in a September 2004 drug screening.Â  In December 2004, he tested positive for cocaine use in a hair follicle test.Â  He was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) that same month and later pled guilty to the charge.Â  Mother abandoned her treatment plan in December 2004 and moved to Dalton, Georgia, where she had previously lived.Â  Father also abandoned his treatment plan.\r\nDSS initiated the present action in February 2005.Â  A merits hearing on the TPR action took place on August 16, 2005.Â  At that hearing, DSS presented testimony from a psychologist, a foster care worker, and counselors familiar with the case.Â  Mother and Father testified.Â  The childrenâ€™s guardian ad litem also testified.\r\nDSS provided the deposition of Dr. Robert W. Noelker, a clinical psychologist who examined Mother and Father shortly after the children were taken into DSS custody.Â  Dr. Noelker diagnosed Mother as a special needs adult with mild mental retardation and brain damage possibly caused by oxygen deprivation suffered when she was in a house fire as a small child.Â  He also diagnosed Mother with depression and anxiety.Â  Dr. Noelker added Mother was functionally and occupationally illiterate, with essentially no reading, spelling, or basic math skills.Â  He opined that, given Motherâ€™s â€œmultiple deficits,â€ she would â€œnever be able to independently parent her minor children,â€ regardless of rehabilitation provided by DSS.Â  Instead, Mother would â€œbe much like another child in home that would need direction and guidanceâ€ from another adult and â€œwould not be capable of providing meaningful daily regulation or interaction for her children.â€ Â Â \r\nDr. Noelker diagnosed Father with polysubstance dependence and antisocial personality disorder.Â  He testified that a person with an antisocial personality disorder typically lacks a conscience, tends to be impulsive and self-interested, and tends to â€œrepetitively get into trouble with the law or social entities.â€Â  Dr. Noelker recommended that, at a minimum, Father secure adequate employment and engage in parent effectiveness classes, random drug and alcohol screening, outpatient substance abuse treatment, and outpatient psychotherapy.Â  However, given Fatherâ€™s extensive legal history and the tendency of those with antisocial personality disorder to resist change, Dr. Noelker predicted Father was â€œunlikely to be compliant and that his prognosis would continue to be poor.â€Â  \r\nJanie Snow, a clinical counselor from the Williamsburg County Department on Alcohol and Drug Abuse, testified about treatment her agency provided Mother and Father.Â  According to Snow, her agencyâ€™s initial assessment of Mother indicated she was cocaine dependent.Â  Snow testified Mother successfully completed inpatient drug addiction treatment in the summer of 2003, and had not since tested positive for drug use.Â  However, Snow testified Motherâ€™s efforts at parenting classes, coupleâ€™s counseling, and anger management counseling were unsuccessful.Â  The agency stopped providing services to Mother when she threatened to kill Snow in September 2004.Â  Mother never successfully completed the counseling ordered by her treatment plan, according to Snow. Â Â \r\nSnow also testified about services Father received from her agency, and primarily chronicled Fatherâ€™s series of approximately forty drug screenings from May 2003 through December 2004.Â  Snow stated Father tested positive for alcohol in at least two screenings, with the most recent positive result occurring on September 24, 2004.Â  According to Snow, Father more often than not tested negatively for drug use.Â  On many occasions, however, the tests would yield a positive result at the screening site, but later yield a negative result when the same samples were tested again at an off-site lab.Â  Snow attributed the disparities to variances in testing techniques used, stating on-site testing would indicate positive results if â€œthere was any cocaine in [the subjectâ€™s] system,â€ but the off-site lab would not indicate a positive result unless the subject had a higher level of drugs in his system.Â  Regardless, off-site lab results from urine samples indicated Father tested positive for cocaine on at least three occasions, and a hair follicle test yielded a positive result for cocaine on December 1, 2004.Â  Snow testified Father stopped attending substance abuse counseling after being charged with DUI in December 2004.Â  Snowâ€™s agency continued to offer substance abuse counseling services to Father and notified him of counseling appointments.Â  However, Father failed to respond to the notices, and the agency consequently closed his file. \r\nGloria Davis, the DSS foster care worker who handled the familyâ€™s case, testified that when she first visited the family residence, it smelled of urine and feces and was in a â€œstate of disrepairâ€ with broken windows and rotted flooring.Â  Davis testified the house had a broken toilet, refrigerator, and oven.Â  Flies and roaches crawled over a partially-eaten hamburger left on the kitchen counter, no linens were on the beds, and clothing was strewn on the floor, according to Davis.Â  She found almost no food in the house, although Mother received food stamps.Â  In the yard, Davis found broken glass and a dangerous fence with barbed wire.Â  \r\nAccording to Davis, Mother â€œyelled and screamed at the children, cried uncontrollably, and had no . . . control over the children.â€Â  Davis testified the minor children knowingly controlled and manipulated Mother.Â  Father was their primary caretaker, Davis opined, because Mother was incapable of caring for them alone due to her mental disabilities and lack of family support.Â  Under the circumstances, returning the children to the parentsâ€™ custody depended on Fatherâ€™s availability to help rear the children.\r\nDavis testified Father was initially unable to participate in his treatment program because he was incarcerated, but after his release he became â€œvigorously involvedâ€ in his treatment plan.Â  Among other things, he made necessary repairs to the family residence, resumed regular employment, submitted to a psychological evaluation, submitted to drug and alcohol abuse assessments, participated in mental health counseling and drug court, and successfully completed inpatient drug and alcohol rehabilitation.Â  However, she stated Father continued to test positive for drug use and failed to complete outpatient drug treatment, drug court, or mental health counseling.Â  In December 2004, Father was incarcerated over Christmas after his arrest for DUI, according to Davis.Â  She added Father had not since participated in the required drug testing or counseling.Â  According to Davis, Father continued to visit the children monthly and sometimes provide meals and entertainment.Â  \r\nDavis indicated the conditions that led to the childrenâ€™s removal would not likely be remedied because Motherâ€™s problems were rooted in mental health issues that limited her ability to care for her children and no compelling evidence suggested her family or anyone else was forthcoming with the support needed.Â  Likewise, Fatherâ€™s condition impeded his ability to provide the support Mother needed to be a reliable parent independently.Â  Moreover, the parties separated and no evidence suggested a likelihood of reconciliation.Â Â  Davis opined terminating the parentsâ€™ rights to the minor children would be in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  \r\nSarah Reynolds, a registered nurse who served as a case manager and clinical counselor at the Waccamaw Center for Mental Health (Waccamaw), testified about mental health services Waccamaw provided Mother.Â  According to Reynolds, Mother was first referred to Waccamaw by DSS for Family Preservation counseling.Â  Reynolds testified Mother was diagnosed as being mildly mentally retarded, but Motherâ€™s initial treatment was cancelled because of her unwillingness to participate.Â  The drug court later referred Mother for additional counseling and psychiatric treatment.Â  Reynolds characterized Motherâ€™s compliance with Waccamawâ€™s services as â€œunpredictable,â€ noting Mother cancelled appointments and failed to properly take psychiatric medication prescribed under her treatment plan.Â  For example, she once flushed the medicine down a toilet and on another occasion overdosed on the medicine in a failed suicide attempt.Â  Waccamaw stopped treating Mother when she moved to Georgia in December 2004, Reynolds stated.Â  She opined Mother would need mental health treatment â€œindefinitelyâ€ and 24-hour a day help rearing the children, â€œbecause if she has an outburst anything could possibly happen that may be harmful to herself or others.â€Â  \r\nMother testified on her own behalf.Â  She expressed a love for her children and described their removal as a â€œnightmare.â€Â  She testified that she lived in an apartment in Dalton, Georgia, where she regularly spent time with her parents, siblings, and friends.Â  Mother testified she remained drug free but she had otherwise been unable to get her life back on track. \r\nFather testified he had taken numerous steps to regain custody of his children, including securing steady employment and repairing the family residence to make it safer for the children.Â  He stated he took the children on outings, provided occasional meals and gifts, and sometimes gave the foster parent money.Â  However, he admittedly stopped complying with his treatment plan in January 2005 based on his belief that DSS had arranged to place the children with Motherâ€™s family in Georgia.Â  \r\nFather admitted he was addicted to drugs and alcohol but denied having used cocaine since approximately December 2004.Â  Father claimed he was attending counseling sessions to help him deal with both problems, but later admitted he had only been to one counseling session in the previous eight months.Â  Father admitted using cocaine shortly after his release from jail on the dismissed rape charges.Â  Father also admitted using cocaine in November or December of 2004, but disputed the results of the hair follicle test that indicated he used cocaine in December 2004.Â  When asked about numerous positive results he received on some of his random drug screenings, Father attempted to excuse the results as a health condition. Â Â \r\nFather testified regarding his past legal woes, offering excuses for charges he had faced in the past.Â  Among other things, he testified to spending time in jail for rape charges that were dropped, a DUI charge to which he pled guilty, and charges he had stolen approximately $14,000 from his grandfather, which were also dropped.Â  He also admitted he was jailed on a bench warrant for failing to pay court fines related to his DUI.Â  Â Â \r\nFather also testified about his stabbing, which he claimed occurred at a club where he was playing pool and drinking non-alcoholic beer while waiting to conduct business with the clubâ€™s owner.Â  According to Father, a woman with whom he was playing pool stabbed him.Â  Father indicated the woman harbored anger toward him because on the previous day Father had intervened in an altercation between the woman and her boyfriend.Â  \r\nThe childrenâ€™s guardian ad litem, Bennett McCollough, described the children as being â€œa handful,â€ and noted they had been diagnosed with â€œhyperactive attention deficiency.â€Â  He opined that the children loved their parents, but they also loved their foster mother and referred to her as â€œmother.â€Â  McCullough testified the children were â€œsadâ€ for Mother and â€œrecognized that she was not able to control them.â€Â  He added that Father was capable of caring for the children â€œif he would stay out of troubleâ€ and not abuse drugs, but advised he would not recommend giving Father additional time to pursue a treatment plan.Â  McCullough testified he believed the children were better off living with their foster mother, and that neither of their natural parents could provide the stability the children needed.Â  McCullough specifically testified terminating Mother and Fatherâ€™s parental rights was in the best interests of the children. \r\nOn September 9, 2005, the family court issued an order terminating the parental rights of Mother and Father.Â  The court based its termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights on findings of neglect too severe and repetitious to likely be remedied within six months; failure to remedy the conditions leading to the childrenâ€™s removal by successfully completing counseling specified in her treatment plan; and the fact that she had been diagnosed with conditions of mental retardation, adjustment disorder, anxiety, and depression that prevented her from competently parenting her children alone and her diagnosed conditions would not likely change within a reasonable time.Â  The family court terminated Fatherâ€™s parental rights on the basis of neglect too severe and repetitious to likely be remedied within six months; failure to remedy the conditions leading to the childrenâ€™s removal by successfully completing counseling specified in his treatment plan; and the fact that he had been diagnosed with conditions of drug dependency and antisocial behavior that rendered him incapable of providing minimally acceptable care for the minor children and his condition was not likely to change within a reasonable time because he had stopped drug counseling months earlier.Â  The family court also terminated their parental rights based on its finding that the minor children had been in foster care under DSS custody for at least fifteen of the preceding twenty-two months.Â  Finally, the court found terminating Mother and Fatherâ€™s parental rights to be in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  These consolidated appeals followed.Â  Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR action, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before parental rights can be forever terminated, the alleged grounds for the termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 357, 296 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1982); S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, however, we should not necessarily disregard the findings of the family court, because the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony. Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Motherâ€™s Appeal \r\n\r\nA.&nbsp; Adequacy of Motherâ€™s Treatment Plan\r\n\r\nMother argues the family court erred in finding she failed to complete her treatment plan. Specifically, Mother alleges the plan was â€œinadequate given the circumstancesâ€ because it required her to rely on assistance from third parties. Â She also argues that when DSS learned of her diagnosed conditions it should have modified her treatment plan to enable her to successfully complete the plan.Â  We disagree. \r\nAs an initial matter, we note Mother never made this argument before the family court, so the issue is arguably unpreserved for appellate review. See Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 369, 489 S.E.2d 212, 217 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating an issue must be\r\nraised to and ruled on by the family court to be preserved for appellate review). Instead, the record indicates she continuously agreed to the treatment plan as defined at the initial removal hearing and as later modified.Â  The relevant orders reflect Mother agreed to the treatment planâ€™s terms, found the treatment plan complied with statutory requirements, and was â€œfair, equitable, reasonable, and . . . in the best interests of the minor children.â€Â  Furthermore, the family court consistently used â€œreasonableâ€ to describe DSSâ€™s efforts to help Mother remedy the problems that caused the childrenâ€™s removal.Â  Because Mother agreed to the terms of the treatment plan and never challenged them at the trial level, she consequently waived the right to challenge the planâ€™s terms on appeal. \r\nAssuming Motherâ€™s issue is preserved, we, nevertheless, find it lacks merit. Â Mother argues the treatment plan was deficient because it made her ability to comply with the plan â€œcontingent upon the actions of third partiesâ€ such as Father and her family. Â Although Motherâ€™s love for her children is beyond question and her circumstances are tragic, the record contains ample evidence supporting the family courtâ€™s finding that Mother could not competently rear the children alone.Â  In particular, Dr. Noelker testified Mother would never be able to provide minimally acceptable care for her minor children without â€œa functional and capable adult to assist her on a daily basis.â€Â  Testimony from Davis and McCullough also support the courtâ€™s finding that Mother could not independently care for the children.Â  Additionally, Father opined at trial that Mother could not care for the children alone. Â Mother did not dispute their testimony at trial, nor does she challenge their veracity on appeal. Â \r\nWe note DSS unsuccessfully attempted to place the children with Motherâ€™s relatives in Georgia, but social services workers there investigated the relativesâ€™ homes and found they had no serious interest in helping Mother care for the children. Â Moreover, the Georgia authorities stated the home of the childrenâ€™s maternal grandparents was not an appropriate place for the children to be placed because a child had previously been removed from their home following abuse and neglect allegations, and the grandparents were unable to make the changes needed to regain custody.\r\nAccordingly, we find Motherâ€™s treatment plan reasonable, and the family court did not err in terminating her parental rights for failing to complete the treatment plan.[4] Â \r\n\r\n B.&nbsp; Best Interests of the Children\r\n\r\nMother also alleges the court erred in finding termination of her parental rights was in the minor childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  She generally speculates the termination â€œcould be proved to be very harmful to the childrenâ€ and â€œis the equivalent of â€˜killing the motherâ€™ whom they presumably love and share a bond.â€Â  Without questioning Motherâ€™s love for her children, we find the record includes ample evidence to support the family courtâ€™s finding that terminating her parental rights is in her minor childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  In addition to the recommendations of her DSS counselor and the childrenâ€™s guardian ad litem, we find it clear from the record that Mother is not capable of providing the level of care needed by the children.Â  Their foster mother of three years undisputedly provided the level of care they needed, and testimony shows they have bonded with her and respond more positively to her parenting.Â  The evidentiary record demonstrates that the family court did not err in terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights.\r\nII.&nbsp; Fatherâ€™s Appeal\r\nFather argues the family court erred in terminating his parental rights on the grounds that (1) he failed to remedy conditions that led to their removal, (2) failed to support the children, (3) had a diagnosable condition that prevented him from providing minimally acceptable care to the children, and that was not likely to change within a reasonable period of time; and (4) the children had been in DSS foster care custody for at least fifteen of the preceding twenty-two months.Â  He does not dispute the courtâ€™s finding that terminating his parental rights is in the best of interests of his minor children.\r\n\r\nA.&nbsp; Failure to Remedy \r\n\r\nFather contends the childrenâ€™s removal was predicated on factors that occurred while he was incarcerated, to wit:Â  the condition of the family residence and physical neglect of the minor children.Â  Father maintains that after he was released, he made necessary repairs to the residence and â€œsubstantially completed other aspects of his treatment plan.â€Â  Consequently, Father argues the family court erred in terminating his parental rights for failing to remedy conditions that led to their removal.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nIt is undisputed that Father complied with his treatment plan to the extent he maintained stable employment and made necessary physical repairs and improvements to the family residence.Â  However, the treatment plan also required parent effectiveness classes, negative results on random drug and alcohol screenings, and counseling to address issues related to Fatherâ€™s diagnosed conditions of drug abuse and antisocial personality disorder.Â  Father concedes he ceased all required counseling shortly after testing positive for cocaine use in a hair follicle test and being charged with DUI in December 2004, but argues he â€œsubstantially completedâ€ the counseling components of his treatment plan.Â  We do not find this argument compelling.Â  In particular, we note Dr. Noelker described the treatment plan recommendations as â€œbasically minimum recommendations that would be required in order to consider reunificationâ€ of Father with his minor children.Â  Although Father made progress in many aspects of his treatment plan, he clearly relapsed in December 2004 and essentially abandoned his treatment plan from that time forward.\r\n\r\nB.&nbsp; Failure to Support \r\n\r\nFather maintains the family court erred in terminating his parental rights on the basis that he failed to support his children, because he was never ordered to pay child support, but nevertheless made a material contribution to the children by providing in-kind support of gifts, meals, clothing, money, and entertainment.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs an initial matter, it is not clear from the order that the family court terminated Fatherâ€™s grounds on this basis.Â  Â In paragraph fifteen of its order, the family court provided:\r\n\r\nThe Defendant minor children have been harmed as defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-490[(2)](c) in that [Father] failed to supply adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, supervision, or health care though financially able to do so or offered financial or other reasonable means to do so, and because of the severity or repetition of the neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve (12) months. \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  This language suggests the court is terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights under section 20-7-490(1) of the South Carolina Code, which provides for TPR where a child has been neglected, and because of the severity or repetition of the neglect, the court deems it reasonably unlikely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.Â  However, paragraph fifteen concludes with a specific reference to section 20-7-1572(4) of the South Carolina Code, which provides grounds for termination for willful failure to provide material support to oneâ€™s child. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) (Supp. 2005). Also, the â€œneglectâ€ referenced by the family court largely related to support issues, such as providing food, clothing, and shelter.\r\n&nbsp;Regardless, we find the family court properly granted TPR on either basis, both of which were raised in DSSâ€™s pleadings.Â  First, Father does not specifically dispute the family courtâ€™s order that his failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, supervision, or health care constituted neglect.Â  Thus, it is the law of the case.Â  See Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 300, 513 S.E.2d 358, 369 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating in TPR action an unchallenged ruling by the family court becomes law of the case).Â  Instead, Father focuses his argument on whether the contributions he made to the children rise to the level of a â€œmaterial contributionâ€ sufficient to overcome TPR under section 20-7-1572(4).Â  \r\n&nbsp;A â€œmaterial contributionâ€ is defined as â€œeither financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4).Â  â€œToys are not included in this definition and will not be considered by us in concluding whether Appellant made a material contribution to Children.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 630, 627 S.E.2d 718, 722 (2006).Â  Here, the record indicates Father was gainfully employed but at most only occasionally provided the children meals and gave them games and â€œlittle nick nack stuff.â€Â  The record includes no evidence that Father provided clothing or other necessities to the children during their stay in DSS custody, except for Fathersâ€™ testimony that he had sporadically given the foster parent money for the children.Â  However, Father testified that, at the time of the hearing, he had not â€œreally financially [been] contributingâ€ to the children because he was making repairs to his house, which had been damaged by a kitchen fire.Â  He also admitted having recently purchased end tables, lamps, and â€œa new leather setâ€ of furniture for his home.Â  Based on the forgoing evidence, we find Father had the means to make a material contribution to his children but willfully failed to provide such support.\r\n\r\nC.&nbsp; Diagnosable Condition \r\n\r\nFather argues the family court erred in terminating his parental rights on the basis that he had a diagnosable condition that rendered him unable to provide minimally acceptable care for his minor children, and that the condition was unlikely to change in a reasonable period of time.Â  We disagree.\r\nDr. Noelker diagnosed Father as being drug dependent and having an antisocial personality disorder, and opined both conditions rendered him incapable of providing minimally adequate care to his minor children.Â  The family court subsequently approved a treatment plan based on what Dr. Noelker described as â€œbasically minimum recommendations that would be required to consider reunification.â€Â  Father does not dispute his failure to successfully complete the entire treatment program.Â  Instead, he argues he completed necessary repairs to the family residence and otherwise substantially completed the program.Â  He focuses his argument primarily on drug screenings, arguing the â€œgreat majorityâ€ of his test results were negative or â€œquestionable.â€Â  However, he does not dispute testing positive for cocaine use in a hair follicle test in December 2004, testing positive for alcohol use as late as September 2004, and driving under the influence of alcohol in December 2004.Â  Additionally, we note Father stated at the hearing that he was an â€œaddictâ€ and admitted using cocaine more than two years after the children were removed from the home.Â  Father admittedly, voluntarily discontinued his counseling in December 2004, with the exception of attending one or two counseling sessions between that time and the TPR hearing.\r\nBased on the record, and in particular Fatherâ€™s testimony, we find while he might have initially made progress in his treatment planâ€™s drug counseling provisions, he clearly had a relapse in December 2004 and subsequently stopped attending drug court and engaging in counseling.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not err in terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights for having a diagnosable condition not likely to change in a reasonable period of time.\r\n\r\nD.&nbsp; Duration of DSS Foster Care Custody \r\n\r\nFatherâ€™s final argument alleges the family court erred in terminating his parental rights on the ground that his minor children had been in foster care for at least fifteen of the preceding twenty-two months, as permitted by section 20-7-1572(8) of the South Carolina Code.Â  We disagree.\r\nFather does not dispute that his minor children had been in DSS foster care for at least fifteen of the twenty-two months preceding the TPR hearing in August 2005.Â  Instead, he argues physical custody of the children was resumed by DSS in June 2004 because of circumstances over which he had â€œno controlâ€:Â  his stabbing and subsequent hospitalization that removed him from the home and left the children alone in Motherâ€™s care.Â  But for this unfortunate event, Father speculates the children would have likely remained in the home and DSS involvement would not have continued for a period sufficient to provide a basis for termination under section 20-7-1572(8).Â  We find this argument unavailing.\r\nThe record indicates the family court based the February 2004 physical reunification of the children and parents on the strength of Fatherâ€™s parenting abilities and because he was the childrenâ€™s primary caretaker.Â  Among other things, the family court prohibited the parents from allowing Mother to care for the children alone, and conditioned their return on Fatherâ€™s availability to care for the children.Â  Although obviously aware of the importance of being available to care for his children, Father voluntarily exposed himself to potential physical harm by breaking up a bar fight and later socializing with one of the people who had engaged in the fight.Â  Father was not merely a hapless stabbing victim, but instead exercised poor judgment and placed himself in harmâ€™s way.Â  Thus, we find the unfortunate circumstances that resulted in Fatherâ€™s hospitalization, and his childrenâ€™s consequential return to foster care, were substantially within Fatherâ€™s control.Â  Moreover, we note the record indicates DSS regained physical custody of the children with Fatherâ€™s consent after he was hospitalized and left only Mother to care for them.Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find the family court did not err in terminating Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s parental rights to their respective minor children.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, HUFF, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Mother and Father brought separate appeals, which this court consolidated in October 2005.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]&nbsp; The family court also terminated John Doeâ€™s parental rights, but that portion of the courtâ€™s order is not a subject of this appeal.\r\n[4]&nbsp; We also note Mother does not dispute the family courtâ€™s finding that she failed to complete portions of her treatment plan that did not require assistance from a third party in rearing her children, including drug court, drug and alcohol counseling, anger management counseling, and her psychiatric drug regimen.Â  Furthermore, she does not dispute the family courtâ€™s termination of her parental rights on other grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Garrison Hill, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-343\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2006 â€“ Filed October 12, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nChief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland; and Solicitor W. Barney Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â Â Dwight Fitzgerald Jones appeals his conviction for murder and assault and battery with intent to kill.Â  Jones argues the trial judge abused his discretion by disregarding Jonesâ€™ request to proceed pro se.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 25, 2001, an altercation at a sports bar in Richland County resulted in gunfire, leaving one dead and three wounded.Â  As a result, Jones was charged with murder and three counts of assault and battery with intent to kill.Â  During an in camera, ex parte hearing at the outset of his trial, Jones expressed dissatisfaction that his counsel had been unable to locate several potential witnesses he believed would be helpful to his case.Â  Jones asked for a continuance so that his family might hire a private investigator or attorney to attempt to track down these potential witnesses.Â  The court denied this request.Â  During this hearing, Jones also verbalized disagreement with his attorneyâ€™s decision not to call a particular witness. Â In response, his lawyer offered strategic reasons why Jonesâ€™ best interest might not be served by bringing this person to the stand.Â  The judge expressed agreement, and Jones indicated that he understood and was satisfied with the explanation.\r\nLater in the trial, another in camera, ex parte discussion was held.Â  Jonesâ€™ counsel informed the court:\r\n\r\nMy client indicates to me that he continues to have dissatisfaction with the way that the case is proceeding and with me.Â  He indicated a moment ago that he might like to just switch and be the one to ask questions of the witnesses himself.\r\nWe had a discussion about the way things are going and he has become increasingly unhappy with me and I â€¦ think he wishes to address the court.\r\n\r\nJones stated discontent with his lawyerâ€™s cross-examination of several witnesses who had identified Jones as the shooter.Â  He presented several specific examples of questions he believed should have been asked and that he had suggested to his attorney during the trial.Â  In response, his counsel elucidated her reasoning and strategy and pointed out that some of the questions Jones mentioned had in fact been asked.Â  The court averred as to the risks presented by many Jonesâ€™ recommendations for cross-examination and noted it is difficult for an attorney to take suggestions from his or her client, when at the same time, he or she is listening to the opposing sideâ€™s direct examination.\r\nThe judge went so far as to ask directly, â€œWhat is it that you want me to do?â€ Â Jones gave no answer but merely replied with a continuation of his complaint regarding questions that had not been asked. Â The court then stated, â€œYou certainly have the right to represent yourself â€¦ but I think youâ€™d be ill-served by making that choice.Â  But if you continue to have problems, I certainly will be glad to hear from you if you want to proceed on your own, okay?â€Â  Jonesâ€™ responded, â€œOkay, thank you.â€[2]Â  At no point in this discussion or at any time during the trial did Jones move or even indicate that he wished to appear pro se.\r\nThe jury found Jones guilty of all four counts.Â  He was sentenced to thirty years for murder and five years imprisonment for each of the three counts of assault and battery with intent to kill.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOn appeal, Jones argues the trial court erred by denying his request to proceed pro se.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA defendant has a constitutional right to self-representation under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.Â  Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2527 (1975).Â  â€œAlthough a defendantâ€™s decision to proceed pro se may be to the defendantâ€™s own detriment, it â€˜must be honored out of that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.â€™ â€Â  State v. Brewer, 328 S.C. 117, 492 S.E.2d 97 (1997) (quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 834, 95 S.Ct. at 2541).Â  This right, however, is not unfettered.Â  While this court has held that one â€œmay surrender his right to counsel through (1) waiver by affirmative, verbal request; (2) waiver by conduct; and (3) forfeiture,â€Â  State v. Thompson, 355 S.C. 255, 262, 584 S.E.2d 131, 134 (Ct. App. 2003),Â  the right to proceed pro se must be clearly asserted prior to trial.Â  State v. Brewer, 328 SC 117, 492 S.E.2d 97 (1997); United States v. Lorick, 753 F.2d 1295, 1298 (4th Cir. 1985).Â  \r\nThere is nothing in the record to indicate that Jones ever requested self-representation, let alone did so in manner that could be interpreted as a clear assertion the right.Â  Jones contends he motioned to appear pro se when his lawyer made the previously quoted statement regarding Jonesâ€™ dissatisfaction with his counsel, which included the remark, â€œhe [Jones] might like to just switch and be the one to ask questions of the witnesses himself.â€Â  \r\nBesides expressing his unhappiness with his attorney, this colloquy merely mentions that Jones â€œmight likeâ€ to represent himself.Â  The circumstances and ensuing inquiry allowed the judge to see that Jones concerns were properly addressed and conclude that he was not requesting to proceed pro se.Â  This query was proper, for the trial judge has the responsibility to ensure that the accused is informed of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation and that he makes a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel.Â  Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541; Dixon, 269 S.C. 107 236 S.E.2d 419 (1977).Â  Additionally, the judge was correct in not concluding this statement to be a waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, as â€œ[t]he courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights, and do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights. Â Thompson, 355 S.C. at 262, 584 S.E.2d at 134 (citing, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023 (1938); Pitts v. North Carolina, 395 F.2d 182, 188 (4th Cir. 1968).\r\nEven in the event the conversation at issue amounted to a definite motion to proceed pro se, based on the timing of the issue being raised, denial of the request was not an abuse of discretion by the court.Â  The right to represent oneself must be asserted by the defendant before the trial begins.Â  State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 415, 405 S.E.2d 377, 381 (1991); United States v. Lorick, 753 F.2d 1295, 1298 (4th Cir. 1985).Â  â€œIf the request to proceed pro se is made after the trial has begun, the grant or denial of the right to proceed pro se rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge.â€Â  State v. Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, 241, 523 S.E.2d 168, 170 (1999) (citing United States v. Singleton, 107 F.3d 1091 (4th Cir. 1997); United States v. Lawrence, 605 F.2d 1321 (4th Cir. 1979)).Â  As there may be a variety of reasons which might excuse a last minute request by a defendant to proceed pro se, it is thus â€œincumbent upon the trial court to determine whether the request is made for purposes of delay or to gain tactical advantage, and whether the lateness of the request may hinder the administration of justice.â€ Â Fuller, 337 S.C. at 241, 523 S.E.2d at 170-171 (citing and quoting People v. Mogul, 812 P.2d 705 (Colo. Ct. App. 1991) (internal citations omitted).Â  There is nothing in the record to indicate that the judge abused his discretion in refusing any motion to appear pro se that may have been made.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nAccordingly, Jonesâ€™ convictions are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The trial record actually stops at the end of the judgeâ€™s question, thus cutting off Jones reply.Â  However, his response is provided in the Stateâ€™s brief to this court.Â  Jones makes no challenge as to the factual accuracy of this information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-344","title":"Jackson v.

Â He pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Â In 2004, Jackson filed in the circuit court a petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus arguing that his conviction was the result of police corruption, that he had not been adequately advised of his rights during his guilty plea, and that he was convicted of a crime for which he had not been indicted by a grand jury. Â The circuit court dismissed Jacksonâ€™s petition.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS \r\nThe case of Gibson v. State, 329 S.C. 37, 495 S.E.2d 426 (1998), discussed at length the law concerning writs of habeas corpus and when such petitions should be dismissed or granted.Â  \r\n\r\nThe availability of habeas corpus has been severely limited by the [South Carolina] Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act (Act).Â  The Act â€œtakes the place of all other common law, statutory or other remedies heretofore available for challenging the validity of the conviction or sentence.â€ Â It shall be used exclusively in place of them.Â  Thus, [the] Act supersedes and encompasses the habeas corpus procedure provided by statute.Â  However, habeas corpus continues to be available as a constitutional remedy\r\nprovided a petitioner qualifies for this extraordinary relief and clears the procedural hurdles.\r\n\r\nHabeas corpus is available only when other remedies, such as PCR, are inadequate or\r\nunavailable . . . However, a petitioner who does not raise an issue which could have been raised in a prior PCR hearing will waive his right to raise this issue in a subsequent application.Â  Procedurally, a petitioner seeking habeas corpus must first exhaust all available PCR remedies.Â  Exhaustion includes filing of an application, the rendering of an order adjudicating the issues, and petitioning for, or knowingly waiving, appellate review.Â  Further, petitioner must allege sufficient facts to show why other remedies, such as PCR, are unavailable or inadequate.\r\n\r\nId. at 40-42, 495 S.E.2d at 427-28 (citations omitted).Â  â€œA person is procedurally barred from petitioning the circuit court for a writ of habeas corpus where the matter alleged is one which could have been raised in a PCR application.â€Â  Keeler v. Mauney, 330 S.C. 568, 571, 500 S.E.2d 123, 124 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\nIn the present case, Jackson admits he did not file a direct appeal and does not allege that any prior PCR applications have been filed.Â  Consequently, he has not set forth facts that allow him to overcome the procedural bar providing for dismissal of his writ.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;\r\nWe decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-345","title":"State v.

(hereinafter ABC) appeals from orders of the circuit court estreating, in whole or in part, one bond each on defendants Ernest Alcantara, Pablo Alcantara, Jose Hernandez, and Marko Marshall, and two separate bonds on Nathaniel Stevenson, III. Â ABC argues, as to each defendantsâ€™ order of estreatment, the circuit court erred in failing to grant the company a continuance.Â  ABC further argues, as to the orders concerning the Alcantaras, Marshall, and Stevenson, the court erred in ordering the amounts estreated on each bond based on the minimal cost to the State of the failure of the defendants to appear. Â We affirm as to each of the bond estreatment orders.[2]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn July 27, 2005, the circuit court held a bond estreatment hearing in\r\nregard to bonds involving the above named defendants. Â Appearing on behalf of ABC Bonding was the companyâ€™s attorney, as well as ABCâ€™s investigator, Mr. Jim Sims.Â  At the start of the hearing, while discussing defendant Ernest Alcantara, ABCâ€™s attorney noted he had previously â€œexplained the circumstancesâ€ to the court, and Mr. Sims was available if the court wished to question him.Â  Thereafter, ABCâ€™s attorney stated, â€œAs I explained earlier, Your Honor, I donâ€™t have the full file on this.â€Â  As the situations involving each of the defendants were discussed, counsel for ABC noted, as he had previously explained, his client was not fully prepared to proceed with the cases.Â  \r\nThe matter went forward, and the court ordered the full $55,000 each of Ernest Alcantaraâ€™s and Pablo Alcantaraâ€™s bonds be estreated.Â  He further ordered that $1,000 be estreated on Hernandezâ€™s $2,400 bond, $2,000 be estreated on Marshallâ€™s $25,000 bond, and the full amounts of $5,000 and $3,000 be estreated on Stevensonâ€™s two bonds.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from a decision on the forfeiture or remission of a bail bond, the appellate court reviews the circuit courtâ€™s ruling for an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. McClinton, 369 S.C. 167, 631 S.E.2d 895 (2006).Â  \r\n\r\nAn abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit courtâ€™s ruling is based upon an error of law, such as application of the wrong legal principle; or, when based upon factual conclusions, the ruling is without evidentiary support; or, when the circuit court is vested with discretion, but the ruling reveals no discretion was exercised; or when the ruling does not fall within the range of permissible decisions applicable in a particular case, such that it may be deemed arbitrary and capricious.Â  \r\n\r\nId. (citing Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 539, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987); S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 229 n.6 (2d Cir. 2001)).&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Continuance\r\nWe first address ABCâ€™s contention as to each of the six bond matters, that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying ABCâ€™s request for a continuance.Â  ABC argues the circuit court abused its discretion in refusing to grant ABCâ€™s request for a continuance of the hearing where counsel for ABC informed the court his client was recovering from a kidney transplant.Â  Specifically, ABC contends that, prior to the hearing, counsel requested a continuance based on the fact that the owner of ABC had just undergone a kidney transplant resulting in the ownerâ€™s inability to appear at the hearing and counselâ€™s inability to consult with the owner on the matter.Â  ABC maintains the request was made at a sidebar conference to protect the privacy of the owner of ABC.Â  It further asserts that the court ordered counsel to proceed with the hearing despite the ownerâ€™s absence and, when informed Mr. Sims was present in court but counsel had not had an opportunity to consult with Mr. Sims either, the court again ordered the hearing to proceed.Â  \r\nWe find this issue as to all six of the bonds in question is not preserved for our review.Â  While the record shows ABCâ€™s counsel stated he was not ready to proceed and made reference to a previous discussion, nowhere in the transcript does counsel move for a continuance, nor does he state the basis for a request for continuance.Â  Indeed, by way of brief, ABC indicates these matters were addressed in a sidebar and not on the record.Â  Because the motion for continuance was made during an off-the-record conference and was not made part of the record, the matter is not preserved for review.Â  See York v. Conway Ford, Inc., 325 S.C. 170, 173, 480 S.E.2d 726, 728 (1997) (holding an objection made during an off-the-record conference which is not made part of the record will not preserve the issue for review).Â  In addition, the fact that the circuit court may have acknowledged a discussion on the matter was held off-the-record does not preserve the matter for review.Â  See State v. Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 258, 609 S.E.2d 572, 591(Ct. App. 2005) (noting an issue is not preserved for appeal merely because the trial judge mentions it).\r\nII.Â  Failure to consider costs to the StateÂ Â  \r\nABC next contends the circuit court abused its discretion in ordering estreatment of the full $55,000 on each of the Alcantarasâ€™s bonds, $2,000 on Marshallâ€™s $25,000 bond, and the full amounts of $5,000 and $3,000 on Stevensonâ€™s two bonds.Â  ABC asserts the circuit court erred in failing to consider the costs to the State in reaching its decision as to estreatment on these bonds. [3]Â  \r\nThe record shows, in addressing some of the bonds, counsel for ABC requested the circuit court consider costs expended by the State in attempting to recover the defendants, as costs was one of the factors the court should consider in determining remission of the bond. Â Counsel argued that, in a forfeiture matter, the court should take into consideration the economic loss to the State.Â  The trial judge replied that economic loss was â€œnot the only factorâ€ to consider.\r\nThe issue of whether a bond forfeiture should be remitted, and if so, to what extent, is vested in the discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Workman, 274 S.C. 341, 343, 263 S.E.2d 865, 866 (1980);Â  State v. Holloway, 262 S.C. 552, 557, 206 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1974).Â  In determining whether and to what extent a bond should be remitted, the trial court should at least consider the following factors:Â  (1) the purpose of the bond;Â  (2) the nature and willfulness of the default;Â  (3) any prejudice or additional expense resulting to the State.Â  State v. Boatwright, 310 S.C. 281, 287, 423 S.E.2d 139, 142-43 (1992) (Toal, J., dissenting).Â  In making a determination as to remission of the judgment on a forfeited bond, â€œthe court shall consider the costs to the State or any county or municipality resulting from the necessity to continue or terminate the defendantâ€™s trial and the efforts of law enforcement officers or agencies to locate the defendant.â€Â  S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-70 (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nIn Ex Parte Polk, 354 S.C. 8, 11-12, 579 S.E.2d 329, 330-31 (Ct. App. 2003), this court held, because section 38-53-70 unambiguously provides that the trial court must consider the costs to the State in determining remission of the judgment on a forfeited bond, the circuit courtâ€™s refusal to consider costs as requested amounted to an abuse of discretion.Â  In the matters at hand, however, the circuit court did not refuse to consider costs to the State.Â  Rather, the court specifically acknowledged it was to consider costs as well as other factors in determining possible remission of the Alcantarasâ€™ bonds.Â  Under the facts of this case, we cannot say the circuit court abused its discretion by refusing to consider costs to the State in ordering the amounts estreated on each of the bonds in question.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn conclusion, we hold, because ABC failed to place a motion for continuance on the record, this issue is procedurally barred as to all of the named defendantsâ€™ bonds.Â  We further find no abuse of discretion in the orders of estreatment as to the Ernest and Pablo Alcantara, Marko Marshall, and Nathaniel Stevenson bonds.Â  Accordingly, the orders below are\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because these matters were heard at the same time, in the same hearing, resulting in the same transcript, and involve the same issues, we have consolidated these cases on appeal.Â  See Rule 214, SCACR (â€œWhere there is more than one appeal from the same order, judgment, or decree, or where the same question is involved in two or more appeals in different cases, the appellate court may, in its discretion, order the appeal to be consolidated.â€).\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] ABC does not challenge the $1,000 estreated on the $2,400 Hernandez bond, but only challenges the courtâ€™s failure to grant a continuance in that matter.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-346","title":"Nash v.

Brunson, appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order remanding the case to the probate court for further consideration of the issue of Wrightâ€™s fiduciary relationship with her father as it applies to her sistersâ€™ claim of undue influence.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]  \r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBrunson passed away on December 22, 2002, at the age of 91.Â  He was survived by his three daughters, Wright and the plaintiffs in this case, Mary Ann B. Nash and Nancy B. Clifford.Â  In 1998, Wright had moved from Hawaii back to Darlington County to live with and take care of her parents.Â  Brunson executed a general durable power of attorney naming Wright as his attorney in fact in June of 1999.Â  On September 18, 2002, Brunson executed the will that is the subject of this action.Â  In the will, he devised a beach house in Horry County to Wright.Â  In addition, he devised a life estate in his residence in Darlington County to Wright with a one-third remainder interest each to Nash, Clifford, and Wrightâ€™s heirs.Â  Both of these devises to Wright were made â€œin consideration of her dedicated assistance to [Brunson] and [his] wife for many years.â€Â  The remainder of the estate was left to the three daughters equally.Â  Wright was named as the personal representative of the estate.Â  \r\nFollowing Brunsonâ€™s death, Wright commenced an informal probate of her fatherâ€™s estate and was appointed as personal representative.Â  Nash and Clifford filed an action against Wright and the estate contesting the will.Â  They alleged the will was procured by â€œfraud, coercion, duress, undue influence and/or mistakeâ€ and that at the time of the execution of the will, Brunson lacked testamentary capacity.Â  \r\nAs a threshold question, the probate court considered Nash and Cliffordâ€™s contention that Wright, who held durable power of attorney and had a fiduciary relationship with Brunson, had the burden of demonstrating that Brunson had the requisite testamentary capacity and that the will was not procured as a result of undue influence.Â  Â Â The court concluded that under the unambiguous language of the South Carolina Probate Code, Nash and Clifford had both the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion on both the issues of lack of testamentary capacity and undue influence.Â  In considering the totality of the evidence, the court concluded Brunson had the requisite mental capacity to execute his will and the will was not the result of undue influence.Â  \r\nNash and Clifford appealed the circuit court.Â  The court ruled that despite the provisions of the probate code, â€œwhen a fiduciary relationship exists between the testator and the primary beneficiary under the testatorâ€™s will, the burden then shifts to the beneficiary to prove the absence of undue influence by clear and convincing evidence.â€Â  The court found it was not clear whether the probate court had made any specific determination as to whether a fiduciary relationship existed between Wright and her father.Â  It held without this specific conclusion, it could not rule upon the various other grounds for appeal.Â  Accordingly, it remanded the case to the probate court to make appropriate findings and conclusions as to whether a fiduciary relationship existed.Â  It allowed for the parties to present additional evidence on this issue.Â  Wright appealed to this court.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWright argues the circuit court erred in ruling that when a fiduciary relationship exists between the testator and the primary beneficiary, the burden of persuasion shifts to the beneficiary to prove the absence of undue influence by clear and convincing evidence.Â  We agree.Â Â  \r\nThe probate court relied on section 62-3-407 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, which sets forth the burden of proof and burden of persuasion in contested will cases.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-407 (Supp. 2005).Â  This section provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIn contested cases, petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death, venue, and heirship.Â  Proponents of a will have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases and, if they are also petitioners, prima facie proof of death and venue.Â  Contestants of a will have the burden of establishing undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, revocation, or lack of testamentary intent or capacity.Â  Parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof.Â  \r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nWhen a confidential relationship exists, a presumption of invalidity of the will on the basis of undue influence arises.Â  Howard v. Nasser, 364 S.C. 279, 286-88, 613 S.E.2d 64, 67-68 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  In Nasser, this court considered section 62-3-407 and the presumption of invalidity and determined: \r\n\r\n[I]f the contestants of a duly executed will provide evidence that a confidential/fiduciary relationship existed sufficient to raise the presumption, the proponents of the will must offer evidence in rebuttal.Â  We emphasize that although the proponents of the will must present evidence in rebuttal, they do not have to affirmatively disprove the existence of undue influence.Â  Instead, the contestants of the will still retain the ultimate burden of proof to invalidate the will.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 288, 613 S.E.2d at 68-69. Â The court summarized:\r\n\r\nÂ [W]here the contestants introduce testimony raising a presumption of undue influence by a beneficiary sustaining a confidential or fiduciary relation toward the testator, the issue should be submitted to the jury, as where, in addition to the factor of confidential relations, there also appear the further facts of an unnatural disposition making the person charged with the undue influence chief beneficiary, and that such person generally dominated the testatrix.\r\n\r\nId.Â  (quoting Moorer v. Bull, 212 S.C. 146, 149, 46 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1948) (citations omitted)). \r\nAlthough made without the benefit of this courtâ€™s opinion in Nasser, the probate courtâ€™s ruling on the issue of the burden of proof is in line with this courtâ€™s decision.Â Â Â  Accordingly, we hold the circuit court erred in ruling that upon a showing of a fiduciary relationship, the burden of proof shifts to the beneficiary.\r\nWright argues the circuit court erred in remanding the case to the probate court to determine whether or not a fiduciary relationship existed.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nWright concedes that she was in a fiduciary relationship with her father.Â  The probate court recognized, â€œMs. Wright was also a power of attorney holder and owed a fiduciary duty to the testator.â€Â  The probate court did not specifically articulate that this relationship raised the presumption of invalidity.Â  However, even with the presumption, the burden merely shifted to Wright to present evidence in rebuttal, not to affirmatively disprove the existence of undue influence.Â  See Nasser, 364 S.C. at 288, 613 S.E.2d at 68 (stating that if the will contestants provide evidence that a confidential/fiduciary relationship existed sufficient to raise the presumption, the proponents of the will must offer evidence in rebuttal). The probate court considered Wrightâ€™s fiduciary relationship, in addition to Nash and Cliffordâ€™s other contentions, as well as Wrightâ€™s rebuttal evidence that the testamentary dispositions were not the result of undue influence.Â  It then concluded, â€œThe court finds that the level of evidence required for a finding of undue influence was not attained.â€Â  We find the probate courtâ€™s deliberation in this case was consistent with this courtâ€™s ruling in Nasser.Â Â  Accordingly, we hold the circuit court erred in remanding the case to the probate court for further proceedings.[2]Â Â \r\n\r\nThus we remand to the circuit court for consideration of Nash and Cliffordâ€™s remaining issues on appeal.Â Â  Â Â Â \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and SHORT, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] We take no position as to the existence of undue influence as this issue is not presently before the court.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-347","title":"S.C.

Collins, both of Columbia, for Guardian Ad Litem\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Roger B. (Father) appeals the family courtâ€™s termination of his parental rights to B.B., A.B., and D.B..Â  Father contends the family court erred in (1) terminating his parental rights on the bases that he abandoned and willfully failed to visit his minor children, (2) failing to make a specific finding regarding whether termination of his parental rights was in the childrenâ€™s best interests, and (3) denying his motion for a continuance.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn December 20, 2001, the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) took the minor children into emergency protective custody after Father was charged with murder in connection with the death of the childrenâ€™s mother, Jenny B. (Mother). Â Father allegedly murdered Mother in the presence of the children, two of whom actually witnessed the incident.Â  Father then drove all three children to a wooded area where he abandoned them.Â  He subsequently picked the children up from the wooded area and later abandoned them in a car, where authorities found the children sleeping. Â Although the weather was â€œvery cold,â€ Father allegedly left the children without warm clothing.Â  Â Â \r\nDSS initiated the present termination of parental rights (TPR) action against Father on May 29, 2003.Â  It alleged multiple bases for termination, including abandonment of the children and the childrenâ€™s placement in foster care under DSS custody for at least fifteen of the preceding twenty-four months.Â  Father declined representation, and filed a pro se answer specifically denying all bases for termination of his parental rights except the allegation as to the time the children had been in the custody of DSS.[2]Â  \r\nThe family court conducted a merits hearing on February 12, 2004.Â  As a preliminary matter, Father asked the court to rule on a motion for continuance he previously filed but admittedly failed to serve on opposing counsel.Â  Father argued he was entitled to a continuance because his appointed â€œstandby counsel,â€[3] Ronald R. Hall, had not responded to his requests for assistance and, consequently, he was unable to have subpoenas served on his witnesses.Â  Father argued he was therefore unprepared to proceed with the hearing.Â  He maintained he wanted to call as witnesses a member of the local solicitorâ€™s office and his former appointed trial counsel.Â  Father failed to articulate the testimony he sought to elicit from the member of the solicitorâ€™s office, but stated this solicitor had indicated his criminal trial would take place before Fatherâ€™s parents attempted to obtain custody of the children. He stated he wished to question his former appointed counsel to preserve a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  The court denied Fatherâ€™s motion, finding (1) it was not properly before the court because he had not properly served the motion on opposing counsel, and (2) Father failed to demonstrate that the witnesses he planned to subpoena would offer any relevant testimony in this termination of parental rights action.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, the childrenâ€™s DSS foster care worker testified the children had continuously been in foster care since they were taken into emergency protective custody approximately twenty-six months earlier.Â  She testified placement with the Father was not likely in the foreseeable future, and that efforts to place the children with family members proved unsuccessful.Â  According to the foster care worker, the only remaining option was to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights and make the children available for adoption.Â  A DSS foster care supervisor also testified placement of the children with relatives had been explored, but no suitable placement was found.Â  The supervisor also testified terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights was in the childrenâ€™s best interests, primarily because of the allegations Father killed their Mother, who the supervisor described as â€œthe one stable force in their life . . . .â€Â  The childrenâ€™s guardian ad litem opined the childrenâ€™s grandparents loved them, but they were not a suitable option for the childrenâ€™s placement.Â  She testified â€œtheir father had demonstrated, through the childrenâ€™s interaction with [her], a disregard for their well-beingâ€ and that she consequently did not find interviewing him necessary. Â The guardian ad litem also testified she believed the childrenâ€™s best interests would be served by terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights and placing them for adoption.Â  DSS sought termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights based on the two statutory grounds of Fatherâ€™s abandonment of the children and the childrenâ€™s placement in DSS custody for fifteen of the past twenty-two months.Â  \r\nThe court terminated Fatherâ€™s parental rights orally at the conclusion of the hearing noting, in spite of attempts to find family members with whom to place the children, no suitable placement was found.Â  The court found the children had been in foster care for the preceding twenty-six months, and that time was of the essence such that it was in the childrenâ€™s best interest that the matter not be delayed.Â  The court later reduced its findings and conclusions to a written order dated March 5, 2004.[4]Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR action, the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before parental rights can be forever terminated, the grounds for the termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 608-09, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, however, we are not required to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact the trial judge was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony. Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 345 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œFurther, this broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of the burden of convincing this Court that the family court committed error.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Termination of Parental Rights\r\nFather first argues the court erred in terminating his parental rights because, under the circumstances, his imprisonment precluded a finding that he willfully abandoned or failed to visit his minor children.Â Â  We note the family court did not terminate fatherâ€™s parental rights on the basis of willful failure to visit, but we decline to otherwise address these issues because Father does not dispute the termination of his parental rights on the alternate basis that the minor children had been in foster care fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months at the time of the hearing.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2005) (permitting TPR where a child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months). Â Because Father does not refute this finding, the courtâ€™s determination that Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated under section 20-7-1572(8) is the law of the case.[5]Â  See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (holding an unappealed ruling is the law of the case); Â S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 628, n. 3, 627 S.E.2d 718, 721, n.3 (2006) (ruling unappealed grounds for TPR are law of the case). Further, our courts have held that a finding pursuant to section 20-7-1572(8) alone is sufficient to support a termination of parental rights. Â S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Sims, 359 S.C. 601, 608, 598 S.E.2d 303, 307 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Best Interests of the Children\r\nBecause one statutory ground for TPR has been met, the only issue remaining for us to consider is whether termination is in the best interest of the children.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005) (providing family court may terminate parental rights if it finds at least one of the eleven statutory grounds for termination has been met and that termination is in the best interest of the child).Â  See also Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. King, 369 S.C. 96, ____, 631 S.E.2d 239, 241 (2006) (holding, where parent failed to appeal ruling that child had been in foster care for fifteen of most recent twenty-two months, one statutory ground for TPR had been met and the appellate court need only consider whether termination of parental rights was in the best interest of the child).\r\nFather contends the family court failed to make a specific finding that it was in the best interests of the children to terminate his parental rights.Â  Here, the family courtâ€™s order did not explicitly state that terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights was in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  However, in its oral order, the court did find that time was of the essence in securing permanent placement for these children, that it was in the childrenâ€™s best interest that there be no further delay, and that Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated.Â  Furthermore, the family courtâ€™s written order notes the importance of freeing abused and/or neglected children for adoption, but recognizes that paramount to this view is the principle that the best interests of the minor children prevail if their interests vary from that of the parent.Â  The written order also emphasizes the importance of focusing on the childrenâ€™s best interests by stating â€œtime is of the essence in the lives of these minors, that they are each developing by the minute, and that there can be no further delay in the attempt to secure permanency for them.â€Â  Thus, based on our view of the record, we find the family court considered the childrenâ€™s best interests when reaching its decision.Â  At any rate, we find clear and convincing evidence overwhelmingly indicates it was in the childrenâ€™s best interests that Fatherâ€™s parental rights be terminated.Â  In particular, both the childrenâ€™s guardian ad litem and DSS foster care supervisor emphatically opined that terminating Fatherâ€™s parental rights served the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  Also, their DSS foster care worker testified attempts to place the children with family members was not successful, and that making them available for adoption was the only option. Â See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. V. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding, in a termination of parental rights case, the appellate court has jurisdiction to review the entire record to determine the facts in accordance with its view of the evidence; Â the appellate court may review the record and make its own findings as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports termination). \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Motion for Continuance\r\nFather contends the family courtâ€™s denial of his motion for a continuance violated his constitutional due process rights because it deprived him of additional time needed to subpoena witnesses he had previously been unable to subpoena due to his standby counselâ€™s failure to assist him.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs an initial matter, Fatherâ€™s claim that the courtâ€™s ruling violated his constitutional due process rights was never raised to or ruled upon by the family court.Â  Thus, it is not preserved for our review.Â  See Durlach v. Durlach, 359 S.C. 64, 76, 596 S.E.2d 908, 915 (2004) (holding due process claim not raised in the family court but raised for the first time on appeal is not preserved for review).Â  Further, Father has failed to challenge on appeal the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the motion for continuance was not properly before the court because Father had not properly served the motion on opposing counsel.Â  This alternate basis for denying the motion for continuance is therefore the law of the case.Â  See Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 65, 624 S.E.2d 649, 653-54 (2006) (holding unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt any rate, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Fatherâ€™s motion for continuance.Â  Father did not indicate the precise testimony he sought to elicit from the solicitor, but stated the solicitor had indicated his criminal trial would take place prior to the hearing regarding the paternal grandparentsâ€™ attempt to obtain custody of the children. As to his former attorney, Father sought to subpoena him as a witness in order to preserve a legal malpractice claim.Â  We agree with the trial court that the testimony of these witnesses was irrelevant.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 51, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992) (â€œThe granting or denial of a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and is reviewable on appeal only when an abuse of discretion appears from the record.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and SHORT, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] His pleadingsâ€™ caption indicates he also brought a cross-claim, although the pleadings are unclear about the subject of the cross-claim.Â  Paragraph â€œGâ€ of Fatherâ€™s pleadings allege prejudice and a lack of partiality by the guardian ad litem, which appears to constitute the cross-claim. Â \r\n[3] Although Father insisted on representing himself at the trial level, he asked the court to appoint â€œstandby counselâ€ to assist him.Â  The court granted his motion.Â  \r\n[4] The order erroneously states the order was signed on March 5, 2003.Â  However, this is clearly a typographical error in light of the undisputed fact that the hearing occurred in February 2004 and the order was filed March 10, 2004. \r\n[5] Father attempts to raise by way of his reply brief that he has not abandoned this issue because he has maintained he was denied visitation with the children.Â  Father fails, however, to refute the factual basis for termination on the ground that the children have been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months, nor does he challenge the validity of this statutory ground.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-348","title":"Shaffer v.

Cordell Maddox, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-348Submitted October 1, 2006 â€“ \r\nFiled October 18, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Dale Shaffer, of Greenwood, Pro Se, for Appellant.\r\n        Andrew E. Haselden and R. Davis Howser, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this legal malpractice case, Dale Shaffer contends the trial court erred in denying his motions for continuance and in denying his motion to amend his complaint.Â  Shaffer also contends the process for litigating legal malpractice cases in South Carolina is unconstitutional.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis legal malpractice action stems from a previous action in which Adam Bacot represented Shaffer in his divorce.Â  Shaffer, acting pro se, alleges Bacot was negligent in not acting on â€œthe many warning signs that [Shafferâ€™s ex-wifeâ€™s divorce attorney] was not performing in a manner consistent with [Bacotâ€™s] view of what constitutes the proper operation of a domestic relations suit.â€Â  Shaffer also contends Bacot failed to carefully review certain documents produced through discovery.Â  Specifically, Shaffer alleges Bacot failed to timely identify a second appraisal of the marital home which valued the home at a substantially lower value than previously believed.Â Â  \r\nBacot answered, asserting a general denial of most of the factual allegations, numerous defenses, and filed a motion to strike pursuant to Rule 12(f), SCRCP, which was granted.Â  Shaffer appealed that order asserting the motion to strike should not have been granted and raising numerous constitutional issues.Â  On May 18, 2004, this court issued an unpublished opinion affirming the order granting Bacotâ€™s motion to strike and noted the constitutional issues were not properly before the court.Â  See Shaffer v. Bacot, No. 2004-UP-339 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 18, 2004).Â Â  \r\nPrior to trial, Shaffer made numerous motions for continuance, all of which were denied.Â  Shaffer also made a motion to amend his complaint just before trial which was also denied.Â  In his motion to amend, Shaffer sought to include the following:Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    D.&nbsp;\r\n    Failure to identify the possible civil conspiracy on the part of Attorney Jon Newlon and Ackerman Appraisal Service in producing and using an appraisal that may have been designed to be artificially low.&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    E.\r\n    Failure to secure a third appraisal on the property in question. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    F.&nbsp;\r\n    Failure to identify the possibility and consider the legal ramifications of the Plaintiff converting money from the 401K account into retirement years with the State of South Carolina, with or without the advance knowledge of opposing counsel in the underlying case.&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n\r\nPrior to trial, Shaffer also moved the trial court for a ruling that the process for trying legal malpractice cases in South Carolina violated his constitutional rights.Â  The trial court denied the motion and stated that Shafferâ€™s arguments concerning these issues would be preserved for appeal.Â Â Â  \r\nAt the close of the trial, Bacot moved for a directed verdict.Â  The trial court granted the directed verdict on all grounds except comparative negligence, in essence resolving all the issues in the case.Â  Shaffer renewed his argument concerning the violation of constitutional rights, of which the trial court took note.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Motions for Continuance \r\nShaffer contends the trial court erred in denying his motions for continuance.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nDeciding whether to grant or deny a motion for continuance rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 309, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997).Â  We will not reverse the trial court without a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  â€œTo justify a continuance, the moving party must show not only the absence of some material evidence but also due diligence on his part to obtain it.â€Â  Hudson v. Blanton, 282 S.C. 70, 74, 316 S.E.2d 432, 434 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  â€œReversals of refusals of continuances are about as rare as the proverbial hens [sic] teeth.â€Â  State v. Yarborough, 363 S.C. 260, 266, 609 S.E.2d 592, 595 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nThe action was initially filed on April 18, 2002.Â  Shaffer made motions for continuances on May 9, 19, and 23, 2005, all of which were denied.Â  The reasons given for the requests were to secure additional discovery materials as well as an expert witness.Â  The discovery materials were obtained in March 2005, thereby making his motion for a continuance on this basis moot.Â  As for the issue of obtaining an expert witness, Shaffer contends he exercised due diligence in attempting to obtain one.Â  However, Shaffer admits he did not begin his search until January of 2005, only four months before trial was set to begin.Â  Shafferâ€™s assertion that he was out of the country and unable to start the search is unavailing as, by his own admission, he began his search by sending letters to potential lawyers, which could have easily been done while out of the country.Â Â  \r\nFurther, this is not a case where an expert witness has been identified and for some reason is unable to be at trial.Â  See Yarborough, 363 S.C. at 266, 609 S.E.2d at 595 (finding in case where two witnesses failed to appear at hearing that the party asking for the continuance â€œ[m]ust show due diligence was used in trying to procure the testimony of an absent witness as well as set forth what the party believes the absent witness will testify to and the grounds for that beliefâ€); Logan v. Gatti, 289 S.C. 546, 547-49, 347 S.E.2d 506, 507-8 (Ct. App. 1986) (finding where plaintiffâ€™s expert witness was unexpectedly recalled to active duty with the Navy a few weeks before trial, the failure to grant a motion for a continuance was an abuse of discretion).Â  As such, Shaffer cannot show what the testimony of the absent witness would have been.Â  Nor can Shaffer point to any circumstances, such as those in Logan, where his witness could not attend trial unexpectedly.Â Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to grant Shafferâ€™s motions for continuance as Shaffer has failed to show not only the absence of some material evidence but also due diligence on his part to obtain it.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Motion to Amend Complaint \r\nShaffer argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to amend his complaint.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nRule 15, SCRCP, provides that the complaint may be amended by leave of the court and â€œleave shall be freely given when justice requires and does not prejudice any other party.â€ A motion to amend is within the sound discretion of the trial court and the opposing party has the burden of establishing prejudice.Â  Foggie v. CSX Transp., Inc., 315 S.C. 17, 22, 431 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1993).Â  The â€œprejudiceâ€ in question is lack of notice that a new issue is going to be tried and lack of opportunity to refute it.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 413, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).\r\nShaffer made the motion to amend his complaint on May 19, 2005, only one business day prior to the scheduled commencement of trial.Â  Granting the motion would have given Bacot virtually no time to prepare a defense to the new allegations.Â  Shaffer provided no reason why such a motion could not have been made earlier.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in refusing to allow Shaffer to amend his complaint one business day prior to the trialâ€™s commencement.Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Constitutional ArgumentsÂ  \r\nShaffer contends the process for litigating legal malpractice cases in South Carolina does not protect the plaintiffâ€™s due process or equal protection rights provided by both the United States Constitution and the South Carolina Constitution.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nInitially, Shaffer makes a general statement that the process for litigating legal malpractice cases in South Carolina violates the Due Process Clause.Â  The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, â€œnor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.â€ â€œ[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.â€ Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972).Â  The requirements in a particular case are dependent upon the importance of the interest involved and the circumstances under which the deprivation may occur.Â  See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976) (holding that in determining the process which is due, courts will consider the private interest affected by the proceeding, the risk of error created by the chosen procedure, and the countervailing governmental interest supporting challenged procedure). â€œThe fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Beeks, 325 S.C. 243, 246, 481 S.E.2d 703, 705 (1997).\r\nShaffer appears to argue that the legal malpractice system in South Carolina is not easily navigated by a non-lawyer and thus violates his due process rights.Â  This argument, however, does not constitute a denial of due process.Â  Shaffer, like any other pro se litigant, has the same opportunity for his day in court, notice of proceedings, and most importantly the opportunity to be heard.Â  He makes no argument that he was denied these rights, and specifically does not argue he was denied these rights due to his status as a pro se litigant.Â  Accordingly, we find Shafferâ€™s right to due process has not been violated.Â  \r\nShaffer also asserts his equal protection rights were violated stemming from the availability of attorneys willing to represent plaintiffs in legal malpractice cases.Â  Equal protection, as provided by the United States Constitution, means that â€œno person, or class of persons, shall be denied the same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in the same place and under similar circumstances.â€Â  U.S. Const. art. 1; U.S. Const. amend. XIV.Â  Equal protection guarantees only protection enjoyed by other persons in the same place and under like circumstances.Â  Harrison v. Caudle, 141 S.C. 407, 407, 139 S.E.2d 842, 845 (1927).Â  To establish an equal protection violation, plaintiffs must demonstrate they were intentionally and purposely subjected to treatment different from others similarly situated.Â  Sylvia Dev. Corp. v. Calvert County, Md., 48 F.3d 810, 818 (4th Cir. 1995).\r\nHowever, Shaffer offers no evidence that he or other legal malpractice litigants are treated differently than other malpractice litigants.Â  There is no evidence that Shaffer has been treated any differently in this case than he would have been if he had been representing himself in a medical malpractice case.Â  Shaffer makes no argument concerning the inability of his being able to find a lawyer to represent him in this case.Â  His only arguments concern his inability to find an expert to testify on his behalf, which may very well have been an indication of the strength of his case and not the legal malpractice process.Â  As such, Shaffer has failed to establish an equal protection violation based on the inability to find a legal representative in this legal malpractice case.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Shaffer asserts that plaintiffs in legal malpractice cases are deprived of their constitutional right to an impartial tribunal.Â  Specifically, Shaffer contends the legal malpractice process in South Carolina violates both the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause: â€œWhen comparing plaintiffs in legal malpractice cases to plaintiffs in other cases, plaintiffs in legal malpractice cases are often faced with a judicial tribunal with close professional associations to defendants.â€Â  However, Shaffer does not point to any particular judge or any particular wrong.Â  Instead, he attacks the entire process for adjudicating legal malpractice claims in South Carolina.Â  He offers no evidence to support his contention.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina has enacted numerous ethical guidelines to ensure that every litigant receives a fair trial.Â  Rule 501, SCACR, establishes guidelines for judicial conduct.Â  For example, Canon 3(B)(5) provides as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  A judge shall perform judicial duties without bias or prejudice. A judge shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct manifest bias or prejudice, including but not limited to bias or prejudice based upon race, sex, religion, national origin, disability or age, and shall not permit staff, court officials and others subject to the judgeâ€™s direction and control to do so.\r\n\r\nAs such, rules are in place to protect litigants such as Shaffer from disparate treatment by the courts, and because Shaffer can point to no specific injury he has suffered, this court cannot find that the process for litigating legal malpractice claims in South Carolina denies the plaintiff an impartial tribunal.Â  \r\nFinally, Shaffer provides several remedies for the alleged constitutional violations.Â  These remedies include, but are not limited to, a panel of individuals to assist the court in its decision making; the creation of a state office to provide legal assistance to legal malpractice pro se plaintiffs; and a call for a revision of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure to make them understandable to anyone â€œwith a high school education.â€Â  However, these are not remedies that could be implemented without legislative action and, therefore, we cannot properly rule on these suggestions.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, HUFF and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-349","title":"Roger D. and Brenda D. v.

Garfinkel, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-351\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2006 â€“ Filed October 19, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Jessie J. Glenn, of North Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Cathy T. Sanders, of Hollywood, Respondent Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this domestic action, Charles Sanders (Husband) appeals the order of the family court awarding Cathy Sanders (Wife) alimony.Â  Husband also contends the family court erred by imputing an excessive amount of income to him.Â Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married in 1965 and separated in 2000 after thirty-five years of marriage.Â  They have two children, both of whom are emancipated.Â  \r\nWife has a two-year college degree and worked part-time during the marriage as a medical secretary.Â  During the marriage, Wifeâ€™s primary role was that of homemaker, taking care of the majority of the household duties, including cooking, cleaning, and caring for the partiesâ€™ children. \r\nHusband worked as a management consultant in the apparel industry and earned $100,000 a year.Â  Both children attended private schools and the parties took numerous vacations.Â  In 1976, Husband and Wife built a house on Youngâ€™s Island on land Wife inherited.Â  The parties also had a home in North Carolina in which they lived when Husbandâ€™s employer transferred him there.Â  In addition, Husband and Wife purchased two condominiums in Myrtle Beach for investment purposes.Â  Â \r\nThe parties maintained a high standard of living until 1996, when they filed for bankruptcy.Â  Husband claims he lost his job because the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in the early 1990s caused his employment opportunities to move overseas.Â  Although he received numerous job offers, he did not accept any of the offers because he did not want to live abroad.Â  Husband is currently employed as a starter ranger on a golf course and makes six dollars an hour. Â Â \r\nThe parties separated in May 2000, after Husband confessed he was having an adulterous affair.Â  On June 29, 2004, Wife instituted this action against Husband.Â  By order dated March 15, 2005, the family court granted Wife a divorce based on Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  Further, the family court found Husband was currently â€œwoefully under employedâ€ and found Husband had the ability to earn a substantial income.Â  Accordingly, the family court ordered him to pay Wife two thousand dollars a month in alimony.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002); Lanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 215, 612 S.E.2d 456, 458 (Ct. App. 2005); Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005); Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 213, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992)).Â  This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings, and we remain mindful of the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the parties, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981); Holler v. Holler, 364 S.C. 256, 261, 612 S.E.2d 469, 472 (Ct. App. 2005); see Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating that because the appellate court lacks the opportunity to directly observe the witnesses, it should accord great deference to the family courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility are involved).\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n    Did the family court err by failing to review the applicable statutory factors before awarding Wife alimony of two thousand dollars?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the family court err by imputing an excessive amount of income to Husband?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Alimony Award\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in ordering him to pay Wife alimony in the amount of two thousand dollars per month without considering the applicable statutory factors.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe hold this argument is not preserved for our review.Â  To preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the family court.Â  Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson&nbsp; 368 S.C. 87, 104-05, 627 S.E.2d 765, 775&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (citing Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€)); Jones v. Daley, 363 S.C. 310, 315, 609 S.E.2d 597, 599 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Husband did not raise this argument to the family court.Â  Additionally, Husband failed to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion seeking judicial determination of this issue.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved.Â  See Washington v. Washington, 308 S.C. 549, 551, 419 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1992) (holding when an appellant neither raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to amend, the issue is not properly presented to an appellate court for review).Â  \r\nII.Â Amount of Imputed Income\r\nHusband argues the family court erred by failing to include a specified amount of income imputed to him in the divorce decree before awarding Wife alimony.Â  Husband maintains the divorce decree is devoid of any income imputable to him.Â  We disagree.\r\nHusband did not raise this issue to the family court or in any subsequent Rule 59(e) motion and, therefore, this issue is not preserved for our review. See Riggs v. Riggs, 353 S.C. 230, 237, 578 S.E.2d 3, 6&nbsp;(2003) (citing Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 489 S.E.2d 212 (Ct. App. 1997) (issue must be raised to and ruled on by family court to be preserved for appellate review)).\r\nNext, Husband contends the family court imputed an excessive amount of income to him.Â  Specifically, Husband contends the family court erred by imputing $100,000 to him as income when no evidence suggested Husbandâ€™s change in income was intentional or voluntary.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe rule that Husband failed to present this argument to the family court or make a subsequent Rule 59(e) motion and, therefore, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Hatfield,&nbsp;327 S.C. at 367, 489 S.E.2d at 216&nbsp;(citing Hickman v. Hickman, 301 S.C. 455, 392 S.E.2d 481 (Ct. App. 1990) (issue not presented to and passed upon by the trial court cannot be considered on appeal)).Â  \r\nLastly, Husband argues the family court erred in basing the award of alimony on his income of $100,000, when he earned that amount of income for only fifteen of the thirty-five years the couple was married.Â  We disagree. \r\nWe conclude this argument, having not been raised to and ruled upon by the family court, is not preserved for our review.Â  An issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review. Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004); see also Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 102, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting it is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we find the Appellant did not properly preserve the issues on appeal, we affirm the family courtâ€™s order in its entirety. \r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the Court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-352","title":"State v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., of Columbia, and Solicitor Jerry W. Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â Â Michael Lee Staton (Staton) appeals his conviction for the unlawful possession of a controlled substance, trafficking in methamphetamine, and failure to stop for a law enforcement vehicle.Â  Staton maintains the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting evidence, arguing the chain of custody was not adequately proven by the State.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the night of January 3, 2004, Officer Donald Ward (Ward) attempted to stop Staton because the vehicle he was driving was without a license plate.Â  At the sight of the officerâ€™s blue light, Staton sped up, leading law enforcement on a fifteen-mile car chase that ended only when the vehicle Staton was driving ceased to run.Â  He then fled his vehicle and the pursuit continued on foot.Â  With the help of fellow officer Jeffery Dennie (Dennie), Ward was able to run down and apprehend Staton.Â  On Statonâ€™s person, Ward found a bottle of pills. Â Dennie searched Statonâ€™s vehicle to find syringes, a set of weights, several bags containing a white powder, and a vial of red liquid in the glove compartment. Â Officer Ward was present during the entire time Dennie searched the vehicle, but was otherwise occupied in assisting an individual who had been a passenger in Statonâ€™s car.Â Â  \r\nDennie handed all of the evidence he removed from the car to Ward.Â  Before leaving the scene, Ward handed these items, along with the pill bottle he found on Staton, to investigator Michael Coats (Coats).Â  Ward completed a chain of custody form, stating he seized the bottle of pills, syringes, weights, and bags from Staton and that he subsequently gave them all to Coats.Â  In this documentation, Ward did not note that Dennie was the one who actually, physically removed the evidence from Statonâ€™s car. Â Dennie never recorded his handling of these objects.Â  \r\nAt trial, officers Ward and Dennie testified as to the above facts.Â  Dennie explained that as he was only the secondary officer on the scene and his removal of the evidence from Statonâ€™s vehicle was done in Wardâ€™s presence, he did not believe it was necessary for him to document the brief time he handled the items before passing them along to Ward.Â  \r\nCoats then testified as to receiving the evidence from Ward.Â  He further stated he placed the objects in a tamper-evident â€œbest bag,â€ a type of bag which once sealed, must be torn in order to be reopened.Â  Coats recounted he kept this bag in his officeâ€™s safe until the time it was transferred to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Divisionâ€™s (SLED) secure drug box.Â Â  \r\nGregory Rock, a drug analyst with SLED, reported that although Atra Taylor, another SLED analyst, transported the evidence from SLEDâ€™s secure drug box to their departmentâ€™s drug vault, he personally removed the specimens from the locked drug vault, examined the tamper-evident bag, and noted the integrity of the bag and evidence inside. Â Rock then detailed his chemical tests, which showed the bottle of pills to be comprised of 29 tablets of hydrocodone and acetaminophen (a class III controlled substance) and 30 tablets of alprazolam (a class IV controlled substance). Â The white powder and red liquid both proved to be methamphetamine. \r\nThe prosecution offered these substances as evidence.Â  Staton objected that the requisite chain of possession had not been presented.Â  The court overruled, finding a sufficient chain of custody to be shown and adding that any difference between the trial testimony and the forms went to the credibility of the evidence and not its admissibility.Â  \r\nThe jury found Staton guilty of the unlawful possession of controlled substances, trafficking in methamphetamine, and failure to stop for a law enforcement vehicle.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nÂ The admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent a manifest abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002); State v. Funderburk, 367 S.C. 236, 239, 625 S.E.2d 248, 249-50 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Additionally, the abuse of discretion must be accompanied by probable prejudice.Â  State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Irick, 344 S.C. 460, 464, 545 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2001); State v. Funderburk, 367 S.C. 236, 239, 625 S.E.2d 248, 249-50 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  If there is any evidence to support the trial judge's decision, the appellate courts will affirm it. Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 7, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State v. Taylor, 360 S.C. 18, 598 S.E.2d 735 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nStaton claims the chain of custody presented by the State was fatally deficient and the judge erred in allowing the drugs into evidence.Â  Staton relies on the failure of Taylor to testify as to her custody of the specimens and the fact that Ward did not indicate in his documentation that it was Dennie who actually removed particular items from Statonâ€™s vehicle.\r\nA party offering into evidence fungible items such as drugs must establish a chain of custody as far as practicable, tracing possession from the time the object is seized to the final custodian by whom it is analyzed.Â  See State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419, 424, 544 S.E.2d 835, 837 (2001).Â  Where the analyzed substance has passed through the hands of several persons, the evidence presented must not leave it to conjecture as to who had it and what was done with it in the time between the taking and the analysis.Â  State v. Taylor, 360 S.C. 18, 22-23, 598 S.E.2d 735, 737 (2004).Â  â€œ[I]f the identity of each person in the chain handling the evidence is established, and the manner of handling is reasonably demonstrated, no abuse of discretion is shown in the admission, absent proof of tampering, bad faith, or ill-motive.â€Â  Taylor, 360 S.C. at 25, 598 S.E.2d at 738.Â  However, as long as the sequence of possession is complete, sufficient proof of the chain of custody need not negate all possibility of tampering.Â  Carter, 344 S.C. at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837; State v. Williams, 297 S.C. 290, 293, 376 S.E.2d 773, 774 (1989); State v. Johnson, 318 S.C. 194, 196, 456 S.E.2d 442, 443 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\nOnly where the identity of those who handled the evidence was not established far as practicable, have our appellate courts found evidence inadmissible.Â  Carter, 344 S.C. at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837.Â  In contrast, where the evidence furnishes the identity of those who have handled the substance and the manner in which it was handled, we have found evidence regarding its care to go only the weight of the specimen as credible evidence.Â  Id.Â  â€œIn other words, where there is a weak link in the chain of custody, as opposed to a missing link, the question is only one of credibility, not admissibility.â€Â  Carter, 344 S.C. at 424, 544 S.E.2d at 837.\r\nIn the case at bar, the drugsâ€™ chain of possession was firmly established.Â  The State presented evidence sequencing each person who handled the specimens.Â  Contrary to Statonâ€™s claim, there was no missing analyst.Â  That Atra Taylor did not take the stand is of no consequence.Â  Her involvement in the chain of possession, that of carrying the drugs from SLEDâ€™s secure drug box to the chemical analysis departmentâ€™s drug vault, was presented at trial. Â Proving chain of custody does not require that all personâ€™s in the chain must testify.Â  See Williams, 297 S.C. 290, 376 S.E.2d 773 (affirming trial courtâ€™s decision to admit blood test results even though there was no testimony from the nurse who had drawn the blood of the defendant and placed it in the refrigerator); Taylor, 360 S.C. at 26, 589 S.E.2d at 738-739 (rejecting the appellantâ€™s argument that previous South Carolina Court of Appealsâ€™ cases required that all persons in the chain of custody must testify to establish admissibility).Â  Rock testified that he was the only chemist who actually touched the drugs and that the evidence bag was unbroken and unopened at the time he removed the specimen from the vault.Â  The lack of testimony from Taylor affects only the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.Â  The chain of custody was properly presented.\r\nThe admissibility of the evidence was also unaffected by Officer Wardâ€™s omission in his chain of custody documentation, that is to say his failure to note that Officer Dennie first handled the drugs in Statonâ€™s glove compartment.Â  Both officers testified that Ward was nearby when Dennie searched the car, and even had Ward not been present, the trial testimony nonetheless firmly established the identity of those persons in possession of the evidence and the manner in which it was handled.Â  Any discrepancy between the officersâ€™ testimony and the completed forms implicated the specimensâ€™ credibility but did not render them inadmissible.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nThe was no abuse of discretion in the admission of the drugs into evidence.Â  Accordingly, Statonâ€™s convictions are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-353","title":"SCDSS v.

(Mother).Â  On February 12, 2005, A.N. was admitted to the hospital with at least two fractured ribs, a bruised pancreas, burns to her left arm, face, chest and abdomen, and low hemoglobin due to massive soft tissue injuries to her posterior where blood had pooled.Â  That same day, she was placed into emergency protective custody, pursuant to section 20-7-610(E) of the South Carolina Code (2003).Â  Two days later, the family court held a probable cause hearing and found the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) had probable cause to remove Abigail from her home.Â  DSS filed this action for TPR on February 17, 2005.Â  \r\nA family meeting was held on March 3, 2005, pursuant to section 20-7-762(B) of the South Carolina Code (2003).Â  At the meeting, DSS informed Appellants, all of whom were present, that the TPR action would proceed. Â On March 14, 2005, Appellants went to DSS to speak to a case worker about obtaining custody of Abigail.Â  Appellants informed DSS that they did not want permanent custody of Abigail, and they would only care for her for a short period of time.Â  Significantly, Appellants took no action regarding custody of Abigail even after DSS informed Appellants of its decision to not recommend them for custody.Â  \r\nBy order dated March 9, 2005, the merits hearing for the abuse and neglect action was consolidated with the TPR action.Â  On May 12, 2005, the second day of the hearing, Appellants faxed a notice of motion and motion for intervention pursuant to Rule 24, SCRCP.Â  The motion for intervention was served upon the opposing parties via facsimile that same day.Â  The motion was scheduled to be heard on May 16, 2005.\r\nAt the hearing on the motion to intervene, Dewayne N. submitted an affidavit stating he believed the testimony would show that Mother had no part in injuring Abigail, and that she provided the child with prompt medical attention. Â A DSS caseworker and a DSS supervisor also submitted affidavits, in which they expressed concern that neither Dewayne N. nor Gena N. believed the abuse had occurred.Â  Because these relatives did not believe the child had been abused, DSS believed they â€œcould not be relied upon to provide adequate protection for [the minor child].â€Â Â  \r\nThe family court denied Appellantsâ€™ motion to intervene, finding they failed to provide adequate notice of the motion pursuant to Rule 6(d), SCRCP, and Rule 21(a), SCRFC.Â  Additionally, the family court found that â€œit [was] clearly not in the childâ€™s best interest to continue this case . . . .â€ Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€&nbsp; Ex parte Morris,&nbsp;367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652&nbsp;(2006).&nbsp; However, â€œbecause the family court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad discretion.â€&nbsp; Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623&nbsp;(2003).Â  The standard of\r\nreview for a motion for intervention is whether the judge abused his discretion in granting or denying the\r\nmotion.Â  See, e.g., In re Horry County State Bank, 361 S.C. 503, 507, 604 S.E.2d 723, 725 (Ct. App. 2004).&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the family court erred in denying their motion to intervene. [1]Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellants filed their motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 24 of the South Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure.Â  Rule 6(d), SCRCP, provides for a minimum of ten daysâ€™ notice for written motions and provides, in part:\r\n\r\nWritten motion(s) other than one which may be heard ex parte, and notice of the hearing thereof, shall be served not later than ten days before the time specified for the hearing . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nHere, Appellants provided only four daysâ€™ notice of their motion to intervene to opposing parties, notwithstanding the fact they were aware of both DSSâ€™s intent to file the TPR action as early as March 3, 2005, and of DSSâ€™s decision to not recommend Appellants for custody.Â  The parties were noticed via facsimile on May 12, 2005 that the motion to intervene would be heard on May 16, 2005.Â  Therefore, the family court correctly found Appellantsâ€™ motion to intervene was untimely under Rule 6(d), SCRCP.\r\nAdditionally, in their motion to intervene, Appellants sought temporary custody of Abigail.Â  Therefore, the family court also analyzed their motion under Rule 21 of the South Carolina Rules of Family Court, finding the motion was untimely under that rule as well.Â  We agree.\r\nRule 21(a), SCRFC, provides, in part: â€œA written motion for temporary relief, and notice of the hearing thereof, shall be served not later than five days before the time specifiedÂ  for the hearing . . . .â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  We agree with the family court that Appellantsâ€™ motion was untimely under Rule 21(a),\r\nSCRFC.\r\nMoreover, all matters involving the custody and care of children must be decided in the best interests of the child.Â  Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 285, 555 S.E.2d 386, 388 (2001).Â  In a termination of parental rights case, the\r\nbest interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Our General Assembly has mandated that when the interest of the child and the parental rights conflict, the interest of the child shall prevail.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2005); see also, South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 626-27, 614 S.E.2d 642, 645 (2005) (holding that in balancing the interests of the\r\nchild and the parent, the best interest of the child is paramount to that of the parent). Â The supreme court has held that the termination of parental rights statute must be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by terminating the parent child relationship. Â Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 108, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000); see also S.C. Code Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2005).\r\nWe agree with the family courtâ€™s ruling that it is not in Abigailâ€™s best interest to permit Appellants to intervene.Â  Abigail suffered injuries so severe that she was hospitalized for thirteen days.Â  The family court even took the step of consolidating the merits hearing for the abuse and neglect action with the TPR action in order to expedite the actions to benefit Abigail.[2] Â Moreover, the guardian ad litem determined that it would not be in the minor childâ€™s best interest to delay the hearing to allow Appellants to intervene.Â  Therefore, we do not believe the family court judge abused his discretion in denying the motion to intervene. \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the family court denying Appellantsâ€™ motion to intervene is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Section 20-7-610 of the South Carolina Code (2003) provides that the family may order expedited placement of the child with a suitable relative at the probable cause hearing.Â  While Appellantsâ€™ motion to intervene states this section as a basis for their intervention, the probable cause hearing had already been held when the motion to intervene was filed.Â  Moreover, the family courtâ€™s order does not address this argument, and Appellants failed to file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion on this issue.Â  Therefore, we find this issue unpreserved for appellate review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\n[2] No party challenges the family courtâ€™s consolidation of the merits hearing for the abuse and neglect action with the TPR action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-354","title":"Morgan v.

Kinard Johnson, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-354\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2006 â€“ Filed October 19, 2006Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLisa Richardson Mobley, of Greenville, for Appellant\r\nRose Mary McGregor, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Kim Morgan appeals the family courtâ€™s affirmance of the South Carolina Department of Social Servicesâ€™ (DSS) order finding an indicated case of Morganâ€™s physical neglect of a student at the childcare center at which Morgan worked.Â  She also appeals the placement of her name on the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis case arises from an incident in which a three-year old special needs child was left on a childcare centerâ€™s bus for approximately four hours.Â  Â Morgan worked at A Childâ€™s Haven childcare center where her primary responsibility was that of lead teacher and classroom manager of the three to four-year old classroom.Â  One day a week, she would serve as monitor on one of the centerâ€™s buses.Â  On the day of the incident, the child boarded the bus on which Morgan served as monitor at 7:56 a.m. Â Another center employee drove the bus.Â  The bus arrived at the childcare center at 8:56 a.m.Â  At approximately 1:00 p.m., the bus driver returned to the bus for the afternoon run and discovered the child still strapped in her seatbelt on the bus.Â  The driver brought the child to the director, gave her a banana and juice, and then took her home.[2]Â  \r\nThe childâ€™s aunt testified that on the night of the incident, the child was crying a lot, clingy, wanted to be held, and would not sleep in her own bed. Since then, the child has exhibited fearful behaviors such as kicking, crying, restlessness, and a continued refusal to sleep in her own bed.Â  { The child had previously been diagnosed with aggressive behavior with developmental delays.[3]Â  \r\nThe director of the childcare center immediately reported the incident to the DSS, which cited the center for lack of supervision.Â  The director of the center and DSS entered into a corrective action plan on September 29, 2004.Â Â  Â Â \r\nDSS also commenced an investigation of Morgan and the driver of the bus.Â  Investigator Bobby Seepersaud interviewed Morgan, the driver, the center director, and others involved. Â He concluded the incident was an indicated case of physical neglect. Morganâ€™s name was placed on the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect pursuant to S.C. Code section 20-7-670(I).[4]Â  Morgan appealed this determination.Â  After a fair hearing, DSS upheld the indicated finding of physical neglect.Â  Morgan appealed to the family court, which affirmed DSSâ€™s decision.Â  Morgan filed a motion to alter or amend asking that at least her name be removed from the Central Registry.Â  The family court found it had no discretion under section 20-7-670 regarding the placement of Morganâ€™s name upon an indicated finding of physical neglect.Â  Accordingly, the court denied her motion.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the decision of DSS, the standard of review set forth in the Administrative Procedures Act applies. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-655 (Supp. 2005).Â  Thus, the reviewing court must not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  The court may not overrule an agencyâ€™s decision unless: \r\n\r\nsubstantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are:\r\n(a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n(b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n(c) made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n(d) affected by other error of law;\r\n(e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record;Â  or\r\n(f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â Â  \r\nâ€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed blindly from one side, but is evidence which, when considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the agency reached.â€Â  Tennis v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 355 S.C. 551, 558, 585 S.E.2d 312, 316 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Finding of neglect\r\nMorgan argues the family court erred in finding that she had physically neglected the child.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAccording to statute, â€œchild abuse or neglectâ€ occurs when a person responsible for the childâ€™s welfare â€œinflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or engages in acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or mental injury to the child . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Â§ 20-7-490(2)(a) (Supp. 2005).Â  â€œA person responsible for a childâ€™s welfareâ€ includes a caregiver at a childcare facility.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-490(3) (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nMorgan was serving as a caregiver at a childcare facility at the time of the incident.Â  In her brief, Morgan asserts that it was the bus driver rather than she who was the â€œperson responsible for the childâ€™s welfare.â€Â  However, at the hearing, Morgan acknowledged that as the bus monitor it was her responsibility to buckle the children in, monitor behavior, help the driver with any problems on the bus, and get the children off the bus.Â  In this case, she failed to unbuckle the child and left her on the bus for four hours.Â  Being left strapped in a closed vehicle for four hours certainly â€œpresent[s] a substantial risk of physical or mental injury to the child.â€Â  As DSSâ€™s Final Administrative Order notes, â€œIt was fortunate that the day this happened was overcast and not bright and sunny or the consequences to [the child] could have been severe, placing her in great risk of physical harm or death.â€Â  \r\nAccordingly, we agree with the circuit court that DSSâ€™s finding of an indicated case of abuse or neglect is supported by substantial evidence. Â \r\n2.Â  Equal Protection\r\nMorgan argues the application of South Carolina Code section 20-7-670 regarding intervention by child welfare agencies violates her rights to equal protection under the law as childcare employees are treated differently and are not afforded the same rights and privileges as individuals employed in other similarly situated facilities and institutions.Â  Morgan failed to raise this issue to the circuit court.Â  Accordingly, we find the issue is not properly before this court.Â  In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001) (constitutional claim must be raised to and ruled upon by the lower court to be preserved for appellate review).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above stated reasons, the order of the family court is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and SHORT, JJ. concur.Â \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The child normally would have breakfast, lunch, and afternoon snack at the center.Â  \r\n[3] The childâ€™s birth mother had used drugs during her pregnancy and the child was born with crack cocaine in her system.Â  When the child was four months old, her father dropped her on the floor and she fractured her skull. \r\n[4] This section provides:\r\n\r\nWhen the investigation performed pursuant to this section results in a determination that an individual has harmed a child or threatened a child with harm, as defined in Section 20-7-490, the name of that individual must be entered immediately in the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect. The department must notify the individual in writing by certified mail that his name has been entered in the registry, of his right to request an appeal of the decision to enter his name in the registry, and of the possible ramifications regarding future employment and licensing if he allows his name to remain in the registry. The procedures set forth in Section 20-7-655 apply when an individual challenges the entry of his name in the registry and challenges of the entry in the registry pursuant to this subsection must be given expedited review in the appellate process.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann.

Weinberg, Jr., of Sumter, for Appellant.\r\nThomas E. Player, Jr., of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this action for breach of a construction contract, Enon Missionary Baptist Church (Church) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to J.W. Neal Construction Company (Contractor).Â  On appeal, Church argues the construction contract required Contractor to procure a performance and payment bond and Contractorâ€™s failure to obtain this bond justified Churchâ€™s rescission of the contract.[1]Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nChurch decided to construct a building on its property and hired Thomas R. King as its architect.[2]Â  King invited bids on the construction project from general contractors.Â  Contractor was a newly formed general contracting company, owned solely by Wilfred Neal and run by Wilfred and his father, Joshua Neal.Â  On May 10, 2002, Contractor submitted its bid to King.Â  Three days later, King informed Contractor it was the lowest bidder and awarded Contractor the job.Â  \r\nOn June 17, 2002, Joshua and the Reverend Stanley Hayes, the churchâ€™s pastor, executed a construction contract (the Contract), entitled â€œAIA Document A101 Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Contractor.â€Â  Section 9.1.2 of the Contract incorporates a list of conditions (the General Conditions), entitled â€œAIA Document A201 General Conditions of the Contract for Construction.â€Â  In addition, section 9.1.4 of the Contract incorporates the bidding requirements and specifications previously provided to Contractor as part of its bidding package.Â  \r\nSection 11.4.1 of the General Conditions provides:\r\n\r\nThe Owner [Church] shall have the right to require the Contractor to furnish bonds covering faithful performance of the Contract and payment of obligations arising thereunder as stipulated in bidding requirements or specifically required in the Contract Documents on the date of execution of the Contract.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  No other part of the Contract, either expressly or through incorporation, requires a performance or payment bond. \r\nOn September 10, 2002, the National Bank of South Carolina (NBSC) issued a loan commitment to Church to fund the project.Â  On the same day, Contractor received a copy of this commitment.Â  The commitment requires a performance and payment bond.Â  As a result, Contractor attempted to procure a bond.Â  \r\nContractor had trouble obtaining the bond because it was a new company.Â  As a result, on December 10, 2002, King informed Contractor that Church decided to terminate the Contract.Â  Contractor responded, informing King and Church the Contract had no bond requirement, indicating Contractor obtained a bond on the day before, and requesting a meeting to work out the problem.Â  A letter dated December 11 shows Adams Eaddy &amp; Associates (Bonding Company) had approved, but not issued, a bond to Contractor.Â  \r\nOn Monday, December 16, 2002, the parties met.Â  According to Churchâ€™s minutes from this meeting, King talked to Bonding Companyâ€™s agent, who informed him the bond should be issued by the end of the week.Â  The minutes also reflect Church informed Contractor it was negotiating with a different contractor and â€œthe other contractor has a legitimate chance of obtaining the project if . . . Neal failed to obtain the bond at a reasonable time.â€\r\nOn Friday, December 20, 2002, Bonding Company issued a performance and payment bond to Contractor.Â  Hayes and Budden wrote Contractor on the same day, explaining, â€œAt the meeting . . . you [Joshua] stated . . . you would have the bond by this week which would be December 18, 2002.â€Â  The letter also states â€œthe other contractor has a legitimate chance of obtaining the project if [Contractor] failed to obtain the bond at the time he stated which would have been December 19, 2002.â€Â  Hayes testified in his deposition that Joshua told him to get another contractor if he did not have the bond by December 18.Â  Despite the fact Contractor had a bond on December 20, Church rescinded the Contract.Â  As a result, Church hired a new general contractor. \r\nSubsequently, Contractor filed a complaint against Church for breach of the Contract.Â  After Church answered, Contractor moved for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court held a hearing and ultimately granted Contractorâ€™s motion, holding the Contract contained no performance and payment bond requirement and any modification of the Contract to include a bond requirement was not supported by consideration.Â  Alternatively, the circuit court held if the Contract did require a bond, Churchâ€™s rescission of the Contract based on this requirement was unjustified.Â  The circuit court left the issue of damages for a jury.Â  Church appealed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the circuit court.Â  David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3&nbsp;(2006).Â  The circuit court should grant summary judgment â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Byrd v. City of Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 656, 620 S.E.2d 76, 79&nbsp;(2005).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Section 11.4.1 of the General Conditions\r\nChurch contends the circuit court erred in holding section 11.4.1 of the General Conditions did not require Contractor to obtain a performance and payment bond.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe construction and enforcement of an unambiguous contract is a question of law for the court, and thus can be properly disposed of at summary judgment.Â  Middleborough Horizâ€™l Prop. Regime Council of Co-Owners v. Montedison\r\nS.p.A., 320 S.C. 470, 477, 465 S.E.2d 765, 770&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  The cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal effect to the partiesâ€™ intentions as determined by the contract language.Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134&nbsp;(2003).Â  â€œThe judicial function of a court of law is to enforce contracts as made by the parties and not to re-write or distort, under the guise of judicial construction, the terms of an unambiguous contract.â€Â  Dobyns v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Parks, Rec. &amp; Tourism, 325 S.C. 97, 103, 480 S.E.2d 81, 84&nbsp;(1997).Â  When the language of a written contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract shall determine the rights and obligations of the parties.Â  Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Rec. Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 8, 605 S.E.2d 744, 747&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nSection 11.4.1 of the General Conditions unambiguously requires another portion of the Contract to trigger Churchâ€™s right to require a performance and payment bond.Â  The bidding requirements provided to Contractor do not require a performance and payment bond.Â  In fact, King specifically testified he omitted the bond requirement from the specifications and bid requirements provided to Contractor.Â  Moreover, Church admitted no other provision of the Contract required such a bond at the summary judgment hearing: â€œThere is no question about it . . . itâ€™s [the bond requirementâ€™s] not on the face of the contractor papers or bid papers.â€Â  Additionally, in his deposition, Hayes explained Church would cover the cost of the bond when Contractor obtained it â€œbecause it wasnâ€™t in the initial contract.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Under a plain reading of section 11.4.1, Church does not have a right to require Contractor to furnish a performance and payment bond.[3]\r\nII. Kingâ€™s Deposition Testimony\r\nChurch next argues Kingâ€™s deposition testimony indicates that, prior to execution of the Contract, the parties agreed to include a bond requirement.Â  The circuit court did not rule on this issue, and Church did not make a Rule 59, SCRCP, motion to obtain a ruling on this issue.Â  Accordingly, Church failed to preserve this issue for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v.

Churchâ€™s Rescission\r\nFinally, Church takes exception to the circuit courtâ€™s holding that if a performance and payment bond were required by the Contract, Contractorâ€™s failure to obtain the bond within the time specified by Church did not constitute a material breach of the Contract justifying Churchâ€™s rescission.Â  Because the Contract clearly does not require Contractor to obtain a performance and payment bond, we decline to address this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court properly held the Contract did not require Contractor to obtain a performance and payment bond.Â  Moreover, Church failed to preserve the issue of the effect of a prior agreement between the parties on the Contract.Â  Furthermore, we need not address the issue of whether Contractorâ€™s failure to obtain a performance and payment bond justified Churchâ€™s rescission of the Contract.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Both the partiesâ€™ briefs and the circuit courtâ€™s order refer to Churchâ€™s â€œrepudiationâ€ of the contract.Â  A â€œrepudiationâ€ is â€œ[a] contracting partyâ€™s words or actions that indicate an intention not to perform the contract in the future; a threatened breach of contract.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1306 (7th ed. 1999).Â  A â€œrescissionâ€ is â€œ[a] partyâ€™s unilateral unmaking of a contract for a legally sufficient reason, such as the other partyâ€™s material breach.â€Â  Id. at 1308.Â  A review of the case reveals the issue is whether Churchâ€™s rescission of the contract is justified.\r\n[2] In his deposition, Hazel Budden, a member of Churchâ€™s board of trustees, testified the building would be a church.Â  However, a loan commitment indicates the building would be a â€œFamily Life Center.â€ \r\n[3] In its appellate brief, Church does not argue that subsequent to execution the contract was modified to include the bonding requirement.Â  Therefore, this issue is not properly before this court for review.Â  See State v. Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 192, 519 S.E.2d 786, 789 (1999).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-356","title":"Friends of McLeod v.

McDonald and O. Benjamin Peeples, Jr., both of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam C. Cleveland, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Friends of McLeod, Inc. (Friends) brought an action against the Historic Charleston Foundation (the Foundation) asserting the Foundation failed to comply with the provisions of the Last Will of William E. McLeod by selling property known as the McLeod Plantation.Â  The circuit court granted the Foundationâ€™s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(h), SCRCP, concluding it did not have subject matter jurisdiction because an action to construe a will must first be brought in the probate court, pursuant to section 62-1-302 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  We affirm as modified.\r\n1. The circuit court correctly held it was without subject matter jurisdiction to hear this action, which seeks to construe a will.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(a)(1) (Supp. 2005) (â€œTo the full extent permitted by the Constitution, and except as otherwise specifically provided, the probate court has exclusive original jurisdiction over all subject matter related to . . . estates of decedents, including the contest of wills, construction of wills, and determination of heirs and successors of decedents and estates of protected persons; . . . .â€)Â  (emphasis added).Â  This statute clearly states the construction of wills is within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the probate court.Â  See S.C. Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 470, 602 S.E.2d 81, 82 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œStatutory interpretation is a question of law.â€).Â  Friends relies solely on pre-1987 cases that provide the circuit court has jurisdiction to construe the terms of a will.Â  In 1987, however, the legislature amended section 62-1-302(a)(1) by adding the word â€œprobateâ€ before the word â€œcourt.â€Â  The legislatureâ€™s inclusion of the word â€œprobateâ€ clearly evinces the intent to grant the probate court â€œexclusive original jurisdictionâ€ in such matters.Â  Therefore, reliance on pre-1987 cases is misplaced.Â  The law does authorize the removal of certain actionsâ€”including an action to construe a willâ€”from the probate court to the circuit court.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(d) (Supp. 2005) (â€œNotwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction of the probate court over the foregoing matters, any action or proceeding filed in the probate court and relating to the following subject matters, on motion of a party, or by the court on its own motion, made not later than ten days following the date on which all responsive pleadings must be filed, must be removed to the circuit\r\ncourt and in these cases the circuit court shall proceed upon the matter de novo: . . . (2) construction of wills; . . . .â€).\r\n2.Â  Because the circuit court correctly determined it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain this matter in the first instance, the additional findings of the circuit court are vacated.Â  See Simmons v. Simmons, 370 S.C. 109, __, 634 S.E.2d 1, 4 (Ct. App. 2006) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an order entered by a court without subject matter jurisdiction is utterly void.â€).Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-357","title":"Tretola v.

Tretola, of Lancaster, pro se.\r\nDon S. Rushing, of Lancaster, for Respondents Daniel McKay and Lancaster Hospital Corporation, d/b/a Springs Memorial Hospital.\r\nPope D. Johnson, III, of Columbia, for Respondent Parker Poe Adams &amp; Bernstein, L.L.P.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Robert J. Tretola appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Parker Poe Adams &amp; Bernstein, L.L.P. (Law Firm), Daniel McKay, and Lancaster Hospital Corporation, d/b/a Springs Memorial Hospital (Hospital), on Tretolaâ€™s causes of action for violation of his attorney-client privilege, invasion of privacy, civil conspiracy, and breach of contract.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe present litigation arose out of a lawsuit in the federal court between Hospital and SouthCross Surgery Center, L.L.C., both of whom were vying for a certificate of need (CON) to establish an ambulatory surgery center in Lancaster County, South Carolina. Â \r\nSouthCross was formed in September 2002 by Tretola, a Lancaster physician working as a surgeon for Hospital, and several surgeons from the Charlotte area.Â  About the same time SouthCrossâ€™s CON application was pending, twelve investors, including Tretola and McKay, Hospitalâ€™s chief executive officer, formed SportSouth, L.L.C., a land development company.Â  SportSouth later entered into an arrangement with Hospital whereby SportSouth would build use property on which it had acquired an option to build an ambulatory surgery center that Hospital would lease.Â  By letter dated July 29, 2003, Tretola communicated to McKay his support of this endeavor.\r\nIn the spring of 2003, Tretola, on McKayâ€™s advice, had met with attorney David Summer, who was affiliated with Law Firm, and retained Law Firm to seek a withdrawal from SouthCross and a refund of his investment interest.Â  Although Law Firm initiated a lawsuit on Tretolaâ€™s behalf claiming damages for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, Tretola later expressed frustration with Law Firm and hired a different attorney to take over his case.\r\nDuring the course of Tretolaâ€™s lawsuit, SouthCross deposed both Tretola and McKay.Â  Apparently, their testimony conflicted about certain events leading up to DHECâ€™s review of SouthCrossâ€™s CON application.Â  Subsequently, DHEC issued a CON to Hospital and denied a CON to SouthCross.Â  SouthCross then filed a lawsuit in the federal district court against Hospital, SportSouth, McKay, and Tretola, alleging civil conspiracy.\r\nDuring the federal litigation, SouthCross deposed a SportSouth partner who produced a letter dated February 19, 2004, from Summer to Hospitalâ€™s corporate attorney.[2]Â  According to the letter, it was copied to both McKay and Miller, Hospitalâ€™s president.Â  In the letter, Summer suggested Tretolaâ€™s â€œspeculative statementsâ€ during the deposition he gave in his own lawsuit against SouthCross resulted in the federal court action.Â  Summer also noted he previously represented Tretola and the two had mutually agreed to end the relationship.\r\nHospital and McKay asked the federal court for an order protecting the letter as a privileged attorney-client communication.Â  Although the district court held Hospital and McKay had waived their attorney-client privilege regarding information in the letter, it protected information in the letter pertaining to Tretola on the ground that he had not waived his attorney-client privilege. \r\nAfter discovering the letter, Tretola filed a complaint alleging (1) violation of his attorney-client privilege by Summer and Law Firm for disseminating information in the letter; (2) invasion of his right to privacy against Summer, Miller, and McKay for publishing the letter to SportSouth and Edwards; and (3) civil conspiracy against Hospital, Summer, Miller, and McKay for attempting to make Tretola a â€œscapegoatâ€ in the pending federal action.Â  Tretola further alleged Hospital, through McKay and Miller, breached an oral contract whereby Tretola would provide a statement in favor of granting a CON to Hospital and receive first priority to invest in the new ambulatory surgery center.Â  \r\nMcKay and Hospital answered and moved to dismiss.Â  Law Firm also filed a motion to dismiss.Â  The trial court held a hearing, at which Law Firm, McKay, and Hospital (collectively Respondents) converted their motions and asked for summary judgment.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to Respondents.[3]Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Tretolaâ€™s first issue on appeal concerns alleged procedural irregularities surrounding the trial courtâ€™s handling of the summary judgment motion.Â  Specifically, Tretola appears to assert (1) he lacked sufficient time and opportunity to conduct discovery; and (2) the subject of the hearing had been abruptly changed from a motion for judgment on the pleadings to one for summary judgment without allowing him to respond to newly submitted documents or to produce documents of his own.Â  Because, however, the trial court did not make any specific rulings on these issues and the record does not indicate Tretola raised them in a motion to alter or amend the appealed order, these exceptions are not preserved for appellate review.[4]\r\n2.Â  In Tretolaâ€™s second issue on appeal, he makes the additional argument that â€œwhat little evidence we have is clearly in disputeâ€ and, based on this assertion, contends additional discovery is warranted.Â  Notwithstanding this assertion, for reasons explained below we decline to reverse the grant of summary judgment to Respondents.\r\n3.Â  Tretola next argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim for violation of attorney-client privilege through the dissemination of the February 19, 2004 letter.Â  He takes direct issue with the trial courtâ€™s determination that this State does not recognize a private cause of action for violation of an attorney-client privilege.Â  We reject this argument.Â  \r\nIn addition to holding that â€œSouth Carolina does not recognize the cause of action for violation of the attorney/client privilege,â€ the trial court further noted that â€œthere exists an order of the federal court in the underlying action which gives rise to [Tretolaâ€™s] claims in this action which order specifically finds no waiver of [Tretolaâ€™s] attorney-client privilege and which prohibits any use of the letter and of any privileged information relative to [Tretola], if any.â€Â  We view this statement, which is tantamount to a finding that Tretola was not adversely affected by the dissemination of the letter, as an independent ground for the grant of summary judgment on his claim for violation of his attorney-client privilege.[5]Â  Because Tretola does not challenge this determination on appeal, we are compelled to affirm the grant of summary judgment on this cause of action.[6]\r\n4.Â  We find no merit to Tretolaâ€™s contention that the trial court mischaracterized one of his claims as one for fraud when it was actually one for breach of contract.Â  To the contrary, it appears that, because Tretola labeled his fourth cause of action as one for â€œFraud (Breach of Contract),â€ the trial court was willing to consider whether either fraud or breach of contract would be a viable theory for recovery in this lawsuit.Â  Having determined that, even under a liberal construction of the complaint, Tretola could not proceed on a fraud claim because he failed to allege the necessary elements, the trial court then attempted to determine if Tretola could proceed on an action for breach of contract.Â  The trial court then held there was no evidence presenting a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Tretola had a valid contract with McKay and Hospital entitling him to an opportunity to invest in Hospitalâ€™s new ambulatory surgery center.Â  We agree with this holding.Â  Tretolaâ€™s affidavit indicates only that McKay had advised him physicians practicing at Hospital would be offered â€œpreferential and first choiceâ€ to invest in the center and that, at the request of McKay and Hospital, he signed a form letter supporting the project.Â  Nowhere in the affidavit does he even suggest that his support for the center was given in exchange for the right of first refusal to invest in it.[7]Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on Tretolaâ€™s action for breach of contract.[8]\r\n5.Â  We reject Tretolaâ€™s argument that the trial court should have held Law Firm in default because it did not file an answer.Â  The record does not indicate Tretola ever raised this issue to the trial court or otherwise attempt to obtain a ruling; therefore, Tretola did not preserve this issue for our review.[9]Â  In any event, Law Firmâ€™s timely motion under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, would have extended the time that it would have had to file an answer if the trial court had denied the motion.[10]\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The deponent testified he could not remember where he got this letter.\r\n[3] In the appealed order, the trial court noted Miller had been served only two weeks before the hearing and Summer had not been served at all. \r\n[4]Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding an issue not explicitly ruled on by the trial court is not preserved for appellate review when the appellant fails to move to alter or amend the judgment on that ground).\r\n[5]Â  In other words, the trial court relied on the requirement that a plaintiff must show damages to recover on a private cause of action in tort.Â  Cf. Baggerly v. CSX Transp., Op. No. 26208 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Aug. 28, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 34, at 49, 53) (noting â€œdamage proximately resulting from the breach of dutyâ€ an element of a negligence cause of action).\r\n[6]Â  See Anderson v. Short, 323 S.C. 522, 525, 476 S.E.2d 475, 477&nbsp;(1996) (affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision because it was based on two grounds, only one of which was appealed); Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 161, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544&nbsp;(1970) (recognizing an unappealed decision of the circuit court, â€œright or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmanceâ€), Weeks v. McMillan, 291 S.C. 287, 292, 353 S.E.2d 289, 292 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œWhere a decision is based on alternative grounds, either of which independent of the other is sufficient to support it, the decision will not be reversed even if one of the grounds is erroneous.â€).\r\n[7]Â  See Prestwick Golf Club, Inc. v. Prestwick Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 331 S.C. 385, 390, 503 S.E.2d 184, 187&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998) (â€œIn order for a contract to be binding, there must be a mutual manifestation of assent between the parties to the terms of the contract.â€).\r\n[8]Â  In the section of his brief concerning his breach of contract claim, Tretola includes arguments that (1) the trial court misinterpreted his allegations relating to his cause of action for conspiracy; (2) the trial court treated him unfairly because he was representing himself; and (3) the trial court improperly considered statements of counsel as evidence.Â  We hold these arguments do not comply with Rule 208(b)(1), SCACR, and decline to address them for that reason.\r\n[9] See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733&nbsp;(1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\n[10] See Rule 12(a), SCRCP (providing that the service of certain motions alters the time allotted to a defendant to serve an answer and noting that, unless the court orders otherwise, the responsive pleading is to be served within 15 days after notice of the courtâ€™s action if the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition until the trial on the merits). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-358","title":"State v.

Fleming, of Columbia, for Respondent Wachovia Mortgage Corporation.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Dale C. Pfeil, II, doing business as DP Associates, appeals the grant of partial summary judgment to Steven Walker Homes, L.L.C. and its principals (collectively Walker[1]), and the grant of summary judgment to all other defendants. Â We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nWalker, a home builder, purchased property in Fort Mill, South Carolina, for development purposes and NationsBank financed the purchase.Â  This appeal focuses on two lots in the developed property: Â Lot 33 in Wentworth Subdivision, and Lot 130 in Keswick Subdivision.Â  \r\nPfeil was a masonry subcontractor for Walker.Â  When Walker began experiencing serious financial difficulties, Pfeil served and filed mechanicâ€™s liens on thirteen of the lots in the subdivisions on which he had performed work.Â  Pfeil then brought an action to foreclose his mechanicâ€™s liens, and John Peterson, an attorney from Harper, Peterson, Richards &amp; Reno, P.A. (the law firm) answered on Walkerâ€™s behalf. Â After accepting partial payments from Walker, Pfeil dropped his mechanicâ€™s liens and sought the remaining monies owed to him through a debt collection action. Â He eventually obtained a confession of judgment from Walker. Â \r\nIn the interim, NationsBank brought an action to foreclose its mortgages, and named Pfeil as a defendant.Â  Pfeil defaulted.Â  \r\nIn an effort to maximize return for Walkerâ€™s creditors, Marvin Barman, a workout specialist, was engaged to seek private buyers for several parcels instead of resorting to a public sale.Â  As a result, Lot 33, which had a partially built home, was bought by Pamela Macaluso, who completed the construction and sold the property to Daniel and Melissa Luithele.Â  Brian Wilson was the closing attorney on the sale.Â  Lot 130, undeveloped at the time, was purchased by Crown Homes, which resold it to Joanne Anderson, whose purchase was financed by Wachovia Mortgage.Â  Pfeil had yet to file his confession of judgment at the time of the transfers.Â  \r\nIn order to sell both Lot 33 and Lot 130, Walker had to obtain releases from certain creditors and use its own funds to pay closing costs.Â  Walker received no money from either closing, and all the proceeds were paid to NationsBank, the primary lienholder on the respective lots.Â  \r\nPfeil filed an action to enforce his judgment against Walker.Â  At the time, Walker had no assets, so Pfeil sought to pierce the corporate veil and obtain personal judgments against Berzansky and Peery. Â Pfeil later amended his complaint to set aside the conveyance of Lot 33 and Lot 130 to the Luitheles and Anderson, claiming the conveyances were fraudulent and unlawful, or both.Â  In addition he alleged breach of trust by Walker and civil conspiracy, unfair trade practices, and intentional harm against Walker, Wilson, Barman, and the law firm.Â  \r\nWilson, Barman, and the law firm filed motions for summary judgment, which the circuit court granted.Â  Walker also moved for summary judgment, which the circuit court partially granted.Â  The circuit court denied Walker summary judgment on Pfeilâ€™s claims to enforce the confession of judgment, for veil piercing, and for breach of trust.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to all defendants on Pfeilâ€™s fraudulent conveyance claim?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to all defendants on Pfeilâ€™s unlawful assignment claim?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.\r\n       Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to Walker, Wilson, Barman, and the law firm on Pfeilâ€™s unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and intentional harm claims?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the circuit court.Â  David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3&nbsp;(2006).Â  The circuit court should grant summary judgment â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Underwood v. Coponen, 367 S.C. 214, 217, 625 S.E.2d 236, 237&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Fraudulent Conveyance\r\nPfeil argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to all defendants on his fraudulent conveyance claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Statute of Elizabeth, codified at section 27-23-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), renders void any transfer of property made with the â€œintent or purpose to delay, hinder, or\r\ndefraud creditors and others.â€Â  Carr&nbsp;v. Guerard, 365 S.C. 151, 153-54, 616 S.E.2d 429, 430&nbsp;(2005).Â  When a transfer is supported by valuable consideration, it may be set aside as a fraudulent conveyance only if an actual intent to defraud creditors may be imputable to the grantee.Â  Royal Z Lanes, Inc. v. Collins Holding Corp., 337 S.C. 592, 594, 524 S.E.2d 621, 622&nbsp;(1999). \r\nA creditor seeking to void a transfer need not establish actual knowledge of, or participation in, the debtorâ€™s fraudulent intention by the grantee.Â  See Coleman v. Daniel, 261 S.C. 198, 210, 199 S.E.2d 74, 80&nbsp;(1973).Â  Rather, â€œ[t]he transaction is subject to attack if at the time of the transfer the transferee had notice of circumstances which would arouse the suspicion of an ordinarily prudent man and cause him to make inquiry as to the purpose for which the transfer was being made, which would disclose the fraudulent intent of the maker.â€Â  Id. at 210-11, 199 S.E.2d at 80.Â  \r\nIn this case, both transfers were supported by valuable consideration.Â  Accordingly, Pfeil must show Walkerâ€™s alleged fraudulent is imputable to the grantees.Â  Pfeil essentially alleges Walker had fraudulent intent because it preferred NationsBank over Pfeil.Â  However, â€œ[a] mere knowledge that the effect of [a] preference would be to hinder or delay other creditors is not sufficient to taint the transaction, if there be no actual intent that the preference shall have such result.â€Â  McElwee v. Kennedy, 56 S.C. 154, 172, 34 S.E. 86, 92 (1899).Â  The transfers here provided no benefit to Walker save the cancellation of a preexisting debt to NationsBank.Â  Therefore, Pfeil has only shown an intent by Walker to pay NationsBank, the priority secured lender on Lot 33 and Lot 130.Â  Because Pfeil cannot show fraudulent intent by Walker, he cannot show a similar intent by grantees.\r\nAdditionally, NationBankâ€™s status as a secured creditor with respect to Lot 33 and Lot 130 thwarts Pfeilâ€™s fraudulent conveyance theory.Â  In Owings&nbsp;v. Graham,&nbsp;120 S.C. 408, 451, 113 S.E. 279, 293&nbsp;(1922), our supreme court held that to be fraudulent, â€œthe subject-matter of [a conveyance] should be something out of which the creditor could otherwise have realized all or a portion of his claim.â€ Â \r\nPfeil does not argue his claim, unsecured at the time of these transfers, took priority over the claim of NationsBank or other secured creditors.Â  Even if Pfeil had been a lien creditor at the time of the transfers, he would not have had priority over NationsBank because NationsBank had a properly recorded mortgage on both Lot 33 and Lot 130.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-7-10 (Supp. 2005) (providing mortgagee with properly recorded mortgage on real property priority over lien creditors and other creditors).Â  Pfeil does not dispute NationsBank had first priority in any proceeds from the sale of both Lot 33 and Lot 130.Â  In this case, Pfeil produced no evidence that he would have received payment of his debt had Walker not transferred Lot 33 or Lot 130.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to all respondents on Pfeilâ€™s fraudulent conveyance claim.[3]\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Unlawful Assignment\r\nPfeil contends the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to all defendants on his unlawful assignment claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 27-25-10 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nAny assignment by an insolvent debtor of his property for the benefit of his creditors in which any preference or priority is given to any creditor or creditors of the debtor by the terms of the assignment over any other creditor or creditors, other than as to any debts . . . in which any provision or disposition of the property so assigned is made or directed other than that it be distributed among all creditors of the insolvent debtor equally, in proportion to the amount of their several demands and without preference or priority of any kind whatsoever . . . shall be absolutely null and void and of no effect whatsoever.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nWe reiterate NationsBank filed a properly recorded mortgage on both Lot 33 and Lot 130.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-7-10 (Supp. 2005).Â  The proceeds from the transfers here benefited only NationsBank and other junior, secured creditors.Â  Pfeil does not dispute that these creditors had a right to any proceeds from these transfers over any unsecured creditors or lien creditors.Â  Thus, it does not meet the emphasized condition of 27-25-10 that without the transfer, Pfeil would have taken equally from the proceeds of this sale.Â  Accordingly, we hold the circuit court properly found Pfeil failed to show a violation of section 27-25-10.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Other Causes of Action\r\nPfeil argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Wilson, Barman, the law firm, and Walker on his unfair trade practice, civil conspiracy, and intentional harm claims.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo recover pursuant to the Unfair Trade Practices Act, â€œone must prove each of the following three elements by the greater weight or preponderance of the evidence: Â 1) a violation of the Act, 2) proximate cause, and 3) damages.â€ Â Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v. Miller Housing Corp., 318 S.C. 471, 482, 458 S.E.2d 431, 438&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  In this case, Pfeil alleges Wilson, Barman, and the law firm misled grantees, neglected to inform grantees of Pfeilâ€™s pending claim, and failed to adequately disclose conflicts of interest to grantees.Â  \r\nâ€œA civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more parties joined for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff, thereby causing . . . special damages.â€Â  Angus v. Burroughs &amp; Chapin Co., 368 S.C. 167, 170, 628 S.E.2d 261, 262&nbsp;(2006).Â  In his appellate brief, Pfeil characterizes the civil conspiracy that Walker, Wilson, Barman, and the law firm engaged in a plan â€œto sell [Walkerâ€™s] property without paying creditors like Pfeil even if the claim was known to be pending on the public record.â€Â  \r\nBased on Pfeilâ€™s appellate brief, we interpret his claim of intentional harm to be a claim for intentional deprivation of a pecuniary or protected property interest.Â  â€œA person who does any tortious act for the purpose of causing harm to another or to his things or to the pecuniary interests of another is liable to the other for such harm if it results.â€Â  Stewart v. Martin,&nbsp;232 S.C. 483, 487, 102 S.E.2d 886, 888&nbsp;(1958) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nEven if the acts alleged here rose to the level of an unfair or deceptive trade practice, a civil conspiracy, or an intent to harm Pfeilâ€™s pecuniary or protected property interest, Pfeil fails to produce evidence he was damaged.Â  For the reasons stated previously, Pfeil failed to show he could have recovered even if the transfers had not occurred.Â  Accordingly, we hold the circuit court properly granted summary judgment to Wilson, Barman, the law firm, and Walker with respect to Pfeilâ€™s unfair trade practice, civil conspiracy, and intentional harm claims.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\n HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  The entity Steven Walker Homes Corporation and individuals Steven Berzansky and David Peery manage Steven Walker Homes, L.L.C.Â  \r\n[2]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]Â  Pfeil additionally argues the circuit court erred in finding Barman, Wilson, the law firm, and Berzansky did not aid or abet the alleged fraudulent conveyances.Â  Because we find Pfeil failed to show a fraudulent conveyance, we need not address this issue.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-360","title":"SCDOT v.

Quinn, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Jean Perrin Derrick, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Robert Mills Thomas (Father) appeals from a family court order requiring him to (1) pay for his nineteen-year-old daughterâ€™s car expenses, (2) repay one of her student loans, and (3) pay $800 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nFather and Patricia W. Harsey (Mother) were married on January 16, 1982, and separated on October 24, 1985.Â  Approximately four months after their separation, the coupleâ€™s only child, Ashley Nicole Thomas (Daughter), was born. With Fatherâ€™s consent, the family court gave Mother sole custody of Daughter and ordered Father to pay $240 in child support per month. Â The order is silent on the matter of college or educational expenses. \r\nShortly before Daughterâ€™s high school graduation, Father wrote a letter to Mother informing her he would cease paying child support in April of 2004, which was Daughterâ€™s last month of high school.Â  Father indicated in this letter that he would continue to send Daughter money until she graduated college, though he refused to contribute directly to the college expenses.[1] After receiving this letter, Mother filed an action in the family court, seeking continued support while Daughter attended college.Â  By the time this complaint was filed, Daughter had been accepted to Converse College beginning in the fall of 2004.Â  Because of her excellent academic record, Daughter received enough financial aid through scholarships and grants to be able to pay for her room and board.Â  However, Mother sought Fatherâ€™s help to pay for Daughterâ€™s additional expenses. \r\nAt trial, Mother requested $8,000-10,000 per year for Daughterâ€™s miscellaneous expenses, including the car Daughterâ€™s maternal grandfather gave her. The family court found that â€œbased on the facts of this case, it is necessary for Daughter to have an automobile to enable her to attend college.â€ Â Pursuant to that ruling, the family court ordered Father to pay $252.48 per month and Mother to pay $81.16 per month to cover the Daughterâ€™s car insurance, gas, and maintenance expenses.Â  The family court also ordered both parents to repay a $2,500 student loan Daughter had taken out, and it ordered Father to pay Mother $800 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen considering an appeal from the family court, appellate courts have the authority to find the facts in accordance with their view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006).Â  However, appellate courts defer to the family court judgeâ€™s determinations of witnessesâ€™ credibility because the family court judge had the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses testify.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Car Expenses \r\nFather concedes that pursuant to Risinger v. Risinger, 273 S.C. 36, 39, 253 S.E.2d 652, 653-54 (1979), a family court may order a parent to contribute to higher education expenses where there is evidence that: (1) the childâ€™s characteristics indicate he or she will benefit from college; (2) the child has the ability to make satisfactory grades; (3) the child would not otherwise be able to attend college; and (4) the parent is financially able to pay for college.Â  However, Father argues the family court erred in finding that a car is necessary to enable his emancipated daughter to attend college.Â  Father contends that because this finding is flawed, the subsequent finding that he should be required by court order to share in the expenses related to the car is flawed as well. \r\nAt the hearing, Father conceded he would support his daughter, and he even agreed to contribute $300 a month â€œas long as [Mother] is willing to under court order, too, to contribute . . . .â€ Â Because of Fatherâ€™s willingness to pay up to $300 in monthly child support, the issue of whether the family court erred in ordering him to pay a lesser amount is not preserved for appeal.Â  TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 617, 503 S.E.2d 471, 474 (1998) (â€œAn issue conceded in a lower court may not be argued on appeal.â€).Â  Therefore, we affirm the family courtâ€™s order requiring Father to pay $252.48 per month in child support.[2] \r\nII.&nbsp;Student Loan\r\nFather next argues that the family court erred in requiring him to re-pay Daughterâ€™s student loan when she graduates from college.Â  We agree.\r\nInitially, we note that neither Mother nor Father were a party to the loan Daughter took out.Â  According to the loan contract, Daughter received $2,500 for her tuition in exchange for her agreement to teach in a critical needs area for two years after graduation.Â  If Daughter opts not to teach in a critical needs district, she is obligated to repay the loan.Â  \r\nThis type of student loan serves an important public purpose. Because it forgives the debt of those recipients who teach in critical needs areas, the loan encourages young teachers to accept positions in school districts that might otherwise have a difficult time attracting teachers.Â  By ordering Mother and Father to repay Daughterâ€™s loan if it is not forgiven, the family court negated the incentive to teach in a critical needs area.Â  We find this was a violation of public policy.Â  See Almers v. South Carolina Nat. Bank of Charleston, 265 S.C. 48, 60, 217 S.E.2d 135, 141 (1975) (explaining that although there is no â€œfast rule or definition of public policy applicable to all cases,â€ public policy generally â€œforbids one to do that which has a tendency to be injurious to the public welfareâ€).Â  \r\nWe are aware that courts are usually reluctant to invoke public policy to void a contract because â€œthe right of private contract is no small part [of] the liberty of the citizen[, and] the usual and most important function of courts of justice is to maintain and enforce contracts.â€Â  Id., at 60, 217 S.E.2d at 141.Â  In this case, however, the parties did not engage in a voluntary contract; rather, the family court made Father liable on a contract he was not a party to.Â  Just as courts are wary to void a contract based on public policy, so too do we oppose relieving Daughter of the contractual obligation she voluntarily undertook, especially when to do so would itself be a violation of public policy.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the family courtâ€™s order requiring Father to repay Daughterâ€™s student loan.\r\nIII.&nbsp;Equal Protection Argument\r\nNext, Father argues that the family court erred in requiring divorced parents to contribute to the education of an emancipated child because it violates the equal protection clause.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for our review, as it was not raised until Fatherâ€™s Rule 59(e) Motion.Â  See Hickman v. Hickman, 301 S.C. 455, 456, 392 S.E.2d 482, 482 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œA party cannot use Rule 59(e) to present to the court an issue the party could have raised prior to judgment but did not.â€). \r\nIV.&nbsp;Attorneyâ€™s Fees \r\nFather also argues that if this court reverses the family court on appeal, the underlying award of attorneyâ€™s fees ought to be reversed as well. Â Arial v. Arial, 295 S.C. 286, 369 S.E.2d 146 (Ct. App. 1988). Â Because we are not reversing the trial court on all issues, and Mother is still receiving beneficial results from this action, we find no reason to overturn the trial court on the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  See Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 415, 368 S.E.2d 903 (1988) (â€œAn award of attorneysâ€™ fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.â€). Â Therefore, we affirm the family courtâ€™s decision regarding attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nV.&nbsp;Frivolous Proceedings \r\nFinally, Father argues the family court erred in regard to his claim under the Frivolous Proceedings Act.Â  The Act provides, in part, as follows: \r\n\r\n  Any person who takes part in the procurement, initiation, continuation, or defense of any civil proceeding is subject to being assessed for payment of all or a portion of the attorneyâ€™s fees and court costs of the other party if . . . the proceedings have terminated in favor of the person seeking an assessment of the fees and costs.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10 (Supp. 2005)\r\nHere, the proceedings did not terminate entirely in Fatherâ€™s favor.Â  Therefore, he is not entitled to any award under the Frivolous Proceedings Act.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the family courtâ€™s award of child support and attorneyâ€™s fees, but reverse the portion of its order requiring Father to repay Daughterâ€™s student loan.Â Â  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Father did cease sending child support in April; however, he continued to send Daughter $300 per month. Â \r\n[2] We express no opinion as to whether it was â€œnecessaryâ€ for Daughter to have a car to attend college.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-362","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Jay E. Hodge, Jr., of Cheraw, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Larry Smith appeals his convictions for second degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.Â  He argues the circuit court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 20, 2004, Victim[2] left her grandmotherâ€™s home without the knowledge or consent of her grandmother.Â  At approximately midnight, Victim, was picked up outside the home and driven to a residence on Lee State Park Road in Darlington County.Â  Accompanying Victim on this drive were the twenty-year-old driver, the driverâ€™s seventeen-year-old brother, and Victimâ€™s fourteen-year-old girl friend.Â  The driver dropped off the three passengers and returned to her home.Â  \r\nOnce at the residence, Victim and her friend joined a group of people, including Larry Smith, in the â€œpool house.â€[3]Â  Everyone then spent some time in the pool house listening to music, playing pool, and drinking alcoholic beverages.Â  At approximately 3 a.m., John Jordan agreed to drive Victim and her girl friend home.Â  Because of Jordanâ€™s young age, he was not legally permitted to drive without a licensed driver over the age of nineteen, thus Smith agreed to accompany him.Â  Jordan dropped off Victimâ€™s friend at her home, but for reasons which are in dispute, Victim was never dropped off at her grandmotherâ€™s home.[4]Â  Victim returned to the Lee State Park Road residence where she spent the night.Â  \r\nVictimâ€™s girl friend had telephoned Victimâ€™s grandmotherâ€™s home around 4 a.m. to make sure that Victim had made it home.Â  It was at this point that Victimâ€™s grandmother realized Victim was not there, and she called the police.Â  After speaking with Victimâ€™s friend, the police were able to locate Victim at the Lee State Park Road residence, and they returned her to her grandmotherâ€™s home.Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough Victim did not indicate to her family that she had been sexually assaulted, her aunt took her to the hospital for an examination, and a rape kit was taken.Â  Victimâ€™s exam produced evidence of non-consensual sex, and semen was found in her vagina.Â  At the hospital, the police were told by Victimâ€™s mother that Smith had sexually assaulted her daughter, and on March 22, 2004, Victim confirmed the assault in a conversation with a social worker.Â  Â Â \r\nA Darlington County grand jury indicted Smith on second degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.Â  At trial, the jury convicted Smith on all charges and the trial court sentenced him to a total of twelve years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&ldquo;When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.&rdquo; State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 593, 606 S.E.2d 475, 477-78 (2004). When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state. State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999). &ldquo;If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.&rdquo; Cherry, 361 S.C. at 593-94, 606 S.E.2d at 478. See State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002) (finding that on an appeal from trial court&rsquo;s denial of a motion for a directed verdict, appellate court may only reverse the trial court if there is no evidence to support the trial court&rsquo;s ruling). &ldquo;When considering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.&rdquo; Erickson v. Jones Street Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 463, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nSmith contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict.Â  Smith maintains that there was no credible evidence to support a finding that he was guilty.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â  Criminal Sexual Conduct\r\nSection 16-3-655(2) of the South Carolina Code (2003)[5] states: â€œA person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is fourteen years of age or less but who is at least eleven years of age.â€Â  Sexual battery, in pertinent part, is defined as â€œ[s]exual intercourse . . . or any intrusion, however slight, of any part of a personâ€™s body or of any object into the genital or anal openings of another personâ€™s body . . ..â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(h) (Supp. 2005).Â Â Â  \r\nIn this case, the State presented evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find Smith sexually assaulted Victim.Â  Victim testified that she was twelve years old at the time of the incident.Â  Victim further testified that Smith shoved her on the bed, removed his and her clothing, and inserted his penis into her vagina.Â  It is undisputed that the twelve-year-old Victim had sexual intercourse on the night in question, and DNA analysis, while failing to provide the typical level of certainty, did not exclude Smith.[6]Â  \r\nSmithâ€™s argument goes to the credibility of the Victim and the weight of the DNA evidence.Â  However, the credibility and weight of evidence are issues to be decided by the trier of fact.Â  Whether or not to believe testimony and how to weigh the evidence are tasks that fall squarely within the province of the jury.Â  We do not have the authority to disturb jury decisions in these areas.Â  Under our limited standard of review, we find there was evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s denial of Smithâ€™s directed verdict motion.Â  Therefore, we find no error by the trial court.\r\nB.Â  Contributing to the Delinquency of a Minor\r\nSection 16-17-490 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  It shall be unlawful for any person over eighteen years of age to knowingly and wilfully encourage, aid or cause or to do any act which shall cause or influence a minor: (1) To violate any law or any municipal ordinance; . . . Â (10) To so deport himself or herself as to wilfully injure or endanger his or her morals or health or the morals or health of others.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œAppellantâ€™s act of encouraging a minor to drink beer and smoke marijuana, conduct which is illegal, clearly endangers the morals, if not the health, of the minor.â€Â  State v. Michau, 355 S.C. 73, 77, 583 S.E.2d 756, 758-59 (2003).\r\nSmith testified that at the time of the April 2005 trial, he was thirty one years old, thus he was certainly over the age of eighteen at the time of the alleged incident.Â  Victimâ€™s fourteen-year-old friend testified that Smith handed her a beer for her and Victim to share.Â  Although Victim testified that it was not Smith who handed her friend the beer, the conflicting statements were properly submitted to the jury to weigh. Â Â Â \r\nBecause there is evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s denial of Smithâ€™s directed verdict motion, we find no error.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of the directed verdict motion.Â  Based on the foregoing, Smithâ€™s convictions are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, HUFF, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n[2] As used in this opinion, â€œVictimâ€ refers to the minor child who was the victim of criminal sexual conduct.Â  While Appellant maintains his innocence, both sides agree that the minor had sexual intercourse on the night in question.Â  Since this minor was twelve-years-old and could not legally consent to sexual intercourse, she is undoubtedly the victim of criminal sexual conduct.\r\n[3] The pool house is a structure located behind the Lee State Park Road residence.Â  This structure is a small building with a pool table.Â  \r\n[4] Jordan and Smith testified Victim refused to exit the vehicle when they brought her to her grandmotherâ€™s home because she saw that her grandmother was awake, and she did not want to be in trouble.Â  Victim testified that she was held in the vehicle and not permitted to leave.Â  \r\n[5] This statute was amended in 2005 and what was 16-3-655 (2) at the time of this conviction is now 16-3-655 (B).\r\n[6] Because only a partial DNA profile was attained, DNA analysis was limited and resulted in a 1 in 1,600 chance that the DNA was not that of Smith.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-363","title":"State v.

Justice, of Chester, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Dennis L. Snipes, Jr. appeals his conviction for criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree, contending the trial court erred in failing to find Snipesâ€™ right to a speedy trial was violated and in denying his motion for a directed verdict. We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn March of 2000, Snipes was living with his then girlfriend (Mother), her two children from a previous relationship, and Motherâ€™s youngest child, who was Snipeâ€™s son.Â  On the morning of March 18, 2001, Mother took the youngest child to get a haircut, leaving Snipes home alone with Motherâ€™s two older children. Â When Mother came home, her six year-old daughter (Victim) told Mother she had been sexually assaulted by Snipes.Â  Mother took all three children to her sisterâ€™s house at which time the police were contacted.Â  \r\nWhen the police arrived, they spoke to Victim and then proceeded to Snipesâ€™ home, where Victim had indicated the assault occurred.Â  Once at the home, they found Snipes, along with his mother and his father, at the residence.Â  Snipesâ€™ parents came to the house because Snipes had telephoned his mother and his parents knew he was upset. Â Having received a call regarding someone making a threat to themselves with a firearm, the officers expected there might be weapons present at the scene.Â  Officers observed Snipes sitting on the couch within reach of a loaded pistol.Â  \r\nSnipes told the officers that he had been watching a sexually explicit videotape when Victim walked in and observed on the tape a person in a car performing a lewd act.Â  Snipes stated to the officers that he told Victim if she ever stole from her mother again, â€œhe would make her do that to him.â€Â  As a result of a conversation they had with Mother and Victim, officers seized a red t-shirt, a white t-shirt, and a blue washcloth from the scene to be sent for DNA analysis.Â  \r\nLater, at the Sheriffâ€™s Office, Snipes gave a written statement in which he reiterated that he was watching an X-rated movie when Victim walked into the room.Â  According to Snipeâ€™s statement, Victim saw a woman performing oral sex on a man in a car.Â  When Victim said what the girl was doing was â€œnasty,â€ Snipes told Victim, if she stole from her mother again â€œI will do you like that.â€Â  \r\nSnipes was arrested on March 18, 2000.Â  Shortly thereafter, he posted bail and was out on bond.Â  The case was dismissed at a preliminary hearing in mid-May 2000.Â  On June 15, 2000, Snipes was directly indicted. Â Snipes was not arraigned until February 2002, at which time he was not jailed. Â Instead the State consented to Snipes remaining free on bond.Â  On July 30, 2002, a hearing was held on the Stateâ€™s motion to require Snipes to submit to a blood test.Â  Snipes was ultimately brought to trial on August 3, 2004.Â  \r\nOn the day of trial, Snipes moved to dismiss the charge based on the more than four-year delay in bringing the case to trial.Â  Defense counsel argued Snipes was prejudiced by the delay inasmuch as one possible defense witness, Dr. James Foutty, was no longer employed with the local hospital. Â Defense counsel admitted he had not attempted to locate the doctor by contacting the state medical board.Â  Additionally, the State maintained the testimony Snipes sought to elicit from the doctor was not contested.[2]Â  Snipes further argued he was prejudiced by the delay because the event had occurred over four years ago, Victim was six years old at that time of the event and eleven years old at the time of trial, and her memory was therefore not reliable. Â Snipes conceded he had not made a speedy trial motion prior to the day of trial and had not brought his desire to bring the case to trial to the courtâ€™s attention prior to that day.Â  After hearing the solicitorâ€™s explanation for the delay, the trial court noted it was concerned with the delay, and the ages of the cases in general in that county.Â  However, the court found â€œit [did not] reach the point . . . where [the court would] grant [the] motion to dismiss,â€ finding Snipes failed to show enough prejudice in the delay of the case to warrant dismissal.Â  \r\nVictim testified at trial that on the morning of the incident, Mother took her brother to get a haircut, leaving her at home with her other brother and Snipes.Â  She and her brother were folding clothes in the living room when Snipes called her into his bedroom, where Snipes was sitting on the bed.Â  Snipes told Victim to shut the door and to take off her clothes, or she would be in trouble or get spanked.Â  Victim removed her clothes, at which point Snipes pulled down his own pants and told her to â€œsuck his private part or [she] would get spanked.â€Â  Victim did as she was told.Â  As she was performing the act on Snipes, he rubbed Victimâ€™s back.Â  It ended when Victim simply stopped.Â  She did not see â€œanything come out of his private part at anytime.â€Â  Victim rolled over on her back, and Snipes instructed her to close her eyes and turn her head.Â  Snipes went into the bathroom, came out with a rag with something on it, and rubbed the rag on her stomach.Â  When he placed the rag on her, she felt a watery sensation.Â  She then opened her eyes, got up, and put on her clothes.Â  Snipes told Victim not to tell anyone what happened or she would get in trouble and be spanked.Â  When Mother came home, she asked Victim what was wrong, and Victim told her what had happened.Â  The State presented testimony from two police officers, a victimsâ€™ assistance coordinator, a childrenâ€™s advocacy coordinator, and from Mother confirming that Victim reported she had been sexually assaulted on the day in question at her home.Â  \r\nAlthough a stain was found on the red t-shirt belonging to Victim, no semen was detected on that, nor on the other t-shirt or the washcloth seized from the home.Â  Neither was semen found on Victim.Â  \r\nSnipes took the stand in his defense.Â  He testified that on March 18, 2000, Mother left the house to take their son to get a haircut.Â  After the other children finished folding clothes, he instructed them to clean their rooms.Â  Snipes began watching a sexually explicit tape.Â  He did not believe the children would see the tape because they were not allowed out of their rooms until the rooms were clean.Â  Victim walked in while a scene was playing which showed a woman performing oral sex on a man in a car.Â  Victim stated, â€œOh Daddy, thatâ€™s nasty.â€Â  This startled Snipes, and he responded by screaming at her and telling her if she ever stole money from her mother again, â€œIâ€™ll do you like that.â€Â  Snipes denied he had ever â€œdone anything of a sexual natureâ€ to Victim.Â  \r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s evidence, Snipes moved for a directed verdict arguing the State failed to present evidence of the crime of criminal sexual conduct.Â  The trial court denied the motion, finding there was evidence presented from which the jury could find Snipes guilty.Â  At the close of all evidence, Snipes renewed his motion for directed verdict asserting the State failed to present sufficient evidence of his guilt.Â  The court again denied the motion.Â  Thereafter, the jury found Snipes guilty of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree, and Snipes was sentenced to ten years in prison.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Right to a Speedy Trial \r\nSnipes contends the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the case on the ground that his right to a speedy trial was violated.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, and Article 1, Section 14 of the South Carolina Constitution guarantee an accused the right to a speedy trial.Â  State v. Kennedy, 339 S.C. 243, 249, 528 S.E.2d 700, 703 (Ct. App. 2000), affâ€™d 348 S.C. 32, 558 S.E.2d 527 (2002);Â  State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 74, 480 S.E.2d 64, 70 (1997);Â  State v. Chapman, 289 S.C. 42, 44, 344 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1986).Â  The determination of whether or not an accused has been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial depends on the circumstances of each case. Â Brazell, 325 S.C. at 75, 480 S.E.2d at 70;Â  State v. Monroe, 262 S.C. 346, 349, 204 S.E.2d 433, 435 (1974).Â  In Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), the United States Supreme Court identified four factors to be used in determining whether a defendant has been denied the right to a speedy trial:Â  1) the length of the delay;Â  2) the reason the State asserts to justify the delay;Â  3) when and how the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial;Â  and 4) the prejudice to the defendant. Â Id. at 530;Â  see also Brazell, 325 S.C. at 75, 480 S.E.2d at 70.Â Â  The Supreme Court noted the courts must engage in a balancing test with these â€œrelated factors,â€ which â€œmust be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.â€Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 533. Â South Carolina has recognized these factors and adopted this balancing approach to the speedy trial analysis. Â Brazell, 325 S.C. at 75, 480 S.E.2d at 70; Â Chapman, 289 S.C. at 44, 344 S.E.2d at 612.\r\nThe first factor, length of delay, acts as a threshold requirement.Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 530.Â  Â Until there is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, it is not necessary to inquire into the other factors.Â  Id.Â  In determining when a defendantâ€™s right to a speedy trial begins to run, we must consider the purpose of the speedy trial guarantee.Â  Chapman, 289 S.C. at 44, 344 S.E.2d at 612.Â  \r\n\r\n  The Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is thus not primarily intended to prevent prejudice to the defense caused by passage of time;Â  that interest is protected primarily by the due process clause and by statutes of limitations.Â  The speedy trial guarantee is designed to minimize the possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but never the less substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges.Â  \r\n  Once charges are dismissed, the speedy trial guarantee is no longer applicable.Â  At that point, the formerly accused is, at most, in the same position as any other subject of a criminal investigation.\r\n\r\nId. at 44-45, 344 S.E.2d at 612-13 (quoting United States v. McDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1982)).Â  Thus, the time during which an indictment is dismissed and a defendant is free of all restrictions on his liberty should be excluded from the length of delay.Â  Id. at 45, 344 S.E.2d at 613.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the case at hand, it appears Snipes was not incarcerated on this charge but for a few days. However, his liberty was clearly impaired and his life disrupted during the considerable period of time he was out on bond.Â  Snipes was arrested mid-March of 2000. While the charges were dismissed two months later, he was then indicted on June 15, 2000, only one month later, and the charge remained hanging over his head until the time of trial in early August 2004.Â  Accordingly, the length of delay in this matter is four years and three and a half months. Â Although delay alone is not dispositive in the speedy trial analysis, this substantial delay by the State in prosecuting the case is sufficient to trigger review of the remaining factors. Â See State v. Robinson, 335 S.C. 620, 625, 518 S.E.2d 269, 272 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding five-year delay between arrest and trial of defendant for computer crime was sufficient to trigger review of remaining factors to be considered in determining whether defendant was denied his right to speedy trial);Â  Brazell, 325 S.C. at 75, 480 S.E.2d at 70 (finding a three-year and five-month delay was sufficient to trigger review); Â State v. Waites, 270 S.C. 104, 108, 240 S.E.2d 651, 653 (1978) (finding a two-year and four-month delay in prosecution was sufficient to trigger speedy trial analysis).\r\nAs for the second factor of the Barker test, reason for delay, the State admitted that there were many reasons for the delay that were not going to be acceptable to the court.Â  The solicitor stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  . . . One is we have cases that are older than this that we havenâ€™t gotten to yet.Â  We donâ€™t have enough court time to move cases in a timely fashion and thatâ€™s not a good excuse.Â  Another is that we discovered that we had in fact seized some physical items.Â  In my preparation of this case months and months â€“ actually a couple of years ago I determined that we had basically sat on those items at the sheriffâ€™s office, nothing had been done with them.Â  In fairness to everybody we felt like we needed to send them to SLED to see what they could do with it.Â  We did that - - a sample was listed by SLEDâ€™s DNA processing department from one article of clothing.Â  We now had something maybe to be compared with the blood samples from the victim and the defendant.Â  I then tried to get [the defense attorney] to see if his client would consent to the submission of his blood sample, he wouldnâ€™t.Â  We had to go through the process of a motion and doctors appointments to get all of that done.Â  So all of it is not our fault.Â  We finally got the blood sample, we sent it to SLED, the reports came back and then I scheduled it for trial.Â  \r\n\r\nThus, it appears the delay was due in part to an overcrowded docket and the Stateâ€™s failure to promptly have some of the evidence tested.Â  However, the record shows the solicitor took steps to have the items tested once he became aware of their existence.Â  Further, it should be noted that Snipes also contributed to the delay. Â In June 2002, after discovering further testing was needed on the red t-shirt seized by the officers, the solicitor filed a motion requesting Snipes submit to a blood test in order to speed up the process of testing.Â  Snipes opposed the motion, necessitating a hearing on July 30, 2002.Â  While Snipes was well within his rights to challenge his submission to a blood test, he cannot now claim this additional delay was attributable to the State.Â Â Â  Finally, there is simply no evidence the State purposely delayed Snipesâ€™ trial.Â  See Kennedy, 339 S.C. at 250, 528 S.E.2d at 704 (noting absence of evidence of purposeful delay by State in considering reason for delay factor in speedy trial analysis);Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531 (finding deliberate attempt to delay a trial in order to hamper the defense should be weighted heavily against the government while a more neutral reason such as negligence or overcrowded docket should be weighted less heavily). \r\nNext, we must consider when and how Snipes asserted his right to a speedy trial.Â  The record shows Snipes did not make a motion concerning the delay until the day of trial.Â  While Snipes contends he complained of the delay during the July 30, 2002 hearing, a thorough reading of the record shows Snipes never placed any objection on the record in regard to the delay prior to the day of trial.Â  Rather, as previously noted, the transcript from that hearing shows the solicitor was very concerned with the delay in bringing the matter to trial and that this prompted his motion for Snipes to submit to the blood test.Â  Snipes objected at the hearing only to the intrusion of a blood test based on the solicitorâ€™s admission the seized items had been â€œcoming back [with] negative [results].â€Â  Snipes maintained that, â€œsince itâ€™s been that long,â€ to send a blood sample in with the other items â€œcreates a possibility of suspicion as to how the analysis was conducted.â€Â  Further, Snipes conceded during his motion to dismiss based on his speedy trial violation that he had not brought the matter to the courtâ€™s attention and had not made a motion for speedy trial or to dismiss until the day of trial.Â  Accordingly, Snipes failed to assert this right until the trial was ready to start.Â  See also Robinson, 335 S.C. at 626, 518 S.E.2d at 272 (finding appellantâ€™s letters written to solicitor and Chief Administrative Judge indicating he was ready for trial were insufficient to trigger assertion of appellantâ€™s right to a speedy trial and such right was not asserted until he filed his formal motion to dismiss).Â  \r\nWhile the United States Supreme Court rejected the demand-waiver rule[3] as applied to the right to a speedy trial in Barker, the manner in which the defendant asserts his right thereto is nonetheless an important factor to be considered.Â  Waites, 270 S.C. at 108, 240 S.E.2d at 653.Â  In Barker, the court considered the fact that Barker did not want a speedy trial to be â€˜[m]ore important than the absence of serious prejudice.â€Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 534. The court noted, the more serious the deprivation, the more likely the defendant is to complain, and a defendantâ€™s assertion of his speedy trial right is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether he has been deprived of the right.Â  Id. at 531-32.Â  The court added, â€œ[w]e emphasize that failure to assert the right will make it difficult for a defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy trial.â€Â  Id. at 532. Â Accordingly, Snipesâ€™ failure to assert his right to a speedy trial until the day the trial began militates strongly against him in his argument that he was denied his right to a speedy trial.Â  \r\nLastly, we must examine whether Snipes suffered prejudice as a result of the delay.Â  In considering this factor, the Barker court noted it should be assessed in light of the interests of defendants the speedy trial right was designed to protect.Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 532.Â  These interests include: (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.Â  Id. Â Of these, the most serious is the impairment of the defense, because the inability of a defendant to adequately prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system. Â Id.;Â  see also Kennedy, 339 S.C. at 250, 528 S.E.2d at 704 (quoting Barker).Â  Â \r\nOn appeal, Snipes asserts he was prejudiced by the delay because the evidence showed Victimâ€™s memory was faulty, the only evidence against him was that of Victimâ€™s testimony, and her credibility was bolstered by the five witnesses who corroborated her allegation of sexual abuse.[4]Â  The court in Barker noted there is prejudice if defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately events of the distant past.Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 532. Â However, Snipes does not contend he or any of his other witnesses were unable to recall the events surrounding this case. Â Rather, he claims prejudice in Victimâ€™s inability to remember the events.Â  Further, the Barker court also noted that deprivation of the right to a speedy trial may sometimes work to an accusedâ€™s advantage.Â  Id. at 521.Â  Specifically, the court discussed how, as the delay between commission of a crime and the trial increases, witnesses may become unavailable and memories may fade.Â  However, where the witnesses support the prosecution, it is the prosecutionâ€™s case that will be weakened, sometimes seriously so, as it is the prosecution that carries the burden of proof.Â  Id.Â  This is precisely what occurred in the case at hand.Â  The fact that Victim had some difficulty remembering what happened on the day in question was well explored by defense counsel, and used to Snipesâ€™ advantage in attacking Victimâ€™s credibility.Â  Thus, considering the fact that Snipes was able to attack Victimâ€™s credibility, showing little, if any, impairment to his defense, along with the fact that Snipes was incarcerated very briefly prior to his trial, we conclude there was minimal prejudice to Snipes.Â  \r\nAlthough the delay of over four years is substantial, upon our review and balancing of the Barker factors, we find Snipes was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial and the trial court properly denied Snipesâ€™ motion to dismiss. \r\nII.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nSnipes argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  He argues Victimâ€™s testimony was based on her review of papers and talking to others rather than her personal knowledge, and therefore there was no competent evidence reasonably tending to prove his guilt.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen a motion for a directed verdict is made in a criminal case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not with the weight of the evidence.Â  State v. Brown, 360 S.C. 581, 586, 602 S.E.2d 392, 395 (2004).Â  The accused is entitled to a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a suspicion of guilt or when the State fails to present evidence on a material element of the offense charged.Â  Id.Â  However, if there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find that the trial court properly submitted the case to the jury.Â  State v. McGowan, 347 S.C. 618, 622, 557 S.E.2d 657, 659 (2001).Â  In reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266, 270, 531 S.E.2d 512, 514 (2000).Â Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we find there was sufficient evidence presented that reasonably tended to prove Snipesâ€™ guilt.Â  Victim testified in detail about Snipesâ€™ sexual assault on her on the day in question.Â  While Victim did state she had difficulty remembering some things that occurred and she had to refresh her memory through papers and talking with other people before these matters would â€œcome back to [her],â€ she maintained that what she had testified to at trial was what had in fact happened.Â  Additionally, her testimony was corroborated by the testimony of the two investigating officers, a victimsâ€™ assistance coordinator, and a childrenâ€™s advocacy coordinator, as well as her mother, who all testified that Victim complained that she was sexually assaulted in her home on the date alleged.Â  Finally, the fact that Snipes asserts Victimâ€™s testimony should not be believed is not a basis for a directed verdict.Â  Instead, Snipesâ€™ argument is one of credibility, which is to be resolved by the jury.Â  See State v. Ham, 268 S.C. 340, 341, 233 S.E.2d 698, 698 (1977) (â€œWhere the determination of guilt is dependant upon the credibility of the witnesses, a motion for a directed verdict is properly refused.â€)Â Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly denied Snipesâ€™ motion for a directed verdict.Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons Snipesâ€™ conviction is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, HUFF, JJ. and CURETON, A.J., concur\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] On appeal, Snipes only argues the reliability of Victimâ€™s testimony was diminished by the delay.Â  He does not assert any prejudice based on Dr. Fouttyâ€™s inaccessibility.Â  \r\n[3] The demand-waiver doctrine, as discussed by the court in Barker, provides that a defendant would waive any consideration of his right to a speedy trial for any period prior to his demand of a trial, thus requiring prior demand as a necessary condition to consideration of the speedy trial right.Â  Barker, 407 U.S. at 525.Â Â  \r\n[4] It should be noted that Snipes did not object to the corroboration evidence offered by the State at trial.Â  Additionally, the testimony was limited to time and place of the assault, excluding any detail of the incident.Â  See Simpkins v. State, 303 S.C. 364, 367, 401 S.E.2d 142, 143 (1991) (holding, when criminal sexual conduct victim testifies, corroborative evidence from other witnesses that victim complained of sexual assault is admissible, limited to time and place of the assault and excluding details or particulars).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-364","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, of Columbia, Druanne Dykes White, of Anderson, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh , Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Christina Theos Adams, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Leroy Matthews claims the trial court erred in finding the State did not commit a Rule 5 discovery violation, finding no Miranda violation, finding the search of the house was voluntary, admitting the actual drug laboratory report, and admitting evidence of Matthewsâ€™s exercise of his right to remain silent.Â  We affirm[1].\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the morning of January 18, 2005, Deputy Andrew Hyslop witnessed Matthews backing down a street at a high rate of speed.Â  Deputy Hyslop believed Matthews was backing in a dangerous manner and decided to pull him over to give him a verbal warning.Â  In the meantime, Matthews parked his car in a private parking lot.Â  Matthews exited his vehicle as Deputy Hyslop was parking next to him.\r\nDeputy Hyslop asked Matthews for his driverâ€™s license.Â  Matthews responded by running into a nearby home and locked the door.Â  Shortly thereafter, Matthews came out through the front door.Â  Deputy Hyslop approached Matthews and asked to see his driving license.Â  Matthews became loud and boisterous with Deputy Hyslop and used profanities while speaking with him.Â  The commotion attracted a small crowd of bystanders, and at least one bystander joined Matthews in yelling obscenities at Deputy Hyslop.Â  In response to the situation, Deputy Hyslop arrested Matthews for public disorderly conduct.Â  Matthews flailed his arms and attempted to get away while Deputy Hyslop was trying to handcuff him.Â  Deputy Hyslop, with the help of a second deputy, was able to handcuff Matthews.Â  Deputy Hyslop seized $890.00 in cash and a set of keys from Matthews.\r\nDeputy Hyslop placed Matthews in his patrol car and informed him of his Miranda rights.Â  Matthews told Deputy Hyslop to get out of his face.Â  Deputy Hyslop closed the door and walked away from the patrol car.Â  A few moments later, Deputy Hyslop went back to the car and asked Matthews if he had placed anything in the house.Â  However, Matthews did not want to talk with Deputy Hyslop. Â Deputy Hyslop closed the door and again walked away from the patrol car.Â  Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Hamby arrived on the scene.Â  \r\nWhen Matthews saw Sergeant Hamby, he called him over to the patrol car. Â Matthews complained to Sergeant Hamby about being harassed by the officers on the scene. Â Sergeant Hamby asked Matthews if he had left anything in the house when he was inside.Â  Matthews said he had and offered to take Sergeant Hamby in the house and show it to him.Â  Matthews took Sergeant Hamby into the house and pointed out a hole in one of the walls which contained a plastic bag with a rock substance in it.Â  The substance was later tested and found to be crack cocaine.Â  Pursuant to an inventory search, $2,000.00 cash and an electric scale with crack cocaine residue was seized from Matthewsâ€™ car.\r\nOn April 19, 2005, Matthews was indicted for resisting arrest, public disorderly conduct, trafficking cocaine, trafficking cocaine within one-half mile of a school, and improper backing.Â  The trial court dismissed the trafficking cocaine within one-half mile of a school charge.Â  On April 18, 2005, a jury found Matthews guilty of all the remaining charged crimes.Â  Matthews was sentenced to twenty-five years for trafficking with the sentences for the other crimes running concurrent to the sentence for trafficking.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe conduct of a criminal trial and the inclusion or exclusion of evidence are matters left largely to the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Lee, 255 S.C. 309, 178 S.E.2d 652 (1971); State v. Edens, 272 S.C. 130, 250 S.E.2d 116 (1978). The decisions of the trial judge will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Quillien, 263 S.C. 87, 207 S.E.2d 814 (1974).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRule 5 Discovery Violation\r\nMatthews claims the trial court should have suppressed his statements due to a violation of a discovery request made pursuant to Rule 5, SCRCrimP.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 5(a)(1)(A), SCRCrimP, provides in pertinent parts upon â€œrequest by a defendant, the prosecution shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photographâ€¦ any oral statement which the prosecution intends to offer in evidence at trial made by the defendantâ€¦ in response to interrogationâ€¦â€ .\r\nDeputy Hyslop informed Matthewsâ€™ of his rights pursuant to Miranda. Deputy Hyslop then asked Matthews if he understood those rights and with those rights in mind if he would like to speak with him.Â  In reply, Matthews told Deputy Hyslop to get out of his face.Â  Matthewsâ€™ attorney claimed the State should have disclosed Matthewsâ€™ statement.\r\nMatthewsâ€™s statement was made in response to Deputy Hyslopâ€™s question about his Miranda rights.Â  The statement was not made in response to interrogation and it was not responsive to the question.Â  Deputy Hyslop was simply trying to comply with the requirements of Miranda.Â  The question did not rise to the level of interrogation; therefore, Matthewsâ€™ statement was not subject to discovery.\r\nMatthews claims the Stateâ€™s failure to disclose his statement, the fact that he was Mirandized, and the card Deputy Hyslop read the Miranda rights from were detrimental to his defense.Â  The original defense strategy was to move to have all of the evidence excluded. Â Â Matthews claims his attorney had insufficient time to revamp his defense after the State presented evidence at the motion hearing showing he was Mirandized. Â However, his attorney did not request a continuance when the State presented the evidence showing he had been Mirandized. Â Therefore, Matthews can not show that he was prejudiced by the alleged Rule 5 violation.\r\nMiranda Violation\r\nMatthews claims the trial court should have suppressed his statements due to a Miranda violation.Â  We disagree.\r\nDeputy Hyslop informed Matthews of his rights pursuant to Miranda.Â  He then asked Matthews if he understood those rights and with those rights in mind if he would like to speak with him.Â  In reply Matthews told him to get out of his face, at which point Deputy Hyslop closed the door to his patrol car and walked away.\r\nA moment later he returned to the car and asked Matthews if he had left anything in the house when he went inside.Â  Deputy Hyslop testified that Matthews did not want to talk and continued to curse.Â  Deputy Hyslop closed the door and walked away.Â  When Sergeant Hamby arrived on the scene, Matthews called him over to the car.Â  Matthews complained to Sergeant Hamby about being harassed by the officers at the scene.Â  Sergeant Hamby asked him if had left anything in the house, and he admitted he had and offered to take Sergeant Hamby inside and show it to him.Â  When the two men went into the house, Matthews pointed out where he had left the crack.\r\nA statement obtained as a result of custodial interrogation is inadmissible unless the suspect was advised of and voluntarily waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona 384 U.S. 436 (1966). Â The voluntariness of a statement is determined from the totality of the circumstances. Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218 (1973). Furthermore, the conclusion of the trial judge on issues of fact as to the voluntariness of a statement will not be disturbed on appeal unless so manifestly erroneous as to show an abuse of discretion. State v. Kennedy, 333 S.C. 426, 429, 510 S.E.2d 714, 715 (1998).\r\n  When a suspect invokes his right to remain silent, law enforcement officers must scrupulously honor it. Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96 (1975). However, before law enforcement officers are required to discontinue questioning, the suspect must clearly articulate his desire to end the interrogation. Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452 (1994); State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 42, 503 S.E.2d 747, 750 (1998).\r\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, Matthews statement to Deputy Hyslop falls short of a clear invocation of his right to remain silent.Â  Matthews had been hostile with Deputy Hyslop since their interaction began, and stating â€œget out of my faceâ€ could have simply been a vocalization of his continuing hostility towards the Deputy.Â  This is strengthened by the fact that as soon as Sergeant Hamby arrived on the scene, Matthews initiated a conversation with him about the way he had been treated.Â  Even if Matthews statement was held to be an invocation of his right to remain silent, he chose to reinitiate the conversation by calling Sergeant Hamby over to the car and talking to him.Â  The admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under Miranda on whether his â€œright to cut off questioningâ€ was â€œscrupulously honored.â€Â  Michigan v. Mosley&nbsp; 423 U.S. 96,104 (1975).Â  Officers do not fail to â€œscrupulously honorâ€ an invocation of rights when they engage in conversation initiated by the suspect.Â  See State v. Aleksey&nbsp; 343 S.C. 20, 31, 538 S.E.2d 248, 254&nbsp;(2000).\r\nSearch of the House\r\nMatthews claims the trial court should have suppressed evidence found in the search of the house due to his consent not being voluntary.Â  Because we find Matthews failed to preserve this issue for appellate review, we do not reach the merits of this claim.Â  A ruling on a motion in limine is not sufficient to preserve a challenge on the validity of a search where trial council does not renew the objection when the drugs are introduced.Â  See State v. King 349 S.C. 142, 149, 561 S.E.2d 640, 643 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nMatthewsâ€™s attorney did not object when the state introduced the drugs that were found in the search.Â  During the motion hearing, the trial court instructed Matthewsâ€™s attorney to object when evidence was initially offered to preserve the record for review.Â  When the State offered the drugs for admission Matthewsâ€™ attorney failed to object.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.\r\nThe Laboratory Report\r\nMathews claims the laboratory report should have been excluded as hearsay.Â  We find the evidence admitted through the alleged error to be cumulative and therefore not prejudicial.Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (improper admission of hearsay evidence is reversible error only when the admission causes prejudice). Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to unsubstantial errors not affecting the result. State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1991).Â  State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 577 S.E.2d 445 (2003) (admission of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence.)\r\nMatthewsâ€™ attorney stipulated to the chain of custody for Stateâ€™s exhibit 12.Â  Matthewsâ€™ attorney also stipulated to Mr. Miller being qualified as a forensic drug analyst.Â  Mr. Miller testified, without objection, that his lab had determined Stateâ€™s exhibit 12 to be 23.38 grams of crack cocaine.Â  The lab report at issue was simply a written report stating what was already in the record: Stateâ€™s exhibit 12 was 23.38 grams of crack cocaine.Â  State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993) (any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence is harmless).\r\nRight to Remain Silent\r\nMatthews claims the trial court erred in admitting evidence showing he exercised his right to remain silent.Â  Because we find Matthews failed to preserve this issue for appellate review, we do not reach the merits of this claim.Â  An issue which is not properly preserved cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. Â State v. Vanderbilt, 287 S.C. 597, 340 S.E.2d 543 (1986). A contemporaneous objection is required to properly preserve an error for appellate review. Â State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).\r\nMatthewsâ€™ attorney failed to object to either Deputy Hyslopâ€™s testimony or the Stateâ€™s comments during closing arguments.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-365","title":"Wilson v.

[1]\r\nAlbert Judge died on July 19, 2000.Â  Desiree Pryor, the named beneficiary under a policy with Primerica Life Insurance, applied for the death benefit proceeds.Â  Primerica denied Pryorâ€™s claim and commenced an action in the Court of Common Pleas in Berkeley County to rescind the policy. Pryor counterclaimed on various tort and contract grounds. Â The trial court granted summary judgment to Pryor on one ground but otherwise granted summary judgment to Primerica Life.\r\nWhile the summary judgment motions were pending in Pryorâ€™s action in Berkeley County, Beth Wilson, the personal representative of Albert Judgeâ€™s estate (and also Judgeâ€™s sister, the mother of Desiree Pryor, and the contingent beneficiary on the policy), brought this action in Charleston County.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to Primerica on all causes, and Wilson appeals.Â  \r\nWe affirm based on the doctrine of res judicata.Â  To establish res judicata, the following elements must be established: (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the claim in the former suit.Â  Plum Creek Dev. Co., Inc. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999). Here, the subject matter is absolutely identical and all relevant issues were adjudicated in the prior suit.Â  As the trial court correctly stated, â€œ[b]oth cases concern the same policy of insurance [and] nearly identical causes of action.â€Â  While Wilson contends the parties are not identical, as neither she nor Stephanie Graham were parties in the Berkeley County action, this argument fails because, under South Carolina law, the doctrine of res judicata extends to include privy parties.Â  Nunnery v. Brantley Constr. Co., Inc., 289 S.C. 205, 209, 345 S.E.2d 740, 743 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  In the context of res judicata, the term privity does not refer to â€œrelationships between persons or entities, but rather it deals with a personâ€™s relationship to the subject matter of the litigation.â€Â  Richburg v. Baughman, 290 S.C. 431, 434, 351 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1986).Â  â€œThe term can also refer to a person so identified in interest with another that he represents the same legal rights.â€Â  Wyndham v. Lewis, 292 S.C. 6, 8, 354 S.E.2d 578, 579 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  This action was properly dismissed pursuant to the doctrine of res judicata.\r\nIn view of our disposition of this issue, we need not address the remaining issues. Rule 220(c), SCACR; See also Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993).Â  Therefore, the judgment of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-366","title":"Miles v.

Lockhart, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation action, Donald E. Miles appeals a circuit court order affirming the decision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel) finding his neck and back injuries did not arise during the course of Â his employment.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nDonald Miles is a 57-year-old man who resides in McBee, South Carolina.Â  Miles worked as a professional truck driver for eighteen years, the last four of which he drove for Merit Distribution Services, Inc. (Merit).Â  On March 26, 2000, Miles finished making a delivery in Barnwell, South Carolina and was driving to Georgia to make a second delivery when he drove his tractor-trailer over railroad tracks.Â  As Milesâ€™ tractor-trailer crossed over the tracks, a train struck the trailer.Â  The back end of the trailer tore off and the mechanism for the driverâ€™s seat broke.Â  While Miles was jostled around the cab by the collision he did not believe he was seriously injured and did not seek any medical treatment at the scene of the accident.Â  \r\nThe next day, Miles spoke with Meritâ€™s Safety Manager, Frank Richardson.Â  Miles claims that when he informed Richardson he was experiencing neck and back pain Richardson told him that if he filed a claim for workersâ€™ compensation he would lose his $1,200 safety bonus.Â  Miles did not believe his injuries to be severe and decided against telling anyone he was injured in the accident.Â  Â Â \r\nOn May 1, 2000, Miles went to see his general physician, Dr. Thomas Bell, because he had pain in his neck and shoulders, and his neck was â€œpopping.â€Â  Dr. Bell had seen Miles on March 14, twelve days before the accident, for neck pain and numbness in his fingers.Â  During the May 1 visit, Dr. Bell noticed Milesâ€™ symptoms had become acute and ordered an MRI.Â  The MRI revealed a herniated disk.Â  At this point, Miles did not disclose to Dr. Bell that he had been involved in an accident.Â  Further, Miles sought medical treatment under his health insurance rather than filing a workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  \r\nAs Milesâ€™ neck and back pain progressed, Dr. Bell referred him to Dr. Willie Edwards.Â  On May 25, 2000, Dr. Edwards examined Miles and noted in his report that Miles â€œdates the onset and duration of symptoms over the past six months.Â  He denies any history of injury or antecedent event and reports no precipitating factors or other known triggers.â€Â  Dr. Edwards recommended fusion surgery.Â  After the surgery, Miles still continued to experience stiffness and pain in his neck and finally divulged to Dr. Bell and Dr. Edwards that he had been involved in an accident.Â  \r\nOn July 24, 2000, Miles filed for short-term disability benefits.Â  The application requested that Miles respond to the following question:Â  â€œIf due to an accident, give date of accident.â€Â  Miles left the space blank.Â  On January 5, 2001, Miles filed for long-term disability benefits.Â  The application asked â€œ[w]here and how did the injury occur.â€Â  Milesâ€™ written response stated â€œ[u]known as to my knowledge.â€Â  Further, the application asked â€œis your condition related to your occupation?â€Â  Miles checked the â€œNoâ€ box on the application.Â  \r\nOn July 2, 2003, Miles filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim against Merit asserting he suffered a compensable injury during his employment on March 26, 2000.Â  At the hearing on June 25, 2004, Miles sought temporary-total disability benefits alleging the accident caused his injuries.Â  Although Merit admitted that an accident occurred on March 26, 2000, Merit denied Miles suffered any injury in the accident.Â  Merit took the position that any neck and back pain Miles experienced was unrelated to the accident.Â  Â Â \r\nThe Single Commissioner found that Miles testified that he did not initially pursue a workersâ€™ compensation claim because he feared for his job and did not want to lose his safety bonus.Â  Further, the Single Commissioner found Miles specifically denied, both to his doctors and in his applications for disability benefits, that his injury was caused by any antecedent event.Â  The Single Commissioner concluded that Milesâ€™ repeated denial of a work-related neck and back injury prevented a finding that Miles sustained a compensable injury on March 26, 2000.Â  The Single Commissioner found Miles did not carry the burden of proof required to establish his injury arose out of and occurred during the course of his employment.Â  Accordingly, the Single Commissioner denied Milesâ€™ claim for temporary-total disability benefits.Â Â  \r\nThe Full Commission affirmed the Single Commissioner, adopting the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings in full.Â  Following a hearing on the matter, the circuit court found the decision of the Appellate Panel was supported by substantial evidence in the record and affirmed that decision.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard of review for decisions by the Appellate Panel.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  This court may reverse or modify a decision of the Appellate Panel if the findings or conclusions are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  Under the scope of review established by the APA, this court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000). \r\nThe substantial evidence rule of the APA governs the standard of review in a workersâ€™ compensation decision. Lark, 276 S.C. at 134, 276 S.E.2d at 306.Â  A finding is supported by substantial evidence â€œunless there is no reasonable probability that the facts could be as related by a witness upon whose testimony the finding was based.â€Â  Id. at 136, 276 S.E.2d at 307.Â Â  Substantial evidence is that which, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion as the Appellate Panel.Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 183, 528 S.E.2d 435, 440 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted).\r\nIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact-finder and is not bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442. Â The final determination of witness credibility and weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.Â  Id.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc.,Â  336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d 102 (1999).Â Â Â Â  \r\nGenerally, whether an injury arose out of and was in the scope of employment is a question of fact.Â  Id. at 159, 519 S.E.2d at 105 (citation omitted).Â  Because causation is a question of fact, the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision on the issue will be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence in the record. Id. at 160, 519 S.E.2d at 105.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Miles asserts the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision because it was unsupported by substantial evidence and affected by legal error. He contends the Appellate Panel erroneously denied his claim for benefits due to his initial dishonesty in denying he was injured in the accident.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is undisputed that Miles had an accident in the course of his employment.Â  Therefore, the issue in this case involves a determination of whether Milesâ€™ subsequent neck and back pain, for which he sought treatment under his health insurance, arose out of his employment.Â  For the reasons set forth below we find substantial evidence supports the finding that Milesâ€™ neck and back pain were not caused by the work-related accident and, therefore, did not arise out of and in the course of his employment.Â Â Â  \r\nIn order for an injury to be compensable under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, the injury must â€œarise out of and in the course of the employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (1976).Â  â€œThe phrase â€˜arise out ofâ€™ refers to the injuryâ€™s origin and cause.â€Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 186, 528 S.E.2d 435, 442 (Ct. App. 2000).Â Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court explained that an injury â€œarises out ofâ€ employment â€œwhen there is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.â€Â  Id. at 187, 528 S.E.2d at 442.Â  Further, the burden of proof is on the claimant â€œto prove such facts as will render the injury compensable within the provisions of the State Workmenâ€™s Compensation Law.â€Â  Smith v. Union Bleachery/Cone Mills,&nbsp; 276 S.C. 454, 456, 280 S.E.2d 52, 53&nbsp;(1981)Â  (citing Ellis v. Spartan Mills, et al., 277 S.E.2d 304 (1981)).\r\nIn reviewing the medical records in this case, noticeably absent is any mention of Milesâ€™ neck and back problems being caused by his work-related accident.Â  To the contrary, the records show that Miles denied that his injuries stemmed from any prior event.Â  Moreover, the medical records show that Miles sought treatment for his neck injury as far back as September of 1999.Â  Additionally, when Miles sought disability benefits, he again denied his condition was caused by any specific event or that his injuries were related to his employment.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the Appellate Panel considered the evidence Miles submitted in favor of his position, including his testimony and the testimony of Dr. Bell, who despite not noting the accident in any of Milesâ€™ medical records testified that he thought Milesâ€™ neck and back problems were â€œmost probably relatedâ€ to the accident.Â  Therefore, Miles presented evidence before the Appellate Panel that he repeatedly denied he was injured in the work-related accident but now claims that he was untruthful and the accident caused his injuries.Â Â  \r\nÂ The Appellate Panel considered and weighed the evidence and found that Milesâ€™ injuries were not caused by the work-related accident.Â  In a workersâ€™ compensation case, â€œ[t]he final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the [Appellate Panel] and it is not the task of the court to weigh the evidence as found by the [Appellate Panel].â€ Rogers v. Kunja Knitting Mills, Inc,.&nbsp; 312 S.C. 377, 380-81, 440 S.E.2d 401, 403&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994) (citation omitted).Â  Therefore, we find substantial evidence exists upon which the Appellate Panel could conclude Milesâ€™ injuries were not caused by the March 26, 2000 accident.Â  See Jones. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 418, 586 S.E.2d 111, 113-114 (2003) (â€œOur standard of review does not permit us to weigh the evidence and make our own determination. We are bound to uphold the [Appellate Panelâ€™s] decision unless its factual determination is not supported by substantial evidence.â€) (citations omitted).Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in affirming the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision that Milesâ€™ injuries did not arise out of and during the course of his employment.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Next, Miles argues the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision because the Appellate Panel failed to recognize that his pre-existing injuries were aggravated by his work-related accident.Â  This issue, having not been raised before the Appellate Panel or the circuit court, is not preserved for review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 517, 466 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1996) (â€œArguments not raised to the workersâ€™ compensation commission or to the circuit court are not preserved for appealâ€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nÂ We find substantial evidence supports the finding that Milesâ€™ injuries were not caused by his work-related motor vehicle accident, and, therefore, did not arise out of and in the course of his employment.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and SHORT, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-367","title":"Coon v.

Coon filed a motion to vacate an arbitration award.Â  The circuit court vacated the award and ordered the parties to submit to a new arbitration proceeding.Â  Renaissance on Charleston Harbor, LLC, appeals.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Coons entered into a contract to purchase two condominium units from Renaissance.[1]Â  The contract contained a â€œtime is of the essenceâ€ clause that provided:Â  â€œIt is expressly understood and agreed that TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE as to all obligations hereunder . . . .â€Â  The contract also included a cure provision as follows:\r\n\r\n  If the Company defaults in the performance of any of the Companyâ€™s obligations as set forth in this Agreement and such default is not cured within 90 days after written notice of default is given by the Purchaser to the Company, the Purchaser will be entitled to rescind this Agreement and receive the immediate return of the Purchaserâ€™s earnest money deposit, as well as pursue any and all other remedies available at law or in equity; provided however, that in the event of the nonmaterial breach of any term or condition of this Agreement, the Purchaserâ€™s remedies will not include termination of this Agreement. Â \r\n\r\nThe contract provided for binding arbitration of disputes arising under the agreement. Â \r\nThe Coons signed the contract on May 22, 2000.Â  The contract provided for completion of the units within 24 months of the execution of the contract by the purchaser.Â  The Coons paid $109,000 in earnest money.Â  \r\nDeborah Coon did a walk-through of the units in April of 2002 with an architect and the Renaissance realtor, Keith McCann.Â  During the walk-through, Coon complained about a â€œwavy wallâ€ and a â€œspongy floorâ€ in one of the units. Â Nevertheless, certificates of occupancy for both units were issued on April 24, 2002.Â  \r\nAlthough it is unclear from the record the date the closing was originally scheduled to be held, it appears it was ultimately scheduled for June 25, 2002.Â  At the appointed time, the Coons again complained of the wall and floor in one of the units.Â  They refused to close, allegedly based on the advice of their banker and mortgage broker.Â  Coon admitted McCann kept in touch with her throughout the day about repairs and opined the problems could be fixed within twenty-four hours.Â  The following day, McCann informed Coon that if the Coons refused to close within twenty-four hours, Renaissance would consider it a breach of the contract.Â  The Coons refused to close, and Renaissance refused to return the earnest money.\r\nThe Coons filed an action for breach of contract, conversion, and unfair trade practices.Â  Pursuant to the terms of the contract, the action was heard by an arbitrator.Â  The arbitrator found the units were substantially complete, based in part on the issuance of the certificates of occupancy and â€œthe fact that the objections of the [Coons] were addressed within two days.â€Â  The arbitrator concluded the problems in the unit â€œwere nothing more than punch list items which [Renaissance] was entitled to take care of without the [Coons] walking out on the contract.â€Â  The arbitrator concluded that although the Coons would normally be entitled to rescind the contract under the â€œtime is of the essenceâ€ clause, the inclusion of a â€œcureâ€ provision entitled Renaissance to correct the units, and Renaissance â€œin fact promptly movedâ€ to do so.Â  The arbitrator accordingly denied the Coons relief and awarded attorneyâ€™s fees, costs, and arbitrator fees to Renaissance.Â  In a subsequent award, the arbitrator revised the attorneyâ€™s fee award in accordance with the applicable contract provision, awarding costs of $1,553.47, attorneyâ€™s fees of $31,818, and the arbitrator fee of $6,140.Â  In a third award, the arbitrator corrected the captions on the previous awards from â€œOrderâ€ to â€œAward.â€Â  \r\nThe Coons moved to vacate the arbitratorâ€™s award on three grounds:Â  1) the arbitrator erred by not finding the â€œtime is of the essence clauseâ€ dispositive; 2) the arbitratorâ€™s award was procured by undue means due to inappropriate comments in closing arguments before the arbitrator; and 3) the arbitrator erred by failing to limit fees and costs pursuant to the contract and under equitable principles because Renaissance was able to sell the units at a greater price than the price set in the contract.Â  \r\nThe circuit court found the arbitratorâ€™s failure to adhere strictly to the â€œtime is of the essenceâ€ clause constituted a manifest disregard of the law.Â  The court also concluded the arbitratorâ€™s award was procured by undue means based on Renaissanceâ€™s arguments â€œthat were designed to invoke passion and prejudice, and which were inflammatory in nature.â€Â  Finally, the court found the award of costs and fees was unjust based on the provision in the contract limiting fees to the arbitration proceeding.Â  The court found the arbitration proceeding lasted only two days, and fees should accordingly be limited to that time frame.Â  The court finally ordered the parties to submit to a new arbitration proceeding, and costs and fees at that proceeding were to be awarded pursuant to the courtâ€™s interpretation of the applicable provision in the contract.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œArbitration is a favored method of settling disputes in South Carolina.â€ Â Pittman Mortgage Co. v. Edwards, 327 S.C. 72, 75, 488 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1997). Â â€œGenerally speaking, an arbitration award is conclusive and courts will refuse to review the merits of an award.â€ Â Batten v. Howell, 300 S.C. 545, 547, 389 S.E.2d 170, 171 (Ct. App. 1990). Â A court reviewing an arbitration award is therefore very limited in its scope of review.Â  Weimer v. Jones,&nbsp;364 S.C. 78, 80, 610 S.E.2d 850, 852&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nâ€œTime is of the Essenceâ€ Clause\r\nRenaissance argues the circuit court erred in finding the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law by considering the â€œcureâ€ provision and not strictly adhering to the â€œtime is of the essenceâ€ provision.Â  We find no manifest disregard of the law.Â  \r\nThe Uniform Arbitration Act provides statutory grounds for vacating, modifying, or correcting an arbitratorâ€™s award. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-130 (2005) (providing grounds for vacating arbitratorâ€™s award); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-140 (2005) (providing grounds for modification or correction of arbitratorâ€™s award). Â Absent one of these grounds, an arbitration award will be vacated only on the non-statutory ground of â€œmanifest disregard or perverse misconstruction of the law.â€ Â Batten, 300 S.C. at 548, 389 S.E.2d at 172.Â  \r\nâ€œ[M]anifest disregard of the law occurs when the arbitrator knew of a governing legal principle yet refused to apply it, and the law disregarded was well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable to the case.â€ Â Bazzle v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 351 S.C. 244, 268, 569 S.E.2d 349, 361 (2002), vacated on other grounds, 539 U.S. 444 (2003).Â  To vacate an award for manifest disregard of the law requires more than a mere error in construing or applying the law.Â  Trident Technical Coll. v. Lucas &amp; Stubbs, Ltd., 286 S.C. 98, 108, 333 S.E.2d 781, 787 (1985).Â  Even the â€œclearly erroneous interpretation of [a] contractâ€ cannot be disturbed.Â  Id.Â  It is â€œexceedingly rare, requiring circumstances far more egregious than mere errors in interpreting or applying the lawâ€ to vacate an arbitration award on the ground of manifest disregard of the law.Â  Id.Â  As long as there is at least an arguable ground for an award, an arbitrator has not manifestly disregarded the law.Â  Batten, 300 S.C. at 549, 389 S.E.2d at 172. \r\nIn this case, the arbitrator recognized the â€œtime is of the essenceâ€ provision in the contract.Â  However, the arbitrator also applied the â€œcureâ€ provision in the contract, finding that although Renaissance failed to complete one of the two units within the time set by the contract, the â€œcureâ€ provision in the contract permitted Renaissance additional completion time.Â  There is at a minimum an arguable ground the arbitrator could interpret the contract in this manner.Â  See De Vore v. Piedmont Ins. Co., 144 S.C. 417, 430, 142 S.E. 593, 597 (1928) (Cothran, J., dissenting) (stating contradictory provisions in a contract must be harmonized); 17A Am.Jur.2d Contracts Â§ 485 (1991) (providing an express provision making time of the essence may be either expressly or impliedly waived). Â Accordingly, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s finding that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law in the interpretation of the contract.\r\nClosing Argument\r\nRenaissance also argues the circuit court erred in finding the arbitratorâ€™s award was procured by undue means due to Renaissance counselâ€™s comments during closing arguments before the arbitrator.Â  We agree.\r\nDuring closing arguments, the following was stated before the arbitrator:Â  \r\nRenaissance counsel:\r\n\r\n  These are sophisticated business people.Â  I do not know why they would seek to attend a closing and find the fault which they found, which we believe is unjustified.Â  Under the contract itâ€™s unjustified.Â  We have two of their witness - - three of the witnesses, the three principal witnesses whose credibility I call into issue.\r\n  And if the record that was made by them under oath today were brought to a grand jury and a solicitor - Â \r\n\r\nThe Coonsâ€™ counsel:\r\n\r\n  Wait a second.Â  This is inappropriate.\r\n\r\nThe Arbitrator:\r\n\r\n  I think it goes beyond - I think your argument goes beyond - \r\n\r\nRenaissance counsel:\r\n\r\n  At any rate, the credibility, I wanted to make a point - \r\n\r\nThe Arbitrator:\r\n\r\n  The credibility is definitely an arguable point.\r\n\r\nRenaissance counsel continued the closing argument, commenting on the bankerâ€™s testimony regarding her advice to the Coons, which differed from the Coonsâ€™ testimony of the bankerâ€™s advice to them.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Based on Renaissance counselâ€™s comments, the circuit court found the arbitratorâ€™s award was â€œprocured through undue means and in violation of S.C. Code Ann. 15-48-130 (a)(1).â€Â  Section 15-48-130 provides the statutory grounds for vacating an arbitration award:Â  \r\n\r\n  (a)Â Â Â Â  Upon application of a party, the court shall vacate an award where:\r\n  (1)Â Â Â Â  The award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means;\r\n  (2)Â Â Â Â  There was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral or corruption in any of the arbitrators or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;\r\n  (3)Â Â Â Â  The arbitrators exceeded their powers;\r\n  (4)Â Â Â Â  The arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing . . .; or\r\n  (5)Â Â Â Â  There was no arbitration agreement . . .;\r\n      But the fact that the relief was such that it could not or would not be granted by a court of law or equity is not ground for vacating or refusing to confirm the award.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-130 (a) (2005). \r\nWe find the comments did not rise to the level necessary to vacate an arbitration award based on its procurement by undue means.Â  See Trident, 286 S.C. at 108, 333 S.E.2d at 787 (construing the phrase â€˜corruption, fraud, or undue meansâ€™ under the Federal Arbitration Act to â€œproscribe affirmative misconduct by the parties, such as perjury or subornation of perjury.â€); see also General Constr. Co. v. Hering Realty Co., 201 F.Supp. 487, 491 (D.S.C. 1962) (finding a party must make it â€œabundantly clearâ€ that an award was obtained through undue means).Â  \r\nAttorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nFinally, Renaissance argues the circuit court erred in finding the award of attorneyâ€™s fees â€œunjustâ€ based upon its own review of the contract.Â  The circuit court concluded the contract provision for attorneyâ€™s fees limited the fees to the two days encompassing the arbitration itself.Â  We find the circuit court erred in reviewing the merits of the arbitratorâ€™s award.Â  As previously noted, a court may not review the merits of an arbitration award but may vacate based only upon the statutory grounds available or on the ground of manifest disregard or perverse misconstruction of the law. Â Batten, 300 S.C. at 547-48, 389 S.E.2d at 171-72.Â  The circuit court made no finding to vacate the award of attorneyâ€™s fees on any of these grounds.Â  \r\nIn any event, we find no statutory ground to vacate the award.Â  Nor do we find manifest disregard of the law in the arbitratorâ€™s award of fees.Â  The contract provision provided for attorneyâ€™s fees, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  Unless otherwise deemed appropriate by the arbitrator(s), the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneysâ€™ and arbitratorsâ€™ fees) related to the entire arbitration proceeding (including review if applicable.).\r\n\r\nThe arbitrator categorized the litigation into five phases:\r\n\r\n  Phase One â€“ Before litigationâ€”July 26, 2002â€”September 24, 2003.\r\n  Phase Two â€“ Beginning of lawsuit through mediationâ€”September 24, 2003â€”December 9, 2003.\r\n  Phase Three â€“ Mediation through arbitrationâ€”December 9, 2003â€”May 29, 2004.\r\n  Phase Four â€“ The Arbitration Hearingâ€”May 20-28, 2004.\r\n  Phase Five â€“ Post Arbitration through current date, May 22, 2004â€”July 7, 2004.\r\n\r\nRenaissance claimed fees for phases three ($17,572.50), four ($7,370), and five ($6,875.50) for a total claim of $31,818.Â  The arbitrator awarded costs from July 8, 2004 of $1,553.47, attorneyâ€™s fees of $31,818, and the arbitrator fee of $6,140.Â  We find no legal basis to vacate the award.\r\nWe therefore reverse the order under appeal and reinstate the arbitration award.Â  \r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] There was a separate contract for each condominium unit but the parties treated, and agreed at oral argument to continue to treat, the contracts as one.

Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-368\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2006 â€“ Filed October 26, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Kirsten L. Barr, of Mt. Pleasant, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        Malcolm M. Crosland, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Cynthia Johnston filed this workersâ€™ compensation claim against MeadWestvaco, her employer.Â  Mead denied the claim based on Johnstonâ€™s failure to provide timely notice of her injury.Â  A single commissioner of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission found Johnstonâ€™s notice timely under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  The full commission and circuit court affirmed.Â  Mead appeals.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nJohnston asserted she sustained a work-related injury to her neck, back, and arms on September 25, 2002 as the result of a fall.Â  At the time, she noticed only a severe headache.Â  Sometime later, she realized she chipped a tooth.Â  Johnston finished working her shift the date of the accident, worked the next day, and lost no time as a result of the accident.Â  Johnston claimed she verbally notified her supervisor, Stephanie White, of the accident at a safety meeting sometime between September 25, 2002 and October 18, 2002.Â  Johnstonâ€™s first visit to a doctor was on October 18, 2002. Â \r\nWhite admitted Johnston told her about the accident in mid-October but did not report that she had been injured.Â  White further admitted she not inquire about any possible injury.Â  Johnston formally notified Mead in writing on December 27, 2002, ninety-three days after the accident. Â \r\nThe single commissioner found Johnstonâ€™s testimony regarding verbal notice to Mead to be both credible and corroborated by Whiteâ€™s testimony.Â  Accordingly, the commissioner awarded benefits.Â  The full commission and circuit court affirmed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the commission. Â Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Â In an appeal from the commission, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (2005). Â The appellate court may reverse or modify the commissionâ€™s decision only if the claimantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Â Id.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nMead argues the commission erred in finding Johnston properly notified Mead of her accident as required by S.C. Code Â§ 42-15-20 because Johnston did not report an injury until ninety-three days after the incident.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder the applicable statutory and case law, Johnston provided notice to Mead.Â  The relevant statutory provision, section 42-15-20, requires an employee to notify the employer of a job-related accident within ninety days after its occurrence unless reasonable excuse is made for not giving such notice and the employer has not thereby been prejudiced.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (2005); Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 473, 617 S.E.2d 369, 379 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Section 42-15-20 provides no specific method for providing notice, and there is no requirement in the statute of notice of injury in addition to notice of accident.Â  Id. \r\nFurthermore, according to South Carolina case law, a supervisorâ€™s knowledge of an accident to an employee is sufficient notice to the employer to meet the statutory requirements.Â  See Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 457, 562 S.E.2d 679, 682 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 126.03(1)(b) (2001) (â€œFor adequate notice, there must be â€˜some knowledge of accompanying facts connecting the injury or illness with the employment, and indicating to a reasonably conscientious manager that the case might involve a potential compensation claim.â€™â€)).Â  The object of providing timely notice is to put the employer on notice so the incident can be timely investigated and to permit the employer to provide medical care to the employee in order to minimize the disability.Â  Hanks v. Blair Mills, 286 S.C. 378, 381, 335 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1985). Â The notice provision must be construed liberally in favor of claimants.Â  Mintz v. Fiske-Carter Constr. Co., 218 S.C. 409, 414, 63 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1951).\r\nApplying our standard of review, we find substantial evidence to support the finding that Johnston properly notified Mead of the accident and injury. Â Johnston provided notice of the September accident to White by October.Â  This notice is imputed to Mead. Â See Etheredge, 349 S.C. at 457, 562 S.E.2d at 682.Â  We find evidence to support the commission.Â  Accordingly, the order on appeal is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-369","title":"Charleston County Department of Social Services v.

(Mother) appeals the family courtâ€™s termination of her parental rights to M. (Child).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nChildâ€™s biological parents are Mother and Jonathan D (Father).Â  When Child was born, Mother and Father, a member of the armed services, resided on an Air Force Base (â€œBaseâ€).Â  In September 2002, Father left the residence and another man, Chris Gilbert, moved into it.Â  On December 5, 2002, Base personnel visited the residence to inform Mother that she had to vacate it.Â  When they arrived, they discovered Child covered in bruises.Â  The next day, North Charleston law enforcement arrived and observed Child bruised and limping.Â  Law enforcement found the residence in â€œtotal disarrayâ€: dishes were strewn across the kitchen countertop; broken glass and trash covered the kitchen floor.Â  Law enforcement also found an indentation in the wall caused by repeated blows from Childâ€™s head.Â  \r\nThe Charleston County Department of Social Services (â€œDepartmentâ€) immediately took twenty-one month old Child into emergency protective custody.Â  At the time, Child was unkempt, limped, and, as medical examination revealed, suffered from physical trauma.Â  Mother testified Gilbert caused Childâ€™s bruises.Â  She explained Gilbert would make Child stand in the corner of a room and bend over and touch the floor for twenty minutes at a time.Â  If Child was unable to do so, Gilbert â€œthumpedâ€ Childâ€™s feet.Â  Despite Gilbertâ€™s abuse of Child, Mother never called either military or civilian law enforcement about Gilbertâ€™s actions. \r\n The Department and Mother entered into a treatment plan that required Mother to participate in parent effectiveness training and undergo psychiatric assessments.Â  Ultimately, Mother was unable to complete the treatment plan and on April 14, 2004, the Department brought a termination of parental rights (TPR) action against Mother.Â  After a hearing, the family court granted the Departmentâ€™s TPR action against Mother.Â  The family court found multiple statutory grounds existed to terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights and TPR was in the best interests of Child.Â  Mother appealed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR case, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before parental rights can be terminated, the alleged grounds for the termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 357, 296 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1982); S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, however, we should not necessarily disregard the findings of the family court, because the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMother argues the family court erred in granting the Departmentâ€™s TPR action against her.Â  We disagree. \r\n Section 20-7-1572 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) governs TPR actions in South Carolina.Â  â€œThe family court may order TPR if it makes the twofold finding that plaintiff has proved by clear and convincing evidence the existence of at least one statutory ground enumerated in section 20-7-1572 . . . and TPR would be in the best interest of the child.â€Â  Charleston County Depâ€™t. of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 97, 627 S.E.2d 765, 771 (Ct. App. 2006). \r\n The family court found Child was abused and, because of the severity or repetition of the abuse, it was unlikely the home could be made safe for Child within twelve months.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(1).[2]Â  Mother did not appeal this finding; therefore, it is the law of the case.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 628 n.3, 627 S.E.2d 718, 721, n.3 (2006).Â  Accordingly, so long as TPR was also in the best interest of Child, we will uphold the family courtâ€™s order.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (family court may order TPR based on â€œone or moreâ€ statutory ground and the finding that TPR is in the best interests of the child). \r\nEven if Mother appealed this finding, however, the record fully supports the family courtâ€™s conclusion Child was harmed and that because of the degree of abuse the home could not be made safe within a year.Â  Under section 20-7-490(2) (Supp. 2005), â€œChild abuseâ€ occurs when the parent â€œinflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or engages in acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or mental injury to the child, including injuries sustained as a result of excessive corporal punishment . . . .â€Â  The record shows Child suffered significant physical and mental abuse at the hands of Mother and Gilbert.Â  Even if Mother did not actively abuse Child, she allowed Gilbert to do so, and did little to prevent it.Â  Further, there is no indication the home could be safe enough for Child to return to it within a year.Â  Mother testified that she was not prepared to take custody of Child at the time of hearing.Â  Motherâ€™s own witness, her therapist, testified that Motherâ€™s demeanor remained â€œchaoticâ€ and â€œincendiaryâ€ and that it would be unwise to place Child in Motherâ€™s home at this time.Â  Thus, the record supports the family courtâ€™s finding. \r\n The family court also found TPR is in the best interests of Child.Â  Again, Mother did not appeal this finding, so it is the law of the case.Â  Seegars, 367 S.C. at 628 n.3, 627 S.E.2d at 721, n.3.Â  Even if Mother appealed this finding, however, the record supports the family courtâ€™s conclusion that TPR is in the best interests of Child.Â  Childâ€™s caseworker and guardian ad litem testified TPR would be in Childâ€™s best interests.Â  They both witnessed Childâ€™s positive transformation since Childâ€™s placement with her foster parents in April 2003.Â  Additionally, Childâ€™s foster parents wish to adopt Child.Â  The family court did not err in finding TPR in the best interests of Child.Â  Thus, the family courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\n HEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n[2]Â  Section 20-7-1572(1) provides that the family court may terminate parental rights if TPR is in the best interests of the child and the child \r\n\r\n  has been harmed as defined in section 20-7-490, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months. Â In determining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the parentâ€™s previous abuse or neglect of the child or another child in the home may be considered . . . .\r\n\r\n[3]Â  In light of this disposition, we need not address Motherâ€™s remaining issues.Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-370","title":"Demorcy v.

Matos, of Goose Creek, pro se; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  On August 17, 2004, the circuit court granted a default judgment in favor of BB&amp;T of South Carolina.Â  BB&amp;T contends the circuit court erred when the court rescinded its order of August 17, 2004 and issued a subsequent order on September 28, 2004.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn August 2001 and June 2002, Jose and Karen Matos entered into agreements with BB&amp;T for a line of credit and credit cards.Â  Pursuant to the agreements, the Matoses contracted to pay the balance, plus interest, in a variable number of monthly installments comprised of a percentage of the balance.Â  The agreements also provide that in the event of default, BB&amp;T has the right to declare the entire unpaid balance to be immediately due.Â  Furthermore, the agreements provide that if an attorney becomes involved, the Matoses shall pay all attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.[1]Â  \r\nIn August 2003, the Matoses failed to make a payment as required, thereby breaching the agreements.Â  BB&amp;T brought the current action on June 29, 2004, alleging the Matoses failed to make payments pursuant to the agreement and misrepresented their ability to make the payments pursuant to the agreement.Â  BB&amp;T alleged in its Complaint the Matoses had a past due amount of $23,982.89, plus interest at the rate of 8.75 percent.Â  BB&amp;T further alleged the Matoses had been made aware of their default status and had been given the opportunity to become current with their payments, but they failed to do so.Â  \r\nOn August 17, 2004, with receipt of no pleading, motion, or objection and with none appearing in the circuit courtâ€™s file, BB&amp;T filed an Affidavit of Default with further verification of debt and requested a default judgment.Â  On August 17, 2004, the circuit court issued a judgment for $29,771.39 against the Matoses.Â  The judgment confirms that there was no responsive pleading of record and provides that â€œcancellation, satisfaction, or modification be entered only upon signature of the attorney of record or Order of this court following proper notice and hearing.â€Â  (emphasis in original). Â On August 18, 2004, the Clerk of Court served notice of judgment upon both parties.Â  \r\nThirty-eight days later, on September 24, 2004, the circuit court issued a Form 4 order stating the August 17, 2004 judgment was â€œrescinded.â€Â  The September 24, 2004 order states as follows:Â  \r\n\r\nJudgment order entered on August 17, 2004 will be rescinded as it was prematurely signed.Â  The Plaintiffâ€™s Motion for Default Judgment will be set on a non-jury docket to be heard at an appropriate time.Â  Defendantsâ€™ Motion for Reconsideration is now moot.Â  \r\n\r\nBB&amp;T maintains the second order was issued either sua sponte or based on inappropriate ex parte contact.Â  On the day BB&amp;T received the September 24, 2004 order, it notified the circuit court of its concern and requested that the prior judgment be reinstated.Â  The circuit court declined to reinstate the prior order, and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBB&amp;T contends the circuit court erred in issuing the September 24, 2004 order.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn matters concerning a default judgment, Rule 55(a), SCRCP, states default may be entered â€œwhen a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise.â€Â  An entry of default may be set aside â€œ[f]or good cause shown,â€ and if a â€œjudgment by default has been entered, [the court] may likewise set it aside in accordance with Rule 60(b).â€Â  See Rule 55(c), SCRCP.Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP, states that relief from judgment or order may be given based on the following:Â  \r\n\r\n(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n    \r\n  (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\r\n  \r\n  (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);\r\n\r\n  (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;\r\n\r\n  (4) the judgment is void;\r\n\r\n  (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the circuit court did not follow any of these methods.Â  Instead, the circuit court rescinded the default order thirty-eight days after it was rendered and not pursuant to a motion for reconsideration, a motion the circuit court deemed moot.Â  See Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 156, 543 S.E.2d 224, 229 (Ct. App. 2001); See also Rule 59(e), SCRCP (â€œMotion to Alter or Amend a Judgment. Â A motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after receipt of written notice of the entry of the order.â€); Rule 59(d), SCRCP (â€œOn Initiative of Court. Not later than 10 days after entry of judgment, the court of its own initiative may order a new trial for any reason for which it might have granted a new trial on motion of a party. Â After giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard on the matter, the court may grant a motion for a new trial, timely served, for a reason not stated in the motion. Â In either case, the court shall specify in the order the grounds\r\ntherefor.â€).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the circuit court erred in issuing the September 28, 2004 order because the circuit court lacked jurisdiction.Â  Because we find the September 28, 2004 order is now void, the finding in that order that the motion to reconsider is moot has also been voided.Â  We remand for a ruling on that motion.Â  If the circuit court should find the motion was not properly served and filed or is unmeritorious, the default judgment is upheld.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.[2]Â \r\n \r\n GOOLSBY,&nbsp; WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The agreements are not provided in the record, and as a result, these facts are taken from the Complaint.Â  Because the Matoses failed to answer BB&amp;Tâ€™s complaint, the allegations therein are deemed admitted and consequently relied upon by this Court.Â  (Rule 8(d), SCRCP. â€œEffect of Failure to Deny. Â Averments in a pleading to which a responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the amount of damage, are admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading.â€).Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-372","title":"State v.

Early, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-372\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2006 â€“ Filed October 31, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nKatherine Carruth Link, of W. Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Â Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Bobby Gibson, Jr., appeals his convictions and sentences for possession of crack cocaine, trafficking in cocaine, and trafficking in crack cocaine.Â  Gibson argues the trial court should not have admitted the drug evidence because it was seized pursuant to:Â  (1) an invalid warrantless search; (2) search warrants not issued in accordance with section 17-13-140 of the South Carolina Code; and (3) search warrants not served in accordance with section 17-13-150 of the South Carolina Code. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the morning of September 30, 2004, Deputy Brian Duncan, employed with the Spartanburg County Sheriffâ€™s Office, arrested Gibson for driving under a suspended license.Â  Directly thereafter, Deputy Duncan searched Gibsonâ€™s person.Â  Attached to Gibsonâ€™s side was a cell phone case.Â  Deputy Duncan searched the cell phone case and found a small white rock, later identified as crack cocaine.Â  \r\nSubsequently, two search warrants were issued to search Gibsonâ€™s residence and business.Â  The warrants were based on information obtained through an ongoing investigation and on Gibsonâ€™s possession of crack cocaine on the date in question. Â The warrants were signed by a judge and obtained at 2:40 p.m. on September 30, 2004.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAt 4:24 p.m. on the day the warrants were issued, officers executed the search warrant for 2015 Howard Street, Gibsonâ€™s residence.Â  The search of Gibsonâ€™s residence yielded a pill bottle containing several rocks of crack cocaine, a set of digital scales, a small bag of marijuana, and $156,000 in cash.Â  An unsigned copy of the warrant was left at the residence.Â  \r\nAt 5:45 p.m., officers executed the search warrant for 420 Farley Avenue, a commercial building owned by Gibson.Â  During this search, the officers found a bag containing a large amount of a white powder substance, which was later identified as 705.32 grams of cocaine.Â  An unsigned copy of the warrant was left at the commercial building.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nA Spartanburg County grand jury indicted Gibson for possession of crack cocaine, trafficking in cocaine, and trafficking in crack cocaine.Â  Prior to trial, Gibson moved to suppress the drug evidence.Â  He asserted the search of the cell phone case was improper.Â  Based on this assertion, Gibson contended the illegality of the search provided an illegal basis for the search warrants.Â  Specifically, he argued the search exceeded the scope of the initial traffic stop given he had been arrested and was under the complete control of Deputy Duncan.Â  In response, the State claimed the search was incident to Gibsonâ€™s lawful arrest. Â After hearing testimony from Deputy Duncan and arguments of counsel, the court denied Gibsonâ€™s motion.Â  The court ruled the search was incident to a lawful arrest.\r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case and after all the evidence was introduced, Gibson moved to quash the search warrants alleging the officers failed to serve copies of the warrants as required by sections 17-13-140 and 17-13-150 of the South Carolina Code (2003).[2]Â  Because the search warrants that were left at Gibsonâ€™s residence and business were not signed, Gibson claimed the warrants were not executed in accordance with the cited statutes and, thus, the officers conducted a warrantless search. Â In response, the State showed the court certified copies of the warrants that were signed by a judge at the time they were issued.Â  The State also asserted:Â  (1) the officers acted in good faith in conducting the search; (2) any error was ministerial; and (3) Gibson was not prejudiced by the error.Â  After hearing testimony from Gibson and the arguments of counsel, the court denied Gibsonâ€™s motion.Â  The court based its decision on the fact the certified copies of the warrants indicated a judge signed the warrants prior to the searches of Gibsonâ€™s residence and business. \r\nAfter the jury convicted Gibson of all three charges, the court sentenced Gibson to fifteen years imprisonment for the possession offense and thirty years imprisonment for each trafficking offense.Â  The sentences were to be served concurrently.Â  The court also imposed fines of $15,000 for the possession charge, $50,000 for trafficking in crack cocaine, and $200,000 for trafficking in cocaine.Â  Gibson appeals.Â  Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court reviews errors of law only and is bound by factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.Â \r\nStatev. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). â€œThe trial judgeâ€™s factual findings on whether evidence should be suppressed due to a Fourth Amendment violation are reviewed for clear error.â€Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  â€œA courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.â€ State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nGibson argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash the search warrants and suppress the seized evidence.Â  He contends the warrants were not issued in accordance with section 17-13-140 and the State failed to provide copies of the issued warrants and the affidavits as required by section 17-13-150.Â  We disagree.Â  Â \r\nAlthough Gibson raised this argument to the trial court, it was untimely given it was not presented until after the State introduced the search evidence.Â  Initially, we note that Gibson was aware of any alleged violation of the statutory requirements prior to trial.Â  During the in camera hearing the court held on this motion, Gibson testified that he brought the original, unsigned search warrants to his counselâ€™s office shortly after he was arrested.Â  Thus, we find Gibson could have presented this argument during the pre-trial hearing.Â  Furthermore, Gibson failed to timely object to the introduction of evidence on this ground during the Stateâ€™s case.Â  Significantly, the objections raised by Gibson to the admission of the evidence only referenced what was discussed in the pre-trial hearing.Â  Accordingly, we find Gibson did not preserve these issues for appellate review.Â  See State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, 265-66, 589 S.E.2d 6, 9 (2003) (finding defendant failed to preserve issue regarding the admissibility of seized evidence where he did not make a motion in limine and did not timely move to suppress the evidence); State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 609, 486 S.E.2d 762, 764 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œFailure to object when the evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to object.â€); see also McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 344, 479 S.E.2d 67, 75 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œTo preserve an issue regarding the admissibility of evidence, a contemporaneous objection must be made.â€); cf. State v. Sampson, 317 S.C. 423, 426, 454 S.E.2d 721, 722 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding defendantsâ€™ failure to object to search evidence during the Stateâ€™s case-in-chief did not bar appellate review of defendantsâ€™ challenge to the search warrant affidavit where the defendants â€œraised the issue as soon as it became apparent the affidavit and the solicitorâ€™s representations may have been incorrectâ€). Â Â Â Â \r\nII.\r\nGibson next contends the trial court erred in failing to suppress the seized evidence because the search of his cell phone case exceeded the scope of a search incident to arrest and was, therefore, illegal.Â  Because Gibson had been arrested and was under the control of Deputy Duncan, he asserts the search was unrelated to the completed traffic stop.Â  Additionally, Gibson argues the search was invalid given Deputy Duncan searched property that was outside the possession and control of Gibson.Â  We disagree. \r\nAs a threshold matter, we question whether this issue is properly preserved for our review.Â  â€œA pretrial ruling on the admissibility of evidence is preliminary and is subject to change based on developments at trial.â€Â  State v. Smith, 337 S.C. 27, 32, 522 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1999).Â  Therefore, â€œ[w]e have consistently held a ruling in limine is not final, and unless an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling procured, the issue is not preserved for review.â€Â  State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 193 n.3, 498 S.E.2d 642, 644 n.3 (1998).\r\nIn this case, while Gibson raised the necessary pre-trial objection in the suppression hearing, Gibson did not object to the admission of several pieces of evidence at the time the evidence was introduced.Â  Specifically, Gibson failed to raise an objection when the State introduced the digital scales, the pill bottle, the bag that contained the cocaine, and the crack cocaine found on Gibsonâ€™s person.Â  However, Gibson did raise an objection to the admission of the cell phone case which occurred during the examination of the first trial witness.Â  Additionally, Gibson objected to the admission of the other drug evidence.Â  Moreover, in objecting to the other drug evidence, Gibson stated, â€œNo objection on this [the admission of the crack cocaine found at the house] or the previous one [the crack cocaine found on Gibsonâ€™s person], subject of course to . . . pretrial matters.â€Â  Because Gibson neglected to object to some of the evidence, he failed to preserve this issue for review as to those pieces of evidence.Â  See McKissick, 325 S.C. at 344, 479 S.E.2d at 75 (â€œTo preserve an issue regarding the admissibility of evidence, a contemporaneous objection must be made.â€).Â  In any event, we find Gibson arguably preserved this issue for the remaining pieces of evidence.Â  To the extent this issue is preserved, we find it fails on the merits.Â  \r\nâ€œThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  Evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded from trial.â€Â  State v. Khingratsaiphon, 352 S.C. 62, 69, 572 S.E.2d 456, 459 (2002).Â  â€œGenerally, a warrantless search is per se unreasonable and violates the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.â€Â  State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 131, 620 S.E.2d 737, 740 (2005), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 2287 (2006).Â  â€œHowever, a warrantless search will withstand constitutional scrutiny where the search falls within one of several well recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement.â€Â  Id. at 132, 620 S.E.2d at 740.Â  Â These exceptions include: (1) search incident to a lawful arrest; (2) â€œhot pursuit;â€ (3) stop and frisk; (4) automobile exception; (5) â€œplain viewâ€ doctrine; (6) consent; and (7) abandonment. State v. Dupree, 319 S.C. 454, 456-57, 462 S.E.2d 279, 281 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1131 (1996). \r\nAs stated above, one exception to the warrant requirement is a search incident to arrest.Â  State v. Brown, 289 S.C. 581, 587, 347 S.E.2d 882, 885 (1986).Â  The search incident to arrest is allowed as an exception to the warrant requirement to enable the officer to disarm the arrestee and preserve evidence.Â  Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 763 (1969); Freiburger, 366 S.C. at 132, 620 S.E.2d at 740.Â  Thus, a police officer may search an arrestee and the area within the arresteeâ€™s immediate control for weapons and destructible evidence without first obtaining a warrant.Â  State v. Cannon, 336 S.C. 335, 339, 520 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1999) (citing U.S. v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973)).Â  However, â€œ[a] search may be conducted incident to an arrest only if it is substantially contemporaneous with the arrest and is confined to the immediate vicinity of the arrest.â€Â  Brown, 289 S.C. at 587, 347 S.E.2d at 885.Â  \r\nHere, the evidence seized was in a cell phone case attached to Gibsonâ€™s person and clearly within his immediate control.Â  Deputy Duncan also conducted the search immediately after Gibson was arrested.Â  Therefore, we find the evidence was obtained pursuant to a lawful search incident to arrest.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in refusing to suppress the seized evidence.Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the question of whether the search warrants violated certain statutory provisions is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Thus, the trial courtâ€™s determination that the warrants were valid must stand.Â  We further find the evidence seized from Gibsonâ€™s cell phone case was the result of a lawful search incident to arrest.Â  Accordingly, Gibsonâ€™s convictions and sentences are \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Section 17-13-140 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nA warrant issued hereunder shall be issued only upon affidavit sworn to before the magistrate, municipal judicial officer, or judge of a court of record establishing the grounds for the warrant. If the magistrate, municipal judge, or other judicial officer abovementioned is satisfied that the grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist, he shall issue a warrant identifying the property and naming or describing the person or place to be searched.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2003).\r\nSection 17-13-150 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\nWhen any person is served with a search warrant, such person shall be furnished with a copy of the warrant along with the affidavit upon which such warrant was issued.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-150 (2003).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
