(Mother) appeals from the family courtâ€™s order terminating her parental\r\n  rights (TPR) to her minor children, M.H. and J.B.Â  Mother argues the family\r\n  court erred in finding DSS established, by clear and convincing evidence, that:\r\n  (1) Mother satisfied a statutory ground for TPR, and (2) TPR was in the best\r\n  interest of M.H. and J.B.Â  We disagree.\r\n1.&nbsp; We affirm\r\n  the family courtâ€™s finding that clear and convincing evidence established that M.H.\r\n  and J.B. were outside the home of either parent for six months, and during that\r\n  time, Mother's failure to visit them was &quot;willful.&quot; See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (Supp. 2008) (stating the family court may order TPR upon\r\n  finding a statutory ground is established and also finding TPR is in the best\r\n  interest of the children); S.C.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert Mills Ariail, of Greenville, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Richard Horace Stegall was indicted and tried for murder.Â  During its second\r\n  day of deliberations, the jury notified the trial judge it was deadlocked.Â  The\r\n  jury returned to the courtroom, and the trial judge issued an Allen charge.[1]Â \r\n  Neither the State nor Stegall objected to the charge.Â  Later that afternoon,\r\n  the jury sent the trial judge a note that said, &quot;We still have jurors who\r\n  are firmly decided to different verdicts.&quot;Â  Both the trial judge and\r\n  counsel for the parties understood this note to indicate continuing deadlock.Â \r\n  After declaring a mistrial, the trial judge adjourned court and walked to the\r\n  jury room.Â  The jury informed him they were not deadlocked and would like to\r\n  take another vote.Â  The trial judge immediately left the jury room, returning to\r\n  the courtroom eight minutes after he had left it.Â  \r\nBetween the trial judge's return to the courtroom and his\r\n  statement on the record of what transpired in the jury room, the jury notified\r\n  the bailiff it had reached a verdict.Â  The trial judge conferred extensively\r\n  with counsel concerning how to proceed.Â  While the State favored accepting the\r\n  jury's verdict, Stegall maintained a mistrial was appropriate because the trial\r\n  judge had impermissibly entered the jury room.Â  Given an opportunity to\r\n  indicate anonymously whether the trial judge's appearance in the jury room had\r\n  influenced their decision, the jurors responded it had not.Â  The trial judge\r\n  then published the verdict of voluntary manslaughter and had the court clerk\r\n  poll the jury.Â  At Stegall's request, the trial judge delayed sentencing.Â  \r\nAt the sentencing hearing, the trial judge conferred with counsel\r\n  to determine whether either the State or Stegall had reconsidered its position\r\n  on the issue of mistrial.Â  The State still desired acceptance of the verdict.Â \r\n  Stegall reconsidered and stated, &quot;Your Honor, after consulting with my\r\n  client, we would accept the verdict of voluntary manslaughter.&quot; Â Stegall\r\n  was then sentenced to twenty-eight years' imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nStegall argues the trial judge committed reversible error by\r\n  entering the jury room during deliberations.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nTrial courts have broad discretion in deciding whether to declare\r\n  a mistrial.Â  State v. Ferguson, 376 S.C. 615, 618, 658 S.E.2d 101, 103&nbsp;&nbsp; (2008).Â  An appellate court will not reverse the grant or denial of a mistrial &quot;absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  grant of a mistrial is &quot;a serious and extreme measure which should only be\r\n  taken when the prejudice can be removed no other way.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  618-19, 658 S.E.2d at 103.Â  \r\nEntering the jury's verdict instead of declaring a mistrial was\r\n  within the trial judge's broad discretion in this case.Â  A party who has\r\n  invited or induced a particular ruling by the trial court cannot complain of it\r\n  on appeal, even if the ruling was error.Â  See Floyd v. Thornton,\r\n  220 S.C. 414, 425-26, 68 S.E.2d 334, 339 (1951).Â  Although Stegall initially\r\n  opposed the jury's verdict because the trial judge entered the jury room during\r\n  deliberations, he ultimately accepted the verdict without objection.Â  Stegall\r\n  cannot complain on appeal of a result to which he acceded.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  decision of the trial judge is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] When a jury indicates deadlock, a judge may issue an Allen charge, encouraging them &quot;to approach the evidence with an open mind and\r\n  consider the opinions of their fellow jurors.&quot;Â  State v.

Steinmeyer, of Columbia, and MichaelÂ  Tanner, of Bamberg,\r\n  for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tMatthewÂ  Cook, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J.:Â  In\r\n  this workers' compensation case, Appellant Mary Adams seeks review of the\r\n  circuit court's conclusion that her claim, filed over twenty-three years after her\r\n  injury, was barred by the statute of limitations, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  Adams argues that Respondents Westinghouse SRS and Wausau Insurance\r\n  Companies waived their right to assert any affirmative defenses to her claim,\r\n  including the statute of limitations, because they failed to timely respond to\r\n  her claim.Â  Despite the obvious disadvantages of allowing this extraordinarily\r\n  stale claim to proceed forward, we reach the inescapable conclusion that\r\n  Respondents' statute of limitations defense is procedurally barred.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we must reverse the circuit court's order and remand the matter to the\r\n  Commission. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nOn July 7, 1977, Adams injured her neck and back when she was pinned in a machine while working for\r\n  Westinghouse SRS.Â  Her first attempt to notify the Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission of a claim was when she filed a Form 50 on December 14, 2000, over twenty-three years after her injury.Â  Other than a failed attempt to retain\r\n  an attorney in April 2002, there is nothing in the record to show the\r\n  subsequent history of this filing.Â  On August 23, 2004, Adams filed a second Form 50.Â  \r\nOn September 3, 2004, the Commission mailed the Form 50 to Wausau at its Maitland, Florida office.Â  Respondents\r\n  filed their Form 51 Answer to Adams' claim on October 12, 2004.Â  They asserted numerous defenses, including the statute of limitations and the doctrine of\r\n  laches.Â  The single commissioner conducted a hearing on the claim on January\r\n  20, 2005, and filed an order denying the claim on March 15, 2005.Â  The single commissioner concluded that Adams' claim was barred under section 42-15-40\r\n  because she did not timely file her claim.[1]Â \r\n  The single commissioner also concluded that Adams' claim was barred by the\r\n  doctrine of laches.Â  \r\nThe Appellate Panel reversed the\r\n  single commissioner's order on the ground that Respondents failed to file their\r\n  Form 51 within the thirty-day deadline set forth in 25A S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. 67-603.B(1) (Supp. 2008).Â  Regulation 67-603.B(1) requires the\r\n  employer's attorney to file the Form 51 with the Commission's\r\n  Judicial Department within thirty days of service of the Form 50.Â  The Commission\r\n  concluded that because Respondents failed to timely file their response to Adams' claim, they waived their affirmative defenses pursuant to 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  67-603.C (Supp. 2008).[2]Â \r\n  The Commission also concluded that even if Respondents did not forfeit their\r\n  right to raise the defense of laches, they did not provide any admissible\r\n  evidence of any of the elements of laches, such as prejudice.Â  \r\nThe circuit court reversed the\r\n  Appellate Panel's order and reinstated the single commissioner's order.Â  The\r\n  circuit court concluded that Respondents' Form 51 was not due for filing until October 12, 2004, the same day Respondents filed their Form 51.Â  The circuit court\r\n  explained that Respondents could take advantage of Rule 6(e), SCRCP, which\r\n  allows an addition of five days to a response deadline when a party has been served\r\n  with a notice or paper by mail.[3]Â \r\n  The circuit court calculated the due date for the Form 51 by tacking on an\r\n  additional five days at the end of the thirty-day period and by further\r\n  extending the period to account for weekend days both before and after adding the five days.Â  The circuit court stated,\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  letter was sent out dated September 3, 2004 that achieved proper service.Â \r\n  Under 67-209 [sic], the [thirty-day] period in which the respondent must\r\n  respond would then commence on the next day, September 4, 2004.Â  See S.C. Code Regs. 67-209(A) (2006).Â  When counting these days, '[t]he day of\r\n  the event, after which a designated period of time begins, is excluded.'Â  Id.Â  Therefore, an answer was due by the end of a [thirty-day] period that began to\r\n  run on September 4.Â  This period expired on October 3, which in 2004 fell on a\r\n  Sunday.Â  When determining the length of an answer term, weekend days and\r\n  holidays are included 'unless the designated time period ends on a\r\n  Saturday, Sunday, State or Federal holiday.'Â  S.C. Code Regs.\r\n  67-209(B) (emphasis added).Â  In those types of cases, the final day the answer\r\n  is due is 'the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, State or Federal\r\n  holiday.'Â  Id.Â  In 2004, the next non-weekend or non-holiday date to\r\n  follow October 3 would have been Monday October 4, 2004.Â  Under 67-209 [sic], the [thirty-day] period extended to that date.Â  \r\n\tThe period would then\r\n    extend again under Rule 6 of the South Carolina Rules of Procedure.\r\n\t.\r\n  . .\r\n\tSouth\r\n  Carolina rule of Civil Procedure 6(e) allows a 'grace period' of five days\r\n  beyond the normal due date of any action in response to something served\r\n  via U.S. Mail[.] \r\n\t.\r\n  . . \r\n\tIn\r\n  the present case, after applying South Carolina Code of Regulations 67-209, the\r\n  [thirty-day] term available for an answer ended on October 4, 2004.Â  Because the service required an answer, however,\r\n\tan additional five (5) days can be\r\n    added beyond this date.Â  That places the expiration on the ninth day of\r\n  October, which in 2004 fell on a Saturday.\r\n\tWith\r\n  the new expiration date of October 9, 2004 occurring on a weekend, Section\r\n  67-209(B) again applies to extend the due date to Tuesday, October 12.Â  In\r\n  2004 October 10 fell on a Sunday and October 11 was a federal holidayâ€”Columbus Day.Â \r\n  Therefore, the expiration date had to extend to the first non-weekend or\r\n  non-holiday date:Â  October 12, 2004.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThe circuit court concluded that\r\n  Respondents timely filed their Form 51 and that they did not waive their\r\n  affirmative defenses.Â  The circuit court declined to rule on the issue of\r\n  laches but concluded that Adams' claim was barred by the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.\r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in concluding that \r\n\t\t\tRespondents timely filed their Form 51 because Rule 6(e), SCRCP, allowed them a five-dayÂ  grace period?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in concluding that \r\n\t\t\tRespondents did not waive their affirmative defenses?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act\r\n  establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions by the Appellate\r\n  Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission.&nbsp; See Lark v.\r\n    Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).&nbsp;\r\n  Specifically, section 1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) provides\r\n  that this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel\r\n  as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse when the\r\n  decision is affected by an error of law.&nbsp; See \r\nHamilton v.

Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630\r\n  S.E.2d 42, 43&nbsp;(2006).&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Timeliness of Response to Claim\r\nAdams assigns error to the\r\n  circuit court's conclusion that Respondents timely filed their Form 51 due to\r\n  the additional five days allowed by Rule 6(e), SCRCP.[4]Â \r\n  Adams argues that Rule 6(e) does not apply to procedures under the Workers'\r\n  Compensation Law.[5]Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nRegulation 67-603.B(1) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) requires the employer's attorney to file the Form 51 with\r\n  the Commission's Judicial Department within thirty days of service of the\r\n  employee's Form 50.Â  Additionally, like Rule 6(a) of the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Civil Procedure, Regulation 67-209 of the South Carolina Code (1990) sets\r\n  forth requirements for the computation of time in determining filing or service\r\n  deadlines.Â  It provides:\r\n\r\n\tA. The day of the event, after\r\n  which a designated period of time begins, is excluded. The last day, of the\r\n  designated time period, is included.B. Saturdays, Sundays, State, and Federal holidays are included unless the\r\n  designated time period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, State, or Federal holiday in\r\n  which case the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, State, or Federal\r\n  holiday is included as the last day.\r\n\r\nRegulation 67-209\r\n  does not allow additional days to respond when a party has been served by\r\n  mail.Â  Further, the only other workers' compensation regulation that allows an\r\n  additional five days applies only in the instance when the Commission has\r\n  served a party with an order using first class mail.Â  Regulation 67-213.A of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) provides as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n\tA.\r\n  The Commission serves orders by certified mail, return receipt requested\r\n  or by deposit in the United States Postal Service, first class postage,\r\n  addressed to the parties according to R.67-210.\r\n\t.\r\n  . .\r\n\t(2) When service is made by certified\r\n  mail, the date of service is the date of the addressee's receipt indicated by\r\n  the certified mail return receipt. When service is made by first class mail,\r\n    five days are added to the date of mailing. Service by first class mail is\r\n    deemed complete five days after the date of deposit in the United States Postal Service.Â Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nBecause an additional\r\n  five days to take action is expressly allowed by Regulation 67-213.A when the Commission serves an order by\r\n  first class mail but not provided for in any other workers' compensation\r\n  regulation, a five-day addition is clearly not allowed under any other\r\n  circumstances in workers' compensation cases.Â  See \r\nRiverwoods, LLC v.\r\n    County of Charleston,\r\n  349 S.C. 378, 384, 563 S.E.2d 651, 655&nbsp;(2002)&nbsp;(citing the rule of\r\n  statutory construction that to express or include one\r\n  thing implies the exclusion of another, or of the alternative); \r\nScholtec v.

Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-650 (Supp. 2008) in support of their proposition that the\r\n  rules automatically apply to the ALC.Â  However, section 1-23-650 does not stand\r\n  for this proposition.Â  Rather, this statute authorizes the ALC to establish its own rules of procedure &quot;consistent with the rules of procedure\r\n  governing civil actions in courts of common pleas[.]&quot;Â  \r\nThe ALC's own rules\r\n  determine whether it is appropriate to use the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure as a gap filler&#9472;their application to ALC proceedings is not\r\n  automatic.Â  See ALC Rule 68 (&quot;The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules may,\r\n    where practicable, be applied in proceedings before the Court to resolve\r\n      questions not addressed by these rules.&quot;)\r\n  (emphasis added); see also Home Med. Sys., Inc. v. S.C. Dept. of\r\n    Revenue, Op. No. 26638 (S.C.\r\n  Sup. Ct. filed April 20, 2009) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 17 at 25) Â (holding\r\n  that Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motions are permitted in ALC proceedings because\r\n  the ALC rules specifically allow the Rules of Civil Procedure to apply to\r\n  resolve questions not addressed by the ALC rules and because a Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion is necessary for issue preservation in administrative proceedings when\r\n  a party raises an issue or argument, but the ALC does not rule on it). \r\nIn stark contrast, there\r\n  is no provision in the workers' compensation regulations similar to ALC Rule 68, allowing for the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure to fill in any gaps.Â  In any\r\n  event, the need for the additional five days under certain circumstances was\r\n  obviously contemplated by the Commission when it drafted the workers'\r\n  compensation regulations, as evidenced by 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-213.A (Supp. 2008) (allowing an additional five days when\r\n  the Commission serves an order by first class mail).Â  Therefore, there is no true &quot;gap&quot; in the regulations\r\n  resulting in a need to refer to any other provision outside the workers'\r\n  compensation regulations. \r\nFurthermore, the\r\n  Commission's reference to the Rules of Civil Procedure in certain regulations\r\n  but not in others indicates that in promulgating regulations, the Commission\r\n  was aware of the wisdom of incorporating the Rules under those circumstances specifically\r\n  identified by regulation rather than adopting the Rules as a general gap filler\r\n  to be applied on an ad hoc basis.Â  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-211\r\n  (Supp. 2008) (allowing service of the claimant's hearing request pursuant to\r\n  the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure if the hearing request is returned\r\n  after mailing).Â  Notably absent from the workers' compensation regulations is a\r\n  reference to Rule 6(e), SCRCP. \r\nMoreover, this Court must give\r\n  deference to the Commission's interpretation of its own regulations in determining\r\n  whether the Commission's decision was affected by an error of law.Â  See \r\nEarl v. HTH Assocs., Inc./Ace USA\r\n    Ins. Co. of N. Am., 368 S.C. 76,\r\n  81, 627 S.E.2d 760, 762&nbsp;(Ct.

Comm'n, 267 S.C. 536, 540, 230 S.E.2d\r\n  219, 221-22&nbsp;(1976) (holding that the construction\r\n  of a statute by the agency charged with executing\r\n  it is entitled to the most respectful consideration and should not be overruled\r\n  without cogent reasons).Â \r\n  Additionally, workers' compensation regulations must be construed in favor of\r\n  the employee in doubtful cases.Â  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-201.B (1990)\r\n  (&quot;In doubtful cases, the application of these regulations shall be in\r\n  favor of the injured employee.&quot;); Earl,\r\n  368 S.C. at 80-81, 627 S.E.2d at 762 (holding that workers'\r\n  compensation statutes and regulations are to be construed liberally in favor of coverage).[6]Â \r\n  Hence, the absence of any statute, regulation, or appellate opinion expressly\r\n  allowing the application of Rule 6(e) to workers' compensation regulations\r\n  compels the conclusion that the Appellate Panel did not\r\n  commit an error of law in computing Respondents' filing deadline without regard\r\n  to Rule 6(e), SCRCP.\r\nAssuming, arguendo, that Rule 6(e), SCRCP, does apply to workers'\r\n  compensation procedure, the circuit court incorrectly applied Rule 6(e) in computing\r\n  the filing deadline for Respondents' Form 51.Â  The sole purpose of Rule 6(e) is\r\n  to compensate for the time that the notice, or other paper requiring a\r\n  response, is in the mail.Â  See Witzig v. Witzig, 325 S.C. 363, 366, 479 S.E.2d 297,&nbsp;299 (Ct.\r\n  App.&nbsp;1996)&nbsp;(citing James F. Flanagan, South\r\n  Carolina Civil Procedure 52 (2d ed. 1996)) (noting that the extra five\r\n  days provided by Rule 6(e) compensates for the time the notice or other paper is\r\n  in the mail).Â  Therefore, it is important to implement this purpose without\r\n  granting more of a time extension than was intended by the drafters of Rule 6(e).Â \r\n  This can be accomplished by counting out the total of five days plus the number\r\n  of the days in the prescribed periodâ€”here, thirty-five consecutive daysâ€”while including\r\n  intermediate weekend days and holidays in the computation. Â See Rule\r\n  6(a), SCRCP (providing that weekends and holidays are excluded only when\r\n  they fall at the end of the prescribed period or when the prescribed period is\r\n  less than seven days) (emphasis added).Â  However, allowing the addition of five\r\n  days after separately computing the prescribed period, so that holidays\r\n  and weekend days falling on day thirty are excluded from the computation, creates\r\n  a windfall to the respondent that could not have been intended by the drafters\r\n  of Rule 6(e).Â  This is what the circuit court did.Â  \r\nThe circuit court's application of Rule 6(e) allowed Respondents\r\n  to exclude a weekend day on two separate occasions&#9472;both before and\r\n    after adding the five days.Â  Given the explicit directions in Rule 6(a) for\r\n  including or excluding certain days in the computation of deadlines, it is\r\n  probable the rule would have explicitly directed the exclusion of weekend days both\r\n    before and after adding the five days under subsection (e) if the drafters\r\n  of the rule had intended such a result.Â  Cf. \r\nFour Video Slot Machines,\r\n  317 S.C. at 400, 453 S.E.2d at 898&nbsp;(holding that the meaning of general words in a statute may be restricted by words of\r\n  specification which precede them on the theory that, had the legislature\r\n  intended the general words be used in their unrestricted sense, there would\r\n  have been no mention of the particular class).Â \r\n  All told, under the circuit court's computation, Respondents were allowed a\r\n  total of thirty-nine days to respond, rather than thirty-five.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the due date for Respondents' Form 51 that would result from adding five days\r\n  to the prescribed period would be Friday, October 8.Â  The thirty-five day\r\n  period would begin on September 4 and would end on October 8, a weekday,\r\n  because October 3, an intermediate weekend day, must be included in the\r\n  computation.Â  See Rule 6(a), SCRCP (providing that weekends and holidays\r\n  are excluded only when they fall at the end of the prescribed period or\r\n  when the prescribed period is less than seven days) (emphasis added).Â  Again,\r\n  Respondents did not file their Form 51 until October 12, 2004.Â  \r\nUndoubtedly, Adams'\r\n  delay in filing her claim was egregious.Â  Hence, it is not\r\n  surprising that Respondents argue that the concept of fundamental fairness\r\n  should allow the application of Rule 6(e), SCRCP.[7]Â  However, the Commission and the\r\n  Legislature presumably took fairness into account when they clearly declined to\r\n  incorporate Rule 6(e) into the Commission's regulations.Â  This Court must apply\r\n  the law as it is written, and the strength of a defense on its merits certainly\r\n  cannot justify manipulating the plain language of the law to salvage the\r\n  defense when it is procedurally barred.Â  See \r\nShelton v. Greenville County, 194 S.C. 506, 512, 10 S.E.2d 12, 14&nbsp;(1940)&nbsp;(&quot;[O]ur\r\n  sole duty is to declare the law as it is written.&quot;).Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court's conclusion that\r\n  Respondents timely filed their Form 51 was incorrect.Â  Likewise, the circuit\r\n  court's conclusion that the Appellate Panel's decision was affected by an error\r\n  of law was improper.Â  Therefore, the circuit court should not have reversed the\r\n  Appellate Panel's decision.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 2008) (providing\r\n  that this Court may reverse an agency decision when the decision is affected by\r\n  an error of law);&nbsp;Hamilton, 336 S.C. at 76, 518 S.E.2d at 600-01 (interpreting\r\n  section 1-23-380). \r\nII.&nbsp; Waiver\r\n  of Affirmative Defenses\r\nAdams also argues that Respondents waived their affirmative defenses, including the\r\n  defenses of the statute of limitations and laches, because they failed to file\r\n  their Form 51 within the period set forth in 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  67-603.B(1) (Supp. 2008).Â  We agree.\r\nRegulation 67-603.C of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008)\r\n  provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tFailure\r\n  to file a Form 51 or Form 53 within the period in section B(1) shall be deemed\r\n  a general denial of liability for the benefits claimed and the employer and its\r\n  representative by the failure to respond within the period in section B(1) shall\r\n    forfeit each special and affirmative defense allowed by the Act including\r\n  the defenses available in Sections 42-9-60, 42-15-20, 42-15-40, and 42-17-90 of\r\n  the Act.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nThe words of a\r\n  statute or regulation &quot;must be given their plain and ordinary meaning\r\n  without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand its\r\n  operation.&quot; Â Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531,\r\n  563, 590 S.E.2d 338, 355&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2003).Â  The clear import of the\r\n  language of Regulation 67-603.C is this:Â  &quot;If\r\n  you are late in filing a Form 51 or Form 53, the only defense you have left is\r\n  a general denial of liability.&quot;Â  Therefore, Respondents' failure to timely\r\n  file their Form 51 resulted in their forfeiture of all defenses, other than the\r\n  general denial of liability, they would otherwise be allowed to assert in a\r\n  workers' compensation proceeding.Â  This result is consistent with the longstanding\r\n  view of our appellate courts that a defendant may waive the defense of the\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  See Mende v. Conway Hosp., Inc., 304 S.C. 313,\r\n  315, 404 S.E.2d 33, 34&nbsp;(1991)&nbsp;(holding that waiver of the statute\r\n  of limitations may result from any action or inaction\r\n  manifestly inconsistent with an intention to insist on the statute).Â  \r\nRespondents\r\n  argue that even if their filing of Form 51 was not timely, their laches defense\r\n  has not been forfeited under Regulation 67-603.C\r\n  because the regulation's forfeiture provision only applies to &quot;special and\r\n  affirmative defenses allowed by the Workers' Compensation Act&quot; and because\r\n  the Act does not specifically mention this equitable defense.[8]Â  However,\r\n  the unavoidable corollary of Respondents' argument is that the regulation's\r\n  forfeiture provision does not apply to laches because it is not allowed by the\r\n  Act.[9]Â  If the defense is not allowed under the Act, then that is the\r\n  end of our inquiry and the defense is simply unavailable in a proceeding before\r\n  the Commission.\r\nEven assuming, arguendo, that the defense of laches is allowed by\r\n  the Act, we arrive back where we startedâ€”all special and affirmative defenses\r\n  allowed by the Act are waived by the employer pursuant to Regulation 67-603.C when the employer fails to\r\n  timely file its Form 51.Â  \r\nIn sum, a special or affirmative defense is either allowed by the\r\n  Act or not allowed by the Act.Â  To infer that any special or affirmative defense\r\n  not mentioned in the Act is not allowed by the Act for purposes of the waiver\r\n  provision of Regulation 67-603.C, yet allowed by the Act for all other purposes\r\n  is analytically inconsistent and calls on this Court to supply additional terms\r\n  to the Act's provisions, an action that is not within this Court's authority.Â  See \r\nState v. White,\r\n  338 S.C. 56, 58, 525 S.E.2d 261, 263&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1999)&nbsp;(&quot;We,\r\n  of course, must take the statute as we find it, giving effect to the\r\n  legislative intent as expressed in its language. We cannot under our power of\r\n  construction supply an omission in the&nbsp; statute.&quot;); see also \r\nS.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mumford, 299\r\n  S.C. 14, 19, 382 S.E.2d 11, 14&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1989) (holding that once\r\n  the Legislature has made a choice, there is no room for the courts to impose a\r\n  different judgment based upon their own notions of public policy.).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court's\r\n  order is \r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\nPIEPER, J.,\r\n  dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nPIEPER, J.,\r\n  dissenting:\r\nI respectfully dissent.Â  This\r\n  case involves a workersâ€™ compensation claim filed more than twenty years after\r\n  the date of the accident.Â  Assuming, arguendo, the employer's Form 51 was\r\n  untimely, I do not believe that the doctrine of laches would be waived as the\r\n  waiver applies only to those â€œspecial and affirmative defenses allowed by the\r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-603(C) (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  Since the equitable doctrine of laches is not addressed by the Act, I would\r\n  find that it has not been waived.\r\nThe issue of laches has been\r\n  preserved by the respondents.Â  The single commissioner addressed laches as did\r\n  the Commission, although the circuit judge declined to address the issue in\r\n  light of her ruling in favor of the respondents.Â  Based upon a favorable lower\r\n  court ruling, the respondents were not required to return to the circuit court\r\n  and ask it to address all additional grounds that may sustain the decision,\r\n  particularly in light of the fact that those arguments were raised and\r\n  presented below.Â  See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338\r\n  S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000).\r\nHaving determined the issue\r\n  preserved for review, I would find error in the findings and conclusions of the\r\n  Commission.Â  The single commissioner found the doctrine of laches applicable.Â \r\n  The Commission found a waiver of laches under its own regulations and, as an\r\n  alternative, found the record only contained inadmissible evidence on the\r\n  issue.Â  As noted above, I would conclude that the Commission erred as a matter\r\n  of law in finding a waiver of laches under its regulations.Â  \r\nMoreover, as to its alternative\r\n  finding that the respondents had not presented any admissible evidence of\r\n  laches, I would hold that finding clearly erroneous.Â  &quot;Laches is an\r\n  equitable doctrine defined as neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained\r\n  length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do\r\n  what in law should have been done.&quot; Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC\r\n    v. Mallon, 381 S.C. 417, 432, 673 S.E.2d 448, 456&nbsp;(2009) (internal\r\n  quotations omitted).Â  In order to establish laches, a party must show that the complaining\r\n  party unreasonably delayed its assertion of a right, resulting in prejudice to\r\n  the party asserting laches.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn the case at bar, upon\r\n  cross-examination, the respondents established that claimant did not have an\r\n  excuse or explanation as to why she waited to file her claim.Â  Further, a\r\n  review of the record indicates the lack of any form of objection to the manner\r\n  in which counsel presented the additional elements of laches to the single\r\n  commissioner; therefore, in the absence of any such objection, the single\r\n  commissioner accepted the proffered evidence as to those elements.Â \r\n  Specifically, counsel indicated to the single commissioner that two witnesses\r\n  could not be found and noted the difficulty in evaluating this claim over\r\n  twenty years later.Â  Thus, I would hold the Commission committed an error of\r\n  law and that its factual findings in support thereof to be clearly erroneous.\r\nFinally, I do not agree with the\r\n  possible rejection of the application of laches to a workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  proceeding, nor, on a similar note, would I accept the rejection of other\r\n  equitable doctrines.Â  If the General Assembly had intended to omit the\r\n  application of equitable doctrines in its statutory enactment, it would have\r\n  done so.Â Â  Moreover, appellate jurisprudence in our state recognizes the\r\n  doctrine of laches in workers' compensation cases.Â  See, e.g., Richey\r\n    v. Dickenson, 359 S.C. 609, 612, 598 S.E.2d 307, 309 (Ct. App. 2004)\r\n  (&quot;This court has recognized the applicability of the doctrine of laches in\r\n  a workers' compensation claim.&quot;) (citations omitted).Â  Consequently,\r\n  equitable doctrines remain viable to address a situation where there is not an\r\n  adequate remedy at law.Â  See Roger Young and Stephen Spitz, Suemâ€”Spitz's\r\n    Ultimate Equitable Maxim: In Equity, Good Guys Should Win and Bad Guys Should\r\n    Lose, 55 S.C. L. Rev 175, 188 (Fall 2003) (the notion that equity does not\r\n  aid those who sleep on their rights is merely a summary of the well-known\r\n  equitable doctrine of laches).\r\nOn appeal, we may consider any\r\n  other sustaining grounds appearing in the record and may affirm on any of those\r\n  grounds.Â  I'On, 338 S.C. at 420, 526 S.E.2d at 723-24 (holding an\r\n  appellate court may affirm the lower court's judgment for any reason appearing\r\n  in the record on appeal).Â  Accordingly, I would affirm the circuit court's\r\n  dismissal of the case based upon the additional sustaining ground of laches.Â \r\n  Otherwise, because the single commissioner accepted the proffered information\r\n  at the hearing without objection, I would, at a minimum, remand for full\r\n  development of the record on the issue of laches since appellantâ€™s claim for\r\n  injuries has not been developed; the doctrine of laches should not be summarily\r\n  rejected at the outset of this proceeding.Â  Quite simply, equity cannot act\r\n  prematurely with a blind eye to all of the facts and circumstances that remain\r\n  to be developed on this workers' compensation claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Section\r\n  42-15-40 provides that the right to compensation is barred unless a claim is\r\n  filed with the Commission within two years after an accident.\r\n[2] Regulation\r\n  67-603.C states, \r\n\r\n\tFailure to file a Form 51 or\r\n  Form 53 within the period in section B(1) shall be deemed a general denial of\r\n  liability for the benefits claimed and the employer and its representative by\r\n  the failure to respond within the period in section B(1) shall forfeit each\r\n  special and affirmative defense allowed by the Act including the defenses\r\n  available in Sections 42-9-60, 42-15-20, 42-15-40, and 42-17-90 of the Act.\r\n\r\n[3] The circuit court\r\n  stated in its order that Wausau's Maitland office, the location where the\r\n  Commission sent Adams' Form 50, does not handle Westinghouse SRS claims, but that Wausau handles Westinghouse SRS claims at its office in Wausau, Wisconsin.Â  The order further states that Respondents did not receive the Form 50 until October 11, 2004.Â  However, nothing in the record indicates that Respondents accused the\r\n  Commission of using an invalid address to serve the Form 50 or that the circuit\r\n  court so concluded.Â  Notably, the burden is on the insurance carrier to provide\r\n  the Commission with the address for its authorized recipient of service.Â  See 25A S.C.

Thomas\r\n  Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2009-UP-402\r\nSubmitted April 1, 2009 â€“ Filed August 12, 2009\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn D. Delgado, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief\r\n  Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General\r\n  Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Michelle J. Parsons, Warren B.\r\n  Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this criminal\r\n  case from Richland County, Paul Watkins appeals his conviction for commission\r\n  of a lewd act on a minor under the age of sixteen and two counts of\r\n  contributing to the delinquency of a minor.Â  Specifically Watkins appeals; (1)\r\n  the trial court's admission of a photograph depicting the victim and her friend\r\n  posing in bikinis; and (2) the trial court's refusal to allow him to introduce evidence\r\n  that the victim's brother had been convicted of sexual misconduct with a minor\r\n  in Florida.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  the night of August 27, 2004, the victim (&quot;Victim&quot;) and her friend\r\n  (&quot;Friend&quot;) spent an evening at Watkins's home.Â  Victim and Friend,\r\n  both age thirteen at the time, played pool, used the computer, and soaked in\r\n  the hot tub, while Victim's mother, Watkins and Watkins's wife (&quot;Wife&quot;)\r\n  socialized. Â Victim and Friend allege that Watkins poured them both a\r\n  shot of &quot;Fireball&quot;[2] when they first arrived, which they drank.Â Â  Victim maintains that although\r\n  Watkins spent much of his time socializing with the adults, he on two or three\r\n  occasions again offered the girls more &quot;Fireball,&quot; which they\r\n  declined. \r\nLater\r\n  that evening, Victim noticed that Friend was lying on the staircase &quot;half\r\n  asleep.&quot;Â  Tired herself, Victim also decided to lie down on the\r\n  staircase.Â  Victim asserts that Watkins roused her and Friend, telling them\r\n  they could sleep in the guest bedroom if they were tired. Â Assenting,\r\n  the girls moved to the guest room, closed the door, changed clothes, and went\r\n  back to sleep. \r\nVictim\r\n  alleges that she awoke to find Watkins standing over her, kissing her neck and\r\n  cheek.Â  She testified he was whispering &quot;[s]hhh [i]t's okay,&quot; while\r\n  rubbing her body, buttocks, and vagina; and asking &quot;does it feel\r\n  good?&quot;Â  Victim claims she attempted to end the assault by stating\r\n  &quot;goodnight Uncle Paul&quot;[3] and rolling over. Â Unsuccessful, she reached for her cell phone on the\r\n  far nightstand, waking Friend in the process. Â Not realizing what was\r\n  happening, Friend got out of bed and walked toward the bathroom.Â  Victim\r\n  followed her, hoping to enter the bathroom with her, however Friend had closed\r\n  and locked the door behind her. Victim claims Watkins followed her to the\r\n  bathroom door continuing to rub and fondle her body while she waited for Friend\r\n  to come out of the bathroom. \r\nAs\r\n  soon as Friend emerged from the bathroom, Victim told her they needed to\r\n  leave.Â  The girls immediately returned to Victim's home; however, without a key\r\n  they had to rouse Victim's mother from a deep sleep by banging on her bedroom\r\n  window. Victim told her mother and Friend what happened, and called her father,\r\n  a member of the armed forces stationed in Tennessee. Neither Victim nor her\r\n  mother called the police; however, the Victim's father, from Tennessee,\r\n  contacted the authorities and had officers dispatched to Victim's home. \r\nWatkins\r\n  and Wife maintain that the girls were never invited to spend the night and,\r\n  rather, they asked the girls to leave after discovering them in the liquor\r\n  cabinet.Â  Claiming that Victim retorted &quot;I'll get you for this,&quot; it\r\n  is Watkins's position that Victim fabricated the allegations in an effort to\r\n  retaliate against him and avoid trouble for drinking.Â  \r\nThe intial trial of this matter ended in a mistrial when the jury failed to reach a\r\n  unanimous verdict.Â  The second trial took place March 12-16, 2007.Â  \r\nIn limine, Watkins moved the court to\r\n  suppress a photograph depicting Victim and Friend in bikinis taken two months\r\n  prior to the night of the incident.Â  Watkins also sought to introduce what he\r\n  deemed impeachment evidence that Victim's brother had been convicted in Florida\r\n  of sexual misconduct with a minor.Â  Victim's testimony was proffered and she\r\n  stated that she was aware of her brother's conviction and that this equipped\r\n  her with knowledge of the power and consequence of the accusations.Â  The trial\r\n  court ruled, in limine, that the photo and the evidence about the conviction\r\n  were irrelevant and prohibited reference to either in opening arguments. \r\nDuring the course of Victim's testimony,\r\n  while the State was attempting to lay the foundation for the photograph,\r\n  Watkins objected on the basis that the photo was irrelevant.Â  The court found\r\n  that the portion of the photo depicting Victim had nothing to do with this\r\n  case.Â  Then the court reasoned that the portion depicting Friend may establish\r\n  some fact in the case which would perhaps make it relevant.Â  However, the court\r\n  found that evidence had yet to establish the relevance of the portion of the\r\n  picture depicting Friend and therefore ruled the portion depicting Friend could\r\n  not be introduced through Victim.Â  \r\nLater, during the direct examination of\r\n  Friend, the State again sought to introduce the picture.Â  Watkins objected, both\r\n  on the relevancy of the photo and arguing it was not probative of anything.Â \r\n  The court again sustained the objection as to the portion of the photo\r\n  depicting Victim; however, it overruled the objection as to the portion\r\n  depicting Friend.Â  The trial court found that because the photo depicted the\r\n  actual bikini Friend wore on the night of the incident and there was evidence\r\n  that the bikini top was left at Watkins's home, the photo may be determinative\r\n  of some fact.Â  The photo was cut in two, and the portion depicting Friend was\r\n  admitted into evidence. \r\nFinally, during the State's cross-examination\r\n  of Wife, she testified that Victim generally wore &quot;two-piece&quot; bathing\r\n  suits, and the State apparently showed her the portion of the photo depicting\r\n  Victim in her bikini. Watkins objected, and the trial court held a bench\r\n  conference off the record.Â  When the proceedings resumed on the record, the photo\r\n  was introduced into evidence, with the trial court noting Watkins's objection.Â  The basis for\r\n  the objection is not on the record.Â  At the end of Wife's testimony, when the\r\n  trial court asked if Watkins had anything he wished to put in the record, he\r\n  responded in the negative.Â  \r\nWatkins\r\n  was convicted and this appeal follows.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid\r\n  the trial court err in admitting the photo of the two thirteen (13) year old\r\n  girls?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid\r\n  the trial court err in refusing to allow Watkins to introduce evidence that\r\n  Victim's brother had previously been convicted in Florida of sexual misconduct\r\n  with a minor?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court\r\n  sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48,\r\n  625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  Thus, an appellate court is bound by the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The admission of evidence is in the sound discretion of the trial court, and\r\n  its decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v.\r\n    Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006); State v. Gaster,\r\n  340 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nWatkins first\r\n  alleges that the trial court committed reversible error by admitting the\r\n  picture of Victim and Friend. Â We disagree.\r\nRelevant evidence, is evidence\r\n  &quot;having any tendency to make[] the existence of any fact that is of\r\n  consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it\r\n  would be without the evidence.&quot;Â  Rule 401, SCRE; State v. Alexander,\r\n  303 S.C. 377, 380, 401 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1991).Â  However, not all relevant\r\n  evidence is admissible.Â  See Rule 403, SCRE (stating that &quot;relevant\r\n  evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by\r\n  the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury&quot;).Â \r\n  In order to reverse the trial court's admission of evidence we must find (1) an\r\n  abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge; and (2) likely prejudice. State\r\n    v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475, 478&nbsp;(2004). Â Â Â \r\nGenerally, a photo may be relevant if it\r\n  corroborates testimony of a witness. See State v. Weik, 356 S.C.\r\n  76, 84, 587 S.E.2d 683, 687 (2002) (finding photos depicting the location and\r\n  severity of shotgun wounds relevant as illustrative of testimony received as to\r\n  the same); State v. Martucci, 380 S.C. 232, 250, 669, S.E.2d 598, 608\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008) (finding photos to be relevant in a prosecution for child abuse\r\n  because the photos corroborated the testimony of a doctor as to severity of the\r\n  child's injuries based on discolorations, bruising, and internal trauma).Â \r\n  However, although relevant to corroborate testimony, as a matter of course, the\r\n  photos must depict that which was testified to, as well as be demonstrative of\r\n  a fact of consequence.Â  See also Rule 401, SCRE (establishing that relevant\r\n  evidence, is evidence &quot;having any tendency to make[] the existence of any\r\n  fact that is of consequence . . . more or less probable&quot;).Â Â  \r\na.&nbsp; Photo of Friend\r\nThe trial court based its finding of\r\n  relevance as to the photo of Friend on the fact that Friend testified to having\r\n  worn that particular flower print bikini on the night of the incident, and\r\n  after changing and falling asleep at Watkins's home, she apparently left the\r\n  bikini top there and never returned to retrieve it.Â  The trial court seemed to\r\n  accept the State's argument that the photo was relevant as corroborating\r\n  Friend's account that the bikini top was in fact left at Watkins's home, thusâ€”somehowâ€”making\r\n  it more probable that the girls spent the night at Watkins's home, rather than\r\n  having been asked to leave as the Watkins contends.Â  \r\nHere, the photo of Friend corroborates\r\n  her testimony only as to the fact that she owned a flower print bikini.Â  The\r\n  photo however, in no way makes it more or less probable that Friend left her\r\n  bikini top at Watkins's house or spent the night there.Â  Nor can it logically\r\n  be deemed to corroborate her testimony as to the same.Â  \r\nMoreover, the picture, which was taken\r\n  some two months prior, does not actually support Friend's testimony that she\r\n  donned that particular bikini that night.Â  While the photo, in the loosest\r\n  sense, corroborates her testimony as to what she looked like on that particular\r\n  night, no facts were developed in this case to demonstrate it was of any\r\n  consequence what particular bikini she wore on that night or how she appeared\r\n  in it. See Rule 401 (defining relevant evidence as â€œevidence having any\r\n  tendency to make[] the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the\r\n  determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the\r\n  evidenceâ€).Â  Accordingly, because the photo did not corroborate Friend's\r\n  testimony, and was not probative of any fact of consequence in the case, it\r\n  should not have been admitted over Watkins's objection.Â  \r\nb.&nbsp; Photo of Victim\r\nSimilarly, we agree with Watkins that\r\n  the portion of the photo depicting Victim was also irrelevant.Â  \r\nDuring the course of cross-examining Wife,\r\n  the State presented the photo to her in what it deems an effort to refresh her\r\n  memory.Â  Watkins objected, at which time a conference was held off the record.Â \r\n  When the record resumes, the photo is immediately entered into evidence\r\n  &quot;over [Watkins's] objection.&quot;Â  Watkins put nothing further in the\r\n  record.\r\nReviewing the record as a whole, it\r\n  would seem the objection was again based on relevance.Â  Although the court made\r\n  no specific statement as to the relevance of the photo on this occasion, it\r\n  apparently found something had changed to make the photo relevant.Â  However, as\r\n  we stated, to whatever extent this photo was deemed relevant it was error.Â  It\r\n  did not make any fact of consequence more or less probable, nor did it serve to\r\n  corroborate or depict any testimony.Â  While the State seems to suggest that the\r\n  photo was admissible because it used the photo to refresh Wife's memory, this\r\n  argument is unsupported by law. See Rule 612, SCRE (stating that a\r\n  writing used to refresh memory may be introduced into evidence by an adverse party in the trial court's discretion, as necessary to serve the interest of\r\n  justice) (emphasis added).\r\nc.&nbsp; Prejudice\r\nNotwithstanding the irrelevance of the\r\n  photo[4] depicting\r\n  Victim and Friend, this Court will not reverse a trial court's admission of\r\n  evidence absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion. State v. Douglas, 367\r\n  S.C. 498, 508, 629 S.E.2d 59, 64 (Ct. App. 2006) (stating that in order to\r\n  warrant reversal of the trial court based on admission of evidence, there must\r\n  be both an abuse of discretion as well as a demonstration of prejudice).Â  In\r\n  order to show prejudice, the court must find there was a reasonable probability\r\n  that the jury's verdict was influenced by the evidence. Fields v. Reg'l Med.\r\n    Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005); Douglas,\r\n  367 S.C. at 508, 629 S.E.2d at 64.Â  As it pertains more specifically to\r\n  photographs, to amount to unfair prejudice, the photographs must create an\r\n  &quot;undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Jackson, 364 S.C. 329, 334, 613 S.E.2d, 374, 376 (2005) (citing State\r\n      v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991)) (internal\r\n  quotations omitted).\r\nIn this case, Watkins has not\r\n  demonstrated how he was prejudiced by the photograph, nor do we find it manifestly\r\n  prejudicial.Â  The challenged photo is that of two teen-aged girls in bathing\r\n  suits, leaning against a wall.Â  It is an admittedly accurate depiction of how\r\n  the girls often appeared that summer.Â  Although notably bearing little\r\n  relevance to the particular issues of this case, it is not the type of photo to\r\n  inflame the passions of the jury.Â  It is mundane and platonic; the girls are\r\n  not posed provocatively or suggestively.Â  It would not seem reasonable to\r\n  conclude that this picture influenced the decision of the jury.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  although irrelevant, the trial court's admission of the photograph does not\r\n  amount to a prejudicial abuse of discretion and we therefore do not find\r\n  reversible error.\r\nII.\r\nNext Watkins argues that it was error to\r\n  deny the admission of evidence that Victim's brother had been convicted in\r\n  Florida of sexual misconduct with a minor.Â  We disagree.\r\nWatkins argues the evidence was relevant\r\n  impeachment evidence as it tended to show Victim's special knowledge of the\r\n  &quot;stigma&quot; and &quot;power&quot; of the allegations and thus was\r\n  demonstrative of her motive to manufacture these allegations.Â  Watkins argues\r\n  that the evidence was specifically admissible under Rule 608(c), SCRE, and the\r\n  trial court therefore erred in analyzing the admissibility of the evidence\r\n  under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\nInitially we note that the trial court\r\n  found the evidence of the conviction &quot;neither . . . relevant or probative\r\n  of anything.&quot;Â  The record does not indicate that the trial court excluded\r\n  the evidence under Rule 403, but rather simply found it irrelevant pursuant to\r\n  Rule 401.Â  Further, Watkins seems to tangle two different arguments by seeking\r\n  to admit the conviction as impeachment evidence.Â  While Rule 608(c) does permit\r\n  evidence of bias, prejudice, or any motive to misrepresent, to impeach a\r\n  witness, Watkins's argument that Victim's knowledge of her brother's conviction\r\n  demonstrates motive is unfounded.Â  Rather, if there were any motive, that\r\n  motive would be the alleged personal vendetta.Â  Although the brother's conviction\r\n  may have demonstrated knowledge of this type of accusation, the fact that her\r\n  brother was convicted of sexual misconduct is not the driving force for making\r\n  the allegations.Â  \r\nDuring the proffer of Victim's testimony\r\n  she admitted knowledge of her brother's conviction as well as knowledge of the\r\n  power and stigma of the accusations; thus, evidence or inquiry of the\r\n  conviction was not necessary to impeach her.Â  Accordingly, as the conviction\r\n  was not permissible impeachment evidence it was within the trial court's\r\n  discretion to determine the relevance of the evidence, and we find no error in\r\n  the trial court finding the conviction to be irrelevant.Â  Moreover, we note\r\n  that the trial court's decision to exclude evidence of the conviction did not\r\n  prevent Watkins from inquiring whether the Victim was aware of the nature and\r\n  power of her accusations.Â  As such, the trial court did not err in excluding\r\n  evidence of the brother's conviction or inquiry thereon.Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause\r\n  the trial court's admission of the photo did not amount to prejudicial error\r\n  and Watkins was not deprived of the opportunity to inquire whether Victim appreciated\r\n  the power and stigma of her accusations, the ruling of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSHORT, THOMAS and GEATHERS JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We\r\n  decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n[2]&nbsp; Fireball is a\r\n  cinnamon flavored, sixty-six proof liqueur.Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; Watkins\r\n  is not Victim's actual uncle, but due to their families' close friendship she\r\n  called Watkins and his wife &quot;Uncle&quot; and &quot;Aunt&quot;\r\n  respectively.Â  \r\n[4]&nbsp; Although\r\n  the trial court admitted the two portions of the original photograph as two\r\n  separate photos, for ease of discussion we now address the two photographs\r\n  collectively, in its original state, as a single photograph depicting both\r\n  Victim and Friend.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-403","title":"SCDOT v.
