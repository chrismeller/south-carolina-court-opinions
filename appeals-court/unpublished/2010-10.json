Henshaw, Jr., both of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant\r\n\t\t\t\tAshby W. Davis, , Steven A. Snyder, David L. Williford, Collie W.\r\n  Lehn, Jr., all of Greenville, Edward G. Smith and H. Spencer King ,both of\r\n  Spartanburg, Robert H. Hood and Mary Agnes Craig, both of Charleston for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this medical malpractice case, the estate of Gene Edward\r\n  Cartee Sr., (Cartee) appeals the special referee's grant of summary judgment in\r\n  favor of multiple respondents.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 19, 2002, Gene Edward Cartee\r\n  Sr. (Cartee) arrived at the emergency department of Piedmont Medical Center of\r\n  Rock Hill, suffering from rectal bleeding.Â  He was admitted under the care of\r\n  internist Maria Redmond, M.D., an employee of Metrolina Medical Assoc., P.A.Â  Redmond\r\n  consulted gastroenterologist Larry Pennington, M.D. who conducted a colonoscopy\r\n  on December 20, discovering two cancerous masses in Cartee's large intestine.Â \r\n  Because one of masses appeared to completely block the intestine, Redmon and\r\n  Pennington consulted general surgeon David Mark Countryman, M.D.Â  After\r\n  examination and review of Cartee's medical history, Countryman recommended an\r\n  abdominal colectomy because of active colon bleeding and because one of the\r\n  cancerous masses threatened to completely block the colon, both conditions\r\n  Countryman opined were life-threatening. Â Accordingly, the surgery was\r\n  scheduled for December 23.\r\nOn\r\n  December 21, Rajesh Hari Kedar, M.D. took over the internal medicine aspects of\r\n  Cartee's care from Redmond and conducted a review of Cartee's pre-op EKG, and\r\n  lab results.Â  Kedar stated that because Cartee indicated he had no chest pains,\r\n  shortness of breath, chest pressure, or symptoms of angina, he did not\r\n  recommend a pre-op cardiac stress test.Â  The following day, December 22,\r\n  Richard Tarvers, M.D. conducted a pre-op anesthesia evaluation.Â  Then again, on\r\n  the morning of surgery, Tarvers's partner Dr. Mingus evaluated Cartee and served\r\n  as the anesthesiologist for the colectomy.Â  Neither Kedar, Countryman, Mingus,\r\n  Redmon or Tarvers indicated Cartee needed further cardiac work-ups or testing\r\n  prior to surgery, or voiced any concern to warrant postponing the surgery.Â  On\r\n  December 23, Countryman successfully removed nearly all of Cartee's colon. \r\nOn\r\n  December 26, Cartee developed atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and as\r\n  a result cardiologist Nathaniel Edwards, M.D., was consulted to treat the\r\n  condition. Â On the evening of December 29, Cartee suffered a heart\r\n  attack.Â  The following morning, Cartee apparently had either a second heart\r\n  attack or a continuation of the same &quot;coronary event&quot; which caused\r\n  the first heart attack.Â  As a result of this &quot;coronary event,&quot; Harry\r\n  E. Hicklin, III, M.D. conducted an emergent catheterization by performing a balloon\r\n  angioplasty on the anterior descending artery and inserting a stent. Â On\r\n  January 3, 2003, Dr. Edwards performed a second catheterization, placing a stent\r\n  in the circumflex.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  January 7, 2003, Cartee died of severe coronary artery disease.Â  Corrie Cartee,\r\n  the personal representative of Cartee's estate brought this medical malpractice\r\n  claim against seven doctors involved in Cartee's care and their respective\r\n  professional associations.Â  On July 11, 2008, the trial court entered an order\r\n  granting summary judgment in favor of Countryman and his professional\r\n  association Piedmont Surgical Associates.Â  Subsequently, on August 14, 2008,\r\n  the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of Kedar and Mingus as well.Â \r\n  Cartee now appeals the trial court's grant of summary judgment as to\r\n  Countryman, Kedar, Mingus, and their respective professional associations.Â  On\r\n  December 29, 2008, this court granted a motion to consolidate the appeals.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court err in granting\r\n  summary judgment because Cartee did not create a genuine issue of material fact\r\n  as to whether the respondents deviated from the generally recognized standard\r\n  of care and caused Cartee's injury and death?[1]Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is a drastic remedy,\r\n  &quot;[t]he purpose of [which] is to expedite the disposition of cases which do\r\n  not require the services of a fact finder.&quot;Â  Singleton v. Sherer,\r\n  377 S.C. 185, 198, 659, S.E.2d 196, 205 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP\r\n  provides that summary judgment is proper when: &quot;the pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  On appeal, an appellate court applies the same standard as the\r\n  trial court under Rule 56(c), and likewise must view the evidence and all\r\n  inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Fleming\r\n    v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn order to establish a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact sufficient to overcome summary judgment a plaintiff in a medical\r\n  malpractice case must provide evidence of (1) a generally recognized and\r\n  accepted standard of care, and (2) a departure from that standard by the\r\n  defendant. Â David v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 1, 4 (2006).Â  In this regard, a plaintiff &quot;must provide expert\r\n  testimony to establish both the required standard of care and the defendant['s]\r\n  failure to conform to that standard[] . . . .&quot;Â  Id. at 248, 626\r\n  S.E.2d at 4.Â  However, to overcome summary judgment, the non-moving party need\r\n  only present a scintilla of evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact.Â  Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Tolbert, 387 S.C. 280, 283, 692 S.E.2d 523, 524\r\n  (2010); Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673\r\n  S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).Â  \r\nIn this case, Cartee avers, as to each\r\n  respondent, the trial court erred in (1) finding no genuine issue of material\r\n  fact as to a recognized standard of care, (2) finding no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact tending to establishing a deviation from that standard of care,\r\n  and (3) finding Cartee's expert, Vasquez, did not testify as to proximate cause\r\n  with the requisite degree of certainty.\r\nUpon\r\n  review of the record, pleadings, affidavits, and Vasquez's deposition, we\r\n  believe Cartee presented a scintilla of evidence sufficient to withstand\r\n  summary judgment.Â  As to the first element, Vasquez's deposition and affidavit opined\r\n  that the appropriate standard of care is one common to all physicians and\r\n  required the respondents to conduct further evaluation and testing of Cartee's\r\n  cardiac functionality.Â  Whether this standard is appropriate under the\r\n  circumstances, or whether some other standard is imposed by virtue of being a\r\n  specialist in a particular field is an issue of fact.Â  \r\nSimilarly,\r\n  Vasquez's affidavit and deposition present a scintilla of evidence that the\r\n  respondents deviated from the standard of care by failing to consider or notice\r\n  certain &quot;risk factors&quot; and make further inquiry into Cartee's cardiac\r\n  condition.Â  Whether these factors were known to the respondents at the time, or\r\n  whether each doctor's failure to consult a cardiologist or investigate further\r\n  amounts to a deviation from Vasquez's alleged standard of care are issues of\r\n  fact.\r\nFinally, as to the issue of proximate cause,\r\n  Vasquez's affidavit states that in his opinion Cartee's death &quot;most\r\n  probably could have been prevented, had [he] received . . . treatment meeting\r\n  the standard of care.&quot;&nbsp; Further, Vasquez opined that certain risk\r\n  factors should have provided sufficient indication of the need for the pre-op\r\n  cardiac evaluation, which would have ultimately led to a different course of\r\n  treatment and/or action.&nbsp; We find that in the light most favorable to\r\n  Cartee, this suffices as a mere scintilla of evidence sufficient to withstand\r\n  summary judgment.&nbsp; We recognize the depositions of the attending\r\n  cardiologists diverge from Vasquez's testimony as to what tests would have been\r\n  conducted and how the course of treatment would or would not have altered had\r\n  the request for a cardiac evaluation been made; however, Cartee is only\r\n  required to present a scintilla of evidence to survive the motion.&nbsp;\r\n  Accordingly, we hold the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the reasons stated above, the ruling of the trial court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nFEW, C.J., THOMAS and PIEPER JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We note Cartee\r\n  also makes the following arguments pertaining specifically to respondent\r\n  Mingus: Â (1) Did the trial court erroneously base its grant of summary judgment\r\n  on a ground not raised by the defendant's motion? (2) Did the trial court err\r\n  in granting summary judgment on the grounds that Cartee's expert did not\r\n  testify on the issue of proximate cause with the requisite certainty? (3) Did\r\n  the trial court err in holding Cartee's expert testimony was not sufficient to\r\n  establish a standard of care by an anesthesiologist to ask for a pre-surgical\r\n  heart evaluation?Â  However, in light of our disposition, we need not address\r\n  these issues.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-426","title":"State v.

light, and two counts of assault and battery of a\r\n    high and aggravated nature and was sentenced to concurrent terms of ten years\r\n    on the assault charges, three years for the failure to stop, and life without\r\n    parole for the armed robbery.Â  Portee appeals, asserting the trial judge\r\n    erred in denying his motion for directed verdict on the armed robbery charge\r\n    based upon the insufficiency of evidence of the presence of a deadly weapon or\r\n    a representation of a deadly weapon.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nOn\r\n  November 9, 2006, Family Dollar Store manager Tracey Anderson arrived at work\r\n  between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m. to prepare the business for opening.Â  Around 8:00,\r\n  she heard a loud noise that drew her attention to a man who appeared to be\r\n  looking at the door for the store's hours of operation.Â  The man returned to\r\n  his vehicle and left.Â  Tracey testified the man was a skinny, light-skinned\r\n  African-American and she noticed the front end of an older, white, four-door\r\n  car.Â  By the time of the store opening at 9:00, employees Erica Wilson and Lisa\r\n  Ellis had arrived.Â  Shortly thereafter, while Tracey and Erica were in the\r\n  stockroom, a man entered the area from the store's back door.Â  Tracey testified\r\n  the man was very tall and he wore a knit hat over his face with the eyes cut\r\n  out of it, and he had on a yellow coat.Â  The man pulled Tracey and Erica by the\r\n  hair and moved them out of the stockroom and then forced them to the floor.Â \r\n  The man told Tracey she needed to give him the money.Â  Erica became hysterical\r\n  and started screaming, at which time the man threatened to kill the women if\r\n  they did not do as he said.Â  While the man used one hand to hold Tracey by her\r\n  hair, she noticed a bulge in the right pocket of his yellow jacket, and she saw\r\n  he had his other hand positioned &quot;into his clothes.&quot;Â  At that point,\r\n  having been threatened, Tracey believed the man was armed.Â Â  Erica was left on\r\n  the floor, while the man nudged Tracey toward the front of the store, pulling\r\n  her hair.Â  As they approached the front, Tracey saw Lisa and one of their\r\n  regular customers, Joan Hooks.Â  The man instructed Joan to come with him and\r\n  Tracey and led them to the cash registers.Â  Tracey bagged all the money from\r\n  one of the registers and gave it to the man, who then ran out the back door.Â \r\n  During this time, she was able to observe the man wore gray sweatpants and\r\n  white, scuffed shoes.Â  Shortly thereafter, Michael Murphy, a minister with the\r\n  church beside the store, came in and asked if they had been robbed.Â  When\r\n  Tracey told him they had, Michael ran to the back after the man, at which time\r\n  he identified the car and stated the robber had pulled a pistol on him.Â  Tracey\r\n  stated the man who robbed them had the same build as the person she had\r\n  observed at 8:00 that morning. \r\nSometime\r\n  after the police arrived at the store, Tracey was taken to another location\r\n  where she observed Portee, and identified him immediately as the person she had\r\n  seen at the store at 8:00 that morning and the person who committed the robbery\r\n  of the store around 9:00 or 9:15.Â  She recognized his face from the 8:00 a.m.\r\n  encounter, and the pants and shoes he was wearing from the robbery.Â  She also\r\n  testified a white car located near the suspect when she identified him was the\r\n  same car she had seen earlier that morning in the parking lot.Â  Additionally,\r\n  she identified a yellow jacket Portee dropped while running from the police as\r\n  the jacket worn by the robber that day.Â  She also made an in-court\r\n  identification of Portee.Â  \r\nCustomer\r\n  Joan Hooks testified she was in the store on November 9, 2006 when she heard a\r\n  loud ruckus in the back.Â  She then saw Tracey being held by the person robbing\r\n  the store, who walked Tracey up to the front of the store by her hair.Â  The man\r\n  yelled something to her and she walked up to the front with them.Â  Joan stated\r\n  she was &quot;not sure what type of weapon he had, but he was walking . . .\r\n  [Tracey] up towards . . . the cash register.&quot;Â  The man used one hand to\r\n  grab Tracey's hair and had the other hand inside his jogging pants, &quot;like\r\n  he had something in his pants.&quot;Â  The man asked Tracey to give him money\r\n  out of the register and she complied.Â  After he obtained the money, the man ran\r\n  out the back of the store.Â  The minister came in from the church next door and\r\n  ran through the store following the robber.Â  The minister then described seeing\r\n  the white car in the back of the store.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  authorities were called and Deputy Kilcoyne responded to the scene.Â  After\r\n  obtaining a description of the man, his clothing and the vehicle from the\r\n  witnesses, Deputy Kilcoyne radioed in the information.Â  Kilcoyne testified\r\n  Tracey advised him the man &quot;had his hand in his pocket pointing it at her\r\n  to indicate that he would have a weapon,&quot; and &quot;she assumed he had a\r\n  weapon.&quot; \r\nInvestigator\r\n  Unger testified he was on patrol in the area with a trainee at the time of the\r\n  dispatch for an armed robbery.Â  He observed a car fitting the description being\r\n  driven by a man and initiated a traffic stop, which turned into a high speed\r\n  chase.Â  During the car pursuit, Unger observed the occupant throw something out\r\n  of the car, and then noticed him fumbling around and picking up a yellow piece\r\n  of clothing, later identified as a yellow jacket.Â  The driver eventually lost\r\n  control of the vehicle and ran from the car.Â  As he jumped from the automobile,\r\n  the man had two black items and a yellow item that were subsequently identified\r\n  as a black mask, a black sock, and a yellow rain jacket.Â  After a foot chase,\r\n  the officers apprehended the man.\r\nThe\r\n  man dropped the yellow jacket while he was running.Â  Inside the vehicle,\r\n  officers found rolled money and the black handle of a hacksaw.Â  In the right\r\n  front pocket of the yellow rain jacket, officers found a blue cobalt utility\r\n  knife.Â  Also collected was a black mask with eye holes.Â  Testing revealed DNA\r\n  obtained from the mask matched that of Portee.Â  A sergeant in the armed robbery\r\n  division of the Richland County Sheriff's Department testified he deemed the\r\n  broken-off hacksaw handle to be an item fashioned to look like a firearm, and\r\n  that such items are often used by persons who do not have access to a real\r\n  firearm.Â  He stated any person in fear would think the hacksaw handle was a\r\n  firearm and that the item inside a pocket of clothing would create a bulge.\r\nAt\r\n  the close of the State's case, Portee moved for a directed verdict arguing, as\r\n  to the armed robbery, the State failed to produce sufficient evidence the\r\n  robber was armed or alleged to be armed.Â  The trial judge determined there was\r\n  sufficient evidence from which the jury could determine the perpetrator was\r\n  armed or a person could reasonably believe based on the threat that the\r\n  perpetrator was armed with a deadly weapon or a representation of a deadly weapon.Â \r\n  He therefore denied the directed verdict motion as to armed robbery, but found\r\n  it was an issue for the jury based upon the evidence presented. Â He thereafter\r\n  charged the lesser-included offense of robbery.\r\nISSUE\r\nWhether\r\n  the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion for directed verdict of the\r\n  armed robbery charge because there was insufficient proof on the element of\r\n  whether there was a deadly weapon present, or a representation of a deadly\r\n  weapon present, in this case.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;A\r\n  defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to present\r\n  evidence of the offense charged.&quot; Â State v. Heath, 370 S.C. 326,\r\n  329, 635 S.E.2d 18, 19 (2006).Â  When ruling on a motion for directed verdict,\r\n  the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence,\r\n  not its weight.Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648\r\n  (2006).Â  When reviewing the denial of a directed verdict, the appellate court\r\n  views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to\r\n  the state.Â  Id.Â  An appellate court may only reverse the trial court's\r\n  denial of a directed verdict motion if there is no evidence to support the\r\n  trial court's ruling.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d\r\n  87, 92 (2002).Â  If there is any direct evidence or any substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused,\r\n  this court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Portee contends the appearance\r\n  of a bulge did not represent a deadly weapon, and there was no corroborative\r\n  evidence accompanying the threat to kill that would show there was a gun in\r\n  existence, or a representation of a gun in existence, during the robbery.Â  He\r\n  therefore contends there was insufficient evidence on the deadly weapon element\r\n  such that he was entitled to a directed verdict on the armed robbery charge. Â Â We\r\n  disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  16-11-330(A) of the South Carolina Code provides in pertinent part as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  person who commits robbery while armed with a pistol, dirk, slingshot, metal\r\n  knuckles, razor, or other deadly weapon, or while alleging, either by action or\r\n  words, he was armed while using a representation of a deadly weapon or any\r\n  object which a person present during the commission of the robbery reasonably\r\n  believed to be a deadly weapon, is guilty of a felony. . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A)\r\n  (2003).Â  Under this section:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  State may prove armed robbery by establishing the commission of a robbery and\r\n  either one of two additional elements: Â (1) that the robber was armed with a\r\n  deadly weapon or (2) that the robber alleged he was armed with a deadly weapon,\r\n  either by action or words, while using a representation of a deadly weapon or\r\n  any object which a person present during the commission of the robbery\r\n  reasonably believed to be a deadly weapon.Â  \r\n\r\nState v. Muldrow, 348 S.C. 264, 267-68, 559 S.E.2d 847, 849 (2002).Â \r\n  Under the first prong, the presence of a weapon may be inferred from\r\n  circumstantial evidence.Â  Id. at 268, 559 S.E.2d at 849.Â  The display of a deadly weapon is not an essential element\r\n  of the offense.Â  State v. Jones, 342 S.C. 248, 252, 536 S.E.2d 396, 398\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) (citing State v. Nix, 288 S.C. 492, 497 n.2, 343 S.E.2d\r\n  627, 630 n.2 (Ct. App. 1986)).Â  However, words alone are not sufficient\r\n  under either the first prong or the second prong of the statute, and a threat\r\n  to kill one, in and of itself, is insufficient to establish the element of a\r\n  deadly weapon.Â  Muldrow, 348 S.C. at 268-69, 559 S.E.2d at 849-50; State\r\n    v. Dodd, 354 S.C. 13, 17-18, 579 S.E.2d 331, 333-34 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nIt\r\n  is the use or alleged use of a deadly weapon that distinguishes armed robbery\r\n  from robbery.Â  State v. Moore, 374 S.C. 468, 477, 649 S.E.2d 84, 88 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007).Â  A defendant may be convicted of armed\r\n  robbery under the statute if the jury concludes that the robber alleged that he\r\n  was armed under the requisite circumstances without having to conclude that he\r\n  was, in fact, so armed. Â Jones, 342 S.C. at 253, 536 S.E.2d at 398.\r\nWe\r\n  find there is sufficient evidence under both prongs of Â§ 16-11-330(A) such that\r\n  the trial judge properly denied Portee's motion for directed verdict.Â  While\r\n  Portee is correct in asserting that words alone are insufficient to establish\r\n  the element of a deadly weapon, there is evidence that Portee actually\r\n  possessed a deadly weapon during the robbery, as well as evidence that Portee\r\n  alleged, by action or words, he was armed &quot;while using a representation of\r\n  a deadly weapon or any object which a person present during the commission of\r\n  the robbery reasonably believed to be a deadly weapon.&quot;Â  See Â§16-11-330(A).\r\nUnder\r\n  the first prong, the display of a deadly weapon is\r\n  not an essential element of the offense.Â  Jones, 342 S.C. at 252, 536\r\n  S.E.2d at 398.Â Further, under this prong the presence of a weapon may\r\n  be inferred from circumstantial evidence.Â  Muldrow, 348 S.C. at 268, 559\r\n  S.E.2d at 849. Â Here, the evidence shows that Portee\r\n  threatened to kill the victims during the robbery and that the yellow\r\n  raincoat identified by the victims as being worn by Portee, which he threw to\r\n  the ground while running from the police, contained a utility knife, which\r\n  constitutes a deadly weapon, in the right pocket.Â  Additionally, there is\r\n  evidence Portee used a gun during the robbery, as the minister who ran after\r\n  Portee following the incident inside the store stated the man pulled a pistol\r\n  on him.Â  Because there is evidence Portee used a deadly weapon during his\r\n  attempt to escape, there is evidence he committed armed robbery.Â  See State\r\n    v. Mitchell, 382 S.C. 1, 5, 675 S.E.2d 435, 437-38 (2009) (holding, &quot;when\r\n  a defendant commits robbery without a deadly weapon, but becomes armed with a\r\n  deadly weapon before asportation of the victim's property, a conviction for\r\n  armed robbery will stand,&quot; for &quot;the crime of robbery is not completed\r\n  the moment the stolen property is in the possession of the robbers, but may be\r\n  deemed to continue during their attempt to escape&quot;); Moore, 374\r\n  S.C. at 482-83, 649 S.E.2d at 91Â  (holding, when one commits a larceny and then\r\n  displays a weapon so as to overcome the resistance of the witness, the crime is\r\n  then elevated to armed robbery).Â  Accordingly, there is substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence Portee was actually armed at the time of the robbery.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  there is evidence Portee alleged he was armed with a deadly weapon, by his\r\n  action or words, while using a representation of a deadly weapon or an object\r\n  which the victims could have reasonably believed to be a deadly weapon.Â  Portee\r\n  threatened to kill the victims.Â  Tracey testified, during this time, she\r\n  noticed a bulge in the right pocket of the man's yellow jacket while he used\r\n  one hand to hold her by her hair and he positioned the other hand into his\r\n  clothes.Â  At that point, having been threatened, Tracey believed the man was\r\n  armed.Â  This testimony was further corroborated by Joan, who testified she was\r\n  not sure what type of weapon he had, but he walked Tracey up toward the\r\n  register, using one hand to grab Tracey's hair and keeping the other hand\r\n  inside his pants, &quot;like he had something in his pants.&quot;Â  Further, the\r\n  State presented evidence from an investigating officer that he believed the\r\n  hacksaw handle recovered from Portee's car was used by Portee to resemble a\r\n  firearm, that any person in fear would think the hacksaw handle was a firearm,\r\n  and that the item inside a pocket of clothing would create a bulge.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the State presented substantial circumstantial evidence Portee alleged he was\r\n  armed with a deadly weapon while using a representation of a deadly weapon or\r\n  an object which the victims could have reasonably believed to be a deadly\r\n  weapon.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find the\r\n  trial judge properly denied Portee's motion for directed verdict on the armed\r\n  robbery charge.Â  His convictions are therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.

Hiser, all of\r\n          Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this foreclosure action, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., (Wells Fargo) challenges\r\n  findings by the master-in-equity that (1) a purported assignment of its\r\n  first-priority mortgage lien on the subject property was valid and enforceable\r\n  and (2) the lien was capped at $12,531.Â  We\r\n  remand this matter to the master for further proceedings.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  December 17, 1999, Nathaniel Brunson, Jr., executed a promissory note to First\r\n  Union Mortgage Corporation (FUMC) for $67,000, plus yearly interest of 9.75\r\n  percent.Â  &quot;FUMC Loan No. 8784100&quot; appeared on the face of the\r\n  document. Â Brunson also executed a mortgage on property located in Richland\r\n  County to secure the note. Â The mortgage was a first-priority lien on the\r\n  subject property and was recorded on December 23, 1999, in deed book 371 at\r\n  page 560.Â  On October 29, 2001, FUMC assigned the note and mortgage to Wells\r\n  Fargo for valuable consideration.Â  The assignment was recorded on November 26,\r\n  2001, in deed book 593 at page 1293.[1]Â  \r\nBrunson purportedly\r\n  executed another promissory note on December 17, 1999, the same date that he\r\n  executed the FUMC note and mortgage.Â  This note was in favor of GTI Investments\r\n  (GTI) for a credit line of $67,000, plus yearly interest of six percent.Â  &quot;GTI\r\n  Loan No. 2572881&quot; appeared on the face of the document.Â  According to language\r\n  in this note, if Brunson did not use the entire credit line within two years,\r\n  the credit line would close and the balance then owing at that time would\r\n  operate as a cap.Â  Although this note was purportedly secured by a mortgage on\r\n  the subject property and there were boilerplate references to a mortgage in the\r\n  note, no corresponding mortgage was introduced into evidence at trial.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the record does not include any evidence that either this note or any\r\n  corresponding mortgage was ever recorded.\r\nAccording to\r\n  information recorded at the Richland County Register of Deeds on December 15,\r\n  2003, Wells Fargo assigned its note and mortgage on the subject property to\r\n  GTI.Â  According to the recorded document evidencing the assignment, Wells Fargo\r\n  conveyed its interest to GTI on April 11, 2003, but the assignment had become\r\n  effective on February 1, 2003.Â  The document also indicated that &quot;Pete\r\n  Wessinger&quot; as &quot;Vice President&quot; acted on Wells Fargo's behalf in\r\n  executing the assignment, which was in turn attested to by &quot;Mark O'man&quot;\r\n  as secretary.Â  It further recited that consideration for the assignment was ten\r\n  dollars &quot;and other good valuable and sufficient consideration paid.&quot;Â \r\n  The only recording reference in the document is to deed book 371 at page 560, where\r\n  the lien granted by Brunson to FUMC was recorded.\r\nOn April 2, 2004, Brunson executed a note to\r\n  Greenlight Financial Services (Greenlight) for $90,000, plus yearly interest of\r\n  8.1250 percent.Â  The note was secured by a mortgage dated April 2, 2004, on the\r\n  same subject property.[2]\r\nOn\r\n  April 2, 2004, Greenlight assigned its mortgage to MIA Funding, LLC (MIA).Â  The\r\n  assignment was recorded March 23, 2006.[3]Â \r\n  It was MIA's understanding at the time of the assignment that it had acquired a\r\n  first-loan priority position; however, it subsequently learned there was a\r\n  senior lien on the property.Â  MIA received this information from an\r\n  investigative summary report prepared at Greenlight's request by First American\r\n  Credco.Â  The report is dated March 17, 2004, before MIA took the assignment\r\n  from Greenlight; however, it is not clear when MIA received it.Â  \r\nOn September 9, 2005, Wells Fargo brought a\r\n  foreclosure action against Brunson.Â  The action was dismissed on January 3,\r\n  2006. Â Neither the case file, which counsel sent in response to a request from\r\n  this court, nor the present record on appeal indicates the reason for the\r\n  dismissal.\r\nOn May 2, 2006, MIA Funding filed a lis pendens and\r\n  summons and amended complaint in the present action for foreclosure of its\r\n  mortgage.Â  Brunson filed an answer in which he asserted neither he nor &quot;P.\r\n  Sizer Land Trust&quot; had any interest in the MIA mortgage, but acknowledged\r\n  an obligation on the first mortgage with Wells Fargo for $67,000.Â  In its\r\n  responsive pleadings, Wells Fargo maintained it had a first mortgage on the\r\n  subject property and denied its mortgage had been capped.Â  It attached copies\r\n  of the FUMC note, a copy of the closing statement, and a copy of the mortgage\r\n  as exhibits to its answer.[4]\r\nOn May 21 and 22,\r\n  2008, the Richland County Master-in-Equity conducted a foreclosure hearing in\r\n  the matter.Â  The record on appeal contains testimony from Brunson and Michael\r\n  O'Donovan Murphy, III, an account manager for a servicing company hired by MIA. \r\nIn\r\n  addition to identifying MIA's note and mortgage, Murphy discussed the\r\n  circumstances surrounding MIA's discovery that there was a prior mortgage on\r\n  the subject property.Â  Based on Murphy's identification, a note that GTI provided\r\n  to Greenlight was entered into evidence.Â  Murphy also identified the investigative\r\n  summary report prepared in 2004 and testified that the report showed the\r\n  balance due on the GTI note was $12,530. Â The note, however, on its face states\r\n  that the lender is GTI, designates the obligation as GTI Loan No. 2572881, and\r\n  is devoid of references to the number that FUMC assigned to the loan that it\r\n  had made to Brunson.[5]\r\nBrunson,\r\n  who appeared pro se, was called by counsel for MIA.Â  He denied ever having a credit\r\n  relationship with GTI and stated he only borrowed money from Wells Fargo.Â  He\r\n  also denied signing MIA's note and mortgage; however, the master rejected his\r\n  contention, citing extensive evidence presented by MIA that Brunson executed\r\n  the note, mortgage, and related loan documentation.\r\nOn June 11, 2008,\r\n  the master issued an order and judgment of foreclosure.Â  The master ruled the\r\n  foreclosure sale was subject to, among other items, &quot;the senior lien of\r\n  that mortgage first recorded by First Union Mortgage Corporation in the\r\n  original principal amount of $67,000.00, dated December 17, 1999, and recorded\r\n  in said RMC's office on December 23, 1999, . . . but said lien shall be capped\r\n  at the amount of $12,530.00&quot;Â  As to the identity of the senior lien holder,\r\n  however, the master expressly declined to determine the present holder of\r\n  &quot;that first mortgage given by First Union Mortgage Corporation in the\r\n  original principal amount of $67,000.00 dated December 17, 1999 . . . .&quot;\r\nWells Fargo moved\r\n  to alter or amend the judgment, and the master heard the motion on June 27,\r\n  2008.Â  At the hearing, Wells Fargo submitted two affidavits.Â  In the first\r\n  affidavit, Mark Oman, a Senior Executive Vice President at Wells Fargo, stated\r\n  (1) the signature purporting to attest the assignment was not his, (2) he did\r\n  not witness the execution of the assignment by any agent or employee of Wells\r\n  Fargo, (3) he never authorized anyone else at Wells Fargo to execute the GTI\r\n  assignment on his behalf or on behalf of Wells Fargo, (4) he had never been\r\n  &quot;Secretary&quot; of Wells Fargo as indicated on the purported assignment,\r\n  and (5) no one spelling his name as &quot;Pete Wessinger&quot; had ever been a\r\n  Vice President of Wells Fargo.Â  In the second affidavit, Lorrie Phelps, another\r\n  vice president at Wells Fargo Bank, stated that Wells Fargo acquired its\r\n  interest in the subject property through an assignment from FUMC dated October\r\n  29, 2001, and recorded November 26, 2001, in deed book 593 at page 1293.Â \r\n  Phelps also asserted that Wells Fargo never transferred the note and mortgage.Â \r\n  Over MIA's objection, the master admitted the affidavits and a letter from the\r\n  law office representing Wells Fargo showing the payoff amount claimed by Wells\r\n  Fargo on its loan.Â  Nevertheless, the master ruled from the bench that he was\r\n  denying Wells Fargo's motion to alter or amend, and a written order to this\r\n  effect was filed July 2, 2008.Â  Wells Fargo then filed this appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA\r\n  mortgage foreclosure is an action in equity.Â  Hayne Fed. Credit Union v.\r\n    Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 248, 489 S.E.2d 472, 475 (1997).Â  For cases heard by\r\n  a master-in-equity who enters a final judgment, an appellate court may\r\n  determine facts according to its own view of the preponderance of the evidence;\r\n  however, it does not disregard the findings of the master, &quot;who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility.&quot;Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237,\r\n  391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. We first address an argument by\r\n  MIA Funding that Wells Fargo lacks standing to bring this appeal because it is\r\n  no longer the record lien holder.Â  We hold Wells Fargo still has a stake in\r\n  this litigation and standing to pursue this appeal.Â  See Ex parte\r\n    Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 62, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006) (&quot;As a general\r\n  rule, to have standing, a litigant must have a personal stake in the subject\r\n  matter of the litigation.&quot;).Â  Here, the master expressly declined to\r\n  identify the present holder of the mortgage that Brunson granted to FUMC in\r\n  1999.Â  Even more important, the question of whether Wells Fargo did in fact\r\n  assign its lien is one of the questions presented in this appeal.\r\n2. Wells Fargo contends there was\r\n  insufficient evidence supporting the master's finding that the purported\r\n  assignment of its interest in the subject property to GTI was valid and\r\n  enforceable.Â  We remand this issue to the master for additional proceedings.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  master found Wells Fargo offered insufficient evidence to support its proffered\r\n  position that the purported assignment of its interest to GTI was a forgery.Â  At\r\n  the hearing on Wells Fargo's motion to alter or amend, the master admitted\r\n  affidavits attesting that (1) no one from Wells Fargo authorized the assignment\r\n  and (2) the signatures on the instrument were not genuine, but he ultimately\r\n  declined to amend his prior ruling.Â  We recognize MIA objected to these\r\n  affidavits; however, the master's decision to admit them was tantamount to his reopening\r\n  the matter, a discretionary call that this court will disturb only in\r\n  exceptional cases. Â See Brenco v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 377 S.C.\r\n  124, 127, 659 S.E.2d 167, 169 (2008) (&quot;The decision whether to reopen a\r\n  record for additional evidence is within the trial court's sound discretion and\r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.&quot;); Hardaway\r\n    Concrete Co. v. Hall Contracting Corp., 374 S.C. 216, 233, 647 S.E.2d 488,\r\n  497 (Ct. App. 2007) (&quot; 'A judge may not, after all testimony has been\r\n  taken, receive additional contested evidence without reopening the case.'\r\n  &quot;) (quoting Johnson v. Johnson, 288 S.C. 270, 274, 341 S.E.2d 811,\r\n  814 (Ct. App. 1986)). Â \r\nNevertheless,\r\n  two deficiencies remain in the proceedings that prevent a determination\r\n  regarding whether the purported assignment from Wells Fargo to GTI was valid\r\n  and enforceable.Â  First, the master explicitly declined to make any finding as\r\n  to the identity of the present holder of the FUMC note and mortgage.Â  Second,\r\n  considering the posture of the case in view of the admission of additional\r\n  evidence, MIA should have had the opportunity to respond to the affidavits\r\n  after they were admitted.Â  Cf. Brown v. La France Indus., 286\r\n  S.C. 319, 325, 333 S.E.2d 348, 351 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding in a workers'\r\n  compensation case that the single commissioner did not err in reopening a case\r\n  for additional testimony from the claimants and noting the employer &quot;was\r\n  expressly authorized to present rebuttal testimony and failed to do so&quot;).Â \r\n  We therefore remand this issue to the master for further proceedings consistent\r\n  with this opinion.\r\n3. Finally, Wells Fargo alleges error\r\n  in the finding by the master that the only lien that was determined to have\r\n  priority over MIA's encumbrance on the subject property had been capped at\r\n  $12,530.Â  We remand this matter for further proceedings.\r\nAccording\r\n  to the appealed order, &quot;the note corresponding to the mortgage held by\r\n  GTI, a copy of which is part of the Court's record, provided that if the full\r\n  credit line of said note was not used within the first two years, the amount\r\n  used/ending balance would become a cap or limit on the amount owed and the\r\n  credit line would then discontinue.&quot;Â  The master also found the amount\r\n  used, i.e., the ending balance, was capped at $12,530.\r\nAs\r\n  we have noted, the record indicates Brunson executed two notes encumbering the\r\n  subject property on December 17, 1999.Â  FUMC held one note and assigned that\r\n  note to Wells Fargo in 2001.Â  It is undisputed that this note had no cap\r\n  provision and that the mortgage securing this note was recorded several days\r\n  after it was executed.Â  According to public records, although disputed by Wells\r\n  Fargo, Wells Fargo assigned this note to GTI in 2003, and the recorded\r\n  assignment references the deed book and page number of the mortgage that\r\n  Brunson had granted to FUMC.Â  Regardless of whether the 2003 assignment was\r\n  valid, the record suggests the FUMC note and mortgage should have been\r\n  recognized as having priority over any interest held by MIA.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  second note, which was offered into evidence by MIA, contained the cap\r\n  provision that, according to the master, limited the amount owed.Â  There is no\r\n  evidence, either in the note itself or elsewhere in the record, that GTI\r\n  obtained this second note through an assignment from Wells Fargo; rather, it\r\n  was executed by Brunson directly to GTI.Â  Furthermore, there is no evidence\r\n  that this note was ever recorded.Â  It is difficult to reconcile what appears on\r\n  the face of this second note with the master's finding that it represented the\r\n  same interest that Wells Fargo allegedly assigned to GTI.Â  Because we have\r\n  remanded the issue of the validity of the GTI assignment to the master, we\r\n  believe that a remand of this issue is appropriate as well. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold Wells Fargo\r\n  has standing to pursue this appeal and remand this case to the master for the\r\n  necessary findings pursuant Rule 71, SCRCP.[6]\r\nREMANDED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., HUFF and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The master's order states the assignment took place\r\n  February 28, 2001; however, an affidavit included in the record indicates\r\n  November 26, 2001, as the date of the assignment. Â The assignment document does\r\n  not appear in the record.Â  The loan number on the mortgage matches that\r\n  appearing in the note.\r\n[2]Â  Exhibit A of the mortgage document suggests Brunson\r\n  was record owner of the property by virtue of a conveyance from &quot;Trustee\r\n  P. Sizer of Land Trust 112&quot; by deed recorded December 1, 2002, and\r\n  recorded December 4, 2003.Â  According to the master's order, by deed dated\r\n  December 2, 2002, and recorded May 19, 2004, Brunson conveyed the subject\r\n  property back to Trustee P. Sizer.Â  &quot;P. Sizer,&quot; according to Brunson,\r\n  is Brunson's wife.\r\n[3]Â  The only documentation of these transactions in the\r\n  record on appeal is in the master's order, which also noted that Greenlight had\r\n  also assigned the mortgage to another entity, but the assignment was recorded\r\n  in error.Â  \r\n[4]Â Â  According to MIA's amended complaint, Wells Fargo\r\n  was made a party by virtue of its prior foreclosure action on the subject\r\n  property and because it had alleged in its complaint in the prior action that\r\n  &quot;it has interest in the subject property pursuant to an unrecorded\r\n  assignment from GTI investments.&quot;\r\n[5]Â  In its brief and during oral argument, counsel for\r\n  MIA argued the note to FUMC was only attached to Wells Fargo's pleadings and\r\n  therefore could not be viewed as evidence supporting any findings of fact. Â We\r\n  disagree.Â  See Rule 201(b)(2) and (c), SCRE (giving courts discretion to\r\n  take judicial notice of facts &quot;capable of accurate and ready determination\r\n  by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned&quot;).Â \r\n  Here, the FUMC note was a recorded document, and no allegation has been raised\r\n  in this appeal that the copy attached to Wells Fargo's answer was different\r\n  from the document that was recorded at the Register of Deeds.\r\n[6]Â  The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure require\r\n  that the presiding judge or master in a foreclosure &quot;compute the amounts\r\n  due the plaintiff and any other claimants, which amounts when determined\r\n  shall be the total debt due to each.&quot;Â  Rule 71, SCRCP.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-444","title":"State v.

Stanton Cross, Jr., Master-in-Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2010-UP-448\r\n  Heard October 6, 2010 â€“ Filed October\r\n19, 2010\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Howard\r\n          S. Sheftman and William R. Padget, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        Michael\r\n          W. Battle, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This appeal arises from an order of the\r\n  master-in-equity permanently enjoining Appellants Pearl Mae Sherald, Henry D. Sherald,\r\n  Seneca T. Sherald, and their employees, affiliates, lessors, and sublessors (Appellants)\r\n  from keeping or maintaining a public nuisance on their property.Â  On appeal,\r\n  Appellants argue the master erred in: (1) refusing to dismiss the action as\r\n  moot where the property had been closed by court order for the maximum time\r\n  prescribed by law for closure under section 15-43-10 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2005); (2) refusing to dismiss the action where the State failed to have the\r\n  matter heard on the merits after the first term of court as required by section\r\n  15-43-40 of the South Carolina Code (2005); (3) concluding the property\r\n  constituted a nuisance where there was no evidence that the Appellants had\r\n  knowledge of, or participated in, the alleged nuisance; (4) issuing a permanent\r\n  injunction against Appellants based on the criminal acts of third parties; and\r\n  (5) considering evidence of alleged nuisance activities occurring more than two\r\n  years prior to the initiation of the instant action where such evidence is\r\n  barred from consideration by the applicable statute of limitations set forth in\r\n  section 15-3-550 of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  Appellants further\r\n  maintain the issuance of the permanent injunction served to deprive Appellants\r\n  of their right to a jury trial and their fundamental right to due process.Â  After\r\n  a thorough review of the record, we find the evidence supports the master's\r\n  decision to issue the permanent injunction.Â  Specifically, the evidence in the\r\n  record demonstrates that the manner in which the property was used falls within\r\n  the ambit of section 15-43-10(A).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the order of the master-in-equity\r\n  pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n1. As to mootness, the\r\n  relief sought by the State was a permanent injunction under section 15-43-20 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2005), and although the closure was ordered by a\r\n  temporary injunction, the nuisance issue was still pending a final hearing on\r\n  the merits; thus, the matter was not moot. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-43-20 (2005)\r\n  (providing the State may maintain an action to &quot;enjoin perpetually such\r\n  nuisance&quot;); Seabrook\r\n  v. City of Folly Beach, 337 S.C. 304, 306, 523 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1999)\r\n  (&quot;A case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical effect\r\n  upon [an] existing controversy.&quot;).\r\n2. As\r\n  to dismissal for failure to have the matter heard on the merits after the first\r\n  term of court as required by section 15-43-40, we find appellants construction\r\n  of 15-43-40 too strict.Â  Section 15-43-40 merely states &quot;[t]he action,\r\n  when brought, shall be triable at the first term of court after due and\r\n  timely service of the notice has been given.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-43-40\r\n  (2005) (emphasis added); see Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)\r\n  (defining triable as subject or liable to judicial examination and trial).\r\n3.  \r\n  As to whether the property constituted a nuisance: Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-43-10(A)\r\n  (2005) (&quot;A person who erects, establishes, continues, maintains, uses,\r\n  owns, occupies, leases, or releases any building or other place used for the\r\n  purposes of . . . prostitution, repeated acts of unlawful possession or sale of\r\n  controlled substances . . . in this State is guilty of a nuisance.&quot;); Shaw\r\n  v. Coleman, 373 S.C. 485, 493, 645 S.E.2d 252, 256 (Ct. App. 2007) (&quot;Where\r\n  the terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according\r\n  to their literal meaning, without resort to subtle or forced construction to\r\n  limit or expand the statute's operation.&quot;); State v.

As to the issuance of the permanent injunction: Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-43-20\r\n  (2005) (&quot;Whenever a nuisance is kept, maintained or exists, as defined in\r\n  this chapter, the Attorney General, the solicitor of the judicial district in\r\n  which such nuisance is kept or any citizen of the State may maintain an action\r\n  in equity in the name of the State . . . to enjoin perpetually such nuisance,\r\n  the person conducting or maintaining the nuisance and the owner or agent of the\r\n  building or ground upon which the nuisance exists.&quot;); State v. Turner,\r\n  198 S.C. 487, 497, 18 S.E.2d 372, 375&nbsp;(1942) (noting a business\r\n  &quot;may become a nuisance by the manner in which it is conducted, and by the\r\n  conduct of the persons assembling in and around it&quot;).[1]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Because the\r\n  master's order failed to address the remaining issues on appeal and Appellants\r\n  did not move pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the master's\r\n  order, we need not reach these issues.Â  See Wachovia Bank, N.A. v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia;\r\n  and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Kaleem S. appeals his conviction of possession\r\n  with intent to distribute marijuana (PWID) and PWID within one-half mile of a school,\r\n  arguing the family court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â  We\r\n  reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nKaleem S. was\r\n  arrested, along with four co-defendants, while leaving a high school football\r\n  game.Â  A police officer stopped the vehicle Kaleem S. and his co-defendants\r\n  occupied after receiving a tip that the vehicle was involved in suspicious\r\n  activity.Â  After searching the vehicle, the officer found two bags of marijuana\r\n  in the passenger's backdoor armrest and under the driver's side rear seat.Â  Â \r\nAt\r\n  trial, the arresting officer testified regarding the incident.Â  He stated he\r\n  searched the vehicle after removing all of the subjects and found &quot;on the\r\n  passenger's side in the backdoor armrest[,] . . . a plastic bag containing\r\n  twenty small plastic bags of marijuana, and then, also located under the driver's\r\n  side, the rear seat, . . . a plastic bag containing marijuana.&quot;Â  The\r\n  officer arrested all of the individuals for PWID and PWID within one-half a\r\n  mile of a school because &quot;the marijuana was distributed throughout the\r\n  vehicle and was [not] in one centralized location where we could determine\r\n  exactly whose marijuana it was.Â  And . . . nobody was claiming any kind of\r\n  ownership of the marijuana.&quot;Â  The officer acknowledged he did not know who\r\n  was driving the vehicle, nor did he remember where the defendants were sitting\r\n  in the vehicle at the time of the stop.Â  The arresting officer confirmed that\r\n  no statements were taken from the individuals at the time of their arrests. \r\nAfter\r\n  the State closed its case, Kaleem S. moved for a directed verdict, arguing the\r\n  State failed to present evidence proving Kaleem S. had constructive possession\r\n  of the marijuana.Â  The family court denied the motion, ruling that the State\r\n  presented sufficient evidence to move forward. The family court explained, &quot;[The\r\n  State] . . . placed all five of [the defendants] in the vehicle, [and] the\r\n  drugs are in two different locations.&quot;Â  The family court ultimately found\r\n  Kaleem S. and his co-defendants guilty of PWID and PWID within one-half mile of\r\n  a school and sentenced them to ninety days' detention with the Department of\r\n  Juvenile Justice. Â This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nKaleem\r\n  S. argues the family court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict\r\n  because the State failed to prove he had constructive possession of the\r\n  marijuana.Â  We agree.Â Â  \r\n&quot;A\r\n  defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to present\r\n  evidence of the offense charged.&quot;Â  State v. Heath, 370 S.C. 326,\r\n  329, 635 S.E.2d 18, 19 (2006).Â  &quot;If there is any direct evidence or\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\n  the accused, [the appellate court] must find the case was properly submitted to\r\n  the jury.&quot;Â  State v. Stanley, 365\r\n  S.C. 24, 42, 615 S.E.2d 455, 464 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\n&quot;Conviction\r\n  of possession of marijuana requires proof of possession-either actual or\r\n  constructive, coupled with knowledge of its presence.&quot;Â  State v. Brown,\r\n  267 S.C. 311, 315, 227 S.E.2d 674, 676 (1976).Â Â  A person is guilty of\r\n  constructive possession of an illegal substance if the State proves &quot;the\r\n  defendant had dominion and control, or the right to exercise dominion and\r\n  control over the [illegal substance].&quot;&nbsp; Heath, 370 S.C. at\r\n  329, 635 S.E.2d at 19 (quotation marks and citation omitted).\r\nHere, the State did\r\n  not present substantial circumstantial evidence proving Kaleem S. had\r\n  constructive possession of the marijuana.Â  Kaleem S. was not the owner of the\r\n  vehicle, and the State failed to present evidence demonstrating Kaleem S.\r\n  controlled the vehicle and its contents.Â  See Id. at 329-30, 635\r\n  S.E.2d at 19 (&quot;The defendant's knowledge and possession may be inferred if\r\n  the substance was found on premises under his control.&quot;).Â  In fact, the\r\n  arresting officer testified he did not know who was driving the vehicle or\r\n  where the defendants were sitting in the vehicle.Â  See Brown, 267\r\n  S.C. at 315, 227 S.E.2d at 676 (granting a defendant's motion for a directed\r\n  verdict and finding insufficient evidence to prove defendant's dominion and\r\n  control of marijuana when the defendant was passenger in vehicle, driver had an\r\n  undetermined sum of cash, defendant was nervous and had no identification,\r\n  there was smell of marijuana in vehicle, and large opaque bag containing\r\n  marijuana was on the rear floorboard). \r\nIn\r\n  addition, the State failed to present evidence that Kaleem S. had knowledge of\r\n  the marijuana.Â  The officer testified the marijuana was located in two\r\n  locations in the back of the vehicle.Â  However, the officer admitted he did not\r\n  remember where Kaleem S. was sitting at the time of the stop. Â The State's\r\n  argument that Kaleem S. had knowledge of the marijuana because the bags were in\r\n  plain view in the passenger's side backdoor armrest is unsupported by the\r\n  record.Â  In fact, the officer testified he discovered the bags of marijuana in a backdoor armrest and under a rear seat.Â  Moreover, even if the bags\r\n  containing the marijuana were in plain view, the State never established\r\n  whether the marijuana was visible through the bags. Â \r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  hold the family court erred in denying Kaleem S.'s motion for a directed\r\n  verdict because the State only presented evidence proving that Kaleem S. was\r\n  present in the vehicle, not that he had dominion and control of the marijuana.Â  See State v. Wise, 272 S.C. 384, 387, 252 S.E.2d 294, 296 (1979) (&quot;Mere\r\n  proof of presence of a defendant in a vehicle containing a controlled substance\r\n  has been held insufficient in itself to convict him of the crime of possession.&quot;).Â Â  \r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the decision of the family court isÂ  \r\nREVERSED. \r\nWILLIAMS, PIEPER, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-462","title":"In The Interest Of Donald S.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2010-UP-462","description":null,"date":"2010-10-25","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS\r\n  OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.&nbsp; IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS\r\n  PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 268(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn The Interest\r\n      Of Donald S., A Juvenile Under The Age Of Seventeen, Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Richland County\r\nAnne Gue Jones, Family Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2010-UP-462\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2010 â€“ Filed October\r\n  25, 2010Â Â Â  \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAppellate Defender Kathrine H.

App. 1997) (holding a prior criminal conviction is a racially\r\n  neutral reason to strike).Â  We\r\n  decline to reach the issue of whether the trial court erred in finding the\r\n  peremptory strike of Juror Two was proper. See State v. Bryant,\r\n  372 S.C. 305, 315-16, 642 S.E.2d 582, 588 (2007) (finding when an appellant\r\n  concedes an issue at trial, it cannot be raised on appeal); see also State v.

MUST register with the Sheriff of the county in which he intends to\r\n  reside within one (1) business day of his sentencing.&quot;Â  \r\nMoultrie argues the trial\r\n  court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because he did not\r\n  receive adequate written notice regarding the sex offender registry requirements.\r\n  Specifically, Moultrie notes the paperwork provided by his caseworker was\r\n  inadequate because it incorrectly provided that he was required to register\r\n  within one business day of his sentencing.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 23-3-440(1) of the South Carolina Code (2007) requires\r\n  the Department to &quot;provide verbal and written notification to the\r\n  offender that he must register with the sheriff of the county in which he\r\n  intends to reside within one business day of his release.&quot;Â  (emphases\r\n  added).Â Â Â  Further, section 23-3-480(A) of the South Carolina Code (2007)\r\n  states a person will have actual notice of the duty to register if arrested on\r\n  charges of failure to register.Â  \r\nHere, Moultrie had actual\r\n  notice of his duty to register because he was convicted of failure to register\r\n  in 2006.Â  Moreover, Moultrie received\r\n  both written and verbal notice of the registration requirement.Â  Moultrie's\r\n  caseworker testified he verbally informed Moultrie of this registration\r\n  requirement prior to his release.Â  Furthermore, the caseworker provided Moultrie\r\n  with paperwork, which set forth the registration requirements.Â  Although the\r\n  paperwork contained a scrivener's error regarding the time in which Moultrie\r\n  was required to register, the paperwork did notify Moultrie he was required to\r\n  register.Â  Furthermore, the paperwork referenced section 23-3-440.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, PIEPER, and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-471","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General Julie M.\r\n          Thames, all of Columbia; and Solicitor James Strom Thurmond, Jr., of Aiken, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: David Heath appeals his conviction for\r\n  contributing to the delinquency of a minor, arguing the trial court erred in denying his motion for a\r\n  directed verdict. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nÂ &quot;When ruling on a\r\n  motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence\r\n  or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.&quot; State v. Weston, 367\r\n  S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006). Â A reviewing court must uphold the\r\n  denial of a directed verdict where &quot;there is any direct evidence or\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\n  the accused&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot; Â Id. Â The reviewing court\r\n  views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to\r\n  the State. Id. Â Under section 16-17-490 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  Annotated (2003), &quot;It shall be unlawful for any person over eighteen years\r\n  of age to knowingly and willfully encourage, aid or cause or to do any act\r\n  which shall cause or influence a minor: (1) To violate any law\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Moreover, &quot;It is\r\n  unlawful for a person under the age of twenty-one to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. consume\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. alcoholic liquors.&quot;Â  S.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 63-19-2450(A) (2010).\r\nViewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the State, the State presented direct evidence that Heath gave\r\n  alcohol to a minor. Â The evidence established Heath knew the minor was\r\n  fourteen.Â  The minor testified that she drank from a white, Styrofoam cup filled\r\n  with a &quot;brown drink&quot; containing alcohol. Â A public safety officer\r\n  found a white, Styrofoam cup in an area where the minor told the officer the\r\n  cup would be, and a detective testified that the cup &quot;had the odor of an\r\n  alcoholic beverage.&quot; Â Moreover, the State presented substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove Heath knowingly and\r\n  willfully influenced the minor to drink from the cup. Â Heath brought the cup\r\n  from a house and gave the cup to the minor. Â Accordingly, the trial court\r\n  properly denied Heathâ€™s motion for a directed verdict.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
