Savitz, III, of the South Carolina \r\n  Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Paul A. Gray was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual \r\n  conduct (CSC) with a minor and sentenced to eighteen years imprisonment.Â  Gray \r\n  was also convicted of performing a lewd act on a minor and sentenced to eight \r\n  years imprisonment, suspended upon the service of five years probation, to be \r\n  served consecutively with the other sentence.Â  He was acquitted of another CSC \r\n  charge.Â  He appeals, arguing the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony \r\n  concerning the victimâ€™s late reporting of the incident.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2001, the then eight-year-old \r\n  victim was living with her grandmother in McClellanville, South Carolina.Â  Loretta \r\n  Gray, Grayâ€™s mother, would baby-sit the victim everyday from the time the victim \r\n  got home from school until her grandmother came home from work.Â  The victim \r\n  would often come to Grayâ€™s house to drop off her books, walk to her grandmotherâ€™s \r\n  house to get some food or a change of clothing, and return to Grayâ€™s house until \r\n  her grandmother returned from work.Â  In April 2001, the victim went to stay \r\n  with her mother in North Charleston for spring break, and she told her that \r\n  Gray molested her.Â  Gray was indicted by the grand jury on two counts of CSC \r\n  with a minor and one count of performing a lewd act upon a minor.Â  \r\nThe victim testified at trial regarding several incidents occurring sometime \r\n  between January and April 2001.Â  According to the victim, Gray would often grab \r\n  her and either lie on top of her, put his hands down her underwear, or, on two \r\n  occasions, place his penis in her mouth in an attempt to force her to perform \r\n  oral sex on him.Â  The incidents occurred either at Grayâ€™s house or at the victimâ€™s \r\n  grandmotherâ€™s house.Â  The victim also testified that she defended herself from \r\n  Gray each time he demanded oral sex by biting him and by wielding a knife on \r\n  one occasion when he placed his hands down her pants.Â  The victim stated she \r\n  was scared to tell anyone about the incidents, but she finally felt safe enough \r\n  to tell her mother because she was not near Gray at the time.Â  \r\nThe State sought to present \r\n  the testimony of counselor Allison Rogers regarding how a delay in reporting \r\n  abuse is common in child abuse cases.Â  Gray moved to exclude her testimony, \r\n  and the trial court allowed an in camera examination of Rogers.Â  \r\n  Rogers testified in camera that â€œdelayed disclosure,â€ which is the time \r\n  period between when abuse takes place and when the victim reports the abuse, \r\n  is common in child abuse cases.Â  Rogers stated children often delay disclosing \r\n  abuse because they are embarrassed or they are afraid of the repercussions.Â  \r\n  Rogers also stated that children sometimes disclose with â€œtentative disclosureâ€ \r\n  in which they initially deny the abuse, tentatively disclose the abuse to test \r\n  adultsâ€™ reactions, and then fully disclose the abuse when they feel comfortable \r\n  that they are safe and will be believed.Â  Gray objected to the admission of \r\n  the behavioral testimony as more prejudicial than probative.Â  The trial court \r\n  denied the motion, finding the testimony was relevant and any prejudicial effect \r\n  was outweighed by the probative value.Â Â  \r\nAfter a short break, Rogers \r\n  took the stand and repeated her testimony regarding delayed reporting in front \r\n  of the jury.Â  Gray did not object to her qualification as an expert witness.Â  \r\n  Gray was acquitted of one count of CSC, convicted of one count of first-degree \r\n  CSC with a minor, and convicted of performing a lewd act on a minor.Â  He appeals. \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe question of whether to admit or exclude testimony of an expert witness \r\n  is within the discretion of the trial court.â€Â  State v. Weaverling, 337 \r\n  S.C. 460, 474, 523 S.E.2d 787, 794 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  on the admission of expert testimony will not be excluded absent an abuse of \r\n  discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGray argues the trial court erred in admitting the testimony regarding delayed \r\n  reporting since the probative value was substantially outweighed by the prejudicial \r\n  effect.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, the State argues this issue is not preserved for review.Â  Relying \r\n  on State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993), the State \r\n  argues that Gray failed to renew his objection when Rogers testified in front \r\n  of the jury, and, thus, he never obtained a final ruling on the matter.Â  Generally, \r\n  a pre-trial ruling on the admission of evidence is not considered final and \r\n  a party must renew his objection at the time the evidence is admitted.Â  See \r\n  Schumpert, 312 S.C. at 507, 435 S.E.2d at 862 (â€œUnless an objection is \r\n  made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling made, the issue \r\n  is not preserved for review.â€).Â  However, where the motion is ruled on immediately \r\n  prior to the introduction of the evidence in question and no other testimony \r\n  is presented to provide a basis for the trial court to change its ruling, the \r\n  ruling is final and no further objection is necessary.Â  State v. Tufts, \r\n  355 S.C. 493, 497, 585 S.E.2d 523, 525 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied \r\n  (June 24, 2004); Samples v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 109, 495 S.E.2d 213, \r\n  215 (Ct. App. 1997); State v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 266, 268-69, 460 S.E.2d \r\n  409, 410-11 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  In this case, the parties argued the motion during \r\n  the trial, Rogersâ€™ testimony was taken in camera, and the trial court \r\n  ruled the testimony was admissible.Â  Under these facts, it is clear the trial \r\n  court made a final ruling on the matter and it is preserved for review.\r\nAs to the merits, Gray argues the behavioral evidence presented was prejudicial \r\n  because â€œthe scientific community believes late reporting actually corroborates \r\n  a belatedly told story of sexual molestation.â€Â  In Schumpert, our supreme \r\n  court held that â€œexpert testimony and behavioral evidence are admissible as \r\n  rape trauma evidence to prove a sexual offense occurred where the probative \r\n  value of such evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.â€Â  Schumpert, \r\n  312 S.C. at 506, 435 S.E.2d at 862.Â  Similarly, this court held that expert \r\n  testimony regarding behavioral characteristics of sexual assault victims was \r\n  admissible: â€œSuch testimony is relevant and helpful in explaining to the jury \r\n  the typical behavior patterns of adolescent victims of sexual assault. . . . \r\n  It assists the jury in understanding some of the aspects of the behavior of \r\n  victims and provides insight into the sexually abused childâ€™s often strange \r\n  demeanor.â€Â  Weaverling, 337 S.C. at 475, 523 S.E.2d at 794 (citation \r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nRogersâ€™ testimony in the present case explained to the jury that child victims \r\n  of sexual assault often delay reporting abuse until they are assured that adults \r\n  will take them seriously and they will be protected.Â  The victim also testified \r\n  that she did not reveal the abuse to her mother until she was away from Gray.Â  \r\n  Rogersâ€™ testimony explained the victimâ€™s reaction, and it was thus more probative \r\n  than prejudicial in this instance.Â  We find the trial court did not abuse its \r\n  discretion. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, Grayâ€™s convictions and sentences are \r\nAFFIRMED. [1] Â  \r\nSTILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-553","title":"Excitement Video, Inc. v.

John, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-553\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2004 â€“ Filed November 1, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nH. Louis Sirkin, of Cincinnati and Jill Wright Fennel, of Myrtle Beach, for \r\n  Appellant.\r\nJohn L. Weaver, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Excitement Video, Inc. appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order \r\n  affirming the Horry County Board of Zoning Appealsâ€™ denial of a certificate \r\n  of zoning compliance.Â  We affirm [1] . \r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 25, 2001, Horry County Business License manager Roddy Dickenson notified \r\n  Excitement by letter that Horry County was denying its request for the renewal \r\n  of its business license.Â  The stated reason was that Excitement was in violation \r\n  of an Horry County ordinance that prohibited the issuance of adult entertainment \r\n  establishment licenses pursuant to the Adult Entertainment Moratorium.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, the zoning administrator declined to issue Excitement a certificate \r\n  of zoning compliance for the business.Â  The basis of the denial was that Excitementâ€™s \r\n  location was within 2000 feet of a residential area and a church in violation \r\n  of Horry County Code of Ordinances, Appendix B, section 526.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nExcitement appealed the zoning administratorâ€™s decision to the Board of Zoning \r\n  Appeals.Â  At the hearing, the only testimony offered was that of the zoning \r\n  administrator.Â  The administrator testified that while on a routine fire inspection, \r\n  he observed that Excitement was operating as an adult entertainment establishment.Â  \r\n  He based his assessment on the fact that â€œ99 percent of the shelf and wall displays \r\n  were Triple XXX videos and anatomically correct adult products used for sexual \r\n  stimulation. . . . [O]ther than the bathrooms and a drink vending area, adult \r\n  videos and adult products consumed the gross floor area of the store.â€Â  Horry \r\n  County Code of Ordinances, Appendix B, section 526.3 defines an â€œAdult Video \r\n  Storeâ€ as any enterprise deriving more than fifty percent of its gross revenues \r\n  from adult materials. [2] Â  The \r\n  administrator also testified that Excitement did not meet the spacing requirement \r\n  of 2000 feet from a residential use or a church.Â  \r\nExcitement put forth the argument that natural vegetation created a â€œbuffer \r\n  zoneâ€ that insulated the business from the view of both the church and the residential \r\n  area.Â  However, the administrator testified Excitement was not in literal compliance \r\n  with the zoning ordinance, which requires that measurements be taken from one \r\n  point to another in a straight line.Â  Measurements indicated Excitement was \r\n  located 1825 feet from a church and 1598 feet from a residential area.Â  \r\nAfter consideration of the matter, the Board denied the appeal based upon specific \r\n  findings that Excitementâ€™s business was an adult entertainment establishment \r\n  as defined in Horry County Zoning Ordinance section 526.3 and it was within \r\n  2000 feet of a residential area and a church.Â  \r\nExcitement appealed to the circuit court.Â  In addition to the grounds raised \r\n  in its petition for review, Excitement argued to the circuit court that it did \r\n  not receive a fair hearing before the Board in violation of its due process \r\n  rights.Â  The circuit court requested briefs from both sides on the due process \r\n  issue.Â  After considering the briefs, the circuit court affirmed the Boardâ€™s \r\n  decision.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Local Government Comprehensive Planning Enabling Act (Zoning \r\n  Enabling Act) sets forth the standard of review for appeals from local zoning \r\n  boards of appeal:Â  â€œThe findings of fact by the board of appeals shall be treated \r\n  in the same manner as a finding of fact by a jury . . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  6-29-840 (2004).Â  â€œIn determining the questions presented by the appeal, the \r\n  court must determine only whether the decision of the board is correct as a \r\n  matter of law.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, the factual findings of the zoning board \r\n  will not be disturbed unless there is no evidence in the record to support its \r\n  decision.Â  Heilker v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals for the City of Beaufort, \r\n  346 S.C. 401, 406, 552 S.E.2d 42, 45Â  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Due Process\r\nExcitement argues that it did not receive a fair hearing \r\n  before the Board of Zoning Appeals because the Board did not provide it with \r\n  a meaningful opportunity to cross examine adverse witnesses, thereby depriving \r\n  Excitement of its due process rights.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œThe fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard \r\n  at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Soc. Servs. v. Beeks, 325 S.C. 243, 246, 481 S.E.2d 703, 705 (1997).Â  â€œDue \r\n  process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular \r\n  situation demands.â€Â  Stono River Envtl. Protection Assâ€™n v. South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 305 S.C. 90, 94, 406 S.E.2d 340, 342 \r\n  (1991).\r\nExcitement contends it did not receive a fair hearing because \r\n  the chairman of the Board interrupted its attorney as he attempted to cross-examine \r\n  the zoning administrator on the presence of a buffer between the business and \r\n  nearby church and residences.Â  Our review of the record reveals that the Chairman \r\n  interrupted Excitementâ€™s attorneyâ€™s cross-examination of the zoning administrator \r\n  only to inform him that the administratorâ€™s determination as to the adequacy \r\n  of a buffer was not relevant as he was limited to enforcing the zoning ordinance \r\n  as written.Â  Excitementâ€™s attorney was in fact able to question the administrator \r\n  about the existence of vegetation providing a buffer and receive the administratorâ€™s \r\n  answers.Â  Excitement was also allowed to submit into evidence pictures of the \r\n  alleged buffer and make its argument on this issue.Â  In addition, Excitement \r\n  was able to question the administrator on the basis for his determination that \r\n  the business was in violation of the ordinance by having more than fifty percent \r\n  of its revenue derived from the sale of adult products and to present its argument \r\n  that the burden was on the administrator to prove this violation.Â  \r\nNear the conclusion of the hearing, the following exchange \r\n  occurred between the Chairman and Excitementâ€™s attorney:\r\n\r\n[Attorney]:Â  Iâ€™ve got it in the record, and Iâ€™m done.Â  Thatâ€™s \r\n  all I wanted to do.\r\nThe Chairman:Â  Okay.Â \r\n[Attorney]:Â  Thatâ€™s all I wanted to do.Â  Thank you.Â  Weâ€™ll rest \r\n  with the record as it is.Â \r\nThe Chairman:Â  Okay. Do we have any other statement from you?\r\n[Attorney]:Â  No. I believe I have created my record.Â  I canâ€™t argue the \r\n  measurements.Â \r\n\r\nIt is clear from the record that Excitement was given sufficient opportunity \r\n  to present its case.Â  It never complained about the interruptions or asked for \r\n  the opportunity to question the witness further.Â  In addition, Excitement failed \r\n  to present evidence or make further argument when given the opportunity.Â  If \r\n  Excitementâ€™s attorney thought that the hearing was conducted in a manner that \r\n  did not present Excitement with the opportunity to be heard in a meaningful \r\n  manner in violation of the dictates of due process, then he should have made \r\n  a statement at that time. Â \r\nWe agree with the circuit court that Excitement has failed to prove a violation \r\n  of its right to due process.Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â  Buffer Zone\r\nExcitement next argues that the circuit court erred when it determined that \r\n  the secondary effects of adult businesses were not negated by the existence \r\n  of a buffer between Excitement and the church and the residential area.Â  We \r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Excitement contends:Â  â€œ[A] local government seeking to justify its \r\n  zoning restrictions on the basis of the secondary effects doctrine need demonstrate:Â  \r\n  (1) that the drafters of the ordinance relied upon studies of secondary effects, \r\n  and (2) that a majority of the members of the voting body received some information \r\n  about the secondary effects.â€Â  Excitement, however, failed to raise any argument \r\n  about a lack of evidence justifying Horry Countyâ€™s adult business zoning ordinances \r\n  to the Board or the circuit court.Â  Accordingly, this argument is not properly \r\n  before this court.Â  See Burton v. County of Abbeville, 312 S.C. \r\n  359, 361, 440 S.E.2d 396, 397 (Ct. App. 1994) (stating issue was not preserved \r\n  for appeal where neither county zoning board of appeals nor circuit court addressed \r\n  issue and appellant did not seek a ruling by a post-trial motion).\r\nExcitement also asserts the â€œnatural barrier mitigates any negative impacts \r\n  upon the surrounding community and therefore undercuts the Countyâ€™s ability \r\n  to regulate Excitement Videoâ€™s location.â€Â  The Board and circuit court relied \r\n  on Restaurant Row Assocs. v. Horry County in rejecting this assertion. \r\n  335 S.C. 209, 516 S.E. 2d 442 (1999).Â  We agree that Restaurant Row is \r\n  directly on point.Â  In Restaurant Row, Thee DollHouse, an adult entertainment \r\n  business located in Horry County, challenged the Boardâ€™s denial of their request \r\n  for a variance from the provisions of Horry County zoning plan which at the \r\n  time prohibited the location of an adult entertainment establishment within \r\n  500 feet of a residential district.Â  Thee DollHouse argued that the natural \r\n  barrier of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway created a buffer zone between \r\n  its location and the residential area and thereby prevented the possibility \r\n  of any negative secondary effects from arising.Â  Id. at 220, 516 S.E.2d \r\n  at 448.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOur supreme court found the argument unconvincing.Â  The court explained that \r\n  zoning distance measurements must be done â€œas the crow fliesâ€ rather than based \r\n  on the actual terrain that must be crossed.Â  Id. at 221, 516 S.E.2d at \r\n  448.Â  The court noted that according to testimony in front of the Board, a bridge \r\n  was being constructed across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway very near Thee \r\n  DollHouse and a nearby tram ferried persons across the Intracoastal Waterway.Â  \r\n  The court held:Â  â€œWhat this testimony shows is that even though there may be \r\n  a natural barrier now, there may be a bridge in the future.Â  . . . [Z]oning \r\n  is not only concerned about present conditions, but focuses on the future as \r\n  well.â€ Id. at 221, 516 S.E.2d at 448-49.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, Excitement argues that a strip of natural vegetation provides \r\n  an adequate natural buffer.Â  As the Board recognized, the natural vegetation \r\n  that currently exists could disappear at any time whether through a natural \r\n  occurrence or through clearance for development.Â  We find no error in the Boardâ€™s \r\n  determination that Excitement is in violation of Horry County Code of Ordinances, \r\n  Appendix B, section 526. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased upon the foregoing reasoning, the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  When Excitement procured its original business \r\n    license, it did not meet this definition of â€œAdult Video Store.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-554","title":"Fici v.

Booth, III, \r\n  of Columbia, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Patricia Fici (â€œFiciâ€) brought this action against Karol \r\n  Koon and Kerry Koon Stack (collectively referred to as â€œ the Koonsâ€) seeking \r\n  specific performance of a contract to sell 30 acres of property and to cancel \r\n  restrictive covenants placed on the property.Â  Both Fici and the Koons sought \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The master found the contract violated the statute of frauds, \r\n  declined to address the restrictive covenants, and denied all partiesâ€™ attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fee requests.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nFici sought land in Columbia upon which to build a home.Â  Francis Hipp (â€œHippâ€) \r\n  acted as her broker in the search for suitable property.Â  The Koons inherited \r\n  fifty acres of land from their father.Â  They wanted to keep 10-acres each and \r\n  sell the remaining 30-acres to help finance the construction of homes on their \r\n  parcels.Â Â Â  \r\nThe parties signed a contract for sale using a standard realtorâ€™s sales contract.Â  \r\n  The Koonsâ€™ intentions leading up to the contract were to place restrictions \r\n  on the property to keep it from being subdivided or sold for use in an adjacent \r\n  subdivision.Â  However, no restrictive covenants were placed on the property \r\n  prior to the signing of the contract.\r\nThe contract called for the property lines to be determined upon agreement \r\n  of the parties.Â  Specifically, it called for the Koons as sellers to have a \r\n  survey done to determine the property lines.Â  Handwritten and then initialed \r\n  by all three parties was the notation:Â  â€œPurchaser and Seller to agree on location \r\n  of property lines.â€Â  \r\nOn March 9, 2001, the parties met at the property and with the help of a surveyor, \r\n  roughed in some boundary lines by hand on an older plat of the property.Â  The \r\n  parties each signed the plat over their portion of the property.Â  This plat \r\n  included the language:Â  â€œSurvey to be performed week of March 12 by CTH Surveyors.â€Â  \r\n  Fici agreed this plat did not represent a designation of the final boundaries.Â  \r\n\r\nThe surveyor faxed the resulting plat to the parties on March 14, 2001.Â  The \r\n  Koons, however, were not satisfied with the division of the property, mainly \r\n  due to the location of the access road.Â  A second plat, which was also unsatisfactory, \r\n  was produced on March 16, 2001.Â  A third and final plat was produced on March \r\n  19, 2001 and sent to Hipp on March 21, 2001.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter receiving the plat on March 21, 2001, Hipp took the written restrictions \r\n  and the plat and recorded them at the Office of the Register of Deeds for Richland \r\n  County.Â  Hipp, Fici, her counsel, and several other members of Hippâ€™s real estate \r\n  brokerage were present at a meeting regarding the property.Â  Hipp showed Fici \r\n  a copy of the updated plat.Â  Fici signed the plat:Â  â€œProperty lines for tract \r\n  3 are ok for me â€“ Pat Fici 3/22/01.â€Â Â Â  The Koons never signed the plat.\r\nFici brought this action when the Koons refused to cancel the filed restrictive \r\n  covenants on the property.Â  She sought specific performance of the contract, \r\n  rescission of the restrictive covenants, damages for breach of fiduciary duty \r\n  against Hipp and the brokerage, and damages for tortuous interference with a \r\n  contract. [1]   \r\nThe circuit court granted Fici a temporary injunction prohibiting the Koons \r\n  from disposing of the property and referred the specific performance action \r\n  to a master-in-equity while reserving the claims for damages for trial by jury.Â  \r\n  The circuit court also required Fici to post a bond, by depositing the purchase \r\n  amount into an account maintained by her at Wachovia Bank.Â  Fici was â€œrestrained \r\n  and prohibited from withdrawing any funds from the investment account or causing \r\n  any funds to be taken out of the investment account during the pendancy of this \r\n  action.â€Â  \r\nThe Koons answered by making a general denial of the claims.Â  During trial, \r\n  the Koons moved to amend their answer to specifically allege the affirmative \r\n  defense of the Statute of Frauds.Â  The master allowed the Koons to amend their \r\n  Answer because â€œthis amendment conforms with evidence already in the record.â€Â  \r\n\r\nThe master concluded the contract was too indefinite in its description of \r\n  the property to meet the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the master concluded the parties signed no other writings detailing the boundaries \r\n  of the property being sold to Fici.Â  Thus, the master denied Ficiâ€™s request \r\n  for specific performance.Â  \r\nThe Koons filed a motion for costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Â Â Subsequently, \r\n  they filed a Contempt Complaint and a Rule to Show Cause seeking to hold Fici \r\n  in contempt for withdrawing the money held at Wachovia prior to termination \r\n  of the action.Â  The master concluded the Koons were not entitled to attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and declined to hold Fici in contempt.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        Did the master err in allowing the Koons to amend \r\n  their Answer to specifically allege the Statute of Frauds as an affirmative \r\n  defense?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.\r\n         Did the master err in failing to award specific performance of \r\n  the contract?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the master err in failing to award either party attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for specific \r\n  performance lies in equity.Â  See Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 \r\n  S.C. 98, 105, 531 S.E.2d 287, 290 (2000) (citing Collier v. Green, 244 \r\n  S.C. 367, 137 S.E.2d 277 (1964)); see also Satcher v. Satcher, \r\n  351 S.C. 477, 482, 570 S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œOur scope of review \r\n  for a case heard by a Master-in-Equity who enters a final judgment is the same \r\n  as that for review of a case heard by a circuit court without a jury.â€Â  Tiger, \r\n  Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989).Â  \r\n  This court may review the evidence to determine facts in accordance with our \r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  See Townes Assocs. \r\n  Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  \r\n  â€œWhile this permits us a broad scope of review, we do not disregard the findings \r\n  of the Master, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate their credibility.â€Â  Tiger, 301 S.C. at 237, 391 S.E.2d at \r\n  543.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Motion \r\n  to Amend\r\nFici contends the master erred in allowing the Koons to amend their Answer \r\n  to specifically assert the Statute of Frauds as an affirmative defense.Â  We \r\n  disagree and find the amendment conformed to the evidence presented at trial.\r\nRule 15(b), SCRCP provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nWhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent \r\n  of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised \r\n  in the pleadings.Â  Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause \r\n  them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion \r\n  of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does \r\n  not affect the result of the trial of these issues.Â  If evidence is objected \r\n  to at the trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, \r\n  the court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when \r\n  the presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the \r\n  objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence \r\n  would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe decision whether to allow the amendment of pleadings to conform to the \r\n  evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Kelly v. South \r\n  Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 316 S.C. 319, 323, 450 S.E.2d 59, 61 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Amendments should be allowed if no prejudice occurs to the \r\n  opposing party.Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP; Soil &amp; Material Engâ€™rs, Inc. v. Folly \r\n  Assocs., 293 S.C. 498, 501, 361 S.E.2d 779, 781 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nRule 15(b) covers two situations involving amendments to conform to the evidence.Â  \r\n  â€œFirst, if an issue not raised by the pleadings is tried by express or implied \r\n  consent of the parties the court may permit amendment of the pleadings to reflect \r\n  the issue.Â  Second, if a party objects to the introduction of evidence as not \r\n  being within the pleadings the court may permit amendment of the pleadings subject \r\n  to a right to grant a continuance if necessary.â€Â  Sunvillas Homeowners Assâ€™n, \r\n  Inc. v. Square D Co., 301 S.C. 330, 334, 391 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  \r\n  â€œExpress consent may be demonstrated by a stipulation but implied consent depends \r\n  on whether the parties recognized an issue not raised by the pleadings entered \r\n  the case during the trial.â€Â  Id. at 335, 391 S.E.2d at 871.\r\nIn the instant case, the parties both raised issues regarding the insufficient \r\n  description of the property.Â  The parties each discussed the relevancy of the \r\n  plats and whether the parties agreed upon the actual boundaries for the property.Â  \r\n  Ficiâ€™s counsel specifically addressed whether the contract would be enforceable \r\n  under the statute of frauds standing alone and also after considering all the \r\n  additional testimony, plats, and other exhibits in the case.Â  Additionally, \r\n  Ficiâ€™s counsel asked one of the Koonsâ€™ witnesses whether the Statute of Frauds \r\n  should be specifically pled.Â  As a result of this questioning, the motion to \r\n  amend was made.Â  \r\nWe find the parties impliedly tried the Statute of Frauds issue.Â  In addition, \r\n  Fici has failed to demonstrate how she was prejudiced by the amendment as she \r\n  raised the issue herself with several witnesses.Â  Accordingly, we conclude the \r\n  master properly allowed the Koons to amend their Answer to conform to the evidence \r\n  presented at trial.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Specific \r\n  Performance and Statute of Frauds\r\nFici asserts the master erred in finding the contract failed to satisfy the \r\n  Statute of Frauds.Â  She maintains writings exist which can charge the Koons \r\n  with the boundary lines determining the property to be sold.Â  Finally, she contends \r\n  the master erred in failing to order specific performance of the contract.Â  \r\n  We disagree and find the contract fails to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Statute of Frauds requires that:\r\n\r\n  \r\nNo action shall be brought whereby: . . . (4) To charge any person upon any \r\n  contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments or any interest in or \r\n  concerning them . . . [u]nless the agreement upon which such action shall be \r\n  brought or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing and signed by \r\n  the party to be charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10 (1976).\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has held:\r\n  \r\nOne of the essential \r\n  terms of a contract of sale of land is the identification of the land.Â  A decree \r\n  for specific performance operates as a deed.Â  Hence, the land must be described \r\n  so as to indicate with reasonable certainty what is to be conveyed.Â  Parol evidence \r\n  cannot be relied upon to supplement a vague and uncertain description.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nCash v. Maddox, 265 S.C. 480, 484, 220 S.E.2d 121, 122 (1975) (internal \r\n  citations omitted).\r\nThe court further explained:Â  â€œFor a contract to meet the requirements of the \r\n  Statute of Frauds, . . . , every essential element of the sale must be expressed \r\n  therein. . . . Parol evidence may be used to explain terms appearing in the \r\n  description, but the description itself must clearly identify the particular \r\n  parcel of land.â€Â  Id.Â  In Cash, the only evidence of the property \r\n  being sold was that it consisted of 15 acres.Â  The parties never agreed which \r\n  15 acres were to be sold.Â  Id. at 484, 220 S.E.2d at 122.\r\nCash is indistinguishable from the instant case.Â  As there was no way \r\n  to determine from the writings in Cash which 15 acres the parties intended \r\n  to convey, there is no way to determine from the contract in the instant case \r\n  which 30 acres the parties intended to convey.\r\nIn order to satisfy the \r\n  Statute of Frauds, Fici would have to show some other writings, which when read \r\n  together with the sales contract provide a complete description of the property \r\n  to be conveyed and all other essential terms of the contract.Â  \r\n\r\nIt is well settled that \r\n  the form of writing required by the statute is not material.Â  The contract may \r\n  be evidenced by one writing or more. . . . Whatever form the agreement may assume, \r\n  if the writing or writings, viewed as a whole, constitute, in essence or substance \r\n  upon their face, a note or memorandum in writing, subscribed by the party sought \r\n  to be charged, showing who the contracting parties are, the subject matter of \r\n  the sale, and the consideration, the statute is satisfied.\r\n\r\nSpeed v. Speed, \r\n  213 S.C. 401, 408, 49 S.E.2d 588, 593 (1948).\r\nThe Koons and/or their agent have signed only two writings.Â  The first is the \r\n  plat all three parties signed with the hand drawn boundaries.Â  However, all \r\n  parties agreed the plat was not indicative of the final boundaries, and all \r\n  actions subsequent to the signing of the plat indicated the parties still needed \r\n  to establish the proper boundaries.Â  In addition, the plat signed specifically \r\n  stated on its face:Â  â€œSurvey to be performed week of March 12 by CTH Surveyors.â€Â  \r\n\r\nThe only other writing, which was â€œsigned,â€ was the request for admission answered \r\n  by the Koons that was signed and filed by their attorney.Â  The requests included \r\n  two pertinent questions:\r\n\r\n16.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  That the Defendants were in agreement for the New Plat to be prepared \r\n  showing and delineating a fifty foot wide driveway easement extending from Miles \r\n  Bowman Road to the Property at the southwestern most corner of Tract 2 as shown \r\n  on the New Plat.\r\n17.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  That the Defendants were in agreement for the New Plat to be prepared \r\n  with the property lines for the three tracts as shown on the New Plat.Â  (Plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  Exhibits 48 &amp; 49). Â \r\n\r\nThe Koons denied the first question and admitted the second.Â  The second question \r\n  only admits the parties planned for a plat to be prepared.Â  This is the same \r\n  as what the contract called for originally.Â  Fici fails to indicate a plat upon \r\n  which all three parties have agreed to the final boundaries.Â  Until the parties \r\n  have defined those boundaries with reasonable certainty, the Statute of Frauds \r\n  has not been satisfied.Â  Accordingly, we find the master properly determined \r\n  the Statute of Frauds bars enforcement of the contract for sale. \r\n  [2] \r\nIII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s \r\n  Fees\r\nThe Koons assert the master erred in failing to award attorneyâ€™s fees under \r\n  the contract or in the alternative as a result of Ficiâ€™s improper withdrawal \r\n  of the funds from the Wachovia account.Â  We disagree and find the master properly \r\n  refused to order attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n\r\nA. Â Â Â Â  Under the Contract\r\n\r\nÂ â€œThe general rule is \r\n  that attorneyâ€™s fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.â€Â  \r\n  Baron Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 383-84, 377 S.E.2d 296, \r\n  297 (1989).Â  â€œWhen there is a contract, the award of attorneyâ€™s fees is left \r\n  to the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed unless an abuse \r\n  of discretion is shown.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe contract in the instant case provided for attorneyâ€™s fees to be awarded:Â  \r\n  â€œIn any action to enforce the provisions of this Contract, the prevailing party \r\n  and Broker(s) shall be entitled to the award of their costs, including reasonable \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.â€Â  This provision, however, appears in a section of the contract \r\n  labeled Default.Â  The section details the rights of each party in the event \r\n  the other defaults on certain provisions of the contract.Â  \r\nâ€œThe purpose of all rules of contract construction is to ascertain the intention \r\n  of the parties to the contract.Â  Where the agreement in question is a written \r\n  contract, the partiesâ€™ intention must be gathered from the contents of the entire \r\n  agreement and not from any particular clause thereof.â€Â  Thomas-McCain, Inc. \r\n  v. Siter, 268 S.C. 193, 197, 232 S.E.2d 728, 729 (1977).\r\nWe find the language of the contract is clear that the parties intended the \r\n  attorney fee provision to be read as part of the section on default and not \r\n  as an isolated provision.Â  Also, the provision should not stand alone once we \r\n  have made the determination that the contract is unenforceable under the Statute \r\n  of Frauds.Â  Because it was impossible for either party to default under the \r\n  unenforceable contract, we find neither party would be entitled to attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees under this provision. \r\n\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  As a Result of Ficiâ€™s Withdrawal of Money\r\n\r\nThe account was established as part of the circuit courtâ€™s order granting Ficiâ€™s \r\n  request for a temporary injunction.Â  The court, citing Rule 65(c), SCRCP and \r\n  section 15-1-250 of the South Carolina Code, required the deposit of funds into \r\n  the Wachovia account.Â  The court, quoting the rule, found the deposit was needed \r\n  â€œfor the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by \r\n  any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.â€Â  The \r\n  court ordered:Â  â€œthe Plaintiff will agree not to make any disbursement from \r\n  the account during the pendency of this action.â€Â  \r\nThe Koons filed a Contempt Complaint and a Rule to Show Cause seeking to determine \r\n  why Fici should not be held in contempt for withdrawing the money from the Wachovia \r\n  account.Â  With the partiesâ€™ consent, the master addressed the contempt issue \r\n  as an additional motion instead of issuing the Rule to Show Cause and the matter \r\n  was argued along with the partiesâ€™ other post-trial motions.Â  The court took \r\n  testimony on the issue including testimony from Fici.Â  Fici explained that she \r\n  withdrew the money upon advice from her attorney that it was appropriate to \r\n  do so.Â  \r\nContempt results from the willful disobedience of a court order, and before \r\n  a court may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically \r\n  reflect the contemptuous conduct.Â  Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, \r\n  197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1989).Â  A willful act is one which is â€œdone voluntarily \r\n  and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, \r\n  or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; \r\n  that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€Â  Spartanburg \r\n  County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, \r\n  874 (1988).Â  â€œIn a proceeding for contempt for violation of a court order, the \r\n  moving party must show the existence of the order, and the facts establishing \r\n  the respondentâ€™s noncompliance.â€Â  Brasington v. Shannon, 288 S.C. 183, \r\n  184, 341 S.E.2d 130, 131 (1986).Â  \r\nOnce the moving party has made out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts \r\n  to the respondent to establish his or her defense and inability to comply with \r\n  the order.Â  Henderson, 298 S.C. at 197, 379 S.E.2d at 129.Â  A determination \r\n  of contempt is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, but his decision \r\n  will be reversed when the finding is without evidentiary support or there is \r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  Wilson v. Walker, 340 S.C. 531, 538, 532 S.E.2d \r\n  19, 22 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Even if a party is found in contempt, the party need \r\n  not be sanctioned for the conduct.Â  See Sutton v. Sutton, 291 \r\n  S.C. 401, 409, 353 S.E.2d 884, 888-89 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nThus, having determined Fici did not willfully violate the court order, the \r\n  master found no reason to hold her in contempt.Â  We agree.Â  Based on our reading \r\n  of the record, we find the master did not abuse his discretion in finding the \r\n  Koons were not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees as a result of Ficiâ€™s withdrawal \r\n  of the money.  [3] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the master properly allowed the Koons to amend their Answer to conform \r\n  to the evidence already admitted and argued by the parties.Â  We hold there are \r\n  no writings in evidence, which describe with reasonable certainty the boundaries \r\n  intended by the parties.Â  Therefore, we conclude the contract and all subsequent \r\n  writings fail to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.Â  Finally, we find neither party \r\n  is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, the masterâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The actions against Hipp and the brokerage are not at issue in this \r\n    appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  In determining the contract is unenforceable, we need not determine \r\n    the validity of the restrictive covenants or whether the Koons breached the \r\n    contract by filing the restrictive covenants.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Fici also requests attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  As we have concluded the master \r\n    properly denied her claim for specific performance, Fici is not entitled to \r\n    attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-555","title":"Rogers v.

Coxe, of Wrightsville Beach, for Appellant.\r\n        Andrew E. Haselden and R. Davis Howser, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: In this action for professional malpractice, Appellants Windy Hill Water Park and the companyâ€™s part owner, Carroll Rogers, (collectively, â€œWindy Hillâ€) challenge the trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion for a new trial.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn December of 1996, Windy Hill contacted the Bellamy Law Firm to assist in the preparation of a lease agreement to cover leasing the companyâ€™s aquatic amusement park in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  Respondent Jill Griffith, an attorney with the Bellamy Law Firm, prepared the requested lease documents.Â  After the original lessee withdrew from negotiations, Windy Hill solicited Richard C. Huggins, William Vaught, Jr., and William Vaught, III as new prospective lessees (collectively, â€œthe Lesseesâ€).Â  At no point did Griffith assist in Windy Hillâ€™s negotiations with the Lessees.Â  Instead, Griffithâ€™s services were limited to drafting the agreement revisions requested by Windy Hill.Â  \r\nOn January 27, 1997, Windy Hill asked Griffith to add a paragraph to the lease agreement requiring the Lessees to grant Windy Hill a third mortgage on the residence of William Vaught, Jr. and a second mortgage on property adjoining the residence.Â  Griffith added the requested language to the lease agreement.Â  Based on representations made by Lessees, it was Windy Hillâ€™s understanding that the $350,000.00 mortgage described by the new paragraph would be subordinate in priority to only $62,000.00 in other mortgages.Â  \r\n\r\nThe following day, Windy Hill met the Lessees and Griffith at the Bellamy Law Firm for the scheduled execution of the lease.Â  When it became clear that the mortgages required by the lease agreementâ€™s new paragraph had not been prepared, Griffith agreed to prepare the mortgages.Â  According to Griffith, she warned Windy Hill that no title search had been performed and that one could not be performed immediately.Â  Windy Hill chose to go forward without the title search.Â  The lease and mortgage documents were then executed, and Griffith stamped â€œDOCUMENTS PREPARED WITHOUT BENEFIT OF TITLE SEARCHâ€ on the face of the mortgage.Â  \r\nThe Lessees began operating a water park on Memorial Day, 1997, but made only three payments to Windy Hill before defaulting on the lease agreement.Â  With the Lessees in default, Windy Hill terminated the lease and took possession and control of the Lesseesâ€™ water park.Â  When Windy Hill began collection and foreclosure proceedings against the Lessees, a title search revealed the Vaughtsâ€™ property was actually encumbered by $131,550.50 in mortgages with priority over Windy Hill rather than $62,000.00 as had been previously understood.Â  \r\nWindy Hill brought this action alleging professional negligence on the part of Griffith and the Bellamy Law Firm in the preparation of the mortgage without a title search.Â  Griffith and the Bellamy Law Firm answered and asserted a general denial to the material allegations contained in the complaint.Â  Prior to trial, the trial court bifurcated the issues of damages and liability.Â  After three days of testimony, jury deliberations began on a Friday, at approximately 4:00 p.m. and continued until approximately 8:15 p.m.Â  The jury resumed deliberations the following Monday at 10:00 a.m. before delivering a verdict in favor of Griffith at approximately 11:45 a.m.Â  \r\nIn a hearing held after the trial, Windy Hill moved for a new trial on two independent grounds.Â  First, Windy Hill urged the court to invoke the thirteenth juror doctrine because the juryâ€™s verdict was against the greater weight of the evidence.Â  Second, Windy Hill argued the trial had been tainted by juror misconduct.Â  In support of this argument, Windy Hill offered the affidavit of Catherine Anthony, a juror from the trial, stating she noticed some of the jurors discussing the case Friday evening after ending deliberations for the weekend.Â  The trial court denied Windy Hillâ€™s motion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThirteenth Juror Doctrine\r\nWindy Hill contends the trial court erred by denying its post-trial motion for a new trial based on the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s thirteenth juror doctrine grants a trial court judge significant discretionary authority to grant a new trial when the judge concludes the evidence does not justify the verdict.Â  Norton v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 350 S.C. 473, 478, 567 S.E.2d 851, 854 (2002).Â  As a matter addressed to the trial judgeâ€™s discretion, we will uphold a judgeâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial unless the order is â€œwholly unsupported by the evidence, or [the] conclusion reached was controlled by [an] error of law.â€Â  Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 254-55, 387 S.E.2d 265, 267 (1990).Â  Here, because substantial testimony and numerous exhibits corroborated Griffithâ€™s defenseâ€”that she had been retained only for purposes of drafting a lease agreement and had warned Windy Hill about the lack of a title searchâ€”we cannot conclude the trial courtâ€™s decision not to disturb the jury verdict is wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â Â Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant a new trial based on the thirteenth juror doctrine.\r\nJuror Misconduct\r\nWindy Hill next contends the trial court erred in not granting a new trial based on juror misconduct.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nRule 606(b), SCRE, provides as follows: \r\n\r\n  Inquiry Into Validity of Verdict or Indictment. Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the juryâ€™s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other jurorâ€™s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the jurorâ€™s mental processes in connection therewith, except that a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the juryâ€™s attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror. Nor may a jurorâ€™s affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror concerning a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes.\r\n\r\nRather than basing its new trial motion on any extraneous prejudicial information improperly brought to the juryâ€™s attention, Windy Hillâ€™s motion is based solely upon allegations of internal misconduct.Â  \r\nAlthough the South Carolina Supreme Court has indicated juror testimony may be admissible about internal conduct to ensure fundamental fairness, State v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 311, 509 S.E.2d 811, 812 (1999), we find the exception inapplicable to the present case.Â  At the outset, we note that Aldretâ€™s limited exception to the rule prohibiting testimony about internal conduct has never been applied outside criminal cases.Â  See State v. Franklin, 341 S.C. 555, 534 S.E.2d 716 (Ct. App. 2000); State v. Hunter, 320 S.C. 85, 463 S.E.2d 314 (1995).Â Â  Moreover, nothing in the present case suggests the fundamental fairness of the trial process was placed in jeopardy.Â  According to Windy Hill, the alleged misconduct warranting a new trial was the statement by one juror that she â€œobserved jurors continuing to discuss the case Friday night after the deliberations had ceased in small groups.â€Â  This is not a case of premature deliberations; rather, the judge had already charged the jury with the law.Â  While a jury should refrain from discussing a case outside the confines of the jury room, the mere existence of such a discussion does not imply impropriety warranting judicial inquiry.Â  Therefore, the trial court committed no error in declining to grant a new trial.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF and CURETON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-556","title":"Mims v.

Beattie, Jr., and Marvin B. Poston, both of Aiken, for Appellants.\r\n        M. Anderson Griffith, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Arthur Myers and Bryant Glover (collectively Appellants) appeal a special refereeâ€™s decision upholding the tax sale of their property.Â  They argue that selling the entire property to satisfy unpaid taxes was excessive, and therefore invalid as a matter of law.Â  Appellants contend the property should have been divided and only a portion of the property sold.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1965, James Myers devised a forty-acre tract of land to his wife, Annie Mae Myers, and his five children.Â  In 1976, Annie Myers died intestate and her undivided interest passed through inheritance to the five children. The property was partitioned among the children into eight separate five-acre tracts.\r\nIn 2000, the property taxes were not paid on two of the tracts.Â  Appellants stipulated that they received all default tax notices pursuant to the statutory requirements, but took no action on the notices.Â  The tracts were seized for nonpayment of taxes for 1999 and 2000 in the amount of $538.92 each.Â  \r\nFollowing the tractsâ€™ seizure, Aiken County auctioned off the land for repayment of the delinquent taxes.Â  Though properly notified, Appellants did not attend the sale.Â  At the sale, the Aiken County Forfeited Land Commission successfully bid on the property. \r\nFollowing the sale, the county tax assessor began the process of setting off the divided portions of the tracts.Â  In response to the tax assessorâ€™s request for a description of the divided property, the Aiken County Planning and Development Board informed the tax assessor that dividing the tracts would violate Aiken County Subdivision regulations in regard to recorded easements.Â  The Commission, therefore, added the notation â€œSELL ALLâ€ to the both properties.Â Â Â  \r\nIn November 2000, Henry Mims purchased the two parcels of land in their entirety from Aiken County for $548.65 each.Â  Appellants took no action during the subsequent redemption period and, in March 2002, Mims received a deed for each tract.Â  The following July, Mims brought an action against the Appellants to quiet title to the land purchased at the tax sale.Â  Appellants argued the tax sale was invalid because selling the entire property to satisfy $1,223 of unpaid taxes was excessive and invalid as a matter of law.Â  The Special Referee found that the tax sale was proper.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEWÂ  \r\nAn action to set aside a tax deed is in equity.Â  S.C. Fed. Sav. Bank v. Atl. Land Title Co., Inc., 314 S.C. 292, 294, 442 S.E.2d 630, 631 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Therefore, this court may take its own view of the preponderance of evidence.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775-76 (1976). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nI. Divisibility Study\r\nAt the time of the tax sale, the statute containing the procedure for conducting a tax sale provided in part as follows:\r\n\r\n  When the real property is divisible, the tax assessor, county treasurer, and county auditor shall ascertain that portion of the property that is sufficient to realize a sum upon sale sufficient to satisfy the payment of the taxes . . . In such cases, the officer shall partition the property and furnish a legal description of it. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(d) (2000) (emphasis added).Â  This statutory language was amended in 2000 and the word â€œshallâ€ was replaced by â€œmay.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(d) (Supp. 2003).Â  Thus, the amended statute made it permissive rather than mandatory for the tax assessor, county treasurer, or auditor to divide the property. \r\nAppellants argue the applicable statute was the pre-amendment version in place at the time of the levy, thus the county was required to divide the property if feasible.Â  Since the referee found division was not required, it is their contention he erred by applying the current version, and not the pre-amendment version, of section 12-51-40(d).Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellants overlook that the referee did, in fact, apply the pre-amendment version of the statute. The South Carolina Supreme Court interpreted the prior version of the tax sale statute in Folk v. Thomas, 344 S.C. 77, 543 S.E.2d 556 (2001), and held, notwithstanding the pre-amendment mandatory language, that the defaulting taxpayer, and not the county, bore the initial burden of requesting a determination of possible property division.Â  The later amendments to the statute were merely a codification of this holding.Â  \r\nIn the case at bar, Appellants never raised the issue of divisibility nor did they request a divisibility study.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the mandatory language in section 12-51-40(d) did not place a pre-sale burden on the county to determine whether the property was divisible.Â  The tax sale, therefore, was statutorily proper.[1] \r\nII. Excessiveness of the Sale\r\nAppellants also argue selling the entire tracts, valued at $20,274 each, for taxes due in the amount of $611.95 per tract was excessive and invalid as a matter of law.Â  Again, we disagree.\r\nIn a tax sale of real property, â€œ[t]here are no fixed guidelines as to what constitutes excessive levy.â€Â  S.C. Fed. Sav. Bank v. Atl. Land Title Co., Inc., 314 S.C. 292, 297, 442 S.E.2d 630, 633 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  â€œA tax sale does not necessarily exact an excessive levy . . . because it brings an inadequate price.â€Â  Id.Â  Inadequate consideration alone is not a sufficient reason to set aside a tax sale.Â  It must be coupled with other inequitable circumstances, such as fraud, mistake, misapprehension, surprise, or other such factors. Patterson v. Goldsmith, 292 S.C. 619, 628, 358 S.E.2d 163, 168 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\nAppellants argue equitable relief should be granted based on mutual mistake and unjust enrichment.Â  The facts of the case, however, do not support these allegations.Â  Internal county documents showing that the county was considering selling only a portion of the properties are simply not sufficient to show a mistake between the parties.Â  On the contrary, by the time of the sale to Mims, the county tax office was aware that dividing the properties was not a viable option.\r\nWe likewise find no merit in Appellantsâ€™ claim of unjust enrichment.Â  Appellants admit they failed to take any action on the default notices and made no request for a divisibility study.Â  Moreover, Appellants have not challenged the special refereeâ€™s finding that the properties could not have been divided, even if a divisibility study was done.Â  Appellants did not raise the issues of excessiveness or divisibility until after Mims received his deed.Â  Despite adequate notice, they did not participate in the sale, nor did they take any action during the statutory redemption period.Â  Therefore, we conclude Appellants slept on their rights and cannot now demand their rights in equity.Â  See Folk, 344 S.C. at 83, 543 S.E.2d at 559 (2001) (â€œIt was . . . the defaulting taxpayer . . . who slept on his rights, did not pay his taxes for two years, failed to respond to any of the certified notices sent by the tax collector, and failed to show up at the tax sale.â€).\r\nIII. Improper Advertising of Tax Sale\r\nFinally, Appellants argue the tax sale advertising violated the proper statutory guidelines.Â  We find this argument to be without merit.\r\nRegarding advertisements for public sale, the tax sale statute requires that: 1) the property be advertised for sale at public auction; 2) the advertisement should be in a newspaper of general circulation; 3) the advertisement must be entitled â€œDelinquent Tax Sale,â€ and; 4) the advertisement must include the taxpayerâ€™s name and a description of property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(d) (Supp. 1999).Â  The statute also notes that reference to a parcel number is a sufficient description of property. Id. \r\nAppellants rely on Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., 342 S.C. 352, 536 S.E.2d 698 (Ct. App. 2000), for the proposition that the statutory requirements for notice must be strictly construed against the County, and a sale must be set aside if the description of the property is deficient in any respect.Â  We note, however, that Hawkins was modified on appeal by the South Carolina Supreme Court on the issue of advertisement, and the property description in that case was held to be sufficient.Â  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 40-41, 577 S.E.2d 202, 207-08 (2003).\r\nIn Hawkins, the description of the property to be soldâ€”a fifty-two foot sailboatâ€”did not describe the property as a sailboat, but only included the defaulting taxpayerâ€™s name and a delinquent tax number.Â  Id. at 40, 577 S.E.2d at 207.Â  Nevertheless, our supreme court found the advertisement sufficient due to the fact that it met the requirements of section 12-51-40(d) of the South Carolina Code.Â  Id. at 41, 577 S.E.2d at 208.Â  Hawkins is analogous to the case at hand, because in this case, the county used a tax parcel number to describe the land being sold.Â  Accordingly, we find the county provided a sufficient description of the property.\r\nAppellants also argue the sale was improperly advertised because a printout from the Aiken County Tax Offices contained handwritten notations next to each property showing that the sale of â€œ1.0 acreâ€ would cover the taxes due.Â  However, Appellants have not presented any evidence that this document, entitled â€œparcels of land to be carved up for tax sale,â€ was ever used to advertise the property for sale.Â  The special referee found the acreage reference was present only in some inter-office memos.Â  The newspaper advertisement relied on the propertiesâ€™ tax parcel number, which was an adequate description of both properties.Â  As a result, we find the advertisement was proper.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the special refereeâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Appellants also argue the tax sale violated sections 12-51-70, -130, and -150 of the South Carolina Code (2000 &amp; Supp. 2003).Â  Because these issues were raised for the first time in Appellantsâ€™ Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, and not during the trial before the special referee, they are not preserved for our review.Â  See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E. 2d 436, 437 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œA party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of a rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.â€).Â  We note, however, that even if these issues were preserved, none of the statutory provisions would require the sale to be voided because the county did not follow the statutory scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-557","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Thomas Mark Tucker (Tucker) \r\n  appeals his conviction following a guilty plea.Â  He argues that at the plea \r\n  hearing he maintained he acted in self-defense, and, therefore, the trial court \r\n  should not have entered a plea of guilty.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nTucker was indicted by a Greenville \r\n  County grand jury for criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature.Â  \r\n  On September 27, 2002, Tucker struck his live-in girlfriend, Christy Rocket \r\n  (Rocket), several times with his fist.Â  She suffered facial fractures because \r\n  of the incident and was taken to a hospital in an ambulance where she underwent \r\n  emergency surgery.Â Â  \r\nOn July 10, 2003, Tucker appeared before the trial \r\n  court and was represented by his attorney, Mr. Paschal.Â  The following colloquy \r\n  took place between Tucker and the court: \r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Now, thatâ€”and I understand you want to tender \r\n  a plea to criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature, and that \r\n  carries up to ten years in prison.\r\nDo you understand that?\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Yes, sir.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  All right.Â  Understanding the nature of the \r\n  charges against you and the maximum possible punishment, how do you wish to \r\n  plead?\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Guilty.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Now, has anybody forced you, coerced you, threatened \r\n  you, or promised you anything in any way to get you to enter a plea of guilty?\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  No, sir. \r\nTHE COURT:Â  And are you doing it freely \r\n  and voluntarily?\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER: Yes, sir.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Okay.Â  Do you understand that you have an absolute \r\n  right to a trial by jury where you would be presumed innocent unless and until \r\n  the Government could prove you guilty beyond any reasonable doubt of each and \r\n  every element of the offense that youâ€™re charged with?Â  \r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Yes, sir.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  You have a right to confront and cross-examine \r\n  the witnesses and the evidence against you.Â  Youâ€™d have a right to compel in \r\n  court all relevant and competent evidence in your defense, or you could remain \r\n  silent and your silence cannot be held against you.Â  You can never be compelled \r\n  to incriminate yourself in a court of law in this country.\r\nDo you understand all of those \r\n  rights?\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Yes, sir.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Do you want to waive and give up those rights \r\n  and plead guilty?\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Yes, sir.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Are you guilty?\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Uh, yes, sir. \r\n\r\nThe State recited the facts of the case, \r\n  alleging that Rocket was Tuckerâ€™s live-in girlfriend and describing the altercation \r\n  that led to Tuckerâ€™s indictment.Â  The following exchange then took place:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  All right.Â  Mr. Tucker, \r\n  youâ€™ve heard the recitation of the facts that the State believes they could \r\n  prove at trial.\r\nI want to ask you if you agree \r\n  or disagree with that?\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  I donâ€™t fully agree, \r\n  no, sir.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  All right.Â  If you would, tell me your version \r\n  of the facts.\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  I wasnâ€™t really living with her.Â  The reason \r\n  we had the fuss to start with is I was going home that night.Â  She didnâ€™t want \r\n  me to leave, chased me out to the car, and even going to the extent of getting \r\n  on the hood of the car so I couldnâ€™t leave, took my keys from me.\r\nI went back in the house with her trying to get my keys back.Â  \r\n  It turned into an argument and ended up in the bedroom arguing over trying to \r\n  get the keys back still.Â  All this, you know, to go home.Â  \r\nAnd then the only reason I hit her is she hit me three times \r\n  with an iron that was plugged up first.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Iâ€™m sorry.Â  Hit you three times with an iron?Â  \r\n  I didnâ€™t hear that. \r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Yeah, three times.Â  It was plugged up.Â  \r\n  The first time was in the elbow, and then once around my forearm, Iâ€™ve got a \r\n  scar there still, and once on the side of the head.Â Â  \r\nAnd, at that point, thatâ€™s when I justâ€”actually, when I hit, \r\n  I had my eyes shut and everything.Â  I just swung to get her off of me.Â  I donâ€™t \r\n  recall her being unconscious at all.Â  I looked at her.Â  I said, â€œAre you okay?â€Â  \r\n  I said, â€œIâ€™m sorry.â€\r\nI took her to the bathroom and got a towel.Â  There was no \r\n  blood in the bedroom.Â  I actually called 911 for her.Â  I went with her to the \r\n  hospital.Â  I stayed there all night with her until 7:00 that morning.Â  \r\n\r\nThe court next addressed Tuckerâ€™s claim \r\n  that he was not living with Rocket when the incident took place.Â  \r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  This is a guilty plea.\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Right.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  And one of theâ€”and, as I told you, the State has \r\n  got to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of the offense that \r\n  youâ€™re charged with.\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Right.\r\nTHE COURT:Â  And that is an essential element of the charge.Â  \r\n  So if it is your position that you are not a household member with the alleged \r\n  victim in this case, then Iâ€™m not going to accept your guilty plea.\r\nIf you donâ€™t feel that you were living there, then this is \r\n  not criminal domestic violence.\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Well, all Iâ€™mâ€”the whole story is she came \r\n  down fromâ€”she lived in North Carolina.Â  She came down.Â  She stayed at our house, \r\n  my parents.Â  I live at home still now.Â  She stayed with my parents until she \r\n  could find a place to live. \r\nMy dad actually helped her find that house.Â  It was a friend \r\n  of his that rented it.Â  And I had even told her, I was like, you know, I said, \r\n  Iâ€™ll help you some with money, whatever.Â  And I had stayed there some, but not \r\n  to the point of living there.Â  I lived at home.Â  Workâ€”if I had to go to work \r\n  the next day, I would go home.\r\nMR. PASCHAL:Â  But you had clothes and \r\n  â€“ \r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  I had a few clothes there.Â  I would change \r\n  sometimes when I went there after work.Â  But to say I lived there is not fully \r\n  true.Â  \r\n&nbsp;. . . . \r\nTHE COURT:Â  But you have described what might be construed \r\n  as a self-defense argument.Â  And I want to tell you that if you enter this guilty \r\n  plea and I accept it, that whatever defenses you may have, you waive and give \r\n  up the right to present those.Â  That doesnâ€™t say you canâ€™t present that information \r\n  as mitigation.\r\nBut just so you understand that if you have any question \r\n  as to theâ€”whether or not you have a defense in this matter, if you plead and \r\n  I accept it, you give up your right to use that defense.Â  \r\nDo you understand that?\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Right.Â  \r\n\r\nSubsequently, Tucker admitted that at times he \r\n  stayed with his parents while at other times he stayed with Rocket.Â  After â€œfinding \r\n  that he was, in fact, a household member,â€ the court addressed the possibility \r\n  of a self-defense claim:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  How about the self-defense, \r\n  Mr. Paschal?\r\nMR. PASCHAL:Â  Your Honor, I think you asked him about that \r\n  and I think he realizes that, but heâ€™s not saying that heâ€™sâ€”\r\nTHE COURT:Â  All right.Â  Well, Iâ€™ll accept the plea as being \r\n  knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made with the advice of a very competent \r\n  attorney with whom he states heâ€™s well satisfied, and there is a factual basis \r\n  for the plea. \r\n\r\nOn appeal, Tucker argues (1) the trial \r\n  court should not have entered a guilty plea because Tucker maintained that he \r\n  acted in self-defense, and (2) the court failed to conduct a sufficient inquiry \r\n  under. North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Self-Defense\r\nFirst, Tucker argues the trial court erred \r\n  in accepting his plea because he maintained that he acted in self-defense.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nInitially, this allegation is not properly before \r\n  this Court on direct appeal since the alleged error was not raised below.Â  In \r\n  the Interest of Antonio H., 324 S.C. 120, 477 S.E.2d 713 (1996) (proper \r\n  avenue in which to challenge guilty plea which is not objected to at time of \r\n  its entry is through post-conviction relief); State v. Williams, 303 \r\n  S.C. 410, 401 S.E.2d 168 (1991) (defendant must object at first opportunity \r\n  to preserve issue for appellate review; alleged error must be raised to and \r\n  ruled on by trial judge); State v. McKinney, 278 S.C. 107, 292 S.E.2d \r\n  598 (1982) (absent timely objection at plea proceeding, unknowing and involuntary \r\n  nature of guilty plea can be attacked only through more appropriate channel \r\n  of post-conviction relief).\r\nMoreover, as to the merits, we disagree with Tuckerâ€™s \r\n  claim that he did not admit culpability.Â  The trial court thoroughly informed \r\n  Tucker of his various constitutional rights.Â  Tucker indicated he understood \r\n  his rights and that he wanted to give up those rights and plead guilty:\r\n\r\nTHE COURT:Â  Do you want to waive and give up those rights \r\n  and plead guilty?\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Yes, sir. \r\nTHE COURT:Â  Are you guilty?\r\nDEFENDANT TUCKER:Â  Uh, yes, sir.Â  \r\n\r\nIf Tucker felt that he was not guilty, or that he \r\n  wanted to assert a defense, he should not have admitted guilt, and he should \r\n  not have entered a guilty plea.Â  \r\nFurther, the trial court specifically stated that \r\n  â€œyou have described what might be construed as a self-defense argumentâ€ and \r\n  informed Tucker that by pleading guilty, he waived any defenses that he may \r\n  have had.Â  Again, Tucker indicated that he understood.Â  Consequently, we are \r\n  convinced that Tucker entered a plea of guilty and waived any potential claim \r\n  of self-defense.Â  See State v. Thomason, 341 S.C. 524, 534 S.E.2d \r\n  708 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding a guilty plea admits all elements of the offense \r\n  charged, leaves open for review only the sufficiency of the indictment, and \r\n  waives all other defenses).\r\nII.Â  North Carolina v. Alford\r\nNext, Tucker argues that due to the absence \r\n  of an admission of culpability, the court failed to conduct sufficient inquiry \r\n  under North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970).Â  We disagree.\r\nAs with the self-defense argument, this argument \r\n  is not properly before this Court because Tucker did not raise an objection \r\n  at the plea hearing.Â  In the Interest of Antonio H., 324 S.C. 120, 477 \r\n  S.E.2d 713 (1996) (proper avenue in which to challenge guilty plea which is \r\n  not objected to at time of its entry is through post-conviction relief); State \r\n  v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, 401 S.E.2d 168 (1991) (defendant must object \r\n  at first opportunity to preserve issue for appellate review; alleged error must \r\n  be raised to and ruled on by trial judge); State v. McKinney, 278 S.C. \r\n  107, 292 S.E.2d 598 (1982) (absent timely objection at plea proceeding, unknowing \r\n  and involuntary nature of guilty plea can be attacked only through more appropriate \r\n  channel of post-conviction relief).\r\nNonetheless, we find this argument without merit.Â  \r\n  Tucker did admit culpability, and he entered a guilty plea.Â  Therefore, the \r\n  court had no reason to alternatively accept the plea under Alford; that \r\n  case has no application here.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the circuit \r\n  court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-567","title":"State v.

Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; and Robert M. \r\n  Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A Greenville \r\n  County grand jury indicted Donald Mathis in February 2002 for criminal sexual \r\n  conduct with a minor in the first degree.Â  Following a two-day trial, Mathis \r\n  was convicted and sentenced to a term of thirty years.Â  On appeal, Mathis argues \r\n  for the first time that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction â€œbecause \r\n  the indictment did not sufficiently identify the alleged victim.â€Â  The indictment \r\n  read in pertinent part: â€œ[t]hat DONALD RAY MATHIS did in Greenville County, \r\n  on about the 19th day of May, 2001, commit a sexual battery on G.S.H., who was \r\n  less than eleven years of age.â€Â  Thus, Mathis avers the indictment is ineffective \r\n  because it only contains the victimâ€™s initials and not her full name.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 17-19-90 of the South \r\n  Carolina Code states that â€œ[e]very objection to any indictment for any defect \r\n  apparent on the face thereof shall be taken by demurrer or on motion to quash \r\n  such indictment before the jury shall be sworn and not afterwards.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (2003).Â  It is beyond dispute that the alleged defect in the \r\n  current case was apparent on the face of the indictment, yet Mathis failed to \r\n  raise the matter to the trial court before the jury was sworn.Â  In Thompson \r\n  v. State, 357 S.C. 192, 593 S.E.2d 139 (2004), our supreme court held that \r\n  alleged defects in an indictment concerning a victimâ€™s name do not raise jurisdictional \r\n  concerns and failure to object to such â€œdefectsâ€ pursuant to section 17-19-90 \r\n  results in waiver.Â  Id. at 196, 593 S.E.2d at 141.Â  Accordingly, this \r\n  issue is not preserved for our review.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n  [1] \r\nHEARN C.J., GOOLSBY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-572","title":"State v.

[1] \r\n FACTS\r\n  In 1987, an injury to Sandersâ€™ head rendered \r\n    him incapable of living independently.Â  Sanders also suffered from seizures \r\n    as a result of the injury and had to take several medications daily to control \r\n    the seizures.Â  In 2000, Sanders became a resident of Manor House of Olanta, \r\n    a residential care facility in Olanta, South Carolina.Â  In the contract between \r\n    the parties, Manor House agreed to provide Sanders with certain services, \r\n    mainly room and board, laundry, and the supervision and administration of \r\n    medications, although upon admission into the facility Sanderâ€™s doctor \r\n    declared him â€œcapable of self administration of medications.â€Â  The contract \r\n    also provided that Sanders could â€œcome and go as he please[d].â€Â  \r\n  Sanders left the premises of the residential \r\n    care facility on April 11, 2001.Â  Upon leaving the facility, he was arrested \r\n    for trespassing and spent more than two weeks in the Effingham Jail in the \r\n    custody of the Florence County Sheriffâ€™s Department, until he was released \r\n    to the care of his sister.Â  Manor House did not know of Sandersâ€™ whereabouts \r\n    during the two-week period and did not attempt to find Sanders or notify his \r\n    family members of his absence.Â  Three days after being released to his sisterâ€™s \r\n    care, Sanders suffered seizures.\r\n  As an assisted living facility, Manor House of Olanta \r\n    is licensed under the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental \r\n    Controlâ€™s Regulations.Â  25A S.C.Code Ann.Regs. 61-84 (Supp. 2000).Â  The regulations \r\n    require a facility to immediately report residents who have left the facility \r\n    under circumstances that raise concern about the residentâ€™s safety to any \r\n    agency providing services to the resident, next of kin, and local law enforcement.Â  \r\n    Id. at Â§ 404 (c).Â Â Â  \r\n  Sanders brought an action against Roberta Floyd, \r\n    individually and as Administrator of Manor House of Olanta, and Manor House \r\n    of Olanta (Respondents) for breach of duty of care, arguing that the regulations \r\n    create a duty of care for a negligence per se action.Â  Respondents \r\n    filed a Motion for Summary Judgment with a Memorandum in support of the Motion, \r\n    arguing that the licensing regulations do not provide Sanders with a cause \r\n    of action, and the obligations of the parties are governed merely by the contract \r\n    between them.Â  \r\n  The Clerk of Court notified the parties that \r\n    a hearing would be held on August 29, 2002.Â  Respondentâ€™s counsel also notified \r\n    Sandersâ€™ counsel about the hearing in two letters, dated August 1, 2002 and \r\n    August 9, 2002.Â  The second letter specifically requested that any discovery \r\n    be completed prior to the hearing and offered to â€œaccommodate [counsel] in \r\n    any way to have any discovery accomplished prior to the hearing.â€Â  After a \r\n    request for continuance by Sandersâ€™ counsel, the hearing was rescheduled for \r\n    October 23, 2002.Â  \r\n  The Clerk of Court sent notification of the new \r\n    hearing date to the parties on October 2, 2002. Â Sanders filed a Memorandum \r\n    in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment on October 8, 2002, which \r\n    did not include any affidavits or supporting testimony.Â  Sanders did not send \r\n    a copy of the memorandum to Respondent.Â  Sandersâ€™ counsel also did not appear \r\n    at the October 23rd hearing.Â  The judge held that Respondent owed no duty \r\n    to the plaintiff and therefore did not breach any standard of care to the \r\n    plaintiff.\r\n  Sanders filed a Motion for Reconsideration on \r\n    November 7, 2002, accompanied by a Memorandum in Support of Motion for Reconsideration.Â  \r\n    The judge denied the Motion for Reconsideration based on the â€œdifferent standards \r\n    of care that are applicable and the evidence considered and arguments made \r\n    at the previous hearing.â€Â  Louise Wellington, as Sandersâ€™ Guardian \r\n    Ad Litem, now appeals.\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n     I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Notice\r\n    Sanders maintains the circuit court erred in \r\n      finding proper notice had been given to him pursuant to Rules 5 and 6, SCRCP, \r\n      in regards to the October 23, 2002 hearing.Â  We disagree.\r\n    Rules 5 and 6 of the South Carolina Rules of \r\n      Civil Procedure provide that for every written motion, notice of the hearing \r\n      must be served upon each of the parties through their attorney, if there \r\n      is one, by delivering a copy to him or by mailing it to him at his last \r\n      known address.Â  Rule 5(a) and (b)(1), SCRCP.Â  \r\n    The Clerk of Court properly notified Sanders, \r\n      by mailing notice of the hearing to the most recent address on record for \r\n      Sandersâ€™ counsel.Â  Thus, service was proper.\r\n     II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Summary Judgment\r\n    Sanders argues the circuit court erred in granting \r\n      summary judgment when discovery had not yet been completed.Â  We disagree.\r\n    â€œ[S]ummary judgment must not be granted until \r\n      the opposing party has had a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.â€Â  \r\n      Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel., Co., 306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 \r\n      S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991).Â  Summary judgment also should not be granted if \r\n      a party can demonstrate that further discovery will uncover additional evidence \r\n      relevant to the issue and that they are not merely engaged on a â€œfishing \r\n      expedition.â€Â  Id. at 112, 410 S.E.2d at 544.Â  Sanders neither requested \r\n      additional time from the court for discovery, nor proved that any extra \r\n      time would be beneficial to resolving the summary judgment motion.Â  In addition, \r\n      opposing counsel sent correspondence volunteering to help with any discovery \r\n      that needed to be completed before the hearing.Â  Therefore, Sanders had \r\n      a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.\r\n    Sanders also claims the circuit court erred \r\n      in granting summary judgment because, viewing the evidence in the light \r\n      most favorable to Sanders, material issues of fact exist regarding whether \r\n      Floyd or Manor House breached a duty of care to Sanders or proximately caused \r\n      Sandersâ€™ injuries.Â  We agree.\r\n    On appeal of a grant of a summary judgment, \r\n      we apply the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), \r\n      SCRCP:Â  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to \r\n      any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter \r\n      of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 \r\n      (2002).Â  In determining whether an issue of fact exists, the evidence and \r\n      all inferences that can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in \r\n      the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Faile v. South Carolina \r\n      Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 324, 566 S.E.2d 536, 540 (2002).Â  \r\n      â€œSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts \r\n      of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  Vermeer \r\n      Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d \r\n      301, 306 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œEven when there is no dispute as to evidentiary \r\n      facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, \r\n      summary judgment should be denied.â€Â  Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, \r\n      173-74, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Moreover, â€œ[s]ummary judgment \r\n      is a drastic remedy, which should be cautiously invoked so that no person \r\n      will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues.â€Â  \r\n      Lanham v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina, Inc., 349 \r\n      S.C. 356, 363, 563 S.E.2d 331, 336 (2002).\r\n    Rule 56(e), SCRCP, states that a party opposing \r\n      a motion for summary judgment â€œmay not rest upon the mere allegations or \r\n      denials of his pleading.â€Â  The party must submit affidavits or the like, \r\n      which â€œset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for \r\n      trial.Â  If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall \r\n      be entered against him.â€Â  Rule 56(e), SCRCP.\r\n    In CEL Products, LLC v. Rozelle, this \r\n      court held an employer was entitled to summary judgment as to a former employeeâ€™s \r\n      claims because the former employee merely relied on his pleadings and did \r\n      not present opposing affidavits.Â  357 S.C. 125, 130, 591 S.E.2d 643, 645 \r\n      (Ct. App. 2004).Â  When a plaintiff is faced with a defendantâ€™s motion for \r\n      summary judgment that is supported by evidence, the plaintiff cannot defeat \r\n      the motion by relying upon the mere allegations of his complaint, but must \r\n      disclose the facts he intends to rely on by affidavit or other proof.Â  Dyer \r\n      v. Moss, 284 S.C. 208, 211, 325 S.E.2d 69, 70 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œA conclusory \r\n      statement as to the ultimate issue in a case is not sufficient to create \r\n      a genuine issue of fact for purposes of resisting summary judgment.â€Â  Shupe \r\n      v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 516-517, 445 S.E.2d 651, 655 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  \r\n    \r\n    However, â€œâ€˜[the] party opposing summary judgment \r\n      need not come forward in any way if the moving party has not supported his \r\n      motion to the point that it is a sham.â€™â€Â  Title Ins. Co. of Minnesota \r\n      v. Christian, 267 S.C. 71, 76, 226 S.E.2d 240, 242 (1976) (quoting Brunswick \r\n      Corp. v. Vineberg, 370 F.2d 605, 612 (5th Cir. 1967)).Â  â€œâ€˜Where the \r\n      evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence \r\n      of a genuine issue, summary judgment must be denied, even if no opposing \r\n      evidentiary matter is presented.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. \r\n      56).Â  The party moving for summary judgment carries the initial burden of \r\n      showing an absence of evidentiary support for the nonmoving partyâ€™s case.Â  \r\n      NationsBank v. Scott Farm, 320 S.C. 299, 303, 465 S.E.2d 98, 100 \r\n      (Ct. App. 1995).\r\n    Although Sanders did not \r\n      offer any affidavits in opposition to Respondentâ€™s motion, Respondentâ€™s \r\n      evidentiary showing as to the issue of negligence fails to establish the \r\n      absence of a genuine issue.Â  Respondent maintains its contract with Sanders \r\n      provided that he was free to â€œcome and goâ€ as he pleased and submitted a \r\n      sworn affidavit prepared by Roberta Floyd denying she or Manor House had \r\n      a duty of care.Â  However, section 404 (c) of the South Carolina Code Regulations \r\n      61-84 (Supp. 2000) states:\r\n\r\n    In cases where a resident \r\n      leaves the facility under circumstances which raise concerns about his/her \r\n      safety, the following must be contacted immediately: next of kin or responsible \r\n      person, sponsoring agency or any other agency providing services to the \r\n      client and local law enforcement.\r\n\r\n    25A S.C.Code Ann.Regs. 61-84 \r\n      (Supp. 2000).\r\n    Whether Sanders left the \r\n      facility under circumstances that should have raised concern about his safety \r\n      is a genuine issue of material fact, therefore, the motion for summary judgment \r\n      should have been denied.Â  \r\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n    STILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-576","title":"State v.

Steele (Husband) were divorced on March \r\n  27, 2003.Â  The settlement agreement, which was incorporated into the final order, \r\n  required Wife to vacate the marital home by April 15, 2003, at which time Husband \r\n  would pay her $5,000 for moving expenses.Â  Husband agreed to pay Wife $45,000 \r\n  by May 15, 2003, and an additional $40,000 by April 1, 2007.Â  In the agreement, \r\n  the parties promised not to â€œdestroy or damage any real or personal property \r\n  of the other party.â€ \r\nAfter having been in exclusive physical possession of the marital home for \r\n  three years pending the final settlement of the partiesâ€™ property rights, Wife \r\n  vacated the home on April 15, 2003.Â  Husband entered the home the following \r\n  day.Â  Shortly after moving in, he noticed damage to the Yoshino cherry trees, \r\n  the most fragile plants in the yard.Â  He soon noticed a general decline in the \r\n  health of the other plants as well.Â  Thirteen days after Husband took possession \r\n  of the home, many of the plants around the house were dead or dying.Â  Pictures \r\n  of the damage showed that the plants within ten to fifteen feet of the house \r\n  had been completely destroyed.Â Â  \r\nHusband brought a contempt action against Wife on May 16, 2003, alleging Wife \r\n  had damaged and destroyed plants, shrubs, and trees around the marital home.Â  \r\n  He further requested to suspend payment of the $45,000 he owed Wife until the \r\n  contempt action was heard.Â  At the hearing, Husband testified as to his opinion \r\n  as a landscaper with a degree in horticulture and a holder of a South Carolina \r\n  pesticide license.Â  He believed that a chemical had been applied to the soil \r\n  and that the chemical would have residual effects.Â  To test this theory, Husband \r\n  planted new plants in the contaminated soil to see if they would survive.Â  The \r\n  new plants died almost immediately.Â  Husband also testified that he engaged \r\n  experts to help him document the damage and estimate the cost of repair. \r\nHusband believed Wife was responsible for the damage.Â  He pointed out that \r\n  Wife has a master gardener degree from Clemson University and is â€œfairly knowledgeable \r\n  on chemicals that could be used to contaminate soil.â€Â  Wifeâ€™s cousin and sister \r\n  testified for Husband, and both stated that Wife told them she would kill and \r\n  destroy all the plants around the house if she had to move from the marital \r\n  home.Â  In response, Wife presented testimony that she was not close to her sister \r\n  or cousin and she would not tell them such damaging information.Â  Wifeâ€™s daughter \r\n  and another cousin testified that Wife had never mentioned destroying any plants \r\n  around the house.Â Â  \r\nThe family court held Wife in contempt and ordered Husband to engage the services \r\n  of a licensed contractor to return the property as close as possible to its \r\n  condition on April 15, 2003.Â  The court ordered that Wife would bear the cost \r\n  of removing any contaminated soil and replacing all the plants that were destroyed.Â  \r\n  The court further found Wife should pay Husbandâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, \r\n  totaling $1,000.Â  Both the cost of restoring the property and the attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees were to be deducted from the $45,000 Husband owed Wife.Â Â  \r\nPursuant to Wifeâ€™s motion for reconsideration, the court modified the contempt \r\n  order as it related to damages.Â  The amended order required each party to obtain \r\n  an estimate for removing the soil and replacing the plants.Â  The parties were \r\n  directed to attempt to come to an agreement on the cost of restoring the property.Â  \r\n  If an agreement could not be reached, a subsequent hearing would be scheduled \r\n  to determine the measure of damages.Â  Wife appeals.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAlthough a determination of contempt is within the family courtâ€™s discretion, \r\n  an order holding a party in contempt â€œshould be reversed when the holding is \r\n  based on a finding that is without evidentiary support or when there is . . \r\n  . an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Means v. Means, 277 S.C. 428, 431, 288 S.E.2d \r\n  811, 812-13 (1982).Â  To sustain a finding of contempt, the record must be clear \r\n  and specific as to acts or conduct upon which the finding is based.Â  See \r\n  Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 382, 287 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1982).\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nWife maintains the family court erred in holding her in contempt of a prior \r\n  court order because the finding is without evidentiary support.Â  We disagree.\r\nUpon moving into the home, Husband immediately started noticing problems with \r\n  the plants, shrubs, and trees on the property.Â  As stated above, a mere thirteen \r\n  days later almost everything, including the grass surrounding certain plants, \r\n  was dead or dying.Â  In Husbandâ€™s opinion as a landscaper and licensed pesticide \r\n  applicator, the soil had been directly contaminated.Â  He tested his theory by \r\n  planting new tomato plants, all of which died over a two-week period.Â Â  Furthermore, \r\n  Husband testified that the rain totals for the year had been â€œmore than sufficient.â€Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Wife is a master gardener and has some knowledge of chemicals.Â  \r\n  She also had direct, unfettered access to the house.Â  In contrast, Husband testified \r\n  that he once had to be escorted to the property by a deputy sheriff to view \r\n  a roof in need of repair so Wife would not shoot at him. \r\nMost importantly, Shelby Jean Taylor, Wifeâ€™s first cousin, testified that Wife \r\n  said on several occasions that â€œshe was going to kill everything around [the \r\n  house].â€Â  Wifeâ€™s sister, Samantha Ann Roads, testified that, following their \r\n  motherâ€™s death, Wife â€œsaid that if she had to move from the house, had to leave \r\n  the house, that she would kill and destroy all the plants around the house.â€Â  \r\n  Though Wifeâ€™s daughter and Wifeâ€™s cousin, Joyce Snipes, both testified that \r\n  Wife had a strained relationship with Husbandâ€™s witnesses and would never have \r\n  used them as confidantes, Snipesâ€™ testimony contradicted Wifeâ€™s.Â  Snipes claimed \r\n  that Wife and Husbandâ€™s witnesses had not spoken since the funeral of Wifeâ€™s \r\n  mother.Â  However, Wife admitted she saw Taylor and her sister once a month since \r\n  her mother passed away.Â  \r\nBased on the testimony of the witnesses, we find there is evidence in the record \r\n  from which the family court could find that Wife destroyed the plants surrounding \r\n  the marital home.Â  Therefore, the family court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  by holding Wife in contempt of its previous order. \r\nWife next maintains the family court erred by awarding damages to Husband because \r\n  the damages were speculative in nature and based entirely on conjecture.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nAccording to the order dated July 25, 2003, the parties each must acquire one \r\n  estimate on the cost of â€œremoval of the contaminated soil and replacement of \r\n  the plants, which were destroyed.â€Â  If they cannot agree on a price to replace \r\n  the plants, the family court â€œshall schedule a hearing . . . to determine the \r\n  measure of damages.â€Â Â  Thus, damages have yet to be awarded.Â  Because the family \r\n  court has not made a final ruling on damages, the appeal as to the issue of \r\n  damages is premature.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976).Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s order \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-579","title":"South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company v.

Foster, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This declaratory judgment action concerns excess liability \r\n  insurance coverage.Â  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company \r\n  filed this action to determine whether it had any excess liability coverage \r\n  for an accident involving Tracey Moore, Becky Smith, and Barry Smith. At the \r\n  time of the accident, Tracey Moore was driving an Isuzu Trooper owned by her \r\n  mother-in-law and insured by Farm Bureau.Â  Tracy Mooreâ€™s husband, Stephen Moore, \r\n  owned a truck also insured by Farm Bureau.Â  Farm Bureau, as insurer of the Isuzu, \r\n  paid its policy limits to the Smiths and brought suit to determine whether its \r\n  policy on Stephen Mooreâ€™s truck provided excess liability coverage that would \r\n  be available to the Smiths.Â  The trial judge, sitting without a jury, determined \r\n  Farm Bureau did not provide excess coverage because Stephen Mooreâ€™s policy contained \r\n  a â€œregular use exclusionâ€ and the Isuzu was â€œavailable for the regular useâ€ \r\n  of Tracey Moore.Â  The Smiths appeal.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nThe Smiths argue the Isuzu was not available for the regular use of Tracy Moore \r\n  as defined by the Farm Bureau policy.Â  \r\nâ€œOn appeal of an action at law tried by the judge without a jury this court \r\n  will review the factual findings to determine if there is any evidence to support \r\n  them.â€ Â South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Windham,&nbsp;303 \r\n  S.C. 330, 331, 400 S.E.2d 497 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  Evidence presented in this case \r\n  includes Farm Bureauâ€™s exclusionary provision and Tracey Mooreâ€™s deposition \r\n  testimony.\r\nThe Farm Bureau policy excluded liability for non-owned vehicles available \r\n  for the â€œregular use of the insured.â€Â  The purpose of a regular use provision \r\n  is â€œto afford coverage for the infrequent and casual use of vehicles other than \r\n  the one described in the policy, but not to cover the insured with respect to \r\n  his use of another vehicle which he frequently uses or has the opportunity to \r\n  use.â€Â  AETNA Cas. &amp; Sur. v.

Co., \r\n  245 S.C. 144, 149, 139 S.E.2d 744, 746 (1964).Â  \r\nThe trial judge found as fact that the Isuzu was available for the regular \r\n  use of Tracey Moore.Â  Evidence in the record supports this finding.Â  In her \r\n  deposition, Tracey Moore stated she had a set of keys for the Isuzu, she kept \r\n  the Isuzu at her house â€œhalf of the time,â€ and she could use the vehicle for \r\n  any purpose.Â  The Isuzu was Tracey Mooreâ€™s primary means of transportation while \r\n  Stephen Moore was at work.Â  In addition, the declarations page of the insurance \r\n  policy on the Isuzu listed Tracy Moore as a driver. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  This case is decided without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-580","title":"State v.

Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelley Jackson, \r\n  of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Latorey J. Greene was convicted of first-degree criminal \r\n  sexual conduct, first-degree burglary, and assault and battery of a high and \r\n  aggravated nature.Â  He appeals, arguing the trial court abused its discretion \r\n  by allowing the solicitor to impeach him with his juvenile adjudication for \r\n  criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 11, 1998, Greene and the victim were partying at a mutual friendâ€™s \r\n  home.Â  The victim admitted she was drinking alcohol and using crack cocaine \r\n  â€œoff and onâ€ all day.Â  Late that evening, the victim testified that Greene offered \r\n  her a ride home, which she accepted.Â  She explained that she trusted Greene \r\n  to bring her home because she had dated his uncle in the past and thought of \r\n  Greene as a nephew.Â  When Greene brought the victim home, a cousin of Greeneâ€™s, \r\n  Christopher Billie, came along.Â  \r\nThe victim testified that both Greene and Billie walked her inside.Â  She claimed \r\n  that Greene made unwanted sexual advances toward her, which she fought off.Â  \r\n  Billie heard the commotion, talked to Greene, and the two men left the victimâ€™s \r\n  home.Â  After they left, the victim locked her front door and the door to her \r\n  bedroom, and she went to bed.Â  She fell asleep on her stomach and later woke \r\n  up when she realized that a man was on her back, raping her.Â  After ejaculating \r\n  inside her, the man left, and though the victim never saw his face, she recognized \r\n  that he was wearing the same tennis shoes that Greene had been wearing earlier \r\n  that night.\r\nThe victim waited for about five minutes before she dressed and ran to a nearby \r\n  pay phone.Â  She called 911, reported the rape, and was transported by ambulance \r\n  to the hospital.Â  At the hospital, a sample of semen was taken from her underwear.Â Â  \r\n  The DNA of the semen matched the DNA of a blood sample Greene gave to investigators.Â  \r\n  Â Â \r\nAfter the State rested its case against Greene, defense counsel explained that \r\n  Greene was planning to testify on his own behalf and made a motion to prevent \r\n  the solicitor from revealing to the jury Greeneâ€™s juvenile adjudication for \r\n  criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  The trial court determined that because \r\n  the past conviction was within the past ten years and the convictionâ€™s probative \r\n  value outweighed its prejudicial effect, the conviction could be used to impeach \r\n  Greeneâ€™s credibility.Â  \r\nGreene claimed that he and the victim had known each other for years and that \r\n  they had had sex in the past.Â Â  He described the victim as a long-time crack \r\n  addict who would have sex in exchange for drugs or money.Â  On the night he is \r\n  accused of raping the victim, Greene testified that the victim asked him for \r\n  a ride home and told him she would have sex with him if he paid her $20.Â  Greene \r\n  claims he gave the victim $20, and the two had consensual sex.Â  \r\nAfter deliberating for over twelve hours, the jury found Greene guilty of all \r\n  charges.Â  Greene was sentenced to concurrent terms of confinement totaling thirty-five \r\n  years.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to admit prior convictions to impeach a defendantâ€™s credibility \r\n  is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court, and absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion, the appellate courts will not reverse that decision.Â Â Â Â  Green \r\n  v. State, 338 S.C. 428, 433, 527 S.E.2d 98, 101 (2000).Â  To amount to an \r\n  abuse of discretion, the trial courtâ€™s conclusions must either lack evidentiary \r\n  support or be controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. \r\n  1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  \r\nRule 609(d), SCRE, provides that juvenile adjudications can be used to impeach \r\n  the accused when the crime adjudicated would be admissible to attack the credibility \r\n  of an adult.Â  Pursuant to subsections (a)(1) and (b) of Rule 609, a crime is \r\n  admissible to attack the credibility of an adult when: (1) the crime was punishable \r\n  by death or imprisonment in excess of one year, (2) the probative value of the \r\n  prior crime outweighs its prejudicial effect, and (3) the prior conviction is \r\n  less than ten years old. [1] Â  \r\n  When weighing the probative value of the defendantâ€™s prior convictions, the \r\n  trial court should consider the impeachment value of the prior crime, the amount \r\n  of time between the conviction and the defendantâ€™s subsequent history, the similarity \r\n  between the past conviction and the present charge, the importance of the defendantâ€™s \r\n  testimony, and the centrality of the credibility issue.Â  Green, 338 S.C. \r\n  at 433, 527 S.E.2d at 101.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGreene argues the trial \r\n  court erred by allowing the solicitor to impeach him with his juvenile adjudication \r\n  for criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  This issue is not preserved for review. \r\n\r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, defense counsel explained \r\n  that Greene planned to take the stand in his own defense and made a motion requesting \r\n  that the solicitor not be allowed to impeach Greene on his juvenile adjudication \r\n  for criminal sexual conduct.Â  Specifically, Greeneâ€™s counsel stated: â€œI would \r\n  make a motion at this time in limine that they not be allowed to go into [Greeneâ€™s] \r\n  juvenile record.â€Â  The trial court denied the motion, and the following colloquy \r\n  then took place:\r\n\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: Unless you can tell me that I can preserve this and still ask \r\n  [Greene] about the juvenile record on direct I will simply ask him about his \r\n  adult record and Iâ€™m sure [the solicitor] will bring out the juvenile . . . \r\n  unless you allow me to preserve it and still ask the question.\r\nTRIAL COURT: I donâ€™t know if I can or not.Â  I donâ€™t know that I have that authority.Â  \r\n  I think youâ€™ll have to just do it whatever way you want to do it and I . . . \r\n  you know, I canâ€™t say that your objection when you bring it out . . . thatâ€™s \r\n  going to be the ruling when the question is asked.Â  And you can handle it \r\n  anyway that you want to.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.) \r\nThe defense then proceeded with its case, first calling Greeneâ€™s cousin, Christopher \r\n  Billie, to the stand.Â  After Billieâ€™s testimony, Greene testified on his own \r\n  behalf.Â  During cross-examination, the solicitor asked Greene if he was convicted \r\n  for criminal sexual conduct in 1993.Â  Defense counsel did not object to the \r\n  question, and Greene admitted to having this prior conviction.Â  \r\nDespite defense counselâ€™s own characterization of his motion to exclude Greeneâ€™s \r\n  juvenile record, it was not a motion in limine because it was made after \r\n  the trial had begun.Â  State v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 266, 269 n.1, 460 S.E.2d \r\n  409, 410 n.1 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œA motion in limine is a pretrial procedure[.]â€). \r\n  However, like an in limine motion, the purpose of defense counselâ€™s motion \r\n  was to receive a preliminary ruling that would prevent the disclosure of a prejudicial \r\n  matter to the jury.Â  See, e.g., State v. Floyd, 295 S.C. \r\n  518, 369 S.E.2d 842 (1988) (explaining that the purpose of a motion in limine \r\n  is to prevent the disclosure of a potentially prejudicial matter to the jury). \r\n  Because the ruling was preliminary, it was subject to change based on developments \r\n  at trial.Â  Had no evidence been presented between the time of the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling and the presentation of the objectionable evidence, then no contemporaneous \r\n  objection would be needed to preserve the issue for appeal.Â  State v.

Patterson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-582\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2004 â€“ Filed November \r\n  17, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMichael Stephen Chambers, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nA.M. Quattlebaum, Jr. and Peter G. Siachos, both of Greenville, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal from the grant of summary judgment in \r\n  favor of the respondent Mercury Finance Company against the appellant Donald \r\n  C. Bedford.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nBedford purchased a 1997 Chevrolet pickup truck on September 14, 2000, from \r\n  the defendant Travelers Rest Cars-Trucks, LLC.Â  On March 16, 2001, Bedfordâ€™s \r\n  attorney wrote Mercury Finance a letter advising that Bedford â€œrescinds the \r\n  transactionâ€ and â€œwill retain possession of the auto [sic] as security \r\n  for the return of . . . paymentsâ€ that Bedford had made on the vehicle.Â  Mercury \r\n  Finance repossessed the truck on May 4, 2001.Â  \r\nThis action ensued with Bedfordâ€™s complaint alleging causes of action for conversion, \r\n  violation of the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, violation of the South Carolina \r\n  Consumer Protection Code, fraud, rescission, violation of the Unfair Trade Practices \r\n  Act, and violation of the Regulation of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers \r\n  Act.Â  \r\nAccording to Bedfordâ€™s brief, â€œ[t]he gravamen of [his] claim is that he was \r\n  not made aware of the monthly payments required under the transactionsâ€ and \r\n  â€œ[t]his is the direct result of the failure to provide [him] with a copy of \r\n  the required disclosures.â€Â  This â€œ[f]ailure,â€ he says, â€œconstitutes a material \r\n  misrepresentation and inducement by unconscionable conduct, warranting revocation \r\n  of acceptance.â€Â  \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment to Mercury Finance on all causes of \r\n  action.Â  It found that Mercury Finance provided Bedford with all disclosure \r\n  forms required by the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1601 et \r\n  seq. (1998) [hereinafter, â€œthe Actâ€].Â  \r\nThe grant of summary judgment came after Mercury Finance had served Bedford \r\n  on June 19, 2001, with interrogatories, requests for production of documents, \r\n  and requests for admissions, and moved on February 4, 2002 to compel Bedford \r\n  to answer its interrogatories and respond to its requests for production of \r\n  documents that Bedford had ignored.Â  The trial court had granted Mercury Financeâ€™s \r\n  motion to compel, ordering Bedford to answer all outstanding discovery requests \r\n  within ten days or by March 31, 2002. Â Notwithstanding the fact that \r\n  almost ten months had passed since Mercury Finance had served its discovery \r\n  upon Bedford, he had waited until April 4, 2002, to respond to Mercury Financeâ€™s \r\n  requests for admission, missing the court-imposed deadline by four days.Â  \r\nWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment by a trial court, the court of \r\n  appeals will apply the same standard used by the trial court under Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP, in considering it.Â  That is, summary judgment will be held proper when \r\n  there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 \r\n  S.C. 271, 279-80, 573 S.E.2d 830, 835 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[w]hen \r\n  a plaintiff is faced with a defendantâ€™s motion for summary judgment that is \r\n  supported by evidence, the plaintiff cannot defeat the motion by relying upon \r\n  the mere allegations of his complaint, but must disclose the facts he intends \r\n  to rely on by affidavit or other proof.â€Â  Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, \r\n  516, 445 S.E.2d 651, 655 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The facts presented and all reasonable \r\n  inferences that may be drawn from them must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  Englert, Inc. v. Netherlands Ins. Co., 315 S.C. \r\n  300, 302, 433 S.E.2d 871, 873 (Ct. App. 1993). \r\nUnder the Act, the term â€œmaterial disclosuresâ€ means, among other things, â€œthe \r\n  disclosure, as required by this subchapter [15 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1601 et seq. \r\n  (1998)], of . . . the total of payments, the number of and amount of payments, \r\n  . . . to repay the indebtedness.â€Â  15 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1602(u) (1998).\r\nWe agree with the trial court that no genuine issue of material fact exists \r\n  regarding whether Bedford was provided with a disclosure form that told him \r\n  of the amount of the monthly payments that the transaction in question required \r\n  him to make.Â  The record contains a document entitled â€œRETAIL INSTALLMENT CONTRACTâ€”AUTO \r\n  (including Truth in Lending Disclosures) SOUTH CAROLINA.â€Â  The document includes \r\n  a box whose heading reads, â€œTRUTH IN LENDING DISCLOSURES.â€ Within the box are \r\n  smaller ones that disclose, among other things, the total of payments, the number \r\n  of payments, and the amount of payments required to repay the indebtedness. [2] Â  A signature, that Bedford conceded at his deposition resembled \r\n  his own and at no time challenged, appears below a statement that reads, â€œBuyer \r\n  hereby acknowledges receipt of an exact and completely filled in copy of this \r\n  contract at the time of its execution.â€Â Â Â  \r\nMoreover, Bedford is deemed under Rule 36(a), SCRCP, to have admitted he signed \r\n  the Retail Installment Contract after he failed to respond timely to Mercury \r\n  Financeâ€™s requests for admission, particularly the statements â€œ[t]hat [Bedford] \r\n  signed the Retail Installment Contractâ€ and â€œ[t]hat the Retail Installment Contract \r\n  . . . contains all the disclosures required by law.â€Â  Even if the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  order compelling discovery is viewed as allowing Bedford an additional ten days \r\n  to respond to Mercury Financeâ€™s request for admission, Bedford failed to meet \r\n  that deadline as well. [3] Â  Under \r\n  Rule 36(b), SCRCP, the admitted matters were deemed â€œconclusively establishedâ€ \r\n  since Bedford never asked to withdraw or amend his admissions and the trial \r\n  court never allowed him to do so. \r\n  [4]   \r\nBecause we hold \r\n  the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to Mercury Finance \r\n  on the issue of whether it provided Bedford with a proper truth-in-lending document, \r\n  we need not address the question of whether Bedford lawfully revoked his acceptance \r\n  of the pickup under the Uniform Commercial Code, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-608 (2003).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ. concur\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  This case is decided without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â  The monthly payments were listed as being $358.86.Â  He admitted \r\n    during his deposition that he made five or six payments of approximately $360 \r\n    a month. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  The trial courtâ€™s order regarding discovery came in response to \r\n    a motion by Mercury Finance to compel Bedford to answer its interrogatories \r\n    and respond to its requests for production of documents.Â  The trial court \r\n    gave Bedford â€œ10 days to fully answer all outstanding discovery requests.â€Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Â Â  The trial court rightly ignored the affidavit Bedford executed \r\n    in which he swore he â€œwas not provided with a Truth in Lending Disclosure \r\n    Statementâ€ and he did â€œnot recall signing a Truth in Lending Disclosure Statement.â€Â  \r\n    A party cannot create a genuine issue of material fact in an effort to survive \r\n    a motion for summary judgment by submitting an affidavit that contradicts \r\n    a conclusively-established admitted fact.Â  See United States v. \r\n    Kasuboski, 834 F.2d 1345, 1350 (7th Cir. 1987) (holding affidavits \r\n    entered into opposition to a motion for summary judgment in an attempt to \r\n    establish issues of fact could not refute issues of fact established by default \r\n    admissions); cf.

Wylie, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-588\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2004 â€“ Filed November 29, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nSusan Trout Kinard, of Mt. Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\nDonna K. Taylor, and Susan King Dunn, both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this divorce case, Robin Smith (â€œWifeâ€) asserts on appeal that the family court erred in: equitably apportioning the marital property; accepting Rudolph Lee Smithâ€™s (â€œHusbandâ€) valuations of property; failing to value certain property before apportionment; and granting Husband a divorce based upon adultery.Â  We affirm the order of the family court.[1]Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married in 1974, when Wife was 16 and Husband was 19.Â  The marriage produced two sons.Â  The oldest is emancipated.Â  Custody of the youngest, Alex, has been shared between the parents since April 2000.Â  \r\nAt the beginning of the marriage, Wife finished high school, cared for the home and children, and worked at part-time, minimum wage jobs.Â  Husband dropped out of high school in the ninth grade and received no further education.Â  Husband has been employed full-time in construction for the duration of the marriage except for two periods when he was unable to work due to injury.Â Â Â  \r\nIn 1981, Wife joined the Air Force Reserves.Â  In 1991, Wife obtained full-time employment as a civil servant with the Reserves.Â  Wife accrued Air Force Reserve Retirement benefits during this time.Â  Before Wife was employed full-time, she earned less money than Husband.Â  Husband testified that her income had been roughly the same as his since she began working as a civil servant.Â  Wife testified that her income was less than Husbandâ€™s when she first began to work full-time.Â  It is undisputed, however, that Wife earned at least as much as Husband during the last five years of the marriage, and that her income exceeded Husbandâ€™s by $1,000 per month at the time of trial.Â Â  \r\nDuring the marriage the couple opened a checking account.Â  Each deposited an equal amount of approximately $500 every two weeks.Â  All household expenses were paid from this account.Â  Funds in the account were used to purchase a mobile home, the marital lot, and real property in White Hall.Â  Any money not placed in the account remained in the possession of the earner.Â  Husband used his extra funds to invest in stocks, IRAâ€™s, and real property.Â  Wife used her funds to purchase a car, clothing, and food.Â  She also spent $4,000 of her funds on liposuction and breast enhancement.Â  \r\nThe breakup of the marriage occurred on October 31, 1999.Â  Wife had previously asked to separate, but Husband did not agree until she returned from a weekend trip with a new negligee and an unopened box of condoms in her suitcase.Â  Wife testified that these items were meant to test her husband, but the family court found the testimony was not credible.Â  Wife left the marital home that night and did not return.Â  \r\nIn April of 2000, Wife filed an action for separate support and maintenance.Â  Husband answered and counterclaimed.Â  He also requested an order for separate support.Â  A pendente lite order was issued on May 30, 2000.Â  \r\nIn October 2000, Husband filed a separate action for divorce on the ground of adultery and sought equitable distribution of the partiesâ€™ property.Â  Wife filed an answer and counterclaim, raising the affirmative defense of recrimination.Â  The two cases were consolidated for trial.\r\nThe parties stipulated to the values of the liquid marital assets, the mobile home, the White Hall lot, and the cemetery plots.Â  The value of the marital lot, the Georgia property, and the two automobiles were in dispute.Â  The couple also owned three time-shares, but neither offered any evidence as to value.Â  The amount of marital debt was also contested.Â  At issue at trial was the value of the contested items and how they were to be apportioned between the parties.Â Â Â  \r\nThe family court granted Husband a divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  Wife was awarded 35% of the marital assets, and Husband was awarded 65% of the assets.Â  Husband was also awarded 65% of Wifeâ€™s Air Force Reserve Retirement account accrued during the marriage.Â  Neither party made any post-trial motions.Â  Wife appeals the family courtâ€™s order.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from family courts, we have jurisdiction to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not, however, require this court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Neither is the court required to ignore the fact that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).Â  Further, the equitable apportionment of marital property rests with the sound discretion of the family court judge, whose conclusion will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion.Â  Rogers v. Rogers, 280 S.C. 205, 207, 311 S.E.2d 743, 744 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. EQUITABLE APPORTIONMENT\r\nWife contends the family court abused its discretion and committed an error of law in awarding her only 35% of the marital estate because the court did not consider all the factors and erred in considering her adultery and economic misconduct.Â  She also asserts the court erred in awarding Husband 65% of her military retirement benefits earned during the marriage.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 20-7-472 lists fifteen factors for the court to consider in equitably apportioning a marital estate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2003); Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When reviewing the family courtâ€™s equitable apportionment, â€œthis Court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment.Â  If the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that this Court might have weighed specific factors differently than the trial judge.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988) (citations omitted).Â  The family courtâ€™s apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 23, 553 S.E.2d 251, 255 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œThis court will affirm the family court judge if it can be determined that the judge addressed the factors under section 20-7-472 sufficiently for us to conclude he was cognizant of the statutory factors.â€ Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nA. Adultery\r\nWife testified at trial that she wanted to separate from Husband and date other people, and he suggested they continue to live together.Â  She stated that when she was returning from a weekend trip, she placed a new negligee, with store tags still attached, and an unopened box of condoms in her suitcase.Â  She wanted Husband to see these items to â€œtestâ€ whether he was sincere in his declaration that she could live in the marital home but date other people.Â  Wife stated that she did not begin a sexual relationship with another man until August 2000, which was two months after the pendente lite order.Â  Husband obtained evidence of this relationship in September 2000 by hiring a private investigator to follow Wife.Â  This evidence was introduced at trial.Â  \r\nIn the final order, the family court found Wifeâ€™s explanation of the negligee and condom was not credible and that she had the opportunity and the inclination to commit adultery.Â  The court also noted the date of the partiesâ€™ marriage, Husbandâ€™s prudent investments, Wifeâ€™s economic misconduct, the value of the marital property, the partiesâ€™ earning capacities, various retirement funds the partiesâ€™ owned, and marital debt.Â  The final order noted that the family court considered all the factors found in section 20-7-472, particularly Wifeâ€™s fault in the break-up of the marriage and her economic misconduct.Â  \r\nCiting South Carolina Code section 20-7-472(2)(a), Wife argues the family court erred in considering adultery as a reason to punish her in the division of the marital estate because the only proof at trial was of a relationship commencing after the pendente lite order.Â  Section 20-7-472(2)(a) provides that evidence of personal misconduct, which would normally be relevant in equitably dividing martial property, shall not be considered in the division â€œif such conduct shall have taken place subsequent to the happening of . . . entry of a pendente lite order in a divorce or separate maintenance action . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(2)(a) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nWhile Wife is correct that family courts in general should not consider adultery after the pendente lite order in equitably dividing the property, nothing in the record indicates that Wife raised this issue before the family court in a post-trial motion.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See McDavid v. McDavid, 333 S.C. 490, 497, 511 S.E.2d 365, 368-69 (1999) (holding an issue not raised to or ruled on by the family court should not be considered by the appellate court).Â  \r\nIn any event, the negligee incident, occurring after Wife asked to separate from Husband and after she went away for a weekend, was evidence supporting the family courtâ€™s finding of opportunity and inclination to commit adultery during the marriage.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the consideration of adultery in dividing the marital estate.\r\nB. Economic misconduct\r\nWife complains the family court erred in considering her spending habits in dividing the marital property.Â  Although the parties contributed to a family fund and each invested their remaining money as they saw fit, Wife spent her money on clothes, shoes, liposuction, breast enhancement, and trips.Â  Evidence at trial indicated Wifeâ€™s clothes and shoes filled a garage such that a car could not pull into the garage.Â  Husband testified he invested money for the coupleâ€™s future in IRAs, CDs, BellSouth stocks, and real property in Georgia.Â  Thus, the family courtâ€™s finding that Wife was guilty of economic misconduct while Husband invested wisely is supported by the record.Â  Further, Wife failed to raise the consideration of economic misconduct to the family court in a post-trial motion.Â  Thus, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  McDavid, 333 S.C. at 497, 511 S.E.2d at 368-69.\r\nC. Award of military retirement benefits\r\nWife argues the family court erred in awarding Husband 65% of her Air Force Reserve Retirement benefits accrued during the partiesâ€™ marriage.Â  \r\nWife is correct in her allegation that 65% of her retirement benefits should not be awarded to Husband.Â  The Uniformed Services Former Spouseâ€™s Protection Act (USFSPA) provides that no more than 50% of a memberâ€™s military retirement pay can be ordered to be paid to the memberâ€™s former spouse in a divorce or separate maintenance order.Â  10 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1408(e)(1) (1998); see Coon v. Coon, 356 S.C. 342, 351, 588 S.E.2d 624, 629 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. granted (Oct. 6, 2004) (noting that the USFSPA limits the family courtâ€™s authority to award more than 50% of military retirement benefits, but it does not infringe upon its subject matter jurisdiction).Â  However, Wife stipulated that Husband was entitled to a portion of her military retirement benefits at trial, and she failed to object to the percentage awarded in a post-trial motion.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  McDavid, 333 S.C. at 497, 511 S.E.2d at 368-69.\r\nD. Consideration of factors\r\nWife finally argues the family court failed to adequately consider all the factors in equitably distributing the marital estate.Â  \r\nA family court must consider fifteen factors in equitably dividing marital property:Â  (1) the length of the marriage and the ages of the parties; (2) the martial misconduct of either party; (3) the value of the marital property; (4) the income and earning potential of each spouse; (5) each partyâ€™s emotional and physical health; (6) the need of a spouse for training to reach his or her earning potential; (7) each partyâ€™s nonmarital property; (8) retirement benefits; (9) awards of alimony; (10) whether the marital home should be awarded to one spouse; (11) the tax consequences of a particular distribution; (12) the existence of support obligations from prior marriage; (13) liens or encumbrances on marital property and any debt; (14) child custody arrangements; and (15) any other relevant factor the trial court enumerates in the order.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2003).\r\nThe evidence indicates the family court adequately considered all the statutory factors in equitably dividing the marital assets and debts.Â  The final order noted the length of the marriage, the marital misconduct of Wife, Husbandâ€™s prudent investments, Wifeâ€™s economic misconduct, the value of the marital property, the partiesâ€™ earning capacities, various retirement funds the partiesâ€™ owned, and marital debt.Â  The order specified that the family court considered the fifteen factors found in section 20-7-472.Â  Although the parties in the present case had a long marriage and each party contributed financially to the marriage, we find, based on the factors considered by the family court, that the actual distribution of assets and debts was equitable in this case.Â  \r\nII. VALUATION OF PROPERTY AND DEBT\r\nWife next argues the family court erred in adopting Husbandâ€™s property and debt valuations, failed to value other property before apportionment, and made a mathematical error when it distributed the property.Â  We find no error.\r\nA.Â  Adopting Husbandâ€™s valuations\r\nThere was conflicting testimony as to the value of the marital lot and the real property located in Georgia.Â  Husband submitted the 2000 tax assessment for the marital lot that valued the property at $11,000.Â  Wife testified that sales figures from comparable lots in the neighborhood indicated that the lot had a value of between $16,000 and $17,000.Â  The value of the real property located in Georgia was also in dispute.Â  Husband submitted a tax assessorâ€™s notice that showed the fair market value of the lot at $20,000.Â  Wife testified that the property was worth $32,000.Â  Each asserted that the value proffered was the value on the date of the commencement of the action.\r\nIn both instances the family court relied on Husbandâ€™s figures for the purpose of equitable apportionment.Â  When equitably apportioning property, the family court may accept one partyâ€™s valuations of marital property over those of the other party.Â  Smith v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, 198, 363 S.E.2d 404, 407 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  The weight the family court affords the testimony of witnesses, including parties, is within its discretion.Â  Id.Â  There is sufficient evidence in the record to support the family courtâ€™s order adopting Husbandâ€™s valuations.Â Â  Thus, we find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nB. Valuation of marital debt Â \r\nWife next asserts that the valuation of the partiesâ€™ marital debt was in error.Â  We disagree.\r\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that debt incurred by either party prior to marital litigation is marital debt subject to equitable apportionment.Â  Hickum v. Hickum, 320 S.C. 97, 102, 463 S.E.2d 321, 324 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œ[T]he same rules of fairness and equity which apply to the equitable division of marital property also apply to the division of marital debts.â€Â  Id. at 102, 463 S.E.2d at 324.Â  The burden of proving a spouseâ€™s debt as non-marital rests upon the party who makes such an assertion.Â  Id. at 102, 463 S.E.2d at 324.Â  In this case, the burden is on Wife.\r\nThe family court found that each party took a certain amount of debt with them at the time of separation.Â  Wife took $16,856, and Husband took $24,000.Â  Wife argues that the evidence supports the amount of her debt, but not the amount of Husbandâ€™s debt.Â  Wife contends $14,430 of the debt was accrued post-separation, and the family court abused its discretion when this amount was included in the marital estate.Â  Husband testified that the entire $24,000 debt was accrued before the parties separated.Â  It was within the family courtâ€™s discretion to accept Husbandâ€™s testimony even though Wife offered conflicting testimony.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nC. Valuation of time shares\r\nWife next argues it was error for the court to apportion two time-shares without valuing the property.Â  \r\nNeither party introduced evidence regarding the time-sharesâ€™ value.Â  The family court is not required to value property before equitable apportionment when neither party offered any evidence as to that propertyâ€™s value.Â  â€œA party may not complain to this court that the trial courtâ€™s valuation is unsupported by the evidence without offering proof of value at trial.â€Â  Roe v. Roe, 311 S.C. 471, 479, 429 S.E.2d 830, 836 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€œCase law indicates that the family court judge should first attempt an in-kind distribution.â€Â \r\nWooten v. Wooten, 358 S.C. 54, 62, 594 S.E.2d 854, 858 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nThe parties obtained two time-shares during the marriage.Â  One was a two-week block of time and the other was for one week.Â  The parties submitted the time-shares for equitable apportionment, but neither party offered any evidence concerning value.Â  The court divided the asset in kind pursuant to the 65%/35% by awarding Husband the two-week time share and Wife the one-week time share.Â  We find there is no abuse of discretion in this decision.Â  \r\nD. Mathematical error\r\nWife asserts a mathematical error was made when allocating the property among the parties according to the 65%/35% apportionment. Â \r\nThis issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Wife did not raise the issue of an error in mathematical calculations to the family court in a post-trial motion.Â  As the issue was not raised to the family court for correction, it is not appropriately before this court on appeal.Â  McDavid, 333 S.C. at 497, 511 S.E.2d at 368-69.Â  \r\nIII.Â  RECRIMINATION\r\nWife argues the family court abused its discretion in granting a divorce on the ground of adultery and assessing the cost of a private investigator against her because she pled the affirmative defense of recrimination in her answer.Â  We find the issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nâ€œRecrimination is a defense to an action for divorce if the acts of recrimination charged constitute in themselves a ground for divorce.â€Â  Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 634, 576 S.E.2d 156, 167 (2003).Â  In order to bar the Husband from receiving a divorce on the ground of adultery, the Wife must have proven at trial that she was entitled to a divorce on a fault ground.Â  Wife asserted the defense of recrimination in her answer and counterclaim, alleging Husband committed adultery.Â  However, Wife offered no evidence at trial concerning adultery on the part of Husband.Â  The only remote reference to adultery in the record is Wifeâ€™s testimony, â€œLee told me that he was getting married.â€Â  This testimony alone is not proof of adultery, and it would not support the defense of recrimination.Â  \r\nFurther, Wife failed to argue the defense of recrimination to the family court and failed to raise the courtâ€™s failure to rule on the issue in a post-trial motion.Â  Because the defense of recrimination was not ruled upon by the family court, it is not preserved for our review.Â  McDavid, 333 S.C. at 497, 511 S.E.2d at 368-69.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWife failed to preserve for review the questions of whether the family court erred in: considering Wifeâ€™s post-pendente lite relationship and spending on plastic surgery in equitably dividing the marital estate; awarding Husband 65% of Wifeâ€™s military retirement benefits; computing the amount of the marital estate representing a 65%/35% split; and failing to recognize Wifeâ€™s defense of recrimination.Â  Based on the record, we find the family court considered all the equitable distribution factors and did not abuse its discretion in making a 65%/35% split of the marital estate.Â  The family court further did not abuse its discretion in adopting Husbandâ€™s valuation of the marital estate and marital debts and in failing to place a value on the time shares.Â  Accordingly, the final order of the family court is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-589","title":"Ranger Insurance Co. v.

Goldberg, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this breach of contract action, Michael Dayse appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the magistrateâ€™s entry of judgment in favor of St. Lukeâ€™s Reformed Episcopal Church (St. Lukeâ€™s).Â  He contends the circuit court erred in reviewing the magistrateâ€™s decision solely for errors of law and not considering errors of fact.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nSt. Lukeâ€™s entered into a contract with Dayse whereby Dayse agreed to perform landscaping, build a wheelchair ramp, and pour concrete for a walkway, curbing, a driveway, and steps.Â  The parties agreed to a contract price of $4,800 with Dayse initially receiving $1,800.Â  Apparently dissatisfied with Dayseâ€™s work, St. Lukeâ€™s fired Dayse and hired someone else to complete the remaining projects.Â  \r\nSubsequently, St. Lukeâ€™s filed a breach of contract action against Dayse in magistrateâ€™s court alleging actual damages in the amount of $3,644.12.Â  The magistrate awarded St. Lukeâ€™s this amount but offset the amount with a credit to Dayse in the amount of $366.Â  The magistrate denied Dayseâ€™s motion for a new trial.\r\nDayse appealed the magistrateâ€™s decision to the circuit court.Â  After hearing arguments and reviewing the magistrateâ€™s return, the circuit court affirmed the judgment in favor of St. Lukeâ€™s.Â  In a form order, the court stated, â€œthere was no error of law committed.â€Â  In a written order, the court explained as follows:\r\n\r\nAppellant appears to be dissatisfied with the findings of fact.Â  His argument did not raise any errors of law commited by the lower court judge . . . .Â  This was a bench trial in which the judge is the trier of the facts and the law.Â  The lower court judge heard the testimony and received exhibits as evidence and concluded that the Plaintiff should be awarded judgment by way of a money judgment due to the poor workmanship of the Defendant.Â  \r\n\r\nDayse appeals the order of the circuit court.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nDayse argues the circuit court erred in affirming the decision of the magistrate.Â  He asserts the court applied an incorrect standard of review given the court reviewed the appeal only for errors of law and did not consider errors of fact.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 18-7-170 of the South Carolina Code of Laws governs the standard of review applicable in the instant case.Â  Parks v. Characters Night Club, 345 S.C. 484, 490, 548 S.E.2d 605, 608 (Ct. App. 2001) (recognizing that case originating in magistrateâ€™s court and appealed to circuit court is governed by section 18-7-170).Â  This code section states:\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the appeal the appellate court shall give judgment according to the justice of the case, without regard to technical errors and defects which do not affect the merits.Â  In giving judgment the court may affirm or reverse the judgment of the court below, in whole or in part, as to any or all the parties and for errors of law or fact.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170 (1985).Â  Section 18-7-170 provides that in an appeal from magistrateâ€™s court in a civil action, the circuit court may make its own findings of fact.Â  Parks, 345 S.C. at 490, 548 S.E.2d at 608; see Vacation Time of Hilton Head Island, Inc. v. Kiwi Corp., 280 S.C. 232, 234, 312 S.E.2d 20, 21 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œSections 18-7-140 and 18-7-170 give the Circuit Judge sitting in an appellate capacity the ability to make a determination in the same manner as Circuit Courts in trials without a jury and to reverse a judgment for errors of fact even though the Circuit Judge may not have had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses.â€); Rogers v. State, 358 S.C. 266, 269 n.1, 594 S.E.2d 278, 279 n.1 (Ct. App. 2004) (distinguishing standards of review in circuit court in criminal and civil appeals from magistrateâ€™s court and noting that the circuit court in a civil appeal may make its own findings of fact). \r\nIn terms of this courtâ€™s standard of review, we â€œwill presume that an affirmance by a Circuit Court of a magistrateâ€™s judgment was made upon the merits where the testimony is sufficient to sustain the judgment of the magistrate and there are no facts that show the affirmance was influenced by an error of law.â€Â  Burns v. Wannamaker, 281 S.C. 352, 357, 315 S.E.2d 179, 182 (Ct. App. 1984), affâ€™d as modified, 288 S.C. 398, 343 S.E.2d 27 (1986).Â  However, â€œthis court will not grant that presumption where . . . it clearly appears that the Circuit Court applied an erroneous standard of review and failed to accord the contested facts the scrutiny which Section 18-7-170 contemplates.â€Â  Id.\r\nTurning to the instant case, we find the circuit court applied an erroneous standard of review.Â  As evident by the form order, the circuit court only reviewed the magistrateâ€™s decision for errors of law.Â  Although the court subsequently issued a written order, this order did not cure the error.Â  In the final order, the court again referenced Dayseâ€™s failure to raise â€œany errors of law.â€Â  Moreover, instead of making its own findings of fact, the court deferred to the magistrateâ€™s findings by stating the magistrate was â€œthe trier of the facts and the law.â€Â  Because the circuit court applied an erroneous standard of review and failed to properly consider the disputed facts pursuant to section 18-7-170, we reverse the decision of the circuit court and remand the case for a determination consistent with this opinion.\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issue on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-593","title":"State v.

Howle, Special Referee\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-595\r\nHeard October 12, 2004 â€“ Filed November 30, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Warren S. Curtis, of Sumter, for Appellant.\r\n        William W. Wheeler, III, and Jacob H. Jennings,Â  both of Bishopville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  W.M. Blackmon and Linda K. Blackmon brought this action for ejectment against Luciano Lira.Â  Lira appeals the special refereeâ€™s order finding that Lira did not own the property at issue and was not entitled to compensation for improvements he made to the property.Â Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe land on which Lira is living is a 57.5-acre tract conveyed by Linda Blackmonâ€™s father, Watt Keels, to Mrs. Blackmon and her first husband, Lloyd Mixon.Â  Mixon and Mrs. Blackmon owned the property as tenants in common for life and upon the death of either of them, to the survivor in fee simple.[1]Â  Prior to 1994, Lira began working for Mixon.Â  In July 1994, Mixon permitted Lira to move into a mobile home on the land.Â  Mixon died on January 26, 2000.Â  Mrs. Blackmon later married W.M. Blackmon and the property at issue was deeded to the Blackmons by survivorship deed.Â  Mr. Blackmon died during the course of this litigation; therefore, Mrs. Blackmon is the sole owner of the property.\r\nThe Blackmons commenced this action in the Sumter County Magistrateâ€™s Court by filing an affidavit for ejectment of Lira.Â  On October 31, 2001, an order and rule to vacate or show cause was issued ordering Lira to vacate immediately or show cause within ten days why he should not be ejected.Â  On November 8, 2001, Lira filed a return to the rule in which he alleged his ownership of the property as a defense to the ejectment.Â  The parties consented to transfer the case to the Court of Common Pleas.Â  After the transfer, Lira filed an answer and counterclaim in which he argued he is the owner of the property by virtue of a grant from Mixon prior to his death.Â  In the alternative, Lira alleged that if he is not the true owner, he is due compensation for improvements he made to the premises.Â  The Blackmons replied to Liraâ€™s counterclaim, denying Liraâ€™s ownership interest in the property or any entitlement to compensation for improvements.\r\nOn March 18, 2002, the case was referred to a special referee.Â  After the August 19, 2002 trial, the special referee took the matter under advisement and allowed both parties to submit memoranda outlining their positions.Â  In his brief, Lira argued each of his claims and raised the issue of promissory estoppel based on a recent case.Â  On December 23, 2002, the special referee entered his order ruling in favor of the Blackmons on both the title and ejectment issues and ruling against Lira on the issues raised in his counterclaim.Â  Specifically, the special referee found Lira did not meet his burden of proving a parol gift by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Additionally, the special referee held Lira was not entitled to relief under the Betterments Statute[2] because he failed to prove his good faith belief in his title to the property and failed to prove any damages that would be recoverable.Â  Finally, the special referee concluded Lira failed to prove any damages were recoverable under the theory of quantum meruit given there was no evidence the work was performed by Lira for the benefit of the owners. \r\nSubsequently, Lira filed motions for a new trial and a stay of the effect of the order.Â  The special referee denied both of these motions. Â In his appeal, Lira moved for this court to grant a stay so that he could remain on the property during the appeal.Â  We remanded the matter to the special referee to set an appeal bond.Â  Lira appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an appeal from the final judgment of a special referee, the reviewing court has the same scope of review as if the appeal had been from the circuit court without a jury to the Supreme Court.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989) (discussing equity appeal direct to Supreme Court). \r\nThis case involves both actions at law and at equity.Â  â€œA case with legal and equitable issues presents a divided scope of review.Â  When legal and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal or equitable for purposes of the applicable standard of review on appeal.â€Â  Kuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 589, 538 S.E.2d 15, 20 (Ct. App. 2000) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nParol transfer of title, promissory estoppel, and quantum meruit are all equitable causes of action.Â  See Columbia Wholesale Co. v. Scudder May N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 261-62, 440 S.E.2d 129, 130-31 (1994) (recognizing a proceeding in quantum meruit is equitable.); Knight v. Stroud, 212 S.C. 39, 42-43, 46 S.E.2d 169, 170 (1948) (holding in an action for possession of real estate, if a parol gift is claimed, together with improvements made with the donorâ€™s knowledge, the issue is equitable); Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C. 477, 482, 570 S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating action seeking specific performance of title in property based on parol gift and promissory estoppel sounds in equity).Â  In an action sounding in equity, tried by the judge alone, the appellate court may review the record and make findings based on its own view of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  However, this court is not required to disregard the findings of the special referee who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nIn contrast, the issues involving the extinguishment of a property interest and compensation under the Betterments Statute are actions at law.Â  See Wigfall v. Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 60, 367 S.E.2d 156, 157 (1988) (holding a determination of title is legal in nature); Hammond v. Lindsay, 277 S.C. 182, 184, 284 S.E.2d 581, 582 (1981) (The construction of a clear and unambiguous deed is a question of law for the court.); Rogers v. Nation, 284 S.C. 330, 333, 326 S.E.2d 182, 183 (Ct. App. 1985) (An action for ejectment is one at law.).Â  In an action at law referred to a special referee with direct appeal to the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals, the appellate court will correct errors of law, but must affirm the special refereeâ€™s factual findings unless there is no evidence to support the findings.Â  Crary v. Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 388, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998); King v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 317 S.C. 385, 388-89, 453 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1995).Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Parol Transfer of Title\r\nLira argues the special referee erred in holding that no parol transfer of title occurred from Mixon to Lira.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA parol gift of land can be established only by clear and convincing testimony, and unless possession of the land is delivered or taken in pursuance of the gift thereby taking such parol gift out of the statute of frauds, evidence of the parol gift is inadmissible.â€Â  Knight v. Stroud, 214 S.C. 437, 441, 53 S.E.2d 72, 73 (1949).Â  Knight instructs that â€œin order to take a parol gift of land out of the statute of frauds possession must be taken in pursuance of the gift, and as a further condition to the consummation of the equitable right and title, the donee must have made improvements of a valuable and permanent character, induced thereto by the promise to give the land.â€Â  Id. at 441-42, 53 S.E.2d at 74.Â  Furthermore, mere possession and the making of some improvements do not dispose of the requirement of showing distinct proof that a gift actually occurred.Â  Id. at 442, 53 S.E.2d at 74.\r\nLira has not produced clear and convincing evidence of a parol gift.Â  It is not clear from the record Lira took possession in pursuance of a gift, or the improvements were induced by a promise to give the land.Â  Lira never testified that he moved onto the land because of a promise by Mixon to give him the land.Â  In fact, he gave no reason at all as to why he moved onto the land.Â  Although Lira testified as to the improvements he made on the land,[3] he did not testify that he made any improvements due to a gift.Â  While there was testimony offered from Liraâ€™s friend, Santos Alvarado, that he witnessed Lira give Mixon $5,000 in cash and overheard Mixon telling Lira â€œdonâ€™t worry about [the money], you know, the land [is going to] be yours,â€ there is no testimony that Lira relied on this promise.Â  Moreover, there is no documentation in the record to substantiate Liraâ€™s claim of a parol sale of land.Â  The only evidence is Liraâ€™s assertion that he paid Mixon â€œlarge sums of money in cash, amounting to approximately $25,000.00.â€Â  Furthermore, as the special referee found and Lira acknowledged at oral argument, the Blackmons had title to the mobile home, which was the most significant improvement relied upon by Lira.Â  Lira also lived rent-free and did not pay the taxes on the property.\r\nAdditionally, there is evidence in the record tending to show Lira actually did not believe he owned the land.Â  In response to a letter Lira received ordering him to vacate the property, Lira wrote a letter asking for an extension of time in which to vacate.Â  He did not assert his ownership anywhere in the letter.Â  Instead, he asked only for an extension to vacate.Â  During this same time, Lira also inquired about the new owner of the property apparently in an effort to acquire the land.Â  For the foregoing reasons, we find the special referee properly found the evidence did not support a parol transfer of title.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Promissory Estoppel\r\nLira argues the special referee erred in finding he did not establish title to the property under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.[4]Â  We disagree.\r\nOne may transfer title to real property pursuant to the doctrine of promissory estoppel.Â  Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C. 477, 483-84, 570 S.E.2d 535, 538-39 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In order to prove title under promissory estoppel, the following elements must be met:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; The presence of a promise unambiguous in its terms.\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Reasonable reliance upon the promise by the party to whom the promise is made. \r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; The reliance is expected and foreseeable by the party who makes the promise.\r\n  (4)&nbsp;&nbsp; The party to whom the promise is made must sustain injury in reliance on the promise.\r\n\r\nId. at 483-84, 570 S.E.2d at 538.Â  Each element must be proven by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.Â  Id. at 483, 570 S.E.2d at 538.\r\nWe find the evidence presented does not support the transfer of title by promissory estoppel.Â  As noted above, the only testimony referring to a promise by Mixon was from Liraâ€™s friend, Santos Alvarado, who stated he heard Mixon tell Lira the land would be his.Â  Even if this was enough evidence to support a promise, it does not show an unambiguous promise.Â  There was no evidence presented as to the amount of land being promised, or any specific description of exactly what part of the land Lira would receive.Â  \r\nWe also find the evidence insufficient in proving reasonable reliance upon the promise.Â  Lira testified he expended $25,000 in making improvements on the property, such as dredging the pond, fixing a road, and planting trees.Â  Lira further alleged he paid approximately $25,000 in cash to Mixon for purchase of the property; however, the record is devoid of any testimony by Lira that he paid Mixon this amount.Â  Although Lira claimed these expenditures, he did not put forth any documentation or receipts.Â  Accordingly, we find the special referee correctly found that Lira did not establish his ownership to the property based on the doctrine of promissory estoppel.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Property Interest Extinguished\r\nLira asserts the special referee erred in holding that the death of Mixon extinguished any interest Lira had in the subject property.Â  We disagree.\r\nMrs. Blackmonâ€™s father deeded the property to Mixon and Mrs. Blackmon â€œas tenants in common, for and during their joint lives, and upon the death of either of them, then to the survivor of them, his or her heirs and assigns, forever, in fee simple, together with every contingent remainder and right of reversion.â€Â  \r\nâ€œIn construing a deed it is elementary that the cardinal rule of construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the parties, unless that intention contravenes some well settled rule of law or public policy.â€Â  Sandy Island Corp. v. T.S. Ragsdale, 246 S.C. 414, 420, 143 S.E.2d 803, 806 (1965).Â  â€œA tenancy in common with benefit of survivorship is a case which may exist, without being a joint tenancy, because survivorship is not the only characteristic of a joint tenancy.â€Â  Davis v. Davis, 223 S.C. 182, 186, 75 S.E.2d 46, 48 (1953) (citation omitted).Â  â€œWhile the right of survivorship is not an incident to an estate in common, it may be annexed thereto if the parties so desire.â€Â  Id. at 187, 75 S.E.2d at 48 (citation omitted).Â  Davis further provides:\r\n\r\n  If the intention was to create a tenancy in common for life, with cross remainders for life, with remainder in fee to the ultimate survivor, a joint tenancy would not accomplish the purpose because the right of survivorship may be defeated by a conveyance by any joint tenancy but the vested cross-remainders and, in general, the contingent ultimate remainders are indestructible.\r\n\r\nId. at 187, 75 S.E.2d at 48 (citation omitted).Â  \r\nThe language in the deed conveying the property to Mixon and Mrs. Blackmon created a life estate in both of them, with the fee interest going to the surviving tenant.Â  Thus, Mixon and Mrs. Blackmon were contingent remaindermen in the property, with the contingency being survival.Â  Because Mixon predeceased Mrs. Blackmon, his property interest was extinguished at the time of his death.Â  Therefore, the special referee properly held the most Mixon could have conveyed to Lira was a life estate that terminated at Mixonâ€™s death.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Quantum Meruit\r\nAs an alternative argument to asserting title, Lira claims the special referee erred in failing to compensate him for the value of improvements he made pursuant to the doctrine of quantum meruit.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe equitable doctrine of quantum meruit allows an aggrieved party to recover for unjust enrichment. Columbia Wholesale Co. v. Scudder May N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129, 130 (1994).Â  The following elements are necessary to prevail on this claim:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; benefit conferred by plaintiff upon the defendant;\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; realization of that benefit by the defendant; and\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it without paying its value.\r\n\r\nMyrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 8-9, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000).[5]  \r\nThe measure of recovery in a quantum meruit action is the amount the court considers the defendant has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.Â  Stringer Oil Co. v. BoBo, 320 S.C. 369, 373, 465 S.E.2d 366, 369 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Based on this measure of recovery set forth in Stringer, we find Lira failed to put forth evidence of his damages or any enrichment to the Blackmons because of his changes to the property.Â  The improvements were not for the benefit of the Blackmons.Â  For example, Lira testified he repaired the road for his own benefit.Â  Mrs. Blackmon also testified some of the changes Lira made to the property were not to her liking and would have to be removed.Â  Furthermore, Lira failed to present evidence establishing any increase in value to the property based on his improvements.Â  Nor did he submit documentation verifying that he expended $25,000 for the improvements.Â  Thus, we find the special referee correctly held Lira could not recover damages under either quantum meruit standard.\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Betterments Statute\r\nLira asserts the special referee erred in finding that he failed to establish any right to be compensated for the reasonable value of the improvements to the property pursuant to the Betterments Statute. \r\nThe primary code section of the Betterments Statute provides:\r\n\r\n  After final judgment in favor of the plaintiff in an action to recover lands and tenements, if the defendant has purchased the lands and tenements recovered in such action or taken a lease thereof or those under whom he holds have purchased a title to such lands and tenements or taken a lease thereof, supposing at the time of such purchase such title to be good in fee or such lease to convey and secure the title and interest therein expressed, such defendant shall be entitled to recover of the plaintiff in such action the full value of all improvements made upon such land by such defendant or those under whom he claims, in the manner provided in this chapter.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-27-10 (1991).Â  Based on this statutory language, the individual claiming the betterments must demonstrate a belief that his title is good in fee.Â  Reaves v. Stone, 231 S.C. 628, 633, 99 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1957).Â  \r\nFor Lira to have prevailed on this claim, he was required to show his honest belief that he secured good title to the property and was the rightful owner.Â  We find the special referee correctly determined Lira did not demonstrate such good faith belief.Â  Not only did Lira fail to testify regarding his belief that he owned the land, but there was evidence in the record that directly contradicted any such belief.Â  The letter in which Lira requested an extension of time to vacate, instead of asserting ownership, was in direct contravention of any belief of ownership.Â  Lira also inquired about the new owner of the property in order that he could make a deal to procure the property.Â  Furthermore, the record reflects Lira did not pay to live on the land and he did not pay taxes or insurance on the property.\r\nEven assuming Lira established a good faith belief that he was the rightful owner of the property, he failed to prove damages under the Betterments Statute.Â  The measure of recovery under the statute is the difference in the fair market value of the property before the improvements and after the improvements.Â  Butler v. Lindsey, 293 S.C. 466, 475, 361 S.E.2d 621, 626 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Section 27-27-20 provides:\r\n\r\n  The sum which such land shall be found at the time of the rendition of such judgment to be worth more, in consequence of improvements so made, than it would have been had no such improvements or betterments been made shall be deemed to be the value of such improvements or betterments.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-27-20 (1991).\r\nTherefore, to recover under the Betterments Statute, Lira was required to show the value of his improvements and present evidence from which a finder of fact could determine the value of the land with the improvements and without the improvements.Â  Hall v. Boatwright, 58 S.C. 544, 547, 36 S.E. 1001, 1002 (1900); see Dunham v. Davis, 232 S.C. 175, 183, 101 S.E.2d 278, 282 (1957) (â€œThe increase or enhancement in value in consequence of the improvements is the measure of the equitable compensation.â€); Howard v. Kirton, 144 S.C. 89, 98, 147 S.E. 39, 42 (1928) (interpreting the Betterments Statute and stating, â€œ[t]he full value, therefore, does not mean the cost of such improvements, or the value thereof, as of the time they were made, but their value at the time of the final judgment in ejectmentâ€).Â  The special referee properly denied recovery under the Betterments Statute.Â  Although Lira testified he expended $25,000 in making improvements, he failed to present any documentation of these expenditures.Â  He also failed to offer evidence regarding the value of the land before and after the improvements.Â  As a result, his claim for recovery under the Betterments Statute must fail.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the special referee properly found that Lira did not have title to the subject property and was not entitled to be compensated for the improvements to the property. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the special referee is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  The deed provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  TO HAVE AND TO HOLD, all and singular the said Premises before mentioned unto the said\r\n  Lloyd B. Mixon, Jr. and Linda Keels Mixon \r\n  as tenants in common, for and during their joint lives and upon the death of either of them, then to the survivor of them, his or her heirs and assigns, forever, in fee simple, together with every contingent remainder and right of reversion, and I do hereby bind myself and my Heirs, Executors and Administrators, to warrant and forever defend all and singular the said Premises unto the said Lloyd B. Mixon, Jr. and Linda Keels Mixon as hereinabove provided from and against myself and my Heirs and any person or persons whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same, or any part thereof. \r\n\r\n[2]Â Â  The â€œBetterments Statuteâ€ is codified at South Carolina Code of Laws sections 27-27-10 to -100 (1991).\r\n[3]Â Â  Lira claimed he made the following improvements to the property:Â  (1) dredging a pond; (2) building a retaining wall around the pond; (3) dragging and paving a roadway into the property; (4) cutting a driveway into the property and paving it; (5) placing a mobile home upon the property and permanently anchoring it to the property; and (6) planting trees and shrubs. \r\n[4]Â  Blackmon asserts this issue is not preserved for our review because Lira did not raise it in his pleadings.Â  We find, however, that Lira timely raised this argument.Â  In Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C. 477, 482-84, 570 S.E.2d 535, 538-39 (Ct. App. 2002), this court extended the doctrine of promissory estoppel to apply to cases where real property is claimed.Â  This decision was issued on August 19, 2002, the same day as the hearing before the special referee.Â  Subsequently, Lira raised the issue regarding promissory estoppel in his post-trial brief to the special referee.Â  He again raised the issue in his Rule 59(e) motion, alleging that the special referee failed to consider this claim.Â  Because Lira raised this issue in a timely manner with respect to the issuance of Satcher, we choose to address his argument.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (recognizing that to preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must be (1) raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, (2) by the appellant, (3) in a timely manner, and (4) with sufficient specificity). \r\n[5]Â  We note the special referee erred in using the quantum meruit standard set forth in Muller v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 303 S.C. 137, 143, 399 S.E.2d 430, 434 (Ct. App. 1990) (listing the following four elements of quantum meruit as follows:Â  (1) valuable services or materials were furnished; (2) for the person sought to be charged; (3) the services and materials were accepted, used, and enjoyed by the person sought to be charged; and (4) under such circumstances as reasonably notified the person receiving the services or materials that the plaintiff, in furnishing such services or materials, expected to be paid for them by the person sought to be charged), overruled by Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 8-9, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000).Â  The error, however, was not raised by Lira.Â  Thus, it is the law of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (stating an unappealed ruling is the law of the case).Â  In any event, it is of no consequence due to our finding in agreement with the special referee that Lira failed to prove his damages. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-596","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  George W. Gee was convicted of criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature (CDVHAN) and sentenced to ten years imprisonment, suspended upon the service of nine months and five years probation.Â  Gee appeals, arguing the trial court erred in allowing a police officer to testify about the victimâ€™s statement because it was hearsay and not an excited utterance.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 8, 2002, Gee and his wife, Becky, went with friends to a local bar to watch a band.Â  Gee and Becky both became intoxicated, and their friends drove them home early in the morning on February 9th.Â  Around 7:00 a.m., Becky appeared at her neighborâ€™s house crying, doubled-over in pain, and with obvious bruises on her face and mouth.Â  Becky informed the neighbor that she and Gee had been fighting and Gee had hit her over the course of several hours.Â  The neighbor and Becky arrived at the hospital around 7:30 a.m., where she was treated for bruises, multiple broken ribs, and a life-threatening punctured and collapsed lung injury.Â  While at the hospital, Becky informed the triage nurse that Gee had beaten her for several hours.Â  The police were called, Officer Roderick Adams arrived to speak with Becky at around 7:40 a.m., and Becky gave a statement to Adams within a short amount of time, after initially being unable to speak with him.Â  Becky described the fight in detail.Â  The neighbor, the triage nurse, Adams, and two treating physicians all testified that Becky was extremely upset, anxious, and crying while she was at the hospital.Â  Becky was not released from the hospital until February 14th.Â  \r\nWith Beckyâ€™s consent and after obtaining a search warrant, Adams went to search the coupleâ€™s home immediately after talking to Becky.Â  Adams discovered obvious signs of a struggle, blood specks on the floor, the telephone pulled out from the wall, and Gee passed out in his bed with blood on his knuckles.Â  Gee was arrested for CDVHAN.\r\nAt trial, the State asked Officer Adams to inform the jury what Becky told him when she was in the hospital.Â  Gee objected to the statement as hearsay, but the trial court overruled the objection, finding the statement was an excited utterance.Â  Adams testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  She told me they had been to Dinoâ€™s and they got in an argument while they were at the bar and both had been drinking . . . She told me on the way home they had started â€“ she told me the argument actually started on the way home.Â  And once they got back to their house on Fauna Wood, they got in the house and thatâ€™s when he struck her with an open palm, slapped her on the side of the face.Â  Thatâ€™s what she started saying.Â  And then she â€“ like I say, more and more she talked and more and more she started crying becoming more tearful. . . She said he did that.Â  And she was trying to get away.Â  She ran and tried to lock herself in the restroom, which when you walk in the door, itâ€™s on the right side of the â€“ you go to the right.Â  She said she tried to lock herself in the restroom.Â  He came in there and struck her, struck her again.Â  I donâ€™t remember exactly where he struck her at the time he was in the restroom. And she got back out.Â  And she went through the kitchen area like through the living area of the house.Â  And when she was trying to get out, she finally made her way to the front door.Â  Thatâ€™s when he got her and kicked her there.Â  She said he was kicking her in the ribs repeatedly.Â  \r\n\r\nBecky testified that she was grossly intoxicated at the bar and did not recall the events after her friends dropped her and Gee off at their house, with the exception of a feeling that she was being kicked by someone wearing sandals.Â  Becky admitted that Gee owned sandals.Â  She stated that she recalled going to the neighborâ€™s house because she could not breathe, but she did not recall giving statements to the triage nurse or Adams.Â  According to Becky, she and Gee were getting along well that evening, and Gee had never hit her.Â  The three friends who accompanied Gee and Becky to the bar all testified that Becky and Gee were getting along well that night and Becky fell down twice.Â  None of the three noticed any bruising or that she had problems breathing.Â  Gee also testified that he and Becky were extremely intoxicated, that he fell on top of her when he attempted to help her to bed, and that he had no idea she was injured.Â  The jury found Gee guilty of CDVHAN, and Gee appeals his conviction and sentence.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nGee asserts the trial court erred in admitting the statement Becky made to Officer Adams because:Â  it was made an hour or two after the event; Becky spoke with two other people before speaking with Adams; the statement was not a short, spontaneous utterance; and the statement was unreliable.Â  Thus, Gee argues, the trial court erred in not finding the statement to be hearsay.Â  We disagree.\r\nDecisions on the admissibility of evidence lie within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to prejudice to the opposing party.Â  State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000); State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 228, 522 S.E.2d 845, 851 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  An â€œexcited utteranceâ€ is an exception to the hearsay rule.Â  Rule 803(2), SCRE.Â  In order for a statement to constitute an excited utterance, the statement:Â  must relate to a startling event or condition; must be made while the declarant is still under the stress or the excitement; and the excitement or stress must be caused by the startling event.Â  Rule 803(2), SCRE; see State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 21, 558 S.E.2d 518, 521 (2002) (defining an excited utterance).Â  Whether a statement is an excited utterance is a decision within the trial courtâ€™s discretion, and the trial court makes this determination after considering the totality of the circumstances.Â  Sims, 348 S.C. at 20-21, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  \r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s decision to admit the statement.Â  Beckyâ€™s injuries certainly were the result of a â€œstartling event.â€Â  She was still suffering from the stress of the beating when she arrived at the hospital.Â  Officer Adams arrived at the hospital within a short time after Beckyâ€™s arrival.Â  Adams testified that Becky was still upset when he first attempted to speak with her, he went into the hallway to speak with the neighbor, and then he returned to Becky to take her statement.Â  Several witnesses who saw Becky both before and after Adams took her statement testified that she was extremely upset, anxious, and weeping.Â  Thus, there was evidence that Beckyâ€™s statement related to a startling event, was made while she was still under the stress of the event, and the stress was caused by the startling event.Â  Based on the totality of the circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the statement was an excited utterance and admissible at trial.Â Â Â  \r\nFurther, even assuming it was error for the trial court to admit the statement, any error would be deemed harmless.Â  Without any objection, both the neighbor and the triage nurse testified that Becky stated Gee caused her injuries.Â  Thus, although Beckyâ€™s statement to Adams was more extensive than her statements to the neighbor or the triage nurse, the statement given to Adams identifying Gee was merely cumulative to other evidence admitted at trial.Â  See State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 197, 577 S.E.2d 445, 448-49 (2003) (holding that the admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely cumulative to other evidence). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the statement was an excited utterance and in admitting it.Â  Thus, Geeâ€™s conviction is\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-598","title":"The Anchor Bank. v.

Lockemy, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-598\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2004 â€“ Filed November 30, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Mac Babb, of Calabash, North Carolina, for Appellant.\r\n        Frank H. Durant, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action by a lender, respondent Anchor Bank, to collect money from the guarantor of a promissory note in default, appellant Mac Babb, we find the circuit courtâ€™s award of attorney fees was not an abuse of discretion.Â  Additionally, we find Babbâ€™s remaining issues unpreserved for appellate review.\r\nFACTS/DISCUSSION\r\nIn 1994, The Anchor Bank, as successor to First Atlantic Bank, sued Mac Babb as guarantor of a promissory note that Thomas Crowley had given First Atlantic.Â  In July 1999, a jury found Babb liable to Anchor Bank under his guarantee.Â  The court subsequently awarded Anchor Bank attorneyâ€™s fees of $3,732.97, which was fifteen percent of the total debt.Â  Babb made a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), arguing he had proven his defense â€œbeyond a reasonable doubt.â€Â  The court denied the motion.Â  Babb also made a motion for new trial nisi remittitur, which the court granted with respect to limiting certain interest accrued on the promissory note during the pendency of litigation.\r\nBabb appeals, first arguing the circuit court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute.Â  However, Babbâ€™s arguments are conclusory and unsupported by authority.Â  Thus, we deem them abandoned.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (finding an appellant was deemed to have abandoned issue for which he failed to provide any argument or supporting authority).\r\nNext, Babb argues the circuit court erred in allowing the case to proceed where alterations to the note allegedly extinguished his obligation under the note.Â  He further contends the circuit court improperly allowed the case to proceed because there purpotedly was no consideration paid by Anchor Bank in exchange for the renewal note and no meeting of the minds.Â  Babb first raised these issues in his JNOV motion.Â  However, a JNOV motion â€œis available to one suffering an adverse ruling of the jury only when the same issues were submitted to the judge at the directed verdict stage.â€Â  Smith v. Ridgeway Chems., Inc., 302 S.C. 303, 305-06, 395 S.E.2d 742, 743-44 (Ct. App. 1990); Rule 50, SCRCP.Â  Because Babb did not first raise these issues in a directed verdict motion, they are unpreserved for appellate review.\r\nFinally, Babb argues the circuit court erred in awarding Anchor Bank attorneyâ€™s fees equal to fifteen percent of Babbâ€™s liability under the note.Â  We disagree.Â  As a general rule, the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to be awarded in a particular case is within the discretion of the circuit court.Â  Baron Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 385-86, 377 S.E.2d 296, 298 (1989).Â  The award must be reasonable.Â  Id.Â  There are six factors for the court to consider when determining an award of attorneyâ€™s fees: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 308, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997).Â Â  \r\nUnder the promissory note guaranteed by Babb, Anchor Bank is entitled to â€œreasonable attorneyâ€™s fees . . . not to exceed fifteen (15%) percent of the unpaid debt after default OR in the maximum amount prescribed by South Carolina Law, whichever is greater.â€Â  The trial court questioned Anchor Bankâ€™s attorney regarding his fees.Â  After considering â€œthe nature of the services rendered . . ., the totality of the circumstances concerning the representat[ion] . . ., the reputation [of Anchor Bankâ€™s counsel]. . ., and the beneficial result obtained in reaching the decision,â€ the circuit court awarded attorneyâ€™s fees under the contract.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees or in the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees it deemed reasonable.[1]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Babb also contends the trial court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees equal to fifteen percent of the debt based on his liability including pre-judgment interest as opposed to the amount owed immediately after default.Â  However, this claim was not raised to or ruled on by the trial court and is, therefore, not preserved for review upon appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-599","title":"State v.

Justice, of Chester, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In January 2003, a jury convicted James Oscar Douglas, Jr., of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) and first-degree burglary in connection with the shooting of Carl Edward Bennett and the invasion of Bennettâ€™s home.Â  Douglas appeals, arguing two statements made by the State during its closing argument improperly mischaracterized Bennettâ€™s defense arguments.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn January 2002, Douglas was charged with one count each of first-degree burglary and assault and battery with intent to kill in connection with the September 2001 shooting of Carl Edward Bennett and the unlawful nighttime entry of Bennettâ€™s home.Â  At trial, Bennett and his girlfriend provided eyewitness testimony identifying Douglas as one of the people who forcibly entered Bennettâ€™s house and repeatedly shot him.Â  In addition, Theotis Hall testified that within a few hours following the incident Douglas admitted shooting Bennett.Â  Douglas presented an alibi defense.\r\nIn closing arguments, Douglasâ€™s counsel said: \r\n\r\n  â€œWhatâ€™s missing?Â  Quite a bit, actually, quite a bit.Â  For one thing, that man got shot, where are the guns?Â  That man got shot, where are the shell casings?Â  That man got shot, where is the ballistics report, if there is a ballistics report?Â  That man got shot, how about fingerprint evidence?Â  Because if that manâ€™s fingerprints â€“ Mr. Douglasâ€™ fingerprints were found in that residence from that â€¦ crime scene, that would be pretty good evidence that he must have been there.â€\r\n  Now, fiber evidence is available sometimes, footprint evidence, shoe print imprints, tire prints as people go and forensic laboratory kinds of stuff, none of which has been presented.Â  So that means one of two things, either it doesnâ€™t exist or if it does exist nothing could be done with it, either way itâ€™s not in front of you.Â  So you have to decided [sic] without and what are you left with is testimony.Â  And the only evidence that has actually physically been admitted are statements â€“ prior statements which we put in, statements having been given by Stateâ€™s witnesses.Â  You do not even have the benefit, ladies and gentlemen, of a diagram of the inside of the house.\r\n\r\nLater, in its closing argument, the State made the following statement:\r\n\r\n  Now, [Douglas] would have you believe that the State is trying to hide something from you, that thereâ€™s some magical part of this case out there that you havenâ€™t seen.Â  Well, no there isnâ€™t.\r\n\r\nDouglas objected, stating, â€œI have not implied that the State is trying to hide anything, quite the contrary.â€Â  The trial court responded, stating, â€œAll right.Â  Well, I believe heâ€™s on closing, Iâ€™m going to overrule your objection and give him some latitude.Â  Just please confine your closings, though, to the facts in the record and inferences which may be drawn therefrom.â€Â  The State then immediately began presenting the facts of the case.Â  \r\nThe State later argued, â€œ[Douglasâ€™s counsel] says, â€˜Well, thereâ€™s no photographs.Â  Thereâ€™s no physical evidence so that means it didnâ€™t happen.â€™â€Â  Douglas objected, stating, â€œI never said it didnâ€™t happen.Â  I simply said they canâ€™t determine identity of the people involved from forensic evidence.â€Â  The trial court overruled Douglasâ€™s objection, stating, â€œHe has the right to interpret the evidence and argue in the light consistent with the testimony and the evidence in his argument.â€Â  With that, the State shifted its argument toward an emphasis on the importance of witness testimony.\r\nThe jury convicted Douglas of Burglary-1st and ABHAN.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nDouglas argues that two statements made by the State during its closing argument improperly mischaracterized his defense.Â  We find no error as to the first statement and no reversible error as to the second statement. \r\nâ€œIt is well settled that the trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining the propriety of the solicitorâ€™s argument, and [its] ruling will be upheld where there is not [an] abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Raffaldt, 318 S.C. 110, 114-15, 456 S.E.2d 390, 393 (1995).Â  To merit reversal on appeal, an appellant must show he did not receive a fair trial and that a particular comment so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  State v. Brown, 333 S.C. 185, 191, 508 S.E.2d 38, 41 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Additionally, â€œany alleged impropriety must be examined on appeal in light of the entire record.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere, in both the first and second challenged statements, the circuit court deemed the arguments proper, leaving the State free to continue pursuing these lines of argument.Â  However, in both instances the State immediately moved to other lines of argument.Â  \r\nWhile we find the trial court properly overruled the first objection, we agree with Douglas that the second challenged statement constituted improper argument.Â  We do not believe, however, that the error rises to the level of reversible error.Â  As noted, the State promptly abandoned the challenged argument.[1]Â  Based on our view of the entire record, we do not find that the circuit courtâ€™s failure to sustain Douglasâ€™s objection to the argument in question â€œso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.â€Â  State v. Brown, supra. We find Douglas received a fair trial.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We further note that the jury had the benefit of Douglasâ€™s response to the Stateâ€™s argument through counselâ€™s speaking objection, i.e., â€œI never said it didnâ€™t happen.Â  I simply said they canâ€™t determine identity of the people involved from forensic evidence.â€Â  This reply to the jury by Douglasâ€™s counsel, disguised as an objection to the court, mitigates against a finding of prejudice resulting from the improper argument. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
