Bowers, of Estill; for Appellant-Respondent.\r\nJohn S. Nichols, of Columbia; William Randall Phipps, of Hilton \r\n  Head Island; for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action for \r\n  separate maintenance and support, the family court divided the marital property \r\n  equally and ruled Luella H. Bauer (â€œWifeâ€) was not entitled to alimony.Â  In \r\n  addition, the family court ordered the parties to have the marital home appraised \r\n  before Wife was to purchase Richard K. Bauerâ€™s (â€œHusbandâ€) interest or to immediately \r\n  list the home for sale.Â  For more than six months after the home was appraised,Â  \r\n  Wife failed to list it for sale.Â  In a subsequent order, the family court awarded \r\n  Husband post-judgment interest for the time period from the date sixty days \r\n  after the appraisal until the date the house was listed for sale.Â  Wife appeals, \r\n  arguing the family court erred by failing to award her alimony and by not considering \r\n  certain facts that supported her claim for alimony.Â  Husband appeals, arguing \r\n  the family court should have awarded him post-judgment interest from the date \r\n  of the order, or the date of the appraisal, until the date the home was sold.Â  \r\n  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHusband and Wife were married on December \r\n  6, 1958.Â  The parties separated in January 1999 because Wife believed Husband \r\n  was having an affair.Â  An order for separate maintenance and support was issued \r\n  January 20, 2000.Â  The family court ordered the marital assets to be equally \r\n  divided between the parties.Â  Because Wife desired the marital home as part \r\n  of the equitable distribution, the family court gave Wife sixty days to purchase \r\n  Husbandâ€™s interest or to list the home for sale.Â  The family court declined \r\n  to award alimony to either party.Â  \r\n Both parties filed motions for reconsideration, \r\n  and an amended final order was issued on April 12, 2000.Â  In the amended order, \r\n  the family court stated â€œsince both parties are retired and the assets have \r\n  been divided equally, including the IBM defined benefit annuity, neither party \r\n  is entitled to alimony from the other.â€Â  The family court also required that \r\n  a new appraisal of the home be conducted before Wife purchased Husbandâ€™s interest.Â  \r\n  After the parties obtained an appraisal, Wife was ordered to purchase Husbandâ€™s \r\n  interest or â€œimmediatelyâ€ list the home for sale. \r\nOn May 30, 2000, the home was appraised \r\n  at $315,000.00.Â  On December 22, 2000, after failing to obtain financing or \r\n  to sell the marital home herself, Wife listed the home with a real estate agent.Â  \r\n  During the next six months, the parties received two offers to purchase the \r\n  home.Â  The first offer of $325,000.00 was rejected.Â  Husband and Wife agreed \r\n  to accept the second offer of $340,000.00 and entered into a contract to sell \r\n  the home on June 25, 2001.Â Â  \r\nBoth parties appealed the amended order.Â  Because \r\n  several issues needed clarification, including post-judgment interest, the appeals \r\n  were stayed, and the matter was remanded for a hearing before the family court.Â  \r\n  Husband later abandoned his appeal of the amended order.Â  \r\nOn remand, the family court held a hearing \r\n  and filed its final order on October 16, 2001.Â  In the order, the family court \r\n  ruled the IBM income would be divided evenly between the parties.Â  The family \r\n  court also ordered Wife to pay post-judgment interest on Husbandâ€™s share of \r\n  the marital home for the time period when she failed to list the home for sale \r\n  as required by the amended order.Â  Husband appealed the family courtâ€™s order \r\n  on remand.Â  Husbandâ€™s and Wifeâ€™s appeals were consolidated for review.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Â Â Â Â Â  Wifeâ€™s Appeal\r\nWife argues the family court erred by failing to \r\n  award her alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe decision to grant or deny alimony rests within \r\n  the discretion of the family court . . . . [and] will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent abuse thereof.â€Â  Dearbury v. Dearbury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 \r\n  S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).\r\nIn making an award of alimony, the family court \r\n  must consider and weigh the following factors: (1) â€œduration of the marriage;â€Â  \r\n  (2) physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) â€œeducational backgroundâ€ \r\n  of the parties; (4) â€œemployment history and earning potentialâ€ of the parties; \r\n  (5) â€œstandard of living established during the marriage;â€ (6) â€œcurrent and reasonably \r\n  anticipated earningsâ€ of the parties; (7) â€œcurrent and reasonably anticipated \r\n  expensesâ€ of the parties; (8) â€œmarital and nonmarital properties of the parties;â€ \r\n  (9) â€œcustody of the children;â€ (10) â€œmarital misconduct or fault;â€ (11) â€œtax \r\n  consequences;â€ (12) prior support obligations; and (13) â€œother factors the court \r\n  considers relevant.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)(1)-(13) (Supp. 2002).Â  \r\nâ€œOur inquiry on appeal is not whether the family \r\n  court gave the same weight to particular factors as this court would have; rather, \r\n  our inquiry extends only to whether the family court abused its considerable \r\n  discretion in assigning weight to the applicable factors.â€ Allen v. Allen, \r\n  347 S.C. 177, 186, 554 S.E.2d 421, 425 (Ct. App. 2001); see S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (stating that in making an award of alimony, the family court \r\n  must consider all relevant factors and â€œgive weight in such proportion as it \r\n  finds appropriateâ€ to these factors); see also Long v. Long, 247 \r\n  S.C. 250, 252, 146 S.E.2d 873, 875 (1966) (â€œThe [decision to award] alimony \r\n  is [a] matter with[in] the discretion of the trial judge, to be exercised in \r\n  the light of the facts of each particular case, and will not be disturbed on \r\n  appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown.â€). Â \r\nIn deciding not to award alimony in the present \r\n  case, the family court considered the following factors outlined in section \r\n  20-3-130: (1) the parties had been married for forty years; (2) Wife was 65 \r\n  years old; Husband was 67 years old; and both parties were in reasonably good \r\n  health; (3) Wife obtained her Masterâ€™s degree in psychology while Husband had \r\n  a Bachelorâ€™s degree in psychology; (4) Wife was predominantly a homemaker during \r\n  the course of the marriage while Husband was a retired IBM executive, and neither \r\n  had any future earning potential; (5) the parties maintained a moderate standard \r\n  of living during the marriage; (6) Wife had a monthly income of $1,318.03 and \r\n  Husband had an income of $1,998.03; (7) the current expenses of each party exceeded \r\n  current income, with Wife having a monthly deficit of $509.36 and Husband having \r\n  a monthly deficit of $424.97; (8) the parties owned a marital home located on \r\n  Hilton Head Island valued at $290,000.00, [1]  as well as various savings accounts, investment accounts, retirement \r\n  accounts, and insurance policies valued at approximately $300,000.00; (9) the \r\n  parties have five children, each of whom had reached the age of majority; and \r\n  (10) no marital misconduct by either party was substantiated. Â \r\nBecause the family court reviewed the factors outlined in \r\n  section 20-3-130, we conclude the family court considered the appropriate factors \r\n  in deciding not to award alimony. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C).Â  \r\n  Furthermore, based on our review of the record, we hold the family court did \r\n  not abuse its discretion. See Allen, 347 S.C. at 186, 554 S.E.2d \r\n  at 425.\r\nIn addition to arguing the family court erred by failing \r\n  to award her alimony, Wife also argues the family court did not consider certain \r\n  facts that supported her claim for alimony.Â  First, she contends the family \r\n  court failed to consider that she received less Social Security income than \r\n  Husband. We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn determining the overall earnings of Wife and Husband, \r\n  the family court considered each partyâ€™s monthly Social Security income and \r\n  monthly allotment from the IBM annuity.Â  Wife received a monthly Social Security \r\n  income of $554.00, and Husband received a monthly Social Security income of \r\n  $1,234.00.Â  Because the family court ordered Husbandâ€™s $1,528.05 monthly allotment \r\n  from the IBM annuity to be evenly divided between the parties, each received \r\n  $764.03 a month from the annuity.Â  Using these figures, the family court determined \r\n  Wife had a monthly income of $1,318.03, while Husband had an income of $1,998.03 \r\n  per month. Thus, contrary to Wifeâ€™s argument, the family court considered the \r\n  difference in Social Security income in determining not to award alimony.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  we have reviewed the record in light of the fact that the family court may â€œgive \r\n  weight in such proportion as it finds appropriateâ€ to each of the factors outlined \r\n  in section 20-3-130. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C).Â  Based on our \r\n  review, we hold there was no abuse of discretion. \r\nLastly, Wife argues the family court erred by failing to \r\n  consider she would be required to pay approximately $150.00 more per month to \r\n  maintain her health insurance coverage after a divorce.Â  We disagree.\r\nWith regards to the increase in the cost of Wifeâ€™s \r\n  health benefits upon divorce, Wife testified that after a divorce, her health \r\n  insurance premium would increase from $24.80 per month to $193.18 per month.Â  \r\n  After listening to this testimony, the family court stated in its order, â€œthe \r\n  current expenses of both parties, as reflected in their financial declarations, \r\n  are reasonable and exceed the current income of both parties.â€Â  Therefore, Wife \r\n  cannot claim the family court failed to consider this factor, but instead can \r\n  only argue she disagrees with the weight given to this factor by the family \r\n  court.Â  Because the family court may â€œgive weight in such proportion as it finds \r\n  appropriateâ€ to each of the factors, we have reviewed the record for an abuse \r\n  of discretion and we hold the family court did not abuse its discretion. See \r\n  id.\r\nII. Â Â Â Â  Husbandâ€™s Appeal\r\nHusband argues the family court erred \r\n  by limiting the award of post-judgment interest to the time period beginning \r\n  August 1, 2000, the date sixty days after the court-ordered appraisal was completed, \r\n  and ending December 22, 2000, the date that the home was listed for sale.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nIn awards by the family court, statutory \r\n  post-judgment interest â€œapplies only to money awards entered pursuant to distribution \r\n  when the award is due as payable immediately or at fixed increments.â€ Casey \r\n  v. Casey, 311 S.C. 243, 246, 428 S.E.2d 714, 716 (1993).Â  Post-judgment \r\n  interest shall run until the judgment is paid or otherwise satisfied. See \r\n  Russo v. Sutton, 317 S.C. 441, 444, 454 S.E.2d 895, 896 (1995) (holding \r\n  post-judgment interest accrues on money judgments until the judgment amount \r\n  has been properly deposited with the court pursuant to Rule 67, SCRCP); Rule \r\n  67, SCRCP (stating a judgment debtor may deposit into court all or part of sum \r\n  due on judgment).Â  Thus, post-judgment interest was not a proper consideration. \r\n\r\nWhile the original order gave Wife sixty days to list the \r\n  home for sale, the amended order required Wife to obtain an appraisal of the \r\n  marital home before either purchasing Husbandâ€™s interest or â€œimmediatelyâ€ listing \r\n  the home for sale. In the event Wife listed the home for sale, the net proceeds \r\n  were to be divided equally between Husband and Wife. Â \r\nAlthough the home was appraised on May 30, 2000, Wife did \r\n  not list the home for sale until December 22, 2000, more than 200 days later.Â  \r\n  On remand, the family court determined sixty days was a reasonable time for \r\n  Wife to have looked for financing to purchase Husbandâ€™s interest before listing \r\n  the home for sale.Â  The family court then couched its award as post-judgment \r\n  interest, awarded from August 1, 2000, the time by which Wife should have complied \r\n  with the order, to December 22, 2000, the time Wife actually complied by placing \r\n  the home for sale. \r\nHusband argues he was entitled to post-judgment \r\n  interest from April 12, 2000, the date of the amended order, or from May 31, \r\n  2000, the date of the appraisal, until June 2001, when he received his portion \r\n  of the proceeds from the home. We disagree.Â  \r\nThe proceeds were not payable to Husband until \r\n  June 2001 when the home was sold.Â  Therefore, post-judgment interest is inapplicable \r\n  for the time period prior to the sale.Â  See Casey, 311 S.C. at \r\n  246, 428 S.E.2d at 716.Â  \r\nThe family court ordered Wife to pay Husband interest \r\n  from August 1 to December 22, the time period when it found her to be unreasonable \r\n  in failing to list the home for sale.Â  In doing so, it is clear the family court \r\n  penalized Wife for failing to comply with the order in a timely fashion.Â  The \r\n  award was in the nature of compensatory relief, designed to make Husband whole \r\n  for the lost use of his equity in the home during Wifeâ€™s non-compliance. See \r\n  Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 382, 287 S.E.2d 915, 917 (1982) (â€œThe \r\n  power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts . . . . [and] [i]ts existence \r\n  is essential . . . to the enforcement of the . . . orders . . . of the courts.â€); \r\n  Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop v. Cloyd, 350 S.C. 596, 606, 567 S.E.2d 514, 519 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œCompensatory contempt is a money award for the plaintiff when \r\n  the defendant has injured the plaintiff by violating a previous court order.â€ \r\n  (quoting Curlee, 277 S.C. at 386, 287 S.E.2d at 919)).Â  Because the family \r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Husband interest for the time \r\n  period that it determined Wife failed to comply with the court order, we affirm \r\n  as modified.

Grady Jordan, of Easley, for Appellant.\r\nJames C. Alexander, of Pickens, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Eddie R. Gravley appeals the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s order extending a right-of-way across his property and granting \r\n  an easement by necessity.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nDouglas G. Davis and Brenda F. Davis commenced \r\n  this action against Eddie R. Gravley requesting the court reform their deed \r\n  to establish a right-of-way across Gravleyâ€™s land or, in the alternative, grant \r\n  an easement by necessity.Â  \r\nThe Davises purchased a 15.8-acre tract \r\n  of land from Gravley in 1973.Â  This tract was part of a larger parcel owned \r\n  by Gravley along Highway 11 in Pickens County.Â  At the time of the transfer, \r\n  the tract was intentionally conveyed without means of access and did not connect \r\n  with a public road.Â  The deed stated that it was â€œ[u]nderstood that Grantee \r\n  herein will secure right-of-way from tract herein above described to highway \r\n  from property owners other than grantor.â€Â  To facilitate the sale, Gravley financed \r\n  part of the purchase price for the Davises. The parties do not dispute the terms \r\n  and conditions of this original conveyance.\r\nIn 1976, the parties entered into an agreement \r\n  whereby the Davises would pay off the balance of the purchase price early in \r\n  return for a right-of-way across Gravleyâ€™s property.Â  The Davises asserted Gravley \r\n  sought the payoff in order to build a shop on his land.Â  Gravley, on the other \r\n  hand, testified that the Davises were behind on the mortgage and he sought the \r\n  payoff in lieu of foreclosing.Â  \r\nTo finance the early termination of their \r\n  mortgage with Gravley, the Davises obtained a loan from First National Bank \r\n  of Pickens County by mortgaging the 15.8-acre tract.Â  Mr. Davis stated the loan \r\n  was conditioned on the tract having access to a public road.Â  Mr. Granthem, \r\n  the vice president of the bank at the time the loan was issued, supported this \r\n  testimony by stating that it was the bankâ€™s policy not to issue loans on property \r\n  unless there was clear access to a public road.Â  Gravley also acknowledged he \r\n  was aware the Davises would be unable to get the loan unless they had â€œa right-of-way \r\n  from Highway 11 all the way to [their] property.â€Â  \r\nPursuant to this agreement, on February \r\n  9, 1976, Gravley executed a deed conveying a right-of-way to the Davises.Â  The \r\n  deed states:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, on Jan. 29, 1973, the grantor herein did covey certain \r\n  property to the grantees herein by deed recorded in Book 12-P, page 263, Pickens \r\n  County Records, and WHEREAS, said deed stipulated that grantee therein would \r\n  secure a right of way from property owners other then grantor and WHEREAS, grantor \r\n  now has decided to convey an easement and right of way to the grantees.\r\n\r\nThe deed then sets forth a metes and bounds \r\n  description for the right-of-way to run from Highway 11 across Gravleyâ€™s land \r\n  up to another point on his land.Â  Based on this metes and bounds description, \r\n  however, the right-of-way falls short of connecting the highway to the Davisesâ€™ \r\n  property.Â  The Davises had the land surveyed in 1996 as an attempt at resolving \r\n  a dispute with Gravley about a driveway he was building.Â  According to the Davises, \r\n  it was at this time that they first learned the easement did not extend all \r\n  the way from Highway 11 to their property.Â  \r\nThe primary dispute among the parties \r\n  is whether the right-of-way was intended to extend all the way to the Davisesâ€™ \r\n  property.Â  The Davises assert that the parties intended it to connect their \r\n  property with Highway 11.Â  Gravley contends that the easement was never meant \r\n  to extend from Highway 11 to the Davisesâ€™ property.Â  Gravley testified that \r\n  the Davises wanted to use this partial right-of-way along with a right-of-way \r\n  they were planning to get from the abutting property owner, Mr. Davisâ€™ brother, \r\n  to access their land.Â  \r\nThe trial judge reformed the 1976 deed \r\n  based on a mutual mistake by the parties, thereby extending the right-of-way \r\n  from Highway 11 to the Davisesâ€™ property.Â  In the alternative, the court also \r\n  held that the Davises were entitled to an easement by necessity over Gravleyâ€™s \r\n  property.Â  Gravley argues these ruling were in error.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court err by reforming the deed based on a \r\n  mutual mistake by the parties?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe determination of the existence \r\n  of an easement is a question of fact in a law action and subject to an any evidence \r\n  standard of review when tried by a judge without a jury.â€ Â Slear v. Hanna, \r\n  329 S.C. 407, 410, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998).Â  However, the question of the \r\n  extent of the easement is equitable.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 \r\n  S.C. 318, 323, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997).Â  â€œThus, this court may take its own \r\n  view of the evidence on the latter issue.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œ[T]his broad scope \r\n  of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the trial judge nor \r\n  does it relieve the appellant of the burden of convincing us that the trial \r\n  judge erred.â€Â  Calcutt v. Calcutt, 282 S.C. 565, 569, 320 S.E.2d 55, \r\n  57 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  â€œThe trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was \r\n  in a better position to evaluate their credibility.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGravley first contends the trial court erred by reforming \r\n  the 1976 deed to extend the right-of-way to the Davisesâ€™ property.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nFor equity to reform an instrument, â€œit \r\n  must be shown by clear and convincing evidence not simply that there was a mistake \r\n  by one of the parties, but that there was a mutual mistake.â€Â  Timms v. Timms, \r\n  290 S.C. 133, 137, 348 S.E.2d 386, 389 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  â€œA mutual mistake is \r\n  one whereby both parties intended a certain thing but because of a mistake in \r\n  drafting did not get what they intended.â€Â  Id.\r\nBased on the testimony and evidence presented at trial, the \r\n  trial court found the parties intended for the right-of-way to extend completely \r\n  to the Davisesâ€™ property, and we agree.Â  It is undisputed that the original \r\n  deed conveying the 15.8-acre tract to the Davises did not provide for a right-of-way \r\n  across Gravleyâ€™s property.Â  In fact, the 1973 deed specifically stated that \r\n  it was understood â€œGrantee herein will secure right-of-way from tract herein \r\n  above described to highway from property owners other than grantor.â€Â  However, \r\n  in 1976, as part of an arrangement with the Davises to pay off the balance of \r\n  their mortgage, Gravley granted a right-of-way across his property.Â  The grant \r\n  provided in pertinent part that the â€œgrantor now has decided to convey an easement \r\n  and right of way to the grantees.â€Â  The purpose of the right-of-way, as stated \r\n  in the deed, was to provide â€œingress and egress over lands located in the State \r\n  of South Carolina.â€Â  As the trial court noted, the deed fails to indicate the \r\n  parties intended only a partial right-of-way.Â  Although Gravley testified the \r\n  right-of-way was never intended to completely traverse his property because \r\n  the Davises were going to use the neighboring property, the bulk of evidence \r\n  presented at trial belies this assertion.Â  For instance, both Mr. Davis and \r\n  Mr. Granthem testified the bank would not lend the money necessary to pay off \r\n  Gravley without a right-of-way connecting the parcel to a public road. Gravley \r\n  even acknowledged that he was aware of this requirement at the time of the conveyance.Â  \r\n  Because there is more than enough evidence in the record to support the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s order, we agree the parties intended the right-of-way to extend completely \r\n  from the public road to the Davisesâ€™ property.Â  Therefore, we affirm the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s order reforming the 1976 deed based on the doctrine of mutual mistake.\r\nFurthermore, because we affirm the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision on the grounds of mutual mistake, we do not need to address Gravleyâ€™s \r\n  remaining issue.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., \r\n  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling appellate court need not \r\n  review remaining issues when disposition of prior issues are dispositive). \r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD and KITTREDGE, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-008","title":"Hall v.

Hall appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to defendant \r\n    Anne M. Bell.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\n  FACTS\r\n  The chief complaint in this case \r\n    centers upon Hallâ€™s allegation that Bell committed legal malpractice in failing \r\n    to file an action against Hallâ€™s former employer Commander Nursing Home (â€œCommanderâ€).Â  \r\n    Hall became the subject of an investigation by the South Carolina Board of \r\n    Nursing (the â€œBoardâ€) when Commander notified the Board that it suspected \r\n    Hall of diverting the drug Phenergan from the home. \r\n  Hall hired Bell to represent \r\n    her in August 1997.Â  Bell admits Hall spoke with her about filing an action \r\n    against Commander as well as defending Hall in front of the Board.Â  However, \r\n    Bell maintains she informed Hall they should concentrate on the case before \r\n    the Board first, as a determination by the Board that Hall did divert drugs \r\n    from the home would render a subsequent suit against Commander as moot.Â  At \r\n    no point did Bell agree to bring a suit against Commander on Hallâ€™s behalf.Â  \r\n    Hall does not dispute Bell provided such advice.Â  \r\n  Subsequently, Hall became dissatisfied \r\n    with Bellâ€™s representation.Â  After seeking other representation Hall terminated \r\n    Bellâ€™s employment in March 1998.Â  The Board subsequently dismissed the investigation \r\n    into the Phenergan incident at Commander in Hallâ€™s favor.Â  \r\n  After the Boardâ€™s investigation \r\n    was dismissed, Hall filed suit against Bell alleging three causes of action \r\n    and requesting $5.5 million dollars in damages. \r\n    [2] Â  Hall later amended her complaint alleging two additional causes \r\n    of action.Â  \r\n  Bell moved for summary judgment \r\n    arguing the scope of her employment involved only representing Hall in front \r\n    of the Board.Â  Additionally, Bell argued, even if a genuine issue of fact \r\n    existed, at the time of Hallâ€™s termination of her employment the statute of \r\n    limitations had not elapsed and Hall had retained other counsel.Â  \r\n  The circuit court agreed and \r\n    granted summary judgment in favor of Bell.Â  Hall now appeals.\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  Summary judgment is proper when \r\n    there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is \r\n    entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; South Carolina \r\n    Prop. and Cas.

Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518, 548 S.E.2d 880, \r\n    883 (Ct.App. 2001).Â  To determine whether any material facts exist, the evidence \r\n    and all inferences, which can be reasonably drawn therefrom, must be viewed \r\n    in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Id.Â  Summary judgment \r\n    is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable \r\n    to clarify the application of the law.Â  Id. Â An appellate court reviews \r\n    the granting of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial \r\n    court.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  Hall appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary \r\n    judgment and alleges thirteen instances of error in the trial judgeâ€™s ruling. \r\n    The allegations of error will be grouped into two categories:Â  1) whether \r\n    there are procedural irregularities in circuit courtâ€™s granting Bellâ€™s summary \r\n    judgment motion; and 2) the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment \r\n    as there were genuine issues of material fact.\r\n    I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Procedural Irregularities \r\n     \r\n  Hall asserts there were procedural irregularities \r\n    with regard to the circuit courtâ€™s granting of summary judgment.Â  We will \r\n    address each issue individually.\r\n  Hall first argues error because \r\n    the judge failed to read the case file before conducting the hearing.Â  The \r\n    record reveals the circuit court was familiar with the case and was able to \r\n    conduct a hearing on the matter.Â  It is further apparent that any deficiency \r\n    in knowledge of the facts of the case Hall may have observed at the hearing \r\n    was cured by the circuit courtâ€™s well-reasoned order granting summary judgment.\r\n  Second, Hall argues the circuit \r\n    court erred in granting Bellâ€™s motion for summary judgment, although Bell \r\n    had not yet filed her answer to the supplemental complaint.Â  Hall filed a \r\n    supplemental complaint alleging two additional causes of action on May 23, \r\n    2001.Â  Bell received the complaint on May 25, 2001.Â  The summary judgment \r\n    motion was heard on May 30, 2001.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment \r\n    on the following day.Â  Although nothing in the record reflects Hall had permission \r\n    to amend her complaint, it is apparent from the order granting summary judgment \r\n    the circuit court considered the supplemental complaint and viewed it as alleging \r\n    two additional causes of action arising out of the same set of facts as the \r\n    previous complaint. \r\n  Third, Hall again argues the \r\n    circuit court judge failed to read the filings before reaching its decision.Â  \r\n    The circuit courtâ€™s order states it reviewed the initial complaint, the supplemental \r\n    complaint, and Bellâ€™s answer.Â  Hall does not specify what matters are present \r\n    in those filings that would warrant reversal of the circuit court.Â  Furthermore, \r\n    Hall may not rest on the allegations in her pleadings to create a cause of \r\n    action where those allegations are controverted by affidavits submitted by \r\n    Bell.Â  Yarborough v. Rogers, 306 S.C. 260, 261, 411 S.E.2d 424 (1991).\r\n  Hallâ€™s fourth argument rests \r\n    upon the theory that the circuit court should not have viewed the supplemental \r\n    complaint as amendments to the complaint.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order states:Â  \r\n    â€œAlthough the newly filed Complaint does not purport to amend the original \r\n    complaint, the Court will liberally view the pleading as an amendment that \r\n    adds two causes of action to the original complaint.â€Â  By considering the \r\n    causes of actions from the original and supplemental complaints the circuit \r\n    court benefited Hall by searching the complaints to find a basis on which \r\n    to support her suit.Â  The circuit court did not err in considering both the \r\n    original and supplemental complaint.\r\n  Hallâ€™s fifth argument is that \r\n    Bell made numerous false and ambiguous statements in her submissions to the \r\n    court.Â  Hall further alleges that Bell concealed evidence.Â  Even if we accept \r\n    Hallâ€™s interpretations of Bellâ€™s submissions, it does not undermine the basis \r\n    of the circuit courtâ€™s order on two essential facts: 1) that Bell did not \r\n    agree to sue Commander on Hallâ€™s behalf; and 2) Hall retained other counsel \r\n    prior to the running of any statute of limitations on any viable claim.Â  \r\n  Absent Hallâ€™s ability to show \r\n    that Bell agreed to sue Commander but failed to do so before the statute of \r\n    limitations expired she cannot maintain her action against Bell.Â  We find \r\n    no procedural irregularity on the circuit courtâ€™s behalf.\r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Genuine Issues of Material Fact \r\n     \r\n  Hall first alleges there were \r\n    material issues of fact whether Bellâ€™s scope of representation was limited \r\n    to representation before the Board.Â  We disagree.\r\n  It is clear from the record the \r\n    circuit court was correct in concluding no issue of material fact existed \r\n    over whether the scope of representation included Hallâ€™s suit against Commander.Â  \r\n    First, at the outset of Bellâ€™s representation she had Hall prepare a summary \r\n    of facts of her case.Â  Although the summary does contain a reference to [j1] &nbsp;Hallâ€™s desire to sue Commander, there is nothing \r\n    in the record to deduce that Bell agreed to represent Hall in the matter.Â  \r\n  \r\n  Second, the record demonstrates \r\n    that Bell only agreed to represent Hall during the Boardâ€™s investigation.Â  \r\n    Bell asserts, and is uncontradicted by the record, she informed Hall that \r\n    suing Commander before obtaining a favorable ruling before the Board was not \r\n    effective, as a negative ruling by the Board would render any subsequent suit \r\n    moot.Â  Such statements make clear that Bellâ€™s representation extended only \r\n    to the Board investigation, at least until the conclusion of the case before \r\n    the Board.\r\n  Third, Hallâ€™s own affidavit fails \r\n    to reveal testimony that Bellâ€™s scope of representation extended beyond the \r\n    Board.Â  Additionally, Hallâ€™s own letter to Bell terminating her services states \r\n    as one reason for her action Bellâ€™s â€œlack of encouragement/support [for her] \r\n    desire to file suit against Commander.â€\r\n  Next, Hall asserts the Boardâ€™s \r\n    dismissal of Hallâ€™s case is clear evidence that Bellâ€™s â€œâ€˜Board of Nursing \r\n    caseâ€™ was fictitious, misleading, unfounded, and meritless ... [such that] \r\n    Hallâ€™s time and money were spent in Bellâ€™s pursuit of a case not in existence, \r\n    while Hallâ€™s lawsuit did not receive its proper attention.â€Â  It is clear from \r\n    the record that the case before the Board regarding the misappropriation of \r\n    the Phenergan existed.Â  Finally, the Boardâ€™s investigation against Hall ended \r\n    favorably for Hall.\r\n  Fourth, Hall asserts Bell was incompetent because \r\n    she allowed the statute of limitations to expire before filing a suit against \r\n    Commander.Â  Hall retained counsel to represent her before the statute of limitations \r\n    expired with the only possible exception being applicable to a claim of racial \r\n    discrimination.Â  Hall had 300 days to file a claim with the EEOC to allege \r\n    racial discrimination in employment.Â  See Tinsley v. First Union \r\n    Natâ€™l Bank, 155 F.3d 435, 440 (4th Cir. 1998).Â  Accepting Hallâ€™s \r\n    version of events, the statute of limitations began on July 30, 1997.Â  Bell \r\n    was terminated by Hall and replaced by new counsel on March 12, 1998.Â  Therefore \r\n    225 days elapsed; the statute of limitations had not expired by the time Hall \r\n    retained new counsel.Â  Although South Carolina courts have not addressed this \r\n    issue, other jurisdictions have held an â€œattorney cannot be held liable for \r\n    failing to file an action prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations \r\n    if he ceased to represent the client and was replaced by other counsel before \r\n    the statute ran of the clientâ€™s action.â€Â  Knight v. Myers, 748 P.2d \r\n    896, 902 (Kan. 1998); see also Steketee v. Lintz, 694 \r\n    P.2d 1153, 1159 (Cal. 1985); Harvey v. MacKay, 440 N.E.2d 1022, 1026 \r\n    (Ill. 1982).Â  Accordingly, Bell is not liable for failing to file an action \r\n    where she was replaced by another attorney before the statute of limitations \r\n    expired.Â  \r\n  Finally, Hall asserts the court \r\n    erred in granting summary judgment, as there were material issues of fact \r\n    whether Bell violated the statute of fraud provisions.Â  As this issue was \r\n    neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial court it is not preserved for \r\n    our review.Â  See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Social Servs. v. Father \r\n    and Mother, 294 S.C. 518, 524, 366 S.E.2d 40, 43 fn. 22 (Ct.App. 1988) \r\n    (issue which was not raised below cannot be considered on appeal).Â  \r\n  Even if this issue was preserved, \r\n    Hallâ€™s argument is meritless.Â  The failure to follow the statute of frauds \r\n    does not create a cause of action in tort.Â  Instead, it provides that for \r\n    certain types of agreements to be enforceable under contract law they must \r\n    be in writing.Â  See, e.g., Young v. Indep. Pub. Co., \r\n    273 S.C. 107, 110, 254 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1979).\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  The scope of Bellâ€™s legal representation was limited to the Boardâ€™s \r\n    investigation.Â  Although Hall expressed interest in suing Commander, no evidence \r\n    was presented proving Bell agreed to bring said suit.Â  Additionally, Bell \r\n    did not suffer legal harm as she retained alternate counsel within the statute \r\n    of limitations. Therefore the trial court did not err in granting summary \r\n    judgment.Â  \r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  GOOLSBY, HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Because oral argument would not aid the Court \r\n    in resolving any issue on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument \r\n    pursuant to Rule 215 SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Hall is also suing two lawyers in Sumter County because they \r\n    would not file a civil suit on her behalf.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-009","title":"Lane v.

Rush Jr. of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  The family court granted \r\n  Margie Lane (â€œWifeâ€) and Donald Lane (â€œHusbandâ€) a divorce and apportioned the \r\n  marital property.Â  The apportionment allocated thirty-five percent of the marital \r\n  property to Wife and sixty-five percent to Husband, including the partiesâ€™ marital \r\n  residence.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nWife commenced an action for divorce by filing a summons \r\n  and complaint on March 20, 2000.Â  The complaint prayed for a divorce on grounds \r\n  of adultery, an order requiring Husband to maintain health insurance on Wife, \r\n  apportionment of the marital property, and possession of the marital home.Â  \r\n  Husband answered and counterclaimed, also seeking a divorce on grounds of adultery.Â  \r\n  The family court issued a temporary order, based partially on an agreement between \r\n  the parties, on August 8, 2000.\r\nThe parties were married in 1989.Â  Husband was employed as \r\n  a sergeant with the South Carolina Highway Patrol, while Wife worked part-time \r\n  for her brotherâ€™s cabinet making company.Â  At this point, the parties resided \r\n  with Wifeâ€™s mother in Chesterfield County.Â  Upon Husband receiving a promotion, \r\n  the parties relocated to York, South Carolina.Â  After the relocation to York, \r\n  Wife began working for the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (SCDMV). \r\n  Â She stayed at this position until 1995, when Husband received a second promotion \r\n  to lieutenant colonel, which required relocation to Columbia.Â  From 1995 until \r\n  the end of the marriage, Wife has been unemployed.Â  \r\nThe parties stipulated that the value of the marital estate \r\n  at the time of the hearing was $165,509.40.Â  Of particular importance, the marital \r\n  estate included two pieces of real property:Â  a five-acre tract of land located \r\n  in York County and a lakefront property used as the marital residence, located \r\n  in Summerton, South Carolina.Â  Wife used non-marital funds to purchase both \r\n  pieces of property.Â  Around 1990, Wife used non-marital funds to put a down \r\n  payment on a mobile home that became the marital residence on the lakefront \r\n  property.Â  It appears Wife made the mortgage payments on the mobile home until \r\n  1995, when she left her job at the SCDMV.Â  Husband made the payments from 1995 \r\n  until 1999, when the mortgage was paid in full.\r\nBoth parties contributed to the lakefront property by making \r\n  several improvements.Â  Husband purchased an outdoor storage building, helped \r\n  build porches on the house and a shed on the property, and contributed to the \r\n  purchase price of a dock.Â  In addition to purchasing the property and making \r\n  a down payment on the mobile home, Wife contributed half the price of the dock, \r\n  installed a septic tank system and arranged for both electricity and water services.Â  \r\n\r\nAlthough the lakefront property was initially used only on \r\n  weekends and special occasions, upon Husbandâ€™s relocation to Columbia in 1995, \r\n  the property became Wifeâ€™s primary residence.Â  Wife resided there until June \r\n  of 2000 when the parties separated.Â  During the interim, Husband resided in \r\n  an apartment in Columbia and would make the trip to the lakefront property on \r\n  the weekends.Â  Husband has been living on the lakefront property since the separation \r\n  and has lived there continuously since that time.\r\nIn the divorce decree, dated September 25, 2001, the family \r\n  court granted the parties a divorce on the ground of one-year continuous separation. [2] Â  The court also held that in \r\n  terms of financial contributions, Husband contributed eighty-two percent to \r\n  the marital estate and Wife contributed eighteen percent.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  decree awarded sixty-five percent of the estate to Husband and thirty-five percent \r\n  to Wife.Â  The marital residence (the lakefront property) was included in Husbandâ€™s \r\n  portion of the estate.Â  The court further denied Wifeâ€™s request for an order \r\n  requiring Husband to maintain health insurance on her and awarded her partial \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees of $2500.00.Â  It is from these rulings that Wife appeals.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the family court err in determining the percentage of marital property to \r\n  be apportioned among the parties?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the family court err in awarding the lakefront property to Husband?\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the family court err in refusing to require Husband to continue health insurance \r\n  coverage on Wife?\r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the family court err in giving Wife only a partial award of attorneyâ€™s fees?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has the authority \r\n  to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  \r\n  This broad scope of review does not, however, require this court to disregard \r\n  the factual findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 \r\n  S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Neither are we required to ignore \r\n  the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their \r\n  testimony.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEquitable Distribution \r\n   \r\nWife first contends the family court erred in apportioning \r\n  the marital property.Â  Specifically, she argues the family court judge did not \r\n  give enough consideration to her early contributions to the marriage, the current \r\n  condition of her health, and her lack of any substantial savings or retirement.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe apportionment of marital property is within \r\n  the discretion of the family court judge and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  See Morris v. Morris, 295 S.C. \r\n  37, 39, 367 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).Â  South Carolina Code Ann. section 20-7-472 \r\n  (Supp. 2002) provides the family court must consider fifteen factors and give \r\n  each weight as it determines.Â  On review, this court looks to the fairness of \r\n  the overall apportionment, and if the end result is equitable, the fact that \r\n  this court might have weighed specific factors differently than the family court \r\n  is irrelevant.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300-01, 372 S.E.2d \r\n  107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988); Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 502, 478 S.E.2d 854, \r\n  859 (Ct. App. 1996) (the reviewing court will affirm the family court judgeâ€™s \r\n  apportionment of marital property if it can be determined that the judge addressed \r\n  the relevant factors under section 20-7-472 with sufficiency for the reviewing \r\n  court to conclude the judge was cognizant of statutory factors).\r\nIn this case, the overall distribution was sixty-five percent \r\n  of the estate to Husband and thirty-five percent to Wife.Â  We find, given the \r\n  statutory factors, that this distribution is fair and equitable.Â  Given the \r\n  length of the marriage, the value of the marital property, and the incomes of \r\n  both parties, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its \r\n  distribution of the marital property.Â  In identifying, valuating, and apportioning \r\n  the property, the family court relied upon the testimony and discovery obtained \r\n  from both parties.Â  After examination of both the partiesâ€™ testimony and the \r\n  fifteen statutory factors listed in S.C. Code Ann. section 20-7-472, it is clear \r\n  that the family court divided the marital property in a fair manner.\r\nII.Â  Lake-Front Property\r\nWife next maintains the family court erred by awarding \r\n  the lakefront property to Husband.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAlthough Wife purchased the lakefront property \r\n  with non-marital funds, the parties stipulated it was marital property and agreed \r\n  that whichever party received it, the other party would be awarded the five-acre \r\n  parcel of land in York County.Â  Accordingly, the award of the property was governed \r\n  by the standards for equitable distribution.Â  Because there is evidence in the \r\n  record supporting the family courtâ€™s decision, we find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n\r\nIII.Â  Health Insurance\r\nWife argues the family court erred in allowing \r\n  Husband to drop her from his health insurance.Â  We disagree. \r\nBoth parties agreed at trial to waive any right \r\n  either may have to alimony.Â  Because of this, the family court denied Wifeâ€™s \r\n  request, but ordered Husband to execute whatever documentation might be necessary \r\n  to allow Wife to convert her coverage to COBRA.\r\nIn its order disposing of Wifeâ€™s motion to alter \r\n  or amend the divorce decree, the family court denied Wifeâ€™s request.Â  The court \r\n  correctly noted that to require Husband to maintain health insurance, even at \r\n  Wifeâ€™s expense, â€œwould become an ongoing obligation as a form of spousal support.â€Â  \r\n  Because it is undisputed the parties voluntarily waived alimony, and thus support, \r\n  we find no error.\r\nIV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWifeâ€™s final argument is that the family court \r\n  erred in only granting her a partial award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nA court must consider six factors in determining \r\n  whether to grant attorneyâ€™s fees: â€œ(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of \r\n  the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing \r\n  of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; \r\n  [and] (6) customary legal fees for similar services.â€Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, \r\n  304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991) (citing Donahue v. Donahue, \r\n  299 S.C. 353, 384 S.E.2d 741 (1989)).Â  Additionally, â€œan award of attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by \r\n  the trial court.â€Â  Donahue, 299 S.C. at 365, 384 S.E.2d at 748.\r\nFrom a review of the divorce decree, it is clear \r\n  the family court fairly and equitably considered the necessary factors.Â  The \r\n  court found that the fees and expenses incurred by the respective attorneys \r\n  were reasonable, and that Husband was in a better position to pay the fees.Â  \r\n  In awarding Wife fees, the court considered the fact that Wife abandoned her \r\n  request for alimony on the day of the trial.Â  We conclude the family court properly \r\n  considered the necessary factors.Â  We find no error in its award of partial \r\n  fees to Wife.\r\nAccording, based on the foregoing, the family courtâ€™s \r\n  rulings are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs.\r\nCONNOR, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nCONNOR, J. (dissenting): Although \r\n  I agree with the majorityâ€™s decision regarding the lakefront property, health \r\n  insurance, and attorneyâ€™s fees, I respectfully disagree with its decision to \r\n  affirm the family courtâ€™s determination of each partyâ€™s percentage of the marital \r\n  estate.Â  In my opinion, Husband and Wife should each receive fifty percent of \r\n  the marital estate.Â  Applying the requisite factors outlined in section 20-7-472 \r\n  [3]  to the evidence presented at trial, I believe the family court erred \r\n  in awarding Wife only thirty-five percent of the marital estate.\r\nThe parties were married for almost eleven \r\n  years.Â  Even though the parties were divorced on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous \r\n  separation, there is evidence in the record, by way of Husbandâ€™s admission and \r\n  Wifeâ€™s testimony, that Husbandâ€™s marital misconduct precipitated the partiesâ€™ \r\n  separation.Â  Wife also significantly contributed to the marital estate.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Wife purchased, using her own non-marital funds, a five-acre tract of land in \r\n  York and a lakefront lot in Summerton, South Carolina.Â  She also used non-marital \r\n  funds as a down payment to purchase a mobile home for the lake property.Â  She \r\n  continued to make these payments until 1995 when she stopped working.Â  Additionally, \r\n  she paid for the installation and set up of the mobile home using her non-marital \r\n  funds.Â  Wifeâ€™s current health condition weighs in favor of her need for a greater \r\n  portion of the marital estate.Â  Because Wife suffers from severe fibromyalgia, \r\n  she is unable to maintain full-time employment.Â Â  In addition to Wifeâ€™s limited \r\n  future earnings, she also has no vested retirement and has minimal savings.Â  \r\n  Although Wife did not earn as much income as Husband during the marriage, this \r\n  factor alone is not sufficient to supportâ€™s the family courtâ€™s apportionment \r\n  of the marital estate.Â  Based on the foregoing, I would reverse the family courtâ€™s \r\n  decision and award each party fifty percent of the marital estate.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The parties agreed to dismiss their requests for \r\n    divorce on grounds of adultery.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â Â  Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code of Laws enumerates \r\n    fifteen factors applicable to a determination of equitable distribution.Â  \r\n    These factors are as follows:Â  (1) duration of the marriage; (2) marital misconduct \r\n    or fault and its effect on the break-up of the marriage; (3) the value of \r\n    the marital property and the contribution of each spouse to the acquisition \r\n    or appreciation in value of the marital property, including the contribution \r\n    of the spouse as homemaker; (4) the income and earning potential of each spouse \r\n    and opportunity for future acquisition of assets; (5) the health, both physical \r\n    and emotional, of each spouse; (6) need of either spouse for additional training \r\n    or education; (7) the nonmarital property of each spouse; (8) the existence \r\n    or nonexistence of vested retirement benefits for each spouse; (9) whether \r\n    alimony has been awarded; (10) desirability of awarding the family home; (11) \r\n    the tax consequence to each spouse as a result of the apportionment; (12) \r\n    the existence and extent of any support obligations of either party; (13) \r\n    liens and encumbrances on marital and separate property and other existing \r\n    debts; (14) child custody arrangements and obligations; and (15) any other \r\n    relevant factors as the trial court shall expressly enumerate in its order.Â Â  \r\n    S.C.

Robinson, of Camden, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Gary Gene Melton brought this \r\n  action against his former wife, Deborah J. Melton, seeking a termination or \r\n  reduction in alimony based on his substantial change of circumstances.Â  The \r\n  family court refused to modify Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were divorced in\r\n2001, after thirty-one years of marriage. At the time of the divorce, Husband\r\nhad retired from the military and was employed as a bombing range manager for\r\nthe Dare County Air Force Bombing Range.&nbsp; Between his retirement benefits\r\nand his salary as a bombing range manager, Husband's monthly income was\r\n$5,361.&nbsp; Wife, on the other hand, had a monthly income of approximately\r\n$227, which she earned from rents and from caring for her grandchildren, her\r\nbrother, and her father. [1] &nbsp;&nbsp; The parties agreed Wife was entitled to\r\nhalf of Husband's retirement benefits, and the family court awarded Wife an\r\nadditional $1,000 in alimony per month.\r\n\r\nApproximately four months after the divorce, Husband was terminated from his job\r\nat the bombing range.&nbsp; The month following the loss of his employment,\r\nHusband filed an action with the family court to terminate or reduce his alimony\r\nobligation.&nbsp; By way of counterclaim, Wife sought an order from the family\r\ncourt that required Husband to (1) pay his monthly alimony obligation to the\r\ncourt, (2) submit to a medical exam for life insurance purposes, and (3) pay her\r\nattorney's fees and court costs. A pendente lite hearing was held in November of\r\n2001, and at that time, the family court denied Husband's request for relief\r\n   Two weeks after Husband filed his \r\n    complaint, Wife filed a rule to show cause, alleging Husband was in contempt \r\n    of the divorce decree for failing to pay alimony in a timely fashion.Â  Judge \r\n    Brooks P. Goldsmith continued the rule to show cause and ordered that it be \r\n    heard at the same time as the hearing on the merits for Husbandâ€™s action to \r\n    reduce or terminate alimony.\r\n  In February of 2002, six months after \r\n    being terminated from the bombing range, Husband acquired a job at Miller \r\n    Trophy Room Preservation making ten dollars an hour.Â  Husband also earned \r\n    money from renting out a house and large tract of land he owned. \r\nIn March of 2003, a hearing on the\r\nmerits was held.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the hearing, Husband testified that he\r\nreceived&nbsp; $2,239 per month from his salary at Miller Trophy, $884 per month\r\nin retirement benefits, and $440 per month in rental income.&nbsp; Thus, his\r\ntotal monthly income was $3,563.&nbsp; On Husband's financial declaration, he\r\nlisted $3,767 worth of monthly expenses, which included his monthly alimony\r\nobligation of $1,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe family court found that although the loss of Husband's job was &quot;an\r\nimportant change,&quot; he was not entitled to a reduction in alimony.&nbsp; The\r\ncourt explained that Husband had not only replaced a great deal of his lost\r\nincome, but also that Husband's expenses had decreased significantly since\r\nalimony had originally been set.&nbsp; Specifically, the court noted that\r\nHusband no longer paid $125 a month to rent out a mobile home lot; he no longer\r\npaid $1,061.31 a month for his half of the mortgage on and upkeep for the\r\nmarital home; he no longer paid $238 a month toward his pension; and he no longer paid $177 a month for life \r\n    insurance.Â  Pursuant to its determination not to reduce Husbandâ€™s alimony, \r\n    the family court awarded Wife $4,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  However, the court \r\n    declined to hold Husband in contempt for his failure to make timely alimony \r\n    payments, noting the late payments occurred after Husband initially lost his \r\n    job and finding Husbandâ€™s failure to pay on time was not willful. Â \r\nHusband appeals, arguing the family\r\ncourt erred by not reducing or terminating his alimony and by awarding Wife\r\nattorney's fees.&nbsp;\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n    The family court has the authority to alter \r\n      alimony payments upon a proper showing of a change of condition.Â  S.C. Code \r\n      Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1985).Â  The modification of alimony is within the sound \r\n      discretion of the family court and will not be overturned absent an abuse \r\n      of that discretion.Â  Riggs v. Riggs, 353 S.C. 230, 236, 578 S.E.2d \r\n      3, 6 (2003). \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Reduction or Termination of Alimony\r\nHusband argues the family courtâ€™s failure \r\n  to reduce or terminate his alimony was an abuse of discretion for three reasons.Â  \r\n  First, Husband claims the evidence in the record does not support the courtâ€™s \r\n  finding that his financial condition had not substantially or materially changed.Â  \r\n  Second, Husband argues the family court abused its discretion by focusing only \r\n  on his circumstances rather than the circumstances of both parties.Â  Third, \r\n  Husband alleges the family court erred by considering â€œthe Traxler Alimony guidelinesâ€ \r\n  when making its decision.Â  We disagree with all of these arguments.\r\nIn regard to his financial condition, Husband \r\n  alleges his expenses have increased since the divorce, pointing to the $3,767 \r\n  worth of expenses he has listed on his current financial declaration as compared \r\n  to the $3,484 in monthly expenses he had when alimony was originally set.Â  However, \r\n  included in Husbandâ€™s current financial declaration is his $1,000 alimony obligation.Â  \r\n  Because the family court was asked to reconsider Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation, \r\n  the amount he currently pays in alimony should not be factored in as an expense.Â Â  \r\n  After subtracting the $1,000 from the $3,767 in monthly expenses, Husbandâ€™s \r\n  monthly expenses are $717 less than they had been when alimony was originally \r\n  set.Â  Furthermore, the deductions from Husbandâ€™s gross pay are less now than \r\n  they were at the time of the partiesâ€™ divorce because he no longer pays $373 \r\n  per month toward his pension plan. [2] Â  Thus, Husbandâ€™s expenses and deductions have \r\n  been reduced by nearly $1,100 since the partiesâ€™ divorce. \r\nPursuant to the original divorce decree, Husband \r\n  was required to pay Wife $1,000 in alimony in addition to his agreement to pay \r\n  her half of his retirement benefits, which at the time amounted to $850. After \r\n  paying these sums to Wife, Husband was left with a gross monthly income of $3,511. \r\n  [3] Â  From this monthly income, $373 was deducted to fund his pension. His \r\n  monthly income therefore was $3,138 before taxes, and his monthly expenses were \r\n  $3,484, [4]  leaving him with a $346 deficit each month.Â  \r\n  Now that Husband has a lower paying job, his monthly income isÂ  $3,563, [5]  and his expenses, including alimony, \r\n  are $3,794. [6] Â  Thus, his deficit is only $231 \r\n  per month.Â  Based on these numbers, and despite the fact that Husbandâ€™s expenses \r\n  exceed his income, we agree with the family courtâ€™s finding that there has been \r\n  no material change to Husbandâ€™s financial circumstances.Â Â Â  Eubank v. Eubank, \r\n  347 S.C. 367, 372, 555 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating that, in order \r\n  to justify modification or termination of an alimony award, the changes in circumstances \r\n  must be substantial or material).Â  \r\nHusband also argues the family court erred by \r\n  considering only his circumstances and not the circumstances of both parties.Â  \r\n  We note initially that in Husbandâ€™s pleadings, the only change in circumstance \r\n  he specifically listed was his loss of income.Â  Moreover, the family court did \r\n  consider the Wifeâ€™s circumstances and found her â€œincome and ability to earn \r\n  income [had] not changed.â€Â  The evidence in the record supports this finding, \r\n  and we therefore find no error.Â  \r\nHusband also urges us to reverse the family court \r\n  because it considered â€œthe Traxler alimony guidelines.â€Â  Husband asserts this \r\n  was error because â€œthe guidelines are not approved for use for the family court \r\n  . . . and results are not subject to cross-examination and confrontation by \r\n  the parties.â€Â  Even assuming, without deciding, that the family courtâ€™s consideration \r\n  of the guidelines was error, Husband fails to demonstrate how the use of these \r\n  guidelines prejudiced him.Â  See Blakely v. Blakely, 249 S.C. 623, \r\n  625, 155 S.E.2d 857, 858 (1967) (stating that an alimony order will not be reversed \r\n  unless the alleged error is material and prejudicial to the substantial rights \r\n  of the complaining party). As shown above, Husbandâ€™s income and expenses had \r\n  not materially or substantially changed.Â  Therefore, regardless of whether the \r\n  Traxler guidelines were considered, Husband was not entitled to a reduction \r\n  or termination of his alimony obligation. \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband next argues that the family courtâ€™s award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees should be reversed because of the adverse impact they have \r\n  on his finances. [7] Â  We find no error in the family \r\n  courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nThe award of attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within \r\n  the family courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 520, 586 \r\n  S.E.2d 136, 141Â  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The factors to consider when awarding attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees are (1) the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fees, (2) the beneficial \r\n  results obtained by the attorney, (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, \r\n  and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M \r\n  v. T.A.M, 307 S.C. 471, 476-477, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In this case, \r\n  the family court specifically found that Husband had â€œsufficient income as well \r\n  as a great deal of assets out of which he can pay fees, while [Wife] generates \r\n  little income and has comparatively modest assets.â€Â  \r\nThe evidence in the record demonstrates that Husband \r\n  generates more income than Wife each month.Â  Furthermore, according to their \r\n  financial declarations, Husband has nearly $190,000 worth of assets, while Wife \r\n  has only $35,000 worth of assets. Â Thus, we find no error in the family \r\n  courtâ€™s decision to award attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.\r\nHusband also argues that he should not have to pay \r\n  for the 2.7 hours Wifeâ€™s attorney spent working on the contempt action.Â  We \r\n  find the family court did not award Wife attorneyâ€™s fees for these hours.Â  \r\nWife requested that her attorney be reimbursed \r\n  for the 30.8 hours he spent on her entire case, including the contempt action.Â  \r\n  At her attorneyâ€™s rate of $150 per hour, Wifeâ€™s total fees were $4,620.Â  The \r\n  family court, however, only awarded Wife $4,000 in attorneys fees.Â  Thus, Husband \r\n  was not required to pay for approximately four hours worth of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees, which presumably included the 2.7 hours Wifeâ€™s attorney spent on the contempt \r\n  action.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Husband was not entitled \r\n  to an alimony reduction or termination because he failed to show a material \r\n  or substantial change in his financial circumstances.Â  We further find the family \r\n  courtâ€™s award of $4,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife was not an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  In the partiesâ€™ divorce order, the family court noted that â€œ[Wife] \r\n    dropped out of high school in the 10th grade, marrying [Husband] \r\n    when she was 17 years old.Â  During the next 14 years, she and the children \r\n    followed [Husband] from military base to military base . . . .Â  These moves \r\n    were not conducive either to building up job skills or retirement funds.â€Â  \r\n    However, the court did impute to Wife a monthly income of $922, finding she \r\n    was capable of working forty hours a week for minimum wage.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  In its order, the family court found Husband no longer paid $238 \r\n    per month toward his pension.Â  However, the financial declaration Husband \r\n    submitted at the time of the partiesâ€™ divorce lists a $373.45 deduction for \r\n    Husbandâ€™s â€œretirement or pension plan.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [3]    Husbandâ€™s gross monthly income had been $5,361 at the time of the \r\n    divorce.Â  Taking away the $1,000 in alimony and the $850 in retirement benefits, \r\n    his gross monthly income was $3,511.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Or, if we were to consider alimony as an expense like Husband does \r\n    in his current financial declaration, Husbandâ€™s income immediately after the \r\n    divorce decree was $4,138 a month and his expenses were $4,484, still leaving \r\n    a $346 deficit.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  Husband makes $2,239 per month at Miller Trophy, \r\n    $884 per month from his retirement, and $440 per month from rents.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  We also note that two months after the partiesâ€™ divorce, Husband \r\n    remarried.Â  Although Husband admittedly includes some of his new wifeâ€™s expenses \r\n    on his financial declaration, he did not in turn include her monthly income \r\n    of $1,400.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] \r\n     Husband also argues that the award of attorneyâ€™s fees should be reversed \r\n    if we reverse the family courtâ€™s alimony decision.Â  Because we affirm the \r\n    family courtâ€™s decision not to reduce or terminate Husbandâ€™s alimony, we need \r\n    not address this issue.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, \r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating that appellate \r\n    court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issues is \r\n    dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-011","title":"Baird Pacific West v.

(â€œBlue Waterâ€), alleging \r\n  breach of contract, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation in connection with \r\n  an agreement entered between the parties for the sale of land.Â  The circuit \r\n  court granted summary judgment in favor of Blue Water andÂ  awarded attorney \r\n  fees to Blue Water.Â  Baird appeals, arguing (1) summary judgment was improper; \r\n  and (2) the award of attorney fees was improper because Blue Water failed to \r\n  request attorney fees in its pleadings and Blue Waterâ€™s request for a hearing \r\n  concerning its motion for attorney fees was untimely, thus divesting the trial \r\n  court of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n In December 1996, the parties entered \r\n  into a contract in which Baird agreed to purchase and Blue Water agreed to sell \r\n  approximately eight acres of waterfront property on the north end of Hilton \r\n  Head Island.Â  The agreement set the purchase price at $1,725,000.\r\n The parties were unable to consummate \r\n  the original contract due to difficulties in obtaining approval from the state \r\n  environmental agency.Â Â  However, this approval was eventually obtained, and \r\n  in March 1998, Baird and Blue Water entered into an agreement to reinstate and \r\n  amend the earlier contract.Â  The parties agreed Baird would have until May 4, \r\n  1998 to conduct additional due diligence investigations.Â  They also agreed that \r\n  Baird was to waive its right to purchase an extension of the due diligence period, \r\n  as had been allowed under the terms of the original contract.Â  Baird could, \r\n  however, elect to withdraw from the contract at the end of the due diligence \r\n  period and receive a full refund of its earnest-money deposit.\r\nPrior to the expiration of the new due \r\n  diligence period, Baird informed Blue Water of three problems Baird was unable \r\n  to resolve: a title defect, a discrepancy in the acreage of the property, and \r\n  an instability in some of the filled portions of the land.Â  Baird requested \r\n  an extension of the due diligence period in order to resolve these issues, and \r\n  if Blue Water was not amenable to that request, Baird alternatively suggested \r\n  they cancel the contract.Â  Blue Water declined to extend the due diligence review, \r\n  opting instead to terminate the contract.Â  The contract was cancelled, and Bairdâ€™s \r\n  earnest moneyÂ  was refunded. \r\nIn March 1999, Baird brought the present \r\n  action, alleging Blue Water was liable to Baird for breach of contract, fraud, \r\n  and negligent misrepresentation due to Blue Waterâ€™s inability to convey marketable \r\n  title to the property.Â  Baird also sought to recover actual and consequential \r\n  damages.Â  \r\nPursuant to Blue Waterâ€™s motion for summary judgment, \r\n  the circuit court concluded there were no genuine issues of material fact and \r\n  found Blue Water was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all of Bairdâ€™s \r\n  claims in a June 15, 2001 order, reserving Blue Waterâ€™s claim for attorney fees.Â  \r\n  The circuit court granted Blue Water â€œleave to move for an award of attorney \r\n  fees and Court costs upon thirty (30) days notice to [Baird].â€Â  Following a \r\n  hearing, the circuit court awarded attorney fees and costs to Blue Water in \r\n  an October 2001 order.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court should grant a motion for summary \r\n  judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Fleming v. \r\n  Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  â€œIn determining whether \r\n  any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can \r\n  be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, \r\n  332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  If triable issues of fact exist, \r\n  those issues must go to the jury.Â  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., \r\n  333 S.C. 714, 717, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Breach of Contract, Fraud, and Negligent \r\n  Misrepresentation\r\nBairdâ€™s claims for breach of contract, \r\n  fraud, and negligent misrepresentation all rest upon its assertion that Blue \r\n  Water was not able to convey marketable title as required by the terms of the \r\n  contract.Â  We find no merit to Bairdâ€™s position.\r\nIn construing the terms of a written contract \r\n  upon a motion for summary judgment, the question is one of law if the language \r\n  contained in the contract is plain and unambiguous.Â  MGC Mgmt. of Charleston, \r\n  Inc. v. Kinghorn Ins. Agency, 336 S.C. 542, 546, 520 S.E.2d 820, 822 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999).Â  â€œIn such a case, summary judgment is proper and a trial unnecessary \r\n  where the intention of the parties as to the legal effect of the contract may \r\n  be gathered from the four corners of the instrument itself.â€Â  First Citizens \r\n  Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Conway Natâ€™l Bank, 282 S.C. 303, 305, 317 S.E.2d \r\n  776, 777 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  It is well settled that, in construing a contract, \r\n  the court must ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties.Â  BP \r\n  Oil Co. v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., Inc., 329 S.C. 631, 640, 496 S.E.2d \r\n  35, 40 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing D.A. Davis Constr. Co. v. Palmetto Properties, \r\n  Inc., 281 S.C. 415, 315 S.E.2d 370 (1984)).Â  When the intention of the parties \r\n  to a written agreement is at issue, the court must first look to the language \r\n  of the agreement.Â  C.A.N. Enterprises, Inc. v. South Carolina Health and \r\n  Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1988);Â  \r\n  Warner v. Weader, 280 S.C. 81, 83, 311 S.E.2d 78, 79 (1983).Â  If the \r\n  agreement is unambiguous, the court must construe it according to the terms \r\n  the parties chose.Â  Id.Â  These terms are to be understood in their ordinary \r\n  and popular sense.Â  Id.\r\nWith respect to title, the contract in \r\n  the present case provided:\r\n\r\nTITLE. Seller shall convey marketable \r\n  title to the property to purchaser in fee simple by proper deed in recordable \r\n  form with stamps affixed and with covenants of general warranty subject to normal \r\n  utility easements, applicable restrictive covenants, governmental regulations \r\n  and assessments.Â  If an ownerâ€™s title binder can be issued by an ALTA [1]  title insurance company at standard rates with \r\n  standard exceptions for Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, title shall be deemed \r\n  to marketable. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nIn compliance with these explicit terms, Blue Water \r\n  obtained and held at all pertinent times a title binder from the Chicago Title \r\n  Insurance Company (â€œChicago Titleâ€), an ATLA title insurance company.Â  The policy \r\n  was issued at standard rates with standard exceptions for Hilton Head Island. \r\n  Â We find these facts uncontroverted by the evidence contained in the \r\n  record.\r\nHowever, Baird attempts to redirect the \r\n  attention of this Court from the plain language of the contract in an effort \r\n  to convince us Blue Water failed to honor its promise to convey marketable title.Â  \r\n  We find these efforts unpersuasive.\r\nFor instance, Baird devotes substantial energies \r\n  to explaining why the title Blue Water was willing to convey would not be â€œclearâ€ \r\n  or â€œmarketableâ€ under general principles of real property law.Â  While this may \r\n  or may not be true, it is of little concern to the present inquiry.Â  Where the \r\n  parties have freely and knowingly entered into a contract â€“ as they did in the \r\n  present case â€“ our charge is only to give effect to the partiesâ€™ intentions \r\n  as memorialized in the contract language.Â  We see no reason, and none is alleged, \r\n  why we should veer from this mandate. \r\nBaird also claims that it could not obtain \r\n  title insurance with standard rates and exceptions due to the outstanding claims \r\n  on the title by a third party.Â  This third party claim, however, was clearly \r\n  contemplated and fully indemnified under the policy issued by Chicago Title.Â  \r\n  This fact is amply demonstrated by a letter received from the insurance companyâ€™s \r\n  underwriting council, which confirms the insurerâ€™s obligation under the policy.Â  \r\n  This letter reads, in relevant part:\r\n\r\nSince Chicago Title has an outstanding \r\n  Ownerâ€™s Policy, we would be willing to insure over this [third-party claim] \r\n  problem in the policies for this property.Â  We would prefer to take exception \r\n  to the problem and provide affirmative coverage over it rather than issue a \r\n  â€œclean policy.â€ Â We prefer to reveal the problem and provide protection.Â  \r\n\r\nHowever, regardless of the existence or disposition \r\n  of the alleged cloud on the title of the subject property, the fact remains \r\n  uncontroverted by the evidence in the record before us that Blue Water was able \r\n  at all times to provide adequate title insurance under the clear terms of the \r\n  contract language.\r\nWe conclude that Blue Water fully complied \r\n  with its obligation to convey marketable title to Baird as agreed to by the \r\n  parties.Â  Accordingly, Bairdâ€™s claims â€“ that Blue Water breached the contract \r\n  terms regarding title and that Blue Water fraudulently or negligently misrepresented \r\n  its ability to convey title â€“ are manifestly without merit.Â  The circuit court \r\n  correctly granted summary judgment in disposing of Bairdâ€™s specious claims.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Attorney Fees\r\nBaird also argues the trial court erred in awarding \r\n  Blue Water attorney fees.Â  Specifically, it asserts two procedural defects concerning \r\n  Blue Waterâ€™s request for fees: first, that Blue Water failed to make its request \r\n  for attorney fees in its pleadings, and, second, that the circuit court lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to consider the issue of attorney fees.Â  We find \r\n  these arguments unavailing.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Request of Attorney Fees\r\nWe first find that, although Blue Water did not \r\n  make its request for attorney fees in its pleadings, its claim is not barred \r\n  under the circumstances of this case.Â  To be sure, the general rule is that \r\n  a party is entitled to seek only that relief set forth in its pleadings.Â  See \r\n  Premium Inv. Corp. v. Green, 283 S.C. 464, 474, 324 S.E.2d 72, 78 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1984).Â  In this case, however, the record reveals Blue Water raised the \r\n  issue of attorney fees in the affidavit accompanying its October 2000 summary \r\n  judgment motion.Â  Subsequently, during the May 2001 hearing on its motion for \r\n  summary judgment, Blue Water again sought the circuit courtâ€™s consideration \r\n  of the attorney fees issue.Â  Baird did not object, but rather stated: â€œI just \r\n  wanted to make sure that if the court takes up that issue, that I have time \r\n  to respond to it.â€Â  The circuit court acquiesced to Bairdâ€™s request and granted \r\n  Blue Water leave to move for award of attorney fees upon thirty days notice \r\n  to Baird.\r\nA hearing on the request for attorney \r\n  fees was held, during which Baird objected, for the first time, that the claim \r\n  was barred for failure to plead.Â  The trial court ruled the request was allowed \r\n  under Rule 15(b), SCRCP, which allows amendment of the pleadings by express \r\n  or implied consent of the parties.Â  See Rule 15(b), SCRCP (stating â€œ[w]hen \r\n  issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of \r\n  the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised \r\n  in the pleadings.â€)Â  The decision to allow amendments under Rule 15(b) is entrusted \r\n  to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and the party opposing the amendment \r\n  bears the burden of establishing prejudice.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 \r\n  S.C. 303, 313, 566 S.E.2d 529, 535 (2002).Â  We are unable to discern any prejudice \r\n  to Baird in light of the fact that the issue of attorney fees was raised months \r\n  earlier.Â  We find the issue of attorney fees was properly before the circuit \r\n  court. \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction [2] \r\nBaird argues the circuit court lacked jurisdiction \r\n  to entertain Blue Waterâ€™s request for attorney fees.Â  Specifically, Baird claims \r\n  that Blue Water failed to seek attorney fees in a timely manner because it did \r\n  not file a motion within the ten-day time period prescribed by Rule 54, SCRCP.Â  \r\n  The rule provides in pertinent part that a â€œmotion for costs, supported by an \r\n  affidavit that the costs are correct and were necessarily incurred in the action, \r\n  may be filed by the prevailing party within 10 days of the receipt of written \r\n  notice of the entry of final judgment.â€Â  Rule 54(d), SCRCP.Â  Additionally, Rule \r\n  54(b), SCRCP, partially provides:\r\n\r\n[w]hen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action \r\n  â€¦ the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer \r\n  than all of the claims â€¦ upon an express determination that there is no just \r\n  reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.Â  In \r\n  the absence of such determination and direction, any order or other form of \r\n  decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or \r\n  the rights and liabilities of fewer than all of the parties shall not terminate \r\n  the action as to any of the claims or parties, and the order or other form of \r\n  decision is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating \r\n  all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\r\n\r\nHere, the circuit courtâ€™s order expressly recognized that \r\n  it reserved the matter of attorney fees for future determination.Â  Under these \r\n  circumstances, the circuit courtâ€™s continuing jurisdiction was in no manner \r\n  contingent upon Blue Water filing an additional motion within ten days following \r\n  the grant of summary judgment.Â  Moreover, the order granting summary judgment \r\n  contained no Rule 54(b) â€œexpress determination that there is no just reason \r\n  for delayâ€ of the formal entry of judgment.Â  Thus, since the matter of attorney \r\n  fees was reserved, we find that the trial courtâ€™s June 15, 2001 order cannot \r\n  be construed as an order disposing of all claims before the circuit court.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, Bairdâ€™s reliance on the ten-day filing period provided in Rule \r\n  54(d) is misplaced, and the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to \r\n  award attorney fees and costs to Blue Water.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] &nbsp;&nbsp; American Land Title Association.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  Blue Water argues that the issue \r\n    of subject matter jurisdiction is not properly before this court because Baird \r\n    raised it neither in the circuit court nor in its brief.Â  It is true that, \r\n    â€œ[a]s a general rule, an issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.â€Â  \r\n    McKissick v. J.F. Cleckly &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 343, 479 S.E.2d \r\n    67, 75 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  However, issues related to subject matter jurisdiction \r\n    may be raised at any time.Â  Bunkum v. Manor Properties, 321 S.C. 95, \r\n    100, 467 S.E.2d 758, 761 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Thus, we find that the issue of \r\n    subject matter jurisdiction is properly before this court.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-012","title":"Meredith v.

Robin Alley and W. Joseph Isaacs, both of Columbia, for Respondents Raynold \r\n  Stoudemayer and Loretta S. Canon.\r\nJ. Layne Birdsong and James B. Richardson, Jr., both of Columbia, for Respondent \r\n  Gerald Stoudemayer.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Thomas and Lisa Meredith commenced \r\n  this action seeking to enforce a contract of sale for the purchase of certain \r\n  property.Â  Loretta Canon and Raynold Stoudemayer answered and counterclaimed \r\n  asserting that they had a right of first refusal on the property.Â  Gerald Stoudemayer, \r\n  owner of the property, answered the complaint.Â  Gerald moved for summary judgment, \r\n  asking the court to determine which of the prospective purchasers had the right \r\n  to purchase his property and indicating his willingness to sell to either.Â  \r\n  The court entered a partial summary judgment in favor of Loretta Canon and Raynold \r\n  Stoudemayer.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt issue in this litigation is a parcel \r\n  of undeveloped property known as Tract 2, Stoudemayer Road located in Richland \r\n  Country, South Carolina.Â Â  Prior to 1998, this property was part of a single \r\n  150-acre tract owned by George Stoudemayer, who died on May 24, 1998, and was \r\n  survived by his four children: Gerald Stoudemayer, Raynold Stoudemayer, Loretta \r\n  Canon, and Sandra Smith.Â  A duly executed codicil to George Stoudemayerâ€™s Last \r\n  Will and Testament addressed the distribution of the 150-acre tract:\r\n\r\nI give to my Personal Representatives the tract of 150 acres, \r\n  more or less, in Richland County inherited by me from my father, shown on a \r\n  plat by Arthur J. Weed, dated October 9, 1975, which is attached hereto and \r\n  incorporated herein, for the purposes of dividing the same among my children \r\n  in accordance with the division shown on said plat as follows:\r\nTract 1 to my son, Raynold Stoudemayer\r\nTract 2 to my son, Gerald Stoudemayer\r\nTract 3 to my daughter, Sandra S. Smith\r\nTract 4 with my house to my daughter, Loretta S. Canon.\r\nEach of said children shall have the use of the road as access \r\n  to their tract and the use of the pond on the property.\r\nNone of my children shall sell their tract to any person without \r\n  first offering it to my other children at the same price as any bona fide offer \r\n  received.Â  Either or all of my other children shall have the right of first \r\n  refusal to purchase the tract on the same terms by notifying the child desiring \r\n  to sell of the exercise of such right, in writing, within fifteen (15) days \r\n  from receipt of written notice of the offer received.\r\n\r\nRaynold Stoudemayer and Loretta Canon \r\n  were appointed as the estateâ€™s personal representatives and executed a deed \r\n  of distribution, dividing the 150-acre tract into four parcels, including the \r\n  property passed to Gerald Stoudemayer.\r\n Beginning in 1999, Gerald Stoudemayer \r\n  sought to sell his portion of the property.Â  On November 17, 2000, he signed \r\n  a contract with Thomas Meredith and Lisa Meredith for sale of the property.Â  \r\n  As required under the codicil, Raynold Stoudemayer and Loretta Canon received \r\n  notice of the contract, and in turn, notified Gerald Stoudemayer of their desire \r\n  to exercise the right of first refusal included in the codicil.Â  On December \r\n  28, 2000, Raynold Stoudemayer and Loretta Canon signed a contract with Gerald \r\n  Stoudemayer for sale of the property.\r\nThe Merediths commenced this action seeking to \r\n  enforce their contract to purchase the property.Â  Loretta Canon and Raynold \r\n  Stoudemayer answered, asserting they had a right of first refusal on the property.Â  \r\n  Gerald Stoudemayer answered the complaint and moved for summary judgment.Â  The \r\n  trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Loretta Canon and Raynold \r\n  Stoudemayer, determining the property is subject to the right of first refusal \r\n  described in the codicil.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court correctly rule that \r\n  Raynold Stoudemayer and Loretta Canon have a valid right of first refusal over \r\n  the property owned by Gerald Stoudemayer?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nTo obtain summary judgment, the moving party must \r\n  demonstrate there is â€œno genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56, SCRCP; Wilson v. \r\n  Moseley, 327 S.C. 144, 146, 488 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1997).Â  As a conclusion \r\n  of law, we review the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment de novo.Â  See \r\n  Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 301, 501 S.E.2d 746, 749 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998) (â€œAn appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under \r\n  the same standard applied by the trial court.â€).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n The Stoudemayer siblings assert that their \r\n  contract should prevail by virtue of the right of first refusal under the codicil.Â  \r\n  The Merediths contend that the Stoudemayer siblingsâ€™ right of first refusal \r\n  under the codicil should be given no effect because the deed of distribution \r\n  executed by the personal representative did not include any restriction in its \r\n  granting clause and thus conveyed fee simple title to Stoudemayer.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe turn first to the language of the codicil to \r\n  determine its effect.Â  The applicable language of the codicil provides, â€œI give \r\n  to my Personal Representatives the tract of 150 acres, more or less . . . for \r\n  the purpose of dividing the same among my children.â€Â  At the outset, we think \r\n  it clear that the phrase, â€œgive to my personal representatives,â€ did not carry \r\n  with it the legal effect of creating a devise of the 150-acre tract of land \r\n  to the estateâ€™s fiduciary, nor does the document suggest George Stoudemayer \r\n  harbored such an intent.Â  We need not resort to a mechanistic recitation of \r\n  the canons of construction to arrive at such a conclusion.Â  Common sense compels \r\n  this result.Â  Buttressing this analysis is the verbiage of the codicil devising \r\n  the property:\r\n\r\nIf prior to my death the expense for my care, support and \r\n  maintenance exceeds funds which I have on hand and such expense is then paid \r\n  by my children, or any of them, it is my will that they share such expense in \r\n  proportion to the interest in the real estate above devised to them.Â  \r\n  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nGeorge Stoudemayer devised his 150-acre tract of \r\n  land to his progeny, not to those with the fiduciary obligation of administering \r\n  his estate.Â  \r\nWe address the Probate Code for the purpose of \r\n  determining the precise point at which the property was transferred to the four \r\n  devisees.\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 62-3-101 states, â€œUpon \r\n  the death of a person, his real property devolves to the persons to whom it \r\n  is devised by his last will . . . and his personal property devolves, first, \r\n  to his personal representative . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-101 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  This section stands as the modern codification of the common law rule first \r\n  stated in Executors of Crosland v. Murdock:\r\n\r\nThe executor derives his powers over the goods of his testator \r\n  from the grant of the ordinary, but not so with regard to lands devised, or \r\n  an authority to sell lands.Â  These the devisee takes directly under the will, \r\n  and immediately from the testator.Â  The fee cannot be in abeyance, and on his \r\n  death it vests eo instanti.\r\n\r\n15 S.C.L. (4 McCord) 217, 218 (1827).Â  Thus, while \r\n  a deviseeâ€™s title to real property remains subject to the personal representativeâ€™s \r\n  handling of administrative costs and creditorâ€™s claims, the personal representative \r\n  never actually takes title to the devised real property.Â  In contrast, as denoted \r\n  by the final portion of the above statutory excerpt, personal property receives \r\n  an altogether different treatment.Â  Unlike its treatment of real property, the \r\n  Code specifically dictates that personal property actually devolves to the personal \r\n  representative.Â  See Gibson v. Belcher, 287 S.C. 315, 318, 338 \r\n  S.E.2d 330, 332 (1985) (â€œIt has long been the law in South Carolina that upon \r\n  the testatorâ€™s death, title to the personal property vests in the executor.â€).Â  \r\n  This disparate treatment of real property and personal property provides the \r\n  key to understanding the legal consequence of the deed of distribution Raynold \r\n  Stoudemayer and Loretta Canon executed in compliance with the Probate Codeâ€™s \r\n  requirement that one be executed whenever distribution is made in kind.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-907 (Supp. 1987).\r\nAt the time George Stoudemayerâ€™s estate was administered, \r\n  the Code did not give deeds of distribution the effect of conveying title.Â  \r\n  From 1987 to 2000, the Probate Code provided as follows: \r\n  [1] \r\n\r\nIf distribution in kind (whether real or personal property) \r\n  is made, the personal representative must execute an instrument or deed of distribution \r\n  assigning, transferring, or releasing the assets to the distributee as evidence \r\n  of the distributeeâ€™s title to the property.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-907 (1987).Â  Giving the statute \r\n  its plain meaning, the deed of distribution is â€œevidenceâ€ of a distributeeâ€™s \r\n  title; it is not the method by which a distributee takes title. \r\nMoreover, through its use of the words â€œassigning, \r\n  transferring, or releasing,â€ the Probate Code plainly anticipates deeds of distribution \r\n  as having three possible effects.Â  As relates to distributions of real property, \r\n  however, that function can neither be one of assignment nor of transfer because \r\n  the Probate Code unmistakably establishes that title to real property is transferred \r\n  at the time of the testatorâ€™s death.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-101 (Supp. 1987).Â  \r\n  Thus, as relates to real property, the deed of distribution carries the third \r\n  functionâ€”that of release.Â  That is, the deed of distribution acts as an official \r\n  declaration that the property is no longer subject to the personal representativeâ€™s \r\n  handling of administrative costs, creditorsâ€™ claims, and the like.\r\nIn sum, title to the real property passed to Stoudemayer \r\n  immediately upon the death of his father.Â  The subsequently executed deed of \r\n  distribution merely evidenced Stoudemayerâ€™s title to the land while also acting \r\n  as an official release of the land from the personal representativesâ€™ administrative \r\n  control.Â  As a consequence, the right of first refusal described in the codicil \r\n  remains in full effect. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., and\r\nCURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1]    Effective August 17, 2000, the General Assembly amendedÂ  Â§ 62-3-907 \r\n    such that the entire former section was redesignated Â§ 62-3-907(A) and subsections \r\n    (B) and (C) were added to address specific distributions of real property.Â  \r\n    These amendments, however, took effect after the execution of the deed of \r\n    distribution.Â  As such, the 2000 amendments have no bearing on the case at \r\n    bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-013","title":"St Helena Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses v.

[1]   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nSt. Helenaâ€™s brought an action to quiet title and \r\n  confirm boundaries to two separate, adjoining lots in the City of Beaufort.Â  \r\n  All named defendants were served, failed to answer, and were held in default. \r\n  Â The circuit court referred the matter to the master in equity with finality.Â  \r\n  During the hearing, the master noted the complaint mentioned two lots but only \r\n  described one and permitted counsel to amend as to every person served under \r\n  the order of publication to conform to proper notice requirements.Â  \r\nShortly into the hearing, the master suggested \r\n  the case was proven and that he was inclined to sign a final decree in St. Helenaâ€™s \r\n  favor. Â Counsel for St. Helenaâ€™s relied on these favorable comments and informed \r\n  both St. Helenaâ€™s and a prospective purchaser of the lots that the case had \r\n  been proven and the matter would be concluded shortly.Â  The purchaser, in reliance \r\n  on counselâ€™s assurances, proceeded to tear down a house located on one of the \r\n  lots.Â  Unfortunately, the master later realized he could not quiet title in \r\n  favor of St. Helenaâ€™s based upon the evidence before him and issued an order \r\n  denying the request to quiet title.Â  \r\nPrior to drafting the order, the master telephoned \r\n  counsel for St. Helenaâ€™s, giving him the choice of an adverse ruling or accepting \r\n  a voluntary dismissal.Â  Counsel responded by letter reminding the master of \r\n  his remarks at trial and of the partiesâ€™ reliance on counselâ€™s relay of those \r\n  remarks.Â  Counsel also insisted the masterâ€™s concerns about whether the property \r\n  consisted of two lots rather than one and whether the tax deed was accurate \r\n  were resolved in post-trial discussions among counsel, the master, and a title \r\n  abstractor. Â \r\nUpon receipt of the order, counsel wrote to the \r\n  master, claiming a factual inaccuracy in the order in the identification of \r\n  a predecessor in title, and urging reconsideration. Â The master returned the \r\n  letter requesting counsel make a formal motion for reconsideration.Â  A motion \r\n  for reconsideration was made and promptly denied. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSt. Helenaâ€™s argues the master erred by issuing \r\n  a written order inconsistent with his remarks at the reference hearing and by \r\n  refusing to reopen the case â€œto allow Plaintiff to convince him that he should \r\n  not have changed his mind.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nSt. Helenaâ€™s acknowledges in its brief that the \r\n  master was entitled to change his mind, merely claiming such a reversal is uncommon.Â  \r\n  Uncommon or not, â€œ[n]o order is final until it is written and entered.â€Â  First \r\n  Union Natâ€™l Bank v. Hitman, Inc., 306 S.C. 327, 329, 411 S.E.2d 681, 682 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1991) (citing Rule 58(a), SCRCP).Â  â€œUntil written and entered, the \r\n  trial judge retains discretion to change his mind and amend his oral ruling \r\n  accordingly.â€Â  Ford v. State Ethics Commâ€™n, 344 S.C. 642, 646, 545 S.E.2d \r\n  821, 823 (2001); Case v. Case, 243 S.C. 447, 451, 134 S.E.2d 394, 396 \r\n  (1964) (holding even if the trial judge made an oral ruling in favor of one \r\n  party, â€œsuch pronouncement is not a final ruling on the merits nor is it binding \r\n  on the parties until it has been reduced to writing, signed by the judge, and \r\n  delivered for recordationâ€); First Union Natâ€™l Bank, 306 S.C. at 329, \r\n  411 S.E.2d at 682.Â  \r\nA trial judgeâ€™s decision not to reopen a case for \r\n  additional testimony is a matter within his sound discretion, and the decision \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Wright v. \r\n  Strickland, 306 S.C. 187, 410 S.E.2d 596, 597 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  We find \r\n  no abuse of discretion under the circumstances.Â  St. Helenaâ€™s made no proffer \r\n  of testimony or documents it sought to present.Â  As the master indicated, there \r\n  is nothing in the transcript indicating St. Helenaâ€™s had further evidence it \r\n  would have offered but for the masterâ€™s remarks.Â  St. Helenaâ€™s argues a new \r\n  hearing would permit the introduction of another deed into evidence that would \r\n  clarify the description of the property in question.Â  The master addressed this \r\n  deed in his original order and determined it would only further confuse the \r\n  issues.Â  Thus, St. Helenaâ€™s made no showing that additional documents would \r\n  make a difference in the outcome of the case.Â  \r\nSt. Helenaâ€™s argues the master erred on the merits \r\n  when he denied its claim to quiet title and confirm boundaries for two lots.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nSince this action was heard by a master in equity \r\n  who entered final judgment, we must review the entire record and make our own \r\n  findings of fact in accordance with our view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Townes Associates, Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d \r\n  773 (1976).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard \r\n  the findings of the master, who saw and heard the evidence and was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate its credibility.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., \r\n  301 S.C. 229, 391 S.E.2d 538 (1989).Â  \r\nSt. Helenaâ€™s argues a deed it informally presented \r\n  to the master subsequent to trial reveals St. Helenaâ€™s predecessors in title \r\n  held two lots despite the fact that the complaint references a deed showing \r\n  the conveyance of only one lot.Â  St. Helenaâ€™s also attempts to advance new arguments \r\n  supporting the validity of a tax sale in opposition to the masterâ€™s finding \r\n  that the tax deed revealed the transfer of substantially less than two lots.Â  \r\n  Again, St. Helenaâ€™s urges that but for the masterâ€™s favorable comments at the \r\n  trial, it would have entered supporting documentation into evidence and advanced \r\n  these arguments at the hearing.Â  \r\nWe agree with the masterâ€™s ruling that St. Helenaâ€™s \r\n  relied upon a deed referenced in its complaint which clearly conveyed only one \r\n  lot to a predecessor in its chain of title.Â  Moreover, the single lot was later \r\n  held as tenants in common due to a death.Â  A tax deed indicates that one of \r\n  the tenantâ€™s shares became subject to a tax levy, was sold, and later passed \r\n  by quitclaim deed to St. Helenaâ€™s.Â  Thus, St. Helenaâ€™s held, at most, a one-half \r\n  undivided interest with the other tenant or his heirs.Â  Nothing else appearing \r\n  in the record, we cannot say the master erred in determining he could not quiet \r\n  title in favor of St. Helenaâ€™s for two lots.Â  We also agree that the production \r\n  of a deed subsequent to trial describing a transfer of two adjacent lots within \r\n  St. Helenaâ€™s chain of title is insufficient to overcome the problems created \r\n  by the deed referenced in the original complaint.Â  The new deed does not expand \r\n  the original grant of one lot nor does it sweep in the one-half share not transferred \r\n  by the tax deed.Â  \r\nFinally, St. Helenaâ€™s requests that the masterâ€™s \r\n  order be vacated because of purported bias against counsel.Â  In response to \r\n  counselâ€™s request, which occurred almost a year after the master issued his \r\n  final order in this case, he recused himself from all of counselâ€™s cases.Â  Counsel \r\n  claims the master admitted to bias against him by agreeing to his request; however, \r\n  the master merely did as he was asked, in a routine order and without acrimony.Â  \r\n  There is simply nothing in the record to indicate the master was in violation \r\n  of any canon of judicial conduct and should have recused himself.Â  His later \r\n  recusal was purely voluntary.Â  See Canon 3(E)(1)(a) of the Code of Judicial \r\n  Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR (requiring a judge to recuse himself when â€œhe has a \r\n  personal bias or prejudice concerning a party. . . .â€).Â  We accordingly find \r\n  any claim of bias in this case frivolous.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-014","title":"State v.

Williams, of Moncks Corner, for Appellant\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. \r\n  McIntosh, Deputy Attorney General Treva Ashworth, Assistant Attorney General \r\n  Deborah R. J. Shupe, Assistant Attorney General R. Westmoreland Clarkson, all \r\n  of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  A jury found that Appellant was a sexually violent predator. \r\n  We affirm.\r\n FACTS\r\nKenneth Whitcraft pled guilty to criminal sexual \r\n  conduct with a minor (second degree) in 1990. Whitcraft had been convicted on \r\n  similar charges in Pennsylvania as early as 1985. He was given a 16-year sentence. \r\n  In March of 2001, as Whitcraft was approaching his parole date, the state petitioned \r\n  Judge Dennis to declare Whitcraft a sexually violent predator. At trial, the \r\n  stateâ€™s expert witness testified that Whitcraft had a â€œhistory, â€¦ severe difficulty \r\n  controlling his impulsesâ€; that Whitcraft suffered from pedophilia, alcohol \r\n  abuse, and anxiety disorder; that Whitcraft could have great difficulty controlling \r\n  his impulses if he started abusing alcohol again; that Whitcraft was in â€œthe \r\n  moderate to higher risk to reoffendâ€ group of sex offenders; and that Whitcraft \r\n  met the statutory definition of a â€œsexually violent predator.â€ After both sides \r\n  presented testimony, Whitcraft moved for a directed verdict. The trial judge \r\n  declined. The Berkeley County jury found that the state had proven beyond a \r\n  reasonable doubt that Whitcraft was a sexually violent predator under S.C. Ann. \r\n  Code Â§ 44-48-30. The trial judge then committed Whitcraft to the Department \r\n  of Mental Health â€œlong term.â€ Whitcraft appeals.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n(1) Did the trial court err in not ruling that \r\n  the state failed to carry its burden under Kansa v. Crane? \r\n(2) Does the Sexual Violent Predator Act violate \r\n  the Ex Post Facto clauses of the U.S. and the South Carolina constitutions?\r\n(3) Does restraining Whitcraft even after he has served \r\n  his sentence constitute cruel and unusual punishment?\r\n\r\nÂ ANALYSIS \r\nâ€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried \r\n  by a jury, the [j]urisdiction of this Court extends merely to the correction \r\n  of errors of law, and a factual finding of the jury will not be disturbed unless \r\n  a review of the record discloses that there is no evidence which reasonably \r\n  supports the jury's findings.â€ Townes Assoc., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 8, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (citing Odom v. Weathersbee, \r\n  225 S.C. 253, 81 S.E.2d 788 (1954)).Â Â  \r\nWhitcraft first argues that the state failed to \r\n  carry its burden under Kansas, as adopted in South Carolina. \r\n  [1]  The South Carolina Act defines a sexually violent predator as a â€œperson \r\n  likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined â€¦.â€ S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§44-48-30(1) (2002). In In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Luckabaugh, \r\n  351 S.C. 122, 144, 568 S.E.2d 338, 349 (2002), the court declared that under \r\n  the Act, â€œthe individual can only be committed if he suffers from a mental illness \r\n  which he cannot sufficiently control without the structure and care provided \r\n  by a mental health facility, rendering him likely to commit a dangerous act.â€ \r\n  In re Luckabaugh clearly mandates, among other elements, a finding that \r\n  the defendant requires residential treatment in order to control his impulses \r\n  before he can be committed to a long-term state facility.\r\nWhitcraft argues that no such evidence was adduced at trial. \r\n  We disagree. At trial, the stateâ€™s expert testified that Whitcraft suffered \r\n  from three illnesses: alcohol abuse, anxiety disorder, and â€œmore seriousâ€ or \r\n  â€œsevereâ€ pedophilia that could cause him extreme difficulty in controlling his \r\n  impulses. The stateâ€™s expert witness also specifically agreed that â€œWhitcraft \r\n  suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that â€¦ give[s] him \r\n  the propensity to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure \r\n  facility for long-term care and treatment.â€ Based on that testimony, the jury \r\n  found that Whitcraft is a sexually violent predator as defined under the Act. \r\n\r\nIt is true that the evidence against Whitcraft \r\n  was less than overwhelming. [2]  And there was contradicting testimony \r\n  from Whitcraftâ€™s expert. However, when ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, \r\n  a trial court considers the existence of the evidence, not its weight. State \r\n  v. Glaser, 349 S.C. 545, 548, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002). Here, the jury found \r\n  that Whitcraft was a sexually violent predator. There was sufficient evidence \r\n  to reasonably support that finding. Therefore, we cannot disturb the finding.\r\nWhitcraft also argues that the Act violates the \r\n  ex post facto clause of both the U.S. and the South Carolina Constitutions. \r\n  That contention, however, is without merit since our supreme court has already \r\n  ruled that the Act is constitutional. The court held in In re: Luckabaugh, \r\n  351 S.C. at 135, 568 S.E.2d at 344 that â€œthe Act is a civil, non-punitive scheme.â€ \r\n  The court explained that a â€œstatute creating two types of civil commitment is \r\n  not per se punitive in violation of the ex post facto clause.â€ \r\n  Id. at 138, 568 S.E.2d at 246.\r\nSince the Act is constitutional, Whitcraftâ€™s third \r\n  argument must necessarily fail.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, J.J., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n    [1]  Our Supreme Court has held that the stateâ€™s Sexual \r\n    Violent Predator Act is essentially similar to the Kansas statute addressed \r\n    in Kansas. In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Allen, \r\n    351 S.C. 153, 156, 568 S.E.2d 354, 355 (2002) (citing In the Matter of \r\n    the care and Treatment of McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 91, 551 S.E.2d 235, \r\n    238 (2001); In the Matter of the care and Treatment of Matthews, 354 \r\n    S.C. 638, 649, 550 S.E.2d 311, 316 (2001)). \r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]  The stateâ€™s expert indicated that \r\n    Whitcraft suffers from a serious form of pedophilia that could lead \r\n    to further offenses; that would be severe if left untreated; that he \r\n    could be treated in a non-residential facility; that Whicraft had cooperated \r\n    with the psychologist and accepted â€œsomeâ€ responsibility for his actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-019","title":"Real Estate Unlimited v.

Bulsa, of Inman, for Appellant.\r\nLeonard R. Jordan, Jr., Berry Quackenbush, of Columbia, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action to set aside \r\n  a tax deed, Felix Bulsa appeals on behalf of Rainbow Living Trust asserting \r\n  the master-in-equity in determining that as trustee, Bulsa cannot represent \r\n  the Trust in the action because he is not an attorney.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Trust was the high bidder at a tax \r\n  sale for the subject property held November 4, 1997.Â  Stephen Ford, the Delinquent \r\n  Tax Collector for Spartanburg County issued a tax deed to the Trust dated November \r\n  30, 1998 and recorded January 22, 1999.Â  \r\nOn June 21, 2000, Real Estate Unlimited, \r\n  L.L.C., which had purchased the property at a mortgage foreclosure sale by deed \r\n  dated April 23, 1998, brought an action to set aside the tax sale.Â  Bulsa, as \r\n  trustee for the Trust, filed an answer to Real Estate Unlimitedâ€™s complaint \r\n  and asserted a counterclaim.Â  In its reply to the counterclaim, Real Estate \r\n  Unlimited asserted that because Bulsa is not an attorney licensed to practice \r\n  law in South Carolina, he should not be allowed to represent the Trust in this \r\n  matter.Â  \r\nAt the beginning of the hearing before \r\n  the master-in-equity, counsel for Real Estate Unlimited again raised an objection \r\n  to Bulsa appearing on behalf of the Trust.Â  The master ruled he would not allow \r\n  Bulsa to argue on the Trustâ€™s behalf.Â  In his written order, the master again \r\n  stated that Bulsa could not represent the Trust because he is not an attorney.Â  \r\n  He held that as the pleadings served and filed by Bulsa were a nullity, the \r\n  Trust was deemed to be in default, and he would not address the issues raised \r\n  in the counterclaim.Â  In the same order, the master vacated the tax deed holding \r\n  the Delinquent Tax Collector for Spartanburg County failed to send the proper \r\n  owners of record the requisite notices.Â  Bulsa filed this appeal on behalf of \r\n  the Trust.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBulsa argues the master erred in holding Bulsa \r\n  was not allowed to represent the Trust.Â  We disagree. [1]   \r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated Section \r\n  40-5-310 (2001) provides, â€œNo person may practice or solicit the cause of another \r\n  person in a court of this State unless he has been admitted and sworn as an \r\n  attorney.â€Â  However, a citizen may prosecute or defend his own cause, if he \r\n  so desires.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-80 (Supp. 2002).Â  Although Bulsa maintains \r\n  the Trust is a â€œspecial legal entity,â€ he claims he was merely representing \r\n  himself by appearing on behalf of the Trust.Â  \r\nThe issue of whether a non-attorney trustee may \r\n  appear in court on behalf of the trust is novel in South Carolina.Â  However, \r\n  numerous other jurisdictions have addressed the issue and found a trusteeâ€™s \r\n  appearance in court on behalf of the trust would constitute the unauthorized \r\n  practice of law.Â  \r\nThe Supreme Court of Arkansas held a trustee who \r\n  is not a licensed attorney cannot practice law in matters relating to his trusteeship \r\n  on the theory that he is practicing for himself.Â  Arkansas Bar Assoc. v. \r\n  Union Natâ€™l Bank of Little Rock, 273 S.W.2d 408, 410 (Ark. 1954).Â  The court \r\n  explained that a trustee is not acting for himself and in connection with his \r\n  own business affairs but on the contrary is acting for others who ordinarily \r\n  would be the beneficiaries. Id. at 411.Â  \r\nThe Supreme Court of Nebraska noted that, â€œ[A]s \r\n  a general rule, a trust is not a legal personality, and the trustee is the proper \r\n  person to sue or be sued on behalf of suchÂ  trust.â€ Back Acres Pure Trust \r\n  v. Fahnlander, 443 N.W.2d 604, 605 (Neb. 1989).Â  However, the court found, \r\n  â€œthat a trusteeâ€™s duties in connection with his or her office do not include \r\n  the right to present argument pro se in courts of the state, because \r\n  in this capacity such trustee would be representing interests of others and \r\n  would therefore be engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nSimilarly, the United States Court of Appeals for \r\n  the Ninth Circuit held a personâ€™s status as trustee did not include the right \r\n  to present arguments pro se in federal court.Â  C.E. Pope Equity Trust \r\n  v. U.S., 818 F.2d 696, 697 (9th Cir. 1987).Â  It stated the trusteeâ€™s \r\n  status is that of fiduciary and his statutory responsibility was the orderly \r\n  administration of assets.Â  Id.Â  Although it noted the record did not \r\n  identify the trustâ€™s beneficiaries, it held because â€œ[the trustee] is not the \r\n  actual beneficial owner of the claims being asserted by the Trusts (so far as \r\n  one can tell from the record), he cannot be viewed as a â€˜partyâ€™ conducting his \r\n  â€˜own case personallyâ€™ within the meaning of [28 U.S.C. Â§ 1654]â€.Â  Id. \r\n  at 697-98.Â  See also Maisano v. Welcher, 940 F.2d 499 (9th \r\n  Cir. 1991) (finding that if property belonged to the trust, the trustees had \r\n  no standing to sue); Ziegler v. Nickel, 75 Cal.Rptr.2d 312 (Cal. Ct. \r\n  App. 1998) (stating a non-attorney trustee who represents the trust in court \r\n  is representing and affecting the interests of the beneficiary and is thus engaged \r\n  in the unauthorized practice of law); Lazy â€˜Lâ€™ Family Preservation Trust \r\n  v. First State Bank of Princeton, 521 N.E.2d 198 (Ill. App. Ct. 1988) (finding \r\n  that even if trust document purported to authorize person to represent trust \r\n  in court, it cannot empower him to practice law without a license); Salman \r\n  v. Newell, 885 P.2d 607 (Nev. 1994) (while taking no position on the validity \r\n  of trusts, holding non-attorney trustee may not represent trust in district \r\n  court or appellate court); Williams v. Global Constr. Co., 498 N.E.2d \r\n  500, 502 (Ohio Ct. App. 1985) (finding where trustee brought action in the name \r\n  of a trust, he was acting as an attorney for the trust and engaged in the unauthorized \r\n  practice of law); Life Science Church, Bible Camp &amp; Christian Liberty \r\n  Academy v. Shawano County, 585 N.W.2d 625, 334 (Wis. 1998) (â€œ[T]rustees \r\n  may appear in Wisconsin courts without licensed legal counsel only to represent \r\n  their own legal interests in their individual capacities, not to represent the \r\n  legal interests of their trusts or trust beneficiaries in their representative, \r\n  fiduciary capacities as trustees.â€).\r\nWe find these cases persuasive and hold section \r\n  40-5-80 does not authorize a non-attorney trustee of a valid trust to represent \r\n  the trust in the court of common pleas because the action would not be the trusteeâ€™s \r\n  â€œown causeâ€ but rather that of the trust and its beneficiaries.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  when assuming the Trust in this matter is valid, we hold the master did not \r\n  err in ruling Bulsa may not represent the Trust in his court.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â Â  For this opinion, we assume the Trust is a valid \r\n    trust.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-020","title":"Simpkins v.

Simpkins sued Joshua Bennett for damages allegedly arising from an automobile \r\n  accident.Â  The jury awarded Simpkins $14,000.00.Â  Simpkins appeals.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn February 18, 1998, the Corvette Bennett \r\n  was driving rear-ended the Pontiac Bonneville driven by Simpkins.Â  Bennett was \r\n  issued a ticket for the accident.Â  At the accident scene neither party complained \r\n  of injuries or requested an ambulance.Â  That night, Simpkins went to the emergency \r\n  room at Easley Medical Center.Â  She later sought treatment with Stephenson Chiropractic \r\n  Offices and Dr. Downey with Augusta Pain Management.Â  She also received physical \r\n  therapy and consulted with a surgeon.Â  At trial she submitted medical bills \r\n  totaling $10,272.00.Â  She also claimed $10,810.00 in lost wages from the date \r\n  of the accident until January 1999.Â  \r\nAfter the jury returned a verdict in favor \r\n  of Simpkins in the amount of $14,000.00, she moved for a new trial or new trial \r\n  nisi additur.Â  The court denied these motions.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\nSimpkins argues the trial court should \r\n  have granted her a new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine because the \r\n  jury disregarded the trial courtâ€™s instructions and did not properly include \r\n  all of her damages in its verdict.Â  \r\nUnder the thirteenth juror doctrine, the trial \r\n  court may grant a new trial if the court believes the evidence does not justify \r\n  the verdict.Â  Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 254, 387 S.E.2d 265, 267 \r\n  (1990).Â  â€œThis ruling has been termed a granting of a new trial on the facts.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 254, 387 S.E.2d at 267.Â  In addition, the court may grant a new \r\n  trial if the verdict is inconsistent and reflects the juryâ€™s confusion.Â  Sorin \r\n  Equip.

App. \r\n  1996).Â  In ruling on a new trial motion as the thirteenth juror, the trial court \r\n  may weigh the evidence and rely on his or her view of the circumstances.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  Basically, the doctrine permits the judge as the thirteenth juror to hang the \r\n  jury.Â  Folkens, 300 S.C. at 254, 387 S.E.2d at 267.Â  \r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for a new \r\n  trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine, this court considers only whether \r\n  there is any evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â  Haselden v. \r\n  Davis, 341 S.C. 486, 506, 534 S.E.2d 295, 306 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In order \r\n  to reverse the trial court when it denies a new trial under the thirteenth juror \r\n  doctrine, we must find the moving party was entitled to a directed verdict during \r\n  the trial.Â  Id.Â  Thus, this court must affirm the denial of the new trial \r\n  when viewing the evidence, and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom in \r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we find the evidence yields \r\n  more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina \r\n  State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  Neither the \r\n  trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues \r\n  or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, \r\n  350 S.C. 303, 308, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002).\r\nSimpkins argues that because she submitted evidence \r\n  of medical bills and lost wages incurred totaling $21,082.00, the verdict should \r\n  have been at a minimum that amount.Â  She asserts the juryâ€™s failure to award \r\n  her at least that amount demonstrates its failure to follow the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  instruction on the calculation of damages.Â  \r\nWhile Simpkins did submit evidence of damages totaling \r\n  over $21,000.00, it was within the juryâ€™s province to determine that not all \r\n  of the claimed damages were proximately caused by the accident.Â  Simpkins acknowledged \r\n  Bennettâ€™s Corvette was smaller than the Pontiac Bonneville she was driving.Â  \r\n  Corporal Page, the reporting officer, testified the accident caused at the most \r\n  minimal damage to either automobile and neither car was towed from the scene.Â  \r\n  Simpkins did not complain of any injuries at the scene of the accident and did \r\n  not request an ambulance.Â  \r\nSimpkins had been involved in two prior automobile \r\n  accidents in which she had sustained severe whiplash.Â  The more recent one occurred \r\n  in July of 1997.Â  As a result of that accident, her doctor assigned her a six \r\n  percent impairment rating to the entire body.Â  Simpkinsâ€™ discharge sheet from \r\n  the Easley Baptist Medical Center emergency room instructed her to see her family \r\n  doctor if she had any problems.Â  Rather than returning to the doctor who treated \r\n  her for the prior accidents, Simpkins sought treatment from a chiropractor.Â  \r\n  After the chiropractor released her in May of 1998, Simpkins sought treatment \r\n  from Dr. Downey with the Augusta Pain Management Center.Â  In reporting her prior \r\n  health history, she failed to disclose the prior accidents.Â  She also failed \r\n  to disclose the 1997 accident to her physical therapist.Â  \r\nDr. Downey acknowledged that when considering Simpkinsâ€™ \r\n  medical records, which Bennettâ€™s attorney provided him on the day of his deposition, \r\n  he could not determine whether Simpkins cervical nerve root problem came from \r\n  the most recent accident or was preexisting.Â  Dr. Downey also stated hypothyroidism, \r\n  a condition from which Simpkins suffers, could cause some of the symptoms Simpkins \r\n  experiences such as muscle aches and headaches.Â  In addition, Dr. Downey stated \r\n  chiropractic treatment could cause problems like Simpkins experiences.\r\nA surgeon, Dr. Estes, to whom Dr. Downey referred \r\n  Simpkins wrote back that it was difficult to tell whether Simpkins was using \r\n  full effort with her right arm and leg.Â  He stated that although she gave the \r\n  impression of generalized right-sided weakness, this did not fit her history.Â  \r\n  Bennett testified that in his previous meetings with Simpkins, she had not used \r\n  a cane when she walked.Â  \r\nThe record reveals no evidence to support Simpkinsâ€™ \r\n  claim for lost wages other than her testimony.Â  Prior to the accident, Simpkins \r\n  had lost her job with the post office.Â  She stated in her deposition that she \r\n  would return to that job if her pending claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity \r\n  Commission was resolved in her favor.Â  She claimed that after she lost her job, \r\n  she performed housekeeping services for two people earning $250.00 a week.Â  \r\n  Although she testified her chiropractor released her to return to work in May \r\n  of 1998, Simpkins claimed lost wages through January of 1999.Â  There is no other \r\n  evidence of a medical excuse from work in the record.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe fact that testimony is not contradicted directly does \r\n  not render it undisputed.Â  There remains the question of the inherent probability \r\n  of the testimony and the credibility of the witness or the interests of the \r\n  witness in the result of the litigation.Â  If there is anything tending to create \r\n  distrust in his or her truthfulness, the question must be left to the jury.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nBlack v. Hodge, 306 S.C. 196, 198, 410 S.E.2d \r\n  595, 596 (Ct. App. 1991) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).Â  \r\n\r\nIt was the right of the jury to consider the witnessesâ€™ \r\n  testimonies and determine that not all of the damages Simpkins claimed were \r\n  attributable to what was described by the reporting officer and Bennett as a \r\n  minor accident.Â  We cannot find from the juryâ€™s verdict, which was lower than \r\n  Simpkins expected, that the jury disregarded the trial courtâ€™s charge on damages.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in denying Simpkinsâ€™ motion \r\n  for a new trial under the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  \r\nSimpkins also argues the trial court erred in denying \r\n  her motions for new trial nisi additur or new trial absolute.Â  She asserts \r\n  the verdict was unreasonably low and that the jury was acting out of prejudice \r\n  or caprice. \r\nThe trial court alone has the power to \r\n  grant a new trial nisi when it finds the amount of the verdict to be \r\n  merely inadequate or excessive.Â  Oâ€™Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 526, \r\n  431 S.E.2d 555, 557 (1993). The denial of a motion for a new trial nisi \r\n  is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent \r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  On appeal of the denial of a motion for \r\n  a new trial nisi, this court will reverse only when the verdict is grossly \r\n  inadequate or excessive requiring the granting of a new trial absolute.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s decision to deny a \r\n  motion for new trial absolute is within its discretion and will not be reversed \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali \r\n  Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 9, 466 S.E.2d 727, 731 (1996).Â  When deciding a motion \r\n  to grant a new trial, the court must look at the testimony and inferences raised \r\n  in favor of the nonmoving party.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 302-03, \r\n  536 S.E.2d 408, 420 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œThe trial court must set aside a verdict \r\n  only when it is shockingly disproportionate to the injuries suffered and thus \r\n  indicates that passion, caprice, prejudice, or other considerations not reflected \r\n  by the evidence affected the amount awarded.â€Â  Id. at 302, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  at 420.Â  A juryâ€™s determination of damages is entitled to substantial deference \r\n  by this court.Â  Knoke v. S.C. Depâ€™t. of Parks, Recreation &amp; Tourism, \r\n  324 S.C. 136, 141, 478 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1996).Â  \r\nAs stated above, the jury had the right \r\n  to weigh the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses and determine that \r\n  not all of the damages Simpkins claimed were proximately caused by the 1999 \r\n  accident.Â  We find the verdict was not grossly inadequate or the result of passion, \r\n  caprice, prejudice, or some other influence.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial \r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in denying Simpkinsâ€™ motions for new trial \r\n  nisi and new trial absolute.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-021","title":"State v.

Stacey, of Columbia, for Appellant. \r\n\r\nDeputy Director for Legal Services Teresa A. Knox, Legal Counsel \r\n  Tommy Evans, Jr. and Legal Counsel J. Benjamin Aplin, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  William Edward Taylor appeals the \r\n  revocation of his probation, arguing the trial court erred when it considered \r\n  his arrest record during the revocation hearing.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nTaylor was sentenced as a habitual traffic offender \r\n  to five years imprisonment suspended to two years imprisonment and three years \r\n  probation.Â  During his probationary sentence, a probation arrest warrant was \r\n  issued charging him with failing to follow his agentâ€™s instructions and advice, \r\n  failing to report, failing to pay the public defender fund, and failing to pay \r\n  his supervision fees.Â  Taylor admitted the allegations in the warrant were true.Â  \r\n  In asking for mercy from the court, Taylor said he had â€œpretty much cleaned \r\n  up [his] act.â€Â  The court told Taylor it had his NCIC report and to be careful \r\n  not to contradict it.Â  When Taylor later admitted he previously had a drug problem \r\n  but that he had â€œbeen clean now for awhile, for a couple of years now,â€ the \r\n  court mentioned Taylorâ€™s arrests in multiple jurisdictions while on probation.Â  \r\n  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court revoked Taylorâ€™s probation in full, \r\n  reinstating the remainder of his suspended sentence.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTaylor argues the court erred in considering his arrest \r\n  record in imposing the maximum revocation.Â  We find no error.Â  \r\nProbation is a matter of grace, rather than a right \r\n  and revocation is a means to enforce the terms of probation.Â  State v. Hamilton, \r\n  333 S.C. 642, 648, 511 S.E.2d 94, 97 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The decision to revoke \r\n  probation is addressed to the circuit courtâ€™s discretion.Â  State v. Lee, \r\n  350 S.C. 125, 129, 564 S.E.2d 372, 374 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  This court will not \r\n  reverse the circuit courtâ€™s revocation of probation unless the decision was \r\n  influenced by an error of law, lacked evidentiary support, or constituted an \r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Taylor admitted to violating several terms of his probation.Â  \r\n  State v. Knapp, 338 S.C. 541, 543, 526 S.E.2d 741, 742 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n  Thus, the revocation clearly has evidentiary support.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the courtâ€™s decision does not appear \r\n  to have been an abuse of discretion or the product of a legal error.Â  Although \r\n  the court mentioned Taylorâ€™s arrest record, it did not do so until after it \r\n  had already made the determination on the record that the violations that Taylor \r\n  readily admitted to were substantial.Â  The court did not mention the arrests \r\n  when it announced its decision on revocation.Â  Our reading of the record does \r\n  not indicate the court considered any improper matters in its decision to revoke \r\n  Taylorâ€™s probationary sentence in full.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-022","title":"State v.

[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nKollyns, an inmate at McCormick Correctional Institution, \r\n  filed a petition for habeas corpus in the circuit court seeking the return of \r\n  20 good time days allegedly taken from him at a South Carolina Department of \r\n  Corrections minor disciplinary hearing.Â  It is unclear from the petition whether \r\n  Kollyns actually lost good time credits or was barred from earning them for \r\n  a period of time.Â  In his petition, Kollyns asserts he appealed the departmentâ€™s \r\n  ruling to the Administrative Law Judge Division (ALJD), but that the ALJD dismissed \r\n  his appeal pursuant to an en banc order regarding inmate appeals.Â  In its return, \r\n  the State moved to dismiss Kollynsâ€™ petition noting, among other things, the \r\n  only proper inquiry in a habeas corpus action is the legality of the petitionerâ€™s \r\n  present detention.Â  After a hearing, the circuit court dismissed the petition \r\n  on the grounds argued in the Stateâ€™s return.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe first note the circuit court properly dismissed \r\n  Kollynsâ€™ petition because the relief he sought, the return of good time credits, \r\n  was outside the scope of an action for habeas corpus.Â  Gibson v. State, \r\n  329 S.C. 37, 40, 495 S.E.2d 426, 427 (1998) (noting the purpose of habeas corpus \r\n  is to determine the legality of the petitionerâ€™s present detention and the only \r\n  relief that can be granted is release from custody). \r\nOn appeal, Kollyns for the first time seeks a remand \r\n  of his case to the ALJD.Â  He claims the ALJD has jurisdiction over his appeal \r\n  from the department of corrections pursuant to Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 \r\n  S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (1999).Â  However, because this issue was never raised \r\n  to the circuit court it is not proper for our review.Â  State v.

Michael Taylor, of Columbia, and Joseph O. Burroughs, \r\n  Jr., of Conway, for Appellant.\r\nMichael W. Self, of Sumter, and Robert L. Widener, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis \r\n  is a post-divorce relocation case in which Gina Marlowe McDowell (Mother) remarried \r\n  and seeks to move to Raleigh, North Carolina with the partiesâ€™ two children.Â  \r\n  The family court denied her relocation request and ordered that if Mother relocated \r\n  to Raleigh, custody of the children would transfer to Kevin L. McDowell (Father).Â  \r\n  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties were married in 1989 and \r\n  their two children were born in 1991 and 1993.Â  In 1998, a divorce decree was \r\n  filed which incorporated and merged into it an agreement resolving child custody, \r\n  visitation, and support.Â  The agreement designated Mother as the primary custodial \r\n  parent for the two children. Â Throughout the marriage and subsequent \r\n  to the divorce, the parties have resided in Conway, South Carolina. \r\nThe agreement specified Fatherâ€™s visitation \r\n  schedule, which included:Â  1) alternating weekends from Friday at 6:00 p.m. \r\n  until Monday morning; 2) one weeknight per week; 3) four weeks in the summer; \r\n  4) splitting Christmas holidays and spring break; 5) alternating Easter, Thanksgiving \r\n  and Halloweens; and 6) providing Fatherâ€™s Day and Fatherâ€™s birthday visitation \r\n  to Father.Â  The agreement also provided that the parties believed it is in the \r\n  best interest of the children for both parents to be actively involved in their \r\n  lives.Â Â  Finally, the agreement placed no restrictions on relocation.Â  \r\nMotherâ€™s new husband is a member of \r\n  a band, which is based in Raleigh, North Carolina.Â  She brought this action \r\n  seeking to modify the custody agreement to allow her to relocate to Raleigh \r\n  due to her remarriage and because she believes it in the best interest of the \r\n  children.Â  Father sought to maintain the current visitation arrangements and \r\n  argued his visitation would be diminished, as would his ability to remain active \r\n  in the childrenâ€™s activities.Â  Father sought a change of custody and a restraining \r\n  order prohibiting Mother from relocating with the children. \r\nA temporary restraining order was issued \r\n  prohibiting Mother from relocating.Â  Additionally, the order required psychological \r\n  evaluations of the parties and children, and it appointed a Guardian ad Litem.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nThe family court entered its final ruling \r\n  enjoining Mother from relocating the children from the State of South Carolina.Â  \r\n  The order further provided custody would change to Father if Mother moved to \r\n  North Carolina.Â  The order also adjusted the amount of child support to be paid \r\n  by Father.Â  Finally, the order required Mother to pay $5,000.00 towards Fatherâ€™s \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees. Â Motherâ€™s motion for reconsideration was denied. \r\nMother filed an emergency motion to \r\n  stay the decision.Â  The family court denied the stay.Â  Mother subsequently filed \r\n  with this Court a petition for writ of supersedeas, which was also denied.Â  \r\n  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from all equity actions \r\n  including those from the Family Court, the appellate court has authority to \r\n  find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of evidence.â€ \r\n  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  \r\n  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard the family \r\n  courtâ€™s findings.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d \r\n  616, 617 (1981).Â  Similarly, we are not obligated to ignore the fact the family \r\n  court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate \r\n  their testimony.Â  Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 453, 486 S.E.2d 516, \r\n  519 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œThis is especially true in cases involving the welfare \r\n  and best interests of children.â€Â  Aiken County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilcox, \r\n  304 S.C. 90, 93, 403 S.E.2d 142, 144 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Moreover, our broad scope \r\n  of review does not â€œrelieve the appellant of the burden of convincing this Court \r\n  that the family court committed error.â€Â  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, \r\n  523, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRelocation\r\nMother maintains \r\n  the family court erred in issuing the restraining order prohibiting her from \r\n  relocating the children to Raleigh, North Carolina.Â  She contends the court \r\n  imposed too harsh of a burden on her to prove it was in the best interest of \r\n  the children to move, and the facts of the case demonstrate it was in their \r\n  best interest. [1] Â  We disagree, \r\n  and find the court correctly denied Motherâ€™s request to relocate and conditioned \r\n  her custody of the children on her remaining in Conway.\r\nâ€œ[I]n the absence of a change of circumstances \r\n  affecting the welfare of the child, â€˜a final decree of divorce awarding custody \r\n  in accordance with an agreement of the parties is conclusive between them.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 143, 245 S.E.2d 612, 616 (1978) (quoting \r\n  Sharpe v. Sharpe, 256 S.C. 517, 521, 183 S.E.2d 325, 327 (1971)). â€œIn \r\n  order for a court to grant a change of custody based on changed circumstances, \r\n  the party seeking the change must meet the burden of showing changed circumstances \r\n  occurring subsequent to the entry of the order in question.â€Â  Hollar v. Hollar, \r\n  342 S.C. 463, 473, 536 S.E.2d 883, 888 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œA change in circumstances \r\n  justifying a change in the custody of a child simply means that sufficient facts \r\n  have been shown to warrant the conclusion that the best interests of the child \r\n  will be served by the change.â€Â  Skinner, 272 S.C. at 523, 252 S.E.2d \r\n  at 892-93.Â  â€œ[T]he change of circumstance relied on for a change of custody \r\n  must be such as would substantially affect the interest and the welfare of the \r\n  child, not merely the parties, their wishes or convenience.â€Â  Sharpe v. Sharpe, \r\n  256 S.C. 517, 521, 183 S.E.2d 325, 327 (1971).Â  Remarriage alone is not sufficient \r\n  to warrant modification of a custody decree.Â  Pitt v. Olds, 333 S.C. \r\n  478, 481, 511 S.E.2d 60, 61 (1999).\r\nâ€œâ€˜The welfare of the child and what is in his/her \r\n  best interest is the primary, paramount and controlling consideration of the \r\n  court in all child custody controversies.â€™â€Â  Davis v. Davis, 356 S.C. \r\n  132, 135, 588 S.E.2d 102, 103-04 (2003) (quoting Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. \r\n  136, 140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614 (1978)).Â  â€œCustody decisions are matters left \r\n  largely to the discretion of the trial court.â€Â  Henggeler v. Hanson, \r\n  333 S.C. 598, 602, 510 S.E.2d 722, 725 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œ[T]he appellate court \r\n  should be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child \r\n  custody for that of the trial court.â€Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, \r\n  10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).\r\nIn terms of the procedural requirements necessary \r\n  for a partyâ€™s request for relocation, our Supreme Court has held that there \r\n  is a presumption in child custody cases against removing children from the state.Â  \r\n  McAlister v. Patterson, 278 S.C. 481, 483, 299 S.E.2d 322, 323 (1982).Â  \r\n  The courts of this state have consistently recognized the decision in McAlister.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., Rice v. Rice, 335 S.C. 449, 453, 517 S.E.2d 220, 222 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999); Henggeler v. Hanson, 333 S.C. 598, 604, 510 S.E.2d 722, \r\n  726 (Ct. App. 1998); VanName v. VanName, 308 S.C. 516, 519, 419 S.E.2d \r\n  373, 374 (Ct. App. 1992); Eckstein v. Eckstein, 306 S.C. 167, 169, 410 \r\n  S.E.2d 578, 580 (Ct. App. 1991); Sealy v. Sealy, 295 S.C. 281, 284, 368 \r\n  S.E.2d 85, 87 (Ct. App. 1988); Marshall v. Marshall, 282 S.C. 534, 541, \r\n  320 S.E.2d 44, 48-49 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  A party may rebut this presumption by \r\n  showing that the move will benefit the child.Â  Rice v. Rice, 335 S.C. \r\n  449, 454, 517 S.E.2d 220, 222 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Therefore, â€œthe question of \r\n  whether relocation will be allowed requires a determination of whether the relocation \r\n  is in the best interest of the children, the primary consideration in all child \r\n  custody cases.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThis Court has discussed the relevant \r\n  factors a court may consider in making a decision regarding whether to allow \r\n  relocation.Â  Rice v. Rice, 335 S.C. 449, 457-58, 517 S.E.2d 220, 224-25 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In Rice, the parties married and had three children.Â  \r\n  Throughout the marriage, the parties primarily resided in Conway, South Carolina.Â  \r\n  After several separations, the parties separated a final time after approximately \r\n  five and a half years of marriage.Â  During the separation, but before either \r\n  party requested temporary relief, Mother and the children moved to Maine in \r\n  an area that was twenty miles from Motherâ€™s two brothers and her sister.Â  At \r\n  the conclusion of the divorce proceedings, the family court granted custody \r\n  of the children to Mother.Â  The court, however, determined that Motherâ€™s move \r\n  to Maine would jeopardize the childrenâ€™s relationship with Father and that the \r\n  childrenâ€™s best interest would be served by requiring Mother to return from \r\n  Maine.Â  The court ordered Mother to return to South Carolina or any other location \r\n  within 250 miles of Conway as long as Father resided there.Â  \r\nOn appeal, this Court considered whether the family \r\n  court properly required Mother to return to South Carolina or to within 250 \r\n  miles of Conway.Â  In deciding this issue, we recognized that in this state there \r\n  exists a presumption in child custody cases against removing children from the \r\n  state.Â  Id. at 453, 517 S.E.2d at 222.Â  We also noted that this presumption \r\n  might be rebutted by a showing that the move will benefit the child. Id. \r\n  at 454, 517 S.E.2d at 222.Â  Because South Carolina case law provided limited \r\n  guidance â€œas to how a court should determine whether an out-of-state move is \r\n  in the best interest of the children,â€ this Court considered cases from other \r\n  jurisdictions.Â  Id. at 456, 517 S.E.2d at 224-25.Â  After gleaning certain \r\n  guiding principles from these cases, we applied the established factors to the \r\n  facts of the Rice appeal.\r\nThis Court found most important that the quality \r\n  of life for the children would be greatly increased by allowing Mother to relocate \r\n  to Maine.Â  Id. at 459, 517 S.E.2d at 225.Â  In Maine, Mother would be \r\n  able to obtain training, find better long-term employment, receive childcare \r\n  from the state, and qualify for subsidies allowing the family to move into a \r\n  four-bedroom apartment.Â  Additionally, the children would be moving closer to \r\n  family, who could help care for the children while Mother was receiving her \r\n  training.Â  Id.Â  The Court found Motherâ€™s motives were purely to benefit \r\n  her children and not to frustrate the visitation of Father.Â  Id. at 460, \r\n  517 S.E.2d at 226.Â  Finally, this Court found that the benefits to the children \r\n  and Mother must be balanced with the detrimental effect the move would have \r\n  on Fatherâ€™s visitation.Â  Id. at 461, 517 S.E.2d at 226.Â  This Court stated:Â  \r\n  â€œWhile the Fatherâ€™s relationship with the children is extremely important, it \r\n  is but one of the factors that goes into the sometimes nebulous best-interest \r\n  determination.â€Â  Id. at 462, 517 S.E.2d at 227.Â  We concluded the best \r\n  interest of the children would be served by allowing relocation.\r\nIn the instant case, we find the family \r\n  court properly applied the Rice factors in reaching its decision that \r\n  the best interest of the children would not be served by allowing the relocation.Â  \r\n  While Motherâ€™s income would increase slightly, there would not be a significant \r\n  difference.Â  Additionally, Mother attempts to articulate quality of life improvements \r\n  that would result from a move, including better cultural opportunities, better \r\n  schools, and better healthcare.Â  The record provides little evidence of any \r\n  significant upgrade from the familyâ€™s current situation in Horry County if the \r\n  relocation to Raleigh is allowed.Â  The only major change would be the benefit \r\n  of being able to live with Motherâ€™s new husband closer to his job.Â  Moreover, \r\n  the record reflects the children are both performing well in their studies and \r\n  on standardized tests in their respective Horry County schools. \r\nNext, we agree with the courtâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that neither Motherâ€™s nor Fatherâ€™s actions were motivated by an improper purpose.Â  \r\n  Based on our review of the record, we find no evidence that Motherâ€™s request \r\n  to relocate was intended to frustrate Fatherâ€™s visitation rights.Â  Instead, \r\n  it stemmed from her desire to live with her new husband near his job.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  we believe Father provided legitimate reasons for his opposition to the move \r\n  that were based on his good-faith desire to maintain a relationship with his \r\n  children.Â  \r\nAny move would come at an expense to \r\n  the visitation and relationship Father enjoys with his children.Â  While some \r\n  of his weekday visitation is reduced by his need to work late, he has actively \r\n  participated in the childrenâ€™s lives.Â  He has attended lunches at school and \r\n  after-school activities.Â  His ability to participate on a regular basis would \r\n  be greatly reduced.Â  This detrimental aspect of the relocation was the focus \r\n  of the determination by the Guardian ad Litem that relocation was not in the \r\n  childrenâ€™s best interest.Â  Fatherâ€™s participation in many areas of the childrenâ€™s \r\n  lives is too meaningful to allow the move simply on the basis of Motherâ€™s remarriage.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, a move would also limit the childrenâ€™s contact with the extended \r\n  family members who reside in the Conway area. Â Significantly, there is \r\n  no such support system in terms of extended family in North Carolina.Â  \r\nIn her argument on this issue, \r\n  Mother focuses upon Fatherâ€™s sexual history and activities.Â Â  She expresses \r\n  concern that he has admitted in the past to being a sex addict.Â  However, Dr. \r\n  Saylor, the court-appointed psychologist, noted there was nothing to prevent \r\n  Father from being a qualified parent. Â Additionally, Mother believed \r\n  he was a good Father and offered additional time in the summer to compensate \r\n  him for the time lost during the school year.Â  As the Guardian concluded, it \r\n  is hard to believe Mother would offer additional time for the children to spend \r\n  with Father if his behavior was seen as a detriment to their development. \r\nAdditionally, in assessing the best \r\n  interest of the children, we have specifically considered the opinions of the \r\n  Guardian and Dr. Saylor with regard to relocation.Â  The Guardian recommended \r\n  that the children not be allowed to relocate.Â  He felt it to be in the childrenâ€™s \r\n  best interest to remain in Horry County under the current custodial and visitation \r\n  arrangement.Â  Dr. Saylor seemed to suggest that the children could benefit from \r\n  the move and the move would be â€œcompatible with their needs and best interest.â€Â  \r\n  However, when questioned further, Dr. Saylor did not give a conclusive opinion \r\n  as to whether it would in fact be in the childrenâ€™s best interest.Â  He believed \r\n  that such a determination could not be done â€œjust from a psychological evaluation.â€ \r\n  Â Instead, he agreed with the assessment that there was â€œno indication \r\n  that relocation would be contrary to the childrenâ€™s best interest.â€Â  He \r\n  also acknowledged that there would be no long-term negative impact on the children \r\n  if they moved with Mother. \r\nWe recognize that â€œa determination of the best \r\n  interest of the children is an inherently case-specific and fact-specific inquiry.â€Â  \r\n  Rice, 335 S.C. at 458, 517 S.E.2d at 225; see Davenport v. \r\n  Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975) (In child custody \r\n  cases, â€œthe totality of circumstances peculiar to each case constitutes the \r\n  only scale upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.â€).Â  As the family \r\n  court found, the facts of this case weigh strongly in favor of maintaining the \r\n  current custody and visitation arrangements with both parents residing in Horry \r\n  County. Â Motherâ€™s interest in relocating is primarily based upon her remarriage, \r\n  and the relocation does not have the effect of greatly improving the childrenâ€™s \r\n  quality of life.Â  Under the facts of this case, we find the best interest of \r\n  the children is served by living in close proximity to Father.Â  See Pitt \r\n  v. Olds, 333 S.C. 478, 481-82, 511 S.E.2d 60, 62 (1999) (holding remarriage \r\n  alone was insufficient to modify existing decree under which Mother, as custodial \r\n  parent, was required to remain in South Carolina); McAlister, 278 S.C. \r\n  at 483-84, 299 S.E.2d at 323 (affirming family courtâ€™s denial of Motherâ€™s request \r\n  to move where childâ€™s best interest and welfare would best be served by remaining \r\n  in South Carolina near Father, friends, and other relatives).Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find Mother has not rebutted the \r\n  long-established presumption against removing the children from South Carolina.Â  \r\n  Although Mother disagrees with this presumption, we have no authority to overrule \r\n  or modify the decision in McAlister.Â  See Bain v. Self Memâ€™l \r\n  Hosp., 281 S.C. 138, 141, 314 S.E.2d 603, 605 (Ct. App. 1984), overruled \r\n  on other grounds by McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 \r\n  (1985). (â€œWhere the law has been recently addressed by our Supreme Court and \r\n  is unmistakably clear, this court has no authority to change it.â€); Shea \r\n  v. State Depâ€™t of Mental Retardation, 279 S.C. 604, 608, 310 S.E.2d 819, \r\n  821 (Ct. App. 1983) (â€œThe maintenance of a harmonious body of decisional law \r\n  is essential to the efficient administration of justice.Â  Therefore, if the \r\n  judicial system is to operate efficiently, this court must be bound by decisions \r\n  of the Supreme Court.â€). Â Therefore, the family courtâ€™s order regarding relocation \r\n  and custody is affirmed.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Child Support \r\n  Calculation\r\nMother asserts the family court erred \r\n  in considering $49.00 in payment for the childrenâ€™s health insurance when calculating \r\n  the child support owed by Father.Â  Father agrees that he does not separately \r\n  pay for the childrenâ€™s insurance because it is included in his union payments \r\n  for his own insurance.Â  \r\nIn considering the insurance, the court concluded \r\n  Father owed $681.00 in support. As such, we find the court incorrectly calculated \r\n  the amount of child support owed to Mother.Â  The correct amount should be $700.26 \r\n  per month in child support.Â  The family courtâ€™s order is modified to the extent \r\n  that child support is set at $700.26 per month, with the same provisions for \r\n  payment as articulated in the trial courtâ€™s order.\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nMother contends the family court erred \r\n  in requiring her to pay $5,000.00 of Fatherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  She maintains \r\n  that this was a close case and that she also received beneficial results in \r\n  the modified child support.Â  We find the court properly assessed a portion of \r\n  Fatherâ€™s fees to Mother.\r\nIn Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 \r\n  S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991), our Supreme Court established the factors for \r\n  the family court to consider in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family court \r\n  is to consider:Â  â€œ(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the \r\n  time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; \r\n  (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; (6) customary \r\n  legal fees for similar services.â€Â  Id. at 161, 403 S.E.2d at 315.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the court expressly \r\n  considered the Glasscock factors.Â  While child support was an issue, \r\n  there is little doubt that the issue of Motherâ€™s attempt to relocate was the \r\n  predominant reason for litigation.Â  The court found that Father obtained beneficial \r\n  results in the main issue tried before the court.Â  Additionally, the court found \r\n  the hourly rate and the time spent on the case by Fatherâ€™s counsel was reasonable \r\n  and consistent with rates charged in the area for similar services.Â  As it is \r\n  clear the court considered the relevant factors, and those factors favor Father, \r\n  we affirm the award of $5,000.00 attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family court properly found \r\n  the relocation was not in the best interest of the children.Â  As such, the court \r\n  properly denied Motherâ€™s request to relocate and conditioned her custody of \r\n  the children on her remaining in Conway.Â  We conclude the courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees was proper.Â  We modify the courtâ€™s award of child support to correct for \r\n  the error in calculation.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â  In her brief, Mother raises three separate arguments regarding \r\n    the relocation issue.Â  In the interest of clarity, we have consolidated these \r\n    arguments under one heading.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-029","title":"City of Myrtle Beach v.

Carotti, all of Conway; \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this declaratory judgment \r\n  action, the master-in-equity ruled the South Carolina Department of Transportation \r\n  (SCDOT) was authorized by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-25-190(E) (Supp. 2002) of the \r\n  Highway Advertising Control Act to relocate a non-conforming sign owned by Topp, \r\n  Inc, d/b/a Mr. Sub, (Mr. Sub), which absent the statute would lose its grandfathered \r\n  status under the City of Myrtle Beachâ€™s zoning ordinances upon relocation. Â The \r\n  City appeals, arguing SCDOT failed to fully comply with section 57-25-190(E).Â  \r\n  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMr. Sub is a restaurant located where \r\n  Broadway and U.S. Highway 17 intersect, in the vicinity of 10th Avenue \r\n  North in Myrtle Beach.Â  Mr. Sub constructed a freestanding on-site outdoor advertising \r\n  sign prior to the City passing an ordinance governing the size and placement \r\n  of outdoor advertising signs.Â  Mr. Subâ€™s sign became a grandfathered nonconforming \r\n  use because its height and area are greater than the ordinance allows.Â  According \r\n  to the ordinance, if the sign is relocated, it loses its grandfathered status.Â  \r\n\r\nAs part of a highway improvement project to widen \r\n  and realign 10th Avenue North, SCDOT condemned the portion of Mr. \r\n  Subâ€™s property that contained the sign and proposed to move the sign.Â  The City \r\n  filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that SCDOT did not have \r\n  the authority to move the sign.Â  It asserted the sign would lose its grandfathered \r\n  status if moved and SCDOT did not have the authority to violate the Cityâ€™s zoning \r\n  ordinances.Â  It also sought an injunction prohibiting SCDOT from relocating \r\n  the sign.Â  SCDOT answered asserting it had statutory authority to relocate the \r\n  sign notwithstanding the Cityâ€™s ordinance.Â  It asked the City be enjoined from \r\n  interfering with its relocation of the sign.Â  The circuit court granted SCDOTâ€™s \r\n  motion enjoining the City from enforcing its ordinances and referred the case \r\n  to the master-in-equity.Â  SCDOT relocated the sign eight feet back from its \r\n  original location.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing on the merits, the master \r\n  found that the Highway Advertising Control Act provides SCDOT with express authority \r\n  to relocate applicable signs, such as the Mr. Sub sign, regardless of any municipal \r\n  ordinance to the contrary.Â  He held SCDOT fully complied with section 57-25-190(E) \r\n  in its relocation of the sign.Â  Accordingly, he enjoined the City from interfering \r\n  with SCDOTâ€™s relocation of the sign.Â  In response to the Cityâ€™s motion to alter \r\n  or amend, the master amended his order to state, â€œSCDOTâ€™s relocation of the \r\n  sign is in violation of the Cityâ€™s zoning/sign ordinance.â€Â  He denied the remainder \r\n  of the motion. [1] Â  The City appealed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen an appeal involves stipulated or \r\n  undisputed facts, an appellate court is free to review whether the trial court \r\n  properly applied the law to those facts.â€Â  WDW Props. v. City of Sumter, \r\n  342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d 631, 632 (2000).Â  A dispute regarding the interpretation \r\n  of a statute is a matter of law for the court.Â  Stewart v. Richland Memâ€™l \r\n  Hosp., 350 S.C. 589, 593, 567 S.E.2d 510, 512 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe City argues the master erred in finding \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. 57-25-190(E) (Supp. 2002) gave SCDOT authority to move Mr. Subâ€™s \r\n  nonconforming sign.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs part of the Highway Advertising Control Act, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-25-110 et seq. (1991 &amp; Supp. 2002) the general \r\n  assembly enacted section 57-25-190(E), which provides:\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding a county or municipal zoning plan, ordinance, \r\n  or resolution, outdoor advertising signs conforming to [the Highway Advertising \r\n  Control Act] affected by state highway projects may be relocated . . . to a \r\n  position which is perpendicular to the right of way of the original sign site, \r\n  or may be altered so that no portion of the sign overhangs the right of way.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is \r\n  to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  Mid-State Auto \r\n  Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 \r\n  (1996).Â  The words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning \r\n  without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand its operation.Â  \r\n  Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d \r\n  843, 846 (1992).Â Â  The language of the statute must also be read in a sense \r\n  which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  â€œStatutes, as a whole, must receive practical, reasonable, and fair \r\n  interpretation, consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.â€Â  \r\n  TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, \r\n  503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[t]he construction of a statute by \r\n  the agency charged with its administration will be accorded the most respectful \r\n  consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling reasons.â€ Dunton \r\n  v. South Carolina Bd. of Examiners in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 \r\n  S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987).Â  \r\nThe first subsections of S.C. Code Ann. 57-25-190 (Supp. \r\n  2002) concern the requirement that SCDOT provide landowners with compensation \r\n  for the removal of outdoor advertising signs.Â  Subsection (E) provides a mechanism \r\n  for SCDOT to avoid paying compensation by relocating the sign, even when the \r\n  relocation would violate local ordinances.Â  Section 57-25-190(E) clearly contemplates \r\n  allowing the movement of a sign when SCDOT commences road projects that require \r\n  its removal.Â  \r\nThe City argues SCDOT was not in strict compliance \r\n  with the statute and therefore it could not relocate the sign in violation of \r\n  the Cityâ€™s ordinances.Â  It asserts that under its interpretation of the statute, \r\n  the line formed by connecting the two points represented by the original sign \r\n  site and the relocated position must be perpendicular to the right of way.Â  \r\n  We find this strained interpretation does not comport with the purpose of the \r\n  statute. \r\nRather, we agree with SCDOT engineer, \r\n  Michael Dennis, who testified he considers the face of the sign in determining \r\n  whether the sign is perpendicular.Â  The trial courtâ€™s interpretation of the \r\n  statute also focused on the location of the face of the sign.Â  Relocating the \r\n  sign where the signâ€™s face is perpendicular to same right of way of its original \r\n  site enables the same traffic to view the sign.Â  Thus, the owner of the sign \r\n  receives the same benefit as it did from the signâ€™s original location, eliminating \r\n  the need for SCDOT to provide the owner with compensation.Â  \r\nDennis testified that before the relocation, \r\n  the Mr. Sub signâ€™s face was perpendicular to Highway 17.Â  After the relocation, \r\n  the signâ€™s face was still perpendicular to Highway 17.Â  We agree with the trial \r\n  court that SCDOT fully complied with all statutory provisions concerning the \r\n  relocation of the Mr. Sub sign.Â  Thus, SCDOT has the right and authority to \r\n  relocate the Mr. Sub sign to its present location.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. 2\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  The master also denied Mr. Subâ€™s request for \r\n    attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â  In its Respondentâ€™s brief, Mr. Sub states that its motion for reconsideration \r\n    of its petitions for fees and costs has been stayed pending this appeal.Â  \r\n    Mr. Sub then argues fees and costs are warranted under the circumstances and \r\n    continue to accrue during this appeal.Â  We do not address this contention \r\n    as it is not properly before this court.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-030","title":"Meehan v.

Mullinax, of Anderson, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This case involves whether \r\n  a conformed copy of a will should be admitted to probate.Â  Jerry Meehan as Personal \r\n  Representative of the estate of Sammie Bruce, appeals the circuit courtâ€™s reversal \r\n  of the probate courtâ€™s order, which accepted the conformed copy of the will \r\n  for probate.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBruce died on July 8, 1999 from cancer after a period \r\n  of hospitalization and recuperative care at National Healthcare between mid-April, \r\n  1999 and her death.Â  During this time period she appointed her great-nephew \r\n  Paul Embler as power of attorney to handle her affairs.Â  As part of his duties, \r\n  Mr. Embler secured Bruceâ€™s residence by changing the locks, handled her finances, \r\n  and made specific gifts at her request.Â  Repeatedly, Embler asked Bruce about \r\n  updating her â€œpaperworkâ€ and about the location of her â€œpaperwork.â€Â  She told \r\n  him that her â€œimportant papers were in a dresser drawer.â€Â  \r\nBefore Bruceâ€™s death, Mr. Embler went with his \r\n  aunt Ella Hendrix to the residence to search for the â€œimportant papers.â€Â  They \r\n  found a dresser drawer with various documents in it that they then removed.Â  \r\n  One of the documents that appeared to Mr. Embler to be a will was opened and \r\n  read by him.Â  It stated that Meehan, another great-nephew of Bruce, was named \r\n  as Personal Representative of Bruceâ€™s estate.Â  At the funeral, Mr. Embler gave \r\n  the documents to Meehan.Â  The documents included a conformed copy of Bruceâ€™s \r\n  will and not an original executed will.\r\nMeehan petitioned the probate court for formal \r\n  testacy and appointment as Personal Representative.Â  All testate heirs of Bruceâ€™s \r\n  estate and intestate heirs not listed as beneficiaries under the will were listed \r\n  as Respondents.Â  The probate court admitted the conformed copy of the will to \r\n  probate. The Probate Court Judge granted formal testacy and appointed Meehan \r\n  as Personal Representative of the estate.\r\nThe Respondents appealed the probate court findings \r\n  to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court found that there was no clear and convincing \r\n  evidence in the record to overcome the presumption that the original will had \r\n  been destroyed.Â  The court found that the will was not entitled to probate and \r\n  Bruceâ€™s estate must be administered as an intestate estate.Â  The circuit court \r\n  reversed and remanded the probate courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Meehan appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appeal from the probate court to the \r\n  circuit court regarding the validity of a will is a matter of law.Â  Golini \r\n  v. Bolton, 326 S.C. 333, 338, 482 S.E.2d 784, 787 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In an \r\n  action at law decided in the probate court, the circuit court may not disturb \r\n  the probate courtâ€™s findings of fact unless there is no evidence to support \r\n  them.Â  Matter of Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 361, 434 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1993).Â  \r\n  On appeal, this court will examine the record to see if there is any evidence \r\n  to reasonably support the factual findings of the probate court.Â  Dean v. \r\n  Kilgore, 313 S.C. 257, 259, 437 S.E.2d 154, 155 (Ct.App. 1993).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMeehan argues the circuit court erred \r\n  when it reversed the probate court because the evidence in the record supported \r\n  the probate courtâ€™s finding that Bruce did not intend to revoke her will.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nâ€œWhen the testator takes possession of \r\n  his will and it cannot be found at his death, the law presumes that the testator \r\n  destroyed the will animo revocandi.â€ Golini v. Bolton, 326 S.C. \r\n  333, 340, 482 S.E.2d 784, 787 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In arguing the presumption of \r\n  revocation does not apply, Meehan relies on Golini, asserting that the \r\n  facts of that case and the present one are similar.Â  In Giolini, the \r\n  probate court found that the will had not been revoked because the will had \r\n  been returned to the attorneyâ€™s office.Â  The attorneyâ€™s usual procedure was \r\n  to keep some executed wills for clients in his lock-box.Â  The probate court \r\n  held that as the testator never had possession of the will, the presumption \r\n  of revocation never arose.Â  It admitted a conformed copy of the will to probate.Â  \r\n  The probate courtâ€™s findings were affirmed by the circuit court and this court.Â  \r\n  We find Golini factually distinguishable from this case because the attorney \r\n  here did not take possession of Bruceâ€™s will after execution.\r\nSammie Bruce executed her will and took possession \r\n  of it on October 7, 1988.Â  Richard Ruele, the attorney who prepared a will for \r\n  Bruce on October 7, 1988, stated that it was routine practice for him at that \r\n  time to prepare an original will for his clients as well as a conformed copy.Â  \r\n  He stated that Bruce would have been given the only original will as well as \r\n  a conformed copy such as the one under discussion here.Â  We find the presumption \r\n  of revocation does arise in the present case.\r\nThis presumption, however, is a presumption of \r\n  fact and can be rebutted.Â  Bauskett v. Keitt, 22 S.C. 187, 191 (1885). \r\n  The burden of rebutting the presumption with clear and convincing evidence belongs \r\n  to the proponent of the will.Â  Estate of Mason v. Mason, 289 S.C.273, \r\n  277, 346 S.E.2d 28, 31 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  The presumption of fact must be rebutted \r\n  by showing evidence â€œthat the will existed at the time of his [the testatorâ€™s] \r\n  death, was lost subsequent thereto, or had been destroyed by another without \r\n  authority to do so.â€Â  Lowe v. Fickling, 207 S.C. 442, 447, 36 S.E.2d \r\n  293, 295.\r\nSammie Bruce had the copy of the will in her possession \r\n  from its execution in 1988 until she was hospitalized in 1999.Â  No original \r\n  will was found at her death.Â  In the drawer where Bruce said her important papers \r\n  were kept, there was no original will.Â  There were, however, only copies of \r\n  the 1988 will and a copy of a previous will.Â  Meehan produced no evidence, that \r\n  the original will was lost after Bruceâ€™s death.Â  Furthermore there was no evidence \r\n  presented of a third party destroying the will without her knowledge.Â  The probate \r\n  court speculated on the possibility that the decedentâ€™s will may have been destroyed \r\n  by a third party while Bruce was in the hospital.Â  However, the law does not \r\n  presume illegal acts.Â  Lowe v. Fickling, 207 S.C. 442, 447, 36 S.E.2d \r\n  293, 295.Â  \r\nReviewing the record, we find that Meehan did not \r\n  succeed in rebutting the presumption that Sammie Bruce destroyed the will by \r\n  clear and convincing evidence.Â  Accordingly, we hold the circuit court was correct \r\n  when it determined the probate court erred in admitting the copy of the will \r\n  to probate. [1] Â  \r\n AFFIRMED\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The respondents contend the probate court erred \r\n    when it decided to admit Emblerâ€™s testimony because the testimony violated \r\n    the Dead Manâ€™s Statute. S.C. Code Ann. Â§19-11-20 (Supp. 2002).Â  We need not \r\n    address this issue because even if the evidence was not properly admitted \r\n    the record still fails to rebut the presumption that Bruce revoked her will.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-031","title":"Clark v.

Moran, of Murrells Inlet, for Appellant. \r\nJack M. Scoville, Jr., of Georgetown, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Wedgefield Plantation Association sued \r\n  homeowners Cindy M. and Charles J. Chavis to enforce a provision of a restrictive \r\n  covenant requiring pre-approval by the Associationâ€™s Architectural Review Committee \r\n  of various structures on their property.Â  The referee ruled the Chavises were \r\n  in violation of the covenant and ordered the barriers removed, but denied the \r\n  Associationâ€™s request for costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The Association appeals \r\n  this one issue.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nEquity Development Corporation (\"EDCâ€), the original \r\n  developer, established Wedgefield Plantation as a gated community in the early \r\n  1970s.Â  Title to each of the single family lots was conveyed by indenture deed \r\n  which containing twenty-five specific restrictions and covenants.Â  Covenant \r\n  1 requires approval from EDC prior to the erection of any structure on a lot.Â  \r\n  EDC also organized the Association at the beginning of the project, and all \r\n  property owners were required to join pursuant to covenant 10. Â The indenture \r\n  deed also contained a number of provisions granting authority to EDC to enforce \r\n  the restrictions.Â  The indenture deed contained no provision for recovery of \r\n  costs and attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nThe Chavises purchased their home in 1999 by deed \r\n  that explicitly referenced the indenture deed.Â  At some point they installed \r\n  barriers at either end of their drive without seeking approval from the Associationâ€™s \r\n  Architectural Review Committee.Â  Because EDC went bankrupt and has been defunct \r\n  for many years, this action to enforce the covenants and restrictions was brought \r\n  by the Association to enforce covenant 1 of the indenture deed.Â  The referee \r\n  found the Chavises were in violation of the restrictions, but denied the Associationâ€™s \r\n  request for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  In denying the request, the referee \r\n  noted the indenture deed and not the by-laws constituted the contract between \r\n  the parties.Â  The referee also held that the right to recover attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  was controlled by the indenture deed, it contained no such provision, and there \r\n  had been no amendment consented to by the parties to include such a provision.Â  \r\n  The Association appeals the refereeâ€™s denial of costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAs a threshold issue, a question was raised at \r\n  the hearing as to the authority of the Association to enforce the restrictions \r\n  because the recorded covenants and restrictions only specifically refer to EDC \r\n  as having that authority.Â  However, there has been no appeal from the refereeâ€™s \r\n  ruling that the Association has standing and the authority to enforce the provisions \r\n  of the restrictions in the same fashion that EDC could have had EDC still been \r\n  in existence.Â  ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, LP v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, \r\n  327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (holding an unappealed ruling \r\n  is the law of the case and cannot be later challenged).Â Â Â  \r\nThe Association further argues that its by-laws \r\n  are enforceable as a contract between the Association and its members and among \r\n  its members and, therefore, provisions within the by-laws authorizing costs \r\n  and attorneyâ€™s fees should be given effect.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is well established that \"[a]ttorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.â€Â  Dowaliby \r\n  v. Chambless, 344 S.C. 558, 544 S.E.2d 646, 647-648 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting \r\n  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 307, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759 (1997)); see \r\n  also Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 493, 427 S.E.2d 659, \r\n  660 (1993) (\"The general rule is that attorneyâ€™s fees are not recoverable unless \r\n  authorized by contract or statute.â€). \r\nThe referee held that the Association succeeded \r\n  to the rights of EDC and had standing to enforce the covenants as its assign.Â  \r\n  McLeod v. Baptiste, 315 S.C. 246, 433 S.E.2d 834, 835 (1993) (\"[A] person \r\n  seeking to enforce a covenant must be benefited by that actâ€). Â However, that \r\n  enforcement authority was limited to the powers reserved to EDC as outlined \r\n  in the indenture deed.Â  At common law, an assigneeâ€™s rights and powers can be \r\n  no greater than those of his assignor.Â  Rosemond v. Campbell, 288 S.C. \r\n  516, 523, 343 S.E.2d 641, 645 (Ct. App. 1986) (citing Dixie Wood Preserving \r\n  Co. v. Albert Gersten &amp; Associates, 244 S.C. 57, 135 S.E.2d 368 (1964)).Â  \r\n  Here, the original grantorâ€™s authority was derived from the indenture deed referenced \r\n  in each property ownerâ€™s deed.Â  The indenture deed was the contract between \r\n  the homeowners and EDC, and makes no mention of any right to an award of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs.Â  Accordingly, the original grantor could not have collected \r\n  fees and costs and therefore neither may the Association.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-034","title":"Woodson v.

Coombs Jr., all of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  Jonathan Toney appeals his \r\n  assault and battery conviction, arguing that the trial judge erred by declining \r\n  to continue the trial and by allowing into evidence a picture depicting an injury \r\n  to the victimâ€™s head.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn January 2002, a Sumter county jury \r\n  convicted Defendant Jonathan Toney of assault and battery with intent to kill. \r\n  The indictment was based on events that took place in February 2001. On January \r\n  22, 2002, the day the trial was to start, Toney sought a continuance, arguing \r\n  that Toney had not received some key evidence from the prosecution in a timely \r\n  manner. The trial had been continued at least once before at Toneyâ€™s request, \r\n  but Toney wanted more time for his expert to scrutinize a SLED report Toney \r\n  reviewed on January 8. That report showed that the DNA retrieved from the alleged \r\n  crime weapon was inconclusive because of the insufficient quantity. Toney also \r\n  wanted more time for an \"Evidence Processing Reportâ€ he received on January \r\n  18. That report had apparently been completed as early as August 2000 and listed \r\n  some crime-related items, including swabs from a tire iron, clothing belonging \r\n  to Toney, and a pair of gray tennis shoes. \r\nThe prosecution responded that Toneyâ€™s attorney \r\n  was already aware of those items, and that, at any rate, the state had either \r\n  already conducted some tests that yielded no results or had decided not to test \r\n  the items. The prosecutor declared, \"every [test] that is going to be done has \r\n  been done.â€ The state also argued that Toney and his expert had been told to \r\n  contact SLED directly if they wanted more details about the evidence. The judge \r\n  denied the motion to continue the trial, ruling that \"the defense has been afforded \r\n  sufficient time to analyze, to evaluate, and to be ready for trial.â€ \r\nAdditionally, the judge overruled Toneyâ€™s objection \r\n  to stateâ€™s exhibit #36, a picture depicting an injury to the victimâ€™s head. \r\n  The judge allowed the picture, finding that \"the probative value is not outweighed \r\n  by the prejudicial effect.â€ Toney appeals both rulings.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Did the trial court abuse its \r\n  discretion in denying Toneyâ€™s motion for continuance?\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court abuse its \r\n  discretion in allowing stateâ€™s exhibit #36?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\"It is well-settled in South Carolina \r\n  that a trial court's denial of a motion for continuance â€˜will not be disturbed \r\n  absent a clear abuse of discretion.â€™â€ State v. McKennedy, 348 S.C. 270, \r\n  280, 559 S.E.2d 850, 855 (2002) (citing State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, \r\n  459, 469 S.E.2d 49, 51 (1996)). Moreover, reversals are granted very rarely. \r\n  Id. Appellate courts have \"repeatedly upheld denials of motions for continuances \r\n  where there is no showing that any other evidence on behalf of the defendant \r\n  could have been introduced, or that any other points could have been raised, \r\n  if more time had been granted to prepare for trial.â€ Id.\r\nHere, the trial judge held a hearing and ascertained \r\n  the arguments of both parties. He specifically asked counsel for Toney if in \r\n  fact he had had a chance to review the evidence at SLED â€“ counsel responded \r\n  that he had. The trial judge asked whether Toneyâ€™s expert needed more time to \r\n  conduct his own testing â€“ counsel responded \"I donâ€™t know that â€¦ he necessarily \r\n  needs more time to evaluate any additional documentation that is provided.â€ \r\n  The trial judge asked whether the trial had been continued before â€“ counsel \r\n  said yes. What is more, counsel admitted that the state had \"been very candid \r\n  with providing an open-file policy.â€ Counsel provided no indication that the \r\n  continuance would provide additional exculpatory evidence. The judge then made \r\n  his ruling \"based on all the information presented.â€ The judge clearly did not \r\n  abuse his discretion.\r\nToneyâ€™s second objection is equally meritless. \r\n  \"The relevancy, materiality, and admissibility of photographs as evidence are \r\n  matters left to the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Johnson, \r\n  338 S.C.114, 122, 525 S.E.2d 519, 523 (2000) (citing State v. Kornahrens, \r\n  290 S.C.281, 288, 350 S.E.2d 180, 185 (1986). \"However, photographs calculated \r\n  to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury should be excluded if they are \r\n  irrelevant or unnecessary to the issues at trial.â€ Id. (citing State \r\n  v. Middleton, 288 S.C. 21, 24, 339 S.E.2d 692, 693 (1986)).Â  \r\nThe state argued that the photograph was relevant, \r\n  since it showed an injury on top of the victimâ€™s head, corroborating her testimony \r\n  that she was kneeling when Toney struck her. The trial judge ruled that the \r\n  photograph was relevant and that its prejudicial effect was less than its probative \r\n  value. We cannot say that the judge abused his discretion.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-039","title":"SPD Investment Company v.

Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  SPD Investment Company, LLC, \r\n  sued the County of Charleston seeking the return of money it spent to redeem \r\n  a property sold at a tax sale that was later deemed void.Â  The master granted \r\n  the Countyâ€™s motions for summary judgment.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, \r\n  and remand. \r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\n  SPD was formed in 1997.Â  SPDâ€™s organizing documents listed Robert \r\n    Shuman and Sunbelt Business Brokers Network, Inc. as its members and Shuman \r\n    as its manager.Â  SPDâ€™s place of business was listed as 2 Amherst Street in \r\n    Charleston, property the corporation purchased simultaneously with its formation.Â  \r\n    The deed to the property on 2 Amherst Street stated the granteeâ€™s address \r\n    as 42 Savage Street in Charleston, which was Shumanâ€™s personal residence.Â  \r\n    In July 1998, Shuman left SPD and transferred his ownership interest in SPD \r\n    to Sunbelt.Â  SPD filed amended organizing documents in which it continued \r\n    to show 2 Amherst Street as its place of business.Â  \r\n  The 1998 property taxes were not paid for 2 Amherst Street.Â  In \r\n    April 1999, the delinquent tax collector for Charleston County mailed an execution \r\n    notice to Shumanâ€™s residence, notifying SPD that the 1998 taxes were past \r\n    due.Â  Shuman had moved to Boston and the execution notice was returned to \r\n    the delinquent tax collector marked either \"Forwarding Time Expired, Return \r\n    to Senderâ€ or \"Forwarding Address Expired, Return to Sender.â€Â  Pursuant to \r\n    statute, the delinquent tax collector mailed a second notice by certified \r\n    restricted delivery to Shumanâ€™s residence.Â  That notice informed SPD the 1998 \r\n    property taxes must be paid by October 1, 1999 to avoid the tax sale scheduled \r\n    for October 4, 1999.Â  Shumanâ€™s wife signed the return receipt.Â  \r\n  The Amherst Street property was sold to TransAm Financial Group \r\n    for $300,000 at a tax sale.Â  SPD learned the property was sold after the tax \r\n    sale.Â  SPDâ€™s attorney communicated with the County, contending the tax sale \r\n    was void because SPD had not received notice.Â  The County refused to void \r\n    the tax sale and SPD paid $43,413.47, of which $36,000 was interest, to redeem \r\n    the property.Â  SPD paid this amount under protest.Â  \r\n  SPD filed suit against the County alleging the tax sale was void \r\n    because the County failed to give SPD proper notice, and sought the return \r\n    of the money it spent to redeem the property.Â  SPD also asked for interest \r\n    it paid to borrow the money necessary to redeem the property.Â  The complaint \r\n    was amended to include TransAm and TransAm filed a cross-claim against the \r\n    County seeking payment of the interest SPD paid to redeem the property.Â  SPD \r\n    moved for summary judgment on its cause of action to declare the tax sale \r\n    void and obtain the return of the redemption money it paid.Â  The County filed \r\n    summary judgment motions on both of SPDâ€™s causes of action.Â  \r\n  After a hearing on the motions, the master denied SPDâ€™s motion and \r\n    granted the County summary judgment on both of SPDâ€™s causes of action.Â  In \r\n    his original order, the master partially based granting the Countyâ€™s motions \r\n    on mootness.Â  After receiving SPDâ€™s motion for reconsideration, the master \r\n    issued an amended order deleting mootness as a ground supporting his decision \r\n    to grant the Countyâ€™s motions but still found the grant of summary judgment \r\n    proper.Â  SPD appeals.Â  \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of \r\n    material fact and the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter \r\n    of law.Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 462, 560 S.E.2d \r\n    606, 610 (2002).Â  When determining whether triable issues of fact exist, all \r\n    evidence and reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence are viewed in the \r\n    light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 \r\n    S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  An appellate court uses the same standard \r\n    applied by the trial court when reviewing the grant of summary judgment.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 451 n.5, 548 S.E.2d 868, 873-74 n.5 \r\n    (2001).Â  If the facts and the inferences indicate triable issues exist, those \r\n    issues must be presented to the jury.Â  Worsley Cos. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, \r\n    339 S.C. 51, 55, 528 S.E.2d 657, 660 (2000). \r\n\r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.Â  Return of Redemption Money\r\n  SPD argues the master erred when he granted the County summary judgment \r\n    on its cause of action seeking return of the money it spent to redeem 2 Amherst \r\n    Street because the tax sale was void and it was entitled to a return of the \r\n    money.Â  We agree that summary judgment on this claim was improper.\r\n\r\nThe masterâ€™s order found for the purposes of the \r\n  summary judgment motions that the tax sale was void \"because the delinquent \r\n  tax collector did not exercise due diligence in attempting to obtain a better \r\n  address for SPD after it received the April 1, 1999 execution notice back from \r\n  the Postal Service with notice that the address was no longer valid.â€Â  Because \r\n  the County has not appealed this ruling, it is the law of the case.Â  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, \r\n  241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (holding an unappealed ruling is the law of \r\n  the case and cannot later be challenged).Â  \r\nSPDâ€™s claim for a return of the money \r\n  it used to redeem property sold at a void tax sale presents a novel legal issue.Â  \r\n  Our courts have never addressed what entity is responsible when a taxpayer redeems \r\n  property that was sold at a tax sale that is later deemed void.Â  Although summary \r\n  judgment is not inappropriate merely because of the novelty of the legal issue \r\n  involved, it is improper where, as here, \"further inquiry into the facts is \r\n  desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  ML-Lee Acquisition Fund \r\n  L.P.&nbsp;v. Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche, 320 S.C. 143, 153, 463 S.E.2d 618, \r\n  624 (Ct. App. 1995), revâ€™d in part on other grounds, 327 S.C. 238, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d 476 (1997).Â  Thus we reverse the grant of summary judgment on this claim \r\n  and remand so that the facts and legal theories may be fully developed.Â  \r\nII.Â  Return of Interest on Money Borrowed \r\n  to Redeem\r\n\r\n  SPD argues the master erred in granting the County summary judgment \r\n    on its cause of action for interest it paid on money borrowed to redeem the \r\n    property from the County.Â  We disagree.\r\n  This court addressed a similar situation in H &amp; K Specialists \r\n    v. Brannen, 340 S.C. 585, 532 S.E.2d 617 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In H &amp; \r\n    K, the master found a tax sale void after the statutory redemption period \r\n    expired because the county failed to provide sufficient notice of the tax \r\n    sale to the taxpayer.Â  The county sent the taxpayers a new deed but did not \r\n    refund the purchase price plus statutory interest to H &amp; K, the successful \r\n    tax sale bidder.Â  Instead, the county mistakenly sent the money to the taxpayer.Â  \r\n    H &amp; K sued the county seeking return of the purchase price and statutory \r\n    interest.Â  Id. at 586, 87, 532 S.E.2d at 618-19.Â  The county asserted \r\n    section 15-78-60(11) as a defense.Â  Section 15-78-60(11) provides:Â  a \"governmental \r\n    entity is not liable for a loss resulting from:Â  (11) assessment or collection \r\n    of taxes or special assessments or enforcement of tax laws.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 15-78-60(11) (Supp. 2003).Â  This court rejected the countyâ€™s argument stating: \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    In order for [the county] to be immune under Section \r\n      15-78-60(11), H &amp; Kâ€™s loss would have to be the result of the countyâ€™s \r\n      \"assessment or collection of taxes or . . . enforcement of tax laws.â€Â  In \r\n      this case, H&nbsp;&amp; Kâ€™s loss is a direct result of the [countyâ€™s] failure \r\n      to refund H &amp; K the purchase price when a tax sale was set aside, a ministerial \r\n      act separate and distinct from assessing, collecting, or enforcing tax laws \r\n      against a taxpayer.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  H &amp; K Specialists, 340 S.C. at 587, 532 S.E.2d \r\n    at 619.\r\n  However, H &amp; K states the purpose of section \r\n    15-78-60(11) is to shield the County from liability when taxpayers lose property \r\n    as a result of a faulty tax sale.Â  Id.Â  SPDâ€™s action against the County \r\n    for interest fees incurred by borrowing the money to redeem the property is \r\n    the type of damages precluded by section 15-78-60(11).Â  Here, the County was \r\n    enforcing the tax laws against SPD.Â  The money SPD paid in interest on funds \r\n    borrowed to redeem the property were losses incurred pursuant to a faulty \r\n    tax sale and the legislature has precluded recovery by SPD for these damages.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-040","title":"Spinner v.

Gay, of Rock Hill, for Appellants. \r\nLucy London McDow, of Rock Hill, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Robert and Shirley Spinner \r\n  appeal the trial courtâ€™s decision ruling they failed to prove the barking of \r\n  the dogs of William and Celeste Adams constituted a nuisance.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\n  The Spinners \r\n  brought this action against the Adamses alleging the barking of the Adamses \r\n  four dogs constituted a nuisance.Â  They sought damages and an injunction.Â \r\n  At trial, Robert Spinner testified the dogs began \r\n    barking immediately after the Adamses moved into their home. Â He explained \r\n    he repeatedly asked his neighbors to quiet the dogs and although he initially \r\n    received reassurances, he was later told he would have to live with the situation.Â  \r\n    Spinner claimed his work as a truck driver was affected because the barking \r\n    interfered with his sleep.Â  Shirley Spinner testified she was once so upset \r\n    about the barking and about her husband working without sleep that she thought \r\n    she was having a heart attack.Â  Tests later revealed she did not suffer any \r\n    cardiac event.Â  The Spinners called animal control, made numerous complaints \r\n    to the York County Sheriffâ€™s Office, swore out warrants against the Adamses, \r\n    and sued the Adamses on more than one occasion.Â  One deputy who responded \r\n    to some of the Spinnersâ€™ calls testified the Adamses dogs were barking at \r\n    all times when she was there and that she spoke with the Adamses, advising \r\n    them of the county noise ordinance and asking them to quiet their dogs.Â  \r\n  Celeste Adams testified she tried to keep her dogs \r\n    from bothering the neighbors.Â  She testified she tried keeping them indoors \r\n    at night, putting special collars on them, and directing a sprinkler at their \r\n    doghouse so they would stay inside.Â  She testified the barking continued at \r\n    times and that in a final effort to end the strife, approximately one year \r\n    before the hearing, she had the dogsâ€™ vocal cords surgically notched so they \r\n    could no longer bark.Â  \r\n  The Adamses also presented evidence the Spinners \r\n    were unduly sensitive.Â  A county attorney testified all parties attending \r\n    a mediation hearing were willing to work out a solution except for Robert \r\n    Spinner.Â  Other neighbors testified the dogs were not a problem and some alleged \r\n    the Spinners had harassed them regarding even occasional mild barking by their \r\n    own dogs. Â One neighbor stated that when Robert Spinner called to complain \r\n    about her dog barking she noticed he had his windows open.Â  Spinner himself \r\n    testified he did not think he should have to close his windows in order to \r\n    lessen his disturbance by his neighborsâ€™ dogs.Â  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  The Spinners argue the trial court erred in refusing \r\n    to consider a tape of the Adamsesâ€™ dogs barking.Â  They also argue the court \r\n    erred in failing to apply county provisions that require pet owners to prevent \r\n    their pets from becoming a public nuisance.Â  Neither issue is preserved.\r\n  Although Robert Spinner testified he brought tape \r\n    recordings of the Adamsesâ€™ dogs to court with him, the record does not reflect \r\n    an attempt to mark or submit the tapes as evidence or to proffer their contents \r\n    to the court.Â  Thus, it does not appear the court was asked to consider the \r\n    tapes.Â  The court was also not asked to consider or apply any particular county \r\n    ordinance.Â  The Spinners did not mention any specific ordinance in their pleadings, \r\n    in their hearing before the trial court, or in their brief to this court.Â  \r\n    To be preserved for appellate review, an issue must be raised to and ruled \r\n    upon by the trial court.Â  Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 399, 570 \r\n    S.E.2d 176, 180 (2002).Â  Furthermore, short conclusory statements without \r\n    supporting legal authority, such as the Spinnersâ€™ two-paragraph argument regarding \r\n    the York County Code, are deemed abandoned on appeal.Â  Glasscock, Inc. \r\n    v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, \r\n    691 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n  The Spinners also argue the court erred in finding \r\n    they failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove the existence of a nuisance.Â  \r\n    We disagree.Â  To establish a nuisance, a landowner traditionally must demonstrate \r\n    the defendant unreasonably interfered with the ownership or use of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n    land.Â  FOC Lawshe Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Intâ€™l Paper Co., 352 S.C. 408, 413-14, \r\n    574 S.E.2d 228, 231 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Determining whether one landownerâ€™s \r\n    use of his property is a legal infringement on the property rights of another \r\n    requires delicate balancing of the parties conflicting interests and rights.Â  \r\n    Winget v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 242 S.C. 152, 159, 130 S.E.2d 363, \r\n    367 (1963).Â  Although landowners must not unreasonably interfere with the \r\n    rights of their neighbors to enjoy their property, not every annoyance or \r\n    disturbance created by the landownerâ€™s use of his property constitutes a nuisance.Â  \r\n    Oâ€™Cain v. Oâ€™Cain, 322 S.C. 551, 560-61, 473 S.E.2d 460, 466 (Ct. App. \r\n    1996).Â  The inquiry is not whether the plaintiffs have been annoyed or disturbed \r\n    but whether their legal rights have been injured.Â  \r\n  Here, we agree with the trial court that the Spinners \r\n    have failed to establish their claim that the Adamsesâ€™ dogs constituted a \r\n    private nuisance.Â  Although the Spinners testified they were bothered and \r\n    disturbed by the dogsâ€™ barking, they failed to prove the barking rose to a \r\n    level where their rights were injured.Â  There was evidence showing the Adamses \r\n    made several attempts to lessen the disturbance to the Spinners, including \r\n    having the dogs surgically â€œdebarked.â€ There was also evidence the Spinners \r\n    were unusually sensitive and unwilling to mitigate the annoyance they suffered.Â  \r\n    Other homeowners in the neighborhood testified they had no problems with the \r\n    Adamsesâ€™ dogs.Â  \r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n   HUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-041","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia;Â  and Solicitor \r\n  William Townes Jones, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant, Craig L. Atchison, \r\n  was convicted of burglary in the second degree and petit larceny.Â  The trial \r\n  judge sentenced Atchison to consecutive terms of fifteen years on the burglary \r\n  charge and three years on the larceny charge.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAtchison was tried before a jury on January 17, \r\n  2002, for burglary and larceny involving the home and personal goods of Jodi \r\n  Sutton.Â  Following jury selection, Atchison objected and made a Batson \r\n  motion requesting the solicitor give race-neutral explanations for the striking \r\n  of three black males, jurors 23, 52 and 22.Â  The solicitor responded that he \r\n  struck juror number 23 \"because he does have a magistrateâ€™s court conviction \r\n  of public intoxication, DUI.â€ And that he struck juror number 52 \"because he \r\n  had a magistrateâ€™s court conviction for multiple counts of fraudulent checks \r\n  and also a DUI.â€Â  As to juror number 22, the following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\n[Solicitor]:Â  And number 22 was Edward Chalmers.Â  I donâ€™t \r\n  have any indication Mr. Chalmers has a record.Â  But in my discussions with Lieutenant \r\n  Boland, Lieutenant Boland tells me that he has been on several calls regarding \r\n  Mr., Mr. Chalmersâ€™ niece and on those calls Mr. Chalmers was there and Mr. Boland \r\n  dealt with him.Â  He essentially, for lack of a better term, he hangs with the \r\n  wrong crowd and heâ€™s not the type of individual the State would prefer to have \r\n  on this jury to hear this case.\r\n[The Court]:Â  All right.Â  Mr. Jenkins, you want to be heard \r\n  on any or all of those?\r\n[Defense Counsel]:Â  Yes, sir, your Honor.Â  On number 22.\r\n[The Court]:Â  23?Â  22, Chalmers.\r\n[Defense Counsel]:Â  The last one, Mr. Chalmers.Â  The Solicitor \r\n  indicated that the defendant hangs with the wrong crowd and indicated that the \r\n  officer had some type of interaction with him.Â  He did not allege any improper \r\n  conduct or anything that would lead the court to believe that it was a racially \r\n  neutral reason.Â  The hanging with the wrong crowd is simply saying that heâ€™s \r\n  been where officers have been before.Â  They didnâ€™t offer any information as \r\n  to his actions or interactions.Â  I would submit that the reason for striking \r\n  him is not racially neutral.\r\n[The Court]:Â  All right.Â  Mr. Peace, you want to be heard?\r\n[Solicitor]:Â  Well, your Honor, I donâ€™t have to give any other \r\n  facts, I mean, on its face is the fact that the police have dealt with him and \r\n  they inform me based on those dealings that heâ€™s not the type of individual \r\n  that we want sitting on the jury.Â  I donâ€™t care if heâ€™s black or white.Â  If \r\n  they dealt with him and the dealings havenâ€™t been satisfactory, I think thatâ€™s \r\n  a sufficient reason for us to exercise a challenge.Â  And I think thatâ€™s a racial \r\n  neutral reason.\r\n[The Court]:Â  All right, Mr. Jenkins, anything further?\r\n[Defense Counsel]:Â  No, sir, your Honor.\r\n[The Court]:Â  All right.Â  I find that the State has given \r\n  sufficient racially neutral reasons for having exercised the strikes on juror \r\n  number 23, 52, and 22.Â  And the jury as selected will stand.\r\n\r\nFollowing submission of the case to the jury, Atchison \r\n  was convicted of second-degree burglary and petit larceny.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Atchison contends the trial judge erred \r\n  in refusing to quash the jury, as it was seated in violation of Batson v. \r\n  Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).Â  He asserts the explanation given by the solicitor \r\n  was not racially neutral, but it was akin to saying the venireman \"shucked and \r\n  jived,â€ an explanation which has been found to demonstrate an impermissible \r\n  subjective intent to discriminate.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 515 S.E.2d \r\n  88 (1999), our Supreme Court set forth the following relevant law where a Batson \r\n  motion is concerned:\r\n\r\nA Batson hearing is conducted in the following \r\n  manner.Â  First, the trial judge must hold a Batson hearing when members \r\n  of a cognizable racial group or gender are struck and the opposing party requests \r\n  a hearing.Â  Second, the proponent of the strike must present a race- or gender-neutral \r\n  explanation.Â  At this second step, the proponent of the strike no longer is \r\n  required to offer a reason that is race or gender-neutral and clear, \r\n  reasonably specific, and legitimate.Â  The reason must only be race- or gender-neutral.Â  \r\n  Third, the opponent of the strike must show that the race- or gender-neutral \r\n  explanation given was mere pretext.Â  The burden of persuading the court that \r\n  a Batson violation has occurred remains at all times on the opponent \r\n  of the strike.\r\n*Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  *Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  *\r\nWhether a partyâ€™s proffered reason for exercising \r\n  a peremptory strike is discriminatory must be determined by examining the totality \r\n  of the facts and circumstances in the record.\r\n\r\nId. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 90-91 (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nUnless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the \r\n  proponentâ€™s explanation at the second step, the reason offered will be deemed \r\n  race-neutral.Â  State v. Tucker, 334 S.C. 1, 8, 512 S.E.2d 99, 102 (1999).Â  \r\n  Further, a trial judgeâ€™s determination regarding purposeful discrimination rests \r\n  largely on his evaluation of demeanor and credibility, and because the demeanor \r\n  of the challenged attorney is often the best and only evidence of possible discrimination, \r\n  the evaluation lies peculiarly within the trial judgeâ€™s province.Â  State \r\n  v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 615-16, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810 (2001).Â  Thus, the \r\n  appellate court must give the trial judgeâ€™s findings great deference, and review \r\n  the judgeâ€™s ruling under a clearly erroneous standard.Â  Id. at 615, 545 \r\n  S.E.2d at 810.\r\nThe Solicitor explained he struck Mr. Chalmers because \r\n  (1) he \"hangs with the wrong crowd and heâ€™s not the type of individual the State \r\n  would prefer to have on this juryâ€ and (2) the investigating officer on the \r\n  case had dealt with him and those dealings had been unsatisfactory.Â  We discern \r\n  no discriminatory intent inherent in the Solicitorâ€™s explanation.Â  See \r\n  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. at 630, 515 S.E.2d at 91 (prosecutorâ€™s primary \r\n  reason for striking potential juror, because lead detective in case knew her \r\n  to be a high-strung, critical person who would be a polarizing force on the \r\n  jury, was a race-neutral reason for the strike); State v. Smith, 321 \r\n  S.C. 471, 474, 469 S.E.2d 57, 59 (Ct. App. 1996) (trooperâ€™s personal contact \r\n  with the venirepersons or family members on previous occasions and his obvious \r\n  belief they may be biased against law enforcement or otherwise partial to defendant \r\n  were legitimate and racially neutral, and were related to his views concerning \r\n  the outcome of the case to be tried); State v. Richburg, 304 S.C. 162, \r\n  163-64, 403 S.E.2d 315, 317 (1991) (officerâ€™s apparent knowledge that venireperson \r\n  had anti-law enforcement bias found to be legitimate race-neutral reason for \r\n  strike); State v. Johnson, 302 S.C. 243, 246, 395 S.E.2d 167, 168-69 \r\n  (1990) (following explanations were found to be racially neutral and sufficient \r\n  to withstand Batson inquiry:Â  (1) jurorâ€™s neighbor had been arrested by one \r\n  of the officers involved in the case; (2) juror lived near and frequented an \r\n  establishment which has had great conflict with the law enforcement of the county; \r\n  (3) juror lived next door to and had a close relationship with a man who had \r\n  recently been convicted of a drug offense).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Atchisonâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, \r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-046","title":"Graham v.

Graustein, of Conway, for Appellant.\r\nCharles Edward Parrish, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Joyce Carlene Graham (Wife) appeals from the family courtâ€™s \r\n  order of separate support and maintenance, in which the court determined child \r\n  custody and support, equitable division of the marital estate, and attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe Wife and Albert Gerald Graham (Husband) \r\n  were married February 16, 1996.Â  They have one child together, who was born \r\n  May 20, 1995.Â  On September 6, 2001, the Husband was arrested for criminal domestic \r\n  violence.Â  At this time, the Wife moved with the child to Haines City, Florida.Â  \r\n  She filed a petition for an injunction for protection against domestic violence \r\n  in Polk County, Florida on September 19, 2001.Â  The Florida court issued a temporary \r\n  order that same day granting the wife temporary custody of the child.\r\nThe Husband brought this action September \r\n  28, 2001 in the Horry County, South Carolina family court seeking a divorce \r\n  on the ground of habitual drunkenness.Â  In the alternative, he requested an \r\n  order of separate support and maintenance.Â  He also requested custody of and \r\n  support for the child, equitable distribution of the marital estate, including \r\n  possession of specific items, and attorneysâ€™ fees and costs.\r\nAfter conferring with the Florida court, \r\n  the South Carolina family court determined it had jurisdiction of this matter \r\n  in regards to custody, visitation, child support, and possession of any marital \r\n  assets, as well as other related matters.Â  Accordingly, an evidentiary hearing \r\n  scheduled for December 12, 2001 in Florida was cancelled.Â  The South Carolina \r\n  family court held a temporary hearing November 27, 2001.Â  The Wife was not present.Â  \r\n  The court granted the Husband temporary custody of the child with the wife receiving \r\n  visitation.Â  \r\nThe Wife subsequently filed an answer \r\n  to the Husbandâ€™s complaint requesting custody of and support for the child, \r\n  equitable distribution, alimony, and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  She also requested \r\n  the court grant her a divorce on the grounds of physical abuse. \r\nA final hearing was scheduled for May \r\n  20, 2002.Â  Prior to the hearing, the partiesâ€™ attorneys informed the court that \r\n  a settlement had been reached.Â  However, upon questioning of the Wife, the court \r\n  determined that she was not entering into the agreement freely and voluntarily.Â  \r\n  The court adjourned the hearing and a new trial date was set for August 12-13, \r\n  2002.Â  During the May 20 hearing, the wife asked that her attorney be relieved \r\n  as counsel.Â  The court granted the request, but warned her that the securing \r\n  of additional counsel would not be grounds for a continuance nor would the hearing \r\n  be continued at the new counselâ€™s request.Â  In its order, the court reiterated \r\n  that the wife would not receive a continuance to find counsel or for her new \r\n  counsel to prepare.\r\nIn this order, the court retroactively \r\n  appointed the guardian ad litem who had already been working on the case.Â  It \r\n  ordered the Husband to pay $600.00 of the guardianâ€™s fees and the Wife to pay \r\n  $1200.00 of the fees within 30 days of the hearing.Â  It also ordered the Wife \r\n  to pay $2,337.00 of the Husbandâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees incurred in preparation of \r\n  the postponed hearing.Â  \r\nAt the hearing held August 12, 2002, the Wife informed \r\n  the family court that she had been unable to obtain counsel and requested that \r\n  she be allowed to find representation.Â  The Husband opposed the request for \r\n  a continuance and the guardian ad litem took no position on the issue.Â  The \r\n  family court denied the request and proceeded with the hearing.Â  \r\nIn its final order, the family court held the Husband \r\n  had failed to carry his burden of proof in regards to a divorce on the grounds \r\n  of habitual drunkenness.Â  Therefore, it granted the parties an order of separate \r\n  support and maintenance.Â  It awarded the Husband custody of the child with the \r\n  Wife receiving visitation.Â  It ordered the Wife to pay child support through \r\n  the court.Â  It set the partiesâ€™ responsibilities for the childâ€™s medical care \r\n  costs.Â  The court divided the marital estate and provided for set-offs from \r\n  the estate of funds the Wife owed the Husband.Â  The court authorized either \r\n  party to request a drug test from the other, with the requesting party being \r\n  responsible for the cost of the test unless the results were positive.Â  The \r\n  court ordered the Husband to pay $2,300.00 of the guardianâ€™s fees and the wife \r\n  pay $800.00 of the fees within 30 days of the trial.Â  Finally the court ordered \r\n  that the parties are \"restrained from contacting, harassing, threatening, or \r\n  molesting one another.â€Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this \r\n  court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of \r\n  the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d \r\n  157, 160 (1992).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to \r\n  disregard the family courtâ€™s findings or relieve the appellant of the burden \r\n  of convincing us the lower court committed error.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Nor do we ignore the fact that \r\n  the trial court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  \r\n  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuance\r\n\r\nThe wife argues the family court erred in denying \r\n  her request for a continuance to allow her to find representation.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nA decision whether to grant or deny a motion for \r\n  continuance rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Jackson \r\n  v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 309, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997).Â  We will not reverse \r\n  the trial court without a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.\r\nThe final hearing in this matter would have been \r\n  held May 20, 2002 except the Wife balked at entering into the settlement agreement \r\n  and asked that her attorney be relieved as counsel.Â  Although the family court \r\n  granted this request, it warned the Wife that the securing of additional counsel \r\n  would not be grounds for a continuance nor would the hearing be continued at \r\n  the new counselâ€™s request.Â  In its order, the court reiterated, \"[I]n the event \r\n  the [Wife] retains an attorney for the August 12th and 13th \r\n  hearing, she must do so in a timely fashion, and the hiring of a new attorney \r\n  will not be grounds for the [Wife] to seek another continuance.â€Â  The Wife had \r\n  almost three months to secure new counsel, but failed to do so.Â  She stated \r\n  she had spoken to seven different attorneys, five of whom had conflicts and \r\n  the other two were on vacation at the time of the hearing.Â  We find the Wife \r\n  was aware that she would not receive additional time to either search for new \r\n  counsel or for new counsel to prepare for the hearing.Â  Considering the adequate \r\n  time the Wife had to obtain new counsel, we find the family court did not abuse \r\n  its discretion in denying the Wifeâ€™s request for a continuance.Â  \r\nThe Wife also argues the family court erroneously \r\n  held that it was bound by the prior order and did not exercise its own discretion.Â  \r\n  As the wife failed to raise this argument to the family court, it is not preserved.Â  \r\n  Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 489 S.E.2d 212 (Ct. App. 1997) (issue \r\n  must be raised to and ruled on by family court to be preserved for review).\r\n\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due process\r\n\r\nThe Wife argues the family court denied her federal \r\n  right to procedural due process because she did not receive adequate notice \r\n  that she would be required to proceed pro se at the August 12, 2002 hearing.Â Â Â  \r\n  The issue was not raised to the family court.Â  Therefore, it is not preserved.Â  \r\n  In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001) (stating constitutional \r\n  claim must be raised and ruled upon to be preserved for appellate review). \r\n\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jurisdiction\r\n\r\nThe Wife argues the family court granted the parties \r\n  a limited divorce, which it lacks jurisdiction to do.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe family court has exclusive jurisdiction to \r\n  hear and determine actions: \r\n\r\nFor divorce a vinculo matrimonii, separate support and maintenance, \r\n  legal separation, and in other marital litigation between the parties, and for \r\n  settlement of all legal and equitable rights of the parties in the actions in \r\n  and to the real and personal property of the marriage and attorneyâ€™s fees, if \r\n  requested by either party in the pleadings.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(2) (Supp.2003).\r\nIn support of her argument that the family \r\n  court acted outside of its jurisdiction, the Wife calls this courtâ€™s attention \r\n  to where in the hearing the family court noted, \"It is obvious that the parties \r\n  can not live together.â€Â  However, the court did not grant the parties a limited \r\n  divorce.Â  As it clearly stated in its order, it granted them an order of separate \r\n  support maintenance, which is certainly within its jurisdiction to do.Â  \r\n\r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to advise wife.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Wife argues the family court erred in failing \r\n  to advise her of the consequences of not testifying at the hearing.Â  The Wife \r\n  never raised this argument to the family court.Â  Accordingly, it is not preserved.Â  \r\n  Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 489 S.E.2d 212 (Ct. App. 1997) (issue \r\n  must be raised to and ruled on by family court to be preserved for review).\r\nFurthermore, a pro se litigant has full \r\n  responsibility for complying with substantive and procedural requirements of \r\n  the law.Â  State v.

Bailey, Jr., of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Moorer appeals from his conviction on a first degree burglary \r\n  charge, arguing that the house he broke into was not a \"dwellingâ€ within S.C.Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-11-10 (2003). We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant Daniel Moorer broke into a house located \r\n  in St. George onÂ  March 27, 2001. At the time, the house was empty. The owner \r\n  of the house had died, but the decedentâ€™s daughters had used the house \"three \r\n  times, four time[s] out of the year two or three weeks at a time.â€ In 2002, \r\n  a jury convicted Moorer of first degree burglary. The trial judge then sentenced \r\n  Moorer to fifteen years in prison.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nISSUESÂ Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the court err in denying Moorerâ€™s \r\n  motion for directed verdict, ruling that the house was a dwelling as required for first \r\n  degree burglary? \r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the court err in limiting \r\n  Moorerâ€™s closing concerning whether the house was a dwelling?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS:Â  \r\n\"On a motion for a directed verdict in a criminal \r\n  case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, \r\n  not its weight.â€ State v. Robinson, 344 S.C. 220, 223, 543 S.E.2d 249, \r\n  250 (App. Ct. 2001). And the appellate court must interpret the evidence in \r\n  the light most favorable to the state. State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, \r\n  46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999). \r\nA dwelling is \"any house â€¦ [or] building â€¦ in which \r\n  there sleeps a proprietor, tenant, watchman, clerk, laborer or person who lodges \r\n  there with a view to the protection of property. . . .â€ S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-10 \r\n  (2003). A house can be a dwelling even if it is empty, so long as the dweller \r\n  has the intention of returning there. State v. Ferebee, 273 S.C. 403, \r\n  405, 257 S.E.2d 154, 155 (1979). Therefore, a \"[t]emporary absence from a â€˜dwellingâ€™ \r\n  is irrelevant to the charge of first degree burglary.â€ State v. White, \r\n  349 S.C. 33, 36, 562 S.E.2d 305, 306 (2002).\r\nAt trial, there was evidence that the decedentâ€™s \r\n  daughters came to the house three or four times year and had maintained its \r\n  water, electricity, and telephone services. They had last visited the house \r\n  about four months before the break-in. The house had not been abandoned. Taking \r\n  the evidence in the most favorable light for the state, we cannot say that the \r\n  trial judge erred when she ruled that the house was a dwelling. \r\nMoorer also argues that he should have been allowed \r\n  to raise the dwelling issue in his closing argument. During his closing, Moorerâ€™s \r\n  counsel said: \"Mr. Moorer lived on Washington Heights. Heâ€™s familiar with this \r\n  property, lived there all his life, 57 years old. He knew nobody was living \r\n  there.â€ The state objected on the ground of \"facts not in evidence.â€ A conference \r\n  ensued among the judge, the prosecutor, and the defense counsel, but the conference \r\n  was off the record. When the defense counsel continued his closing argument, \r\n  he did not object on the record to the judgeâ€™s apparent decision to sustain \r\n  the stateâ€™s objection. Therefore, the issue was not preserved for appeal. See \r\n  York v. Conway Ford, Inc., 325 S.C. 170, 173, 480 S.E.2d 726, 728 (1997) \r\n  (\"An objection made during an off-the-record conference which is not made part \r\n  of the record does not preserve the question for review.â€). \r\nAffirmed.\r\nHuff, Stilwell, and Beatty, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2003-UP-694","title":"State v.

Cisa, of Mt.

We \r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAnn and Dennis Fried were divorced in 2002. The \r\n  parties reached, and the family judge accepted, a settlement concerning the \r\n  division of the marital estate. In the divorce order dated March 13, 2002, Husband \r\n  was ordered to give to Wife â€œby QDRO, to be prepared within thirty (30) days \r\n  from the date of [the] order, an amount equal to One Hundred Thirty Thousand \r\n  ($130,000.00) Dollars, payable from all of the funds contained in a SEP-IRA \r\n  held by Morgan-Stanley Dean Witter and the balance from annuities held in a \r\n  â€˜Putnam Fundâ€™ at USB Paine Webber, both presently titled in [Husbandâ€™s] name.â€ \r\n\r\nBy a first QDRO, the sum of $95,000.00 from the \r\n  Morgan Stanley account was assigned to Wife on April 7, 2002. A second QDRO \r\n  assigned $35,000.00 to Wife from the Putnam account. The Morgan Stanley account \r\n  subsequently decreased to $77,816.00 due to market fluctuations. Husband was \r\n  willing to transfer those funds to Wife, but refused to add the lost $17,184.00 \r\n  from the Putnam account to makeup the difference. Both parties moved for a Rule \r\n  to Show Cause. The judge found that the divorce decree clearly mandated that \r\n  Husband pay Wife $130,000.00, market fluctuations notwithstanding. The judge \r\n  ordered Husband to pay $52,184,00 from the Putnam account. The judge also held \r\n  Husband in contempt of court and granted attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the family court err in finding \r\n  that Husband should bear the risk of devaluating securities transferred to Wife pursuant \r\n  to the divorce decree?\r\n(2) Did the family court err in awarding \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife?\r\n\r\nANALYSISÂ Â  \r\nThis Court can determine facts in accordance with \r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the evidence when reviewing matters from \r\n  the family court. Wooten v. Wooten, 354 S.C. 242, 248, 580 S.E.2d 765, \r\n  768 (Ct. App. 2003). Husband argues that Wife should bear the burden of the \r\n  market fluctuations because she acquired equitable title to the accounts upon \r\n  the filing of the divorce decree. For that argument, Husband cites Calhoun \r\n  v. Calhoun, 331 S.C. 157, 501 S.E.2d 735 (Ct. App. 1998). However, Calhoun \r\n  is easily distinguishable from the present case. There, the wife had been awarded \r\n  the actual lots at issue, But here, the divorce decree did not assign \r\n  the two accounts to Wife. Instead, the divorce decree ordered that Wife be paid \r\n  the sum certain of $130,000.00 from â€œall the fundsâ€ in the two accounts. The \r\n  two subsequent QDROâ€™s were used simply â€œ[i]n furtherance of the agreement to \r\n  the transfer [of] the $130,000.00,â€ only â€œto effectuate the agreement of the \r\n  parties as contained in the Divorce Decree.â€ That more money had to come from \r\n  the Putnam account and less from the Stanley Morgan account is of no import.\r\nHusband also appeals the family courtâ€™s decision \r\n  to award attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife. â€œAn award of attorney's fees will not be overturned \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.â€ Wooten, 354 S.C. at 254, 580 S.E.2d at \r\n  771. â€œIn deciding whether to award attorney's fees, the family court \r\n  should consider the parties' ability to pay their own fee, the beneficial results \r\n  obtained by counsel, the respective financial conditions of the parties, and \r\n  the effect of the fee on each party's standard of living.â€ Id. Here, \r\n  the family court found that Wife had not received â€œany significant assets incident \r\n  to the partiesâ€™ divorceâ€ and was unemployed at the time of the hearing. Based \r\n  on these and other facts, the court awarded her attorneyâ€™s fees. We cannot say \r\n  that the family court abused its discretion.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-050","title":"Lindsey v.

Shealy III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nNorman Douglas Brannon, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lindseys sued Spartan Roofing, alleging breach of contract. \r\n  The jury found for the Lindseys; Spartan Roofing appeals. We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nHomeowners James and Polly Lindsey sued Spartan \r\n  Roofing for negligence and breach of contract after Spartan failed to repair \r\n  the Lindseysâ€™ home to the Lindseysâ€™ satisfaction. The Lindseys alleged that \r\n  the roof of their home was still leaking, even after Polly Lindsey pointed out \r\n  the problem to Spartan. The Lindseys then consulted Mr. Burgess of Cannon Roofing. \r\n  Mr. Burgess determined that the roof was leaking in two places. Polly Lindsey \r\n  asked Mr. Burgess if he \"could repair the leaks and provide a warrantyâ€ on it. \r\n  Mr. Burgess replied that he could warrant only a whole new roof, not one he \r\n  repaired in part. However, when asked whether the whole roof had to be replaced \r\n  because of the two leaks, Mr. BurgessÂ  declined to offer an opinion. At trial, \r\n  the Lindseys attempted to introduce into evidence Mr. Burgessâ€™s estimate to \r\n  replace the whole roof and to warrant it for two years. Spartan objected. \r\nSpartan argued that the Lindseys were attempting \r\n  to arrive at a better position than where they were before; that the Lindseys \r\n  would in essence have a brand new roof with a two-year warranty, not just a \r\n  repaired roof. Spartan insisted that the measure of damages was the cost of \r\n  fixing the two leaks, not of replacing the whole roof. The Lindseys countered \r\n  that they had \"contracted to replace the entire roofâ€ originally with Spartan, \r\n  and were therefore entitled to the replacement and the warranty. \r\nThe trial judge first indicated that he might sustain \r\n  the objection. However, Mr. Albert, the owner of Spartan, subsequently testified \r\n  that the Lindseys had indeed contracted with Spartan to \"install a new roofing \r\n  system.â€ Mr. Albert also testified that that work carried a two-year workmanship \r\n  warranty. The trial judge then allowed into evidence Mr. Burgessâ€™s estimate \r\n  for the replacement and warranty of the whole roof. The jury found for the Lindseys \r\n  and awarded them $11,393 in \"actual damages.â€ \r\n ISSUESÂ  \r\n\r\n(1) Did the trial court err in allowing Mr. Burgessâ€™s \r\n  estimate since there was no testimony that the whole roof needed to be replaced?Â  \r\n  \r\n(2) Did the trial court err in denying Spartanâ€™s \r\n  motion for a new trial since there was no evidence to substantiate the juryâ€™s \r\n  award of damages?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\"The admission or exclusion of evidence \r\n  at trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose discretion \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of such discretion \r\n  amounting to a manifest error of law.â€ Cooks v. S.C Dept. of Hwys. and Pub. \r\n  Transp., 309 S.C. 179, 184, 420 S.E.2d 847, 849 (1992) (citing Grand \r\n  Strand Constr. Co. v. Graves, 269 S.C. 594, 595, 239 S.E.2d 81, 81 (1977)). \r\n  \"The grant or denial of new trial motions rests within the discretion of the \r\n  trial judge and his decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings \r\n  are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled \r\n  by error of law.â€ Vinson v. Harley, 324 S.C. 389, 405, 477 S.E.2d 715, \r\n  723 (Ct. App. 1996) (citing Umhoefer v. Bollinger, 298 S.C. 221, 224, \r\n  379 S.E.2d 296, 297 (Ct. App. 1989)). \"In deciding whether to assess error to \r\n  a court's denial of a motion for a new trial, [appellate courts] consider the \r\n  testimony and reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most \r\n  favorable to the nonmoving party.â€ Id.  \r\nSpartan Roofing argues that the trial judge erred \r\n  when he allowed Mr. Burgess to introduce into evidence the estimate to replace \r\n  the whole roof. We disagree. At trial, Mr. Albert himself admitted that Spartan \r\n  had been hired to \"install a new roofing systemâ€ and that Spartan \"was paid \r\n  $14,218 for a new roof.â€ Mr. Albert also testified that a new roof carried a \r\n  two-year warranty. That testimony is bolstered by the Lindseysâ€™ contention that \r\n  they contracted with Spartan to replace the roof completely. (R.179). There \r\n  is ample evidence to suggest that the Lindseys contracted for a new, warranted \r\n  roof with Spartan, and therefore were entitled to obtain the same. See \r\n  Minter v. GOCT, Inc., 322 S.C. 525, 528, 473 S.E.2d 67, 70 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996) (\"The purpose of an award of damages for breach of contract is to put \r\n  the plaintiff in as good a position as he would have been in if the contract \r\n  had been performed.â€).Â Â  \r\nSince the evidence supports the juryâ€™s award, we \r\n  need not address Spartanâ€™s other issues.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-051","title":"Frantzis v.

Frantzis, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nKristen B. Frantzis, of Goose Creek, for Respondent.\r\nD. Allen Badger, of Charleston, for Guardian Ad Litem\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â David Frantzis appeals the family courtâ€™s decision to \r\n  not modify the custody order concerning the Frantzis child. We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nKristen (â€œthe motherâ€) and David (â€œthe fatherâ€) Frantzis \r\n  divorced in August of 2000. In the divorce order, the family court (â€œthe courtâ€) \r\n  granted sole custody of the Frantzis child to the mother. The court granted \r\n  visitation rights to the father and ordered him to pay child support. The court \r\n  also ordered the father to â€œstay awayâ€ from the mother and to not harass her. \r\n\r\nIn May of 2001, the father petitioned the court \r\n  to modify the custody arrangement. The father alleged that the mother had used \r\n  illegal drugs in front of the child and had exposed the child to â€œmultiple malesâ€ \r\n  who were â€œnot family members.â€ The mother responded in a letter, saying that \r\n  she had never in her life used cocaine, but admitted to living with her â€œfiancÃ©.â€ \r\n  In July of 2001, the court appointed a GAL. The court also ordered the mother \r\n  to stop living with her fiancÃ©, as he was still married to another woman. In \r\n  September of 2002, the court held a hearing about the husbandâ€™s request. The \r\n  parties represented themselves at the hearing. \r\nThe judge heard testimony from the father, the \r\n  mother, the motherâ€™s fiancÃ©, and the GAL. He found that (1) the mother and her \r\n  fiancÃ© had an â€œillegal and immoralâ€ relationship; (2) their continued living \r\n  arrangement violated a previous court order. However, the judge maintained custody \r\n  with the mother, warning her that she would be held in contempt of court and \r\n  lose custody of her child if she continued living with her fiancÃ©. The husband \r\n  appeals.\r\nISSUESÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n(1) Did the family court err in not finding that \r\n  the father was the more fit custodial parent?\r\n(2) Did the family court err in not enforcing its \r\n  prior order that required the wife to not expose the child to the â€œadulterousâ€ \r\n  relationship?\r\n\r\nANALYSISÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the factual determinations of the \r\n  family court, an appellate court may take its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.â€ Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, \r\n  623 (2003) (citing Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, \r\n  157 (1996)). But â€œthe appellate court â€˜should be reluctant to substitute its \r\n  own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that of the [family] court.â€™â€ \r\n  Id. And â€œwhere there is disputed evidence, the appellate court may adhere \r\n  to the findings of the family court.â€ Id.  \r\nHere, the judge heard the testimonies of all parties. \r\n  The judge then decided that, the motherâ€™s living arrangement notwithstanding, \r\n  the situation did not warrant changing the original custody order. The GALâ€™s \r\n  report had reached the same conclusion. The father failed to provide persuasive \r\n  evidence that the father would provide a better environment for the child. There \r\n  is no reason to disturb that finding.\r\nThe father also argues that the trial court erred \r\n  in not holding the mother in contempt after finding that the mother had violated \r\n  a prior order by continuing to live with her fiancÃ©. This matter was not raised \r\n  before the family court judge and therefore we cannot review it. See \r\n  Washington v. Washington, 308 S.C. 549, 551, 419 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1992) \r\n  (â€œHusband neither raised these issues to the court at trial nor through a Rule \r\n  59(e) motion to amend the judgment [so] the issues are not properly before this \r\n  Court for review.â€);(Cash v. Cash, 320 S.C. 388, 392, 465 S.E.2d 371, \r\n  373 (Ct. 1995) (holding that when a family courtâ€™s order does not specifically \r\n  address an issue and no Rule (59)(e) motion to alter or amend the courtâ€™s order \r\n  is made, then the issue is not preserved for appellate review).Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-052","title":"Miller v.

Thayer Rivers, Jr., of Ridgeland, for Appellants. \r\n  Ronnie Fred Craig, of Charlotte, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  PER CURIAM:Â  Joe Louis \r\n    Miller, Sr., individually and as legal guardian of Joe Miller, Jr. and Sophia \r\n    Miller, both minors, appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of his motion for a \r\n    new trial absolute and challenges the sufficiency of the additur award.Â  We \r\n    affirm. [1]   \r\n  FACTS\r\n  Miller brought a personal \r\n    injury action against Sherah Stark following a minor traffic accident.Â  The \r\n    case was tried to a jury and verdicts were returned in favor of Miller and \r\n    his two children in the amounts of $316, $202 and $202, respectively.Â  Miller \r\n    moved post-trial for a new trial nisi additur or, in the alternative, for \r\n    a new trial absolute. The judge denied his motion for a new trial, but granted \r\n    an additur of $35 to Miller and both of his two children.Â  Miller appeals \r\n    the courtâ€™s denial of his motion for a new trial absolute and challenges the \r\n    sufficiency of the additur award.Â  \r\n  Stark testified she was a few \r\n    cars back from the traffic signal behind Millerâ€™s Cadillac when the light \r\n    turned green.Â  She let her foot off the brake without accelerating and looked \r\n    over her shoulder to check on a crying child when she rolled into the Cadillac.Â  \r\n    After the accident, Miller got out of the car, checked his rear bumper and \r\n    walked to a nearby service station to telephone the police. Â Stark testified \r\n    Millerâ€™s children continued to play and behave normally in the back seat of \r\n    his vehicle.Â  \r\n  EMS responded but no \r\n    one was taken to the hospital and Miller later drove his vehicle from the \r\n    scene.Â  Afterward, Miller and his children visited the emergency room.Â  Millerâ€™s \r\n    head was examined and found to be atraumatic and normal.Â  Neither of the children \r\n    was given any medication.Â  \r\n  In her answer, Stark answer admitted \r\n    that a collision occurred, but denied that Miller and his children sustained \r\n    injuries to the extent they alleged in the complaint.Â  At the trial, Stark \r\n    essentially admitted liability while continuing to question the damages as \r\n    claimed by Miller.Â  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  Miller argues the trial \r\n    court erred by failing to grant a new trial absolute based on inadequacy of \r\n    the verdict.Â  We disagree.\r\n  The amount of the verdict \r\n    is not so shockingly disproportionate to the injuries Miller or his children \r\n    sustained as to indicate â€œpassion, caprice, prejudice, or some other influence \r\n    outside the evidenceâ€ motivated the juryâ€™s decision.Â  O'Neal v. Bowles, \r\n    314 S.C. 525, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993). \r\n  Testimony revealed neither \r\n    Miller nor his children suffered any serious injury.Â  Indeed, Millerâ€™s children \r\n    continued to play undisturbed in the rear seat of his car immediately after \r\n    the accident.Â  Although EMS was called to the scene, no one was taken to the \r\n    hospital.Â  Millerâ€™s later trip to the emergency room revealed he suffered \r\n    no head injury and the children required no medication.Â  The jury awarded \r\n    damages to cover the cost of the initial emergency room visit and included \r\n    the EMS trip in Millerâ€™s verdict.Â  The jury simply concluded that Miller did \r\n    not deserve costs for later medical treatments and awarded damages accordingly.Â  \r\n    As Miller noted in his brief, â€œthe range of damages could have been from zero \r\n    to the sky.â€Â  See Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, \r\n    406 S.E.2d 350 (1991) (citing Fennell v. Littlejohn, 240 S.C. 189, \r\n    125 S.E.2d 408 (1962)) (The award of actual and punitive damages remains within \r\n    the discretion of the jury, as reviewed by the trial judge.)Â  \r\n  Miller also challenges \r\n    the sufficiency of the trial courtâ€™s additur award, arguing the trial court \r\n    abused its discretion by â€œspeculating as to the methodology of the jury verdict.â€Â  \r\n    We disagree.\r\n  A motion for a new trial nisi \r\n    additur is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Graham \r\n    v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984).Â  We find no abuse of \r\n    discretion by the trial judge in determining an additional award of $35 for \r\n    Miller and the children.Â  It is clear to us that the trial judge carefully \r\n    considered Millerâ€™s motion.Â  After all, he granted the amounts of the EMS \r\n    transport fees as part and parcel of costs directly arising out of the events \r\n    of the accident but, consistent with the juryâ€™s reasoning, declined to extend \r\n    additur to cover later medical bills.Â  \r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n   HUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-053","title":"State v.

Allen Nickles, III, and Carl L. Solomon, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this action for malicious \r\n  prosecution, false imprisonment, and bad faith termination, Leroy Canzater asserts \r\n  the trial court erred in dismissing the false imprisonment and bad faith termination \r\n  causes of action as barred by the statute of limitations and in ruling that \r\n  an arrest warrant conclusively barred an action for \r\n  malicious prosecution.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.Â \r\nFACTS\r\nThe City of Columbia (â€œthe Cityâ€) employed \r\n  Canzater in the Wastewater Maintenance Division.Â  Believing that Canzater had \r\n  for more than a year knowingly received overtime payments from the City in excess \r\n  of the hours actually worked, the City terminated his employment and sought \r\n  warrants for his arrest.Â  On December 2, 1998, a grand jury indicted Canzater \r\n  for grand larceny.Â  The court issued a warrant for his arrest.Â  Canzater was \r\n  arrested the following day.Â  On May 4, 1999, Canzater was again arrested and \r\n  indicted, this time on charges of conspiracy to commit embezzlement in connection \r\n  with the overtime payments. \r\nThe circuit court dismissed all charges against \r\n  Canzater on September 22, 2000.Â  Thereafter, on November 5, 2001, Canzater initiated \r\n  the instant action against the City.Â  He asserted claims for false imprisonment, \r\n  malicious prosecution, and bad faith termination.Â  In his complaint, Canzater \r\n  alleges the City pursued the prosecution against him without probable cause \r\n  and without conducting a proper investigation to determine whether he engaged \r\n  in the alleged criminal conduct. \r\nThe trial court granted the Cityâ€™s motion to dismiss \r\n  all three counts pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  Specifically, the court \r\n  ruled that Canzaterâ€™s claims for false imprisonment and bad faith termination \r\n  were barred by the statute of limitations and the malicious prosecution claim \r\n  failed as a matter of law because the existence of probable cause was established \r\n  by the issuance of arrest warrants.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.Â  False Imprisonment\r\n  Canzater contends the trial court erred in holding \r\n    his false imprisonment action was barred by the statute of limitations because \r\n    the two-year statutory period did not begin to run until the charges against \r\n    him were dismissed.Â  We disagree.\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-550 (Supp. 2002)\r\n  Â provides \r\n    that the statute of limitations for a false imprisonment claim is two years.Â  \r\n  \r\n  We embrace the rule adopted by other jurisdictions \r\n    that the statute of limitations for false imprisonment begins to run when \r\n    the plaintiff is released following an arrest.Â  Campbell v. Hyatt Regency, \r\n    388 S.E.2d 341, 342 (Ga. Ct. App. 1989) &nbsp;(â€œAn \r\n    action for false imprisonment â€˜must be brought within two years of its accrual \r\n    . . . which is from the release from imprisonment.â€™ â€); Stafford v. Muster, \r\n    582 S.W.2d 670, 680 (Mo. 1979) Â (â€œ[F]or false \r\n    imprisonment in particular, the authorities overwhelmingly hold that a cause \r\n    of action for false imprisonment accrues on the discharge from imprisonment.â€); \r\n    M.C. Dransfield, When Statute of Limitations Begins to Run Against Action \r\n    for False Imprisonment or False Arrest, 49 A.L.R.2d 922 (1956) Â (stating \r\n    the general rule is that the statute of limitations for false imprisonment \r\n    â€œbegins to run from the termination of the imprisonment and not from the time \r\n    when the proceedings under which the plaintiffâ€™s arrest occurred ended . . \r\n    . .â€); see Miller v. Dickert, 259 S.C. 1, 3, 190 S.E.2d 459, \r\n    460 (1972) Â (noting that both parties conceded the \r\n    cause of action in a false imprisonment case accrued from the time of the \r\n    arrest); 8 S.C. Juris. False Imprisonment Â§ 17 (1991).\r\n  Following the return of indictments charging \r\n    Canzater with larceny and conspiracy to commit embezzlement, two different \r\n    circuit judges issued warrants for his arrest on December 3, 1998, and May \r\n    12, 1999, respectively.Â  According to the complaint, Canzater was released \r\n    from custody on his own recognizance after each arrest.Â  Using these two dates \r\n    as the dates of his discharge from imprisonment, it is clear that an action \r\n    brought on November 5, 2001 fails to satisfy the two-year statute of limitations. \r\n  \r\n  II.&nbsp;\r\n  Bad Faith Termination\r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  Canzater also asserts the trial \r\n    court erred in barring his cause of action for bad faith termination under \r\n    the statute of limitations.Â  Specifically, Canzater argues his claim of bad \r\n    faith termination is a contract claim rather than a tort claim and therefore \r\n    beyond the scope of the South Carolina Torts Claims Actâ€™s two-year statute \r\n    of limitations.Â  \r\n  \r\n  Canzater did not raise this issue to the trial \r\n    court and the trial court did not rule upon it.Â  We therefore decline to address \r\n    it.Â  See Holy Loch Distribs., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, \r\n    24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000) Â (â€œIn order to preserve \r\n    an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled \r\n    upon by the trial court.â€) .Â  \r\n  III.&nbsp;\r\n  Malicious Prosecution \r\n  Canzater contends the trial court erred in granting \r\n    the Cityâ€™s motion to dismiss and determining the existence of an arrest warrant \r\n    conclusively establishes probable cause for prosecution.Â  We agree.\r\n  â€œA ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss must be \r\n    based solely upon the allegations set forth on the face of the complaint and \r\n    the motion cannot be sustained if facts alleged and inferences reasonably \r\n    deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to any relief on any theory \r\n    of the case.â€Â  Toussaint v.

Williams, 281 S.C. 182, \r\n    314 S.E.2d 612 (Ct. App. 1984) , we concluded \r\n    that, even though an arrest warrant was issued, â€œ[u]nder the circumstances \r\n    it was for the jury to say whether or not there was probable cause for the \r\n    swearing out of the warrant by Williams.â€ Id. at 187 , 314 S.E.2d at \r\n    615 ; see also Parrott v.

Beatty, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-055\r\nSubmitted January 12, 2004 â€“ Filed January \r\n  28, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nSamuel T.D. Lancaster, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam McBee Smith, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Samuel Lancaster appeals from \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of his appeal from the Spartanburg County Building \r\n  Codes Board of Appeals (the Board).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn June 2001, Spartanburg County (the \r\n  County) informed Lancaster that the storage of inoperable vehicles and appliances \r\n  on his property was in violation of a County ordinance.Â  To that end, the County \r\n  served Lancaster with a â€œNotice of Violation and Order,â€ which ordered Lancaster \r\n  to comply with the ordinance.Â  In response, Lancaster filed a request for a \r\n  variance with the Board.Â  The Board subsequently denied Lancasterâ€™s request \r\n  for a variance.Â Â Â  \r\nLancaster appealed the Boardâ€™s ruling to the circuit \r\n  court.Â  The circuit court judge dismissed Lancasterâ€™s appeal, finding (1) Lancasterâ€™s \r\n  allegations of collusion and equal protection violations were not preserved \r\n  for review and (2) there was substantial evidence to support the Boardâ€™s conclusions.Â  \r\n  The final order also instructed Lancaster to comply with the Boardâ€™s final decision \r\n  within thirty days, and authorized County law enforcement officers to enter \r\n  Lancasterâ€™s property to determine compliance with the order.Â  Lancaster appeals. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n Lancaster argues the circuit court erred \r\n  in upholding the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  We do not agree.\r\nInitially, we note the circuit court was \r\n  correct in finding Lancasterâ€™s collusion and equal protection arguments were \r\n  procedurally barred.Â  As Lancaster had not raised these arguments to the Board, \r\n  he was prohibited from subsequently presenting these issues to the circuit court.Â  \r\n  See, e.g.,Â  Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. \r\n  Control, 348 S.C. 507, 519, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002) (finding issues not \r\n  raised to and ruled on by an administrative agency are not preserved for judicial \r\n  consideration) (citations omitted).\r\nTherefore, the sole issue before this court is \r\n  whether the circuit court erred in dismissing Lancasterâ€™s appeal and upholding \r\n  the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  As Lancaster failed to appear for the Boardâ€™s hearing \r\n  on this matter, the hearing was held in his absence.Â  The inspector who issued \r\n  the Notice of Violation for Lancasterâ€™s property testified that Lancasterâ€™s \r\n  storage of eight inoperable motor vehicles, appliances, shelving, and pipe on \r\n  his property violated the Property Maintenance Code.Â  The inspector also stated \r\n  â€œthe property is obviously in violation of the Code,â€ and added that a neighbor \r\n  had lodged an informal complaint about Lancasterâ€™s property approximately four \r\n  months earlier.Â  The Board then viewed the inspectorâ€™s videotape of the debris \r\n  on Lancasterâ€™s property.Â  After agreeing with the inspector that Lancasterâ€™s \r\n  property was in clear violation of the Code, the Board unanimously voted to \r\n  deny Lancasterâ€™s motion for a variance.Â  \r\nWe find the circuit court was correct in affirming \r\n  the Board.Â  There was more than enough evidence presented at the Board hearing \r\n  to support the Boardâ€™s decision to deny the variance and hold Lancaster in violation \r\n  of the Code.Â  Further, other than presenting a brief to the Board, Lancaster \r\n  did not present any other evidence to support his motion for a variance.Â  As \r\n  the arguments in Lancasterâ€™s brief cannot be considered as evidence and Lancaster \r\n  did not appear at the hearing, Lancaster effectively did not present any evidence \r\n  to the Board.Â  \r\nSimilar to our review of zoning appeals, \r\n  we employ an abuse of discretion standard of review in the instant case.Â  See \r\n  Peterson Outdoor Adver. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 327 S.C. 230, 235, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d 630, 633 (1997) (â€œ[T]he decision of the zoning board will not be upheld \r\n  where it is based on errors of law, . . .Â  or where there is no legal evidence \r\n  to support it, or where the board acts arbitrarily or unreasonably, . . . or \r\n  where, in general, the board has abused its discretion.â€) (citation omitted).Â  \r\n  As such, we find (1) there is substantial evidence to support the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  order dismissing Lancasterâ€™s appeal and (2) the Board neither acted arbitrarily \r\n  nor abused its discretion in denying Lancasterâ€™s motion for a variance.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the circuit court did not err in dismissing Lancasterâ€™s appeal from the Boardâ€™s \r\n  ruling.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased upon the foregoing, the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s order dismissing Lancasterâ€™s appeal is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and CURETON, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-056","title":"Greene v.

Ballard, of W. Columbia and George H. McMaster, of \r\n  Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Deputy Attorney General \r\n  Treva G. Ashworth, Assistant Deputy Attorney General J. Emory Smith, Jr., all \r\n  of Columbia andÂ  W. Foster Gaillard and Thomas L. Harper, Jr., both of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This case involves the disputed \r\n  ownership of real property.Â  George C. Greene, III and Molly F. Greene sought \r\n  to prove they owned a disputed tract of land and that Jack W. Griffith had slandered \r\n  the title to their property by causing a plat to be recorded that showed Griffith \r\n  as the disputed tractâ€™s owner.Â  Griffith denied these allegations and brought \r\n  a third-party action against the State of South Carolina seeking to quiet title \r\n  to other, adjoining property.Â  The trial court ruled in favor of the Greenes \r\n  and the State, finding title to the disputed properties rested with the Greenes \r\n  and the State, respectively.Â  Griffith appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis action arose when Griffith claimed ownership of \r\n  a twelve-foot strip of land held by landowners George and Molly Greene.\r\nIn 1984, the Greenes purchased a lot known as 134 \r\n  East Edgewater Park Drive in Charleston County by deed from Inez R. Bradham.Â  \r\n  This deed describes the boundaries of the property by reference to a plat dated \r\n  February 6, 1984, that indicates the high water mark along Wappoo Creek serves \r\n  as the lotâ€™s eastern boundary.Â  The deed was properly recorded.Â  In 1985, the \r\n  Greenes built a home on the lot, where they have lived continuously since.Â  \r\n\r\nGriffith claims to have acquired adjacent property \r\n  known as â€œMarsh Islandâ€ by deed in 1964. Â The Marsh Island deed references \r\n  a 1913 plat (McCrady Plat) that depicts the property as being surrounded on \r\n  all sides by creeks or bodies of water.Â  One of these creeks separates Marsh \r\n  Island at its western edge from the area that now comprises the Edgewater Park \r\n  Subdivision, where the Greenesâ€™ lot is located.\r\nIn 1997, Griffith commissioned Hagar E. Metts to \r\n  perform a survey ofÂ  the Marsh Island property.Â  Metts prepared a plat (Metts \r\n  Plat) that showed a strip of highland extending from the northeastern corner \r\n  of Marsh Island across the northern property line of the Greenesâ€™ lot, suggesting \r\n  that a narrow twelve-foot strip of land on the eastern edge of the Greenesâ€™ \r\n  lot was actually owned by Griffith.Â  The Metts Plat was recorded.\r\nThe Greenes learned of the Metts Plat when Griffithâ€™s \r\n  son offered to â€œtradeâ€ the disputed strip of land with the Greenes in exchange \r\n  for a grant of an access easement to Marsh Island over the Greenesâ€™ lot.Â  The \r\n  Greenes refused to accept the proposed trade and brought this action to quiet \r\n  title to the disputed portion of their lot or, alternatively, seeking a declaration \r\n  that they owned the disputed area by adverse possession. \r\n  [1] Â  They also sought damages for slander of title.Â  Griffith denied the \r\n  Greenesâ€™ allegations and asserted a counterclaim, seeking an easement by necessity \r\n  across the Greenesâ€™ property. \r\nThe trial court determined the Greenes had title \r\n  to the disputed strip of land adjacent to Marsh Island.Â  Alternatively, it found \r\n  the Greenes had ownership of the disputed strip by virtue of adverse possession. \r\n  Â The court also found the Greenes were entitled to $55,676.62 in damages \r\n  for slander of title caused by Griffith.Â  Griffithâ€™s counterclaim for an easement \r\n  by necessity was denied.\r\nThough this case was \r\n  originally an action to determine title between the Greenes and Griffith, the \r\n  trial court determined that all or a portion of the Marsh Island property might \r\n  be subject to a claim of title by the State. Consequently, the State was joined \r\n  as a party.\r\nIn Griffithâ€™s amended pleadings, he filed a third \r\n  party complaint in which he alleged he had superior title over the State to \r\n  the highlands on Marsh Island.Â  The State answered, denying Griffithâ€™s claim \r\n  of superior title.Â  The trial court found title to the highland portions of \r\n  the Marsh Island property rested solely with the State.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nConcerning the dispute between the Greenes and \r\n  Griffith, the Greenesâ€™ complaint labels its first cause of action as one to \r\n  quiet title.Â  An action to quiet title is one in equity.Â  See Van \r\n  Every v. Chinquapin Hollow, Inc., 265 S.C. 474, 477, 219 S.E.2d 909, 910 \r\n  (1975); Freeman v. Freeman, 323 S.C. 95, 98, 473 S.E.2d 467, 469 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â  However, where, as here, one party asserts paramount title to the \r\n  disputed land to defeat the other partyâ€™s claims, it is an action at law.Â  Mountain \r\n  Lake Colony v. McJunkin, 308 S.C. 202, 204, 417 S.E.2d 578, 579 (1992); \r\n  see also Watson v. Suggs, 313 S.C. 291, 293, 437 S.E.2d \r\n  172, 173 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding that â€œ[a]n action brought for the primary \r\n  purpose of determining title to a disputed land is in the nature of a trespass \r\n  action to try title, which is an action at lawâ€).Â  \r\nThe Greenesâ€™ complaint also asserts causes of action \r\n  for slander of title and adverse possession â€“ both actions at law.Â  See \r\n  Miller v. Leaird, 307 S.C. 56, 61, 413 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1992) (noting \r\n  that an adverse possession claim is an action at law); Boehnlein v. Ansco, \r\n  Inc. 61 Or. App. 389, 393, 657 P.2d 702, 705 (1983) (holding that slander \r\n  of title is an action at law).Â  We also note the only damages sought or awarded \r\n  were under the slander of title claim.\r\nWe hold the action between Griffith and the Greenes \r\n  should be characterized as an action at law, and Griffith, through counsel, \r\n  so conceded at oral argument as to the slander of title claim.Â  As such, our \r\n  scope of review extends only to the correction of errors of law, and factual \r\n  findings of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless a review \r\n  of the record discloses that there is no evidence that reasonably supports those \r\n  findings.Â  Crary v. Djbelli, 329 S.C. 385, 388, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998) \r\n  (citing Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, \r\n  221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976)).\r\nWe find Griffithâ€™s third party action \r\n  against the State concerning title to the highlands involves these partiesâ€™ \r\n  respective claims of paramount title.Â  The pleadings, having squarely placed \r\n  the issue of paramount title before the court, present a legal claim.Â  See \r\n  Van Every, 265 S.C. at 479, 219 S.E.2d at 911 (holding that where pleadings \r\n  present an issue regarding paramount title to land, the issue is a â€œpurely legal \r\n  issueâ€).Â  Our scope of review with respect to Griffithâ€™s third party action \r\n  against the State is, therefore, limited to the correction of legal errors and \r\n  determining if any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s factual findings. \r\n  [2] \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Slander of Title\r\nGriffith first contends the trial \r\n  court erred in finding he slandered the title to Greeneâ€™s property.Â  We find \r\n  no error.\r\nIn South Carolina, slander of title has \r\n  been recognized as a common law cause of action.Â  See Huff v. Jennings, \r\n  319 S.C. 142, 148, 459 S.E.2d 886, 890 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding that, although \r\n  the court was directly addressing a claim for slander of title for the first \r\n  time in South Carolina jurisprudence, â€œSouth Carolina law, through its incorporation \r\n  of the common law of England, recognizes a cause of action for slander of titleâ€).Â  \r\n  To maintain a claim for slander of title, our courts have held â€œthe plaintiff \r\n  must establish (1) the publication (2) with malice (3) of a false statement \r\n  (4) that is derogatory to plaintiffâ€™s title and (5) causes special damages (6) \r\n  as a result of diminished value in the eyes of third parties.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  149, 459 S.E.2d at 891 (adopting the elements of slander of title outlined in \r\n  the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 623A (1977)).\r\nHere, Griffith contests the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling that he slandered the Greenesâ€™ title on the grounds that the Greenes \r\n  failed to establish Griffith acted with malice and that the Greenes failed to \r\n  prove they consequently suffered special damages.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  MaliceÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nWe first find sufficient evidence to support the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s finding that Griffith acted with the requisite malice when he \r\n  recorded the Metts Plat.Â  This court held in Huff v. Jennings that â€œ[i]n \r\n  slander of title actions, the malice requirement may be satisfied by showing \r\n  the publication was made in reckless or wanton disregard of the rights of another, \r\n  or without legal justification.â€Â  Huff, 319 S.C. at 150, 459 S.E.2d at \r\n  891.\r\nSufficient evidence supports the finding that Griffith \r\n  acted in reckless or wanton disregard of the Greenesâ€™ rights to the disputed \r\n  strip and that he acted without legal justification.Â  Significantly, we note \r\n  Griffith admitted at trial that he owns no interest in the disputed strip of \r\n  land and that he never thought he held any interest in that land.Â  Despite this \r\n  admission, Griffith testified that he instructed Metts to prepare the plat and \r\n  stated, â€œI told [Metts] that the tax office said I owned [the strip of land \r\n  in question].â€Â  Metts testified that, when he prepared the plat, he had no evidence \r\n  that Griffith had any ownership interest in the disputed strip. \r\nGriffith counters that he did not record \r\n  the plat, and he did not have any knowledge of how the plat came to be recorded.Â  \r\n  However, the record contains ample evidence supporting the trial courtâ€™s finding \r\n  to the contrary.Â  For example, Griffithâ€™s own testimony reveals that he had \r\n  the plat delivered to the Charleston County Planning Department, he had meetings \r\n  with the Planning Department that involved reference to the plat, and the plat \r\n  was returned to Griffith after it was recorded.Â  Notably, when asked at trial: \r\n  â€œDid you write a check to get that plat recorded?,â€ Griffith responded that \r\n  he â€œmight have.â€\r\n&nbsp;Without looking beyond Griffithâ€™s own \r\n  testimony, we find ample evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s finding he acted \r\n  with malice as defined under Huff.Â  Acknowledging he has never had any \r\n  legal claim to the disputed property, we find Griffith willfully ignored the \r\n  Greenesâ€™ rights in the property and had the plat prepared and recorded with \r\n  no legal justification.\r\n\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Special Damages\r\n\r\nThe trial court conducted a separate hearing to \r\n  determine the amount of damages the Greenes were entitled to receive under the \r\n  slander of title claim.Â  The court awarded as special damages $57,675.62 for \r\n  expenses incurred for attorney fees, expert fees and other litigation costs.Â  \r\n  Huff, 319 S.C. at 151, 459 S.E.2d at 892 (stating that special damages \r\n  recoverable in a slander of title action include â€œthe expense of measures reasonably \r\n  necessary to counteract the publication [of slanderous statements of title], \r\n  including litigationâ€ (quoting 50 Am.Jur.2d Libel &amp; Slander Â§ 560)).Â  \r\n  Griffith challenges the propriety of awarding attorney fees and litigation expenses \r\n  in a slander of title action.Â  In response, the Greenes argue Griffith failed \r\n  to preserve this issue for appellate review.Â  We agree with the Greenes.\r\nAt trial, Griffith did not object to the \r\n  Greenesâ€™ entitlement to these litigation expenses.Â  Griffithâ€™s counsel merely \r\n  requested leave of court to â€œfile a brief â€¦ I just want to be able to review \r\n  the bills, and submit a brief if I do have a question of law concerning multiple \r\n  charges.â€Â  The trial court granted Griffithâ€™s request, observing, â€œI will leave \r\n  [the record] open for ten days to allow [Griffith] to file a memorandum on that.â€Â  \r\n  Griffith filed no response and no Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion was filed challenging \r\n  the special damages in any respect.Â  Having failed to properly raise and preserve \r\n  this issue in the trial court, Griffith may not challenge the award of special \r\n  damages for the first time on appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, \r\n  330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue \r\n  cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to \r\n  and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Adverse Possession\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Griffith next argues \r\n  the trial court erred in finding the Greenes held title to the disputed strip \r\n  by virtue of adverse possession.Â  However, by Griffithâ€™s own admission, he neither \r\n  claims nor holds any interest in the property.Â  Thus, no we find justiciable \r\n  controversy exists with respect to the adverse possession claim.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we decline to address this issue.Â  See Mathis v. South Carolina State \r\n  Hwy. Depâ€™t, 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, 714 (1973) (stating that \r\n  an appellate court will not â€œmake an adjudication where there remains no actual \r\n  controversyâ€).\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Title Dispute with the State\r\nGriffithâ€™s dispute with the State involves the \r\n  highland portions of Marsh Island adjacent to the twelve-foot disputed strip \r\n  and lying to the east of the Greenesâ€™ property. \r\n  [3] Â  Griffith claims he holds title to all of the highland portions of \r\n  Marsh Island.Â  The State, however, asserts superior title to these highland \r\n  areas. [4]   \r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Chain of Title\r\n\r\nWe first concur we the trial courtâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that Griffith does not own the portion of the marshlands in dispute, for the \r\n  contested portion is not part of Griffithâ€™s chain of title.Â  We further find \r\n  Griffith has abandoned this issue on appeal.Â  In his final brief, Griffith recites \r\n  in conclusory fashion under the section entitled â€œstatement of the caseâ€ that \r\n  in 1964 he acquired the property known as Marsh Island.Â  In the argument section \r\n  of the brief, Griffith merely finds fault with the trial courtâ€™s â€œlaborious \r\n  analysis of the chain of title of the Greenes and Griffith, none of which was \r\n  necessary â€¦ nor [is] any of the trial judgeâ€™s analysis regarding the chain of \r\n  title â€¦ relevant to Griffithâ€™s claim.â€Â  We find the detailed analysis of the \r\n  change of title not only relevant, but also dispositive of the issue before \r\n  us. Â The passing reference in Griffithâ€™s brief to the testimony of his expert, \r\n  with neither supporting authority nor argument, falls short of our issue preservation \r\n  rules.Â  See Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 312 S.C. 102, 106, \r\n  439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1993) (stating â€œan issue raised on appeal but \r\n  not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and will not be considered by the \r\n  appellate courtâ€);Â  Bell v. Bennett, 307 S.C. 286, 294, 414 S.E.2d 786, \r\n  791 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding that failure to argue issue in brief constitutes \r\n  abandonment of it); Toal, Vafai, &amp; Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in \r\n  South CarolinaSearch Term End , 75-76 (S.C. Bar 2000) (stating â€œan issue \r\n  is deemed abandoned on appeal, and therefore, not presented for review, if it \r\n  is argued in a short, conclusory statement without supporting authorityâ€). [5] \r\nWe find that the trial courtâ€™s chain of \r\n  title determination is, in any event, correct.Â  The land owned by the Greenes \r\n  and that portion of the disputed marshlands, known as Marsh Island, to the east \r\n  were originally part of a much larger tract of land known as Wappoo Hall Plantation.Â  \r\n  Marsh Island is bounded on the north by Wappoo Creek, on the east by an unnamed \r\n  creek that separates it from Polly Island, on the south by Elliottâ€™s Cut and \r\n  on the west by an unnamed creek that separates it from Fickenâ€™s Island. [6] \r\nWappoo Hall Plantation was conveyed to \r\n  John F. Ficken and Henry H. Ficken in 1898.Â  In 1902, the Fickens conveyed the \r\n  portion of the property on which Marsh Island is located to J. Martin Bottjer \r\n  (Bottjer Deed). [7] Â  When John F. Ficken purportedly conveyed this marshland to \r\n  Griffithâ€™s predecessor in title, Union Corporation, in 1913, Ficken no longer \r\n  had title to this marshland.Â  â€œA grantor of real property generally can transfer \r\n  no greater interest than he himself has in the property.â€Â  Von Elbrecht v. \r\n  Jacobs, 286 S.C. 240, 243, 332 S.E.2d 568, 570 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  We find \r\n  that these marshlands, therefore, are not properly included in Griffithâ€™s chain \r\n  of title.\r\n\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Entitlement to Land Accretion\r\n\r\nAssuming Marsh Island is in Griffithâ€™s chain of \r\n  title, his claim for the highlands must nevertheless fail.\r\nResolution of a controversy as to ownership \r\n  of the wetlands in South Carolina and accompanying highlands must be examined \r\n  in light of special ownership rules.Â  In general, the State holds title to lands \r\n  lying between the mean high water mark and mean low water mark on tidal navigable \r\n  waterways.Â  Hobonny Club, Inc. v. McEachern Caning Co., 272 S.C. 392, \r\n  252 S.E.2d 133 (1979).Â  Lands, however, that form and surround our tidal estuaries \r\n  and marshlands are subject to constant change by the sometimes powerful ebb \r\n  and flow of the tidal waters.Â  Land that may lie below the high tide mark may \r\n  over time, after the gradual deposit of silt and other sediment, rise well above \r\n  the previous mark.Â  The converse is, of course, true because the tides may erode \r\n  highland property so that it eventually falls below the high tide mark.Â  Such \r\n  change may also occur artificially through the efforts of man, as wetland property \r\n  may be filled and no longer be affected by the tides.Â  Because of these changes, \r\n  it can be difficult to discern at any fixed point in time where the rights of \r\n  the State end and the rights of a contiguous, private landowner begin.Â  \r\nOur courts further recognize certain legal \r\n  principles concerning accretions by alluvial or artificial action to riparian \r\n  or littoral lands.Â  Wetland areas that become dry land through the natural accumulation \r\n  of mud, sand and sediment generally do not remain in title to the State, for \r\n  â€œimperceptible additions to the shore from such deposits should follow title \r\n  to the shore itself.â€Â  Epps v. Freeman, 261 S.C. 375, 386, 200 S.E.2d \r\n  235, 241 (1973).Â  Significantly, however, where those accretions result from \r\n  the â€œexertions of man[,] â€¦ the principle that title to imperceptible additions \r\n  to the shore from such deposits should follow title to the shore itself has \r\n  no application.â€Â  Id.Â  The distinction resting on the source of the accretion \r\n  is premised on ownership of contiguous land to which the accretion can attach.Â  \r\n  See Horry County v. Tilghman, 283 S.C. 475, 480, 322 S.E.2d 831, \r\n  834 (Ct. App. 1984) (stating â€œ[a]n ownerâ€™s right to accretion depends upon the \r\n  contiguity of his lands to navigable waters and it is indispensable that there \r\n  be an estate to which the accretion can attachâ€).Â  \r\nMarsh Island derives its name from its \r\n  original state as marshland.Â  The McCrady Plat establishes that, as of 1913, \r\n  Marsh Island contained no highlands. [8] Â  Marsh Island, through the years, \r\n  did not remain an untouched piece of submerged property.Â  There is evidence \r\n  of man-made changes to the marshland.Â  For example, in approximately 1939, the \r\n  Intracoastal Waterwayâ€™s construction resulted in the filling of portions of \r\n  this area.Â  Even Griffithâ€™s expert, Hagar Metts, reluctantly acknowledged that \r\n  the area of these highlands â€œlooks likeâ€ fill.Â  Moreover, after he claims he \r\n  acquired title in 1964, Griffith had approximately one thousand loads of fill \r\n  dirt deposited.Â  To the extent highlands were created by Griffithâ€™s own efforts, \r\n  no ownership benefit may inure to him.Â  This necessarily follows from the settled \r\n  principle that accretions resulting from the â€œexertions of manâ€ preclude application \r\n  of the general rule that title follows the â€œshore itself.â€Â  Epps, 261 \r\n  S.C. at 386, 200 S.E.2d at 241.Â  Pursuant to Horry County v. Tilghman:Â  \r\n\r\n[I]f alluvion is formed artificially and not by [the upland \r\n  ownerâ€™s] direction, he should be entitled to its benefit. . . . [I]f a project \r\n  is undertaken by the State or any governmental agency in aid of navigation, \r\n  and it is essential that the State or agency thereof have the benefit of the \r\n  alluvion formed by the accretion in order to realize the goal undertaken by \r\n  the project, it must be held that the private rights yield to the interest of \r\n  the public. \r\n\r\n283 S.C. at 481, 322 S.E.2d at 834.\r\nGriffith seizes upon the term â€œessentialâ€ \r\n  to argue that it was not essential for the State to â€œhave the benefit of the \r\n  alluvion formed by the accretionâ€ for which it may have been responsible.Â  For \r\n  two fundamental reasons, this argument does little to advance Griffithâ€™s claim \r\n  of title to the highlands.Â  First, Griffith overlooks the other sources, including \r\n  himself, responsible for the fill and the inability to ascertain the degree \r\n  to which the various contributing sources are responsible for the creation of \r\n  the highlands.Â  In light of his burden of proof, Griffith certainly cannot find \r\n  refuge in theÂ  inability to apportion responsibility for the artificial accretions \r\n  among the various contributors. Â Second, it is undisputed the State owns the \r\n  tidelands. [9] Â  In essence, Griffith \r\n  owns no contiguous land â€œto which the accretion can attach.â€Â  Tilghman, \r\n  283 S.C. at 480, 322 S.E.2d at 834.Â  While â€œtitle to imperceptible additions \r\n  â€¦ follow[s] the title to the shore itself[,]â€ Griffith has no â€œshoreâ€ to which \r\n  title can attach.Â  Epps, 261 S.C. at 386, 200 S.E.2d at 241.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find ample evidence in \r\n  the record to support the trial courtâ€™s determination that â€œit is doubtful that \r\n  Griffith has title to any of Marsh Island.â€Â  Our review of the record firmly \r\n  persuades us as well that Griffith failed to meet his burden of proof.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude that the \r\n  trial court correctly found Griffith liable for slandering the Greenesâ€™ title, \r\n  and we find no error with the trial courtâ€™s determination of title in favor \r\n  of the Greenes and the State, respectively.Â  The judgment of the trial court \r\n  is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Griffith also attempted to leverage the State with the \r\n    Metts Plat by seeking a deed from the State transferring to him its interest \r\n    in the property.Â  The State rejected Griffithâ€™s efforts.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Griffith contends on appeal that his action against the \r\n    State should be reviewed de novo as an appeal from a purely equitable \r\n    action.Â  While we disagree, our independent review of the record convinces \r\n    us of the correctness of the trial courtâ€™s findings.Â  Thus, a determination \r\n    of the appropriate standard of review is not critical to the outcome.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The disputed tract is referenced in the record as â€œthe \r\n    lands shown on the [Metts Plat] located immediately to the east of the [d]isputed \r\n    [s]trip and immediately to the east of the Greenesâ€™ property.â€Â  The parties \r\n    have, for ease of reference, consistently referred to the property as Marsh \r\n    Island or the highlands.Â  We will do likewise.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We reject Griffithâ€™s argument that the Stateâ€™s claim of \r\n    title was not before the trial court.Â  Because of Griffithâ€™s claim of superior \r\n    title to the highland portions of Marsh Island, the State was joined as a \r\n    party for the purpose of addressing and resolving Griffithâ€™s claim of paramount \r\n    title.Â  The Stateâ€™s pleading denies Griffithâ€™s claim of paramount title and \r\n    asserts that â€œit has prima facie fee simple title, in public trust, of all \r\n    lands now or formerly lying below the highwater mark of all tidal navigable \r\n    waters in the State, including the lands involved in this case which now lie \r\n    or formerly lay below the mean highwater mark.â€Â  The suggestion that the issue \r\n    of title was not before the trial court belies the record before us.Â  Indeed, \r\n    notwithstanding any purported deficiency in the Stateâ€™s pleadings, the competing \r\n    claims of title to the highlands were presented to the trial court.Â  â€œWhen \r\n    issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent \r\n    of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been \r\n    raised in the pleadings.â€Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP.Â  Finally, any error in affirmatively \r\n    finding in favor of the State would not inure to Griffithâ€™s benefit, for Griffith \r\n    in any event failed to prove his entitlement to the highlands in dispute.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We recognize â€œan appellant may not use the reply brief \r\n    as a vehicle to argue issuesÂ  not argued in the appellantâ€™sÂ  brief.â€Â  Appellate \r\n    Practice in South Carolina, at 75.Â  Nevertheless, we note Griffithâ€™s reply \r\n    brief makes no mention of the trial courtâ€™s chain of title determination, \r\n    although such issue is featured in the Respondentsâ€™ briefs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The eastern portion of Fickenâ€™s Island is now known as \r\n    the Edgewater Park subdivision.Â  The Greenesâ€™ lot is located in Edgewater \r\n    Park.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Bottjer Deed transfers Fickens Island and its adjoining \r\n    marshes.Â  The accompanying plat clearly designates the adjacent marshes as \r\n    part of the conveyance.Â  The plat is recorded with the deed in the land records \r\n    office of Charleston County in Book X-23, P 663.Â  â€œWhere a deed describes \r\n    land as it is shown on a certain plat, such plat becomes part of the deed \r\n    for the purpose of showing the boundaries, metes, courses and distances of \r\n    the property conveyed.â€Â  Hobonny Club, Inc. v. McEachern Caning Co, \r\n    272 S.C. 392, 397, 252 S.E.2d 133, 136 (1979).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  By contrast, the McCrady Plat depicts the nearby Polly \r\n    Island as containing a small area designated as highland.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  After acquiring a deed for Marsh Island in 1964, Griffith \r\n    had approximately one thousand loads of fill deposited.Â  The State filed suit \r\n    to enjoin the filling, asserting its claim to all of the wetlands areas of \r\n    Marsh Island.Â  The case progressed to the state supreme court, which held \r\n    the State had title to the â€œtidelands,â€ specifically the â€œland between the \r\n    lines of the ordinary high and low tides covered and uncovered by the daily \r\n    flow and ebb thereof.â€Â  State v.

Nance and A. Shane Massey, both of Aiken, for Appellants.\r\nBruce McGhee, Janis McGhee and Richard L. Pearce, \r\n  all of Aiken, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â William and Kathleen Blalock \r\n  appeal an order by the City of Aikenâ€™s Board of Zoning Appeals (â€œBZAâ€), subsequently \r\n  affirmed by the circuit court, granting Bruce and Janet McGhee a special exception \r\n  to the cityâ€™s zoning ordinance.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe McGhees own and operate a horse \r\n  racing and training facility in the â€œHorse Districtâ€ zone of Aiken.Â  They filed \r\n  an application with the BZA for a special exception to the cityâ€™s zoning ordinance \r\n  to construct an eating establishment, tack shop, groomsâ€™ quarters and trainersâ€™ \r\n  quarters on the 78- acre property.Â  \r\nThe BZA, as required by the zoning ordinance, \r\n  scheduled a public hearing on the matter.Â  Prior to the hearing, they conspicuously \r\n  posted notice on the actual property.Â  Notice was also published in the local \r\n  newspaper, on a local cable television station, on the cityâ€™s web site, and \r\n  mailed to all contiguous property owners.Â  The notice, while listing all of \r\n  the proposed uses requiring a zoning exception (including the restaurant), did \r\n  not specify whether alcohol would be served on the premises.\r\nThe Blalocks own residential property \r\n  abutting the McGhees.Â  They received a mailed notice of the public hearing.Â  \r\n  They chose not to personally attend the hearing, but sent a letter expressing \r\n  their objection to all of the McGheesâ€™ requested exceptions to the zoning ordinance.Â  \r\n  The possibility of alcohol sales in the restaurant was acknowledged and discussed \r\n  at the hearing.Â  Thereafter, the BZA granted the application for special exceptions, \r\n  but placed ten conditions on the approval, including a mandatory 9:00 p.m. closing \r\n  time.\r\nThe Blalocks appealed this order to the \r\n  circuit court.Â  They argued that the absence in the notice of any indication \r\n  that alcohol would be served on the McGheesâ€™ property amounted to a violation \r\n  of both the notice provision of the zoning ordinance and their constitutional \r\n  guarantee of due process.Â  Furthermore, they argued that the zoning ordinance \r\n  itself prohibits the sale of alcohol within the Horse District. The judge denied \r\n  their appeal and affirmed the order of the BZA.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Notice Provision and Due Process\r\nThe notice provision \r\n  of the zoning ordinance requires that mailed notice inform recipients of the \r\n  â€œnature of the application.â€Â  See Zoning Ordinance, City of Aiken, Â§ \r\n  6.1.4(C)Â  Additionally, the Due Process Clauses of the Constitutions of the \r\n  United States and South Carolina require â€œnotice which fairly and reasonably \r\n  apprises those whose rights may be affected of the nature and character of the \r\n  action proposed.â€Â  Brown v. County of Charleston, 303 S.C. 245, 247, \r\n  399 S.E.2d 784, 786 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  Appellants argue that the absence of any \r\n  indication of alcohol sales in the Cityâ€™s notice of the public hearing violated \r\n  the ordinance by not specifying â€œthe nature of the applicationâ€ and the Due \r\n  Process Clauses by not apprising them of the true â€œnature and character of the \r\n  action,â€ thus denying them an â€œopportunity to be heard in a meaningful way.â€Â  \r\n  See Universal Benefits, Inc. v. McKinney, 349 S.C. 179, 183, 561 \r\n  S.E.2d 659, 661 (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Due Process Clause \r\n  of the U.S. Constitution demands only â€œnotice reasonably calculated, under all \r\n  the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action \r\n  and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.â€Â  Mullane v. \r\n  Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S. Ct. 652, 657 \r\n  (1950); S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 22 (â€œNo person shall be finally bound by a judicial \r\n  or quasi judicial decision of an administrative agency affecting private rights \r\n  except on due notice and an opportunity to be heardâ€¦â€).Â  We find that the City \r\n  of Aikenâ€™s actions to notify the community of this public hearing exceeded this \r\n  constitutional mandate.Â  Notice was posted and published in several adequate \r\n  forms, best evidenced by the fact that the Blalocks received actual notice in \r\n  time to attend the hearing had they been so inclined. \r\n The Blalocksâ€™ arguments \r\n  hint to the fact that they would have been present at the hearing had they known \r\n  the McGhees were contemplating the sale of alcohol on the premises.Â  While this \r\n  may be true, minimum due process requirements simply do not mandate the degree \r\n  of specificity desired by the Blalocks.Â  The â€œnature of the applicationâ€ and \r\n  â€œcharacter of the actionâ€ was adequately described in the notice.Â  This hearing \r\n  was to offer the public an opportunity to comment on an exception to the zoning \r\n  ordinance, not a grant of a liquor license.Â Â  \r\nWe conclude that the \r\n  Blalocks were given reasonable notice of the nature of the application.Â  Had \r\n  they desired more detail regarding the restaurant or wished to better articulate \r\n  their objections to the proposed zoning exceptions, it was their right to attend, \r\n  ask questions, and present any specific objections.Â  They chose, however, to \r\n  be meaningfully heard in writing rather than personally attend the hearing.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, not only did the BZA consider the Blalocksâ€™ letter, but the issues \r\n  they claim to have been denied the opportunity to raise were raised by others \r\n  and considered at the hearing.Â  Due process mandates that every interested party \r\n  be granted the opportunity to be heard, not that every interested party, regardless \r\n  of the partyâ€™s own initiative, is actually heard.Â  We find that the Blalocks \r\n  were given due process and the zoning ordinanceâ€™s notice requirement was satisfied.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  The Zoning Ordinance\r\nThe Blalocks \r\n  contend that the zoning ordinance prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages \r\n  within the Horse District and, therefore, the BZA improperly granted the special \r\n  exception by not expressly prohibiting the sale of alcohol at the proposed restaurant \r\n  in its order.Â  We disagree.\r\nA zoning boardâ€™s decision \r\n  should not be disturbed unless the boardâ€™s findings resulted from action â€œwhich \r\n  is arbitrary, an abuse of discretion, illegal, or in excess of lawfully delegated \r\n  authority.â€Â  Bannum, Inc. v. City of Columbia, 335 S.C. 202, 205, 516 \r\n  S.E.2d 439, 440 (1999).Â  This court should refrain from substituting its judgment \r\n  for that of the BZA, even if we disagree.Â  See Restaurant Row Assocs. \r\n  v. Horry County, 335 S.C. 209, 216, 516 S.E.2d 442, 446 (1999).Â  While recognizing \r\n  that this court is permitted a â€œbroader and more independent reviewâ€ in cases \r\n  such as this, concerning ordinance construction, we choose to maintain this \r\n  well-recognized deference to the zoning boardâ€™s discretion.Â  See Charleston \r\n  County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d \r\n  841, 843 (1995) (applying a broader scope of review in ordinance construction \r\n  cases).\r\nThe ordinance expressly allows \r\n  a restaurant in the Horse District by special exception under the category of \r\n  â€œEating Establishments.â€Â  Although the ordinance prohibits a â€œliquor storeâ€ \r\n  and â€œnightclub or barâ€ under a separate category titled â€œRetail Sales and Service,â€ \r\n  we do not find â€œby implication,â€ as the Blalocks suggest, an outright prohibition \r\n  on all alcohol sales.Â  Were it the intention of the drafters to ban all alcohol \r\n  sales in the Horse District, they could have very simply done so in a clear, \r\n  express manner.Â  Given our standard of review, we are constrained to defer to \r\n  the zoning boardâ€™s interpretation absent evidence of arbitrariness, abuse of \r\n  discretion, or illegality.Â  There is no such evidence here.Â  Thus, we defer \r\n  to the decision of the BZA that the zoning ordinance does not ban the sale of \r\n  alcohol outright in the Horse District. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn accordance with the broad \r\n  discretion vested in the BZA and the multiple notices that comply with due process, \r\n  the order of the BZA is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-058","title":"Cummings v.

Solomon, of Myrtle Beach, for Appellants.\r\nBryan P. Stirling, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Clyde D. Cummings, Jr., and Doris C. \r\n  Cummings appeal a circuit court order granting summary judgment in favor of \r\n  Newby, Pridgen, &amp; Sartip, Attorneys at Law and Bill M. Pridgen in this attorney \r\n  malpractice action.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 24, 1995, the Cummings purchased \r\n  condominium unit #1516 at Beach Cove in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  Bill \r\n  M. Pridgen, a member of the firm of Newby, Pridgen &amp; Sartip, represented \r\n  the Cummings at the closing.Â  Prior to the closing, a title search revealed \r\n  no lis pendens of record affecting the condominium unit #1516. \r\nHowever, in 1993 two lawsuits were filed \r\n  against the Beach Cove Condominium Complex.Â  The first suit \r\n  [1]  sought recovery for damages caused as a result of defective construction \r\n  at the condominium complex.Â  The second, \r\n  [2]  a class action consisting of individual homeowners, sought recovery \r\n  for losses of rental income and damages to the interior of the individual condominiums.Â  \r\n  Although both cases settled, the settlement amount did not cover the cost of \r\n  repairs or the loss of rental income suffered by the homeowners.Â  As a result, \r\n  each owner of a condominium unit at Beach Cove was assessed varying amounts \r\n  to fund repairs necessitated by the settlement.Â  \r\nThe Cummings filed suit on October 9, 1998 to recover \r\n  the amount of the assessments as well as punitive damages, alleging Pridgen \r\n  and his firm were at fault in not disclosing prior to closing the existence \r\n  of the two lawsuits concerning the Beach Cove Condominium Complex.Â  Pridgen \r\n  and the firm answered, denying liability.Â  It is undisputed the Cummings received \r\n  marketable title to their condominium unit.Â  \r\nPridgen and the firm filed a motion for summary \r\n  judgment on December 13, 2001, more than three years after the action was filed.Â  \r\n  Â Â It was argued that a plaintiff in a malpractice case must establish \r\n  the standard of care through expert testimony.Â  Because the Cummings did not \r\n  produce an expert for this purpose, movants contended they were entitled to \r\n  summary judgment.\r\nThe Cummings relied on a â€œtitle abstractorâ€ as \r\n  their expert.Â  The title abstractor did not offer an opinion on an attorneyâ€™s \r\n  duties in terms of disclosure to a client in a real estate transaction, but \r\n  merely opined that had she conducted the title search, she would have informed \r\n  the closing attorney of the existence of the then two pending lawsuits.Â  The \r\n  Cummings alternatively argued that disclosure of the lawsuits was within the \r\n  common knowledge of laypersons, thus providing an exception to the general rule \r\n  requiring expert testimony. \r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment, \r\n  agreeing with Pridgen and the firm that in this legal malpractice action, the \r\n  standard of care must be proven through expert testimony. The Cummings appeal. \r\n  Â Â \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court err in granting summary judgment, as \r\n  expert testimony was not offered to establish the standard of care owed by an \r\n  attorney in a real estate transaction?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, \r\n  this Court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule \r\n  56(c), SCRCP.â€Â  Fisher v. Stevens, 355 S.C. 290, 294, 584 S.E.2d 149, \r\n  151 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., \r\n  306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991)). Accordingly, summary judgment is appropriate \r\n  when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving \r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  â€œIn \r\n  determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, as will preclude summary \r\n  judgment, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  McNair \r\n  v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 341, 499 S.E.2d 488, 493 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Cummings argue the circuit court erred \r\n  in granting summary judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThere are four elements to a cause of action for \r\n  legal malpractice: 1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship; 2) breach \r\n  of a duty by the attorney; 3) damage to the client; and 4) proximate causation \r\n  of the clientâ€™s damages by the breach.â€Â  Smith v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay \r\n  &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 435 n.2, 472 S.E.2d 612, 613 n.2 (1996).\r\nGenerally, in a legal malpractice case, \r\n  the standard of care an attorney owes in a particular transaction must be proven \r\n  by expert testimony, unless the subject matter of the transaction is within \r\n  the common knowledge of laypersons.Â  Mali v. Odom, 295 S.C. 78, 80, 367 \r\n  S.E.2d 166, 168 (Ct. App. 1988) (citations omitted); McNair v. Rainsford, \r\n  330 S.C. 332, 343, 499 S.E.2d 488, 494 (Ct. App. 1998); see also 7 Am. \r\n  Jur. 2d Attorneys at Law Â§ 237 (1997).Â  Significantly, the rules of evidence \r\n  governing legal malpractice actions are the same as those used for other professionals, \r\n  i.e., doctors, architects, accountants, and dentists.Â  Mali, 295 S.C. \r\n  at 80, 376 S.E.2d at 168 (citing House v. Maddox, 360 N.E.2d 580 (Ill. \r\n  App. Ct. 1977)).\r\nIn Gilliland v. Elmwood Props., \r\n  301 S.C. 295, 391 S.E.2d 577 (1990), the plaintiff, an architect, sued the defendant \r\n  for breach of contract.Â  The defendant counterclaimed, asserting the architect \r\n  was professionally negligent by failing to design the project according to the \r\n  contractâ€™s specifications.Â  Our supreme court stated the following:\r\n\r\nThe well known rule still exists that generally, in a malpractice \r\n  case, â€œthere can be no finding of negligence in the absence of expert testimony \r\n  to support it.â€Â  The claimant in a malpractice claim must, through expert testimony, \r\n  establish both the standard of care and the deviation by the defendant from \r\n  such standard.Â  Here, [the defendant] presented no evidence from an expert that \r\n  [the plaintiff] had committed malpractice.Â  Thus, the summary judgment was, \r\n  in this respect, proper.\r\n\r\nId. at 300-301, 391 S.E.2d 580 (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nThe same situation is presented in this \r\n  case.Â  The Cummings have presented no expert evidence either establishing the \r\n  standard of care owed by Pridgen and his firm or showing a deviation from that \r\n  standard.Â  Instead, the Cummings offer the testimony of a title abstractor who \r\n  would testify that if the closing attorney had inquired, she would have informed \r\n  him of the lawsuits pending against the condominium complex.Â  The Cummings then \r\n  leap to the conclusion that Pridgen should have passed the information on to \r\n  them.Â  As noted, the Cummingsâ€™ fall-back position is that disclosure of this \r\n  information fits within the common knowledge exception, thereby obviating the \r\n  need for expert testimony.Â  We reject the Cummingsâ€™ arguments.Â  \r\nThe threshhold determination in a case alleging \r\n  attorney malpractice is the standard that the attorney failed to meet.Â  In thisÂ  \r\n  case, the question is whether Pridgen failed to act according to the standard \r\n  of care governing attorneys engaged in real estate transactions.Â  A title abstractor \r\n  simply cannot present testimony to this end.Â  In Ex Parte Charles Watson, \r\n  Jr., Op. No. 25757 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Dec. 1, 2003) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. \r\n  No. 43 at 30), in no ambiguous terms, our supreme court held â€œthat when nonlawyer \r\n  title abstractors examine public records and then render an opinion as to the \r\n  content of those records, they are engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 2.Â  Therefore, it logically follows that a title abstractor, whose \r\n  research and resulting opinion constitutes the unauthorized practice of law, \r\n  may not properly testify to the standard of care owed by an attorney in a real \r\n  estate transaction.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nMoreover, we find the issue as to the attorneyâ€™s \r\n  standard of care in this matter well beyond the common knowledge of laypersons.Â Â Â  \r\n  Absent proper expert testimony, we decline to impose on attorneys in real estate \r\n  transactions the standard of care advocated by the Cummings.Â  This case illustrates \r\n  well the rationale warranting the application of the general rule requiring \r\n  expert testimony.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we concur with the \r\n  circuit court and hold that the allegation of attorney malpractice in this real \r\n  estate transaction required expert testimony as to the standard of care and \r\n  deviation from such standard. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Beach Cove Resort Homeowners Assâ€™n, Inc. v.

Turner (â€œSellerâ€).Â  The contract provided Seller would convey marketable \r\n  title to Buyers at a closing to occur between October 8, 1999 and October 23, \r\n  1999.Â  Additionally, the contract required Buyers to deposit $500 in earnest \r\n  money with Sellerâ€™s agent, the Baron Agency.Â  \r\nOn October 13, 1999, Sellerâ€™s broker, Odell Short \r\n  (â€œBrokerâ€), met with Buyers to close on the property.Â  However, Buyers stated \r\n  they believed the adjacent landowners, Steve and Rhonda Conner (â€œNeighborsâ€), \r\n  were in violation of the subdivisionâ€™s restrictive covenants.Â  Thus, Buyers \r\n  refused to close until Broker obtained assurance from Neighbors that they would \r\n  abide by the restrictive covenants.Â Â  \r\nTo accommodate Buyers, Broker offered to speak \r\n  with Neighbors in attempt to obtain their written assurance.Â Â  However, Broker \r\n  and Buyers did not discuss an extension of the closing deadline.Â  \r\nOn October 15, 1999, Broker met with Neighbors \r\n  to discuss the restrictive covenants.Â  During the meeting, Neighbors offered \r\n  to purchase the property in the event Buyers did not close.Â  Broker then negotiated \r\n  a â€œback-upâ€ contract, clearly marked as such, by which Neighbors agreed to purchase \r\n  the property from Seller in the event Buyers failed to close.Â  \r\nOn October 23, 1999, Buyersâ€™ contract expired.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  the Baron Agency informed Buyers their failure to close constituted a breach \r\n  of contract entitling Seller to keep the $500 earnest money.Â  Subsequently, \r\n  Neighbors purchased Sellerâ€™s property pursuant to the back-up contract. \r\nBuyers sued for:Â  1) breach of contract \r\n  against Seller; 2) violation of the UTPA against Seller, Broker and the Baron \r\n  Agency; 3) violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing against \r\n  Seller, Broker, the Baron Agency, and Neighbors; 4) tortious interference with \r\n  a contract against Broker, the Baron Agency, and Neighbors; 5) intentional interference \r\n  with a prospective contract against Broker, the Baron Agency, and Neighbors; \r\n  6) civil conspiracy against Seller, Broker, the Baron Agency, and Neighbors; \r\n  and 7) conversion against Seller and the Baron Agency.Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment in favor \r\n  of all of the defendants on the causes of action for breach of contract, violation \r\n  of the UTPA, violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious \r\n  interference with a contract, and intentional interference with a prospective \r\n  contract.  [1] Â Â Â  \r\nThe case proceeded to trial on the civil conspiracy \r\n  claim against Seller, Broker, the Baron Agency, and Neighbors and on the conversion \r\n  claim against Seller and the Baron Agency.Â  At the close of Buyersâ€™ case, the \r\n  circuit court granted the Baron Agencyâ€™s motion for directed verdict on the \r\n  conversion action.Â  Thereafter, at the close of the trial, the circuit court \r\n  granted Neighborsâ€™ motion for directed verdict on the civil conspiracy action \r\n  and struck the claim for punitive damages against Seller in the conversion cause \r\n  of action.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Buyers on the conversion \r\n  action against Seller in the amount of $500 and found for the defendants on \r\n  the remaining causes of action.Â  Buyers appeal.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where \r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is clear the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  If further \r\n  inquiry into the facts is necessary to clarify application of the law, summary \r\n  judgment is not appropriate.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, \r\n  325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  â€œSummary judgment should not be granted even \r\n  when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts if there is dispute as to the \r\n  conclusion to be drawn from those facts.â€Â  Id.Â  The evidence and the \r\n  inferences drawn therefrom must be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  party.Â  Id.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Breach of Contract\r\nBuyers argue the circuit court erred \r\n  by granting summary judgment on their breach of contract claim because questions \r\n  of fact exist.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhere a contractâ€™s language is plain and \r\n  unambiguous, the language used by the parties â€œdetermines the instrumentâ€™s force \r\n  and effect.â€Â  Jordan v. Sec. Group, Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d \r\n  705, 707 (1993).Â  â€œThe judicial function of a court of law is to enforce a contract \r\n  as made by the parties, and not to rewrite or to distort, under the guise of \r\n  judicial construction, contracts, the terms of which are plain and unambiguous.â€Â  \r\n  Hardee v. Hardee, 355 S.C. 382, 387, 585 S.E.2d 501, 503 (2003).Â  â€œIt \r\n  is not the province of the courts to construe contracts broader than the parties \r\n  have elected to make them or to award benefits where none was [sic] intended.â€Â  \r\n  Stewart v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 341 S.C. 143, 151, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  597, 601 (2000).Â  \r\nThe language utilized in the contract required \r\n  Seller to convey marketable title at a closing to occur between October 8, 1999 \r\n  and October 23, 1999, with time being of the essence.Â  However, at the closing \r\n  scheduled pursuant to the contract, Buyers refused to complete the transaction, \r\n  stating they would not close on the property without written assurance from \r\n  Neighbors they would abide by the subdivisionâ€™s restrictive covenants.Â  Broker \r\n  agreed to talk with Neighbors.Â  However, no evidence exists indicating Broker \r\n  guaranteed he would satisfy Buyersâ€™ concerns.Â  Furthermore, no evidence exists \r\n  indicating the parties discussed altering provisions of Buyersâ€™ contract with \r\n  Seller.Â  Subsequently, the contract expired, and Seller sold the property to \r\n  Neighbors.\r\nBrokerâ€™s conversation with Buyers, indicating he would \r\n  speak to Neighbors, without more, is insufficient to alter the time provisions \r\n  of Buyersâ€™ contract with Seller. See Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of \r\n  South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 405-06, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003) (holding \r\n  the necessary elements of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and valuable \r\n  consideration, and a written contract may be modified by a subsequent agreement \r\n  of the parties, provided the subsequent agreement contains all the requisites \r\n  of a valid contract).Â  Thus, Buyersâ€™ claim for breach of contract, if cognizable, \r\n  must be based on the terms of the written contract.Â  \r\nThe written contract provided Seller must convey \r\n  marketable title to Buyers at a closing to occur between October 8, 1999, and \r\n  October 23, 1999, with time being of the essence.Â  Buyer provides no argument \r\n  or authority, nor are we aware of any, to support the proposition that marketable \r\n  title includes an obligation on the part of a seller to force an adjoining landowner \r\n  to comply with restrictive covenants on the adjoining landownerâ€™s property.\r\nAdditionally, Buyers claim Broker, as developer \r\n  of the subdivision and in his capacity as signatory to the restrictive covenants, \r\n  had a duty to enforce the covenants. Â As authority supporting this claim, Buyers \r\n  cite to the restrictive covenants.Â  However, nowhere in the covenants document \r\n  is this duty imposed upon Broker, nor is the duty to enforce the covenants imposed \r\n  upon any specific individual.Â  The covenants merely provide a legal right to \r\n  enforce the restrictions against anyone violating or attempting to violate a \r\n  covenant.  [2] \r\nIt is undisputed that Seller was ready, willing, \r\n  and able to perform in accordance with the contract at all times between October \r\n  8 and October 23.Â  However, Buyers, at the scheduled closing, refused to perform \r\n  and attempted to unilaterally alter provisions of the contract.Â  Because the \r\n  contract states time was of the essence, and Seller was ready, willing, and \r\n  able to perform pursuant to the contract, Buyers cannot claim Seller breached \r\n  the contract merely because Seller sold the property to another following the \r\n  contractâ€™s expiration.Â  See 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 716 (2003) \r\n  (â€œâ€˜[B]reach[]â€™ . . . [of a contract] is . . . a failure . . . to perform any \r\n  promise which forms a whole or a part of a contract, including the refusal of \r\n  a party to recognize the existence of the contract or the doing of something \r\n  inconsistent with its existence.â€); see also Stewart, 341 S.C. \r\n  at 151, 533 S.E.2d at 601 (â€œIt is not the province of the courts to construe \r\n  contracts broader than the parties have elected to make them or to award benefits \r\n  where none was [sic] intended.â€).Â Â  Thus, the circuit court did not err by granting \r\n  summary judgment.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\r\nBuyers argue the circuit court erred by \r\n  granting summary judgment to Seller, Broker, the Baron Agency, and Neighbors \r\n  on the action for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAlthough implied covenants are not favored \r\n  in the law, . . . there exists in every contract an implied covenant of good \r\n  faith and fair dealing.â€Â  Commercial Credit Corp. v. Nelson Motors, Inc., \r\n  247 S.C. 360, 366-67, 147 S.E.2d 481, 484 (1966); Williams v. Riedman, \r\n  339 S.C. 251, 267, 529 S.E.2d 28, 36 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Thus, \r\n\r\nwhenever the cooperation of the promisee is necessary for \r\n  the performance of the promise, there is a condition implied that the cooperation \r\n  will be given. [Furthermore,] [w]hen one undertakes to accomplish a certain \r\n  result he agrees by implication to do everything to accomplish the result intended \r\n  by the parties . . . . Moreover, there is an implied undertaking in every contract \r\n  on the part of each party that he will not intentionally and purposely do anything \r\n  to prevent the other party from carrying out his part of the agreement, or do \r\n  anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the \r\n  other party to receive the fruits of the contract. \r\n\r\n17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 380 (2003).\r\nInitially, because no evidence exists \r\n  within the record indicating Neighbors had a contract with Buyers or were in \r\n  privity of contract with Seller in relation to the contract with Buyers, Neighbors \r\n  cannot be liable for a breach of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  \r\n  See Commerical Credit, 247 S.C. at 368, 147 S.E.2d at 484 (holding \r\n  the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in contractual relationships \r\n  and exists between the contracting parties).Â  Thus, as to Neighbors, the circuit \r\n  court properly granted summary judgment. \r\nAs to Seller, Broker, and the Baron Agency, Broker \r\n  told Buyers he would speak with Neighbors concerning the violation of the restrictive \r\n  covenants.Â  However, no evidence exists indicating Broker either guaranteed \r\n  he would remedy the violation or that the contract would be extended.Â  \r\nBroker spoke to Neighbors and they offered to buy \r\n  the property if Buyers did not close.Â  Seller, Broker, and the Baron Agency \r\n  did not alert Buyers to the fact they signed a back-up contract.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  they did not alert Buyers the time for performance under the contract was expiring.Â  \r\n  Buyersâ€™ contract expired without a closing, and, pursuant to the back-up contract, \r\n  Seller sold the property to Neighbors.Â  \r\nThis evidence is insufficient, without more, to \r\n  establish a breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as it does \r\n  not indicate Seller, Broker, or the Baron Agency either:Â  1) engaged in some \r\n  act to prevent Buyers from performing under the contract; or 2) failed to do \r\n  some act, thus hindering Buyersâ€™ ability to perform.Â  Consequently, the circuit \r\n  court did not err by granting summary judgment.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Violation of the UTPA\r\nBuyers argue the circuit court erred by \r\n  granting summary judgment to Seller, Broker, and the Baron Agency on Buyersâ€™ \r\n  claim for violation of the UTPA.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder the UTPA, â€œ[u]nfair methods of competition \r\n  and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce \r\n  are . . . declared unlawful.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20(a) (1985).Â  â€œMere breach \r\n  of contract does not constitute a violation of the UTPA.â€Â  South Carolina \r\n  Natâ€™l Bank v. Silks, 295 S.C. 107, 111, 367 S.E.2d 421, 423 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\n  To bring a private action under the UTPA, a party must prove â€œthe defendantâ€™s \r\n  actions adversely affected the public interest.â€Â  Daisy Outdoor Adver. Co. \r\n  v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 493, 473 S.E.2d 47, 49 (1996).Â  â€œUnfair or deceptive \r\n  acts or practices have an impact upon the public interest if the acts or practices \r\n  have the potential for repetition.â€Â  Crary v. Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, \r\n  387, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998).Â Â Â  The potential for repetition is demonstrated \r\n  by showing: (1) the same type of actions occurred before, making it likely the \r\n  actions will continue; or (2) the organizationâ€™s policies or procedures â€œcreate \r\n  a potential for repetition of the unfair and deceptive acts.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThese \r\n  are not the only means of showing the potential for repetition, however, and \r\n  each case must be evaluated on its own merits.â€Â  deBondt v. Carlton Motorcars, \r\n  Inc., 342 S.C. 254, 270, 536 S.E.2d 399, 407 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nIn a light most favorable to Buyers, no \r\n  evidence exists within the record indicating the actions of Seller, Broker, \r\n  or the Baron Agency, if unfair or deceptive, had a public impact or a potential \r\n  for repetition.Â  See Crary, 329 S.C. at 387, 496 S.E.2d at 23.Â  \r\n  Thus, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations\r\nBuyers argue the circuit court erred by granting \r\n  summary judgment on their claim for tortious interference with a contract.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nTo sustain an action for tortious interference \r\n  with a contract, a party must show â€œ(1) a contract; (2) the wrongdoerâ€™s knowledge \r\n  thereof; (3) his intentional procurement of its breach; (4) the absence of justification; \r\n  and (5) the damage resulting therefrom.â€Â  Kinard v. Crosby, 315 S.C. \r\n  237, 240, 433 S.E.2d 835, 837 (1993).Â  A third party is liable for tortious \r\n  interference with a contract where one intentionally induces a party to the \r\n  contract not to perform.Â  Threlkeld v. Christoph, 280 S.C. 225, 227, \r\n  312 S.E.2d 14, 16 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  â€œGenerally, there can be no finding of intentional \r\n  interference with . . . contractual relations if there is no evidence to suggest \r\n  any purpose or motive by the defendant other than the proper pursuit of its \r\n  own contractual rights with a third party.â€Â  United Educ. Distrib., LLC, \r\n  v. Educ. Testing Serv., 350 S.C. 7, 14, 564 S.E.2d 324, 328 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nAs the circuit court properly held there was no \r\n  breach of contract in this case, there can be no â€œintentional procurementâ€ of \r\n  a breach on the part of Neighbors, Broker, or the Baron Agency.Â  Thus, the circuit \r\n  court properly granted summary judgment.\r\n  V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Civil Conspiracy\r\nBuyers argue the circuit court erred by \r\n  granting a directed verdict to Neighbors on the civil conspiracy cause of action. \r\n   [3] Â  We disagree.\r\nIn reviewing a denial of motions for directed verdict, \r\n  the evidence and reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom must be viewed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Brady Dev. Co. v. Town \r\n  of Hilton Head Island, 312 S.C. 73, 78, 439 S.E.2d 266, 269 (1993); Â Evans \r\n  v. Taylor Made Sandwich Co., 337 S.C. 95, 99, 522 S.E.2d 350, 352 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999).Â  The motion should not be granted where the â€œevidence yields more than \r\n  one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Evans, 337 S.C. at 99, \r\n  522 S.E.2d at 352.Â  When considering the motion, neither the appellate court \r\n  nor the circuit court has authority to â€œdecide credibility issues or to resolve \r\n  conflicts in the testimony and evidence.â€Â  Reiland v. Southland Equip. Serv., \r\n  Inc., 330 S.C. 617, 634, 500 S.E.2d 145, 154 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nIn order to establish a claim for civil \r\n  conspiracy, a plaintiff must demonstrate â€œa combination of two or more persons \r\n  joining for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and causing special damage \r\n  to the plaintiff.â€Â  LaMotte v. Punch Line of Columbia, Inc., 296 S.C. \r\n  66, 69, 370 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1988).Â  â€œLawful acts may become actionable as a \r\n  civil conspiracy when the â€˜object is to ruin or damage the business of another.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Gynecology Clinic, Inc., v. Cloer, 334 S.C. 555, 556, 514 S.E.2d 592, \r\n  592 (1999).\r\nThe evidence within the record indicates \r\n  Neighbors were unaware Buyersâ€™ adjacent lot was for sale until they received \r\n  a telephone call from Broker concerning the violation of the restrictive covenants.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the evidence indicates that even after creating the back-up contract \r\n  with Seller, Neighbors had no expectation the contract would become effective.Â Â  \r\n  Moreover, entering into a â€œbackupâ€ contract does not infer the parties conspired \r\n  to â€œruin or damageâ€ Buyersâ€™ opportunity to close.Â  As no other evidence exists \r\n  within the record indicating Neighbors acted in conjunction with any party to \r\n  interfere with Buyersâ€™ contract, the circuit court properly granted Neighborsâ€™ \r\n  motion for directed verdict.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  decision is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Appellants did not appeal the grant of summary \r\n    judgment on the claim for intentional interference with a prospective contract. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Additionally, Buyers failed to provide any legal \r\n    authority supporting this position.Â  Therefore, we deem it abandoned. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Additionally, Buyers argue the circuit court erred by granting a \r\n    directed verdict to Neighbors and Broker on the issue of punitive damages \r\n    after raising the issue on its own motion.Â  However, Buyers failed to object \r\n    to the circuit courtâ€™s sua sponte ruling on punitive damages, and therefore, \r\n    this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Bryant v. \r\n    Waste Mgmt, Inc., 342 S.C. 159, 172, 536 S.E.2d 380, 387 (Ct. App. 2000) \r\n    (holding appellant must object on contested ground during trial to preserve \r\n    the ground for appellate review); see also Staubes v. City of Folly \r\n    Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that issues \r\n    not raised and ruled upon by the circuitÂ  court will not be considered on \r\n    appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-060","title":"Butler v.

Sinclair, of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Respondents brought this action \r\n  against Mark Stewart to enforce restrictive covenants prohibiting the commercial \r\n  use of residential property in the LaMotte Shores subdivision of Spartanburg \r\n  County.Â  The master-in-equity found Stewartâ€™s use of the property for business \r\n  purposes violated the restrictive covenants, and Stewart appeals.Â Â  We affirm. \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nThe LaMotte Shores subdivision was established \r\n  in the early 1950s.Â  A plat and restrictive covenants for the subdivision are \r\n  recorded in the Spartanburg County RMC office.Â  Respondents and Stewart all \r\n  own property in the subdivision.Â  Stewart purchased his lot on North Blackstone \r\n  Road in June 2000.Â  \r\nThe restrictive covenants state all of \r\n  the lots are residential and prohibitÂ  any â€œnoxious or offensive tradeâ€ on the \r\n  premises.Â  The covenants provide in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n2.Â  All lots tract [sic] shall be known and described as residential \r\n  lots.Â  No structures shall be erected, altered, placed or permitted to remain \r\n  on any lot, other than one detached single family dwelling not to exceed 2Â½ \r\n  stories high and a private garage for not more than 2 cars and servants[â€™] quarters \r\n  or storage.\r\n. . . .\r\n4.Â  No noxious or offensive trade shall be carried on upon \r\n  any lot; nor shall anything be done thereon which may be or become an annoyance \r\n  to the neighborhood.Â  \r\n\r\nAt the hearing in this matter, Stewart \r\n  admitted that he had converted the residence in North Shores subdivision to \r\n  primarily business use.Â  Stewart operated a real estate business that bought \r\n  properties, renovated them, and then resold them.Â  Stewart testified that on \r\n  an average day, there were three persons, including himself, working on the \r\n  premises, and that he saw a couple of clients there each day.Â  Stewart maintained, \r\n  however, that only five per cent of his business was handled out of the building \r\n  and that he was unaware of the restrictive covenants at the time he purchased \r\n  the lot.Â  Stewart stated he was notified of the covenants by several other landowners \r\n  once they realized he intended to use his property for commercial, rather than \r\n  residential, purposes.Â  Stewart testified that, although he did not reside at \r\n  the property, his brother occasionally used the property when he was in town.Â  \r\n\r\nStewart maintained his business was not \r\n  increasing traffic or causing other problems in the neighborhood, and that it \r\n  was not a noxious or offensive trade as prohibited by the covenants.Â  Additionally, \r\n  he asserted many major businesses now surround the subdivision and these businesses \r\n  have more of an impact upon the neighborhood than his business.Â  Stewartâ€™s property, \r\n  however, is apparently the only one within the subdivision to be used \r\n  almost exclusively for business purposes.Â  \r\nThe master found that the prohibition \r\n  in Paragraph 4 of the covenants against carrying on any â€œnoxious or offensive \r\n  tradeâ€ on the premises â€œwas not intended to change the clear intent of the covenants \r\n  which limit[] these lots to single family residential use.â€Â  The master reasoned \r\n  that â€œ[a] person living in a residence might perform some incidental work related \r\n  to his trade or business.â€Â  The master found the restrictive â€œ[c]ovenants were \r\n  intended to protect the neighborhood from such changes as have occurred outside \r\n  the neighborhood without the benefit of the restrictions.â€Â  The master concluded \r\n  that Stewartâ€™s conversion of his property from a residential lot to a business \r\n  property was in violation of the restrictive covenants and restrained Stewart \r\n  from further use of the property for business purposes. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by \r\n  injunction is in equity.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Resources v. Town \r\n  of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001).Â  â€œOn appeal \r\n  of an equitable action tried by a Master, the Court can find facts in accordance \r\n  with its own view of the evidence.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nStewart contends the master erred in finding \r\n  his use of the property for business purposes violates the subdivisionâ€™s restrictive \r\n  covenants.Â  We disagree.\r\n&nbsp;â€œâ€˜Restrictive covenants are contractual \r\n  in nature,â€™ so that the paramount rule of construction is to ascertain and give \r\n  effect to the intent of the parties as determined from the whole document.â€Â  \r\n  Palmetto Dunes Resort v. Brown, 287 S.C. 1, 6, 336 S.E.2d 15, 18 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1985).\r\nâ€œThe court may not limit a restriction in a deed, \r\n  nor, on the other hand, will a restriction be enlarged or extended by construction \r\n  or implication beyond the clear meaning of its terms even to accomplish what \r\n  it may be thought the parties would have desired had a situation which later \r\n  developed been foreseen by them at the time when the restriction was written.â€Â  \r\n  Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 864 (1998) (quoting \r\n  Forest Land Co. v. Black, 216 S.C. 255, 262, 57 S.E.2d 420, 424 (1950)). \r\n\r\nâ€œIt is still the settled rule in this jurisdiction \r\n  that restrictions as to the use of real estate should be strictly construed \r\n  and all doubts resolved in favor of free use of the property, subject, however, \r\n  to the provision that this rule of strict construction should not be applied \r\n  so as to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the instrument.â€Â  Id. \r\n \r\n\r\nâ€œWords of a restrictive covenant will \r\n  be given the common, ordinary meaning attributed to them at the time of their \r\n  execution.â€Â  Id. at 4, 498 S.E.2d at 863.Â  â€œA restriction on the use \r\n  of property must be created in express terms or by plain and unmistakable implication, \r\n  and all such restrictions are to be strictly construed, with all doubts resolved \r\n  in favor of the free use of property.â€Â  Hamilton v. CCM, Inc., 274 S.C. \r\n  152, 157, 263 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1980) (internal citation omitted).Â  \r\nStewart first argues Paragraph 4 of the \r\n  covenants, which prohibits any â€œnoxious or offensive trade . . . upon any lot,â€ \r\n  contemplates allowing a business to operate within the subdivision so long as \r\n  the business is not noxious or offensive.Â  Stewart asserts that, since his business \r\n  is not noxious or offensive, his commercial use of the property does not violate \r\n  the covenants.Â  \r\nWhen reading the document as a whole, \r\n  however, Paragraph 2 clearly intends to limit the primary use of the lots to \r\n  residential purposes as it states all lots shall be described as residential \r\n  lots and that only single-family dwellings can be maintained within the subdivision.Â  \r\n  Thus, we agree with the masterâ€™s finding that, in construing these two provisions \r\n  together, Paragraph 4 serves to further prohibit a property owner, who is already \r\n  using the lot for residential purposes, from having any noxious or offensive \r\n  trade conducted on the premises.Â  In this case, Stewart admitted that he never \r\n  lived at the home and that he used it for commercial purposes. \r\nStewart next argues that the restrictive \r\n  covenants are invalid or unenforceable because his neighbors have violated the \r\n  covenants.Â  The main violation alleged by Stewart is the presence of a three-car \r\n  garage on one of the lots.Â  At trial, however, the testimony indicated the garage \r\n  was used as a two-car garage, with the third bay used only for storage. Â Paragraph \r\n  2 of the covenants allows â€œa private garage for not more than 2 cars and servants[â€™] \r\n  quarters or storage.â€Â  This is not a significant change in the nature of the \r\n  neighborhood or a violation, however, that would render the covenants no longer \r\n  applicable to all property owners.Â  See, e.g., Sea Pines Plantation \r\n  Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 270-71, 363 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1987) (finding \r\n  restrictive covenants were not arbitrarily applied and were valid and enforceable). \r\nStewart further contends the neighborhood \r\n  has been significantly changed by the surrounding businesses such that the restriction \r\n  as to residential use is no longer valid.Â  While it is true that the area surrounding \r\n  the subdivision includes major companies and businesses, none are located in \r\n  the area covered by the restrictive covenants.Â  The restrictive covenants apply \r\n  solely to the area within the subdivision, and their enforcement is not dependant \r\n  on developments outside the subdivision.Â  We agree with the masterâ€™s observation \r\n  that it is precisely due to the presence of the restrictive covenants that the \r\n  area within the subdivision has been protected from commercial growth, which \r\n  was the purpose of the restrictions.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the masterâ€™s \r\n  decision is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-061","title":"Hiller v.

Summers, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Upon the motion of the \r\n        South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), \r\n        the trial court found Paris Mountain Utilities, Inc. and its officers \r\n        David Hiller and Joe W. Hiller in contempt.Â  The subject matter of this \r\n        action has been before this court previously when Paris Mountain attempted \r\n        to include the Hillers as appellants when it appealed the contempt order.Â  \r\n        We disallowed that effort, finding the notice of appeal did not name the \r\n        Hillers as appellants and Paris Mountain lacked standing to raise issues \r\n        concerning their contempt and personal liability because Paris Mountain \r\n        is separate and distinct from the Hillers. \r\n        [1] Â  DHEC thereafter served the Hillers with the contempt order.Â  \r\n        They now appeal.\r\nFACTS\r\n      On April 24, 1999, Judge Joseph J. Watson ordered \r\n        Paris Mountain Utilities to comply with â€œall provisions of [the] National \r\n        Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit #SC0034398, the Federal \r\n        Water Pollution Control Act, the State Water Pollution Control Permit \r\n        Regulations (S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-9 (1976), as amended), and the provisions \r\n        of Administrative Order 96-110-WP.â€Â  He also awarded judgment against \r\n        Paris Mountain in the amount of $39,750 for a civil penalty assessed by \r\n        DHEC against Paris Mountain in an unappealed administrative order.Â  \r\n      When Paris Mountain failed to comply with Judge \r\n        Watsonâ€™s order, DHEC sought an order seeking to have Paris Mountain and \r\n        its officers held in contempt.Â  Following a hearing, the trial court held \r\n        Paris Mountain and the Hillers in contempt and imposed a civil penalty \r\n        in the amount of $39,750 upon the Hillers in their individual capacities.Â  \r\n        The trial court also sentenced the Hillers to an indefinite term of imprisonment \r\n        in the event the civil penalty went unsatisfied. To reach the Hillers, \r\n        the trial court disregarded the corporate shield that protected the Hillers \r\n        from individual liability for corporate liabilities by piercing the corporate \r\n        veil.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n      1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The trial court committed no reversible \r\n        error in allowing testimony regarding the piercing of Paris Mountainâ€™s \r\n        corporate veil and in subsequently ordering that the veil be pierced, \r\n        thus holding the Hillers personally liable for Paris Mountainâ€™s contempt, \r\n        despite the fact that DHECâ€™s motion did not request piercing of the corporate \r\n        veil.Â  Both men had sufficient notice that DHEC would attempt to hold \r\n        each of them liable for the corporationâ€™s disobedience of Judge Watsonâ€™s \r\n        order.Â  The motion filed by DHEC expressly stated that it would â€œmove \r\n        the court for an order declaring Paris Mountain Utilities, Inc., and \r\n        its officers in . . . contempt for disregarding the order of the Honorable \r\n        Joseph Watson issued August 24, 1999.â€ [Emphasis added.]Â  Even though \r\n        Judge Watsonâ€™s order was addressed solely to Paris Mountain, its officers \r\n        were also subject to contempt for disobedience of its terms. \r\n        [2] Â  Moreover, since Paris Mountain was capable of violating \r\n        Judge Watsonâ€™s order only if its agents either acted or refrained from \r\n        acting, â€œit follows that the order directed at the corporation [was] binding \r\n        on agents authorized to act on its behalf, whether specifically named \r\n        in the order or not.â€ [3] \r\n      2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The trial court committed no reversible \r\n        error in allowing evidence regarding events that occurred prior to August \r\n        24, 1999 when the issue before the court during the January 5, 2000 hearing \r\n        was whether the corporation and its officers had violated Judge Watsonâ€™s \r\n        order.Â  â€œConduct of a trial, including admission and rejection of [evidence], \r\n        is largely within the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion, the exercise of \r\n        which will not be disturbed on appeal unless appellant can show abuse \r\n        of such discretion, commission of legal error in its exercise, and resulting \r\n        prejudice to appellantâ€™s rights.â€ \r\n        [4] Â  â€œThe trial judge is given broad discretion in ruling on \r\n        questions concerning the relevancy of evidence, and his decision will \r\n        be reversed only if there is a clear abuse of discretion.â€ [5] Â  The Hillers failed to demonstrate \r\n        the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the questioned evidence \r\n        and determining the evidence was relevant.Â  Additionally, the Hillers \r\n        did not prove the courtâ€™s actions prejudiced them unfairly.Â  The trial \r\n        court viewed the evidence as â€œrelevant as background information.â€Â  We \r\n        cannot fault it for viewing it in that way.Â  \r\n      Furthermore, some of the challenged evidence \r\n        that related to matters occurring prior to Judge Watsonâ€™s August 24, 1999 \r\n        order suggested a pattern of neglect by the corporation of its legal obligations. \r\n        [6] \r\n      3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We hold the evidence, though admittedly \r\n        slight, and its reasonable inferences support the trial courtâ€™s finding \r\n        that the Hillers were officers of the corporation at the critical time.Â  \r\n        Judge Watsonâ€™s unappealed order of default, which upholds service upon \r\n        David Hiller, refers to him as president of the corporation and an affidavit \r\n        of service of the order of default upon David Hiller lists him as president \r\n        of Paris Mountain Utilities.Â  Although a letter dated September 9, 1999 \r\n        addressed to Kelly Lowry states he no longer serves as president of the \r\n        corporation because it â€œdoes not exist,â€ the corporation had only been \r\n        administratively dissolved by the secretary of state pursuant to S.C. \r\n        Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-200 (Supp. 2003) Â for \r\n        failing to make required reports or pay taxes.Â  Under S.C. Code \r\n        Ann. Â§ 33-14-210(d) (1990) , the corporation, \r\n        and hence its officers and agents, continued to exist, albeit for limited \r\n        purposes.Â  Joe W. Hiller is also listed on the articles of incorporation \r\n        as one of the Paris Mountainâ€™s incorporators, but, more importantly, he \r\n        wrote a letter on May 25, 1999, just a few months before the date of Judge \r\n        Watsonâ€™s order, addressed to Altamont Forest residents threatening to \r\n        shut down the treatment plant if anyone took legal action or if anyone \r\n        failed to make a timely financial contribution to the treatment system, \r\n        a threat that only someone authorized to act on the behalf of the corporation \r\n        could legitimately make.Â  \r\n      Significantly, other than the letter to Lowry, \r\n        there is no evidence that David Hiller and Joe W. Hiller were not officers \r\n        and agents of the corporation on the critical date.Â  Neither of the Hillers \r\n        produced any evidence that weaken the prima facie case made \r\n        by DHEC that they were. \r\n        [7]   \r\n      Finally, if a corporation continues to operate \r\n        as such after its administrative dissolution, those persons operating \r\n        the business become personally liable for its obligations. \r\n        [8] Â The record contains evidence the corporation \r\n        continued its operations beyond October 26, 1996, with Joe W. Hiller sending \r\n        out bills for sewer service to Altamont Forest residents on May 25, 1999 \r\n        and David Hiller receiving laboratory reports on March 21, 1997.Â  \r\n      \r\n      4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We need not address the question \r\n        of whether the trial court erred in making eleven findings of fact.Â  \r\n        This court previously affirmed these same findings in South Carolina \r\n        Department of Health and Environmental Control v. Paris Mountain Utilities, \r\n        Inc., [9]  finding nine of them supported by \r\n        the record or by an unappealed administrative order.Â  The other two findings, \r\n        though not supported by the evidence, were found not to be prejudicial. \r\n      \r\n      We are bound by that decision. \r\n        [10] Â  The Hillers stand in privity with Paris Mountain Utilities, \r\n        a party to the prior proceedings that involved the same litigation as \r\n        that with which we are involved here.\r\n      In any case, we reiterate the conclusions \r\n        reached in the prior proceedings and hold as did the panel in that case.\r\n      5.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We also need not address the question \r\n        of whether the trial court erred in appointing a receiver because it contained \r\n        findings of fact outside the record and granted relief beyond the scope \r\n        of DHECâ€™s motion.Â  Again, the previous panel determined this issue with \r\n        finality and we agree with the panelâ€™s conclusions in both regards.\r\n      6.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We do not address the constitutional \r\n        question of whether the trial court erred in ordering imprisonment for \r\n        the payment of a debt.Â  It was neither raised to nor passed upon by the \r\n        trial court.

Thayer Rivers, Jr., of Ridgeland, for Appellant.\r\nDavid S. Black, of Beaufort and J. Ray Westmorland, of Hilton Head Island, for \r\n  Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Herman Blake brought this action \r\n  against the Beaufort County Treasurer and Yvonne Wilson seeking to set aside \r\n  a tax sale of his property due to the county treasurerâ€™s failure to divide the \r\n  property as prescribed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40 (Supp. 2003) .Â  During trial, Blake sought to amend his complaint \r\n  to conform to the proof that he had redeemed the property pursuant to S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 12-51-90. [1] Â  The trial \r\n  court denied his motion and found the statute of limitations contained in S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-160 (2000) barred the claim asserted under section 12-51-40.Â  \r\n  Blake now appeals.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1972, Blake purchased 3.7 acres of land on Daufuskie \r\n  Island in Beaufort County.Â  In 1993, he failed to pay his Beaufort County property \r\n  taxes.Â  To satisfy this delinquent tax obligation, the Beaufort County Treasurer \r\n  sold two acres of Blakeâ€™s property at a public tax sale held on February 6, \r\n  1995.Â  The highest bidder for the property was Wilson, who bid and paid $27.27 \r\n  for the two-acre parcel.Â  The deed to Wilson was recorded on May 1, 1996.Â  \r\nOn October 30, 1998, Blake commenced this action in \r\n  an effort to set aside the tax sale deed issued to Wilson.Â  His complaint contained \r\n  the single allegation that the sale violated South Carolina Code section 12-51-40 \r\n  Â because the County only needed to sell a small portion of the property to satisfy \r\n  the delinquent tax bills. \r\nAt trial, Blake sought to amend his complaint to \r\n  conform to the evidence.Â  Blake argued that proof had been placed into evidence \r\n  that tended to show he had properly redeemed the property prior to the expiration \r\n  of his statutorily prescribed right of redemption. \r\nThe question of whether Blake had redeemed the \r\n  property was raised early on at trial.Â  On direct examination, Blake testified \r\n  he thought he had paid the taxes for 1993, specifically referring to a letter \r\n  he received from the county treasurer dated February 6, 1996 indicating he had \r\n  paid his taxes. \r\nOn cross-examination, defense counsel pressed Blake \r\n  further on whether he was claiming he had paid the delinquent taxes or had timely \r\n  redeemed title to the property.Â  After further questioning, Blake produced a \r\n  copy of the February 6, 1996 letter he received from the county treasurer.Â  \r\n  He maintained it contained the check he originally sent to the county treasurer \r\n  to redeem title to the property.Â  This letter was ultimately admitted into evidence \r\n  without objection by defense counsel.\r\nLater in his testimony, Blake also produced a copy \r\n  of the letter dated December 22, 1995 and sent to him by the county treasurer.Â  \r\n  The letter advised Blake that his property had been sold and informed him of \r\n  his right to redeem by sending $53.99 to the treasurer by February 1, 1996.Â  \r\n  Blake also produced a cashierâ€™s check dated February 1, 1996.Â  It was drawn \r\n  as payable to the county treasurer in the amount of $53.99.\r\nBlakeâ€™s counselâ€™s subsequent request to admit the \r\n  December 22, 1995 letter along with the cashierâ€™s check was met with objection \r\n  by defense counsel.Â  The following exchange ensued:\r\n\r\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Â Iâ€™m \r\n  going to object on that, Your Honor.Â  What we now have is testimony about whether \r\n  heâ€™s paid taxes or not and I suppose I kind of opened the door on that, but \r\n  really the issue here is whether this was an excessive sale.Â  In other words, \r\n  the issue is whether Beaufort County sold too much of the property not whether \r\n  heâ€™s made payment and this shouldnâ€™t have happened altogether at all.\r\nCOURT:Â  Right\r\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thatâ€™s \r\n  not the allegations in the complaint and so Iâ€™m going to object to that.\r\nCOURT:Â  What about that?\r\n[BLAKEâ€™S COUNSEL]:Â  Well, \r\n  as [Defense Counsel] candidly said, Your Honor, he opened the door to that.Â  \r\n  And Mr. Blake has now shown he actually had paid the delinquent tax sale monies \r\n  so Iâ€™m probably going to move to amend the complaint to reflect the proof proffered.Â  \r\n  Because heâ€™s the one that asked about it, not me.Â  Iâ€™m not sure he has a leg \r\n  to stand on if he wants to object to it.\r\nCOURT:Â  The thing of it \r\n  is, youâ€™ve got another lawsuit now.Â  And I would not deny you the right to amend \r\n  but I would not make him go forward at this time without an opportunity to look \r\n  into that question.\r\n\r\nThe trial court held in abeyance its decision regarding \r\n  the motion to amend until the conclusion of the trial.\r\nAs further grounds in support of his motion to \r\n  amend, Blake asserted he had noted in his supplemental responses to Wilsonâ€™s \r\n  request for production that he intended to admit the February 6, 1996 letter \r\n  from the county treasurer in evidence.Â  This response, Blake argued, was sufficient \r\n  to put the respondents on notice that he would claim that he had properly redeemed \r\n  the subject property.\r\nThe trial court denied Blakeâ€™s motion to amend, \r\n  opining that:\r\n\r\nIf [Blake] truly believed that \r\n  the tax deed should be set aside because he had previously paid the taxes necessary \r\n  to redeem the property, then [Blake] should have put those allegations in his \r\n  pleadings and should not save that testimony for trial with the prospect of \r\n  then having evidence that the other parties were not prepared to defend against. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to Blakeâ€™s original cause of action, \r\n  the trial court found the county treasurer complied fully with South Carolina \r\n  Code section 12-51-40 Â in dividing the property \r\n  for purposes of the tax sale.Â  As an alternative ruling, the trial court \r\n  also found that Blake had failed to bring his action within the applicable two-year \r\n  statute of limitations prescribed by South Carolina Code section 12-51-160.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to set aside a tax deed is in equity.Â  \r\n  Godfrey v. Webb, 277 S.C. 246, 247, 285 S.E.2d 883, 884 (1982) . \r\n  Accordingly, â€œ[w]e may review the evidence to determine facts in accordance \r\n  with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Tiger, Inc. v. \r\n  Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1990) .Â  \r\n  Though we are permitted a broad scope of review, â€œwe do not disregard the findings \r\n  of the Master, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate their credibility.â€Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Motion to Amend Complaint\r\nUnder Rule 15, SCRCP, the trial court \r\n  may allow the pleadings to be amended to conform to the evidence presented â€œand \r\n  shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be \r\n  subserved thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the \r\n  admission of such evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or \r\n  defense upon the merits.â€ Rule 15(b), SCRCP.Â  A motion to amend the pleadings \r\n  is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Our courts, however, \r\n  have consistently held that â€œ[a]mendments to conform to the proof should be \r\n  liberally allowed when no prejudice to the opposing party will result.â€Â  Harvey \r\n  v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 313, 566 S.E.2d 529, 535 (2002) .Â  \r\n  â€œPrejudice occurs when the amendment states a new claim or defense that would \r\n  require the opposing party to introduce additional or different evidence to \r\n  prevail in the amended action.â€Â  Ball v. Canadian Am. Exp. Co., Inc., \r\n  314 S.C. 272, 275, 442 S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App. 1994) ; \r\n  see also 61B Am. Jur. 2d Pleading Â§ 827 (1999) Â (noting \r\n  that â€œ[t]he test of prejudice in this situation is whether the opposing party \r\n  had a fair opportunity to defend and whether he could offer any additional evidence \r\n  if the case were to be retried on a different theory.â€).\r\nIn this case, we find the trial court \r\n  erred in denying Blakeâ€™s motion to amend. As described above, a significant \r\n  amount of testimony presented at trial centered upon the question of whether \r\n  Blake had properly redeemed title to the property.Â  Both Blakeâ€™s lawyer and \r\n  defense counsel questioned Blake and others on this subject.Â  On the stand, \r\n  Blake produced several critical pieces of evidence in this regard: the December \r\n  22, 1995 letter from the county treasurer informing Blake of his right to redeem \r\n  the property by tendering payment of $53.99; the February 6, 1996 letter from \r\n  the county treasurer informing Blake that his taxes were paid and returning \r\n  his check; and the check itself.Â  The February 6, 1996 letter was admitted into \r\n  evidence with no objection by defense counsel.\r\nFurthermore, we find the respondents have \r\n  failed to demonstrate allowing the amendment would have resulted in prejudice.Â  \r\n  Respondents point to no further testimony or documentary evidence that would \r\n  be necessary to try Blakeâ€™s redemption claim on its merits.Â  Indeed, the record \r\n  reveals that the defense was able to directly rebut Blakeâ€™s own testimony and \r\n  evidence that he had redeemed the property with the testimony of Herschel J. \r\n  Evans, Jr., the Deputy Treasurer of Beaufort County.Â  Defense counsel asked \r\n  Evans: â€œDo your records show that there was any payment of either taxes or the \r\n  redemption for what would have been charged on the property for the tax year \r\n  1993?â€Â  Evans responded: â€œMy records do not indicate any payment of the taxes \r\n  or the redemption for tax year 1993.â€ (Emphasis added.)Â  \r\nWe conclude, therefore, that the respondents failed \r\n  to meet their burden of showing that prejudice would have resulted had the amendment \r\n  been allowed.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Propriety of the \r\n  Tax Sale Under Section 12-51-40\r\nBlake argues the trial \r\n  court erred by finding his claim under South Carolina Code section 12-51-40 \r\n  was barred by the two-year statute of limitations.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 12-51-160 Â provides that:\r\n\r\nIn all cases of tax sale the \r\n  deed of conveyance, whether executed to a private person, a corporation, or \r\n  a forfeited land commission, must be held and taken as prima facie evidence \r\n  of a good title in the holder, that all proceedings have been regular and that \r\n  all legal requirements have been complied with. No action for the recovery \r\n  of land sold under the provisions of this chapter or for the recovery of the \r\n  possession may be maintained unless brought within two years from the date of \r\n  sale.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.) \r\nAs noted above, the tax sale \r\n  in the present case occurred on February 6, 1995.Â  Blake did not file his complaint \r\n  until October 30, 1998, more than one and a half years after the statute of \r\n  limitation had expired.Â  Even if we applied the statute from the time the tax \r\n  sale deed was recordedâ€”May 1, 1996â€”Blakeâ€™s action was commenced beyond the two-year \r\n  limitation.Â  Blakeâ€™s cause of action under section 12-51-40 is, therefore, barred.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe therefore conclude Blakeâ€™s \r\n  motion to amend his complaint to conform to the evidence that showed he, pursuant \r\n  to section 12-51-90, properly redeemed the property should have been allowed \r\n  under Rule 15(b), SCRCP.Â  We also conclude the trial court correctly held Blakeâ€™s \r\n  claim under section 12-51-40 was barred by the statute of limitations contained \r\n  in section 12-51-160.Â  We express no opinion, however, regarding the claim of \r\n  redemption, including the question of whether the claim is now barred.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and KITTREDGE, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  See Act No. 166, 1985 S.C.
