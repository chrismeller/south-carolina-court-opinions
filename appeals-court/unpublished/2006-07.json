Corbin, of Florence, for Appellant.\r\nRobert J. Thomas, Â of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this tort action, James F. Evans appeals from the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Melony A. Cusack under the family purpose doctrine.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nEvans brought this action against Blake C. Stewart and Blakeâ€™s mother, Cusack, seeking damages arising from an automobile accident.Â  Evans was a passenger in a car driven by Stewart when Stewart fell asleep at the wheel, causing a head-on collision with another car.Â  At the time of the accident, Stewart, Evans and another friend were returning from a two day trip to the beach for spring break.Â  Evans filed a complaint against Stewart and Cusack seeking damages from Stewart based on Stewartâ€™s negligence and damages from Cusack based on the family purpose doctrine and negligent entrustment.Â  Cusack moved for summary judgment asserting there was no genuine issue of material fact and she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  \r\nAt a hearing on the matter, the parties submitted the deposition of Stewart.Â  Stewart testified that at the time of the accident, he was eighteen years old and had moved out of his motherâ€™s home two to three months prior to the accident.Â  Stewart was working full time and was sharing a house with two roommates, paying approximately $150 a month in rent.Â  He was entirely self-supporting.Â  Stewart had moved out of his motherâ€™s home because he could not get along with his stepfather.Â  Although he did move back in with his mother following the accident because he needed someone to take care of him, it was not his intention to return to her home after he moved.Â  The truck Stewart was driving at the time of the accident was purchased by Stewart for a total of $1,200, with $1,000 from money he had in savings and $200 from his stepfather.Â  Because Stewart was only seventeen at the time of purchase, the car was registered in Cusackâ€™s name.Â  Cusack also paid Stewartâ€™s insurance until Stewart â€œcould get on [his] feet.â€Â  Stewart testified he drove the truck mostly and considered it his truck, and that he paid for gas and the maintenance of the truck.Â  The truck stayed in Stewartâ€™s possession, he drove it to and from work, and he used it for recreational purposes.Â  When the accident occurred, Stewart did not feel he needed to ask his motherâ€™s permission to take the vehicle to the beach, and she did not know that he had gone on the trip.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Cusack submitted her affidavit in which she swore, although the truck in question was titled in her name, she was not the true owner; that she and her husband gave Stewart $200 toward the purchase of the automobile but that Stewart used $1,000 of his own money to buy the truck; Stewart was still a minor at the time of purchase and the truck was therefore registered in her name; Stewart was responsible for all costs and expenses involved in operating the truck; Stewart was the sole user of the truck and he kept it for his own pleasure and convenience; and at the time of the accident, she had no control over Stewartâ€™s use of the truck and had no knowledge of his trip to the beach.Â  \r\nThe trial judge noted that Stewart did not live with Cusack, he was self-supporting, the truck was kept at Stewartâ€™s residence and was in his sole possession, Stewart paid the insurance, maintenance and gas for the vehicle, and at the time of the accident, Stewart was on his way back from a beach trip of which Cusack had no knowledge.Â  He found Evans had not presented any evidence to contradict the testimony of Stewart or the affidavit of Cusack, and thus found there was no basis to support Cusackâ€™s liability under the family purpose doctrine and Cusack was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  He further determined there was no basis to support a claim for negligent entrustment as there was no evidence Cusack had control over the truck, nor any evidence that Stewart was addicted to intoxicants or had the habit of drinking or drove while intoxicated.Â  Accordingly, he also found Cusack was entitled to summary judgment on the negligent entrustment cause of action as well.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  â€œA motion for summary judgment shall be granted â€˜if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€™â€Â \r\nId. Â (quoting Rule 56(c), SCRCP). When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Â Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  In determining whether a genuine issue of fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).Â  It is not sufficient for one to create an inference that is not reasonable or an issue of fact that is not genuine.Â  Durkin v. Hansen, 313 S.C. 343, 346, 437 S.E.2d 550, 552 (Ct. App. 1993). Â Although summary judgment is a drastic remedy which should be cautiously invoked, where a verdict is not reasonably possible under the facts presented, summary judgment is proper.Â  Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 425, 529 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2000).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEvans contends the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment to Cusack under the family purpose doctrine.Â  He asserts there were genuine issues of fact in dispute relating to ownership, control, and use of the vehicle such that summary judgment was inappropriate.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œUnder the family purpose doctrine, the head of a family who owns, furnishes, and maintains a vehicle for the general use and convenience of his family is liable for the negligence of a family member having general authority to operate the vehicle for such a purpose.â€Â  Thompson v. Michael, 315 S.C. 268, 272, 433 S.E.2d 853, 855 (1993).Â  The doctrine has its genesis in the law of agency, and it will impose liability on a parent when a child is acting as his agent.Â  Id.Â  Thus, â€œone â€˜who has made it his business to furnish a car for the use of his family is liable as principal or master when such business is being carried out by a family member using the vehicle for its intended purpose, the family member thereby filling the role of agent or servant.â€™â€Â  Campbell v. Paschal, 290 S.C. 1, 8, 347 S.E.2d 892, 897 (Ct. App. 1986) (quoting 8 A.L.R.3d 1191 at 1196 (1966)).Â  Even if a parent owns the car, it must be determined whether the parent provided the car for the general use and convenience of the family, and if the car was not provided for the general use and convenience of the family, there is no relationship of principal and agent at the time of the wreck to impose liability on the parent.Â  Thompson, 315 S.C. at 273, 433 S.E.2d at 855.Â  Further, while the applicability of the family purpose doctrine is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury, where no factual issue is created the question becomes one of law, properly decided by the trial judge.Â  Lucht v. Youngblood, 266 S.C. 127, 133, 221 S.E.2d 854, 857 (1976). \r\nEvans points to Stewartâ€™s deposition testimony in arguing genuine issues of fact exist. He asserts Stewart testified that while he drove the truck, it was titled in Cusackâ€™s name, and Stewart received no insurance proceeds from the loss of the vehicle.Â  He also notes Stewart stated that Cusack could have driven the truck if she wanted to and she controlled who drove the truck, and that if Cusack had needed the truck to haul something somewhere, she could have used it.Â  Finally, he asserts Stewartâ€™s testimony that Cusack had instructed him to bring the truck back to her once or twice while he lived away from home was evidence of her continued control of the use of the truck after he moved out of her home.Â  \r\nA review of Stewartâ€™s deposition reveals that, while the truck was titled in Cusackâ€™s name, Stewart provided the bulk of the funds to purchase the vehicle, he paid for the maintenance of the vehicle, the truck was titled in his motherâ€™s name merely because Stewart was a minor at the time of purchase, and Stewart considered the truck to be his.Â  As to insurance proceeds from the totaled truck, while Stewart testified he did not receive anything for it, neither did he know if his mother received anything for it.Â  Stewartâ€™s testimony regarding the use of the truck by others reveals only that Cusack or her husband would have been allowed to use the truck if they had the need, as Stewart, â€œwouldnâ€™t tell [his] mom she couldnâ€™t use the truck,â€ and would not tell his stepfather he could not use the truck because he â€œrespect[ed] him too.â€Â  Finally, concerning Cusackâ€™s directive that he return the truck to her home after Stewart moved out, the deposition testimony shows only that â€œmaybe once or twiceâ€ Cusack instructed Stewart to bring the vehicle back to her when the two had argued, however, the truck was not in fact taken to Cusack on those occasions, but remained in Stewartâ€™s possession.Â  \r\nEven if we were to assume Cusack â€œownedâ€ the vehicle since it was titled in her name, ownership alone is insufficient. There must also be evidence Cusack furnished and maintained the vehicle for the general use and convenience of her family.Â  If the car was not provided for the general use and convenience of her family, there is no relationship of principal and agent at the time of the wreck to impose liability on Cusack.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Evans, there is simply no evidence Cusack furnished and maintained the truck for the general use and convenience of her family such that she is liable as principal or master for Stewartâ€™s use of the vehicle as her agent or servant.Â Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order granting Cusack summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-307","title":"State v.

Adams, of Anderson; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tony Dale Baldwin was convicted of two counts of committing a lewd act on a minor.Â  He was sentenced on each count to concurrent terms of fifteen years imprisonment, suspended upon the service of eight years with five years probation.Â  Baldwin appeals, asserting the trial judge erred in failing to direct a verdict of acquittal.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe record shows that Rachel, the mother of Peter and George, knew Baldwin from High School, and became reacquainted with him after moving back to Belton, South Carolina.[2]Â  Rachel testified that she was friends with Baldwin and, one day when she did not have a baby-sitter, Baldwin offered to watch the boys.Â  From November 2001 through February 2002, when the boys were not with their father or his family on a Saturday, Rachel would often leave Peter and George in Baldwinâ€™s care while she worked.Â  The boys would usually arrive at Baldwinâ€™s home on Friday evening and spend the night, since Rachel would often have to be at work early on Saturday mornings.Â  Sometimes Rachel would also spend the night at Baldwinâ€™s before leaving for work the next morning, and sometimes she would not.Â  Rachel denied that she dated Baldwin, stating they only had a friendship and no romantic involvement.Â  \r\nShortly after late January or early February, her older son, George, began â€œacting funnyâ€ and did not want to go over to Baldwinâ€™s house.Â  When Rachel questioned him, George told her about something that happened at Baldwinâ€™s home.Â  Peter was present during this conversation but did not say anything.Â  Rachel later decided to ask Peter if â€œit also happen[ed] to himâ€ before she called the Sheriffâ€™s office, and Peter confirmed that it had.Â  \r\nPeter, who was twelve years old at the time of trial and had turned ten during the time period of the alleged incidents, testified that he knew Baldwin as one of his motherâ€™s friends.Â  He stated he spent time at Baldwinâ€™s house, with only Baldwin and his brother present, when his mother had to work.Â  They went over to Baldwinâ€™s house â€œa lot,â€ were alone with him â€œa lot,â€ and would spend the night at his home.Â  Sometimes, he and his brother would stay with relatives in Georgia and return from there to Baldwinâ€™s house.Â  When they went to his home from Georgia, Baldwin would put the boysâ€™ bags beside the washing machine, say that he smelled kerosene on their clothes from the relativesâ€™ kerosene heater, and put all of the boysâ€™ clothes in the washing machine.Â  Peter testified he and George would smell their clothes, but they did not smell like kerosene.Â  Baldwin would take the clothes the boys had on at the time as well, and give them a t-shirt to wear.Â  He did not give them anything else to wear on these occasions, and the boys wore nothing else but the t-shirts.Â  Peter testified, that after Baldwin gave them the t-shirts to wear, he, his brother, and Baldwin would start wrestling.Â  Baldwin would then touch them â€œin our place we donâ€™t want to be touched.â€Â  Peter clarified that Baldwin would touch their â€œwieners.â€Â  Baldwin touched Peter like this more than once.Â  Peter also observed Baldwin touch George in the same place while George was wearing a t-shirt with nothing under it.Â  When Baldwin would touch him, Peter â€œbacked off, and [Baldwin] acted like he didnâ€™t even know he touched [them].â€Â  \r\nGeorge, who was fourteen at the time of trial and had turned twelve during the time period in question, testified that Baldwin used to baby-sit them in his home while their mother worked.Â  The boys would go to his house every other weekend and would stay overnight, sometimes with his mother staying there too.Â  Almost every time they went to Baldwinâ€™s home, they would be alone with Baldwin.Â  According to George, at the times his mother would go to work, Baldwin would â€œtouchâ€ the boys â€œin [their] private parts.â€Â  George stated Baldwin â€œwould just grab us and we would try to push him off or something,â€ but that Baldwin â€œjust acted like he never done anything wrong.â€Â  When Baldwin touched him in this manner, George would only be wearing a t-shirt and nothing else.Â  He would wear the t-shirt because Baldwin would take his and Peterâ€™s clothes and throw them in the washing machine.Â  Just before Baldwin would touch him, they would be wrestling.Â  When George told Baldwin not to touch him, Baldwin â€œwould back off, and then a few minutes later he would do the same thing.â€Â  George further testified that they would take clean clothes to Baldwinâ€™s house, and that it did not matter whether the clothes were clean or dirty as Baldwin would throw all of the clothes in the washing machine.Â  While he stated the clothes could have smelled like kerosene, he did not notice the odor on them.Â  \r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Baldwin moved for a directed verdict.Â  He argued that â€œa simple touching during a wrestling matchâ€ did not rise to the level of a lewd or lascivious act, and there was no evidence that his actions were with the intent of gratifying the lust, passion, or sexual desires of him or the children.Â  The trial court found there was sufficient evidence warranting submission to the jury and denied Baldwinâ€™s motion.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Baldwin contends the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for directed verdict asserting there was insufficient evidence of his guilt.Â  He argues, at most, the evidence shows he wilfully grabbed the boysâ€™ crotches while roughhousing, and there was no evidence the roughhousing was lewd or lascivious, or that the roughhousing was done with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying his or the childrenâ€™s lust, passions or sexual desires.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe first note this issue may not be properly preserved for our review.Â Â  While Baldwin did make a motion for directed verdict at the close of the Stateâ€™s case, the record reveals Baldwin thereafter presented two witnesses on his behalf.Â  The record before us, however, does not contain the entire portion of the transcript immediately after the conclusion of all the testimony, and does not show whether Baldwin renewed his motion at the close of all the evidence.Â  See State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 135, 620 S.E.2d 737, 742 (2005) (holding the appellant has the burden of providing the appellate court with a sufficient record for review); State v. Adams, 332 S.C. 139, 144-45, 504 S.E.2d 124, 126-27 (Ct. App. 1998) (finding a directed verdict motion was not preserved for appellate review where the precise argument raised on appeal was not presented to the trial court, and, moreover, the record did not reflect the defendant renewed the motion at the close of his case) (emphasis added); State v. Harry, 321 S.C. 273, 277, 468 S.E.2d 76, 79 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œA motion for a directed verdict made at the close of the [stateâ€™s] case is not sufficient to preserve error unless renewed at the close of all the evidence, because once the defense has come forward with its proof, the propriety of a directed verdict can only be tested in terms of all the evidence.â€) (alteration in original) (citation omitted).\r\nEven if we assume that Baldwin renewed his motion and properly preserved the issue for review, we nonetheless find no error.Â  When ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Paris, 363 S.C. 477, 481, 611 S.E.2d 501, 502-03 (2005).Â  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a suspicion of guilt or when the State fails to present evidence on a material element of the offense charged.Â  State v. Brown, 360 S.C. 581, 586, 602 S.E.2d 392, 395 (2004).Â  However, if the State presents any evidence which reasonably tends to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt or from which his guilt could be fairly and logically deduced, the trial court must send the case to the jury. Â Id. Â On appeal from the denial of a motion for directed verdict, the appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  Paris, 363 S.C. at 481, 611 S.E.2d at 503.Â  This court may reverse the trial courtâ€™s denial of the motion only if there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  State v. Lindsey, 355 S.C. 15, 20, 583 S.E.2d 740, 742 (2003).\r\nBaldwin was charged with two counts of committing a lewd act upon a child, a violation of section 16-15-140 of the South Carolina Code, which provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\nIt is unlawful for a person over the age of fourteen years to wilfully and lewdly commit or attempt a lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body, or its parts, of a child under the age of sixteen years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of the person or of the child.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-140 (2003).Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, it is clear there was evidence presented that reasonably tended to prove Baldwinâ€™s guilt, or from which his guilt could be fairly and logically deduced.Â  The boys both testified Baldwin would take all their clothes and wash them, whether the clothes were dirty or clean, and provide them with only t-shirts to wear.Â  He then touched or grabbed their penises or private parts while they wore only the t-shirts, and that he did this on more than one occasion.Â  Additionally, they testified, when they would try to push him off or they would back away, Baldwin would act as if he had done nothing wrong.Â  Yet, when George told him not to touch him, a few minutes later Baldwin would do the same thing.Â  Thus, there is clearly evidence Baldwin willfully and lewdly committed or attempted to commit a lewd or lascivious act.Â  Further, we find there is sufficient evidence from which Baldwinâ€™s intent may be inferred from the facts and circumstances.Â  SeeÂ  State v. Carroll, 277 S.C. 306, 308, 286 S.E.2d 382, 383 (1982) (â€œIntent is seldom susceptible to proof by direct evidence and must ordinarily be proved by circumstantial evidence, that is, by facts and circumstances from which intent may be inferred.â€).Â  Accordingly, we find the trial judge properly denied Baldwinâ€™s motion for directed verdict.\r\nBased on the foregoing, Baldwinâ€™s convictions are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Because of the sensitive nature of this case, the victimsâ€™ names and that of their mother have been changed in this opinion to protect their identities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-308","title":"HRFH v.

Allen Howell appeal from the juryâ€™s verdict in favor of HRFH, LLC.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHRFH employed the services of Foothills Real Estate, the Windsor/Aughtry Company, and agent Charles Reyner, Jr., (collectively, real estate agencies and agent) to locate a tenant for its soon-to-be renovated historic building in downtown Greenville.Â  The real estate agencies and agent located PEI.Â  On October 26, 2000, PEI entered into a ten-year lease with HRFH for the first floor and basement of the building to open a fine dining restaurant to be called the Vault.Â  PEIâ€™s president, Pourlos, and financial officer, Howell, signed a personal guarantee for the obligations of PEI under the lease.Â  The term of the lease was to commence January 1, 2001, and PEI was required to pay two monthâ€™s rent in advance.Â  The lease provided that rent would then commence forty-five days after the space was delivered for PEIâ€™s upfits for the restaurant.Â  An addendum to the lease provided that HRFH would be responsible for certain renovations prior to delivering the space to PEI and that PEI was responsible for installing the remaining walls, furniture, fixtures, and kitchen infrastructure necessary for the restaurant.Â Â  \r\nTo enable PEI to open the Vault by the end of March 2001, the parties agreed PEI could contract with the same construction firm hired by HRFH to perform demolition and upbuilding on the building, Raby Construction.Â  Thus, HRFHâ€™s upbuilding and PEIâ€™s upfits could be performed simultaneously.Â  However, HRFHâ€™s construction was delayed while PEI sought plans and permits to upfit the space for the restaurant.Â  PEI also requested several changes to the building, including moving the proposed location of the bathrooms and changing the floors, that required additional delay.Â  PEI finally obtained architectural plans on January 2, 2001, which were not approved by DHEC until February 1, 2001.Â  Although it would have taken another thirty days to obtain a permit before construction could begin from that point, Pourlos never directed Raby Construction to proceed.Â  In addition to the construction delays, the chef hired to create the menu and cook at the Vault quit.Â  Throughout this time period, Pourlos and Howell sought additional investors for PEI.Â  \r\nPEI alleged that HRFH breached the lease by not delivering the renovated space for their upfits by January 1, 2001.Â  On February 7, 2001, Pourlosâ€™s attorney sent a request to HRFH for $139,000 to release HRFH from any further liability for breaching the lease.Â  After requesting further assurances from PEI and being informed that Pourlos wanted to get out of the lease, HRFH sent Pourlos a letter on April 12, 2001, indicating the premises would not be delivered to PEI because it had breached the agreement in numerous respects, including:Â  Howellâ€™s failure to provide financial disclosures; Pourlosâ€™s express repudiation of the lease; Pourlosâ€™s actions that amounted to purposeful delay of the renovations of the building; and PEIâ€™s subletting of the space to Fovos, Inc., without approval of HRFH.Â  Â \r\nHRFH filed the underlying lawsuit for, among other claims, breach of contract against PEI, Pourlos, Howell, and the real estate agencies and agent.Â  PEI, Pourlos, and Howell counterclaimed, alleging breach of contract, fraud, and equitable indemnity.Â  The real estate agencies and agent were eventually dismissed from the action.Â  A trial was held in June 2004.Â  After the presentation of all of the evidence, both parties moved for a directed verdict.Â  The trial judge directed a verdict for PEI, Pourlos, and Howell (collectively, Appellants) on HRFHâ€™s claim for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  The judge also directed a verdict for HRFH on Appellantsâ€™ claims of fraud, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and equitable indemnity.Â  Both partiesâ€™ claims of breach of contract went to the jury.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of HRFH in the amount of $190,000 on its breach of contract claim and also found in favor of HRFH on Appellantsâ€™ breach of contract claim.Â  The trial judge denied Appellantsâ€™ post-trial motions.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Breach of Contract\r\nAppellants argue the trial judge erred by denying their motion for a directed verdict as to their breach of contract claim against HRFH.Â  They also argue the trial judge erred in denying their post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV).[2]Â  We disagree.\r\nIn reviewing a denial of motions for directed verdict and JNOV, the evidence and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Brady Dev. Co. v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 312 S.C. 73, 78, 439 S.E.2d 266, 269 (1993); Â Evans v. Taylor Made Sandwich Co., 337 S.C. 95, 99, 522 S.E.2d 350, 352 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The motion should be denied where the â€œevidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Evans, 337 S.C. at 99, 522 S.E.2d at 352.Â  When considering the motion, the appellate court nor the trial court has authority to â€œdecide credibility issues [or] . . . to resolve conflicts in the testimony and evidence.â€Â  Garrett v. Locke, 309 S.C. 94, 99, 419 S.E.2d 842, 845 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nThe parties do not dispute the existence of the written lease agreement in this case.Â  They only dispute the interpretation of that contract.Â  â€œThe main guide in contract interpretation is to ascertain and give legal effect to the intentions of the parties as expressed in the language of the lease.â€Â  Gilbert v. Miller, 356 S.C. 25, 30, 586 S.E.2d 861, 864 (Ct. App. 2003).Â \r\nWhere the language of the contract is clear, this court must interpret the lawful meaning of the contract and the intent of the parties according to the plain, ordinary, and popular sense of the terms used in the agreement.Â  Id. at 30-31, 586 S.E.2d at 864. \r\nAppellants rely on the commencement date of the lease, January 1, 2001, as the date by which HRFH was to deliver the premises.Â  Because this did not occur, they argue their motions for directed verdict and JNOV should have been granted.Â  Although the lease provided that it commenced on January 1, 2001, that HRFH would make certain upfits prior to delivery, and that payment of rent would commence forty-five days after delivery, the lease did not provide a date by which the premises would be delivered.Â  Conflicting testimony was presented at trial regarding whether the parties believed the January 1, 2001 date was the delivery date or merely the commencement date for the lease.Â  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to HRFH, more than one inference can be made regarding the delivery date.Â  Therefore, the trial judge did not err in denying the motion for a directed verdict or JNOV.Â  Evans, 337 S.C. at 99, 522 S.E.2d at 352.Â  \r\nII.Â  Lost Profits/Future Damages\r\nAppellants argue the trial judge erred in denying their request to present evidence of damages in the form of lost future profits.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice.Â  Commerce Ctr. of Greenville, Inc. v. Powers McElveen &amp; Assocs., Inc., 347 S.C. 545, 559, 556 S.E.2d 718, 725-26 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In order to show lost future profits as an element of damages in a new enterprise, the damages must be the natural result of the breach of contract, the damages must have been reasonably contemplated by the parties, and the lost profits must be established with reasonable certainty.Â  Drews Co. v. Ledwith-Wolfe Assocs., Inc., 296 S.C. 207, 213, 371 S.E.2d 532, 535-36 (1988).Â  â€œâ€˜The proof must pass the realm of conjecture, speculation, or opinion not founded on facts, and must consist of actual facts from which a reasonably accurate conclusion regarding the cause and the amount of the loss can be logically and rationally drawn.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting 22 Am.Jur.2d Damages Â§ 641 (1988)).Â  Different methods for proving lost future profits are acceptable, including, but not limited to, expert testimony, economic and financial data, market surveys, comparison with similar enterprises, and comparison with the profit history of plaintiffâ€™s successor.Â  Id. at 213-14, 371 S.E.2d at 536.Â  \r\nAppellants sought to introduce evidence of lost future profits through the testimony of Pourlos, and the trial judge allowed Pourlos to testify in camera regarding this issue.Â  According to Pourlos, he projected that in the first year, the Vault would have $360,000 in lunch sales, $540,000 in dinner sales, and a gross profit of $216,723.Â  He admitted that he based those figures on his own experience as the owner of a fast food restaurant, and he did not contact a financial professional in coming up with those figures.Â  After hearing Pourlosâ€™s testimony, the trial judge ruled the lost future profits evidence was too speculative and would not be admitted.Â  In their post-trial motion, Appellants argued the trial judge erred in excluding the lost profits evidence.Â  The trial judge found that because the jury found for HRFH on Appellantsâ€™ counterclaim for breach of contract, the question of damages was nullified.Â Â  \r\nWe agree with the trial judgeâ€™s decision to exclude the evidence of lost future profits in this case.Â  Pourlos did not have experience as a restaurateur of a fine dining establishment, no evidence was presented of profits from a comparable restaurant, no expert testimony was presented, and no market surveys or analysis were performed.Â  Pourlosâ€™s testimony amounted to speculation.Â  Thus, the trial judge correctly excluded it.Â  Moreover, we agree with the trial judge that the juryâ€™s finding in favor of HRFH on Appellantsâ€™ breach of contract counterclaim rendered the question of damages moot.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in excluding the lost future profits evidence.Â Â  \r\nIII.Â  Equitable Indemnity\r\nAppellants argue the trial judge erred by dismissing their cause of action for equitable indemnity prior to trial.Â  They assert the actions of Raby Construction and HRFH caused their loss, â€œfor which under the theory of equitable indemnity, Pourlos is entitled to recovery for costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.â€Â  We disagree. \r\nAppellantsâ€™ counterclaim for equitable indemnity was brought against HFRH and the real estate agencies and agent.Â  Appellants did not make Raby Construction a party.Â  Prior to trial, the trial judge dismissed the claim for equitable indemnity against the real estate agencies and agent for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  After presentation of all the evidence, HRFH moved to dismiss the equitable indemnity claim against it.Â  Appellantsâ€™ counsel mistakenly informed the judge that the equitable indemnity claim had already been dismissed against all parties.Â  After HRFHâ€™s counsel pointed out that the cause of action still existed, the judge appeared to rule that the pleadings did not support the equitable indemnity claim, stating â€œ[t]heyâ€™re not going to get the pleadings.â€Â  In their post-trial motions, Appellants argued the trial judge erred in his pretrial dismissal of the equitable indemnification claim.Â Â Â  \r\nA motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim must be based solely on the allegations set forth on the face of the complaint.Â  Cowart v. Poore, 337 S.C. 359, 363, 523 S.E.2d 182, 184 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In reviewing a motion to dismiss a counterclaim, the court must consider whether, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and with every doubt resolved in his favor, the counterclaim states any valid claim for relief.Â  Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. Laidlaw Transit., Inc., 348 S.C. 420, 424, 559 S.E.2d 362, 364 (Ct. App. 2001); Cowart, 337 S.C. at 363-64, 523 S.E.2d at 184-85.Â  \r\nEquitable indemnity is based on the specific relationship between the indemnitee and the indemnitor in dealing with a third party.Â  Rock Hill Tel. Co. v. Globe Commcâ€™ns, Inc., 363 S.C. 385, 389, 611 S.E.2d 235, 237 (2005).Â  It is a form of compensation in which the â€œfirst party is liable to pay a second party for a loss or damage the second party incurs to a third party.â€Â  Town of Winnsboro v. Wiedeman-Singleton, Inc., 303 S.C. 52, 56, 398 S.E.2d 500, 502 (Ct. App. 1990), affâ€™d, 307 S.C. 128, 414 S.E.2d 118 (1992).Â  \r\n\r\nFor a party to recover under a theory of equitable indemnification, three things must be proven: Â (1) the indemnitor was liable for causing the Plaintiffâ€™s damages; (2) the indemnitee was exonerated from any liability for those damages; and (3) the indemnitee suffered damages as a result of the Plaintiffâ€™s claims against it which were eventually proven to be the fault of the indemnitor.\r\n\r\nVermeer Carolinaâ€™s, Inc., v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 63, 518 S.E.2d 301, 307 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œThe most important requirement for the finding of equitable indemnity is that the party seeking to be indemnified is adjudged without fault and the indemnifying party is the one at fault.â€Â  Id.\r\nAppellants only appeal the trial judgeâ€™s decision to dismiss the equitable indemnity claim in the pretrial order.Â  The pretrial order only dealt with the real estate agencies and agent.Â  Appellants argue the claim should not have been dismissed against HRFH and do not challenge the dismissal of the equitable indemnity claim with regard to the real estate agencies or agent.Â  Thus, the trial judgeâ€™s pretrial dismissal of the equitable indemnity claim against the real estate agencies and agent is the law of the case.Â  Brading v. County of Georgetown, 327 S.C. 107, 113, 490 S.E.2d 4, 7 (1997) (holding that an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).Â  Â \r\nMoreover, we are unable to discern from the record whether Appellants raised the argument below regarding their equitable indemnity claim against HFRH that they are raising now on appeal.Â  In the only discussion included in the record, Appellantsâ€™ counsel mistakenly informed the trial judge that the issue had already been decided prior to trial and did not present any argument when HRFH argued the issue was still before the judge.Â  Because nothing in the record indicates that Appellants made the current appellate argument to the trial judge, this issue is not appropriate for appellate review.Â  See Harkins v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. 606, 616, 533 S.E.2d 886, 891 (2000) (holding that the appellant has the burden of presenting a sufficient record to allow review); Zaman v. South Carolina Bd. of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 305 S.C. 281, 285, 408 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991) (noting that appellate courts will not consider any fact which does not appear in the record); Bryant v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 342 S.C. 159, 171-72, 536 S.E.2d 380, 387 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that a party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal).Â  Â Â Â \r\nEven assuming this issue is properly before this court, we find no error with the dismissal of the equitable indemnity claim against HRFH.Â  In their answer and counterclaim, Appellants alleged they were entitled to indemnity because the circumstances surrounding the lawsuit were brought about by HRFH and the real estate agencies and agent, causing them damages.Â  Viewing these allegations in the light most favorable to Appellants, the counterclaim failed to allege facts that constituted the cause of action for equitable indemnity.Â  Appellants and HRFH were opposing parties, each seeking compensation from the other for their actions.Â  No allegation was made that Appellants were responsible for damages to another party due to the fault of HRFH, thus entitling Appellants to be equitably indemnified by HRFH.Â  Because the allegations in the counterclaim failed to state facts that would support a claim for equitable indemnity, we find no error with the dismissal of the claim against HRFH.Â  Moreover, the juryâ€™s finding that Appellants were responsible for the breach of the lease barred any recovery under equitable indemnity.Â  Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, Inc., 336 S.C. at 63, 518 S.E.2d at 307 (â€œThe most important requirement for the finding of equitable indemnity is that the party seeking to be indemnified is adjudged without fault and the indemnifying party is the one at fault.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThere is evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s denial of Appellantsâ€™ motions for a directed verdict and JNOV.Â  Appellants evidence of lost profits was speculative, at best, and thus the trial judge correctly excluded the evidence from the trial.Â  Finally, Appellants failed to allege sufficient facts in their complaint to support a cause of action for equitable indemnity against HRFH, and the juryâ€™s finding of fault barred any recovery under that cause of action.Â  Accordingly, the trial judgeâ€™s rulings and the juryâ€™s verdict are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this appeal without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n[2]Â  Appellants also made post-trial motions for a new trial and a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  Although Appellantsâ€™ brief contains a sentence to the effect that the trial judgeâ€™s denial of all of the post-trial motions was in error, Appellants only argue the denial of the directed verdict and JNOV.Â  Thus, it appears that the denial of the two new trial motions is the law of the case.Â  Brading v. County of Georgetown, 327 S.C. 107, 113, 490 S.E.2d 4, 7 (1997) (holding that an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-309","title":"Southard v.

Young, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-309\r\nHeard February 7, 2006 â€“ Filed July 7, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nBonnie Travaglio Hunt, of Charleston, John S. Nichols, of Columbia, and Linda Weeks Gangi, of Conway, for Appellants.\r\nG. Thomas Hill, of Ravenel, for Respondents.\r\nTimothy Alan Domin, of Charleston, for Amicus Curiae. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Lee Pye, Russ Pye, and Justin Enterprises (Appellants or Pyes) appeal a circuit court order granting James Southard and Development Unlimitedâ€™s (Respondents or Southard) motion to compel settlement.Â  We affirm. \r\nThis appeal arises from a series of lawsuits between Justin Enterprises, a partnership owned and operated by Russ and Lee Pye, and adjoining landowners in Charleston County, South Carolina.Â  Although the facts of the previous litigation are, for the most part, irrelevant to the issues on appeal, a brief review will provide insight into the partiesâ€™ positions.\r\nThe Pyes own tracts of land in Charleston County.Â  The County of Charleston owned land adjacent to the Pyesâ€™ on which it planned to develop an ash landfill to dispose of trash from a waste incinerator.Â  The County petitioned the Army Corps of Engineers for, and received, a permit for filling a portion of wetlands on their property to construct a road.Â  The Pyes successfully challenged the Corps issuance of the permit, alleging it violated several federal laws related to the historical significance of the property and the effect such a road may have on endangered species in the area.\r\nRespondents own another tract of land adjacent to both the Appellantsâ€™ and the Countyâ€™s property.Â  Respondents also hold an easement over the Appellantsâ€™ property, which provides access to a public road.Â  Respondents sought to increase this easement to facilitate development or the harvesting of timber from the property.Â  The Pyes refused to so expand the easement.\r\nSeeking another way to access the property, Respondents sought and obtained an easement from the County to construct a road across the Countyâ€™s property to facilitate access to their property.Â  The Pyes then brought another action against the County arguing they were merely letting Respondents do indirectly that which they were prevented from doing directly by the previous litigation.Â  Respondents intervened in this action as third-party defendants.Â  The Pyes obtained a temporary injunction preventing Respondents from constructing the road after which Respondents agreed to terminate their easement with the County.Â  Thereafter, the case was rendered moot.\r\nOn February 26, 2002, Respondents brought the current suit against the Pyes alleging nine causes of action, including, inter alia, libel, slander, malicious prosecution, slander of title, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  These accusations were based on the Pyesâ€™ alleged conduct as it related to preventing Respondents from enjoying their property.\r\nThe Pyes informed their liability carrier, State Farm, of the impending lawsuit and State Farm undertook representation by hiring an attorney to defend the Pyes.Â  The Appellantsâ€™ policies with State Farmâ€”a commercial liability policy, a business policy, and a homeowners policyâ€”provide, in pertinent part, the following respectively: â€œWe may investigate and settle any claim or suit at our discretionâ€; and â€œ[w]e may investigate, negotiate and settle a claim or suit covered by this policy.â€[1]  \r\nA jury trial was set to begin on June 7, 2004. Â Before trial began, the Pyesâ€™ attorney informed them that after consulting with Respondents, State Farm was willing to settle the litigation for $120,000 provided the parties both signed a mutual release.Â  The Pyes informed their attorney they would not be willing to sign a mutual release if the Respondents received any money from State Farm.Â  In particular, it appears the Pyes were concerned with what effect the proposed settlement would have on their ability to obtain insurance in the future.Â  The Pyes were also concerned with what would happen to their coverage following their refusal to sign the release suggested in the proposed settlement.Â  \r\nThe Pyes and their attorney shared these concerns with the circuit court judge in a chambers conference. Â The judge continued the action for 30 days so the Pyes could consult with another attorney who possessed a more thorough understanding of their rights under their State Farm policies.Â  On June 10, Respondents contacted the Pyesâ€™ attorney and withdrew their demand for a mutual release.[2]Â  \r\nIn the meantime, the Pyesâ€™ original attorney sent a draft general release to Respondents for their consideration.Â  On June 17 and 18 the Pyes consulted with coverage counsel for State Farm who informed them he believed the case was settled and it was his understanding State Farm had the exclusive right to settle the case without their knowledge.Â  \r\nOn June 22, the Pyes obtained independent counsel who filed a notice of appearance and a motion for injunctive relief to prevent consummation of the proposed settlement.Â  Also on June 22, Respondents signed and returned the proposed settlement to the Pyesâ€™ original counsel.Â  \r\nOn August 9, 2004, Respondents filed a motion with the circuit court seeking to enforce the settlement agreement.Â  The Pyes submitted a motion in opposition asserting, inter alia, that the settlement was unenforceable because there was no meeting of the minds between the real parties in interest and that their former attorney lacked any authority, apparent or actual, to settle the case.Â  The motion was supported by an affidavit from the Pyes, which among other things, stated their belief that the State Farm appointed attorney ceased representing them following the chambers conference with the circuit court judge.Â  Â Â \r\nOn August 25, a hearing was held before the circuit court on the motion to compel settlement.Â  After considering the arguments, the court stated that it believed State Farm had a right to settle the case over the Pyesâ€™ objections.Â  The circuit court issued an order on August 26 officially granting the motion based on its belief that the language in the Pyesâ€™ policies â€œallowed the insurance company to settle the covered claims at issue in this case without [the Pyesâ€™] consent and over their objection.â€Â  The Pyes filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the courtâ€™s ruling.Â  The circuit court summarily denied this motion on September 21, 2004.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants first argue the trial court erred in compelling the settlement over their objection considering that it recognized a conflict of interest between them and their State Farm appointed counsel.\r\nAppellantsâ€™ argument on this issue is based primarily on the purported conflict recognized by the circuit court and their assertion that they fired their attorney before the settlement was entered into.Â  They support this position with Rules 1.2 and 1.16, SCACR.Â  Rule 1.2 states in pertinent part that â€œa lawyer shall abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning . . . whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter.â€Â  Similarly, Rule 1.16 states that â€œa lawyer . . . shall withdraw from the representation of a client if . . . the lawyer is discharged.â€\r\nAccordingly, Appellants argue that because their attorney was discharged prior to the settlement being entered into, she was not in a position to negotiate on their behalf and, thus, the settlement should not be upheld.\r\nIn response to Appellantsâ€™ position, Respondents simply assert that neither they nor the court were aware that Appellants discharged their attorney.Â  They note that the transcript from Appellantsâ€™ chambers conference with the judge simply shows the court provided the Appellants time to seek legal counsel regarding their insurance coverage.Â  Because the settlement was entered into â€œin the normal course of business,â€ Respondents aver it was properly enforced by the circuit court.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter review, we agree with the circuit court and Respondents that the record does not support Appellantsâ€™ position that their attorney was discharged prior to the settlementâ€™s consummation.Â  A review of the transcript from Appellantsâ€™ chambers conference shows the judge was merely giving Appellants an opportunity to consult with coverage counsel concerning their rights under the various insurance policies.Â  Nowhere is there mention of any purported conflict of interest between the Pyes and their State Farm appointed attorney.Â  \r\nHaving correctly determined their attorney was still representing them at the time the settlement was entered into, the circuit court held the language of the various insurance policies at issue gave State Farm the right to settle the case unilaterally without the Pyesâ€™ consent.Â  We agree with this ruling.\r\nInsurance contracts are subject to â€œthe general rules of contract construction.â€Â  Hansen ex rel. Hansen v. United Servs. Auto. Assâ€™n, 350 S.C. 62, 68, 565 S.E.2d 114, 116 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Marine Contracting &amp; Towing Co., 301 S.C. 418, 421, 392 S.E.2d 460, 461 (1990)).Â  The primary purpose of all rules of contract construction is to determine the intent of the parties.Â  Id.Â  â€œIf the contractâ€™s language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contractâ€™s force and effect.â€Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134 (2003) (citation omitted).\r\nAs noted earlier, the insurance policies at issue all included clauses which unambiguously gave State Farm the right to â€œinvestigate, negotiate, and settleâ€ any claim covered by the policy.Â  Because we find the Pyesâ€™ attorney was not discharged and that the various policies gave State Farm the right to settle the case unilaterally, we find the trial court did not err in granting Respondentsâ€™ motion to compel the settlement.Â  \r\nAppellants next argue, based on their assertion that the trial court recognized a conflict of interest between them and their attorney, that counsel was without any actual or implied authority to settle the case over their objections.Â  However, because our previous ruling disposes of this issue, we need not address it.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling appellate court need not review remaining issues when disposition of prior issues are dispositive); Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œ[t]he appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in Record on Appealâ€).\r\nAppellants also assert the settlement does not comply with the requirements of Rule 43(k), SCRCP and, because of this, the settlement should not be enforced.\r\nRule 43(k) states â€œ[n]o agreement between counsel affecting the proceedings in an action shall be binding unless reduced to the form of a consent order or written stipulation signed by counsel and entered in the record, or unless made in open court and noted upon the record.â€Â  See also Ashfort Corp. v. Palmetto Construction Group, Inc., 318 S.C. 492, 458 S.E.2d 533 (1995) (stating that rule is applicable to settlement agreements).\r\nAppellants aver that because they, nor anyone on their behalf, ever signed the general release and there was no other writing purporting to settle the case, the settlement is unenforceable.Â  They maintain this is true because at the time Respondents signed the general release, Appellants had relieved their State Farm appointed attorney and obtained independent counsel to prevent consummation of the settlement.\r\nAlthough Appellants admit Rule 43(k) does not apply when the settlement has been admitted or carried into effect, they assert they never agreed to the settlement.Â  In addition, Appellants maintain that Respondentsâ€™ counsel was aware of their disagreement with their prior attorney, including the fact that she no longer represented them in this action.Â  \r\nAs noted previously, we find Appellantsâ€™ contention that their attorney no longer represented them to be without merit.Â  At least, it is clear she was not discharged before State Farm and Respondents agreed on the terms of the settlement.Â  Accordingly, as we have concluded that State Farm, under the language of the pertinent policies, was entitled to settle the case unilaterally, whether the Pyes signed the settlement is irrelevant.Â  As the trial court noted, â€œthere was an enforceable settlement at the moment the [Respondents] dropped their request for a mutual release and State Farm said we will pay you if you sign a general release.â€Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ final argument is that an â€œinsuredâ€™s duty to cooperate with the insurer under a liability insurance policy does not allow an insurer to settle a case against an insuredâ€™s interests and over the insuredâ€™s objections.â€Â  Specifically, they assert that an insurance company, at least under the facts of this case, should not be allowed to settle against the wishes of the insured when the insuredâ€™s have a meritorious defense to the claims against them.\r\nAgain, because we find the trial court was correct in concluding the underlying policies at issue gave State Farm the right to settle the case unilaterally, we need not address the merits of Appellantsâ€™ policy argument.Â  Futch, 335 S.C. at 613, 518 S.E.2d at 598.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Provisions of this type are often referred to as â€œdeems expedientâ€ clauses.Â  In support of Respondentsâ€™ position, State Farm submitted an Amicus Curiae brief which essentially argues South Carolina, although not officially, seems to follow the majority of jurisdictions which hold the presence of a deems expedient clause in an insurance contract gives the insurer permission to settle a claim without the consent of the insured.Â  \r\n[2] On June 15, State Farm wrote to the Pyes and informed them State Farm was denying the Pyes a defense under their liability policies in a separate legal action.Â  On June 21 the Pyesâ€™ original attorney sent them a letter stating she received State Farmâ€™s notice denying the Pyes a defense in the separate action.Â  This letter was somewhat confusing in that it referenced the current lawsuit as well as the separate lawsuit.Â  Included with the letter were a Motion to be Relieved as Counsel and a Consent Order relieving her as counsel in the matter.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-310","title":"Pickens County v.

Patterson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-310\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2006 â€“ Filed July 7, 2006Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nR. Murray Hughes, of Pickens, for Appellant.\r\nKenneth S. Roper, of Liberty, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Danny Ward was charged with violating a Pickens County ordinance for failing to obtain a permit before moving a structure onto his property in the county.Â  Ward was tried before a jury in magistrateâ€™s court, where he was found guilty of violating the ordinance and fined $153.00.Â  Ward appealed to the circuit court and the circuit court dismissed his appeal.Â  Ward now appeals the dismissal, asserting (1) he was denied due process in his appeal to the circuit court because the review was inadequate and his appeal was improperly dismissed, (2) the ordinance in question was so vague or indefinite that its enforcement violates due process, and (3) the magistrate erred in failing to charge the jury on the defense of alibi.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAfter numerous attempts to contact Ward by telephone, the Pickens County Building Codes Administration (County) sent Ward a certified letter on April 8, 2004 noting Ward had failed to obtain a moving permit prior to moving a structure onto property on April 4, 2004.Â  The letter informed Ward that his failure to obtain the proper permit would result in the issuance of a summons to magistrateâ€™s court for violation of section R 105.1 of the International Residential Code.Â  On May 24, 2004, County sent Ward another certified letter concerning the continued attempts to contact him about the matter, his failure to respond, and Countyâ€™s intent to deliver a summons to Ward.Â  Ward was thereafter charged with violating Pickens County Ordinance 8.1 which adopted section R 105.1 of the 2000 International Residential Code. Â This section provides in pertinent part as follows: â€œAny owner or authorized agent who intends to . . . move, demolish, or change the occupancy of a building or structure . . . shall first make application to the building official and obtain the required permit.â€Â  \r\nAfter being found guilty of violating this ordinance in magistrateâ€™s court, Ward appealed to the circuit court raising four exceptions.Â  Ward asserted (1) the County failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because the Countyâ€™s witness admitted he had some doubt as to whether or not he saw Ward present when the house was moved onto the property and Ward testified he was in Tennessee when the house was moved; (2) Ward did not own the property when the house was moved nor was there evidence that he was the agent of the owner; (3) â€œ[t]he grammatical structure of the statute is so defective and general as to make interpretation of enforcement of the statute arbitrary and capriciousâ€; (4) the matter should have been dismissed because the main prosecution witness, who signed the summons against Ward, did not testify and â€œby the State not allowing [the witness] to testify, the facts and evidence would also sway to [Ward].â€Â  \r\nThe magistrate filed a response to Wardâ€™s appeal addressing each of Wardâ€™s exceptions. Â While he noted various bases for affirming Wardâ€™s conviction under each exception, he specifically noted, as to each exception, that the grounds raised in the appeal were not preserved because Ward failed to offer a motion or objection to any of them at the trial level.Â  Following a hearing on the matter, the circuit court issued its order dismissing the appeal and ordering Ward to pay the fine within five days or serve a thirty day sentence.[2]Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppeals from magistrate court convictions are made to the circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-10 (Supp. 2005); State v. Bailey, 368 S.C. 39, ___, 626 S.E.2d 898, 900 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  On appeal, the circuit court may not conduct a trial de novo, but instead, acting as an appellate court, reviews for preserved error raised by appropriate exception. Â Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-70 (Supp. 2005) (â€œThe appeal must be heard by the Court of Common Pleas upon the grounds of exceptions made and upon the papers required under this chapter, without the examination of witnesses in that court.â€); Bailey, 368 S.C. at ___, 626 S.E.2d at 900 (â€œThe circuit court, acting as the appellate court, reviews the matters raised in the notice of appeal.â€); State v. Henderson, 347 S.C. 455, 457, 556 S.E.2d 691, 692 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œIn criminal appeals from magistrate or municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a de novo review, but instead reviews for preserved error raised to it by appropriate exception.â€).Â  In reviewing such cases, the appellate court may review for errors of law only.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Unpreserved Issues\r\nOn appeal, Ward raises three issues.Â  Two of these issues, that the ordinance in question was so vague or indefinite that its enforcement violates due process and that the magistrate erred in failing to charge the jury on the defense of alibi, however, are clearly not preserved for review.Â  \r\nThe magistrateâ€™s return does not indicate Ward requested a jury charge on the defense of alibi, and there is no other evidence of record Ward ever raised this issue before the magistrate.Â  Further, neither Wardâ€™s exceptions raised to the circuit court, nor the magistrateâ€™s response to the exceptions indicates this issue was ever raised to the circuit court in its appellate capacity.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not properly before us on appeal.Â  See State v. Bailey, 368 S.C. 39, ___, 626 S.E.2d 898, 900 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding, in appeal from magistrateâ€™s court to circuit court, where preservation issue was never brought to the attention of the circuit court, it was not appropriate for this court to review the issue); City of Columbia v. Ervin, 330 S.C. 516, 519-20, 500 S.E.2d 483, 485 (1998) (holding the Court of Appeals should not have addressed the merits of an issue because the issue was not raised by exception to the intermediate appellate court and therefore could not be raised for the first time in the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals).Â  \r\nAdditionally, the magistrateâ€™s response indicates Ward never challenged the ordinance at the trial level and therefore this issue is not preserved for appellate review either.Â  Ward concedes that he did not properly raise an objection to preserve this exception for appeal.Â  See State v. Black, 319 S.C. 515, 521-22, 462 S.E.2d 311, 315 (Ct. App. 1995); State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (holding a contemporaneous objection is required at trial to properly preserve an error for appellate review; an issue which is not properly preserved cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.)Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Inadequate Review and Dismissal of Appeal\r\nWard also contends the circuit court violated his procedural due process rights by inadequately reviewing his exceptions and by dismissing his appeal.Â  We disagree.\r\n A.Â Â Â Â Â  Inadequate ReviewÂ  \r\nWard argues that he preserved his right to appellate review by timely filing his notice of appeal and exceptions, and that the circuit court violated his due process rights by â€œsimply dismissing the appeal rather than meaningfully addressing the exceptions.â€Â  Specifically, he claims the circuit court failed to hear his exceptions â€œin a meaningful mannerâ€ and that due process requires, at a minimum, that he be allowed to argue and the circuit court determine if the exceptions have any merit and explain its reasoning for accepting or rejecting his exceptions on the record or in a written order.Â  \r\nAlthough the parties indicate a hearing was held before the circuit court, there is no transcript from the hearing in the record on appeal.Â  Thus, it is impossible for this court to discern that Ward was somehow prevented from arguing his position or that the circuit court failed to explain its reasoning on the record.Â  See State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 135, 620 S.E.2d 737, 742 (2005) (holding the appellant has the burden of providing the appellate court with a sufficient record for review).Â  Further, it appears the circuit courtâ€™s action was based on Wardâ€™s failure to have raised any of the issues in his exceptions to the magistrate during his trial, a fact that Ward readily concedes is true in his appellate brief.[3]Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDismissal of Appeal \r\nWard also asserts the circuit court violated his due process rights by dismissing his appeal.Â  He argues, pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-70, dismissal of his appeal was outside of the circuit courtâ€™s authority and this court should therefore reverse and remand the matter to the circuit court for appropriate review of his exceptions.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-70 prescribes the standard of review in criminal appeals from magistrateâ€™s court to the circuit court. Â This section provides as follows:\r\n\r\nThe appeal must be heard by the Court of Common Pleas upon the grounds of exceptions made and upon the papers required under this chapter, without the examination of witnesses in that court.Â  And the court may either confirm the sentence appealed from, reverse or modify it, or grant a new trial, as to the court may seem meet and conformable to law.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-70 (Supp. 2005).Â Â Â  \r\nAs noted, Ward concedes that he did not properly raise objections at the trial level to preserve his exceptions for appeal before the circuit court.Â  Whether the circuit court dismissed the appeal or affirmed the sentence, the result is the same and Ward can show no prejudice.Â  We cannot discern what possible difference the dismissal of Wardâ€™s appeal makes as opposed to the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the matter, as they both result in confirmation of his sentence. Â See Miles v. Miles, 303 S.C. 33, 35, 397 S.E.2d 790, 791 (Ct. App. 1990) (noting an appellant has the burden of showing, not only error, but also prejudice); State v. Jolly, 304 S.C. 34, 39, 402 S.E.2d 895, 898 (Ct. App. 1991) (noting â€œ[a]ppellate courts recognize an overriding rule which says:Â  â€˜whatever doesnâ€™t make any difference, doesnâ€™t matterâ€™â€) (quoting McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C.1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987)). \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order below is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, STILWELL and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]While the parties indicate a hearing was held on the matter before the circuit court on June 30, 2005, and the circuit court considered both written and oral arguments by Ward, there is no transcript of this hearing in the record before us.Â  \r\n[3]We specifically reject Wardâ€™s assertion that Rule 11(a), SCRMC, providing that â€œ[t]rials should be conducted in an informal manner and rules of evidence shall apply but shall be relaxed in the interest of justice,â€ relieves him of his obligation to object at the trial level to preserve his exceptions on appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-311","title":"Pinder v.

[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nPinder was employed as President and Chief Financial Officer of Sea Island.Â  Washington was and remains the chairperson of the Board of Directors of Sea Island.Â  Washington allegedly stated during a July 1999 Special Call Meeting of the Executive Committee of Sea Island that he had been told by Senator Hollings that if Pinder would resign from his employment with Sea Island, there would be a significant increase in funding to Sea Island.Â  Pinder was also told that a lot of â€œbad bloodâ€ had developed during the struggle to keep a nursing home open and tendered his resignation in 2000 based on these discussions.Â  \r\nPinder and the Board of Directors entered into an agreement to pay him for the remaining portion of his sick and annual leave.Â  The parties agreed on a lump sum of $322,000.Â  Sea Island did not have the cash funds available, so Sea Island offered Pinder a mortgage on a portion of the excess real property owned by Sea Island in the amount owed.Â  Runyon, the general counsel for Sea Island, prepared three mortgages with Sea Island and presented them to the Board of Directors at its regular monthly meeting.Â  One mortgage was to secure a note for $322,000 to Pinder.Â  Another mortgage was to secure a note for $325,000 to be made payable from Sea Island to Runyon. Â The final mortgage was to secure a note for $750,000 to the Sea Island Community Development Funds, Inc.Â  Pinder believes the $325,000 and the $750,000 mortgages were false and were created solely for the benefit of Washington and Runyon.Â  Â \r\nIn March 2001, Pinder filed suit alleging various causes of action, including one relating to his unpaid wages.Â  See Pinder v. Sea Island Health Comprehensive Health Care Corporation, et. al., (No. 2001-CP-10-0845).Â  That action was stricken from the docket by agreement pursuant to Rule 40(j), SCRCP.Â  On June 6, 2003, Thomas Johnson, formerly Vice Chairman of Sea Islandâ€™s Board of Directors and also a member of the Executive Committee, submitted an affidavit in a civil action pending in the Circuit Court of Charleston County, that reiterated Washingtonâ€™s July 1999 comments to the Executive Committee.Â Â  \r\nThis action was commenced on August 15, 2003, against Runyon and Washington alleging two counts of fraud.Â  Specifically, Pinder asserts the Respondents intentionally defrauded him.Â  In addition, Pinder claims Respondents entered into a conspiracy to carry out this fraud.Â Â  Respondents filed answers and motions to dismiss. Â Â Runyon joined in the Motion to Dismiss and to Strike filed by Washington.Â  The motion, among other things, sought to dismiss the action under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, for failure to state a cause of action in that the time to file Pinderâ€™s action had expired under the statute of limitations.Â  The trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion as to the statute of limitations. Â This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Â In considering such a motion, the trial court must base its ruling solely on allegations set forth in the complaint. Â Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 527, 511 S.E.2d 69, 73 (1999).Â  If the facts and inferences drawn from the facts alleged in the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory, then the grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is improper. Id. Â In deciding whether the trial court properly granted the motion to dismiss, the appellate court must consider whether the complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, states any valid claim for relief. Â Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 5, 522 S.E.2d 137, 139 (1999).\r\nÂ A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) should not be granted if facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom entitle the plaintiff to relief under any theory. Id. Â Furthermore, the complaint should not be dismissed merely because the court doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the action. Â Toussaint v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 416, 357 S.E.2d 8, 9 (1987).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPinder contends the trial court erred in dismissing his suit pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, based on an expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe proper statute of limitations for claims based on fraud is three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 2005); Hedgepath v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 355, 559 S.E.2d 327, 336 (Ct. App. 2001) (indicating the 1988 version of this statute of limitations was decreased from six years to three years).Â Â  â€œIn South Carolina, the statute of limitations for causes of action for fraud is governed by the â€˜discovery rule,â€™ and does not begin to run until discovery of the fraud itself or of â€˜such facts as would have led to the knowledge thereof, if pursued with reasonable diligence.â€™â€Â  Burgess v. Am. Cancer Soc., S.C. Div., Inc., 300 S.C. 182, 185, 386 S.E.2d 798, 799 (Ct. App. 1989) (external citations omitted).Â  \r\nA Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action must be resolved by the trial judge based solely on the allegations in the complaint. Â See Woodell v. Marion Sch. Dist. One, 307 S.C. 297, 298, 414 S.E.2d 794, 794 (Ct. App. 1992). Â In the instant case numerous exhibits were attached to and incorporated in the amended complaint; a trial court may consider those exhibits when ruling on the defendantsâ€™ motion to dismiss.[2] Â See Rule 10(c), SCRCP (â€œA copy of any plat, photograph, diagram, document, or other paper which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purposes if a copy is attached to such pleading.â€); Lee v. Kelley, 298 S.C. 155, 158, 378 S.E.2d 616, 617 (Ct. App. 1989) ( â€œ[B]y virtue of Rule 10(c), SCRCP, the attachment became a part and parcel of the complaint.â€); Metal Serv. Corp. v. Industr. Elec. Co., 253 S.C. 507, 509, 171 S.E.2d 703, 704 (1970) (considering materials attached to complaint when deciding defendantâ€™s demurrer to the\r\ncomplaint).\r\nThe trial court made the determination that, based on the amended complaint and the exhibits attached thereto, Pinderâ€™s claim fell beyond the applicable statute of limitations.Â  Specifically, the trial court based its findings on the fact the complaint alleges Pinder did not receive wages owed to him in February 2000 which should have put him on notice of his fraud claims.Â  While it is true that any claim for unpaid wages would likely be beyond the statute of limitations, the pleadings themselves do not indicate on their face whether Pinderâ€™s claims for fraud are beyond the statute of limitations.Â  While the alleged acts of fraud occurred in 1999, the important query is when the discovery of such acts occurred or should have occurred.Â  This matter must be more fully developed in order to make a determination of whether the alleged acts of fraud fell within the applicable statute of limitations.Â  Based on the amended complaint and the exhibits attached thereto, we are unable to determine when the statute of limitations began to run.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the trial courtâ€™s order merely speaks to the unpaid wages, and does not reach the other acts of fraud alleged in the amended complaint.Â  To have dismissed Pinderâ€™s complaint, the trial court was required to find that Pinder was not entitled to relief based on a liberal view of any of his claims.Â  The trial court did not do this.Â  Therefore, we hold that based on the complaint and its exhibits, Pinderâ€™s complaint should not have been dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).Â  Though we are remanding this case to the trial court, we express no opinion as to whether Pinder has a valid claim against Washington and Runyon.Â  This opinion only concerns whether the trial court was correct in its dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).[3]Â  Additionally, this opinion in no way precludes Respondents from pursuing their motion for summary judgment on remand or any other of their motions not ruled on by the trial court.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1]  We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp;\r\n[2] The incorporation of so many exhibits renders Pinderâ€™s complaint unwieldy and exacerbates itsâ€™ rambling allegations.Â  \r\n[3] Because we remand pursuant to the Rule 12(b)(6) issue, we need not reach the other issues concerning the application of the discovery rule or the scrivenerâ€™s error.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-312","title":"SCDSS v.

Johnson, of Augusta, Georgia, for Appellant.\r\nDennis M. Gmerek, of Aiken, for Respondent.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nZiva Peleg Bruckner, of Columbia, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this appeal from a permanency planning order and from an order denying a motion[1] filed ten months after the merits removal hearing, Deborah Padgett (Mother) seeks to challenge the initial merits order which found she had physically abused and neglected her fourteen year-old-son, Michael.Â  Because we find that the Rule 59(e) motion was untimely and that Mother cannot appeal from the merits removal order by appealing from the subsequent permanency planning order, we affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 4, 2004, the Aiken County Sheriff Department took Michael Padgett, a child under the age of eighteen, into emergency protective custody after Michael complained he had no place to stay nor anyone to care for him while Mother was in the hospital.Â  A hearing determined probable cause existed to remove Michael from Mother, and the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) assumed custody of Michael pending a merits hearing.Â  Mother was not present at the probable cause hearing.\r\nThe merits hearing was held on November 4, 2004.Â  When Mother failed to appear, DSS informed the court that she was personally served with the pleadings on October 6, 2004.Â  The court found: â€œThe defendant Deborah Padgett, was properly served with the summons, complaint, notice of right to counsel, and the date, time, and place of the hearing.â€Â  The court, after hearing testimony from the investigative caseworker, found Michael was an abused and/or neglected child pursuant to section 20-7-490 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 1997).Â  The court further found Mother physically abused Michael by her lack of supervision and her failure to make arrangements for his care while she was in the hospital.Â  There are also allegations of drug abuse on the part of Mother.[3]Â  Moreover, the court found removal to be in Michaelâ€™s best interest.Â  The order was signed on November 17, 2004. According to DSS, the order was â€œprovidedâ€ to Mother the next day; Mother does not dispute this finding.Â  Mother did not appeal from this order.Â  \r\nOn November 18, 2004, the day after the merits order was signed, Mother was appointed an attorney in this action.Â  Notice of the appointment was mailed to Motherâ€™s counsel on November 22, 2004.Â  On November 30, 2004, Mother, through her attorney, filed an answer to the complaint for removal even though the hearing on removal had already been conducted.Â  The answer did not raise any issues regarding service of the complaint on Mother or relating to her lack of representation at the removal hearing.\r\nOn September 22, 2005, the family court held a permanency planning hearing and approved a plan for an extension of time for reunification of Michael and Mother.Â  This order was entered on October 4, 2005, and mailed to Mother on October 11, 2005.Â  Prior to the September 22, 2005 permanency planning hearing, Mother filed a Rule 59(e) motion with the family court order for the removal order of November 17, 2004.Â  The motion was filed on September 15, 2005, nearly ten months after the removal order was signed.Â  In the Rule 59(e) motion, Mother raised, for the first time, issues regarding service of process and representation.Â  At the hearing, both DSS and the guardian opposed the motion as untimely, arguing over ten months had elapsed between entry of the removal order and the Rule 59(e) motion, and that no appeal had been timely filed from that order.Â  The family court denied the motion on November 14, 2005.Â  \r\nMother appeals from the family courtâ€™s permanency planning order of October 4, 2005, and the order denying the Rule 59 (e) motion on November 14, 2005.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen considering an appeal from the family court, appellate courts have the authority to find the facts in accordance with their view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006).Â  However, appellate courts defer to the family court judgeâ€™s determinations of witnessesâ€™ credibility because the family court judge had the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses testify.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn her notice of appeal, Mother appeals from the October 4, 2005 family court order.Â  We find this appeal untimely.\r\nRule 203(b)(3) of the South Carolina Rules of Appellate Practice (2006) governs appeals from the family courts and states: â€œA notice of appeal in a domestic relations action shall be served in the same manner provided by Rule 203(b)(1).â€Â  That section provides, â€œA notice of appeal shall be served on all respondents within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment.â€Â  Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR.Â  \r\nIn this matter, Mother did not file an appeal of the October 4, 2005 order until November 30, 2005, forty-eight days after the Rule 203(b)(1) requirement.Â  Therefore, the appeal of that order is untimely.\r\nIn her notice of appeal, Mother also appeals from the November 14, 2005 family court order denying her Rule 59(e) motion of the November 17, 2004 removal order.Â  In the Rule 59(e) motion dated September 15, 2005, Mother raised, for the first time, issues regarding service of process of the complaint and her lack of representation at the merits removal hearing.Â  We find her Rule 59(e) motion was not timely filed with the family court.Â  \r\nRule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that â€œ[a] motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after receipt of written notice of the entry of the order.â€Â  This motion was filed some ten months after the order was entered on November 17, 2004, and provided to her the following day.Â  Therefore, the family court correctly denied the motion.Â  See also Ness v. Eckerd Corp., 350 S.C. 399, 563 S.E.2d 193 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding courts retain jurisdiction to alter judgments for ten days if a motion to alter or amend a judgment is filed; however, after ten days that jurisdiction is lost).\r\nMoreover, Mother includes in her statement of issues on appeal arguments relating to service of process and her lack of appointed counsel at the merits hearing.Â  However, the first argument in the brief is captioned: â€œEveryone is entitled to due process and â€˜the resistance to tyranny is obedience to God.â€™ Thomas Jefferson.â€Â  This section does not address either issue set out in the statement of issues on appeal.Â  It appears to be nothing but a recitation of the facts of the case.Â  Moreover, Mother failed to provide arguments or supporting authority for this assertion.Â  Thus, the issue is deemed abandoned on appeal. Â See e.g., First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting where a party fails to cite authority or where the argument is simply a conclusory statement, the party is deemed to have abandoned the issue).\r\nThe second argument in the brief combines the service of process issue and the representation issue into one argument.Â  Mother contends she was not properly served with the summons and complaint for the removal hearing, and that she was not represented at the removal hearing as required by section 20-7-110(B) of the South Carolina Code (2004).Â  We hold Mother waived those arguments.\r\nA party waives improper service as a defense by failing to raise the issue in his answer.Â  Rule 12(h), SCRCP; Garner v. Houck, 312 S.C. 481, 487, 435 S.E.2d 847, 850 (1993).Â  Here, Motherâ€™s answer, filed on November 30, 2004, was silent on the issue of service of process and her lack of representation at the merits hearing.Â  It was not until her untimely Rule 59(e) motion, filed on September 15, 2005, that Mother formally raised this issue.Â Â  Mother simply cannot fail to raise an issue in a responsive pleading filed with the family court, and then seek to raise those issues via a Rule 59(e) motion filed ten months after issuance of the merits order.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Motherâ€™s attorney did not raise the issue of her lack of representation until her untimely Rule 59(e) motion.Â  While we are mindful that Motherâ€™s attorney was not appointed to represent her until after the merits hearing had concluded, counselâ€™s failure to raise this issue in a timely fashion bars mother from arguing this issue on appeal.Â  See Clark v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 362 S.C. 377, 608 S.E.2d 573 (2005) (holding an unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case and precludes further consideration of the issue on appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the orders of the family court are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] This motion was captioned â€œmotion for rehearingâ€ by Motherâ€™s counsel.Â  Both the family court and DSS characterized the motion as a Rule 59(e) motion; however, the motion itself does not reference any of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  There is no indication in the argument before the family court that this motion should be construed as a Rule 60 motion to re-open the judgment.\r\n[2]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] It should be noted that in the July 14, 2005 review hearing the family court found Mother was recently hospitalized for trying to commit suicide by overdosing on her diabetes medicine.Â  Additionally, she had previously been incarcerated for intent to possess crack cocaine.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-313","title":"Uzenda v.

Hanna, of Myrtle Beach for Respondent Christopher Hanna; and Russell V. Traw, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondents Nancy and Michael Pittman.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this action by Jara Uzenda[1] for breach of trust with fraudulent intent, fraudulent conveyance, conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unjust enrichment, and breach of contract, the circuit court granted summary judgment to Christopher Hanna and Nancy and Michael\r\n  Pittman, and granted motions to dismiss as to both Scott Gobbi and Perry P. Reynolds.Â  Uzenda appeals.Â  We affirm. [2]  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 1999, Gobbi signed an exclusive right to sell agreement with Realty One for the sale of property he owned at 407 Chesterfield Court.Â  On January 7, 2000, Uzenda and Gobbi signed a contract (the Contract) to sell Unit 67 at 407 Chesterfield Court (the Property) to the Pittmans, with closing to occur on January 28, 2000.Â  The Pittmans agreed to pay $83,400 for the Property.Â  In addition, Uzenda signed a disclosure form consenting to Hanna, a real estate agent for Realty One, acting as a dual agent in the transaction.Â  Reynolds subsequently appraised the Property at $83,500.Â  \r\nOn January 28, 2000, Uzenda informed Gobbi, the Pittmans, and Hanna that she would not close on the Property for a variety of reasons, including past flooding problems and an existing lawsuit. Â On the same date, the Pittmans signed an addendum to the Contract acknowledging they were made aware of these problems.Â  Furthermore, Gobbi entered into an agreement giving the Pittmans permission to occupy the Property rent-free beginning on January 28, 2000.[3]Â  \r\nIn June, in an action separate from the present one, Gobbi sought and obtained an order of the family court requiring Uzenda to convey the Property to the Pittmans.Â  In August, Uzenda was held in contempt of this order, and subsequently conveyed the Property as a gift to Gobbi.Â  In the meantime, the Pittmans found another property to purchase and eventually vacated the Property.Â  A mortgage holder subsequently foreclosed on the Property, and the Property was sold in a foreclosure sale.Â  \r\nIn November, Uzenda filed a complaint in circuit court against the Pittmans, Hanna, Gobbi, and Reynolds alleging breach of trust with fraudulent intent, fraudulent conveyance, conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unjust enrichment, and breach of contract.Â  In February 2001, Uzenda made a written motion to join her action in magistrateâ€™s court against the Pittmans with the current action.Â  \r\nThe Honorable Judge James E. Brogdon, Jr. granted summary judgment to Hanna on October 26, 2001.Â  Uzenda filed a motion to alter or amend this order.Â  In December, Judge Brogdon denied Uzendaâ€™s motion to alter or amend, and Uzenda filed a second motion to alter or amend. Â Judge Brogdon also denied this motion.Â  Also in December, Judge Brogdon granted the motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(5) and (6), SCRCP, of both Gobbi and Reynolds.Â  \r\nIn July 2003, Uzenda and the Pittmans exchanged discovery requests.Â  On August 26, 2003, the Pittmans served Uzenda with a motion for summary judgment.Â  In January 2004, Uzenda made a written motion to postpone the hearing of the pending motions in front of Judge Edward B. Cottingham because, she alleged, a motion to reconsider was outstanding in front of Judge Brogdon.Â  Judge Cottingham held a hearing and granted Uzendaâ€™s motion, believing her allegation to be true. Judge Cottingham subsequently determined that he did in fact have jurisdiction over the matter and a new hearing was scheduled.Â  At the outset of the hearing, Uzenda moved to have the current case consolidated with the pending magistrateâ€™s action, which Uzenda alleged was on appeal to the circuit court after a ruling in favor of the Pittmans.Â  Judge Cottingham denied the motion.Â  On February 4, 2004, Judge Cottingham granted summary judgment to the Pittmans.Â  Uzenda filed a motion for reconsideration of this order, which Judge Cottingham denied.Â  Â Â This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Jurisdiction\r\nUzenda argues Rule 43(l), SCRCP, prevented Judge Cottingham from ruling on a matter in a case in which Judge Brogdon heard motions.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 43(l), SCRCP, provides: Â â€œ[i]f any motion be made to any judge and be denied, in whole or in part, or be granted conditionally, no subsequent motion upon the same state of facts shall be made to any other judge in that action.â€Â  In this case, Judge Cottingham did not hear or decide any motion that was denied or conditionally granted by Judge Brogdon.Â  Therefore, Rule 43(l) did not preclude Judge Cottingham from ruling on all motions before him.\r\nII. Magistrateâ€™s court action\r\nUzenda argues the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the Pittmanâ€™s motion for summary judgment because her claims for ejectment and back rent had been decided by the magistrateâ€™s court.Â  Uzenda did not provide a sufficient record on appeal for this court to determine whether any issue ruled upon by the trial court was heard before the magistrate.Â  See Hamilton v. Greyhound Lines E., 281 S.C. 442, 444, 316 S.E.2d 368, 369&nbsp;(1984) (â€œThe appealing party has the burden of furnishing a sufficient record from which this court can make an intelligent review.â€).Â  \r\nUzenda also argues the trial court erred in failing to consolidate the present action with an appeal from the magistrateâ€™s court involving the Pittmans.Â  Specifically, Uzenda argues the trial court should consolidate these actions under Rule 18(b), SCRCP. Â We disagree.\r\nâ€œConsolidation is within the broad discretion of the trial court.Â  The moving party has the burden of persuading the court that consolidation is desirable. Â An appellate court will not disturb a trial courtâ€™s ruling on a motion to consolidate absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Keels v. Pierce, 315 S.C. 339, 342, 433 S.E.2d 902, 904&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993) (internal citations omitted).\r\nRule 18(b) provides:\r\n\r\nWhenever a claim is one heretofore cognizable only after another claim has been prosecuted to a conclusion, the two claims may be joined in a single action; but the court shall grant relief in that action only in accordance with the relative substantive rights of the parties. In particular, a plaintiff may state a claim for money and a claim to have set aside a conveyance fraudulent as to him, without first having obtained a judgment establishing the claim for money.\r\n\r\nIn this case, Uzenda sets forth no reason why her present claim is cognizable only after her appeal from magistrateâ€™s court is prosecuted to its conclusion.Â  Therefore, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Uzendaâ€™s motion to consolidate.\r\nIII. Summary Judgment for Hanna and the Pittmans\r\nUzenda argues the trial court erred in granting Hanna and the Pittmansâ€™ motions for summary judgment.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA. Notice of Summary Judgment\r\nInitially, Uzenda argues she did not have sufficient notice of summary judgment as to either Hanna or the Pittmans.Â  We hold Uzenda received proper notice of summary judgment as to both Hanna and the Pittmans.Â  â€œIf, on a motion . . . to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the Court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.â€Â  Rule 12(b), SCRCP.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP, provides a motion for summary judgment must be served at least ten days prior to the time fixed for the hearing.Â  \r\nRule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, â€œspecifically provides for conversion, provided the parties, upon compliance with the notice provisions of Rule 56, are afforded a reasonable opportunity to introduce evidentiary matters.â€Â  Johnson v. Dailey, 318 S.C. 318, 321, 457 S.E.2d 613, 615&nbsp;(1995).Â  In Dailey, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that when outside materials are attached to a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, and the outside materials are referred to in the motion, a party is put on notice that the motion will be one for summary judgment.Â  Id.; see also, Martin v. Companion Healthcare Corp., 357 S.C. 570, 575, 593 S.E.2d 624, 627&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  Uzendaâ€™s pro se status does not alter the rule set forth in Dailey.Â  A pro se litigant assumes responsibility of complying with all procedural and substantive requirements.Â  State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, 265 n.5, 589 S.E.2d 6, 9 n.5 (2003) (â€œA pro se litigant who knowingly elects to represent himself assumes full responsibility for complying with substantive and procedural requirements of the law.â€).\r\nHanna filed a motion to dismiss, attaching to it matters outside the pleadings, on December 27, 2000, and the trial court held a hearing on June 20, 2001.Â  Therefore, we hold under Dailey Uzenda had sufficient notice Hannaâ€™s motion would be converted to one for summary judgment.Â  In addition, with respect to the Pittmansâ€™ motion, Uzenda had over four months notice of the motion, which was partly captioned â€œFOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.â€Â  Accordingly we find no error in the trial court hearing the motions for summary judgment.Â  \r\nB. Sufficient Discovery\r\nUzenda argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to both Hanna and the Pittmans because she did not have sufficient time to conduct discovery.Â  We disagree.\r\nSummary judgment must not be granted until the opposing party has had a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,&nbsp;306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543&nbsp;(1991). Â In Baughman, the Supreme Court of South Carolina expressly cited two factors to be considered in determining whether the party opposing summary judgment has had a â€œfull and fair opportunity to complete discovery.â€Â  First, the party must â€œdemonstrate a likelihood that further discovery will uncover additional evidence relevant to the issue . . . and they are not merely engaged in a â€˜fishing expedition.â€™â€Â  Id. at 112, 410 S.E.2d at 543.Â  Second, the party must demonstrate it was not dilatory in seeking discovery on the particular issue.Â  Id. at 113, 410 S.E.2d at 544.Â  \r\nWith respect to both Hanna and the Pittmans, Uzenda argues she is entitled to discovery and the information discovered will support the allegations of her complaint.Â  However, she does not allege specifically what evidence, if any, she seeks.Â  As Uzenda has failed to â€œdemonstrate a likelihood that further discovery will uncover evidence relevant to the issue[,]â€ we hold the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment without allowing for further discovery.Â  \r\nC. Genuine Issues of Material Fact\r\nAlthough Uzenda argues several procedural grounds for reversing the trial courtâ€™s orders granting summary judgment to Hanna and the Pittmans, the only argument she makes with respect to whether there are genuine issues of material fact that would preclude summary judgment for either Hanna or the Pittmans is to restate the allegations in her complaint as a factual introduction to her procedural arguments.Â  She does not assert what causes of action, if any, she thinks are cognizable at trial, and she does not cite any case law in support of why the facts alleged, taken in a light most favorable to her, support a cause of action.Â  Therefore, Uzenda abandoned this issue on appeal with respect to both Hanna and the Pittmans.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514&nbsp;(1994) (holding when an appellant does not argue or provide supporting authority for his assertion, he abandons the assertion on appeal); R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 437, 540 S.E.2d 113, 120 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding that where no authority is cited and argument in brief is conclusory, issue is deemed abandoned).\r\nIV. Gobbi and Reynolds[4]\r\nInitially, Uzenda asserts she was not given sufficient notice of what motions Gobbi and Reynolds were making.Â  However, these motions are not included in the record, and â€œthe appealing party has the burden of furnishing a sufficient record from which this court can make an intelligent review.â€Â  Hamilton v. Greyhound Lines E., 281 S.C. 442, 444, 316 S.E.2d 368, 369&nbsp;(1984).Â  \r\nUzenda next argues the trial court erred in granting the motions of both Gobbi and Reynolds for insufficiency of service of process.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 4(d)(8), SCRCP, provides service of process may be made on individuals â€œby registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and delivery restricted to the addressee.â€Â  Uzendaâ€™s certificate of service with respect to her complaint provides she â€œservedâ€ Gobbi and Reynolds â€œby delivering said documents to [them] at their appropriate addresse[s] via facsimile and by certified mail.â€Â  Uzenda has not produced evidence she requested return receipt or restricted delivery to the addressee.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court properly held Uzenda failed to effect service of process on Gobbi and Reynolds.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold Judge Cottingham had jurisdiction to hear the motions before him.Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Uzendaâ€™s motion to consolidate the present case with an appeal from a magistrateâ€™s action against the Pittmans.Â  We further hold Uzenda had proper notice of all motions and the trial court properly granted Hannaâ€™s motion for summary judgment, the Pittmansâ€™ motion for summary judgment, Gobbiâ€™s motions to dismiss, and Reynoldsâ€™ motions to dismiss.Â  Therefore, the orders of the trial court are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and CURETON, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1]Although the current status of the relationship is unclear, Jara Uzenda is or was married to Scott Gobbi, and is referred to in the record as both Jara Uzenda and Jara Uzenda Gobbi.Â  For our purposes, she will be referred to as Uzenda.\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3]Uzenda later filed an action for ejectment against the Pittmans in magistrateâ€™s court.Â  \r\n[4] Gobbi and Reynolds did not file timely briefs on appeal.Â  However, we deem it proper to address this issue on appeal.Â  See Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR (â€œUpon failure of respondent to timely file a brief, the appellate court may take such action as it deems proper.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
