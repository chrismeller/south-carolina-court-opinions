Henderson, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2012-UP-054  \r\n  Heard December 6, 2011 – Filed February 1,\r\n2012\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Robert N. Rosen, of Charleston, and Cynthia\r\n          B. Patterson, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        J. Anthony Floyd and Rob F. Gardner, III,\r\n          both of Hartsville, and Marian D. Nettles, of Lake City, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Karen Allen-Hines appeals several\r\n  decisions the family court made on remand from this court.  See Allen-Hines\r\n    v. Hines, Op. No. 2008-UP-198 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Mar. 20, 2008).  We affirm\r\n  in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\n1.&nbsp; Karen argues the family court\r\n  erred in awarding her rehabilitative alimony instead of permanent periodic\r\n  alimony.  We agree.  The purpose of awarding rehabilitative alimony is &quot;to\r\n  encourage a dependent spouse to become self-supporting by providing alimony for\r\n  a limited period of time during which the dependent spouse might retrain and\r\n  rehabilitate himself or herself thereby limiting the duration of the time in\r\n  which the supporting spouse is burdened by spousal support.&quot;  Eagerton\r\n    v. Eagerton, 285 S.C. 279, 282, 328 S.E.2d 912, 914 (Ct. App. 1985).  Here,\r\n  however, the family court found Karen &quot;is very able to work,&quot; &quot;does\r\n  not need any training in order to secure employment,&quot; and &quot;does not\r\n  need any additional time to acquire job skills in that she presently has more\r\n  than adequate job skills.&quot;  We conclude the family court erred in awarding\r\n  rehabilitative alimony to someone it found needed no rehabilitation.  Further, having conducted our own review\r\n  of the record, we find no special circumstances warranting rehabilitative\r\n  alimony.  See Canady v. Canady, 296 S.C. 521, 525, 374 S.E.2d 502, 504 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988) (&quot;Rehabilitative alimony may be awarded only upon a showing of\r\n  special circumstances justifying a departure from the normal preference for\r\n  permanent, periodic support.&quot;).  We therefore reverse the family court's decision awarding Karen\r\n  rehabilitative alimony and denying her permanent periodic alimony.\r\nThis is the\r\n  second appeal in this case.  In the first appeal, we concluded Karen &quot;is\r\n  entitled to permanent periodic alimony, unless a showing is made of special\r\n  circumstances justifying rehabilitative alimony.&quot;  Our determination in\r\n  the present appeal that the record contains no such circumstances leaves an\r\n  award of permanent periodic alimony as the only outcome available under the law\r\n  of this case.  On remand, the family court shall make written findings of fact under\r\n  the factors listed in subsection 20-3-130(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) and award Karen an\r\n  appropriate amount of permanent periodic alimony.  \r\n2.&nbsp;Karen argues the family court\r\n  erred in awarding attorney's fees without making specific findings explaining\r\n  its basis for the amount of the award.  We agree.  The family court's only\r\n  explanation for the award was that it had reviewed &quot;the record herein,\r\n  arguments of counsel[,] and the directions from the Court of Appeals.&quot;  Because\r\n  this statement identifies no specific basis for the amount of the award, the family\r\n  court abused its discretion.  See Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C.\r\n  289, 304, 372 S.E.2d 107, 115 (Ct. App. 1988) (&quot;A decision lacking a\r\n  discernable reason is arbitrary and constitutes an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;).  \r\nIn the first appeal, we instructed the family court to\r\n  award attorney's fees after making &quot;specific findings as to the factors\r\n  expressed in&quot; E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812\r\n  (1992), Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991), and Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 320 S.E.2d 706 (1984).  The family\r\n  court's order contains no such findings.  We reiterate our previous instructions. \r\n  On remand, the family court shall make written findings of fact under the factors\r\n  in E.D.M., Glasscock, and Mitchell, and award attorney's\r\n  fees in an amount appropriate under those factors.\r\n3. Karen argues\r\n  post-judgment interest should accrue on the family court's $11,025.00 interest\r\n  award until Franklin pays it.  Because the family court did not make a ruling regarding\r\n  whether interest accrues on this award, this issue is not preserved.  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It\r\n  is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but\r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.&quot;).  \r\n4.&nbsp;Finally, Karen argues\r\n  the family court erred in refusing to hold Franklin in contempt.  We affirm\r\n  pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: Browder v. Browder, 382 S.C. 512, 521, 675\r\n  S.E.2d 820, 824-25 (Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;[A] decision regarding contempt is\r\n  not subject to reversal absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;); Tirado v.\r\n    Tirado, 339 S.C. 649, 654, 530 S.E.2d 128, 131 (Ct. App. 2000) (&quot;Contempt\r\n  is a consequence of the willful disobedience of a court order.&quot;\r\n  (emphasis added)).\r\nThe judgment of\r\n  the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-055","title":"State v.

Hall, of West Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Jane Harden Stone appeals the ruling of the\r\n  Master in Equity granting a 20 foot wide easement to John D. Austin over,\r\n  through and across Stone's property.  We affirm.\r\n1) As to Stone's\r\n  argument that the master erred in establishing the width of the prescriptive\r\n  easement at 20 feet, no evidence was presented that the width should be 12.5\r\n  feet and plats were presented that showed the easement was 20 feet.\r\n2) As to Stone's\r\n  argument that the master erred in finding Austin's use of the drive was not\r\n  permissive, there was sufficient evidence for the master to find a prescriptive\r\n  easement by claim of right for Austin.  The totality of circumstances\r\n  established his claim of right.  See Hartley v. John Wesley United\r\n    Methodist Church of John's Island, 355 S.C. 145, 151, 584 S.E.2d 386, 389 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2003) (stating that for a party to earn a prescriptive easement under\r\n  claim of right he must show that he had the right to use the road based on\r\n  totality of the circumstances).\r\n3) As to Stone's\r\n  argument that the master erred in finding that Austin showed continuous and\r\n  uninterrupted use of the entire driveway for 20 years, the master found that\r\n  the requirement of 20 years continuous use had been met by Austin since he\r\n  purchased the property in 1980.  See Matthews v. Dennis, 365 S.C.\r\n  245, 249, 616 S.E.2d 437, 439 (Ct. App. 2005) (stating that the establishment\r\n  of a prescriptive easement requires the continued and uninterrupted use of the\r\n  right for 20 years).  The determination of the existence of an easement is a\r\n  question of fact in an action at law.  See Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160,\r\n  165, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541 (2006) (stating the existence of an easement is\r\n  determined by an action at law).  The findings of the judge in a case at law\r\n  will not be disturbed upon appeal without evidence to support the judge's\r\n  finding.  See Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266\r\n  S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (stating findings of fact by a judge\r\n  are not disturbed on appeal unless found to be without evidence to support the\r\n  findings).\r\n\r\n4) As to Stone's\r\n  argument that the terminus of the easement was owned by SCE&amp;G, there was no\r\n  finding by the master on this issue therefore it was not preserved for appeal.  See Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d\r\n  772, 779-80 (2004) (stating that an issue must be raised and ruled on to be\r\n  preserved for appeal).\r\n5) The final\r\n  argument by Stone was that the master erred in granting a prescriptive easement\r\n  because the evidence showed that the easement did not have one of its termini\r\n  in the dominant property.  Stone did not\r\n  ask the master to hold that if an easement did exist, it was in gross rather\r\n  than appurtenant.  Accordingly, the master did not need to consider whether the\r\n  easement had one terminus on Austin's land.  See Windham v. Riddle,\r\n  381 S.C. 192, 201-202, 672 S.E.2d 578, 583 (2009) (stating &quot;an appurtenant\r\n  easement inheres in the land, concerns the premises, has one terminus on the\r\n  land of the party claiming it, and is essentially necessary to the enjoyment\r\n  thereof,&quot; and &quot;[u]nless an easement has all the elements necessary to\r\n  be an appurtenant easement, it will be characterized as a mere easement in\r\n  gross.&quot;).  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-061","title":"Singleton v.

Wilson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Stanford\r\n  Lavelle Brown appeals his conviction for trafficking in cocaine base.  He\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in admitting (1) his jailhouse telephone\r\n  conversations and (2) drug evidence after two witnesses involved in the chain\r\n  of custody did not testify at trial and a labeling error was discovered.  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\n1. We find the circuit\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in admitting several jailhouse telephone\r\n  conversations between Brown and a confidant placing Brown at the scene of the\r\n  crime.  Specifically, the statements made by Brown are admissions excluded from\r\n  the definition of hearsay.  See Rule\r\n  801(d)(2)(A), SCRE.  Moreover, the relevant utterances of his confidant were\r\n  neither assertions nor offered for their truth.[2]  See Rules 801(a) &amp; (c), SCRE.  All other statements made by Brown's\r\n  confidant were harmless in light of Brown's admissions.  See State v.\r\n  Liverman, 386 S.C. 223, 233-34, 687 S.E.2d 70, 75 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding\r\n  that reversal of a circuit court's ruling to admit or exclude evidence requires\r\n  prejudice to the defendant).\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;We find the circuit\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the drugs into evidence.  The\r\n  absence of two witnesses who handled the drugs is not fatal to the chain of\r\n  custody, even in light of remedied clerical errors that occurred earlier in the\r\n  chain.\r\nIn order to admit drugs into\r\n  evidence, the State &quot;must establish a complete chain of custody as far as\r\n  practicable.&quot;  State v. Sweet, 374 S.C. 1, 6, 647 S.E.2d 202, 205\r\n  (2007).  Who had handled the drugs and what was done with them must not be left\r\n  to conjecture.  Id.  The South Carolina Supreme Court, however, has\r\n  retreated from &quot;inflexible rules regarding the chain of custody and the\r\n  admissibility of evidence,&quot; giving the circuit court more discretion in\r\n  ruling on the admissibility of fungible evidence.  State v. Hatcher, 392\r\n  S.C. 86, 94, 708 S.E.2d 750, 754 (2011).  First, each custodian in the chain\r\n  need not testify &quot;[w]here other evidence establishes the identity of those\r\n  who have handled the [drugs] and reasonably demonstrates the manner of handling\r\n  of [them].&quot;  Id. at 91, 708 S.E.2d at 753.  Indeed, &quot;[i]t is\r\n  unnecessary . . . that the police account for every hand-to-hand\r\n  transfer.&quot;  Id. at 94, 708 S.E.2d at 754 (emphasis added) (internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted).  Second, as long as the chain is sufficiently\r\n  complete, the State need not &quot;negate all possibility of tampering.&quot;  Id. at 92, 708 S.E.2d at 753.  Courts, though, will not fill gaps &quot;where there\r\n  is a missing link in the chain of possession because the identity of those who\r\n  handled the [drugs] was not established at least as far as practicable.&quot;  Id. (emphasis removed).\r\nHere, the State identified\r\n  each witness who handled the drugs, and only two did not testify.  One witness,\r\n  a State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) technician, merely accepted the drugs from\r\n  investigators and placed them into the vault.  Another SLED technician merely\r\n  served as a go-between, transferring the evidence between vaults, to and from\r\n  the analyst, and ultimately back to investigators.  The SLED analyst explained\r\n  the role each technician had in handling the drugs and testified she found no\r\n  sign of tampering.  Hatcher involved similar procedures at SLED, where evidence\r\n  was logged and handled by technicians other than the analyst who performed the\r\n  testing.  Id. at 90 n.1, 708 S.E.2d at 752 n.1.  Given the supreme\r\n  court's position that these technicians had &quot;fleeting contact with the\r\n  evidence,&quot; we find the circuit court here properly exercised its\r\n  discretion against &quot;unnecessary logistical problems concerning chain of\r\n  custody.&quot;  Id. at 94, 708 S.E.2d at 754.\r\nWe also find the clerical\r\n  errors made by investigators were remedied to the extent the drugs remained\r\n  properly identifiable.  See id. at 95, 708 S.E.2d at 755 (&quot;The\r\n  ultimate goal of chain of custody requirements is simply to ensure that the\r\n  item is what it is purported to be.&quot;).  Each witness involved in\r\n  correcting the errors testified about how they handled the drugs.  Moreover, we\r\n  note the evidence shows the remedied errors of the investigators are\r\n  unconnected to the SLED technicians' handling of the drugs, and we find the\r\n  errors did not necessitate the technicians' testimony.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER, and LOCKEMY,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Brown also argues the admission of his confidant's\r\n  utterances violated his right to confront witnesses.  This issue, however, was\r\n  never ruled on by the circuit court and is thus not preserved for our review.  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003) (&quot;In\r\n  order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the [circuit court].&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-064","title":"Glover v.

Ducker, and Commercial Refrigeration, LLC, (collectively\r\n  &quot;the Duckers&quot;) filed suit, complaining Stamper's fence obstructed\r\n  their existing easement.  The master entered judgment in Stamper's favor.  The\r\n  Duckers appeal, arguing the master erred in finding they are bound by a 1997\r\n  road closure action, have no public or private right in the portion of the road\r\n  that was closed, and have no easement implied by prior use.  We affirm pursuant\r\n  to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:  \r\n1. As to the 1997 road closure\r\n  action[1]: S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  § 57-9-10 (2006) (providing &quot;[a]ny interested person&quot; may initiate a\r\n  road closure action and requiring notice thereof to be &quot;sent by mail\r\n  requiring a return receipt to the last known address of all abutting property\r\n  owners whose property would be affected by any such change&quot;); Rule 19(a),\r\n  SCRCP (requiring a trial court to join a person as a party if &quot;in his\r\n  absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties&quot; or\r\n  &quot;he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action&quot; and his\r\n  absence from it might impair his ability to protect that interest).  \r\n2. As to a private\r\n  easement by dedication: Inlet Harbour\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Parks, Recreation &amp; Tourism, 377 S.C. 86, 91-92, 659 S.E.2d 151, 154 (2008)\r\n  (recognizing an implied easement as an expression of a grantor's intent to convey\r\n  along with transferred property &quot;whatever is necessary for the property's\r\n  use and enjoyment&quot; but finding implied easements are not favored &quot;because\r\n  the implication of an easement in a conveyance goes against the general rule\r\n  that a written instrument speaks for itself&quot; and recognizing easements by\r\n  dedication are created &quot;when an owner conveys subdivided lots and\r\n  references the plat in the deed,&quot; thereby granting &quot;the lot owners an\r\n  easement over the streets appearing in the plat&quot; (citations omitted)); Murrells\r\n    Inlet Corp. v.

As to a\r\n  public easement by dedication: Outlaw\r\n    v. Moise, 222 S.C. 24, 30-31, 71\r\n  S.E.2d 509, 511-12 (1952) (holding a public easement by dedication is not\r\n  complete until some manifestation of public acceptance occurs and stating such\r\n  public acceptance need not be given formally but may be manifested by public\r\n  action within a reasonable time[2]); Baugus v.

Neville,\r\n  310 S.C. 323, 426 S.E.2d 773 (1993), stood for the proposition, &quot;The only\r\n  indispensable parties to a road closing are the public entities that may be\r\n  charged with its maintenance.&quot;  It does not.  BancOhio indicates a\r\n  public entity holding a &quot;proprietary interest&quot; in a road, including\r\n  an easement or a right of way, is an indispensable party to a closure\r\n  action, but not the only such party.  Id. at at 329, 426 S.E.2d at 777. \r\n  However, this error does not affect the disposition of the Duckers' appeal.  \r\n[2] See, e.g., Huxfield Cemetery Ass'n v.

Osborne, 335 S.C. 172, 175, 516 S.E.2d 201,\r\n  202 (1999) (footnotes omitted).  \r\nSufficient independent\r\n  evidence corroborated Person's statement that the twelve-and-a-half-month-old\r\n  boy (Victim) in her care died as a result of her actions.  See id. at 180, 516 S.E.2d at 205 (&quot;[T]he corroboration rule is satisfied if the\r\n  State provides sufficient independent evidence which serves to corroborate the\r\n  defendant's extra-judicial statements and, together with such statements,\r\n  permits a reasonable belief that the crime occurred.&quot;).  The evidence\r\n  established Victim was in Person's sole custody at the time of his death.  Victim's\r\n  mother testified Victim did not exhibit any signs of illness at the time she\r\n  dropped Victim off at Person's house.  Expert witnesses affirmed Victim died\r\n  within an interval of time too short for the pneumonia found in his lungs to\r\n  have been the cause of his death.  The expert witnesses contended the minimal\r\n  or small amount of pneumonia found in Victim's lungs was insufficient to cause\r\n  death, with an additional consideration being the lack of pneumonia symptoms. \r\n  Physical evidence found at the time of Victim's autopsy was consistent with a\r\n  cause of death of asphyxia by suffocation.  Viewing the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the State, sufficient\r\n  evidence proved Victim did not die a natural death.  See State v.\r\n    Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 138, 551 S.E.2d 240, 253 (2001) (holding the trial\r\n  court properly denied Saltz's motion for a directed verdict when circumstantial\r\n  evidence existed to prove the victim did not die a natural death,\r\n  notwithstanding Saltz's argument that the facts were equally consistent with\r\n  death by accident or sudden illness).  Therefore, the trial court properly\r\n  submitted the case to the jury.  See Osborne, 335 S.C. at 180,\r\n  516 S.E.2d at 205 (&quot;If there is any evidence tending to establish the corpus\r\n    delicti, then it is the trial court's duty to pass that question on to the\r\n  jury.&quot;).\r\n2. We hold the trial court properly denied Person's motion for a\r\n  mistrial because the officer's testimony was not prejudicial to Person.  &quot;The\r\n  decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court. The trial court's decision will not be overturned on appeal absent\r\n  an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.&quot;  State v. Wilson,\r\n  389 S.C. 579, 585, 698 S.E.2d 862, 865 (Ct. App. 2010) (citation and internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted).  &quot;A mistrial should only be granted when\r\n  absolutely necessary, and a defendant must show both error and\r\n  prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial.&quot;  Id. at 585-86,\r\n  698 S.E.2d at 865.  &quot;The power of the trial court to declare a mistrial\r\n  should be used with the greatest caution under urgent circumstances and for\r\n  very plain and obvious reasons stated on the record by the trial court.&quot;  State\r\n    v. Wiley, 387 S.C. 490, 495, 692 S.E.2d 560, 563 (Ct. App. 2010).\r\nThe officer confirmed he had\r\n  further contact with Person on the day she gave the written statement but not\r\n  for any matter concerning Victim's death.  The State did not introduce any\r\n  evidence regarding the reason for the additional contact, and no bad acts or\r\n  other charges were referenced during the trial.  Even if the jury inferred she\r\n  committed another bad act from the officer's statement, Person was not\r\n  prejudiced because the State never attempted to prove she committed another bad\r\n  act.  See Wiley, 387 S.C. at 496, 692 S.E.2d at 563 (finding not\r\n  prejudicial the State's mention of Wiley's unrelated outstanding warrant during\r\n  opening statements, &quot;even if the jury inferred\r\n  that Wiley committed another crime . . . because the State never attempted to\r\n  prove Wiley was convicted of some other crime&quot;).  Therefore, the\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Person's motion for a\r\n  mistrial.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER, and LOCKEMY,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-069","title":"State v.

Weston, 367\r\n  S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).  &quot;When reviewing a denial of a\r\n  directed verdict, [an appellate court] views the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to the [S]tate.&quot;  Id.  An\r\n  appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury if any\r\n  direct or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tends to prove the\r\n  guilt of the accused.  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.  \r\n&quot;Any person who\r\n  knowingly sells, manufactures, cultivates, delivers, purchases, or brings into\r\n  this State, or who provides financial assistance or otherwise aids, abets, attempts,\r\n  or conspires to sell, manufacture, cultivate, deliver, purchase, or bring into\r\n  this State, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession or who\r\n  knowingly attempts to become in actual or constructive possession of . . . ten\r\n  pounds or more of marijuana is guilty of     . . . 'trafficking in marijuana.'&quot; \r\n  S.C.

Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620, 624,\r\n  677 S.E.2d 603, 605 (2009).  &quot;Knowledge can be proven by the evidence of\r\n  acts, declarations, or conduct of the accused from which the inference may be\r\n  drawn that the accused knew of the existence of the prohibited substances.&quot;  Id.  &quot;[E]vidence of weapons may be relevant to show intent in a\r\n  drug prosecution.&quot;  State v. Wilson, 315 S.C. 289, 295, 433 S.E.2d\r\n  864, 868 (1993).\r\nHere, the State presented substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence tending to prove Ontiverous's guilt when viewed, together with all\r\n  reasonable inferences, in the light most favorable to the State.  Testimony\r\n  established Ontiverous's connection with the person who organized the delivery\r\n  of a marijuana package.  Ontiverous drove his truck from Greenville to a\r\n  meeting with a person (Witness) who knew the delivery address in Duncan for a\r\n  package containing marijuana.  Ontiverous's passenger was someone connected\r\n  with the organizer.  Moreover, the officers found a gun in the cocked position,\r\n  ready to fire, in Ontiverous's waistband and a cooler containing a set of\r\n  digital scales and plastic baggies in his truck.  Officers testified that most\r\n  of the &quot;trafficking level offenders in the narcotics business&quot; are\r\n  armed and digital scales and plastic baggies are used to separate a large\r\n  quantity of drugs into individual bags.  \r\nFurthermore, Ontiverous's\r\n  acts and conduct permit an inference he knew of the existence of marijuana in\r\n  the package.  Specifically, Ontiverous backed his truck into the driveway of\r\n  the house where the package was located instead of pulling forward.  An officer\r\n  testified this maneuver is known for allowing a fast departure.  Additionally, Ontiverous\r\n  did not remain in his truck but followed his passenger and Witness behind the\r\n  house where Witness had placed the marijuana package.  Therefore, the trial\r\n  court properly submitted the case to the jury.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER, and LOCKEMY,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-070","title":"State v.

Wise,\r\n  359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475, 478 (2004).  A lay witness's testimony in the\r\n  form of an opinion or inference is admissible only if (a) it is\r\n  &quot;rationally based on the perception of the witness,&quot; (b) it is\r\n  &quot;helpful to a clear understanding of the witness'[s] testimony or the\r\n  determination of a fact in issue,&quot; and (c) it does &quot;not require\r\n  special knowledge, skill, experience or training.&quot;  Rule 701, SCRE. \r\n  &quot;If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the\r\n  trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a\r\n  witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\r\n  education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.&quot; \r\n  Rule 702, SCRE.\r\n&quot;[A]n insubstantial\r\n  error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent\r\n  evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.&quot;  State\r\n    v.

Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011).  &quot;In appeals\r\n  from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the facts\r\n  in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;&nbsp; Ex\r\n    parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006).  &quot;If the\r\n  court determines at the permanency planning hearing that the child may be\r\n  safely maintained in the home in that the parent has remedied the conditions\r\n  that caused the removal and the return of the child to the child's parent would\r\n  not cause an unreasonable risk of harm to the child's life, physical health,\r\n  safety, or mental well-being, the court shall order the child returned to the\r\n  child's parent.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-1700(D) (Supp. 2010).  \r\nWe find the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence supports returning Child to J.W.'s custody as there is no\r\n  unreasonable risk of harm.  The examining psychologist and the Guardians ad\r\n  Litem testified they believe it is unsafe for Child to return to J.W.'s custody\r\n  primarily because of the potential for an incident in which she becomes\r\n  disabled due to her health concerns and is unable to care for Child.  We find these\r\n  concerns to be speculative and based on J.W.'s general condition and one unique\r\n  incident involving an adverse medication reaction.  The potential for any such\r\n  incident is further reduced by the fact that several members of J.W.'s family live\r\n  nearby, J.W. has a home health aide who is at her home approximately\r\n  forty-eight hours a week, and J.W. has a lifeline alert device linking her to\r\n  the hospital.  The psychologist testified J.W. was able to care for Child's\r\n  daily needs and, furthermore, Child has regularly spent extended periods of\r\n  time at J.W.'s home without incident.  Moreover, no one involved has doubted\r\n  that J.W. provides a loving home for Child and any threat of harm to Child is\r\n  speculative and not unreasonable.  Furthermore, in our view, returning Child to\r\n  J.W.'s custody is in Child's best interest and would achieve permanence in\r\n  Child's life.  See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129,\r\n  133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding the best interests of the\r\n  child are the paramount consideration).  In sum, we believe the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence supports returning Child to J.W.'s home and order the\r\n  Department of Social Services to continue providing supervision and services\r\n  for six months from the date of filing of this opinion.&nbsp; In addition, the\r\n  Guardians ad Litem shall continue to monitor the situation for six months from\r\n  the date of filing of this opinion.\r\nOur determination on the\r\n  initial issue is dispositive; thus, we decline to address any remaining\r\n  issues.  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1999) (holding this court need not review remaining issues on appeal\r\n  when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nREVERSED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-074","title":"McDaniels v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W.\r\n          Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Mark R. Farthing, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  James\r\n  Robert Nash appeals his convictions of criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a\r\n  minor, first degree, and lewd act on a minor under sixteen years of age.  Nash\r\n  argues the trial court erred in: (1) denying his request for a continuance in\r\n  order to reevaluate his competency; (2) qualifying an expert witness; (3)\r\n  allowing the solicitor to testify in his closing argument regarding evidence\r\n  not admitted during trial; and (4) admitting evidence of two other bad acts. \r\n  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n1. As to the\r\n  continuance: A trial court's decision on a motion for continuance or a request to\r\n  order a competency evaluation is within the trial court's discretion, and the\r\n  decision will not be overturned on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of\r\n  that discretion.  State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 364, 535 S.E.2d 420, 426 (2000)\r\n  (competency); State v. Babb, 299 S.C. 451,\r\n  454, 385 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1989) (continuance).  The test for determining\r\n  competency to stand trial is whether the defendant has sufficient present\r\n  ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational\r\n  understanding and whether he has a rational and factual understanding of the\r\n  proceedings against him.  State v. Weik, 356 S.C. 76, 81, 587 S.E.2d\r\n  683, 685 (2002); see State v. Colden, 372 S.C. 428, 441-42, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 912, 920 (Ct. App. 2007) (finding no abuse of discretion by the trial\r\n  court in not ordering a competency examination where defendant's voir dire with\r\n  the court conclusively revealed defendant's ability to answer questions\r\n  rationally and appropriately, and defendant demonstrated a manifest\r\n  understanding of the proceedings, the roles of the participants, and the\r\n  charges he was facing).  We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial\r\n  of a continuance in order to reevaluate Nash's competency. \r\n2. As to the\r\n  qualification of the expert: The qualification of a witness as an expert\r\n  is a matter largely within the trial court's discretion.  State\r\n    v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 255, 391 S.E.2d 551, 554 (1990).  &quot;If scientific, technical, or other specialized\r\n  knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\r\n  determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\r\n  education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.&quot; \r\n  Rule 702, SCRE.  &quot;Generally, defects in the amount and quality of an expert's education or experience go to the weight to be\r\n  accorded the expert's testimony and not to its\r\n  admissibility.&quot;  State v. Morris,\r\n  376 S.C. 189, 203, 656 S.E.2d 359, 367&nbsp;(2008).  We find no abuse of\r\n  discretion in the trial court's qualification of the expert.\r\n3. As to the\r\n  solicitor's closing argument: The trial\r\n  court has broad discretion in ruling on the propriety of closing arguments, and\r\n  ordinarily the ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.  State v. Patterson,\r\n  324 S.C. 5, 17, 482 S.E.2d 760, 766 (1997).  The appellate court will review\r\n  the argument in the context of the entire record.  Id.  &quot;The\r\n  relevant question is whether the solicitor's comments so infected the trial\r\n  with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due\r\n  process.&quot;  Humphries v. State, 351 S.C. 362, 373, 570 S.E.2d 160,\r\n  166 (2002).  We affirm the trial court's ruling on the propriety of the\r\n  solicitor's closing argument.\r\n4. As to the admission\r\n  of other bad acts: &quot;Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not\r\n  admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in\r\n  conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible to show motive, identity,\r\n  the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident,\r\n  or intent.&quot;  Rule 404(b), SCRE.  &quot;If the defendant was not convicted\r\n  of the prior crime, evidence of the prior bad act must be clear and\r\n  convincing.&quot;  State v. Gaines, 380 S.C. 23, 29, 667 S.E.2d 728, 731\r\n  (2008).  When considering whether there is clear and convincing evidence of\r\n  other bad acts, the appellate court is bound by the trial court's factual\r\n  findings unless they are clearly erroneous.  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C.\r\n  1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).  &quot;Even if prior bad act evidence is\r\n  clear and convincing and falls within [the common scheme or plan] exception, it\r\n  must be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\n  danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.&quot;  Gaines, 380 S.C. at\r\n  29, 667 S.E.2d at 731.  \r\n&quot;To be admissible [under\r\n  the common scheme or plan exception], the bad act must logically relate to the\r\n  crime with which the defendant has been charged.&quot;  Id.  The factors\r\n  to consider in determining whether there is a close degree of similarity\r\n  between the other bad act and the crime charged in a sexual abuse case are: \r\n  &quot;(1) the age of the victims when the abuse occurred; (2) the relationship\r\n  between the victims and the perpetrator; (3) the location where the abuse\r\n  occurred; (4) the use of coercion or threats; and (5) the manner of the\r\n  occurrence, for example, the type of sexual battery.&quot;  State v. Wallace, 384 S.C. 428, 433, 683 S.E.2d 275, 278 (2009).  The\r\n  common scheme or plan exception is generally applied in cases of criminal\r\n  sexual conduct where alleged incidents of abuse both before and after the\r\n  charged act are admissible to show continuing or escalating illicit intercourse\r\n  between the same parties.  State v. Mathis, 359 S.C. 450, 463-64, 597\r\n  S.E.2d 872, 879 (Ct. App. 2004) (admitting evidence of three earlier assaults\r\n  on the victim where they were attempted in the same manner and under similar\r\n  circumstances); id. at 464, 597 S.E.2d at 879 (quoting State v.\r\n    Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 328, 580 S.E.2d 186, 191 (Ct. App. 2003)) (&quot;Sex\r\n  crimes may be unique in this respect because they commonly involve the same\r\n  victims engaged in repeated incidents occurring under very similar\r\n  circumstances.  The reason for the general admissibility of such evidence under\r\n  these circumstances is self-evident – where there is a pattern of continuous\r\n  conduct shown, that pattern clearly supports the inference of the existence of\r\n  a common scheme or plan, thus bolstering the probability that the charged act\r\n  occurred in a similar fashion.&quot;).  We affirm the trial court's ruling that\r\n  the evidence was admissible under the common scheme or plan exception, was\r\n  demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence, and that the probative value of\r\n  the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS,\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.        \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-076","title":"McGowin v.

She now contends the family court erred in treating her alimony award\r\n  as rehabilitative, terminating her alimony award, and denying her request for\r\n  attorney's fees.  We affirm\r\n  pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authority:\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;As to whether the family court\r\n    improperly treated the award of alimony as rehabilitative rather than permanent\r\n    and periodic, we find the issue is not preserved for our review.  Foster v.\r\n      Foster, 393 S.C. 95, 99, 711 S.E.2d 878, 880 (2011) (stating that &quot;[i]n\r\n    order to preserve an issue for appellate review, a party must both raise that\r\n    issue to the trial court and obtain a ruling&quot;).\r\n  2.&nbsp;As to whether the family court\r\n    erred in finding an unanticipated, substantial change in circumstances\r\n    sufficient to warrant a termination of Wife's award of alimony, we affirm the\r\n    family court.  Lewis v.

William Hinnant, Jr., of Spartanburg,\r\n            for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Edwin\r\n  O. Byrd, MD, Sheri C. Byrd, MD, and James M. Gragg, MD are former members of\r\n  Woodruff Family Medicine, LLC (the Practice).  The Byrds appeal the master-in-equity's\r\n  amended order granting Dr. Gragg a judgment in equitable accounting of\r\n  $50,772.38.  They claim the master erred in calculating the amount owed between\r\n  the parties.  We affirm as modified.\r\nAn\r\n  action for accounting lies in equity and seeks a calculation and judgment of\r\n  the account balances between the parties.  Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC\r\n    v. Mallon, 381 S.C. 417, 427, 673 S.E.2d 448, 453 (2009).  Our review is de\r\n  novo, but we are not required to disregard the master's credibility findings.  Morris\r\n    v. Tidewater Land &amp; Timber, Inc., 388 S.C. 317, 324-25, 696 S.E.2d 599,\r\n  603 (Ct. App. 2010).  \r\nNearly\r\n  every detail in this case is affected by the fact that, at best, the parties'\r\n  bookkeeping was extremely poor.  At worst, it was fraudulent.[1] \r\n  In calculating the final net due between the parties, we begin by using the\r\n  &quot;Byrds' revised figures,&quot; which are reflected in the 2009 report's\r\n  &quot;revised collections figures&quot; found on page 592 of the record.  We\r\n  also substitute some of those numbers with the findings made below.\r\n1. The Byrds argue the\r\n  master miscalculated Dr. Gragg's portion of the Practice's shared expenses in\r\n  2000 and 2001.  We agree, but our calculations differ from the Byrds'.\r\nIn\r\n  using the Byrds' revised figures for the year 2000, the 2009 report found the\r\n  Practice incurred $315,295.19 in shared expenses.  Because no party contests\r\n  that Dr. Gragg owed only 40% of the Practice's shared expenses for that year, Dr.\r\n  Gragg's portion of shared expenses during that period was $126,118.08.  Plugging\r\n  that figure into the 2009 report's revised collection figures for 2000, we find\r\n  the net amount due to Dr. Gragg for that year is $17,303.12.  \r\nAs\r\n  for 2001, the 2009 report's calculation of total shared expenses according to\r\n  the Byrd's revised figures equaled $350,991.47.  Dr. Gragg's portion of the\r\n  year's shared expenses is thus $140,396.59.  Plugging that figure into the 2009\r\n  report's revised collection figures for 2001, the net amount due to Dr. Gragg for\r\n  that year is $13,189.79.  \r\n2.  The Byrds maintain\r\n  the master erred in declining to find Dr. Gragg failed to fulfill a $30,000\r\n  obligation imposed by the Practice's operating agreement.  We decline to\r\n  consider the obligation when calculating the proper amount owed between the\r\n  parties because the Byrds have failed to provide an adequate record.\r\nThe\r\n  operating agreement is the contract that governs relations among LLC members. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-103(a) (2006); S.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-103 cmt. (2006).  If\r\n  a contract's language is unambiguous, the contract's construction is a question\r\n  of law.  ESA Servs., LLC v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 392 S.C. 11, 20, 707\r\n  S.E.2d 431, 436 (Ct. App. 2011).  The court must construe the contract's\r\n  language &quot;according to its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.&quot;  Shuler\r\n    v. Tri-County Elec. Co-op, 374 S.C. 516, 523, 649 S.E.2d 98,\r\n  101 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nHere,\r\n  Dr. Gragg owed an independent $30,000 obligation pursuant to the operating\r\n  agreement.  A comparison of Article XVI and Article XIV in the operating\r\n  agreement indicates Dr. Gragg held 40% &quot;ownership&quot; of the Practice\r\n  but was required to pay ten installments totaling $30,000 to obtain &quot;50%\r\n  ownership&quot; of the Practice's &quot;medical equipment.&quot;  However,\r\n  the Byrds failed to present credible evidence of that equipment's liquidation\r\n  value.  This evidence is necessary to\r\n  account for the obligation because the $30,000 obligation was not a typical\r\n  buy-in, i.e. it was incurred to receive equity in specific assets rather than in\r\n  the Practice.  Because\r\n  the Byrds had the duty to provide an adequate record to conduct a full\r\n  accounting, we decline to consider the obligation when making our final\r\n  determination.  See Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C.\r\n  201, 215, 493 S.E.2d 826, 834 (1997) (holding the appellant bears the burden of\r\n  providing a sufficient record).\r\n3. The\r\n  Byrds contend the master erred in finding Dr. Gragg was owed $13,901.32 for the\r\n  assessment of 40% of the interest payments the Practice made on Note 4.  We\r\n  agree.\r\nNo\r\n  party contests the master's finding the interest charges were improper.  Allen\r\n  Carter testified the Practice charged Dr. Gragg 40% of the interest payments\r\n  made on Note 4, and no evidence shows otherwise.  Moreover, in calculating the\r\n  total shared expenses in 2002, 2003, and 2004, the Byrds' revised figures in\r\n  the 2009 report did not deduct interest\r\n  charges on Note 4 from the Practice's total shared expenses.  \r\nTo\r\n  calculate the total interest improperly charged to the Practice as a business\r\n  expense, we must add the interest payments made on Note 4 during the period in\r\n  question.  In doing so, we use the interest charges on Note 4 reflected by Dr.\r\n  Gragg's figures in the 2009 report.  Dr. Gragg's figures alleged the Practice\r\n  was charged certain interest payments on Note 4—$3,447.71 for 2002, $5,901.36\r\n  for 2003, and $4,432.77 for 2004.  The sum of those payments equals\r\n  $13,781.84.  The sum represents the total interest charges paid by the\r\n  Practice.  Thus, we must calculate Dr. Gragg's share of those interest payments,\r\n  and 40% of $13,781.84 equals $5,512.74.  Accordingly, the master should have\r\n  awarded Dr. Gragg $5,512.74 rather than $13,901.32 for interest charges the\r\n  Practice improperly paid as a shared expense. \r\n4. The\r\n  Byrds maintain the master erred in declining to find Dr. Gragg owed the Byrds\r\n  40% of the Practice's payments on Note 5 after he left the Practice.[2]  However, the Byrds\r\n  failed to present credible evidence establishing the fair value of the\r\n  equipment related to Note 5 and retained by the Practice.  Therefore, we cannot\r\n  accurately determine whether Dr. Gragg owes the Byrds money for payments the\r\n  Practice made on Note 5 after he resigned.  We therefore decline to rule on the\r\n  issue.  See Crestwood Golf Club, 328 S.C. at 215, 493 S.E.2d at\r\n  834 (holding the appellant bears the burden of providing a sufficient record).\r\n5.  The Byrds lastly argue\r\n  the master erred in declining to find Dr. Gragg owed his pro rata share of\r\n  property taxes for the 2004 tax year.  We again decline to grant this award.  \r\nHere,\r\n  the Practice's lease agreement with Bedside Partners required the Practice to\r\n  pay Bedside Partners's property taxes.  However, the Byrds failed to provide\r\n  Bedside Partners's tax return, and we do not find Mr. Carter's testimony that\r\n  Bedside Partners's annual property taxes totaled near $13,000 credible.  The\r\n  Practice's 2004 ledger tellingly indicates the Practice issued an extra $4,000\r\n  check to Bedside Partners on May 24, 2004, and Mr. Carter's testimony suggests\r\n  the check might have paid property taxes, bank charges, or some combination of\r\n  the two.  Thus, the Byrds failed to provide credible evidence establishing the\r\n  amount of taxes paid by the Practice in 2004.\r\n6. Based upon the\r\n  foregoing arguments, the Byrds contend they are entitled to a monetary judgment\r\n  against Dr. Gragg.  Although we disagree, we amend the master's award.  The net\r\n  amount due to Dr. Gragg equals as follows:\r\n\r\n  NET\r\n    DUE\r\n  *Substitution\r\n    of our findings is in bold and italics.\r\n  YEAR 1998                                      ($8,053.13)\r\n  YEAR 1999                                      $9,610.05\r\n  YEAR 2000                                      $17,303.12\r\n  YEAR 2001                                      $13,189.79\r\n  YEAR 2002                                      $18,624.73\r\n  YEAR 2003                                      $1,637.04\r\n  YEAR 2004                                      ($9,600.46)\r\n  Note 1                                               ($13,034.47)\r\n  Note 2                                               ($719.82)\r\n  Note 3                                                        -\r\n  Note 4                                               $5,512.74\r\n  Note 5                                                        -\r\n  Buy-In                                                        -\r\n  Property Taxes                                          -\r\n  Unchallenged Cell Phone Award     $6,352.56\r\n  Final Net Due to\r\n    Dr. Gragg            $40,822.15\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  final net due to Dr. Gragg reflects the final balance of the money owed by the\r\n  Byrds for all of the issues in dispute.  Accordingly, we amend the master's\r\n  order to award Dr. Gragg $40,822.15.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] For an extended period beginning in 1998, the parties\r\n  recorded services performed by Dr. Gragg as services performed by Dr. Edwin\r\n  Byrd because Dr. Gragg lacked the necessary credentials to bill certain medical\r\n  insurers for those services.  \r\n[2] We\r\n  need not address Dr. Gragg's contention that he is entitled to a further award\r\n  of $12,419.30 for other charges regarding Note 5.&nbsp; See Commercial\r\n    Credit Loans, Inc. v.

Code Ann. § 1-23-610(B)(d)-(e)\r\n  (Supp. 2010) (stating in an appeal of the final decision of an administrative\r\n  agency, the standard of appellate review is whether the findings of the ALC are\r\n  supported by substantial evidence or affected by other error of law); Sanders\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 379 S.C. 411, 417, 665 S.E.2d 231, 234 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008) (holding that in determining whether the ALC's decision was supported by\r\n  substantial evidence, this court need only find evidence from which reasonable\r\n  minds could reach the same conclusion that the ALC reached and the mere\r\n  possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\r\n  prevent a finding from being supported by substantial evidence). As to the\r\n  ALC's findings that Academy's charter application was deficient in the areas of\r\n  support for the school and violation of the spirit and intent of the law, we\r\n  find it unnecessary to review those findings.  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its\r\n  determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n2.&nbsp; As to whether the ALC erred in failing\r\n  to find District had violated constitutional or statutory provisions in their\r\n  denial of Academy's charter application, we find Academy presented no evidence\r\n  or examples of District creating requirements for their charter application in\r\n  violation of constitutional or statutory provisions. See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  § 1-23-610(B)(a) (Supp. 2010) (&quot;The court of appeals may affirm the\r\n  decision [of the ALC] or remand the case for further proceedings; or, it may\r\n  reverse or modify the decision if the substantive rights of the petitioner have\r\n  been prejudiced because the finding, conclusion, or decision is: (a) in\r\n  violation of constitutional or statutory provisions . . . .&quot;).\r\n3.&nbsp; As to whether the ALC erred in\r\n  failing to find District exceeded its statutory authority and/or acted in an\r\n  arbitrary or capricious manner by employing different standards for Academy's\r\n  application as opposed to those used in review of other applications, Academy\r\n  presented no evidence or examples of disparity of treatment between their\r\n  charter application and previous charter applications. See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. § 1-23-610(B)(f) (Supp. 2010) (&quot;The court of appeals may affirm the\r\n  decision [of the ALC] or remand the case for further proceedings; or, it may\r\n  reverse or modify the decision if the substantive rights of the petitioner have\r\n  been prejudiced because the finding, conclusion, or decision is . . . arbitrary\r\n  or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted\r\n  exercise of discretion.&quot;)\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER, and LOCKEMY,  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-081","title":"Hueble v.

As to whether\r\n  the circuit court erred in dismissing Segarra's breach of contract and bad\r\n  faith causes of action: See Judy v. Martin, 381 S.C. 455,\r\n  458, 674 S.E.2d 151, 153 (2009) (&quot;Appellant may not seek relief from the\r\n  prior unappealed order of the circuit court because the order has become the\r\n  law of the case.  Under the law of the case doctrine, a party is precluded from\r\n  relitigating, after an appeal, matters that were either not raised on appeal,\r\n  but should have been, or raised on appeal, but expressly rejected by the\r\n  appellate court.&quot;); Hudson v. Lancaster Convalescent Ctr., 393 S.C. 1, 7,\r\n  709 S.E.2d 65, 68 (Ct.

(RBC) and denying Owners'\r\n  two motions for partial summary judgment.  We reverse the order granting\r\n  partial summary judgment to RBC and remand for further proceedings.  \r\n1.&nbsp; As\r\n  to the\r\n  propriety of granting partial summary judgment to RBC regarding voting rights\r\n  under the original Declaration, we conclude the circuit court erred.  The terms of the\r\n  original Declaration are subject to more than one reasonable interpretation.  Therefore, the intent underlying the original Declaration\r\n  must be determined by the finder of fact.  See S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299,\r\n  302 (2001) (&quot;A contract is ambiguous when the terms of the contract are\r\n  reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation.&quot;); id. at\r\n  623, 550 S.E.2d at 303 (citation omitted) (&quot;Once the court decides the\r\n  language is ambiguous, evidence may be admitted to show the intent of the\r\n  parties.  The determination of the parties' intent is then a question of fact.&quot;). \r\n2.&nbsp; We\r\n  decline to reach Appellants' arguments regarding the South Carolina Nonprofit\r\n  Corporation Act and the rules applicable to covenant amendments imposed\r\n  unilaterally by developers.  These questions arose solely from Owners'\r\n  first motion for summary judgment, which the circuit court denied.  RBC's\r\n  summary judgment motion addressed only the issue concerning interpretation of the\r\n  original Declaration.\r\nWhile the\r\n  circuit court determined the amendments to the Declaration were valid, rather\r\n  than concluding there were genuine issues of material fact on this question, the\r\n  denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable regardless of the\r\n  language used in the order denying summary judgment.  See Olson v.\r\n    Faculty House of Carolina,\r\n      Inc.,\r\n  354 S.C. 161, 167, 580 S.E.2d 440, 443 (2003) (quoting Ballenger v.\r\n    Bowen,\r\n  313 S.C. 476, 477, 443 S.E.2d 379, 380 (1994)) (holding that the denial of summary judgment does not finally determine\r\n  anything about the merits of the case).  Further, the denial of summary\r\n  judgment may not be reviewed even if another appealable issue is before the\r\n  court.  See id. (holding that the\r\n  denial of summary judgment is not reviewable even in an appeal from final\r\n  judgment).\r\n\r\n  A denial of a motion for summary judgment decides nothing about\r\n    the merits of the case, but simply decides the case should proceed to trial.  The\r\n      denial of summary judgment does not establish the law of the case, and the\r\n      issues raised in the motion may be raised again later in the proceedings by\r\n    a motion to reconsider the summary judgment motion or by a motion for a\r\n    directed verdict. \r\n  In short, the denial of\r\n    summary judgment does not finally determine anything about the merits of\r\n    the case and does not have the effect of striking any defense since that\r\n    defense may be raised again later in the proceedings.  Therefore, an order\r\n    denying a motion for summary judgment is not appealable.\r\n\r\nBallenger, 313 S.C. at\r\n  477-78, 443 S.E.2d at 380 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS,\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-096","title":"Green v.

Hollingsworth on Wheels, Inc., granted\r\n  Hendrix's request to be moved from full-time to part-time employment to avoid a\r\n  reduction of his social security benefits.  Hollingsworth appeals the average\r\n  weekly wage calculation of the appellate panel of the workers' compensation commission. \r\n  Hendrix cross-appeals the appellate panel's finding that his cervical spine\r\n  condition was not causally related to the accident.  We affirm the order of the appellate panel pursuant to\r\n  Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n(1) As to the calculation of\r\n  Hendrix's average weekly wage: Pilgrim v. Eaton, 391 S.C. 38, 44-45, 703 S.E.2d 241, 244 (Ct. App. 2010) (stating\r\n  the commission must calculate average weekly wage &quot;'by taking the total\r\n  wages paid for the last four quarters . . . divided by fifty-two or by the\r\n  actual number of weeks for which wages were paid, whichever is less' . . .\r\n  unless 'the employment, prior to the injury, extended over a period of less\r\n  than fifty-two weeks,' or unless 'for exceptional reasons' it would be unfair\r\n  to do so.&quot; (quoting S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-40 (Supp. 2011))); 391 S.C. at\r\n  44, 703 S.E.2d at 243-44 (stating &quot;an appellate court may not reverse the\r\n  commission's decision [of the average weekly wage calculation] unless\r\n  substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the decision\r\n  is affected by an error of law, or because the factual findings are clearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence&quot;). \r\n  We find this case distinguishable from Bennett v. Gary Smith Builders,\r\n  271 S.C. 94, 245 S.E.2d 129 (1978) for several reasons, including (1) the\r\n  length of the part-time employment prior to the injury was less than five\r\n  months and was therefore not permanently established, (2) the average weekly\r\n  wage calculation included both full-time and part-time salary amounts, and (3)\r\n  the commission specifically found the calculation to be fair and reasonable.\r\n(2) As to the\r\n  factual finding that Hendrix's cervical spine condition was not causally\r\n  related to the work accident: Bartley v.

Clark, of Greenville, Guardian ad\r\n          Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this family law action, Kristen C.\r\n  Hines (Wife) appeals, arguing the family court erred in issuing a divorce\r\n  decree without setting forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of\r\n  law that support the decision. Wife further contends the family court erred in\r\n  awarding custody of the parties' children to Harold G. Hines, Jr. (Husband) as\r\n  he has a history of violence and exposed the children to other women after he\r\n  and Wife separated.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nHusband and Wife married in\r\n  December 2001.  Two daughters (Children) were born of the marriage; T in 2004\r\n  and H in 2005.  Around June 24, 2008, the parties separated following an\r\n  altercation; the two struggled over Wife's bag of pills[1] and Wife hit her head on a doorframe.  Husband claimed he found Wife with a bag\r\n  in which she kept drugs and while the two struggled over the bag, Wife hit her\r\n  head on the doorframe.  Husband eventually let Wife have the bag and she\r\n  snorted some crushed pills with a straw.  Wife claimed the altercation occurred\r\n  because she told Husband she wanted a divorce; he grabbed her and dragged her\r\n  outside, hitting her head on the wall and pushing her into the door jamb, and\r\n  she snorted the drugs as part of a temper tantrum.  \r\nHusband contacted the\r\n  Greenville County Sheriff's Office.  Sergeant Chris Taylor, one of the officers\r\n  who responded, counted Wife's pill bottle and discovered that 76 pills were\r\n  missing from a 120-pill bottle of Lortab that was refilled four days prior. \r\n  The prescription called for her to take four pills a day.  Wife refused to go\r\n  with EMS to be evaluated.  Wife told Sergeant Taylor that she had snorted the\r\n  pills.  Wife also told Joshua Franseen with the Sheriff's Office she had\r\n  snorted the pills, Husband had not abused her, and she was not fearful for her\r\n  life.  Franseen informed Husband how to obtain an order of protection.  According\r\n  to the Sheriff's Office report, the judge the officers called denied a warrant\r\n  for criminal domestic violence.  Husband took Children to his father's home for\r\n  the night.  Wife moved to Tennessee to live with her parents following the\r\n  parties' separation.\r\nOn June 26, 2008, Husband\r\n  filed a complaint for divorce on the statutory grounds of habitual drunkenness\r\n  based on her use of prescription drugs and requested temporary and permanent\r\n  custody of Children. Wife filed an answer and counterclaim on June 30, 2008,\r\n  requesting a divorce based on physical cruelty and custody of Children.\r\nOn June 30, 2008, the family\r\n  court held an emergency hearing due to Husband's motion for emergency temporary\r\n  relief.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court placed the children in the\r\n  custody of the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS), finding\r\n  based on the testimony and evidence presented, Children were in imminent and\r\n  substantial risk of danger and must be removed from the physical custody and\r\n  care of both Husband and Wife.  On July 1, 2008, DSS filed its pleadings.  The\r\n  guardian ad litem (GAL) moved to have Children placed in Husband's parents'\r\n  custody, and the family court granted the order on July 24, 2008.  The court\r\n  issued an order on August 15, 2008, dismissing DSS's complaint and returning\r\n  Children to Husband with alternating custody week to week by agreement of the\r\n  parties.  In June 2009, Husband was given temporary primary placement of\r\n  Children beginning on August 19 for T to begin attending school in Greenville\r\n  County. \r\nAt the beginning of the final\r\n  hearing, Husband moved to amend his pleading to seek a divorce based on one\r\n  year's continuous separation and Wife consented.  The parties also informed the\r\n  family court they had settled all of their financial and property issues.\r\nAt trial, Husband testified\r\n  that during the marriage, Wife stayed at home with Children and he worked\r\n  full-time as well as attended school full-time.  He provided that when he would\r\n  return home, he would &quot;straighten the girls up, you know, spend time with\r\n  them, get laundry started.  Either fix something to eat or go out and get\r\n  something for us to eat, you know.&quot;  He indicated that Wife cooked\r\n  occasionally, about once a week.  He stated &quot;it wasn't like every night\r\n  but she has cooked.&quot;  Husband provided he did all of his and Children's\r\n  laundry, as well as the household linens and towels.  He testified he would\r\n  change Children's clothing when he got home from work if they were dirty.  He\r\n  also stated that when he was present, changing diapers was his responsibility. \r\n  He testified that he had completed a co-parenting class when Children were in\r\n  DSS custody because it was required.\r\nHusband provided that he has\r\n  been able to take care of Children since he has had full-time custody.  He\r\n  testified he gets T up in the morning and gets her ready for school.  He calls\r\n  Ashley, his girlfriend, to come over and lets H sleep while he takes T to\r\n  school.  He comes home from work, plays with Children, and takes them to the\r\n  library, bowling, roller skating, or to dinner with his father.  On the\r\n  weekends, they go to the park to ride bicycles.  In the evening, he helps T\r\n  with her homework, which they spread out over the week.  On Wednesday and\r\n  Sunday nights, Children go to programs at church, and on Sunday morning they\r\n  attend church services.  He testified Children seemed to enjoy living with him\r\n  in Greenville.  He provided that they have lots of fun and &quot;they do really\r\n  well.&quot; He said that although Wife claimed otherwise, H is &quot;a well-behaved\r\n  little four year old.&quot;\r\nHusband testified Wife told\r\n  him that her uncle sexually molested her as a child, and when she told her\r\n  parents about it, her mother called her a &quot;slut,&quot; and her father, who\r\n  worked for DSS in Tennessee, did not do anything about it.  He also stated she\r\n  told him about her grandfather touching her inappropriately.  He testified that\r\n  as far as he knew, the uncle still lived in the same town as Wife's parents.  He\r\n  also indicated that everyone who lives in Wife's parents' house who smokes does\r\n  so in the house.  He admitted he smokes as well but does it on his back porch. \r\n  He further provided that during his marriage to Wife, Wife's brother beat her\r\n  up while she was at her parents' house over an argument about her using drugs. \r\n  He testified Wife filed charges but her parents' bought her a Jeep and the\r\n  charges were dropped.  Husband believed Wife's brother would regularly throw\r\n  parties at their parents' house at which people would get drunk and pass out. \r\n  He also stated that when Children were taken into DSS custody, Wife gathered all\r\n  of her and Children's possessions and took them to Tennessee.\r\nHusband testified that after\r\n  he separated from Wife, he dated a woman, Leanne, for a few months.  He stated\r\n  Children had met her and her son at a park one time.  About three weeks after\r\n  he stopped seeing Leanne, he began dating his current girlfriend, Ashley, who\r\n  he intends to marry.  He indicated he introduced her to Children a few months\r\n  later and about a month after that he found out she was pregnant with his\r\n  child.  He provided that Ashley does not spend the night in his home when\r\n  Children are present.\r\nHusband did not believe he\r\n  had an anger management problem.  He stated he had never abused Wife.  He admitted he had left small bruises on Children's bottoms from spanking\r\n  them.  He said he now spanks them with his hand but he and Wife\r\n  previously used a spatula.  He stated that he took anger management classes as\r\n  a result of a recommendation from the GAL.  He provided that he learned some things\r\n  in that class.  He also testified about an incident that occurred\r\n  shortly before the hearing at which a process server came to his house at 6:30\r\n  in the morning.  He stated that his dogs &quot;were going absolutely\r\n  crazy, which they seldom do unless something is wrong.&quot;  He\r\n  testified that he saw a small car that he did not recognize and a person\r\n  standing his front porch in &quot;loose attire, didn't look\r\n  professional.&quot;  He admitted that he opened his door and pointed a gun in\r\n  the process server's face because he felt threatened.  He admitted that he\r\n  currently has three pistols in his home.\r\nWife also testified at the\r\n  hearing.  She testified that she currently lived with her mother and father at\r\n  their home in Clarksville, Tennessee.  She stated she moved to Tennessee\r\n  because her entire support system, her family and friends, is there.  She said,\r\n  &quot;It's where I grew up.  I know how to get around in Clarksville.&quot; \r\n  She indicated she lived in her parents' basement, which had a private access\r\n  and was about 1,300 square feet.  She believed the space was suitable for her\r\n  and Children.  She provided the home she has made for Children is \r\n\r\n  very\r\n    large, very open, very fun.  We have a lot of kid's toys and we've got little\r\n    areas set up for the children all over the house.  My area specifically is\r\n    specifically set up for the children.  It's safe, it's very open, so they have\r\n    plenty of play area.  They have their toys.  They have their own bedroom that's\r\n    done all in princesses and it's very -- it's a very good environment for them. \r\n\r\nShe testified the home was in\r\n  the country so her parents had a lot of room for the farm animals they owned. \r\n  She planned for H to stay with her mother during the day and T to be at school\r\n  when she went back to work.  Wife believed Children would be better off\r\n  living with her because she had taken care of them since they were born.  She\r\n  stated:\r\n\r\n  I have\r\n    been up all night with them.  I have been with them when they were sick.  I\r\n    have changed their dirty diapers, wiped their snotty noses.  I have taught them\r\n    their ABC's.  We were almost reading before this happened with [T].  We are so\r\n    well-bonded and I mean they're my girls.  We're so close.  And I just think it\r\n    would be a tragedy to take that away from either one of us.  \r\n\r\nWife admitted that three\r\n  people who live in her parents' house smoke, including herself.  She also\r\n  provided that her family has parties at their home on holidays but no one\r\n  passes out from drinking.  She testified that people do smoke at their parties\r\n  either in her father's shop area or outside.  She indicated she had not lived\r\n  with her brother since they were children.  She also testified about a fight\r\n  she and her brother had while she and Husband were married.  She was visiting\r\n  Tennessee, and she and her brother got into an argument over a business deal\r\n  that her brother and Husband made.  She said she pushed him and he pushed her\r\n  back.  She admitted that he choked her and she bit his finger and stabbed him\r\n  with her keys.  She provided that her brother's home is thirty miles away from\r\n  her parents' house but he is currently in Afghanistan serving in the military. \r\n  She testified her parents had bought her a car after she dropped the charges\r\n  against her brother but it was an &quot;inspiration gift&quot; so she could go\r\n  back to school because Husband did not provide her with adequate\r\n  transportation.  She dropped the charges against her brother because she did\r\n  not want to prosecute him for something in which they were equally involved.\r\nWhen asked about an uncle\r\n  molesting her, she stated, &quot;Technically he's not my uncle, he's a cousin\r\n  that I -- he's so much older than me I called him uncle but he's my third\r\n  cousin.&quot;  She indicated that she was eleven years old when the abuse\r\n  occurred.  She stated that the abuse happened in her parents' home, where she currently\r\n  lives.  She said the incident occurred when her extended family had gathered at\r\n  the home due to an ice storm.  She provided that he lives twenty miles away\r\n  from where she currently lives and he is not allowed anywhere she will be.  She\r\n  stated although no court order required him to stay away, Tennessee has no\r\n  statute of limitations for statutory rape and he knew that if he comes near\r\n  her, she will press charges.  She testified that she would never allow Children\r\n  to be around him.  \r\nWife also explained her\r\n  mother called her a slut when she was seventeen or eighteen years old because\r\n  she was acting promiscuously.  She then informed her mother she was\r\n  being promiscuous because of the molestation, which her mother did not know\r\n  about.  She stated that once she told her mother she was molested, her mother\r\n  apologized and said she would talk to her father to decide what they should\r\n  do.  She stated that her cousin was not arrested because her parents felt it\r\n  would be more traumatic for her to sit through a court case and testify than it\r\n  would be to let him know he would be prosecuted if he ever came around her or a\r\n  young girl again.  She also indicated that her grandfather, who she said\r\n  inappropriately touched her when she was two, was dead.  She indicated she did\r\n  not tell her parents about that abuse until around the same time she told them\r\n  about the other abuse and he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's shortly thereafter.\r\nAdditionally, Wife testified\r\n  about her prescription drug problem.  She stated she injured her back in\r\n  July 2001.  She testified she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and had a disk in\r\n  her back removed and it continued to degenerate.  She indicated she was\r\n  prescribed medication typically reserved for cancer patients.  She\r\n  became addicted to pain medication and forged a prescription to get more of\r\n  it.  She testified she pled guilty to forging four prescriptions.  She\r\n  attended several different clinics to treat her addiction.  She stated she eventually\r\n  completed a program with honors.  Wife also testified she had been\r\n  diagnosed with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder and was\r\n  receiving treatment for both.  She stated her treatment for bipolar\r\n  disorder was to take a medicine called Abilify to keep her on an even keel.  She also sees a therapist once or twice a month for counseling and a\r\n  psychiatrist once every four weeks.  She stated she was diagnosed as\r\n  being bipolar after she sought counseling due to the incident between her and\r\n  Husband. \r\nAdditionally, Wife testified\r\n  about the incident that occurred on the night of June 24, 2008.  She\r\n  stated that she had just returned from Tennessee and decided that she wanted a\r\n  divorce.  She informed Husband she wanted a divorce and locked him out\r\n  of the room.  She then let him into the room because he was beating on\r\n  the door and she was afraid he was going to wake Children.  She testified\r\n  Husband said she must be high if she wanted to divorce him and he grabbed her\r\n  bag containing Lortab[2] and Topamax[3].  She provided he pulled her around the corner as she was trying to get the\r\n  bag back, causing her to hit her ribs and breast on the wall.  She\r\n  stated that he dragged her down the hallway, which skinned the tops of her feet\r\n  and knees.  He then handed her bag back to her and said &quot;'You'll never\r\n  divorce me.  You'll never get the kids.  I will use your drug addict, yourself,\r\n  your past against you and you'll never get the kids.'&quot;  Wife then\r\n  told Husband, &quot;'I'll show you drug addict and you can't do anything about\r\n  it.'&quot;  Wife then &quot;got the paraphernalia and [she] crushed the pills\r\n  up and snorted them in front of him.&quot;  Wife stated that after she\r\n  finished, Husband pulled her back through the house, this time pulling her face\r\n  into the door frame, knocking a tooth loose and fracturing her jaw.  She\r\n  testified Husband called police and when they arrived, she told them she did\r\n  not feel threatened because &quot;'He's done now.  He's over it now.'&quot;  Wife indicated she told the officers she did not have a drug problem\r\n  because she &quot;was throwing a temper tantrum basically.&quot;  She\r\n  stated she did not want to go to the hospital because she did not want to leave\r\n  Children but the officers had Husband take Children.\r\nWife testified Husband had\r\n  hurt her before that night but had not been &quot;quite that violent&quot; in\r\n  previous incidents; one time he had thrown her off the bed and thrown the\r\n  mattress on top of her because one of Children would not stop crying.  She\r\n  indicated that another time, he had raped her the night before she had to go to\r\n  the hospital to have a procedure performed due to a miscarriage.  She did not\r\n  believe Husband abused Children because he did not mean to bruise them but\r\n  &quot;sometimes he was overly excessive with his discipline.  [He] spanked the\r\n  girls with a rubber hose so that it didn't leave marks and he spanked them with\r\n  a spoon.&quot;  She further stated he spanked H eleven times with a\r\n  spoon when she was fifteen months old.\r\nT's teacher testified at the\r\n  hearing as well.  She stated that T is on time, has perfect attendance, and is\r\n  well-dressed.  She also indicated Husband had met with her and is a concerned\r\n  father.  She provided T is a good student, is in the high group for reading,\r\n  and comes prepared.\r\nThe court-appointed counselor\r\n  also testified.  She provided that she had met with Children five times.  She believed Husband is an excellent father, provides a stable home, is\r\n  very consistent, and provides structure.  She testified Husband is very\r\n  appropriate with Children, loves them, and keeps them in line.  She\r\n  noted that Children have good manners, are compliant, show affection towards\r\n  Husband, and obey him well.  She recognized that Husband &quot;makes\r\n  mistakes like a lot of people do, but&quot; she thought he had learned from his\r\n  mistakes.\r\nShe further testified Wife\r\n  was a good mother and loved Children as much as Husband did.  She\r\n  indicated that Children are bonded to both Husband and Wife.  However, she\r\n  noted Children have a lot of anxiety and &quot;residual behaviors&quot; when\r\n  they return from visitation with Wife.  She stated Children have problems\r\n  getting back into their routine when returning from visitation because\r\n  Tennessee is in a different time zone and they stay up later when there.  She\r\n  said that Children report they want to live with Wife because she does not put\r\n  them in time out.  She also provided Children told her Wife told them to\r\n  tell anyone who asked that they wanted to live in Tennessee.  The counselor\r\n  noted that Wife had informed her she had behavioral problems with mostly H but\r\n  also T and T reported that H misbehaves when in Tennessee.  The\r\n  counselor indicated she did not have any concerns with Husband taking care of\r\n  Children.  However, she did have concerns about Wife because she does\r\n  not have a house or a job.  She further stated, &quot;I worry about her\r\n  ability to care for the children as far as parent them and set limits and\r\n  boundaries and structure based upon her own report.&quot;  She explained\r\n  that Wife had taken H to a counseling center in Tennessee and had reported to\r\n  the center that H has tantrums, cries, pouts, and has headaches.  Wife also\r\n  told the counselor T would be in &quot;'super brat mode'&quot; and H would act\r\n  infantile.  The counselor stated Husband and Children had not reported\r\n  any similar incidents while they were in Greenville.\r\nThe counselor believed\r\n  both parents needed to continue to learn to work together but she believed the\r\n  best placement for Children was with Husband.  She also believed T was\r\n  doing well in school and was well-spoken.  She thought Husband's\r\n  girlfriend, Ashley, was a good influence on Children.  She testified\r\n  Ashley had not told her that she spent the night at Husband's house when\r\n  Children were present, but she believed she did and had advised Husband against\r\n  it because it violated a court order.  The counselor further provided\r\n  Wife had been the primary caregiver during the marriage, with Husband providing\r\n  &quot;an enormous amount of support,&quot; particularly in terms of paying the\r\n  bills while Wife stayed at home with Children.\r\nThe GAL's report was\r\n  introduced and stated in part: \r\n\r\n  It was\r\n    interesting to note that none of [Wife's] fifteen complaints about [Husband]\r\n    [as to why he should not have primary custody] included the horrible criminal\r\n    domestic violence alleged to have happened the night of June 24, 2008.  The\r\n    evidence does not tend to support that [Husband] has been a physically abusive\r\n    husband to [Wife] nor that [Husband] has abused the children by using excessive\r\n    corporal punishment.  I have found evidence supporting [Husband] may have\r\n    controlling behaviors and anger issues.  Husband pulled a gun on the process\r\n    server recently.  \r\n\r\nThe GAL noted that Wife lives\r\n  with her parents who she claims failed to protect her from sexual abuse from\r\n  her grandfather and a cousin as a child.  Wife had stated that her\r\n  mother blamed her for the abuse.  The GAL further provided that Wife\r\n  suffers from both bi-polar and post-traumatic stress disorder.  The GAL\r\n  also noted that Wife and her mother both smoke in the house. \r\nThe family court also dealt\r\n  with Wife's two contempt issues against Husband; Wife asserted he violated the\r\n  court's orders by having (1) guns in the house and (2) his girlfriend overnight\r\n  in the presence of Children.  The family court found Husband to be in contempt\r\n  and as a sanction denied him attorney's fees.  At the conclusion of the\r\n  hearing, the family court announced its decision on the issues, including\r\n  custody.  The family court stated, &quot;I take into consideration the\r\n  Guardian's full report and [am] satisfied from all the evidence, including the\r\n  Guardian's report . . . that the best interest of the children would be served\r\n  by their being in the custody of their father.&quot;  When addressing\r\n  visitation, the family court stated it did not think it was healthy to have\r\n  children exposed to the smoking that went on at Wife's home in Tennessee and\r\n  acknowledged the history of child abuse that had occurred there but found\r\n  Children did not need any special restrictions while on visitation with Wife.  The\r\n  family court further stated:\r\n\r\n  I do\r\n    think that both of these parents love these girls and would try to do what's\r\n    best for them and I'm satisfied that the mother will not subject these children\r\n    to a situation that would involve sexual abuse.  I do think that both of the\r\n    parents probably expose them to smoke.  It's clearly not in their best\r\n    interest.\r\n\r\nFollowing the hearing, the\r\n  family court issued an order awarding custody to Husband.  The order stated,\r\n  &quot;Though neither party came into this Court with 'clean hands,' the Court\r\n  finds that custody of [Children] is granted to [Husband].&quot;  This appeal\r\n  followed.    \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate\r\n  court reviews decisions of the family court de novo.  Lewis v. Lewis,\r\n  392 S.C. 381, 390, 709 S.E.2d 650, 654-55 (2011).  The appellate court\r\n  generally defers to the factual findings of the family court regarding\r\n  credibility because the family court is in a better position to observe the\r\n  witness and his or her demeanor.  Id. at 390-92, 709 S.E.2d at 654-55. \r\n  The party contesting the family court's decision bears the burden of\r\n  demonstrating the family court's factual findings are not supported by the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.  Id. at 392, 709 S.E.2d at 655.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife argues the\r\n  family court erred in issuing a divorce decree without setting forth the\r\n  specific findings of fact and conclusions of law that support the decision. \r\n  She contends the central issue at trial was custody of Children and the divorce\r\n  decree does not set forth any specific findings of fact or conclusions of law\r\n  to support the family court's decision to award Husband custody.  We agree.\r\nRule 26(a),\r\n  SCRFC, provides that &quot;[a]n order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication\r\n  in a domestic relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law to support the court's decision.&quot;  See also Griffith\r\n    v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534-35 (Ct.

Here, the record on appeal\r\n  is sufficient for this Court to make necessary findings of fact relating to the\r\n  award of attorney's fees.&quot;). \r\nAfter reviewing the entire\r\n  order, we agree with Wife that the family court's order is lacking in regards\r\n  to custody.  Nonetheless, the remedy for a lack of findings is either to remand\r\n  or to make our own findings of fact if the record is sufficient.  The record is\r\n  sufficient here for us to make our own findings of fact on custody.  \r\nWife contends the\r\n  family court erred in awarding custody of Children to Husband.  We disagree.\r\nIn a child custody case, the welfare of the child and what is in the child's &quot;'best\r\n  interest is the primary, paramount, and controlling consideration of the court.'&quot;  Davis v.

Cobb,\r\n  271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614 (1978)).  \r\n\r\n  The family court considers several factors in determining the best\r\n    interest of the child, including: who has been the primary caretaker; the\r\n    conduct, attributes, and fitness of the parents; the opinions of third parties\r\n    (including GAL, expert witnesses, and the children); and the age, health, and\r\n    sex of the children. \r\n\r\nPatel v.

(quoting Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 527, 599 S.E.2d 114, 120 (2004)).\r\nIn Divine v.\r\n  Robbins, 385 S.C. 23, 33, 683 S.E.2d 286, 291&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009), the\r\n  mother claimed the pivotal issue in determining custody was who to blame for\r\n  the outbursts and altercations between the parties.   However, the family\r\n  court's order considered the mother's behavior and the tumultuous nature of the\r\n  parties' relationship as one of many factors in its decision, as is statutorily\r\n  required in resolving custody issues.  Id.

Code Ann. § 20-7-1530) (stating that in making a\r\n  decision regarding child custody, the family court must, in addition to other\r\n  factors, give weight to evidence of domestic violence)).  Further, although a\r\n  parent's morality is a proper factor for consideration, it is only relevant if\r\n  it either directly or indirectly affects the welfare of the child.  Davenport\r\n    v. Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975).  &quot;Custody\r\n  of a child is not granted [to] a party as a reward or withheld [from a party] as\r\n  a punishment.&quot;  Id.  \r\nIn support of her argument\r\n  that the family court erred in awarding Husband custody, Wife points both to\r\n  Husband's anger issues and that he introduced Children to women with whom he\r\n  was involved.  Wife failed to show that Husband's relationships after their\r\n  separation have impacted Children negatively.  Children's counselor believed\r\n  that Ashley was a positive influence on Children.  Although Husband does seem\r\n  to have some anger issues, they do not seem to be directed at Children.  In\r\n  comparing the situation at his home to that at Wife's, his is the more\r\n  desirable situation.  Both Children have lived in Greenville their entire lives\r\n  and one is currently enrolled in school there.  Children have been living with Husband\r\n  since the temporary order and are doing well there.  Wife indicates she has no\r\n  intention of returning to Greenville but instead plans to remain in Tennessee. \r\n  The testimony presented indicates Children have many more behavioral problems when\r\n  in Tennessee with Wife.  Based on our review of the record, we find the family\r\n  court properly awarded Husband custody of Children.  Accordingly, the family\r\n  court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wife had previously battled a prescription drug\r\n  habit.\r\n[2] Lortab is used to relieve moderate to severe pain.\r\n[3] Topamax is used to treat seizures in people with\r\n  epilepsy.  It is also used to prevent migraines.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-113","title":"State v.

Lafferty and Charles Spychala on\r\n  charges of presenting a false insurance claim for payment.  We reverse and\r\n  remand.\r\nRespondents were\r\n  each indicted on charges of third-degree arson and presenting a false insurance\r\n  claim for payment.  They were tried together on all charges and were\r\n  represented by the same attorney.  The charges arose from the destruction of a\r\n  boat owned by Lafferty and Lafferty's subsequent attempt to recover from his\r\n  insurer for the loss.  Spychala was listed on Lafferty's insurance policy as a\r\n  regular operator of the boat and was with Lafferty when firefighters were called\r\n  to investigate the incident. \r\nThe jury\r\n  acquitted Respondents on the arson charges, but convicted them on the charges\r\n  of presenting a false insurance claim for payment.  Immediately after the\r\n  verdicts were received, defense counsel moved for a new trial on the false claim\r\n  charges, arguing convictions on those charges were inconsistent with acquittals\r\n  on the arson charges.  Over the State's objection, the trial judge granted the\r\n  motion.  \r\nThe trial judge\r\n  initially granted the new trial motion from the bench, but later issued a\r\n  written order in the matter with the following explanation for his ruling:  \r\n\r\n  In the present trial, the only evidence presented by the Attorney\r\n    General that the Defendants presented a false claim for payment was that they\r\n    committed arson on their property (a boat) that was the insured property.  The\r\n    Jury has clearly found that the Defendants are not guilty of that arson.  Thus,\r\n    no evidence supported a verdict of &quot;guilty&quot; for Presenting a False\r\n    Claim.\r\n\r\nThe State argues\r\n  the trial judge committed an error of law in granting a new trial on the false\r\n  claim charges based solely on Respondents' acquittals on the arson charges.  We\r\n  agree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  granting or refusal of a motion for a new trial is within the discretion of the\r\n  trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;  State v. Simmons, 279 S.C. 165, 166, 303 S.E.2d 857,\r\n  858 (1983).  &quot;Where there is no evidence to support a conviction, an order\r\n  granting a new trial should be upheld.&quot;  State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53,\r\n  55, 447 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1993).  &quot;However, where there is competent\r\n  evidence to sustain the jury's verdict, the judge may not substitute his\r\n  judgment for that of the jury.&quot;  State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 63,\r\n  447 S.E.2d 177, 181 (1993).     \r\nIn State v.\r\n  Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382-83, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149-50 (1991), the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court formally abolished the rule prohibiting inconsistent\r\n  verdicts.  In support of its ruling, the court referenced United States v.\r\n    Powell, 469 U.S. 57 (1984), wherein the United States Supreme Court\r\n  &quot;reasoned that a jury might merely be lenient towards a defendant when it\r\n  refuses to convict him of all counts.&quot;  Alexander, 303 S.C. at 383,\r\n  401 S.E.2d at 149 (citing Powell, 469 U.S. at 65).  \r\nWe are mindful that the trial court has the discretion to decide\r\n  whether an accused is entitled to have a charge retried.  Nevertheless, if the\r\n  appellate court determines the grant of a new trial to an accused was based on\r\n  an incorrect legal conclusion, reversal of the grant is warranted.  See State\r\n    v. Des Champs, 126 S.C. 416, 421, 120 S.E.2d 491, 493 (1923) (holding the\r\n  grant of a new trial was based on an erroneous legal conclusion and remanding\r\n  the matter to the circuit court for sentencing).  Here, it is evident from both\r\n  the colloquy between the trial judge and the State's attorney and the written\r\n  order granting the new trial motion that the trial judge believed he was\r\n  required to grant the motion solely because Respondents were not convicted of\r\n  arson.  Because prohibition of inconsistent verdicts is no longer the rule in\r\n  this State, we hold that the grant of a new trial in this case was based on an\r\n  error of law.  Further, because we find ample evidence in the record that could\r\n  support convictions on the false claim charges, a new trial on those charges is\r\n  not warranted in this case.  \r\nTherefore, we\r\n  reverse the grant of a new trial to Lafferty and Spychala on the false claim\r\n  charges and remand the matter to the trial court for sentencing on those charges.\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-115","title":"Little v.

Jack Lingefelt (collectively, Appellants) appeal the circuit court's grant\r\n  of partial summary judgment to Anderson County on the issue of the validity of\r\n  Anderson County Ordinance No. 2000-028.  Appellants argue (1) genuine issues of\r\n  material fact exist and (2) the circuit court erred in determining the\r\n  ordinance to be legally valid.  We affirm.[1]\r\n1. The\r\n  circuit court did not err in determining that no genuine issues of material\r\n  fact exist.  Appellants have\r\n  failed to demonstrate any facts that are in dispute.  The parties agree on the\r\n  facts surrounding the adoption of the zoning ordinance.  Their disagreement\r\n  pertains to the ordinance's legality, not to the events leading to its\r\n  enactment.  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in finding there to be\r\n  no factual dispute.  See Rule 56(c), SCRCP (&quot;[Summary] judgment . . .\r\n  shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;).\r\n2. Because Appellants\r\n  failed to challenge the validity of the zoning ordinance within sixty days of\r\n  its enactment and because Anderson County\r\n  substantially complied with its own procedures for ordinance adoption, we\r\n  affirm the circuit court's decision upholding the ordinance's legality.  See S.C. Code Ann. § 6-29-760(D) (2004) (&quot;No\r\n  challenge to the adequacy of notice or challenge to the validity of a\r\n  regulation or map, or amendment to it, whether enacted before or after the\r\n  effective date of this section, may be made sixty days after the\r\n  decision of the governing body if there has been substantial compliance with\r\n  the notice requirements of this section or with established procedures of the\r\n  governing authority or the planning commission.&quot; (emphasis added)).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  KONDUROS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-119","title":"State v.

Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Arnold Ward appeals his conviction for\r\n  attempted first-degree burglary.  On appeal, Ward contends the trial court\r\n  erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because the State failed to\r\n  provide sufficient evidence to show Ward intended to commit first-degree\r\n  burglary.  We disagree.  \r\n&quot;When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial\r\n  court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its\r\n  weight.&quot;  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648\r\n  (2006).  &quot;A defendant is entitled to\r\n  a directed verdict when the [S]tate fails to produce evidence of the offense\r\n  charged.&quot;  Id.  &quot;When reviewing a denial of a directed\r\n  verdict, [an appellate c]ourt views the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  in the light most favorable to the [S]tate.&quot;  Id.  &quot;If there\r\n  is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably\r\n  tending to prove the guilt of the accused, the [appellate c]ourt must find the\r\n  case was properly submitted to the jury.&quot;  Id. at 292-93, 625\r\n  S.E.2d at 648.  \r\n&quot;A person is guilty of\r\n  burglary in the first degree if the person enters a dwelling without consent\r\n  and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling, and . . . the entering or\r\n  remaining occurs in the nighttime.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. §&nbsp;16-11-311(A)(3)\r\n  (2003).  &quot;A person who commits the common law offense of attempt is\r\n  punishable as for the principal offense. . . . [T]he mens rea of an attempt\r\n  crime is one of specific intent such that the act constituting the attempt must\r\n  be done with the intent to commit that particular crime.&quot;  State v.\r\n    Reid, 383 S.C. 285, 292, 679 S.E.2d 194, 197-98 (Ct.

Jung, of Mt. Pleasant, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Denise McCauley, pro se, of Mt. Pleasant,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  JSP Consulting, LLC d/b/a The Neutrino Group (JSP)\r\n  appeals the circuit court's denial of its motion to compel arbitration in a\r\n  dispute arising from McCauley's purchase of stenography equipment.  JSP argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in concluding that the parties' arbitration agreement was unconscionable. \r\n  We reverse and remand for an order compelling arbitration. \r\nSouth Carolina courts must\r\n  examine two factors to determine whether an agreement is unconscionable: (1) whether the party opposing the agreement\r\n  lacked a meaningful choice in entering into the agreement and (2) whether the\r\n  agreement's terms are &quot;so oppressive that no reasonable person would make\r\n  them and no fair and honest person would accept them.&quot;  Simpson v. MSA\r\n    of Myrtle Beach, Inc., 373 S.C. 14, 24-25, 644 S.E.2d 663, 668 (2007).  Furthermore, &quot;the Fourth Circuit has\r\n  instructed courts to focus generally on whether the arbitration clause is\r\n  geared towards achieving an unbiased decision by a neutral decision-maker&quot;\r\n  when considering whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable.  Id. at 25, 644 S.E.2d at 668-69 (citing Hooters of Am., Inc. v.\r\n    Phillips, 173 F.3d 933, 938-40 (4th Cir. 1999)).  \r\nJSP concedes that the\r\n  arbitration agreement is an adhesion contract because it was offered on a\r\n  &quot;take-it-or-leave-it&quot; basis with terms that were not negotiable.  See Simpson, 373 S.C. at 26-27, 644 S.E.2d at 669 (defining the term\r\n  &quot;adhesion contract&quot;).  However, JSP argues that the agreement does\r\n  not fall within the second prong of unconscionability, i.e., the agreement's terms\r\n  &quot;are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair\r\n  and honest person would accept them.&quot;  Simpson,  373 S.C. at 24-25,\r\n  644 S.E.2d at 668.  We agree.\r\nIn finding the arbitration\r\n  agreement oppressive, the circuit court concluded that its requirement to\r\n  arbitrate issues in Colorado was unfair.  However, the agreement allows\r\n  McCauley to select one of the following alternatives to an in-person hearing: a\r\n  hearing by submission of documents; a telephone hearing; or an online hearing. \r\n  Further, nothing in the record suggests the agreement's language is not geared\r\n  toward achieving an unbiased decision by a neutral arbitrator.  The agreement\r\n  requires the arbitration to be governed by the rules of the National\r\n  Arbitration Forum (NAF), which provide a neutral process for the selection of\r\n  an arbitrator.  Therefore, McCauley's selection of an alternative to an in-person\r\n  hearing would not place her at a disadvantage.     \r\nThe circuit court also\r\n  concluded that the costs associated with arbitration are unfair.  While the\r\n  arbitration agreement provides that the party pursuing a claim pays his own costs,\r\n  it also acknowledges the prevailing party may request an award of costs.  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the\r\n  circuit court erred in concluding that the arbitration agreement was oppressive. \r\n  Therefore, we need not address JSP's alternative argument concerning the\r\n  severability of the forum selection clause.  See Futch v. McAllister\r\n    Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n  (noting an appellate court need not address appellant's remaining issues when\r\n  its determination of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER, KONDUROS, and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-129","title":"State v.

Sammataro and J. Brandon\r\n          Hylton, both of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Billy Joseph Powell appeals the order of the\r\n  Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission\r\n  (Appellate Panel) reversing the single commissioner's finding that Powell\r\n  suffered a compensable work-related injury.  On appeal, Powell argues the\r\n  Appellate Panel erred in (1) disregarding Dr. Rodney Alan's testimony; (2)\r\n  disregarding Powell's testimony concerning his injury; and (3) reversing the\r\n  single commissioner's finding that Powell's July 19, 2009 injury was causally\r\n  related to the original March 31, 2009 left knee injury.  We affirm.[1]\r\n&quot;The [Appellate Panel]\r\n  is the ultimate fact finder in Workers' Compensation\r\n  cases and is not bound by the [s]ingle [c]ommissioner's findings of\r\n  fact.&quot;  Pack v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 381 S.C. 526, 532, 673\r\n  S.E.2d 461, 464 (Ct. App. 2009).  &quot;[The\r\n  Appellate Panel] shall weigh the evidence as presented at the initial hearing\r\n  and, if good grounds are shown, make its own findings of fact and reach its own conclusions of law consistent or inconsistent with those\r\n  of the [s]ingle [c]ommissioner.&quot;  Id.  &quot;[W]hile medical testimony is entitled to great respect, the fact finder may disregard it if other competent evidence is\r\n  presented.&quot;  Potter v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. 7, 395 S.C. 17, 23,\r\n  716 S.E.2d 123, 126 (Ct. App. 2011).  Accordingly,\r\n  &quot;[t]he final determination of witness credibility\r\n  and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.&quot;  Id.   \r\nWe find substantial evidence\r\n  exists to support the Appellate Panel's findings that Powell did not suffer a\r\n  compensable work-related injury.  See S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380(5)(e)\r\n  (Supp. 2011) (providing the appellate court must affirm a decision of the\r\n  Appellate Panel when substantial evidence exists to support the decision).  Here,\r\n  Powell testified the pain subsided shortly after the fall, and he was able to\r\n  perform his work duties without any difficulty on the day of the fall. \r\n  Additionally, Dr. Alan, an orthopedic surgeon, diagnosed Powell with severe\r\n  arthritis resulting in cartilage loss and a meniscus tear.  Dr. Alan also testified\r\n  his medical notes indicated Powell had told him he had the knee pain for more\r\n  than a year and he could not identify a particular injury or overuse that could\r\n  have caused or contributed to the pain in his knees.  Dr. Alan stated Powell's\r\n  work did not cause the arthritis.  \r\nMoreover, because substantial\r\n  evidence supports the Appellate Panel's findings that the March 31, 2009 injury\r\n  was not a compensable work-related injury, this court need not address Powell's\r\n  argument that the March 31, 2009 injury was causally related to the July 19,\r\n  2009 injury.  See Futch v.
