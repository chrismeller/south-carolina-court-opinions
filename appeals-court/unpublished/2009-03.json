Edwards, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2009-UP-104\r\n  Heard January 21, 2009 â€“ Filed March 2,\r\n2009 \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Candy M. Kern-Fuller, of Piedmont, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Robert K. Whitney, of Seneca, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In\r\n  this action for separate support and maintenance, Lois Jean Ryan (Wife) appeals\r\n  the family court's award of alimony, apportionment of marital property, and\r\n  award of attorney's fees.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nWife\r\n  and William Francis Ryan (Husband) were married approximately twenty years\r\n  before they separated in 2005.Â  Husband subsequently filed this action\r\n  requesting separate maintenance and support, division of the marital property,\r\n  and attorney's fees.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  a hearing, the family court issued a final order of separate maintenance.Â  In\r\n  its order, the family court awarded Husband alimony and attorney's fees,\r\n  awarded Wife the marital home, ordered Wife to provide Husband medical\r\n  insurance, and equally apportioned the marital property.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed. \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI. ALIMONY\r\nWife argues the family court erred in awarding Husband\r\n  alimony without weighing the factors set forth in section 20-3-130(C) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008).Â  Specifically, Wife asserts the family court\r\n  should have considered Husband's fault contributing to the breakup of the\r\n  marriage.Â  Moreover, Wife asserts Husband's adultery barred an award of\r\n  alimony.Â  Finally, Wife argues even if the family court did not err in awarding\r\n  Husband alimony, the amount of the award was grossly disproportionate.\r\nThe\r\n  family court judge may grant alimony in such amounts and for such term as the\r\n  judge considers appropriate under the circumstances. Â Smith v. Smith,\r\n  327 S.C. 448, 462, 486 S.E.2d 516, 523 (Ct. App.1997). Â The family court is\r\n  required to consider the following factors in making an alimony award: (1)\r\n  duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the\r\n  parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and\r\n  earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the\r\n  marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7)\r\n  current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and\r\n  nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital\r\n  misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support obligations;\r\n  as well as (13) other factors the court considers relevant. S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  The court must consider all relevant factors in determining\r\n  alimony. Â Davis v. Davis, 372 S.C. 64, 80, 641 S.E.2d 446,\r\n  454&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006); see also Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281,\r\n  290, 555 S.E.2d 386, 391 (2001) (finding the trial court's denial of alimony\r\n  was erroneous because the court did not address &quot;several important factors&quot;\r\n  when determining no alimony should be awarded). Â &quot;Our inquiry on appeal is\r\n  not whether the family court gave the same weight to particular factors as this\r\n  court would have; rather, our inquiry extends only to whether the family court\r\n  abused its considerable discretion in assigning weight to the applicable\r\n  factors.&quot; Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 186, 554 S.E.2d 421, 425\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nHere,\r\n  both Husband and Wife testified at the hearing that Husband's misconduct or\r\n  fault contributed to the breakup of their marriage.Â  Specifically, Husband\r\n  testified he and Wife separated because his &quot;son had [him] arrested for\r\n  assault and battery.&quot;Â  Wife also pursued two restraining orders against\r\n  husband because of his abusive behavior toward their son.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court, however, did not consider this testimony in determining alimony.Â \r\n  In fact, the order provides: &quot;neither party alleged marital misconduct on\r\n  the other that could constitute fault grounds for divorce.&quot;Â  Pursuant to\r\n  section 20-3-130(C)(10), the family court should have considered fault, even\r\n  though it was not used as a basis for divorce or separate maintenance.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we remand this issue to the family court and direct the court to redetermine\r\n  alimony, considering all relevant factors, especially including Husband's\r\n  fault.\r\nWife's\r\n  argument that Husband's adultery bars the award of alimony is without merit.Â \r\n  The only testimony at the hearing regarding adultery concerned an affair that\r\n  occurred several years before the couple's separation, and the couple\r\n  reconciled after Husband's affair.Â  See Doe v. Doe, 286\r\n  S.C. 507, 512, 334 S.E.2d 829, 832 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding husband could not\r\n  avail himself of the statute barring alimony to an adulterous spouse when\r\n  husband condoned wife's adultery; thus wife was still\r\n  eligible for alimony).\r\n We need not address the issue of whether the alimony was grossly\r\n  disproportionate because we are remanding this case for a redetermination of\r\n  alimony. Â See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, 335 S.C.\r\n  598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding an appellate court need\r\n  not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is\r\n  dispositive of the appeal). \r\nII. MARITAL AND\r\n  NON-MARITAL PROPERTY \r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred by failing to weigh Husband's fault in the\r\n  breakup of the marriage in apportioning the marital property.Â  Wife also argues\r\n  the family court erred by apportioning non-marital property.\r\nIn determining an\r\n  equitable distribution of marital property, the family court must identify,\r\n  value, and equitably apportion the property. Â Johnson v. Johnson, 288\r\n  S.C. 270, 276, 341 S.E.2d 811, 815 (Ct. App. 1986). Â The court must consider\r\n  several factors in making an equitable distribution. Â S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-620 (Supp. 2008) (outlining\r\n  fifteen factors for the family court to consider in equitable distribution). Â Included\r\n  in those factors is the marital misconduct or fault of either party. Â S.C. Code Ann Â§ 20-3-620(2)\r\n  (Supp. 2008).\r\nHere,\r\n  as set forth above, the only mention of Husband's fault in the family court\r\n  order provides: &quot;neither party alleged marital misconduct on the other\r\n  that could constitute fault grounds for divorce.&quot;Â  Because the family\r\n  court failed to consider Husband's fault when apportioning marital property, we\r\n  reverse and remand this issue for the family court to examine all of the\r\n  factors set forth in section 20-3-620 and redetermine the equitable\r\n  distribution of the marital property.\r\nWe\r\n  need not address Wife's argument regarding nonmarital property because we are\r\n  remanding the entire issue of apportionment to the family court.Â  See Futch,\r\n  335 S.C. at 613, 518 S.E.2d at 598.\r\nIII. ATTORNEY'S FEES\r\nWife\r\n  argues the family court erred by awarding Husband attorney's fees without\r\n  making specific findings of fact on the record regarding each of the required\r\n  factors to be considered.\r\nIn a\r\n  family court matter, &quot;[t]he award of attorney's fees . . . will only be\r\n  disturbed upon a showing of abuse of discretion.&quot;&nbsp; Upchurch v.\r\n    Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648 (2006).&nbsp; &quot;A\r\n  decision lacking a discernible reason is arbitrary and constitutes an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;&nbsp; Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 304, 372\r\n  S.E.2d 107, 115 (Ct. App. 1988).&nbsp; \r\nThe\r\n  family court has jurisdiction to award reasonable attorney's fees when a claim\r\n  for attorney's fees is well-founded.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-3-120-140 (Supp.\r\n  2008).&nbsp; The decision whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees is within the\r\n  discretion of the family court.&nbsp; Upchurch, 367 S.C. at 28, 624\r\n  S.E.2d at 648.&nbsp; In determining whether to award attorney's fees, the\r\n  family court should consider each party's ability to pay his or her own fees,\r\n  the beneficial results obtained, the parties' respective financial conditions,\r\n  and the effect of the fee on the parties' standards of living.&nbsp; E.D.M.\r\n    v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).&nbsp; \r\nHere,\r\n  we are reversing and remanding this action to the family court.Â  Husband's\r\n  attorney, therefore, has not obtained beneficial results on appeal.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we vacate the family court's award of attorney's fees.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs\r\n  set forth above, we reverse and remand this action for the family court to\r\n  reexamine the issues of alimony, equitable distribution, and attorney's fees.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT\r\nand KONDUROS, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-105","title":"Stiggers-Smith v.

Hodges, both of Greenville, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Andrew G. Goodson, of Fountain Inn, Linda C. Hayes, of Greenville,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Dr. Arthur Smith\r\n  (Dr. Smith) appeals the family court's finding that he and Wilma Brea Stiggers-Smith\r\n  (Mrs. Stiggers-Smith) entered into a common-law marriage.Â  Dr. Smith also\r\n  appeals the admission of an affidavit into evidence and the family court's\r\n  failure to address his request for reimbursement of fees paid to Mrs.\r\n  Stiggers-Smith and for attorney fees.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nMrs.\r\n  Stiggers-Smith and Dr. Smith indicated they began a romantic relationship\r\n  sometime around 1989 in Texas.Â  The couple moved to approximately three other\r\n  states together before eventually moving to South Carolina in February 1999.Â \r\n  The couple never participated in a civil marriage ceremony.Â  In 2006, the\r\n  couple separated.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  moving to South Carolina, Dr. Smith and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith purchased a home\r\n  together.Â  In this home, the couple shared a bedroom and a traditional marital\r\n  relationship.Â  The couple also purchased a vehicle together in South\r\n  Carolina.Â Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  their relationship in South Carolina, Mrs. Stiggers-Smith began using Dr. Smith's\r\n  last name as her own.Â  Mrs. Stiggers-Smith signed contracts for the purchase of\r\n  their home and their vehicle with the last name of Smith.Â  Mrs. Stiggers-Smith\r\n  also received substantial amounts of mail at the couple's house addressed to\r\n  either &quot;Brea Stiggers-Smith&quot; or &quot;Brea Smith.&quot;Â \r\n  Additionally, Mrs. Stiggers-Smith's business cards read &quot;Brea\r\n  Stiggers-Smith,&quot; and she used the name &quot;Brea Smith&quot; on school\r\n  projects.Â  Further, when Dr. Smith's sister passed away in 2006, Mrs.\r\n  Stiggers-Smith was listed in the program as a sister-in-law.Â  \r\nMrs.\r\n  Stiggers-Smith, however, stated on her South Carolina income tax returns that\r\n  she was single, as did Dr. Smith.Â  She also stated she was single when filling\r\n  out a W-4 form for her employer.Â  Moreover, Mrs. Stiggers-Smith also used the\r\n  name &quot;Wilma Stiggers&quot; on her South Carolina voter registration card.[1]Â Â Â  \r\nFollowing the\r\n  couple's separation, Mrs. Stiggers-Smith filed a complaint requesting the\r\n  determination of a common-law marriage, alimony, division of assets and debts,\r\n  attorney fees, and other related relief.Â  A temporary hearing was held, which\r\n  resulted in the family court ordering Dr. Smith to continue paying Mrs.\r\n  Stiggers-Smith's rent and car payment.Â  Dr. Smith was also ordered to pay Mrs.\r\n  Stiggers-Smith's attorney $1,500.Â  The temporary order, however, allowed for\r\n  Dr. Smith to seek reimbursement if a common-law marriage was not found to\r\n  exist.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  a final hearing, the family court found Mrs. Stiggers-Smith and Dr. Smith\r\n  entered into a common-law marriage in South Carolina.Â  Mrs. Stiggers-Smith was,\r\n  therefore, allowed to proceed with her divorce action.Â  Dr. Smith was ordered\r\n  to pay Mrs. Stiggers-Smith's attorney fees and costs.Â  Dr. Smith filed a motion\r\n  to reconsider, which the family court denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;Whether a common-law marriage exists is a\r\n  question of law.&quot;Â  Callen v. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, 623, 620 S.E.2d\r\n  59, 62 (2005).Â  The party alleging the existence of the marriage carries the\r\n  burden of proving the elements by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id.Â \r\n  This Court's review is limited to determining whether or not there is any\r\n  evidence to support the findings of the family court.Â  Tarnowski v.\r\n    Lieberman, 348 S.C. 616, 619, 560 S.E.2d 438, 440 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  &quot;Because\r\n  this action sounds in law, and the existence of a common[-]law marriage is a\r\n  question of fact, this [C]ourt is bound by the [family] court's factual\r\n  findings, and its credibility determinations.&quot;Â  Id.Â  This Court may\r\n  not act as the fact-finder but must instead affirm the family court's findings\r\n  if there is any evidence in the record to support those findings.[2]Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDr. Smith argues\r\n  the family court erred in finding he and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith entered into a\r\n  common-law marriage.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn South Carolina,\r\n  a valid common-law marriage requires &quot;a mutual agreement between the\r\n  parties to assume toward each other the relation of husband and wife.&quot;Â  Johnson\r\n    v. Johnson, 235 S.C. 542, 550, 112 S.E.2d 647, 651 (1960).Â  As with any\r\n  marriage, a contract to be married must be entered between the husband and\r\n  wife, but with a common-law marriage, no express contract is required.Â  Callen,\r\n  365 S.C. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62.Â  Instead, &quot;the agreement may be\r\n  inferred from the circumstances.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nDue\r\n  to the lack of direct evidence demonstrating the requisite intent of the\r\n  parties to be married, circumstantial evidence is often used to prove the\r\n  existence of a common-law marriage.Â  Barker v. Baker, 330 S.C. 361,\r\n  367-68, 499 S.E.2d 503, 507 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  &quot;The circumstantial evidence\r\n  typically relied upon to establish a common-law marriage includes evidence\r\n  establishing that the parties have lived together for an extended period of\r\n  time and have publicly held themselves out as husband and wife.&quot;Â  Id. at 368, 499 S.E.2d at 507; see Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 545-46,\r\n  466 S.E.2d 373, 374-75 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding the evidence demonstrated the existence\r\n  of a common-law marriage when (1) the parties lived together, (2) the wife\r\n  began using the husband's last name as her own, (3) the parties formed numerous\r\n  contracts as husband and wife, and (4) the wife made numerous purchases of\r\n  products and services using the husband's last name).Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  a party presents evidence of &quot;'apparently matrimonial' cohabitation&quot;\r\n  and a reputation in the community as being a married couple, a rebuttable\r\n  presumption arises that the parties entered into a common-law marriage.Â  Callen,\r\n  365 S.C. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62.Â  &quot;Strong, cogent&quot; evidence that\r\n  the parties never agreed to marry is needed to overcome this presumption.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Additionally, &quot;[a] party need not understand every nuance of marriage or\r\n  divorce law, but he [or she] must at least know that his [or her] actions will\r\n  render him [or her] married as that word is commonly understood.&quot;Â  Id. at 626, 620 S.E.2d at 63.Â  Â Â Â \r\nIf\r\n  there is an impediment to marriage, no common-law marriage may be formed.Â  Id. at 62, 620 S.E.2d at 624.Â  &quot;A relationship illicit at its inception does\r\n  not ripen into a common[-]law marriage once the impediment to marriage is\r\n  removed[,]&quot; but instead the law presumes the relationship retains its\r\n  illicit character.Â  Yarbrough v. Yarbrough, 280 S.C. 546, 551, 314\r\n  S.E.2d 16, 19 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Evidence of an agreement to enter into a\r\n  common-law marriage after the removal of the impediment is required to\r\n  demonstrate a common-law marriage arose, but the agreement may be revealed by\r\n  the conduct of the parties.Â  Id.Â  This agreement must, however, be\r\n  proven by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  Kirby v. Kirby, 270 S.C.\r\n  137, 141, 241 S.E.2d 415, 416 (1978).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Dr. Smith and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith began their relationship in\r\n  Texas around 1989 and thereafter moved through approximately three states[3] together before settling in South Carolina in February 1999.Â  At trial, the\r\n  parties stipulated no common-law marriage existed before their move to South\r\n  Carolina.Â  Therefore, for a common-law marriage to exist, Dr. Smith and Mrs.\r\n  Stiggers-Smith must have had a mutual agreement to assume the relationship of\r\n  husband and wife while living in South Carolina.Â  See Callen, 365\r\n  S.C. at 625, 620 S.E.2d at 63 (stating the proponent of the alleged marriage\r\n  has the burden of proving the parties entered into a marital agreement after\r\n  moving from states that do not recognize common-law marriages to South\r\n  Carolina).Â  The family court found Mrs. Stiggers-Smith carried her burden of\r\n  demonstrating the couple entered such an agreement while living in South\r\n  Carolina.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court's order stated &quot;the [common-law] marriage came into existence\r\n  when [Dr. Smith and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith] moved into South Carolina in February\r\n  of 1999.&quot;Â  The order then proceeded with a thorough analysis of the couple's\r\n  behavior once living in South Carolina, and from this behavior the family court\r\n  determined both parties intended to be married and held themselves out to the\r\n  community as a married couple.Â  When reading the order as a whole, it is clear\r\n  the family court did not find the couple's relationship converted into a\r\n  common-law marriage when they moved to South Carolina; rather, the family court\r\n  found Dr. Smith's and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith's actions after their move to South\r\n  Carolina demonstrated their intent to enter into a common-law marriage while\r\n  living in South Carolina.Â  Pursuant to our standard of review, this Court must\r\n  only determine whether any evidence supports the family court's finding, and we\r\n  find there is evidence in the record to support this finding.Â  See id. at 629, 620 S.E.2d at 64-65 (Toal, C.J., dissenting) (stating the issue of\r\n  whether a couple is common-law married is a question of law, and therefore, the\r\n  appellate courts only determine whether the evidence supports the facts found\r\n  by the family court).Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  living in South Carolina, Dr. Smith and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith lived together in\r\n  what appeared to be a matrimonial manner.Â  The couple shared a bedroom and\r\n  everything else that a married couple shares in a marital relationship.Â  This\r\n  cohabitation continued until 2006 when Dr. Smith asked Mrs. Stiggers-Smith to\r\n  move out of their home.Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  moving to South Carolina, Dr. Smith and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith also appeared to\r\n  hold themselves out to the community as a married couple.Â  Mrs. Stiggers-Smith\r\n  testified she began using Dr. Smith's last name once they moved to South\r\n  Carolina.Â  Mrs. Stiggers-Smith used this last name on contracts, school\r\n  materials, and business cards.Â  She also received substantial amounts of mail\r\n  at the couple's home, including letters, bills, magazines, and catalogs,\r\n  addressed to either &quot;Brea Stiggers-Smith&quot; or &quot;Brea Smith.&quot;Â \r\n  Dr. Smith and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith also received mail at their home as a couple,\r\n  including Christmas cards in 2002 from one of Dr. Smith's office employees and\r\n  one of his business associates.Â  These cards were addressed to &quot;Mr. and\r\n  Mrs. Arthur Smith&quot; and &quot;Arthur and Brea Smith,&quot; respectively.Â \r\n  There was no testimony presented indicating Dr. Smith ever objected to Mrs. Stiggers-Smith's\r\n  use of his last name.Â Â Â  \r\nShortly\r\n  after their move to South Carolina, Mrs. Stiggers-Smith assumed the task of\r\n  finding a house for the couple.Â  After finding one, Dr. Smith and Mrs.\r\n  Stiggers-Smith met with a realtor to sign a purchase agreement.Â  The parties\r\n  were each listed under &quot;Purchaser&quot; and signed their names as &quot;Arthur\r\n  L. Smith, M.D.&quot; and &quot;W. Brea Smith.&quot;Â  The parties additionally\r\n  signed multiple addendums to the purchase agreement and again used the names &quot;Arthur\r\n  L. Smith, M.D.&quot; and &quot;W. Brea Smith.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Dr. Smith and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith purchased a vehicle together in South\r\n  Carolina.Â  Again, each party was listed as a purchaser of the vehicle, and they\r\n  signed their names as &quot;Arthur L. Smith, M.D.&quot; and &quot;Wilma B.\r\n  Stiggers Smith.&quot;Â  The car salesman from this purchase testified the couple\r\n  held themselves out to him as being married and stated Dr. Smith never objected\r\n  to the paperwork listing Mrs. Stiggers-Smith as &quot;Wilma S. Smith.&quot;Â Â Â Â  \r\nMrs.\r\n  Stiggers-Smith's close friend, Marilyn Davis (Davis), also testified she was\r\n  under the impression Dr. Smith and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith were husband and wife.Â \r\n  Davis testified she often called the couple's home and when speaking to Dr.\r\n  Smith she would ask if she could &quot;speak to [his] lovely or beautiful wife.&quot;Â \r\n  Davis stated Dr. Smith &quot;never once disputed that [Mrs. Stiggers-Smith]\r\n  wasn't his wife or [she] never would have addressed [Mrs. Stiggers-Smith] in\r\n  such a way.&quot;Â  Davis, who was also a patient of Dr. Smith, additionally\r\n  recalled that during appointments with Dr. Smith she would make conversation by\r\n  &quot;ask[ing] him how his wife was doing.&quot;Â  Davis again acknowledged Dr.\r\n  Smith never once corrected her by explaining he and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith were\r\n  not married.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  Mrs. Stiggers-Smith testified that even though she felt like she and Dr. Smith\r\n  had been married since their relationship began in Texas, she understood her\r\n  actions of using Dr. Smith's last name and signing various deeds and contracts\r\n  with Dr. Smith would render her married once living in South Carolina.Â  To the\r\n  contrary, Dr. Smith testified he was not aware Mrs. Stiggers-Smith used his\r\n  last name until he received a copy of the complaint and therefore had no\r\n  opportunity to object to her use of his last name.Â  Dr. Smith stated he failed\r\n  to notice Mrs. Stiggers-Smith's signature on the agreement to purchase the car,\r\n  an insurance agreement, the retail installment contract, or the real estate\r\n  contract and its addendums.Â  He also testified he never noticed the name &quot;Smith&quot;\r\n  appearing on letters, bills, magazines, and catalogs Mrs. Stiggers-Smith\r\n  received at the couple's home.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court found the exhibits and witnesses presented by Mrs. Stiggers-Smith\r\n  overwhelmingly supported a finding that the parties entered into a common-law\r\n  marriage. Â The family court additionally found Dr. Smith's testimony\r\n  unconvincing, and as the appellate court, we are bound by this credibility\r\n  determination.Â  See Tarnowski, 348 S.C. at 619, 560 S.E.2d at 440\r\n  (&quot;Because [the issue of common-law marriage] sounds in law, and the\r\n  existence of a common[-]law marriage is a question of fact, this [C]ourt is\r\n  bound by the [family] court's factual findings, and its credibility\r\n  determinations.&quot;).Â Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find there is evidence to support the family court's\r\n  finding of a common-law marriage between Dr. Smith and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith.Â \r\n  While we acknowledge the existence of conflicting evidence regarding the couple's\r\n  marital status, we are bound by our standard of review and, therefore, affirm\r\n  the family court's determination.Â Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Smith next argues the family court committed reversible error by admitting an\r\n  affidavit from an unknown, non-testifying person into evidence.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  July 2002, Mrs. Stiggers-Smith transferred her interest in the couple's house\r\n  to Dr. Smith.Â  Attached to this deed was an affidavit prepared by an unknown\r\n  individual who did not testify at trial.Â  This affidavit stated no\r\n  consideration was needed in the deed transfer between &quot;Brea Smith a/k/a\r\n  Wilma Brea Stiggers&quot; and &quot;Arthur L. Smith&quot; because it was a\r\n  transfer &quot;between husband and wife.&quot;Â  Mrs. Stiggers-Smith introduced\r\n  this affidavit at trial to show the public's perception of Mrs. Stiggers-Smith\r\n  and Dr. Smith as a married couple.Â  Dr. Smith objected arguing hearsay, but the\r\n  family court overruled the objection.Â Â Â  \r\nWhether\r\n  or not this evidence was hearsay, &quot;the improper admission of hearsay is\r\n  reversible error only when the admission causes prejudice.&quot;Â  Small v.\r\n    Pioneer Machinery, Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 470, 494 S.E.2d 835, 846 (Ct. App.\r\n  1997).Â  &quot;Where the hearsay is merely cumulative to other evidence, its\r\n  admission is harmless.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record contains evidence other than the affidavit which demonstrated Dr. Smith\r\n  and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith held themselves out to the community as a married\r\n  couple.Â  The affidavit was merely cumulative to that evidence.Â  Thus, if an\r\n  error occurred in its admission, the error was not prejudicial, and the family\r\n  court did not commit reversible error by admitting the affidavit into evidence.Â  See id. (finding no prejudice when a statement that was possibly\r\n  hearsay was admitted into evidence because the statement was cumulative to\r\n  other evidence in the record).Â Â Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  Dr. Smith argues the family court erred in failing to address his counterclaims\r\n  for reimbursements, attorney fees, and costs.Â  We find this argument abandoned\r\n  on appeal.Â Â Â  \r\nÂ An\r\n  issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the argument\r\n  is raised in a brief but not supported by authority. Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb,\r\n  362 S.C. 588, 600, 608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Dr. Smith failed to\r\n  cite any authority in support of his position, and therefore, we will not\r\n  address the argument.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the family court's order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\nPIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Mrs. Stiggers-Smith stated the reason she put\r\n  &quot;single&quot; on these documents was due to her belief she needed an\r\n  actual marriage license or piece of paper stating she was married in order to\r\n  avoid problems.Â  \r\n[2] During oral argument, both parties asserted this\r\n  Court had the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence; however, we find the standard of review stated\r\n  in Callen, 365 S.C. at 623, 620 S.E.2d at 62, and its preceding\r\n  authority to be controlling precedent upon this Court.Â  Â Â Â \r\n[3] Dr. Smith and Mrs. Stiggers-Smith moved from Texas to\r\n  Missouri to Louisiana and then to Ohio before settling in South Carolina.Â \r\n  Apart from Texas, none of the states the couple resided in prior to South\r\n  Carolina recognize common-law marriages.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-106","title":"SCDSS v.

Cleary, 355 S.C. 216, 224, 584\r\n  S.E.2d 423, 427 (Ct. App. 2003) (internal citations omitted) (&quot;When\r\n  reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, an appellate court must consider the\r\n  charge as a whole in light\r\n  of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  If the charge is reasonably\r\n  free from error, isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute\r\n  reversible error. Â A jury charge is correct if it contains the correct\r\n  definition and adequately charges the law. Â The substance of the law is what\r\n  must be charged, not any particular verbiage.&quot;).Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  the circuit court's order is \r\nAFFIRMED.[1] \r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-140","title":"State v.

Nuessle, Family Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2009-UP-145\r\nSubmitted March 2, 2009 â€“ Filed March 17,\r\n  2009Â Â Â  \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tA. Shane Massey, of Aiken, and Charles C. Mayers, of Augusta, for\r\n  Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tAmanda F. Whittle, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: Shawna O.\r\n  (Mother) and David S. (Father) appeal from the family court's order of August\r\n  6, 2007, requiring them to comply with the terms of a South Carolina Department\r\n  of Social Services (DSS) Treatment Plan.Â  On appeal, Mother and Father argued\r\n  the family court erred in finding their four minor children (1) were neglected\r\n  or abused, and (2) could not be protected from further harm without\r\n  intervention.Â  We find a subsequent order of the family court has rendered\r\n  Mother's and Father's appeal moot. Accordingly, we dismiss their appeal.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nInitially, the attorneys for Mother and Father\r\n  submitted affidavits stating a review of the hearing transcript demonstrated\r\n  their appeals were without merit, and they asked to be relieved as counsel,\r\n  pursuant to Ex Parte Cauthen, 291 S.C. 465, 354 S.E.2d 381 (1987), and S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Frederick Downer, Sr., S.C. Sup. Ct. Order dated\r\n  February 2, 2005 (extending the procedure set forth in Cauthen to\r\n  situations where an indigent person appeals from an order imposing measures\r\n  short of termination of parental rights).Â  Thereafter, this court required\r\n  counsel to submit briefs addressing the merits of two specific issues in Mother's\r\n  and Father's appeal.Â  While this court was considering the briefs submitted in\r\n  this appeal, Father appealed a subsequent ruling of the family court.Â  \r\nThe family court's\r\n  order of July 31, 2008, found by a preponderance of the evidence that Mother's\r\n  and Father's children are abused or neglected due to Father's sexual abuse of one\r\n  child and Mother's neglect of their children. Â The order required Father to\r\n  have no contact with his daughters and only supervised contact with his sons\r\n  while DSS and law enforcement investigated the allegations against Mother and\r\n  Father.Â  Furthermore, the family court placed three of Mother's and Father's children\r\n  in DSS custody, and they now are residing in foster care.Â  The family court\r\n  allowed Mother to retain custody of two children under a safety plan that\r\n  prohibited Father from residing in the home with Mother and the children.Â \r\n  Moreover, the family court ordered DSS to develop new Treatment Plans for\r\n  Mother and Father that specifically addressed the issues that led to the\r\n  removal of three of their children.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nâ€œA moot case exists\r\n  where a judgment rendered by the court will have no practical legal effect upon\r\n  an existing controversy because an intervening event renders any grant of\r\n  effectual relief impossible for the reviewing court. Â If there is no actual\r\n  controversy, this Court will not decide moot or academic questions.â€ Â Seabrook\r\n    v. Knox, 369 S.C. 191, 197, 631 S.E.2d 907, 910 (2006) (internal citations\r\n  omitted).Â  â€œA\r\n  matter becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal\r\n  effect upon [the] existing controversy.Â  This is true when some event occurs\r\n  making it impossible for [the] reviewing Court to grant effectual relief.â€Â  Collins Music Co. v. IGT, 365 S.C. 544, 549, 619 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Curtis v. State,\r\n  345 S.C. 557, 549 S.E.2d 591 (2001), 535 U.S. 926 (2002) (stating a case\r\n  becomes moot when a decision, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect\r\n  upon the controversy); Waters v. S.C. Land Resources Conservation Commâ€™n,\r\n  321 S.C. 219, 467 S.E.2d 913 (1996) (explaining a &quot;justiciable&quot;\r\n  controversy is real and substantial controversy appropriate for judicial\r\n  determination).Â Â  \r\nOur\r\n  opinion in this case would have no practical effect because the family court's\r\n  order of July 31, 2008, has mooted the issue of whether the court erred in\r\n  ordering, on August 6, 2007, that Mother and Father comply with treatment plans.Â \r\n  Accordingly, Mother's and Father's appeal is\r\nDISMISSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., CURETON, A.J., and GOOLSBY, A., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-146","title":"SCDSS v.

Patterson, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2009-UP-157\r\nHeard March 3, 2009 â€“ Filed March 30, 2009\r\nVACATED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAppellate Defender Kathrine H. Hudgins, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â John\r\n  Robert Faust (Faust) appeals the revocation of his probation for failure to\r\n  make restitution payments, arguing the circuit court judge failed to make a\r\n  determination on the record that Faust's failure to pay was willful.Â  We vacate\r\n  and remand.Â  Â \r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nFaust\r\n  pled guilty to third-degree burglary in August 2003.[1]Â \r\n  The circuit court judge sentenced him under the Youthful Offender Act to a\r\n  sentence not to exceed five years, suspended with five years probation.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the circuit court judge ordered Faust to pay restitution in the amount of\r\n  $7,000, attend substance abuse counseling, comply with random alcohol and drug\r\n  testing, obtain a GED, and avoid contact with the victim.Â  Faust did not appeal\r\n  his guilty plea or sentence.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  July 2005, a probation arrest warrant was issued for Faust alleging he failed\r\n  to follow the advice and instructions of his probation agent, failed to\r\n  maintain monetary obligations, and was in arrears in restitution payments.Â  The\r\n  warrant stated, &quot;Such actions constitute willful violations of . . . the\r\n  original probationary agreement.&quot;Â  A South Carolina Department of\r\n  Probation, Parole and Pardon Services Violation Report (the Report) indicated\r\n  the probation agent recommended revocation of probation because Faust did not\r\n  comply with his financial obligations.Â  The Report further stated Faust's case\r\n  had previously been transferred to Pennsylvania but had been closed after Faust\r\n  changed his residence and his family would not disclose his current location.Â \r\n  The Report indicated Faust &quot;absconded supervision&quot; and was only\r\n  located in the community because of his involvement in a traffic stop.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the probation revocation hearing, Faust's counsel stated he was prepared\r\n  &quot;to address . . . the arrearage but as to [Faust's] . . . alleged reported\r\n  failures and absconding to Pennsylvania [he had] no defense because [he did not]\r\n  realize that was going to be an issue . . . .&quot;Â  Consequently, the circuit\r\n  court judge indicated he would only be ruling on Faust's failure to pay\r\n  restitution.Â  As to that issue, the circuit court judge found it was Faust's\r\n  &quot;fault&quot; he did not pay the restitution and, thus, revoked Faust's\r\n  probation in full.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to\r\n  revoke probation is addressed to the sound discretion of the circuit court\r\n  judge.Â  State v. Spare, 374 S.C. 264, 268, 647 S.E.2d 706, 708 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).Â  This Court, however, will review such a decision for errors of law or\r\n  for arbitrary and capricious decisions.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFaust argues the circuit\r\n  court judge erred in revoking probation solely for failure to pay restitution\r\n  without first determining on the record that the failure to pay was willful.Â \r\n  Before adjudicating this claim, we must first address whether this issue is\r\n  preserved for our review.Â Â  \r\nFor\r\n  an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and\r\n  ruled upon by the circuit court.Â  State v. Rogers, 361 S.C. 178, 183,\r\n  603 S.E.2d 910, 912 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  This rule is applicable to the issue of\r\n  whether the failure to pay was willful, and therefore, the failure to raise the\r\n  issue of willfulness at a probation revocation hearing waives the right to\r\n  appeal that issue to this Court.Â  State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, 648,\r\n  511 S.E.2d 94, 96-97 (Ct. App. 1999).Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt the probation\r\n  revocation hearing, Faust's counsel acknowledged Faust owed a substantial\r\n  amount of money on his restitution order but reminded the circuit court judge\r\n  Faust had already paid approximately $2,600 towards that court-ordered\r\n  obligation.Â  Faust's counsel also argued Faust &quot;had a job in Pennsylvania\r\n  with his uncle doing demolition work and was picked up [by the police] the day\r\n  before he was \r\nsuppose[] to start that job . . . .&quot;Â  Faust's counsel\r\n  further argued Faust was &quot;more than willing to continue to try to\r\n  pay&quot; should the judge allow him to continue with his probation and work in\r\n  Pennsylvania.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  response, the circuit court judge stated, &quot;[It is Faust's] fault that he\r\n  [did not] pay the restitution and [that is] the reason he got probation.Â  So\r\n  why has he not paid the restitution?&quot;Â  Faust's counsel replied there was\r\n  &quot;perhaps a communication mix up&quot; because Faust believed he had paid\r\n  what was owed and even had receipts.Â  Faust, however, could not produce these\r\n  receipts because they were in Pennsylvania.Â  The circuit court judge then stated,\r\n  &quot;I am revoking [probation] in full for failure to pay the restitution. . .\r\n  . I am tired of those excuses.&quot;Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Faust never expressly raised the issue of willfulness, we find the essence of\r\n  his defense at the revocation hearing was that his failure to continue payments\r\n  toward his restitution obligation was not willful because of a possible\r\n  miscommunication.Â  Furthermore, we find the circuit court judge implicitly\r\n  ruled upon this argument when he found Faust's failure to pay was Faust's\r\n  &quot;fault&quot; and Faust was just giving &quot;excuses.&quot;Â  Thus, we find\r\n  the issue is properly preserved for our review.Â  See id. at 648,\r\n  511 S.E.2d at 97 (finding the issue of willfulness at a revocation hearing was\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court because the essence of the\r\n  defendant's argument was &quot;that the violation was not willful because [the probationer]\r\n  believed his probationary period had terminated&quot; and the judge ruled\r\n  &quot;that the violation was 'intentional'&quot;); see also Pryor\r\n    v. Nw. Apartments, Ltd., 321 S.C. 524, 528 n.2, 469 S.E.2d 630, 633 n.2\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996) (finding an issue preserved when the circuit court implicitly\r\n  ruled on and rejected the respondent's argument).Â  \r\nFinding\r\n  appellate review of Faust's claim appropriate, we now address the merits of the\r\n  issue.Â  When deciding whether to revoke probation, the circuit court judge must\r\n  determine whether sufficient evidence has been presented by the State to\r\n  establish that the probationer violated the conditions of probation.Â  Spare,\r\n  374 S.C. at 268, 647 S.E.2d at 708.Â  While probation is a matter of grace and\r\n  revocation is the means by which to enforce its conditions, &quot;the authority\r\n  of the revoking court should always be predicated upon an evidentiary showing\r\n  of fact tending to establish a violation of the conditions.&quot;Â  Id. \r\nIn\r\n  South Carolina, a probationer's probation &quot;may not be revoked solely for failure to make required payments of fines or restitution without the circuit\r\n  [court] judge first determining on the record that the probationer has\r\n  failed to make a bona fide effort to pay.&quot;Â  Id. at 268-69, 647\r\n  S.E.2d at 708 (second emphasis added). Â The circuit court judge must make a\r\n  finding that the probationer willfully failed to pay the restitution in\r\n  addition to the findings of sufficient factual evidence of the violation.Â  Id. at 269, 647 S.E.2d at 708; see Barlet v. State, 288 S.C. 481,\r\n  483, 343 S.E.2d 620, 622 (1986) (&quot;The judge must determine on the record\r\n  that the probationer failed to make a bona fide effort to pay [fines or to make\r\n  restitution].&quot;).Â  &quot;In the absence of such a determination, a\r\n  defendant's due process rights are contravened by the deprivation of his\r\n  constitutional freedom.&quot;Â  Hamilton, 333 S.C. at 649, 511 S.E.2d at\r\n  97.Â Â Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court has held a &quot;[w]illful failure to pay means a voluntary, conscious\r\n  and intentional failure&quot; on the part of the probationer.Â  Spare,\r\n  374 S.C. at 269, 647 S.E.2d at 708-09.Â  &quot;A proper analysis should include\r\n  an inquiry into the reasons surrounding the probationer's failure to pay,\r\n  followed by a determination of whether the probationer made a willful choice\r\n  not to pay.&quot;Â  Id. at 269-70, 647 S.E.2d at 709.Â Â Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the present case, while we find the circuit court judge essentially\r\n  addressed the willfulness of Faust's failure to pay the restitution by finding\r\n  that failure was Faust's own &quot;fault,&quot; the circuit court judge erred\r\n  by failing to engage in an analysis on the record of the reasons surrounding\r\n  Faust's failure to pay and by failing to make explicit findings on the record\r\n  to support a conclusion that Faust's failure to pay was willful.Â  The record does\r\n  not demonstrate the circuit court judge engaged in a meaningful discussion\r\n  regarding Faust's ability to pay, his reasons for failing to pay, and whether\r\n  his failure to pay was willful, as has been required by this Court.Â  See id. at 270, 647 S.E.2d at 709 (&quot;[W]e believe the judge failed to\r\n  make the requisite inquiry into [the probationer's] ability to pay, his reasons\r\n  for failing to pay, and whether his failure to pay was willful.&quot;.Â  While we\r\n  understand the circuit court judge's frustration with Faust's failure to\r\n  continue making his restitution payments, we cannot hold the evidence provided\r\n  in the record supports the circuit court judge's finding of willfulness. Â \r\nThe\r\n  failure to make a finding on the record that Faust's failure to pay the\r\n  restitution was willful deprived Faust of his due process rights and\r\n  constitutes a reversible error by the circuit court judge.Â  Accordingly, the circuit\r\n  court judge committed reversible error in revoking Faust's probation, and we,\r\n  therefore, vacate the revocation of Faust's probation and remand this case for\r\n  a new probation revocation hearing. Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the circuit court judge's order is\r\nVACATED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Faust was nineteen years old at the time he entered\r\n  his guilty plea.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-158","title":"State v.

McDavid, 333 S.C. 490, 497,\r\n  511 S.E.2d 365, 368-69 (1999) (holding any matter not raised and ruled upon by\r\n  the family court cannot be considered by this court on appeal).Â Â Â Â  \r\n3.Â  As\r\n  to whether the family court erred in not eliminating alimony due to the Husbandâ€™s\r\n  substantial change of circumstances: Eubank v. Eubank, 347 S.C. 367,\r\n  372, 555 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct.
