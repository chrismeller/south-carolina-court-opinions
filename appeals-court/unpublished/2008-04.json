Scarborough, Master-In-Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-212\r\nSubmitted April 1, 2008 â€“ Filed April 4, 2008\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        George Hamlin Oâ€™Kelley, III, of Mt.

Middleton, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Nhin\r\n  Thi Tang and Tang Oriental Supermarket, Inc. (collectively Tang) appeal the\r\n  master-in-equityâ€™s order granting judgment for Ester and Joeprim Gustilo (the\r\n  Gustilos).Â  We affirm[1].Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 6, 2000, the Gustilos entered\r\n  into a contract to purchase Tang Oriental Supermarket (the Supermarket) from\r\n  Tang for $250,000.Â  The purchase and sale\r\n  agreement stated in paragraph 8.4 titled â€œAmendmentâ€ that â€œThis agreement may\r\n  be amended only by a written instrument executed by the party or parties to be\r\n  bound thereby.â€Â  Subsequently,\r\n  the Gustilos made a $40,000 down payment using Mrs. Gustiloâ€™s credit card.Â  The\r\n  Gustilos paid Tang $25,000 toward the purchase price in March of 2000.Â  The\r\n  Gustilos paid $15,000 more in April which was placed in an escrow account.Â  Mrs.\r\n  Gustilo testified she and her husband mortgaged two pieces of property valued\r\n  at $210,000 in total, one located in Berkeley County and one in Charleston County, to Tang as collateral.Â  The parties stipulated the Gustilos paid Tang\r\n  $83,046.95 pursuant to the April 2000 contract.\r\nRunning the Supermarket proved unsuccessful, and the Gustilos fell\r\n  behind in rent payments.Â  In January 2001, the Gustilos allegedly entered into\r\n  a new contract with Tang pursuant to which Tang would extinguish the Gustilosâ€™\r\n  outstanding mortgages if the Gustilos allowed Tang to repossess the Supermarket.Â \r\n  The Gustilos moved out of the Supermarket and returned the keys to Tang.Â  However,\r\n  Tang later refused to release the Gustilosâ€™ collateral, and the Gustilosâ€™\r\n  property in Berkeley County was foreclosed.Â  Tang negotiated with Tony Mallari\r\n  (Mallari) to purchase the store, and once she repossessed the Supermarket, Tang\r\n  planned to immediately sell it to Mallari.Â  However, the sale to Mallari fell\r\n  through.Â  The Gustilos testified they never knew about the potential buyer Tang\r\n  lined up until they returned possession of the Supermarket to her.\r\nThe\r\n  Gustilos brought suit against Tang for breach of contract, breach of contract\r\n  accompanied by a fraudulent act, fraud and deceit, slander of title,\r\n  conversion, and equitable satisfaction of mortgage.Â  Tang answered and\r\n  counterclaimed alleging breach of contract and mortgage foreclosure.Â  After\r\n  dismissing most causes of action, the trial court found specific performance\r\n  was due under an oral agreement because the Gustilos completely performed their\r\n  part of the bargain and voluntarily turned possession of the Supermarket over\r\n  to Tang.Â  The trial court further found Tangâ€™s inability to resell the premises\r\n  to Mallari did not alter the terms of the new contract with the Gustilos.Â  Based\r\n  on these conclusions, the trial court determined the Gustilos were entitled to\r\n  an order directing the Register Mesne Conveyance (RMC) Office for the County of Charleston to mark as paid in full and satisfied the mortgage on the Charleston County property which the Gustilos still owned.Â  The trial court found in favor\r\n  of the Gustilos for their breach of contract and equitable satisfaction of\r\n  their mortgage.Â  However, the trial court found they failed to establish any\r\n  monetary damage as a result of the breach.Â  The trial court denied Tangâ€™s claims\r\n  for breach of contract and foreclosure of mortgage.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for specific performance is one in equity.Â  Campbell v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 262, 603 S.E.2d 625, 627 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Our\r\n  scope of review of a case heard by a master who enters a final judgment is to\r\n  determine facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence. Â See Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237,\r\n  391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989).Â  Thus, the appellate court may reverse a factual\r\n  finding by the trial judge in such cases when the appellant persuades the\r\n  appellate court that the trial judgeâ€™s finding is against the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.Â  Campbell, 361 S.C. at 263, 603 S.E.2d at 627.Â  Pursuant\r\n  to Rule 220(b), SCACR, when an appellate court chooses to find facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the evidence, the court must state distinctly\r\n  its findings of fact and the reason for its decision.Â  Dearybury v.\r\n    Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Error in Granting Directed\r\n  Verdict\r\n\r\n  A.Â \r\n    Partial performance of an oral agreement \r\n\r\nTang\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting the Gustilosâ€™ motion for directed\r\n  verdict based on the Statute of Frauds because the Gustilos failed to meet\r\n  their burden of introducing clear and convincing evidence the oral agreement\r\n  had been partly performed.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nIt\r\n  is unclear whether this issue was actually raised at the trial level because\r\n  the record Tang provided on appeal does not include portions of the trial\r\n  transcript where Tang allegedly moved for a directed verdict.Â  Ordinarily, no\r\n  point will be considered which does not appear in the record on appeal.Â  See Rule 210(h), SCACR.Â  Further, the appellant has the burden of presenting a\r\n  sufficient record to allow review.Â  See, e.g., Helms Realty, Inc. v.\r\n    Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 339-40, 611 S.E.2d 485, 487-88 (2005); Bridwell\r\n      v. Bridwell, 279 S.C. 111, 113, 302 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1983); State v.\r\n        Carlson, 363 S.C. 586, 608, 611 S.E.2d 283, 294 (Ct. App. 2005); Hundley\r\n          ex rel. Hundley v. Rite Aid of S.C., Inc., 339 S.C. 285, 306-07, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  45, 57 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Therefore, due to the inadequacy of the record\r\n  presented, whether the trial court erred in deciding Tangâ€™s directed verdict\r\n  motion is not preserved for our review.Â  However,\r\n  even if we were to reach the merits, this issue is unavailing to Tang.\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing a trial courtâ€™s ruling on a directed verdict, this court will reverse\r\n  the ruling only when no evidence supports the ruling or the ruling is\r\n  controlled by an error of law.Â  Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 569,\r\n  633 S.E.2d 505, 512 (2006); McMillan v. Oconee Memâ€™l Hosp., Inc., 367\r\n  S.C. 559, 564, 626 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2006).Â  On review, the appellate court must\r\n  determine whether a verdict for the party opposing the motion would be\r\n  reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his or her\r\n  favor.Â  Ericson v. Jones St. Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 463, 629\r\n  S.E.2d 653, 663 (2006).Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the Statute of Frauds, certain contracts must be reduced to writing in order to\r\n  be enforced.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10 (2007). Â In pertinent part,\r\n  section 32-3-10 (4) (2007) bars actions which:\r\n\r\n  [C]harge\r\n    any person upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments or\r\n    any interest in or concerning them . . . . Unless the agreement upon which such\r\n    action shall be brought or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing\r\n    and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some person thereunto by him\r\n    lawfully authorized.\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\n  South Carolina courts recognize several exceptions to the Statute of Frauds\r\n  writing requirement, including partial or complete performance. See, e.g., Stackhouse v. Cook, 271 S.C. 518, 521, 248 S.E.2d 482, 483 (1978); Scurry\r\n    v. Edwards, 232 S.C. 53, 60-61, 100 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1957); Settlemeyer\r\n      v. McCluney, 359 S.C. 317, 320, 596 S.E.2d 514, 516 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Where\r\n  sufficient partial performance has occurred, courts of equity can enforce\r\n  specific performance of an oral agreement for a land sale purchase, despite the\r\n  Statute of Frauds. Â Scurry, 232 S.C. at 60-61, 100 S.E.2d at 816; Gibson\r\n    v. Hrysikos, 293 S.C. 8, 13, 358 S.E.2d 173, 175-76 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  To do\r\n  so, â€œa court of equity must find: 1) clear evidence of an oral agreement; 2)\r\n  the agreement had been partially executed; and 3) the party who requested\r\n  performance had completed or was willing to complete his part of the oral\r\n  agreement.â€ Â Settlemeyer, 359 S.C. 317, 320, 596 S.E.2d 514, 516 (citing Gibson, 293 S.C. at 13-14, 358 S.E.2d at 176).\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the trial court found the Gustilos credible in their\r\n  testimony regarding the new contract which was entered into and consummated in early\r\n  January 2001.Â  Specifically, the Gustilos testified Tang offered to satisfy\r\n  their outstanding mortgages if the Gustilos would allow her to repossess the Supermarket.Â \r\n  The trial court stated, â€œThe Gustilos testimony is quite clear on this point.Â \r\n  I conclude there is sufficient evidence by virtue of the somewhat ceremonious\r\n  way in which the Gustilos returned the key to Mrs. Tang in January of 2001.â€Â \r\n  Therefore, based on the Gustilosâ€™ testimony and actions, we find clear and\r\n  convincing evidence proves a new contract existed between the parties, thereby\r\n  satisfying the first prong of Settlemeyer.Â  359 S.C. at 320, 596 S.E.2d at\r\n  516.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the Gustilos relinquished management and ownership of the Supermarket by\r\n  returning the keys to Tang.Â  Such action amounts to partial execution of the\r\n  new agreement between Tang and the Gustilos, thereby satisfying the second\r\n  prong of Settlemeyer.Â  Id. Â Finally, the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence indicates Tang, as the party who requested performance, was willing to\r\n  comply with her obligations under the new agreement when she initially\r\n  negotiated with the Gustilos to regain ownership of the Supermarket. Â Though\r\n  negotiations with Mallari ultimately fell through, Tang initially was willing\r\n  to satisfy the outstanding mortgages on the Gustilosâ€™ two properties.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the Gustilos had no knowledge of Tangâ€™s negotiations with Mallari.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we find Tangâ€™s inclination enough to satisfy the third prong under Settlemeyer.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  affirm the trial courtâ€™s order finding sufficient partial performance occurred\r\n  between the parties because the Gustilos established the elements of Settlemeyer.Â \r\n  Based on the finding of partial performance, the trial court could enforce\r\n  specific performance of the oral agreement for the resale of the Supermarket,\r\n  despite the Statute of Frauds.Â  \r\n\r\n  B.Â \r\n    Parol Evidence Rule\r\n\r\nTang\r\n  contends the trial court erred in finding the parties amended their purchase\r\n  and sale agreement by a subsequent oral agreement after admitting parol evidence.Â \r\n  Specifically, Tang argues the parol evidence rule bars any testimony contradicting\r\n  the express, unambiguous terms of the written agreements between the parties.Â \r\n  We disagree.[2]Â  \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  parol evidence rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic evidence of agreements\r\n  or understandings contemporaneous with or prior to execution of a written\r\n  instrument when the extrinsic evidence is to be used to contradict, vary, or\r\n  explain the written instrument.â€ Â Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354\r\n  S.C. 459, 471, 581 S.E.2d 496, 502-03 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Estate of\r\n    Holden v. Holden, 343 S.C. 267, 539 S.E.2d 703 (2000) and Crafton v.\r\n      Brown, 346 S.C. 347, 550 S.E.2d 904 (Ct. App. 2001)).Â  However, â€œ[it] is\r\n  axiomatic that there exists a well established exception to the parol evidence\r\n  rule which allows extrinsic evidence by the party attacking an instrument on\r\n  the ground of fraud.â€ Â Redwend, 354 S.C. at 471, 581 S.E.2d at 503\r\n  (citing Bradley v. Hullander, 272 S.C. 6, 249 S.E.2d 486 (1978) and Allen-Parker\r\n    Co. v. Lollis, 257 S.C. 266, 185 S.E.2d 739 (1971)).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the trial court granted Tang a directed verdict on the\r\n  Gustilosâ€™ claims for fraud and deceit and for breach of contract accompanied by\r\n  fraudulent act.Â  Therefore, based on the trial court finding no fraud occurred\r\n  between the parties, Tang contends certain parol evidence is inadmissible.Â  However,\r\n  because the trial court found the parties entered into a new oral agreement,\r\n  the trial court allowed parol evidence. See, e.g., Smith v. McClam,\r\n  289 S.C. 452, 457, 346 S.E.2d 720, 724 (1986) (citing Midland Timber Co. v.\r\n    Furman, 111 S.C. 287, 97 S.E. 831 (1919) and Williston On Contracts, 3rd\r\n      Ed., Â§ 636) (â€œA well recognized exception is that parol evidence may be\r\n  admitted to show a separate and independent agreement, which is not\r\n  inconsistent with the terms of a contemporaneous or subsequent written\r\n  agreement, if it can be inferred that the parties did not intend the written\r\n  paper to be a complete integration of the agreement.â€); Natâ€™l Loan &amp;\r\n    Exch. Bank v. Tolbert, 129 S.C. 503, 512, 124 S.E. 772, 775 (1924) (internal\r\n  citation omitted) (â€œ[T]he parol evidence does not in any way deny that the\r\n  original agreement of the parties was that which the writing purports to\r\n  express, but merely goes to show that the parties have exercised their right to\r\n  change or abrogate the same, or to make a new and independent contract . . . . All\r\n  distinct and separate transactions may therefore be established and availed of\r\n  whenever they are themselves valid. Now, a transaction subsequent in time must\r\n  always be a separate transaction.â€).Â  Based on the trial courtâ€™s finding Tang\r\n  and the Gustilos entered into a new contract, admission of parol evidence was\r\n  not in error.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to admit such\r\n  testimony though it may contradict express terms of a prior written agreement\r\n  between the parties.Â Â  \r\n\r\n  C.Â \r\n    Part performance as an affirmative defense\r\n\r\nNext, Tang argues\r\n  the Gustilos should have been precluded from arguing part performance as an\r\n  affirmative defense to her claims against them.Â  We disagree.Â  Â  \r\nSouth Carolina case\r\n  law requires parties to clearly and definitely plead certain affirmative\r\n  defenses, including part performance.Â  See Rule 8(c), SCRCP, (â€œIn\r\n  pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively the\r\n  defenses: . . . statute of frauds, . . . waiver, and any other matter\r\n  constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.â€); Hill v. Watford, 276\r\n  S.C. 344, 345, 278 S.E.2d 347, 348 (1981) (â€œ[P]art\r\n  performance was clearly and definitely pled, as our case law requires.â€); McMillan\r\n    v. King, 193 S.C. 14, 23, 7 S.E.2d 521, 526 (1940) (â€œ[T]he claim of part\r\n  performance thereof, should each be alleged at least with definiteness and\r\n  clarity when the sufficiency of the complaint is tested by demurrer.â€).Â \r\n  However, our rules of civil procedure also require this court to construe all\r\n  pleadings so as â€œto do substantial justice to all parties.â€Â  Rule 8(f), SCRCP; see also Loftis v. Eck, 288 S.C. 154, 156, 341 S.E.2d 641, 642 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986) (â€œ[P]leadings in both law and equity should be liberally construed to do\r\n  substantial justice.â€). \r\nIn their complaint,\r\n  the Gustilos allege the parties agreed Tang would take the Supermarket back and\r\n  release the security and collateral the Gustilos pledged at the time they\r\n  purchased the store.Â  The Gustilos further allege they allowed Tang, in\r\n  reliance on the agreement and in the course of dealings between the parties, to\r\n  retake possession of the Supermarket.Â  After honoring their duties under the\r\n  new agreement, the Gustilos argue Tang refused to honor her responsibility\r\n  under the agreement to release the Gustilosâ€™ realÂ  property and collateral.Â  In\r\n  her answer to the Gustilosâ€™ complaint, Tang counterclaimed, alleging breach of\r\n  contract and mortgage foreclosure.Â  In defense of these counterclaims, the\r\n  Gustilos replied and realleged the facts set forth in their complaint.\r\nBased on the above\r\n  cited South Carolina jurisprudence, we liberally construe the Gustilosâ€™\r\n  allegations and find they sufficiently pled part performance.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  Gustilosâ€™ allegation stating: Â â€œThereafter, the [Gustilos] allowed Tang, in\r\n  reliance on the agreement and course of dealing between the parites, to retake\r\n  possession of the store,â€ is enough to amount to affirmatively raising part\r\n  performance as a defense.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in\r\n  allowing the Gustilos to raise this issue at trial over Tangâ€™s objection.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;Failure to Establish\r\n  Monetary Damages\r\nIn\r\n  her next assertion to our court, Tang argues the trial court erred in granting\r\n  the Gustilos a judgment because they failed to establish any monetary damage as\r\n  a result of the alleged breach of contract.Â  This issue is not preserved for\r\n  our review.Â  \r\nTang\r\n  failed to make a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, alerting the trial court\r\n  to this issue.Â  Therefore, this issue was not raised to or ruled upon by the\r\n  trial court.Â  If Tang did make a Rule\r\n  59(e) motion to the trial court, it does not appear in the record on appeal,\r\n  and this argument still fails because Tang, as appellant, has the burden of\r\n  producing a complete record.Â  See, e.g., Helms Realty, 363 S.C. at\r\n  339-40, 611 S.E.2d at 487-88; Bridwell, 279 S.C. at 113, 302 S.E.2d at\r\n  858 (1983); Carlson, 363 S.C. at 608, 611 S.E.2d at 294; Hundley,\r\n  339 S.C. at 306-07, 529 S.E.2d at 57.\r\nâ€œAn\r\n  issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an\r\n  issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€Â  In\r\n    re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004).Â  â€œIt is well\r\n  settled that, but for a very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate court\r\n  cannot address an issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court.â€Â  Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598\r\n  S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004).\r\nThe\r\n  purpose of a Rule 59(e) motion is to request for the trial judge to reconsider\r\n  matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits.Â  Collins Music\r\n    Co., Inc. v. IGT, 353 S.C. 559, 562, 579 S.E.2d 524, 525 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Regarding\r\n  Rule 59(e) motions, the South Carolina Supreme Court stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  A party may wish to file such a motion when she believes the court has\r\n    misunderstood, failed to fully consider, or perhaps failed to rule on an\r\n    argument or issue, and the party wishes for the court to reconsider or rule on\r\n    it. A party must file such a motion when an issue or argument has been\r\n    raised, but not ruled on, in order to preserve it for appellate review. . . . South Carolina appellate courts do not recognize the â€œplain error rule,â€ under which a court\r\n    in certain circumstances is allowed to consider and rectify an error not raised\r\n    below by the party.Â Â  \r\n\r\nElam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (internal\r\n  citations omitted).\r\nRecently,\r\n  in Pye v. Estate of Fox, the South Carolina Supreme Court identified two\r\n  ways to preserve an issue for appeal as either: â€œa ruling by the trial [court]\r\n  or a post-trial motion.â€Â  369 S.C. 555, 566, 633 S.E.2d 505, 511 (2006).Â  The Pye court held an issue was preserved for review when Pye raised such issue to the\r\n  trial court in a summary judgment motion and later in a Rule 59(e) motion.Â  369\r\n  S.C. at 565, 633 S.E.2d at 510.Â  Though the trial court never ruled on the\r\n  issue the motions raised, the Pye court found the issue was preserved by\r\n  stating, â€œ[A]n exception to this rule exists where an issue is raised but not ruled upon at a Rule 59(e) hearing.â€Â  Id.Â  In its holding\r\n  the court noted lawyers cannot force trial courts to address an issue, but â€œa\r\n  properly requested ruling under Rule 59 is sufficient without a specific\r\n  judicial decision on the matter.â€Â  Id. at 566, 633 S.E.2d at 511.Â  Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  the case sub judice, Tang protests the trial courtâ€™s order\r\n  granting a judgment to the Gustilos.Â  However, in order to properly preserve\r\n  such an issue for appeal, Tang must raise the issue to the trial court through a\r\n  Rule 59(e) motion, giving the court an opportunity to address problematic\r\n  rulings and issue a final ruling.Â  See Pye, 369 S.C. at 565, 633\r\n  S.E.2d at 510; Elam, 361 S.C. at 24, 602 S.E.2d at 780; Collins, 353\r\n  S.C. at 562, 579 S.E.2d at 525.Â  Instead, Tang directly appealed the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s order granting judgment for the Gustilos.Â  We find this issue is not\r\n  preserved for our review because Tang never raised it at the trial level.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  issue fails on the merits as well.Â  To recover for a breach of contract, the\r\n  plaintiff must prove:Â  (1) a binding contract entered into by the parties; (2)\r\n  a breach or unjustifiable failure to perform the contract; and (3) damage\r\n  suffered by the plaintiff as a direct and proximate result of the breach. See Fuller v. Eastern Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 240 S.C. 75, 89, 124 S.E.2d\r\n  602, 610 (1962) (â€œThis being an action for the breach of contract, the burden\r\n  was upon the respondent to prove the contract, its breach, and the damages\r\n  caused by such breach.).Â  In a breach of contract action, the measure of\r\n  damages is the loss actually suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the\r\n  breach.Â  Collins Holding Corp. v. Landrum, 360 S.C. 346, 350, 601 S.E.2d\r\n  332, 333 (2004); Minter v. GOCT, Inc., 322 S.C. 525, 528, 473 S.E.2d 67,\r\n  70 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œThe purpose of an award of damages for breach of contract\r\n  is to put the plaintiff in as good a position as he would have been in if the\r\n  contract had been performed.â€Â  Minter, 322 S.C. at 528, 473 S.E.2d at 70.\r\nTang\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting the Gustilos a judgment because they\r\n  failed to establish monetary damages.Â  The trial court made such a\r\n  finding and in its order by stating, â€œIt is further ordered that the Plaintiff\r\n  has failed to establish any monetary damage as a result of contract.â€Â  However,\r\n  we find the Gustilos incurred damages, though not completely monetary in\r\n  nature, as result of Tangâ€™s breach.Â  Specifically, the Gustilos incurred\r\n  damages in the form of previous mortgage debt and damaged credit.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  in finding for the Gustilos on their breach of contract cause of action, the\r\n  trial court ordered the â€œRegister Mesne Conveyance for the County of Charleston . . . to mark the mortgage of Joeprim G. Gustilo and Ester M Gustilo to\r\n  Tang Oriental Supermarket . . . paid in full and satisfied.â€\r\nTherefore,\r\n  we find the trial court properly found the Gustilos met their burden of proof\r\n  by establishing damage suffered as a direct and proximate result of the breach.Â \r\n  Furthermore, we find South Carolina jurisprudence does not restrict damages\r\n  solely to out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the breach.Â  Though contract\r\n  damages ordinary consist of out of pocket expenses incurred by the breach and\r\n  the gain above costs that would have been realized had the breach not occurred,\r\n  we believe damages can exist in several forms, including debt or damaged\r\n  credit.Â  But cf. S.C. Fed. Sav. Bank v. Thornton-Crosby\r\n    Dev. Co., Inc., 303 S.C. 74, 77, 399 S.E.2d 8, 11 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œIn the normal case, the damage will consist of two distinct elements: (1) out-of-pocket costs\r\n  actually incurred as a result of the contract; and (2) the gain above costs\r\n  that would have been realized had the contract been performed.â€) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the ruling of the trial court.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp;Error in Evidence Admission\r\nTang\r\n  argues the trial court erred in admitting evidence of alleged\r\n  misrepresentations by Tang based on the merger clause in the agreement between\r\n  the parties.Â  We find Tang abandoned this issue on appeal.[3]Â  \r\nAn\r\n  issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the argument\r\n  is raised in a brief but not supported by authority.Â  In re Care and\r\n    Treatment of McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 93, 551 S.E.2d 235, 239 (2001).Â  In her\r\n  Appellantâ€™s Brief, Tang failed to cite any authority in support of her\r\n  assertion the trial court erred in admitting certain misrepresentations into\r\n  evidence.Â  Therefore, we find Tang abandoned this issue on appeal, and we\r\n  decline to consider the argument.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  the merits, this issue fails as well.Â  The merger clause in Tangâ€™s agreement\r\n  with Gustilos expressed there were no â€œrepresentations made by either party\r\n  relative to the subject matter hereof, which are not expressly set forth\r\n  herein.â€Â  Tang contends the trial court erred in allowing Mrs. Gustilo to\r\n  testify regarding Tangâ€™s representations of the Supermarketâ€™s monthly gross\r\n  revenue, which is contrary to the express terms of their agreement.\r\nAdmission\r\n  of evidence is largely within the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l\r\n    Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 510 (2005); Gamble\r\n      v. Intâ€™l Paper Realty Corp. of S.C., 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441\r\n  (1996); Hofer v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. 503, 513, 381 S.E.2d 736, 742\r\n  (1989); Seabrook Island Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v. Berger, 365 S.C. 234, 242,\r\n  616 S.E.2d 431, 435 (Ct. App. 2005); R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry\r\n    Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 439, 540 S.E.2d 113, 121 (Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\n  Therefore, under our scope of review, we must determine whether the trial court\r\n  abused its discretion.Â  Elledge v. Richland/Lexington Sch. Dist. Five,\r\n  352 S.C. 179, 185, 573 S.E.2d 789, 792 (2002); R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v.\r\n    Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. at 439, 540 S.E.2d at 121.Â  The trial\r\n  courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is based on an error\r\n  of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support. Whaley v. CSX\r\n    Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 456, 483, 609 S.E.2d 286, 300 (2005); Fields,\r\n  363 S.C. at 25-26, 609 S.E.2d at 509.Â  â€œFor this Court to reverse a case based\r\n  on the admission of evidence, both error and prejudice must be shown.â€ Seabrook Island Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n, 365 S.C. at 242, 616 S.E.2d at\r\n  435; Stevens v. Allen, 336 S.C. 439, 448, 520 S.E.2d 625, 629 (Ct. App. 1999)\r\n  (citing Timmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. 378, 175 S.E.2d\r\n  805 (1970)).\r\nAssuming\r\n  without deciding the trial courtâ€™s admission of the evidence was error, we\r\n  affirm nevertheless because there was no resulting prejudice to Tang.Â  See Starkey v. Bell, 281 S.C. 308, 315-16, 315 S.E.2d 153, 157 (Ct. App.\r\n  1984) (â€œThe admission of evidence is discretionary with the trial judge whose\r\n  ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of an abuse thereof amounting to an\r\n  error of law, and prejudice.â€).Â  In the case sub judice, the trial court\r\n  found the Gustilos, as plaintiffs, successfully met their burden and proved\r\n  Tang breached their second contract.Â  Based on its decision to grant judgment\r\n  in favor of the Gustilos, the trial court ordered the RMC to extinguish certain\r\n  mortgages.Â  The trial court did not use the gross income figure in its\r\n  calculation of damages, as there were no monetary damages established.Â  Rather,\r\n  Mrs. Gustiloâ€™s brief testimony recalled preliminary negotiations leading up to\r\n  the first contract entered into by the parties.Â  Therefore, we affirm the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s decision to allow such testimony into evidence because we fail to see\r\n  how such testimony prejudiced Tang.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp;Equitable Satisfaction of\r\n  the Mortgage\r\nFinally,\r\n  Tang argues the Gustilos were not entitled to equitable satisfaction of their\r\n  mortgages because she did not sell the business to Mallari.Â  We find this issue\r\n  was abandoned on appeal. \r\nAn\r\n  issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the argument\r\n  is raised in a brief but not supported by authority.Â  In re Care and\r\n    Treatment of McCracken, 346 S.C. at 93, 551 S.E.2d at 239.Â  Tang failed to\r\n  cite any authority in support of her assertion that the Gustilos were not\r\n  entitled to equitable satisfaction of their mortgages.Â  Therefore, we find Tang\r\n  abandoned this issue on appeal, and we decline to consider the argument.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Though Tang fails to cite to her objection, Tangâ€™s\r\n  objection and the courtâ€™s ruling regarding Mrs. Gustilosâ€™ testimony under the\r\n  parol evidence rule appear on pages 69-72 and page 109 in the record on appeal.Â  \r\n[3] Tangâ€™s objection to this testimony appears on page 58\r\n  of the record on appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-213","title":"State v.

We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 27, 2002,\r\n  Wife brought an action for divorce and equitable distribution from Husband on\r\n  the basis of adultery, after twenty-seven years of marriage.Â  Husband retained\r\n  counsel, and on November 15, 2002, filed an answer and counter-claim,\r\n  requesting an equitable distribution of the marital assets.\r\nAt a pretrial\r\n  hearing held August 30, 2005, the parties were instructed to enter into\r\n  mediation prior to trial and trial date was set for January 5, 2006.Â  While\r\n  Husbandâ€™s counsel attended the pretrial hearing, Husband was not present.Â  On\r\n  December 12, 2005, Husbandâ€™s counsel filed an ex-parte motion and order to be\r\n  relieved as Husbandâ€™s counsel.Â  Mediation took place December 29, 2005, seventeen\r\n  days after Husbandâ€™s counselâ€™s motion to be relieved as counsel was granted.Â  Nevertheless,\r\n  the parties reached an agreement during mediation.Â  This agreement was reduced\r\n  to writing by the mediator in a letter, but not signed by either party.Â \r\n  Husband and Wife anticipated this letter would be published and approved by the\r\n  family court at the final hearing.\r\nHusband failed to\r\n  appear at the final hearing, and did not request a continuance.Â  Wife informed\r\n  the family court an agreement was reached at mediation, but did not inform the\r\n  court the agreement was memorialized in a letter by the mediator.Â  Instead, the\r\n  Wife went forward with the trial in Husbandâ€™s absence.\r\nHusband was served\r\n  by mail the final order and decree of divorce, and subsequently filed a notice\r\n  of motion and motion pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, to vacate the final order and\r\n  decree.Â  A hearing on Husbandâ€™s motion was held June 12, 2006, and the record\r\n  was left open to receive an affidavit from Husbandâ€™s original counsel.Â  On July\r\n  28, 2006, the family court granted Husbandâ€™s motion to vacate and reopen the\r\n  case, stating:\r\n\r\n\tAfter\r\n  reviewing the file, the affidavits submitted and hearing argument of counsel,\r\n  this court issues the following order:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.\r\n\t\t\tThis court grants [Husbandâ€™s] motion to vacate the \r\n\t\t\tfinal order and reopen the case.&nbsp; The court does this because \r\n\t\t\talthough the court was informed at the January 5, 2006 [sic] final \r\n\t\t\thearing that the parties may have reached a mediated agreement, it \r\n\t\t\twas not revealed that there was a December 29, 2005 [sic] letter \r\n\t\t\tfrom the mediator, Kathleen Moraska Ferri memorializing the terms of the Agreement.Â  Had the court\r\n  been informed of this, it would have briefly stayed the proceedings in an\r\n  attempt to locate [Husband] and determine if the mediated agreement was in fact\r\n  the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â  It was further represented to the Court by [Wifeâ€™s]\r\n  counsel that she in fact hoped that the mediated agreement would be placed on\r\n  the record that day.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tIf the parties are willing to have the mediated \r\n\t\t\tagreement become the final order of the court, they may set a \r\n\t\t\thearing to have that agreement approved.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.\r\n\t\t\tIf either party is unwilling to have the mediated \r\n\t\t\tagreement become the final order of the court, this matter shall be \r\n\t\t\tset for an expedited pre-trial to set this matter for trial.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWife\r\n  filed a motion to reconsider the order to reopen and to allow the final order\r\n  and decree of divorce to remain in full force and effect, alleging there was no\r\n  legal basis for granting a new trial.Â  The family court denied Wifeâ€™s motion to\r\n  reconsider. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWife\r\n  contends the family court erred by denying her motion to reconsider its grant\r\n  of Husbandâ€™s motion to vacate the final order and reopen the case.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nâ€œWe\r\n  will reverse the family courtâ€™s granting of a new trial only where the grant\r\n  constituted an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.â€Â  Blejski\r\n    v.

App. 2003)).\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the judge granted a new trial when she learned the partiesâ€™\r\n  mediated agreement was reduced to writing by the mediator but not presented to\r\n  the court at trial by Wifeâ€™s counsel in Husbandâ€™s absence.Â  The judge reasoned\r\n  she would have briefly stayed the proceedings to contact Husband to gain his\r\n  consent.Â  Given the judgeâ€™s delayed knowledge of the written mediation\r\n  agreement, it was within the courtâ€™s discretion to grant a new trial.Â  We find\r\n  no abuse of discretion in this situation.Â  Because the court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in granting a new trial, we elect not to address Husbandâ€™s arguments\r\n  to ignore Wifeâ€™s July 28, 2006, and October 13, 2006, affidavits and his\r\n  alleged lack of notice.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we\r\nAFFIRM.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-222","title":"State v.

Scarborough, Master-in-Equity\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-224\r\nSubmitted April 1, 2008 â€“ Filed April 11,\r\n  2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn J. Dodds, III, of Mt. Pleasant; for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tRobert A. Kerr, and Brendan P.\r\n  Langendorfer, \r\n\t\t\t\tof Mt. Pleasant; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Yvonne\r\n  Capers appeals the Master-in-Equityâ€™s refusal\r\nto grant her a\r\n  new trial or relief from judgment relating to a service of process by\r\n  publication, ensuing default judgment, and sale of heirs property.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAt the center of this action are three parcels of unimproved\r\n  property (Property) located along Highway 17 North in Charleston County. Â Ernest Capers owned an undivided one-sixth interest in the Property. Â Ernest Capers\r\n  died November 19, 1998. Â Appellant Yvonne Capers (Capers) is Ernest Capersâ€™\r\n  widow and sole heir. Â Â Â \r\nOn November 5, 2002, Respondent Helen Roberson (Roberson) filed an\r\n  action seeking a judicial declaration that she was the fee simple title owner\r\n  of the Property. Â Robersonâ€™s counsel at that time, Russell Brown (Brown), filed\r\n  a Motion for Service by Publication supported by an Affidavit of Publication.Â \r\n  In the supporting affidavit, Brown swore neither he nor Roberson knew the\r\n  address or residence of the Defendants, including the widow of Ernest Capers. Â The\r\n  affidavit also stated the Defendantsâ€™ â€œplace of residenceâ€¦ cannot with\r\n  reasonable diligence be ascertainedâ€ by Brown or Roberson. Â The affidavit\r\n  further stated the nature of the declaratory action sought and the Defendants,\r\n  including the widow of Ernest Capers, were proper and necessary parties to the\r\n  action. Â The Clerk of Court for Charleston County granted an Order of\r\n  Publication on November 5, 2002. Â A notice which included Yvonne Capersâ€™ name\r\n  along with the names of other Defendants was printed in the Moultrie News three\r\n  times during November 2002. Â \r\nOn December 9, 2003, the circuit court found Capers had been\r\n  properly served, failed to respond, and was therefore in default. Â The circuit\r\n  court referred the action to the Master-in-Equity (Master). Â A hearing was held\r\n  before the Master on August 30, 2004. Â Thereafter the Master issued a Judgment\r\n  of Sale and Distribution clearing title to the Property and ordering the\r\n  Property be sold. Â Capers did not know of the hearing and did not appear;\r\n  however, a fellow Defendant, Arthur Milligan, Jr., was present and represented\r\n  by counsel. Â Milligan submitted evidence regarding the fair market value of the\r\n  Property. Â Â Â \r\nOn January 9, 2006, Roberson purchased the Property. Â Near\r\n  the end of September 2006, Robersonâ€™s attorney, Louis Moore (Moore), called\r\n  Capersâ€™ residence. Â On\r\n  September 28, 2006, Moore delivered a check for $34,037.73, representing Capersâ€™ share of the Propertyâ€™s net sale\r\n  proceeds, to Capersâ€™ attorney. Â Six days later Capersâ€™ attorney returned the\r\n  check to Moore and filed a motion pursuant to Rules 59 and 60, SCRCP, for new\r\n  trial or relief from judgment on the ground Capers had never been lawfully\r\n  served. Â The Master heard Capersâ€™ motion on November 21, 2006, and subsequently\r\n  denied the motion. The Master also denied Capersâ€™ Rule 59(e) Motion to Alter or\r\n  Amend Judgment. Â Capers appealed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe grant or denial of new trial motions and motions under Rule 60(b) lie within the sound discretion of the judge. Stevens v. Allen, 336 S.C.\r\n  439, 446, 520 S.E.2d 625, 628-29 (Ct. App. 1999); Raby Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 17-18, 594 S.E.2d 478,\r\n  482&nbsp;(2004).Â  Our standard of review, therefore,\r\n  is limited to determining whether there was an abuse of discretion.Â  Raby\r\n    Constr., L.L.P., 358 S.C. at 18, 594 S.E.2d at 482.Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when there is an error of\r\n  law or a factual conclusion which is without evidentiary support.â€ Gooding\r\n    v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCapers\r\n  appeals the Masterâ€™s refusal to grant her motion for a new trial or relief from\r\n  judgment.Â  In her affidavit to the Master, Capers stated she and her late\r\n  husband had resided in the same residence in Awendaw for the last thirty years.\r\n  Â During that time, her telephone number and listing in the telephone directory\r\n  under William E. Capers has not changed. Â Capers contends she was never served\r\n  or properly notified of the reference hearing or sale of the Property.\r\nAn order for service by publication may be issued pursuant to Section 15-9-710 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 1999) when an affidavit, satisfactory\r\n  to the issuing officer, is made stating that the defendant, a resident of the\r\n  state, cannot, after the exercise of due diligence, be found, and that a cause\r\n  of action exists against him. S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-710(3) (Supp. 1999).Â  \r\nâ€œGenerally,\r\n  absent fraud or collusion, once the issuing officer is satisfied with the\r\n  supporting affidavit, the decision to order service by publication is final\r\n  unless the order of publication is premised upon a facially defective\r\n  affidavit.â€ Brown v. Malloy, 345 S.C. 113, 118, 546 S.E.2d 195, 197 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Wachovia Bank of S.C. v. Player, 334 S.C. 200, 204, 512\r\n  S.E.2d 129, 131 (Ct. App. 1999), revâ€™d on other grounds, 341 S.C. 424, 535\r\n  S.E.2d 128 (2000); Yarbrough v. Collins, 293 S.C. 290, 292-93, 360\r\n  S.E.2d 300, 301 (1987) (holding the Court of Appeals erroneously added the\r\n  requirement that an affidavit for publication must set forth facts showing due\r\n  diligence had been exercised and the court should not consider the sufficiency\r\n  of the affidavit when there was no allegation the affidavit was obtained by\r\n  fraud or collusion); Montgomery v. Mullins, 325 S.C. 500, 506, 480\r\n  S.E.2d 467, 470 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œthe trial court was without authority to\r\n  overrule the finding of the clerk of court that the Mullinses could not, â€˜after\r\n  due diligence, be found in the County and State of their last known\r\n  residenceâ€™â€); Miles v. Lee, 319 S.C. 271, 274, 460 S.E.2d 423, 425 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1995) (holding the affidavit for publication was facially defective when\r\n  it named Kenneth Wayne Lee as the defendant and person to be served although\r\n  Robert Lewis Miles, Sr. was the actual defendant in the adoption/termination of\r\n  parental rights proceeding)).\r\nCapers\r\n  argues the Affidavit of Publication is facially defective because her name does\r\n  not appear in the affidavit. Â Although the affidavit does not mention Capers by\r\n  name, it includes Capers as one of the Defendants:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œâ€¦joined\r\n  in this cause under the fictitious names of John Doe, adults, and Richard Roe,\r\n  infants, insane persons, and incompetents, being fictitious names, designating\r\n  as a class any person or legal entity who may be an heir, distributee [sic],\r\n  legatee, devisee, widow, â€¦ofâ€¦ Ernest Capers, â€¦and all other persons or legal\r\n  entities, known and unknown, owning, having and claiming any right, title and\r\n  interest in the parcels of land.â€ \r\n\r\nCapers is also specifically\r\n  listed in the caption of the affidavit. Â In Miles v. Lee, this court\r\n  found an affidavit was facially defective[2] when â€œit purported to show due diligence in ascertaining the whereabouts of\r\n  someone other than the person to be served.â€ 319 S.C. 271, 274, 460 S.E.2d 423,\r\n  425 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  No such situation exists in the present case. Â Indeed,\r\n  Robersonâ€™s counsel was able to locate addresses and mail a Notice of Hearing to\r\n  twenty-two other Defendants. Â Capers has not presented any evidence[3] Roberson or her counsel attempted to intentionally exclude Capers from the\r\n  proceedings. \r\nIn\r\n  her brief to this court, Capers also argues it is clear no effort was made to\r\n  locate her. Â Capers cites the fact that the Complaint, Affidavit of\r\n  Publication, and Order of Publication were all filed on the same day. Â This argument\r\n  also fails.Â  Section 15-9-710 prescribes no timelines or routine to follow when\r\n  filing for service by publication. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-710 (Supp. 1999).Â  â€œAll that this section requires is, that it be made to\r\n  appear by affidavit to the satisfaction of the officer who directs the\r\n  publication, that the defendant has property in the State, that he cannot be\r\n  found therein after due diligence, and that a cause of action exists against\r\n  him.â€ Yates v. Gridley, 16 S.C. 496, 499 (1882).Â  The statute does not\r\n  specify the character of the facts and circumstances which must be stated in\r\n  the affidavit or the quantity of evidence necessary to satisfy the officer\r\n  ordering publication.Â  Yarbrough, 293 S.C. at 292, 360 S.E.2d at\r\n  301 (1987) (citing Yates, 16 S.C. at 500).Â  The publication affidavit can suffice\r\n  even if it contains only a conclusory statement that due diligence was\r\n  exercised[4] and does not set forth facts showing due diligence had, in fact, been\r\n  exercised, so long as the affidavit satisfies the issuing officer.Â  Yarbrough,\r\n  293 S.C. at 292-93, 360 S.E.2d at 301.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the Master is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Hopkins v. Brown is another South Carolina\r\n  case in which the courts have dealt with the issue of whether affidavits in\r\n  support of notice by publication were facially defective. 2006-UP-276 (Ct. App.\r\n  filed June 8, 2006).Â  In that case, the Respondent filed an affidavit indicating\r\n  she could not locate the Appellant, and a Sherriffâ€™s Office filed an affidavit\r\n  indicating they attempted to serve the Appellant but were unable to do so.Â \r\n  This court found, â€œ[t]here is nothing facially defective about these documents\r\n  nor is there any testimony in the record that would indicate the information\r\n  contained therein was untrue.â€&nbsp;Â  \r\n[3] â€œThe movant in a Rule 60(b) motion has the burden of presenting evidence proving the facts essential to\r\n  entitle her to relief.â€ BB&amp;T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 552, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 501, 503 (2006).Â  The burden of presenting evidence of fraud or\r\n  collusion, for example, through the testimony of the clerk who ordered the\r\n  publication, falls to the Appellant. Wachovia Bank of S.C. v. Player,\r\n  341 S.C. 424, 429, 535 S.E.2d 128, 130, n.5 (2000).\r\n[4] â€œWhen the record is silent, the court will presume\r\n  that what should have been done was done.â€Â  Miles v. Lee, 319 S.C. at\r\n  274, 460 S.E.2d at 425 (citing Fouche v. Royal Indemnity Co. of N.Y.,\r\n  217 S.C. 147, 60 S.E.2d 73 (1950)).

Widener, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Lee\r\n  Berlinsky appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment based on the Statute of Frauds in his action against Palmetto Federal Savings Bank\r\n  of South Carolina for breach of loan contract.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nBerlinsky and his brother jointly owned\r\n  property at 103 Ashley Avenue in Charleston, South Carolina.Â  Berlinsky sought\r\n  financing from Palmetto Federal Savings\r\n  Bank of South Carolina (Bank) in order to purchase his brotherâ€™s half interest\r\n  in the property. Â On August\r\n  7, 1996, Berlinsky met with Dana Grooms, a loan officer in the Bankâ€™s Meeting Street office, to discuss Berlinskyâ€™s mortgage needs and the types of loans the Bank\r\n  offered.Â  Specifically, Berlinsky was interested in an $80,000 mortgage at a\r\n  30-year fixed rate of nine percent.Â  During their meeting, Grooms informed\r\n  Berlinsky other Bank employees would review his loan application.Â  When he left\r\n  the August 7 meeting, Berlinsky believed he and the Bank were in the process of\r\n  completing a loan application, but did not believe he had a commitment from the\r\n  Bank for an $80,000 loan.Â  After the meeting, Berlinsky completed the loan application\r\n  and began gathering necessary documentation for approval.Â  \r\nBerlinsky and Grooms remained in contact through additional\r\n  meetings and phone calls.Â  Berlinsky testified he believed the Bank had\r\n  approved a loan at the desired nine percent rate based on his interactions with\r\n  the Bank.Â  Â However, Grooms testified she only offered to refinance Berlinskyâ€™s\r\n  first mortgage rather than loan him $80,000 secured by a second mortgage.Â Â Â  Believing\r\n  the Bank had approved his loan, Berlinsky scheduled a closing date for\r\n  September 13, 1996.Â  On September 11, 1996, Grooms informed Berlinsky the Bank\r\n  had not approved his fixed-rate mortgage. Â Grooms and Emory Ware, Groomsâ€™\r\n  direct supervisor, met with Berlinsky thereafter[2] and explained why his loan had not been approved.Â  At the meeting, they offered\r\n  Berlinsky alternative financing and Berlinsky declined their offer.Â  \r\nBerlinsky brought suit against the Bank for negligent\r\n  misrepresentation, breach of contract, and breach of contract accompanied by a\r\n  fraudulent act.Â  In his complaint, Berlinsky alleged he had to seek alternative\r\n  financing with another lending institution at a higher percentage rate with a\r\n  longer amortization and incurred closing costs of $3,100 as a result of the\r\n  Bank failing to honor its loan commitment.Â  The Bank moved for summary judgment\r\n  based on the Statute of Frauds.Â  The trial court held Berlinskyâ€™s claims were\r\n  barred under Section 37-10-107 of the South Carolina Code (2002) and found\r\n  there was no meeting of the minds between the parties. Â The trial court denied\r\n  Berlinskyâ€™s motion for reconsideration as well as his alternative motion to\r\n  alter or amend the judgment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the\r\n  moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Â Wilson v.\r\n    Moseley, 327 S.C. 144, 146, 488 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1997). Â In ruling on a\r\n  motion for summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences which can be\r\n  reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\n  non-moving party. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Writing Requirement\r\n  under Statute of Frauds\r\nBerlinsky\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting the Bank summary judgment based on Section\r\n  37-10-107 of the South Carolina Code (2002).Â  Berlinsky contends[3] what constitutes a â€œwritingâ€ is unclear under Section 37-10-107 because the\r\n  statute does not set forth the elements such a writing must contain.Â \r\n  Furthermore, he maintains the record contains ample writings between the\r\n  parties sufficiently setting forth the essential terms of the mortgage\r\n  agreement.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Statute of Frauds prevents parties from maintaining legal or equitable actions\r\n  â€œbased upon a failure to perform an alleged promise . . . . to lend or borrow\r\n  moneyâ€ unless a writing evidences such a contract.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  37-10-107(1)(a) (2002).Â  In pertinent part, Section 37-10-107(1)(c) bars claims\r\n  which involve:\r\n\r\n  [A]\r\n    principal amount in excess of fifty thousand dollars, unless the party seeking\r\n    to maintain the action or defense has received a writing from the party to be\r\n    charged containing the material terms and conditions of the promise,\r\n    undertaking, accepted offer, commitment, or agreement and the party to be\r\n    charged, or its duly authorized agent, has signed the writing.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§37-10-107(1)(c) (2002).Â  \r\nBerlinskyâ€™s\r\n  causes of action against the Bank included:Â  (1) breach of contract; (2)\r\n  negligent misrepresentation; and (3) breach of contract accompanied by a\r\n  fraudulent act.Â  We find all of Berlinskyâ€™s claims against the Bank are subject\r\n  to the writing requirements set forth in Section 37-10-107(1) because he sought\r\n  financing from the Bank for a loan in excess of $50,000.Â  Although Berlinsky\r\n  contends the record contains ample writings between the parties setting forth\r\n  the essential terms of the loan agreement, we find no such writing, evidencing\r\n  the contract, exists.[4]Â \r\n  Berlinskyâ€™s loan application is the only writing in the Record on Appeal\r\n  containing material terms of a mortgage agreement and signed by Grooms, the\r\n  Bankâ€™s duly authorized agent.Â  Although it is signed by Grooms, we find this\r\n  writing fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 37-10-107(1)(c) because it\r\n  does not contain any indication of a promise, undertaking, accepted offer,\r\n  commitment, or agreement between the parties. Â The loan application merely\r\n  indicates Berlinskyâ€™s efforts in obtaining approval for a second mortgage.[5]Â  \r\nWithout\r\n  any evidence to conclude otherwise, we find Section 37-10-107(1)(a), prohibiting\r\n  legal or equitable relief based on â€œfailure to perform an alleged promise,â€\r\n  bars Berlinskyâ€™s breach of contract claims.Â  Likewise, since Section\r\n  37-10-107(2)(d) also contains a writing requirement, it bars Berlinskyâ€™s negligent\r\n  misrepresentation claim.\r\nII.Â  Real Estate Mortgage\r\n  Exception\r\nAlternatively,\r\n  Berlinsky cites Section 37-10-107(3)(d) of the South Carolina Code (2002) and\r\n  argues the â€œreal estate mortgage exceptionâ€ excludes his claim from the scope\r\n  of the Statute of Frauds.Â  He contends his claims are not subject to the writing\r\n  requirement because his transaction with the Bank concerned a second mortgage\r\n  on an interest in real property which Section 37-10-107(3) excludes.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nWhen\r\n  courts are asked to define statutory terms, they must give the term its\r\n  ordinary meaning.Â  Hernandez-Zuniga v. Tickle, 374 S.C. 235, 247, 647\r\n  S.E.2d 691, 697 (Ct. App. 2007); State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 102, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 503, 505 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œWhen faced with an undefined statutory term,\r\n  the court must interpret the term in accord with its usual and customary\r\n  meaning.â€). Â An ordinary and customary definition of â€œreal estate mortgageâ€ is\r\n  a loan secured by an interest in real property.Â  See, e.g., Miller v.\r\n    Eagle Star &amp; British Dominions Ins. Co., of London, Eng., U.S. Branch, N.Y.,\r\n  146 S.C. 123, 130-31, 143 S.E. 663, 666 (1928) (â€œA chattel mortgage is a\r\n  conveyance of some present legal or equitable right in personal property, as\r\n  security for the payment of money, or for the performance of some other act.â€); Johnson v. Johnson, 27 S.C. 309, 315, 3 S.E. 606, 609 (1887) (â€œ[A]ccording\r\n  to the common law, a mortgage was a â€˜conveyance of an estate by way of pledge\r\n  for the security of a debt, and to become void upon the payment of it.â€™â€);Â  See also Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 821\r\n  (7th ed. 2000) (â€œA conveyance of title to property that is given as security\r\n  for the payment of a debt or the performance of a duty and that will become\r\n  void upon payment or performance according to the stipulated terms.â€). \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, we find Berlinskyâ€™s claims are not subject to the real estate\r\n  mortgage exception for the simple reason no mortgage ever existed.Â  Berlinskyâ€™s\r\n  suit arose from the Bankâ€™s failure to close a loan it allegedly committed to\r\n  make.Â  Berlinskyâ€™s own assertions demonstrate the absence of such a\r\n  commitment.Â  Furthermore, South Carolina jurisprudence provides â€œmerely\r\n  preliminary negotiations between the parties . . . do not amount to an\r\n  enforceable contract.â€Â  Electro Lab of Aiken, Inc. v. Sharp Constr. Co. of\r\n    Sumter, Inc., 357 S.C. 363, 370, 593 S.E.2d 170, 174 (Ct. App. 2004); see also McLaurin v. Hamer, 165 S.C. 411, 420, 164 S.E. 2, 5 (1932) (stating\r\n  there is no meeting of the minds between the parties when they are merely\r\n  negotiating the terms of an agreement).Â  Seeking approval for a loan and\r\n  entering into an enforceable mortgage agreement are clearly different; therefore,\r\n  Berlinskyâ€™s claims are subject to the writing requirements set forth in Section\r\n  37-10-107(1) and are not excluded by Section 37-10-107(3)(d).Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  trial court did not err in dismissing Berlinskyâ€™s claims against the Bank.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  our determination on the Statute of Frauds issue is dispositive, we need not\r\n  address whether the trial court erred in finding there was no meeting of the\r\n  minds. Futch v.

Nichols, and Stephen Keith Benjamin, all of\r\n          Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This appeal stems from an action for breach of contract and breach of\r\n  contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  The plaintiff, Dr. Paul Weston, M.D., (Weston) obtained a jury verdict\r\n  for $200,000 in actual damages and $300,000 in punitive damages against the\r\n  defendant, the\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  Margaret\r\n  \r\n  J.\r\n  \r\n  Weston\r\n  \r\n  Medical\r\n  \r\n  Center\r\n  (the Center).Â  The Center contends the\r\n  trial judge erred in denying the Centerâ€™s: (1) motion for directed verdict; (2)\r\n  motion for a new trial absolute; (3) motion for a new trial nisi remittitur;\r\n  and (4) motion for a mistrial.Â  We\r\n  affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 24, 2002, Paul Weston, M.D.,\r\n  (Weston) entered into a contract (the Contract) with the Center to serve as its\r\n  medical director in\r\n\r\n    \r\n  Clearwater,\r\n  \r\n  South Carolina.Â  The Contract provided for a two-year term and\r\n  an annual salary of $140,000.Â  The\r\n  Contractâ€™s terms required Weston to work a forty-hour week or provide a minimum\r\n  of eight hours per day in clinical services.Â  Additionally, the Contractâ€™s terms required Weston to attend to patients\r\n  and render treatment, provide consultation with clinical personnel, nurses, and\r\n  doctors, and participate in a quality assurance program.Â  The Contract contained a termination clause\r\n  that provided the following: \r\n\r\n  This agreement shall be effective when all signatures have been affixed\r\n    to the agreement and shall terminate 24 months after signing, however, this\r\n    agreement shall be terminated by either party upon ninety (90) days written\r\n    notice.Â  The [Center] may terminate the\r\n    agreement without notice for cause and may terminate the agreement immediately\r\n    in the event of financial exigency. \r\n\r\nThe Center terminated Weston prior to the expiration of the contract for\r\n  the stated reason of financial exigency.Â  David Macuch (Macuch),\r\n  the Centerâ€™s chief financial officer (CFO), sent Weston a termination letter\r\n  (the Letter) on August 7, 2003, which stated: \r\n\r\n  This letter is formal notice that your employment with [the Center] will\r\n    terminate immediately due to financial exigency.Â  As you may recall, under paragraph ten (10)\r\n    of your employment contract with the Center, the employment agreement may be\r\n    terminated immediately in the event of financial exigency, or for cause.Â  As you know, the Center is currently\r\n    undergoing a critical financial situation at the present time.Â  Because of this, and your unwillingness to\r\n    adhere to the agreed upon job requirements provided in your employment\r\n    agreement with the Center, which has added to the financial exigency, it has\r\n    become necessary to sever the Centerâ€™s employment relationship with you\r\n    immediately.\r\n   . . . \r\n  I regret that this action is necessary, however,\r\n    I am sure that you will agree that the continued success of [the Center] is\r\n    what is most important to all of us.Â  Of\r\n    course, should the Centerâ€™s financial situation improve, or the patient demand\r\n    increase during the term of your contract, you will be invited to return to\r\n    work.\r\n\r\nWeston filed a complaint against the Center alleging retaliatory\r\n  discharge, breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent\r\n  act, gross negligence, and bad faith discharge.Â  The Center filed a third-party complaint against the former chief\r\n  executive officer (CEO) of the Center, Odessa Chavous (Chavous), alleging breach\r\n  of fiduciary duty. Â Chavous denied liability and filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  The trial judge granted the motion for\r\n  summary judgment and dismissed Chavous from the case.\r\n  Â The case was tried before a jury in\r\n  October 2005.Â  \r\nAt trial, Weston admitted he had no access to or knowledge of the\r\n  Centerâ€™s financial status at the pertinent time.Â  However, Weston stated he believed the Board\r\n  of Directors (the Board) â€œsimply used [him] to get their financial house in\r\n  order.â€Â  In addition, Reverend Lester\r\n  Smalls (Smalls), chairman of the Board when the Center hired Weston, testified\r\n  regarding the Centerâ€™s financial situation.Â  As a member of the Board, he stated he received regular financial\r\n  reports, and while he resigned in May 2003 prior to Westonâ€™s termination, he\r\n  could not recall any financial strains while chairman.[1]Â  \r\nWeston averred he performed his duties under the Contract and no one on\r\n  the Board indicated to him they had problems with his job performance.[2] Weston admitted he saw a total of only 214 patients between July 2002 and July\r\n  2003.Â  However, Weston testified he\r\n  believed the Center had a deliberate plan to assign patients to other\r\n  physicians to portray low productivity on Westonâ€™s part.Â  Weston stated the routing of patients\r\n  began shortly after Chavousâ€™ hiring in August 2002. Â Weston further explained his patient numbers\r\n  continued to decrease after Chavous transferred him\r\n  in March 2003 to the Centerâ€™s new site in\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  Jackson,\r\n  \r\n  South Carolina.Â  \r\nConversely, Weston claimed the Board did not carry out its duties under\r\n  the Contract. Â The Board did not permit\r\n  him to supervise other physicians or to participate in the quality assurance\r\n  program.Â  Further, Weston stated there\r\n  was no communication between his office and Chavous,\r\n  who had taken charge of some of the other clinical employees. Â Weston opined this was done to â€œkeep [him] out\r\n  of the loop.â€Â  Weston also stated he\r\n  attended Board meetings in an attempt to give the medical directorâ€™s report and\r\n  so he could report complaints regarding the way the Center was run. Â The complaints included the Boardâ€™s hiring\r\n  of two unlicensed doctors and the limitation placed on Weston from carrying out\r\n  the medical directorâ€™s supervisory duties.Â Â Â  \r\nWeston stated he suffered damages in numerous ways.Â  According to Weston, the situation was\r\n  emotional and traumatizing.Â  Also, Weston\r\n  explained he built an â€œenviable recordâ€ and reputation in the fifty-five years\r\n  of working in the medical community in\r\n  \r\n  Richmond\r\n  \r\n  County,\r\n  \r\n  Aiken\r\n  \r\n  County, the Edgefield area, and\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Augusta,\r\n  Georgia\r\n  .Â  Weston claimed his name had been vilified\r\n  because of the Centerâ€™s breach.Â  Weston\r\n  also stated he was due $140,000 under the contract. Â Additionally, to support Westonâ€™s alternative\r\n  theory of modification of the Contract, he testified the Center never contacted\r\n  him after the Letter to notify him he could return to work at the Center. \r\nMacuch testified he had serious concerns about\r\n  the financial condition of the Center.Â  Specifically, Macuch testified that month\r\n  after month, the Centerâ€™s expenses exceeded its revenues.Â  He explained the disparity existed because\r\n  the revenue from patient encounters was not sufficient to support the growing\r\n  number of personnel at the Center.Â  The\r\n  Center also opened a new site in\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  Jackson,\r\n  \r\n  South Carolina, in March\r\n  2003.Â  Macuch stated it was expected the new center would operate at a loss for the first\r\n  year and at a reduced schedule compared to the\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  Clearwater site.Â Â  \r\nMacuch explained he met with Chavous monthly to discuss the upcoming Board meeting and\r\n  the Centerâ€™s failing finances.Â  Chavous gave Macuch a copy of the\r\n  Contract during a meeting.Â  Macuch reviewed the Contract to determine if there were any\r\n  provisions that could be used to terminate Westonâ€™s employment.Â  According to Macuch,\r\n  he reviewed the Contract and pointed out to Chavous that considering the financial condition of the Center, the Contract with\r\n  Weston could be terminated.Â  Macuch testified he became chief operating officer after\r\n  the Board terminated Chavousâ€™ employment in July\r\n  2003. Â Macuch testified he terminated Westonâ€™s employment at the direction of the Board\r\n  Chair.Â  He further stated had he not\r\n  fired Weston, there would have been a continued financial drain on the\r\n  Center.Â  He explained Weston was paid\r\n  approximately $85,000 from January 2003 to August 2003 but had generated only\r\n  $11,000 in revenue.Â  \r\nAfter Weston concluded his case-in-chief, he moved to abandon all causes\r\n  of action except breach of contract and breach of contract accompanied by a\r\n  fraudulent act.Â  The Center moved for a\r\n  directed verdict on both causes of action, which the trial judge denied.Â Â Â  \r\nDuring the Centerâ€™s case-in-chief,\r\n  witnesses testified as to the Centerâ€™s financial status.Â  Maxine Jefferson, a Board member, testified a\r\n  number of employees were laid off due to the financial crisis.Â  John Shirley (Shirley), the certified public\r\n  accountant who conducted an independent review of the Centerâ€™s financial\r\n  situation in May 2003, stated the Center was â€œrunning out of cashâ€ and was\r\n  headed for rapid disaster.Â  Shirley\r\n  stated his review revealed the Center had to either increase revenue or cut\r\n  expenses, or it had only two months of operation before it had to shut\r\n  down.Â  However, he also testified he did\r\n  not consider in his review the CEOâ€™s aggressive strategy for growth of the\r\n  Center in late 2002 and early 2003. Â Shirley\r\n  also indicated he did not know the Centerâ€™s grant writer had obtained a $600,000\r\n  grant from the government during the same time period as Shirleyâ€™s audit.Â Â  \r\nThe Center also called Dr. James Coleman (Coleman), the Centerâ€™s new CEO,\r\n  to testify about documents from the Center.Â  The Center presented a letter from Health and Human Services dated March\r\n  4, 2005, regarding the Agencyâ€™s response to the Centerâ€™s financial crisis for\r\n  the 2003 fiscal year.Â  Weston objected on\r\n  the grounds of hearsay and relevance. Â The trial judge inquired, â€œ[W]hat is the\r\n  relevance of something in March 4 of â€™05 and weâ€™re talking about [Westonâ€™s]\r\n  termination in July of â€™03?â€Â  Coleman\r\n  testified the letter was in response to the Centerâ€™s handling of the financial\r\n  crisis.Â  Weston again objected on grounds\r\n  of relevancy, and while the letter was admitted into evidence, the trial judge\r\n  further stated he did not see the relevance of the 2005 letter to the 2003\r\n  events in question.Â  The Center moved for\r\n  a mistrial based on the trial judgeâ€™s comments, but the trial judge denied the\r\n  motion and offered to give a curative instruction.Â Â Â  \r\nAt the close of evidence, the Center renewed its motion for directed\r\n  verdict.Â  The trial judge denied the\r\n  motion and included a curative charge regarding his comments.Â  The trial judge then charged the jury\r\n  on breach of contract and breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act. Â After deliberations, the jury returned a\r\n  general verdict against the Center for breach of contract and breach of\r\n  contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, awarding Weston $200,000 in actual\r\n  damages for breach of contract and $300,000 in punitive damages for breach of\r\n  contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  The Center filed its post-trial motions requesting the trial judge to\r\n  set aside the jury verdict and judgment and grant it judgment notwithstanding\r\n  the verdict, in accordance with its motions for directed verdict made during\r\n  the trial. Â In the alternative, the\r\n  Center requested a new trial absolute and a new trial nisi remittitur.\r\n  Â The trial judge denied the Centerâ€™s\r\n  post-trial motions. Â This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  Directed\r\n  Verdict\r\nThe Center contends the trial judge erred in denying its\r\n  motion for directed verdict because Weston failed to produce any evidence the\r\n  Center breached the Contract or breached the purported modified Contract.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œIn deciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict\r\n  motion, the trial court is concerned only with the existence or non-existence\r\n  of evidence.â€Â  Sims\r\n    v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 714, 541 S.E.2d 857, 861 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible to\r\n  more than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the\r\n  jury.Â  Pond Place\r\n    Partners, Inc. v.\r\n\r\n    Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 15,\r\n  567 S.E.2d 881, 888 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed\r\n  verdict . . . this [C]ourt must view the evidence and\r\n  all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id.Â  (internal citations\r\n  omitted).Â  The trial court can only be\r\n  reversed by this Court when there is no evidence to support the ruling below or\r\n  when the ruling is controlled by an error of law.Â  Swinton Creek Nursery v.\r\n    \r\n    Edisto Farm\r\n    Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 477, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999).\r\nA.Â Breach\r\n  of Contract \r\nThe\r\n  Center claims there is no breach of contract because it is â€œunrefutedâ€\r\n  the Center suffered from â€œfinancial exigencyâ€ or a financial crisis.Â  Under Paragraph 10 of the\r\n  Contract, â€œ[the Center] may terminate the agreement without notice for cause\r\n  and may terminate the agreement immediately in the event of financial\r\n  exigency.â€ Â Accordingly, the\r\n  Center contends Westonâ€™s employment was terminated pursuant to the financial\r\n  exigency provision contained in the Contract.Â  Weston argues he presented sufficient evidence the Center did not suffer\r\n  from financial exigency.Â  We agree with\r\n  Weston.Â  \r\nTo prevail in a breach of contract action, the plaintiff\r\n  bears the burden of establishing (1) the existence and terms of the contract,\r\n  (2) the defendantâ€™s breach of one or more of the contractual terms, and (3) the\r\n  damages resulting from the breach.Â  Fuller\r\n    v. E. Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.,\r\n    240 S.C. 75, 89, 124 S.E.2d 602, 610 (1962).\r\nInitially,\r\n  we note Weston established the first element as it is undisputed a contract of\r\n  employment existed between Weston and the Center.Â  Further, Weston established the second\r\n  element since it was reasonable to conclude the Center breached the terms of\r\n  the Contract because Weston presented evidence that the Center did not suffer\r\n  from financial exigency at the time of his termination.Â  \r\nWeston\r\n  testified he believed the Center fired him after he brought the Center out of\r\n  financial difficulty.Â  Further, Smalls\r\n  testified that during Westonâ€™s tenure, the Center sought to aggressively grow\r\n  its budget and the Center was â€œreally moving.â€Â  Additionally, Smalls did not recall â€œany financial strainsâ€ while on the\r\n  Board.Â  While Shirley indicated there was\r\n  an â€œurgent financial situationâ€ at the Center, he also testified he did not\r\n  specifically trace money coming into and out of the Centerâ€™s bank account and\r\n  did not know the Center had obtained a $600,000 grant.Â  Likewise, Shirley admitted he did not\r\n  consider the fact the CEO was trying to aggressively grow the Center during\r\n  late 2002 and early 2003.Â  Coleman acknowledged\r\n  in his prior deposition testimony that the Center had a positive financial\r\n  condition. Â Lastly, the jury could have\r\n  reasonably found Weston satisfied the third element because Weston testified he\r\n  lost $140,000 in wages due to his termination.Â  \r\nViewing\r\n  the evidence in a light most favorable to Weston, we find the breach of\r\n  contract claim was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Consequently, we affirm the portion of the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s order denying the Centerâ€™s motion for directed verdict on breach\r\n  of the Contract.\r\nB.Â Modification\r\n  of Contract \r\nThe\r\n  Center argues Weston presented no evidence to support his alternative theory of\r\n  recovery based on modification of the Contract.Â  We decline to address this issue.\r\nâ€œUnder\r\n  the â€˜two-issueâ€™ rule, when the jury returns a general verdict involving two or\r\n  more issues and its verdict is supported as to at least one issue, the verdict\r\n  will not be reversed on appeal.â€Â  Todd v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 287 S.C. 190, 193, 336 S.E.2d 472, 473-74 (1985).Â  Moreover, this Court will find it unnecessary\r\n  to address all the grounds appealed when one requires affirmance.Â  Dropkin v. Beachwalk Villas Condo. Assâ€™n,\r\n    Inc., 373 S.C. 360, 365,\r\n    644 S.E.2d 808, 811 (Ct. App. 2007). \r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the trial court charged the jury on breach of contract and\r\n  breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  The jury returned a general verdict finding\r\n  the Center had breached the Contract with Weston.Â  As explained above, there is evidence in the\r\n  record that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude the Center breached the\r\n  original Contract with Weston.Â  Because\r\n  the jury returned a general verdict, we must uphold the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  See Smoak v. Liebherr-Am., Inc., 281 S.C. 420, 423, 315\r\n  S.E.2d 116, 118 (1984) (holding when a case is presented to a jury on\r\n  negligence and breach of warranty causes of action, the appellate court need\r\n  not address breach of warranty exceptions if it finds the verdict was supported\r\n  by the evidence under negligence theory); Anderson v. West, 270 S.C.\r\n  184, 188, 241 S.E.2d 551, 553 (1978) (holding when a case is submitted to the\r\n  jury on two or more issues and a general verdict is returned, the verdict will\r\n  be upheld if it is supported by at least one issue).\r\nII.Â  New Trial Absolute\r\nThe Center next argues the trial court erred in denying its\r\n  motion for a new trial absolute, claiming the juryâ€™s verdict was grossly\r\n  excessive and motivated by an improper purpose.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review.Â Â Â  \r\nOn appeal, the Center challenges the $200,000 actual\r\n  damages award on the ground that it is six times the amount permitted under the\r\n  ninety-day notice provision in the Contract.Â  This multiplier is based on the Centerâ€™s argument that Weston is only\r\n  entitled to recover his salary equivalent to the ninety-day notice provision or\r\n  approximately $35,000.[3] Â However, at trial, the Center never relied on\r\n  the ninety-day notice provision as a ground for terminating Weston; rather, the\r\n  Center argued its only basis for terminating Weston was the financial exigency\r\n  provision within the Contract.Â  Because this\r\n  argument was not raised to the trial court, we are constrained by issue\r\n  preservation principles from considering it on appeal. Â \r\n\r\n      See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339\r\n  S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that for an issue to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by\r\n  the trial court).\r\nIII.Â  Thirteenth Juror Doctrine\r\nThe Center contends the trial court erred by not\r\n  granting a new trial pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine as the evidence\r\n  failed to establish a breach or modification of the Contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court, sitting as the thirteenth juror, is charged with\r\n  the duty of seeing that justice is done, and it has the authority to grant new\r\n  trials when it is convinced that a new trial is necessitated on the basis of\r\n  the facts in the case. Â Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 401, 321 S.E.2d 40,\r\n  45 (1984). Â Traditionally, in\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  South Carolina, trial\r\n  courts have the authority to grant a new trial upon the courtâ€™s finding that\r\n  justice has not prevailed. Â Todd v. Owen Indus.\r\n    Prods., Inc., 315\r\n  S.C. 34, 35, 431 S.E.2d 596, 597 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Similarly, the trial court may grant a new\r\n  trial if the verdict is inconsistent with the evidence and reflects the juryâ€™s\r\n  confusion. Â Johnson v. Parker, 279 S.C. 132, 135, 303 S.E.2d 95,\r\n  97 (1983). \r\nA\r\n  trial courtâ€™s order granting or denying a new trial upon the facts will not be\r\n  disturbed unless its decision is wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusion\r\n  was controlled by an error of law. Â Folkens v. Hunt, 300 S.C. 251, 254-55, 387\r\n  S.E.2d 265, 267 (1990). Â When an order pertaining\r\n  to a new trial is before this Court, our review is limited to the consideration\r\n  of whether evidence exists to support the trial courtâ€™s order.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id. at 255, 387 S.E.2d at 267.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find Weston presented sufficient evidence at trial which would permit the jury\r\n  to find the Center breached the original Contract.Â  Because the verdict was not inconsistent with\r\n  the evidence, we find the trial judge properly denied the Centerâ€™s motion to\r\n  grant a new trial pursuant to the thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the Center argues the trial judge erred in denying a new trial under the thirteenth\r\n  juror doctrine as the evidence failed to support a breach of the purported\r\n  modified Contract.Â  We find it unnecessary\r\n  to address this issue because as previously discussed, there is evidence in the\r\n  record to support breach of the original Contract.Â  Consequently, the application of the\r\n  two-issue rule mandates affirmance.Â  See Smoak,\r\n  281 S.C. at 423, 315 S.E.2d at 118 (stating that while appellant raised\r\n  additional exceptions relating to the issue of whether there was sufficient\r\n  evidence of breach of warranty in the record to support the juryâ€™s verdict, it\r\n  was unnecessary to address those issues, as even if the Court found error, the\r\n  application of the â€œtwo issue ruleâ€ would require affirmance).\r\nIV.Â  Punitive Damages\r\n The Center also contends the punitive damages award was\r\n  erroneous because Weston failed to present clear and convincing evidence that\r\n  the Center fraudulently breached the Contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  amount of damages, actual or punitive, remains largely within the discretion of\r\n  the finder of fact, as reviewed by the trial court. Â Gamble v. Stevenson,\r\n  305 S.C. 104, 111, 406 S.E.2d 350, 355 (1991). Â The trial court is vested with considerable\r\n  discretion over the amount of a punitive damages award, and this Courtâ€™s review\r\n  is limited to correcting errors of law. Â Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 305, 536 S.E.2d 408, 421 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n  Â Moreover, the appellate court\r\n  must affirm the trial courtâ€™s punitive damages findings if any evidence\r\n  reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s factual findings. Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298,\r\n  314, 594 S.E.2d 867, 875 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Furthermore, in determining whether the\r\n  evidence is sufficient to support an award of punitive damages, this Court will\r\n  consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and\r\n  will give the prevailing party the benefit of every inference that can reasonably\r\n  be drawn on his or her behalf.Â  Cash v. Kim, 288 S.C. 292, 297, 342 S.E.2d 61, 64 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nMere\r\n  breach of a contract, even if willful or with a fraudulent purpose, is not sufficient to entitle a plaintiff to go to the jury on the issue of punitive\r\n  damages. Â Floyd v.\r\n    Country Squire Mobile Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 51, 53, 336 S.E.2d 502, 503\r\n  (Ct. App. 1985). Â To recover\r\n  punitive damages for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, the\r\n  plaintiff must prove three elements: (1) a breach of contract; (2) a fraudulent\r\n  intent in breaching the contract; and (3) a fraudulent act accompanying the\r\n  breach.Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      Id. at 53-54, 336\r\n  S.E.2d at 503-04.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  previously discussed, evidence exists to support the first element, breach of\r\n  contract.Â  The evidence was likewise\r\n  sufficient to support the juryâ€™s finding on the second and third elements.Â  The jury could reasonably infer from the\r\n  evidence that the Centerâ€™s reliance on the financial exigency clause in the\r\n  Contract was arguably a pretext for terminating Weston such that the second\r\n  element is fulfilled.Â  Macuchâ€™s testimony indicates the Center fraudulently\r\n  intended to breach Westonâ€™s Contract.Â  Macuch testified that the Board Chair, Chavous, gave Macuch a copy of the confidential Contract, despite knowing it was improper for Macuch to review it.Â  Macuch specifically reviewed the Contract to\r\n  determine if there were any provisions that could be used to terminate Westonâ€™s\r\n  employment.Â  He further testified he\r\n  terminated Westonâ€™s employment at the direction of Chavous,\r\n  and if Macuch had failed to terminate Weston, Macuch would have been terminated.Â  \r\nFurther, the third element, a fraudulent act accompanying the breach, is\r\n  supported by the Letter.Â  A â€œfraudulent\r\n  actâ€ is broadly defined as any act characterized by dishonesty in fact or\r\n  unfair dealing.Â  RoTec Servs., Inc., v. Encompass Servs., Inc., 359 S.C.\r\n  467, 470, 597 S.E.2d 881, 883 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In the Centerâ€™s Letter to Weston, the Center based his termination on\r\n  the current financial exigency as well as his â€œunwillingness to adhere to the\r\n  agreed upon job requirements.â€Â  Based on\r\n  the evidence presented, the jury did not believe the Center suffered from\r\n  financial exigency.Â  Further, Macuch testified that in his opinion, Weston fulfilled his\r\n  obligations under the contract.Â  This\r\n  being so, it was logical for the jury to also find the Center dealt dishonestly\r\n  with Weston by using the financial exigency clause as its basis for terminating\r\n  him.Â  \r\nFinding\r\n  these elements were satisfied, we believe the juryâ€™s award of $300,000 in\r\n  punitive damages was well within the range of permissible awards given the\r\n  $200,000 actual damages verdict.Â  Compare Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co.,\r\n  321 S.C. 1, 10, 466 S.E.2d 727, 732 (1996) (upholding a punitive damage award\r\n  that was approximately twenty-eight times the amount of compensatory damages) and Pinckney v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 268 S.C.\r\n  430, 431, 234 S.E.2d 654, 654 (1977) (upholding an award of $5,000 in compensatory\r\n  damages and $4,000 in punitive damages) with Atkinson v. Orkin Exterminating Co., Inc., 361 S.C. 156, 171, 604\r\n  S.E.2d 385, 393 (2004) (reversing an award of punitive damages in a fraudulent\r\n  breach of contract action and finding the 1 to 127 ratio was well above the\r\n  average compensatory-punitive damages ratio).Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Weston, as we must,\r\n  the juryâ€™s punitive damages award is not so arbitrary\r\n  or lacking in evidentiary support as to constitute an error of law.\r\nV.Â  Mistrial\r\nLastly,\r\n  the Center contends the trial judgeâ€™s comments on the relevancy of the Centerâ€™s\r\n  evidence warranted a mistrial despite the judgeâ€™s proffer of a curative\r\n  instruction.Â  We disagree and affirm the\r\n  trial court pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following\r\n  authorities:Â  Black v. Charleston\r\n    &amp; W.C. Ry. Co., 87 S.C. 241, 244-45, 69 S.E. 230, 231 (1910) (finding\r\n  remarks of the court made during the trial in passing on evidence are not\r\n  within the constitutional prohibition against charging juries as to matters of\r\n  fact, unless made to impress on the jury the opinion of the trial court as to\r\n  some vital fact); State v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 400, 360 S.E.2d 706, 711\r\n  (1987) (holding remarks made by a trial judge in ruling on the admissibility of\r\n  evidence or ruling on other matters during the trial do not fall within the\r\n  prohibition against judges charging juries on issues of fact); State v. Mishoe,\r\n  198 S.C. 215, 222-23, 17 S.E.2d 142, 145 (1941) (stating that remarks made by the\r\n  trial court in the course of trial need not be confined in such narrow limits\r\n  as to prevent the trial court from stating its reasons for its rulings); see also Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 306, 486 S.E.2d 750, 758 (1997)\r\n  (finding curative instruction was sufficient to cure any alleged error when\r\n  complaining party failed to show prejudice as a result of trial judgeâ€™s\r\n  statement). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore,\r\n  the order of the trial judge is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Smalls served\r\n  as a member of the Board for roughly eighteen months.Â  He testified he did not attend Board meetings\r\n  after January 2003, in part because of the â€œpower click [on the Board] that had\r\n  come in and undermined [his] leadership.â€Â  While he knew of no financial concerns during his tenure, he stated he\r\n  had no personal firsthand knowledge of the Centerâ€™s financial condition in July\r\n  2003 when Weston was terminated.Â Â  \r\n[2] Additionally, Weston testified the Board never gave\r\n  him an evaluation as required under the terms of the contract. Â \r\n[3] The Center reached this figure by dividing Westonâ€™s\r\n  yearly salary of $140,000 by 365 days.Â  Based on this calculation, Weston earned $383.56 per day, totaling approximately\r\n  $35,000 over a ninety-day period. \r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-241","title":"Reep v.

Turner, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        William P. Hatfield, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this workersâ€™ compensation case, Sonco Technology and Cyprus Insurance Company (collectively\r\n  â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal the circuit court order affirming the South Carolina Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Commissionâ€™s finding that David Reep did not experience a change\r\n  of condition for the better.Â  Appellants also argue the circuit court erred in holding\r\n  Reep suffered from trigger finger as a result of the accident and trigger\r\n  finger is compensable under Reepâ€™s claim.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nReep worked at Sonco Technology as a\r\n  welder/machinist. Â His job involved cutting, fitting, fabricating, and tacking\r\n  weld devices. Â The work required him to use both hands and often involved heavy\r\n  lifting of metal plates, welding supplies, and torches. \r\nReep\r\n  left his job in November of 1999 because of chronic pain, swelling, and loss of\r\n  stregnth in both of hands. Â Reepâ€™s physician, Dr. Rush, diagnosed Reep\r\n  with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and performed open carpal tunnel releases\r\n  on Reepâ€™s hands. Â Reep slowly recovered from the surgeries and began suffering\r\n  from trigger finger. Â Dr. Rush opined Reep sustained a 7.5 percent impairment\r\n  to each hand.Â  \r\nReep filed\r\n  a workersâ€™ compensation action against Appellants on October 16, 2000.Â  The\r\n  latter denied Reepâ€™s claim, arguing his injuries were limited to his wrists.Â \r\n  After a hearing, the single commissioner awarded Reep permanent disability\r\n  benefits and medical expenses.Â  \r\nOn November 9, 2004, Appellants filed a\r\n  request to stop compensation payments.Â  Appellants argued Reep experienced a\r\n  change of condition for the better.Â  They relied upon video surveillance taken\r\n  of Reep using a chainsaw to cut a fallen tree.\r\nA\r\n  hearing was held before the single commissioner on March 17, 2005.Â  Reep\r\n  testified he used the chainsaw to cut down a dead tree for safety reasons.Â  He\r\n  stated that Dr. Rush encouraged him to remain active to avoid the loss of use\r\n  of his hands.Â  Reep also requested additional medical treatment to correct his\r\n  trigger finger.Â  Dr. Rush recommended A-1 pulley release surgery for the\r\n  triggering.\r\n The\r\n  single commissioner held evidence did not support a finding that Reep\r\n  experienced a change of condition for the better.Â  The single commissioner also\r\n  found the videotape surveillance did not convince him that Reep could return to\r\n  work or work outside of his restrictions.Â  The single commissioner further held\r\n  Reep was entitled to additional medical treatment as recommended by Dr. Rush.\r\nAppellants appealed to the appellate panel. The appellate panel\r\n  affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s findings.Â  It specifically found Reep was\r\n  entitled to treatment for his trigger finger as related to his original injury. Â Â Â Â \r\nAppellants then sought judicial review in the circuit court.Â  The\r\n  circuit court affirmed the order of the appellate panel on all issues.Â \r\n  Appellants appeal.\r\n\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Change of Condition\r\n  for the Better\r\nAppellants first\r\n  argue the circuit court erred in finding substantial evidence supported the\r\n  appellate panelâ€™s finding that Reep did not experience a change of condition\r\n  for the better and could not return to work or perform work outside of his medical restrictions.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œThe Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Act provides a mechanism for reopening an award if there has been\r\n  a change in condition.â€ Â Clark v. Aiken County Government,&nbsp;366 S.C.\r\n  102, 108, 620 S.E.2d 99, 102&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005); see S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-90 (Supp. 2006). Â The purpose of this section is to enable the commission to\r\n  change the amount of compensation, including diminishing compensation when\r\n  circumstances indicate a change of condition for the better. Cromer v.\r\n    Newberry Cotton Mills, 201 S.C. 349, 354-55, 23 S.E.2d 19, 21\r\n  (1942). Â Â The determination of whether a claimant has experienced a change of\r\n  condition is a question for the fact finder.Â  Gattis v. Murrells Inlet VFW,\r\n  353 S.C. 100, 576 S.E.2d 191 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  An appellate court will not\r\n  disturb the findings of the workersâ€™ compensation commission if its findings\r\n  are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.Â  Lark v.\r\n    Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).\r\nHere, substantial\r\n  evidence supports the commissionâ€™s finding that Reep did not experience a\r\n  change of condition for the better. Â The only evidence Appellants submitted to support a change of\r\n  condition was the videotape of Reep using a chainsaw and one report from a\r\n  non-treating physician who viewed the videotape.Â  Reep testified he used the\r\n  chainsaw, but the chainsaw was only six pounds and was not as difficult to\r\n  maneuver as the machines he used as a welder/machinist.Â  In addition, Reep\r\n  testified Dr. Rush encouraged him to keep his hands active to avoid the loss of\r\n  use of his hands. Â Reep also stated he has trouble making a fist with his\r\n  hands, buttoning his clothing, zipping a zipper, squeezing toothpaste, tying\r\n  his shoes, and shaving.Â  Further, Dr. Rushâ€™s medical evaluations indicate Reep\r\n  continues to suffer pain in his hands and fingers. \r\nII.Â  Trigger Finger\r\nAppellants next argue the circuit court\r\n  erred in finding Reep suffered from trigger finger as a result of the accident\r\n  and trigger finger is compensable under Reepâ€™s claim.Â  Specifically, Appellants\r\n  argue Reepâ€™s trigger finger is not causally related to the accident or Reepâ€™s carpal\r\n  tunnel syndrome. Â \r\nWe are bound, of course, to uphold the commissionâ€™s\r\n  decision unless its factual determination is not supported by substantial\r\n  evidence. Jones v.\r\n    Georgia-Pacific Corp.,&nbsp;355 S.C. 413, 417-18, 586 S.E.2d 111,\r\n  113-14&nbsp;(2003); S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-386(A)(6) (Supp. 2006) (â€œ[T]he court\r\n  shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of\r\n  evidence on the questions of fact.â€).\r\nWhile Dr. Rush never specifically opined that Reepâ€™s\r\n  trigger finger condition is causally related to the accident or Reepâ€™s carpal\r\n  tunnel syndrome, Dr. Rush noted that Reep experienced triggering within a month\r\n  after his second carpal tunnel release surgery.Â  He recommended surgery on Reepâ€™s\r\n  affected fingers as the appropriate treatment. Â We therefore hold substantial\r\n  evidence was presented upon which the commission could conclude Reep suffered from trigger finger as a result of the accident. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY,\r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-242","title":"State v.

Beard, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this workersâ€™ compensation case, Darryl Carlson sought benefits from his\r\n  employer, Poston Packing Company, Inc., and its carrier (collectively, Poston)\r\n  after he slipped and fell while loading crates of food into a freezer.Â  The\r\n  Single Commissioner found Carlson suffered multiple injuries to his groin due\r\n  to the accident, including an inguinal hernia diagnosed eight months after the\r\n  fall, as well as a psychological injury.Â  The Single Commissioner further found\r\n  Carlson had not yet reached maximum medical improvement (MMI).Â  An Appellate\r\n  Panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (the Commission)\r\n  upheld the determination that Carlson suffered injuries to his groin, but\r\n  specifically reversed the portions of the order finding Carlson had suffered an\r\n  inguinal hernia and a psychological injury as a result of the accident and that\r\n  he had not reached MMI.Â  The circuit court affirmed the Commissionâ€™s order, and\r\n  Carlson appeals.Â  We affirm insofar as there is substantial evidence to support\r\n  the Commissionâ€™s determination that Carlson has not established hisÂ  claim for\r\n  a psychological injury. We reverse the Commissionâ€™s findings that Carlson has\r\n  not established his claim for a hernia and that Carlson has reached MMI.Â \r\n  Finally, we remand this case to the circuit court for it to direct the\r\n  Commission to make a new determination as to MMI in light of our holding.[1]\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes\r\n  the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Commission.Â  West v.

Spartan Mills,\r\n  276 S.C. 216, 277 S.E.2d 590 (1981). \r\n1.Â  Consideration\r\n  of medical report and denial of claim for psychological injury (Carlsonâ€™s\r\n  Issues I &amp; II).Â  We hold the\r\n  Commission properly determined the Single Commissioner erred in excluding from\r\n  evidence the medical report of Dr. Selman Watson.Â  We likewise hold the\r\n  Commission did not err in relying on the report and using it as a basis to deny\r\n  Carlsonâ€™s claim for a psychological injury.Â  \r\nCarlsonâ€™s accident occurred on September 8, 2003.[2]Â  Poston sent Carlson to Dr. Watson on October 22, 2004 for a\r\n  psychological evaluation because Carlson was claiming that he sustained a\r\n  psychological injury as a result of his accident.Â  The Commission noted Poston\r\n  stated in its Prehearing Brief that it had not received a copy of the report,\r\n  but that it reserved the right to submit it at the hearing.Â  At the hearing,\r\n  the Single Commissioner did not allow the report in after Carlson objected,\r\n  stating it was not timely because if the report were allowed in, then he would\r\n  have to allow additional time for the doctor to be deposed and it would\r\n  â€œclutter up the system.â€Â  The Commission ruled it was improper for the Single\r\n  Commissioner not to allow the report because Carlson was on notice that Poston\r\n  was waiting for the report, Carlson was the participant in the evaluation and\r\n  thus was clearly aware that a report would be forthcoming, and Poston had no\r\n  control over when the doctor issued his report.Â  We find no abuse of discretion\r\n  with the Commissionâ€™s determination that Carlson was on notice about the report\r\n  prior to the hearing, as well as the Commissionâ€™s consideration of the report.\r\nLikewise, the Commission did not err in then considering this\r\n  report as a basis for denying Carlsonâ€™s claim for a psychological injury.Â  Although there is certainly evidence supporting\r\n  Carlsonâ€™s claims, there is contrary evidence in the record that the Commission\r\n  relied upon to support its decision to reverse the Single Commissionerâ€™s\r\n  finding Carlson suffered a compensable psychological claim.Â  The Commission\r\n  noted that Dr. Watson opined in his report of October 22, 2004 that although\r\n  Carlson suffered from some anxiety, â€œit does not rise to a level that would\r\n  warrant specialized professional attention or the need for medication.â€ Â Further,\r\n  the Commission noted â€œDr. Watson opined that there was reason to suspect some\r\n  exaggeration of the claimantâ€™s condition as tested by the PAI profile.â€Â  In\r\n  addition, â€œDr. Watson opined the claimant suffered from a personality disorder\r\n  that had developed over quite some time.â€Â  Because we have found no error in\r\n  the Commissionâ€™s finding that the Single Commissioner should not have excluded\r\n  the report, the Commission properly considered Dr. Watsonâ€™s opinions.Â \r\n  Accordingly, based on our limited scope of review, we hold there is substantial\r\n  evidence to support the decision of the Commission.\r\n2.Â  Denial of\r\n  compensation for inguinal hernia (Carlsonâ€™s Issue III).Â  We hold the Commission\r\n  erred in reversing the Single Commissionerâ€™s finding that Carlsonâ€™s inguinal\r\n  hernia was caused by his work-related accident of September 8, 2003.Â  Our\r\n  holding in this regard is made with a profound appreciation of our limited and\r\n  highly-deferential scope of\r\n  appellate review.Â  Yet the concept of â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ must have some\r\n  meaning, and having carefully reviewed the record, we are convinced that the\r\n  evidence points to the inescapable conclusion that Carlsonâ€™s inguinal hernia\r\n  was caused by his work-related accident, as found by the Single Commissioner\r\n  and the dissenting member of the Commission.Â  We base this decision, in part,\r\n  on our determination that the Commission committed a legal error in its\r\n  characterization of the evidence.Â  And, as noted, substantial evidence does not\r\n  support the Commissionâ€™s decision in this regard.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380(A)(5)(d) &amp; (e) (Supp. 2007) (stating an appellate court may\r\n  reverse the Commission when its decision is affected by an error of law or is\r\n  clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\r\n  on the whole record).Â  \r\nCarlsonâ€™s authorized treating physicians were Dr. Carolyn Becker\r\n  Reynolds of McLeod Occupational Health Associates and Dr. E. Daniel Guyton of\r\n  Florence Urological Associates.Â  Carlson was diagnosed with a hernia in May\r\n  2004 and had surgery to alleviate it in September 2004.Â  The Single Commissioner, citing the testimony of the\r\n  treating physicians, particularly Dr. Reynolds, concluded Carlsonâ€™s hernia was\r\n  caused by his work-related accident.Â  The Single Commissioner noted there was a\r\n  delay in the diagnosis of Carlsonâ€™s hernia due to the fact that he was not\r\n  given the particular type of ultrasound that would diagnose this condition.Â  In\r\n  addition, Carlson was unable to undergo the physical exam necessary to discover\r\n  the hernia in the early stages of his injury.[3]Â \r\n  Dr. Reynolds testified that she was â€œgreater than\r\n  ninety percent certain that this [hernia] was [incurred] as a result of his\r\n  [Carlsonâ€™s] initial injury.â€Â  The Single Commissioner observed:\r\n\r\n  She [Dr. Reynolds] further explained that the hernia\r\n    was not discovered after the initial injury because the injury to his scrotum\r\n    prevented digital examination of the inguinal area and masked the hernia\r\n    symptoms, and that the previous ultrasounds had not examined peristaltic\r\n    movement. . . .Â  Dr. Reynolds was . . . adamant in her opinion that the\r\n    September 8, 2003 injury caused Mr. Carlsonâ€™s hernia.Â  \r\n\r\nMcLeod\r\n  Occupational Health Associates had referred Carlson to Dr. E. Daniel Guyton of\r\n  Florence Urological Associates for treatment of the separate injury to his\r\n  scrotum.Â  Dr. Guyton diagnosed Carlson as having an injury to his left\r\n  epididymis (spermatic cord) and gave him conservative treatment.Â  When Carlson\r\n  continued to have pain, Dr. Guyton surgically removed Carlsonâ€™s left epididymis\r\n  in September 2004.Â  Dr. Guyton stated Carlsonâ€™s work injury caused a hematoma\r\n  to form in Carlsonâ€™s left epidydimis and when it resolved, it left scar tissue\r\n  that caused some pain.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Single Commissioner noted there was no evidence in the record that Carlsonâ€™s\r\n  hernia pre-existed his September 8, 2003 accident, and there was no evidence in\r\n  the record of any cause other than this accident.Â  The Single Commissioner\r\n  further found that Carlson was â€œnot at MMI.â€Â  \r\nIn a two-to-one decision, the Commission reversed the Single\r\n  Commissionerâ€™s finding that Carlsonâ€™s inguinal hernia was a compensable injury\r\n  caused by his work-related accident.Â  The Commission correctly stated that\r\n  under section 42-9-40 of the South Carolina Code, a claimant has the burden of\r\n  â€œdefinitelyâ€ proving the following:Â  \r\n\r\n  (1)Â  That there was an injury resulting in hernia or rupture;\r\n  (2)Â  That the hernia or rupture appeared suddenly;\r\n  (3)Â  That it was accompanied by pain;\r\n  (4)Â  That the hernia or rupture immediately followed an accident;\r\n    and\r\n  (5)Â  That the hernia or rupture did not exist prior to the\r\n    accident for which compensation is claimed.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  42-9-40 (1985).Â  \r\nIn reversing the Single Commissioner, a majority of the Commission\r\n  inexplicably stated Dr. Reynolds â€œwas unable to state to within a reasonable\r\n  degree of medical certainty that the claimantâ€™s hernia in May of 2004, was the\r\n  result of his work injury on September 8, 2003.â€Â  This purported finding simply\r\n  finds no evidentiary support in the record.Â  This alleged uncertainty on\r\n  Dr. Reynoldsâ€™ part is a mischaracterization of her testimony.Â  Dr. Reynolds\r\n  expressly testified that she was â€œgreater than ninety percent certain that this\r\n  [hernia] was [incurred] as a result of his [Carlsonâ€™s] initial injury.â€Â  She stated it had gone undiagnosed and was â€œthe\r\n  missing piece of the puzzleâ€ as to what was causing Carlsonâ€™s continuing pain.Â  Â Â Â \r\nAlthough the Commission was free to disbelieve Dr. Reynoldâ€™s\r\n  testimony, it did not specifically find that her testimony was lacking\r\n  credibility or reject it as otherwise flawed.Â  Rather, the Commission asserted\r\n  that she failed to state an opinion to within a reasonable degree of medical\r\n  certainty.Â  We believe this mischaracterization of the testimony is legal error\r\n  that affected the result in this case.Â  Cf. Seaboard Sys. R.R., Inc.\r\n    v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 290 S.C. 275, 349 S.E.2d 896 (Ct. App. 1986)\r\n  (recognizing the general principles that the Public Service Commission as an\r\n  agency was responsible for determining the credibility of witnesses and that it\r\n  was not required to accept testimony even if it were uncontradicted, but\r\n  holding these principles â€œare not applicable in the instant case because the\r\n  Commission did not indicate anywhere in its order that it rejected the evidence\r\n  presented by Seaboard as not credibleâ€; the appellate court concluded the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s decision was not supported by substantial evidence). \r\nMoreover, the Commission based its finding, in large part, on the testimony\r\n  of Dr. Guyton, who treated the injury to Carlsonâ€™s epididymis.Â  The Commission\r\n  stated, â€œImportantly, Dr. Guyton testified . . . the claimant could have\r\n  sustained another accident which led to his hernia condition.â€Â  Upon reviewing\r\n  his testimony, we note Dr. Guyton acknowledged that he did not diagnose\r\n  Carlsonâ€™s hernia, did not treat him for a hernia, and he did not know when\r\n  Carlson sustained his hernia.Â  Dr. Guyton stated the hernia could have been\r\n  caused by his work-related accident or it was â€œpossibleâ€ that Carlsonâ€™s hernia\r\n  was incurred after Carlsonâ€™s 2003 accident.Â  Dr. Guyton explained that\r\n  sometimes hernias â€œare more subtle and it takes somebody with more expertise in\r\n  dealing with hernias to determine whether that is, you know, symptomatic or not\r\n  [and] whether the pain you are having is a hernia or not.â€Â  When asked about when Carlsonâ€™s hernia developed, Dr.\r\n  Guyton stated that he would â€œhave to defer to general surgery [sic] who does\r\n  hernia.â€ More to the point, Dr. Guyton made it crystal clear that\r\n  his treatment of Carlson was unrelated to the hernia, for Dr. Guyton does not\r\n  specifically treat hernias in his practice.Â  \r\nWe do not fault the Commission for assigning weight to the\r\n  testimony of Dr. Guyton in its quest to deny compensability for Carlsonâ€™s\r\n  hernia.Â  Our concern is with the complete lack of a nexus from the Commissionâ€™s\r\n  findings and the actual evidence.Â  To be sure, the Commission is free to make\r\n  findings, but those findings must have at least a slight connection to the\r\n  evidentiary record.Â  Findings made from whole cloth cannot meet the minimal\r\n  substantial evidence threshold.Â  Moreover, we are mindful that Dr. Guyton, when\r\n  pressed, speculated that it was â€œpossibleâ€ that Carlson may have sustained\r\n  another injury.Â  If such speculative testimony were found to be sufficient, the\r\n  already thin concept of substantial evidence would be an empty shell.Â  Here,\r\n  the only evidence to within a reasonable degree of medical certainty is that of\r\n  Dr. Reynolds, whose testimony the Commission mischaracterized.Â  Because the\r\n  only basis for the Commissionâ€™s decision rests on speculation, and\r\n  concomitantly the evidence allows reasonable minds to only reach the conclusion\r\n  that Carlsonâ€™s hernia was caused by the work related accident, we reverse the\r\n  Commission.[4] \r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, we hold the Commission\r\n  erred.Â  See Grant v. Grant Textiles, 372 S.C. 196, 202, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 869, 872 (2007) (â€œWhile the appellate courts are required to be\r\n  deferential to the full commission regarding questions of fact, this deference\r\n  does not prevent the courts from overturning the full commissionâ€™s decision\r\n  when it is legally incorrect as it is here.â€); Thompson v. S.C. Steel Erectors, 369 S.C. 606, 612, 632 S.E.2d 874, 878&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2006) (stating under the APA an appellate court may reverse the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s decision if the claimantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced\r\n  because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in\r\n  view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record).\r\n3.Â  Finding that\r\n  MMI was reached by May 2004 (Carlsonâ€™s Issue IV).Â  Carlson lastly challenges\r\n  the Commissionâ€™s determination that he reached MMI by May 2004.Â  The Commission\r\n  concluded Carlson reached MMI after finding Carlsonâ€™s hematoma had resolved\r\n  itself by May 2004 and that Carlsonâ€™s causally-related injuries did not include\r\n  a hernia.Â  Since the Commission affirmed the Single Commissionerâ€™s finding that\r\n  Carlson had also suffered an injury to his epididymis, and Carlsonâ€™s treatment\r\n  for this injury occurred after May 2004, the Commission erred in finding\r\n  Carlson had reached MMI by May 2004.Â  In addition, since we are reversing the\r\n  finding regarding Carlsonâ€™s inguinal hernia and hold that it is compensable,\r\n  the finding of MMI must be revisited.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the Commissionâ€™s\r\n  finding in this regard and remand this matter to the circuit court, which shall\r\n  direct the Commission to reconsider the issue of MMI.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Documents in the record on appeal also give the date\r\n  of the accident as September 9, 2003.\r\n[3] Dr. Reynolds testified that there were â€œbasically two\r\n  reasons why the hernia was not diagnosed after [Carlsonâ€™s] September 2003\r\n  incident.Â  One is that the concentration was on the scrotal and the testicular\r\n  injury and the other would be that the ultrasound was not performed in a way\r\n  that the hernia would be revealed[.]â€Â  Dr. Reynolds further stated Carlson\r\n  could not be given a proper physical exam to detect the hernia in the earlier\r\n  stages of his injury.Â  There is no evidence to contradict these findings.\r\n[4]Â  Essentially, the Commission\r\n  committed legal error in stating Dr. Reynolds failed to testify to within a\r\n  reasonable degree of medical certainty about causation, even though she stated\r\n  she was â€œgreater than ninety percent certainâ€ that the work-related accident\r\n  caused Carlsonâ€™s hernia.Â  We believe Dr. Reynoldsâ€™s testimony meets the level\r\n  of certainty required for medical causation.Â  Further, the Commission\r\n  extensively relied upon the testimony of Dr. Guyton, even though he was unable\r\n  to testify to a reasonable medical certainty about the cause of Carlsonâ€™s\r\n  hernia and in fact stated he could not ascertain the cause of Carlsonâ€™s hernia\r\n  because he did not treat him for that condition and would have to defer to the\r\n  expertise of others.\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-244","title":"Magaha v.

(the Mill) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order in this\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation action.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nBessie M. Magaha was employed with the Mill for over thirty years\r\n  as a weaver.Â  In November of 1998, the Mill transferred Magaha to work on a larger\r\n  loom.Â  Magaha alleged she sustained an injury to her right shoulder, arm, and\r\n  hand.Â  She first sought treatment for the pain from her family doctor on\r\n  January 11, 1999.Â  Magaha had two surgeries on her shoulder and sought payment\r\n  of medical expenses and temporary total and permanent total disability.Â  The\r\n  Mill denied Magaha sustained an injury by accident and alleges it did not\r\n  receive notice of the injury until it received a Form 50 on December 29, 2000,\r\n  almost two years after the alleged accident.\r\nAt the hearing before the single commissioner, Magaha argued she\r\n  suffered repetitive trauma to her right shoulder after moving to the larger\r\n  loom.Â  Magaha is five-feet, one-inch tall, was in her sixties at the time of\r\n  the alleged accident, and has a seventh grade education.Â  Magaha testified she\r\n  informed Ronnie Butler, her supervisor at the Mill, of problems with her\r\n  shoulder on the first day she used the new loom.Â  At a prior deposition, Magaha\r\n  testified she told Butler the soreness in her shoulder and arm was getting\r\n  worse but did not explicitly tell Butler the soreness was related to her work.Â \r\n  She explained at the hearing that she â€œfigured he probably would [think] . . .\r\n  that itâ€™s something . . . from work.â€Â  Butler testified before the single\r\n  commissioner that he did not remember whether Magaha told him about her injury.Â \r\n  Nor did he remember whether Magaha complained about the new loom.Â  Butler claimed he would have noted any complaints on Magahaâ€™s attendance card, pursuant to\r\n  the Millâ€™s policy.Â  Butler conceded Magaha was a good worker, retired without\r\n  any warnings, and rarely, if ever, complained.Â  \r\nMagaha began receiving short-term disability benefits in March or\r\n  April of 1999.Â  On her application for short term disability, Magaha\r\n  represented that her injuries were not work-related.Â  On cross-examination on\r\n  the issue, Magaha testified that the Mill did not explain the short-term\r\n  disability form to her and she did not remember checking a box on the form\r\n  denying her injury was work-related.Â  Magaha has suffered a stroke, has had a\r\n  guardian ad litem appointed for her, and could not remember whether the Mill\r\n  helped her fill out the disability forms.Â  Â Â \r\nAfter shoulder surgery in March of 1999, Magaha returned to work.Â \r\n  Within two weeks, the pain returned.Â  Magaha retired in July of 2000, had\r\n  carpal tunnel surgery in October of 2000, and had a second shoulder surgery in\r\n  February of 2002.Â  \r\nDr. Michael Bryant, Magahaâ€™s treating physician, wrote the Mill\r\n  after Magahaâ€™s first consultation.Â  By letter dated January 19, 1999, Dr.\r\n  Bryant informed the Mill:\r\n\r\n  Ms. Magaha had been seen in my office on 1/11/99 with impingement\r\n    syndrome with continued pain and discomfort.Â  She had some decreased strength\r\n    secondary to the pain as well as pain on internal and external rotation of the\r\n    right upper extremity . . . .Â  She is no longer doing the job that caused\r\n      the impingement syndrome but continues to be debilitated at work working in\r\n    pain. . . . I would appreciate your consideration in helping her cover this\r\n    expense, as I think it will be less costly overall in her treatment. (Emphasis\r\n    added.) \r\n\r\nThe Mill\r\n  stipulated it received this letter. Â Â \r\nThe single commissioner found Magaha failed to prove a compensable\r\n  injury and failed to give sufficient notice of having sustained an injury by\r\n  accident.Â  With one dissent, the full commission adopted the findings of the\r\n  single commissioner. \r\nMagaha\r\n  appealed the issues of notice and compensability to the circuit court.Â  In\r\n  closing arguments at the circuit court hearing, Magahaâ€™s counsel argued:\r\n\r\n  I think\r\n    notice is everything.Â  If she gave notice that she started an investigation to\r\n    see if it was work related.Â  Clearly the hearing commissioner was also\r\n    concerned because . . . he asked the supervisor whether the [new loom] was\r\n    bigger than the one she used to work on and he said it was, he admitted it was\r\n    by probably an inch or two.Â  So, that crucial two inches is very important and\r\n    it is going down to whether she had to stretch further.Â  And I think it is not\r\n    appropriate and it is not fair and . . . [it] is not supported by substantial\r\n    evidence.Â  They didnâ€™t even conduct any kind of investigation, it is not legal,\r\n    it is not proper for them to take Dr. Bryantâ€™s notes and put [them] in a\r\n    personnel file without going out on the floor.Â  [Magahaâ€™s supervisor] couldnâ€™t\r\n    remember anything and that was one of the biggest problems in the case. . . .\r\n    And if a proper investigation had been done, looking at the whole record then\r\n    they would of (sic) found the case was compensable. \r\n\r\nThe discussion portion of the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order states:Â  \r\n\r\n  In this case, Dr. Bryant provided all the information\r\n    that the Employer needed to properly investigate [Magahaâ€™s] injury.Â  He told\r\n    [the Mill] that a job change had caused the impingement syndrome, that Claimant\r\n    was experiencing pain and discomfort in her right upper extremity which was her\r\n    predominant arm for work, and that he was requesting that the Employer cover\r\n    the expense of medical treatment.\r\n  This information should have launched an investigation\r\n    by the Employer into the specifics of Claimantâ€™s medical problems and whether\r\n    or not a work related injury had occurred.Â  Unfortunately for Claimant, the\r\n    record does not contain any evidence that the Employer made any reasonable\r\n    effort to determine the cause of the injury or to question the Claimant or\r\n    plant personnel when their memories were still fresh.Â  Under these\r\n    circumstances, the Employer would be unable to properly determine whether or\r\n    not Claimantâ€™s medical problems were work-related.\r\n  As a further result, the Claimant was not afforded the\r\n    opportunity to be provided medical care and treatment by the Employer.Â  If\r\n      this injury is later conclusively deemed work related on remand, the\r\n    Employer has lost the chance to supervise and to direct her medical care and\r\n    treatment. (Emphasis added.)\r\n\r\nThe order concludes:\r\n\r\n  The only evidence in the record is that Claimant has\r\n    met the statutory notice requirements of Section 42-15-20 as a matter of law.Â \r\n    The decision of the Commission is hereby reversed and the matter is remanded to\r\n    the Commission for further findings of fact consistent with this order.\r\n\r\nThe Mill\r\n  appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe Full\r\n  Commission is the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases.â€Â  Etheredge\r\n    v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 454, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 2002).Â \r\n  â€œThe findings of the Commission are presumed correct and will be set aside only\r\n  if unsupported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Id.Â  However, â€œ[s]ubstantial\r\n  evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly\r\n  from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a\r\n  whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the\r\n  administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its\r\n  action.â€Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306\r\n  (1981).Â  A court may reverse or modify a decision of the commission if\r\n  substantial rights of a party have been prejudiced because the findings,\r\n  inferences, conclusions, or decisions are affected by other error of law.Â  Etheredge,\r\n  349 S.C. at 456, 562 S.E.2d at 682.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAPPEALABILITY\r\nOur\r\n  initial consideration in this case centers on whether the circuit courtâ€™s order\r\n  is immediately appealable.Â  The Mill argues the circuit court reversed the\r\n  commissionâ€™s finding on the issue of timely notice but failed to rule on the\r\n  issue of compensability of the injury and therefore the order is final and\r\n  immediately appealable.Â  Magaha argues the circuit courtâ€™s order remands the\r\n  action for further proceedings and therefore the issue is not immediately\r\n  appealable pursuant to Montjoy v. Asten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52,\r\n  446 S.E.2d 618 (1994).\r\nThe South Carolina appellate courts â€œhave consistently held that an order of the circuit court\r\n  remanding a case for additional proceedings before an administrative agency is\r\n  not directly appealable.â€Â  Montjoy, 316 S.C. at 52, 446 S.E.2d at 618.Â \r\n  However, our appellate courts also recognize that remand orders from the\r\n  circuit court to an administrative agency may be immediately appealable where\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order constitutes a final decision on the merits and the\r\n  remand order has no effect on the finality of the decision.Â  Foggie v.\r\n    General Elec. Co., 376 S.C. 384, 389, 656 S.E.2d 395, 397 (Ct. App. 2008).Â \r\n  In Brown v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., this court found the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  order finally determined an issue on the merits and the remand merely directed\r\n  the commission to make the necessary findings to effectuate the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  order.Â  366 S.C. 379, 387, 622 S.E.2d 546, 551 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Viewing the\r\n  order based on the Millsâ€™ interpretation, solely for the issue of appealability,\r\n  we find the order immediately appealable.\r\nNOTICE\r\nThe\r\n  Mill first argues the circuit court erred in reversing the commissionâ€™s finding\r\n  that Magaha gave timely notice of the accident.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  42-15-20 of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act requires that every injured employee\r\n  give the employer notice of a job-related accident within ninety days after its\r\n  occurrence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (Supp. 2007).Â  â€œSection 42-15-20\r\n  provides no specific method of giving notice, the object being that the\r\n  employer be actually put on notice of the injury so he can investigate it\r\n  immediately after its occurrence and can furnish medical care for the employee\r\n  in order to minimize the disability and his own liability.â€Â  Bass v. Isochem,\r\n  365 S.C. 454, 472-73, 617 S.E.2d 369, 379 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The notice\r\n  requirement is to be construed liberally in favor of claimants.Â  Etheredge,\r\n  349 S.C. at 458, 562 S.E.2d at 683.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Mill conceded it received Dr. Bryantâ€™s letter, in which he informs the Mill of\r\n  Magahaâ€™s injury and its relationship to her work.Â  In Etheredge, this\r\n  court found a letter from the employeeâ€™s family physician provided notice to\r\n  employer.Â  Id. at 458, 562 S.E.2d at 683.Â  In light of the law requiring\r\n  the liberal construction of the notice provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  Act, we conclude Dr. Bryantâ€™s letter provided notice to the Mill.Â  Â \r\nCOMPENSABILITY OF INJURY\r\nThe\r\n  Mill next argues the circuit courtâ€™s remand does not affect the commissionâ€™s\r\n  ruling on the compensability of Magahaâ€™s injury, and thus the issue of\r\n  compensability is â€œlaw of the case.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œLaw\r\n  of the caseâ€ is a doctrine dissuading courts from revisiting settled issues.Â \r\n  John R. Knight, The Law of the Case Doctrine:Â  What Does it Really Mean?,\r\n  43-Oct. Fed.R.Law. 8 (1996).Â  Where a litigant fails to appeal a ruling on a\r\n  particular issue, that ruling becomes law of the case.Â  See Resolution\r\n    Trust Corp. v. Eagle Lake &amp; Golf Condominiums, 310 S.C. 473, 475, 427\r\n  S.E.2d 646, 648 (1993) (finding an unappealed ruling is law of the case).\r\nAfter\r\n  a thorough review of Magahaâ€™s notice of appeal to the circuit court, the\r\n  transcript of the hearing, and the circuit courtâ€™s order, we find the doctrine\r\n  of â€œlaw of the caseâ€ does not apply.Â  First, Magaha raised the issue of compensability\r\n  in her notice of appeal to the circuit court.Â  Furthermore, reading the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order as a whole, we find the emphasized language in the order\r\n  indicates the circuit court expects the commission to revisit the issue of\r\n  whether Magaha suffered an injury by accident arising out of and in the course\r\n  and scope of her employment.Â  We recognize the circuit court did not\r\n  specifically rule on the issue in the conclusion portion of the order.Â \r\n  However, given the circuit courtâ€™s clear reversal on the issue of notice, there\r\n  was no need for the court to remand with instructions for â€œfurther findings of\r\n  fact consistent with this orderâ€ unless the court expected further proceedings\r\n  on the issue of injury by accident.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order reversing the commissionâ€™s finding on notice and remanding\r\n  the action to the commission for further proceedings on the issue of whether\r\n  Magaha suffered an injury by accident arising out of and in the course and\r\n  scope of her employment is Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-245","title":"Wolf v.

Felder and Thomas Derrick Felder, both of St. Matthews,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The\r\n  family court granted Marion H. Wolf (Wife) and Robert L. Wolf (Husband) a\r\n  divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s separation and divided the partiesâ€™\r\n  property.Â  Husband appeals, asserting the family court erred in awarding the\r\n  marital home to Wife, in finding he was in possession of some of Wifeâ€™s\r\n  jewelry, in awarding Wife an additional $50,000 from an investment account, and\r\n  by admitting evidence of Husbandâ€™s conviction for tax evasion.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nWife married Husband, a physician, in New York City on November\r\n  21, 1985.Â  Wife was then 42, Husband was 57.Â  It was the second marriage for\r\n  both parties and no children were born of the marriage.Â  At the urging of\r\n  Husband, the parties executed a prenuptial agreement on September 13, 1985.Â \r\n  The primary relevance of the prenuptial agreement to this litigation was the\r\n  partiesâ€™ intent to treat as separate, nonmarital property all property titled in\r\n  their respective individual names.Â  This contractual arrangement stemmed from\r\n  Husbandâ€™s prior difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service.\r\nHusband and Wife originally lived in New York City, where Husband\r\n  maintained his medical practice, and in a home in Danbury, Connecticut (the\r\n  â€œConnecticut Propertyâ€).Â  Husband acquired the Connecticut Property before the\r\n  partiesâ€™ marriage, but Husband transferred title to his son to keep it out of\r\n  his name for tax and other purposes.Â  The son deeded the Connecticut Property\r\n  to Wife in 1987 for $1.00.Â  Â Â \r\nThe couple moved to South Carolina in 1994 and acquired a horse\r\n  farm (the Farm) known as â€œBrigadoonâ€ in St. Matthews.Â  The Farm was purchased\r\n  in Wifeâ€™s name only for the stated price of $240,000.Â  The parties separated in\r\n  October 2002.Â  \r\nBy\r\n  order filed April 10, 2006, the family court granted the parties a divorce on\r\n  the ground of one yearâ€™s separation.Â  At trial, only Wife challenged the\r\n  validity of the prenuptial agreement.Â  The court found the prenuptial agreement\r\n  â€œis valid under New York and South Carolina law.â€Â  The court granted Wife the\r\n  Farm (including livestock), finding it was her separate property under the\r\n  terms of the prenuptial agreement, as well as certain personal property.Â \r\n  Husband was also awarded personal property.Â  Husband was ordered to return\r\n  certain jewelry to Wife.Â  To ensure Husbandâ€™s return of the jewelry, Wife was\r\n  authorized to withhold $50,000 from Husbandâ€™s share of an investment account\r\n  with Brown &amp; Company Securities Corporation (the Brown account).Â  The\r\n  account had a balance of just over one million dollars.Â  Husband and Wife were\r\n  ordered to equally divide the balance of the Brown account after an initial\r\n  $50,000 distribution was made to Wife. Â Wifeâ€™s claim for alimony was\r\n  denied, and each party was ordered to pay his or her own attorneyâ€™s fees.Â \r\n  Husband appeals.[1]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  The FarmÂ \r\n  [Husbandâ€™s Issues I, II, IV &amp; VI]\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in awarding the Farm to Wife.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Husband asserts the family court erred in awarding the Farm to Wife based on\r\n  its finding Wife purchased the Farm in her name with proceeds from the sale the\r\n  Connecticut Property, which had been gifted to her.Â  Husband states Wife had no\r\n  tangible assets in her name when they married and the court erred by not\r\n  considering an equitable division of the Farm and livestock because marital\r\n  property, regardless of how title is held, is subject to equitable division.Â \r\n  Husband also asserts the family court erred as a matter of law in failing to\r\n  find the marital estate was to be divided in accordance with the prenuptial\r\n  agreement.Â  \r\nHusband\r\n  argues in the alternative that the family court erred in failing to find the\r\n  Farm was transmuted into marital property because it was utilized by the parties\r\n  in support of the marriage.Â  Husband states his income was used to maintain\r\n  Wife and that Wife â€œnever exercised any independence to demonstrate that she\r\n  intended the marital residence to be non-marital property.â€Â  \r\nHusbandâ€™s\r\n  arguments are foreclosed by the prenuptial agreement, which he did not\r\n  challenge at trial. \r\nArticle\r\n  II of the partiesâ€™ prenuptial agreement, entitled â€œSeparate and Marital\r\n  Property,â€ provides in section three as follows:\r\n\r\n  3.Â  Each of the parties agrees that the property\r\n    described hereafter shall remain the separate property of the other party:\r\n  (a) all property, whether real or personal, belonging\r\n    to or owned by the other party at the time of their marriage, including assets\r\n    acquired by each of them in their separate names while living together outside\r\n    the marital relationship;\r\n  (b)Â  all property acquired by the other party out of\r\n    the proceeds or income from property owned at the time of the marriage, or\r\n    attributable to appreciation in value of said property, whether the enhancement\r\n    is due to market or economic conditions or to the contributions, services,\r\n    skill or efforts of either of the parties to this agreement;\r\n  (c)Â  all property hereafter acquired by the other\r\n    party by gift, devise, bequest or inheritance.Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  \r\n\r\n In\r\n  awarding the Farm to Wife, the family court reasoned the Connecticut Property\r\n  was a gift to her and that the proceeds from the sale of the Connecticut\r\n  Property were used to purchase the Farm in her name only; therefore, the Farm\r\n  remained Wifeâ€™s sole property in accordance with the terms of the prenuptial\r\n  agreement.Â  Â Â \r\nWe\r\n  believe the prenuptial agreement controls the disposition of the Farm.Â \r\n  However, our analysis of the agreement focuses on a different provision than\r\n  the one relied upon by the family court.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR\r\n  (allowing an appellate court to affirm on any ground appearing in the record).Â \r\n  Article II, section four of the agreement specifically provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  4.Â  With respect to any â€œmarital propertyâ€\r\n    that may be acquired or accumulated during the marriage, the parties do hereby\r\n    mutually waive, release and forego any and all rights and claims of every kind,\r\n    nature and description, in and to the property or assets real or personal, of\r\n      or in the name of the other, regardless of its nature, or wheresoever\r\n    situated, and each party shall during his or her lifetime keep and retain sole\r\n    ownership, control and enjoyment of all such property, real or personal, now\r\n    owned or hereafter acquired by him or her, free and clear of any claim by the\r\n    other.Â  This provision is intended to and shall serve as a complete and\r\n    absolute waiver and release by each party to the other of any and all claims\r\n    they may now or hereafter have with respect to the property, real and personal,\r\n    now or hereafter owned by the other.Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  \r\n\r\nThis\r\n  section provides that property â€œacquired or accumulatedâ€ by either party after\r\n  the marriage will remain that partyâ€™s separate property.Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  parties waive any right to property â€œof or in the name of the other.â€Â  Although\r\n  the reasons for Wife having title to the Farm may be disputed, there is no\r\n  question that it is titled solely in her name.Â  Consequently, the application\r\n  of this provision results in Husband waiving any claim to the property and Wife\r\n  retaining it as her own.\r\nThis is\r\n  an unusual provision as it premises the award of property acquired after the\r\n  marriage on title as opposed to any contribution to its acquisition, whether\r\n  financial or otherwise.Â  However, our courts have supported the right of the\r\n  parties to define their property rights by contractual agreement:Â  â€œ[P]arties\r\n  are free to contractually alter the obligations which would otherwise attach to\r\n  marriage.â€Â  Hardee v. Hardee, 355 S.C. 382, 387, 585 S.E.2d 501, 503\r\n  (2003).Â  \r\nIn Hardee, our supreme court cited with approval the\r\n  following test adopted by this court to be used when determining whether a\r\n  prenuptial agreement should be enforced:Â  â€œ(1) Was the agreement obtained\r\n  through fraud, duress, or mistake, or through misrepresentation or\r\n  nondisclosure of material facts?Â  (2) Is the agreement unconscionable?Â  (3)\r\n  Have the facts and circumstances changed since the agreement was executed, so\r\n  as to make its enforcement unfair and unreasonable?â€Â  Id. at 389, 585\r\n  S.E.2d at 504.Â  \r\nIn the\r\n  current appeal, the question of enforceability is not before us.Â  Wife\r\n  questioned the enforceability of the agreement in the family court, but she\r\n  does not appeal the family courtâ€™s finding that the prenuptial agreement is\r\n  valid.Â  Husband has argued only that the family court misinterpreted the\r\n  agreement or did not apply it, but he does not argue that the agreement is\r\n  unenforceable.Â  Consequently, the family courtâ€™s finding that the agreement is\r\n  valid is the law of the case.Â  See, e.g., Dreher v. Dreher, 370\r\n  S.C. 75, 634 S.E.2d 646 (2006) (stating a ruling that is unappealed becomes the\r\n  law of the case and will not be considered further on appeal).\r\nThe\r\n  prenuptial agreement was no doubt intended to protect Husband since he had the\r\n  vast majority of assets coming into the marriage.Â  Nevertheless, the parties\r\n  were aware of the terms of the agreement and made the decision to title the\r\n  Farm solely in Wifeâ€™s name.Â  The award of the Farm to Wife as her separate,\r\n  nonmarital property may not appear equitable, but it is the result called for\r\n  under the prenuptial agreement orchestrated by Husband.Â  As noted, the validity\r\n  of the prenuptial agreement is the law of the case.Â  Thus, in light of the\r\n  plain language of the agreement, we affirm the family courtâ€™s ruling that the\r\n  Farm is the property of Wife.[2]Â  \r\nII.Â  JewelryÂ \r\n  [Husbandâ€™s Issue III]\r\nHusband\r\n  next contends the family court abused its discretion in finding he was in\r\n  possession of some of Wifeâ€™s jewelry.Â  \r\nThere\r\n  is evidence in the record, as outlined by the family court, that Husband had\r\n  access to a locked cabinet where some of Wifeâ€™s jewelry was kept along with her\r\n  United States and British passports.Â  When Wife checked the cabinet to\r\n  retrieve her items, everything was missing.Â  Wifeâ€™s U.S. passport later turned up\r\n  in Husbandâ€™s possession, and he returned it to Wifeâ€™s attorney so she could\r\n  attend her fatherâ€™s funeral.Â  Husband denied that he had removed Wifeâ€™s\r\n  jewelry.Â  The family court found, however, that Husband removed this jewelry\r\n  from the cabinet since he had removed Wifeâ€™s U.S. passport, which was kept in\r\n  the cabinet with the jewelry.Â  \r\nWe hold the evidence supports the family courtâ€™s finding.Â \r\n  Although Husband correctly asserts there was no police report made of a theft,\r\n  we do not think this fact is determinative.Â  If Wife believed the jewelry was\r\n  simply retained by Husband, as opposed to stolen by an unknown third party, she\r\n  might have reasonably believed the issue could be resolved in the divorce\r\n  proceedings.Â  In this case, the family court judge saw and heard the witnesses\r\n  and was in a better position to evaluate their demeanor and to assign weight to\r\n  their credibility.Â  See Strickland v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76,\r\n  82, 650 S.E.2d 465, 469 (2007) (â€œ[A]ppellate courts should be mindful that the\r\n  family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, sits in a better position to\r\n  evaluate credibility and assign comparative weight to the testimony.â€).Â  We\r\n  find no error in the family courtâ€™s determination in this regard.\r\nIII.Â  The\r\n  Brown AccountÂ  [Husbandâ€™s Issue V]\r\nHusband\r\n  contends the family court erred in awarding Wife a $50,000 distribution from\r\n  the Brown account.Â  \r\nIn the motion to alter or amend that Husband submitted to the\r\n  family court, he challenged the $50,000 distribution on the following basis:\r\n\r\n  8.Â  Defendant moves [the family court] to reconsider its finding\r\n    that the defendant should be charged with the $50,000 disbursement from the\r\n    Brown account, since this disbursement was authorized by the court as a\r\n    necessary and proper expenditure for defendantâ€™s needs pendente lite.Â  \r\n\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, however, Husband asserts we should reverse the $50,000 award because it\r\n  was not provided for in the courtâ€™s memorandum of instructions for preparing\r\n  the order.Â  As Husband argues for the first time on appeal, the $50,000 award was\r\n  â€œgratuitouslyâ€ placed in the order by Wifeâ€™s counsel, who drafted the order.Â \r\n  Although we cannot find this provision in the family courtâ€™s instructions, we\r\n  conclude this issue is not properly before us for review.Â  Husband did not make\r\n  the argument in the trial court that he now urges on appeal, and a party cannot\r\n  assert error based on one ground at trial and a different ground on appeal.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley\r\n      &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 344, 479\r\n  S.E.2d 67, 75&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (stating the same ground for an objection\r\n  must be argued to the trial court and on appeal to preserve an alleged error\r\n  for review, and a challenge on a specific ground may not be raised for the\r\n  first time on appeal).\r\nIV.Â  Evidence\r\n  of Prior ConvictionÂ  [Husbandâ€™s Issue VII]\r\nHusband\r\n  lastly contends the family court erred in allowing Wifeâ€™s attorney to question\r\n  him about his conviction for tax evasion.Â  He asserts the evidence was\r\n  inadmissible under Rule 609, SCRE because more than ten years had elapsed since\r\n  the date of his conviction.Â  \r\nRule\r\n  609(a)(2), SCRE provides that for the purpose of attacking the credibility of a\r\n  witness, â€œevidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime shall be\r\n  admitted if it involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.â€Â \r\n  Under Rule 609(b), SCRE, if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since\r\n  the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from confinement,\r\n  whichever is later, evidence of the conviction may not be used â€œunless the\r\n  court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the\r\n  conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially\r\n  outweighs its prejudicial effect.â€Â  Rule 609(b) further requires that advance\r\n  written notice of the intent to use such evidence be given to the other party.Â  Id.\r\nDuring\r\n  Wifeâ€™s direct examination, she testified that she did not know at the time she\r\n  married Husband that he had a prior conviction for tax evasion.Â  She stated she\r\n  did not find out about it until â€œyears later.â€Â  Husbandâ€™s counsel objected,\r\n  arguing they were â€œgoing to try to introduce [evidence] about a conviction that\r\n  is more than [ten] years oldâ€ and â€œ[u]nder [Rule] 609, they canâ€™t do that.â€Â \r\n  Wifeâ€™s counsel stated the information was offered to show that Husband did not\r\n  disclose the information to Wife.Â  The family court overruled the objection\r\n  without comment and no further argument was made by either party.Â  Â Â \r\nDuring Husbandâ€™s direct testimony, Husband asserted that he had\r\n  transferred some property out of his name due in part to â€œincome tax\r\n  problems.â€Â  On cross-examination, Wifeâ€™s counsel asked him about the nature of\r\n  the tax difficulties.Â  Husbandâ€™s counsel did not object to this line of\r\n  questioning, and Husband answered, â€œThe difficulty was the assertion that I\r\n  didnâ€™t pay all my taxes.Â  The outcome was that I was convicted of that.â€Â \r\n  Husband stated he paid a fine and served a sentence of three months in prison.Â  Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Husband summarily contends evidence of his prior conviction was\r\n  admitted in violation of Rule 609 because more than ten years had elapsed since\r\n  the conviction.Â  Convictions more than ten years old may be admitted after the\r\n  court performs a balancing test.Â  Here, the family court did not perform a\r\n  balancing test.Â  No argument was made at trial regarding the prejudicial nature\r\n  of the conviction versus its probative effect.Â  In addition, this passing\r\n  reference was harmless as Husband has demonstrated no prejudice.Â  First, the\r\n  evidence was cumulative, as it came in without objection on another occasion\r\n  via Husbandâ€™s own testimony.Â  Second, the family court noted in its memorandum\r\n  for preparing the order that neither Wife nor Husband were credible witnesses\r\n  and that Husbandâ€™s testimony was â€œoften evasive and misleading.â€Â  Thus, there\r\n  were other inconsistencies in the testimony that caused the family court to\r\n  have concerns about Husbandâ€™s credibility that were unrelated to his tax\r\n  problems.Â  We have carefully reviewed the record, and we find ample support\r\n  (beyond Husbandâ€™s stale conviction for tax evasion) for the family courtâ€™s\r\n  finding that Husbandâ€™s testimony lacked credibility.\r\nAccordingly, we find Husband has not established reversible\r\n  error.Â  See, e.g., Jamison\r\n    v. Ford Motor Co.,&nbsp;373 S.C. 248,\r\n  261, 644 S.E.2d 755, 761&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007) (â€œTo warrant reversal based on\r\n  the admission or exclusion of evidence, the complaining party must prove both the\r\n  error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we conclude (1) the Farm is the property of Wife pursuant to\r\n  the terms of the partiesâ€™ prenuptial agreement; (2) evidence in the record\r\n  supports the family courtâ€™s ruling that Husband retained possession of some of\r\n  Wifeâ€™s jewelry; (3) the issue concerning the $50,000 distribution from the\r\n  Brown account is not preserved for our review; and (4) Husband has shown no\r\n  reversible error in the admission of testimony concerning his prior conviction\r\n  for tax evasion.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Husbandâ€™s appellate counsel did not represent Husband\r\n  at trial.\r\n[2]Â  Because of our disposition of this issue, we\r\n  need not address the other arguments Husband raises regarding the Farm.Â  We\r\n  note, however, that Husbandâ€™s argument regarding transmutation is not preserved\r\n  for appeal as it was raised for the first time, and then only summarily, in\r\n  Husbandâ€™s return to Wifeâ€™s reply to his motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-246","title":"Powell v.

McDow, both of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this domestic action, Carol Ann Hemelt (Mother) appeals various family court\r\n  orders finding her in contempt and changing custody.Â  We affirm in part,\r\n  reverse in part, and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nJames W. Powell\r\n  (Father) and Mother were married on February 7, 1992.Â  One son (Child) was born\r\n  of this marriage.Â  Mother and Father separated on April 16, 1994, and in\r\n  October 1994, Father moved to Houston, Texas, for employment.Â  The couple was\r\n  divorced pursuant to a 1995 North Carolina order.Â  When the marital litigation\r\n  commenced, Child was one year old.Â  Child is now fourteen.\r\nFather\r\n  moved to Texas while the divorce action was pending and traveled to Charlotte by airplane every other weekend to spend three days with Child.Â  In the original\r\n  child custody order, both Mother and Father were found to be fit and proper\r\n  parents, and the court granted primary custody to Mother with liberal\r\n  visitation to Father.Â  Shortly after the issuance of the divorce decree, Mother\r\n  and Child moved to Tega Cay, South Carolina.\r\nIn 2003, Father moved\r\n  before the North Carolina court for modification of the original custody order,\r\n  requesting Child be allowed to fly unaccompanied for weekend and holiday\r\n  visitations.Â  Mother, not present at the modification hearing, previously expressed\r\n  opposition for airplane travel other than for holiday and summer visitation.Â  On\r\n  May 21, 2003, the North Carolina court granted Fatherâ€™s motion for modification\r\n  of visitation on the ground that Child was attending school and the prior\r\n  visitation schedule was no longer feasible.Â  Furthermore, the North Carolina\r\n  court found Child was able to fly unaccompanied for visitation.Â  \r\nOn March 11, 2004, Father filed a complaint in South Carolina seeking visitation in accordance with the North Carolina modification order.Â \r\n  In the alternative, Father sought custody.Â  On May 21, 2004, the family court\r\n  issued a temporary order finding it was in Childâ€™s best interest for Father to\r\n  receive visitation according to the North Carolina order.\r\nIn\r\n  November 2005, the family court, pursuant to contempt proceedings filed by\r\n  Father, issued a temporary/contempt order finding Mother in contempt of the\r\n  previous order because of her willful failure to comply with the visitation\r\n  schedule.Â  The parties eventually reached an agreement, which the family court\r\n  approved by order dated September 22, 2006.\r\nOn\r\n  October 6, 2006, Mother moved to vacate the order approving the partiesâ€™\r\n  agreement, claiming she was under duress at the hearing.Â  On March 9, 2007,\r\n  however, the family court issued a rule to show cause against Mother pursuant\r\n  to a motion by Father and a verified complaint on his behalf seeking\r\n  enforcement of the September 22, 2006 order and other relief.\r\nA\r\n  hearing on Motherâ€™s motion to vacate the September 22, 2006 order took place on\r\n  March 12, 2007.Â  Neither party appeared; however, their respective attorneys\r\n  and the guardian ad litem were present.Â  By order dated May 17, 2007, and filed\r\n  May 23, 2007, the family court dismissed the motion and denied Motherâ€™s request\r\n  for a new trial.Â  Pursuant to Rule 11, SCRCP, the family court also sanctioned\r\n  Mother and assessed fees and costs against her.\r\nOn\r\n  May 17, 2007, the family court held a hearing on the rule to show cause.Â \r\n  Although Mother was served with the rule and other pertinent documents and\r\n  filed a responsive pleading, she did not appear at the hearing.Â  The day\r\n  following the hearing, the family court issued an order in which it found\r\n  Mother in contempt and ordered her to be confined for a period of one year,\r\n  subject to provisions under which she could purge herself of contempt.Â \r\n  Furthermore, although Father did not seek custody in his rule to show\r\n  cause, the family court, pursuant to its emergency protective custody powers,\r\n  ordered the Department of Social Services to take Child into emergency\r\n  protective custody and directed that Child be placed with Father following an\r\n  expedited home study of Fatherâ€™s home.Â  The family court further ordered that\r\n  â€œonce [Mother] is arrested pursuant to this order, . . . [Father] shall be\r\n  granted custody of [Child] regardless of the status of the home study.â€Â  Mother\r\n  subsequently filed unsuccessful motions to stay, vacate, and reconsider this\r\n  order.Â  This appeal followed.[2]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court\r\n  has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624\r\n  S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006). Â â€œThis broad scope of review, however, does not require\r\n  the appellate court to disregard the findings of the family court.â€Â  Wooten\r\n    v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005).Â  Moreover, â€œ[o]ur broad scope of review does not relieve the appealing\r\n  party of the burden of showing the family court committed error.â€Â  Latimer\r\n    v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 380, 602 S.E.2d 32, 34 (2004).Â  The family court abuses its discretion when factual findings\r\n  are without evidentiary support or a ruling is based upon an error of law. Â Smith\r\n    v. Doe, 366 S.C. 469, 474, 623 S.E.2d 370, 372 (2005).Â  Custody decisions\r\n  are left largely to the discretion of the family court.Â  Kisling v. Allison,\r\n  343 S.C. 674, 679, 541 S.E.2d 273, 276 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Jurisdiction\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred in enforcing the modification of visitation by\r\n  the North Carolina court. Â We disagree. Â The South Carolina family court\r\n  modified the original order, as both parties concede it had jurisdiction to do,\r\n  rather than enforce the North Carolina order.\r\nA South Carolina family court of this State has jurisdiction to make a child custody\r\n  determination by initial or modification decree if South Carolina is the home state of the child at the time of\r\n  the commencement of the proceedings.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-788 (1985).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  a South Carolina family court may modify a custody decree of another state if\r\n  the following criteria are met:\r\n\r\n  (1) it\r\n    appears to the court of this state that the court which rendered the decree\r\n    does not now have jurisdiction under jurisdictional prerequisites substantially\r\n    in accordance with this subarticle or has declined to assume jurisdiction to\r\n    modify the decree and (2) the court of this state has jurisdiction.Â  \r\n\r\nId. Â§ 20-7-810.Â \r\n  Here, South Carolina meets the jurisdictional requirements for modification because\r\n  Child lived in South Carolina when Father filed his complaint and North Carolina no longer retained continuing jurisdiction. Â \r\nWe\r\n  need not address whether North Carolina had jurisdiction to modify the original\r\n  visitation order because South Carolina had jurisdiction in 2004 to make a\r\n  modification.Â  Although the South Carolina orders refer to the North Carolina order, Fatherâ€™s complaint filed in South Carolina sought only modification\r\n  of visitation, not enforcement of the prior North Carolina order.Â \r\n  Subsequently, in modifying the visitation schedule, the South Carolina family\r\n  court chose to use the same visitation schedule as set forth in the North Carolina order.Â  Furthermore, the South Carolina family court made its own finding that\r\n  â€œthe visitation schedule is reasonable and in the minorâ€™s child best\r\n  interests.â€\r\nII.Â  Service by Certified Mail\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred in permitting Father to serve an amended\r\n  complaint and rule to show cause by certified mail.[3]Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nAfter the Father\r\n  served his complaint, Mother filed a motion seeking a more definite statement.Â \r\n  At the hearing on this motion, which the family court ultimately granted,\r\n  Mother agreed to accept service of the amended complaint and rule to show cause\r\n  by certified mail.Â  The order granting Motherâ€™s motion reflects such an\r\n  agreement.Â  On appeal, Mother now argues service was improper under Rule 4,\r\n  SCRCP.Â  Because, however, Mother consented to service by certified mail, such\r\n  service was valid and cannot be attacked on appeal.Â  See Johnson v. Johnson,\r\n  310 S.C. 44, 46-47, 425 S.E.2d 46, 48 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œOrdinarily, where a\r\n  judgment or order is entered by consent, it is binding and conclusive and\r\n  cannot be attacked by the parties either by direct appeal or in a collateral\r\n  proceeding.â€). \r\nIII.Â  Notice\r\nMother contends the\r\n  family court abused its discretion in denying her motion to set aside the November\r\n  2005 temporary/contempt order because no evidence to supports a finding that she\r\n  received notice of Fatherâ€™s amended complaint and rule to show cause.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nA party seeking to\r\n  set aside a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, has the burden of\r\n  presenting evidence entitling him to the requested relief. Lanier v. Lanier,\r\n  364 S.C. 211, 215, 612 S.E.2d 456, 458&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) cert. denied,\r\n  Sept. 20, 2006.Â  â€œThe decision to grant or deny a motion\r\n  under Rule 60(b) is within the sound discretion of the trial court.â€ Â Bowman\r\n    v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 151, 591 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2004); see\r\n      also Saro Invs. v. Ocean Holiday Pâ€™ship., 314 S.C. 116, 124, 441\r\n  S.E.2d 835, 840 (Ct. App. 1994) (noting that Rule 60(b) motions are addressed\r\n  to the discretion of the court and appellate review is limited to determining\r\n  whether the trial court abused its discretion).Â  Review is thus limited to determining\r\n  whether the family court abused its discretion in granting or denying the\r\n  motion.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe record shows Mother\r\n  consented to receiving the amended complaint and rule to show cause by\r\n  certified mail.Â  In denying Motherâ€™s motion to set aside the November 3, 2005\r\n  order, the family court stated, â€œ[Mother] also admitted that she would have not\r\n  complied with the temporary order/order for contempt issues by the [family\r\n  court] on November 3, 2005, had she been present at the hearing and the court\r\n  rules similarly because she believed the order of May 21, 2004, to be an\r\n  illegal one.â€Â  The family court also found the pleadings were properly sent by\r\n  certified mail, but Mother did not claim them.[4]Â \r\n  Because the family court saw and heard Mother and was in a better position to\r\n  evaluate whether her explanation that she never received the pleadings was\r\n  credible, we hold it did not abuse its discretion in denying Motherâ€™s motion to\r\n  set aside the November 3, 2005 order.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nIV.Â  Rule 205, SCACR\r\nMother maintains\r\n  the family court violated Rule 205, SCACR, by entering a final order on\r\n  September 22, 2006.Â  Specifically, Mother maintains the order was void because her\r\n  first notice of appeal to this Court divested the family court of jurisdiction\r\n  to enter further orders.Â  Mother also contends the family court erred in\r\n  denying her motion to set aside the order because the family court had been\r\n  divested of jurisdiction, thus rendering the order void.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, the\r\n  service of a notice of appeal automatically stay matters affected by the appeal\r\n  and the stay continues in effect for the duration of the appeal.Â  Rule 225(a),\r\n  SCACR.Â  Family court orders involving a child, however, are not automatically stayed.Â \r\n  Rule 225, SCACR(b)(6); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-2220 (1985 and Supp. 2007).Â  Because\r\n  the September 22, 2006 order involved a child, the family court retained\r\n  jurisdiction to enter it.Â  \r\nV.Â  Changed Circumstances\r\nMother alleges\r\n  there was no evidence of changed circumstances to warrant the order of September\r\n  22, 2006 modifying child custody.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  the absence of a change of circumstances affecting the welfare of a child, a\r\n  final decree of divorce awarding custody in accordance with an agreement of the\r\n  parties is conclusive between them.â€Â  Pitt v. Olds, 333 S.C. 478, 481,\r\n  511 S.E.2d 60, 61 (1999).Â  â€œIn order for a court to modify an existing custody\r\n  decree, there must be a showing of changed circumstances occurring after the\r\n  entry of the decree.â€Â  Id.\r\n When Mother and\r\n  Father divorced in 1995, Child was two years old and not attending school.Â \r\n  When Father first sought modification of the visitation, Child was nine years\r\n  old and attending school.Â  As a result, many of the provisions in the original custody\r\n  order could no longer be implemented.Â  For example, the initial visitation\r\n  schedule permitted Father to one extended week per month, totaling nine\r\n  straight days.Â  Such a schedule is patently unworkable for a school-aged\r\n  child.Â  Under these circumstances, we hold the family court did not err in\r\n  modifying the original custody decree.Â \r\nÂ VI.Â  Motion to set aside the September 22, 2006 order\r\nMother contends the family court abused its discretion\r\n  in denying her motion to set aside the September 22, 2006 order.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Mother maintains she was under duress at the time of the final hearing when she\r\n  and Father reached a settlement regarding Childâ€™s visitation.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  party seeking to set aside a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, has the\r\n  burden of presenting evidence entitling him to the requested relief.â€Â  Lanier,\r\n  364 S.C. at 215, 612 S.E.2d at 458.Â  â€œThe decision to grant or deny a motion\r\n  under Rule 60(b) is within the sound discretion of the trial court.â€ Id. at 215-16, 612 S.E.2d at 458.Â  â€œReview is thus limited to determining whether\r\n  the family court abused its discretion in granting or denying the motion.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere, Mother\r\n  maintains she was under duress at the time of the hearing because she believed\r\n  if she did not agree to the terms in of the settlement she would be incarcerated.Â \r\n  According to Mother, this â€œduress contributed to and in fact forced her into\r\n  the agreement.â€Â  During the hearing, however, Mother testified she understood\r\n  the terms of the agreement and had not been forced, threatened, or coerced to\r\n  enter into the agreement.Â  Accordingly, we hold the family court did not abuse\r\n  its discretion in denying the motion to set aside the September 22, 2006\r\n  order.Â  \r\nVII.Â \r\n  Rule 11, SCRCP \r\nNext,\r\n  Mother argues the family court erred in imposing sanctions pursuant to Rule 11,\r\n  SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  court imposing sanctions under Rule 11 should, in its order, describe the\r\n  conduct determined to constitute a violation of the Rule and explain the basis\r\n  for the sanction imposed.â€Â  Runyon v. Wright, 322 S.C. 15, 19, 471\r\n  S.E.2d 160, 162 (1996).Â  â€œThe imposition of sanctions, however, will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion by the lower court.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion may be found if the conclusions reached are without\r\n  reasonable factual support.â€Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  Mother moved to set aside the final order or in the alternative for a new\r\n  trial.Â  In her motion, Mother maintained the final order should be set aside\r\n  because she was under duress at when she consented to its terms.Â  Because of\r\n  these allegations, the family court found a hearing was necessary; however,\r\n  Mother failed to appear at the hearing to testify in her defense.Â \r\n  Subsequently, the family court sanctioned Mother pursuant to Rule 11, SCRCP,\r\n  stating as follows:\r\n\r\n  [Mother]\r\n    never intended to abide by the terms of the agreement approved in the final\r\n    order.Â  She deliberately misled if not lied to and presented perjured testimony\r\n    to the court at the time of the final hearing.Â  [These] actions were designed\r\n    to thwart the ability of the court to impose an order.Â  This motion is a continuation\r\n    of [Motherâ€™s] deliberate acts to keep the court from exercising authority over\r\n    her and enforcing its orders . . . [Motherâ€™s] failure to appear at this hearing\r\n    confirms that [Mother] filed this motion to thwart the courtâ€™s authority over\r\n    her.\r\n\r\nWe agree with the family\r\n  court that Motherâ€™s failure to appear at the hearing and provide evidence of\r\n  the duress she alleges prompted her to agree to the terms of the September 22,\r\n  2006 order warranted sanctions under Rule 11, SCRCP.Â  Without such evidence, it\r\n  was reasonable for the family court to conclude that Motherâ€™s claim was\r\n  â€œwithout good ground to support itâ€ and was â€œinterposed for delay.â€Â  Rule\r\n  11(a), SCRCP.\r\nVIII.Â \r\n  Contempt\r\nMother\r\n  contends the family courtâ€™s November 3, 2005 contempt order is void for lack of\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction because an appeal was filed with this Court. We\r\n  disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  we have stated earlier in this opinion, family court orders involving a child\r\n  are not automatically stayed.Â  Rule 225, SCACR(b)(6); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-2220 (1985 and Supp. 2007).Â  Thus, the family court had jurisdiction to\r\n  enter an order of contempt.Â  \r\nâ€œA\r\n  determination of contempt lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.â€\r\n  Â Smith v. Smith, 359 S.C. 393, 396, 597 S.E.2d 188, 189 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n  Â An appellate court should reverse a finding of contempt only when such a\r\n  finding is without evidentiary support. Â Id. at 396, 597 S.E.2d at 189. Â â€œ[C]ontempt is an extreme measure and the power to adjudge a\r\n  person in contempt is not to be lightly asserted.Â  State v. Bevilacqua,\r\n  316 S.C. 122, 128, 447 S.E.2d 213, 216 (Ct. App. 1994). Â \r\nâ€œ[C]ontempt\r\n  results from the willful disobedience of a court order.â€ Â Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck\r\n    Stop, Inc. v. Cloyd, 350 S.C. 596, 607, 567 S.E.2d 514, 519 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002). Â â€œFor purposes of contempt, an act is willful\r\n  if â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something\r\n  the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law\r\n  requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or\r\n  disregard the law.â€™ â€ Bartlett v. Rachels, 375 S.C. 348,\r\n  352, 652 S.E.2d 432, 435 (Ct. App. 2007) (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874\r\n  (1988). \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  language of the commands must be clear and certain rather than impliedâ€ in\r\n  order to support a finding of contempt for violation of a court order. Â Welchel\r\n    v. Boyter, 260 S.C. 418, 421, 196 S.E.2d 496, 498 (1973). Â â€œBefore a person\r\n  may be held in contempt for violating a court order, the order should inform\r\n  him in definite terms as to the duties thereby imposed upon him, and the\r\n  mandate alleged to be violated must be clearly expressed rather than implied.â€ Â 17\r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Contempt Â§ 157 (1990) (quoted in Am. Fed. Bank,\r\n    FSB v. Kateman, 335 S.C. 273, 277, 516 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 1999)).\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the family court found Mother in contempt for failing to\r\n  comply with the modified visitation schedule.Â  The family court stated,\r\n  â€œ[Mother] has indicated that she had no intent to comply with the terms of the\r\n  agreement set forth in that final order at the time she entered into the\r\n  agreement and has no present intent to comply with the terms . . . [Motherâ€™s]\r\n  disobedience . . . is willful, intentional, and deliberate.â€Â  The final order\r\n  clearly set forth the terms of the modified visitation schedule. Â Accordingly,\r\n  the family court did not abuse its discretion in finding Mother in contempt.Â  \r\nIX.Â \r\n  Emergency Protective Custody\r\nMother maintains the family court abused its\r\n  discretion by entering an emergency protective custody order and erred in\r\n  denying her motion to vacate the order after the proper procedures were not\r\n  followed.\r\nThe family court may issue an ex parte Â order\r\n  requiring the Department of Social Services to take a child into emergency\r\n  protective custody without the consent of parents if the family court\r\n  determines â€œthere is probable cause to believe that by reason of abuse or\r\n  neglect there exists an imminent and substantial danger to the childâ€™s life,\r\n  health, or physical safety; and parents, guardians, or others exercising\r\n  temporary or permanent control over the child are unavailable or do not consent\r\n  to the childâ€™s removal from their custody.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-610(P)\r\n  (Supp. 2007). \r\nThe General\r\n  Assembly has provided strict timelines for hearings on the removal of children.\r\n  â€œThe family court shall schedule a probable cause hearing to be held within\r\n  seventy-two hours of the time the child was taken into emergency protective custody.â€Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-610(M) (Supp. 2007).Â  In addition, the merits hearing â€œto determine whether\r\n  removal of custody is needed . . . must be held within thirty-five days of the\r\n  date of receipt of the removal petition.â€ Id.Â  A continuance may be\r\n  granted for exceptional circumstances, however, â€œthe hearing on the merits must\r\n  be completed within sixty-five days following receipt of the removal petitionâ€\r\n  if a continuance is granted.Â  Id.Â  Section 20-7-736 also provides that\r\n  the family court shall â€œschedule a hearing to be held within thirty-five daysâ€\r\n  of the date of receipt of the removal petition.Â  Id. Â§ 20-7-736(E).\r\nHere,\r\n  the family court found â€œ[t]here is probable cause to believe the actions of\r\n  [Mother] constitute abuse of the child and that there exists imminent and\r\n  substantial danger to the childâ€™s health.â€Â  Furthermore, the family court found\r\n  if Child remained in Motherâ€™s custody, his emotional well-being would be in\r\n  danger.Â  Accordingly, we uphold the family courtâ€™s order to have Child taken into\r\nemergency protective custody.Â  \r\nThere is no indication in the record, however, that\r\n  the family court complied with statutory timelines after the Department of\r\n  Social Services took protective custody of Child.Â  Instead, the family court\r\n  ordered an expedited home study of Fatherâ€™s home, but also granted custody to\r\n  Father regardless of the status of the investigation.Â  Moreover, at this point\r\n  in time, we have no information as whether the home study has even been\r\n  performed, let alone whether such a study would support a finding that Childâ€™s\r\n  best interests would be served by placing him with Father.Â  Although Motherâ€™s\r\n  conduct during this litigation may have been valid reason for the family court\r\n  to have Child placed in emergency protective custody, we are troubled by the\r\n  courtâ€™s apparent disregard of statutorily mandated procedures and deadlines\r\n  that follow such extraordinary measures.Â  \r\nBecause,\r\n  however, Child has, as best we can determine, been residing with Father during\r\n  the pendency of this appeal, this Court will not, based on the facts before us,\r\n  disturb his current placement.Â  Nevertheless, we reverse the provision of the\r\n  family court order granting custody of Child to Father â€œregardless of the\r\n  status of the home studyâ€ and remand the matter to the family court for\r\n  completion of the home study and findings of fact as to Childâ€™s best interest\r\n  concerning custody and visitation.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, THOMAS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â This Court consolidated Motherâ€™s three separate\r\n  appeals and expedited her appeal because it involved child custody.Â  \r\n[3]Â  The rule to show cause at issue here was the one\r\n  disposed of in the November 2005 order.Â  \r\n[4] Â Under Rule 4(d)(8), SCRCP, â€œif delivery [of\r\n  certified mail] is refused or is returned undelivered, service shall be made as\r\n  otherwise provided by these rules.â€Â  Nothing in the record indicates any\r\n  attempt of an alternative method of service.Â  Because, however, the focus of\r\n  Rule 4 is service of the initial summons and complaint, we hold the present\r\n  controversy is governed by Rule 5, SCRCP, under which service of pleadings\r\n  subsequent to the original summons and complaint can be accomplished by mailing\r\n  the papers to the party to be served and, when effected in that manner, â€œis\r\n  complete upon mailing.â€Â  Rule 5(b)(1), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
