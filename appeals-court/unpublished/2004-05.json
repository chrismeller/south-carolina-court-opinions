Hathaway Construction, Inc. brought this action against David \r\n  Eli, a/k/a David Eliyahu, Rebecca Shirley, David L. Shirley, and the Shirley \r\n  Family Limited Partnership to foreclose on a mechanicâ€™s lien and for breach \r\n  of contract seeking to recover money owed for the construction of a building \r\n  on land Eli leased from the Shirleys.Â  The Master-In-Equity awarded Hathaway \r\n  a judgment on its breach of contract claim, determined the total debt on the \r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien, including a set-off in favor of Eli as a result of a leak, \r\n  and ordered the foreclosure of the lien.Â  The master also awarded Hathaway attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nIn March \r\n  of 2000, Hathaway and Eli entered into a verbal contract for the construction \r\n  of a building on land leased from the Shirleys.Â  The building was to be used \r\n  by Eli for selling beach merchandise.Â  The parties agreed Eli was to pay cost \r\n  plus fifteen percent.Â  \r\nThe original \r\n  plan for the building called for the installation of a glass panel front to \r\n  the building.Â  After construction began, Eli requested a change to the shape \r\n  of the front of the building by adding more glass and an angled front.Â  Hathaway \r\n  used a Kawneer prefabricated system for the front of the building.Â  \r\nEli made \r\n  a portion of the payments required under the verbal contract.Â  However, he eventually \r\n  stopped making payments and Hathaway ceased work on the building.Â  On August \r\n  31, 2000, Hathaway received a certificate of occupancy for the building, and \r\n  no further work was completed on the building.Â  \r\nHathaway filed an Affidavit of Mechanicâ€™s \r\n  Lien against the real property and the â€œowners of the fee simple estate.â€Â  The \r\n  notice of mechanicâ€™s lien made no mention of the leasehold interest.Â  On November \r\n  9, 2000, Hathaway filed the current action, seeking to foreclose on the mechanics \r\n  lien and also seeking damages for breach of contract.Â  The Shirleys answered \r\n  and cross-claimed against Eli for indemnification. Â In his answer, Eli asserted \r\n  he was entitled to a setoff for the leaking glass front.Â  He also counterclaimed \r\n  for damages suffered by the construction deficiencies.Â  \r\nThe Master granted \r\n  Eli a $20,000 set-off for Eli â€œto repair the roof that has a leak.â€ Â He held \r\n  Hathaway was entitled to a judgment of $243,705.24 and ordered foreclosure of \r\n  the leasehold interest.Â  \r\nEli filed a motion for reconsideration.Â  \r\n  In it he alleged the court erred in concluding Hathaway had a valid mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien against the leasehold interest where the lien failed to mention the leasehold \r\n  and only mentioned the fee simple interest.Â  Eli also alleged the court erred: \r\n  1) in enforcing the foreclosure against Eliâ€™s wife because she was never made \r\n  a party to the action; 2) in awarding penalties and interest to Hathaway based \r\n  upon subcontractors not being paid; 3) in awarding prejudgment interest; 4) \r\n  in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees under the contract; 5) in awarding one half of the \r\n  accountantâ€™s fee; 6) in determining the amount of the setoff to which Eli was \r\n  entitled; and (7) in including certain sums in the total debt secured by the \r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  \r\nThe Master filed \r\n  an Amended Final Order in which he reaffirmed his previous order, but changed \r\n  some of the amounts.Â  He held the total debt secured by the mechanicâ€™s lien \r\n  was $201,752.69, which included $183,626.41 as the contract balance, prejudgment \r\n  interest, attorneyâ€™s fees, court fees and the setoff in favor of Eli in the \r\n  amount of $20,000.00.Â  The master also held Hathaway was entitled to a judgment \r\n  in the amount of $239,128.59, which included the above total debt plus half \r\n  of the accountantâ€™s fee equaling $6,352.50 and penalties and interest charged \r\n  by subcontractors equaling $31,023.40.Â  Although the attorneyâ€™s fees are included \r\n  in the calculation of the mechanicâ€™s lien, the order states the master awarded \r\n  the attorneyâ€™s fees â€œunder the terms of the contract.â€Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n\r\nThe foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien \r\n  is an action at law.Â  T.W. Morton Builders, Inc. v. von Buedingen, 316 \r\n  S.C. 388, 397, 450 S.E.2d 87, 92 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  An action for breach of contract \r\n  seeking money damages is also an action at law.Â  Sterling Dev. Co. v. Collins, \r\n  309 S.C. 237, 240, 421 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1992).Â  In an action at law, tried without \r\n  a jury, the masterâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless \r\n  found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the Masterâ€™s findings.Â  \r\n  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d \r\n  773, 775 (1976).\r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Validity \r\n    of the Foreclosure \r\n\r\nEli argues the Master erred in foreclosing \r\n  on the leasehold interest pursuant to the mechanicâ€™s lien because the mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien did not mention the leasehold interest.Â  Additionally, he asserts the mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien only referenced the owners of the fee simple interest, the Shirleys, and \r\n  not the owners of the leasehold interest, which was foreclosed.Â  We find Eli \r\n  failed to preserve this issue.\r\nThe mechanicâ€™s lien statute requires \r\n  the lien to include â€œa description of the property intended to be covered by \r\n  the lien sufficiently accurate for identification, with the name of the owner \r\n  of the property . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-90 (Supp. 2003).Â  The lien in this \r\n  case did list the owner of the property, but failed to list the owner of the \r\n  leasehold interest.Â  However, in the complaint, under the cause of action to \r\n  foreclose on mechanicâ€™s lien, Hathaway noted the Shirleys had leased the property \r\n  to Eli and requested a judgment against the â€œDefendantsâ€ which include Eli.Â  \r\n  Additionally, the complaint indicated that any deficiency judgment, if necessary, \r\n  should be against the â€œDefendantsâ€ including Eli.Â  During an earlier arbitration \r\n  hearing, counsel for Hathaway stated that the action was â€œunder the mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien statute as a mechanicâ€™s lien foreclosure of a leasehold interest.â€Â  There \r\n  is no indication in the record that Eli objected to the statement.Â  Finally, \r\n  at the beginning of trial, the court and counsel had discussions regarding the \r\n  fact Hathaway was proceeding to foreclose the leasehold interest.Â  Eli made \r\n  no objection at that time.Â  Later in the trial, Eliâ€™s counsel stipulated that \r\n  â€œthe mechanicâ€™s lien was filed timely and in compliance with the statute, and \r\n  the summons and complaint were filed timely and in compliance with the statute.â€Â  \r\n  Again, Eli raised no objection to the court proceeding as a foreclosure against \r\n  the leasehold interest.\r\nWe find Eli should have raised the \r\n  objection to the form of the mechanicâ€™s lien at the earliest opportunity and \r\n  not during a motion to alter or amend the judgment after the case had been tried.Â  \r\n  See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œA party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of \r\n  a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.â€).Â  As such, we find \r\n  Eli waived his right to contest the form of the mechanicâ€™s lien.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Foreclosure \r\n  on Dalya Eliyahuâ€™s Leasehold Interest\r\nEli contends \r\n  the master erred in foreclosing the leasehold interest because Mrs. Eliyahu \r\n  was never made a party to the action.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe purpose \r\n  of a notice of pendency of an action is to inform a purchaser or encumbrancer \r\n  that a particular piece of real property is subject to litigation.Â  Pond \r\n  Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 16, 567 S.E.2d 881, 889 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002).Â  The lis pendens statute provides:\r\n \r\n  \r\n    From the time of filing only, \r\n      the pendency of the action shall be constructive notice to a purchaser or \r\n      encumbrancer of the property affected thereby, and every person whose \r\n      conveyance or encumbrance is subsequently executed or subsequently recorded \r\n      shall be deemed a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer and shall be bound \r\n      by all proceedings taken after the filing of such notice to the same extent \r\n      as if he were made a party to the action.Â  For the purposes of this \r\n      section, an action shall be deemed to be pending from the time of filing \r\n      such notice.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-11-20 (1976) (emphasis added).\r\nThus, \r\n  when a notice of pendency is filed, a purchaser or encumbrancer is charged with \r\n  constructive notice of litigation if his conveyance or encumbrance is subsequently \r\n  executed or recorded.Â  MI Co., Ltd. v. McLean, 325 S.C. 616, 626, 482 \r\n  S.E.2d 597, 602 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œA properly filed lis pendens binds subsequent \r\n  purchasers or encumbrancers to all proceedings evolving from the litigation.â€Â  \r\n  South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank v. Cook, 291 S.C. 530, 532, 354 S.E.2d 562, \r\n  562 (1987).\r\nThe mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien in this case was filed on October 24, 2000.Â  The lis pendens was filed \r\n  November 9, 2000.Â  At the time, there was nothing filed with the Horry County \r\n  Register of Deeds to indicate that Mrs. Eliyahu was a party to the lease.Â  Eli \r\n  and Mrs. Eliyahu subsequently filed a Memorandum of Lease with the RMC office \r\n  on December 29, 2000.Â  As Mrs. EliyahuÂ  failed to file the Memorandum of Lease \r\n  until after the filing of the lis pendens, she is bound by the proceedings taken \r\n  after the filing of such notice to the same extent as if she had been made a \r\n  party to the action.Â  Accordingly, we find the master did not err in foreclosing \r\n  Mrs. Eliyahuâ€™s leasehold interest in the property.Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Setoff\r\nEli contends the master erred in \r\n  awarding only a $20,000.00 setoff against the amount Hathaway was entitled to \r\n  collect.Â  He contends the master failed to make specific findings of fact to \r\n  support the amount.Â  We agree and believe the issue should be remanded to the \r\n  master for a determination of the amount of the setoff and for specific findings \r\n  of fact in support of the amount.\r\nIn the Amended Final Order the master \r\n  awarded a $20,000.00 setoff in favor of Eli.Â  The master stated:\r\n \r\n  \r\n    The Court finds that the Defendant, \r\n      David Eli, answered and further counter claims and sets off for approximately \r\n      [$300,000.00] against the Plaintiff.Â  This Court finds after considering \r\n      all of the evidence presented by David Eli, that most of the evidence is \r\n      not credible.Â  However, the Court does find for the Defendant, David Eli, \r\n      and will allow the Defendant, David Eli, the set off in the amount of [$20,000.00] \r\n      to repair the roof that has a leak.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWe agree that a setoff is appropriate \r\n  given the fact that even Hathaway acknowledges the construction is not complete \r\n  and a leak has occurred in the building.Â  However, the Master made no finding \r\n  of fact stating how he reached a figure of $20,000.00 for the setoff.Â  We are \r\n  unable to derive the basis for the figure from the record on appeal.Â  As such, \r\n  we remand to the master for specific finding regarding the basis for the amount \r\n  of the setoff to which Eli is entitled.Â  See Timothy C. Doughtie Adver., \r\n  Inc. v. Nelsen Steel &amp; Wire Co., Inc., 284 S.C. 27, 30, 324 S.E.2d 329, \r\n  331 (Ct. App. 1984) (case remanded where trial court failed to set forth specific \r\n  findings of fact and Court of Appeals was unable to determine whether the order \r\n  was controlled by an error of law).Â  \r\nIV.Â Â Â  Accountantâ€™s \r\n  Fee\r\nEli argues the master erred in requiring \r\n  him to pay one half of the accountantâ€™s fee.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe master found the parties entered \r\n  into an agreement that each party would pay for one half of the fee for Marshall \r\n  Wells, a CPA brought in to examine Hathawayâ€™s records.Â  During trial, Lynn Slocum, \r\n  an employee of Hathaway, testified she was involved in meetings in which Eli \r\n  requested that an independent CPA audit the account.Â  She also stated that Eli \r\n  agreed to pay one half of the fee for the audit.Â  Mr. Wells testified that Floyd \r\n  Hathaway, the owner of Hathaway, told him that his fee would be split between \r\n  Hathaway and Eli.Â  Finally, Lisa Liebowitz, an employee of Eli, testified that \r\n  Eli and Floyd Hathaway had a meeting to discuss the account.Â  She testified, \r\n  â€œDavid called me, say[ing], â€˜Would you â€“ you know, are you willing to work with \r\n  someone we hire together, with [Hathaway] . . .â€™â€Â  \r\nBased \r\n  upon our limited standard of review, we find there was evidence in the record \r\n  to support the masterâ€™s finding that Eli agreed to hire Wells and to pay one \r\n  half of his fee for the audit of the account at Hathaway.\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Subcontractorâ€™s Penalties \r\n  and Interest\r\nEli contends the master erred in \r\n  awarding Hathaway the penalties and interest resulting from Hathawayâ€™s failure \r\n  to pay subcontractors.Â  We disagree and find the penalties and interest resulted \r\n  from Eliâ€™s failure to pay according to the contract and are therefore a cost \r\n  incurred by Hathaway.\r\nAt trial, Slocum testified that Hathaway \r\n  incurred approximately $32,000.00 in fees, interest, penalties, and costs as \r\n  a result of Eliâ€™s failure to pay when requested.Â  The record includes many notices \r\n  of interest charges or late fees by Hathawayâ€™s subcontractors.Â  \r\nThe master determined the penalties \r\n  and interest were the direct result of the breach by Eli.Â  As such, he awarded \r\n  $31,023.40 to Hathaway under the breach of contract claim.Â  â€œDamages recoverable \r\n  for breach of contract either must flow as a natural consequence of the breach \r\n  or must have been reasonably within the partiesâ€™ contemplation at the time of \r\n  the contract.â€Â  Manning v. City of Columbia, 297 S.C. 451, 455, 377 S.E.2d \r\n  335, 337 (1989).Â  We find there was testimony and evidence to support the masterâ€™s \r\n  decision that the penalties and interest were the direct result of the breach \r\n  by Eli, and therefore, are recoverable under the breach of contract cause of \r\n  action.\r\nVI.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nFinally, Eli contends the master \r\n  erred in awarding Hathaway attorneyâ€™s fees under the contract.Â  He claims there \r\n  was no evidence the contract allowed for the collection of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n  Hathaway contends it should be able to recover attorneyâ€™s fees under the mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien statute and the award should be affirmed.Â  We believe the issue should \r\n  be remanded for a determination by the master as to the amount of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees due under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute.\r\nIt is well established in South Carolina \r\n  that â€œ[a]ttorneyâ€™s fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or \r\n  statute.â€Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 307, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759 (1997).Â  \r\n  In this case, there is no evidence in the record indicating attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  were contemplated by the contract.Â  Therefore, the master erred in awarding \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees to Hathaway under the contract.\r\nThe mechanicâ€™s lien statute, however, \r\n  specifically authorizes the collection of attorneyâ€™s fees by the prevailing \r\n  party.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(a) (Supp. 2003).Â  While the master stated during \r\n  the hearing on Eliâ€™s motion to alter or amend that he was awarding the fees \r\n  under the statute, his final order stated the fees were pursuant to the contract.Â  \r\n  The master did not examine Hathawayâ€™s right to attorneyâ€™s fees under the statute, \r\n  and therefore, we remand for consideration of the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  to which Hathaway is entitled under section 29-5-10(a).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Eli waived \r\n  his right to complain of the form of the mechanicâ€™s lien by not objecting at \r\n  the earliest possible opportunity.Â  Additionally, we find Mrs. Eliyahu is bound \r\n  by the proceedings as the Memorandum of Lease was filed subsequent to the filing \r\n  of the lis pendens.Â  We find the master correctly included in the judgment amount \r\n  one half of the fee for the accountant and the penalties and interest charged \r\n  by Hathawayâ€™s shareholders. Â Accordingly, the decisions by the master on these \r\n  issues are affirmed.Â  We find the master failed to make specific findings of \r\n  fact regarding the amount of the setoff to which Eli is entitled.Â  Additionally, \r\n  the master erred in awarding the attorneyâ€™s fees under the contract and not \r\n  under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute.Â  As such, these two issues are reversed and \r\n  remanded to the master for further consideration.Â  Therefore, the order of the \r\n  master is \r\nAFFIRMED \r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ. and CURETON, \r\n  A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-290","title":"State v.

Dept. of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services, \r\n          all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Quasay Yusas \r\n  Thomas appeals the revocation of his probation.Â  We affirm.\r\nThomas pled guilty on April 25, 2002 \r\n  to contributing to the delinquency of a minor.Â  He had been indicted for criminal \r\n  sexual conduct with a minor, second degree.Â  The plea court sentenced him to \r\n  a three-year term of imprisonment, but suspended the sentence upon his service \r\n  of six months imprisonment or the payment of a three-hundred-dollar fine and \r\n  the service of two-years probation. \r\nTwelve months later, following the \r\n  issuance of a probation citation charging Thomas with violating the terms of \r\n  his probation, the sentencing court conducted a hearing on May 15, 2003 and \r\n  revoked his probation in full.Â  The probation citation cited Thomas, inter \r\n  alia, with failing to report in December, January, and February to his \r\n  probation officer as instructed, testing positive for marijuana on March 25, \r\n  2003 for the third time, and failing to pay a court-ordered fine and a supervision \r\n  fee, all in violation of the conditions of his probation.Â  With particular reference \r\n  to his using marijuana, Thomas stated in response to a question from the sentencing \r\n  court as to whether he could pass a drug test, â€œWell, sir, I havenâ€™t smoked \r\n  any marijuana in a month.â€Â  Among the standard conditions of Thomasâ€™ probation, \r\n  which the sentencing court found he violated, was the condition that requires \r\n  a probationer to â€œrefrain from the violations of any state or federal penal \r\n  laws.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-430(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nWe decide this case without oral \r\n  argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR, and affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), \r\n  SCACR, because the challenge leveled by Thomas at the revocation of his probation \r\n  is manifestly without merit. See State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, \r\n  647, 511 S.E.2d 94, 96 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding the decision to revoke probation \r\n  is committed to the discretion of the sentencing court and the review of the \r\n  court of appeals is limited to correcting errors of law unless the lack of a \r\n  legal or factual basis indicated the sentencing judge acted arbitrarily or capriciously); \r\n  Barlet v. State, 288 S.C. 481, 483, 343 S.E.2d 620, 622 (1986) (â€œProbation \r\n  may not be revoked solely on the ground the probationer failed to pay \r\n  fines or to make restitution.â€); 24 C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§1561, at 154 \r\n  (1989) (â€œA violation of the terms, or even one of the terms, of probation is \r\n  sufficient ground for revocationâ€ and â€œ[a] judge may revoke probation when reasonably \r\n  satisfied that a state . . . law has been violated, and conviction is not essentialâ€); \r\n  S.C.

Code Ann.

Brown and John W. Davidson, \r\n  both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nR. Davis Howser, George V. Hanna, IV and Andrew E. Haselden, \r\n  all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this dispute relating to \r\n  the construction of a freezer facility, Appellant LaM Distribution (LaM) contends \r\n  the trial court erred in concluding Respondent Vaughn Coltrane &amp; Associates \r\n  (VCA) had not breached its contract with LaM and in discounting the award of \r\n  damages to LaM for fees not paid to VCA.Â  We reverse. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 30, 1998, LaM secured a building permit \r\n  for a $6,500,000.00 refrigerated warehouse facility to be constructed in Calhoun \r\n  County, South Carolina.Â  Employing temperatures as low as -25 degrees Fahrenheit, \r\n  the facility freezes and stores food products and other perishables.Â  To design \r\n  and manage construction of the facility, LaM contracted for the services of \r\n  VCA, a consulting engineering firm specializing in food industry services.Â  \r\n  The agreement between the parties contained the following clause:\r\n\r\n3.Â  VCA will be responsible for exercising the degree of skill \r\n  and care required by customarily accepted, good professional engineering practices \r\n  and procedures.\r\n\r\nConstruction of the facility took longer than planned.Â  \r\n  When the project was approximately sixty-five percent complete, LaM discovered \r\n  various design and construction problems.Â  A dispute then arose regarding lack \r\n  of payment of some of the construction management fees owed to VCA.Â  As a result \r\n  of the dispute, VCA left the job prior to the completion of construction, thereby \r\n  leaving unfulfilled its contractual obligations.Â  All told, LaM paid VCA $284,498.21 \r\n  for the work, but did not pay approximately $89,000.00 in fees charged during \r\n  the last portion of the construction management phase of the project.\r\nAfter construction was complete and the facility \r\n  went into operation, LaM discovered additional problems with the design and \r\n  construction of the facility.Â  To assess the condition of the facility, LaM \r\n  engaged the services of Facilities Design, Inc., an engineering company with \r\n  experience in the design of cold storage facilities and construction management.Â  \r\n  Over the course of its investigation, Facilities Design found nineteen defects \r\n  in the facilityâ€™s design and construction.Â  These deficiencies included various \r\n  instances of inadequate insulation, improper wiring, insufficient emergency \r\n  lighting, lack of proper drainage, and various code violations.\r\nVCA eventually filed suit against LaM to collect \r\n  the unpaid fees, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, quantum meruit, \r\n  and foreclosure of mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  LaM answered and counterclaimed, alleging \r\n  causes of action for breach of contract, negligence, fraudulent misrepresentation, \r\n  constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of implied warranty, \r\n  and breach of express warranty.\r\nBy order dated May 30, 2001, the trial court granted \r\n  LaMâ€™s motion for summary judgment on all causes of action alleged against it \r\n  by VCA.Â  In so ruling, the court noted VCA was not properly licensed to practice \r\n  engineering in South Carolina because it lacked a Certificate of Authorization \r\n  as required by statute.Â  Because VCA had not complied with the statutory mandate, \r\n  the court held â€œVCA is prohibited from enforcing this contract and collecting \r\n  its fees.â€Â  VCA did not appeal the order.\r\nWith only LaMâ€™s counterclaims remaining, the parties \r\n  tried the matter without a jury in February 2002.Â  The trial court ruled in \r\n  favor of LaM on only its negligence cause of action, finding VCA liable for \r\n  eight of the alleged nineteen design and construction defects.Â  Of the eight \r\n  defects found, however, the court awarded LaM compensation for only six and \r\n  also reduced damages to account for VCAâ€™s unpaid fees, thereby arriving at a \r\n  total award of $34,140.00.Â  LaM now appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for breach of contract is an action at \r\n  law.Â  Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, \r\n  the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found \r\n  to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Townes \r\n  Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 \r\n  (1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nContract\r\nLaM asserts the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to find VCA had breached its contract with LaM.Â  We agree.\r\nIn concluding VCA had not breached its \r\n  contract by discontinuing work on the project, the trial court stated, â€œthe \r\n  evidence further discloses that LaM failed to pay VCA and/or KCV for the work \r\n  it performed under the contract, thereby giving VCA and KCV the legal right \r\n  to pull off of the job based on this non-payment of agreed to fees.â€Â  The court \r\n  also indicated other actions by LaM that contributed to affording VCA the legal \r\n  right to discontinue its performance under the contract.Â  In essence, the court \r\n  ruled LaMâ€™s non-payment and other actions amounted to a material breach of the \r\n  contract, thereby relieving VCA of its obligation to perform.Â  \r\nWhile the trial court is correct that the legal \r\n  consequences of one partyâ€™s material breach is to relieve the other contracting \r\n  party of its performance obligation, that rule has no application in the present \r\n  case.Â  As previously noted, VCA failed to appeal the court order of May 30, \r\n  2001, dismissing its breach of contract claim against LaM.Â  As an unappealed \r\n  order, all the findings of fact and legal conclusions contained thereinâ€”including \r\n  the ruling that LaM did not breach the contractâ€”are now the indisputable law \r\n  of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., \r\n  338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (unappealed ruling is law of the \r\n  case).Â  Because the prior order established as a matter of law that LaM did \r\n  not breach the contract, VCA cannot take a second bite at the apple by defending \r\n  itself on the grounds that LaM materially breached the contract.\r\nBecause VCA offered no other defense or excuse \r\n  for its nonperformance, and the incontrovertible evidence before the court established \r\n  that VCA did not fulfill its contractual obligation, LaMâ€™s breach of contract \r\n  cause of action must succeed as a matter of law.Â  The trial courtâ€™s failure \r\n  to rule accordingly amounts to an error of law.Â  \r\nMoreover, the trial courtâ€™s decision on this matter \r\n  must be reversed because its conclusion that VCA acted negligently in performance \r\n  of its duties cannot be squared with the implied conclusion that VCA did not \r\n  breach its contractual obligation to exercise â€œthe degree of skill and care \r\n  required by customarily accepted, good professional engineering practices and \r\n  procedures.â€ \r\nOffset\r\nLaM next asserts the trial court erred \r\n  in reducing LaMâ€™s damages to account for VCAâ€™s unpaid fees.Â  We agree.\r\nAlthough the trial court found VCA liable \r\n  on LaMâ€™s negligence cause of action, the court also found LaM was comparatively \r\n  negligent:\r\nI find that the Plaintiff has proven both negligent design \r\n  and/or negligent construction management as to certain of the nineteen items \r\n  litigated in this trial as set forth in the discussion, which follows.Â  I further \r\n  find that the Plaintiff was comparatively negligent as to certain of the nineteen \r\n  items litigated at trial.\r\nThe trial court concluded LaMâ€™s comparative negligence \r\n  extended to six of the items.Â  The court reduced LaMâ€™s award for one item by \r\n  twenty percent and reduced the award for the remaining five by fifty percent.Â  \r\n  For each incident of comparative negligence, the court stated the reason for \r\n  reducing the damages award was because LaM failed to pay VCAâ€™s full fee and \r\n  that some of the defects would have been avoided had VCA remained on the job. \r\n\r\nWhile comparative negligence provides \r\n  a sound basis for reducing tort damages, the concept has no application outside \r\n  tort law.Â  Indeed, under contract theory, comparative negligence provides no \r\n  basis for reducing a damages award.Â  See Smoak v. Carpenter Enters., \r\n  Inc., 319 S.C. 222, 224, 460 S.E.2d 381, 383 (1995) (â€œFurther, a charge \r\n  on contributory negligence, a tort concept, would have been inappropriate and \r\n  confusing in the breach of contract and breach of warranty actions.â€).Â  Given \r\n  our conclusion above that LaM is entitled to recover on its breach of contract \r\n  claim, LaM is entitled to recover in full for each item.\r\n REVERSED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-310","title":"State v.

Martini, Jr., of North Myrtle \r\n  Beach, for Appellant, Anthony Sheppard.\r\nErnest Joseph Jarrett, of Kingstree; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The South Carolina Department \r\n  of Social Services (DSS) sought to terminate the parental rights of Teresa Swindler \r\n  and Anthony Sheppard to their minor child.Â  The family court terminated the \r\n  parental rights of both parents.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSwindler and Sheppard married and had one child \r\n  together.Â  At the time of the childâ€™s birth, Swindler and Sheppard were already \r\n  separated.Â  They divorced in 1994 and Swindler received custody of the minor \r\n  child.Â  \r\nOn March 2, 1998, DSS received a complaint Swindler \r\n  left the minor child with strangers and could not be located.Â  Subsequently, \r\n  DSS and Swindler entered into a safety plan, with Swindler retaining custody.Â  \r\n  DSS received a second call in May 1998 indicating, again, that Swindler could \r\n  not be located.Â  Beth Katzenberger, with whom Swindler had been living, informed \r\n  DSS she had cared for the child for approximately two weeks without contact \r\n  by Swindler. \r\nDSS contacted Swindlerâ€™s mother, who indicated \r\n  Swindler had been staying at the motherâ€™s home, without the child. At that time, \r\n  Swindler had gone to Columbia with a boyfriend.Â  However, Swindlerâ€™s mother \r\n  did not know of Swindlerâ€™s exact whereabouts. Since Swindler could not be located, \r\n  the child was taken into emergency protective custody on May 19, 1998.Â  \r\nAfter a merits hearing, the court entered a finding \r\n  that Swindler physically neglected the child and granted custody of the child \r\n  to Sheppard, with supervised visits to Swindler.Â  Both parents were ordered \r\n  to attend individual and family counseling.Â  Additionally, both were required \r\n  to attend and complete parenting skills classes.Â  \r\nSheppard failed to actively participate in the \r\n  counseling sessions and had minimal participation in the treatment plan.Â  In \r\n  fact, he was not cooperative with DSSâ€™s permanency plan. Further, the child \r\n  began acting out sexually in school and her behavior was continuing to deteriorate.Â  \r\n  Â Â Based upon these facts, DSS took custody of the child in November 1999, \r\n  and the minor child has remained in DSS custody since that time.Â  Because of \r\n  her â€œaggressive and sexually reactive behavior and agitated behavior,â€ the minor \r\n  child was placed in a therapeutic foster home.\r\nWhile the child was in foster care, DSS completed \r\n  a home study of Swindlerâ€™s home and the study came back negative because she \r\n  had married Anthony Swindler, a registered sex offender.Â  Swindler maintained \r\n  visitation until her pregnancy and transportation problems caused her to stop.Â  \r\n\r\nSwindler was referred to Dr. Melissa Muse for \r\n  continued counseling and supervised visitation.Â  Dr. Muse expressed concern \r\n  that Swindler would be unable to prevent the child from inappropriately touching \r\n  Swindlerâ€™s other children. Â Additionally, Dr. Muse was concerned that Swindler \r\n  showed little ability to set and enforce boundaries for the child.Â  \r\n&nbsp;DSS brought this action seeking to terminate \r\n  the parental rights of both Swindler and Sheppard.Â  DSS claimed Sheppardâ€™s parental \r\n  rights should be terminated under S.C. Code Ann Â§Â§ 20-7-1572(2), (4), (6), and \r\n  (8) (Supp. 2002).Â  DSS sought to terminate Swindlerâ€™s parental rights under \r\n  sections 20-7-1572(2), (4), and (8).Â  \r\nThe court determined Sheppardâ€™s parental \r\n  rights should be terminated under all sections alleged by DSS.Â  Specifically, \r\n  the court found he: 1) had failed to provide support for a period of more than \r\n  six months; 2) had a diagnosable condition unlikely to change which made him \r\n  unlikely to provide acceptable care; 3) failed to properly complete the treatment \r\n  plan and remedy the conditions leading to the removal of the child; and 4) the \r\n  child had been in foster care for fifteen of the previous twenty-two months.Â  \r\n\r\nIn regards to terminating Swindlerâ€™s parental \r\n  rights, the family court found:Â  1) she willfully failed to provide support \r\n  for in excess of six months, as she had not made a single payment or offer of \r\n  support in over nine months; and 2) the child has been in DSS custody for more \r\n  than fifteen out of the last twenty-two months.Â  \r\nFinally, the family court concluded this \r\n  was a case where the interests of the parents and child were in conflict.Â  The \r\n  court determined the child had been in DSS custody for twenty-eight months and \r\n  that the best interest of the child was to terminate Sheppard and Swindlerâ€™s \r\n  parental rights.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2002), \r\n  mandates that the TPR statutes â€œmust be liberally construed in order to ensure \r\n  prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and control \r\n  of their parents by terminating the parent-child relationship.â€Â  â€œThe interests \r\n  of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578.Â  â€œGrounds for termination of parental rights must \r\n  be proven by clear and convincing evidence.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. \r\n  Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 608-09, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003) (citing \r\n  Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982)).\r\nâ€œUpon review, the appellate court may make its own finding \r\n  from the record as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination.â€Â  \r\n  Headden, 354 S.C. at 609, 582 S.E.2d at 423.Â  The reviewing court, however, \r\n  is not required â€œto ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard \r\n  the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign \r\n  comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. \r\n  281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 (1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Termination of Teresa Swindlerâ€™s Parental Rights\r\nSwindler contends the court erred in terminating \r\n  her parental rights pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1572(4) and (8) (Supp. \r\n  2002).Â  We find there was clear and convincing evidence to support the courtâ€™s \r\n  decision to terminate parental rights.\r\nPursuant to section 20-7-1572: \r\n\r\nThe family court may order the termination of parental rights \r\n  upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that termination \r\n  is in the best interest of the child:\r\n. . . .\r\n(8) The child has been in foster care under the responsibility \r\n  of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months . . . .Â Â  \r\n\r\nSwindler maintains the trial court erred \r\n  in terminating her parental rights pursuant to section 20-7-1572(8), because \r\n  the child was removed for unlawful reasons.Â  We disagree and find this section \r\n  supports the courtâ€™s decision to terminate Swindlerâ€™s parental rights to her \r\n  daughter.\r\nSwindlerâ€™s main contentions are two-fold.Â  \r\n  First, she asserts the statute requires that she be responsible for the removal \r\n  of the child and subsequent need for custody by DSS, and that she contribute \r\n  to the continuance of the removal.Â  Second, she maintains that section 20-7-1572(8) \r\n  requires a showing that DSS undertook reasonable efforts to return the child \r\n  but was unsuccessful due to the parentâ€™s actions or inactions. \r\nâ€œAll rules of statutory construction are subservient \r\n  to the one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered \r\n  in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the \r\n  intended purpose of the statute.â€ Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville \r\n  County, 331 S.C. 19, 26, 501 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1998).Â  The stated purpose \r\n  of the TPR statute â€œis to establish procedures for the reasonable and compassionate \r\n  termination of parental rights where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned \r\n  in order to protect the health and welfare of such children and make them eligible \r\n  for adoption. . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1560 (1976).Â  Furthermore, TPR statutes \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œmust be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures \r\n  for freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by \r\n  terminating the parent child relationship.â€Â  Joiner ex. rel. Rivas v. Rivas, \r\n  342 S.C. 102, 108, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000) (quoting S.C. Code Ann.Â§ 20-7-1578).\r\nA clear reading of the statute juxtaposed \r\n  with its stated purpose demonstrates the legislature intended a child in the \r\n  care of DSS for more than fifteen out of twenty-two months to be freed from \r\n  the custody and control of their parents when it is in the childâ€™s best interest.Â  \r\n  The legislature did not express any further requirement to be proven.Â  \r\nThe child in this case had been in the \r\n  care of DSS from November 3, 1999, until the date of the hearings in March 2002, \r\n  or a total of twenty-eight consecutive months.Â  The family court found that \r\n  subsection 8 was enacted to address the situation presented by Swindlerâ€™s termination. \r\n  The court opined that the legislature made provisions for termination when a \r\n  child was in care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  The court \r\n  held the Department met its burden and showed that the minor child remained \r\n  in foster care because of Swindlerâ€™s failure or inability to provide a home \r\n  that was the subject of a positive home study. \r\nSwindler failed to provide a safe home and demonstrate \r\n  the necessary ability to care for the child in order to have her returned prior \r\n  to the twenty-eight months she spent in foster care.Â  We find that termination \r\n  under section 20-7-1572(8) was proper.\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Best Interest of Child\r\nWe find the family court properly terminated \r\n  Swindlerâ€™s parental rights under Â§ 20-7-1572(8) and find that termination of \r\n  Swindlerâ€™s rights is in the minor childâ€™s best interests. [1] Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family court's \r\n  termination. See Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 580, 578 S.E.2d \r\n  733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003); See also S.C. Code Â§ 20-7-1572 \r\n  (â€œThe family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding \r\n  of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that termination is in \r\n  the best interest of the child.â€). \r\nThere is ample evidence in the record \r\n  to support the conclusion that termination of Swindlerâ€™s parental rights is \r\n  in the childâ€™s best interest.Â  First, the reason for the childâ€™s removal from \r\n  her home was leaving the child with other people for extended periods of time \r\n  while she was out of town.Â  Swindlerâ€™s mother indicated that Swindler would \r\n  leave the child with her while she went to Columbia. \r\nAdditionally, Dr. Muse testified that \r\n  Swindler was ill equipped to care for the special needs of the child.Â  Additionally, \r\n  Dr. Muse indicated that Swindler would be unable to prevent the child from possible \r\n  perpetration of sexual acts against the two younger children.Â  Finally, Dr. \r\n  Muse indicated that Swindlerâ€™s mother put forth the most effort in counseling \r\n  and therapy sessions.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court correctly found \r\n  termination of Swindlerâ€™s parental rights was in the best interest of the minor \r\n  child. \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Termination of Anthony Sheppardâ€™s Parental Rights\r\nThe family court terminated Sheppardâ€™s parental \r\n  rights on four grounds. [2] Â  Upon reviewing the record, Sheppardâ€™s statement, \r\n  and the family courtâ€™s determination in its entirety, we find no error in the \r\n  courtâ€™s decision.Â  The child was in foster care under the responsibility of \r\n  the state continuously from November 1999 until March 2002.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  family courtâ€™s decision to terminate Sheppardâ€™s parental rights is affirmed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the court did not err in terminating \r\n  Swindler and Sheppardâ€™s parental rights under section 20-7-1572(8) and the termination \r\n  was in the best interest of the minor child.Â Â Â  Accordingly, the decision of \r\n  the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  This issue was not appealed.Â  \r\n    While an unappealed ruling is normally the law of the case, see ML-Lee \r\n    Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 \r\n    S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997), because the ruling involves the best interest of a \r\n    child, this court may raise the issue ex mero motu.Â  \r\n    Ex parte Roper, 254 S.C. 558, 563, 176 S.E.2d 175, 177 (1970); see \r\n    also Galloway v.

We affirm.\r\n FACTS\r\nMichael (Appellant) and Christine McFarland are \r\n  the biological parents of Michael McFarland, Jr.Â  The other member of the family \r\n  is Sara McFarland. [1]  While \r\n  the family was living in Cherokee County, the children, then age 3 and 4, were \r\n  found â€œwalking down a busy highway,â€ unsupervised and improperly clothed. This \r\n  occurred in March of 2000. The children had wandered away from their home while \r\n  Mrs. McFarland was sleeping and Appellant was at work. When confronted by the \r\n  authorities, both Appellant and Mrs. McFarland admitted drug use. The family \r\n  court ordered the childrenâ€™s removal from the home because of a lack of supervision \r\n  and because of the drug use. However, the family court granted supervised visitations \r\n  to Mrs. McFarland and Appellant at the discretion of the DSS. The family court \r\n  also adopted a treatment plan and ordered the McFarlands to pay child support \r\n  in the amount of $32.00 per week. \r\nOn April 17, 2000, Appellant was arrested on burglary \r\n  charges. [2]  He tested positive for marijuana and cocaine \r\n  on that day as well. While Appellant was in prison, the family court held a \r\n  first Permanency Hearing in May 2001, which meeting the McFarlands attended. \r\n  The family court decided to extend the plan of reunification by six months. \r\n  In December of the same year, another hearing was held, where Appellant formally \r\n  requested visitation with the children. The family court denied the request \r\n  and ordered a plan of termination of parental rights. \r\nBy an order dated March 7, 2003, the family court \r\n  terminated Appellantâ€™s parental rights regarding both children. \r\n  [3]  It found that:\r\n\r\n(a) the children have lived outside of the home \r\n  of the parent for a period of six (6) months and the parent has failed to visit \r\n  pursuant to S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3); (b) the children have lived outside \r\n  of the home of the parent for a period of six (6) months and the parent has \r\n  willfully failed to support pursuant to S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4); and (c) \r\n  the children have been in foster care under the responsibility of the State \r\n  for fifteen (15) of the last twenty-two (22) months pursuant to S.C.Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-1572(8).\r\n\r\nThe family court ruled that the lack of support \r\n  was willful, since Appellant was gainfully employed when the children were removed. \r\n  [4]  The family court also noted that Appellant had committed three serious \r\n  felonies shortly after the children left, â€œvoluntarily pursu[ing] course of \r\n  lawlessness [leading to] his imprisonment and inability to pay child support.â€ \r\n  The family court ruled that the termination was in the best interest of the \r\n  children. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the family court err in terminating Appellantâ€™s parental rights\r\n    for failure to support his children while he was \r\n  in prison?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the family court err in terminating Appellantâ€™s parental rights\r\n    for failure to visit his children while he was \r\n  in prison?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nâ€œThe termination of parental rights is \r\n  governed by statute.â€ Depâ€™t. of Soc.

Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â  Where the trial courtâ€™s findings are adequately supported, an appellate \r\n  court should give proper deference to those findings since the trial court was \r\n  able to personally observe the parties and weigh their credibility.Â  South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 547 S.E.2d 506 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nThe family court terminated Appellantâ€™s parental \r\n  rights on three statutory grounds and because it found that termination was \r\n  in the best interest of the children. On appeal, Appellant addresses only two \r\n  of those grounds. However, â€œ[a] family court may order the termination of parental \r\n  rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding \r\n  that termination is in the best interest of the child . . . .â€ Â§ 20-7-1572 (emphasis \r\n  added). Additionally, â€œ[an] appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or \r\n  judgment upon any ground(s) in the Record on Appeal.â€ Â Rule 220 (c), SCACR. \r\n  Therefore, we affirm the family court using only statutory ground since we agree \r\n  that the termination of Appellantâ€™s parental rights serves the best interest \r\n  of the children.\r\nThe facts before us clearly satisfy the requirement \r\n  under Â§ 20-7-1572(8) that the children live outside the parentâ€™s home for fifteen \r\n  of the twenty-two months preceding an order for termination. Here, the children \r\n  were removed from the home on April 9, 2000 and have lived in the continuous \r\n  care of DSS. The family court held the termination hearing in October 2002 and \r\n  did not issue the termination order until March 2003. Therefore, the children \r\n  had lived outside the home for at least thirty- six months, more than twice \r\n  the required time. \r\nAs for the best interest of the children, the family \r\n  court found that Appellant had a â€œhistory of domestic violence, drug use and \r\n  neglect, lack of compliance with the treatment plan.â€ The record indicates that \r\n  the authorities had already removed the children from the McFarland home on \r\n  a prior occasion in 1998. Additionally, the family court noted that one of the \r\n  children suffered from an illness that required expensive medication that Appellant \r\n  would probably have difficulty providing. The family court also placed much \r\n  emphasis on the strong bond between the children, a bond that would be at risk \r\n  if the children were separated and placed in different homes. That scenario, \r\n  according to DSS, was more likely to happen without the termination of Appellantâ€™s \r\n  parental rights. Given all of that evidence, plus Appellantâ€™s long-term incarceration, \r\n  we agree with the family court that the termination of Appellantâ€™s parental \r\n  rights serves the best interest of the children.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the family courtâ€™s ruling is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and BEATTY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Mrs. McFarland is Saraâ€™s biological mother, but Saraâ€™s biological \r\n    father is unknown.

Patterson Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-318\r\nSubmitted March 19, 2004 â€“ Filed May \r\n  13, 2004Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Aileen P. Clare, Office of Appellate \r\n  Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nLegal Counsel J. Benjamin Aplin, South Carolina Department \r\n  of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Bruce S. Morris appeals, contending \r\n  the sentencing court relied on invalid considerations in revoking his probation \r\n  for breach of the conditions of probation.Â  We affirm.1\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nFollowing Morrisâ€™ pleas on February 28, 2002, to \r\n  two separate indictments for financial identity fraud, the Honorable Gary E. \r\n  Clary sentenced Morris to two concurrent ten-year terms of imprisonment, suspended \r\n  the sentences, and placed him on probation for five years.Â  Several months later, \r\n  in October 2002, Morris appeared before the Honorable John Few, charged with \r\n  violating the terms of his probation.Â  Judge Few found him in violation of several \r\n  conditions and special conditions, but continued Morrisâ€™ probation as long as \r\n  he either maintained full-time employment or was a full-time college student.Â Â  \r\n\r\nOn May 30, 2003, Morris appeared before the Honorable \r\n  Larry R. Patterson, again charged with violating the conditions of his probation.Â  \r\n  More specifically, the probation citations charged him with (1) failing to report \r\n  as instructed; (2) failing to pay supervision fees arrearage; (3) failing to \r\n  pay court-ordered costs and assessments arrearage; (4) failing to pay restitution \r\n  arrearage; and (5) failing to follow the advice and instruction of the supervising \r\n  agent.Â  Judge Patterson revoked Morrisâ€™ probation and reinstated the original \r\n  ten-year sentences.Â  He later denied Morrisâ€™ motion to reconsider the revocation.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt the revocation hearing, the probation \r\n  officer listed the conditions of Morrisâ€™ probation that he allegedly violated.Â  \r\n  Among other things, he reported that Morris had paid â€œnine hundred dollars on \r\n  restitution to date, leaving him with [an] arrearage of $465.00, and a balance \r\n  of $6,680.97.â€Â  Afterward, Jack Millwood, the victim of one of Morrisâ€™ financial \r\n  identity fraud transactions for which Morris was convicted, addressed Judge \r\n  Patterson and expressed dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system and \r\n  the manner in which it had handled the case.Â  The victim in the other case, \r\n  Joseph A. Nyitray, did not attend the hearing.Â  \r\nFor his part, Morrisâ€™ attorney related Morris had \r\n  a full-time job and had recently paid $1,500 in college tuition.Â  \r\nAt the end of the hearing, Judge Patterson \r\n  said, â€œ[Morris] should of [sic] paid this man his money that he stole \r\n  from him rather than paying the college tuition.Â  Iâ€™m revoking it in full.â€Â  \r\n  Morris thereafter moved Judge Patterson to reconsider his action, claiming â€œsignificant \r\n  factual and legal mattersâ€ either not considered or not fully considered by \r\n  him warranted the revocation order being vacated or modified.\r\n A subsequent hearing on the motion to \r\n  reconsider left the revocation intact.Â  Judge Patterson said he had based the \r\n  order of revocation on Morrisâ€™ failure to report and his choice to pay college \r\n  tuition rather than satisfy his restitution obligation.2Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe decision to revoke probation is addressed \r\n  to the sound discretion of the sentencing judge.Â  State v. Hamilton, \r\n  333 S.C. 642, 511 S.E.2d 94 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nWe cannot say, based on the record before \r\n  us, that the sentencing judge abused his discretion in this instance.Â  Morrisâ€™ \r\n  basic complaint on appeal is that he â€œowed nothing to . . . Millwood at the \r\n  time of his revocation hearing.â€ Nothing in the record, however, supports this \r\n  assertion other than defense counselâ€™s own statement, which he made in argument \r\n  at the sentence reconsideration hearing, that â€œthe court may have based its \r\n  decision, in whole or in part, on a mistaken belief that [Millwood] . . . was, \r\n  in fact, the victim who was aggrieved by the alleged failure to pay restitution \r\n  as ordered.â€Â  Certainly, no evidence supports it.Â  Cf. McManus v. \r\n  Bank of Greenwood, 171 S.C. 84, 171 S.E. 473 (1933) (stating a court cannot \r\n  consider statements of fact appearing only in argument of counsel).\r\nMoreover, the sentencing judgeâ€™s statement that \r\n  â€œ[Morris] should have paid this man his money that he stole from him rather \r\n  than paying the college tuitionâ€ did not identify Millwood as the victim aggrieved \r\n  by Morrisâ€™ failure to pay restitution and could just as well have referred to \r\n  Nyitray.Â  As we read the sentencing judgeâ€™s remarks, he simply expressed concern \r\n  that Morris chose to pay his college tuition rather than pay toward the amount \r\n  he owed in restitution, a sum that totaled $6,680.97 on the date of the probation \r\n  revocation hearing and of which sum he owed $465.00 in arrears. \r\nWe do not reach the issue of whether the \r\n  sentencing judgeâ€™s finding that Morris had failed to report as instructed, a \r\n  finding Morris does not challenge on appeal, alone would support the sentencing \r\n  judgeâ€™s decision to revoke Morrisâ€™ probation.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and BEATTY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n  1Â  \r\n    Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues \r\n    on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rules 215 \r\n    and 220(b)(2), SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n  2 The sentencing judge stated at the hearing on the \r\n    motion to reconsider, â€œI . . . found [a] failure to pay his restitution . \r\n    . .Â  and he failed to report.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-319","title":"Bennett v.

Nichols, of Columbia and William Randall Phipps, of \r\n  Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.Â  \r\nPatrick James Thomas Kelley, of Bluffton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this domestic action, Mitchell \r\n  Foy Dillman (Estate), as personal representative of the Estate of Kenneth Lew \r\n  Dillman (Husband) [1] , alleges \r\n  numerous errors in the family courtâ€™s order on equitable distribution, the alimony \r\n  award, and attorneyâ€™s fee award in favor of Cheryl Moyer Dillman (Wife).Â  We \r\n  affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married in Switzerland on \r\n  October 8, 1989, and were remarried three days later in the United States.Â  \r\n  Prior to their marriage, they purchased a lot on Hilton Head Island.Â  The deed \r\n  conveyed a two-thirds interest to Wife and the remaining one-third to Husband.Â  \r\n  They later built a house on this lot and Wife paid $364,000 of the $443,000 \r\n  total cost of the land and construction.Â  In February 1993, Wife conveyed one-sixth \r\n  of her interest to Husband, thereby vesting each with an undivided one-half \r\n  interest in the property.Â  \r\nIn December 1991, Wife loaned Husband money taken \r\n  from her life insurance policies and funds from her investment account.Â  Husband \r\n  used the funds to satisfy outstanding mortgages on two quad lots in an apartment \r\n  complex he owned in Hinesville, Georgia (Hinesville Apartments). [2] Â  Wife received notes and mortgages \r\n  on the two lots as security for the loan. Â Both parties agreed Husband had significantly \r\n  paid down the notes at the time of trial but disagreed as to the remaining balance \r\n  due.Â  \r\nEarly in 1994, Husband borrowed a substantial sum \r\n  from a bank, which he secured by a mortgage encumbering the coupleâ€™s Hilton \r\n  Head Island home.Â  He used approximately two-thirds of the proceeds of the loan \r\n  to satisfy mortgages on five more quad lots at his Hinesville Apartments, and \r\n  deposited the remaining amount into his personal securities account.Â  By the \r\n  time of the final hearing in family court, Husband had repaid the entire amount \r\n  due on this loan.Â  \r\nIn September 1995, Wife loaned Husband $30,000 from \r\n  her Merrill Lynch checking account.Â  Husband combined these loan proceeds with \r\n  personal funds to purchase a lot in Sun City, Hilton Head, in March 1996.Â  Both \r\n  parties testified Husband repaid at least $15,730 of the loan just prior to \r\n  purchasing the property.Â  \r\nIn June 1999, Wife became suspicious that Husband was \r\n  having an extramarital affair after discovering notes written to him by a woman \r\n  the couple had met while vacationing in France.Â  Husband had taken a trip without \r\n  Wife at the time and place discussed in the notes.Â  Upon his return, Wife discovered \r\n  a used prophylactic in the garbage.Â  Husband denied he and the woman traveled \r\n  together and claimed he shared his hotel room with a gentleman he met on the \r\n  tennis courts.Â  Wife testified Husbandâ€™s extramarital affair was the cause of \r\n  the breakup of their marriage, but Husband claimed the marriage had broken down \r\n  prior to his involvement with the other woman.Â  \r\nIn September 1999, Wife brought this action for divorce, \r\n  seeking equitable distribution of marital property, separate maintenance and \r\n  support, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Both parties requested their antenuptial agreement \r\n  be recognized for purposes of equitable distribution. \r\n  [3] Â  However, after reviewing the agreement, the family court ruled the \r\n  agreement was void, a ruling neither party appealed.Â  The court bifurcated the \r\n  trial, granting Wife a divorce, and reserving all other issues for a later hearing.Â  \r\n  At that hearing, the court divided the marital assets, awarded Wife alimony \r\n  of $1,000 per month, issued a mutual restraining order, and required Husband \r\n  to pay $20,000 of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The order permitted a termination \r\n  of alimony only in the event of Wifeâ€™s death or remarriage, not providing for \r\n  the eventuality of Husbandâ€™s death.\r\nSCOPE \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing \r\n  an appeal from the family court, we have the authority to find facts in accordance \r\n  with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  We are not, however, \r\n  required to disregard the findings of the judge, who saw and heard the witnesses \r\n  and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative \r\n  weight to their testimony.Â  Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 109-110, 557 \r\n  S.E.2d 693, 699-700 (Ct. App. 2001) (internal citations omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Equitable \r\n  Distribution Issues\r\nA.Â  Failure to Consider Statutory Factors\r\nThe estate asserts several errors \r\n  regarding the family courtâ€™s findings and rulings on equitable distribution, \r\n  among them contending the court failed to weigh the various factors contained \r\n  in the statute [4]  by failing \r\n  to consider the existence of an antenuptial agreement and essentially ignoring \r\n  the manner in which the parties conducted their financial affairs during the \r\n  marriage.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe statute lists the factors the family \r\n  court must consider when making an equitable distribution award and vests the \r\n  court with the discretion to determine the weight to be assigned each factor.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2003).Â  Contrary to the estateâ€™s allegations, \r\n  we find the court adequately considered the relevant factors and addressed them \r\n  sufficiently in the final order so that this court is able to conclude it was \r\n  fully cognizant of them.Â  See Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, \r\n  100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. \r\n  492, 502, 478 S.E.2d 854, 859 (Ct. App. 1996)).Â  As an appellate function, this \r\n  court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment, and if the result \r\n  is equitable, taken as a whole, that this court might have weighed specific \r\n  factors differently than the family court is irrelevant.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, \r\n  349 S.C. 85, 97, 561 S.E.2d 610, 616 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nAs to the antenuptial agreement, while it may provide \r\n  evidence of the intention of the parties initially, it is not controlling because \r\n  the prior order of the family court declared it void and there has been no appeal \r\n  of that ruling.Â  Greenville County v. Kenwood Enters., Inc., 353 S.C. \r\n  157, 173, 577 S.E.2d 428, 436 (2003) (holding any unappealed portion of the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s judgment is the law of the case and must therefore be affirmed).Â  \r\n\r\nB.Â  Marital Fault\r\nThe estate further complains the court erred \r\n  by concluding Husbandâ€™s involvement with another woman contributed to the breakup \r\n  of the marriage and in considering such when making its award.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nThe estate does not challenge the courtâ€™s \r\n  conclusion that Husband was involved with another woman, but rather argues the \r\n  marriage was irretrievably broken prior to any involvement.Â  The evidence, however, \r\n  amply demonstrates Husband was corresponding with and secretly meeting the other \r\n  woman prior to the partiesâ€™ divorce, and Wife testified that Husbandâ€™s infidelity \r\n  contributed to the breakup of the marriage.Â  The family court found that Husbandâ€™s \r\n  explanations for his behavior lacked credibility.Â  Accordingly, the court appropriately \r\n  considered Husbandâ€™s fault in its final order.Â  S.C. Code Â§ 20-7-472(2).Â  \r\n\r\nC.Â  Marital Home\r\nThe estate complains the court erred by awarding Husband \r\n  only a 20 percent interest in the marital home, arguing the court devalued his \r\n  sweat equity and in-kind contributions made pursuant to a 5-year plan he alleges \r\n  existed.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe court found Wife directly contributed \r\n  a significantly greater portion of the cost of the house and land, Husbandâ€™s \r\n  direct contribution was minimal, and the partiesâ€™ indirect contributions were \r\n  essentially equal.Â  The estate asserts the court failed to properly weigh Husbandâ€™s \r\n  efforts as general contractor during construction and, later, his responsibilities \r\n  of running the household.Â  Husband relied heavily on a so-called 5-year plan \r\n  contained in a document which Wife denied ever agreeing to.Â  We discern no abuse \r\n  of discretion in the courtâ€™s decision concerning the marital home.Â  Ball \r\n  v. Ball, 314 S.C. 445, 448, 445 S.E.2d 449, 451 (1994) (the family court \r\n  has wide discretion in determining the contributions made by each spouse to \r\n  the marital estate).Â  \r\nThe estate also complains about various other \r\n  provisions of the court order relating to the marital home, including the value \r\n  placed on it by the court allowing a 7 percent reduction in its valuation in \r\n  the event Wife chose to buy Husbandâ€™s interest, in requiring a public auction \r\n  in the event the parties could not agree to sell the house on the open market, \r\n  and in making Wife responsible for any mortgage payment when there was none.Â  \r\n  The appraisal the court accepted was the one prepared closest to the date of \r\n  the filing of the pleadings, and because a private sale would involve a real \r\n  estate commission, it was not erroneous for the court to authorize a reduction \r\n  in the appraisal by a reasonable real estate commission if Wife chose to buy \r\n  Husbandâ€™s interest.Â  The courtâ€™s order on these points was well within its discretion.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-476 (Supp. 2003) (â€œThe court in making an equitable apportionment \r\n  may order the public or private sale of all or any portion of marital property \r\n  upon terms it determines.â€).Â  \r\nD.Â  Treatment of Other Assets\r\nThe estate asserts the family court erred \r\n  in identifying two units at Cotton Hope Plantation, a lot in Sun City, and Husbandâ€™s \r\n  Merrill Lynch and AmeriTrade accounts as marital assets.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe estate initially argues Husband provided \r\n  almost all the funds for the purchase of the units in Cotton Hope Plantation \r\n  and the lot in Sun City.Â  However, these were assets acquired during the course \r\n  of the marriage and are therefore considered to be marital property which, by \r\n  definition, includes â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired \r\n  by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing \r\n  or commencement of marital litigation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  No question of transmutation exists with regard to these assets because they \r\n  were not owned by Husband prior to the marriage.Â  Additionally, there is considerable \r\n  credible evidence these assets were acquired with substantial funds of both \r\n  parties which were commingled.Â  Also, the AmeriTrade account was opened during \r\n  the course of the marriage and was funded by the Merrill Lynch account which, \r\n  as discussed below, was transmuted into marital property.Â  Consequently, it \r\n  is also a marital asset subject to apportionment by the family court.\r\nHusband did open the Merrill Lynch account \r\n  prior to the marriage.Â  However, there was evidence that during the course of \r\n  the marriage Husband made several principal contributions from the partiesâ€™ \r\n  joint funds.Â  There was also testimony that Husband deposited monies from the \r\n  building account maintained by the parties for the marital residence into the \r\n  Merrill Lynch account.Â  Husband offered no record of deposits and disbursements \r\n  for this account.Â  We therefore conclude there was evidence of significant commingling \r\n  of marital funds unto this account and, as a result, the account was transmuted \r\n  into a marital asset subject to apportionment.Â  See Hussey v. Hussey, \r\n  280 S.C. 418, 423, 312 S.E.2d 267, 270 (Ct. App. 1984) (holding nonmarital property \r\n  can become transmuted into marital property when it becomes so commingled as \r\n  to be untraceable).Â  \r\nII.Â  Transmutation \r\n  of Hinesville Apartments\r\nThe estate argues the family court erred \r\n  by holding the totality of Husbandâ€™s Hinesville Apartments had been transmuted \r\n  into marital property and by granting Wife a 30 percent equity interest therein.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nHusband acquired the Hinesville Apartments prior to \r\n  the marriage.Â  In December 1991, Wife borrowed $158,000 against her life insurance \r\n  policies and loaned the proceeds plus a check drawn on her Merrill Lynch account \r\n  for $7,750 to Husband.Â  Husband used the $165,750 to satisfy outstanding mortgages \r\n  only on quad lots 7 and 9.Â  Husband executed two $82,875 promissory notes with \r\n  mortgages on those two quads in favor of Wife as security for the loan.Â  Each \r\n  note had a variable rate calculated to be one percent above the rate paid by \r\n  Wife.Â  Husband claimed he paid down the notes to a balance of $81,587 as of \r\n  March 1, 2001 and was current with his payments.Â  At trial, Wife agreed Husband \r\n  was current with his payments at the time, but testified he had previously been \r\n  behind and late charges accrued increasing the total outstanding balance on \r\n  the notes to $97,485.26 as of December 6, 2002.Â  \r\nHusband also executed a note for $203,000 secured \r\n  by the partiesâ€™ Hilton Head Island home and used $176,457.94 of the loan proceeds \r\n  to satisfy mortgages on quad lots 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8.Â  He deposited the remaining \r\n  amount into his Merrill Lynch securities account.Â  Husband repaid the entire \r\n  amount due under the note as of the date of the final hearing.Â  \r\nNonmarital property may be transmuted only if it \r\n  is utilized in support of the marriage, becomes so commingled as to be untraceable, \r\n  or is utilized in such a manner as to evidence intent to make it marital.Â  Wyatt \r\n  v. Wyatt, 293 S.C. 495, 497, 361 S.E.2d 777, 779 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  None \r\n  of these requirements exist with regard to Husbandâ€™s Hinesville properties.Â  \r\n  Husband held the properties solely in his own name, and the income was paid \r\n  exclusively to him.Â  The funds utilized by Husband to pay the existing mortgages \r\n  were acquired in arms-length transactions evidenced by notes and secured by \r\n  mortgages.Â  The loan secured by a mortgage on the marital residence had been \r\n  fully repaid at the time of the final hearing.Â  Wifeâ€™s own testimony was to \r\n  the effect that she would not have loaned Husband the money to satisfy the existing \r\n  mortgage had she not received security for her loan.Â  The evidence is that Husband \r\n  made regular payments pursuant to the terms of the note.Â  There is no evidence \r\n  either party intended at the time of that transaction to transmute the apartments \r\n  into marital property.Â  We therefore reverse the portions of the family courtâ€™s \r\n  order holding the apartments have been transmuted and equitably dividing them.Â  \r\n  We also reverse the portion of the order requiring sale of the properties and \r\n  forgiveness of the balance of the debt to Wife secured by the properties.Â  The \r\n  estate remains liable for the outstanding balance due on the note.Â  Because \r\n  the parties disagree as to the remaining balance, this issue is remanded to \r\n  the family court to determine the exact amount due.\r\nIII.Â  Alimony\r\nThe estate complains of numerous errors in \r\n  the family courtâ€™s order on the subject of alimony.Â  Most significantly, it \r\n  asserts the court erred by failing to order alimony payments to cease at Husbandâ€™s \r\n  death.Â  We agree this omission was error.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nS.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-130 (B)(1) (Supp. 2003) requires that periodic alimony terminate \r\n  â€œon the remarriage of the supported spouse or upon the death of either spouse.â€Â  \r\n  As Husband has died, Wife is not entitled to any further alimony.\r\nIV.Â  \r\n  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nThe estate \r\n  contends the family court erred by ordering Husband to contribute $20,000 towards \r\n  Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe estate \r\n  argues that we should reverse the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees to \r\n  Wife if we conclude Husband is successful in his appeal.Â  The court will reverse \r\n  the award of attorneyâ€™s fees where the substantive results achieved by a partyâ€™s \r\n  counsel are reversed on appeal.Â  See, e.g., E.D.M. v. T.A.M., \r\n  307 S.C. 471, 477, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In this case, we affirm a majority \r\n  of the family courtâ€™s order and reverse only as to the transmutation and apportionment \r\n  of the Hinesville Apartments and require the termination of alimony in accordance \r\n  with statutory authority.Â  The remainder of the order accrues to the benefit \r\n  of Wife.Â  Accordingly, we find the award of fees to her was proper.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse those portions of the family courtâ€™s order transmuting \r\n  and apportioning Husbandâ€™s Hinesville apartments, require his estate to satisfy \r\n  the remaining balance due on the notes on quads 7 and 9, and remand for the \r\n  court to determine the correct amount.Â  We also find Wife is no longer entitled \r\n  to alimony.Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s order as to the remaining issues.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND \r\n  REMANDED.Â  \r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Husband died during the pendency of this appeal.Â  His son, \r\n    Mitchell Foy Dillman, was named personal representative of his estate.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Prior to the marriage, Husband acquired 7 individual quads \r\n    (freestanding rental units each containing four apartments) and five townhouses \r\n    (all located on a single lot) in Hinesville, Georgia.Â  The quads are identified \r\n    as lots 3 through 9, and the townhouses are identified collectively as lot \r\n    10.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Because both parties already had considerable assets they \r\n    entered into an agreement approximately one month before the marriage stating \r\n    their intentions that their respective children, rather than one another, \r\n    should receive their premarital holdings.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  S.C.

Brigman, all of Latta, and Ralph L. Kelly, of Bennetsville, for \r\n  Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Sue Brigman appeals the ruling \r\n  of a special referee denying probate of the will of W.A. Brigman, her husband. \r\n  We affirm.\r\n \r\n  FACTS\r\nW. A. Brigman, Jr. (Testator) and Sue \r\n  B. Brigman (Appellant) were married in 1973. They lived on a farm in Marlboro \r\n  County, where Testator was a life-long farmer. The land and the farm had been \r\n  in the Brigman family for as many as 150 years. Testator executed a will in \r\n  1994, leaving Appellant a life estate (or until she remarried) in the farm and \r\n  the remainder to his nephew Johnny Brigman (Respondent) in fee simple. Testator \r\n  died on April 26, 1999. (R.30). \r\nFollowing Testatorâ€™s death, a will dated April 23, 1999 \r\n  was offered for probate. That will left the farm and all of the farming equipment \r\n  to Appellant in fee simple. Respondent challenged the validity of the 1999 will. \r\n  The case was referred to a special referee in June 2001 and a hearing was held \r\n  on July 13 of that year.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, Kelly Childers, \r\n  [1]  the Brigmansâ€™ minister, and Nannie Williams, a health care worker, \r\n  testified for Appellant. They were the subscribing witnesses for the 1999 will. \r\n  According to them, Testator was alert and could speak on April 23, the date \r\n  of the willâ€™s execution. The two wills were allegedly read to Testator numerous \r\n  times and he was asked repeatedly if he understood and wanted the changes being \r\n  made. Each time, Testator said yes or nodded his head in agreement. Reverend \r\n  Childers testified Appellantâ€™s â€œhand was up against the back of [Testatorâ€™s] \r\n  hand to aid and give assistanceâ€ when the will was executed. Childers and Williams \r\n  testified that along with Appellant, Appellantâ€™s daughter and grand-daughter \r\n  were also in the home on that evening. [2]  Appellant, her daughter, and \r\n  her grand-daughter did not testify at the hearing. \r\nLaverne Brigman, Respondentâ€™s brother, also testified. \r\n  He claimed that he heard Testator say that Testator was â€œgoing to make some \r\n  changesâ€ on April 6, while Testator was in the hospital. Laverne Brigman also \r\n  testified that Testator was upset with Respondent because Respondent had brought \r\n  some â€œfarm papersâ€ to the hospital for Testator to sign. [3] \r\nRespondent testified on his own behalf. He claimed \r\n  that he visited Testator daily, except for April 10, when Appellant refused \r\n  him entry into the house. Respondent also said that he saw Testator on April \r\n  23, â€œlate in the after-noon.â€ Testator was by then â€œjust breathing . . . [h]is \r\n  eyes were set, he did not speak, he did not move, he did not talk, he did not \r\n  know [Respondent].â€ Respondent maintained that Testator had been in that condition \r\n  since April 11 until his death on April 26. Respondentâ€™s son Johnny Brigman \r\n  also took the witness stand. He corroborated his fatherâ€™s testimony that Appellant \r\n  had barred the two of them from visiting Testator on April 10. \r\nAnother family member testified that Testator â€œwas \r\n  in mighty bad shapeâ€ in the days preceding his death. Testator â€œreally didnâ€™t \r\n  seem to be aware of what was going onâ€ and asked about a relative who had been \r\n  dead â€œa pretty good while.â€ There was also testimony from Annie Anderson. She \r\n  was a neighbor, a long-term friend of Testatorâ€™s family, and a retired registered \r\n  nurse. When she visited Testator in the after-noon of April 23, â€œ[his] eyes \r\n  were . . . glazed overâ€ and â€œ[h]e had no expression.â€ \r\nBy an order of October 15, 2003, the special referee \r\n  found that â€œW. A. Brigman, Jr. was subjected to undue influence or duress to \r\n  execute the document offered for Probate as the Will of W. A. Brigman, Jr. dated \r\n  April 23, 1999.â€ He also found that Testator lacked any testamentary intent \r\n  and testamentary capacity. He denied probate. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the special referee err in finding that Testator\r\n    was under undue influence or duress?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the special referee err in finding that Testator\r\n    lacked testamentary intent?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the special referee err in finding that Testator\r\n    lacked testamentary capacity?Â \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe standard of review applicable to cases \r\n  originating in the probate court is controlled by whether the underlying cause \r\n  of action is at law or in equity.â€ In re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, 568, 544 \r\n  S.E.2d 854, 856 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  An action to determine the validity of a will \r\n  is one at law. In re Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. 251, 262, 495 S.E.2d 454, \r\n  460 (Ct. App. 1997). â€œâ€™If the proceeding in the probate court is in the nature \r\n  of an action at law, the [appellate] court may not disturb the probate courtâ€™s \r\n  findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses there is no evidence \r\n  to support them.â€™â€ Macaulay v. Wachovia Bank of South Carolina, \r\n  N.A., 569 S.E.2d 371 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing Howard \r\n  v. Mutz, 315 S.C. 356, 361, 434 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1993)). â€œContestants of \r\n  a will have the burden of establishing undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, \r\n  revocation, or lack of testamentary intent or capacity.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-407 \r\n  (Supp. 1996). The contestant must do so by clear and convincing evidence. Russell \r\n  v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 333 (2003).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues that the special referee erred when \r\n  he found that Testator executed the 1999 will under undue influence or duress. \r\n  We disagree.\r\nâ€œFor a will to be invalidated for undue influence, the influence \r\n  must be the kind of mental coercion which destroys the free agency of the creator \r\n  and constrains him to do things which are against his free will, and that he \r\n  would not have done if he had been left to his own judgment and volition.â€ Id. \r\n  â€œThe evidence must show that the free will of the testator was taken over by \r\n  someone acting on testator's behalf.â€ Id. In general, there should be \r\n  â€œevidence either of threats, force, and/or restricted visitation, or of an existing \r\n  fiduciary relationship.â€ Id.  \r\nHere, Testator had been in very poor health since April 7, \r\n  when he suffered a second or third stroke. He was also recuperating from a heart \r\n  attack and was suffering from kidney failure. Testator â€œwas going down hill \r\n  fast.â€ The record does not indicate that Testator ever requested a change in \r\n  the 1994 will at all. It was Appellant who spearheaded the execution of the \r\n  1999 will, â€œaidingâ€ Testator to sign the will, choosing the subscribing witnesses, \r\n  telling them when to come.Â Â  Reverend Childers, who testified for Appellant, \r\n  admitted that, on the night in question, Testator â€œcould not sign and [Appellant] \r\n  took his hand and guided it to place his signature on the will.â€ When asked \r\n  whether Testator had indicated he wanted or needed assistance, Reverend Childers \r\n  answered â€œhe didnâ€™t ask her to [help him sign], if thatâ€™s what youâ€™re asking \r\n  me.â€ Compare S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-502 (1976) (â€œ[E]very will, shall be \r\n  in writing signed by the testator or in the testator's name by some other person \r\n  in the testator's presence and by his direction, and shall be signed \r\n  by at least two persons each of whom witnessed either the signing or the testator's \r\n  acknowledgment of the signature or of the will.â€) (emphasis added). \r\nThe special referee also noted that the persons surrounding \r\n  Testator that night, namely Appellant, Reverend Childers, Appellantâ€™s daughter \r\n  and grand-daughter, and the health care worker, testified to reading the 1999 \r\n  will three or four times to him. They did this at a time when Testator was â€œfull \r\n  of poison,â€ not having yet received his nightly dialysis treatment. While there \r\n  is no evidence of threats, witnesses testified that Appellant precluded them \r\n  from visiting Testator on at least one occasion. Moreover, Appellant was heard \r\n  saying â€œI changed his will.â€\r\nClearly, there was some evidence to indicate that Testator \r\n  had been coerced. Therefore, we cannot say that the special referee erred as \r\n  a matter of law in finding that Testator was under duress or undue influence.\r\nAppellant also argues that the special referee erred in finding \r\n  that Testator had no testamentary intent or capacity. Again, we disagree.\r\nIn general, a testator has the capacity to make a will if \r\n  he knows (1) his estate, (2) the objects of his affection, and (3) to whom he \r\n  wishes to bequeath his property. In re Weeks, 329 S.C. at 263, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  at 461. And a testator who signs a will is presumed to understand its nature \r\n  and content. Henkel v. Winn, 346 S.C. 14, 18, 550 S.E.2d 577, 579 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).Â  As said earlier, it up to the party challenging the will to show \r\n  the contrary. Â§ 62-3-407.\r\nAt the hearing, there was testimony that Testator, starting \r\n  around April 11, did not respond to or recognize family members, that he was \r\n  unaware of his surroundings, that his eyes were â€œsetâ€ and â€œglazed.â€ On the specific \r\n  day that the 1999 will was executed, Testator had at least two visitors, Respondent \r\n  and Annie Anderson. They both testified that when they saw Testator in the after-noon, \r\n  he was non-responsive, â€œgone.â€ The subscribing witnesses offered a different \r\n  account. They testified that Testator was alert when the will was signed late \r\n  at night on April 23, that Appellant was told about the changes and approved \r\n  them. The special referee again found, however, that the will was signed when \r\n  Testator was in need of his dialysis treatment. We cannot say that the conclusion \r\n  was legal error. \r\nThe special referee saw and considered all of the testimony. \r\n  He noted, as do we, that neither Appellant nor her daughter testified. Both \r\n  had played key roles in the signing of the 1999 will. The special referee also \r\n  noted that the farm had been in Testatorâ€™s family for numerous generations and \r\n  that Testator had been preoccupied with its long-term care. Respondent had spent \r\n  much time on the farm, both as a boy and as an adult; he had been like a â€œsonâ€ \r\n  to Testator. Testator had already told Respondent that the farm â€œwas coming \r\n  to [him].â€ Additionally, the special referee took into account Testatorâ€™s reputation. \r\n  Testator had always been â€œsteady and stable,â€ not one to â€œact on a whim . . \r\n  . when he wasnâ€™t in full control of his faculties.â€ \r\nThe special referee could have discounted the testimony offered \r\n  by Respondent and Annie Anderson that Testator was already â€œgoneâ€ in the after-noon \r\n  of April 23, 1999. In the alternative, he could have found that Testator regained \r\n  alertness that evening â€“ just long enough to change his will and leave the family \r\n  farm to Appellant. He did neither. Instead, having seen and evaluated all of \r\n  the witnesses, the special referee discounted the testimony of Appellantâ€™s witnesses \r\n  and set aside the 1999 will. [4]  As the record provides some evidence for his \r\n  findings, we cannot say that he erred. Therefore, we affirm his ruling.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the special \r\n  referee is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and BEATTY, JJ, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Childers married Appellant less than one month \r\n    before the probate hearing. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Appellant had children from a previous marriage, \r\n    but none with Testator.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Testator apparently signed a power of attorney over to Respondent \r\n    on April 6, but it was rescinded the next day. Another power of attorney was \r\n    signed on April 10 in favor of Appellant and of Gary Crawford. Gary Crawford \r\n    was a friend of Appellantâ€™s daughter. Appellant used that power of attorney \r\n    to withdraw funds from Testatorâ€™s banking accounts that same day. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  See Sauers v. Poulin Bros.

Keenon, 356 S.C. 457, 459, 590 S.E.2d \r\n  34, 36 (2003) (although the trial court committed clear error in admitting evidence \r\n  of all six of defandantâ€™s prior burglary/housebreaking convictions without first \r\n  weighing the prejudicial effect against the probative value, given the overwhelming \r\n  evidence of defandantâ€™s guilt the admission of more than two prior convictions \r\n  was harmless error); State v. Kilgore, 325 S.C. 188, 192, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  736, 738 (1997) (where evidence of guilt was overwhelming without any reference \r\n  to defendantâ€™s guilty plea to misprision of a felony, any error in admission \r\n  of guilty plea was harmless); State v. Parker, 315 S.C. 230, 235, 433 \r\n  S.E.2d 831, 833 (1993) (the erroneous admission of prior bad acts evidence is \r\n  not reversible error where the evidence of guilt is overwhelming without any \r\n  reference to the evidence of the prior bad act); State v. Mitchell, 286 \r\n  S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (error is harmless when it could not \r\n  reasonably have affected the result of the trial).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-326","title":"In the Interest of Rodriquez P.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2004-UP-326","description":null,"date":"2004-05-14","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoBodyText\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\ttext-autospace:none;\r\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.MsoBlockText\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE \r\n  CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE \r\n  239(d)(2), SCACR. \r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn The Interest Of: Rodriquez P.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAppellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Bamberg County\r\nDale Moore Gable, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-326\r\nSubmitted March 19, 2004 â€“ Filed May \r\n  14, 2004\r\n\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Aileen P.

McIntosh, Deputy Attorney General Treva Ashworth, Assistant \r\n  Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe and Assistant Attorney General R. Westmoreland \r\n  Clarkson, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  On January 14, 2003, \r\n  a Richland County jury found the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt \r\n  that Andrew L. Williams was a sexually violent predator as that term is defined \r\n  in the Sexually Violent Predator Act (the â€œActâ€). [1] Â  Williams appeals, arguing the \r\n  trial court erred in not finding the case barred by res judicata.Â  We affirm.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nWilliams has a history of committing sexually \r\n  violent offenses.Â  For instance, in 1995, the State filed a petition against \r\n  him for criminal sexual conduct with a minor. \r\n  [2] Â  Following a hearing, the court found Williams guilty on a lesser charge \r\n  of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature and sentenced him to \r\n  an indeterminate period in the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice.\r\nWhile Williams was incarcerated at the \r\n  Department of Juvenile Justice, the State charged him with three acts of criminal \r\n  sexual conduct in the first degree. \r\n  [3] Â  Williams pled guilty to one count of criminal sexual conduct in the \r\n  first degree in exchange for the State dismissing the remaining charges.Â  Again, \r\n  the court committed Williams to the Department of Juvenile Justice for an indeterminate \r\n  period not to exceed his twenty-first birthday.Â  Williams remained at the Department \r\n  of Juvenile Justice until he reached the age of seventeen, at which time, he \r\n  was transferred to the Department of Corrections.\r\nWilliams attended sex offender treatment \r\n  during the time he was incarcerated at the Department of Corrections.Â  However, \r\n  the Department terminated him from the program for behavior problems, including \r\n  touching and striking a female employee.Â  Williams also committed other behavioral \r\n  offenses such as when he was given a sexual misconduct charge for masturbating \r\n  in front of a female officer.Â  \r\nDespite these problems, Williams was paroled in \r\n  July 2000.Â  Two of the conditions of his parole were that he attend sex offender \r\n  treatment and stay away from drugs.Â  On September 6, 2000, the State filed a \r\n  petition pursuant to the Act to have Williams confined to a â€œsecure facility \r\n  for long term control, care, and treatment.â€Â  In an order dated September 28, \r\n  2000, Judge James R. Barber found there was probable cause to believe Williams \r\n  met the criteria of a sexually violent predator and ordered his detention pending \r\n  a probable cause hearing.\r\nOn April 9, 2001, following the probable cause \r\n  hearing pursuant to section 44-48-80 of the Act, Judge Alison R. Lee found the \r\n  State had â€œfailed to demonstrate that probable cause exist[ed] to find that \r\n  [Williams] is a sexually violent predator.â€Â  Subsequent to Judge Leeâ€™s probable \r\n  cause determination, Williams attended a parole hearing for failing to attend \r\n  the required sex offender treatment.Â  In August 2001, at a subsequent parole \r\n  hearing, Williams tested positive for marijuana and still had not completed \r\n  sex offender treatment.Â  Finally, in November 2001, Williamsâ€™ parole was revoked \r\n  for failing to comply with his parole conditions.\r\nOn May 24, 2002, relying in part on events \r\n  occurring after Judge Leeâ€™s probable cause determination, the State filed its \r\n  second petition to have Williams confined in a secure facility.Â  One of the \r\n  bases for this petition was Williamsâ€™ failure to attend the sex offender aftercare \r\n  treatment.Â  In an order dated June 14, 2002, and again on July 10, 2002, Judge \r\n  G. Thomas Cooper, Jr. found that probable cause existed to believe Williams \r\n  was a sexually violent predator as defined in the Act.Â  Thereafter, the matter \r\n  came to trial before Judge Thomas W. Cooper.Â  \r\nPrior to the start of trial, the court heard Williamsâ€™ \r\n  summary judgment motion.Â  Williams argued the case was barred by the doctrine \r\n  of res judicata, relying on the April 9, 2001, probable cause determination.\r\nThe trial court denied Williamsâ€™ motion for summary \r\n  judgment holding that because the prior probable cause hearing was not â€œon the \r\n  merits,â€ the doctrine of res judicata did not apply.Â  Following this ruling, \r\n  the case proceeded to a jury trial, after which Williams was found to be a sexually \r\n  violent predator under the Act.Â  Pursuant to this jury finding, the trial court \r\n  committed Williams to the Department of Mental Health for long term treatment.Â  \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in holding that a determination of \r\n  a lack of probable cause in a prior action arising under the Act does not amount \r\n  to a judgment on the merits?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWilliamsâ€™ sole argument \r\n  on appeal is that the trial court erred in not finding the second petition and \r\n  following action barred by the doctrine of res judicata. \r\nUnder the doctrine of \r\n  res judicata, a final judgment on the merits in a prior action will act \r\n  to bar the parties and those in privity with them from initiating a second action \r\n  based on the same claim, to the extent the second claim relates to issues actually \r\n  litigated in the first action, or to issues which might have been litigated \r\n  in the first action.Â  Prince v. City of Georgetown, 297 S.C. 185, 189, \r\n  375 S.E.2d 335, 337 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œTo establish res judicata, the defendant \r\n  must prove three elements: (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity of the \r\n  subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit.â€Â  Nelson \r\n  v. QHG of South Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 290, 304, 580 S.E.2d 171, 178 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003) (citing Sealy v. Dodge, 289 S.C. 543, 347 S.E.2d 504 (1986) \r\n  (further citations omitted)).\r\nAppellant argues the \r\n  prior probable cause hearing amounted to an adjudication on the merits as to \r\n  whether probable cause existed to believe Williams was a sexually violent predator.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, Williams argues the second hearing should have been barred by res \r\n  judicata.Â  We disagree and find the trial court correctly held the action was \r\n  not barred.\r\nSignificantly, Appellant \r\n  cites no cases or other authority to support his contention that a probable \r\n  cause hearing amounts to a decision on the merits and we are not aware of any.Â  \r\n  As such, we conclude a preliminary hearing for the purpose of determining probable \r\n  cause under section 44-48-80 of the South Carolina Code is not the equivalent \r\n  of an adjudication on the merits.Â  The very purpose of the probable cause hearing \r\n  under this section is to determine â€œwhether probable cause exists to believe \r\n  that the person is a sexually violent predator.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(B)(3) \r\n  (2002).Â  Moreover, section 44-48-90 provides that within sixty days of the hearing, \r\n  â€œthe court shall conduct a trial to determine whether the person is a sexually \r\n  violent predator.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (2002).Â  Therefore, according \r\n  to the plain language of the Act, a probable cause hearing is by definition \r\n  not a hearing on the merits.Â  The purpose of the probable cause hearing is to \r\n  determine if sufficient evidence exists to bind the matter over for trial on \r\n  the merits, i.e., to adjudicate whether the person is indeed a sexually violent \r\n  predator under the Act. \r\nWilliamsâ€™ argument further \r\n  fails to acknowledge that the present action includes additional facts concerning \r\n  his parole violations that occurred after the initial probable cause \r\n  determination.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court correctly \r\n  held that this action was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata.Â  The decision \r\n  of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, \r\n  JJ.,Â  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  S.C.

Pogue, of Marion, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Debra Mathews appeals \r\n  the termination of her parental rights. [1] Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe South Carolina Department of Social \r\n  Services (â€œDSSâ€) commenced this action after taking emergency protective custody \r\n  of Letisha Mathews.Â  Letisha, a minor child born on April 19, 1993, suffers \r\n  from cerebral palsy.Â  Letisha has special needs, illustrated by the fact that \r\n  she walks with a limp, has a speech deficiency, and requires special medical \r\n  care.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn February 21, 2001, following a hearing \r\n  pursuant to section 20-7-610 of the South Carolina Code, the family court issued \r\n  an order granting DSS custody of Letisha.Â  The court based its ruling primarily \r\n  on the fact that on several occasions, no one was present to care for Letisha \r\n  when she returned home from school. [2] Â  The order also mentions that \r\n  Ms. Mathews was informed of her right to have an attorney and the procedure \r\n  by which she could have one appointed. \r\nOn February 23, 2001, after a merits hearing \r\n  and pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the court affirmed its award \r\n  of custody to DSS, and ruled that a treatment plan presented to Ms. Mathews \r\n  by DSS was fair, equitable, and in the best interests of Letisha.Â  This order \r\n  reflects that prior to the hearing, Ms. Mathews was properly served with notice \r\n  of her right to counsel.Â  \r\nThe parties attended a permanency planning \r\n  hearing on January 29, 2002.Â  On February 8, 2002, the court issued an order \r\n  finding it would be in Letishaâ€™s best interest to remain in the custody of DSS, \r\n  that DSS should seek termination of Ms. Mathewsâ€™ parental rights, and that DSS \r\n  continue the treatment plan it presented at the merits hearing.Â  The order notes \r\n  that per her request, Ms. Mathews was allowed to represent herself.Â Â  \r\nOn April 3, 2002, DSS filed a complaint seeking \r\n  termination of Ms. Mathewsâ€™ parental rights.Â  The complaint alleged, among other \r\n  things, that Letisha had been removed from her home for at least six months \r\n  and Ms. Mathews had failed to remedy the conditions that caused her removal. \r\n  [3] Â  The parties met for a hearing on July 23, 2002. Â Deciding her rights \r\n  should be terminated, the family court relied in part on the testimony of Dr. \r\n  Neely, who performed psychological evaluations of Ms. Mathews.Â  In Dr. Neelyâ€™s \r\n  opinion, Ms. Mathews is unable to properly care for Letisha without having someone \r\n  present to provide assistance.Â  The court issued its order terminating Ms. Mathewsâ€™ \r\n  parental rights on September 4, 2002.Â  Ms. Mathews was represented by counsel \r\n  at the final hearing.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the family court err in ruling DSS proved by clear and convincing evidence \r\n  that Ms. Mathews failed to remedy the conditions leading up to the removal of \r\n  her child?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the family court err in allowing Ms. Mathews to represent herself at all \r\n  hearings other than the final termination of parental rights hearing?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn a termination of parental rights \r\n  (TPR) case, the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.â€Â  \r\n  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003) (citing South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. \r\n  129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct.App.2000)).Â  Before a parentâ€™s rights may \r\n  be terminated, the alleged grounds for termination must be proven by clear and \r\n  convincing evidence.Â  Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Mrs. H, 346 S.C. 329, 333, \r\n  550 S.E.2d 898, 901 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nOn appeal, this court may review the record \r\n  and make its own determination of whether the grounds for termination are supported \r\n  by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Id.; see also South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d \r\n  506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, despite this broad scope of review, this \r\n  court is not required to disregard the findings of the family court nor ignore \r\n  the fact that the trial judge was in a better position to evaluate the credibility \r\n  of the witnesses.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, \r\n  324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Clear and Convincing Evidence\r\nMs. Mathews first argues the family court erred \r\n  in ordering termination of her parental rights because DSS failed to prove by \r\n  clear and convincing evidence that she failed to remedy the conditions leading \r\n  up to her childâ€™s removal.Â Â  Specifically, Ms. Mathews attacks the quality of \r\n  Dr. Joe Neelyâ€™s investigation and makes a concomitant allegation that certain \r\n  witnesses merely adopted the doctorâ€™s position.Â Â  The evidence in the record, \r\n  however, belies this argument.\r\nDr. Neely had an adequate opportunity \r\n  to examine Ms. Mathews and arrive at his conclusions.Â  The family court judge \r\n  assigned weight to Dr. Neelyâ€™s testimony, and we concur with this assessment.Â  \r\n  In fact, Ms. Mathewsâ€™ objective living of life falls in line with his opinion \r\n  that she is a â€œvery impulsive woman who does not make really good decisions.â€Â  \r\n\r\nMs. Mathewsâ€™ lifestyle reflects \r\n  a pattern of placing her own interests above Letishaâ€™s interest.Â  In 1998, for \r\n  example, Ms. Mathews placed Letisha with some friends while she went on â€œvacationâ€ \r\n  with a truck driver.Â  Ms. Mathews informed her friends that she would return \r\n  for Letisha in a week.Â  After several weeks with no word from Ms. Mathews, these \r\n  friends notified DSS.Â  DSS took custody of Letisha.Â  Similarly, since Letisha \r\n  was first removed from Ms. Mathewsâ€™ home at the start of the current action, \r\n  Ms. Mathews has moved seven different times.Â  She also has had many different \r\n  boyfriends during this period. \r\nThere are also Ms. Mathewsâ€™ repeated failures \r\n  to meet Letisha when she arrives home from school, or to make arrangements for \r\n  someone else to meet Letisha at the bus stop.Â  This resulted on many occasions \r\n  the school bus driver having to return Letisha to school.Â  In fact, the current \r\n  action began after the fifth such incident.Â  On another occasion, an earlier \r\n  investigation revealed that Donald Green, one of Ms. Mathewsâ€™ male friends and \r\n  the person supposedly taking care of Letisha, smelled of alcohol.Â  Although \r\n  the treatment plan proposed by DSS mandated that Ms. Mathews attend anger management \r\n  classes, she openly admitted she still has problems controlling her temper.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nConsidering this history, there is more \r\n  than enough evidence in the record to support Dr. Neelyâ€™s testimony, and particularly \r\n  his opinion that if Letisha were returned to Ms. Mathews â€œthere should be an \r\n  extremely high level of supervision.â€Â  \r\n As for Ms. Mathewsâ€™ allegation that DSSâ€™s \r\n  other witnesses merely â€œrubber stampedâ€ Dr. Neelyâ€™s opinions, the record does \r\n  not support this contention.Â  It is clear from the record each of these witness \r\n  had an independent history of dealing with Ms. Mathews, and each had the opportunity \r\n  to arrive at their own conclusions regarding her fitness as a parent and, significantly, \r\n  the likelihood Ms. Mathews would remedy the conditions which necessitated removal.\r\nFor instance, Peggy Bryant testified to \r\n  much of the behavior outlined above.Â  She further testified to being present \r\n  at times when she felt Ms. Mathewsâ€™ behavior towards Letisha was inappropriate.Â  \r\n  Finally, Ms. Bryant testified that DSS sought to terminate Ms. Mathewsâ€™ parental \r\n  rights based on her failure to rehabilitate.Â  According to Ms. Bryant, as of \r\n  January 2002, Ms. Mathews failed to complete a number of objectives outlined \r\n  in the treatment plan.Â  Of particular importance was Ms. Mathewsâ€™ failure to \r\n  understand the importance of providing appropriate supervision and stable housing \r\n  for Letisha.Â  Although Ms. Bryant did testify that DSS relied in part on Dr. \r\n  Neelyâ€™s opinion in making its determination that Ms. Mathews would be unable \r\n  to complete her rehabilitation, it is clear Ms. Bryant arrived at her own conclusions \r\n  regarding Ms. Mathewsâ€™ fitness as a parent.\r\nSimilarly, Mrs. Marley, the guardian ad \r\n  litem, testified about her experiences with Ms. Mathews.Â  Although Mrs. Marley \r\n  testified she agreed with Dr. Neelyâ€™s opinion that Ms. Mathews repeatedly makes \r\n  poor decisions, she provided specific examples which gave rise to her independent \r\n  conclusions.Â  Specifically, Mrs. Marley stated, â€œI have observed mom in many \r\n  different homes with different relationships.Â  And I â€“ and thatâ€™s my opinion.Â  \r\n  It happens to be the doctorâ€™s.â€Â  As such, it is clear Mrs. Marley did not merely \r\n  adopt Dr. Neelyâ€™s opinion as her own.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn an attempt to bolster her position \r\n  that the conditions leading up to removal of Letisha have been remedied, Ms. \r\n  Mathews mentions that her mother, Mrs. Robinson, agreed to move into her home \r\n  to provide Letisha with after-school care.Â  However, as DSS correctly points \r\n  out, this is not exactly a true assertion.Â  Mrs. Robinson testified that while \r\n  she would be willing to watch Letisha after school, she would not be able to \r\n  live with them because she had her â€œown home to run, too.â€Â Â Â  Mrs. Robinson \r\n  also testified that Ms. Mathews never asks for her help when there is a man \r\n  in her house.Â  The limitations Mrs. Robinson places on her ability to care for \r\n  Letisha are significant when one considers Ms. Mathewsâ€™ history of frequent \r\n  moves and her habit of dating a number of men for short periods of time.Â  \r\nBecause we find the evidence supports \r\n  the family courtâ€™s findings, findings with which we concur, we conclude DSS \r\n  established that Ms. Mathewsâ€™ parental rights should be terminated by clear \r\n  and convincing evidence.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Counsel\r\nMs. Mathews argues on appeal that the \r\n  family court erred in allowing her to represent herself at all hearings other \r\n  than the final termination of parental rights hearing.Â  As an initial matter, \r\n  this issue was not properly preserved for our review.Â  From the record it does \r\n  not appear any challenges were made to the family court raising this issue.Â  \r\n  At the very least, there was no specific assignment of error, although the record \r\n  does contain testimony related to the absence of an attorney.Â  \r\nIn addition, the family courtâ€™s final order is \r\n  completely silent as to this issue.Â  If it were an issue as Ms. Mathews now \r\n  asserts, appellate preservation rules would have required a Rule 59(e), SCRCP \r\n  motion.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d \r\n  731, 733 (1998) (stating that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on \r\n  appeal, the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court).Â  \r\n  In this case, such a motion was not made.Â  Therefore, technically this argument \r\n  is not preserved for our review.\r\nHowever, because we understand the importance \r\n  of thoroughly reviewing matters where termination of parental rights is at stake, \r\n  we have examined this alleged point of error even though it was not properly \r\n  preserved.Â  See Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 107, \r\n  536 S.E.2d 372, 374 (2000) (holding that it is not error to rule on an issue \r\n  raised to but not ruled on by the family court because â€œprocedural rules are \r\n  subservient to the courtâ€™s duty to zealously guard the rights of minorsâ€).\r\nMs. Mathews would have us assign weight to the \r\n  absence of an attorney in all hearings other than the final termination of parental \r\n  rights hearing.Â  This position is heightened by an effort on appeal to cast \r\n  herself in a more deficient light mentally than the record actually supports.Â  \r\n  Ms. Mathews, in this court, seeks to draw an inconsistency between Dr. Neelyâ€™s \r\n  opinion that she possesses a â€œborderline to low average range intelligence,â€ \r\n  and the trial courtâ€™s determination that she was able to waive her right to \r\n  counsel and represent herself.Â  We find no reversible error.\r\nWhile we do have concerns with Ms. Mathewsâ€™ mental \r\n  state, it is clear from the record she is able to function in society.Â  It may \r\n  be true that she does function in the low to average range of intelligence, \r\n  but this alone is not dispositive of the question before us.Â  Many good parents \r\n  fall within this category and are still able to care for their children.Â  \r\nOur review convinces us that Ms. Mathews possesses \r\n  the necessary level of mental functioning to competently waive her right to \r\n  counsel and should she choose to, act as a fit parent.Â  However, we agree \r\n  with the family court and arrive at the conclusion that Ms. Mathewsâ€™ parental \r\n  rights were properly terminated.Â  This determination does not arise from her \r\n  purported deficient mental status, but from the lack of stability in her life \r\n  and her consistent pattern of exercising poor judgment as far as the care of \r\n  her daughter is concerned.Â  \r\nAs noted previously, Ms. Mathews has a history \r\n  of following her own interests in lieu of Letishaâ€™s.Â  In 1998, DSS exercised \r\n  protective custody of Letisha after Ms. Mathews failed to return from a vacation.Â Â  \r\n  On five occasions, Ms. Mathews has failed to ensure someone was home to care \r\n  for Letisha after school.Â  Although she asserts her mother will move in to help \r\n  her take care of Letisha, her mother admits she has her own house to run and \r\n  Ms. Mathews does not ask for help when there is a man in her life.Â  To this \r\n  end, Ms. Mathews has a history of dating men, but not for significant periods \r\n  of time.Â  She has moved seven times since the current action began.Â  Ms. Mathews \r\n  has repeatedly made poor decisions and admits she does not always think before \r\n  she acts.Â  She also admitted to having problems controlling her temper.Â  \r\nIt is the type of behavior outlined above which \r\n  triggered the treatment plans promulgated by DSS.Â  It is also clear from the \r\n  record she had the ability to comply with the plans, as she did in part.Â  However, \r\n  it is the cumulative effect of this history that persuades us of the correctness \r\n  of the trial courtâ€™s ruling and that termination of Ms. Mathewsâ€™ parental rights \r\n  is in Letishaâ€™s best interest.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe family courtâ€™s decision to terminate the parental rights of Ms. \r\n  Mathews is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Although the case originally included John Doe, Letishaâ€™s \r\n    unknown father, only Ms. Mathews appeals from the family courtâ€™s ruling.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Specifically, the order states the complained of incident \r\n    was the fifth time Letisha returned home during the school year without proper \r\n    supervision.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  See S.C.

Hornsby Moore to her minor son, Skylar Hatcher.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nTammy Moore is the mother of Skylar Hatcher, \r\n  born January 13, 1997.Â  Skylar lived with his mother in Aiken County until he \r\n  was about one and a half years old.Â  Then, in June 1998, Moore asked the Hatchers, \r\n  Skylarâ€™s paternal grandparents, to care for Skylar.Â  Immediately after placing \r\n  Skylar with the Hatchers, Moore was arrested for failing to appear in court \r\n  on a matter unrelated to the instant case.Â  \r\nAfter her June 1998 arrest, Mooreâ€™s contact with \r\n  and support for her son was limited.Â  At Mooreâ€™s request, the Hatchers retained \r\n  primary physical custody of Skylar.Â  Shortly after her arrest, Moore sent the \r\n  Hatchers a personal check for fifty dollars.Â  A few weeks later, Mike Hornsby, \r\n  a friend of Mooreâ€™s and the father of her other child, sent an additional check \r\n  for fifty dollars to the Hatchers for Skylarâ€™s support.Â  \r\nIn August 1998, Moore was involved in a serious \r\n  car accident in which the passenger in the car she was driving was killed.Â  \r\n  Moore was charged with and pled guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was ultimately \r\n  sentenced to five years imprisonment.Â  \r\nAfter the accident, Moore was admitted to a drug \r\n  treatment facility as mandated by a previous court order.Â  She was released \r\n  approximately one month later.Â  Following her release, Moore moved toÂ  Seneca, \r\n  South Carolina, to live with her parents.Â  Â Â \r\nMoore testified she would occasionally visit Skylar \r\n  during the following months by â€œsneaking upâ€ to see him with the help of Skylarâ€™s \r\n  father, Trent Hatcher.Â  Moore also claimed she left Christmas presents for Skylar \r\n  at the Hatchersâ€™ home in December 1998.Â  She returned to Aiken full-time in \r\n  July 1999 and lived with Trent in a trailer adjacent to the Hatchersâ€™ home.Â  \r\n  Moore moved out approximately one month later.Â Â  Throughout this time, Moore \r\n  testified she was unemployed and unable to provide any additional financial \r\n  support for Skylar.Â  \r\nMoore last saw Skylar on October 31, 1999.Â  The \r\n  next day she began serving her five-year prison sentence for the August 1998 \r\n  involuntary manslaughter conviction.Â  \r\nWhile she was in prison, Moore attempted to maintain \r\n  involvement with Skylar and the Hatchers.Â  Though she earned no money in prison, \r\n  she sent letters and holiday cards to Skylar along with letters to the Hatchers \r\n  asking how her son was doing and thanking them for their help raising Skylar \r\n  while she was away.Â  Moore also requested that the Hatchers bring Skylar to \r\n  visit her in prison.Â  They refused to do so.Â  \r\nThe Hatchers brought this action in May 2000, seeking \r\n  to terminate Mooreâ€™s parental rights to Skylar, alleging she had willfully failed \r\n  to visit or support Skylar during the time the child had been in their custody.Â  \r\n  The family court denied the Hatchersâ€™ request, finding they failed to establish \r\n  sufficient grounds to terminate Mooreâ€™s parental rights. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGrounds for termination of parental rights \r\n  must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, \r\n  334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999).Â  On appeal of a termination of \r\n  parental rights case, this court may review the entire record to make a determination \r\n  of the facts according to our view of the evidence.Â  Richland County Depâ€™t \r\n  of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1998). Our \r\n  broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard the findings \r\n  of the family court below or ignore the fact the trial judge was in a better \r\n  position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001). \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Hatchers argue the family court erred \r\n  in denying their request to terminate Mooreâ€™s parental rights to Skylar, because \r\n  they assert the evidence clearly demonstrates Moore failed to support and visit \r\n  Skylar.Â  We disagree.\r\nTermination of parental rights is governed \r\n  by South Carolina Code section 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2003).Â  This statute provides \r\n  that the family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding \r\n  of one or more of the enumerated grounds.Â Â  In this case, the Hatchers sought \r\n  to terminate Mooreâ€™s parental rights to Skylar pursuant to subsections (3) and \r\n  (4) of the statute, which provide for termination if:\r\n\r\n(3) The child has lived outside \r\n  the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the \r\n  parent has wilfully failed to visit the child. The court may attach little \r\n  or no weight to incidental visitations, but it must be shown that the parent \r\n  was not prevented from visiting by the party having custody or by court order.Â  \r\n  The distance of the childâ€™s placement from the parentâ€™s home must be taken into \r\n  consideration when determining the ability to visit;\r\n(4) The child has lived outside \r\n  the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the \r\n  parent has wilfully failed to support the child.Â  Failure to support \r\n  means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s \r\n  care.Â  A material contribution consists of either financial contributions according \r\n  to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other \r\n  necessities for the care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means.Â  The \r\n  court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not \r\n  the parent has wilfully failed to support the child, including requests for \r\n  support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support; \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1752(3) &amp; (4) (Supp. 2003) \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nWhether a parentâ€™s failure to visit or \r\n  support a child is willful under section 20-7-1752 is a question of intent to \r\n  be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case. Â South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 610, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 \r\n  (2003).Â  Our supreme court has held â€œ[c]onduct of the parent which evinces a \r\n  settled purpose to forego parental duties may fairly be characterized as â€˜willfulâ€™ \r\n  because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to \r\n  receive support and consortium from the parent.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1992).Â  The \r\n  element of willfulness must be established by clear and convincing evidence.Â  \r\n  Id. at 52, 413 S.E.2d at 838.\r\nBased on our review of the record, we \r\n  do not find there is clear and convincing evidence to show Moore willfully failed \r\n  to visit or support Skylar.Â  Mooreâ€™s testimony, which we find largely credible, \r\n  reveals she made numerous attempts to visit Skylar prior to her incarceration, \r\n  doing so discreetly when she felt she would not be welcome in the Hatchersâ€™ \r\n  home. We also note the period of time Moore lived adjacent to the Hatchers in \r\n  the summer of 1999.Â  Mooreâ€™s credible testimony indicates she took advantage \r\n  of that opportunity to spend time with Skylar.Â  Mooreâ€™s imprisonment did not \r\n  end her desire to see her son.Â  The Hatchers admitted that Moore asked them, \r\n  on more than one occasion, to bring Skylar to the prison for a visit.Â  The Hatchers \r\n  refused these requests.Â  It was also admitted that Moore tried to maintain contact \r\n  and involvement with Skylar from prison by way of regular cards and letters \r\n  to Skylar and the Hatchers.\r\nOn the question of Mooreâ€™s support for \r\n  Skylar, we find her lack of support in this case does not rise to the level \r\n  warranting termination of parental rights.Â  To be sure, Moore provided very \r\n  little in the form of pure financial support.Â  We cannot say, however, that \r\n  Moore evidenced a desire to completely forgo her duty to support Skylar.Â  The \r\n  gifts she provided Skylar, along with the time spent with Skylar in summer 1999, \r\n  indicate some commitment on the part of Moore to contribute to Skylarâ€™s care.Â  \r\n\r\nWe are additionally mindful of the instruction \r\n  in section 20-7-1572(4) that the court must evaluate the support Moore provided \r\n  according to her means.Â  As noted above, Moore was unemployed in the year prior \r\n  to her imprisonment.Â  Though she had received some money from the sale of real \r\n  estate, Moore testified that a substantial portion of this money had to be used \r\n  to pay off an existing debt.Â  While in prison, Moore earned no money.Â  We, like \r\n  the family court judge, afford greater weight to the contributions Moore did \r\n  make to the care of Skylar in light of her very limited financial means.Â Â  \r\nIn reaching this decision, we do not intend to \r\n  gloss over the plain fact that Mooreâ€™s poor decisions in her life have had a \r\n  negative impact on her ability to meet her obligations as a parent to Skylar.Â  \r\n  Poor decisions, however, do not necessarily signal an intent to forgo all parental \r\n  rights:\r\n\r\nThe fundamental liberty interest \r\n  of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does \r\n  not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary \r\n  custody of their child to the State.Â  Even when blood relationships are strained, \r\n  parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction \r\n  of their family life.\r\n\r\nSantosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982) \r\n  (Stevens, J., dissenting).\r\nMoore does not claim she has been a model parent.Â  \r\n  The record reveals she has acknowledged her mistakes, and she has consistently \r\n  expressed appreciation for the Hatchersâ€™ important role in raising Skylar.Â  \r\n  In our firm judgment, Mooreâ€™s efforts to maintain involvement in Skylarâ€™s life \r\n  before and after her incarceration, though far from ideal, warrant a finding \r\n  that she has not evinced a settled purpose to forgo her parental duties.Â  \r\nOverall, we concur with the family courtâ€™s determination \r\n  that the Hatchers have not established by clear and convincing evidence that \r\n  Moore wilfully failed to visit and support Skylar under the standard of section \r\n  20-7-1752.Â  The order of the family court denying the Hatchersâ€™ complaint for \r\n  termination of Mooreâ€™s parental rights is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-333","title":"Nationwide v.

Jackson, Jr., of Orangeburg, for Appellants.\r\nDarra J. Vallini, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  David and Barbara Smith appeal \r\n  from the special refereeâ€™s order granting Nationwide Insurance Companyâ€™s motion \r\n  for summary judgment.Â  We reverse.\r\n FACTS\r\nAND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n   On August 25, 1999, David Smith drove \r\n    his employerâ€™s log truck, a 1988 Kenworth Tractor, to Georgia on company business.Â  \r\n    While in Georgia, the truck experienced mechanical problems and Smith called \r\n    Donald Brandt, whom Smith then believed was his employer, for assistance.Â  \r\n    Brandt arrived at the scene driving his personal vehicle.Â  He decided to tow \r\n    the log truck behind his vehicle and drive back to South Carolina.Â  Smith \r\n    steered the disabled log truck while it was being towed.Â  During the tow of \r\n    the log truck, two tires on Brandtâ€™s vehicle â€œblew out,â€ forcing both vehicles \r\n    off the road and down a hillside.Â  Smith was injured as a result of this accident.\r\n  On the date of the accident, Smith believed Brandt \r\n    was his employer.Â  Smith subsequently learned of Brandtâ€™s purported transfer \r\n    of the 1988 Kenworth Tractor to his daughter, Chastity Connelly, on August \r\n    1, 1999, under the name Connelly Specialty Post Poles and Lumber.Â  Brandtâ€™s \r\n    attempted transfer to his daughter of ownership of his company assets, including \r\n    the log truck, was part of his apparent efforts to defraud a judgment creditor.Â  \r\n    On July, 12, 1999, a judgment in excess of one million dollars was entered \r\n    in Bamberg County against Brandt. \r\n    [1] \r\n  While a bill of sale was executed transferring \r\n    the Kenworth Tractor to Chastity and her company, \r\n    [2]  Connelly Specialty Post Poles and Lumber, neither the bill of sale \r\n    nor the certificate of title were filed with the South Carolina Department \r\n    of Public Safety. [3] Â  Moreover, \r\n    prior to the one million dollar judgment, there had never â€œbeen any discussion \r\n    by [Brandt] to [Chastity] or by [Chastity] to [Brandt] that she was going \r\n    to get into any transportation business.â€ Â Nevertheless, Chastity claimed \r\n    to be Smithâ€™s employer on the day of the accident, August 25, and only \r\n    on that day.Â  Not knowing whether Brandt or Chastity was his true employer \r\n    on August 25, Smith named both Brandt and Chastity in his workerâ€™s compensation \r\n    claim.Â  That claim was settled, with contributions from both Brandtâ€™s and \r\n    Chastityâ€™s respective companies, prior to the issuance of a final decision \r\n    by the Workerâ€™s Compensation Commission.Â  The orders approving the settlement \r\n    agreements refer to Brandt as the â€œalleged employerâ€ and Chastity as the â€œemployer.â€\r\n  Smith and his wife subsequently filed a negligence \r\n    action against Brandt.Â  Brandtâ€™s personal vehicle was covered by a Nationwide \r\n    insurance policy.Â  Nationwide filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking \r\n    a determination that it owed no duty to insure Brandt.Â  Specifically, Nationwide \r\n    argued against coverage because it claimed Smith was employed by Brandt at \r\n    the time of the accident, and Brandtâ€™s policy specifically excluded employees \r\n    from coverage.Â  The matter was referred to a special referee.Â  Nationwide \r\n    filed a motion for summary judgment based primarily upon depositions taken \r\n    in the workerâ€™s compensation action.Â  The special referee granted the motion, \r\n    finding Brandt was Smithâ€™s employer on August 25, 1999, as a matter of law.Â  \r\n    The Smiths appeal.\r\n   STANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n    Summary judgment is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, \r\n      depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together \r\n      with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any \r\n      material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter \r\n      of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Tupper v. Dorchester \r\n      County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997); Wells v. City \r\n      of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 301, 501 S.E.2d 746, 749 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\n      In reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies \r\n      the same standard which governs the circuit court: summary judgment is proper \r\n      when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving \r\n      party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; \r\n      Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d \r\n      537, 545 (1991).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, \r\n      the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence \r\n      must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Strother \r\n      v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, \r\n      121 (1998).\r\n     DISCUSSION\r\n      The Smiths argue the special \r\n        referee erred in granting Nationwideâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We \r\n        agree.\r\n        The relevant section of the Nationwide \r\n          policy on Brandtâ€™s personal vehicle excludes coverage for â€œinjury to \r\n          an employee of any insured while engaged in employment.â€\r\n        We find that, based upon the pleadings, \r\n          exhibits, and deposition testimony in this case, the special referee \r\n          erred in granting Nationwideâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  In granting \r\n          summary judgment the special referee improperly assigned credibility \r\n          to Smithâ€™s initial belief that he was employed by Brandt on August 25.

Victor Rawl, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-334\r\nHeard April 6, 2004 â€“ Filed May 17, \r\n  2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nThomas R. Goldstein, of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\nR. Allen Young, of Mt. Pleasant; and Frances Isaac Cantwell, \r\n  of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Â Jose Hernandez and Cynthia \r\n  Hernandez appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the denial of a zoning \r\n  variance by the Mt. Pleasant Board of Zoning Appeals and dismissing their claims \r\n  for violation of their rights to due process and equal protection.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Hernandezes own a 7.7-acre lot in \r\n  a subdivision in Mt. Pleasant.Â  Originally, the unified lot extended from frontage \r\n  on Bampfield Drive to frontage on Coinbow Drive, with a lake in the middle of \r\n  the parcel.Â  Now, however, because the Hernandezes sold highland around the \r\n  perimeter of the lake to adjoining property owners, the lake bisects the Hernandezesâ€™ \r\n  lot, separating the highland fronting Coinbow Drive from the highland fronting \r\n  Bampfield Drive.Â  The Herndandezesâ€™ home is on the Coinbow Drive side of the \r\n  parcel of land.Â  They decided to subdivide the parcel and create a new lot on \r\n  the Bampfield Drive side of the lake.Â  \r\nThe new lot is a roughly triangular shaped highland \r\n  by the lake with a 25 feet by 172 feet corridor leading to Bampfield Drive.Â  \r\n  Under the townâ€™s zoning ordinances, the lot is classified as a flag lot.Â  Neither \r\n  party disputed this classification during the hearing before the circuit court.Â  \r\n  A flag lot is one failing to meet the minimum lot width for the applicable zoning \r\n  district, as measured at the front setback building line.Â  The new lot would \r\n  be 25 feet wide at the setback line as opposed to the required 80 feet for the \r\n  zoning district.Â  \r\nThe Hernandezes applied for a variance from the \r\n  ordinance to allow them to create the new lot.Â  At the hearing before the Board \r\n  of Zoning Appeals, the neighboring property owners objected to the granting \r\n  of the variance.Â  The Board denied the variance request, finding the proposed \r\n  lot to be a detriment to the surrounding property values.Â  \r\nThe Hernandezes then appealed the Boardâ€™s decision \r\n  to the circuit court, challenging the merits of the decision, the constitutionality \r\n  of the procedure for hearing variance requests, and the constitutionality of \r\n  the ordinance banning flag lots and asserting a takings claim.Â  The circuit \r\n  court held the Board of Zoning Appeals committed no error of law in hearing \r\n  or processing their variance application.Â  It found ample evidence in the record \r\n  to support the Boardâ€™s denial of the variance.Â  The court found no merit to \r\n  the Hernandezesâ€™ contention that they were denied procedural and substantive \r\n  due process.Â  The court also rejected their argument that the Town zoning regulations \r\n  that exclude flag lots are unconstitutional.Â  The court held the new lot was \r\n  not entitled to grandfathered status.Â  Finally, in its amended order, the court \r\n  held the Hernandezesâ€™ takings issue was premature and dismissed it without prejudice.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in affirming \r\n  the decision of the Board.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denial of variance\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Local Government Comprehensive \r\n  Planning Enabling Act (Zoning Enabling Act) sets forth the standard of review \r\n  for appeals from local zoning boards of appeal:Â  â€œThe findings of fact by the \r\n  board of appeals must be treated in the same manner as a finding of fact by \r\n  a jury.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-840 (2004).Â  â€œIn determining the questions presented \r\n  by the appeal, the court must determine only whether the decision of the board \r\n  is correct as a matter of law.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, the factual findings of the \r\n  zoning board will not be disturbed unless there is no evidence in the record \r\n  to support its decision.Â  Heilker v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals for the City of \r\n  Beaufort, 346 S.C. 401, 406, 552 S.E.2d 42, 45Â  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nThe Zoning Enabling Act empowers the Board \r\n  â€œto hear and decide appeals for variance from the requirements of the zoning \r\n  ordinance when strict application of the provisions of the ordinance would result \r\n  in unnecessary hardship.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-800(2) (2004).Â  The Board may \r\n  grant such a variance upon making and explaining in writing the following factors:\r\n\r\n(a) there are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining \r\n  to the particular piece of property;\r\n(b) these conditions do not generally apply to other property \r\n  in the vicinity;\r\n(c) because of these conditions, the application of the ordinance \r\n  to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably \r\n  restrict the utilization of the property; and\r\n(d) the authorization of a variance will not be of substantial \r\n  detriment to adjacent property or to the public good, and the character of the \r\n  district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-800(2) (2004).Â  \r\nIn order to grant a variance, the Board must make \r\n  the factual determination that each of these four elements favors granting the \r\n  variance. Restaurant Row Assocs. v. Horry County, 335 S.C. 209, 215, \r\n  516 S.E.2d 442, 445 (1999).Â  â€œGranting a variance is an exceptional power which \r\n  should be sparingly exercised and can be validly used only where a situation \r\n  falls fully within the specified conditions.â€Â  Id. at 215, 516 S.E.2d \r\n  at 445-46. The party seeking the variance bears the burden of demonstrating \r\n  all four of the above elements.Â  Id. at 216, 516 S.E.2d at 446.Â  \r\nIn the present case, the Board held that although \r\n  the Hernandezes had met the first three elements of a variance, they had not \r\n  met their burden of establishing that the variance would not be a substantial \r\n  detriment to adjacent property or to the public good and the character of the \r\n  district would not be harmed by the granting of the variance.\r\nThe Hernandezes assert the Board erred in considering \r\n  the objections of the neighboring property owners. \r\n  [1] Â  We find no error in the Boardâ€™s consideration of this testimony.Â  \r\n  Section 6-29-800(2) requires the Board to determine whether the authorization \r\n  of a variance will be detrimental to adjacent property.Â  Accordingly, the neighborsâ€™ \r\n  testimony concerning the negative effect the granting of the variance would \r\n  have on their property values and the character of the district was relevant \r\n  to the Boardâ€™s consideration of this fourth element and was entitled to as much \r\n  weight as the Board deemed to accord it.Â  \r\nConsidering the entire record, we find \r\n  sufficient evidence to support the Boardâ€™s decision to deny the variance.Â  Testimony \r\n  from the adjacent property owners revealed concerns for drainage, overcrowding, \r\n  the loss of a substantial number of large trees, removal of yard debris, and \r\n  a negative effect on property values should the new lot be approved.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we hold the circuit court correctly affirmed the Boardâ€™s decision as evidence \r\n  exists in the record supporting the Boardâ€™s decision.\r\n\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violation of rights to due process and equal protection\r\n\r\nThe Hernandezes argue the proceedings below violated \r\n  their rights to due process and equal protection.Â  At oral argument, the Hernandezesâ€™ \r\n  counsel stated the Hernandezes were abandoning their challenges to the constitutionality \r\n  of the Zoning Enabling Act and the municipal ordinance banning flag lots and \r\n  proceeding only on their arguments that their rights were violated by the application \r\n  of the statute and ordinance in their case.Â  \r\nâ€œThe fundamental requirement of due process is \r\n  the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.â€ \r\n  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Beeks, 325 S.C. 243, 246, 481 \r\n  S.E.2d 703, 705 (1997).Â  â€œDue process is flexible and calls for such procedural \r\n  protections as the particular situation demands.â€Â  Stono River Envtl. Protection \r\n  Assâ€™n v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. Control, 305 S.C. 90, \r\n  94, 406 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1991).Â  The requirements of due process include notice, \r\n  an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful way, and judicial review.Â  German \r\n  Evangelical Lutheran Church of Charleston v. City of Charleston, 352 S.C. \r\n  600, 608, 576 S.E.2d 150, 154 (2003).\r\nThe Zoning Enabling Act sets forth the procedure \r\n  for a hearing before theÂ  Zoning Board of Appeals on a zoning variance request.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-800 (2004).Â  An appeal from the Boardâ€™s decision is to \r\n  the circuit court, which has appellate jurisdiction only.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ \r\n  6-29-820 and 6-29-840 (2004).Â  The circuit court may not take additional evidence.Â  \r\n  Â§ 6-29-840.Â  \r\nThe Hernandezes contend the hearing before the \r\n  Board was unfair.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe Hernandezes were provided with an opportunity \r\n  to be heard in a meaningful manner.Â  They were allowed to present their position \r\n  to the Board.Â  Furthermore, as found above, the Board did not err in allowing \r\n  the neighboring property owners to voice their objections to the variance request \r\n  as their concerns were relevant to the Boardâ€™s determination of whether the \r\n  request met all of the statutory factors necessary for the granting of a variance.Â  \r\n  The Hernandezes were also afforded judicial review by their appeal to the circuit \r\n  court.Â  We hold the Hernandezes received all of the procedural protections afforded \r\n  them under the Zoning Enabling Act.\r\nThe Hernandezes also raise another due process \r\n  issue by asserting that as the Hobcaw subdivision plat was approved prior to \r\n  the enactment of the flag lot ordinance, the ordinance should not be allowed \r\n  to deprive them of all economic use of the land. \r\n  [2] \r\nA landowner only acquires a vested right to continue \r\n  a nonconforming use if that use is already in existence at the time his property \r\n  is zoned.Â  Friarsgate, Inc. v. Town of Irmo, 290 S.C. 266, 269-70, 349 \r\n  S.E.2d 891, 893 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  â€œ[A] contemplated use of property by a landowner \r\n  on the date a zoning ordinance becomes effective to preclude such a use is not \r\n  protected as a nonconforming use.â€Â  Id. Â at 269, 349 S.E.2d at 893. \r\nAt the time the Town of Mt. Pleasant enacted the \r\n  ordinance prohibiting flag lots, the Hernandezesâ€™ property was considered one \r\n  lot and was in conformance with the ordinance.Â  The Hernandezes made no attempt \r\n  to subdivide their lot to create the nonconforming flag lot until after the \r\n  enactment of the ordinance.Â  Accordingly, as their use of the property as a \r\n  separate lot was at the most merely contemplated at the time of the enactment \r\n  of the ordinance, they are not entitled to any protection from enforcement of \r\n  the ordinance.Â  \r\nThe Hernandezes next assert \r\n  their rights to equal protection were violated by enforcement of the ordinance \r\n  prohibiting flag lots because although they are not being permitted to create \r\n  a flag lot, there are five flag lots in the immediate vicinity of their property.Â  \r\n  The record reveals, however, that these lots were all created either prior to \r\n  the area being annexed into the Town of Mt. Pleasant or prior to the enactment \r\n  of the ordinance prohibiting flag lots.Â  As such, this is not a case of disparate \r\n  treatment of similarly situated individuals.\r\nFinally, the Hernandezes \r\n  suggest they were denied the variance because Mr. Hernandez is Hispanic.Â  As \r\n  this issue was neither raised to nor ruled on by the circuit court, it is not \r\n  preserved for our review.Â  See Beaufort County v. Butler, 316 \r\n  S.C. 465, 468, 451 S.E.2d 386, 388 (1994) (stating constitutional claims must \r\n  be raised and ruled upon below to be preserved for appeal).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the \r\n  decision of the circuit court affirming the Boardâ€™s decision to deny the Hernandezesâ€™ \r\n  request for a variance is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and\r\nCURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1] Â  The Hernandezes cite to Boulevard Dev. and St. Johnâ€™s Inn v. \r\n    City of Myrtle Beach, Op. No. 2001-UP-091 (S.C. Ct.

Meyers, of Charleston and J. David Flowers, of Greenville, \r\n  for Appellants.Â  \r\nEdward R. Cole, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  John Doe, individually, and \r\n  as guardian for his minor sons, James and Jason Doe (the Does), and on behalf \r\n  of all others similarly situated, brought this action against Merle Batson alleging \r\n  she breached her duty to warn the Does of her sonâ€™s deviancy after several boys, \r\n  including James and Jason, reported that Batsonâ€™s son molested them in Batsonâ€™s \r\n  house. [1] Â  The circuit court \r\n  granted Batsonâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  The Does appeal.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [2] \r\nFACTS\r\nBatsonâ€™s son served as a youth minister \r\n  at the church James and Jason attended with their family.Â  He befriended a number \r\n  of teenage boys in the congregation and spent time with them outside of church-related \r\n  activities.Â  Eventually, he invited some of the boys, including James and Jason, \r\n  to visit and spend the night with him in his bedroom located in the basement \r\n  of Batsonâ€™s house.Â  It was during these visits that Batsonâ€™s son molested James \r\n  and Jason.Â  \r\nThe Does concede that Batson had no actual knowledge \r\n  of her sonâ€™s sexual deviancy until the charges became publicly known.Â  James \r\n  and Jason both testified their interaction with Batson was limited to some breakfasts \r\n  following overnight visits in her home.Â  Both boys testified they did not believe \r\n  she was suspicious of any sexual activity between them and her son.Â  Jason testified \r\n  he and Batsonâ€™s son sneaked into Batsonâ€™s sonâ€™s bedroom through an adjacent \r\n  storage room in the basement.Â  In another instance, Jason admitted to hiding \r\n  from Batson in her sonâ€™s bedroom and stated he did not believe she knew he was \r\n  in her house.Â  Eventually, the boys admitted the clandestine activities to their \r\n  parents.Â  \r\nThe Does brought this premises liability \r\n  action alleging Batson either expressly knew or should have known of her sonâ€™s \r\n  â€œdangerous propensities.â€Â  As such, they contend she breached her duty to appropriately \r\n  warn the Does.Â  The circuit court granted Batsonâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  On appeal, this court reversed the circuit court and remanded, finding the Does \r\n  were denied a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery.Â  Doe v. Batson, \r\n  338 S.C. 291, 525 S.E.2d 909 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The supreme court, after granting \r\n  certiorari, affirmed our decision to reverse and remand while vacating other \r\n  portions of the opinion.Â  Doe ex rel. Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 548 \r\n  S.E.2d 854 (2001).Â  On remand, the circuit court again granted Batsonâ€™s motion \r\n  for summary judgment.Â  The Does appeal.Â  We affirm.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Does contend the circuit court erred by ruling \r\n  Batson did not owe a duty of care to warn James or Jason of her sonâ€™s deviant \r\n  behavior.Â  They also assert the court erred in concluding that even if a duty \r\n  of care existed, they failed to prove Batson breached it as a matter of law.Â  \r\n  Finally, the Does contend summary judgment was improper because genuine issues \r\n  of material fact exist.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhen this court reviews the grant of a \r\n  motion for summary judgment, it applies the same standard of review that governs \r\n  the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Summary judgment is proper when, \r\n  viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there \r\n  is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.Â  Baril v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 279-80, \r\n  573 S.E.2d 830, 835 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nA landownerâ€™s duty toward a person depends \r\n  upon the personâ€™s status.Â  F. Patrick Hubbard &amp; Robert L. Felix, The \r\n  South Carolina Law of Torts 76 (1990).Â  The Does conceded James and Jason \r\n  were licensees for purposes of their premises liability claim against Batson.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, Batson owed James and Jason a duty to warn of any concealed dangerous \r\n  conditions or activities known to her, or of any change in the condition of \r\n  the premises that might have been dangerous to them, and which she may reasonably \r\n  have been expected to discover.Â  Neil v. Bynum, 288 S.C. 472, 473, 343 \r\n  S.E.2d 615, 616 (1986).Â  \r\nThe Does do not allege Batson had direct \r\n  knowledge that the boys were being molested.Â  Rather, they attempt to create \r\n  genuine issues of material fact regarding whether she knew the boys were spending \r\n  the night with her son on a regular basis by citing instances when Batson saw \r\n  the boys in or around her home.Â  The Does note Batson saw the boys with their \r\n  sleeping bags on one visit and during a few breakfasts following overnight stays. \r\n  Â Jason testified that on one occasion Batson gave him a package of pop-tarts.Â  \r\n  James testified Batson saw him eating breakfast on several occasions.Â  However, \r\n  there was no evidence that Batsonâ€™s son was present during any of these encounters.Â  \r\n  Batson testified she had seen James and Jason in her house on two occasions \r\n  and, although she saw them with their sleeping bags, she had â€œno earthly idea \r\n  what their sleeping arrangements were.â€Â  \r\nThe Does also claim Batson once saw Jason and her \r\n  son sitting in her sonâ€™s car in her driveway at night.Â  Jason testified that \r\n  after Batson saw him and her son in the driveway, they drove away, only to return \r\n  later and sneak into Batsonâ€™s house through a basement entrance. Â These casual \r\n  encounters suggest only that Batson knew of the boysâ€™ presence in or around \r\n  her house.Â  They do not suggest any unusual activity that would have alerted \r\n  Batson to any deviant behavior by her son.Â  \r\nMore significantly, both James and Jason testified \r\n  they did not believe Batson knew about her sonâ€™s sexual activities with them, \r\n  and there is evidence suggesting they actively prevented her from discovering \r\n  them.Â  The boys sneaked into the sonâ€™s room through an adjacent storage room \r\n  in the basement.Â  Jason admitted hiding from Batson in another instance, and \r\n  stated he did not believe she knew he was in her house.Â  \r\nBatson had no duty to warn the boys of a danger \r\n  of which she was unaware.Â  Under these facts, we conclude Batson had neither \r\n  actual nor constructive notice her son posed a danger to James or Jason.Â  Without \r\n  notice, she could not have been reasonably expected to discover the deviant \r\n  activity clandestinely occurring in her sonâ€™s basement room.Â  As such, we find \r\n  no duty was created and no genuine issues of material fact were left in dispute.Â  \r\n  In light of our determination Batson had no duty to James or Jason, we need \r\n  not address the Doesâ€™ claim of breach of duty.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  The circuit court noted the Does filed but did not pursue \r\n    a motion to certify this action as a class action.Â  Further, the Doesâ€™ deposition \r\n    testimony revealed there were no other participants in the putative class.Â  \r\n    We agree with the circuit court this is not a class action. In any event, \r\n    the Does have abandoned their attempt to obtain class certification. Â \r\n\r\n \r\n    [2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this \r\n    case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-336","title":"Clayton v.

Lee, Amy Anderson Wise and Samuel F. Arthur, III, all of Florence, \r\n  for Appellant,\r\nErvin Lindsay Blanks, of N. Charleston and James Edward Bell, III, of Sumter, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This appeal arises from a jury \r\n  verdict for actual and punitive damages in favor of Respondent Janet Clayton.Â  \r\n  The circuit court denied Appellant Lands Innsâ€™ motions for a judgment \r\n  notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), new trial absolute, and new trial nisi \r\n  remittitur.Â Â  Lands Inn appeals on the basis that the verdict was the \r\n  result of passion, caprice and prejudice. \r\n  [1] Â  We affirm.\r\nClayton worked as a resident hotel manager for \r\n  Lands Inn from 1992 until she was fired in 1996.Â  Robert Bowen, the executive \r\n  housekeeper at the hotel, believed that his job was in jeopardy.Â  Bowen, in \r\n  an effort to ingratiate himself with Richard Johnston, a Lands Inn supervisor, \r\n  informed Johnston that Clayton had been underreporting the number of rooms rented \r\n  and keeping money from those rooms. \r\nPursuant to information supplied by Bowen, Johnston \r\n  compared the record of rooms cleaned each day to the information submitted by \r\n  Clayton reporting how many rooms were rented each day.Â  Undiscovered by Johnston \r\n  was the fact that Bowen dated rooms cleaned on the day prior to the actual cleaning.Â  \r\n  This caused the comparison of records to show inconsistencies that, in fact, \r\n  did not exist.Â  Lands Inn, through Johnston, acted on this false information \r\n  and caused Clayton to be arrested for theft in July 1996.\r\nClayton hired an attorney in connection with the \r\n  criminal charge. She was denied unemployment benefits after Lands Inn reported \r\n  that she had been terminated for theft.Â  Clayton was unable to find a job until \r\n  seven months later when she took a lesser paying job as a hotel telephone operator.Â  \r\n  During this time, Clayton had to borrow money from family and had two cars repossessed.Â  \r\n  Also, at least two friends who called the hotel and asked for Clayton were told \r\n  that she had been terminated for theft.Â  The criminal charge was dismissed in \r\n  March 1997.Â  \r\nClayton brought an action against Lands \r\n  Inn for negligence, slander, and malicious prosecution.Â  At trial, Lands Inn \r\n  admitted its error and conceded there existed no basis for the theft charge \r\n  against Clayton.Â  Linda Jones, an accountant for Lands Inn, acknowledged that \r\n  Lands Inn made a â€œterrible mistake.â€\r\nPrior to reaching a verdict, the jurors requested \r\n  and were given written instructions on the difference between actual and punitive \r\n  damages.Â  A second note inquired if Lands Inn could delay payment of its award \r\n  pending appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      THE\r\n        COURT:\r\n       The jury has sent out a note:Â  If we award \r\n  actual and punitive damages, can the defendant delay payment on both awards \r\n  pending appeal?Â  Signed by foreperson.\r\n        I have shared this with counsel.Â  And the response that is \r\n  going to be written on the note by consent is, this is not an issue that is \r\n  proper for your consideration.Â  Is that acceptable to everyone?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      All counsel responded,&nbsp;\r\n       â€œYes.â€\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe court then, with the consent of the parties, \r\n  responded with a note that instructed the jury that this was not a proper issue \r\n  for their consideration.\r\nAfter a verdict for actual damages of $500,000 \r\n  and punitive damages of $750,000 was returned, Lands Inn moved for judgment \r\n  notwithstanding the verdict, new trial absolute, and alternatively, a new trial \r\n  nisi remittitur.Â  The motions were denied, as was Lands Innsâ€™ motion \r\n  for reconsideration.Â  Lands Inn appeals, arguing that the circuit court abused \r\n  its discretion by denying the motion for a new trial absolute because the jury \r\n  exceeded its authority by inquiring if payment of a potential verdict might \r\n  be delayed upon appeal.Â  This issue, however, was not raised in the trial court.\r\nIn its post-trial motions, Lands Inn claimed the \r\n  damage awards were grossly excessive, and moved â€œfor a new trial absolute on \r\n  the basis that the jury was clearly motivated by passion, caprice, prejudice, \r\n  whatsoever, as the court knows all the terminology there.â€Â  Lands Inn raised \r\n  no challenge in connection with the purportedly prejudicial jury note.Â  Thus, \r\n  the sole ground asserted on appeal was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the \r\n  trial court.Â  This issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Holy Loch \r\n  Distribs., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282 (2000) (â€œIn \r\n  order to preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised \r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).Â  Lands Innâ€™s generic motion simply \r\n  cannot be construed to encompass the precise ground asserted on appeal.Â  See \r\n  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (stating \r\n  â€œan objection must be sufficiently specific to inform the trial court of the \r\n  point being urged by the objector.â€).\r\nMoreover, considering the challenge to the verdict \r\n  as grossly excessive, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s denial \r\n  of Lands Innâ€™s motion for a new trial absolute.Â  The record reveals that Clayton \r\n  sustained substantial harm from Lands Innâ€™s egregious conduct.Â  We conclude, \r\n  as did the trial court, that the juryâ€™s verdict was not the result of passion, \r\n  caprice, prejudice or other improper factors.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the judgment of the circuit court \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Lands Innâ€™s appellate counsel did not represent Lands \r\n    Inn at trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-337","title":"Brinson v.

Hummel, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nF. Earl Ellis, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Mary Ann Brinson appeals an \r\n  order of the circuit court affirming the decision of an appellate panel of the \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission denying her claim for compensation.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBrinson was employed as a housekeeper \r\n  by Lexington Medical Center from July 1994 to August 2000.Â  For the last year \r\n  and half of her employment, she experienced increasing degrees of pain in her \r\n  hands and fingers.Â  She consequently terminated her employment with the hospital.Â  \r\n  She was subsequently diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands.Â  It \r\n  was Brinsonâ€™s opinion that this injury was a direct result of her employment \r\n  with Lexington Medical Center.Â  \r\nBrinson filed a claim for workersâ€™\r\ncompensation with her former employer, which was denied.&nbsp; She appealed this\r\ndenial to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission and was granted a hearing before \r\n  a single commissioner.Â  Brinson claimed that her duties at Lexington Medical \r\n  Center, namely the multiple tasks she performed with her hands in cleaning approximately \r\n  twenty-three rooms on a daily basis, had caused her injury. \r\n  [1] Â  It was revealed at the hearing, however, that Brinson had a long time \r\n  hobby of cross-stitching and needlepoint, which she had enjoyed for over twenty \r\n  years.Â  While Brinson at one point in the hearing claimed that she had ceased \r\n  this activity years prior to 1994, the record also reflects Brinsonâ€™s contradictory \r\n  admission that she continued needlepoint during her employment with Lexington \r\n  Medical Center.Â  In her deposition, Brinson claimed that she did not stop her \r\n  needlework until well after gaining employment with Lexington Medical Center, \r\n  when pain made it impossible to enjoy the hobby.Â  \r\nAlthough treated by two specialists \r\n  in the area of carpal tunnel syndrome, Brinson presented only the testimony \r\n  of her chiropractor at the hearing to support the view that her injury was caused \r\n  by her employment.Â  The chiropractor acknowledged, however, that the carpal \r\n  tunnel syndrome could have been brought about by her years of needlework.Â  Â Â \r\nThe single commissioner concluded Brinsonâ€™s \r\n  carpal tunnel syndrome was not the result of an injury by accident arising out \r\n  of and in the course of her employment pursuant to South Carolina Code section \r\n  42-1-160 (Supp. 2003).Â  Brinsonâ€™s request for compensation was denied.Â  An appellate \r\n  panel of the Commission upheld the denial of Brinsonâ€™s claim, and the circuit \r\n  court affirmed.Â  The circuit court determined there was substantial evidence \r\n  to support the decision of the Commission.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures \r\n  Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2003), establishes the standard \r\n  of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission \r\n  as the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. \r\n  130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  The factual findings of the agency are \r\n  presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  \r\n  Kearse v. State Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 198, \r\n  200, 456 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1995).Â  Substantial evidence is evidence that, when \r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the \r\n  conclusion the Commission reached.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 \r\n  S.C. 154, 160, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999); McGuffin v. Schlumberger-Sangamo, \r\n  307 S.C. 184, 186, 414 S.E.2d 162, 163 (1992).Â  â€œThe possibility of drawing \r\n  two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the commissionâ€™s \r\n  findings from being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Oâ€™Banner v. Westinghouse \r\n  Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24, 30, 459 S.E.2d 324, 327-28 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\nPursuant to this standard, \r\n  the reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission \r\n  as to questions of fact (so long as such judgment is supported by substantial \r\n  evidence), and may only reverse if the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (A)(6) (Supp. 2003); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., \r\n  324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App 1996).Â  The issue of whether there \r\n  is a causal connection between the claimantâ€™s employment and their injury is \r\n  a question of fact.Â  Sharpe, 336 S.C. at 159, 519 S.E.2d at 105; see \r\n  also Rhodes v. Guignard Brick Works, 245 S.C. 304, 311, 140 S.E.2d \r\n  487, 490 (1965).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBrinson contends the decision \r\n  of the Commission was based on an error of law.Â  We disagree.\r\nBrinson cites Pee v. \r\n  AVM, Inc., 352 S.C. 167, 573 S.E.2d 785 (2002), for the proposition that \r\n  an injury caused by repetitive trauma may constitute â€œinjury by accidentâ€ under \r\n  the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. \r\n  2003).Â  Pursuant to this holding, she asserts legal error by the Commission \r\n  in excluding â€œmultiple task repetitive traumaâ€ from the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act.Â  We agree with Brinson that it is undecided in this state whether such \r\n  varying activities, as she performed at Lexington Medical Center, may constitute \r\n  â€œrepetitive traumaâ€ under the Pee v. AVM holding.Â  Brinson, however, \r\n  misconstrues the basis of the Commissionâ€™s denial of her claim, for the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  decision is fact-based.Â  \r\nThe Commission affirmed \r\n  the decision of the single commissioner by adopting her complete order by reference.Â  \r\n  The single commissioner based her decision to deny Brinson compensation on the \r\n  factual finding that the injury was not caused by Brinsonâ€™s employment. The \r\n  commissioner found the testimony of Brinsonâ€™s chiropractor lacking in credibility.Â  \r\n  The commissioner also noted that Brinsonâ€™s needlework hobby of over twenty years \r\n  did involve such motions.Â  The commissioner did not exclude as a matter of law \r\n  activities like those required by Brinsonâ€™s employment from the possible legal \r\n  causes of carpal tunnel syndrome, for she merely found, as a factual determination, \r\n  that in this particular case a much more likely cause was Brinsonâ€™s twenty year \r\n  needlework hobby.Â Â  This was solely a factual determination of whether there \r\n  was any causal connection between Brinsonâ€™s employment and her injury.Â  See \r\n  Sharpe, 336 S.C. at 159-160, 519 S.E.2d at 105.Â  \r\nSince the decision to deny \r\n  Brinson compensation was determined exclusively on the factual issue of causation, \r\n  we have only to determine whether substantial evidence supports the ruling.Â  \r\n  We find substantial evidence exists on record to find Brinsonâ€™s carpal tunnel \r\n  syndrome is not the result of an injury by accident arising out of and in the \r\n  course of her employment.Â  As discussed above, the commissioner heard evidence \r\n  of two possible causes of Brinsonâ€™s injury, her employment and her needlepoint.Â  \r\n  â€œWhen evidence is in conflict, someone has to determine the true facts [and] \r\n  [t]hat chore is assigned to the Workerâ€™s Compensation Commission.â€Â  Fair \r\n  v. Fluor Daniel, 309 S.C. 520, 521, 424 S.E.2d 541, 542 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\n  Given the testimony of the chiropractor that either activity could have caused \r\n  Brinsonâ€™s injury, Brinsonâ€™s testimony as to her needlework, and the non-specific \r\n  descriptions of her work-related activities, there was substantial evidence \r\n  to deny Brinson compensation.\r\nBrinson also points out \r\n  on appeal that, even if her injuries were caused by the needlepoint, an accident \r\n  that accelerates or aggravates a preexisting condition is still compensable.Â  \r\n  Brown v. R.L. Jordan Oil Co., 291 S.C. 272, 275, 353 S.E.2d 280, 282 \r\n  (1987).Â Â  While this is a correct assertion, one must also note â€œa condition \r\n  due solely to natural progression of a preexisting [injury] is not compensable.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Brinson did not raise the issue of aggravated injury at any level \r\n  below and offered no evidence on record as to the degree of possible aggravation \r\n  as opposed to natural progression.Â  She instead sought to gain full compensation \r\n  by arguing her injury was wholly caused by her employment with Lexington Medical \r\n  Center.Â  As such, the issue of aggravation is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\n  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the \r\n  first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial \r\n  court to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\nIn a claim for compensation brought under the Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Act, â€œ[t]he burden is on the claimant to prove such facts as will \r\n  render the injury compensable, and such an award must not be based on surmise, \r\n  conjecture or speculation.â€Â  Crosby v. Wal-Mart Store, Inc., 330 S.C. \r\n  489, 496, 499 S.E.2d 253, 257 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Here, substantial evidence supports \r\n  the Commissionâ€™s determination that Brinson failed to meet this burden.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the \r\n  circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  These duties included wiping off tables, dusting lamps, refilling \r\n    paper towels and soap dispensers, emptying trash, mopping floors, and cleaning \r\n    sinks and toilets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-338","title":"Whitsett Corp. v.

Hudgens, of Newberry, and Warner R. Wilson, Jr., \r\n  of Atlanta, for Appellant.Â  \r\nBoyd B. Nicholson, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lynn Whitsett Corporation brought \r\n  this action against Norbord South Carolina, Inc. and Callidus Technologies, \r\n  Inc. for breach of contract, foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien, and quantum meruit.Â  \r\n  Callidus counterclaimed for breach of contract and breach of warranties.Â  The \r\n  trial court found for Lynn Whitsett on its breach of contract claim, but concluded \r\n  Callidus was entitled to an offset for delays and recovery on its breach of \r\n  warranties claims.Â  The resulting net judgment was in favor of Callidus.Â  Lynn \r\n  Whitsett appeals.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\nNorbord hired Callidus as its \r\n  general contractor to build a pressboard plant.Â  Callidus subcontracted with \r\n  Lynn Whitsett to install ceramic refractory materials to the walls of Norbordâ€™s \r\n  kilns.Â  Lynn Whitsettâ€™s contract contained a fixed price for the installation \r\n  project.Â  However, in the event of a change in the scope of the work, the contract \r\n  converted to one based on time and materials.Â  It also stated Callidus would \r\n  provide a particular type of refractory material to be used in the installation.Â  \r\n  Instead, Callidus supplied a slightly different product.Â  Lynn Whitsett applied \r\n  the ceramics using a gunning crew to spray them onto the kiln walls and a casting \r\n  crew to pour the material into prepared forms.Â  Delays arose when the refractory \r\n  material did not set up properly with the result that the entire application \r\n  process took fifteen weeks instead of the eight weeks stated in the contract.Â  \r\n\r\nLynn Whitsett claimed it was owed $84,472.20 under \r\n  the contract because the application required significant extra labor.Â  When \r\n  Callidus refused to pay, Lynn Whitsett brought this action.Â  Callidus filed \r\n  a bond to discharge the mechanicâ€™s lien and agreed to indemnify Norbord for \r\n  any amounts due Lynn Whitsett.&nbsp; \r\nLynn Whitsett amended its complaint to \r\n  argue the scope of its work had been increased because Callidus supplied a different \r\n  refractory material than had been proposed in the contract.Â  Lynn Whitsett claimed \r\n  this change converted the contract from one with a fixed price to one based \r\n  on time and materials.Â  Callidus counterclaimed alleging breach of express and \r\n  implied warranties based on faulty workmanship.Â  \r\nThe trial court agreed with Lynn Whitsett \r\n  that the contract was converted from a lump sum payment to one based on time \r\n  and materials with a balance due of $272,498.60.Â  However, the court determined \r\n  Lynn Whitsett was responsible for four weeks of delays and gave Callidus a substantial \r\n  setoff of $179,307.12.Â  The court also found Lynn Whitsett breached implied \r\n  and express warranties and set damages at $114,342.79, finally awarding judgment \r\n  for Callidus in the amount of $21,151.31.Â  Based on these findings, the court \r\n  concluded Callidus prevailed in the mechanicâ€™s lien action and awarded attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees in the amount of $71,714.41.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAn action for breach of contract seeking \r\n  money damages is an action at law.Â  Sterling Dev. Co. v. Collins, 309 \r\n  S.C. 237, 240, 421 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1992).Â  An action to foreclose a mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien is also an action at law.Â  Adams v. B &amp; D, Inc., 297 S.C. 416, \r\n  420, 377 S.E.2d 315, 317 (1989).Â  In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried \r\n  without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon \r\n  appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports those findings.Â  \r\n  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, \r\n  775 (1976).Â  \r\nI.Â  Four-Week Delay\r\nLynn Whitsett contends \r\n  the trial court erred by granting Callidus a set-off after determining Lynn \r\n  Whitsett was responsible for a four-week delay in completing its work.Â  Lynn \r\n  Whitsett claims there is no evidence in the record to support the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  conclusion, and maintains Callidus caused the delays by supplying substitute \r\n  refractory materials and by failing to properly prepare and install items prior \r\n  to the application of the ceramics.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nOn appeal, this court cannot \r\n  weigh conflicting evidence in a law case.Â  Only if there is no conflicting evidence \r\n  may we find error as a matter of law.Â  Hibernian Socâ€™y v. Thomas, 282 \r\n  S.C. 465, 469, 319 S.E.2d 339, 342 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Although the record contains \r\n  evidence that Callidus may have been responsible for some delays, it also contains \r\n  evidence that Lynn Whitsett caused the four-week delay.Â  In a letter to Callidus \r\n  with the heading â€œSubject:Â  Explanation for extra work invoice,â€ beneath a subsection \r\n  marked â€œOther problems that caused delays or additional work:â€ a Lynn Whitsett \r\n  representative wrote: \r\n\r\nIt was never Lynn Whitsettâ€™s intention \r\n  to cast the SCC in any other method but to pump them.Â  This was an oversight \r\n  on my part when I read the SK-1 sheet that you sent me before starting of \r\n  this job that stated that Kricon 28 would be used.Â  I assumed after other conversations \r\n  that I had with you and Elton, that pumping of the SCC was the only cost effective \r\n  way of installation.Â  This will require an additional four weeks of work \r\n  to do this in the manner that you want it, one bucket at a time.Â  Again, this \r\n  was not quoted that way.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\nWhen questioned about the letter \r\n  during cross examination, the representative admitted his oversight caused the \r\n  delay.Â  Accordingly, we conclude there was evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  finding that Lynn Whitsett was responsible for four weeks of the delay and the \r\n  corresponding award of a set-off in favor of Callidus.&nbsp; \r\nII.Â  Calculating \r\n  the Set-off Amount\r\nLynn Whitsett further contends \r\n  the amount of the set-off is unsupported by the evidence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe evidence supporting a damages \r\n  award should be such that the court can determine the amount with reasonable \r\n  certainty or accuracy.Â  See Gray v. Southern Facilities, Inc., 256 S.C. \r\n  558, 570, 183 S.E.2d 438, 444 (1971).Â  However, proof to a mathematical certainty \r\n  of the amount of loss or damage is not required.Â  Whisenant v. James Island \r\n  Corp., 277 S.C. 10, 13, 281 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1981).Â  \r\nIn making the set-off award of \r\n  $179,307.12, the trial court relied on Lynn Whitsettâ€™s own exhibit detailing \r\n  three weeks of estimated labor costs for one of its crews.Â  The total cost came \r\n  to $138,938.16 or, by extrapolation, as much as $185,250.88 for four weeks.Â  \r\n  Lynn Whitsett contends this reliance was misplaced because the exhibit details \r\n  costs for a gunning crew and not a casting crew of the sort used during the \r\n  four-week delay.Â  This distinction is insignificant.Â  Both crews were engaged \r\n  in the same tasks and employed nearly the same number of men, with a gunning \r\n  crew employing eight and a casting crew eight or nine.Â  As such, we find the \r\n  trial court properly considered Lynn Whitsettâ€™s exhibit as evidence in determining \r\n  the amount of the set-off.Â  \r\nAdditionally, we note Lynn Whitsett \r\n  estimated its total cost for the full 15 to 16 weeks at $670,112.60.Â  A four-week \r\n  delay would then equate to between $167,528.16 and $178,696.68.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find the evidence presented amply supports the set-off amount of $179,307.12.Â  \r\n\r\nIII.Â  Breach of \r\n  Express Warranty\r\nLynn Whitsett contends the trial \r\n  court erred by awarding Callidus damages on its counterclaim for breach of express \r\n  warranty.Â  It insists the contractâ€™s warranty provision applied exclusively \r\n  to goods purchased through the purchase order and did not cover the installation \r\n  of the ceramic refractory material.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn express warranty is created when a seller makes \r\n  an affirmation or promise to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes \r\n  part of the basis for the bargain that those goods will conform to the affirmation \r\n  or promise.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-102 (2003) (stating the UCC applies \r\n  to transactions in goods); see also Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship, \r\n  312 S.C. 102, 105, 439 S.E.2d 283, 284 (Ct. App. 1993) (â€œA warranty is created \r\n  when the seller makes an affirmation with respect to the thing to be sold with \r\n  the intention that the buyer shall rely on it in making the purchase.â€) (citation \r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nThe contractâ€™s warranty provision defined \r\n  â€œgoodsâ€ to mean â€œthe goods described in this Purchase Order or any amendment \r\n  hereto . . . and also include[d] any work or services performed under the \r\n  Contract by Supplier or any of its subcontractors in connection with or incidental \r\n  to Goods.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  We read this language to extend the coverage \r\n  of the express warranty beyond the raw materials to include the installation \r\n  of the refractory material.Â  \r\nAn engineer testified the ceramic refractory \r\n  material installed by Lynn Whitsett should last at least one year if not two \r\n  or three.Â  One month after the kilns began operating, the refractory material \r\n  began to separate from the kiln walls.Â  Norbord immediately began testing to \r\n  determine the cause.Â  Within five months, enough refractory material had dislodged \r\n  that Lynn Whitsett, at Callidusâ€™ request, returned to perform repairs.Â  However, \r\n  refractory material continued to come out of the kilns.Â  Callidus again asked \r\n  for repairs in January and May of 2001.Â  Lynn Whitsett refused, and another \r\n  company ultimately completed the work.Â  \r\nBased on our reading of the warranty provision, \r\n  we find Lynn Whitsett expressly warranted any work or services performed under \r\n  the contract including the installation of the refractory material.Â  As such, \r\n  Lynn Whitsett breached its express warranty when it refused to correct defective \r\n  installation and make repairs on Norbordâ€™s kilns in January and May of 2001. [2] \r\nIV.Â  Calculation of Damages\r\nLynn Whitsett also argues \r\n  that even if we determine it breached warranties to Callidus, there was no competent \r\n  evidence to support the amount of the damages award.Â  Lynn Whitsett contends \r\n  the repair invoices the court relied on to calculate damages were not properly \r\n  identified by either the service provider or the recipient payor.Â  As such, \r\n  Lynn Whitsett asserts they were inadmissible hearsay.Â  This issue is not preserved \r\n  for our review.Â  \r\n&nbsp;Callidus produced two invoices from Larkin Furnace, \r\n  the company that ultimately completed the kiln repairs, as evidence to support \r\n  its claim for damages arising from Lynn Whitsettâ€™s breach of express and implied \r\n  warranties.Â  Norbord paid the invoices, but was fully reimbursed by Callidus.Â  \r\n  At trial, Dick Liniger, an engineer for Callidus, explained the invoices.Â  \r\nWhen the invoices were offered into evidence, \r\n  Lynn Whitsett objected on the ground there was no causal link established between \r\n  the work it performed and the need for repairs.Â  After additional testimony \r\n  from Liniger, the court admitted the invoices into evidence.Â  Lynn Whitsett \r\n  did not object to the invoices as hearsay.Â  Neither was there an objection that \r\n  Liniger was not the appropriate person to testify to the content of the invoices \r\n  or the necessity of the repairs.Â  Lynn Whitsett raised this objection for the \r\n  first time in its motion to alter or amend.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not \r\n  preserved for our review.Â  Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 \r\n  S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding a party cannot raise an issue by way \r\n  of a Rule 59(e) motion which may have been raised at trial).Â  \r\nV.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nFinally, Lynn Whitsett contends that \r\n  but for the errors in the trial courtâ€™s order, it would be the prevailing party \r\n  and, consequently, the attorneyâ€™s fees award should be reversed in its favor.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nLynn Whitsettâ€™s argument is dependent \r\n  on a determination it prevailed on its remaining causes of action.Â  Under our \r\n  analysis, Callidus remains the prevailing party and is, therefore, entitled \r\n  to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Lynn Whitsett also appeals the trial courtâ€™s conclusion \r\n    that it breached an implied warranty.Â  However, we need not address this issue \r\n    in light of our determination that Lynn Whitsett breached an express warranty \r\n    created by the contract.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-339","title":"Shaffer v.

Neal, \r\n  III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nDeborah Harrison Sheffield, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  George A. Sowell (Husband) \r\n  appeals from the family court judgeâ€™s modification of a spousal support award \r\n  to Mayme Gust Sowell (Wife).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nHusband\r\nand Wife were divorced in September 1983, after 27 years of marriage.&nbsp;\r\nAt the time of the divorce,\r\nHusband was 53 years old and employed as a physician, while Wife was 48 years\r\nold and unemployed.&nbsp; After\r\nconsidering the various appropriate factors, the court ordered Husband to pay\r\nalimony to Wife in the amount of $3,000 per month.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nTen\r\nyears later, in December 1993, Husband brought an action to reduce Wifeâ€™s\r\nalimony award.&nbsp; On January 20, 1994,\r\nthe parties entered into a consent order in which Wifeâ€™s alimony award would\r\nbe reduced and the amount of the reduction held in abeyance pending her\r\nremarriage.&nbsp; The amount held in\r\nabeyance was then to be paid to Wife when she remarried, at which time\r\nHusbandâ€™s alimony obligation would end.&nbsp; Wifeâ€™s\r\nremarriage, however, did not occur.&nbsp; Thereafter,\r\nin May 1994, Husband filed an amended complaint seeking a reduction, suspension\r\nor termination of the alimony payments based upon an alleged substantial change\r\nin the partiesâ€™ financial conditions.&nbsp; A\r\nhearing was held on the matter in August 1996.&nbsp;\r\nAt that time, Husband alleged he had diluted his income due to his\r\nadvancing age and his inability to continue to work the number of hours he\r\npreviously worked in his medical practice.&nbsp;\r\nHe further alleged he had â€œreduced and plan[ned] to eliminate his\r\nobstetrical practice.â€&nbsp; On October\r\n10, 1996, the family court judge issued an order maintaining the monthly $3000\r\nalimony award.&nbsp; The judge found\r\nHusbandâ€™s reduction in income was insufficient to warrant a reduction in\r\nalimony.&nbsp; Specifically, he found the\r\nreduction in Husbandâ€™s income was contemplated by him inasmuch as Husband\r\ntestified he anticipated reducing his hours as he approached retirement.&nbsp;\r\nThe judge further found Husband anticipated use of his retirement funds\r\nto supplement his reduced income.&nbsp; The\r\nfamily court judge found Husbandâ€™s reduction in income should have been\r\nanticipated by the parties at the time of the alimony award in 1983.&nbsp;\r\n  In August 2001, Husband filed another \r\n    action seeking a reduction in the $3,000 alimony award.Â  Husband sought this \r\n    change in his support obligation based on both his reduction of income and \r\n    Wifeâ€™s improved financial condition.Â  After a hearing, the family court judge \r\n    issued an order reducing the alimony award from $3000 per month to $2000 per \r\n    month.Â  The judge noted Husbandâ€™s net worth had decreased from $1,076,000 \r\n    in 1996 to $925,000 in 2002, as he withdrew his retirement to supplement his \r\n    income, while Wifeâ€™s net worth increased from $492,000 in 1996 to $865,000 \r\n    in 2002. [1] Â  However, he determined \r\n    Husbandâ€™s retirement was foreseeable and within the purview of the parties.Â  \r\n    On the other hand, he found fluctuations in the stock market were not anticipated, \r\n    and Wifeâ€™s substantially changed financial condition resulting from fortuitous \r\n    investments warranted a modification in alimony.Â  The judge found both parties \r\n    were well represented and both had positions of merit.Â  He therefore denied \r\n    attorneyâ€™s fees for either party.Â  The family court judge subsequently denied \r\n    Husbandâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  \r\n  Husband appeals, arguing the family court judge \r\n    erred in making certain findings concerning his financial condition, and in \r\n    failing to further reduce or eliminate his alimony obligation.Â  He further \r\n    asserts error in the denial of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n  STANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n    In appeals from the family court, \r\n      this court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own \r\n      view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, \r\n      307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review \r\n      does not, however, require this court to disregard the findings of the family \r\n      court.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, \r\n      369 (2002).Â  Rather, because the family court is in a superior position \r\n      to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given \r\n      broad discretion.Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d \r\n      620, 623 (2003).Â Â  \r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nModification of Alimony Award\r\n         Husband argues that, in determining \r\n          the amount to reduce the alimony award, the family court judge committed \r\n          reversible error in including the valuation of a life insurance policy \r\n          as well as Husbandâ€™s current wifeâ€™s interest in their marital home in \r\n          the value of Husbandâ€™s assets.Â  Husband also argues the family court \r\n          judge erred in failing to either further reduce or terminate the alimony \r\n          award.Â  We disagree.\r\n        Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Life insurance policy\r\n        Husband argues the family court judge erred \r\n          in including the value of a life insurance policy in determining his \r\n          assets.Â  Specifically, Husband argues the policy should not have been \r\n          considered because it is the subject of an irrevocable trust and he \r\n          has no access to the funds.\r\n        It is undisputed that in 1985, \r\n          Husband placed certain life insurance policies in a trust for the benefit \r\n          of his children.Â  In determining Husbandâ€™s net worth to have decreased \r\n          from $1,076,000 in 1996 to $925,000 in 2002, the family court judge \r\n          stated he included $80,000 for the cash value of life insurance in the \r\n          $925,000 figure.Â  The judge recognized Husband testified â€œthis money \r\n          was placed into an Irrevocable Unfunded Life Insurance Trust for his \r\n          children prior to the 1996 hearing to which he has no access to withdraw \r\n          funds.â€Â  However, the judge stated his inclusion of this policy was \r\n          merely for comparison purposes, as Husband had included the value of \r\n          this policy on his 1996 financial declaration.Â  \r\n        We find the family court judge \r\n          properly considered the $80,000 cash value of the life insurance policy \r\n          when determining Husbandâ€™s 2002 net worth inasmuch as Husband had included \r\n          this figure on his 1996 financial declaration, even though he had transferred \r\n          this policy to the trust prior to 1996.Â  Therefore, as stated by the \r\n          judge in the final order, the inclusion of the cash value of the policy \r\n          in the instant case was merely to compare Husbandâ€™s current financial \r\n          situation with his 1996 finances.Â  The family court judge could not \r\n          properly compare the change in Husbandâ€™s financial condition without \r\n          including this same asset as listed on his 1996 financial declaration.Â  \r\n        \r\n\r\n          B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Â Â Â  Interest in marital home\r\n\r\n        Husband argues the family court judge erred \r\n          in including the full value of his home, including his current wifeâ€™s \r\n          one-half interest in the home, in determining his assets.Â  \r\n        In determining Husbandâ€™s current \r\n          net worth, the family court judge considered Husbandâ€™s interest in his \r\n          marital home to be 100 percent.Â  Akin to the situation with the life \r\n          insurance policy, however, the judge stated the inclusion of the marital \r\n          home in the calculation of Husbandâ€™s net worth was â€œsolely for the purpose \r\n          of comparison.â€Â  \r\n        The record shows that in May \r\n          2001, Husband transferred a one-half interest in his home to his current \r\n          wife.Â  Husband testified his wife did not pay him anything for this \r\n          transfer of interest.Â  Similar to our findings regarding the inclusion \r\n          of the life insurance policy when determining Husbandâ€™s current net \r\n          worth, we find the family court judge properly considered the full value \r\n          of Husbandâ€™s current marital home.Â  The full value of his home was listed \r\n          on Husbandâ€™s 1996 financial declaration; thus the family court was within \r\n          its discretion in taking into account the full value of the home in \r\n          determining whether there was a change in circumstances.Â  This is especially \r\n          true as the family court judge noted he included the home â€œsolely for \r\n          the purpose of comparison.â€ [2] \r\n        Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  C.Â Â Â Â Â  Further reduction \r\n          or termination of alimony\r\n        Husband also argues the family \r\n          court judge erred in failing to further reduce or terminate Wifeâ€™s alimony \r\n          award.Â  He contends Wife no longer has a need, or at least not a significant \r\n          need, for alimony, and he is no longer in a position to pay it. \r\n          [3] \r\n        An award of periodic alimony may be modified \r\n          based on a change of circumstances pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 \r\n          (1985). In order to justify modification or termination of an alimony \r\n          award, the changes in circumstances must be substantial or material.Â  \r\n          Eubank v. Eubank, 347 S.C. 367, 372, 555 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. \r\n          App. 2001) (citing Thornton v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 111, 492 \r\n          S.E.2d 86, 94 (1997)).Â  Further, the change in circumstances must be \r\n          unanticipated.Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 486, 477 S.E.2d \r\n          727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Several considerations relevant to the initial \r\n          setting of an alimony award may be applied in the modification context \r\n          as well, including the partiesâ€™ standard of living during the marriage, \r\n          each partyâ€™s earning capacity, and the supporting spouseâ€™s ability to \r\n          continue to support the other spouse.Â  Id.Â  The modification \r\n          of alimony is within the sound discretion of the family court and will \r\n          not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Riggs v. Riggs, \r\n          353 S.C. 230, 236, 578 S.E.2d 3, 6 (2003). \r\n        We find a further reduction or \r\n          outright termination of Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation is not warranted \r\n          in this case.Â  Though Husband argues his circumstances have changed \r\n          and his net worth has decreased since his retirement, we note the 1996 \r\n          order clearly found Husband anticipated use of his retirement funds \r\n          to supplement his reduced income, and Husbandâ€™s reduction in income \r\n          should have been anticipated by the parties at the time of the alimony \r\n          award in 1983.Â  Further, Husband testified that at the time of the 1996 \r\n          action he anticipated a reduction in hours he worked as he approached \r\n          retirement and he planned to eliminate his obstetrical practice, at \r\n          which time he would have to use his retirement funds to supplement his \r\n          income. He further admitted that at the 1996 hearing, as well as the \r\n          1983 hearing, he knew he would have to invade his retirement funds at \r\n          some point and that his â€œgame planâ€ all along was to use these funds \r\n          upon retirement.Â  Thus, the record supports the family court judgeâ€™s \r\n          finding in this matter that Husbandâ€™s retirement was contemplated by \r\n          the parties.Â  \r\n        Further, we find the family court judgeâ€™s \r\n          modification of the alimony award from $3000 to $2000 in the instant \r\n          case was more than reasonable.Â  Wifeâ€™s 2002 financial declaration showed \r\n          a monthly income, including the $3,000 in alimony, of $3,251 after taxes.Â  \r\n          She listed total monthly expenses of $2,914.Â  Thus, with a $1,000 reduction \r\n          in alimony Wife should have a net income somewhat less or almost in \r\n          line with her expenses.Â  Husband, on the other hand showed a net monthly \r\n          income of $5,735 in 2002, and expenses of $6,764, including his $3,000 \r\n          monthly alimony payments to Wife.Â  With a decrease by $1,000 in his \r\n          monthly alimony payments, Husband likewise should be able to meet his \r\n          monthly expenses.Â Â  This court is not unmindful of Husbandâ€™s complaint \r\n          that he is having to withdraw from his retirement to achieve his income \r\n          stream, however, the modification as ordered by the family court judge \r\n          will not require Wife to deplete her assets so Husband will not have \r\n          to reduce his own, a measure clearly contemplated by the parties and \r\n          the court.Â  We find the reduction in alimony as ordered by the court \r\n          provides Husband some relief, without serving as a disincentive to Wife \r\n          from saving and investing her money.Â  Accordingly, we find no error \r\n          in the family court judgeâ€™s determination to reduce Husbandâ€™s monthly \r\n          alimony obligation from $3000 to $2000.\r\n         II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\n           Husband argues the family court \r\n            judge erred in failing to award him attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\n          In\r\n          determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court\r\n          should consider the following factors: (1) the partyâ€™s ability to\r\n          pay his or her own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by the\r\n          attorney; (3) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and (4)\r\n          the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s standard of\r\n          living.&nbsp;\r\n          E.D.M. v.

Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d\r\n          901, 903 (1988).\r\n          The fact that Husbandâ€™s attorney \r\n            obtained a beneficial result in the form of a reduction in monthly \r\n            alimony payments does not require an award of attorneyâ€™s fees in this \r\n            case.Â  Wife was also benefited by the representation from her attorney \r\n            in that she did not suffer the extent of a decrease in alimony sought \r\n            by Husband.Â  Further, as the family court judge found Husbandâ€™s net \r\n            worth was $925,000, Husband still has the ability to pay his own fees.Â  \r\n            Finally, there is no evidence his financial condition has deteriorated \r\n            to the point that paying his attorneyâ€™s fees would be a hardship or \r\n            that it would detrimentally impact his standard of living. \r\n            [4] Â  We find the judge acted within his discretion in deciding \r\n            not to award attorneyâ€™s fees because â€œboth parties were well represented \r\n            and the relative positions both [had] merit.â€Â  Accordingly, we find \r\n            the family court judge did not err in declining to award attorneyâ€™s \r\n            fees to Husband.\r\n           AFFIRMED.\r\n          ANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n       \r\n         \r\n          [1] The parties agreed at the outset of the hearing in this matter \r\n          that Husband was alleging a change of circumstances since the 1996 order, \r\n          and therefore the court would consider events occurring after the 1996 \r\n          order in determining whether there was a substantial change in circumstances \r\n          warranting modification.Â  \r\n      \r\n       \r\n         \r\n          [2]  Furthermore, we consider Husbandâ€™s argument that the court \r\n          should not have included in Husbandâ€™s assets the transferred one-half \r\n          interest in the marital home to his current wife, which occurred only \r\n          four months prior to the institution of this action, to be without merit.Â  \r\n          Husband testified he gratuitously transferred the interest to his current \r\n          wife for no consideration.Â  While Husband was clearly entitled to make \r\n          such a transfer, the family court judge properly considered this voluntary \r\n          transfer in determining Husbandâ€™s net assets.\r\n      \r\n       \r\n         [3] \r\n          We note Husband only sought a reduction of alimony in his complaint, \r\n          not a termination of alimony.Â  Further, there is no indication in the \r\n          record before us that Husband argued to the family court that he was \r\n          entitled to a termination of this support obligation. \r\n      \r\n       \r\n         \r\n          [4] Husband has provided no evidence of the amount of his attorneyâ€™s \r\n          fees. \r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-342","title":"State v.

Coffey, of Greer, for Appellant.\r\nKimberly Fisher Dunham, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Michael David Coffey appeals \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s denial of his motion for relief from an order requiring him \r\n  to pay attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn January of 1998, Lisa A. Webb commenced an action \r\n  against Coffey seeking a modification of custody, visitation, child support, \r\n  unrecovered medical expenses, attorneyâ€™s fees, and other related relief.Â  Coffey, \r\n  who represented himself in the matter, filed an answer and counterclaim, but \r\n  did not list his address as required by Rule 11(a), SCRCP.Â  Three days prior \r\n  to the final hearing, Kimberly Dunham, Webbâ€™s attorney, mailed notice of the \r\n  final hearing to Coffey by certified mail, return receipt requested, to his \r\n  last known address of 204 Roe Road. Unbeknownst to the court or Dunham, Coffey \r\n  had moved from the Roe Road location.Â  The notice was forwarded to Coffeyâ€™s \r\n  new address, and Coffey received the notice the day after the hearing.Â  Thus, \r\n  Coffey was not present at the final hearing on April 16, 1999.Â  In the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s final order issued on May 27, 1999, Coffey was ordered to pay $3,531.05 \r\n  in attorneyâ€™s fees to Dunham within sixty days of the entry of the final order.Â  \r\n\r\nCoffey failed to pay the attorneyâ€™s fees; therefore, \r\n  in July of 2002, Dunham filed this action seeking enforcement of the portion \r\n  of the final order pertaining to the payment of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  On October \r\n  11, 2002, Coffey filed a motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60, SCRCP, \r\n  claiming he did not receive proper notice of the final hearing.Â  The trial court \r\n  denied Coffeyâ€™s motion.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nCoffey essentially argues the May 1999 order is void because \r\n  he was not properly served with notice of the final hearing.Â  Therefore, he \r\n  claims the trial court erred in denying his motion for relief from judgment.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nRule 60(b), SCRCP, provides that a motion for relief from \r\n  a final judgment must be made within one year of the entry of judgment.Â  Coffey \r\n  waited until October of 2002 to file his motion, well over one year after the \r\n  trial court issued its order.Â  Therefore, Coffey is bound by the one-year time \r\n  frame unless the evidence shows he was not given proper notice of the final \r\n  hearing.Â  See Rule 60(b), SCRCP.\r\nCoffey argues Dunham failed to properly notify him of the \r\n  final hearing because she sent the notice to his old address a mere three days \r\n  prior to the final hearing.Â  Rule 17(a), SCRFC, states that, when a defendant \r\n  is not represented by counsel and does not file an answer, notice is sufficient \r\n  when mailed to the defendant at his last known address, by certified mail, return \r\n  receipt requested.Â  In the present case, Coffey filed an answer with the court.Â  \r\n  Therefore, Rule 17(a) did not apply, and Dunham actually did more than was required \r\n  when she mailed notice to Coffey.Â  \r\nWhen a defendant files an answer pro se, \r\n  Rule 11(a), SCRCP, requires him to sign the answer and state his address so \r\n  that the clerk of court can notify him of the hearing.Â  In this case, Coffey \r\n  failed to state his address when he filed his answer.Â  Although Coffey claims \r\n  his address of 204 Roe Road was on file with the court because of the return \r\n  address on a letter he sent to the judge prior to the merits hearing, Coffey \r\n  admitted in his testimony that he moved from this address prior to the hearing \r\n  and did not notify the court that his address had changed. As a pro se \r\n  litigant, Coffey is held to the same standard as an attorney, and it was Coffeyâ€™s \r\n  duty to keep the court informed of his address. State v. Hollman, 232 \r\n  S.C. 489, 498, 102 S.E.2d 873, 877 (1958) (â€œ[E]stablished rules of procedure \r\n  are not to be discarded, either in the trial court or on appeal, merely because \r\n  the defendant has been his own lawyer.â€), overruled on other grounds by \r\n  Stevenson v. State, 335 S.C. 193, 516 S.E.2d. 434 (1999).Â  \r\nBased on the above, we find it was Coffeyâ€™s own error in \r\n  not providing the court with his address that caused him to fail to receive \r\n  notice of the final hearing.Â  Therefore, Coffeyâ€™s motion for relief is barred \r\n  by the one-year time limit under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.

Lindsay, Jr. \r\n  died as a result of an accident that occurred when his motorcycle collided with \r\n  a truck driven by Bruce A. Ericson. Lindsayâ€™s estate sought to stack the additional \r\n  underinsured motorist coverage from Lindsayâ€™s Farm Bureau insurance policies \r\n  covering two other vehicles he owned.Â  Each of the Farm Bureau policies provided \r\n  $250,000 in underinsured motorist coverage.Â  Farm Bureau paid Lindsayâ€™s estate \r\n  $100,000 under each policy, totaling $200,000.Â  The personal representative \r\n  of Lindsayâ€™s estate brought a declaratory judgment seeking a determination that \r\n  Farm Bureau was liable for the full amount of the underinsured motorist coverage \r\n  on each policy, totaling $500,000.Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment \r\n  in favor of Farm Bureau, finding the available underinsured motorist coverage \r\n  on each policy was limited to the amount of coverage Lindsay carried on the \r\n  vehicle involved in the accident, in this case $100,000. \r\nLindsayâ€™s estate appeals arguing that the \r\n  available underinsured motorist coverage was not so limited because of ambiguities \r\n  in the Farm Bureau policy or, alternatively, because Lindsay bargained for additional \r\n  coverage.Â  We affirm [1]  pursuant \r\n  to Rule 220, SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 \r\n  (2002 and Supp. 2003); Lanham v.

Ins. Co. v. Mooneyham, 304 S.C. \r\n  442, 446, 405 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1991) (â€œ[W]e interpret the pertinent language \r\n  of the statute as setting a cap on the amount which can be stacked; the amount \r\n  of coverage which may be stacked from policies on vehicles not involved in an \r\n  accident is limited to an amount no greater than the coverage on the vehicle \r\n  involved in the accident.â€); Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Howard, 288 \r\n  S.C. 5, 12, 339 S.E.2d 501, 504 (1985) (â€œPertinent provisions of the uninsured \r\n  motorist statutes which are absent from the policy language prevail as much \r\n  as if expressly incorporated in the policy.â€); State Farm Mut.

Richardson, Sr., Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, \r\n  all of Columbia;Â  and Solicitor Randolph Murdaugh, III, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, A.J.:&nbsp; John \r\n  Brinson appeals his convictions for first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC), \r\n  first-degree burglary, and kidnapping.Â  He asserts the circuit court erred in \r\n  denying his motion for a mistrial.Â  He further contends the court lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction because the State improperly amended the indictments for \r\n  first-degree burglary and first-degree CSC.  [1] Â  We affirm in part and vacate \r\n  in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 2, 1999, the victim went \r\n  to bed around midnight only to be awoken sometime later by someone jumping on \r\n  her bed and on top of her.Â  Despite her attempts to fight him off, the assailant \r\n  pinned her to the bed, choked her, threatened to kill her, and forced her to \r\n  perform and receive oral sex. Â This assault lasted several hours.Â  At some point, \r\n  the assailant took a brief break to drink a beer from the victimâ€™s refrigerator.Â  \r\n  He also attempted to force her to drink a beer.Â  After this pause, the assault \r\n  continued in much the same manner as it had before.Â  As sunrise approached, \r\n  the assailant threatened to kill the victim if she told anything to the police \r\n  about what had happened and left. Soon thereafter, the victim phoned 9-1-1 and \r\n  the police were dispatched to her home.Â  \r\nThroughout this prolonged assault, the house was \r\n  very dark and the victimâ€™s eyes were covered with blankets and pillows.Â  At \r\n  no time did she get a good look at the perpetrator, but offered the police a \r\n  very limited physical description.Â  She informed police that the assailant had \r\n  a terrible speech impediment. Â The victim had a few minor injuries and was taken \r\n  to a local hospital, where a rape kit was performed. \r\nFingerprints were lifted from the two beer bottles \r\n  and the headboard of the victimâ€™s bed. Â According to an investigating police \r\n  officer, a suspect had been determined from the victimâ€™s description and a fingerprint \r\n  match was quickly made with a fingerprint card of the suspect available in the \r\n  sex offender registry. Â Brinson was subsequently arrested and indicted for first-degree \r\n  burglary, first-degree CSC, and kidnapping. \r\nAt the outset of trial, the State moved to amend \r\n  the indictments for first-degree burglary and first-degree CSC.Â  The State requested \r\n  that the word â€œintercourseâ€ be struck from the first-degree CSC indictment and \r\n  the words â€œand the victim was the victim of kidnapping or burglaryâ€ be added.Â  \r\n  The State also requested that the words â€œor another participant in the crime \r\n  was armed with a deadly weapon or explosiveâ€ in the first-degree burglary indictment \r\n  be replaced with, â€œentered or remained in the nighttime.â€ Â The court allowed \r\n  these handwritten amendments after Brinsonâ€™s attorney stated that he had no \r\n  objections to the changes. \r\nThe State presented a great deal of \r\n  evidence at trial incriminating Brinson.Â  The jury heard testimony concerning \r\n  Brinsonâ€™s speech impediment, the palm and fingerprint matches, and a DNA sample \r\n  taken from saliva found in the victimâ€™s underwear that matched the DNA of Brinson. \r\n  Â \r\nAn investigating officer testified to the initial \r\n  evidence that led to the arrest of Brinson as follows: \r\n\r\n[ASSISTANT SOLICITOR:] What did you do with the hinge lift \r\n  after you - - after you did that?\r\n[OFFICER:] I kept it in my possession. A suspect had been \r\n  developed through description.Â  I examined a fingerprint card that was in the \r\n  sexual offender registry of that certain suspect.\r\n\r\nBrinsonâ€™s counsel promptly moved for \r\n  a mistrial based on the reference to the sex offender registry and the possible \r\n  inference of a prior record. Â Counsel further contended the error could not \r\n  be cured with an instruction to the jury.Â  After a stern warning to the solicitor \r\n  not to introduce any other references to any prior record of Brinson, the court \r\n  denied the motion. Â Brinson renewed his motion for a mistrial at the close of \r\n  the Stateâ€™s case.Â  Again denying the motion, the court stated:\r\n\r\n[M]y recollection of the testimony was that the detective \r\n  said he went to check the sex offender registry.Â  He never testified that the \r\n  defendant was on the sex offender registry and . . . I felt it was proper for \r\n  a law enforcement officer, where a sex crime had occurred, to check the sex \r\n  offender registry.Â  I did not feel that any prejudice from that testimony had \r\n  occurred to the defendant, tying the defendantâ€™s prior record to that testimony, \r\n  although I felt it was dangerous ground and warned the witness to be careful \r\n  as to his testimony . . .\r\n\r\nThe jury convicted Brinson of all three \r\n  charges.Â  Due to his prior record, the court sentenced Brinson under section \r\n  17-25-45 to three concurrent terms of life imprisonment without the possibility \r\n  of parole.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2003) (outlining South \r\n  Carolinaâ€™s two/three strikes law).Â  Brinson appeals. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  DENIAL OF MOTION FOR \r\n  MISTRIAL\r\nBrinson argues the circuit court erred \r\n  in denying his motion for a mistrial.Â  He contends the officerâ€™s testimony concerning \r\n  the fingerprint match obtained from the sex offender registry card of â€œthat \r\n  certain suspectâ€ was prejudicial to the degree of tainting the trial on all \r\n  charges. [2] Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial \r\n  is within the sound discretion of the trial judge; hence, we must only determine \r\n  if this discretion was abused.Â  State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 63, 530 \r\n  S.E.2d 626, 627-28 (2000); State v. Dawkins, 297 S.C. 386, 392, 377 S.E.2d \r\n  298, 301 (1989).Â  The grant of a mistrial is an extreme measure that should \r\n  only be used when absolutely necessary.Â  Harris, 340 S.C. at 63, 530 \r\n  S.E.2d at 628; State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 13, 515 S.E.2d 508, 514 \r\n  (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1050 (1999); State v. Beckham, \r\n  334 S.C. 302, 310, 513 S.E.2d 606, 610 (1999).Â  In order to receive a mistrial, \r\n  a defendant must show error and prejudice. Harris, 340 S.C. at 63, 530 \r\n  S.E.2d at 628.\r\nHere, the officerâ€™s testimony strongly \r\n  implies prior crimes committed by Brinson.Â  Evidence of a personâ€™s character \r\n  or trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in \r\n  conformity therewith unless offered as rebuttal evidence.Â  See Rule 404(a), \r\n  SCRE (Generally, â€œ[e]vidence of a personâ€™s character or a trait of character \r\n  is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith \r\n  on a particular occasion.â€).Â  Furthermore, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, \r\n  or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show \r\n  that the charged crime is in conformity with past behavior.Â  See Rule \r\n  404(b), SCRE (â€œEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to \r\n  prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.Â  \r\n  It may, however, be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a \r\n  common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.â€).Â  Based \r\n  on these rules, our appellate courts have held that the admittance of evidence \r\n  merely implying the existence of prior crimes is error.Â  See State \r\n  v. Tate, 288 S.C. 104, 105, 341 S.E.2d 380, 381 (1986) (holding admission \r\n  of photographic lineup which included a â€œmug shotâ€ of defendant constituted \r\n  reversible error).Â  \r\nBrinson contends the officerâ€™s testimony concerning \r\n  his fingerprint file in the sex offenderâ€™s registry so strongly implied a prior \r\n  criminal record that a mistrial should have been granted.Â  We agree with Brinson \r\n  that the admittance of the officerâ€™s testimony without a curative instruction \r\n  to the jury in this case was legal error.Â  We find, however, that this error \r\n  was harmless.\r\nNo definite rule of law governs the \r\n  finding that an error was harmless; rather the materiality and prejudicial character \r\n  of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  State \r\n  v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 193-94, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990).Â  The decision \r\n  whether or not to grant a mistrial for testimony that merely implies the existence \r\n  of prior crimes often hinges on the degree of that implication.Â  Compare \r\n  Council, 335 S.C. at 13, 515 S.E.2d at 514 (holding that a reference \r\n  to a fingerprint card on file at the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division \r\n  was too vague to constitute prejudice); State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, \r\n  511, 476 S.E.2d 903, 912 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1123 (1997) (finding \r\n  testimony of prior drug dealing to be merely suggestive and not prejudicial); \r\n  State v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 561, 575 S.E.2d 77, 82 (Ct. App. 2003) \r\n  (finding an isolated reference to arrest warrants too vague to constitute reversible \r\n  error); with Tate, 288 S.C. at 105, 341 S.E.2d at 381 (finding \r\n  the admittance of mug shots of defendant to be a strong enough implication of \r\n  a prior criminal record to constitute reversible error). \r\nIn our view, the trial court recognized that the \r\n  implication of the officerâ€™s testimony was fairly clear and these comments dangerously \r\n  approached the threshold of reversible error.Â  We are also troubled by the similarity \r\n  of the referenced prior bad acts to the charge of first-degree CSC. See \r\n  State v. Brooks, 341 S.C. 57, 62, 533 S.E.2d 325, 328 (2000) (â€œWhen the \r\n  prior bad acts are similar to the one for which the appellant is being tried, \r\n  the danger of prejudice is enhanced.â€).Â  When viewing this error from its relationship \r\n  to the entire case, however, we find this implication harmless.Â  This determination \r\n  is not due to the statementâ€™s vagueness, but rather, in light of its probable \r\n  weight when compared to the strength of the Stateâ€™s case as a whole.Â  \r\nAn error is harmless when it could not have reasonably \r\n  affected the result of the trial. State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, \r\n  336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).Â  In cases where the evidence of guilt presented \r\n  against an appellant, separate and apart from the evidence or testimony alleged \r\n  to have been admitted in error, constitutes overwhelming and un-contradicted \r\n  proof of guilt, a reviewing court may deem the error harmless if it believes \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict.Â  \r\n  Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967); Mitchell, 286 S.C. \r\n  at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151; State v. Watts, 321 S.C. 158, 165-66, 467 \r\n  S.E.2d 272, 277 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nÂ  Here, there is overwhelming evidence in the record \r\n  from which the jury could have found Brinson guilty, notwithstanding the implication \r\n  of a prior record.Â  Evidence was presented to the jury regarding a positive \r\n  DNA match between Brinson and saliva found in the victimâ€™s underwear.Â  Positive \r\n  matches were made between Brinsonâ€™s finger and palm prints and multiple prints \r\n  lifted from the victimâ€™s home.Â  In light of these and other facts appearing \r\n  in the record, we believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the testimony of the \r\n  investigating officer concerning Brinsonâ€™s sex offender registry file did not \r\n  contribute to the verdict. State v. Parker, 315 S.C. 230, 235, 433 S.E.2d \r\n  831, 833 (1993); Mitchell, 286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151.Â  Thus, \r\n  we find the denial of Brinsonâ€™s motion for a mistrial constituted harmless error.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\r\nBrinson argues the circuit court erred \r\n  in permitting the State to amend the indictments for first-degree burglary and \r\n  first-degree CSC.Â  He asserts the amendments were improper and, thus, deprived \r\n  the court of subject matter jurisdiction as to those two charges.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œA circuit court has subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction if:Â  (1) there has been an indictment which sufficiently states \r\n  the offense; (2) there has been a waiver of indictment; or (3) the charge is \r\n  a lesser included charge of the crime charged in the indictment.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 639, 545 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2001).Â  An indictment \r\n  is sufficient if it contains the necessary elements of the offense intended \r\n  to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he or she must \r\n  be prepared to meet.Â  Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d \r\n  358, 359 (1995); State v. Gill, 355 S.C. 234, 238, 584 S.E.2d 432, 434 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Amendments to an indictment are allowed and do not deprive \r\n  the court of subject matter jurisdiction if:Â  (1) they do not change the nature \r\n  of the offense; (2) the charge is a lesser-included offense of the crime charged \r\n  on the indictment; or (3) the defendant waives presentment to the grand jury \r\n  and pleads guilty.Â  State v. Myers, 313 S.C. 391, 393, 438 S.E.2d 236, \r\n  237 (1993); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-100 (2003) (stating an amendment \r\n  to an indictment is permissible if the amendment does not change the nature \r\n  of the offense charged).Â  \r\nBecause issues related to subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  may be raised at any time, even for the first time on appeal, we must now decide \r\n  whether or not the amendments to both the burglary and criminal sexual conduct \r\n  charges changed the nature of each offense.Â  Browning, 320 S.C. at 368, \r\n  465 S.E.2d at 359 (stating issues relating to subject matter jurisdiction may \r\n  be raised at any time).\r\nA. First-Degree Burglary\r\nAt the outset of trial, the State altered \r\n  the first-degree burglary indictment by removing the phrase â€œarmed with a deadly \r\n  weapon or explosiveâ€ and replacing it with â€œentered or remained in the nighttime.â€Â  \r\n  First-degree burglary is established by proving a burglary occurred with any \r\n  one of several different enumerated aggravating circumstances.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 16-11-311 (2003). [3] Â  The \r\n  amendment in question removed one such aggravating circumstance and replaced \r\n  it with another.\r\nWe find the Supreme Court decision of \r\n  State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 545 S.E.2d 511 (2001), conclusive precedent \r\n  on this issue.Â  In Lynch, a first-degree burglary indictment was amended \r\n  in the same manner as the case before us.Â  The State moved to amend the indictment \r\n  for first-degree burglary, requesting the words â€œin the hours during darknessâ€ \r\n  be replaced with â€œcaused physical injury.â€Â  The Court found that by changing \r\n  the aggravating circumstances, the amendment to the indictment â€œsubstituted \r\n  an entirely different offense for the one charged.â€ Id. at 640-41, 545 \r\n  S.E.2d at 514.Â  The Court reasoned that the aggravating circumstance is the \r\n  â€œessenceâ€ of first-degree burglary. Id. at 640, 545 S.E.2d at 614.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  each aggravating circumstance is distinct from the others and requires proof \r\n  that is materially different.Â  Id.\r\nThe Supreme Court further explained that a defendant \r\n  charged with first-degree burglary by way of one aggravating circumstance is \r\n  not prepared to meet and defend the same charge brought via a different aggravating \r\n  circumstance.Â  Lynch, 344 S.C. at 641, 545 S.E.2d at 514.Â  The Court \r\n  recognized the fact that the penalty for both is the same does not mean an amendment \r\n  does not change the nature of the offense. Id. at 639, 545 S.E.2d at \r\n  514.Â  Based on this analysis, the Court vacated the conviction for first-degree \r\n  burglary, finding the amendment deprived the circuit court of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Id. at 639-41, 545 S.E.2d at 514.Â  \r\nHere, Brinson was indicted for first-degree burglary \r\n  under section 16-11-311(A)(1)(a), the aggravating circumstance involving a deadly \r\n  weapon.Â  The amendment to the indictment deleted this aggravating circumstance \r\n  and replaced it with an entirely different offense and code section, section \r\n  16-11-311(3), providing the defendant entered or remained in the nighttime.Â  \r\n  In light of our Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Lynch, we find the circuit \r\n  court was deprived of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  As such, Brinsonâ€™s conviction \r\n  for first-degree burglary is vacated.Â  See Brown v. State, 343 \r\n  S.C. 342, 346, 540 S.E.2d 846, 849 (2001) (stating acts of a court with respect \r\n  to a matter to which it has no subject matter jurisdiction are void).\r\nB.Â  First-Degree Criminal Sexual \r\n  Conduct\r\nThe amendment of the first-degree CSC \r\n  charge was slightly different than that of the burglary charge.Â  Like first-degree \r\n  burglary, first-degree CSC is defined as a base charge (criminal sexual battery) \r\n  proven with any one or more of several aggravating circumstances. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-652 (2003). [4] Â  Prior to trial, the State amended this indictment \r\n  by adding the words â€œand the victim was the victim of kidnapping and burglaryâ€ \r\n  to the indictment. Rather than substituting one aggravating circumstance for \r\n  another, this amendment added another aggravating circumstance to a charge made \r\n  a first-degree offense by the â€œuse of aggravated force,â€ which was alleged in \r\n  the indictment before and after the amendment.\r\nFor many of the same reasons set forth \r\n  in the burglary analysis, we hold this amendment changed the nature of the offense \r\n  and deprived the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction over this charge.Â  \r\n  We find that the aggravating circumstances of first-degree CSC, like first-degree \r\n  burglary, are â€œthe essenceâ€ of that crime. Lynch, 344 S.C. at 640, 545 \r\n  S.E.2d at 514.Â  Each is distinct from the others and requires proof that is \r\n  materially different.Â  \r\nOur decision is based on Lynch and this \r\n  Courtâ€™s recent holding in State v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. 103, 572 S.E.2d \r\n  309 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In Guthrie, the defendant was indicted for first-degree \r\n  burglary based on the aggravating circumstance of unlawfully entering a dwelling \r\n  during the nighttime hours.Â  Prior to trial, the State moved to amend the indictment \r\n  to include as an additional aggravating factor the defendantâ€™s prior convictions \r\n  for two or more burglaries.Â  Over the defendantâ€™s objection, the court granted \r\n  the amendment.Â  On appeal, the defendant argued the circuit court lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction because the amendment added an additional element of aggravation \r\n  that was not presented to the grand jury.Â  This Court held the amendment deprived \r\n  the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Id. at 111, 572 S.E.2d \r\n  at 314.Â  We determined the amendment changed the nature of the offense charged, \r\n  stating â€œ[t]he two aggravating circumstances in the case sub judice \r\n  are distinct from one another, and thus, the proof required for each aggravating \r\n  circumstance is materially different from the other.â€Â  Id.\r\nAt oral argument, the State asserted this case was \r\n  distinguishable from Guthrie in that the statutes for first-degree CSC \r\n  and first-degree burglary are decidedly different.Â  The State explained the \r\n  amendment in this case only added another method of proof and did not provide \r\n  for additional elements, whereas the amendment in Guthrie added another \r\n  offense.Â  Because Brinsonâ€™s indictments for kidnapping and first-degree burglary \r\n  had been presented to the grand jury, the State argued the addition of these \r\n  offenses to the first-degree CSC indictment did not create a separate and entirely \r\n  different offense.Â  As such, the State claimed the amendment to first-degree \r\n  CSC did not divest the court of subject matter jurisdiction. [5] Â Â  \r\nWe reject the Stateâ€™s argument on several \r\n  grounds.Â  First, this case is factually similar to Guthrie.Â  As in Guthrie, \r\n  the original indictment in this case was correct in that the base offense and \r\n  one aggravating circumstance were properly alleged and remained intact after \r\n  the amendments.Â  Thus, applying the holding in Guthrie, we believe the \r\n  amendment in the instant case divested the court of subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  even though the original indictment properly conferred subject matter jurisdiction. [6] Â Â  Secondly, we fail to discern \r\n  the distinction made between the statutes for first-degree burglary and first-degree \r\n  CSC.Â  A review of both charges indicates there is a base offense and proof of \r\n  each offense requires the existence of one or more aggravating circumstances.Â  \r\n  Thirdly, once added to the indictment, it is possible for the jury to ignore \r\n  the initially charged circumstance and convict the defendant of a first-degree \r\n  crime based solely on the added, non-indicted aggravating circumstance.Â  Although \r\n  the amendment did not alter the general offense of first-degree CSC, it did \r\n  affect the nature of the charge.Â  In this case, the nature of the charged offense \r\n  was substantively changed and Brinson was not apprised of what he had to be \r\n  prepared to answer.Â  Finally, the fact that Brinson was also indicted for kidnapping \r\n  and burglary, and was thus not â€œsurprisedâ€ by the amendment, is irrelevant.Â  \r\n  As stated by our Supreme Court in Lynch: \r\n\r\n[I]n testing the sufficiency of an indictment and the propriety \r\n  of amending an indictment, it is improper to look to other indictments, even \r\n  if those indictments relate to the same course of conduct.Â  A subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction analysis is performed on individual charges, not the charges in \r\n  the aggregate.Â  The appropriate analysis is whether the amendment to the indictment \r\n  changed the nature of the offense charged, not whether the amendment in any \r\n  way surprised or prejudiced appellant.\r\n\r\nLynch, 344 S.C. at 641, 545 S.E.2d at 514; \r\n  see State v. Bryson, 357 S.C. 106, 114 n.6, 591 S.E.2d 637, 641 \r\n  n.6 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œ[A]n amendment is substantive and thus not permitted unless \r\n  the â€˜same defense is available to the defendant both before and after the amendment \r\n  and upon the same evidence.â€™â€ (quoting 41 Am. Jur. 2d Indictments and Informations \r\n  Â§ 168 (1995))).Â Â \r\nBy permitting the improper amendment, the circuit court \r\n  was divested of subject matter jurisdiction as to the charge of first-degree \r\n  CSC.Â  As such, the conviction on this charge is vacated.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons set forth above, we \r\n  find that Brinsonâ€™s kidnapping conviction and sentence of life imprisonment \r\n  stand. The convictions for first-degree burglary and first-degree CSC, however, \r\n  are vacated. [7]  Accordingly, \r\n  Brinsonâ€™s convictions areÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART.\r\nHUFF, J., concurs and STILWELL, J., concurs in part \r\n  and dissents in part in a separate opinion.\r\n  STILWELL, J. (concurring in part and dissenting \r\n  in part): I concur in the majority opinion concerning the denial of a motion \r\n  for mistrial and the subject matter jurisdiction relating to first degree burglary.Â  \r\n  However, I disagree and therefore dissent from the majorityâ€™s opinion on subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction on the criminal sexual conduct (CSC) charge.Â  The amendment \r\n  relating to the CSC charge did not delete from the indictment the aggravating \r\n  circumstance originally submitted to the grand jury, but only added an additional \r\n  aggravating circumstance.Â  As noted, this is the identical factual situation \r\n  presented in State v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. 103, 572 S.E.2d 309 (Ct.

Rubillo, of Georgetown, for Appellants.\r\nGene McCain Connell, Jr., of Surfside Beach, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Leo and Ellen Gefre brought \r\n  this action against Donald Skelton and Robert Skelton asserting causes of action \r\n  for negligence, assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \r\n  wrongful discharge, and negligent supervision. [1] Â  The circuit court granted summary \r\n  judgment in favor of Robert Skelton as to all of the claims brought against \r\n  him.Â  The Gefres appeal.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBoth Leo and Ellen Gefre, husband and wife, were \r\n  employed at Creative Candles, a candle-making shop owned and operated by Robert \r\n  Skelton in Pawleyâ€™s Island, South Carolina.Â  The claims raised by the Gefres \r\n  in this case stem from an alleged altercation at the candle shop between Leo \r\n  Gefre and Robert Skeltonâ€™s son, Donald Skelton. \r\nWhile working at the shop in May 1999, Leo Gefre \r\n  claims he was beaten and choked by Donald Skelton.Â  Following the assault, the \r\n  Gefres sought assurances from Robert Skelton that his son would not be allowed \r\n  to return to Creative Candles in order to prevent further threat of physical \r\n  violence.Â  Receiving no satisfactory assurances, the Gefres did not return to \r\n  work at the candle shop. \r\nThe Gefres subsequently brought suit against Donald \r\n  Skelton alleging common-law assault and battery as well as intentional infliction \r\n  of emotional distress.Â  Robert Skelton d/b/a Creative Candles was also included \r\n  in the suit under additional causes of action for negligence, negligent supervision, \r\n  and wrongful discharge.\r\nOn Donald and Robert Skeltonâ€™s motion for summary \r\n  judgment, the circuit court dismissed the causes of action against Robert Skelton \r\n  as owner of Creative Candles on the ground that the claims were precluded by \r\n  the exclusive remedy provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act (Act). S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-540 (1985).Â  Specifically, the court found that these claims \r\n  fell within the purview of the Act because Donald Skelton was a fellow â€œemployeeâ€ \r\n  with the Gefres at the Creative Candles shop. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court should grant a motion for summary \r\n  judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see Fleming v. Rose, 350 \r\n  S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002) (â€œSummary judgment is appropriate \r\n  when there is no genuine issue of material fact such that the moving party must \r\n  prevail as a matter of law.â€).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of \r\n  fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from \r\n  the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€ \r\n  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 \r\n  S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  If triable issues of fact exist, those issues must \r\n  go to the jury. Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, \r\n  717, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nThe Gefres claim the circuit court erred \r\n  in finding their claims against Robert Skelton as the owner and manager of Creative \r\n  Candles for injuries resulting from Donald Skeltonâ€™s alleged attack were barred \r\n  by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  The Gefres argue they were not limited to \r\n  the remedies allowed under the Act because Donald Skelton was not an employee \r\n  of Creative Candles.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Section 42-1-540 provides:\r\n\r\n  \r\nThe rights and remedies granted \r\n  by this Title to an employee when he and his employer have accepted the provisions \r\n  of this Title, respectively, to pay and accept compensation on account of personal \r\n  injury or death by accident, shall exclude all other rights and remedies of \r\n  such employee, his personal representative, parents, dependents or next of kin \r\n  as against his employer, at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury, \r\n  loss of service or death.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-540 (1985).\r\nAs this case was decided by the circuit \r\n  court on the narrow question of whether Donald Skelton was an employee, our \r\n  review of the facts is confined to determining whether that employer-employee \r\n  relationship existed between Donald Skelton and his father. [2] Â  â€œWhether or not an employer-employee relationship \r\n  exists is a jurisdictional question.â€Â  Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 \r\n  S.C. 589, 594, 564 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2002).Â  Because the issue involves determining \r\n  proper jurisdiction, this Court must take its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence in our analysis of whether Donald Skelton was employed at the \r\n  candle shop.Â  Id.Â  â€œIt is South Carolinaâ€™s policy to resolve jurisdictional \r\n  doubts in favor of the inclusion of employers and employees under the Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Act.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Act defines â€œemployeeâ€ as those \r\n  persons â€œengaged in an employment under any appointment, contract of hire, or \r\n  apprenticeship, expressed or implied, oral or written . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 42-1-130 (Supp. 2003).Â  In applying the definition of employee provided under \r\n  the Act, this Court has previously opined: â€œThe employment relationship is contractual \r\n  in character; however, no formality is required.Â  The contract may be oral or \r\n  written, and also may be implied from conduct of the parties.Â  It is enough \r\n  if the circumstances show unequivocally that the parties recognize the relationship.â€Â  \r\n  Spivey v. D.G. Const. Co., 321 S.C. 19, 22, 467 S.E.2d 117, 119 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn determining whether an employer-employee relationship \r\n  exists for purposes of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, our courts have examined \r\n  the employerâ€™s right to control.Â  That is, the determination of employee status \r\n  depends on whether the putative employer has a right to control and direct the \r\n  particular details of the putative employeeâ€™s work.Â  Nelson, 349 S.C. \r\n  at 594, 564 S.E.2d at 113; see Young v. Warr, 252 S.C. 179, 189, \r\n  165 S.E.2d 797, 802 (1969) (â€œThe general test applied is that of control by \r\n  the employer.Â  It is not the actual control then exercised, but whether there \r\n  exists the right and authority to control and direct the particular work or \r\n  undertaking, as to the manner or means of its accomplishment.â€); 82 Am. Jur. \r\n  2d Workersâ€™ Compensation Â§ 123 (2003) (commenting that â€œ[i]t has been \r\n  said that in a workersâ€™ compensation case, the ultimate question in finding \r\n  an employment relationship is whether the employer assumes the right to control \r\n  the times, manner and method of executing the work of the employeeâ€).Â  \r\nThough these determinations depend on the specific \r\n  facts of each case, our courts generally look to four factors in examining an \r\n  employerâ€™s degree of control: (1) direct evidence of the right or exercise of \r\n  control; (2) payment and method of payment; (3) furnishing major items of equipment; \r\n  and (4) the right to terminate the employment relationship at will and without \r\n  liability.Â  Dawkins v. Jordan, 341 S.C. 434, 439, 534 S.E.2d 700, 703 \r\n  (2000).\r\nOur review of the factual circumstances \r\n  concerning Robert Skeltonâ€™s right to control the method and manner which Donald \r\n  Skelton worked at the candle shop leads us to agree with the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  conclusion that there is no material dispute of the facts concerning whether \r\n  Donald Skelton was an employee.Â  There was direct evidence presented of Robert \r\n  Skeltonâ€™s right and exercise of control of his sonâ€™s activities at work.Â  Both \r\n  Robert Skelton and Ellen Gefre testified that Donald would take instructions \r\n  relating to his work duties directly from his father.Â  Donald worked approximately \r\n  twenty hours per week and was paid $1,000 to $1,300 per month.Â  Donald worked \r\n  primarily in the candle-making factory portion of the business where all of \r\n  the equipment required to make candles was provided for him.Â  There is no evidence \r\n  that Donaldâ€™s employment was on any terms other than strictly at-will employment.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, Leo and Ellen Gefre both testified in their depositions that Donald \r\n  Skelton was an employee.Â  They also stated in their responses to the defendantsâ€™ \r\n  discovery requests that Robert Skelton was Donaldâ€™s employer.\r\nA consideration of these facts supports the conclusion \r\n  that each of the four indicia of control identified by our courts is present \r\n  in the circumstances of Donald Skeltonâ€™s work for his father.Â  We conclude therefore \r\n  that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Donald Skelton \r\n  was an â€œemployeeâ€ under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  As such, the Gefresâ€™ \r\n  claims against Robert Skelton are precluded by the exclusive remedy provision \r\n  of the Act as a matter of law.\r\nII.\r\nThe Gefres argue the circuit court improperly \r\n  dismissed their claim for wrongful discharge.Â Â  The court, however, did not \r\n  specifically address this issue in its order granting partial summary judgment.Â  \r\n  Despite this omission, the Gefres did not petition the court for a ruling by \r\n  way of a motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  As \r\n  such, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. \r\n  v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding that â€œ[i]t \r\n  is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but \r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for \r\n  appellate reviewâ€); see also Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. \r\n  56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (finding issue was not preserved where the \r\n  trial judge did not explicitly rule on the appellantâ€™s argument and the appellant \r\n  did not raise the issue in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the \r\n  judgment).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no error with the circuit courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  that the Gefresâ€™ claims stemming from injuries caused by Donald Skeltonâ€™s alleged \r\n  assault and battery were barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Act.Â  The Gefresâ€™ claim for wrongful discharge was not preserved \r\n  for appellate review.Â  The courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Robert \r\n  Skelton is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED. \r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., and CURETON, AJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â  Ellen Gefre also alleged causes of action for loss of consortium \r\n    and negligent infliction of emotional distress. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â  The parties do not appear to dispute that the causes of action \r\n    against Robert Skelton, with the exception of wrongful discharge, come within \r\n    the purview of the Act if an employee-employer relationship exists.Â  See \r\n    Loges v.

Cox for judgment on a note secured by real property.Â  Cox appeals \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Centura on Coxâ€™s counterclaims \r\n  (1) that the bank failed to timely obtain her attorney preference as required \r\n  by statute and (2) that the contract was unconscionable.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nCox had an outstanding loan with Centura \r\n  which was secured by a second mortgage on real estate and, in addition, had \r\n  several unsecured loans in favor of the bank.Â  The unsecured loans came due \r\n  and Cox planned to pay all her debts to Centura from the sale of her real property, \r\n  which was at that time listed for sale.Â  Centura offered to renew Coxâ€™s unsecured \r\n  loans if she consolidated all her debt into a loan secured by the real property \r\n  and payable in six months.Â  Cox agreed and because she was temporarily physically \r\n  disabled from a minor auto accident, a Centura employee took the documents to \r\n  Coxâ€™s home for her to sign.Â  \r\nCox failed to make the payment on the \r\n  new note on its maturity date.Â  When Centura commenced this action more than \r\n  a year after the note matured, Cox responded alleging the contract was unconscionable \r\n  and obtained in violation South Carolinaâ€™s attorney and insurance agent preference \r\n  statute.Â  Her real property, valued at $490,000 in the personal financial statement \r\n  she submitted with her application, was no longer on the market when Cox was \r\n  deposed.Â  It remained unlisted throughout the litigation.Â  Cox explained in \r\n  her deposition testimony she still intended to sell the property and pay off \r\n  the note, but wanted to wait until the market would generate a price suitable \r\n  to her financial needs.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing, the trial court granted \r\n  Centuraâ€™s motion for summary judgment on Coxâ€™s counterclaims.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the \r\n  disposition of cases that do not require the services of a fact finder.Â  Dawkins \r\n  v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003).Â  When reviewing \r\n  the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard \r\n  that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper \r\n  when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. \r\n  488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  \r\nIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, \r\n  the evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in a light \r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sauner v. Public Serv. Auth., \r\n  354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).Â  Even if there is no dispute \r\n  as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions to be drawn from them, \r\n  summary judgment should be denied.Â  Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 431, \r\n  480 S.E.2d 455, 457 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Summary judgment is not appropriate when \r\n  further inquiry into the facts is desirable to clarify the application of law.Â  \r\n  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  The Preference Statute\r\nCox argues the trial court erred in ruling \r\n  she failed to establish the attorney and insurance agent preference statute \r\n  applied and in its alternative finding that Centura satisfied the statute.Â  \r\n  We disagree with both contentions.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 37-10-102 provides:\r\nWhenever the primary purpose of a loan that is secured \r\n  in whole or in part by a lien on real estate is for a personal, family or \r\n  household purpose â€“ \r\n(a)Â Â Â Â  The creditor must ascertain prior to closing \r\n  the preference of the borrower as to the legal counsel that is employed to represent \r\n  the debtor in all matters of the transaction relating to the closing of the \r\n  transaction . . .\r\nThe creditor may comply with this section by:\r\n  \r\n(1)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  including the preference information on \r\n  or with the credit application . . . or\r\n(2)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  providing written notice to the borrower \r\n  of the preference information with the notice being delivered or mailed no \r\n  later than three business days after the application is received or prepared.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-102(a) (2002) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n\r\nCox argues the court erroneously found she \r\n  presented no evidence the loaned funds were used for a personal, family, or \r\n  household purpose and thus erred in concluding the statute was not triggered.Â  \r\n  Although Cox lived on part of the property she mortgaged, her testimony did \r\n  not indicate the purpose of the unsecured debt that was restructured. Â However, \r\n  as did the trial court, we assume for the purpose of our analysis that the preference \r\n  statute applied to this loan and conclude Centura complied with its requirements.\r\nOn July 23, 1999, a Centura employee visited \r\n  Cox at home to prepare her application.Â  During this visit, the date the application \r\n  was â€œreceived or prepared,â€ Cox signed several documents, including the credit \r\n  application and the attorney and insurance agent preference form. Â This evidence \r\n  establishes Centura ascertained Coxâ€™s preference regarding a closing attorney \r\n  simultaneously with the receipt and preparation of the credit application.Â  \r\n\r\nHowever, Cox contends a material factual \r\n  dispute exists regarding the date the application was received and summary judgment \r\n  was thus inappropriate. Â Although she does not dispute signing all of the relevant \r\n  documents on July 23, Cox asserts this does not prove the date she applied for \r\n  the loan.Â  Noting the personal financial statement was dated July 17, Cox argues \r\n  this indicates Centura provided her with the application before July&nbsp;23.Â  \r\n  Relying on this premise, Cox argues there is a factual question whether Centura \r\n  failed to provide her with preference information within three days of the application.\r\nWe doubt the preference statute requires \r\n  anything more of a creditor than ascertaining a borrowerâ€™s attorney preference \r\n  prior to closing.Â  The specific portion of the section Cox references merely \r\n  describes one way a lender may comply with the statute.Â  Â§ 37-10-102(a)(2); \r\n  see Edge v. State Farm Ins. Co., 345 S.C. 136, 139, 546 S.E.2d \r\n  647, 648-49 (2001) (concluding when the term â€œmayâ€ is used, it is meant to be \r\n  merely permissive and not a requirement).Â  However, even if Coxâ€™s interpretation \r\n  of the statute is correct, the evidence and factual inferences create no genuine \r\n  triable issue regarding whether Centura failed to satisfy the statuteâ€™s requirements.Â  \r\n  On the contrary, the evidence shows she signed the attorney preference form \r\n  and the credit application on the same day.\r\nII.Â  Unconscionability\r\nCox further argues the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to fully consider the elements of her unconscionability counterclaim.Â  She claims \r\n  the contract was one of adhesion, that she was unsophisticated and naÃ¯vely believed \r\n  she could sell the property for $490,000 within six months, and that the sophisticated \r\n  Centura took advantage of her limited physical mobility knowing she was in no \r\n  position to negotiate.Â  Again, we find summary judgment was properly granted.\r\nA trial court may refuse to enforce or limit \r\n  enforcement of a consumer credit agreement that was unconscionable when it was \r\n  made.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-5-108(1) (2002).Â  When making this determination, \r\n  a trial judge is to consider several factors outlined in section 37-5-108(4). [2] Â  Here, the court specifically referenced these statutory factors \r\n  before making extensive findings of fact relating to the question.Â  The court \r\n  found, among other things, Cox owns real and personal property that could be \r\n  sold to reduce the debt, Centura reasonably relied on Coxâ€™s assurances she was \r\n  going to sell the property, the credit contract contains no extraordinary terms, \r\n  Cox could have easily gone elsewhere to obtain the loan, and Cox specifically \r\n  noted her auto accident â€œwas not a big thing.â€Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  37-5-108(1)(b) (â€œany term or part of the agreement or transaction [was] unconscionable \r\n  at the time it was madeâ€); Â§ 37-5-108(4)(a) (â€œbelief by the . . . lender at \r\n  the time a transaction is entered into that there is no reasonable probability \r\n  of paymentâ€); Â§ 37-5-108(4)(e) (â€œthe fact that the . . . lender has knowingly \r\n  taken advantage of the inability of the consumer or debtor reasonably to protect \r\n  his interests by reason of physical or mental infirmitiesâ€).Â  \r\nUnconscionability is the absence of meaningful choice \r\n  on the part of one party caused by one-sided contract provisions together with \r\n  terms so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and \r\n  honest person would accept them.Â  Munoz v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 343 \r\n  S.C. 531, 541, 542 S.E.2d 360, 365 (2001).Â  The trial court, correctly citing \r\n  the statutory factors and several specific facts related to them, determined \r\n  the credit contract was neither one-sided nor oppressive.Â  We conclude the trial \r\n  court properly considered all relevant elements of Coxâ€™s counterclaim and correctly \r\n  concluded the credit contract was not unconscionable as a matter of law.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and STILWELL and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Subsection 4 has been amended since the trial court issued \r\n    the order on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-350","title":"Receivable Recovery Services v.

Â Friend told her that the waiver of benefits would \r\n  result in a $200.00 automatic increase of her monthly salary. Friend also assured \r\n  Coates he would â€œgo to bat for herâ€ to get more money.Â  \r\nFrom the beginning of her employment, \r\n  Coates was being paid $500 more monthly than the initial base salary.Â  Friendâ€™s \r\n  assurances caused Coates to believe the company intended to pay her the additional \r\n  $500 monthly.Â  For six months Coates received the alleged $500 overpayment.Â  \r\n  However, after four months of employment, Coates discussed the additional salary \r\n  with Friend and thanked him for the increase.Â  During this discussion, Friend \r\n  did not mention that the additional salary was an overpayment.Â  After Coates \r\n  had worked at Receivable for six months and had received eleven checks, Coates \r\n  spoke with Joe Messina, the owner of the corporation. Â Shortly after \r\n  the conversation with Messina, Coates terminated her employment with Receivable. \r\n  \r\nMessina made attempts to have Coates \r\n  sign an agreement that said she was overpaid $500. \r\n  [1]  Additionally, Receivable deducted $754.67 from Coatesâ€™ payroll and \r\n  $ 231.58 from Coatesâ€™ expenses, without her permission. \r\nThe magistrate found the testimony \r\n  that the alleged overpayment resulted from ADPâ€™s keying error unbelievable.Â  \r\n  The magistrate found that although Coates had been getting more money and was \r\n  aware of that, Receivable failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, \r\n  that there was an overpayment.Â  Receivable appealed to the circuit court, which \r\n  found there was evidence in the record to affirm the magistrateâ€™s ruling.Â  The \r\n  circuit court affirmed the magistrate.Â  This appeal follows.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Â \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;\r\n    Did \r\n      the circuit court err in holding that Coates was entitled to keep money \r\n      mistakenly paid to her by Receivable when relevant case law clearly states \r\n      a party may recover money mistakenly paid even if it was wholly responsible \r\n      for the error?\r\n      \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n    Did \r\n      the magistrate err in holding Coates was entitled to keep money mistakenly \r\n      paid to her by Receivable based on the judgeâ€™s speculation that Receivable \r\n      meant to pay Coates?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n Because this case originated in \r\n  magistrateâ€™s court, South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170 (1985) is applicable.Â  \r\n  Parks v. Characters Night Club, 345 S.C. 484, 490, 548 S.E.2d 605, 608 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  On appeal from magistrateâ€™s court, the circuit court may make \r\n  its own findings of fact. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170.Â  However, on \r\n  appeal from a circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of a magistrateâ€™s order, the appellate \r\n  courtâ€™s review is more limited. This court will presume that an affirmance by \r\n  a circuit court of a magistrate's judgment was made upon the merits where the \r\n  testimony is sufficient to sustain the magistrateâ€™s judgment and there are no \r\n  facts that show the affirmance was influenced by an error of law.Â  Hadfield \r\n  v. Gilchrist, 343 S.C. 88, 538 S.E.2d 268 (Ct. App. 2000). We therefore \r\n  look to whether the circuit court order is controlled by an error of law or \r\n  is unsupported by the facts. Parks, Id. \r\nReceivable argues that Coates in \r\n  not permitted to keep monies mistakenly paid to her.Â  We do not believe the \r\n  circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to decide that issue.Â Â  Pursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-20, Receivable, within thirty days after judgment was \r\n  announced at the trial, was to serve a notice of appeal, stating the grounds \r\n  upon which its appeal was founded.Â  Receivable did not delineate any grounds \r\n  or exceptions on its appeal to the circuit court. Accordingly, Receivableâ€™s \r\n  issues were not preserved for appellate review.\r\nEven if we believed the issue was \r\n  preserved for appellate review, we find there is sufficient evidence to support \r\n  the lower courtâ€™s decision.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD and BEATTY, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Receivable hired an outside company, Automatic Data Processing (ADP), \r\n    to handle payroll.Â  ADP was allegedly responsible for keying in the wrong \r\n    amount for Coates.Â  Coates had no dealings with ADP.

Bryant, \r\n          III, of Orangeburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Colby \r\n  W. Furtick (Appellant) appeals from a special refereeâ€™s order finding a mortgage \r\n  held by him was unenforceable against Mary Catherine R. Furtick (Respondent) \r\n  due to the doctrine of laches.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent is the widow \r\n  of Appellantâ€™s son, Michael.Â  Before his death, Michael signed two mortgages.Â  \r\n  On April 30, 1974, Appellant conveyed to Michael a 200-acre tract of land for \r\n  â€œTen and 00/100 ($10.00) Dollars, love and affection.â€Â  In 1993, Appellant recorded \r\n  a mortgage (Mortgage 1) dated April 30, 1974, the same date as the conveyance \r\n  of property.Â  The mortgage was to secure an indebtedness of $45,000.Â  This mortgage \r\n  was held unenforceable by the special referee due to the statute of limitations \r\n  and laches and is not disputed here.  \r\n\r\n  \r\nOn May 20, 1983, Michael \r\n  obtained a $50,000 loan from Southern Bank &amp; Trust.Â  In order to secure \r\n  the loan, Michael gave Southern Bank a mortgage on the 200-acre tract of land.Â  \r\n  In October 1985, Appellant negotiated to refinance with Southern Bank to pay \r\n  off Michaelâ€™s mortgage.Â  Michael had been very ill and had accumulated significant \r\n  debts.Â  Southern Bank issued a new secured loan to Michael for $35,000 secured \r\n  by a mortgage.Â  Appellant guaranteed and endorsed this mortgage (Mortgage 2).Â  \r\n  He also made a large payment of around $17,000 to reduce the size of the debt \r\n  from $50,000 to $35,000 for the new mortgage.Â  On December 26, 1989, (after \r\n  Michaelâ€™s death on January 3, 1987) Appellant paid off the remaining balance \r\n  of the note and mortgage and had it assigned to himself.Â  Much later Appellant \r\n  had an assignment agreement formally executed between Southern Bankâ€™s successor \r\n  in interest and himself on November 26, 1993 and filed on December 8, 1993.Â  \r\n  Appellant never made a claim against Michaelâ€™s estate for any part of this mortgage \r\n  debt.Â  \r\n  \r\nThe only time that the \r\n  Respondent expressed any knowledge of the 1985 mortgage after her husbandâ€™s \r\n  death was when she was asked by a bank employee Kathleen Fanning as to how she \r\n  would pay the loan off and Respondent said â€œI told her that she [Kathleen Fanning] \r\n  would have to talk to Mr. Furtick.â€Â  Respondent further stated that Appellant \r\n  had never contacted Respondent about paying off the mortgage.Â  Â Â  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn July 2000, pursuant \r\n  to a condemnation action against the 200-acre property, Respondent became aware \r\n  of the two mortgages upon the property.Â  Respondent had paid off most of an \r\n  unrelated first mortgage on the property with the Federal Land Bank, which was \r\n  used to build the marital home where she has been living since 1978.Â  Mortgage \r\n  1 and Mortgage 2 were the only additional liens on the tract.Â  Once Respondent \r\n  became aware of the additional mortgages in 2000, Appellant offered to cancel \r\n  all the debts (Mortgage 1 and 2) if the Respondent would give the land to her \r\n  children (by Appellantâ€™s son Michael Furtick).Â  Respondent filed a declaratory \r\n  judgment action seeking a determination that the two mortgages were invalid \r\n  or unenforceable.Â  Respondent argued that equitable defenses â€“ including laches \r\n  â€“ operated to invalidate the mortgages.Â  This matter was then referred to a \r\n  special referee.Â  \r\n  \r\nAfter a hearing on the \r\n  merits, the special referee found neither of the two mortgages was enforceable.Â  \r\n  The referee concluded Mortgage 1 was unenforceable because of the statute of \r\n  limitations and laches and Mortgage 2 was unenforceable because of laches. \r\n  [1] Â  Appellant did not file a subsequent motion to alter or amend the judgment.\r\n  \r\n STANDARD OF REVIEW&nbsp; \r\n   \r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory \r\n  judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of \r\n  the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, \r\n  400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  An action to foreclose a real estate mortgage is \r\n  one in equity.Â  Carsten v. Wilson, 241 S.C. 516, 520, 129 S.E.2d 431, \r\n  434 (1963).Â  â€œIn actions in equity referred to a special referee with finality, \r\n  the appellate court may view the evidence to determine the facts in accordance \r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, though it is not required \r\n  to disregard the findings of the special referee.â€Â  Florence County Sch. \r\n  Dist. #2 v. Interkal, Inc., 348 S.C. 446, 450, 559 S.E.2d 866, 868 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002).\r\n    \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n Appellant argues the \r\n  special referee erred in holding Appellant was barred from enforcing Mortgage \r\n  2 on the ground of laches.Â  Specifically, Appellant argues (1) he was not negligent \r\n  in failing to inform Catherine Furtick of the assignment of the mortgage to \r\n  himself and that she was not prejudiced by his delay and (2) laches is not a \r\n  defense to a mortgage foreclosure action and (3) in any event the statute of \r\n  limitations S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-1-10 (Supp. 2003) supersedes any equitable defense.Â  \r\n  We do not agree. \r\nLaches \r\n\r\n      \r\n        \r\nLaches is defined as \r\n  â€œneglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, under circumstances \r\n  affording opportunity for diligence, to do what in law should have been done.â€Â  \r\n  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 198, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).Â Â  \r\n  \r\n        \r\nâ€œWhether the plaintiff \r\n  is barred by laches is to be determined in light of the facts of each case, \r\n  taking into consideration whether the delay has worked injury, prejudice, or \r\n  disadvantage to the other party.â€Â  Arceneaux v. Arrington, 284 S.C. 500, \r\n  503, 327 S.E.2d 357, 358 (Ct. App. 1985); see also Grossman v. Grossman, \r\n  242 S.C. 298, 309, 130 S.E.2d 850, 855 (1963) (â€œDelay alone in the assertion \r\n  of a right does not constitute laches.Â  It must be shown in addition that such \r\n  delay has resulted in material prejudice to the defendant.â€).Â Â  \r\n        \r\nWe concur with the special \r\n  refereeâ€™s finding that Appellantâ€™s claim under Mortgage 2 failed due to laches.Â  \r\n  Appellant held Mortgage 2 for eleven years, but did not take any active steps \r\n  to assert his rights until forced to do so by the condemnation action.Â  In fact, \r\n  Appellant did not record this mortgage assignment, which was executed Dec. 26, \r\n  1989, until Dec. 8, 1993 and never informed Respondent of its existence.Â  Appellant \r\n  even testified he had no plans to pursue the debt, as he wanted his grandchildren \r\n  to one day own the land. Â In his testimony Mr. Furtick stated that the \r\n  reason he filed the assignment in 1993 was â€œI felt like [Respondent] wasnâ€™t \r\n  taking care of the children, and her lifestyle, and I just thought Iâ€™d try to \r\n  save it for the children.â€Â  He also stated in another point in his testimony \r\n  that he â€œdidnâ€™t like the way [Respondent] was treating the children.â€Â  We find \r\n  Appellant was clearly lax in initiating any type of proceeding against the mortgaged \r\n  property.Â  \r\n        \r\nWe also find this inaction \r\n  served to prejudice Respondent.Â  Respondent, over the course of several years, \r\n  worked to pay down the balance of the first mortgage on the property.Â  At trial, \r\n  Respondent testified she was within two years of paying off the first mortgage \r\n  with the Federal Land Bank, which is not disputed here.Â  Thus, Respondent has \r\n  been prejudiced by Appellantâ€™s delay, as she is now saddled with a previously \r\n  unknown second mortgage on the land. [2] Â  Perhaps if she had been aware of Mortgage \r\n  2, she would have taken steps to reduce that debt.Â  \r\n        \r\nSection 29-1-10 \r\nSection 29-1-10 states, \r\n  in pertinent part:\r\n          \r\n\r\n  No mortgage or deed \r\n    having the effect of a mortgage or other lien shall constitute a lien upon \r\n    any real estate after the lapse of twenty years from the date for the \r\n    maturity of the lien. . . .Â  When there is no maturity stated or fixed in \r\n    the mortgage or the record of the mortgage, then the provisions hereof are \r\n    applicable from the date of that mortgage and that mortgage shall not constitute \r\n    a lien after the lapse of twenty years from the date thereof.Â Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-1-10 \r\n  (Supp. 2003).\r\n          \r\nWe disagree with Appellantâ€™s \r\n  contention that section 29-1-10 creates a bright line rule that a mortgage holder \r\n  can seek foreclosure on the last day of the twentieth year without having demanded \r\n  such payment earlier and cannot be barred by laches.Â  â€œSince an action \r\n  to foreclose a mortgage is in equityâ€¦the equitable defenses \r\n  of laches, waiver and estoppel may be raised against the mortgagee.â€Â  \r\n  Rakestraw v. Dozier Assocs., Inc., 285 S.C. 358, 360, 329 S.E.2d 437, \r\n  438 (1985).Â  The case law clearly provides that the issue of whether a party \r\n  is barred by laches from asserting a right is to be determined in light of the \r\n  facts of each case.Â  Furthermore, the cases cited by Appellant in support of \r\n  his argument for a bright line rule are factually distinct from the instant \r\n  case and do not support the existence of such a rule.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  F.Gregorie &amp; Son v.
