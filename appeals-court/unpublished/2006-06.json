Fraley, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-268\r\nHeard May 17, 2006 â€“ Filed June 1, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAndreaÂ  Hawkins, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\nKenneth Philip Shabel, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal of a termination of parental rights.Â  Father argues termination was improper because he remedied the conditions that caused the removal of his children and because there was no evidence that he posed a threat of harm to them.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nFather and Mother married in 1991.Â  They have four daughters, who at the time of the final hearing on August 10, 2005, ranged in age from five to twelve. \r\nThe Department of Social Services (DSS) first became involved with the family after receiving a report on October 24, 1997, that Mother and Child C both tested positive for cocaine at the childâ€™s birth.Â  Although the family court initially found probable cause for taking the children into protective custody, the parties agreed at the final hearing on November 24, 1997, that (1) Father would receive legal and physical custody of the children; (2) Mother would be restrained from having unsupervised contact with the children pending her completion of counseling for drug abuse; (3) Father would be restrained from allowing unsupervised contact between Mother and the children until she completed treatment; and (4) both parents would cooperate with DSS in completing treatment.Â  At a subsequent judicial review hearing on March 16, 1998, the family court granted legal and physical custody of the children to both parents.\r\nDSS took the children into emergency protective custody a second time in November 1998, after an allegation of criminal domestic violence.Â  The charges were later dismissed, and by consent order the children were later returned to both Father and Mother.\r\nIn October 1999, Mother tested positive for cocaine during the final trimester of her pregnancy with the familyâ€™s fourth child, prompting DSS to take the other three children into protective custody a third time.Â  At the probable cause hearing, the family court found probable cause for the removal due to Motherâ€™s positive drug test; however, following the merits hearing on December 13, 1999, Father, with DSSâ€™s consent, received custody of all four children on the condition that he prevent Mother from having unsupervised contact with the children. \r\nThe day after the merits hearing, Father and Motherâ€™s newborn fourth daughter tested positive for cocaine.Â  Following an emergency hearing on January 20, 2000, the family court left the prior custody arrangement intact, with Father having legal custody of the children and Mother having only supervised contact with them.Â  Following a judicial review hearing on December 11, 2000, the family court lifted the ban on unsupervised contact between Mother and the children and allowed DSS and the guardian ad litem to close their files on the case. \r\nIn July 2002, DSS brought an intervention action alleging Mother had physically abused the children by using excessive corporal punishment.Â  On October 11, 2002, while that action was pending, DSS took emergency protective custody of the children and filed a complaint for removal, alleging additional bruises on the children.Â  After the removal, both parents and two of the children tested positive for cocaine.Â  \r\nAt a hearing on October 21, 2002, the family court consolidated the intervention action with the removal case.Â  This time the family court granted custody of the children to DSS; however, it also ordered DSS to perform an expedited homestudy on Father for possible return of the children to his custody â€œupon confirmation that he is no longer living with [Mother].â€ \r\nFollowing a permanency planning hearing on March 7, 2003, the family court returned the children to Father.Â  The family court permitted Mother to live in the home with Father and the children; however, it also ordered to her comply with previous court-ordered treatment and submit to random drug screenings.Â  In addition, Motherâ€™s contact with the children was to be supervised until she completed two clean-hair-strand drug tests.Â  \r\nIn September 2003, DSS brought a rule to show cause against Mother.Â  The family court ordered her to immediately submit to a drug screen.Â  The test, which was administered September 19, 2003, was positive for cocaine.Â  The other family members were also tested.Â  All four children tested positive for cocaine, with only Father having a negative screen.Â  The children were again removed from their home and have remained in the physical and legal custody of DSS since that time.\r\nAt a hearing on January 5, 2004, DSS agreed not to pursue termination of parental rights, proceeding only on its complaint for removal.Â  With all partiesâ€™ consent, the family court adopted a treatment plan, which both Father and Mother agreed to complete without assistance, financial or otherwise, from\r\nDSS. \r\nAt a permanency planning hearing on September 9, 2004, the family court found both parents had made â€œsome, but not substantial progress on their previously ordered treatment planâ€ and allowed DSS to re-institute an action for termination. \r\nOn September 23, 2004, Father filed an action for divorce against Mother on the ground of habitual drunkenness.Â  At a temporary hearing on November 3, 2004, the family court granted Father exclusive use and possession of the marital home and ordered Mother to vacate the residence by November 20, 2004.[1]  \r\nOn November 15, 2004, DSS filed a complaint for termination of parental rights against both Father and Mother.Â  Several months later, the family court granted FatherÂ  a divorce on the ground of Motherâ€™s habitual drunkenness. \r\nThe final hearing in the termination action took place August 10, 2005.Â  By order dated September 7, 2005, the family court terminated the parental rights of both Father and Mother.Â  Only Father appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe best interest of the child is the paramount consideration in a termination of parental rights case.[2]Â  The party seeking to terminate anotherâ€™s parental rights must prove the alleged grounds for termination by clear and convincing evidence.[3]Â  Although â€œthis court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence,â€[4] . . . it â€œshould not necessarily disregard the findings of the family court because the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.â€[5]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Father argues on appeal that termination of his parental rights was improper because he remedied the conditions leading to the removal of the children and because there was no evidence that he posed any threat of harm to them.Â  We disagree with these assertions.\r\nThe family court concluded there was clear and convincing evidence to terminate the parental rights of both parents, noting it â€œ[was] not reasonably likely that the home [could] be made safe within twelve months.â€[6]Â  In support of this determination, the family court made numerous findings of fact.Â  Particularly significant is the family courtâ€™s finding that both Father and Mother â€œmade no significant progress on providing [a] safe home for the children.â€Â  In so finding, the family court noted (1) there was still domestic violence in the home, although conceding it was unclear as to who was a fault; (2) neither parent completed the counseling sessions as required by previous court order; and (3) neither parent substantially complied with the treatment plan, although acknowledging Father â€œcame close.â€\r\nAs to the allegation of domestic violence, Father argues he was never convicted of criminal domestic violence and there was evidence in the record that Mother had falsely accused him of domestic violence in the past and was herself a volatile person.Â  Nevertheless, there was significant circumstantial evidence presented at trial suggesting that Father, despite a clean criminal record and Motherâ€™s instability, had been an abuser.Â  This evidence included (1) a diagnosis from a physician at Vocational Rehabilitation that Mother suffered from spousal abuse syndrome; (2) a psychiatristâ€™s report diagnosing Mother with probable dysthymia disorder â€œsecondary to [a] long history of criminal domestic violenceâ€; and (3) testimony from a marriage counselor that Mother had been in an abusive relationship with Father.Â  In addition, a DSS employee testified about first-hand observations of Motherâ€™s behavior that indicated Mother was afraid of Father.Â  Notwithstanding the concerns presented by all this evidence, Fatherâ€™s testimony at the final hearing suggested he was still in denial about the problem.\r\nFather also argues it was undisputed that he and Mother were not living together at the time of the termination hearing.Â  Whether or not this assertion was true, it would not preclude the family court from considering the fact that, on prior occasions, Father, contrary to court-approved terms, allowed unsupervised contact between the children and Mother.[7]\r\nIn response to the family courtâ€™s finding that Father failed to complete counseling and did not comply with the treatment plan, Father presented evidence that he did in fact completed the court-ordered counseling programs.Â  He further characterizes testimony by DSS employees that he did not participate actively in the classes as â€œweakâ€ evidence to support the termination of his parental rights.Â  Although we agree with Father that the evidence indicates he fulfilled the attendance requirement for the treatment programs, we reject his contention that his apparent lack of participation was an improper factor in the family courtâ€™s decision.\r\nAccording to the terms of the court-approved treatment plan, Father was to not only attend and complete the classes but also to â€œbe able to demonstrate a minimum level of understanding of the material and be able to apply it in the care of [his] children.â€ Â Considering this requirement, along with testimony that Father was only minimally compliant in his attendance,[8] we do not fault the family court for considering Fatherâ€™s level of participation in the counseling programs to determine whether or not the treatment had the desired effect.\r\n2.Â  In his brief, Father does not challenge the finding that the children have been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months and proceeds to argue that termination of his parental rights was not in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  It therefore appears uncontested that DSS could proceed with the termination proceeding based on the ground that the children had been in custody of the State for at least fifteen of the past twenty-two months.[9]\r\n3.Â  To the extent that Father has adequately argued to this court that termination of his parental rights was not in the childrenâ€™s best interests,[10] we hold there is sufficient evidence to support the family courtâ€™s finding to the contrary.Â  Although it was apparent that the children â€œdo respect, love and admire their dad,â€ they were excelling in foster care and, according to their volunteer guardian ad litem, did not express a preference to live with either of their parents.Â  The guardian ad litem further testified that she was concerned about domestic violence in the home and believed that what was best for the children would be â€œa solid home situation where they can be sure whatâ€™s going to happen from day to day and month to month.â€Â  In view of this and other evidence, we uphold that family courtâ€™s determination that the best interests of the children warrant the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights.[11]\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  DSS was a party to this action because of the related litigation concerning the children.\r\n[2]Â  Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc.

Dist. No. 2 v. Interkal, Inc., 348 S.C. 446, 450, 559 S.E.2d 866, 868 (Ct. App. 2002); see \r\nWallace v. Milliken &amp; Co., 305 S.C. 118, 120, 406 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1991) (restitution is an equitable remedy). Â This broad scope of review, however, does not require an appellate court to disregard the findings below.Â  Florence County Sch. Dist. No. 2, 348 S.C. at 450; 559 S.E.2d at 868. We find the facts in accordance with the findings of the special referee.Â  Â Â \r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find appellants are not entitled to restitution.Â  The special referee correctly determined appellants did not confer a non-gratuitous benefit on respondents.Â  See \r\nSauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 409, 581 S.E.2d 161, 167-68 (2003) (to recover on a theory\r\nof restitution, the plaintiff must show that: (1) he conferred a non-gratuitous benefit on the defendant, (2) the defendant realized some value from the benefit, and (3) it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying the plaintiff for its value);\r\nNiggel Assocs., Inc. v. Poloâ€™s of North Myrtle Beach, Inc., 296 S.C. 530, 532-33, 374 S.E.2d 507, 509 (Ct. App. 1988) (for benefit to be conferred non-gratuitously, it must be conferred either at the defendantâ€™s request or in circumstances where plaintiff reasonably relies on defendant to pay for benefit and defendant understands or ought to understand that plaintiff expects compensation and looks to him for payment; defendant must have induced plaintiff to confer benefit).Â  There is no evidence in the record that respondents â€œinducedâ€ appellants to confer the benefit of the road on respondents.Â  Respondents consistently refused to pay for the construction.Â  Further, we are not persuaded by appellantsâ€™ contention that they were â€œcorneredâ€ into improving the shared easement.Â  Appellants knew before purchasing the property that they would have to construct access to the property.Â  Moreover, it would be inequitable to allow appellants to force respondents to pay for the improvement when the result would ultimately be a windfall for appellants.Â  Appellantsâ€™ property was inaccessible prior to improving the shared easement, and the purchase price reflected this fact.Â  \r\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We hold appellants are not entitled to contribution for the costs of past repair and maintenance of the shared easement.Â  Respondents were unable to use the improved easement until they constructed a connector road, which was not completed until fall of 1998.Â  This action was commenced in October 1998, and at that point, appellants obstructed the easement so that respondents could not pass through.Â  Accordingly, respondents did not gain any longstanding benefit that would warrant contribution of the costs of past repair and maintenance.Â  See Hayes v. Tompkins, 287 S.C. 289, 294, 337 S.E.2d 888, 892 (Ct. App. 1985) (citing Harris v. Ferguson, 18 S.C.L. (2 Bail.) 397 (1831) (doctrine of contribution founded upon equality of burden and benefit)).\r\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find the special refereeâ€™s use of property values to compute the partiesâ€™ respective obligation to pay for future repair and maintenance of the shared easement was equitable.Â  The allocation of repair and maintenance costs based upon the partiesâ€™ use of the shared easement is not practical, and would likely lead to continued litigation.Â  Further, property values serve an objective standard that will require those who have a residence on the property to pay more than those who do not.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-270","title":"Elgin v.

Jahue Moore, of W. Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nC. Cantzon Foster, II, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Grace Kelly appeals the trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant her a new trial absolute and denial of her requests for appointment of a receiver and an accounting.Â  We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1986, Donnie Elgin established Elginâ€™s Paint and Body Shop, Inc. in Columbia, SC.Â  He owned and operated the corporation as the sole shareholder.Â  In 1989, while he was going through a divorce, he met Grace Kelly at his lawyerâ€™s office.Â  Kelly, who was the office manager, provided accounting services for several law firms.Â  Elgin hired her to assist with his paint and body shop.Â  Eventually, Elgin and Kelly became romantically involved and began living together. Â When Elgin decided to open another business in Greenville, he needed someone to run the corporation when he was not there.Â  Kelly purchased 50% of the corporation for $70,000.[1]Â  \r\nWith Elgin working mainly in Greenville and then in 1994 moving to Florida and running a business there, he essentially became an absentee co-owner.Â  Kelly, along with manager Paul Caughman, ran the day-to-day operations of the corporation.Â  According to Elgin, Kellyâ€™s duties with the corporation included administering payroll, including deductions for the employees and compiling the corporationâ€™s quarterly and yearly federal and state tax returns.Â  This compiled tax information was then to be provided to the corporationâ€™s accountant for filing with the state and federal governments.Â  Elgin claimed that Kelly showed him phony documentation indicating that she had been providing the information to the accountant.Â  Kelly stated that although it was her duty to compile the tax information, she would provide that information to Elgin and he was supposed to provide it to the accountant.Â  \r\nIn July of 1998, Elgin discovered under Kellyâ€™s kitchen sink 10-12 bank statements, which revealed discrepancies in the corporate records.[2]Â  Kelly had written checks to herself for amounts exceeding that which she had recorded in the check register.Â  Kelly stated she would cash the checks and the cash would go to Elgin.Â  \r\nOn October 6, 1998, after being alerted that Kelly had taken a piece of mail into the restroom, Elgin found a letter from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which had been ripped up and put in the restroom trash by Kelly.Â  Elgin brought the IRS letter to his accountant and demanded to know â€œwhat was going on.â€Â  The accountant informed Elgin that he had not filed a tax return for him in years.Â  The accountant discovered that the corporation had not filed a tax return with the IRS since 1990 and owed approximately $572,000 in back taxes and over $1,000,000 in interest and penalties.Â  An employee of the corporation testified and provided documentation that although taxes were withheld from his pay checks, the corporation never paid those taxes on his behalf.Â  In addition, Elgin discovered that the corporation was dissolved by the state in October of 1994 for failure to file proper paperwork.Â  Both parties testified that they were unaware of this dissolution, and they had continued to operate as a corporation.Â  \r\nElgin brought the present action seeking a temporary restraining order and temporary and permanent injunctions to enjoin Kelly from visiting the business property or taking any actions regarding the finances or business affairs of the business.Â  The court granted the temporary restraining order the day Elgin filed the complaint.Â  Kelly answered and counter-claimed contending Elgin had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation. She requested an involuntary dissolution of the corporation, an accounting of the corporationâ€™s assets at the time of her ouster, and the appointment of a receiver. [3] Â  \r\nElgin also filed bankruptcy for the corporation.Â  Once bankruptcy was filed, the bankruptcy court took possession of all of the corporate assets and sold the equipment at auction.[4]Â  The bankruptcy court subsequently discharged the case from bankruptcy because Elgin lacked authority to file the action unilaterally. [5] Â  \r\nKelly filed an objection to payment of the bankruptcy trusteeâ€™s fees and moved that Elgin be required to pay the trusteeâ€™s fees as a sanction for bringing the action ultra vires.Â  The bankruptcy court found that Kelly did not come before the court with clean hands, failed to cooperate with the trustee, and only objected to the proceeding after the majority of the assets were liquidated.Â  Thus, it held Kelly was estopped and barred by the doctrine of laches from objecting to the payment of the trusteeâ€™s fees.Â  The bankruptcy court further found that although Elginâ€™s unilateral filing for bankruptcy was improper, there was no evidence that he engaged in any act that would rise to a level of contempt and declined to order Elgin to pay the trusteeâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nAfter court fees and trusteeâ€™s fees were deducted from the proceeds of the sale, the remainder of the money was returned to Elgin.Â  Elgin testified that he utilized approximately $53,000 of the $71,038.08 that was returned to him by the bankruptcy court to pay his accountant and the IRS and to pay the costs of defending the corporation in the bankruptcy proceeding and the present action. Â He also admitted that he used some of this money for moving expenses and to set up his living arrangements in Columbia when he moved from Florida.Â  The remaining $18,000 is now in Elginâ€™s attorneyâ€™s trust account.Â  \r\nAfter the discharge of the bankruptcy case, the present case came to trial with the legal matters presented to the jury and the equitable claims retained by the trial court.Â  The jury answered a special interrogatory finding that Kelly had an ownership interest in the corporation.Â  In its initial verdict, the jury found for Kelly, on behalf of the corporation, on the claim of breach of fiduciary duty but awarded no damages.Â  The trial court found the verdict was inconsistent and resubmitted the issue to the jury.Â  The jury quickly found in favor of Elgin.Â  Kelly filed a motion for a new trial absolute, which the trial court denied.Â  \r\nIn considering the equitable issues, the trial court held Elgin was not entitled to an injunction restraining Kelly from entering the business, finding there was no evidence Kelly had threatened to destroy business records.Â  The court denied the request for appointment of a receiver, finding such an appointment unnecessary.Â  The court also denied Kellyâ€™s request for an accounting, holding that the juryâ€™s determination that Elgin had not breached his fiduciary duty, while not binding as to the resolution of the issue, was supported by the evidence.Â  The court noted both parties had unclean hands but found the assets of the corporation had to be distributed and thus ordered the remaining assets be distributed to each shareholder on a pro rata basis.Â  The court subsequently denied Kellyâ€™s motion to vacate or alter or amend the judgment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Refusal to Grant a New Trial\r\nKelly contends the trial court erred in refusing to grant a new trial absolute.[6]Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to grant a new trial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and ordinarily will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 380, 426 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1993).Â  \r\nAfter deliberating for almost two hours, the jury returned a verdict. Â The jury found that Kelly had an ownership interest in the corporation and that Elgin had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation, but the jury did not award any damages on behalf of the corporation.Â  The trial court, without comment from the parties, informed the jury that this verdict was inconsistent.Â  The court again explained the charge of breach of fiduciary duty to the jury and instructed them to further deliberate to either find no breach of fiduciary duty or to award damages if there was a breach.Â  The jury returned to the courtroom five minutes later and rendered a verdict in favor of Elgin finding that there was no breach of fiduciary duty.Â  Kelly submitted a post-trial motion requesting a new trial absolute.Â  \r\nKelly argues that it was improper for the trial court to sua sponte instruct the jury on the inconsistent verdict.Â  After the trial court instructed the jury regarding the inconsistent verdict, it specifically asked the parties if they had any exceptions to the instructions it gave, and both parties stated that they had no objections.Â  Furthermore, in her motion for a new trial absolute, Kelly acknowledged, â€œHere, the Court properly resubmitted the case to the jury.â€Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â Â Â  \r\nKelly further contends that the jury did not follow the trial courtâ€™s instruction to deliberate further.Â  She asserts that only five minutes elapsed between the instruction and the time at which the jury reached its second verdict.Â  \r\nThe jury had deliberated for almost 2 hours prior to rendering its first verdict and quickly reached a second verdict after a thorough instruction by the trial court.[7]Â  There is no prescribed length of time for a jury to reach a verdict and such must of necessity be left to the judgment of the jury. Â State v. Dewitt, 254 S.C. 527, 534, 176 S.E2d 143, 147 (1970).Â  Something more must appear, therefore, to warrant interference with a juryâ€™s verdict than the mere brevity of their deliberations.Â  Id.Â  The record contains no indication that the jury â€œshirked its duty to engage in deliberationsâ€ in arriving at this verdict.Â  We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in accepting the juryâ€™s verdict. \r\nII.Â  Accounting and Appointment of a Receiver\r\nKelly contends that the trial court erred by refusing to appoint a receiver and failing to order an accounting with respect to the assets of the corporation at the time of her ouster, and by ordering that only the assets remaining at the time of trial be divided between the parties pro rata.[8]\r\nLegal and equitable actions, when maintained in one suit, each retain\r\ntheir own identity for purposes of the applicable standard of review on appeal.Â  Jordan v. Holt, 362 S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d 129, 131 (2005).Â  Dissolution of a corporation, appointment of a receiver, and an accounting are actions in equity. Â Jordan, 362 S.C. at 205, 608 S.E.2d at 131 (dissolution); Rogers v. Salisbury Brick Corp., 299 S.C. 141, 144, 382 S.E.2d 915, 917 (1989) (accounting); Wadsworth Industries, Inc. v. Westgate Knitting, Inc., 264 S.C. 106, 109, 212 S.E.2d 571, 572 (1975) (appointment of receiver). Â Accordingly, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (in equity case appellate court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence).Â  However, we are not required to disregard the findings below nor ignore the better vantage point the trial judge occupied in determining witness credibility.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).Â  \r\nElgin asserts Kellyâ€™s claim for an accounting is barred by the doctrine of unclean hands.Â  As the trial court held, Elgin, as well as Kelly, came to this matter with unclean hands.Â  Although Elgin received $71,038.08 from the bankruptcy court, he only had $18,000 remaining to deposit into his lawyerâ€™s trust account.Â  Elgin testified he used a portion of the funds to repay himself for expenses he incurred â€œdefend[ing] these cases.â€Â  However, he submitted no bills or any checks evidencing expenses he legitimately incurred on the corporationâ€™s behalf.Â  He also stated he used a portion of the funds returned by the bankruptcy court to pay the IRS.Â  However, his accountant testified that as far as he knew, no corporate tax liability had been paid.Â  Thus, Elgin may have used a portion of the corporate funds to pay his personal tax liability.Â  In addition, Elgin admitted that he had used a portion of the funds for personal moving expenses and to establish a new residence when he moved from Daytona, Florida back to South Carolina.Â  Because the evidence indicates Elgin used corporate funds for personal expenses, we find Kelly is entitled to an accounting.Â  \r\nWe disagree with Kellyâ€™s assertion that the appointment of a receiver is necessary.Â  In a corporate dissolution action, a court may appoint a receiver to â€œwind up and liquidate . . . the business and affairs of the corporation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-320(a) (2005).Â  In this case, the corporation has already been dissolved, there is no business to wind up, and all corporate assets have been liquidated.Â  We agree with the trial court that the appointment of a receiver is unnecessary.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial.Â  We also affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of Kellyâ€™s request for appointment of a receiver.Â  However, we REVERSE the trial courtâ€™s denial of Kellyâ€™s request for an accounting and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] No stock certificate for this transfer in ownership was ever created, and there was no documentation of Kellyâ€™s ownership.Â  \r\n[2] Elgin testified that when he confronted Kelly regarding these discrepancies, she offered no explanation and at one point, signed over her 50% interest in the corporation to him for no consideration.Â  Even after this event took place, both parties admit that they continued to operate as co-owners. \r\n[3]Kelly also made other claims including assault and battery and illegal wire tapping, but these claims are not relevant to this appeal.\r\n[4]Kelly still possessed a corporately-owned automobile that was not surrendered to the bankruptcy court. \r\n[5]The bankruptcy court noted the corporate book listed Claude R. Rogers as owner of 500 shares of stock.Â  Elgin explained the listed owner had planned to buy into the corporation prior to Kellyâ€™s co-ownership and Elgin had changed the corporate records.Â  However, the transaction fell through and Rogers never bought into the company.\r\n[6] Elgin asserts Kelly failed to timely file her Rule 59, SCRCP, motion and thus the circuit court and this court lack jurisdiction to consider the issues raised in the motion.Â  We find Kelly in fact timely served and filed her motion and sent a copy of the motion to the trial judge in accordance with Rule 59.Â Â  In addition, we find Kellyâ€™s notice of appeal was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on all issues raised in this appeal.Â  \r\n[7] It should be noted that if the jury quickly reached a second verdict because they felt pressed for time (as Kelly asserts), they could have awarded some amount of damages to Kelly just as quickly as they found for Elgin.\r\n[8] Elgin asserts this issue is not preserved because Kelly did not raise any specific arguments in her post-trial motion.Â  Kellyâ€™s request for appointment of receiver and an accounting were presented to the trial court and ruled on in the order of August 4, 2004.Â  Thus, the issue is preserved. Â See Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 77, 497 S.E.2d at 734 (â€œPost-trial motions are not necessary to preserve issues that have been ruled upon at trial; they are used to preserve those that have been raised to the trial court but not yet ruled upon by it.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-271","title":"SCDSS v.

Mitchell, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\nAnn Shipman Miner, of Pickens, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Randy Lee Cox appeals the family courtâ€™s decision to terminate his parental rights.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nJordan Lee Cox, the subject of this termination of parental rights action, was born on October 7, 1999.Â  His parents, Cox and Crystal Long never married, but maintain an ongoing relationship.Â  \r\nPursuant to an order dated August 29, 2002, Jordan was taken into emergency protective care by the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS).Â  Long, the custodial parent, was incarcerated at that time, and Cox and Jordan were living at the home of Coxâ€™s father Randy Cox, who had sexually abused Jordanâ€™s older half-sister.[1]Â  DSS took custody of Jordan due to the risk of sexual abuse.Â  \r\nAfter a merits hearing in October 2002, the family court, by order dated November 21, 2002, continued custody with DSS and incorporated the treatment plan presented by DSS into the order.Â  After evaluating Cox, DSS had determined that he needed to complete certain goals in order to become a responsible parent.Â  The plan required Cox to participate in drug and alcohol evaluations, attend mental health counseling, attend parenting classes, submit to random drug screens, and secure appropriate housing for Jordan.Â Â  \r\nCox continued to live at Randy Coxâ€™s residence and did not begin services as required by the treatment plan.Â  On May 27, 2003, DSS filed a contempt action against Cox for failure to comply with the treatment plan.Â  The family court held Cox in contempt, sentencing him to thirty days in jail, suspended upon immediate compliance with the plan.Â  In July 2003, DSS brought a Motion to Enforce the sentence, and Cox began participating in the programs outlined in the plan.Â  Cox was unable to complete the services because his parole (for a previous offense) was revoked for using illegal drugs, and he was returned to prison in December 2003.[2]Â  Before his incarceration, Cox visited with Jordan and made lump sum child support payments when he was able.Â  \r\nOn October 16, 2003, DSS filed the present termination of parental rights action.[3] Â After a hearing, at which Cox was present and testified, the family court, by order dated April 1, 2005, found by clear and convincing evidence that Cox failed to remedy the conditions which caused Jordanâ€™s removal by failing to complete the treatment plan and by failing to establish secure and appropriate housing due to his continued residence with his father, Randy Cox.Â  The family court also found Jordan had been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months, and termination of Coxâ€™s parental rights was in Jordanâ€™s best interests.Â  Cox filed a motion to reconsider, or in the alternative, to amend the judgment.Â  The family court denied Coxâ€™s motion and issued a supplemental order finding it had considered the time-frames of Coxâ€™s incarcerations and his conduct when not incarcerated in making the decision to terminate his parental rights.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a termination of parental rights case (TPR), the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration. Â South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000). Grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Â Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999).Â  Furthermore, in a TPR case, the appellate court has jurisdiction to examine the entire record to determine the facts according to its view of the evidence.Â  Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1998). Â This court may review the record and make its own findings whether clear and convincing evidence supports termination.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999). Â However, our broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact the trial judge was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses. Â Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Termination of Parental Rights\r\nCox argues the family court lacked clear and convincing evidence to terminate his parental rights on the ground he failed to remedy the conditions that caused Jordanâ€™s removal.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nThe termination of parental rights is governed by section 20-7-1572 of the South Carolina Code Annotated (Supp. 2005).Â  Pursuant to that section, parental rights may be terminated upon a showing of one or more enumerated grounds and a finding the termination is in the best interests of the child.Â  Under section 20-7-1572(2) parental rights may be terminated where: \r\n\r\n(2) The child has been removed from the parent pursuant to Section 20&#8209;7&#8209;610 or Section 20&#8209;7&#8209;736, has been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan by court order or by agreement between the department and the parent, and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal. \r\n\r\nJordan was removed pursuant to section 20-7-736 of the South Carolina Code Annotated (Supp. 2005), which provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(B) Upon investigation of a report received under Section 20&#8209;7&#8209;650 or at any time during the delivery of services by the department, the department may petition the family court to remove the child from custody of the parent, guardian, or other person legally responsible for the childâ€™s welfare if the department determines by a preponderance of evidence that the child is an abused or neglected child and that the child cannot be safely maintained in the home in that he cannot be protected from unreasonable risk of harm affecting the childâ€™s life, physical health, safety, or mental well&#8209;being without removal. \r\n\r\nCox concedes he failed to complete the treatment plan, but argues his partial compliance and attendance to his relationship with Jordan mitigates his failure to complete the plan.Â  Specifically, Cox asserts that he provided support for his son, visited with his son, and was working together with Long to build a home.Â  He argues that his ability to find work was stymied by his prison record, parole, and transportation issues. Â He also contends he was not afforded a full and fair opportunity to complete the treatment plan. \r\nThe evidence before us clearly and convincingly demonstrates that Cox failed to remove the impediment to his regaining custody of Jordan.Â  Cox did not begin to participate in the treatment plan until he was held in contempt, and he failed to successfully complete the treatment plan. The plan also obligated Cox to secure an appropriate residence for Jordan, but Cox continued to reside with his father, Randy Cox, where Jordan was at risk for sexual abuse.Â  Although Cox testified he and Long were trying to build a home for Jordan, no evidence was presented that Cox and Long were actively working toward this goal.Â  Accordingly, we agree with the family court that Cox failed to remedy the conditions that caused Jordanâ€™s removal.\r\nThe family court also found that clear and convincing evidence existed for terminating Coxâ€™s rights on the ground that â€œ[t]he child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty&#8209;two months.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2005).Â  Cox does not argue the family court erred in terminating his rights on this ground; therefore, he has abandoned this issue in appeal. Â See State v. Hiott, 276 S.C. 72, 86, 276 S.E.2d 163, 170 (1981); Rule 208(b)(1)(B), (D), SCACR (issue not argued in brief is deemed abandoned and precludes consideration on appeal).Â  We note that this ground alone is sufficient to support a termination of parental rights.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Sims, 359 S.C. 601, 608, 598 S.E.2d 303, 307 (Ct. App. 2004).Â Â  \r\nB.Â  Incarceration\r\nCox argues the family court erred in not properly weighing his incarceration and the incidents of his incarceration in terminating his parental rights.Â  Specifically, Cox contends that his incarceration limited his ability to complete the treatment plan.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nCox cites S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 543 S.E.2d 580 (Ct. App. 2001) in support of his position that the trial court did not give sufficient weight to the hardships caused by his incarceration.Â  In Wilson, we held the voluntary pursuit of lawless behavior is one factor which may be considered when determining whether to terminate the parental rights of an incarcerated parent, but it generally is not determinative.Â  344 S.C. at 337, 543 S.E.2d at 583.Â  We also held that the analysis required to determine whether a parent who has been or is currently incarcerated foregoes parental duties requires a comprehensive analysis of all the facts and circumstances beyond the criminal act and its natural circumstances, including the nature of the parent-child relationship during the times the parent was not incarcerated.Â  Id. at 339, 543 S.E.2d at 584 (citing Hamby v. Hamby, 264 S.C. 614, 216 S.E.2d 536 (1975)).Â  \r\nHere, the family court did not terminate Coxâ€™s parental rights based on his incarceration.Â  After careful consideration of how Coxâ€™s incarceration affected his ability to remedy the conditions which required removal, the family court found the ground for termination existed apart from fatherâ€™s incarceration.Â  Although Cox was in prison at the time his parental rights were terminated, he had a period of approximately fifteen months of freedom after Jordan was taken into custody in which he did not complete the treatment plan or find suitable housing for Jordan.Â  Cox took advantage of some of the services offered by the treatment plan, but he did not begin any portion of the plan until more than a year after he was ordered to do so and after he was threatened with jail time for contempt.Â  Cox cannot complain that he was not given the opportunity to complete the treatment plan because his parole was revoked, when he had ample time to complete the treatment plan before he was re-incarcerated.Â  Moreover, section 20-7-1572(2) only requires a showing that the child remained out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan to terminate on the ground that the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal.Â  DSS did not file the TPR action prematurely as Cox asserts, but gave him more time than is statutorily required to remedy the conditions that caused removal.Â  Â \r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Best Interests \r\nCox argues the family court erred in finding TPR is in Jordanâ€™s best interests.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAfter finding one of the grounds for termination exists, section 20-7-1572 of the South Carolina Code Annotated (Supp. 2005) requires a determination that the termination is in the best interest of the child.Â  (â€œThe family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child. . .â€).Â  In a termination of parental rights case, the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 258, 519 S.E.2d 351, 356 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Termination of parental rights statutes â€œmust be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by terminating the parent-child relationship.Â  The interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental interest conflicts.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp.Â  2005). The purpose of the termination of parental rights statute is as follows:\r\n\r\n[T]o establish procedures for the reasonable and compassionate termination of parental rights where children are abused, neglected, or abandoned in order to protect the health and welfare of these children and make them eligible for adoption by persons who will provide a suitable home environment and the love and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life.Â Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1560 (Supp. 2005)\r\nWe agree with the family courtâ€™s finding the termination of Coxâ€™s parental rights is in Jordanâ€™s best interests.Â  Jordan has spent more than twenty months in foster care, and it would be in his best interest to be free for adoption, which would end his involvement in the foster care system and provide a stable family.Â  Moreover, Cox has proven unable to provide a secure and adequate environment for rearing a child.Â  See S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 632, 614 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2005) (stating the fundamental purpose of terminating parental rights is to provide the greatest possible protection for a child whose parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for the physical and emotional needs of the child).Â  Accordingly, the order terminating Coxâ€™s parental rights is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Cox previously had been incarcerated from May 16, 2001 until July 15, 2002.Â  \r\n[2] Â Coxâ€™s prison sentence ended in July 2005.Â  \r\n[3] SCDSS filed the action against both Cox and Long, and the family court terminated both parentâ€™s parental rights after a joint hearing; however, Cox is the sole appellant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-272","title":"Montgomery v.

DuRant, Jr., of Sumter, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellants challenge the trial courtâ€™s order finding no agreement to subdivide property existed and, if it did, the agreement was insufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds.[1]Â  We affirm.[2]  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe late David and Minnie Robinson owned 141.7 acres in Clarendon County. Â During a previous marriage, Minnie had two children, Willie and Alvertis Montgomery.Â  David and Minnie adopted one child, David, Jr.Â  \r\nMinnie died intestate in 1964; Alvertis died in 1974 survived by his wife, Almetta, and eleven children; Willie died testate in 1984 survived by a wife and three children, including Henry Montgomery, Mary Montgomeryâ€™s husband; David died in 1987, and his interest in the property passed to David Jr.Â  \r\nOn December 11, 2000, some of the parties with interest in the property met and divided the property on a hand-drawn map with the various parcels color-coded. Â The land was divided into three parcels with one going to David Jr., one to heirs of Alvertis, and one to heirs of Willie.Â  The reverse side of the map contained the following notation: Â â€œAgreed to â€˜colorsâ€™ in division on front of this sheet so that David Jr. receives 22 acres, Almetta [Alvertisâ€™ wife] 20 acres, children of Alvertis 40 acres, Willieâ€™s heirs 60 acres.â€Â  The following notes were handwritten beside the map:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Total acres:&nbsp;\r\n         141\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        David\r\n          Jr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         22\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n          * * *\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Alvirtis (sic)\r\n         59.5\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Willie&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         59.5\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Alvirtis (sic) heirsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        4.96 [a]cres each\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe document was signed by those present.Â  The agreement was confirmed at a subsequent meeting on November 13, 2001.[3]Â \r\nIn addition to the coding and handwritten notes concerning the division of the property, there were some handwritten notes relating to the subdivision of Willieâ€™s share.Â  Next to the map, Gloria Jenkins, one of Alvertisâ€™ eleven children, wrote the following: Â \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Willie heirs&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         11.9 acres each\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Henry-Mary[4]\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          J.C.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Kitty\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Josie\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Eleanor\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAppellant Mary Montgomery maintained this handwritten note constitutes a separate agreement among Willieâ€™s heirs. \r\nBy consent order dated September 15, 2003, the parties agreed to the overall, primary division of the property.Â  However, Mary still contended that the notations as to Willieâ€™s share constituted an agreement regarding the subdivision of Willieâ€™s share.Â  The consent order therefore contained a reservation for Mary to â€œbring before the Court and have full opportunity to address and seek a determination of the issue of a settlement agreement existing as to the property allotted to her by agreement purportedly reached in or about December 2000 . . . .â€Â  The 2003 order attached the partiesâ€™ map as an exhibit. Â \r\nMary Montgomery moved for a determination that she was entitled to the 11.9 â€œHenry-Maryâ€ acreage and 11.9 additional acres based on a side agreement she allegedly made with another heir, Josie, to purchase 11.9 acres.Â  She further contends that in reliance on the notes written on the map, she purchased the 11.9 acres from Josie and paid a large portion of the fee for the preparation of the survey. Â \r\nThe court declined to further divide the property as requested, finding a failure to prove the existence of a separate agreement to subdivide Willieâ€™s share of the property.Â  The court further ruled any such agreement must be in writing to satisfy the statute of frauds.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe â€œAgreementâ€\r\nAppellants argue the notation placed by Gloria Jenkins on the agreement proves the existence of a separate contract subdividing Willieâ€™s parcel among his heirs.Â  Appellants also argue the separate contract satisfies the statute of frauds. \r\nThe burden to prove the existence of a binding contract is on the party alleging the contract.Â  Griswold v. Texas Co., 163 S.C. 156, 173, 161 S.E. 409, 414-15 (1931).Â  A contract requires a meeting of the minds of all parties involved.Â  Hughes v. Edwards, 265 S.C. 529, 536, 220 S.E.2d 231, 234 (1975).Â  We find insufficient proof of a contract to subdivide Willieâ€™s property.Â  Gloria Jenkins testified she placed the notations on the agreement, â€œsimply dividing the 141 acres according to the family members.â€Â  Jenkins denied there was any agreement that the acres allotted to Willieâ€™s heirs would be partitioned as noted.Â  The attorneys present at the partiesâ€™ meetings swore in affidavits that the written agreement contained the terms agreed upon as to the primary division, but they were unaware of any agreement reached among the parties for a further subdivision.Â  Finally, only two of the eleven heirs affected by the alleged subdivision were present at the meeting when the notes were written.Â  We find insufficient proof of a contract.Â  \r\nBecause no contract existed, we need not reach the issue of whether the statute of frauds[5] would preclude enforcement of the alleged contract. Â See Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891, 894-95 (1989) (the statute of frauds requires a memorandum or note of an agreement relating to real estate to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged); Ruff v. Hudspeth, 122 S.C. 391, 395, 115 S.E. 626, 627 (1923) (the statute of frauds requires the writing to contain all of the essential elements of a contract).\r\nEstoppel\r\nAppellants also argue entitlement to the property based upon promissory estoppel.Â  Mary Montgomery alleges she personally paid more than her fair share of the survey costs in reliance on the alleged agreement. \r\nThe trial court did not specifically rule on promissory estoppel, thus the issue is not preserved for review.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (an issue not ruled upon by the trial court is not preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]There is some uncertainty whether all the named appellants are indeed appealing the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  It is nevertheless clear that Mary Montgomery is the principal, if not the sole, appellant.Â  We refer to them collectively as Appellants.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] The nonparticipating parties apparently agreed with the division, according to a note on the confirmation.\r\n[4] Mary Montgomery.\r\n[5] S.C.

Gregory, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-273\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2006 â€“ Filed June 8, 2006\r\n\r\nDISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJames D. Mosteller, III, of Barnwell, for Appellants.Â  \r\nKristina Michelle Anderson, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lucille Veneziani filed this fraud and negligent misrepresentation action against The Caroline Collection, Inc. and John W. Boyd and Caroline Boyd (collectively referred to as CCI).Â  Veneziani died during the pendency of the action and Sheila Ray, as personal representative of Venezianiâ€™s estate, moved to amend the complaint to request a jury trial and add additional causes of action.Â  CCI moved for summary judgment. Â The trial court denied CCIâ€™s motion for summary judgment and granted Rayâ€™s motion to amend.Â  CCI appeals.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn August of 2000, Veneziani became interested in a secretary in CCIâ€™s antique store.Â  The secretary was advertised as having been made in 1822 and formerly owned by â€œGovernor Morris, Ambassador to France.â€Â  The listed price was $20,000. Â \r\nVeneziani purchased the item for $14,000, paying $10,000 down and agreeing to pay $4,000.Â  She eventually paid $3,700 of the remaining balance.Â  Veneziani later had the item appraised and discovered it was a reproduction worth approximately $3,500. Â \r\nVeneziani filed this action on April 1, 2003 and did not request a jury trial.Â  Veneziani filed an amended complaint on April 21, 2003 and a second amended complaint by consent order on June 18, 2004.Â  CCI filed a motion for summary judgment on the fraud cause of action.Â  After a hearing on the matter, Veneziani died.Â  CCI moved for dismissal of the fraud cause of action, arguing it did not survive.Â  The trial court denied CCIâ€™s motions.\r\nRay then moved to amend to change the plaintiff to the estate, to add a claim for unfair trade practices, and to request a jury trial.Â  CCI also moved for summary judgment on the fraud and negligent misrepresentation causes of action, arguing they were personal to Veneziani and did not survive her death.Â  At the hearing, CCI argued the trial court should not allow Ray to amend the complaint as to the unfair trade practices claim, arguing it too was personal to Veneziani.Â  \r\nThe parties agreed the fraud cause of action was personal and it was dismissed.Â  The court granted Rayâ€™s motion to amend to add the unfair trade practices action and to include the request for a jury trial.Â  The court denied CCIâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the negligent misrepresentation cause of action. \r\nAPPEALABILITY\r\n\r\nCCI claims error on the following three issues:Â  1) the denial of the motion for summary judgment on the negligent misrepresentation claim; 2) allowing amendment of the complaint to add a claim for unfair trade practices; and 3) the grant of a jury trial.Â  We find the appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment is not appealable.Â  See Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 167, 580 S.E.2d 440, 443 (2003) (holding the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable, even after final judgment).Â  We likewise find the appeal of an order allowing amendment of a pleading is not immediately appealable.Â  See Lake City Dev. Corp. v. Gilbert Constr. Co., 283 S.C. 10, 11, 320 S.E.2d 494, 494 (Ct. App. 1984) (finding order granting amendment to add a party interlocutory and not immediately appealable).Â  \r\nAs to the appealability of the grant of a jury trial, the issue turns on whether CCI is entitled to a non-jury trial as a matter of right.Â  When a trial courtâ€™s order deprives a party of a mode of trial to which it is entitled as a matter of right, such order is immediately appealable.Â  Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 196, 607 S.E.2d 707, 709 (2005).Â  We accordingly must first review whether CCI is entitled to a non-jury trial as a matter of right before determining the appealability of the issue.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial courtâ€™s ruling on a partyâ€™s request for a jury trial will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  See King v. Shorter, 291 S.C. 501, 502-03, 354 S.E.2d 402, 403 (Ct. App. 1987) (applying abuse of discretion standard to Rule 38(b) motion).Â  See also Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C. 477, 490, 570 S.E.2d 535, 541-42 (Ct. App. 2002) (applying abuse of discretion standard to Rule 39 motion).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  CCI argues the trial court erred in granting Rayâ€™s request for a jury trial.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n    Rule 38(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides:Â  \r\n  \r\n    Any party may demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury by serving upon the other parties a demand therefor in writing at any time after the commencement of the action and not later than 10 days after the service of the last pleading directed to such issue. Â Such demand may be endorsed upon a pleading of the party.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n    Rule 38(b), SCRCP.Â  Whether a litigant is entitled to a jury trial on issues presented by an amended pleading, where no prior demand for a jury trial has been made, turns on whether the amended pleadings create new issues of fact.Â  King v. Shorter, 291 S.C. 501, 503, 354 S.E.2d 402, 403 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\n    In this case, the trial court allowed amendment of the complaint to add a claim of unfair trade practices.Â  The court expressly found â€œthat there has been a substantial change in the posture of the case with the death of the Plaintiff such that the requested Amendment would serve the interests of justice and not be prejudicial to the Defendant[s].â€Â  The court further found:Â  â€œGiven the fact that the Plaintiff is . . . add[ing] additional causes of action, the Court finds that Rule 38 . . . would allow this Amended Complaint to contain a jury trial request as a matter of right.â€Â  Although approximately two years passed between the original complaint and the final amended complaint requesting a trial by jury, we likewise find no prejudice to CCI.Â  \r\n    Under the abuse of discretion standard, we find no error.Â  See Hannah&nbsp;v. United Refrigeration Servs., Inc., 305 S.C. 394, 394, 409 S.E.2d 360, 361 (1991) (â€œA partyâ€™s failure to make a timely demand for a jury trial does not mean the opposing party acquires a right to have, as a matter of law, a non-jury trial.â€); Patterson v. McNeill-Patterson &amp; Assocs.,&nbsp;312 S.C. 471, 472 n.2, 441 S.E.2d 328, 329 n.2&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994) (finding Rule 39(b) does not limit the courtâ€™s discretion in ordering a trial by jury where a party does not meet the requirements of Rule 38(b)). \r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    We find the order denying CCIâ€™s motion for summary judgment is not appealable.Â  We also find the order granting amendment to add the cause of action for unfair trade practices is not immediately appealable.Â  Finally, we find the trial court did not err in granting the motion to amend the complaint as to Rayâ€™s request for a jury trial.Â  Therefore, we find CCI not entitled to a non-jury trial as a matter of right and the order granting a jury trial is therefore not immediately appealable.Â  Accordingly, the appeal is\r\n     DISMISSED.\r\n    HUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-274","title":"State v.

Mark Hayes, II, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-274\r\nHeard May 9, 2006 â€“ Filed June 8, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Jerry Davis appeals his conviction for forgery.Â  He contends the circuit court erred in permitting the State to impeach him with remote prior convictions that were similar to the charge for which he was being tried.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nDavis owned and operated a construction business in Spartanburg.Â  Â Â Around November 10, 1995, he reported the theft of a forklift to his insurance company.Â  The insurance company investigated the claim and found the theft had been reported to the police.Â  In turn, the insurance company paid the claim and sent Davis a check in the amount of $35,000 made out to Jerry Davis and the National Bank of South Carolina (NBSC).Â  Â Â Davis attempted to have the check endorsed at Nationsbank in Columbia, but Nationsbank refused because it was not the payee of the check. Â Davis testified he then sent the check to NBSC with a letter in which he asked for an endorsement.Â  Davis claimed the letter was returned with an endorsement.Â  Â Â Subsequently, he instructed his secretary, Teresa Smith, to open an account and deposit the check at Carolina First in Taylors, South Carolina. \r\nOn May 6, 1996, during the course of the investigation of the theft, the police suspected that Davis was driving a truck with a forklift on the back of it on Interstate 26 from Columbia towards Spartanburg.Â  Bobby Shealy, employed with the State Law Enforcement Division, parked in the median of the interstate to watch for Davis.Â  Shealy observed a truck with a forklift on it that matched the description of Davisâ€™s stolen forklift.Â  Shealy followed the truck and radioed for backup.Â  Once backup arrived, Shealy stopped the truck.Â  The driver of the truck informed Shealy he had rented the forklift from Davis and paid him $2,000 by check.Â  Later, the police found in Davisâ€™s possession the check with â€œrentalâ€ written on the subject line.\r\nA Spartanburg County grand jury indicted Davis for making a false statement to an insurer, presenting a false claim for payment of loss, and forgery.Â  At trial, the State elected to proceed with the charges of forgery and presenting a false claim for payment of loss. \r\nDuring trial, Smith testified that when Davis initially showed her the check, it did not contain any endorsements.Â  When Smith saw the check again, one or two days later, it contained the signatures of both Davis and Kaye Gaddis, an employee of NBSC.Â  Smith testified Davis instructed her to purchase â€œa â€˜for deposit onlyâ€™ stamp and stamp it over [Gaddisâ€™s] name so that the lady . . . at Carolina First bank couldnâ€™t see whose name was signed.â€Â  Â Â Smith followed Davisâ€™s instructions and deposited the check at Carolina First.\r\nAdditionally, Gaddis testified Davis presented the check to her for endorsement.Â  Gaddis checked the bankâ€™s records, but found NBSC had never conducted business with Davis.Â  According to Gaddis, Davis tried to persuade her to endorse the check by explaining the check was made out to the wrong bank.Â  Gaddis refused to endorse the check and testified the signature on the check (â€œKaye Gaddisâ€) was not hers.\r\nAs the trial proceeded, the State informed the court that it intended to introduce Davisâ€™s prior convictions which were beyond the ten-year limitation outlined in Rule 609, SCRE.Â  Davis objected to the introduction of any convictions prior to 1977.Â  The trial court ruled the probative value of the convictions outweighed any prejudicial effect.Â  The court then permitted the State to inquire about the following convictions: Â 1976, 1977, and 1985 convictions for grand larceny; 1974, 1975, and 1976 convictions for receiving stolen goods; a 1984 federal conviction for receiving, stealing and selling motor vehicles; and a 1988 conviction for interstate transfer of a stolen vehicle.Â  The court, however, refused to permit the solicitor from inquiring about a 1987 conviction for escape, a 1985 conviction for failure to stop, a 1975 conviction for possession of firearms, and convictions for assault.\r\nUltimately, the jury found Davis guilty of forgery but deadlocked on the charge of presenting a false claim.Â  \r\nDavis appealed his conviction for forgery, arguing the trial court erred in admitting into evidence his prior convictions that were more than ten years old.Â  State v. Davis, Op. No. 2000-UP-748 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 6, 2000).Â  On appeal, this court concluded the trial court did not articulate the specific facts and circumstances necessary to overcome the presumption against admissibility provided by Rule 609(b), SCRE.Â  Additionally, we were unable to determine if the trial court properly placed the burden of establishing the admissibility of the convictions on the State.Â  As a result, we remanded the case for the trial court to conduct a hearing on the admissibility of the prior convictions with instructions to apply the proper burden of establishing admissibility.Â  We also instructed the court to carefully weigh the probative value for impeachment with the prior convictions against the prejudice to Davis.Â  \r\nOn remand, the trial court found the probative value of the remote convictions outweighed their prejudicial value.Â  In reaching this conclusion, the court reasoned: Â (1) the State met its burden of proof to allow the introduction of the remote convictions and met the factors set forth by\r\nState v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 627, 525 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2000); (2) the impeachment value of the past convictions was high; (3) Davisâ€™s criminal record was significant in the interest of justice because of Davisâ€™s â€œvirtually unbroken string of convictions from 1971â€; (4) the convictions admitted were similar to the forgery charge; (5) Davisâ€™s testimony was highly important given he was one of two defense witnesses to testify; and (6) Davisâ€™s credibility was a central issue given his testimony was in direct contradiction to that of the Stateâ€™s witnesses. Â The court also determined that due to the overwhelming evidence in the record, the admission of the prior convictions had little to no prejudicial effect on the outcome of the case.Â  Based on the foregoing analysis, the court affirmed Davisâ€™s conviction.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission of prior convictions to impeach the credibility of a defendant is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and thus, his decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Green v. State, 338 S.C. 428, 433, 527 S.E.2d 98, 101 (2000); see \r\nState v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000)(â€œThe admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Accordingly, evidentiary rulings of the trial court will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error which results in prejudice to the defendant.â€)(citation omitted). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000); State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 654, 623 S.E.2d 122, 127 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The scope of cross-examination is within the discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent a showing of prejudice.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 174, 399 S.E.2d 595, 596 (1991).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nDavis argues the remand court erred in finding the similarity of the prior convictions to the current charge weighed in favor of their admissibility pursuant to Rule 609(b), SCRE.Â  We agree.\r\nRule 609, SCRE, governs the admissibility of convictions â€œ[f]or the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness.â€ Â Rule 609(a), SCRE.Â  â€œ[E]vidence that an accused has been convicted of [a crime that was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year] shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.â€ Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE. Â The admission of a prior conviction pursuant to Rule 609(a)(1) may, however, be limited depending upon the remoteness of the conviction.Â  Specifically, Rule 609(b) provides in pertinent part: \r\n\r\nEvidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\r\n\r\nRule 609(b), SCRE.Â  â€œThe party attempting to introduce the prior conviction for impeachment purposes has the initial burden of establishing the basis for its admission.â€Â  State v. Scriven, 339 S.C. 333, 340, 529 S.E.2d 71, 74 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nIn analyzing this rule, we have stated that if remote prior convictions â€œare either similar or identical to the charged offenses . . . the likelihood of a high degree of prejudice to the accused is inescapable.â€Â  Id. at 343, 529 S.E.2d at 76. Â This inherent prejudice occurs because evidence of similar offenses unavoidably suggests to the jury the defendantâ€™s propensity to commit the crime charged. Â State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 628, 525 S.E.2d 246, 249 (2000) (Colf II).Â  â€œTherefore, â€˜[s]ince evidence of any similar offense should be admitted only rarely, a similar conviction already presumptively barred from admission by Rule 609(b) should be admitted even more rarely.â€™â€ Â Id.Â  (quoting United States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414, 419 (4th Cir. 1981)).Â  \r\nOur supreme court, however, has espoused that similar prior convictions may be admissible in some situations. Â See Green v. State, 338 S.C. 428, 433, 527 S.E.2d 98, 101 (2000) (analyzing Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE and noting that federal courts have held that â€œprior convictions for the same or similar crimes are highly prejudicial and should be admitted sparingly,â€ but declining â€œto hold similar prior convictions inadmissible in all casesâ€).Â Â  Although similar prior convictions should not be categorically excluded, a trial court should be cognizant that treating prior crimes as if their similarity heightens their probative value is improper given the similarity actually increases the prejudicial effect.Â Â \r\nColf II, 337 S.C. at 628, 525 S.E.2d at 249.\r\nTurning to the instant case, the remand court based its decision in part on its finding that â€œthe convictions that the trial judge did admit for use for impeachment purposes were similar to the charges in the current case.â€Â \r\nIn view of this statement, we find the trial court incorrectly applied the factor regarding the similarity of the crimes and erroneously considered the past convictions more probative because they were similar.Â  See \r\nGreen, 338 S.C. at 434, 527 S.E.2d at 101 (â€œAdmission of evidence of a similar offense often does little to impeach the credibility of a testifying defendant while undoubtedly prejudicing him.â€). Â Based on this analysis, we hold the court erred as a matter of law and, thus, abused its discretion.Â  The similarity between the past convictions and the current charge actually made the convictions more prejudicial.Â  Davisâ€™s convictions for similar offenses were especially prejudicial given the jury may have concluded that the prior convictions implied Davis committed the offense with which he was charged.Â  Accordingly, the court erred in finding the similarity of the past convictions weighed in favor of admissibility.\r\nII.\r\nDavis also argues the remand court erred in finding the probative value of his remote convictions outweighed the prejudicial value.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder Rule 609(b), SCRE, the trial court must find â€œthat the probative value of the impeachment evidence substantially outweighs the prejudice to the accused.â€ Â Scriven, 339 S.C. at 341, 529 S.E.2d at 75.Â  Because Rule 609(b) raises a presumption against admissibility of remote prior convictions, a finding that the probative value outweighs the prejudice must be â€œsupported by specific facts and circumstances.â€Â  Id.Â  Therefore, when performing a 609(b) analysis, the trial court is required to carefully weigh the\r\ncompeting â€œinterests involved and articulate for the record the specific facts and circumstances supporting its decision.â€Â  Id.Â \r\nIn Colf II, our supreme court adopted a nonexclusive list of factors employed by federal courts when determining if the probative value of a prior conviction outweighs the prejudicial value. Â Colf II, 337 S.C. at 627, 525 S.E.2d at 248.Â  These factors are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The impeachment value of the prior crime.\r\n2. The point in time of the conviction and the witnessâ€™s subsequent history. \r\n3. The similarity between the past crime and the charged crime.\r\n4. The importance of the defendantâ€™s testimony. \r\n5. The centrality of the credibility issue. \r\n\r\nId. (listing factors and stating that â€œtrial courts should exercise their discretion in light of the facts and circumstances of each particular caseâ€).\r\nIn the instant case, the convictions the trial court admitted were remote and similar to the charges for which Davis was being tried.Â  This combination made their admission even more unlikely.Â  See Colf II, 337 S.C. at 628, 525 S.E.2d at 249 (stating â€œâ€˜[s]ince evidence of any similar offense should be admitted only rarely, a similar conviction already presumptively barred from admission by Rule 609(b) should be admitted even more rarelyâ€™â€ (quoting United States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414, 419 (4th Cir. 1981))).Â  Further, in determining probative value, the important factor to examine is whether the evidence proves a certain â€œfact, not how important proof of that fact is to the proponentâ€™s case.â€ Â State v. Colf,\r\n332 S.C. 313, 319, 504 S.E.2d 360, 362 (Ct. App. 1998) (Colf I), affâ€™d as modified, 337 S.C. 622, 525 S.E.2d 246 (2000) (Colf II). Â \r\nThe remand court found the Stateâ€™s case against Davis was overwhelming due to the fact that Davisâ€™s testimony denying he forged the signature on the check was the only evidence that the endorsement was not forged.Â  Moreover, the State was able to impeach Davisâ€™s denial with his convictions after 1977.Â  Additionally, Gaddis testified she did not endorse the check and Smith testified how Davis instructed her to stamp over Gaddisâ€™s signature.Â  Therefore, the State presented sufficient evidence to undermine Davisâ€™s testimony without the remote convictions.Â  See  Colf I,\r\n332 S.C. at 320, 504 S.E.2d at 363 (finding when the State has a strong case, â€œthe extrinsic offense may add little and consequently will be excluded more readilyâ€ (quoting United States v. Cathey, 591 F.2d 268, 276-77 (5th Cir. 1979))).Â  No special circumstances justified admission of the remote convictions. Â \r\nAt oral argument, the State contended our decision in State v. Bryant, 356 S.C. 485, 589 S.E.2d 775 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. granted (Apr. 7, 2005), required us to affirm the decision of the remand court.Â  Because we find Bryant distinguishable from the instant case, we reject this contention.Â  In Bryant, the defendant was convicted of murder and unlawful possession of a firearm.Â  The defendant appealed, arguing the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his prior bad acts and convictions.Â  In terms of the prior convictions, Bryant asserted the convictions were inadmissible under Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE, because their prejudicial effect outweighed their probative value.Â  Id. at 489, 589 S.E.2d at 777.Â  We affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision based on the following grounds:Â  (1) the trial court correctly found â€œtestimony could lead to an inference that Bryant was unworthy of credibility because of his prior convictionsâ€; (2) the court conducted the appropriate Colf analysis and balanced the prejudicial versus probative value of the convictions pursuant to Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE; and (3) evidence existed in the record to support its ruling. Id. at 493, 589 S.E.2d at 779.Â  Unlike the court in Bryant, the remand court in the instant case incorrectly found the similarity of the prior convictions to the charged offense increased the probative value of the convictions.Â  Moreover, the prior convictions in the instant case were extremely remote whereas Bryantâ€™s prior convictions were not given they were only two years old.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, the State urged this court to find that any error in the admission of the remote prior convictions constituted harmless error.Â  In support of this argument, the State pointed out the admission of the pre-1977 convictions was cumulative to the unchallenged admission of the post-1977 convictions.Â  As will be discussed, we agree with the State and affirm the order of the remand court.[1]\r\nIn ruling on the admission of the prior convictions, the remand court not only analyzed their admission under Rule 609, SCRE, but also found â€œthe admission of the prior convictions had very little, if any, prejudicial effect on the outcome of this case.â€Â  The court reached this decision based on the overwhelming evidence in the record and the lack of credibility of one of the defense witnesses.Â  Although we find the remand court erred in its analysis regarding the admission of the prior convictions, we agree with the courtâ€™s ultimate conclusion that their admission was harmless.Â  \r\nâ€œAn error is harmless if the defendantâ€™s guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no other result could have been reached.â€Â  State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 60, 609 S.E.2d 520, 524 (2005).Â  â€œThe circumstances of each individual case are to be considered.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIn addition, the error is harmless if the error could not have reasonably affected the outcome of the trial.â€Â  Id.\r\nHere, the State presented testimony that investigating officers found in Davisâ€™s possession a check for the rental of the forklift that Davis had reported to his insurance company as stolen.Â  Additionally, Kaye Gaddis, an employee of NBSC, testified that she did not endorse the insurance check because the NBSC bank records revealed that the bank had never conducted business with Davis as he had claimed.Â  She also stated that the signature on the check was not hers.Â  Smith, Davisâ€™s secretary, testified that when she was initially shown the check it did not contain any endorsements.Â  When Davis presented her the check a second time, Smith noticed that it contained the signatures of Davis and Gaddis.Â  Smith testified that Davis instructed her to purchase a â€œfor deposit onlyâ€ stamp and stamp it over Gaddisâ€™s name.Â  In addition to this overwhelming evidence of guilt, we would also note that Davis did not challenge the admission of the post-1977 convictions.Â  Accordingly, we hold the remand court properly found the admission of the convictions did not constitute prejudicial error.Â  See Johnson, 363 S.C. at 60, 609 S.E.2d at 524 (holding admission of prior convictions constituted harmless error where defense counsel introduced defendantâ€™s prior convictions on direct examination to lessen the impact they might have on defendantâ€™s credibility, the record contained other testimony that damaged defendantâ€™s credibility, and there was overwhelming evidence of defendantâ€™s guilt); cf. Scriven, 339 S.C. at 344, 529 S.E.2d at 77 (finding admission of prior convictions was not harmless error where convictions were eight years old at the time of trial, the prior convictions and the charged offenses were similar, and the prior convictions presented â€œa great likelihood of prejudice to the accusedâ€). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the remand court improperly determined that because the prior convictions were similar to the charged offense they were more probative given the similarity actually made the prior convictions more prejudicial.Â  Additionally, we find the remand court incorrectly found the probative value of Davisâ€™s remote convictions of similar crimes outweighed their prejudicial value.Â  We find, however, the remand court properly concluded that the admission of the remote convictions was not prejudicial.Â  Because there was overwhelming evidence of Davisâ€™s guilt, we agree with the remand court that the admission of Davisâ€™s prior convictions constituted harmless error.Â  Accordingly, the order of the remand court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because the remand court specifically ruled the admission of the pre-1977 convictions was not prejudicial to Davis, we affirm on this ground appearing in the record on appeal.Â  See State v. Arnold, 319 S.C. 256, 260 n.3, 460 S.E.2d 403, 405 n.3 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding Rule 220(c), SCACR, allows appellate court to affirm on any ground appearing in the record); see also Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 418, 526 S.E.2d 716, 722 (2000) (holding under Rules 208(b)(2) and 220(c), SCACR, a respondent, as a prevailing party in the trial court, may raise on appeal any additional reasons the appellate court should affirm the trial court regardless of whether the reasons were presented to or ruled on by the trial court, provided the respondentâ€™s additional sustaining grounds appear in the record on appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-275","title":"State v.

Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Robert Gibson appeals his convictions for armed robbery and kidnapping.Â  He contends the circuit court erred in declining to grant a mistrial after a witness referred to his status as a parolee.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately 10:15 p.m. on May 22, 2002, Michael Bethel left work and drove his uncleâ€™s 1990 white Cadillac to Rushâ€™s on Broad River Road in Columbia to get a milk shake.Â  After Bethel returned to his car, he realized that he had left his wallet inside Rushâ€™s.Â  Bethel drove around the parking lot, parked his car, and returned to Rushâ€™s.Â  As Bethel exited his car, he was approached by a male who asked him â€œwhere any weed was at.â€Â  Bethel did not respond and continued walking toward the restaurant. \r\nAfter retrieving his wallet, Bethel left Rushâ€™s and called his roommate on his cell phone at approximately 10:26 p.m.Â  When Bethel started the engine of his car, he was approached by an African-American male wielding a gun.Â  Bethel had seen the man exit the passenger side of a nearby parked car.Â  As Bethel got out of his car, the robber ordered him to get back into the car. Â The robber then sat down in the back seat of Bethelâ€™s car and pointed the gun at the back of Bethelâ€™s head.Â  \r\nThe robber instructed Bethel to drive to an apartment complex off of Broad River Road. Â As Bethel was driving, he noticed the car which the robber had been in was following him.Â  The robber then directed Bethel to stop and park on a side street.Â  After ordering Bethel to exit the vehicle, the robber demanded the chain that Bethel was wearing as well as his cell phone and pocket money.Â  The robber then drove off in Bethelâ€™s car. Â Bethel immediately called the police at 10:40 p.m.\r\nAn investigation by the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department revealed that Bethelâ€™s cell phone was used to call Gibsonâ€™s motherâ€™s cell phone at 10:58 p.m., 11:16 p.m., and 11:34 p.m. on the evening of the robbery.Â  June Collier, Gibsonâ€™s former girlfriend who lived in Horry County received a call from Gibson on Bethelâ€™s cell phone at approximately 11:46 p.m. on May 22, 2002, and at 1:21 a.m. the next morning.Â  Collier returned Gibsonâ€™s call and left a voicemail message on Bethelâ€™s phone.Â  As a result of this communication, Collier met Gibson and his passenger, Quinton Sanders, in Conway.Â  Gibson followed Collier back to her home.Â  Gibson and Sanders stayed with Collier and then left after breakfast on May 23, 2002. \r\nLater in the day, Gibson drove to Florence to visit with his former girlfriend, Tracey Porche. Â Porche testified that Gibson and Sanders arrived in an older model white car.Â  The three then left to pick up lunch at a nearby restaurant.Â  As they drove through town, Porche instructed Gibson to turn down the music in the car when she noticed a police officer.Â  Porche testified Sanders removed a gun from the glove compartment and placed it under his clothes when the officer began to follow them. Â According to the officer, Gibson began to drive in a â€œvery suspiciousâ€ manner.Â  Based on this observation, the officer requested that dispatch run a check on the license plate number.Â  When the license plate check revealed that the car was stolen and had been part of an armed robbery, the officer requested backup officers. Â Â Police officers surrounded the car after Gibson pulled into a McDonaldâ€™s.Â  Ignoring the officersâ€™ orders to the occupants to stop and put their hands in the air, Gibson sped up and a chase ensued.Â  \r\nGibson led officers on a high-speed chase through commercial and residential areas.Â  Porche testified that Sanders discarded the gun during the chase.Â  Ultimately, Gibson lost control of the car and jumped out while it was still in motion.Â  The officers were able to apprehend Gibson, Sanders, and Porche after the car crashed into a tree and caught on fire.Â  \r\nOn May 28, 2002, Bethel was presented with a photographic lineup in which he positively identified Gibson as the robber.\r\nA Richland County grand jury indicted Gibson for armed robbery and kidnapping.Â  A jury convicted Gibson of both of these charges.Â  The trial judge sentenced Gibson to two concurrent terms of fifteen years imprisonment.Â  This appealed followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nGibson argues the trial judge erred in declining to grant his request for a mistrial after Porche testified regarding his status as a parolee.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring direct examination of Porche, the solicitor questioned her regarding the high-speed chase.Â  Specifically, he inquired:\r\n\r\nQ.Â  Were they talking at all in the front seat during all this?\r\nA.Â Â  No, there wasnâ€™t much talk.Â  I was asking [Gibson] why he was running?Â  And he says something about parole.Â  And . . . he was asking the passenger was I all right after we went over 52 and the car was airborne.Â  But there wasnâ€™t much of a conversation in the car. \r\n\r\nWithout objection, the solicitor continued his direct examination and asked Porche eight more questions.Â  At the conclusion of Porcheâ€™s direct examination, Gibsonâ€™s counsel approached the judge and requested a conference outside the presence of the jury.Â  During this hearing, counsel stated:\r\n\r\nAt this point in time I move for a mistrial on this case.Â  The basis for the motion is [the solicitor] asked Ms. Porche about any conversation she heard in the car, asked himâ€”asked him why he was running from the police.Â  \r\nAnd her response was that he indicated something about him being on parole, thatâ€™s a reference to prior criminal conviction.\r\nThe record is clear I didnâ€™t jump up at that moment in time and object, but the damage had already been done.Â  I prefer not to ring the bell as loud as possible making an objection at that point in time.Â  I addressed the court in the matter as soon as possible without making a big deal about it in front of the jury.\r\nBut it does place his prior criminal history at issue in front of this jury when he has not so placed it himself.Â  It is a valid basis for a mistrial motion in that regard, and I would so move.Â  \r\n\r\nIn response, the solicitor asserted the testimony was admissible as part of the res gestae of the offenses and that he intentionally elicited testimony.Â Â Â  In the alternative, the solicitor contended the testimony did not constitute hearsay because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.Â  Even if the testimony was inadmissible, the solicitor argued that a mistrial was not warranted given it was a single statement that was â€œfairly vague and innocuous.â€ \r\nAfter hearing arguments from counsel, the trial judge determined the testimony improperly placed Gibsonâ€™s character into evidence.Â  Despite this holding, the court found a mistrial was not warranted.Â  Gibsonâ€™s counsel declined the judgeâ€™s offer to give a curative instruction to the jury. \r\nAs a threshold matter, we question whether Gibson properly preserved this issue for appellate review.Â  Gibsonâ€™s counsel did not immediately object to Porcheâ€™s reference to Gibsonâ€™s status as a parolee.Â  Counsel allowed the State to complete its direct examination before any objection to the testimony was verbalized.Â  Instead of contemporaneously objecting to the testimony, counsel moved for a mistrial.Â  Additionally, Gibsonâ€™s counsel refused the trial judgeâ€™s offer to issue a curative instruction. Â In view of these procedural errors, we believe Gibson waived any challenge to Porcheâ€™s statement.Â  See State v. Moultrie, 316 S.C. 547, 555-56, 451 S.E.2d 34, 39 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œOur courts have held a â€˜failure to contemporaneously objectâ€™ to the introduction of evidence claimed to be prejudicial â€˜cannot be later bootstrapped by a motion for a mistrial.â€™â€ (quoting State v. Lynn, 277 S.C. 222, 226, 284 S.E.2d 786, 789 (1981))); see also State v. Watts, 321 S.C. 158, 164-65, 467 S.E.2d 272, 276 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding defendant waived any argument regarding his denial of a mistrial based on testimony implicating he had a prior record where defense counsel refused trial judgeâ€™s offer to strike the testimony or issue a curative instruction); State v. Hartley, 307 S.C. 239, 244-45, 414 S.E.2d 182, 186 (Ct. App. 1992) (concluding defense counsel failed to preserve any argument concerning the Stateâ€™s attempt to impeach defendant with his prior convictions where counsel refused the trial judgeâ€™s offer to issue a curative instruction). Â Â \r\nEven if properly preserved, we find Gibsonâ€™s argument to be without merit.Â  The decision whether to grant or deny a motion for a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 12, 515 S.E.2d 508, 514 (1999).Â  â€œThe power of a court to declare a mistrial ought to be used with the greatest caution under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causesâ€ stated on the record by the trial judge.Â  State v. Kirby, 269 S.C. 25, 28, 236 S.E.2d 33, 34 (1977).Â  \r\nA mistrial should only be granted when â€œabsolutely necessary,â€ and a defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial.Â  State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 63, 530 S.E.2d 626, 628 (2000).Â  â€œWhether a mistrial is manifestly necessary is a fact specific inquiry.â€Â  State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. 454, 457, 539 S.E.2d 717, 719 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œ[T]he trial judge should exhaust other methods to cure possible prejudice before aborting a trial.â€Â  Council, 335 S.C. at 13, 515 S.E.2d at 514.\r\nIn the instant case, Porcheâ€™s statement was a vague and isolated comment regarding Gibson status as a parolee.Â  Moreover, our appellate courts have found a mistrial was not warranted where a trial judge admitted even more egregious testimony implicating a defendantâ€™s prior record.Â  See, e.g., Council, 335 S.C. at 12-13, 515 S.E.2d at 513-14 (affirming trial judgeâ€™s refusal to grant a mistrial where SLED agent testified that he retrieved defendantâ€™s fingerprint card from SLED records for comparison); State v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 510-11, 476 S.E.2d 903, 912 (1996) (finding mistrial was not warranted where witnessâ€™s reference to defendantâ€™s possible drug dealing was vague and no testimony was presented establishing this behavior); State v. Creech, 314 S.C. 76, 81-82, 441 S.E.2d 635, 638 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendantâ€™s motion for a mistrial where officer testified that he obtained warrants for defendantâ€™s arrest and contacted â€œthe Probation Officerâ€). Â Accordingly, we conclude the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Gibsonâ€™s motion for a mistrial.Â Â  \r\nEven if the judgeâ€™s decision to deny Gibsonâ€™s motion for a mistrial constituted error, we find any error would be deemed harmless.Â  Whether an error is harmless depends upon the circumstances of the specific case.Â  State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 172, 508 S.E.2d 870, 876 (1998).Â  Error is harmless when it could not have reasonably affected the result of the trial.Â  State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 93-94, 180 S.E.2d 888, 889-90 (1971).Â  â€œ[W]here a review of the entire record establishes the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction should not be reversed.â€Â  State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 531, 466 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1996). Â \r\nHere, Bethel positively identified Gibson as the man who robbed him and then stole his car.Â  Cell phone records showed that shortly after the robbery Bethelâ€™s phone was used to contact Gibsonâ€™s mother and his two former girlfriends.Â  After receiving a phone call from Gibson, Porche left a voicemail message on Bethelâ€™s cell phone which Bethel later turned over to the investigating officers.Â  Finally, Gibson was apprehended while driving Gibsonâ€™s car.Â  Thus, there was overwhelming evidence establishing Gibsonâ€™s guilt for the offenses of armed robbery and kidnapping.\r\nBased on the foregoing, Gibsonâ€™s convictions and sentences are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-276","title":"Hopkins v.

Drew, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-276\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2006 â€“ Filed June 8, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nFrancis T. Draine, of Columbia, for Appellant.Â  \r\nHarold P. Threlkeld, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Nelle Brown appeals the denial of her motion to vacate the default judgment against her.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1919, John Wesley Brown acquired a house and lot at 703 East Greenville Street in Anderson, South Carolina (the property).Â  Thereafter, Brown lived on the property with his wife, Lillian, and their ten children until his death in 1948.Â  Brown devised the property to his widow for her life, with the remainder to their children.[2]Â  After Lillian Brownâ€™s death, George Brown, Sr., John and Lillianâ€™s son, and his wife Nelle, the appellant in this case, continued to live on the property with the consent and permission of the other owners.Â  As a condition of living on the property rent free, the Browns were required to maintain the property and the house, including paying the taxes and insuring the property.Â  The property was destroyed by fire on April 29, 2001, and shortly thereafter, George, Sr. died from injuries sustained in that fire.Â  As a result of the fire, Nelle and her son, George, Jr., vacated the property, and their whereabouts were generally unknown to other family members.Â  \r\nIn December of 2002, the City of Anderson condemned the remains of the burned residence on the property and attempted to notify owners of the condemnation.Â  Mildred Brown Hopkins, granddaughter of John Wesley Brown and a resident of Anderson, was the only co-owner of the property who could easily be located.Â  She was the only family member officially notified of the cityâ€™s demolition requirement.Â  The city would demolish the structure at the ownersâ€™ expense or the owners could arrange for demolition themselves.Â  Hopkins was able to obtain the consent of all co-owners for demolition except for Nelle Brown, whom she was unable to locate.Â  \r\nIn March 2003, Hopkins contracted with Millerâ€™s Construction Company to demolish the structure for $21,100, which Hopkins paid.Â  In April, Hopkins filed an action against the co-owners of the property to foreclose on a mechanicâ€™s lien to recover the cost of the demolition and to partition the property and the proceeds of the fire insurance policy.Â  All the co-owners Hopkins was able to serve consented to foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien and the partition action.Â  \r\nHopkins was unable to ascertain the whereabouts of Nelle Brown in order to serve her.Â  Thereafter, Hopkinsâ€™ attorney contacted an attorney who had represented Nelle in an action related to the property prior to the fire.[3]Â  The attorney indicated the pleadings could be mailed to him for acceptance of service.Â  However, he never actually accepted service, and notified Hopkins in July of 2003 that he no longer represented Nelle, would not accept service on her behalf, and could not disclose her whereabouts.Â  \r\nHopkins attempted to locate Nelle, but was unable to discern her whereabouts or even confirm if she was living or deceased.Â  The Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Office could likewise not locate her.Â  Hopkins then petitioned for an Order of Publication for purposes of effecting service on Nelle.Â  The Petition was granted, and notice was published in The Journal, a newspaper published in the town of Williamston, as the newspaper most likely to give notice to Nelle Brown.[4]Â  In addition, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-740, a copy of the pleadings was mailed to Nelle at her last known address, 703 East Greenville Street.Â  \r\nNo responsive pleadings were filed by Nelle Brown.Â  Notice of a merits hearing to be held before the master was sent to Nelle Brown at her last known address.Â  \r\nHopkins testified that she had attempted to contact all of the other family members/co-owners.Â  She further testified that Nelle Brown had been close and on good terms with Hopkinsâ€™ mother until George, Jr. returned to the area from Washington, D.C.Â  After that time, according to Hopkins, George, Jr. and to some degree George, Sr., kept Nelle in seclusion and no longer allowed contact between Nelle and other family members.Â  Hopkins stated that she believed she had acted in the best interests of all the co-owners by having the property demolished.Â  \r\nThe court granted foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien and decreed the partition.Â  The property was sold at public sale to Anderson Area Medical Center, Inc. in March 2004, and the proceeds were disbursed in accordance with the courtâ€™s decree.Â  Then, in April, Hopkinsâ€™ attorney was contacted by James Stone Craven, who indicated that he was representing Nelle Brown with regard to the property.Â  Nelle filed an action against Hopkins and the other co-owners regarding the property.Â  It is unclear from the record the exact nature of the action, but the claims arising therefrom were dismissed on summary judgment.Â  Nelleâ€™s portion of the proceeds from the sale of the property, $43,902.18, was forwarded to her attorney.Â  In January of 2005, Nelle Brown moved to have the default judgment as to the mechanicâ€™s lien and partition of the property set aside. Â The denial of her motion is the subject of this appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhether to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the judge.Â  Our standard of review, therefore, is limited to determining whether there was an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Raby Const., L.L.P.&nbsp;v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 17, 594 S.E.2d 478, 482 (2004) (internal citations omitted).Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP, provides that the court may relieve a party from a final judgment for mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, on the basis of newly discovered evidence, for fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party, or if the judgment is void or has been discharged.Â  A motion under 60(b) â€œshall be made within a reasonable time.â€Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nNelle contends the trial court erred in failing to set aside the judgment for several reasons.Â  First, she contends the affidavits used to procure the default judgment were fraudulent.Â  She further argues the judgment should have been vacated because she was not served with notice on an unliquidated damages claim and that the service by publication was faulty.Â  Finally, Nelle contends the court erred by ordering that proceeds from the insurance policy on the property be divided among the co-owners.\r\nThe crux of Nelleâ€™s contentions seems to be that she was â€œtheâ€ owner of the property and that Hopkins intentionally failed to provide her with notice of any claims or proceedings in order to deprive her of her property and the proceeds related thereto.Â  There is simply no evidence in the record to support these allegations.Â  \r\nThe record reveals that Hopkins filed a petition for publication indicating that she could not locate Nelle Brown and believed her whereabouts were being secreted in order to avoid service.Â  An affidavit was filed by the sheriffâ€™s office indicating that it had attempted to serve Nelle but was unable to do so.Â  There is nothing facially defective about these documents nor is there any testimony in the record that would indicate the information contained therein was untrue.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the record shows that notice of the January 20, 2004 hearing was mailed to Nelle Brown at her last known address.Â  She argues that such notice was insufficient.Â  However, the damages prayed for by Hopkins were liquidated, rendering notice of a damages hearing unnecessary.Â  See Thomas &amp; Howard Co., Inc. v. T.W. Graham &amp; Co., 318 S.C. 286, 457 S.E.2d 340 (1995) (holding that when damages are liquidated or a verified complaint for unliquidated damages is sufficient to allow the amount of the claim to be determined, a damages hearing is not required).Â  In any event, according to Rule 5(b), SCRCP, service by regular mail to a defendantâ€™s last known address is all that is required even if the damages in this case are considered to be unliquidated.Â  Therefore, if notice was required, the notice given was adequate.Â  \r\nThe nature of the action in this case was in rem as opposed to in personam.Â  Nelle Brown was only a defendant in the case by virtue of her standing as a co-owner of the property.Â  She was not exposed to personal liability for any â€œdamagesâ€ to which Hopkins may have been entitled.Â  Hopkins requested from the court the amount she had expended in demolishing the home and for taxes she had paid.Â  She further sought costs and attorneyâ€™s fees associated with the action, the partitioning of the property and the distribution of insurance proceeds according to the co-ownersâ€™ respective interests set forth in detail in the complaint.Â  These items all relate to the property and do not constitute the type of unliquidated damages frequently at issue in a damages hearing.Â  Even if they were, the amounts at issue were determinable by reference to the complaint.Â  \r\nWith regard to service by publication, the record shows that The Journal is a newspaper of general circulation in Anderson County, South Carolina, the county in which Nelle was last known to reside.Â  It is the clerkâ€™s responsibility to select the newspaper â€œmost likely to give notice to the person to be served.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-740 (Rev. 2005).Â  There is no evidence that publication in The Journal was faulty.Â  Finally, any issue regarding the distribution of insurance proceeds was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Therefore, such issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and rule upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\nBecause we can discern no abuse of discretion in the masterâ€™s denial of the motion to vacate, that judgment is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  The children of any deceased heirs would receive their parentâ€™s share.Â  \r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  This action was dismissed for failure to prosecute.Â  \r\n[4] Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Order of Publication appointed E.

Celia Robinson, both of Columbia, for Appellant.Â  \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Gary Russell Hunsucker appeals his convictions for first degree burglary, conspiracy, armed robbery, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nDr. Jim Haswell testified that around 8:30 p.m. on August 25, 2003, a small, thin man forced his way into Haswellâ€™s house, put a gun to his head, and took $160.Â  After robbing Haswell, the assailant fled across the front yard, got in the passenger side of a dark colored sedan, and sped off.Â  Haswell described his assailant as around 140 or 150 pounds and about five feet ten inches tall.Â  Haswell further testified his assailant â€œsmelled heavily of tobacco smoke,â€ was wearing blue baggies or booties over his feet, a blue bandana across his face, a blue cap, and rubber surgical gloves.Â  \r\nHunsucker was apprehended about a week after the incident.Â  Teresa Hennigan, the officer who booked him, testified that Hunsuckerâ€™s physical characteristics at the time of booking matched Haswellâ€™s description.Â  Hennigan further testified that during the booking process she collected one lighter, one cigarette, and two packs of unopened cigarettes from Hunsuckerâ€™s person.Â  \r\nMatthew Faison was also charged for the robbery.Â  Faison testified that on the day of the robbery Hunsucker asked Faison for a ride because he needed â€œto go pick up some money.â€Â  Faison, who apparently did not have a car, testified he called John Hayes, a/k/a A.J., an acquaintance who did have a car.Â  Soon thereafter, Hayes arrived and Faison and Hunsucker got into Hayesâ€™ car.Â  Hunsucker, according to Faisonâ€™s testimony, was wearing a blue do-rag, â€œdoctor gloves,â€ and trash bags on his shoes.Â  \r\nAccording to Faison, Hunsucker directed Hayes to drive to Haswellâ€™s house.Â  Upon arriving, Hunsucker went to the front door, knocked on it, and when it opened pointed a gun at the face of the â€œdudeâ€ who answered the door.Â  Following a verbal exchange to which Faison was not privy, Haswell eventually handed something to Hunsucker.Â  Hunsucker returned to the car, and Hayes drove Hunsucker to his home.Â  Faison and Hayes continued on to their respective homes.Â  \r\nThe State also called Hayes to testify.Â  Hayes testified he weighed 200 pounds, was six feet tall, and drove a four-door 2001 maroon Pontiac.Â  The State attempted to question Hayes about a statement he gave to the police regarding his knowledge of the robbery.Â  Hayes admitted he gave a statement but refused to comment on the statement and refused to testify about the Haswell robbery.Â  Hayesâ€™ statement was not admitted into evidence.Â  Hunsucker informed the court he did not want to ask Hayes any questions, and Hayes was excused without being cross-examined.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly\r\nerroneous. Â State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  On review, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  Id.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).Â  In order for an error to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant.Â  State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 372-73, 453\r\nS.E.2d 890, 891 (1995).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Restriction of Cross-Examination of Testifying Co-Conspirators\r\nHunsucker contends the trial court committed reversible error in restricting cross-examination of Faison and Hayes regarding the length and nature of the sentences avoided by them through cooperation with the State.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe confrontation clause guarantees a defendant the opportunity to cross-examine a witness concerning bias.Â \r\nState v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 331, 563 S.E.2d 315, 317 (2002).Â  â€œConsiderable latitude is allowed in the cross examination of an adverse witness to show bias.â€Â  State v. McFarlane, 279 S.C. 327, 330, 306 S.E.2d 611, 613 (1983).Â  \r\nâ€œThe Confrontation Clause does not, however, prevent a trial judge from imposing any limits on defense counselâ€™s inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness.Â  On the contrary, trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination . . . .â€Â \r\nState v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 385, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1994).Â  Still, before cross-examination may be limited, the record must clearly show that the cross-examination is somehow inappropriate. Â Id. at 385-86, 444 S.E.2d at 527.Â  â€œThe limitation of cross-examination is reversible error if the defendant establishes he was unfairly prejudiced.â€Â \r\nState v. Brown, 303 S.C. 169, 171, 399 S.E.2d 593, 594 (1991).Â  \r\nA.Â  Cross-Examination of Matthew Faison\r\nOn direct examination, Faison admitted pleading guilty to the armed robbery of Haswell and three separate counts of strong armed robbery.Â  In addition, Faison admitted pleading guilty to various other charges including forgery, financial transaction card fraud, and aggravated assault and battery.Â  Faison testified the State recommended all sentences on the aforementioned charges run concurrent, including a twelve year no parole sentence for armed robbery, in exchange for Faisonâ€™s cooperation with the State in the prosecution of Hunsucker.Â  \r\nOn cross-examination, Hunsucker attempted to question Faison regarding the length and nature of the possible sentences he avoided through cooperation with the State.Â  During a proffer, Faison admitted that he faced a potential sentence of ninety-five years if fully prosecuted and convicted of the crimes charged against him.Â  The trial court held Hunsucker could not elicit testimony regarding the possible length of the sentences associated with the various crimes charged against Faison because such information would suggest the potential sentence Hunsucker might face if found guilty.Â  \r\nGenerally, the jury is not entitled to learn the possible sentence of a defendant because the sentence is irrelevant to the finding of guilt or innocence.Â  Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 331, 563 S.E.2d at 318.Â  â€œâ€˜The purpose of preventing disclosure of the potential sentence facing the defendant is that such evidence is irrelevant to the jury and could possibly prejudice the Stateâ€™s right to a fair trial.â€™â€ Â State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 453, 602 S.E.2d 62, 73 (Ct. App. 2004) (citation omitted).Â  â€œHowever, other constitutional concerns, such as the Confrontation Clause, limit the applicability of this rule in circumstances where the defendantâ€™s right to effectively cross-examine a co-conspirator witness of possible bias outweighs the need to exclude the evidence.â€Â  Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 331-32, 563 S.E.2d at 318.Â  \r\nWe find the trial court erred in prohibiting Hunsucker from cross-examining Faison regarding the possible punishments avoided through cooperation with the State.Â  In State v. Brown, the supreme court held the trial court erred in not allowing the defendant to cross-examine a key witness who was â€œpermitted to avoid a mandatory prison term of more than three times the duration she would face on her plea . . . .â€Â  303 S.C. at 171, 399 S.E.2d at 594.Â  The court held the witnessâ€™s avoidance of such a punishment was â€œcritical evidence of potential biasâ€ that should be presented to the jury.Â  Id.Â  Similarly, Faisonâ€™s cooperation with the State helped him secure a recommendation of twelve years imprisonment and avoid a possible punishment of more than ninety years.Â  Thus, as in Brown, the trial courtâ€™s denial of meaningful cross-examination of Faison, a key witness, outweighs the Stateâ€™s interest in excluding the evidence because the potential punishment avoided by Faison far exceeded the sentence received.Â  \r\nNevertheless, a violation of the confrontation clause is subject to a harmless error analysis.Â  State v. Clark, 315 S.C. 478, 481, 445 S.E.2d 633, 634 (1994).Â  â€œWhether an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Â No definite rule of law governs this finding; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.â€Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).Â  \r\nWe do not believe the error could have reasonably affected the result of the trial.Â  During cross-examination, Hunsucker asked Faison, â€œ[W]hat will happen if you donâ€™t testify for the government here today?â€Â  Faison replied, without objection from the State, â€œI get 30 years added on to my time.â€Â  Thus, Hunsucker established that Faison received a substantially reduced sentence in exchange for his testimony, thereby demonstrating Faisonâ€™s bias and motive.Â  We thus find no reversible error. \r\nB.Â  Cross-Examination of John Hayes\r\nHunsuckerâ€™s argument regarding the limitation of cross-examination of Hayes regarding his bias is not preserved.Â  Hunsucker argued that allowing the solicitor to question Hayes about specifics in his statement, when Hayes refused to testify, constituted hearsay and violated Hunsuckerâ€™s due process and confrontation rights. Â However, Hunsucker never attempted to cross-examine Hayes as to his bias.Â  Accordingly, the issue on appeal is not preserved for appellate review.Â  State v. Hudgins, 319 S.C. 233, 237, 460 S.E.2d 388, 390-91 (1995) (finding issue not preserved where not argued at trial).\r\nII.Â  Trial Courtâ€™s Participation in the Examination of a Witness\r\nHunsucker next argues the trial court committed reversible error in participating in the examination of a witness and improperly commenting on the facts of the case.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs part of the Stateâ€™s case, the State presented testimony from Darren Yarborough, a criminal investigator for the Florence County Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  Yarborough testified about taking the statements of both Faison and Hayes and about searching Hunsuckerâ€™s house.Â  During direct examination of Yarborough, the trial court interrupted and asked Yarborough, â€œ[I]n your interrogation of [Faison and Hayes], that (sic) each of them independently separately incriminate Mr. Hunsucker[?]â€Â  Yarborough responded, â€œYes, sir.â€Â  Hunsucker objected to the trial courtâ€™s question.Â  The trial court granted Hunsuckerâ€™s objection.Â  The trial court then instructed, â€œIgnore the question and the answer, ladies and gentlemen.Â  [At] [s]ome point that question may or may not become relevant.â€Â  Hunsucker made no further objections or motions regarding the trial courtâ€™s question or instruction.Â  \r\nThis issue is not preserved for our review.Â  â€œ[P]rejudicial remarks in the course of a trial made by the court must be seasonably objected to and an exception noted, in the absence of which the question will not be ordinarily reviewed on appeal.â€Â \r\nLipscomb v. Poole, 247 S.C. 425, 433-34, 147 S.E.2d 692, 697 (1966).Â  â€œ[I]f the objecting party accepts the ruling of the trial judge and does not contemporaneously object to the sufficiency of a curative instruction or move for mistrial, the error is deemed cured, and the issue is not preserved for appeal.â€Â  State v. Moyd, 321 S.C. 256, 263, 468 S.E.2d 7, 11 (Ct.

Ness, Daniel W.

(â€œAMCOâ€) as an individual defendant.Â  Because we find the circuit courtâ€™s order is interlocutory and not immediately appealable, we dismiss the appeal. [1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn October 2003, AMCO submitted a bid, which Southern Patio accepted, for the preparation and removal of five transformers from the second floor mezzanine level of a former textile plant that was recently purchased by Southern Patio.Â  During discussions surrounding the project, the parties agreed the oil contained within the transformers needed to Â be pumped out and transported separately in fifty-five gallon drums. \r\nAfter the job was awarded, AMCO obtained a Material Safety Data Sheet to determine what type of oil or other substance the transformers contained.Â  A review of this data sheet revealed that the oil contained â€œpolychlorinated biphenyls,â€ or PCBs.Â  As a result, AMCO employees wore protective suits, gloves, eye protection, and respirators during the removal process.Â  During this process, AMCO employees spilled oil on the floor in an area surrounding the transformers.Â  A crane operator, hired to remove the barrels and transformers from the loading dock to the transportation truck, noticed the oil spill and alerted AMCO employees, including James Evans, the president of AMCO.Â  As a result of the oil spill, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was contacted to assess the situation.Â  After its inspection, the EPA imposed fines against Southern Patio and required decontamination of all affected areas.Â  Southern Patio contracted with a third-party company to complete the clean-up process.\r\nOn April 13, 2004, Southern Patio filed a Complaint against AMCO in which it asserted causes of action for negligence, breach of contract, and equitable indemnity.Â  In its Answer, AMCO generally denied the allegations and counterclaimed for payment of work performed.\r\nDuring discovery, Southern Patio deposed Evans and Neil Noland, an employee of the clean-up company.Â  Based on these depositions, Southern Patio filed a motion on August 29, 2005, pursuant to Rule 15(a), SCRCP, in which it sought to amend its Complaint to add Evans as an individual defendant. Â In its motion, Southern Patio contended that Evans had â€œtaken several steps individually for which he should be personally liable, in addition to AMCO Constructionâ€™s vicarious liability for the acts of its employees.â€ Â Specifically, Southern Patio claimed Evans did not review the Material Safety Data Sheet â€œuntil after the job was awarded and just hours prior to beginning the process of pumping out the PCB oil.â€Â  Additionally, Southern Patio asserted that Evans made the decision to remove the oil from the transformers, a decision Noland opined was outside the accepted practice in the industry.Â  \r\nAMCO opposed the motion, arguing any action taken by Evans regarding the project was solely â€œin his [corporate] capacity as the president and an employee of AMCO Construction.â€Â  AMCO also expressed its belief that Southern Patio was only attempting to add Evans as a defendant â€œbecause they are concerned about AMCOâ€™s ability to pay a judgment, if one is obtained.â€Â  AMCO contended that the proper procedure would be for Southern Patio to institute an action to pierce the corporate veil if it obtained a judgment.\r\nThe circuit court held a hearing on Southern Patioâ€™s motion.Â  By order dated October 20, 2005, the court denied the motion.Â  In ruling on the motion, the court found Southern Patio failed to allege that â€œthe actions of Mr. Evans were undertaken in his personal capacity.â€ The court further found there were no actions complained of that would â€œsuggest any personal duty of Mr. Evans which he owed to the Plaintiff.â€Â  The court also stated, â€œthe torts alleged in the Complaint relate to the spilling of transformer oil and there is no allegation that Mr. Evans personally spilled the oil or directed or sanctioned the spilling of the oil.Â  As such, there is no ground for adding Mr. Evans as a party to this case.â€Â  Finally, the court held AMCO and Evans would be prejudiced by the late amendment given the case was on the roster for the term of court beginning on October 31, 2005.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nAs a threshold issue, Southern Patio argues the circuit courtâ€™s order denying its motion to amend is immediately appealable because â€œit made a determination of the merits of the case and affected a substantial right.â€Â  We disagree.[2]  \r\nâ€œThe right of appeal arises from and is controlled by statutory law.Â  An appeal ordinarily may be pursued only after a party has obtained a final judgment.â€Â  Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 194, 607 S.E.2d 707, 708 (2005) (citations omitted). Â â€œAn order which does not finally end a case or prevent a final judgment from which a party may seek appellate review usually is considered an interlocutory order from which no immediate appeal is allowed.â€Â \r\nId. at 195, 607 S.E.2d at 709.\r\nâ€œAbsent some specialized statute, the immediate appealability of an interlocutory or intermediate order depends on whether the order falls within S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330.â€Â  Edwards v. Suncom, Op. No. 26148 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 15, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 19 at 21, 22).Â  This section provides:\r\n\r\n(1) Any intermediate judgment, order or decree in a law case involving the merits in actions commenced in the court of common pleas and general sessions, brought there by original process or removed there from any inferior court or jurisdiction, and final judgments in such actions; provided, that if no appeal be taken until final judgment is entered the court may upon appeal from such final judgment review any intermediate order or decree necessarily affecting the judgment not before appealed from;\r\n(2) An order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an\r\nappeal might be taken or discontinues the action, (b) grants or refuses a new trial or (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof or any pleading in any action;\r\n(3) A final order affecting a substantial right made in any special proceeding or upon a summary application in any action after judgment; and\r\n(4) An interlocutory order or decree in a court of common pleas granting, continuing, modifying, or refusing an injunction or granting, continuing, modifying, or refusing the appointment of a receiver.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, Southern Patio contends the circuit courtâ€™s order effectively determined the merits of its cause of action against Evans and affected a substantial right.Â  Thus, we confine our analysis to sections 14-3-330(1) and (2)(a).\r\nIn terms of these specific sections, our supreme court has explained what constitutes an intermediate order involving the merits and affecting a substantial right as follows:\r\n\r\nAn order which involves the merits is one that â€œmust finally determine some substantial matter forming the whole or a part of some cause of action or defense.â€Â  Mid-State Distribs., Inc., 310 S.C. at 334, 426 S.E.2d at 780.Â  Interlocutory orders affecting a substantial right may be immediately appealed pursuant to Â§ 14-3-330(2). Â Orders affecting a substantial right â€œdiscontinue an action, prevent an appeal, grant or refuse a new trial, or strike out an action or defense.â€ Id. at 335 n.4, 426 S.E.2d at 780 n.4. \r\n\r\nEx Parte Wilson, 367 S.C. 7, 13, 625 S.E.2d 205, 208 (2005).\r\nIn analyzing this case, we find guidance from the above-outlined principles as well as our supreme courtâ€™s decision in Baldwin Construction Company, Inc. v. Graham, 357 S.C. 227, 593 S.E.2d 146 (2004).Â  In Baldwin, the construction company filed suit against the Grahams for foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien as well as related causes of action.Â  The Grahams sent a letter to the construction company in which they responded to the allegations.Â  After retaining counsel, the Grahams moved for permission to file an amended Answer with set-offs and counterclaims.Â  In conjunction with this motion, the Grahamsâ€™ counsel also requested a jury trial.Â  The circuit court denied the motions on the ground the relief requested would be â€œunduly prejudicial.â€Â  Id. at 229, 593 S.E.2d at 147.Â  Our supreme court dismissed the appeal on the ground that it was interlocutory and not immediately appealable.Â  Id. at 230, 593 S.E.2d at 147.Â  In reaching this conclusion, the supreme court found the circuit court â€œdid not rule on the substantive contents of the answer, nor did the order strike a pleading.â€Â  Id.Â  Instead, our supreme court found the circuit court merely refused to allow the Grahams to file the answer.Â  In light of this procedure, our supreme court concluded the denial of the Grahamsâ€™ motion to amend their Answer was not immediately appealable because the Grahams would still be able to appeal the decision at the conclusion of the trial.Â  Id. at 230, 593 S.E.2d at 147-48.Â  \r\nAlthough we recognize the facts of the instant case are slightly different from those in Graham, we nevertheless find the decision instructive.Â  We believe the two cases differ in that the circuit court in this case appeared to rule on the â€œsubstantive contentsâ€ of the amended complaint whereas the circuit court in Graham only refused to allow the filing of the amended Answer.Â  This distinction does not dissuade us from relying on the analysis in Graham.Â  In the present case, the circuit court may have gone a step further than the court in Graham in that it discussed the allegations against Evans.Â  However, the ultimate result in the two cases was the same, i.e., the courtâ€™s decision, like the court in Graham, refused Southern Patioâ€™s request to file an amended pleading.Â  Thus, the order neither finally determined a â€œsubstantial matter forming the whole or part of a some cause of action or defenseâ€ nor â€œdiscontinue[d] an action, prevent[ed] an appeal . . . or [struck] out an action or defense.â€ Â Ex parte Wilson, 367 S.C. at 13, 625 S.E.2d at 208. Â Accordingly, we conclude the circuit courtâ€™s order is not immediately appealable.Â  See Tatnall v. Gardner, 350 S.C. 135, 138, 564 S.E.2d 377, 379 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding trial courtâ€™s order denying defendantâ€™s motion to amend her answer to assert third-party claims was not immediately appealable because order â€œneither determine[d] a substantial matter â€˜forming the whole or part of some cause of action,â€™ nor prevents â€˜a judgment from being rendered in the actionâ€™ from which [defendant] could then seek reviewâ€); cf. Collins v. Sigmon, 299 S.C. 464, 466, 385 S.E.2d 835, 836 (1989) (â€œAn order permitting amendment of pleadings is interlocutory and generally is not appealable until final judgment.â€). \r\nII.\r\nAlthough we decline to rule on Southern Patioâ€™s remaining issues, we deem it necessary to address Southern Patioâ€™s legitimate concern that it will be barred in the future from alleging any individual action against Evans in light of the circuit courtâ€™s rulings. Â \r\nBased on our review of the order, we find the circuit court did not make a final determination regarding the merits of the action alleged against Evans in his individual capacity.Â  Instead, we believe the language used by the court indicated that it focused exclusively on the allegations in Southern Patioâ€™s Complaint and did not delve into the merits.Â  In addition to the specific language in the order, we also find significant that the court made its decision based on a scant record and did not have before it any conclusive evidence regarding Evansâ€™s individual capacity.[3]Â  Furthermore, the court did not deny the motion solely on the allegations against Evans but also found the late amendment would be prejudicial to AMCO.Â  Therefore, we find Southern Patio is not precluded from alleging, at the procedurally appropriate time, a cause of action against Evans in his individual capacity.Â  See Collins, 299 S.C. at 466, 385 S.E.2d at 836 (â€œA motion to amend an Answer should be contested primarily by procedural arguments, not arguments concerning the substance and merits of the counterclaims and/or defenses proposed . . . It follows that the trial judge should generally not consider these substantive arguments at the mere amendment stage.â€); Pruitt v. Bowers, 330 S.C. 483, 488, 499 S.E.2d 250, 253 (Ct. App. 1998)(declining to rule on interlocutory order where trial court had not had an opportunity to rule on the sufficiency of the allegations in the pleadings and stating â€œ[a]rguments going to the legal merits of the proposed pleadings are better taken up in the context of a Rule12(b) motion to dismiss or a Rule 56, SCRCP, motion for summary judgmentâ€).\r\nBased on the foregoing, Southern Patioâ€™s appeal is dismissed without prejudice.\r\n APPEAL DISMISSED.Â Â  \r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â Â  Southern Patio raises two other issues on appeal.Â  Because we believe the first issue is dispositive, we address only that issue.Â  \r\n[3]Â Â  Southern Patio appears to recognize the limited record given it informed this court that several depositions were not submitted to the circuit court based on the procedural posture of its motion to amend pursuant to Rule 15, SCRCP.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-279","title":"Williamson v.

Pierce Campbell, of Florence, for Respondent Bermuda Run Horizontal Property Regime; and Reynolds Williams, of Florence, for Respondents Bermuda Run Investor Development Group, Inc. and Bermuda Run Horizontal Property Regime.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Anna Belle Williamson, the owner of a condominium at Bermuda Run, brought this action alleging her homeownersâ€™ association, Bermuda Run Horizontal Property Regime (â€œBermuda Runâ€), entered into an unauthorized transaction to transfer a common element to the Bermuda Run Investor Development Group (â€œBRIDGâ€).Â  Bermuda Run and BRIDG (collectively, â€œRespondentsâ€) brought counterclaims against Williamson for, among other things, slander of title and tortious interference with economic relations.Â  The master in equity ruled in favor of Respondents on all claims.Â  Williamson appeals.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nBermuda Run is a condominium complex in Horry County consisting of common elements and forty-four separate units.Â  Williamson is the owner of a condominium at Bermuda Run.Â  She purchased her unit in August 1985.Â  \r\nAt an annual meeting on May 16, 1998, the board of directors of Bermuda Run adopted a resolution authorizing Bermuda Run to execute the necessary documents to trade its existing driveway to BRIDG, a South Carolina corporation, in exchange for Bermuda Run receiving title to two tracts of property owned by BRIDG that were contiguous to Bermuda Run and obtaining a non-exclusive easement for purposes of ingress and egress.Â  The resolution stated BRIDG and Bermuda Run also agreed that each would have the use of the otherâ€™s amenities, such as parking areas and other common elements.Â  Of the four directors of Bermuda Run, only one member, O.D. Murray, voted in favor of the resolution.Â  The remaining three members, Alfred Agnew, Richard Clayton, and Larry Maust, abstained from voting.[1]Â Â Â  \r\nOn June 3, 1999, Bermuda Run recorded a deed transferring title to BRIDG for the driveway leading into Bermuda Run.Â  Thereafter, on December 30, 1999, Williamson filed a lis pendens and a complaint seeking damages against Bermuda Run, BRIDG, and members and officers of each for allegedly conveying a common element, i.e., the driveway, without the approval of all the Bermuda Run homeowners.Â  \r\nOn June 5, 2000, Williamson filed an amended complaint that included three causes of action:Â  (1) negligence as to Bermuda Run board members Murray and Clayton, (2) fraudulent conveyance as to all defendants, and (3) ultra vires acts as to Bermuda Run and to Murray and Clayton, individually and as members of the Bermuda Run board of directors.Â  BRIDG, Agnew, and Myers asserted counterclaims for slander of title and tortious interference with economic relations.Â  Bermuda Run asserted counterclaims for slander of title, tortious interference with economic relations, and abuse of process.Â Â Â  \r\nThe defendants filed motions to dismiss Williamsonâ€™s claims.Â  By order dated January 19, 2001, the circuit court, Judge J. Michael Baxley presiding, dismissed the fraudulent conveyance claim as to all defendants, but allowed Williamsonâ€™s claims based on negligence and ultra vires acts to survive.Â  Judge Baxley apparently vacated the lis pendens on the property by order on February 5, 2001.[2]Â  \r\nBy order filed June 11, 2001, Judge B. Hicks Harwell of the circuit court ordered Williamson to pay BRIDG, Myers (President of BRIDG), and Agnew (Secretary/Treasurer of BRIDG) attorney fees, costs, and expenses in the amount of $25,000.Â  Judge Harwell granted the fees â€œpursuant to the South Carolina Frivolous Proceedings Sanctions Act and Rule 11 SCRCP.â€Â  He further stated he was granting â€œBRIDGâ€™s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment upon liability and for an entitlement to attorney[] fees under its slander of title counterclaim.â€Â  Judge Harwell referred to a master in equity the other issues raised in the motion submitted by BRIDG, Agnew, and Myers, including:Â  (1) whether BRIDG was entitled to partial summary judgment as to liability on its counterclaim for tortious interference with economic relations and (2) whether BRIDG suffered additional damage above its attorney fees for slander of title and, if so, the extent thereof.Â  \r\nWilliamson immediately appealed only the award of attorney fees.Â  We affirmed on the ground that the issue she raised regarding the fees was not preserved because it was not argued at trial.Â  See Williamson v. Bermuda Run, 2002-UP-594 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Sept. 26, 2002).Â Â Â  \r\nWilliamson, through her attorney, abandoned her negligence claim at the beginning of the proceeding before Master in Equity J. Stanton Cross, Jr. in December 2004.Â  The master noted that Williamson was proceeding solely on her ultra vires claim and the only other issues before the court were the counterclaims of Respondents.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the master found Williamson had not established her claim regarding ultra vires acts and had not proved damages.Â  As to BRIDGâ€™s counterclaims, the master applied the law of the case doctrine and found Judge Harwellâ€™s order precluded Williamsonâ€™s defense of the slander of title counterclaim.Â  The master further found BRIDG had proved each element its counterclaim for tortious interference with economic relations, but â€œsuch finding [was] not necessary to [his] decision because the damage[s] arising from the tortious interference with BRIDGâ€™s economic relations are identical to the damages [caused] by [Williamsonâ€™s] slander of BRIDGâ€™s title.â€Â  The master awarded BRIDG a judgment of $70,185.24 for the slander of title and tortious interference claims, plus $17,500 in attorney fees and costs.Â  \r\nAs to Bermuda Runâ€™s counterclaims for slander of title, tortious interference, and abuse of process, the master granted Bermuda Run a judgment of $445,000.Â  In finding for Bermuda Run, the master did not specify which cause of action he was basing the award on, but stated, â€œI found the testimony of Dr. Kenneth Eugene Lehrer to have been well-considered, authoritative, probative, and convincing.Â  Bermuda Run was damaged by the Plaintiff and those damages equal $445,000.â€[3]Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate only if â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Marine Contracting &amp; Towing Co., 301 S.C. 418, 421, 392 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1990).\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002); Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 564 S.E.2d 94 (2002); see also Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74 (1999) (â€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€).Â  \r\nâ€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Ultra Vires Acts\r\nWilliamson contends the master erred in finding her allegation of ultra vires acts was not properly brought as a derivative action as required by section 33-31-304 of the South Carolina Code.Â  We disagree.\r\nBermuda Run was formed as a South Carolina nonprofit corporation.[4]Â  Article II of its Articles of Incorporation clearly states â€œthe Corporation shall be conducted as a non-profit organization for the benefit of its members.â€Â  Article III of the Articles of Incorporation goes on to state â€œ[t]he Corporation shall have all of the powers and privileges granted to corporations not for profit under the law pursuant to which this Corporation is chartered.â€Â  \r\nSection 33-31-304 of the South Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act specifically governs ultra vires actions.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-304 (2006).Â  It generally provides that a nonprofit corporationâ€™s power to act may not be challenged as ultra vires unless brought in a specific manner as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), the validity of corporate action may not be challenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to act. \r\n(b) A corporationâ€™s power to act may be challenged in a proceeding against the corporation to enjoin an act where a third party has not acquired rights.Â  The proceeding may be brought by the Attorney General, a director, or by a member or members in a derivative proceeding. \r\n(c)Â  A corporationâ€™s power to act may be challenged in a proceeding against an incumbent or former director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation.Â  The proceeding may be brought by a director, the corporation, directly, derivatively, or through a receiver, a trustee, or other legal representative, or in the case of a public benefit corporation, by the Attorney General. \r\n\r\nAlthough subsection (b) states the â€œproceeding may be brought by the Attorney General, a director, or by a member or members in a derivative proceeding,â€ the way in which Williamson brought this action does not satisfy any of these options.Â  It is clear neither the Attorney General nor a director brought the action; therefore, as noted by the master, the only available alternative was for a member or members to bring the action in a derivative proceeding.Â  Williamson failed, however, to comply with the requirements for bringing a derivative action.Â  \r\nRule 23 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure outlines the requirements for bringing a derivative action as follows:\r\n\r\n(b)(1) Derivative Actions by Shareholders. In a derivative action brought by one or more shareholders or members to enforce a right of a corporation or of an unincorporated association, the corporation or association having failed to enforce a right which may properly be asserted by it, the complaint shall be verified and shall allege that the plaintiff was a shareholder or member at the time of the transaction of which he complains or that his share or membership thereafter devolved on him by operation of law. Â The complaint shall also allege with particularity the efforts, if any, made by the plaintiff to obtain the action he desires from the directors or comparable authority and, if necessary, from the shareholders or members, and the reasons for his failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort. Â The derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the shareholders or members similarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation or association. The action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to shareholders or members in such manner as the court directs.\r\n\r\nRule 23, SCRCP.\r\nA derivative action that does not meet the pleading requirements of Rule 23(b)(1), SCRCP, is properly dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  See generally Carolina First Corp. v. Whittle, 343 S.C. 176, 539 S.E.2d 402 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Williamson did not plead the necessary information in her complaint to bring a derivative action.Â  A reading of Williamsonâ€™s complaint and her testimony at trial shows that she did not bring the action on behalf of the corporation, a group of shareholders, or anyone other than herself.Â  When specifically asked for whom the lawsuit speaks, Williamson answered she did not speak for any of the other Bermuda Run homeowners.Â  Williamson did not allege in her complaint that it is a derivative action, and she asked for personal damages in excess of $1.5 million dollars.Â  She also did not allege in the complaint that a demand was made on the board as required by Rule 23, SCRCP.Â  Williamson failed to properly plead her derivative claims.Â  Consequently, she failed to state a claim for ultra vires acts and the master did not err by denying relief on this basis. \r\nII.Â  Slander of Title \r\nWilliamson next contends the master erred in ruling slander of title was the â€œlaw of the caseâ€ as to BRIDG and in finding for both BRIDG and Bermuda Run on their counterclaims for slander of title.\r\nA.Â  Law of the Case\r\nIn considering BRIDGâ€™s counterclaim for slander of title, the master stated BRIDG â€œhas been granted judgment on its counterclaim for slander of titleâ€ based on Judge Harwellâ€™s order of June 11, 2001 and â€œ[t]hat is the law of this case.â€Â  Williamson contends this was error as Judge Harwellâ€™s ruling on this point was not the â€œlaw of the case.â€Â  \r\nâ€œThat a decree from which no appeal is taken becomes the law of the case in all subsequent proceedings involving the same parties and the same subject matter is the well-settled law in this state . . . .â€Â  Matheson v. McCormac,&nbsp;187 S.C. 260, 263, 196 S.E. 883, 884&nbsp;(1938).Â  â€œLaw of the case,â€ as a term of art, technically was not the correct term to be used here, as the masterâ€™s comments could be taken to indicate Judge Harwellâ€™s order could no longer be appealed.Â  In Link v. School District of Pickens County, 302 S.C. 1, 6, 393 S.E.2d 176, 179 (1990), however, our supreme court held that when a trial court declares summary judgment on one of several issues in a case, a party can wait to appeal from the final judgment disposing of all issues.Â  Accordingly, an appeal of the issue of slander of title as it pertains to BRIDG is timely.Â  \r\nWhat the master probably intended to convey is that he was not at liberty to reconsider Judge Harwellâ€™s 2001 ruling as to summary judgment because his mandate as to BRIDG was to consider damages only.[5]Â  See, e.g., Binkley v. Burry, 352 S.C. 286, 295, 573 S.E.2d 838, 843 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œGenerally, one circuit court judge may not reverse or modify the order of another circuit court judge.â€).Â  Any challenge to the grant of summary judgment to BRIDG was properly to be made via an appeal.Â  We note, however, that to the extent Judge Harwellâ€™s order awarded $25,000 in attorney fees to BRIDG, the ruling is final because that issue was immediately appealed by Williamson in a prior proceeding and we affirmed the award solely on error preservation grounds.Â Â Â  \r\nB.Â  Merits\r\nThe case of Pond Place Partners, Inc. v. Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 18-19, 567 S.E.2d 881, 890 (Ct. App. 2002) defines slander of title as follows:\r\n\r\nâ€œThe term â€˜slander of titleâ€™ is defined as a false and malicious statement, oral or written, made in disparagement of a personâ€™s\r\ntitle to real or personal property, causing him injury.â€ Â 50 Am.Jur.2d Libel &amp; Slander Â§ 548 (1995). Â Generally, an action under slander of title may only be maintained by one who possesses an estate or interest in the affected property. Â See generally Jeffrey F. Ghent, Slander of Title: Sufficiency of Plaintiffâ€™s Interest in Real Property to Maintain Action, 86 A.L.R.4th 738 (1991). Â â€œThe tort of slander of title is almost identical to the tort of product disparagement, the only difference being that the former tort involves aspersing the quality of oneâ€™s title to property and the latter tort involves aspersing the quality of oneâ€™s property.â€Â  Wendyâ€™s of South Jersey, Inc. v. Blanchard Mgmt. Corp. of N.J., 170 N.J.Super. 491, 406 A.2d 1337, 1338 (Ch.Div.1979).\r\n\r\nIn Huff v. Jennings, 319 S.C. 142, 459 S.E.2d 886 (Ct. App. 1995), we set forth for the first time in South Carolina a six-point test that a plaintiff must satisfy to maintain an action for slander of title:Â  \r\n\r\n(1) the publication (2) with malice (3) of a false statement (4) that is derogatory to plaintiffâ€™s title and (5) causes special damages (6) as a result of diminished value of the property in the eyes of third parties. Â \r\n\r\nId. at 149, 459 S.E.2d at 891. \r\nThough the master found Williamson was liable for slander of title, this was predicated on his determination that Bermuda Run was authorized to enter into the transaction to convey a common element and thus had not committed an ultra vires act.Â  Williamson purportedly committed slander of title by alleging the transaction was unauthorized.Â Â  \r\nâ€œ[A] corporation may exercise only those powers which are granted to it by law, by its charter or articles of incorporation,\r\nand by any bylaws made pursuant thereto; acts beyond the scope of the powers so granted are ultra vires.â€Â  Seabrook Island Property Owners Assâ€™n v. Pelzer,&nbsp;292 S.C. 343, 347, 356 S.E.2d 411, 414&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987).\r\nThe master found Respondents did not act beyond the powers granted to them by law and the governing documents of Bermuda Run because the sale of property was an authorized transaction.Â  In so doing, the master relied upon section 33-3-102 of the South Carolina Code, which states in pertinent part:Â  â€œUnless its Articles of Incorporation provide otherwise, every corporation . . . has the same powers as an individual to do all things necessary or convenient to carry out its business and affairs, including without limitation the power to . . . sell, convey, mortgage, pledge, lease, exchange, and otherwise dispose of all or any part of is property . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-3-102 (2006).Â  The master also relied upon the Articles of Incorporation, finding Article 3 expressly allowed Bermuda Run to have all the powers and privileges granted to non-profit corporations.Â  Â Â \r\nAlthough these provisions generally authorize Bermuda Run to buy, sell, or transfer its land, these provisions do not expressly authorize Bermuda Run to sell property that it does not own.Â  Both the express language of the Master Deed and the South Carolina Horizontal Property Act, in fact, appear to preclude the actions taken by the board. \r\nUnder the Master Deed, the property at issue is a common element owned solely by the condominium owners.Â  Any transfer of that property requires the approval of all of the homeowners. Â \r\nParagraph V of the Master Deed for Bermuda Run expressly states:Â  â€œThe percentage of undivided interest in the COMMON ELEMENTS assigned to each UNIT shall not be changed except with the unanimous consent of all the owners of all the units.â€Â Â Â  \r\nParagraph VI of the Master Deed prohibits the separate conveyance of the common elements:Â  â€œThe undivided interest in the COMMON ELEMENTS declared to be an appurtenance to each UNIT shall not be conveyed, devised, encumbered or otherwise dealt with separately from said UNIT . . . .â€Â  See also 4 S.C. Juris. Condominiums Â§ 18 (1991) (â€œCommon elements may neither be conveyed nor encumbered except as an appurtenance to an apartment. . . .Â  The apartment owners hold title to the regime common elements under a unique arrangement of concurrent ownership, which is neither a simple joint tenancy, since survivorship provisions are absent, nor a tenancy in common, since partition is prohibited.â€).Â Â Â  Â \r\nParagraph X of the Master Deed further provides:Â  â€œRecognizing that the proper use of a UNIT by any owner or owners is dependent upon the use and enjoyment of the common elements . . . and that it is in the interest of all owners of UNITS that the ownership of the COMMON ELEMENTS be retained in common by the owners of UNITS in the CONDOMINIUM, it is declared that the percentage of the undivided interest in the COMMON ELEMENTS appurtenant to each UNIT shall remain undivided . . . .â€Â Â Â  Â \r\nMoreover, the South Carolina Horizontal Property Regime Act states the common elements shall not be divided.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-70 (1976) (â€œThe common elements, both general and limited, shall remain undivided and shall not be the object of an action for partition or division of the co-ownership.Â  Any covenant to the contrary shall be void.â€).Â  It is undisputed that the resolution adopted by Bermuda Run purported to transfer a portion of the common elements to BRIDG without the consent of the owners.Â  Neither the master nor Respondents cite to any authority expressly authorizing a homeownersâ€™ association to transfer title to the common elements without the consent of the owners.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the element which requires a false statement cannot be satisfied because Williamson never made false statements concerning the actions of Bermuda Run or BRIDG.Â  Bermuda Runâ€™s transaction was contrary to the provisions of the Master Deed and the Horizontal Property Act.Â  Thus, we hold the master erred in finding Williamson liable for slander of title and reverse that finding as to both BRIDG and Bermuda Run.\r\nIII. Tortious Interference with Economic Relations and Abuse of Process\r\nWilliamson also contends the master erred in finding her liable on Respondentsâ€™ counterclaims for tortious interference with economic relations and abuse of process.Â  We agree.\r\nA.Â  Tortious Interference\r\nRandy Drew entered into an option agreement to purchase property from BRIDG and purportedly signed a Joint Use Agreement with Bermuda Run in 1999.Â  Later that year, Drew terminated his option, stating he had only recently become aware that some of the residents objected to the transaction.Â  Drew was given copies of legal opinions obtained by BRIDG concluding there would be problems in enforcing the agreement in light of the failure to obtain the consent of all of the homeowners.Â  Drewâ€™s decision to not exercise his option to purchase was the basis for the counterclaims alleging tortious interference with economic relations.\r\nAs to BRIDGâ€™s claim, the master found â€œthat BRIDG has proven each element of this cause of actionâ€ because BRIDGâ€™s sale of its property to Drew for $595,000 â€œwas [] cancelled as a direct and proximate result of [Williamsonâ€™s] conduct.â€Â  The master found the sale probably would have closed on August 1, 2000, but BRIDG had mitigated its damages and sold the property on October 21, 2002 for a net price of $642,100.[6]Â  The master ultimately concluded BRIDG was entitled to statutory interest of 8.75% from August 1, 2000 to October 21, 2002 for the loss of the use of its $595,000, but this amount was mitigated by the more favorable sales price, for net damages of $70,185.24, plus attorney fees.Â  \r\nIn finding for Bermuda Run, the master did not specify which cause of action he was basing the award on, but summarily stated, â€œI found the testimony of Dr. Kenneth Eugene Lehrer to have been well-considered, authoritative, probative, and convincing.Â  Bermuda Run was damaged by the Plaintiff and those damages equal $445,000.â€[7] Â Â Â \r\nâ€œThe elements of a cause of action for tortious interference with contract are: (1) existence of a valid contract; (2) the wrongdoerâ€™s knowledge thereof; (3) his intentional procurement of its breach; (4) the absence of justification; and (5) resulting damages.â€Â  Camp v. Springs Mortgage Corp., 310 S.C. 514, 517, 426 S.E.2d 304, 305&nbsp;(1993).Â  Again, although the master found Williamson liable for tortious interference with economic relations, this conclusion was predicated on his finding that Bermuda Run had not committed an ultra vires act.Â  The first element of the claim for tortious interference with economic relations is missing here.Â  As has been demonstrated above, Bermuda Run did not have the ability to enter into the contract with BRIDG because both the Master Deed and the Horizontal Property Act prohibited it.Â  Furthermore, for reasons similar to those in deciding the issue of slander of title, the master erred in finding Williamson is liable for tortious interference with economic relations because Williamsonâ€™s assertion of an ultra vires act has merit and the requisite element of â€œabsence of justificationâ€ is not present.Â  Drewâ€™s business decision to terminate the transaction because of the uncertainty as to ownership does not support the claim alleged here for tortious interference.\r\nB.Â  Abuse of Process\r\nâ€œThere are two essential elements required for an abuse of process action: Â (1) an ulterior purpose, and (2) a willful act in the use of the process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceedings.â€Â  Broadmoor Apartments of Charleston v. Horwitz,&nbsp;306 S.C. 482, 486, 413 S.E.2d 9, 11&nbsp;(1991).Â  Â â€œ[T]he issuance of the process may be justified in itself; it is the malicious misuse or perversion of the process for an end not lawfully warranted by it that constitutes the tort known as abuse of process.â€Â  Huggins v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., 249 S.C. 206, 209, 153 S.E.2d 693, 695 (1967).Â  â€œ â€˜[A]n abuse of process is the employment of legal process for some purpose other than that which it was intended by the law to effect--the improper use of a regularly issued process.â€™ â€Â  Id. at 210, 153 S.E.2d at 695 (citation omitted).\r\nSome definite act or threat is required; there is no liability where the party has done nothing more than carry out the process to its authorized conclusion, even though with bad intentions.Â  Id. at 208, S.E.2d at 694.Â  The improper purpose usually takes the form of coercion; there is, in other words, a form of extortion, and it is what is done in the course of negotiation, rather than the issuance of the process itself, which constitutes the tort.Â  Id.Â  In the current appeal, Williamson could not be found liable for abuse of process when her actions were legitimate.Â  Though she pled her action incorrectly, the fact that she filed suit cannot support an abuse of process claim.\r\nIV. Â Attorney Fees and Costs\r\nWilliamson lastly contends the master erred in awarding BRIDG $17,500 in attorney fees and costs.Â  We agree.\r\nThe master found BRIDG was entitled to a total award of attorney fees and costs in the amount of $17,500.Â  An award of attorney fees will be reversed when the substantive results achieved by counsel are reversed on appeal.Â  Camburn v. Smith, 355 S.C. 574, 581, 586 S.E.2d 565, 568 (2003); see also Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 503, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666 (1993).Â  Accordingly, because we are reversing the award to BRIDG on its counterclaims, we likewise reverse the masterâ€™s award of $17,500 for attorney fees and costs.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the masterâ€™s decision to deny Williamsonâ€™s claim alleging an ultra vires act due to her failure to properly plead the claim as a derivative one.Â  We reverse the judgments in favor of Respondents on all counterclaims.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Agnew was also an officer of BRIDG.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  This order is referred to, but not included, in the record on appeal.\r\n[3]Â  Lehrer submitted an affidavit setting forth an â€œEconomy Summaryâ€ dated December 2, 2004, showing a total of $445,986 in damages.Â  It included line items for a loss on a purchase option and construction losses.Â  The largest component in the total was $240,700 for the net present value of future losses from 2003/04 to 2038/39.Â Â Â  \r\n[4]Â  The record contains a master deed establishing The Bermuda Run Horizontal Property Regime in August 1985.Â  In addition, the record contains the Articles of Incorporation for the Bermuda Run Property Owners Association, Inc. creating a nonprofit corporation in August 1986.Â  The parties refer to these organizations interchangeably as â€œBermuda Runâ€ in their briefs.Â Â Â  \r\n[5]Â  In her brief, Williamson also contends the master erred in finding his mandate was to determine whether BRIDG suffered any damages above and beyond its expenses and attorney fees from her slander of BRIDGâ€™s title.Â  The trial courtâ€™s June 11, 2001 order clearly mandated that one of the issues to be addressed by the master was â€œ[w]hether BRIDG has suffered additional damage, above and beyond its expenses and attorney[] fees, for the Plaintiffâ€™s slander of its title . . . .â€Â  \r\n[6]Â  The master refers to both October 1, 2002 and October 21, 2002; the date of sale appears to be October 21, 2002.Â  The master further indicated his finding as to tortious interference was â€œnot necessary to [his] decision . . . because the damage arising from the tortious interference [action is] identical to the damages [from slander of title].â€Â Â Â  \r\n[7]Â  In their briefs the parties seem to assume the master awarded damages to Bermuda Run based on all of the claims.Â  Since the parties read the order as being based on all three claims and we find, in any event, that all of the claims fail on their merits, we address them all here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-280","title":"Ingram v.

Farry and David A. Wilson, both of Greenville, for Appellant-Respondents.\r\nVernon F. Dunbar, of Greenville, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this Workersâ€™ Compensation case, Sonoco Products Company (Sonoco) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing the Full Commission and affirming the Single Commissionerâ€™s order awarding benefits to Francis Ike Johnson.Â  The circuit court found the Full Commission failed to comply with a regulation requiring it to vote within ten days and thereby affirmed the Single Commissioner by default.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nFrancis Ike Johnson worked at Sonoco from 1971 to 1994.Â  Johnson stopped working at Sonoco in January 1994 after he was hospitalized for pulmonary problems.Â  In 1999, Johnson filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim against Sonoco, which Sonoco denied.Â  \r\nAt a hearing before the Single Commissioner, Johnson argued his exposure to the chemical Perlite aggravated his pulmonary problems which rendered him permanently and totally disabled.Â  In May 2002, the Single Commissioner issued an order, finding Johnson sustained an accidental pulmonary injury as a consequence of his contact with harmful chemicals, including Perlite, while working at Sonoco.Â  The Single Commissioner ordered Sonoco to pay Johnson permanent and total disability compensation.Â  \r\nIn June 2002, Sonoco appealed the decision to the Full Commission, and the Full Commission held a hearing on October 30, 2002.Â  The following day, October 31, 2002, one of the three commissioners on the Full Commission wrote Johnsonâ€™s and Sonocoâ€™s legal counsel to inform them that a vote on the matter would be delayed.Â  On May 28, 2003, almost seven months after the hearing on the matter, the Full Commission issued its order reversing the Single Commissioner, finding Johnson failed to prove he sustained a compensable injury while working at Sonoco.Â  Johnson appealed the Full Commissionâ€™s order. Â \r\nIn September 2004, both parties appeared before the circuit court.Â  On the day of the hearing, Johnson argued the Full Commission violated a regulation requiring it to vote within ten days of the hearing.Â  Johnsonâ€™s attorney recounted that after the Full Commission rendered its opinion, he asked for the vote sheets showing each commissioner registered his or her vote within the ten day time period, but the vote sheets could not be found.Â  Johnson submitted to the circuit court affidavits from two former commissioners and employees of the Full Commission attesting to the voting procedure employed by the Full Commission.Â  Sonoco objected to these affidavits as outside the record and not properly before the circuit court.Â  \r\nAfter the hearing, the circuit court wrote Johnsonâ€™s and Sonocoâ€™s legal counsel to inform them that it would accept Johnsonâ€™s affidavits but also open the record to accept additional extrinsic evidence on the issue of whether there were procedural irregularities below.Â  Sonoco sought to depose Johnsonâ€™s affiants, which the trial judge allowed, but with some limitations.Â  The circuit court allowed Sonoco to depose both former commissioners and one of two Full Commission employees, but did not allow Sonoco to depose Johnsonâ€™s legal counsel, who was a former commissioner.Â  Sonoco deposed both former commissioners and a former general counsel for the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, which the circuit court entered into evidence.Â  The record also contained an â€œaffidavitâ€ from the three commissioners on the Full Commission.[2]Â  The commissioners stated that two of them had recorded their votes as of November 7, 2002, which constituted a majority reversal of the Single Commissioner.Â  Even though a notary signature block appeared at the bottom of the document, the document was not notarized.Â  Therefore, the circuit court found it did not comply with Rule 11(c), SCRCP and refused to give it any weight. \r\nIn March 2005, the circuit court issued a final order vacating the Full Commissionâ€™s order and reinstating the Single Commissionerâ€™s order.Â  The circuit court held that the only proper evidence before it was that the vote was not timely taken as Sonoco failed to prove that the Full Commission voted within the proscribed time period.Â  Because the Full Commission violated the regulation requiring it to vote within ten days of the hearing, the Full Commission did not have jurisdiction to issue the May 28, 2003 order.Â  The circuit court then affirmed the Single Commissionerâ€™s order awarding Johnson benefits, finding the Full Commission affirmed the Single Commissioner by default.Â  Sonoco appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe scope of judicial review of agency decisions is governed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005); Brown v. South Carolina Dept. of Health and Envtl. Control&nbsp; 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414&nbsp;(2002).Â  The appellate court will not generally substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are made upon unlawful procedure or affected by other error of law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(c) and (d) (2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSonoco argues the circuit court erred in accepting extrinsic evidence to assist it in determining whether the Full Commission violated a regulation requiring it to vote within ten days of the hearing.Â  Sonoco further argues the circuit court erred in concluding the Full Commission violated this regulation.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe first issue is whether the circuit court is entitled to consider extrinsic evidence in determining whether the Full Commission voted within ten days of the hearing.Â  The South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the workersâ€™ compensation\r\ncommission.Â  Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 456-57, 622 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Section 1-23-380(A)(5) of the APA provides that judicial review of an administrative proceeding should be â€œconducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record,â€ with the caveat that â€œ[i]n cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency, not shown in the record, proof thereon may be taken in the court.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A) (2005).Â  In Ross v. Medical University of South Carolina, 317 S.C. 377, 380, 453 S.E.2d 880, 882 (1994), the supreme court held that this section expressly authorizes the circuit court to accept proof of alleged irregularities in an agency proceeding, explaining â€œ[t]he language â€˜proof thereon may be taken in the courtâ€™ does not require the court itself to â€˜take proofâ€™ but, rather, to allow such proof to be entered at the circuit court level, at the courtâ€™s discretion.â€\r\nHere, the circuit court only considered extrinsic evidence relating to the issue of whether the Full Commission properly adhered to a procedural rule proscribed by its own regulations.Â  The circuit court did not consider any new evidence related to the factual basis of the underlying action.Â  Therefore, under section 1-23-380(A)(5), the circuit court properly exercised its discretion by considering extrinsic evidence pertaining to an alleged procedural irregularity in the Full Commissionâ€™s proceeding.Â Â  \r\nThe second issue is whether the circuit court properly handled the way in which it accepted this extrinsic evidence.Â  Sonoco argues the circuit court unfairly limited Sonocoâ€™s ability to develop and present its side of the case.Â  As discussed above, section 1-23-380(A)(5) allows the circuit court, in its discretion, to order discovery and admit extrinsic evidence in APA cases involving an alleged irregularity in the proceeding.Â  Id. at 381, 453 S.E.2d at 883.Â Â  The admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the circuit court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  Vaught v. A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons, Inc., 366 S.C. 475, 480, 623 S.E.2d 373, 375 (2005).Â  The circuit court allowed Sonoco to depose most of Johnsonâ€™s affiants.Â  The circuit court did not allow Sonoco to depose Johnsonâ€™s legal counsel for fear counsel would be disqualified.Â  Although the circuit court prevented Sonoco from deposing Johnsonâ€™s legal counsel and some members of the Full Commission staff, the circuit court nevertheless provided the parties additional time to submit affidavits, deposition testimony, and legal memoranda.[3]Â  In light of the opportunity the circuit court afforded both parties to develop the issue of whether a procedural irregularity occurred below, the circuit court did not err in the manner in which it oversaw the introduction of extrinsic evidence.Â Â Â  \r\nThe final issue is whether the circuit court erred in concluding the Full Commission violated a regulation requiring it to vote within ten days of the hearing.Â  â€œRegulations authorized by the legislature have the force of law.â€Â  Goodman v. City of Columbia, 318 S.C. 488, 490, 458 S.E.2d 531, 532 (1995).Â  An administrative agency can only exercise the powers which have been conferred upon it by the South Carolina General Assembly and must follow its own regulations and the provisions of the APA.Â  Triska v. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 292 S.C. 190, 194, 355 S.E.2d 531, 533 (1987).Â  â€œAny action taken outside of its statutory and regulatory power is null and void.â€Â  Id.Â  Section 42-3-30 of the South Carolina Code (1976) authorizes the commission to create regulations related to workersâ€™ compensation laws of this State.Â  It provides that the commission â€œshall promulgate all regulations relating to the administration of the workersâ€™ compensation laws of this State . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-3-30 (1976).Â  Regulation 67-709(C) provides: â€œThe Commissioners reviewing the case may confer and shall vote within ten days of the date of review.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-709(C) (1976) (emphasis added).Â  Regulation 67-709(F) provides: â€œIf a Commissioner fails to register a vote within the periods referred to above, the Commissioner is deemed to have registered a vote affirming the Hearing Commissioner and may not vote otherwise.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-709(F) (1976). Â Â \r\nThe Full Commission hearing occurred on October 30, 2002.Â  The next day, one of the three commissioners on the Full Commission wrote Johnsonâ€™s and Sonocoâ€™s counsel and informed them that the Full Commission needed more time to review the case.[4]Â  More than six months later, the Full Commission issued its order.Â  When Johnsonâ€™s attorney requested the Full Commissionâ€™s vote sheets, the vote sheets could not be found.Â  At the circuit court, Johnson and Sonoco introduced evidence related to the issue of whether the Full Commission voted within the ten day period mandated by Regulation 67-709(C).Â  The circuit court considered all admissible evidence and concluded the Full Commission did not vote within the ten day period required by Regulation 67-709(C).Â  \r\nThe circuit court considered the testimony of former commissioners Thomas Marchant and William Clyburn.Â  Both testified that during their tenures they voted after each hearing on a vote sheet and that the judicial director would make certain the vote sheets were turned in before the ten day period expired.Â  Pursuant to Rule 11(c), SCRCP, the circuit court properly excluded the â€œaffidavitâ€ from the three commissioners who comprised the Full Commission because the document was not notarized.Â  Rule 11(c), SCRCP (Affidavits or verifications authorized or permitted under these Rules shall be written statements or declarations by a party or his attorney of record or of a witness, sworn to or affirmed before an officer authorized to administer oaths, that the affiant knows the facts stated to be true of his own knowledge, except as to those matters stated on information and belief and as to those matters that he believes them to be true.).Â  Moreover, the admission or exclusion of evidence in general is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â Fields v. Regional Medical Center Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25-26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005).Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the circuit courtâ€™s exclusion of the affidavit.[5]Â  \r\nBecause there was no credible evidence showing the members of the Full Commission voted within the ten day time period, the circuit court did not err in finding the Full Commission violated Regulation 67-709(C).Â  Accordingly, pursuant to Regulation 67-709(F), the order of the Single Commission is reinstated and affirmed.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s order is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Johnson also appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order to the extent it does not address the findings of the Full Commission.Â  Because we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order, we do not address his cross-appeal.Â  Â \r\n[2] It appears that this â€œaffidavitâ€ was entered into the record by the Commission. \r\n[3]Â  There is no indication in the record Sonoco requested the circuit court entertain oral arguments, though section 1-23-380(A)(5) entitled it to do so. (â€œThe court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.â€). \r\n[4]Â  Sonoco also argues the circuit court erred in refusing to find Johnson waived his right to object to the extension of the ten day period or that Johnson is estopped from asserting the Full Commission erred in not registering its votes within the ten day period.Â  The Full Commission was bound by Regulation 67-709(C) and had no authority to deviate from its requirement that the Full Commission vote within ten days.Â  Triska, 292 S.C. at 194, 355 S.E.2d at 533.Â  (holding that an agency must follow its own regulations).Â  Therefore, neither the Full Commission nor the respective parties could waive it.Â  Johnson also cannot be estopped for taking the position the Full Commission erred in not registering its votes within the ten day rule because that position was untenable as a matter of law.\r\n[5]Â  Perplexingly, Sonoco did not seek to depose any of the three commissioners who comprised the Full Commission even though the circuit court allowed both parties to take additional depositions.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-282","title":"Burgess v.

Elliott, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nDavid L. Morrison and Andrew F. Lindemann, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Charles Burgess appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment in favor of the South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC).Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts in this case are undisputed.Â  Burgess was incarcerated under the supervision of SCDC from February 1985 until April 1998.Â  While Burgess was incarcerated, he pleaded guilty to perjury charges in federal court and received a sentence to be served under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).Â  As a result, the BOP lodged a retainer with SCDC requiring Burgess to be transferred to federal custody once he completed the state sentence.Â  \r\nIn 1981, the South Carolina General Assembly enacted legislation providing for a supervised furlough program for prisoners, excluding prisoners who had committed specified crimes.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-710 (Supp. 1981).Â  Subsequently, the General Assembly enacted section 24-13-720 mandating that a prisoner be released on supervised furlough six months prior to the expiration of his sentence, provided he was not serving a life sentence and had no disciplinary infractions within the last six months.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-720 (1989).Â  This section did not address whether inmates who were excluded from participation in the supervised furlough program under section 24-13-710 were also excluded from the mandatory program in section 24-13-720.Â  On June 14, 1993, the General Assembly amended section 24-23-720 to incorporate the eligibility requires of section 24-13-710 and make the program permissive rather then mandatory.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-710 (Supp. 1993).Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nIn Plyler v. Evatt, the South Carolina Supreme Court construed the meaning of section 24-13-720.Â  313 S.C. 405, 438 S.E.2d 244 (1993).Â  The court held that the amendment constituted a change in the law and that individuals who met the requirements before the 1993 amendment was enacted were entitled to participate in the program, but that individuals who were not eligible for release prior to June 14, 1993 could participate in the program only if qualified under the amended statute.Â  Id. at 407 n.1, 438 S.E.2d 245 n.1.Â  The court reasoned that the amended statute could be applied to an inmate who was sentenced before its effective date because the program was not a part of his sentence.Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn October 16, 1997, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit interpreted section 24-13-720 in a habeas corpus action. Plyler v. Moore, 129 F.3d 728 (4th Cir. 1997).Â  The Fourth Circuit ruled that the 1993 amendment could not be applied to inmates convicted prior to 1993 because the amendment had the effect of increasing the length of their incarceration and such a retroactive application of the law violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.Â  Id. at 735.Â  The Fourth Circuit then effected a stay until the State of South Carolina could petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.Â  The Supreme Court denied the petition on June 22, 1998, and the stay was lifted.Â  Moore v. Cummings, 524 U.S. 945 (1998) denying cert. to Plyler v. Moore, 129 F.3d 728 (4th Cir. 1997).Â  \r\nMeanwhile, Burgess was serving his state sentence.Â  Burgess asserts he was interviewed for the supervised furlough program in October, 1997 and was told he would be released to his federal retainer at that time.Â  Burgess did not participate in the furlough program, but was detained pending the outcome of South Carolinaâ€™s petition for certiorari. Â Burgess completed his state sentence and was released to federal authorities in April 1998.[2]Â  \r\nAfter the Supreme Court denied certiorari in 1998, Burgess, who was in the midst of serving his federal sentence, claims the BOP informed him it would credit his federal sentence with six months if the SCDC would verify he would have been eligible for the furlough program but for the stay issued in the Plyler decision. Â In 1999, Burgess contacted SCDC and requested a letter attesting he was eligible for the furlough program.Â  SCDC wrote a letter to the BOP, stating Burgess was â€œeligibleâ€ for the furlough program, but â€œnot approvedâ€ for participation.Â  Burgess contends this letter was inadequate to convince the BOP to credit his sentence. Â Â Â \r\nBurgess was placed on supervised release by the federal authorities in June 1999.Â  Burgess violated the terms of his release, and the district court imposed a sentence, beginning June 7, 2001 and ending March 4, 2003.Â  On May 16, 2002, while he was serving his second federal sentence, Burgess again contacted SCDC and requested a letter stating he would have been released under the supervised furlough program.Â  When SCDC failed to send the letter he requested, Burgess filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, alleging SCDC violated his rights under 42 U.S.C.A Â§ 1983.Â  The district court dismissed the suit, finding Burgess alleged only a state claim and did not state facts sufficient to trigger a section 1983 claim.Â  \r\nBurgess then filed suit under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act alleging SCDC was negligent in failing to confirm his eligibility for the furlough program to the BOP, which caused him to serve an additional six months in the federal penitentiary.Â  SCDC filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment in SCDCâ€™s favor, finding, among other things, Burgessâ€™s negligence action was barred by the two year statute of limitations.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.â€Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 494, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). â€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74 (1999).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€ Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBurgess argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of SCDC.Â  We disagree.[3]Â  \r\nBurgess brought his negligence claim under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-10 to 220 (2005). The Tort Claims Act is a limited waiver of governmental immunity, and sets forth a two-year statute of limitations in which negligence actions may be brought against the state.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (2005)Â  (â€œExcept as provided for in Section 15&#8209;3&#8209;40, any action brought pursuant to this chapter is forever barred unless an action is commenced within two years after the date the loss was or should have been discovered;Â  provided, that if the claimant first filed a claim pursuant to this chapter then the action for damages based upon the same occurrence is forever barred unless the action is commenced within three years of the date the loss was or should have been discovered.â€) \r\nUnder the discovery rule, the statutory limitations period begins to run from the date when the injury resulting from the wrongful conduct either is discovered or may be discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence.Â  Cline v. J.E. Faulkner Homes, Inc., 359 S.C. 367, 370-71, 597 S.E.2d 27, 28 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The statute of limitations, therefore, runs from the date the injury is discoverable by the exercise of reasonable diligence. Graniteville Co. v. IH Servs., 316 S.C. 146, 148, 447 S.E.2d 226, 228 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  An injured party must act promptly when the facts and circumstances of the injury\r\nwould place a reasonable person on notice that a claim against another party might exist.Â  Republic Contracting Corp. v. South Carolina Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 332 S.C. 197, 207, 503 S.E.2d 761,766 (Ct. App. 1998). That an injured party may not comprehend the extent of the injuries is immaterial.Â  Id. at 207, 503 S.E.2d at 767.\r\nBurgess attempts to avoid the application of the statute of limitations by asserting that he has two distinct claims against SCDC for failing to write an adequate letter to the BOP.Â  He contends his first cause of action accrued when he made the initial request in 1999, and SCDC failed to send a letter adequate to convince the BOP to credit his sentence.Â  Burgess concedes the statute of limitations bars his claim in regard to the 1999 request.Â  However, Burgess argues that his second request in June 2001, made when he was re-incarcerated after his federal supervised furlough was revoked, gave rise to a new claim.Â  \r\nThe trial court ruled the second refusal of the same request that SCDC write a letter to the BOP, constituted one cause of action for negligence and did not â€œbegin the running of the statute of limitations anew.â€Â  We agree with the trial courtâ€™s reasoning.Â  Burgessâ€™s complaint alleges one cause of action for negligence based on SCDCâ€™s failure to write a letter to the BOP in order that his federal sentence could be credited by six months.Â  Therefore, the statute of limitations began to run when Burgess first requested such a letter. The statute of limitations clock did not restart each time Burgess made an additional request and SCDC failed to write the requested letter.Â  Because SCDC first failed to a write the letter in 1999 adequate to convince the BOP to credit Burgessâ€™s sentence, and Burgess did not serve his action on SCDC until January 2004, the two year statute of limitations bars his claim.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â It is unclear from the record whether Burgess was detained pending the outcome of South Carolinaâ€™s petition for certiorari or because of the detainer which required him to be transferred to BOP custody to be begin serving his federal sentence; however, Burgess asserts SCDC informed him he would be released to his federal retainer when he was interviewed in October 1997.\r\n[3] Â Because we affirm on this issue, we decline to address Burgessâ€™s remaining arguments.Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR; see also Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 341, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when the resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-283","title":"Kneedler v.

McDow, for Appellant.\r\nRobert M. P. Masella, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Shawn R. Griffin (Husband) appeals a family court order adopting and modifying a Florida divorce order.Â  We affirm with modification.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Alexis Kneedler (Wife) married in May 1996 and divorced February 14, 2000, in Pinellas, Florida.Â  One child, Shiann Rose Liegh Griffin (Child), was born of the marriage on May 29, 1997.Â  \r\nThe Florida divorce order granted the parties joint custody, with Wifeâ€™s home designated as Childâ€™s primary residence.Â  After the divorce, Husband moved to Massachusetts.Â  Wife and Child subsequently relocated to York County, South Carolina.Â  In October 2002, Wife filed the present complaint, seeking to domesticate the Florida order, recalculate Husbandâ€™s child support payments and obtain arrearages, gain sole custody of Child, alter Husbandâ€™s visitation schedule, require Husband to post a security for future child support, and attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nPrior to a hearing on Wifeâ€™s complaint, the parties settled several issues by way of consent order, which resolved some issues temporarily and others permanently.Â  The parties agreed to domesticate the Florida order, give Wife sole custody of Child, and finalize Husbandâ€™s child support obligation and payment schedule for his arrearages.Â  As to Husbandâ€™s visitation schedule, the consent order reads as follows:\r\n\r\n[Husband] shall have temporary visitation to include 9:00 a.m. December 26 through six p.m. January 2 each year; Easter vacation or spring break each year from the end of school until 6:00 p.m. the day before school resumes, four weeks during the summer of 2003 and six weeks every summer thereafter provided there are no major difficulties during the summer of 2003, and such other times as the parties may agree, including weekends when [Father] may be [in] the York County area.Â  This provision is intended to be permanent as well as temporary. (emphasis added)\r\n\r\nA hearing on the partiesâ€™ remaining issues was held in February 2004.Â  Husband did not appear, but his counsel was present.Â  The family courtâ€™s final order required Husband to obtain a $56,703 life insurance policy to secure future child support payments.Â  The family court also awarded Wife $1,095 in attorneyâ€™s fees accrued since the consent orderâ€™s entry.Â  Husbandâ€™s summer visitation with Child was stated in the order simply as â€œfour weeks during the summer.â€Â  This appeal followed the denial of Husbandâ€™s motion to reconsider.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We remain mindful that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Husbandâ€™s Visitation\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in modifying his summer visitation schedule from six to four weeks because the issue was not properly before the family court to determine.Â  We agree and modify the terms of Husbandâ€™s summer visitation to those agreed upon in the partiesâ€™ consent order.\r\nAs stated in Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 543 S.E.2d 224 (Ct. App. 2001):\r\n\r\nIt is well settled that ordinarily a party may not receive relief not contemplated in his pleadings.Â  While it is true that pleadings in the family court must be liberally construed, this rule cannot be stretched so as to permit the judge to award relief not contemplated by the pleadings.Â  Due process requires that a litigant be placed on notice of the issues which the court is to consider.\r\n\r\nId. at 152, 543 S.E.2d at 227 (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nAlthough the issue of Husbandâ€™s visitation was discussed in Wifeâ€™s initial pleadings, the 2003 consent order between the parties specifically states that its resolution of the visitation issue is permanent.Â  As stated above, Husbandâ€™s summer visitation was agreed upon to be six weeks, contingent only upon â€œmajor difficultiesâ€ arising during Childâ€™s 2003 summer visit.Â  \r\nAt the outset of the hearing on Wifeâ€™s remaining issues, the following colloquy took place between the family court judge and both partiesâ€™ counsel:\r\n\r\nWifeâ€™s Counsel:Â  The temporary [consent order] dealt with some matters on a permanent basis, your honor and I donâ€™t know if you would just like to know what they are because there are some issues are really not â€“ \r\nThe Court:Â  Well, tell me â€“\r\nWifeâ€™s Counsel:Â  There are some issues in the complaint that are not really before you, your honor.\r\nThe Court:Â  Well, tell me what issues are to be tried today.\r\nWifeâ€™s Counsel:Â  Okay, your honor, [Wifeâ€™s Counsel gives lengthy discussion on Childâ€™s transportation to and from visitation, child support and arrearages, the life insurance policy, and attorneyâ€™s fees] . . .\r\nThe Court:Â  Do you agree, [Husbandâ€™s Counsel]?\r\nHusbandâ€™s Counsel:Â  Let me make sure I understand.Â  I understand that to be transportation, child support, insurance arrearage, life insurance, and attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nWifeâ€™s Counsel:Â  Correct.\r\n\r\nDuring the hearing, Childâ€™s 2003 summer visitation was addressed only once and referenced only in regard to Wifeâ€™s counselâ€™s fee affidavit.Â  When questioned by the court about Childâ€™s visitation schedule, Wifeâ€™s counsel replied:\r\n\r\nYour honor, it says it is December 26th through January 2nd of each year, spring break, and four weeks during the summer and six weeks if there were no major difficulties, but I think there was, and that may be conceded, reflected in my affidavit, and other terms that they can agree on when he is in the area the child lives.\r\n\r\nWifeâ€™s counselâ€™s fee affidavit vaguely references an incident during which Child was injured while playing with Husbandâ€™s girlfriend and her child.Â  At no other time during the hearing was the Childâ€™s 2003 summer visit with Husband mentioned.\r\nWe conclude the above allegations insufficient to properly bring the visitation issue before the family court.Â  Accordingly, the family court erred in altering Husbandâ€™s visitation when such relief was not requested and the issue was permanently resolved by a prior consent order.Â  As agreed by the parties in the consent order, we modify the family court order to read as follows:\r\nHOLIDAY AND SUMMER VISITATION\r\n\r\nThe minor child has three scheduled visits with Father each year: Christmas from December 26th through 6:00 p.m. January 2nd; Easter vacation or spring break each year from the end of school until 6:00 p.m. the day before school resumes; and four weeks during the summer of 2003 and six weeks every summer thereafter provided there are no major difficulties during the summer of 2003. [remaining section of family court order affirmed]\r\n\r\nII. Life Insurance Policy\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in requiring him to maintain a declining balance term life insurance policy to secure the payment of child support.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe family court is within its legal authority to require a supporting spouse to maintain a life insurance policy naming the child as beneficiary to insure the continued support of the minor child.â€Â  Ivey v. Ivey, 286 S.C. 315, 318, 334 S.E.2d 123, 125 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  The decision to require the maintenance of a life insurance policy for the benefit of a minor child must be justified by compelling reasons, such as failure to pay child support in the past.Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, Husband conceded he has a history of failing to make child support payments.Â  Furthermore, Husbandâ€™s sole income consists of monthly unemployment benefits, making the potential for future payment failures a reasonable concern.Â  Because Husband demonstrated a past reluctance to comply with child support orders and an unstable financial history, the family court did not err in requiring Husband to maintain a life insurance policy for the benefit of Child.\r\nIII. Attorneyâ€™s Fees \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in awarding Wife $1,095 in attorneyâ€™s fees accrued since entry of the partiesâ€™ consent order.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  As did the family court, we have reviewed the applicable factors set forth in Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991), and E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812 (1992).Â  See Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 341, 536 S.E.2d 427, 436 (Ct. App. 2000) (outlining the applicable factors in determining whether to grant attorneyâ€™s fees and the proper fee amount).Â  Under the facts and circumstances of this case, particularly the charitable payment schedule granted Husband to repay Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees, we find no abuse of discretion in the award.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the family courtâ€™s order is AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED in section one of this opinion.\r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-284","title":"Spane v.

Smalls, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\nDonald L. Van Riper, J. Marvin Mullis, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondents.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Rentway, Inc. and Employerâ€™s Insurance of Wassau (Rentway) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the decision of the appellate panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (appellate panel) awarding benefits to Michael J. Spane.Â  Rentway argues that the appellate panel erred in ruling that Spaneâ€™s present medical condition was the sole responsibility of Rentway and that Spaneâ€™s new accident did not arise out of or during the course of his employment with Rentway.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 15, 1999, Spane suffered a work-related injury to his back lifting a television while employed by Rentway, Inc.Â  Over the following months, the back injury worsened, and as of December 1999 Spane had been diagnosed with a back injury as a result of the lifting accident.Â  Rentway admitted Spane injured his back in the lifting incident.Â  Shortly after the injury, Spane left his employment with Rentway and worked for other employers, including A.T. Services, John A. Defede Law Firm, Verizon Wireless, and Americaâ€™s Best Security. \r\nAmericaâ€™s Best hired Spane to do light duty security work. Â Spane disclosed his pre-existing, continuing back condition, and as a result, Americaâ€™s Best assigned him to work in a low traffic area.Â  However, in August of 2000, Spane suffered an injury to his groin when he jumped a small ditch in an attempt to avoid gunfire at a club where he provided security for Americaâ€™s Best.Â  While receiving treatment for the groin injury at Lexington Medical Center, Spane also complained of lower back pain.Â  Spane testified the back pain he complained of was not a new injury but rather was the continuing pain from the Rentway injury.Â  Spane further testified the continuing back pain was not a result of the new groin injury, explaining that the back pain continued in the same manner even after the groin injury had fully healed.Â  \r\nIn May of 2001, Spane underwent surgery for the continuing back pain. Â During surgery, a disk ruptured and a nerve was damaged in his right foot.Â  After the operation, Spaneâ€™s back condition did not improve and continued treatment was required. \r\nSpane filed a form 50 seeking temporary benefits and further medical care as a result of his back injury suffered while employed by Rentway.Â  Rentway did not deny the back injury but argued that the back injury was aggravated by the subsequent groin injury sustained while Spane was employed by Americaâ€™s Best. Â Rentway argued Americaâ€™s Best should be responsible for some portion of the benefits due to Spane.Â  Americaâ€™s Best denied any responsibility for Spaneâ€™s back injury.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing, the commissioner found the following: (1) that the claimant sustained injury from an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with Rentway, (2) that the plaintiff was a covered employee at the time of the accident, (3) that the plaintiff was entitled to temporary total benefits for his leg and back conditions, and (4) that Rentway was responsible for the continuing causally related medical care of the claimant.Â  The commissioner found Americaâ€™s Best was responsible only for the costs associated with the emergency room visit for Spaneâ€™s groin injury.Â  \r\nThe appellate panel and the circuit court affirmed the decision of the commissioner.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRentway argues the appellate panel erred in finding it was solely responsible for Spaneâ€™s back injury.Â  Specifically, Rentway argues the evidence suggests Spane suffered a new back injury while employed with Americaâ€™s Best.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act applies to appeals from decisions of the appellate panel.&nbsp; Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).&nbsp; In an appeal from the appellate panel, neither this court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the appellate panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact but may reverse when the decision is affected by an error of law.&nbsp; Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; â€œAny review of the [appellate panelâ€™s] factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€&nbsp; Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001).&nbsp; Accordingly, we limit review to deciding whether the appellate panelâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.&nbsp; Corbin, 351 S.C. at 617, 571 S.E.2d at 95.&nbsp; \r\nâ€œSubstantial evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the [appellate panel] reached.â€&nbsp; Lockridge, 344 S.C. at 515, 544 S.E.2d at 844.&nbsp; â€œThe â€˜possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€™â€&nbsp; Lee v. Harborside Cafe, 350 S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984)).\r\nSubstantial evidence supports the appellate panelâ€™s decision that Spaneâ€™s back condition was caused solely by the admitted accident at Rentway.Â  The medical evidence in the record supports the appellate panelâ€™s finding that the back injury was caused by the 1999 lifting injury, not the August 2000 groin pull.Â  During his medical evaluations from 1999 to 2001, Spane has consistently complained of constant low back pain that radiates down his right leg and foot.Â  Even the medical records from eight months after the 2000 groin pull only reference the 1999 back injury.Â  The medical records do not indicate that the back injury causally resulted from or were aggravated by the ditch-leaping event.Â  In 2001, Dr. Ross D. Lynch specifically notes that the injury stemmed from the 1999 lifting injury and that the condition had progressively gotten worse.Â  In January of 2000, before the groin injury, Dr. Scott B. Boyd wrote, â€œMr. Spane returns today for evaluationâ€¦ again he says he is miserable with pain.Â  He is unable to work, and he feels like he is getting worse.Â  Again he describes his pain as radiating from his back down into his hip and leg.â€Â  Approximately eighteen months after the groin injury, the medical records indicate that Spane still suffered from the same pain Dr. Boyd recorded before the groin injury.Â  Moreover, Spane testified the continuing back pain was not a result of the new groin injury, explaining that the back pain continued in the same manner even after the groin injury had fully healed.Â  While it might be possible to reach a different conclusion, substantial evidence exists to support the findings of the appellate panel.Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ. concur.Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-285","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia, Robert M. Ariail, 13th Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Brian William Scott appeals the circuit courtâ€™s denial of his motion for a new trial, arguing the State violated his due process rights by failing to comply with Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and the mandates of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn February 1997, a jury found Brian Williams Scott guilty of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment.Â  At his trial, the State relied heavily on the testimony of James Johnson and Tyrone Adams, both present at the alleged murder of Tyrone\r\nLongino.\r\nAccording to James Johnsonâ€™s trial testimony, he met Scott while working at a local restaurant a couple of weeks prior to the incident in question.Â  Johnson testified he left work around 10:30 p.m. on the night of February 14, 1992.Â  While walking to a friendâ€™s house, Johnson ran into Scott, Adams, Longino, and another coworker.Â  He was introduced to Adams and Longino for the first time.Â  The group then went to an apartment shared by Scott and Logino and proceeded to consume alcohol and smoke marijuana.Â  At some point, Johnsonâ€™s other coworker left.Â  The remaining four then spent some time driving around in Longinoâ€™s car and making phone calls in an attempt to purchase drugs.\r\nFollowing several failed attempts to secure a drug purchase, the group pulled into a gas station.Â  Adams exited the vehicle and walked to a nearby phone to page a potential seller.Â  Johnson testified that an argument then ensued between Scott and Longino over the roommateâ€™s apparent lack of enthusiasm for the drug purchase.Â  According to Johnson, Scott became increasingly aggravated at Longino and eventually began strangling him with an unknown object from his position in the seat directly behind Longino.Â  Once Longino was rendered unconscious, Scott ordered Adams and Johnson to help him move the victim into the front passenger seat.Â  He instructed Adams to drive as he and Johnson returned to the back seat.Â  Johnson testified that shortly thereafter Scott suddenly pulled out a large kitchen knife and, reaching around from the back seat, stabbed Longino in the chest.\r\nAccording to Johnson, Scott then directed Adams to drive to a nearby park, where Scott and Adams placed Longinoâ€™s body in a dumpster. Afterward, Scott returned to his apartment.Â  Adams and Johnson drove Longinoâ€™s car to Adamsâ€™ apartment and smoked crack until Johnson reported to work the following morning.Â  \r\nOn February 15, Greenville police received a call reporting a parked car at a local apartment complex that appeared to have a bloodstained interior.Â  Officers located the vehicle and checked the suspected driverâ€™s apartment.Â  In the apartment, officers found Adams, who claimed he borrowed the car from Longino and explained the blood stains as the result of an unfortunate nosebleed.Â  Adams admitted to partially cleaning out the car and revealed the location of his bloodstained clothing.Â  He was arrested for an outstanding warrant and the car was impounded.Â  Police verified that the car belonged to\r\nLongino.\r\nThe police then attempted to locate Longino at his apartment to verify Adamsâ€™ nosebleed claim.Â  At Longinoâ€™s apartment, officers encountered Scott for the first time.Â  Scott had a large knife stuck in the back of his belt, which was taken by the police.Â  He claimed he hadnâ€™t seen Longino in days, but acted nervous around the investigating officers. Â After Scott refused to consent to a search of his apartment, the officers returned the knife and left the residence.\r\nAt approximately 11:30 p.m. that night, the Greenville City Police received a call from county authorities reporting that a body was found in a dumpster at a local park.Â  The body was identified as Longino.Â  Injuries to the body confirmed he was strangled and stabbed once in the chest.\r\nOfficers then interrogated Adams a second time regarding the events of February 14.Â  At this point, Adams submitted a written statement claiming Scott strangled and stabbed Longino and the group then helped him hide the body in the park dumpster.Â  Pursuant to Adamsâ€™ revised statement, an arrest warrants was issued for Scott.Â  Through an anonymous tip, Scott was located hiding under a bed at his girlfriendâ€™s apartment, the large knife still in his possession.Â  After his arrest, Scott refused to answer questions concerning the death of his roommate.Â  On February 18, Johnson turned himself in to police after seeing a story about the murder on the local news.Â  Johnson then submitted a written statement consistent with Adamsâ€™ recollection of Longinoâ€™s death.\r\nScott, Adams, and Johnson were indicted for Longinoâ€™s murder.Â  In 1992, the charges against Scott were dismissed, presumably due to an issue concerning the location of witnesses.Â  In 1996, however, Scott was re-indicted for murder and tried before a jury.Â  Scottâ€™s trial took place prior to any prosecution of Adams or Johnson regarding Longinoâ€™s death.\r\nAs previously stated, the State relied heavily on Adamsâ€™ and Johnsonâ€™s testimony concerning the events in question.Â  Adamsâ€™ trial testimony regarding Longinoâ€™s murder was consistent with that of Johnson, reviewed above.Â  Particularly germane to this appeal, Adams testified he returned to the car from the gas station pay phone to find Scott strangling Longino with what appeared to be a piece of rope.Â  Adams also testified he witnessed Scott stab Longino from the rear seat.Â  The jury found Scott guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  Adams eventually pled guilty to obstruction of justice and received a seven year sentence with credit for time served.\r\nIn 2000, Scott retained counsel and initiated a post conviction relief action (PCR).Â  Scottâ€™s PCR counsel filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the 13th Circuit Solicitorâ€™s Office seeking all information in any way related to the death of Longino.Â  After an extended, often heated, exchange of phone calls and letters between Scottâ€™s counsel and the solicitorâ€™s office, the requested documents were eventually turned over.Â  \r\nIncluded in these documents was a certified written statement signed by Adams entitled â€œNotice of Intended Pleaâ€ and dated May 20, 1994.Â  In this document, Adams avers the following:\r\n\r\n3. Defendant [Adams] was, consistent with prior statement(s), talking on the telephone in the area of the crime having no knowledge of the act until he entered the vehicle in which he was a passenger, finding the body of the victim.\r\n4. Relative to the actual perpetrator of the crime, Defendant could only speculate as to whom the actual perpetrator was as he (Defendant) did not witness the act.\r\n. . . . \r\n6. Defendant freely admits that he drove the car belonging to the victim, that he was merely present during the commission of the crime, with that presence being out of sight of the crime and without the knowledge of the act being in progress.\r\n\r\nThe signed â€œverification/certification of serviceâ€ block to this document reads â€œI have placed the original and one copy of this document in the U.S. Mail at the Lee Correctional Institution at Bishopville, SC, addressed to the; CLERK OF COURT, GREENVILLE COUNTY COURT HOUSE, GREENVILLE, SC: OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR, GREENVILLE COUNTY, GREENVILLE, SC.â€ (emphasis in original)\r\nThis document was not provided to Scott pursuant to his Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and Brady motions prior to his murder trial.Â  According to Scottâ€™s former PCR counsel, the document was present in the Greenville County Clerk of Courtâ€™s Office in Adamsâ€™ file numbered 98-GS-23-2330, which is the enumeration for Adamsâ€™ obstruction of justice case.Â  Although the document also relates to Adamsâ€™ murder charge and is numbered accordingly (92-GS-23-7889), Scottâ€™s former PCR counsel stated in writing that the document was not present in Adamsâ€™ murder charge case file when she searched it in January 2000.\r\nScott filed a Rule 29(b), SCRCrimP, motion for a new trial in the circuit court, arguing that the Stateâ€™s withholding of this document violated his due process rights by failing to comply with Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and the mandates of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).Â  The circuit court denied the motion, concluding the document, filed with clerk of court, was a matter of public record; thus, available to a diligent defendant and not within the scope of a Brady motion.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nScott argues the circuit court erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the Stateâ€™s failure to provide Adamsâ€™ sworn statement to the defense violated his due process rights by failing to comply with Rule 5, SCRCrimP, and the mandates of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).[1]Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is a violation of a defendantâ€™s due process rights for the prosecution to withhold evidence favorable to the defendant.Â  Brady, 373 U.S. at 87.Â  The prosecutionâ€™s obligation to turn over evidence favorable to the defense applies to both exculpatory and impeachment evidence.Â  Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515, 524, 514 S.E.2d 320, 324 (1999). However, in Anderson v. Leeke, 271 S.C. 435, 438, 248 S.E.2d 120, 122 (1978), our supreme court held that the Brady rule â€œapplies only to favorable evidence which the prosecution has but which is unavailable to the defendant.â€Â  Accordingly, matters of public record available to a diligent defendant do not fall within the scope of a Brady motion.Â  Id.; see also State v. Allen, 276 S.C. 412, 414, 279 S.E.2d 365, 366 (1981); State v. Penland, 275 S.C. 537, 540, 273 S.E.2d 765, 766-67 (1981);Â  State v. Cox; 274 S.C. 624, 629, 266 S.E.2d 784, 787 (1980).\r\nIn the present case, Adamsâ€™ statement was filed with both the prosecution and the Greenville County Clerk of Court prior to Scottâ€™s trial.Â  Court filings are a matter of public record; thus, were available to Scott and his counsel through due diligence.Â  Accordingly, the document does not fall within the Brady rule.\r\nFurthermore, a Brady claim is valid only if the accused can demonstrate the evidence was material to guilt or punishment.Â  Gibson, 334 S.C. at 525, 514 S.E.2d at 324.Â  When a defendant files a general Brady request, as Scott did in the present case, â€œfavorable evidence is material, and constitutional error results from its suppression by the government, [only] if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.â€Â  Id. at 525, 514 S.E.2d at 325 (quoting Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 432-36 (1995)).Â  â€œA reasonable probability of a different result is . . . shown when the Governmentâ€™s evidentiary suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of trial.â€ Id.  \r\nHere, the evidence in question merely attacks the credibility of a witness whose varying versions of the events surrounding the victimâ€™s murder were made apparent to the jury at trial.Â  Moreover, Adamsâ€™ statement contradicting his trial testimony does nothing to refute the testimony of the Stateâ€™s star witness, Johnson, who was seated next to Scott during both the strangling and stabbing of Longino.Â  We conclude, after thorough review of the record on appeal, that had Adamsâ€™ contradictory written statement been presented at trial, Scottâ€™s jury would have reached an identical result.Â  While we are troubled by the prosecutionâ€™s failure to disclose Adamsâ€™ statement, we do not feel it undermines confidence in the outcome of Scottâ€™s trial in light of Johnsonâ€™s testimony.Â  See Porter v. State, __ S.C. __, 629 S.E.2d 353, 357 (2006) (holding impeachment evidence was not material to guilt or punishment when the failure to disclose did not undermine confidence in the outcome of defendantâ€™s trial).Â  \r\nIn reaching this conclusion, we are aware of the recent South Carolina Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion in Riddle v. Ozmint, __ S.C. __, __ S.E.2d __, 2006 WL 1389541 (2006), reemphasizing the consequential nature of the Stateâ€™s Brady obligation and the grave impact on justice when the prosecution fails to comply.Â  However, given the facts of the present case, namely Johnsonâ€™s consistent testimony and the thorough impeachment of Adams at Scottâ€™s trial, we find Scottâ€™s appeal comports much more soundly with factual scenario in Porter.\r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s denial of Scottâ€™s motion for a new trial is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Scott also argues that these documents prove Adams was offered leniency in exchange for his testimony in Scottâ€™s trial, an assertion which further belies Adamsâ€™ trial testimony.Â  Although the documents do reference attempts by the prosecution to illicit a guilty plea from Adams, they do not reflect that Adams was offered leniency for his testimony against Scott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-286","title":"SCDSS v.

Â After a merits hearing on October 22, 2002, the family court made a finding of threat of harm of physical abuse and a threat of physical neglect by Mother as to all of the children.Â  The family court also adopted and incorporated the treatment plan DSS formulated for Mother, which required her to submit to random hair strand drug tests, discontinue her use of illegal drugs and alcohol, and secure and maintain appropriate housing.Â  \r\nOn October 13, 2004, DSS initiated the current termination of parental rights action, alleging sections 20-15-1572(1), (2), (6), and (8) as grounds for termination.Â  A hearing was held on March 31, 2005. The parties stipulated to the fact the children had been in DSS custody for the past fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months. Â DSS presented evidence that Mother had a long history of drug abuse dating back to the mid 1990â€™s and had participated in inpatient and outpatient drug treatment programs, but had relapsed each time.Â  DSS proffered drug screen results showing Mother tested positive for cocaine eleven times since the children entered foster care and had tested positive as recently as October 2004.Â  Additionally, all of the DSS case workers and the guardian ad litem testified TPR was in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  \r\nMother presented evidence that she made great strides educationally and vocationally while the children were in foster care.Â  Mother successfully completed a program at Greenville Technical College and was working at Greenville Memorial Hospital as a unit secretary.Â  Mother was taking additional classes at Greenville Technical College so that she could be certified as a medical assistant and receive a significant pay raise.Â  She also had a part-time job cleaning the vice president and professorsâ€™ offices at Greenville Technical College, and she was entrusted with a key to the building.Â  In regard to housing, Mother lived in a one bedroom apartment and made arrangements to move into a larger one if she regained custody of her children.Â  She also visited with the children and paid child support on a regular basis.Â  \r\nMother admitted to using illegal drugs in the past but asserted that she had been drug free since July 21, 2003. Â Mother argued the drug tests were unreliable because the results of her drug screens were inconsistent.Â  Jenkins, the only witness who testified for DSS regarding the test results administered under DSS supervision, stated that the test result patterns were odd and sometimes conflicted with one another.Â  Additionally, Motherâ€™s case manager at Share Homeless Services[2], Melinda Seigler, testified Mother was required to undergo regular urine drug screens as a prerequisite for participating in the program.Â  Seigler stated Mother underwent testing at least once every other week and had not tested positive since she entered the program in February 2004.Â  Steigler also noted after Mother tested positive for cocaine in a DSS administered test in July 2004, Share required Mother to undergo a hair strand drug test at its expense, and she tested negative.Â  \r\nSharon Wilson also testified on Motherâ€™s behalf.Â  Wilson met Mother through her work with an outreach ministry organization, and had become very close to her.Â  Wilson testified that she does not believe Mother is currently using drugs or alcohol, that Mother attends church on a regular basis, and that she believed Mother would do what she â€œwas supposed to doâ€ if the children were returned to her.Â  She also stated that Mother joined the ministry and was working with abused women.Â  \r\nAlthough the family court commended Motherâ€™s progress, it found that clear and convincing evidence existed to terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights on all four grounds.Â  Mother made a motion to alter or amend the judgment, and the family court denied the motion.Â  This appeal follows. Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a termination of parental rights case, the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration. Â South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000). Grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Â Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999).Â  Furthermore, this Court may make its own conclusions of whether DSS proved by clear and convincing evidence that parental rights should be terminated. Â South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 626, 614 S.E.2d 642, 645 (2005).\r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grounds for Termination of Parental Rights \r\nMother argues the trial court erred in granting TPR because DSS failed to prove the statutory grounds.Â  Mother asserts the family court terminated her parental rights based on DSSâ€™s allegation that she continued to use drugs, which DSS failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence.Â  We agree. \r\nThe termination of parental rights is governed by section 20-7-1572 of the South Carolina Code Annotated (Supp. 2005).Â  Pursuant to that section, parental rights may be terminated upon a showing of one or more enumerated grounds and a finding the termination is in the best interests of the child.Â  Here, the family court found the following statutory grounds applied to Mother and her children:\r\n\r\n(1) The child or another child in the home has been harmed as defined in Section 20&#8209;7&#8209;490, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.Â  In determining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the parentâ€™s previous abuse or neglect of the child or another child in the home may be considered; \r\n(2) The child has been removed from the parent pursuant to Section 20&#8209;7&#8209;610 or Section 20&#8209;7&#8209;736, has been out of the home for a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan by court order or by agreement between the department and the parent, and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal; \r\n(6) The parent has a diagnosable condition unlikely to change within a reasonable time including, but not limited to, alcohol or drug addiction, mental deficiency, mental illness, or extreme physical incapacity, and the condition makes the parent unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of the child. It is presumed that the parentâ€™s condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time upon proof that the parent has been required by the department or the family court to participate in a treatment program for alcohol or drug addiction, and the parent has failed two or more times to complete the program successfully or has refused at two or more separate meetings with the department to participate in a treatment program; \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005).\r\nOther than the evidence DSS presented to show Mother continues to use illegal drugs, the record shows Mother did everything possible to better herself and her living conditions to regain custody of her children.Â  Mother acquired adequate and stable living conditions for the children, secured two jobs in order to support the children, and completed a treatment program for drug addiction.Â  Therefore, it appears the family court relied on Motherâ€™s alleged drug use to terminate her parental rights.Â  Our review of the record indicates the conflicting and unexplainable results of the drug tests were insufficient to establish Mother was using drugs.Â  DSSâ€™s own witness, Jenkins, the representative from the drug screening facility that performed the tests, could not explain the results and was â€œbaffledâ€ by the inconsistency in the drug screens.Â  Moreover, independent tests conducted through the Share program showed Mother tested negative for drugs.Â  Absent clear and convincing evidence Mother was using drugs, the state failed to carry its burden in proving the grounds for TPR under Â§ 20-7-1572(1)(2) and (6).Â  \r\nUnder section 20-7-1572(1), DSS is required to prove the children were harmed as defined in Section 20&#8209;7&#8209;490, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.Â  Additionally, section 20-7-1572(2) requires DSS to show that Mother failed to remedy the conditions which caused the childrenâ€™s removal.Â  The cause for the childrenâ€™s removal from Motherâ€™s custody was that she was abusing drugs and had physically neglected the children.Â  As discussed above, DSS did not prove Mother was still using drugs, and Mother had acquired adequate housing prior to the trial.Â  Mother made arrangements to move into a larger apartment if the children were returned to her. Mother also had plans to buy a house through Shareâ€™s home buying program, and Steigler, Shareâ€™s representative, testified that Mother would begin the home buying process within the next month. Â Mother improved her education and was working two jobs where she enjoyed positions of trust. Therefore, we find DSS failed to prove it was not reasonably likely Motherâ€™s home could be made safe within twelve months or that Mother did not remedy the conditions which caused removal. Â Â Â \r\nFurthermore, although it is undisputed Mother has a diagnosable condition under section 20-7-1572(6), DSS did not prove the condition makes the Mother unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care of the children or that Motherâ€™s condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. The suspect nature of the drug test results coupled with Motherâ€™s completion of a drug treatment program and obvious advancement in obtaining education, employment and housing indicates Mother has the ability and inclination to provide acceptable care for the children.\r\nMother next argues the trial court erred in terminating her parental rights on the ground that the children had been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2005).Â  Mother argues termination on this ground absent a showing she was at fault for DSSâ€™s refusal to return the children violates her due process rights.Â  Mother raised this issue for the first time in a Rule 59(e) motion; therefore, we find this issue is not preserved for our review. See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding a party may not use a post-trial motion to raise an issue that could have been raised at trial). At trial, Mother stipulated that the children had been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months; therefore, we affirm the family courtâ€™s finding that this ground for termination exists.Â  This ground alone, coupled with a finding termination is in the childâ€™s best interests is sufficient to grant TPR.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Sims, 359 S.C. 601, 608, 598 S.E.2d 303, 307 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, we decline to terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights because we do not find termination is in the childrenâ€™s best interests.\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best Interests \r\nMother argues TPR is not in the childrensâ€™ best interests.Â  We agree.[3]  \r\nAfter finding one of the grounds for termination exists, section 20-7-1572 requires a determination that the termination is in the best interests of the child.Â  (â€œThe family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child. . .â€). Â Our supreme court has recognized â€œthe termination of parental rights to be one of most severe actions a state can take against its citizens.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 626, 614 S.E.2d 642, 645 (2005).Â  In cases involving the termination of parental rights, the court must balance two often competing interests, those of the parent and those of the child.Â  Id.Â  â€œIn balancing these interests, the best interest of the child is paramount to that of the parent.â€Â  Id. at 626-27, 614 S.E.2d at 645.\r\nThe fundamental purpose of terminating parental rights is to provide the greatest possible protection for a child whose parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for the physical and emotional needs of the child and to protect the health and welfare of these children and make them eligible for adoption by persons who will provide a suitable home environment and the love and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and productive life.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1560 (Supp. 2005); Cochran, 364 S.C. at 632, 614 S.E.2d at 648.Â  \r\nWe are cognizant that a child has a â€œfundamental interest in terminating parental rights if the parent-child relationship inhibits establishing secure, stable, and continuous relationships found in a home with proper parental care.â€Â  Cochran, 364 S.C. at 626, 614 S.E.2d at 645.Â  However, our review of the record does not indicate that the parent-child relationship in the instant case inhibits establishing a proper home for the children.Â  Â Â \r\nThe record indicates the caseworkersâ€™ testimony that TPR is in the childrenâ€™s best interests was based on Motherâ€™s positive drug screens and her previous problems with drugs.Â  Teresa Jeter, a caseworker who worked directly with Mother, testified that DSS was going to return the children to Mother at one point, but decided against reunification after Mother tested positive for cocaine.Â  Another caseworker, Chrisite Chalmers, testified TPR was in the childrenâ€™s best interest because there was no â€œ100 percent proofâ€ Mother would not relapse again.Â  \r\nThe guardian ad litem, who also testified that TPR was in the childrenâ€™s best interests, testified she derived her recommendation only from the drug screens and Motherâ€™s single statement that the children did not need counseling.Â  In her report, the guardian asserted that Mother â€œseems to genuinely want to regain custody of her children and has shown exemplary improvement in changing her life around and becoming self sufficient with the exception of the positive drug screens.â€Â  The caseworkersâ€™ and the guardian ad litemâ€™s recommendation that TPR is in the childrenâ€™s best interest was based on Motherâ€™s positive drug screens and her previous problems with drugs. Therefore, we weigh the caseworkersâ€™ and guardianâ€™s recommendation in accordance with our finding the drug evidence in this case was unreliable.Â  \r\nInstead, we give deference to the testimony, by DSS caseworkers, the guardian, and Motherâ€™s witness demonstrating reunification is in the childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  The caseworkersâ€™ and the guardian testified Mother visits with the children at every opportunity and pays child support.Â  Additionally, a DSS caseworker testified that Mother had to intervene to help the foster parent when one of Motherâ€™s special needs children had severe behavioral episodes, and Motherâ€™s intervention had positive results.Â  This testimony indicates TPR would not be in the childâ€™s best interest.Â  Moreover, Mother made laudable efforts in turning her life around so that she could provide a secure and stable home for the children.Â  Seigler, who worked with Mother as part of the Share program and who had seen Mother once a week for over a year, testified that Mother is â€œvery much ready, willing, and able to take her children back and is eager to have them back in the home with her.â€Â  (R.81)Â  Seigler also opined that Mother has never given any indication that she is on the verge of relapsing.Â  Additionally, Wilson, who met Mother through an outreach program, stated that she did not believe Mother was using drugs, and she thought Mother would be a â€œgood Momâ€ if the children were returned to her.Â  \r\nBased on these facts, we find terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights would not be in the childrenâ€™s best interests because the fundamental purpose of the TPR statue is not met.Â  There is no need to free the children for adoption and force them to wait in foster care for a suitable adoptive placement, considering they are bonded with their natural mother who is willing and able to provide adequate care for their physical and emotional needs and is capable of providing a suitable home environment.Â  We reverse the family courtâ€™s decision to grant TPR and remand the case so that the family court can formulate a permanent plan for reunification.Â  Accordingly, the order of the family court is\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Share Homeless Services is an independent program that assists individuals in acquiring housing and by providing supportive services.Â  Share helped Mother acquire her education, job, and housing.Â  \r\n[3] Â Because we reverse on this issue, we decline to address Motherâ€™s remaining arguments.Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR; see also Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 341, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when the resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-287","title":"Geiger v.

Stewart Funderburk of Orangeburg Surgical Associates, P.A.Â  Thereafter, Geiger commenced this action against Dr. Funderburk and Orangeburg Surgical, alleging Dr. Funderburk, as an agent or employee of Orangeburg Surgical, committed medical malpractice during the procedure to remove her gallbladder. \r\nGeiger filed her complaint with the clerk of court and enlisted Sylvander Blue, a private investigator and process server, to serve her summons and complaint on Dr. Funderburk and Orangeburg Surgical. Blue visited the address Orangeburg Surgical had filed with the Secretary of State as its registered office, and spoke with a secretary regarding service of the papers.Â  Blue informed the secretary that he needed to see Dr. Funderburk and Dr. Randolph Smoak.Â  Dr. Smoak was the individual listed on file with the Secretary of State as the registered agent for the corporation.Â  Dr. Smoak had ceased his employment with Orangeburg Surgical sometime prior to May of 2000, but his name remained on file as registered agent for the corporation.[1]Â  When the secretary informed Blue that neither of these men was present, Blue asked to speak with the office manager. \r\nBlue was led to the office of Elizabeth Arant, who described herself as the â€œpractice manager.â€Â  Blue informed Arant that he had papers for Dr. Smoak and Dr. Funderburk to sign and that the matter was urgent.Â  Arant signed for Dr. Funderburk as the â€œbusiness office manager,â€ but she refused to sign for Dr. Smoak, as registered agent for Orangeburg Surgical, because he was â€œnot employed by the practice.â€Â  Moreover, Dr. Babb, president of Orangeburg Surgical, was present during the time Arant spoke with Blue regarding service and specifically instructed her not to sign anything for Dr. Smoak.Â  Arant also stated that Dr. Babb refused to sign anything himself.Â  \r\nThereafter, Dr. Funderburk and Orangeburg Surgical filed answers to Geigerâ€™s complaint, and they moved jointly to dismiss or in the alternative to quash service of process, alleging service of process on them was not effected according to applicable statutes and rules.Â  On March 31, 2003, the circuit court found service of process on Dr. Funderburk to be effective, but found service of process on Dr. Smoak in his capacity as the registered agent for Orangeburg Surgical to be ineffective.Â  Consequently, the circuit court denied the motion as it pertained to Dr. Funderburk but granted the motion as it pertained to Orangeburg Surgical and dismissed the corporation from the suit.Â  No Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion was filed with the circuit court.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe circuit court determines questions of fact arising on a motion to quash service\r\nof process for lack of jurisdiction over the defendant.Â  Brown v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 583, 560 S.E.2d 624, 631 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Lawson v. Jeter, 243 S.C. 103, 106, 132 S.E.2d 276, 277 (1963)).Â  â€œThe findings of the circuit court on such issues are binding on the appellate court unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or manifestly influenced or controlled by error of law.â€Â  Moore v. Simpson, 322 S.C. 518, 524, 473 S.E.2d 64, 67 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Service of Process\r\nInitially, Orangeburg Surgical asserts the circuit court never undertook an analysis of whether Arant was a managing agent capable of receiving process on behalf of the corporation, and therefore, this issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  We disagree. \r\nIssues and arguments are preserved for appellate review only when they are raised to and ruled on by the circuit court.Â  Elam v. South Carolina Dept. of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772, 779-80 (2004); see also Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  No Rule 59(e) motion is required when a circuit court explicitly ruled on an argument raised.Â  Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991).Â  \r\nAt the March 31, 2003 hearing, Geiger raised the issue of whether service of process on Arant as a â€œmanaging agentâ€ was effective as service on Orangeburg Surgical.Â  Geiger stated: \r\n\r\nI think the stronger argument, to be quite honest, is that we effected service over the corporation, and I think that itâ€™s a stronger argument for two reasons: number one, [Orangeburg Surgical] did not meet their responsibility to have a registered agent in that place of business for purposes of receiving this; and number two, the rule simply states that it needs to be a managing or general agent that has to be served with the process.Â  And so, the question does become whether or not Ms. Arant filled that role as managing or general agent on that day.â€ \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the court, Geiger, and Orangeburg Surgical engaged in a lengthy colloquy pertaining to the case law relevant to Geigerâ€™s argument that Arant was the managing agent pursuant to Rule 4(d)(3).Â  Both Geiger and Orangeburg Surgical cited cases to the circuit court to support their respective arguments, and the court questioned the parties on this issue.Â  It is clear, therefore, that the issue of whether Arant was a managing agent under Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP, was raised to the circuit court.\r\nIn the order, the circuit court explicitly cites Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP, in its entirety.Â  Moreover, the court addressed the service issue as to Dr. Funderburk and Orangeburg Surgical separately.Â  In the section applicable to Orangeburg Surgical, the court made, as a finding of fact, the following conclusion:\r\n\r\nIn the present case, no officer, managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by the corporation or by law to receive service of process was served with the summons and complaint.Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the court, in rejecting Geigerâ€™s argument that service on Orangeburg Surgical was perfected when Arant accepted papers on behalf of Dr. Funderburk, found â€œthis argument to be contrary to Rule 4(d)(3)â€ and again quoted that rule in its entirety.Â  While the courtâ€™s ruling does not specifically find that Arant was not a managing agent under Rule 4(d)(3), the order is sufficiently explicit in its findings of facts and law to constitute a ruling on the managing agent issue as raised by Geiger.[2]Â  Therefore, we find this issue preserved for our review.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nTurning to the merits, Geiger contends the circuit court erred in finding service was not properly effected on Orangeburg Surgical.Â  Geiger argues the service of process on a managing agent of the corporation was accomplished when Arant accepted and signed for the summons and complaint on behalf of Dr. Funderburk.Â  We agree.\r\nÂ â€œThe principal object of service of process is to give notice to the defendant corporation of the proceedings against it.â€Â  Burris Chem., Inc. v. Daniel Constr. Co., 251 S.C. 483, 487, 163 S.E.2d 618, 620 (1968).Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court does not require â€œexact complianceâ€ with the rules effecting service of process, but rather inquires whether the plaintiff has sufficiently complied with the rules such that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant and the defendant has notice of the proceedings.[3]Â  Roche v. Young Bros., Inc. of Florence, 318 S.C. 207, 209-10, 456 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1995).Â  \r\nRule 4(d)(3), SCRCP, delineates the requirements for effecting service of process upon a corporation as follows:\r\n\r\nUpon a corporation . . . Â by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process and if the agent is one authorized by statute to receive service and the statute so requires, by also mailing a copy to the defendant.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe trial court found that service of Arant was not effective service of Orangeburg Surgical because â€œDr. Smoak was the authorized agent listed at the Secretary of Stateâ€™s Office, not Elizabeth Arant.â€Â  Use of this rationale to decide the effectiveness of service of process would constitute an error of law because service on a corporationâ€™s registered agent is not the only means by which service can be properly effected on the corporation.Â  See Renney v. Dobbs House, Inc., 275 S.C. 562, 565, 274 S.E.2d 290, 291 (1981) (holding that service of process upon an agent other than the registered agent is a proper method of service upon a corporation under South Carolina law).Â  Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP, permits service of process on â€œa managing or general agentâ€ of the corporation.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œNo case has been found in South Carolina defining â€˜managing agentâ€™ under Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP.â€Â  Schenk v. Natâ€™l Health Care, Inc., 322 S.C. 316, 320, 471 S.E.2d 736, 738 (Ct. App. 1996), cert. denied (Dec. 5, 1996).Â  In Schenk, this court found an office manager to be a â€œmanaging agentâ€ under Rule 4(d)(3), and found that service on her in lieu of the retired and hence unavailable registered agent was effective.Â  Id.Â  Whether a particular agent is a managing agent of a corporation must depend upon the peculiar facts involved in each case.Â  71 A.L.R.2d 178 (2006).\r\nAlthough Arant did not assure the process server that she was authorized to accept service as did the office manager in Schenk, she did accept service for Dr. Funderburk and signed for the summons and complaint as the â€œbusiness office manager.â€Â  Moreover, her duties with Orangeburg Surgical are sufficient for her to qualify as the managing agent of the corporation.Â  Arant managed and supervised the employees of the corporation except for the partners, was involved in the hiring and firing processes, wrote the employee handbook, was a member of several professional management groups, was a certified legal assistant, and stated that she would respond if someone requested to meet with the â€œoffice manager.â€Â  For these reasons, we find Arant to be a â€œmanaging agentâ€ as contemplated by Rule 4(d)(3). Service on Arant was effective service upon Orangeburg Surgical.Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED. [4]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] From the date that Dr. Smoak left the practice to the date of service in this matter, which was almost two years, Orangeburg Surgical failed to comply with section 33-5-101 of the South Carolina Code (2006) which requires that a corporation continuously maintain a registered agent â€œwhose business office is identical with the registered office.â€ \r\n[2] Orangeburg Surgical argues Geiger conceded this issue was not preserved in her appellate brief.Â  In Geigerâ€™s brief, she admits the circuit court never determined â€œwhether a â€˜business office managerâ€™ is an officer, a managing or general agent, or another type of agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.â€Â  However, we are not bound by a partyâ€™s characterization of an issue when the record reflects differently.Â  See Rim Associates v. Blackwell, 359 S.C. 170, 177-78, 597 S.E.2d 152, 156 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œ[A]n appellate court is not bound by a partyâ€™s characterization of the actions.â€); Klippel v. Mid-Carolina Oil, Inc., 303 S.C. 127, 129, 399 S.E.2d 163, 164 (Ct. App. 1990); see also Ariail v. Ariail, 295 S.C. 486, 491, 369 S.E.2d 146, 149 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n[3] Importantly, it is evident that both Dr. Funderburk and Orangeburg Surgical had notice of the proceedings against them as evidenced by their timely filing of separate answers. \r\n[4] Because we reverse on this issue, we decline to address Geigerâ€™s remaining arguments.Â  See Whiteside v.

Barnes, pro se, of Columbia; for Appellant.\r\nWalter B. Todd, Jr., of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Richie D. Barnes appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in an action to foreclose his property for unpaid assessments.Â  We affirm. [1] Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nWaterford Place Homeownerâ€™s Association of Lexington, Inc. (Waterford) is a corporation that manages and maintains the planned unit development of Waterford Place.Â Â  Richie D. Barnes is the owner of a residential unit in Waterford Place.Â  Pursuant to the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions of Waterford Place, each owner agrees to pay Waterford assessments to be determined by the association.Â Â Â  Failure to pay the assessment may result in interest accruing or a foreclosure action.Â  \r\nWaterford brought this action to foreclose on its lien for unpaid assessments by Barnes.Â  Â Waterford claims Barnes failed to pay assessments representing Barnesâ€™ share of common expenses.Â  According to his own testimony, Barnes stopped paying the monthly assessments on June 3, 2002, and now owes $5,700.00 in unpaid assessments.Â  Barnes counterclaimed alleging breach of express warranty, negligence and fraud.Â  In essence, Barnes claimed he should not have to pay the assessments because Waterford was not maintaining the common areas, specifically those places around his property.Â  \r\nAfter serving interrogatories on Barnes and finding his answers unsatisfactory, Waterford filed a motion to compel and a motion for summary judgment.Â  The trial court sympathized with Barnes, but found that he was nonetheless liable for the assessments.Â  The trial court granted Waterfordâ€™s motion for summary judgment as to Barnesâ€™ liability for foreclosure for unpaid assessments, granted Waterfordâ€™s motion for summary judgment without prejudice as to Barnesâ€™ counterclaims, and referred the matter to the master-in-equity for further proceedings as to the foreclosure.Â  The trial court went on to say that the appropriate action for Barnes would be to file an action seeking specific performance.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBarnes contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in an action to foreclose his property due to unpaid assessments.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, appellate courts apply the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP, which states that summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Willis v. Wu, 362 S.C. 146, 150-51, 607 S.E.2d 63, 65 (2004); see also, Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 S.C. 310, 316-17, 592 S.E.2d 326, 330 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating all ambiguities,\r\nconclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate when further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law. Â Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2005); Montgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 529, 542, 608 S.E.2d 440, 447 (Ct. App. 2004). Â Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them,\r\nsummary judgment should be denied. Â Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 5, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct. App. 2004). Â However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ,\r\nsummary judgment should be granted.Â Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 821 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nIt is undisputed the Covenants of Waterford Place provide that each owner by acceptance of the deed agrees to pay the assessments and a failure to do so may result in a foreclosure.Â  Barnes readily admits he failed to pay the assessments since June 3, 2002.Â  The trial court was correct in concluding that regardless of Waterfordâ€™s failure to make repairs as required by the Covenants, Barnesâ€™ duty to pay remains.Â  His admitted failure to pay the assessments triggered the foreclosure provision of the Covenants.Â  As for Barnesâ€™ counterclaims, he does not make an argument in his brief concerning these issues.Â Â  We therefore, find it unnecessary to reach the merit of his counterclaims.Â  Â Â \r\nBarnes also argues that by granting summary judgment, the trial court violated his â€œconstitutional right to have trial by jury.â€Â  Barnes cites Rule 38(a), SCRCP, as the basis for his argument.Â  Though Rule 38(a) does provide for a trial by jury in certain cases, Rule 56, SCRCP, provides for summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  In essence, Rule 56 allows for an efficient disposition of a case when there is no need for it to go to a jury.Â  Barnesâ€™ right to a jury trial was not violated by the granting of summary judgment.Â  To hold otherwise would mean that whenever a jury demand is made, summary judgment is no longer an option.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-290","title":"Taylor v.

Couch , Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-290\r\nHeard May 31, 2006 â€“ Filed June 22, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        William Stevens Brown, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        James C. Cothran, Jr., Robert M. Holland, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this breach of contract case, Bank of America Corporation (the Bank) appeals the trial courtâ€™s order, arguing the trial court erred in failing to hold the statute of limitations barred Derrickâ€™s claim and in shifting the burden of proof to the Bank.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 11, 1990, Taylor deposited $15,000.00 with the Citizens and Southern National Bank of South Carolina (C&amp;S) through a certificate of deposit (the CD).Â  Every thirty days, the CD matures and automatically renews.Â  The CD contains several disclosures, one of which provides that the owner â€œwill want to keep [his or her] CD in a safe place, since receiving a replacement will require [the owner] to give [C&amp;S] satisfactory proof of loss and/or security.â€Â  \r\nIn 1994, Derrick, Taylorâ€™s daughter, became Taylorâ€™s attorney-in-fact, in response to Taylorâ€™s erratic actions after the death of her husband.Â  In 1995, Taylor moved to a nursing facility.Â  By 1997, Derrick handled almost all of Taylorâ€™s financial transactions, including her federal income tax returns.Â  \r\nIn the meantime, C&amp;S, through a series of mergers, became Bank of America.Â  In 2001, Derrick discovered the CD.Â  Derrick presented the CD to the Bank for redemption, and the Bank refused to pay, asserting it had no information on the account.Â  On February 18, 2002, Derrick filed a complaint alleging the Bank breached its contract with Taylor by refusing to pay pursuant to the terms of the CD.Â  The Bank answered, denying the allegations in the complaint, arguing the statute of limitations barred Derrickâ€™s cause of action, and asserting several other affirmative defenses.Â  \r\nThe trial court held a non-jury trial on August 24, 2004. Â Loubell Graham, the Bankâ€™s employee, testified that a microfiche printout produced from the Bankâ€™s corporate offices indicated the CD was â€œclosed outâ€ on December 7, 1990.[1]Â  She also testified that it was the Bankâ€™s practice to send monthly statements and annual tax documents to CD holders. Â Derrick testified she had not received any statements or tax documents regarding this CD.Â  Additionally, Graham explained that a customer could redeem a CD by presenting an affidavit stating the customer lost the CD and by posting a bond to protect the Bank against fraudulent redemptions.Â  The Bank could not produce an affidavit from Taylor showing the CD was redeemed, and Graham noted federal law only required the Bank to hold records, including such affidavits, for ten years after the CD closed.[2]Â  \r\nThe trial court held Derrick proved a debt, the Bank failed to prove payment of the debt, the statute of limitations did not bar Derrickâ€™s cause of action, and the Bank failed to establish any affirmative defenses.Â  The Bank made a motion to reconsider, which the trial court denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA breach of contract action seeking damages is an action at law.Â  Conway v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 363 S.C. 301, 305, 609 S.E.2d 838, 841 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œWhen reviewing an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the appellate courtâ€™s jurisdiction is limited to correction of errors at law.â€ Â Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home v. Beasley,&nbsp;365 S.C. 157, 164, 616 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Statute of Limitations\r\nThe Bank contends the trial court erred in failing to apply the statute of limitations to bar Derrickâ€™s cause of action.Â  We disagree.\r\nA plaintiff must bring a breach of contract action within three years of the breach.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(1) (Supp. 2005); see Maher v. Tietex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 376, 500 S.E.2d 204, 207 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œAn action for breach of contract must be brought within three years from the date the action accrues.â€).Â  The discovery rule determines the date of accrual for a breach of contract action. Santee Portland Cement Co. v. Daniel Intâ€™l Corp., 299 S.C. 269, 273, 384 S.E.2d 693, 695 (1989), overruled on other grounds by Atlas Food Sys. and Servs., Inc. v. Crane Natâ€™l Vendors Div., 319 S.C. 556, 462 S.E.2d 858 (1995).Â  â€œPursuant to the discovery rule, a breach of contract action accrues not on the date of the breach, but rather on the date the aggrieved party either discovered the breach, or could or should have discovered the breach through the exercise of reasonable diligence.â€ Â Maher, 331 S.C. at 376, 500 S.E.2d at 207.\r\nBank argues the contract was breached, if at all, when it â€œclosed outâ€ the account on December 7, 1990.Â  A bank employee testified Bankâ€™s current normal practice is to send bank statements and tax forms depicting interest earned for open accounts.Â  Bank maintains Taylor and Derrick had notice of the breach because they would not have received statements or tax forms after the Bank closed the account; therefore, they should have discovered the breach through the exercise of reasonable diligence.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the microfiche records the Bank presented to show it â€œclosed outâ€ the account on December 7, 1990, did not show that any specific action was taken on that date, but merely indicated that no activity was recorded on the account after that date.Â  The trial court noted that the CD renewed automatically, and the only other evidence demonstrated that Derrick had the original CD in her possession.Â  Therefore, the trial court found the breach occurred when Derrick attempted to redeem the CD in September 2001 and the Bank refused to make payment.Â  Because Derrick filed the suit five months later, the trial court found the statute of limitations did not bar the claim.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAccording to our standard of review, the trial judgeâ€™s findings of fact are equivalent to a juryâ€™s finding in a law action, and the appellate court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact unless the findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  King v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 317 S.C. 385, 388-89, 453 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1995); Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co., 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The appellate court will not disturb the trial judgeâ€™s findings of fact that depend on the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 542 (1981); see also Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc., 343 S.C. 587, 594, 541 S.E.2d 257, 261 (2001) (â€œIt is not for the appellate court to weight the evidence.â€).Â  \r\nOur review of the record indicates there is evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s findings.Â  Graham, the Bankâ€™s representative, testified regarding the microfiche records.Â  Graham stated she had no direct knowledge regarding the entry made on the microfiche, and that she was interpreting the microfiche codes using a key.Â  The microfiche record showed that the account history ended on December 7, 1990, and Graham opined the account was â€œclosed outâ€ on that date; however, the evidence did not conclusively show what action the Bank took on that date.Â  Additionally, even if the Bank closed the account in 1990, there was no evidence that Taylor or Derrick received notice.Â  Although Graham testified that the Bank routinely sends out statements and tax forms for CDs, there is no evidence in the case at bar that any such documents were ever provided to Taylor or Derrick.Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s finding that the statute of limitations clock for Derrickâ€™s claim began to run in September 2001 when she received notice of the Bankâ€™s breach of the contract.Â  Derrick filed the instant action in February 2002; therefore, the three year statute does not bar the claim.Â  \r\nII. Burden of Proof\r\n The Bank argues the trial court erred in shifting the burden of proving payment of the CD to the Bank.Â  We disagree.\r\nPayment is an affirmative defense that must be pled by the party asserting it.Â  Rule 8(c), SCRCP; First Serv. Corp. of S.C. v. Cape, 299 S.C. 147, 150, 382 S.E.2d 919, 921 (1989).Â  When a defendant asserts an affirmative defense, he becomes the actor in the suit as to that matter; therefore, he has the burden of proving it by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  Cole v. S.C. Electric and Gas, 355 S.C. 183, 195, 584 S.E.2d 405, 412 (Ct. App. 2003) (citation omitted).Â Â  Â \r\nIt is clear from our review of the record that Bank was essentially asserting the affirmative defense of payment by arguing the CD was redeemed in 1990.Â  Although the trial court did not expressly mention the affirmative defense of payment in its order, the trial court implicitly applies the doctrine in reaching its decision.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nIn a breach of contract action the plaintiff must prove: (1) a binding contract entered into by the parties, (2) a breach or failure to perform the contract, and (3) damage suffered by the plaintiff as a direct and proximate result of the beach.Â  Fuller v. Eastern Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.,&nbsp;240 S.C. 75, 85, 124 S.E.2d 602, 610 (1962).Â  The trial court found Derrick made out a prima facie case for breach of contract.Â  Derrick had a valid contract as evidenced by the CD, which she had in her possession, the bank refused to perform its duty to pay when she presented the CD for redemption, and she lost over $15,000 as a result.Â  Once Derrick met the burden of proving each element of breach of contract, Bank had the burden of proving the affirmative defense that it paid the debt, and the Bankâ€™s only witness, Graham, testified that she had no information Derrick or Taylor ever received the funds from the CD. Â Therefore, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling requiring the Bank to prove payment as an affirmative defense.Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the trial court properly found the statute of limitations did not bar Derrickâ€™s cause of action.Â  Additionally, we hold the trial court correctly applied the burden of proof with respect to payment of the CD.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Graham interpreted the microfiche using a list of codes the trial court would not admit into evidence.Â  \r\n[2]Â  The Bank noted in its brief that Federal Regulations only require it to maintain records of closed CD accounts for five years.Â  See 31 CFR Â§ 103.38(d). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-291","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Ruby Rice d/b/a/ R&amp;R Bail Bonding (Rice) contends the circuit court erred in ordering a partial estreatment of Cynthia Smithâ€™s bond.Â  We affirm.[1] Â Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 2001, Cynthia Smith was arrested for and charged with multiple counts of forgery.Â  Smith was released on a surety bond in the amount of $15,000 posted by Rice.Â  \r\nOn January 24, 2002, Rice was notified to have Smith appear in court on February 4, 2002; Smith failed to appear.Â  A bench warrant was issued for the arrest of Smith for her failure to appear in court.Â Â Â  \r\nOn February 19, 2003, a bond estreatment hearing was held.Â  Rice argued the bond should not be forfeited because Smithâ€™s disposition on the forgery charges was dismissed.Â  After a recess, the State informed the court the cases were still outstanding, and the disposition stating the cases were dismissed was based on an error by the clerkâ€™s office.Â  The circuit court ordered forfeiture for $10,000 of the $15,000 bond.Â  \r\nRice filed a Motion to Reconsider the Estreatment of Bonds on March 4, 2003, arguing the circuit court should reconsider its opinion because the charges against Smith were dismissed.Â  The circuit court denied Riceâ€™s motion.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRice contends the circuit court erred in failing to consider the costs to the state in its determination of whether bond forfeiture should be remitted.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review. \r\n â€œIn order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.â€ State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003).Â  â€œIf the losing party has raised an issue in the lower court, but the court fails to rule upon it, the party must file a motion to alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue for appellate review.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v.

Jamieson, of Rock Hill, Â for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Ricky and Tammy Polson (the Polsons) appeal the grant of custody of their two grandchildren to William Johnson.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nJohnson married the Polsonsâ€™ daughter, Wendy, on October 31, 2001.Â  On November 7, 2001, Wendy gave birth to Hannah. \r\nThe Polsons believed Hannahâ€™s biological father was Chad Edwards.Â  They advised Wendy to name Edwards as the father on Hannahâ€™s birth certificate; however, a health department employee informed the family the birth certificate had to name Johnson as the father because he and Wendy were legally married at the time of Hannahâ€™s birth.Â  Â Â \r\nWendy and Hannah lived with the Polsons for several months after Hannah was born.Â  Apparently, this living arrangement came about so the Polsons could help with child care while both Wendy and Johnson were working.Â  During this time, Wendy would go home with Johnson on her days off and, at times, Johnson, with the Polsonsâ€™ consent, would stay at their home to be with Wendy.Â  In February 2002, Wendy and Hannah moved back to their home with Johnson.\r\nOn July 13, 2002, police were called to Johnsonâ€™s house and charged him with criminal domestic violence for striking Wendy.Â  After the incident, Wendy and Hannah went to live with the Polsons.Â  While they were staying with the Polsons, Johnson persuaded Wendy to drop the charges against him.Â  Wendy and Hannah returned to live with Johnson on December 29, 2002.\r\nWendy gave birth to a second child, Sarah, on August 17, 2003.[2]Â  Hannah and Sarah lived with Johnson and Wendy until November 7, 2003, when, after Hannahâ€™s second birthday party, Wendy and Johnson again became entangled in another altercation.Â  As a result of the incident, Wendy was charged with criminal domestic violence and taken to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.Â  While Wendy was away from the family for her evaluation, Johnson sent Sarah to live with his sister in Pennsylvania and sent Hannah to live with the Polsons. \r\nApproximately two weeks later, Wendy was released from the hospital and took Hannah from the Polsonsâ€™ home to live with her and Johnson.Â  Upon her return, Johnson informed Wendy that he was going to Pennsylvania to retrieve Sarah from his sister.Â  Wendy did not want Johnson to leave, and this dispute resulted in another physical incident between them. Â About a week after this incident, after Johnson informed the Polsons that Wendy was â€œacting up,â€ the Polsons brought Hannah to their home.Â  Shortly after Hannah went to live with the Polsons, Wendy also moved in with them.Â  \r\nSarah remained in Pennsylvania with Johnsonâ€™s sister while the Polsons commenced separate actions seeking custody of Hannah and Sarah.Â  By order dated January 9, 2004, the family court consolidated the actions under a single docket number and granted the Polsons temporary custody of both Hannah and Sarah. \r\nThe final hearing took place July 19, 2004.Â  On August 25, 2004, the family court issued an order in which it found Johnson to be the father of both children.Â  Based on the investigation by the guardian ad litem, the court also found Johnson was a fit parent.Â  Noting Wendyâ€™s testimony that she was not capable of caring for the children and the absence of any showing that Johnson was an unfit parent, the court concluded the Polsons lacked standing to claim custody and it was in the best interests of Hannah and Sarah that they be placed in Johnsonâ€™s custody. \r\nThe Polsons submitted post-trial motions under Rules 59(e) and 60 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  On December 6, 2004, the family court heard argument on the motions.Â  By order dated January 4, 2005, the family court made a finding that Johnson â€œis not the biological father of Hannah Lee Johnsonâ€ and granted Wendy, who was incarcerated at the time of the final hearing, visitation with the children â€œwhenever allowed by the jail and someone can take them there to see herâ€; however, the other provisions of the prior decision were left intact.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts according to its own view of the preponderance of the evidence,[3] but â€œthis broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.â€[4]Â  We need not, however, decide whether the evidence supports the family courtâ€™s findings of fact when these findings â€œare so tainted by\r\nerrors of law as to require us to reverse the courtâ€™s decision and remand the case for a new hearing.â€[5]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  We agree with the Polsons that the family court erred in its application of the presumption of legitimacy to hold Johnson is Hannahâ€™s father because he and Tammy were married at the time of her birth. \r\nâ€œThe presumption of legitimacy, although rebuttable, is one of the strongest known to the law.â€[6]Â  A child born in lawful wedlock is presumed to be legitimate; however, clear evidence that it was impossible for the husband to have been the father of the child can rebut this presumption.[7]\r\nWe agree with the Polsons that they presented clear evidence to rebut the presumption that Johnson is Hannahâ€™s father.Â  Ricky Polson testified at trial that Wendy was in a relationship with Chad Edwards at the time she became pregnant with Hannah and did not begin a relationship with Johnson until a later time.Â  Although Edwards never took a paternity test and died before the final hearing, the Polsons and Edwardsâ€™s mother testified to their belief that Edwards was Hannahâ€™s biological father.Â  Edwards was at the hospital when Hannah was born, and, even after his death, his family continued to acknowledge Hannah, visit her, and give her gifts.Â  Wendy herself told Tammy Polson Edwards was Hannahâ€™s father.Â  No one, including Johnson himself, offered any testimony to challenge these assertions. Â Moreover, the Polsons presented an e-mail Johnson had sent to them shortly after Hannahâ€™s birth in which he seemed to admit he was not Hannahâ€™s biological father and asserted he would never â€œfight forâ€ Hannah if he and Wendy ever separated as long as he did not have to pay child support for Hannah. \r\n2.Â  Based on the foregoing, we hold the family court, in determining who should have custody of Hannah, incorrectly required the Polsons to prove Johnson was an unfit parent.[8]Â  In determining who should be granted custody of Hannah, the family court should have based its determination on whether it was in Hannahâ€™s best interest to live with the Polsons or with Johnson rather than whether Johnson was a fit parent.[9]Â  In other words, the family court should have used a â€œbest interest of the childâ€ standard as between two third parties and not as between a parent and a third party.\r\n3.Â  We also agree with the Polsons that, in determining who should receive custody of Sarah, the family court failed to apply the test the supreme court adopted in Moore v. Moore.[10]\r\nIn Moore, the supreme court acknowledged â€œa rebuttable presumption that it is in the best interest of any child to be in the custody of its biological parent.â€[11] Notwithstanding this presumption, however, the court recognized that â€œ[t]he best interest of the child is the primary and controlling consideration of the Court in all child custody controversies.â€[12]  \r\nIn balancing these two principles, the court stated that, at least with respect to parents who relinquish custody of their children to third parties and seek to regain custody at a later time, â€œ[t]he rebuttable presumption standard requires a case by case analysis.â€[13]Â  In addition, the court set forth the following criteria to be considered in custody determinations when a parent seek to reclaim custody from a third party:Â  (1) the parentâ€™s fitness and ability to care for the child and provide a good home; (2) the amount of contact, in the form of visits, financial support, or both, that the parent had with the child while the child was in the third partyâ€™s care; (3) the circumstances under which the parent relinquished custody; and (4) the degree of attachment between the child and the third-party custodian.[14]\r\nThe appealed order addresses only the first criterion, but fails to make findings of fact concerning the remaining three factors.Â  Given the compelling arguments by both sides as to the salient facts in the application of a Moore v. Moore analysis to this case and our consensus that the strengths of these arguments depend largely on credibility determinations, we decline to make our own findings regarding who should have custody of Sarah.Â  Accordingly, we reverse family courtâ€™s decision to grant custody of Sarah to Johnson and remand this issue to the family court.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the family courtâ€™s finding regarding Hannahâ€™s paternity and hold there was clear evidence to rebut the presumption that Johnson is her father.Â  Because this holding impacts the determination of who should receive custody of Hannah, we reverse the grant of custody of Hannah to Johnson and remand this issue to the family court.Â  On remand, the family court shall apply a â€œbest interest of the childâ€ standard in determining whether to grant custody of Hannah to Johnson or to the Polsons.Â  We also reverse the family courtâ€™s decision to award Johnson custody of Sarah and remand this issue for a Moore v. Moore analysis.\r\nAs a result of our reversal of the family courtâ€™s decisions regarding custody of Hannah and Sarah, temporary custody of both children will resume with the Polsons pursuant to the temporary order of January 9, 2004, and continue while the remand is pending.Â  \r\nThe Polsons raise several other issues for this court to consider on appeal, including newly discovered evidence concerning Johnsonâ€™s fitness as a parent and their request for visitation in the event that custody continues with Johnson.Â  Because of our disposition of the case, we do not address these issues.Â  On remand, however, the family court may consider any new evidence properly before it, including testimony concerning developments since the final merits hearing and the advisability of separating the children from each other.[15]\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] A paternity test has confirmed Johnson is Sarahâ€™s biological father.\r\n[3]Â  Lanier v.

Patterson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-295\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2006 â€“ Filed June 26, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Joel F. Geer, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        Charles R. Norris, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Cleveland Ridge Homeownerâ€™s Association (Cleveland Ridge) appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting State Farm Fire and Casualty Company and State Farm General Insurance Companyâ€™s (collectively â€œState Farmâ€) motion for summary judgment.Â  We affirm.Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nCleveland Ridge is the homeownerâ€™s association of a Greenville condominium complex and the named insured of a property and liability insurance policy with State Farm (Policy).Â  The Policy excludes loss caused by (1) â€œthe pressure or weight of . . . waterâ€; (2) â€œearth movement, meaning the sinking, rising, shifting, expanding or contracting of earth, all whether combined with water or notâ€; or (3) a â€œlatent defect or any quality in the property that causes it to damage or destroy itself.â€Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nOn August 4, 2003, a concrete retaining wall behind the condominium complex failed after a heavy rain.Â  The next day, Cleveland Ridge reported the incident to State Farm, who sent an agent to examine the damage.Â  The agent informed Cleveland Ridge the Policy did not cover the retaining wall damage and, on August 21, 2003, denied the claim. Â Â \r\nThree months later, Cleveland Ridge, through legal counsel, advised State Farm of its opinion that the Policy covered the retaining wall damage. Â Â State Farm hired a structural engineer, Jack McCaskill, to inspect the retaining wall.Â  McCaskill determined the retaining wall â€œmost likely collapsed due to excessive water pressure,â€ which created a â€œhydrostatic force too large to be contained by the non-reinforced hollow masonry unit wall.â€Â  After the inspection, State Farm again denied Cleveland Ridgeâ€™s claim. \r\nIn May 2004, Cleveland Ridge sued State Farm for breach of contract,Â  declaratory relief, violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-5-10 to 560 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005), and bad faith for refusing to pay the claim.Â  State Farm answered and ultimately filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting the Policy excluded Cleveland Ridgeâ€™s claim, SCUTPA exempted unfair trade practices involving the insurance business, and State Farm did not act in bad faith because it had a reasonable basis to deny Cleveland Ridgeâ€™s claim.Â  In January 2005, the trial court granted State Farmâ€™s motion.Â  \r\nIn February 2005, Cleveland Ridge filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, which the trial court denied.Â  The trial court found Cleveland Ridge did not comply with Rule 59(e), SCRCP, because Cleveland Ridge did not file its Rule 59(e) motion within ten days of its receipt of the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  The trial court also concluded Cleveland Ridge did not comply with Rule 59(g), SCRCP, because Cleveland Ridge did not provide the trial court with a copy of its Rule 59(e) motion within ten days after Cleveland Ridge filed it.Â  The trial court, however, denied Cleveland Ridgeâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion on the merits.Â  Cleveland Ridge appeals. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005).Â  Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  On appeal, all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  Once a defendant moving for summary judgment shows an absence of evidence to support the plaintiffâ€™s case, under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, the plaintiff must come forward with affidavits or other supporting documents setting forth specific facts that demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial.Â  Montgomery v. CSX Transp., Inc., 362 S.C. 529, 542, 608 S.E.2d 440, 447 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 320, 548 S.E.2d 854, 856 (2001)).Â  â€œThe construction and enforcement of an unambiguous contract is a question of law for the court, and thus can be properly disposed of at summary judgment.â€Â  Hansen ex rel. Hansen v. United Servs. Auto. Assâ€™n, 350 S.C. 62, 67, 565 S.E.2d 114, 116 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing Middleborough Horizontal Prop. Regime Council of Co-Owners v. Montedison S.p.A., 320 S.C. 470, 477, 465 S.E.2d 765, 770 (Ct. App. 1995)).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n Cleveland Ridge raises six issues on appeal; four relate to the trial courtâ€™s grant of State Farmâ€™s summary judgment motion and two relate to the trial courtâ€™s denial of Cleveland Ridgeâ€™s Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion. \r\nI.Â Â State Farmâ€™s Motion for Summary Judgment \r\nCleveland Ridge argues the trial court erred in granting State Farmâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA.Â Â Ambiguity of the Policy \r\nCleveland Ridge first asserts the Policy is ambiguous.Â  \r\n\r\n  The foremost rule in interpreting an insurance contract is to give effect to the intent of the parties as shown by the language of the contract itself.Â  When the contract language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contractâ€™s force, and terms must be construed to give effect to their â€œplain, ordinary, and popular meaning.â€\r\n\r\nDorman v. Allstate Inc. Co., 332 S.C. 176, 178, 504 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing Gray v. State Farm Auto. Ins. Co., 327 S.C. 646, 650, 491 S.E.2d 272, 274 (Ct. App. 1997)).Â  The meaning of an insurance contract should not be tortured to allow for coverage that was not intended by the parties.Â  Torrington Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 264 S.C. 636, 643, 216 S.E.2d 547, 550 (1975).Â  Thus, an unambiguous policy â€œmust be construed according to the terms the parties have used.â€Â  Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 565, 561 S.E.2d 355, 358 (2002).Â  We find the Policy clearly and unambiguously excludes loss caused by (1) â€œthe pressure or weight of . . . waterâ€; (2) â€œearth movement, meaning the sinking, rising, shifting, expanding or contracting of earth, all whether combined with water or notâ€; or (3) a â€œlatent defect or any quality in the property that causes it to damage or destroy itself.â€Â  Accordingly, if any one of these three events caused the retaining wall loss, the Policy excludes it.Â  \r\nB.Â Â Genuine Issues of Material Fact\r\nCleveland Ridge next asserts a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether water pressure, earth movement, or a latent defect caused the retaining wall loss.Â  State Farm offered an affidavit from McCaskill, a structural engineer, who inspected the retaining wall in November 2003.Â  Based on this inspection, McCaskill attested that (1) â€œ[t]he retaining wall most likely collapsed due to excessive water pressureâ€; (2) â€œ[t]he water pressure and the movement of earth against the retaining wall caused it to failâ€; and (3) â€œthe retaining wall was defectively constructed and had a latent defect in that it contained no steel reinforcement and did not contain an adequate drainage system to allow ground water to be adequately drained away from behind the wall.â€Â  In response, Cleveland Ridge offered an affidavit from Richard Kapp, also an engineer.Â  Kapp attested â€œthat there are numerous possible causes for the retaining wall failure[,] [a]ny one of which could have been responsible alone for the failure or could have contributed jointly to the retaining wall failure.â€Â Â Â  \r\nWe find the trial court did not err in granting State Farmâ€™s motion for summary judgment because Kappâ€™s affidavit fails to set forth any specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.Â  Rule 59(e), SCRCP; Russell v. Wachovia Bank, 353 S.C. 208, 220, 578 S.E.2d 329, 335 (2003) (citing Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991)) (â€œWhen opposing a summary judgment motion, the nonmoving party must do more than â€˜simply show that there is a metaphysical doubt as to the material facts but must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.â€™â€).Â  Although Kapp claims there are â€œnumerous possible causesâ€ for the retaining wall loss, he does not put forth what any of these â€œpossible causesâ€ might be.Â  He does suggest that these â€œpossible causesâ€ are something other than water pressure, earth movement, or a latent defect.Â  He is not even sure whether these â€œpossible causesâ€ most probably led to the retaining wall loss.Â  Consequently, as a matter of law, Kappâ€™s affidavit fails to show a genuine issue of material fact exists that water pressure, earth movement, or a latent defect did not cause the retaining wall loss.Â  \r\nC.Â SCUTPA Claim \r\nCleveland Ridge further asserts the trial court erred in granting State Farmâ€™s motion for summary judgment on Cleveland Ridgeâ€™s SCUTPA action.Â  Unfair trade practices involving the insurance business are regulated by the Insurance Trade Practices Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 38-57-10 to -320 (2002).Â  Section 39-5-40(c) of the South Carolina Code expressly exempts from the scope of SCUTPA unfair trade practices covered and regulated by the Insurance Trade Practices Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-40 (c) (Supp. 2005).Â  Thus, Cleveland Ridgeâ€™s claim is not covered by SCUTPA.\r\nCleveland Ridge, however, rationalizes SCUTPA does not exempt its cause of action because section 39-5-40(c) refers to Chapter 55, which concerns the conduct of insurance business, rather than Chapter 57, which is the Insurance Trade Practices Act.Â  Section 39-5-40(c) does, in fact, refer to Chapter 55 rather than Chapter 57, but such obstinate literality belies the legislative intent.Â  As the District Court of South Carolina observed, the Insurance Trade Practices Act, which was codified as Chapter 55, was recodified as Chapter 57 in 1987, and section 39-5-40(c) was not revised to reflect that change.Â  See Trs. of Grace Reformed Episcopal Church v. Charleston Ins. Co., 868 F. Supp. 128, 131 (D.S.C. 1994).Â  Clearly, the legislature intended SCUTPA to exempt cases of unfair trade practices regarding the insurance business because the Insurance Trade Practice Act specifically covers such cases.Â  See id. at 130-31 (â€œSCUTPA, through Â§ 39-5-40(c), provides a clear exemption for the practices covered by Chapter 57[;] [t]herefore, all unfair trade practices regarding the insurance business are regulated by the Insurance Trade Practices Act . . . and are exempt from the coverage of SCUTPA.â€).Â  Therefore, the trial court properly granted State Farmâ€™s motion for summary judgment on this cause of action.\r\nD.Â Bad Faith Claim\r\nCleveland Ridge finally asserts the trial court erred in granting State Farmâ€™s motion for summary judgment on its bad faith cause of action.Â  Under South Carolina law, an insurer acts in bad faith when there is no reasonable basis to support the insurerâ€™s decision.Â  Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 6, 466 S.E.2d 727, 730 (1996); Crossley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 307 S.C. 354, 360, 415 S.E.2d 393, 397 (1992).Â  Here, there is no evidence in the record to suggest State Farm unreasonably denied coverage for the retaining wall loss.Â  Thus, the trial court correctly granted State Farmâ€™s motion for summary judgment on this cause of action. \r\nII.Â Cleveland Ridgeâ€™s Rule 59(e) Motion\r\nFinally, Cleveland Ridge argues the trial court erred in denying its Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for failing to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 59(e) and (g).Â  We disagree.Â  Although the trial court found Cleveland Ridge failed to comply with the procedures set forth by Rules 59(e) and (g), the trial court nevertheless addressed and rejected its Rule 59(e) motion on the merits.Â  Accordingly, we discern no prejudice to Cleveland Ridge.Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court correctly granted State Farmâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Further, Cleveland Ridge was not prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s denial of its Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-296","title":"State v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, Â for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Allen Marty Cornwell appeals his conviction for voluntary manslaughter.Â  Cornwell argues the trial judge erred in allowing the State to elicit a prior bad act and in refusing to direct a verdict on the charge of voluntary manslaughter.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn May 1997, Tyson Wolf and his family visited Cornwell, his step-grandfather, at Cornwellâ€™s apartment in North Myrtle Beach.Â  Wolf and Cornwell consumed alcohol at the family gathering.Â  At some point in the evening, Wolf was slapped by his mother for talking back to her.Â  Shortly thereafter, the police arrived in response to a domestic disturbance report.Â  After a brief investigation, the police left.Â  Cornwell then went into his bedroom and closed the door. \r\nThe family members became angry when they discovered Cornwell had called the police and used Wolfâ€™s step-fatherâ€™s name instead of his own to report the domestic dispute.Â  Wolf began sobbing, went to the guest bedroom, and closed the door.Â  The other family members remained in the living room.Â  Moments later, Cornwell opened his bedroom door and had a gun in his hand.Â  Then, Wolf opened the guest bedroom door and said something to Cornwell. Cornwell shot Wolf in the chest.Â  Wolf later died from the wound. Â Â \r\nAt trial, Cornwell testified that he, fearing for his life, shot Wolf.Â  Cornwell said Wolf charged him while he was sitting on his bed.Â  The trial judge charged the jury with self-defense and voluntary manslaughter.Â  The jury convicted Cornwell of voluntary manslaughter and the judge sentenced him to seventeen years imprisonment.Â  Cornwell appeals. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCornwell argues the trial judge erred in allowing the State to elicit a prior bad act and in refusing to direct a verdict on the charge of voluntary manslaughter.Â  We disagree. \r\nA.Â Â Prior Bad Act\r\nCornwell asserts the trial judge erred in allowing the State to question him about a crime he committed two weeks prior to the crime he was charged with at trial.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion that results in prejudice to the defendant. State v. Sosebee, 284 S.C. 411, 413, 326 S.E.2d 654, 656 (1985); State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 352, 543 S.E.2d 586, 591 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 324, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).Â  The trial judge may exclude relevant evidence if its â€œprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 148 (1991); State v. Hess, 279 S.C. 14, 18, 301 S.E.2d 547, 550 (1983). Â The trial judgeâ€™s Rule 403, SCRE, ruling will be reversed by the appellate court only in exceptional circumstances.Â  State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 568, 598 S.E.2d 279, 286 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nTwo weeks before the shooting, Cornwell pled no contest to the crime of simple assault and battery.Â  Cornwell struck his wifeâ€™s friend multiple times after she slapped him.Â  Cornwell argued the trial judge should exclude the simple assault as overly prejudicial.Â  The State, however, argued that if Cornwell claimed he did not have the strength to defend himself against Wolf, the simple assault should be admitted as evidence Cornwell had the strength to defend himself.Â  The trial judge allowed the State to question Cornwell about the simple assault, but only if Cornwell first testified that he was unable to defend himself because he lacked the strength to do so.Â  Ultimately, the trial judge allowed the State to elicit the simple assault because Cornwell testified that he shot Wolf because he lacked the strength to fight him. Â Â \r\nAlthough we might have ruled differently, particularly because Cornwellâ€™s ability to defend himself against his wifeâ€™s friend appears to have little bearing on his ability to defend himself against his entire family, we do not find the trial judge erred in declining to exclude this evidence as overly prejudicial.Â  Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 358, 543 S.E.2d 586, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œA trial judgeâ€™s balancing decision under Rule 403 should not be reversed simply because an appellate court believes it would have decided the matter otherwise because of a differing view of the highly subjective factors of the probative value or the prejudice presented by the evidence.â€).Â  Moreover, even if the trial judge erred, the error was harmless in light of the fact it could not have reasonably affected the outcome of this case.Â  State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 93, 180 S.E.2d 888, 890 (1971).Â  \r\nB.Â Directed Verdict\r\nCornwell next asserts the trial judge erred in denying his directed verdict motion because there was no evidence he committed voluntary manslaughter.Â  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, the appellate court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 583, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001).Â  If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt, the appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Id.Â  A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  Id.Â  However, â€œwhen the defendant presents testimony, he loses the right to have the court review the sufficiency of the evidence based on the [S]tateâ€™s evidence alone.â€Â  State v. Harry, 321 S.C. 273, 277, 468 S.E.2d 76, 79 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\nThe crime of voluntary manslaughter is defined as the intentional killing of a human being in the sudden heat of passion resulting from sufficient legal provocation.Â  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 118, 481 S.E.2d 118, 122 (1997).Â  The provocation necessary to support a voluntary manslaughter charge must come from some act of the victim in order to constitute sufficient legal provocation.Â  State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 171, 478 S.E.2d 260, 269 (1996).Â  â€œWords alone, no matter how opprobrious, are not sufficient to prove legal provocation when a deadly weapon is used.â€Â  State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 361, 535 S.E.2d 420, 424 (2000); State v. Gardner, 219 S.C. 97, 104, 64 S.E.2d 130, 134 (1951).Â  Rather, when death is caused by the use of a deadly weapon, the opprobrious words must be accompanied by the appearance of an assault that could have produced the heat of passion.Â  State v. Lowry, 315 S.C. 396, 399, 434 S.E.2d 272, 274 (1993).Â  Â Â \r\nHere, there is evidence in the record Wolf provoked Cornwell beyond the mere use of opprobrious words.Â  Cornwell testified Wolf was about to initiate a physical encounter with him.Â  Cornwell said Wolf charged him while Cornwell sat on his bed.Â  Cornwell told the jury:\r\n\r\n  [Wolf] just continued to cuss me and then he said, [â€˜]Iâ€™ll just kill you now, you son of a bitch[â€™] and started and came through my door [], charging me as hard as he could go and when I shot him the bullet just stood him up and stopped him.Â  He spun and run out . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  In light of Cornwellâ€™s testimony, we believe there is evidence in the record to support the charge of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Accordingly, the trial judgeâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKittredge, Short, and Williams, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-297","title":"Employers Insurance v.

Hansen, of Tuckerton, N.J.; Pro Se.\r\n        John S. Wilkerson, III, Troy G. Thames, and R. Hawthorne Barrett, all of Charleston, Pope D. Johnson, III, of Columbia and Robert W. Achurch, III, and Mary Bass Lohr, both of Beaufort; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Employers Insurance of Wausau (Wausau) sued attorney Robert J. Moran and Moranâ€™s former client Eric C. Hansen to recover funds in Moranâ€™s escrow account on which it claimed a lien for benefits paid to Moran under the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act.[1]Â  In his responsive pleadings, Hansen filed counterclaims against Wausau and cross-claims against Moran.Â  After the trial court granted Moranâ€™s request to interplead the disputed funds into the court, it granted summary judgment to Moran on Hansenâ€™s cross-claims, dismissed some of Hansenâ€™s counterclaims against Wausau, and dismissed third-party claims that Hansen later brought against Caldwellâ€™s Diving (Caldwell), his former employer.Â  Hansen appeals.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 17, 1991, Hansen, while working for Caldwell as a commercial diver, was seriously injured when a crane became detached and fell on him.Â  Although Hansen resided in New Jersey, the accident occurred at the Port Royal Sound in Beaufort, South Carolina.Â  \r\nWausau provided insurance for Caldwell, including coverage under the LHWCA and the Jones Act.[3]Â  Pursuant to the LHWCA, Wausau, on Caldwellâ€™s behalf, paid Hansen voluntary medical and disability benefits totaling $181,160.04.\r\n In November 1993, after Hansen applied for compensation under the LHWCA, Moran sued Caldwell on Hansenâ€™s behalf in the Beaufort County Court of Common Pleas alleging Caldwell was negligent under the Jones Act and breached certain duties relating to seaworthiness.Â  After this action was filed, Wausau discontinued paying Hansen LHWCA benefits.[4]\r\nThe parties settled the lawsuit in 1996.Â  Under their agreement, Hansenâ€™s total settlement was $1,320,325.88.Â  This amount included a waiver by Wausau of a lien it claimed on $181,160.04 that it had paid to Hansen under the LHWCA.Â  The waiver of the lien, however, was contingent on approval of the settlement by the United States Department of Labor pursuant to Â§ 908(i) of the LHWCA.[5] \r\nHansen received $1,139,165.84, representing the â€œcashâ€ portion of the settlement after the deduction of counsel fees and costs. Â Moran retained $181,160.04, the amount of the lien, in his escrow account pending approval of the settlement by the Department of Labor.Â  \r\nHansen executed the necessary documents to effect the settlement; however, the district director of the Department of Labor â€œtolledâ€ the approval period because of insufficient information.Â  Later, however, Hansen informed the director he was not ready to settle the claim, prompting the director to â€œshelveâ€ the settlement approval pending submission of a new petition and Hansenâ€™s agreement to proceed. \r\nMoran later ceased acting as Hansenâ€™s attorney, but retained the $181,160.04 in his escrow account pending resolution of Wausauâ€™s claimed lien.Â  Moran claimed he was properly withholding the disputed funds under the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  Moranâ€™s law firm produced an attorney-client settlement statement detailing fees and costs and reducing the amount disbursed to Hansen by these amounts.Â  The fees were calculated based on the total amount of the settlement, including the escrowed funds.\r\nBy order dated August 7, 1998, a federal administrative law judge in Camden, New Jersey, found Hansen was not entitled to benefits or attorney fees under the LHWCA because he was classified as a seaman.Â  The order did not address Wausauâ€™s prior payments or the claimed lien.Â  On or about November 26, 2001, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari on Hansenâ€™s appeal of this order, thus in effect upholding the determination that Hansen was ineligible to recover under the LHWCA.\r\nBy letter dated April 17, 2001, the Department of Labor disapproved the settlement and further advised Hansen the funds in Moranâ€™s escrow account â€œmust be repaid to the employer/insurer as a result of their lien due to benefits paid voluntarily under the [LHWCA].â€Â  On January 15, 2003, however, the Department sent another letter stating â€œour office has no authority to determine the proper ownership of those funds.Â  Therefore, it was a regrettable error when we advised Mr. Hansen . . . that the $181,000 held in escrow from the Jones Act settlement must be repaid to the employer/carrier.â€Â  The Department further advised in the second letter that â€œthe [LHWCA] does not have any provision for recoupment of benefits erroneously paid, except as a credit against future compensation payable.â€ \r\nOn December 5, 2002, Wausau commenced this action in the Georgetown County Court of Common Pleas against Hansen and Moran to recover the escrowed funds.Â  Hansen hired a new attorney and counterclaimed against Wausau, alleging causes of action for collection, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and unfair trade practices.Â  Hansen also filed a cross-claim against Moran, alleging causes of action for collection, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, negligence, breach of trust, and unfair trade practices.\r\nOn December 16, 2003, Circuit Judge Paula Thomas held a hearing on various motions in the case, including Hansenâ€™s motion for judgment on the pleadings and Moranâ€™s requests for interpleader and permission to deposit the escrowed funds into the court.Â  At the hearing, the parties consented to the withdrawal of Moranâ€™s motion to deposit the funds because the funds were earning interest in Moranâ€™s escrow account.Â  By order dated December 18, 2003, Judge Thomas noted the motion was withdrawn and informed the parties she was taking Hansenâ€™s motion for judgment on the pleadings under advisement.\r\nOn January 26, 2004, Judge Thomas issued an order granting Hansenâ€™s motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding Hansen was entitled to judgment on both Wausauâ€™s claim for the $181,160.04 in Moranâ€™s escrow account and his counterclaim for these funds.Â  According to Judge Thomas, â€œ[Wausau] has no cause of action under South Carolina law, and therefore no remedy in a South Carolina Court.Â  Essentially, [Wausau] is attempting to create a state court remedy where there is none.â€Â  Judge Thomas further statedÂ  â€œ[t]he issues raised by [Wausau] would appear to be better addressed to the Federal Courts and to the administrative agency concerned with the [LHWCA],â€ finding â€œthere is no provision of [the LHWCA] or the Jones Act which gives [Wausau] the remedy it seeks. . . . There is also no indication that Congress intended to provide employers or their insurers with a state or federal court remedy to recoup erroneously paid benefits.â€\r\nJudge Thomas further held the only means by which Wausau could conceivably obtain a lien on the funds would be under the provisions of the LHWCA or the Jones Act, but noted â€œCongress has clearly spoken on this issue.Â  It is not the role of a state court to create such a remedy under these facts.â€Â  Ultimately, Judge Thomas concluded â€œWausau has no right to a lien against the proceeds of Hansenâ€™s settlementâ€ and ordered Moran to release the funds in his escrow account to Hansen.\r\nIn her order, Judge Thomas specifically addressed the issues raised by the parties and analyzed the relevant state and federal law applicable to Wausauâ€™s lien claim.Â  She concluded Wausau â€œarticulated no salient cause of action andÂ  . . . this claim should not proceed further.â€Â  Although Judge Thomas acknowledged the issues Wausau raised in its pleadings â€œwould appear to be better addressed to the Federal Courts and to the administrative agency concerned with the [LHWCA],â€ she granted Hansenâ€™s motion for judgment on the pleadings based on her determination that Wausau â€œhas no remedy under the facts alleged.â€ As we read her order and consider it in its entirety, Judge Thomas never specifically ruled the South Carolina state courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter.Â  Â Â \r\nWausau moved to alter or amend Judge Thomasâ€™s decision.Â  Specifically, Wausau alleged error in the trial courtâ€™s failure to find it had a judicially created lien against the settlement funds in the amount it erroneously paid to Hansen.Â  Wausau also maintained the court did not have authority to order disbursement of the money held in escrow because the order appeared to indicate that the federal court was the appropriate forum to decide such claims.\r\nOn February 18, 2004, Judge Thomas issued an order denying Wausauâ€™s post-trial motion on the issue of the judgment on the pleadings.Â  Wausau did not appeal this portion of the order.Â  \r\nAs to release of the funds; however, the order provided as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  The Motion to Reconsider with regards to the deposit of funds is hereby GRANTED due to the fact that this motion was withdrawn by the attorney for the Defendant at the hearing before the court.Â  This is evidenced in the Form Order signed by this Court on December 18, 2003.Â  Thus there is no outstanding motion regarding the funds upon which a ruling is necessary.\r\n\r\nJudge Thomas issued an amended order on February 20, 2004, in which she deleted information about the motion being withdrawn and stated the following:Â  \r\n\r\n  The Motion to Reconsider with regard to the deposit of funds is hereby GRANTED, therefore, that portion of the Order requiring disbursement of the funds is stricken.Â  The court finds that issue was not before it for determination.Â  This is evidenced in the Form Order signed by this Court on December 18, 2003.Â  Thus there is no outstanding motion regarding the funds upon which a ruling is necessary.\r\n\r\nOn March 2, 2004, Hansen filed a motion to compel the release of the funds.Â  Pursuant to this motion, Judge Thomas issued an order dated March 9, 2004, in which she stated â€œ[t]his Court did not order the funds to be held in escrow and therefore, will not order them released.Â  This Court did, in a previous order, dismiss the pending claim due to lack of jurisdiction of this Court.â€[6]\r\nSubsequently, numerous motions came before Circuit Judge James Lockemy, including Hansenâ€™s motion to file a third-party complaint against Caldwell and Moranâ€™s motions for summary judgment and for leave to deposit the funds into the court. On April 5, 2004, Judge Lockemy issued a form order granting Hansenâ€™s motion to bring Caldwell into the lawsuit, addressing certain concerns not at issue in this appeal, and taking other motions under advisement.\r\nOn September 23, 2004, Judge Lockemy issued a final order granting Moranâ€™s motion for summary judgment on all Hansenâ€™s claims against him and Moranâ€™s motion to deposit the escrowed funds into the court.Â  In granting summary judgment, Judge Lockemy found the statute of limitations barred Hansenâ€™s cross-claims against Moran.\r\nOn the same date, Judge Lockemy issued a second order dismissing Hansenâ€™s claims against Wausau and Caldwell without prejudice.Â  In this order, Judge Lockemy interpreted Judge Thomasâ€™s orders of January 26, 2004, and March 9, 2004, to dismiss Wausauâ€™s claim against Hansen â€œfor lack of jurisdiction, for that claim to be addressed in federal court.â€Â  Judge Lockemy further found as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  Mr. Hansenâ€™s claims against Wausau and the third-party defendant arise out of and pertain to the application of the [LHWCA] and those depend or may depend on the federal courtâ€™s determination of Wausauâ€™s claim.Â  I find that Mr. Hansenâ€™s claims against Wausau and the third-party defendant should be decided by the federal court.Â  Having those claims decided in the federal court would insure that there was proper subject matter jurisdiction as to all claims and would eliminate the risk of inconsistent results and avoid unnecessary duplication of time and expense on the part of the court systems and the litigants.\r\n\r\nJudge Lockemy also ordered the Georgetown County Clerk of Court to â€œhold the funds on deposit pending an Order of the United States District Court or any other court of competent jurisdiction, authorizing and directing the release of the funds, or an agreement of Mr. Hansen and Wausau authorizing and directing the release of the funds.â€Â  Finally, Judge Lockemy relieved Hansenâ€™s attorney of any further responsibility to represent Hansen in the matter once counsel delivered a copy of the order to Hansen.\r\nIn October 2004, Hansen, proceeding pro se, filed a â€œMotion for reconsideration and to withdraw, alter or amend both of the September orders issued by Judge Lockemy.Â  In addition, he moved for sanctions, costs, and fees.Â  By orders dated December 14, 2004, and January 19, 2005, Judge Lockemy denied Hansenâ€™s motions.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS[7]\r\n1.Â  Hansen contends Judge Lockemy erred in holding his claims against Moran were untimely.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn reviewing the grant of summary judgment, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court:Â  i.e., summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.[8]Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences that can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.[9]Â  â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party below.â€[10]Â  \r\nAll Hansenâ€™s claims against Moran fall under a three-year statute of limitations.[11]Â  Under the discovery rule, the three-year limitations period begins to run from the date the injured party either knows or should know by â€œthe exercise of reasonable diligenceâ€ that a cause of action exists for the wrongful conduct.[12] \r\nIn the present case, the record clearly demonstrates Hansen knew or should have known of his potential claims against Moran in 1996, when Moran retained his fees out of the settlement and retained part of the settlement funds in his escrow account rather than disburse them to Hansen.[13]Â  Hansen failed to take any action on those claims until 2003, when he filed his cross-claims against Moran in this action, almost seven years after Moran placed the disputed funds into escrow and withheld attorney fees and costs.Â  \r\n2.Â  Hansen contends the trial court erred in granting Moranâ€™s motion for interpleader and leave to deposit the disputed funds with the clerk of court.Â  We disagree.Â  Hansen, through his attorney, consented to the funds being entrusted to the clerk of court and is bound by his counselâ€™s action.[14] \r\nJohn S. Wilkerson represented Moran and David B. Marvel represented Hansen at the hearing before Judge Lockemy. The following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\n  THE COURT: . . . What other issues are there on your behalf now at this time, Mr. Wilkerson?\r\n  MR. WILKERSON: The only other one that I have, Your Honor, I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s going to be a dispute about this. We just need the Courtâ€™s assistance on this. Is that Mr. Moran has continued to maintain these funds in an interest bearing escrow account. . . . Â We filed a[n] interpleader asking if we be allowed to interplead the funds into the court or the Court to rule on whoâ€™s entitled to the money.\r\n  . . . I have here a certified check from the Bank of America in the total amount of $232,092.48 made payable to the clerk of court of Georgetown County. We would like to have the Court order that that money be . . . accepted by the clerk of court and held until further order of the Court so that these other parties can resolve their issues as to who is entitled to this money. . . .\r\n  THE COURT: Mr. Marvel, you object to the amount file[d] with the clerk of court? \r\n  MR. MARVEL: No, Your Honor.\r\n  THE COURT: All right, your motionâ€™s granted.\r\n  MR. WILKERSON: Thank you, Your Honor. So, should I present to the Court an order to the effect that the money is being received by the clerk of court pursuant to this courtâ€™s order to be - - - Â \r\n  THE COURT: Without objection from the co-defendant.\r\n  MR. WILKERSON: - - - to be held until further order of the Court.\r\n  THE COURT: Thatâ€™s fine.\r\n  MR. WILKERSON: Thank you, Your Honor. I am at this point presenting to the clerk of court that certified check.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, under the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, â€œ[a]ny party seeking interpleader, . . . may deposit with the court the amount claimed . . . .Â  The court may thereupon order such party discharged from liability as to such claims, and the action continued as between claimants of such money or property.â€[15]Â  In the present case, Moranâ€™s answer to Hansenâ€™s cross-claims contained a request for the court to allow Moran to deposit the funds with the clerk of court.Â  Moran was merely the party holding the money and, once summary judgment was granted in his favor on all of Hansenâ€™s claims, he no longer had any interest in the action.Â  \r\n3.Â  We agree, however, with Hansenâ€™s argument that Judge Lockemy improperly dismissed his claims for lack of jurisdiction in the state court and in favor of having the claims heard in federal court.\r\nSubject-matter jurisdiction is the â€œ â€˜power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€™ â€[16]Â  Both Wausauâ€™s claim and Hansenâ€™s first counterclaim were collection actions to recover the money in Moranâ€™s escrow account.Â  Such actions are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the state courts,[17] as are Hansenâ€™s remaining causes of action for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act and unfair trade practices.[18]Â  \r\nThe fact that Hansenâ€™s claims â€œarise out of and pertain toâ€ or were brought under either the Jones Act or the LHWCA does not deprive the South Carolina State courts of jurisdiction to decide them.Â  Under, the United States Constitution, federal judicial power â€œshall extend . . . to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.â€[19] Â â€œFederal-court jurisdiction over such cases, however, has never been entirely exclusive.â€[20] \r\nâ€œA suit under the Jones Act to recover damages for injury to or death of a seaman may be brought in either a federal or a state court.â€[21]Â  Such an action, when commenced in a state court, is not subject to removal even when there is diversity of citizenship.[22] Â Moreover, the state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over many claims under the LHWCA.[23]Â Â Â  \r\nFurthermore, in an action that Hansen and his wife filed in the United States District Court in New Jersey against Caldwell, United States District Judge Mary L. Cooper issued a memorandum opinion on June 7, 2005, declining to consider the Hansensâ€™ claims in that action because of the pending appeal before this court. Â We find particularly instructive footnote 3 of Judge Cooperâ€™s order, in which she explained as follows:\r\n\r\n  The South Carolina Court of Common Pleas seems to have erred in finding [the Hansensâ€™] claim arising out of the LHWCA should be resolved by a federal court. . . . Third party actions under [the] LHWCA may be tried by state courts. See Kermarec v Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 3[5]8 U.S. 625, 628 (1959) (â€œIf this action [an action by a guest of a crew member for injuries sustained on a vessel brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York] had been brought in state court, reference to admiralty law would have been necessary to determine the rights and liabilities of the parties.â€); Paxos v. Jarka Corp., 171 A. 468, 469 (Pa. 1934) (â€œAdmittedly, practice in the federal courts does not control in the courts of this state, but we [the Pennsylvania Supreme Court] will enforce the substantive rights given all parties here of record by the federal [LWHCA].â€).\r\n\r\nMoreover, state courts may decide actions for maintenance and cure and â€œare bound to proceed in such manner that all substantial rights of the parties under controlling federal law will be protected.â€[24] \r\n We therefore reverse the trial courtâ€™s determination that it lacked authority to hear Hansenâ€™s claims against Wausau and Caldwell and remand these claims for a decision on the merits.[25]Â  \r\n4.Â  In addition, we hold Judge Lockemyâ€™s dismissal of Hansenâ€™s collection claim against Wausau was improper.Â  In her order, Judge Thomas addressed the merits of Wausauâ€™s claim for the escrowed funds and Hansenâ€™s counterclaim for collection of the money.Â  Although Judge Thomas stated Wausauâ€™s claims â€œwould appear to be better addressed to the Federal Courts and to the administrative agency concerned with the LHWCA,â€ she nevertheless addressed the merits of these claims after considering the relevant state and federal law and held Wausau â€œhas articulated no salient cause of action and that this claim should not be allowed to proceed further.â€ Â Contrary to Judge Lockemyâ€™s interpretation of Judge Thomasâ€™s order, Judge Thomas did not dismiss the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Rather, Judge Thomas granted Hansen judgment on the pleadings on Wausauâ€™s lien claim, thus ruling he was entitled to the disputed funds once the court acquired jurisdiction to disburse them.Â  Because Judge Thomas had already ruled on the merits of those claims, the subsequent issuance of a contrary ruling by another trial judge was error.[26]Â  \r\n5.Â  Hansen contends the trial court erred in failing to enforce the judgment granted in his favor for the money that Moran had held in escrow.Â  \r\nTo the extent this argument concerns Judge Thomasâ€™s orders, we hold Judge Thomas properly ruled that she did not have jurisdiction over the money to order its release because it had not been interpleaded into the court.[27]Â  In addition, we find Hansen failed to preserve any issues concerning Judge Thomasâ€™s rulings for review on appeal.[28]Â  \r\nSubsequently, however, Judge Lockemy granted Moranâ€™s request for interpleader and permission to deposit the money with the clerk of court.Â  Once the money was deposited, the court obtained jurisdiction over it and could order its release.[29]Â  Because Wausau did not appeal Judge Thomasâ€™s rulings that it had no right to recover the money improperly paid to Hansen, that Hansen was entitled to prevail on his counterclaim for payment the escrowed funds, Judge Thomasâ€™s decision is the law of this case.[30]Â  Accordingly, the trial court should have issued an order releasing the money deposited with the clerk of court to Hansen pursuant to Judge Thomasâ€™s order of January 26, 2004.\r\n6.Â  Hansen raises issues on appeal related to various form orders the trial court issued in this case.Â  These form orders have been superseded by formal orders.Â  â€œ â€˜A case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon [the] existing controversy.Â  This is true when some event occurs making it impossible for [the] reviewing Court to grant effectual relief.â€™ â€[31]Â  This court will only address those issues on appeal pertaining to the final formal orders by the trial court.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to allow Moran to deposit the escrowed funds into the court and the grant of summary judgment on Hansenâ€™s claims against Moran.Â  We reverse the trial courtâ€™s findings that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Hansenâ€™s claims and remand these proceedings to the trial court for (1) entry of an order directing the clerk of court, pursuant to Judge Thomasâ€™s order granting Hansen judgment on the pleadings, to disburse to Hansen the funds deposited by Moran, and (2) consideration of Hansenâ€™s remaining causes of action against Wausau and Caldwell. \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  33 U.S.C. Â§ 901-950 (hereinafter referred to as LHWCA).\r\n[2]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] Â 46 U.S.C. app. Â§ 688.\r\n[4]Â  According to Wausau, coverage under the Jones Act is mutually exclusive of that under the LHWCA.\r\n[5]Â  Under this section, â€œ[n]o liability of any employer, carrier, or both for medical, disability, or death benefits [under the LHWCA] shall be discharged unless the application for settlement is approved by the deputy commissioner or administrative law judge.â€Â  33 U.S.C. Â§ 908(i)(1).\r\n[6] We interpret the term â€œpending claimâ€ to refer to Hansenâ€™s motion for immediate possession of the disputed funds, the matter that prompted the issuance of the order of March 9, 2004.Â  The orders of February 18, 2004, and February 20, 2004, superseded the provision in Judge Thomasâ€™s order of January 26, 2004, in which she directed Moran to release the funds to Hansen.Â  Both of the later orders reference either expressly or by implication the withdrawal of Moranâ€™s motion for interpleader with the consent of all parties at the hearing on December 16, 2003, as documented in a form order Judge Thomas signed on December 18, 2003.Â  In both the February 18 and February 20 orders, Judge Thomas concluded â€œthere is no outstanding motion regarding the funds upon which a ruling is necessary,â€ indicating she was unable to exercise jurisdiction over disbursement of the money given the procedural posture of the case at the time.\r\n[7] Â Hansen raised a total of 25 issues on appeal in his 75-page brief.Â  We have consolidated the issues for purposes of this opinion.\r\n[8] Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Baughman v.

Wilson appeals the trial courtâ€™s acceptance of his guilty plea and denial of his motion for a new trial.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTSÂ Â Â Â Â  \r\nFrom October 2003 until November 2003, Wilson had contact with a younger female (Victim).Â  During this time, Wilson drugged Victim, engaged in sex acts with her, and took photos of her in â€œsexyâ€ posses and of her genitals.Â  On November 23, 2003, Victimâ€™s family reported Wilsonâ€™s conduct to the police.Â  Victimâ€™s family stated Victim was sixteen years old when Wilson engaged in the conduct with Victim.Â  This claim was supported by a birth certificate (Certificate One) showing Victimâ€™s date of birth as March 15, 1987. Â Â \r\nDuring his preparation for trial, Wilson obtained a birth certificate (Certificate Two) that he claimed stated Victimâ€™s date of birth as March 2, 1985.Â  Wilson claimed this proved Victim was eighteen when he engaged in the conduct with her.Â  However, there were discrepancies between the names of the child, mother, and father listed on Certificate Two and the names of Victim, Victimâ€™s mother, and Victimâ€™s father.Â  A copy of Certificate Two was sent to the solicitorâ€™s office on August 23, 2004.Â  Due to the discrepancy in the dates on the two birth certificates, Wilson sought authentication.Â  Victim is originally from the Republic of Liberia, and both certificates purported to be issued by Liberian officials.Â  In early September, Wilson contacted the Embassy of the Republic of Liberia about authenticating Certificate Two.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn September 20, 2004, Wilson pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation of a minor in the third degree and to contributing to the delinquency of a minor.Â  Pursuant to North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), he also pleaded without admitting guilt to criminal sexual conduct in the third degree.Â  Wilson was sentenced to ten years for criminal sexual conduct in the third degree, five years for sexual exploitation of a minor in the third degree to be served consecutively with the criminal sexual conduct sentence, and three years for contributing to the delinquency of a minor to be served concurrently with the criminal sexual conduct sentence. Â Â Â Â Â \r\nOn September 21, 2004, the Embassy of the Republic of Liberia certified Certificate Two as being authentic.Â  On September 24, 2004, Wilson moved to have his sentence reconsidered and reduced.Â  On October 18, 2004 the Embassy of the Republic of Liberia issued a letter to Wilson declaring Certificate One to be null and void. Â Based on the authentication of Certificate Two and the declaration that Certificate One was null and void, Wilson, on November 23, 2004, moved for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence. Â Â Â Â \r\nThe motions were argued to the court on December 10, 2004.Â  Victimâ€™s father testified that Victim was born March 15, 1987. Â Victimâ€™s Uncle testified that the first time he saw Victim was in February 1989, and Victim appeared, at that time, to be a child of two years old or younger.Â  On February 8, 2005, the court denied Wilsonâ€™s motion for a new trial and modified his sentence so all convictions would run concurrently. Â Wilson appeals this denial and appeals the trial courts acceptance of his guilty plea claiming that it was not made knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  After-Discovered Evidence\r\nWilson argues the authentication of Certificate Two is after-discovered evidence, and therefore, the trial court should have granted his motion for a new trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe denial of a motion for a new trial will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. South, 310 S.C. 504, 507, 427 S.E.2d 666, 668 (1993).Â  To be successful, the party seeking a new trial based on after-discovered evidence must show that the evidence: 1) would probably change the result if a new trial is had; 2) has been discovered since trial; 3) could not have been discovered before trial; 4) is material to the issue of guilt or innocence; &amp; 5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.Â  State v. Spann, 334 S.C. 618, 619, 513 S.E.2d 98, 99 (1999). \r\nWilson had Certificate Two since early August 2004, and he sought authentication from the Embassy of the Republic of Liberia in early September 2004. Â Therefore, he had certificate two before he plead guilty on September 20, 2004.Â  The only thing that Wilson received after he plead was certification that Certificate Two was authentic as to the person listed on it.Â  \r\nIf Wilson wished to put the issue of the validity of Certificate One or Two before the court, he should have moved for a continuance.Â  He was well aware of the discrepancies between the birth certificates, and instead of asking for additional time he decided to plea guilty and enter an Alford plea.Â  Therefore, Wilson can not show that the evidence has been discovered since trial or that it could not have been discovered before trial. Â Â \r\nB.Â  The Guilty Plea\r\nWilson argues his plea was not entered into knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily and is void as a violation of due process because he did not know certificate two would be authenticated by the Republic of Liberia.Â  We disagree.\r\nPleas are void as a violation of due process unless they are entered into knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.Â  Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709 (1969); Burnett v. State, 352 S.C. 589, 591, 576 S.E.2d144, 145 (2003).Â  Absent a timely objection during the plea proceeding, the unknowing and involuntary nature of a plea can only be attacked through the channel of Post Conviction Relief.Â  State v. McKinney, 278 S.C. 107, 108, 292 S.E.2d 598, 599 (1982).\r\nWilson claims that his plea could not have been entered into knowingly, intelligently, or voluntarily and is void as a violation of due process because he did not know certificate two would be authenticated by the Republic of Liberia.Â  The State correctly points out that Wilson failed to object during the plea proceedings.Â  Therefore, Wilson has waived consideration of this issue on appeal.Â  Absent an objection at the plea proceeding, the unknowing and involuntary nature of a guilty plea will not be considered on appeal.Â  Id. Â See also State v. Barton, 325 S.C. 522, 481 S.E.2d 439 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating the proper avenue through which to challenge a guilty plea which was not objected to at the time of its entry is through post-conviction relief).Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-299","title":"Kelley v.

Kelley, Jr. and Mary V. Kelley, appeal from an order granting summary judgment to the defendant, Sandra P. Herman. Â The action arises out of a real estate purchase in which the Kelleys claim Herman misrepresented which lot she was selling them.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nWe review, as we must, the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the Kelleys.Â  In early 2001, the Kelleys, a deaf couple, contacted The Home Place, Inc., a home builder with offices in Greenville, South Carolina, about their desire to purchase or build a home in Laurens County, South Carolina.Â  The Home Place put them in touch with Herman, who resided in the Hickory Forest subdivision of Laurens County and owned several lots there.Â  \r\nMr. Kelleyâ€™s mother contacted Herman, who told her that she had several pieces of property for sale.Â  Subsequently, the Kelleys, accompanied by Mr. Kelleyâ€™s parents, rode out to the subdivision late one afternoon at dusk to look at the property.Â  Hermanâ€™s lots were on a cul-de-sac at the end of Hickory Forest Drive.Â  As the Kelleys drove out of the cul-de-sac, they encountered Herman, who lived in the area and was approaching the cul-de-sac from the opposite direction.Â  They both stopped their cars in front of an empty lot (the Level Lot) that was owned by the Friendship Presbyterian Church.Â  Herman owned Lot A, which is located next door to the Level Lot.Â  Â Â \r\nHerman spoke to Mr. Kelleyâ€™s parents and the Kelleys observed her point in the direction of the Level Lot.Â  Herman allegedly told Mr. Kelleyâ€™s parents that this was â€œLot Aâ€ and was available for sale.Â  Herman also gave the Kelleys and Mr. Kelleyâ€™s parents a copy of a plat indicating â€œLot Aâ€ was available for sale.Â  Mr. Kelleyâ€™s parents communicated in American Sign Language with the Kelleys.Â  The Kelleys did not understand the conversation Herman had with Mr. Kelleyâ€™s parents, but his parents interpreted for them.Â  \r\nOn or about February 22, 2001, the Kelleys entered into a contract of sale with Herman to purchase land described as â€œLot A, Hickory Forest Drive, Laurens, South Carolina 29360â€ for the stated sum of $26,908.00.Â  Prior to the closing, the Kelleys paid for a survey of Lot A that was prepared on April 30, 2001.Â  The survey showed Lot A, totaling 3.99 acres, was situated on a cul-de-sac and had a creek running across the property.Â  The closing occurred on May 11, 2001.Â  In describing the property, the deed referenced the April 30, 2001 survey.Â  \r\nThe Kelleys, who had signed a contract with The Home Place for the construction of a home, visited the Level Lot numerous times and had the lot staked out and a sign installed by a representative of The Home Place indicating a home was to be built on the site.Â  Although Herman lived within view of the Level Lot, she never advised the Kelleys that they were attempting to build on the wrong lot.Â  According to the Kelleys, they first became aware they had purchased Lot A instead of the Level Lot when they tried unsuccessfully to obtain a septic tank permit after the closing.Â  They contend without a permit the land is unsuitable for building, at least at the projected cost they had anticipated.Â Â  Â Â \r\nThe Kelleys instituted this action against Herman, alleging, among other things, that she committed fraud by misleading them regarding the property that she was selling.[2]Â  The trial court granted Hermanâ€™s motion for summary judgment, finding as a matter of law that the Kelleys had not established a claim for fraud as they had no justifiable right to rely on any representations made by Herman.Â  The court observed â€œ[t]he Kelleys had a duty to read the contents of the documents before signing them and a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect themselves.â€Â  The court noted the Kelleys â€œcan read and write to some degree and Mr. Kelley is capable of comprehending drawings and blueprints, which he does in his work.â€[3]Â  Further, â€œ[t]he Kelleys had three months between the signing of the contract and the closing to review the property and plans.â€Â  Finally, the court noted the Kelleys had an interpreter at the closing and they were represented by an attorney.Â  The Kelleys appeal.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Marine Contracting &amp; Towing Co., 301 S.C. 418, 421, 392 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1990).Â  When reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002).Â  The evidence and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Kelleys contend the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Herman because there are questions of fact for a jury regarding whether Herman â€œacted fraudulently in connection with the sale of Lot A to [them]â€ and whether they had a justifiable â€œright to rely on [Hermanâ€™s] representations.â€Â  They contend Herman misled them regarding the lot she was selling because they purchased property designated as â€œLot A,â€ which is a hilly, less desirable lot arguably unsuitable for building at the price they expected, and they were led to believe they were purchasing the Level Lot.\r\nTo prove fraud, one must show, among other things, a representation and the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon.Â  First State Sav. &amp; Loan v. Phelps,&nbsp; 299 S.C. 441, 446-47, 385 S.E.2d 821, 824&nbsp;(1989).Â  â€œFraud must be proven by clear, cogent and convincing evidence.â€Â  Id. at 447, 385 S.E.2d at 824.Â  \r\nâ€œIt is well settled in this State that one cannot complain of fraud in the misrepresentation of the contents of a written instrument in his possession when the truth could have been ascertained by his reading the instrument.â€ Doub v. Weathersby-Breeland Ins. Agency,&nbsp;268 S.C. 319, 326, 233 S.E.2d 111, 114&nbsp;(1977).Â  â€œOne entering into a contract should read it and avail himself of every reasonable opportunity to understand its contents and meaning.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nâ€œA person who signs a contract or other written document cannot avoid the effect of the document by claiming he did not read it.â€Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 663, 582 S.E.2d 432, 440 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œOne who signs a written instrument has the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect himself.â€Â  Id. at 440, 582 S.E.2d at 664.Â  â€œThis rule is subject to the exception that if the party is ignorant and unwary, his failure to read the document may be excused.â€Â  Id.Â  This exception is very strictly construed, however, and â€œ[i]n determining whether a party can be classified as ignorant and unwary, an individualâ€™s education, business experience and intelligence are all considered.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe allegations of fraud made by the Kelleys rest upon the actions of Herman at the partiesâ€™ initial meeting and at two subsequent meetings.Â  First, the Kelleys argue Herman at their initial meeting â€œclearly indicated by gesturing and pointing that the Level Lot directly across from where they were parked was available for sale.â€Â  They say they were not able to read the plat Herman offered them as it was late in the afternoon, dusk, and they also have some trouble reading and writing English. Â Next, the Kelleys assert that at a meeting with Herman on February 10, 2001 to go over the sales contract, the Kelleys â€œgestured to make sure that the land was flat,â€ and Herman â€œassured us and said yes,â€ indicating the lot was flat.Â  Finally, the Kelleys contend that at the closing, they asked questions about whether the land was flat and about the creek on the property and was again assured by Herman that â€œeverything was fine, that the land was buildable, that we would be able to build on the land.â€Â  The Kelleys did not speak directly to Herman as she was in a waiting room next door during the closing, but the Kelleys had an interpreter present and relayed their questions through their attorney, who did speak to Herman.Â Â Â \r\nThe Kelleys rely on Slack v. James, 364 S.C. 609, 614 S.E.2d 636 (2005), in which our supreme court held that questions about whether a buyerâ€™s reliance on the sellersâ€™ misrepresentations was reasonable should be determined by a jury, even though the falsity of the alleged misrepresentation could have been ascertained by examining the public records.Â  In that case, the buyers were affirmatively told by the sellersâ€™ real estate agent that there were no easements on the property before entering into a sales contract.Â  Id. at 612, 614 S.E.2d at 637.Â  After executing the contract, the buyers conducted a title search and discovered a sewer easement on the property, so they refused to go forward with the closing and make the purchase.Â  Id.Â  The supreme court noted that a â€œsewer line easement is not easily discoverable without research by an expert such as an attorney.â€Â  Id. at 615, 614 S.E.2d at 639.Â  Further, because of the speed of real estate transactions, it was not expected that a title search would have been conducted prior to the execution of a sales contract, and that a jury question was created regarding whether their reliance was reasonable as the explicit assurance might have induced the buyers to refrain from discovering the true facts regarding whether there were any easements prior to entering into a contract.Â  Id. at 615-16, 614 S.E.2d at 639-40.\r\nAlthough we are sympathetic to the Kelleysâ€™ plight, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s conclusions.Â  The Kelleys could have easily ascertained the lot they were purchasing by simply reading or having explained to them the contents of the deed, plat, and other documents presented for their signature, all of which identified Lot A and described the property in detail.Â  The Kelleys had the assistance of Mr. Kelleyâ€™s parents, an interpreter, and an attorney in making their purchase.Â  Lot A, the hilly property the Kelleys actually purchased, was shown on a plat given to them as being located in a cul-de-sac, and it had a creek running across it.Â  The lot the Kelleys claim they wanted was level and was shown on the plat as being located next to Lot A.Â  It was not located on the cul-de-sac and did not have a creek running across it.Â  Â Â \r\nThere is nothing in the record indicating the Kelleys did not have the opportunity to view the lot, make a complete review of the public records, or request a detailed survey of the property before purchasing it.Â  See LoPresti v. Burry, 364 S.C. 271, 612 S.E.2d 730 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting one with knowledge of the truth or the means to acquire it by reasonable diligence cannot claim to have been misled).Â  \r\nWe have previously noted that â€œ â€˜[t]he law imputes to a purchaser of real estate notice of the recitals contained in the written instruments forming his chain of title and charges him with the duty of making such reasonable inquiry and investigation as is suggested by the recitals and references contained therein.â€™ â€ Â Id. at 276, 612 S.E.2d at 732-33 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original); see also Thomas v. Jeffcoat, 230 S.C. 126, 94 S.E.2d 240 (1956) (holding there was no jury question presented regarding fraud where a buyer claimed he relied upon representations by the sellerâ€™s agents that the property was high in front, but level, the court stating the buyer viewed the lot and if he failed to examine it as closely as he should have, it was a matter of his own volition); Reid v. Harbison Dev. Corp., 285 S.C. 557, 561, 330 S.E.2d 532, 535 (Ct. App. 1985) (stating â€œthe true test of the hearerâ€™s right to rely on misrepresentations as to matters of record is whether or not he acted with reasonable prudence in so doingâ€ (quoting 37 C.J.S. Fraud Â§ 34c (1943))).\r\nIn the current case, the plat, deed, and other documents presented to the Kelleys clearly identified the property for sale and they went forward with the closing even though three months elapsed between the execution of the sales contract and the closing. Â We find this situation distinguishable from Slack, in which the buyers discovered the falsity of a representation by checking the public records and then refused to go forward with the closing.Â  The Slack court noted the timing of real estate transactions normally prevents a detailed records search prior to the execution of a sales contract.Â  Here, in contrast, the Kelleys had time to perform a detailed investigation of the property and relevant legal documents and did not make any attempt to invalidate the agreement until sometime after the closing.Â  Based on the foregoing, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â The Kelleys also sued The Home Place, but consented to a dismissal, without prejudice, of those claims.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Mrs. Kelley can read and write and has a B.A. degree in deaf education.Â  Mr. Kelley can read, but not well, and he can write in American Sign Language; he has one year of college.Â  He reads blueprints and drawings for his job making cabinets for airplanes at a nearby airport. Â He has previously obtained loans and purchased automobiles, and he handles his own bank accounts and writes checks.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-300","title":"Michau v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In February, 2001, Emory Michau, Jr. was convicted of participating in the prostitution of a minor and sentenced to three years.Â  The State, at the completion of Michauâ€™s sentence, petitioned for a probable cause hearing pursuant to the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-10 (2002).Â  On April 9, 2003, The Honorable Victor A. Rawl found there was probable cause to believe that Michau was a sexually violent predator under the statute.Â  The circuit court ordered Michau to be held in a secure facility and to undergo a mental examination to see if he was likely to engage in sexually violent acts if released.Â  Michau refused to cooperate in the mental examination, and the commitment case was continued until Michau cooperated.\r\nOn March 30, 2004, Michau filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the Charleston County Clerk of Court.Â  In his petition, Michau asserted that he was indigent and unable to pay court fees and asked for a waiver of any fees.Â  On April 28, 2004, The Honorable R. Markley Dennis, Jr. denied Michauâ€™s petition to proceed in forma pauperis.Â  Â Michau argues this denial was in error.Â  We agree.\r\nAfter reviewing the record on appeal, we find error in the circuit courtâ€™s denial of Michauâ€™s motion to proceed in forma pauperis.Â  We base this decision on the following authorities: Ex parte Martin, 321 S.C. 533, 535, 471 S.E.2d 134, 135 (1995) (citing Smith v. Bennett, 365 U.S. 708 (1961) (an indigent prisoner may not be required to pay a filing fee for petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus)); Lakes v. State, 333 S.C. 382, 385, 510 S.E.2d 228, 230 (Ct.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Cecil Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Cornelius Keith appeals his conviction for kidnapping.Â  He argues the circuit court erred in admitting evidence of prior bad acts and in denying his motion for directed verdict.Â  We affirm.Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n    On June 13, 2003, three days after her husbandâ€™s suicide, Tammy Atkinson received a phone call from a man who identified himself as â€œMr. Pinckney.â€Â  The caller, later identified as Keith, told Atkinson he knew her husband and referred to her husbandâ€™s family members by name.Â  Keith further informed Atkinson that her husband had helped him out when he was in trouble, and now he wanted to provide financial support for her. \r\n    Keith asked Atkinson to come to his home in Sumter so that she could meet his family and be presented with a check.Â  Keith told Atkinson that he wanted to give her some financial help after her husbandâ€™s death. Atkinson went to Sumter, and after calling Keith from a convenient store as he had requested, she was invited to come across the street to his apartment.Â  Atkinson drove over to Keithâ€™s apartment and observed him standing in his doorway waving to her.\r\n    Atkinson entered the apartment and stood by the open door.Â  Keith immediately began walking in and out of rooms in the apartment as he asked Atkinson questions regarding her knowledge of other local families.Â  Atkinson could hear Keith opening and closing drawers in another room, and she walked away from the open door into the apartment in an attempt to see him.Â  When Atkinson turned back around to face the open door, she observed Keith close and lock the door.Â  Atkinson immediately announced, â€œIâ€™m out of here,â€ rushed to the door which she unlocked and opened, and exited the apartment. \r\n    Keith never threatened Atkinson or told her she could not leave.Â  Atkinson admitted that Keith was close enough to grab her when she was opening the door and exiting the apartment, but he never attempted to grab her or hinder her ability to leave.Â  Keith never made any physical contact with Atkinson, and after she exited the apartment, he stood in the doorway and told her he would call her later.\r\n    Atkinson drove to the police station and reported what had happened.Â  The police provided Atkinson with a photo line-up and she picked out Keith as the man she had just seen.[1]Â  The police then drove to Keithâ€™s apartment and placed him under arrest.\r\n    After transporting Keith to the police station, the police attained a search warrant for his apartment. Â The police executed the warrant and found a notebook in a dresser drawer.Â  In the notebook were written entries containing names and ages of deceased men and contact information for their family members.Â  The police were later able to match the information in the notebook with newspaper obituaries found in Keithâ€™s apartment which contained the same information.Â  Additionally, the police found a newspaper in the trash that contained Atkinsonâ€™s husbandâ€™s obituary. \r\n    At trial, the State produced two witnesses to testify regarding phone calls they had received from a man who identified himself as â€œMr. Pinckney.â€Â  At the time of the phone calls, both witnesses were recently widowed, and they were each listed in entries written in the notebook found in Keithâ€™s apartment.Â  The two women testified that the caller told them he knew their husbands and that he wanted to help them financially.Â  Neither woman ever agreed to the callerâ€™s request to meet nor did they ever receive a check from him.\r\n    A Sumter County grand jury indicted Keith on a single count of statutory kidnapping by inveiglement or decoy.Â  After trial, the jury convicted Keith of kidnapping, and the trial court sentenced him to ten years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n      I.Â  Admission of Evidence\r\n        Keith contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence of prior bad acts in violation of State v. Lyle[2] and Rules 403 and 404(b), SCRE.Â  We disagree.\r\n        In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  On appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  State v. Bowie, 360 S.C. 210, 216, 600 S.E.2d 112, 115 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 621, 582 S.E.2d 426, 429 (2003).Â  This Court does not reassess the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether any evidence supports the trial judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.\r\n        A.Â  Rule 404(b)\r\n        South Carolina Rule of Evidence 404(b) states:Â  \r\n\r\n        Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.\r\n\r\n        We note that Rule 404(b), SCRE, differs from the federal rule of evidence.Â  â€œ[U]nlike the federal rule, which does not limit the purposes for which evidence of other crimes may be admitted, the South Carolina rule limits the use of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts to those enumerated in State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).â€Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE, Advisory Committee Notes.Â  This incorporation of Lyle into the South Carolina rule renders differentiation between a prior bad actâ€™s admissibility under Lyle and its admissibility under Rule 404(b), SCRE, unnecessary to our analysis.\r\n        The State presented two witnesses who testified that they had received phone calls that were virtually identical to the call Atkinson received from Keith.Â  Keith objected to the admission of this testimony as inadmissible prior bad acts.Â Â  The State maintained it was entering the evidence to show Keithâ€™s common plan or scheme. \r\n        To determine the admissibility of evidence to show a common plan or scheme by the defendant, the court must determine â€œwhether the particular conduct circumstantially tends to prove the design or plan.â€Â  State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 28, 393 S.E.2d 364, 370 (1990).Â Â Â Â  The connection between the prior bad act and the crime being tried must be more than just a general similarity.Â  State v. Cutro, 332 S.C. 100, 103, 504 S.E.2d 324, 325 (1998).Â  â€œThe acid test of admissibility is the logical relevancy of the other crimes.â€Â  Id.\r\n        In his analysis of this issue, the trial judge compiled a spreadsheet to illustrate the connection between Keithâ€™s prior bad acts and the alleged kidnapping.Â  The link between the phone calls made to the two testifying widows and the phone call made to Atkinson can be seen: all three calls came within days of the deaths of the womenâ€™s husbands; in each case the caller identified himself either as â€œMr. Pinckneyâ€ or a relative of Bill Pinckney; the reason given for each of the calls was to offer financial support to the widow; and during each call, the caller attempted to set up a meeting with the widow.Â  The trial judge effectively illustrated the connection between the phone calls in terms of the time of the call, the identity of the caller, the reason for the call, and the request for a meeting.Â  We find this evidence provides a sufficient connection between the prior bad acts and the current crime and circumstantially tends to prove a common plan or scheme.\r\n        Establishing a sufficient connection between the prior bad acts and the current crime does not end our analysis.Â  â€œTo be admissible, proof of prior bad acts must be clear and convincing.â€Â  State v. Smith, 300 S.C. 216, 218, 387 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1989).Â  However, our standard of review on appeal of these matters is limited.\r\n\r\n        [W]e do not review a trial judgeâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of other bad acts by determining de novo whether the evidence rises to the level of clear and convincing.Â  If there is any evidence to support the admission of the bad act evidence, the trial judgeâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.\r\n\r\n        State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).\r\n        There is certainly some circumstantial evidence in the record on which the trial judge could have based his decision.Â  Under this â€œany evidenceâ€ standard, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s admission of this testimony regarding prior bad acts.\r\n         B.Â  Rule 403, SCRE\r\n        Keith further contends the above noted testimony and the notebook found in the search of his home should have been excluded under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  We disagree.\r\n        South Carolina Rule of Evidence 403 states: â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.â€\r\n        Prejudice must be determined based on the entire record and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 7, 545 S.E.2d at 830.Â  A trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances.Â  State v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 81, 606 S.E.2d 215, 220 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œWe review a trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding\r\n        Rule 403 pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard and are obligated to give great deference to the trial courtâ€™s judgment.â€Â  State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 569, 598 S.E.2d 279, 286 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n        In light of the Stateâ€™s reliance on circumstantial evidence to prove decoy or inveiglement, we find the witnessesâ€™ testimony and the notebook to be especially probative.Â  We do not find that exceptional circumstances exist to reverse the trial courtâ€™s admission of the testimony or the notebook.Â  We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court because this evidence was more probative than it was prejudicial.Â  \r\n        II.Â  Directed Verdict\r\n        Keith contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict.Â  Keith maintains that he neither kidnapped Atkinson, nor committed any illegal act.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n        When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 593, 606 S.E.2d 475, 477-78 (2004).Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the state.Â  State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999). If there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 593-94, 606 S.E.2d at 478. See State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002) (on an appeal from trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion for a directed verdict, appellate court may only reverse the trial court if there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling).\r\n        South Carolinaâ€™s kidnapping statute requires proof of an unlawful act taking one of several alternative forms, including seizure, confinement, inveiglement, decoy, kidnapping, abduction, or carrying away.Â  State v. East, 353 S.C. 634, 637, 578 S.E.2d 748, 750 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Section 16-3-910 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) states:\r\n\r\n        Whoever shall unlawfully seize, confine, inveigle, decoy, kidnap, abduct or carry away any other person by any means whatsoever without authority of law, except when a minor is seized or taken by his parent, is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned for a period not to exceed thirty years unless sentenced for murder as provided in Section 16-3-20. \r\n\r\n        Under the interpretation of the statute set out in East, the act of inveigling or decoying alone satisfy the unlawful act requirement for proof of statutory kidnapping.Â  Inveigling has been defined as â€œenticing, cajoling, or tempting the victim, usually through some deceitful means such as false promises,â€ and decoy is defined as â€œto lure successfully.â€Â  State v. Stokes, 345 S.C. 368, 373, 548 S.E.2d 202, 204 (2001) (citing United States v. Macklin, 671 F.2d 60, 66 (2d Cir. 1982) and New Websterâ€™s Dictionary and Thesaurus 250 (1993)).\r\n        In this case, the State presented evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to find Keith inveigled or decoyed Atkinson into traveling to and entering his apartment.Â  The State presented Atkinsonâ€™s testimony of the events surrounding her phone conversation and meeting with Keith and the testimony of two other witnesses who had received virtually identical phone calls.Â  None of the women ever received any financial assistance.Â  Also, the State presented the notebook found in Keithâ€™s apartment that contained information about several deceased men and their families.Â  Thus, we find sufficient evidence was presented to support a finding of inveigling or decoy.Â Â Â Â  \r\n        In addition to proving a defendant has violated the kidnapping statute, the State has the burden of proving that the statute was violated knowingly. State v. Jefferies, 316 S.C. 13, 19, 446 S.E.2d 427, 430-31 (1994).Â  There was certainly some circumstantial evidence in the form of the testimony regarding previous phone calls to other women and the notebook found in Keithâ€™s home that could reasonably show Keith knew he was inveigling or decoying Atkinson.\r\n        In response, Keith argues that Atkinson came to his home voluntarily.Â  However, the fact that one is inveigled or decoyed into going somewhere negates, in legal contemplation, the voluntariness of his or her participation.Â  Stokes, 345 S.C. at 373, 548 S.E.2d at 204.Â  If Keith lured Atkinson to his home under the false pretense that she was to receive financial assistance, then her voluntariness would be negated. Â Furthermore, the fact that Keith locked the door after Atkinson entered his apartment casts doubt on his claim that she was there voluntarily. Â Â \r\n        In summary, Keithâ€™s alleged actions of luring Atkinson to his home under false pretenses qualifies as inveiglement or decoy and negates her voluntariness.Â  The inveiglement or decoy alone has been interpreted as meeting the necessary requirement of an unlawful act, and there was some circumstantial evidence to submit to the jury that could show Keith knowingly inveigled or decoyed Atkinson.Â  Therefore, we find there was evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s denial of Keithâ€™s directed verdict motion.\r\n        AFFIRMED.\r\n        BEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The police had a photo of Keith on file because of his prior criminal conduct.Â  Keith has an extensive criminal record including a 2002 conviction for criminal sexual conduct in the third degree.\r\n[2] State v.

Dunlaevy, all of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  In this employment dispute, Richard Erwin appeals the trial courtâ€™s order compelling arbitration between Erwin and Ryanâ€™s Family Steakhouses, Inc. (Ryanâ€™s).Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1980, Erwin began working at Ryanâ€™s.Â  In 1992, Ryanâ€™s implemented an arbitration program through Employment Dispute Services, Inc. (EDSI), a third-party arbitration service provider.Â  After Ryanâ€™s implemented the arbitration program, it required all new employees sign an arbitration agreement with EDSI; a signatory of this agreement assented to arbitrate all employment disputes with Ryanâ€™s in an EDSI forum dictated by EDSI rules and procedures.Â  Ryanâ€™s afforded all current Ryanâ€™s employees the option of signing the arbitration agreement, and Erwin opted not to sign it.Â  \r\nIn August 2001, Erwin entered into a Regional Partnership Agreement (Agreement) with Ryanâ€™s.Â  The Agreementâ€™s purpose was to â€œarrange an independent compensation method in which both [Erwin] and Ryanâ€™s have the opportunity to benefit as a result of the financial improvement of the restaurants which are supervised by [Erwin].â€Â  In addition to base salary, Erwin would earn a percentage of the profits made by the restaurants he supervised.Â  The Agreement contained an arbitration clause, which provided:\r\n\r\nARBITRATION.Â  Ryanâ€™s and [Erwin] agree that their relationship remains that of employer and employee.Â  Any employment related dispute must be resolved through the use of Ryanâ€™s previously established arbitration system.\r\n\r\nOn October 17, 2003, Ryanâ€™s terminated Erwin and cancelled the Agreement.Â  \r\nTwo months later, Erwin sued Ryanâ€™s for inter alia wrongful termination and breach of contract.Â  Ryanâ€™s moved to compel arbitration based on the Agreementâ€™s arbitration clause.Â  The trial court compelled arbitration but questioned whether Erwin agreed to arbitrate under the EDSI program.Â  Therefore, the court decided Erwin and Ryanâ€™s should select arbitration panel members in accordance with section 15-48-30 of the South Carolina Code (2005) rather than the EDSI program.[1]Â  The parties selected an arbitration panel (â€œPanelâ€), which heard Erwinâ€™s case in March 2005.Â  Â \r\nTwo months later, the Panel issued an arbitration award in favor of Ryanâ€™s.Â  Ryanâ€™s then moved the trial court to confirm the arbitration award, which the trial court granted.Â  Erwin appeals this ruling.[2]  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nErwin argues the trial court erred in granting Ryanâ€™s motion to compel arbitration.Â  We agree. \r\nWhether a claim is subject to arbitration is a matter of judicial determination, unless the parties stipulate otherwise.Â  Chassereau v. Global-Sun Pools, Inc., 363 S.C. 628, 631, 611 S.E.2d 305, 307 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œThere is a strong presumption in favor of the validity of arbitration agreements because of the strong policy favoring arbitration.â€Â  Towles v. United HealthCare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 37, 524 S.E.2d 839, 844 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The trial court should determine whether an arbitration agreement exists between the parties before determining whether the case should be arbitrated.Â  Hous. Auth. of the City of Columbia v. Cornerstone Hous., LLC, 356 S.C. 328, 334, 588 S.E.2d 617, 620 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  This determination is a matter to be â€œforthwith and summarily triedâ€ by the trial court.Â  Jackson Mills, Inc. v. BT Capital Corp., 312 S.C. 400, 404, 440 S.E.2d 877, 879 (1994).Â  \r\nThe trial court should apply ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts in evaluating whether an arbitration agreement exists.Â  Cornerstone Hous., 356 S.C. at 335, 588 S.E.2d at 621.Â  In construing a contract, the trial court should not look beyond the four corners of the contract if the text is free of ambiguity.Â  Barnacle Broad., Inc. v. Baker Broad., Inc., 343 S.C. 140, 146-47, 538 S.E.2d 672, 675 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In such a case, as a matter of law, the trial court should enforce the contact as written.Â  Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 568, 561 S.E.2d 355, 359 (2002).Â  It is black-letter law that the formation of a contract requires a â€œmeeting of the minds between the parties with regard to all essential and material terms of the agreement.â€Â  Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1989); Gaskins v. Blue Cross-Blue Shield of S.C., 271 S.C. 101, 105, 245 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1978).\r\nErwin contends he and Ryanâ€™s did not agree to arbitrate.Â  The crux of this dispute is the Agreementâ€™s arbitration clause, which provides, â€œ[a]ny employment related dispute must be resolved through the use of Ryanâ€™s previously established arbitration system.â€Â  Both parties concede the â€œpreviously established arbitration systemâ€ is the EDSI arbitration program implemented in 1992.Â  There are no other signed documents concerning arbitration between the parties.Â  Therefore, if Erwin and Ryanâ€™s agreed to arbitrate Erwinâ€™s employment related claims, they necessarily agreed to arbitrate them under the EDSI program.Â  Thus, the parties either agreed to arbitrate under the EDSI program, or they did not agree to arbitrate.Â  The arbitration clause offers no alternative.Â Â  \r\nWe conclude it was error for the trial judge to order arbitration under the South Carolina statutory scheme.Â  Section 15-48-10 of the South Carolina Code (2005) specifically states that the arbitration method described in Section 15-48-30 will â€œnot apply to . . . (2) Arbitration agreements between employers and employees . . . unless the agreement provides that this chapter shall apply.â€Â  Because the arbitration clause did not reference Section 15-48-30, the court clearly erred by ordering arbitration pursuant to the statutory scheme.\r\nThe trial court found the parties executed an arbitration agreement covering the dispute in question, but also that â€œit is not clear . . . Richard Erwin agreed to arbitration under Ryanâ€™s EDSI arbitration plan.â€Â  The nature of the Agreementâ€™s arbitration clause dictates a finding that either (1) the parties agreed to arbitrate under the EDSI system or (2) the parties did not agree to arbitrate.Â  The trial judge essentially found an agreement to arbitrate, but no clear agreement to use the EDSI system. Â These two findings are diametrically opposed.Â  \r\nConsequently, the trial court erred in granting Ryanâ€™s motion to compel arbitration.Â  Accordingly, we reverse and remand to determine whether Erwin and Ryanâ€™s agreed to arbitrate under the EDSI arbitration program as provided by the Agreementâ€™s arbitration clause.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order is \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.[3] \r\nSHORT, J., concurs.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part:\r\nI concur in part and dissent in part.Â  The trial court held the Agreement clearly and unambiguously compels arbitration.Â  I agree with the experienced trial judge and respectfully dissent from the majority opinion in this regard.Â  In my view, the error occurred only in the method of arbitration.Â  The parties clearly agreed to arbitrate under EDSI.Â  Ordering arbitration under section 15-48-10 of the South Carolina Code (2005) was inappropriate for the reasons set forth in the majority opinion.Â  Accordingly, I would remand for a determination of whether Erwin was prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s erroneous selection of the statutory arbitration method.Â  If the court finds prejudice resulted from this error, the court would then order arbitration as agreed by the parties under EDSI.Â  If the error did not prejudice Erwin, then the underlying judgment should stand affirmed.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Section 15-48-30 of the South Carolina Code provides that the three-member arbitration panel should be comprised of one arbitrator â€œchosen by the party making the demand for arbitration, one chosen by the party against whom demand is made and [the] third being chosen by those two chosen by the parties.â€Â  The EDSI program provides that a three-member arbitration panel should be comprised of one employer, one employee, and one attorney, retired judge, â€œor other competent legal professional not associated with either party.â€Â  \r\n[2]Â  Erwin also moved to vacate the arbitration award, which he did on the same day the trial court confirmed the award.Â  \r\n[3] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-303","title":"State v.

Goldsmith, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-303\r\nHeard June 6, 2006 â€“ Filed June 30, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAlexandre Thomas Postic and Melissa Jane Reed Kimbrough, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Timothy Dinkins appeals his conviction for drug trafficking.Â  He asserts the trial judge erred in failing to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a defective search warrant and in refusing to provide the jury with an additional charge on actual knowledge.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 15, 2002, Narcotics Agent John Lutz received a tip from a first-time confidential informant about suspected drug activity conducted by Dinkins in a Richland County apartment.Â  The informant indicated he had verbal confirmation from Dinkins that Dinkins had a large amount of cocaine in his possession and that he had sold some.Â  The informant also provided information regarding the type of vehicle or vehicles Dinkins used.Â  Based upon that tip, Lutz set up surveillance of the apartment.Â  Later that day, Lutz and another narcotics agent watched Dinkins drive up to the apartment in a vehicle fitting the description provided by the informant, drop off some dry-cleaning, and depart. Â According to Lutz, Dinkins was then observed traveling on Interstate 20 at a high rate of speed.Â  Dinkins was stopped by another police officer for the traffic offense, and Lutz, who had been surveilling Dinkins, arrived shortly thereafter. Â At the traffic stop, Lutz asked Dinkins where he lived.Â  Dinkins told Lutz he lived in Bishopville and did not mention the apartment.Â  \r\nAfter the traffic stop, Lutz submitted to the magistrate an affidavit in support of a search warrant for the apartment.Â  The affidavit included the informantâ€™s tip and police officersâ€™ confirmation of Dinkinsâ€™ residence and the cars he might be driving.Â  The affidavit also contained Dinkinsâ€™ criminal record, which included prior convictions for illegal drug possession, and the fact that, according to Lutz, Dinkins lied about where he lived and his activities immediately prior to the traffic stop.Â  Based on Lutzâ€™s affidavit, the magistrate issued a search warrant for the apartment.Â  Lutz executed the search warrant and found a large quantity of cocaine in the apartmentâ€™s laundry room closet.Â  \r\nBefore opening statements, Dinkins moved to suppress the cocaine alleging the search warrant lacked probable cause. Â The trial judge denied the motion, finding probable cause supported issuance of the search warrant.Â  After the presentation of all evidence, the judge submitted the case to the jury.Â  During deliberations, the jury asked the trial judge whether proof of knowledge was required to convict Dinkins of trafficking.Â  At that time, Dinkins requested an additional charge on actual knowledge, which the State contested.Â  The trial judge did not provide this additional charge, but sent his written instructions to the jury room.Â  \r\nThe jury convicted Dinkins of drug trafficking, and the judge sentenced him to twenty-seven years imprisonment.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDinkins raises two issues on appeal:Â  (1) whether the trial judge erred in denying Dinkinsâ€™ motion to suppress drug evidence recovered pursuant to a defective search warrant; and (2) whether the trial judge erred in refusing to provide the jury with an additional charge on actual knowledge. \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Motion to Suppress \r\nDinkins argues the search warrant is defective for lack of probable cause.Â  We disagree.[1]Â  \r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court sits only to review errors of law. State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  â€œIn an appeal from a motion to suppress evidence based on Fourth Amendment grounds, an appellate court may conduct its own review of the record to determine whether the evidence supports the circuit courtâ€™s decision.â€Â  State v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 349-50, 592 S.E.2d 344, 347 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nA search warrant may be issued only upon a finding of probable cause.Â  State v. Bellamy, 336 S.C. 140, 143, 519 S.E.2d 347, 348 (1999).Â  An appellate court reviewing the magistrateâ€™s decision to issue a search warrant determines whether the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding probable cause existed.Â  State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 291, 494 S.E.2d 801, 803 (1997); State v. Dupree, 354 S.C. 676, 683, 583 S.E.2d 437, 441 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œThis review, like the determination by the magistrate, is governed by the â€˜totality of the circumstancesâ€™ test.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe task of a magistrate in determining whether to issue a warrant is to make a practical, common sense decision as to whether, under the totality of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, there is a fair probability that evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.Â  Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983); State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 50, 625 S.E.2d 216, 221 (2006).Â  This decision includes consideration of the veracity of the person supplying the information and the basis of his or her knowledge. Â Id. Â The affidavit must contain sufficient underlying facts and information upon which the magistrate may make a determination of probable cause.Â  State v. Smith, 301 S.C. 371, 373, 392 S.E.2d 182, 183 (1990); State v. Philpot, 317 S.C. 458, 461, 454 S.E.2d 905, 907 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\nWe believe, under the totality of the circumstances, the search warrant was properly issued.Â  First, Lutzâ€™s affidavit presented the magistrate with the informantâ€™s tip that Dinkins was â€œa major supplier of crack cocaineâ€ who manufactured crack at the apartment.Â  Furthermore, it indicated that the vehicle information provided by the informant was corroborated by police surveillance.Â  Second, the affidavit referenced Dinkinsâ€™ prior convictions for illegal drug possession, including possession of crack cocaine and possession with intent to distribute marijuana.Â  See U.S. v. Melvin, 419 F.2d 136, 141 (D.S.C. 1969) (holding that evidence of prior convictions of similar crimes should be afforded some weight in a probable cause determination although standing alone such convictions may not sustain a warrant).Â  Third, the affidavit indicated that Dinkins lied to Lutz about his residence and his activities prior to the traffic stop.Â  \r\nWe recognize the tip in this case came from a first-time informant.Â  Typically, when seeking a warrant based on information from an informant, there is a recitation that the informant is deemed reliable.Â  Obviously, that is not possible in the case of a first-time informant.Â  However, here, as a result of the information provided, surveillance of the apartment revealed that at least a portion of the information was accurate.Â  Additionally, the information from the informant was just one of numerous factors that, taken together, support a finding of probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant for the apartment.Â  We therefore find the magistrate did not err in issuing the search warrant, nor did the trial judge in refusing to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of its execution.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Jury Charge\r\nDinkins argues the trial judge erred in refusing to make an additional charge on actual knowledge.Â  We disagree. \r\nAn appellate court will not reverse the trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding jury instructions absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.Â  Jury instructions must be read in light of the entire charge and the facts of the case.Â  Cole v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas, Inc., 355 S.C. 183, 191, 584 S.E.2d 405, 410 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If the charge as a whole is reasonably free from error, isolated portions of the charge that might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.Â  Id.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury instruction must be both erroneous and prejudicial to warrant reversal.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 303 (2002). \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Â§ 44-53-370(c) (2002) provides:\r\n  \r\nIt shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance unless the substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to a valid prescription or order of, a practitioner while acting in the course of his professional practice, or except as otherwise authorized by this article.\r\n  \r\n\r\nPossession may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence, and it may be actual or constructive.Â  State v. Mollison, 319 S.C. 41, 45, 459 S.E.2d 88, 91 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œActual possession occurs when the drugs are found to be in the actual physical custody of the person.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œConstructive possession occurs when the person charged with possession has dominion and control over either the drugs or the premises upon which the drugs were found.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial judge charged the jury as follows:\r\n  \r\n[Y]ou must determine if the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was knowingly in actual or constructive possession of 400 grams or more of cocaine . . . .Â  I will now define to you certain terms.Â  Knowingly is defined as with knowledge, consciously, or willfully.Â  Actual or constructive possession.Â  Proof of possession requires more than proof of mere presence at the place where the thing allegedly possessed is found.Â  The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had both[,] one, the power, that is the actual or constructive control; and, two, the intent to control its disposition or use. . . .Â  Constructive control occurs when the person charged with possession has dominion and control over either the object or the premises upon which it is found.Â  It is enough for constructive control that the accused has the right to exercise dominion and control over the thing allegedly possessed. . . .Â  Each element of the offense must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find this defendant guilty of the crime charged.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter the judge issued this charge, the jury deliberated.Â  Before rendering a verdict, however, the jury asked the judge the following question: Â â€œIs any proof of knowledge required?â€Â  \r\nAt this juncture, Dinkins requested the trial judge give the jury an additional charge on actual possession.Â  The trial judge refused, but provided the jury a written version of his instructions.Â  In light of the fact that the written instructions clearly indicate knowledge is an element of trafficking that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, as well as the propriety of the jury charge as whole, the judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to give the jury an additional charge on actual knowledge.Â  Accordingly, the trial judgeâ€™s order is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  As an initial matter, there is some question whether this issue is preserved for appeal.Â  Although Dinkins objected to the introduction of the drug evidence before trial, he did not make a contemporaneous objection to the introduction of the drug evidence at trial.Â  â€œHowever, where a judge makes a ruling on the admission of evidence on the record immediately prior to the introduction of the evidence in question, the aggrieved party does not need to renew the objection.â€Â  State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 642, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001).Â  The evidence sought to be excluded was brought in through the Stateâ€™s first witness and the only evidence introduced prior to the admission of the cocaine was photographs of the apartment and the various related drug paraphernalia contained therein.Â  Because Dinkinsâ€™ objection was arguably preserved, we address the merits of his appeal.

Varnado, both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  This case involves negligence and breach of warranty claims by a homeowner, John Bethards, against Mike Tenny d/b/a Synco Enterprises (Synco), a contractor, and Weather Shield Manufacturing, a window manufacturer.Â  The trial court judge granted a directed verdict in favor of Synco and Weather Shield on Bethardsâ€™ claims for negligence and breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.Â  A jury found for Weather Shield on the remaining breach of the implied warranty of merchantability claim.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBethards hired an architect, Thomas Smith (Architect), and a general contractor, Jeff Thomas d/b/a Thomas Construction, to design and build a home in Isle of Palms, South Carolina.Â  Part of Bethardsâ€™ contract with Architect included site visits by Architect to the home.Â  \r\nBethardsâ€™ home was built using an Exterior Insulation Finish System (EIFS) (synthetic stucco), which Synco allegedly installed. Â The windows and sliding glass doors for the home were manufactured by Weather Shield and bought at Southern Lumber and Millwork Corp.Â  (Southern Lumber). Â \r\nBethards testified he began experiencing problems with the sliding doors soon after he moved into the home in 1996.Â  At Bethardsâ€™ request, Thomas Construction contacted Southern Lumber about the problems.Â  Bethards testified that either a Southern Lumber or a Weather Shield representative went to the home and repaired the sliding doors using parts Weather Shield apparently sent to Southern Lumber.Â  Bethards claims when the representative left, the sliding glass doors were in working order and he did not experience problems with them again until 2001.Â  The representative only examined the sliding doors; he did not have any interaction with the windows.Â  \r\nIn 1999, the home was damaged by Hurricane Floyd.Â  Bethards submitted a claim to his insurance company for the damage.Â  The insurance company sent an engineer to the house to assess the damages, and he determined two windows were damaged by the hurricane but a third was likely damaged by someone trying to open the window without unlocking it.Â  The engineer also pointed out a water stain in the second floor sunroom that was unrelated to the hurricane.Â  \r\nIn 2000, after hearing of some problems in the area with stucco, Bethards became concerned about the EIFS on his home.Â  In 2002, Bethards had his home inspected by a professional engineer who determined that the EIFS on the home had failed.Â  His engineer also determined the home had roof leaks and improperly installed flashing at the roof and around the windows and doors.Â  All of these factors and the hurricane led to water damage in the home.Â  \r\nIn 2001, Bethards began experiencing the same problems with the sliding doors as he had in 1997.Â  He testified the sliding doors leaked when it rained and caused water damage and electrical problems.Â  He also testified that the locks on the sliding doors rusted and could not be locked.Â  \r\nIn 2001, Bethards brought suit against Parex, Inc. (the EIFS manufacturer), Thomas, Synco, and Charleston Gypsum (the EIFS supplier).Â  In April 2003, Bethards added Weather Shield as a defendant.Â  Bethards did not perfect service on Thomas and settled with Parex and Charleston Gypsum before trial began.Â  Bethards sued Synco and Weather Shield for negligence and Weather Shield for breach of implied warranty.Â  The trial court granted directed verdicts for Synco and Weather Shield on Bethardsâ€™ negligence claims on the grounds that the statute of limitations barred the claims.Â  The trial court also granted a directed verdict to Weather Shield on Bethardsâ€™ claim of breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.Â  The trial court denied Bethardsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict on his remaining claim of breach of implied warranty of merchantability but found the evidence presented at trial created a jury question.Â  The jury found Weather Shield did not breach the implied warranty of merchantability.Â  Bethards appeals.\r\nI.Â  Claims Against Synco\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statute of Limitations \r\nBethards claims the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of Synco because the statute of limitations barred the action.Â  Specifically, Bethards contends the trial court erred in finding Architect knew or should have known of the defective EIFS application and in imputing Architectâ€™s knowledge of the defective installation to Bethards.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhen ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Â Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  â€œThe trial court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â \r\nSabb, 350 S.C. at 427, 567 S.E.2d at 236.Â  Neither the trial court nor this court has the authority to decide credibility issues or resolve conflicts in testimony.Â  Garrett v. Locke, 309 S.C. 94, 99, 419 S.E.2d 842, 845 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œIn ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its weight.â€Â \r\nState v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2002).Â  This court must follow the same standard.Â  Adams v. G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995).\r\nThe statute of limitations for a negligence action is three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (2005).Â  According to the\r\ndiscovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when a cause of action reasonably ought to have been discovered.Â Â  Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996). The statute runs from the date the injured party either knows or should have known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises from the wrongful conduct.Â  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 719, 511 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œThe date on which discovery of the cause of action should have been made is an objective, rather than subjective, question.â€Â  Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp.,&nbsp; 344 S.C. 115, 123, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  In other words, whether Bethards actually knew he had a claim is not the test. â€œRather, [we] must decide whether the circumstances of the case would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded, or that some claim against another party might exist.â€Â  Id. (quoting Young, 333 S.C. at 719, 511 S.E.2d at 416).\r\nAt trial, Bethards presented the testimony of three experts, Ken Schneider, an architect, Robert Sisnroy, an engineer, and Tom Carlson, a general contractor, who all testified that the EIFS was improperly installed.Â  Each asserted that the installer had failed to leave an engineered sealant joint and that failure was a breach of a duty of care.Â  Schneider testified that an architect could tell by looking at the house that the EIFS system is not in compliance with the manufacturerâ€™s specifications and that the joint is inadequate.Â  Schneider also asserted that a prudent architect should have observed the defective installation during construction and informed the homeowner so the problem could be corrected.Â  \r\nBecause the only evidence presented was that the improper installation of the EIFS system was open and obvious during the construction of the home, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s finding that the architect, Smith, knew or should have known of the defective workmanship when the home was completed in 1996.Â  Additionally, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s decision to impute Architectâ€™s knowledge to Bethards.Â  \r\nâ€œIt has been held that an architect, in the performance of his supervisory functions with respect to a building under construction, ordinarily acts as the agent and representative of the person for whom the work is being done.â€Â \r\nHines v. Farr, 235 S.C. 436, 443, 112 S.E.2d 33, 37 (1960).Â  â€œIt is well established that a principal is affected with constructive knowledge of all material facts of which his agent receives notice while acting within the scope of his authority.â€Â \r\nCrystal Ice Co. of Columbia v. First Colonial Corp., 273 S.C. 306, 309, 257 S.E.2d 496, 497 (1979).\r\n\r\nBethards argues that the trial court had no basis, under agency principles, to impute the knowledge of Architect to him because there is no evidence that the architect actually visited the home after the EIFS system was installed.Â  However, Bethards admitted he contracted with Architect to periodically visit the site during construction to ensure the house was being built properly, and Bethards never asserted at trial that Architect failed to inspect the home.Â  Bethards testified as follows:\r\nAttorney:Â  And I believe you said you hired Tommy Smith during the course of construction to watch over and inspect the construction of the home; is that correct?\r\nBethards:Â  Yeah.Â  I also asked my architect toâ€”because of my schedule flying with the Air Force, flying for United, being gone a lot, I asked him toâ€”and contracted with him to visit the home and ensure that the construction was going according to plan. \r\nAttorney:Â  And, did, in fact, he do that for you?\r\nBethards:Â  To the best of my knowledge, he did.Â  I did pay him to do that and he did write reports that showed he visited or, at least, the reports said he visited and the problems he found.Â Â  \r\n\r\nBecause Architect had a duty to inspect the work being done on the home during construction, he was Bethardsâ€™ agent, and his constructive knowledge is imputable to Bethards.Â  Therefore, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling. \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judicial and Equitable Estoppel \r\nBethards also argues Synco should be judicially estopped from asserting the two inconsistent defenses that the statute of limitations had run on Bethardsâ€™ claim and that the EIFS system was installed according to industry standards.Â  However, Bethards never made this argument to the trial court, and raises it for the first time on appeal.Â  â€œ[A]n issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  Therefore, we find this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nII.Â  Claims against Weather Shield\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Directed Verdict \r\nBethards argues the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict in favor of Weather Shield on his negligence claim because the statute of limitations barred the action.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs stated above, the statute of limitations for a negligence action is three years, and this court will apply the discovery rule to determine when the statute began to run.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (2005).Â  Under the discovery rule, the statutory limitations period begins to run from the date when the injury resulting from the wrongful conduct either is discovered or may be discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence, not when the plaintiff develops a full-blown theory of recovery.Â  Cline v. J.E. Faulkner Homes, Inc., 359 S.C. 367, 371-72, 597 S.E.2d 27, 29 (Ct. App. 2004); Tanyel v. Osborne, 312 S.C. 473, 475, 441 S.E.2d 329, 330 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nIn November 1999, the engineer the insurance company sent to Bethardsâ€™ home after Hurricane Floyd informed him that at least one of the water stains he listed on his insurance claim was not caused by the hurricane.Â  The trial court was correct in determining that this was enough to put Bethards on notice that he may have a claim against an unknown party.Â  However, Bethards did not add Weather Shield to this action until 2003, after three years had passed.Â  Accordingly, the trial court correctly determined the statute of limitations barred Bethardsâ€™ negligence claim against Weather Shield.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Judicial and Equitable Estoppel \r\nBethards contends that Weather Shield should be judicially and equitably estopped from asserting the two inconsistent defenses that he should have known of the windowsâ€™ defects in 1999 and that the windows were not defective.Â  This argument is not preserved for our review because it was not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court. Â Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appeal).Â  \r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; New Trial \r\nBethards claims the trial courtâ€™s legal and evidentiary errors entitle him to a new trial.Â  Bethards contends the trial court erred by: (1) admitting evidence concerning the value of the home; (2) allowing the testimony of an undisclosed expert witness; and (3) failing to charge the jury as he requested.Â  Additionally, Bethards argues he should be granted a new trial because the trial courtâ€™s erroneous directed verdict for Tenny was prejudicial to his remaining claim against Weather Shield.Â Â  \r\nâ€œIn determining whether the judge erred in denying a motion for a new trial, we must look at the testimony and inferences raised therefrom in favor of the nonmoving party.â€Â \r\nHolroyd v. Requa, 361 S.C. 43, 52, 603 S.E.2d 417, 422 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 302-03, 536 S.E.2d 408, 420 (Ct. App. 2000)).Â  \r\n 1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Home Value\r\nBethards argues the trial court erred in allowing Weather Shield to introduce evidence regarding the value of his home.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion. Â Brooks v. Brooks, 288 S.C. 71, 73, 339 S.E.2d 531, 532 (Ct. App. 1986). Â â€œTo warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., that there is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack thereof.â€Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005) (citations omitted).Â  Additionally, â€œas a settled principle of law, the admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely cumulative of other evidence.â€Â  Ramos v. Hawley, 316 S.C. 534, 537, 451 S.E.2d 27, 28 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nBethards asserts the testimony on the value of his home was prejudicial to him because â€œit implied that Bethards was very wealthy and therefore would not need to be compensated for the damages on his home as it appeared that he could afford to pay â€˜out of pocketâ€™ for the expenses in fixing his home.â€Â  Assuming, without so finding, the trial court erred in allowing Weather Shield to elicit information about the value of his home, Bethards cannot show the testimony was prejudicial.Â  Bethards testified regarding the rental rate of his home, his mortgage, and introduced photographs of the home.Â  Therefore, the testimony was cumulative because Bethards introduced evidence that implied he was wealthy and could have led the jurors to the same conclusion.\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expert Witness Testimony \r\nBethards argues the trial court erred in allowing Philip Drake to testify as an expert witness because Weather Shield did not disclose him before trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe qualification of an expert witness and the admissibility of the expertâ€™s testimony are matters within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion, and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â Fields, 628 S.C. at 25, 609 S.E.2d at 509.Â  â€œWhere a party fails timely to disclose the identity of an expert witness, the question of whether the witnessâ€™ testimony may be received in evidence is left largely to the discretion of the trial judge.â€Â  Tribble v. Hentz 285 S.C. 616, 618, 330 S.E.2d 560, 562 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s decision to qualify Drake as an expert witness.Â  Our review of the record indicates Weather Shield named Drake before trial as a fact witness in an answer to Bethardsâ€™ first set of interrogatories, and explicitly reserved the right to elicit opinions from each witness to the extent he is an expert in his field.Â  Additionally, Bethards had ample opportunity to fully explore the witnessâ€™ opinions and anticipated trial testimony during his deposition.Â  Moreover, after Bethardsâ€™ attorney objected to Drakeâ€™s qualification as an expert, the trial court offered him the opportunity to voire dire the witness before the trial court made its ruling, and Bethardsâ€™ attorney declined.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in allowing his testimony.\r\n 3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Jury Charges\r\nBethards argues the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury as he requested.Â  We disagree.\r\nA trial court is required to charge the current and correct law. Â Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 392, 574 S.E.2d 215, 220\r\n(Ct. App. 2002). Â When reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, our court must consider the charge as a whole, in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial. Â Id.Â  To warrant reversal, the refusal to give a requested charge must have been erroneous and prejudicial. Â Jones v. Ridgely Communications, Inc., 304 S.C. 452, 456, 405 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1991).\r\nFirst, Bethards claims the trial court erred in not charging the jury on the law of multiple causation.Â  Bethards requested the multiple causation charge in relation to his negligence claim, which was dismissed on directed verdict.Â  Â The only issue that went to the jury was Bethardsâ€™ breach of warranty claim, and it would have been error for the trial court to charge the law of multiple causation when it was inapplicable to the issue presented to the jury.Â  See Miller v. Schmid Labs., Inc., 307 S.C. 140, 143, 414 S.E.2d 126, 127 (1992) (holding it is reversible error to chare a principle of\r\nlaw as governing a case when such principle is inapplicable to the issues on trial).Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to charge multiple causation.Â  \r\nNext, Bethards claims the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury that a manufacturerâ€™s disclaimers in a limited warranty must be communicated to the buyer; otherwise, the disclaimers are ineffective because they do not form a part of the agreement.Â  However, the trial courtâ€™s charge on the matter stated â€œ[a] disclaimer of implied warranty or a limitation in remedy printed on the label or other document and given to the buyer at the time of the delivery of [the] good is ineffective where itâ€™s not part of the original agreement unless the parties have agreed upon the disclaimer after the original agreement was made.â€Â  When a trial court refuses to charge the jury with a charge whose substance was included in the trial courtâ€™s instruction, there is no error in refusing the request. Â Varnadore v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 289 S.C. 155, 160, 345 S.E.2d 711, 715 (1986).Â  The requested charge was encompassed by the charge the trial court gave because it is clear that Bethards could not have agreed to the disclaimer unless it was communicated to him.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in failing to give this charge.\r\n 4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Prejudice from Directed Verdict\r\nBethards claims he should be granted a new trial because the trial courtâ€™s erroneous directed verdict for Tenny was prejudicial to his remaining claim against Weather Shield.Â  This issue was not raise to or ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Thus it is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appeal).Â  Â Â \r\nD.Â  Denial of Directed Verdict\r\nBethards maintains the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion for a directed verdict on his claim of breach of the implied warranty of merchantability against Weather Shield.Â  He also contends the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in his favor because Weather Shield failed to present evidence of its affirmative defense that the limited written warranty and its explicit disclaimers were applicable to Bethards.Â  He asserts: (1) the written warranty was never delivered to him, and therefore, was not applicable; (2) the warranty failed its essential purpose; (3) the warranty was ambiguous and misleading; and (4) the limits on remedies provided by the warranty are void.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing a motion for directed verdict, this court must consider all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and may only reverse a juryâ€™s verdict if the factual findings implicit within it are contrary to the only reasonable inference from the evidence.â€Â \r\nMaher v. Titex Corp., 331 S.C. 371, 376, 500 S.E.2d 204, 207 (Ct. App. 1998) (citation omitted).Â  On appeal from the denial of a motion for directed verdict, the appellate court may only reverse if there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â Â  S.C. Prop. and Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 521, 548 S.E.2d 880, 885 (Ct. App. 2001). If the evidence yields more than one inference, the motion for directed verdict should be denied. Â Garrett v. Locke, 309 S.C. 94, 98, 419 S.E.2d 842, 845 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability Claim \r\nBethards argues the evidence presented at trial only supports the inference that Weather Shield breached the implied warranty of merchantability. Â We disagree.\r\nAccording to section 36-2-314(1) of the South Carolina Code Annotated (2003), â€œa warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.â€Â  In order for the goods to be merchantable, they must be at least such as:\r\n\r\n(a) pass without objection in the trade under the contract description;Â  and \r\n(b) in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description;Â  and \r\n(c) are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used;Â  and \r\n(d) run, within the variations permitted by the agreement, of even kind, quality and quantity within each unit and among all units involved;Â  and \r\n(e) are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement may require. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-314(2) (2003).\r\nAfter reviewing the record, we find the trial court properly allowed the jury to decide whether Weather Shield breached the implied warranty of merchantability because the evidence supported more than one reasonable inference.Â  Although Bethards correctly contends Weather Shieldâ€™s representative testified he could not exclude product failure as the cause of several rotten window sashes, this testimony does not constitute an admission by Weather Shield that its product was defective. Â Drake also stated that the damage to the rotten windows was more likely caused by failing to keep the windows locked or closed during rainstorms.Â  Moreover, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to Weather Shield, the record contained additional evidence from which the jury could have determined that Weather Shield did not breach the warranty or that the water damage was not the result of any breach by Weather Shield.Â  Weather Shield presented testimony that the water damage could have been caused by faulty installation of the windows and doors.Â  Therefore, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â Â Â  \r\n2.Â  Enforceability of the Limited Warranty\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Delivery \r\nBethards argues the disclaimers contained in Weather Shieldâ€™s limited warranty are inapplicable to the instant action because the warranty was not communicated to him. Section 36-2-316(2) of the South Carolina Code Annotated (2003) allows a seller of goods to contractually modify or limit any implied warranty, provided, â€œthe exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous.â€ Â Evidence was presented at trial that Weather Shieldâ€™s limited warranty information was on the windows when they were delivered to the home.Â  Bethards testified he saw the sticker on the window.Â  When taken in the light most favorable to Weather Shield, the nonmoving party, there is some evidence to support that the limited warranty was communicated in writing to Bethards.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in falling to grant Bethardsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict.\r\n b.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Failure of Essential Purpose\r\nBethards claims the trial court erred in failing to grant a directed verdict to him on the issue of whether Weather Shieldâ€™s limited warranty fails of its essential purpose. Â Weather Shieldâ€™s limited warranty provides that â€œWeather Shieldâ€™s obligation under this Limited Warranty and Adjustment Policy shall be limited to, at its option and expense, its repair of or provision of a comparable new Weather Shield replacement part for any part which Weather Shield determines to be covered by this Limited Warranty and Adjustment Policy.â€Â  Bethards contends Weather Shield failed to replace or repair the defective product as the limited warranty provides and thus, the limited warranty should be considered void.Â  However, evidence as to whether Weather Shield even knew of the products being defective conflicted.Â  The evidence shows Bethards contacted Southern Lumber, not Weather Shield, regarding the problems with the windows and sliding doors. Â Although Bethards testified someone came to repair his doors and windows, he was unsure if it was a representative from Southern Lumber or Weather Shield.Â  Therefore, given that Weather Shield may not have known of the defective product until it was named a party to this lawsuit, the trial court was correct in not granting Bethardsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict on this issue.\r\n c.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Ambiguity\r\nBethards argues he was entitled to a direct verdict because the limited warranty was misleading.Â  Bethards argues that the term â€œweather exposureâ€ in the warranty was undefined and therefore, is ambiguous.Â  Bethards contends because the languageâ€™s purpose is to exclude the implied warranty of merchantability, the ambiguity must be resolved in his favor.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-316(2).Â  In the warranty, under the heading of â€œMisuse, Abuse, Etc.,â€ is the statement â€œ[t]his warranty does not cover glass breakage or distortion or any other failures or operating difficulties . . . due to exposure to the elements.â€Â  Reading the clause alongside the heading, it is clear that the limitation applies only where there has been a misuse of the windows, not in normal use of the windows.Â  See Holden v. Alice Mfg., Inc., 317 S.C. 215, 221, 452 S.E.2d 628, 631 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œ[I]n determining the intent and purport of a contract, the court should not look solely to one clause read in isolation from the rest of the document; rather, it should consider the contents of the whole instrument.â€). Â Further, Weather Shield never attempted to disclaim any implied warranty obligation to Bethards under this clause.Â  Weather Shield contends it was never even contacted by Bethards about the windows.Â  Therefore, even if the clause is interpreted against Weather Shield, it does not entitle Bethards to a directed verdict because the evidence supports more than one reasonable inference.Â  Accordingly, the trial court correctly submitted the issue to the jury.Â Â Â  \r\n d.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Limits on Remedies\r\nBethards claims section 36-2-719(3) of the South Carolina Code Ann. (2003) provides that a limitation on a remedy for a consumer product is presumed unconscionable unless proven otherwise by the manufacturer.Â  However, the section in question actually provides â€œ[c]onsequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. Â Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-719(3) (2003) (emphasis added).Â  Because the injury at issue is not to the person, the limitation on the remedy is not prima facie unconscionable.Â  Therefore, the trial court properly gave the task of determining whether the limitation of remedies was unconscionable to the jury, along with a charge stating the test for determining the unconscionability of limitations of remedies.Â  The trial court did not err in failing to grant a directed verdict for Bethards on this basis.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court did not err in granting directed verdicts for Synco and Weather Shield on Bethardsâ€™ negligence claims because the statute of limitations barred the claims. Bethardsâ€™ claim that the trial courtâ€™s legal and evidentiary errors entitle him to a new trial is without merit.Â  Finally, the trial court correctly denied Bethardsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict on his remaining claim of breach of the implied warranty of merchantability because the evidence was sufficient to warrant a question for the jury.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
