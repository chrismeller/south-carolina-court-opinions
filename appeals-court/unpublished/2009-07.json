Hughston, Jr., Circuit Court\r\nJudge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2009-UP-382\r\nHeard May 13, 2009 â€“ Filed July 6, 2009\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        ThomasÂ  Goldstein, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        John M. Bleecker, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this case involving a commercial lease,Â  Jack Dorman\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting Henry Kuznik a directed verdict on all\r\n  of Dorman's counterclaims and in excluding Dorman's exhibits.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nKuznik and Dorman\r\n  entered into a commercial lease agreement for 2117 Savannah Highway (the\r\n  Property) with a one-year term beginning on March 1, 1998.Â  The lease granted Dorman\r\n  ten one-year renewal options.Â  The rent was initially $800 a month, but the\r\n  lease provided for a cost of living increase each year.Â  Dorman operated a used\r\n  car dealership on the Property.Â  At the time the parties entered into the\r\n  lease, Dorman received possession of the building at the front of the lot.Â  At\r\n  the back of the lot was a larger building that Kuznik rented to two other\r\n  businesses.Â  Kuznik also used a portion of that building for storage.Â  \r\nIn May of 2000, the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Transportation condemned the Property for construction\r\n  on Savannah Highway.Â  Dorman and the other tenants vacated the Property.Â \r\n  Dorman, however, continued to pay Kuznik rent, which Kuznik deposited into his\r\n  escrow account.Â  During the construction project, Dorman's building was\r\n  completely destroyed and the other building was partially destroyed.Â  After the\r\n  project ended, Kuznik repaired the larger building and used a portion of it for\r\n  storage.Â  Dorman moved into the remaining part of the building and resumed his\r\n  used car business in August of 2001.Â  In July of 2004, Kuznik moved his office\r\n  into the space he had used as storage.Â  At this point, the parties'\r\n  relationship quickly deteriorated.Â  Kuznik asserted that the original lease was\r\n  terminated due to the condemnation proceeding and under the new, oral lease,\r\n  Dorman owed $1,650 a month.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  December 31, 2004, Kuznik gave Dorman a notice to quit the premises no later\r\n  than February 1, 2005.Â  When Dorman failed to quit the premises, Kuznik brought\r\n  this action seeking a writ of ejectment and a claim for rent due in the amount\r\n  of $25,178.92. Â Dorman answered and claimed the original lease was still\r\n  controlling.Â  He also asserted counterclaims for breach of quiet enjoyment,\r\n  civil conspiracy, interference with business relations, and trespass.Â  The case\r\n  was tried before a jury.Â  At the close of the evidence, the trial court granted\r\n  Kuznik a directed verdict on all of Dorman's counterclaims, finding Dorman had\r\n  failed to present any evidence of damages.Â  The court submitted the remaining\r\n  claims to the jury with special interrogatories.Â  The jury found that the\r\n  parties had agreed to substitute the new or remodeled building for the old, now\r\n  demolished, building in the lease; that the rent the parties agreed to was the\r\n  amount in the original lease, and that Kuznik owed Dorman $500.00 for water.Â \r\n  The court denied Dorman's motion for a new trial.Â  This appeal followed. Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDorman\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting Kuznik's directed verdict on all of\r\n  his counterclaims.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court granted Kuznik a directed verdict on all the counterclaims on the\r\n  basis that Dorman had failed to establish any damages.Â  Although this was the\r\n  court's only stated ground, Dorman's appellant's brief argument on the directed\r\n  verdict issue focuses solely on Kuznik's alleged improper actions.Â  It does not\r\n  address the court's ruling on damages or argue evidence of damages was presented\r\n  other than to state: Â &quot;While it is impossible to prove a negative-such as\r\n  identifying the customers who chose not to purchase an automobile-the record\r\n  does establish sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude reasonably that\r\n  Kuznik deliberately interfered in Dorman's business.&quot;Â  We find this sole\r\n  statement is so conclusory as to consider the issue of damages abandoned.Â  See Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005) (finding party abandoned an issue on appeal due to failure to cite\r\n  any supporting authority and making only conclusory arguments).Â  It is not\r\n  until the reply brief that Dorman addresses the issue of damages.Â  However, an\r\n  appellant may not raise a specific argument for the first time in his reply brief.Â  See Crawford v. Henderson, 356 S.C. 389, 409, 589 S.E.2d 204, 215\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Similarly, Dorman's presentation of the issue of damages at\r\n  oral argument was not sufficient to bring the issue properly before this court.Â  See Bochette v. Bochette, 300 S.C. 109, 112, 386 S.E.2d 475, 477\r\n  (Ct. App. 1989) (stating an issue raised for the first time in oral argument or\r\n  in the reply brief will not be considered by the appellate court). As Dorman\r\n  failed to properly challenge the trial court's ruling on damages, the ruling is\r\n  the law of the case.Â  See First Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden,\r\n  333 S.C. 554, 566, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998) (&quot;The unchallenged\r\n  ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmance.&quot;).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we affirm the trial court's granting of a directed verdict on Dorman's\r\n  counterclaims.Â  As we affirm for the above stated reason, we need not address\r\n  Dorman's remaining issue.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-383","title":"Cohen-Toledano v.

Hendricks, Jr., the circuit court granted\r\n  summary judgment in favor of judgment creditors Ken H. Lester and Glen P.\r\n  Straker and ordered distribution of sufficient funds to satisfy their judgments.Â \r\n  Judgment creditor Carolyn Songer Austin appeals, asserting Lester is barred\r\n  from claiming an interest in the funds on the ground his judgment was not\r\n  enforced within the ten year period for execution.Â  In the alternative, Austin\r\n  asserts the trial court erred in failing to distribute the funds between the\r\n  three judgment creditors on a pro rata basis.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  Austin argues supplementary proceedings are not a prerequisite for a judgment\r\n  creditor to enforce its judgment, this case involves property of the judgment debtor\r\n  in the hands of a third party that could not be reached absent an order obtained\r\n  in supplementary proceedings.Â  Because Lester and Straker obtained orders in\r\n  supplementary proceedings for levy and attachment of the subject property within\r\n  the ten year period for execution and Austin did not, we affirm the order of\r\n  the circuit court pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following\r\n  authorities:Â  Rule 69, SCRCP (&quot;Process to enforce a judgment for the\r\n  payment of money shall be by writ of execution . . . .&quot;); S.C.

Smith appeals the trial court's\r\n  $11,000 judgment in favor of A. Gary Ezzo and Anne Marie Ezzo (collectively the\r\n  Ezzos).Â  We affirm as modified. [1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nThe\r\n  Ezzos purchased a house in Mt. Pleasant from Charleston Building Group, which\r\n  was owned in part by Smith.Â  At the time of the purchase, Smith was involved in\r\n  litigation with his partners in Charleston Building Group.Â  The house was only\r\n  80% to 85% completed and the Ezzos purchased it &quot;as-is.&quot;Â  They\r\n  subsequently entered into a contract with Smith for completion of the house on\r\n  February 19, 2002. \r\nThe contract, which\r\n  was prepared by Smith, called for total payment of $136,200 with the work and\r\n  payment schedule divided into five phases and payments made in advance.Â  On\r\n  April 18, 2002, the parties executed a change order with some variations for Phases\r\n  2, 3, and 4.Â  The Ezzos paid in advance the full payments for Phases 1, 2, and\r\n  4 and 90% of Phase 3.Â  Mr. Ezzo testified that for each phase, Smith failed to\r\n  complete part of the work required for that phase.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Certificate of Occupancy was issued on July 31, 2002, and the Ezzos moved into\r\n  the house that day. Although the work on the house was not complete, the Ezzos\r\n  had moved to Mt. Pleasant from California and needed a place to live.Â  On\r\n  August 9, the Ezzos paid Smith $4,767.00 in advance for Phase 5, making their\r\n  total payments to Smith $123,000.00, which was 90% of the contract price.Â  Mr.\r\n  Ezzo testified he withheld the remainder of the payment because not all of the\r\n  work had been completed for the previous phases and he had concerns that Smith\r\n  was not making payments to his subcontractors and vendors.Â  He stated that when\r\n  he explained his reasons for the partial payment, Smith agreed that it was\r\n  fair. \r\nDuring Labor Day weekend,\r\n  Smith was seriously injured when he fell off a ladder while working at the Ezzos'\r\n  house.Â  He stated he was bedridden for thirty days and then for another fifteen\r\n  days he was unable to work.Â  On October 4, 2002, Smith sent the Ezzos an email\r\n  stating that while he could not perform any physical work himself, he could\r\n  provide adequate supervision to have the remaining work completed.Â  He\r\n  requested the Ezzos send him the remaining money owed so the work could be\r\n  completed. The Ezzos responded in a letter dated October 5, 2002, asserting\r\n  that they did not owe Smith any money at that time because a considerable\r\n  amount of work remained unfinished and exceeded the 10% of the contract price\r\n  that they had retained.Â  In the letter, they listed items that needed to be\r\n  completed and raised their concerns that subcontractors had yet to be paid. Â In\r\n  a letter postmarked November 22, 2002, Smith replied that he disagreed with the\r\n  Ezzos' position and stated he had complied with the terms of the contract.Â  He\r\n  asserted that he would not proceed with completing the work on the house.Â  In\r\n  their reply, the Ezzos requested Smith have the two mechanic's liens placed on\r\n  the property by vendors removed, correct electrical problems, and provide the\r\n  remaining screens for the windows.Â  The Ezzos offered to discuss the situation\r\n  with Smith after these issues were resolved.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Ezzos eventually brought this action in small claims court.Â  Although they\r\n  stated their damages exceeded $7,500.00, they limited their claim to this\r\n  amount to fall within the jurisdictional limit of small claims court.Â  Smith\r\n  filed an answer denying the Ezzos' claims and a counterclaim seeking $18,840.00\r\n  in damages.Â  Because the amount Smith sought exceeded the jurisdictional limits\r\n  of small claims court, the case was transferred to the court of common pleas\r\n  where the Ezzos filed their reply to Smith's counterclaim.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  a bench trial, the trial court issued a Form 4 order finding in favor of the\r\n  Ezzos in the amount of $11,000.00.Â  Smith filed a motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment, asking the court to make finding of facts and conclusions of law.Â \r\n  The Ezzos submitted a proposed order in response to which Smith submitted a\r\n  letter objecting to specific language.Â  The trial court issued an order setting\r\n  forth several items included in the $11,000.00 judgment.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;An\r\n  action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an action at law.&quot;Â  R &amp; G Constr., Inc., v. Lowcountry Reg'l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C.\r\n  424, 430, 540 S.E.2d 113, 117 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  &quot;In an action at law, on\r\n  appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will\r\n  not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which\r\n  reasonably supports the judge's findings.&quot;Â  Townes Assocs. Ltd. v. City\r\n    of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â Â  However,\r\n  &quot;a reviewing court is free to decide questions of law with no particular\r\n  deference to the trial court.&quot;Â  Hunt v.

App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Antecedent breach\r\nSmith\r\n  argues the trial court erred in ruling Smith breached the contract because the\r\n  Ezzos' antecedent breach of the contract by withholding payment excused Smith's\r\n  nonperformance of the contract.Â  \r\n&quot;It\r\n  is a question of law for the court whether the language of a contract is\r\n  ambiguous.&quot;Â  S.C.

Town of McClellanville,\r\n  345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (2001).Â  &quot;Whether a contract is\r\n  ambiguous is to be determined from the entire contract and not from isolated\r\n  portions of the contract.&quot;Â  Farr v. Duke Power Co., 265 S.C. 356, 362,\r\n  218 S.E.2d 431, 433 (1975); see Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp.,\r\n  328 S.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1997) (&quot;A contract is\r\n  ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively\r\n  by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire\r\n  integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages,\r\n  and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or\r\n  business.&quot;).Â Â  \r\nConstruction\r\n  of an ambiguous contract is a question of fact.Â  Skull Creek Club Ltd.\r\n    P'ship v. Cook &amp; Book, Inc., 313 S.C. 283, 286, 437 S.E.2d 163, 165 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1993).Â  When an agreement is ambiguous, the court should seek to determine\r\n  the parties' intent.Â  Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C. 331, 338, 465 S.E.2d 121,\r\n  125 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  &quot;Ambiguous language in a contract should be construed\r\n  liberally and most strongly in favor of the party who did not write or prepare\r\n  the contract and is not responsible for the ambiguity; and any ambiguity in a\r\n  contract, doubt, or uncertainty as to its meaning should be resolved against\r\n  the party who prepared the contract or is responsible for the verbiage.&quot;Â  Myrtle\r\n    Beach Lumber Co. v. Willoughby, 276 S.C. 3, 8, 274 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1981)\r\n  (quoting 17A C.J.S. Contracts Â§ 324).\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the contract included several sections regarding payments.Â \r\n  Under the payment schedule, the contract provided for payments to be made in\r\n  advance prior to the start of each phase but allowed the Ezzos to &quot;hold\r\n  back&quot; at their discretion 10% of that amount until the phase was\r\n  completed.Â  Article 5.1, as amended, provided final payment was to be made\r\n  &quot;when the work has been completed, the contract fully performed, and a\r\n  Certificate of Occupancy has been issued by the local Building Official.&quot;\r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  addition, Article 15.2 provided:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tPayments\r\n  may be withheld on account of (1) defective Work not remedied, (2) claims filed\r\n  by third parties, (3) failure of the Contractor to make payments properly to\r\n  Subcontractors or for labor, materials or equipment, (4) reasonable evidence\r\n  that the Work cannot be completed for the unpaid balance of the Contract Sum, .\r\n  . . (7) persistent failure to carry out the Work in accordance with the\r\n  Contract Documents.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nUnder\r\n  Article 15.3, final payment was not due until the contractor provided the owner\r\n  with a release of all liens or receipts for payment of all labor, materials,\r\n  and equipment for which a lien could be filed, or a bond to indemnify the owner\r\n  from such liens.Â  This article further provided, &quot;If such lien remains\r\n  unsatisfied after payments are made, the Contractor shall refund to the Owner\r\n  all money that the Owner may be compelled to pay in discharging such lien,\r\n  including all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.&quot;Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  contract is ambiguous with regards to the Ezzos' rights to withhold payment.Â \r\n  Reading the contract as a whole, there is evidence to support the trial court's\r\n  determination that the Ezzos had the right to withhold the funds.Â  Although the\r\n  payment schedule limited the &quot;hold back&quot; amount from the advance\r\n  payments to 10% of the amount of that phase, Article 15.2 contains no such\r\n  limitation on the amount the Ezzos could withhold if the circumstances listed\r\n  had occurred.Â  The Ezzos presented evidence that at the time work stopped on\r\n  the house, Smith had not completed any of the five phases and that some of the\r\n  work completed was defective.Â  In addition, several contractors and vendors had\r\n  not been paid.Â  The record contains two mechanic's liens filed against the\r\n  property. Thus, under Articles 15.2 and 15.3, the Ezzos were allowed to\r\n  withhold payment.Â  Accordingly, there is evidence in the record to support the\r\n  trial court's determination that Smith was in breach of the contract by\r\n  refusing to complete the contract.Â Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Calculation of\r\n  damages\r\nSmith\r\n  argues the trial court erred in its calculation of the Ezzos' net damages. \r\nIn\r\n  its original Form 4 order, the trial court awarded the Ezzos $11,000.00 in\r\n  damages.Â  At Smith's request, the court issued an order with specific findings\r\n  of fact and conclusions of law.Â  In this order, the court held:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Court finds credible evidence to support finding of damages which were a direct\r\n  consequence of the breach by Smith in the amount of Eleven Thousand Dollars\r\n  ($11,000.00) including specifically the following, to wit: a credit for bricks\r\n  and flooring of $1,000.00; a credit for unused shelving allowance of $1,000.00;\r\n  landscaping and installation of irrigation system in the amount of $8,100.00;\r\n  payments made to subcontractors Ascue Artistic Wood Floors, in the amount of\r\n  $2,980.00, and to Carolina Carpet in the amount of $1,940.00; work done to\r\n  complete exterior construction in the amount of $2,848.00; TruePenny Homes to\r\n  correct and complete the project per contract amount of $4,560.00.Â  \r\n\r\nSmith\r\n  asserts that the sum of the damages listed is $22,428.00 and when Smith is\r\n  credited for the $13,620.00 the Ezzos withheld from the contract amount, the\r\n  net difference is $8,808.00 rather than the $11,000.00 awarded by the court. Â We\r\n  find this argument is not preserved because Smith failed to raise the alleged\r\n  inaccuracy by way of post-trial motion.Â  See Padgett v. Mercado,\r\n  341 S.C. 229, 233, 533 S.E.2d 339, 341 (Ct. App. 2000) (&quot;Any argument\r\n  alleging an inaccuracy or inconsistency in an order must be raised by a\r\n  post-trial motion.&quot;). \r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Objections to listed damages\r\nSmith\r\n  argues portions of the specific damages awarded are clearly erroneous.Â  We will\r\n  address each item in turn.Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; Landscaping\r\n  damages award.Â  \r\nSmith\r\n  claims the $8,100.00 award for landscaping reimburses the Ezzos for their\r\n  purchase of additional sod pallets, topsoil and additional irrigation zones\r\n  beyond what was to be allowed under the specifications of the contract.Â  The\r\n  contract did not set forth a specific monetary allowance for landscaping.Â \r\n  Instead, it provided Smith would &quot;[i]nstall irrigation system with a\r\n  minimum 4 zones using system capable of providing 6 zones; Install landscaping,\r\n  allow up to 6 pallets of centipede, 50 bales of pine straw, 40 three gallon\r\n  plants, 4 seven gallon plants.&quot;Â  Although the Ezzos claimed $10,754.00 in\r\n  landscaping damages, the court only awarded them $8,100.00.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Ezzos purchased fifteen pallets of centipede sod at $250.00 per pallet even\r\n  though the contract allowed for only six pallets.Â  The trial court's reduction\r\n  in the damages requested could have been from this item.Â  Smith also disputes\r\n  the amount of topsoil the Ezzos purchased arguing the Ezzos were only entitled\r\n  for reimbursement for the amount of soil needed for the sod allowed under the\r\n  contract.Â  The contract, however, does not set a limit on the topsoil allowed.Â \r\n  The Ezzos presented evidence that Smith did no landscaping and they had to do\r\n  the final grading themselves.Â  Thus, the soil may have been used for the\r\n  grading.Â  \r\nNext\r\n  Smith asserts the contract limited the irrigation system to six zones but the\r\n  Ezzos installed a system with fourteen zones at $350.00 a zone.Â  The contract\r\n  provides for an irrigation system with a minimum of four zones using a system\r\n  capable of providing six zones.Â  It does not limit the amount to be spent on\r\n  the system.Â  There is no evidence in the record that the system the Ezzos\r\n  installed was excessive and unnecessary.\r\nWe\r\n  therefore find no error in the trial court's award of damages for Â landscaping.Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; TruePenny\r\n  Homes\r\nSmith\r\n  argues the trial court erred in awarding the Ezzos $4,560.00 for TruePenny\r\n  Homes.Â  He contends the court should not have awarded the Ezzos $2,235.00 for TruePenny\r\n  to &quot;install footers, block and brick under chimney and tie into existing\r\n  foundation.&quot;Â  \r\nSmith\r\n  and his subcontractor, Wylie Johnson, testified that Johnson installed a\r\n  footing to support the chimney. Johnson acknowledged he did not drill into the\r\n  existing foundation to interlock it with the chimney support. Johnson claimed\r\n  that concrete would be found within twenty-four inches of the surface. \r\nIn\r\n  addition, Smith claims that a contractor the Ezzos hired, Chris Williams, also\r\n  installed a footing for the concrete.Â  An invoice from Williams shows that he\r\n  charged the Ezzos $950.00 for twenty hours of work, which included &quot;pouring\r\n  concrete around chimney foundation and back porch.&quot;Â  \r\nMr.\r\n  Ezzo, however, insisted the footing is still not in place.Â  In addition, David\r\n  DiPietro, from TruePenny Homes, testified that although it was not a code\r\n  violation, there was no footing under the chimney where the fireplace was\r\n  cantilevered, and that was why the additional work is needed. \r\nThe\r\n  trial court found Mr. Ezzo's and DiPietro's testimonies to be credible.Â  It\r\n  further held:\r\n\r\n\tI find\r\n  that Mr. Smith was not credible.Â  Mr. Smith was evasive and avoided answering\r\n  questions directly; he contradicted himself and did not appear to provide\r\n  truthful testimony regarding the footings for the fireplace.Â  \r\n\r\nAs\r\n  the finder of fact, it was for the trial court to resolve conflicts in the\r\n  testimony.Â  See Sherman v. W &amp; B Enters., Inc., 357 S.C. 243,\r\n  250, 592 S.E.2d 307, 310 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating that although there may be\r\n  conflicts in the evidence in the record, our standard of review only allows us\r\n  to look for the existence of evidence and not to weigh its credibility).Â Â  \r\nSmith\r\n  asserts the Ezzos should have been bound by the doctrine of collateral estoppel\r\n  due to the prior dismissal of the Ezzos' complaint to the Town of Mount\r\n  Pleasant Building Department.Â  However, as the trial court's order did not\r\n  address this issue, it is not properly before this court. See Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is\r\n  axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.&quot;).\r\nAs\r\n  there is evidence in the record to support the award of damages for work to be\r\n  performed by TruePenny Homes, we find no error in the trial court's decision on\r\n  this item.Â  \r\n3.&nbsp; Brick and\r\n  flooring \r\nSmith\r\n  asserts the trial court erred in awarding the Ezzos $1,000.00 in damages for\r\n  brick and floor credits.Â  He asserts the Ezzos had previously retained $921.60\r\n  for these same bricks.Â  We hold this issue is not properly before this court\r\n  because Smith failed to raise it to the trial court in a post-trial motion.Â  See Padgett, 341 S.C. at 233, 533 S.E.2d at 341 (&quot;Any argument alleging\r\n  an inaccuracy or inconsistency in an order must be raised by a post-trial\r\n  motion.&quot;).\r\n4.&nbsp; Ascue\r\n  Artistic Wood Floors\r\nSmith\r\n  argues the trial court erred in awarding the Ezzos $2,980.00 for the balance\r\n  due for the work of Ascue Artistic Wood Floors.Â  He asserts the trial court\r\n  incorrectly included $675.00 for a change order that exceeded the original\r\n  contract allowance.Â  He also claims an additional $135.00 should be deducted\r\n  from the judgment for the 20% mark-up Smith would have made on that payment.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  original contract provided wood floors would be installed on all of the first\r\n  floor, the stair landing, the second-floor hallway, and the hall linen closet.Â \r\n  The invoice from Ascue Artistic Wood Floors lists under a change orders section\r\n  a charge for $325.00 for the landing on the steps, $42.00 for an additional\r\n  bundle of red oak flooring, and $308.00 for installing the flooring in a small\r\n  room upstairs.Â  Mr. Ezzo acknowledged that as a change, they installed hardwood\r\n  flooring in a room upstairs.Â  However, the original contract provided for wood\r\n  floors for the stair landing.Â  Therefore, only the installation of wood floors\r\n  in the small room was a part of the change order. Â We find the trial court\r\n  incorrectly included $308.00 in its award for the installation of flooring in\r\n  the small room.Â  However, we hold Smith is not entitled to a mark-up on this\r\n  amount.Â  &quot;[W]here a contract is not performed, the party who is guilty of\r\n  the first breach is generally the one upon whom all liability for the\r\n  nonperformance rests.&quot;Â  Willms Trucking Co. v. JW Constr. Co., 314\r\n  S.C. 170, 178, 442 S.E.2d 197, 201 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  We find only $308.00\r\n  should be deducted from the judgment amount.Â  \r\n5.&nbsp; Carolina\r\n  Carpet damages\r\nSmith\r\n  argues the correct amount of damages for the payment to Carolina Carpet should\r\n  have been $1,800.00, rather than $1,940.00 awarded by the trial court.Â  During\r\n  the hearing, the Ezzos stipulated that the correct amount was $1,800.00.Â  We\r\n  find Smith should have raised this error to the trial court in a post-trial\r\n  motion.Â  See Padgett, 341 S.C. at 233, 533 S.E.2d at 341\r\n  (&quot;Any argument alleging an inaccuracy or inconsistency in an order must be\r\n  raised by a post-trial motion.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the issue is not properly\r\n  before this court.Â  \r\n6.\r\n  Credit for overages on the electrical fixtures and appliance allowance\r\nSmith\r\n  argues the trial court erred in not crediting him $1,656.38 forÂ  Smith's\r\n  out-of-pocket payments for electrical fixtures and appliances that exceeded the\r\n  contract allowances.Â  The trial court did not explicitly rule on Smith's request\r\n  for credit for these items.Â  It was Smith's responsibility to seek a ruling on\r\n  this issue by way of a post-trial motion.Â  See Shealy v. Aiken County,\r\n  341 S.C. 448, 460, 535 S.E.2d 438, 444 (2000) (stating trial court's general\r\n  ruling is insufficient to preserve specific issue for appellate review; when\r\n  trial court does not explicitly rule on argument raised, and post-trial motion is\r\n  filed, appellate court may not address the issue); Noisette v. Ismail,\r\n  304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding that when a trial court\r\n  does not explicitly rule on an argument raised, and appellant makes no Rule\r\n  59(e) motion to obtain a ruling, the appellate court may not address the\r\n  issue).Â  Accordingly, we find no reversible error.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the trial court erred in including as damages the costs associated with\r\n  the installation of flooring in the room upstairs that was part of a change\r\n  order and deduct $308.00 from the judgment amount.Â  The order of the trial\r\n  court is otherwise AFFIRMED.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.Â  \r\nHUFF,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-392","title":"Bennett v.

James, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2009-UP-392\r\nHeard June 10, 2009 â€“ Filed July 16, 2009\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Darryl D. Smalls, of Columbia, for Appellants. \r\n        Richard W. Simmons, II, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â After\r\n  suffering a shoulder injury at work, Kathleen Ragin Bennett sought workers'\r\n  compensation benefits from her employer, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, and\r\n  its insurance carrier, Gallagher Bassett (collectively &quot;Cracker\r\n  Barrel&quot;).Â  The single commissioner and the Appellate Panel of the Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel) awarded her benefits based upon her\r\n  hourly wage and reported tips, and the circuit court reversed.Â  Cracker Barrel\r\n  appeals from the circuit court's order requiring recalculation of Bennett's\r\n  average weekly wage and compensation rate.Â  We reverse and reinstate the order\r\n  of the Appellate Panel.\r\nFACTS\r\nBennett\r\n  worked an average of thirty-two hours a week as a server at Cracker Barrel.Â \r\n  She was compensated at a rate of $2.41 per hour plus tips.Â  As was customary\r\n  for wait staff, Bennett reported eight percent of her sales as tips to Cracker\r\n  Barrel.Â  These reported tips placed Bennett's earnings above the federally\r\n  mandated hourly minimum wage.Â  She did not report the actual amount of her tip\r\n  earnings, which she and Cracker Barrel agreed exceeded eight percent of her sales,\r\n  to Cracker Barrel or to the Internal Revenue Service.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  November 18, 2004, Bennett injured her left shoulder while lifting a large urn\r\n  of tea at work.Â  Despite the injury, Bennett worked for two additional weeks\r\n  before seeing a doctor, and her shoulder ultimately required surgery.Â  Bennett\r\n  filed an application for workers' compensation benefits.Â  The single\r\n  commissioner awarded Bennett medical and temporary total disability benefits\r\n  using an average weekly wage based only upon the wage and tip earnings she\r\n  reported to Cracker Barrel.Â  The Appellate Panel affirmed.Â  Bennett appealed\r\n  the calculation of her average weekly wage to the circuit court, which reversed\r\n  and remanded.Â  Cracker Barrel appealed to this court.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing workers' compensation decisions, the appellate court ascertains &quot;whether\r\n  the circuit court properly determined whether the [A]ppellate [P]anel's\r\n  findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and\r\n  whether the [P]anel's decision is affected by an error of law.&quot;Â  Baxter\r\n    v.

Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2008).Â  Generally, &quot;'[c]ourts\r\n  defer to the relevant administrative agency's decisions with respect to its own\r\n  regulations unless there is a compelling reason to differ.'&quot;Â  Neal v.\r\n    Brown, 374 S.C. 641, 649, 649 S.E.2d 164, 168 (Ct. App. 2007), cert. granted May 30, 2008 (quoting S.C. Coastal Conservation League v.\r\n      S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 363 S.C. 67, 75, 610 S.E.2d 482,\r\n  486 (2005)).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCracker\r\n  Barrel argues the circuit court erred in remanding this matter to the Appellate\r\n  Panel for recalculation of Bennett's average weekly wage.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe compensation rate for a total disability award is equal to\r\n  sixty-six-and-two-thirds percent of the claimant's average weekly wage.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;42-9-10(A) (Supp. 2008).Â  A claimant's average weekly wage\r\n  means:\r\n\r\n  [T]he earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which\r\n    he was working at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two weeks\r\n    immediately preceding the date of the injury . . . . Â &quot;Average weekly wage&quot;\r\n    must be calculated by taking the total wages paid for the last four quarters\r\n    immediately preceding the quarter in which the injury occurred as reported on\r\n    the Employment Security Commission's Employer Contribution Reports divided by\r\n    fifty-two or by the actual number of weeks for which wages were paid, whichever\r\n    is less. . . . .\r\n  When for exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair, either\r\n    to the employer or employee, such other method of computing average weekly\r\n    wages may be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the amount which the\r\n    injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury. \r\n  Whenever allowances of any character made to an employee in lieu\r\n    of wages are a specified part of a wage contract they are deemed a part of his\r\n    earnings.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  42-1-40 (Supp. 2008).Â  If the claimant and the employer are unable to agree on\r\n  a fair rate of temporary compensation, and subsequently if the claimant\r\n  disagrees with the Workers' Compensation Commission's administrative\r\n  recommendation, the claimant may file a Form 50 requesting a hearing.Â  25A Reg.\r\n  67-1603(C) (Supp. 2008).Â  In these circumstances, the average weekly wage and\r\n  compensation rate are issues to be determined at the hearing.Â  25A Reg. 67-606\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nHere, Cracker Barrel bore the initial burden of providing wage\r\n  information.Â  The information it provided consisted of Bennett's hourly wage\r\n  plus the tips she reported.Â  However, no evidence indicates anyone other than\r\n  Bennett ever possessed information about her tip earnings beyond what she\r\n  voluntarily reported.Â  The record reflects Cracker Barrel's payroll records\r\n  included a notation that &quot;servers must report one hundred percent (100%)\r\n  of all tips received.&quot;Â  Despite this notation and her assertion she\r\n  consistently earned more than she reported, Bennett elected to report to\r\n  Cracker Barrel an amount equal to eight percent of her sales, the minimum\r\n  amount that would enable her to pass her employer's daily audit.[1]Â  Aside from\r\n  Bennett's reports, we see no indication Cracker Barrel had any means of\r\n  ascertaining her actual tip earnings.Â  \r\nBy filing a Form 50 challenging Cracker Barrel's calculation of her\r\n  average weekly wage, Bennett invoked an &quot;exceptional reasons&quot;\r\n  analysis of her earnings.Â  See Â§ 42-1-40; Reg. 67-1603(C).Â  Subsequently,\r\n  Bennett presented testimonial evidence supporting her claim of unreported tip\r\n  earnings to the single commissioner, who then awarded Bennett benefits.Â  The\r\n  Appellate Panel adopted the order of the single commissioner and therefore all\r\n  the findings of fact and conclusions of law therein.Â  In doing so, the\r\n  Appellate Panel concluded the law required that &quot;[e]arnings for a tipped\r\n  employee such as a waitress include hourly wages and tips.&quot;Â  This\r\n  conclusion did not exclude any unreported tip earnings.Â  Rather, the order approved\r\n  use of the exceptional reasons analysis and consideration of any wage records Bennett\r\n  submitted into evidence.Â  As a result, we find the decision of the Appellate\r\n  Panel included consideration of all tip earnings, reported and unreported, as\r\n  well as an implicit finding the evidence of unreported tips Bennett presented was\r\n  not credible.Â  Consequently, the circuit court erred in remanding this matter\r\n  for recalculation.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the decision of the Appellate Panel properly included consideration of all\r\n  tip earnings.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court remanding this\r\n  matter for recalculation is reversed, and the order of the Appellate Panel is\r\n  reinstated.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTHOMAS\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Bennett notes in her brief that it is common in the\r\n  restaurant industry for employers to require servers to report eight percent of\r\n  their sales as tips.Â  It appears Cracker Barrel enforced this requirement by\r\n  conducting a daily audit that compared each server's sales with her reported\r\n  tips.Â  A server who reported tips equaling less than eight percent of her total\r\n  sales was required to make up the deficit in the tips she reported the next\r\n  day.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-393","title":"United Capital Funding v.

Cundari, all of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: Â Lisa Bryan appeals the master-in-equity's denial of\r\n    her &quot;motion to dismiss&quot; a judgment against her that was entered in\r\n    Florida and recorded in South Carolina.Â  Bryan argues the master erred in\r\n    refusing to set aside the judgment because the Florida court lacked personal\r\n    and subject matter jurisdiction and the Florida judgment is constitutionally\r\n    defective.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 2001, Bryan filed Articles of Incorporation for\r\n  Technamax, Inc., a close corporation, in Maryland.Â  Bryan was listed as\r\n  Technamax's registered agent and sole director.Â  On October 7, 2003, the State\r\n  of Maryland administratively dissolved Technamax.Â  In 2004, Bryan moved from\r\n  Maryland to South Carolina and signed a contract on behalf of Technamax, hiring\r\n  Beacon Technology Group, LLC (Beacon), a South Carolina company, as a\r\n  subcontractor to provide contract labor to Technamax's customers.Â  Technamax or\r\n  its customers found the labor Beacon provided to be unsatisfactory, and\r\n  Technamax refused to pay Beacon under their contract.Â  \r\nUnder a prior agreement between Beacon and United Capital Funding\r\n  Corp. (United), a Florida corporation, Beacon sold its uncollected accounts to\r\n  United.Â  United contacted Bryan concerning Technamax's debt to Beacon, and in\r\n  May, June, and July 2004, Bryan tendered three checks to United.Â  Bryan signed\r\n  the checks, all of which were drawn on Technamax's account.Â  The three payments\r\n  totaled $41,913.84.Â \r\n\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Florida Lawsuit\r\nIn January 2005,[1] United filed suit against Technamax and Bryan individually, doing business as\r\n  Technamax, in Pinellas County, Florida, for $47,258.92, plus interest, attorney's\r\n  fees, and costs.Â  United's complaint indicated this amount reflected credit for\r\n  the three payments it had received.Â  An affidavit of service indicates Bryan's\r\n  husband was personally served on February 23, 2005; however, both Bryan and her\r\n  husband filed statements indicating no such service was ever effected and they\r\n  were unaware of the existence of the suit.Â  \r\nOn April 28, 2005, the clerk of the Florida trial court entered a\r\n  default against Bryan individually, doing business as Technamax.Â  Upon\r\n  receiving notice of United's motion to convert the clerk's default into a final\r\n  judgment, Bryan filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.Â  On United's\r\n  motion, the trial court struck Bryan's motion as an improper pleading.Â  Bryan\r\n  retained attorney Peter Graham to represent her in the Florida trial court, but\r\n  when attorney Graham failed to appear, a default judgment was entered by the\r\n  circuit court against Bryan.Â  Bryan then retained attorney Paul Hitchens, who\r\n  appeared on her behalf and persuaded the Florida trial court to enter an order\r\n  setting aside the default judgment, striking Bryan's improper pro se motion,\r\n  and giving Bryan leave to file an answer.Â  United appealed this order, arguing\r\n  the Florida trial court had abused its discretion in granting Bryan relief\r\n  because she had failed to make a showing of excusable neglect.Â  The Florida\r\n  appellate court agreed, reversing and remanding the suit for reinstatement of\r\n  the default judgment.Â  Subsequently, Hitchens signed a stipulation on Bryan's\r\n  behalf requesting the Florida trial court enter an order reinstating the\r\n  default judgment.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  South Carolina Filing of Judgment\r\nIn April 2007, United filed its notice of filing of its Florida\r\n  judgment against Bryan in South Carolina.Â  Bryan responded with a motion to dismiss\r\n  or stay, seeking a determination the Florida judgment was invalid and,\r\n  therefore, not entitled to full faith and credit.[2]Â  The\r\n  master-in-equity heard arguments on Bryan's motions in December 2007.[3]Â \r\n  Finding Bryan submitted to the jurisdiction of the Florida court when she\r\n  stipulated to re-entry of the default judgment, the master ultimately denied\r\n  her motion to dismiss and found her motion to stay moot.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nAn action to enforce a foreign judgment is an action at law.Â  Minorplanet Sys. USA Ltd.\r\n  v. Am. Aire, Inc., 368 S.C. 146, 149, 628 S.E.2d 43, 44-45&nbsp;(2006).Â  In\r\n  an action at law tried by a master, an appellate court will correct any error\r\n  of law but must affirm the master's factual findings unless no evidence reasonably\r\n  supports those findings.Â  Sea Cabins on the Ocean IV Homeowners Ass'n v.\r\n    City of N. Myrtle Beach, 337 S.C. 380, 388, 523 S.E.2d 193, 197&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 1999); Twelfth RMA Partners, L.P. v. Nat'l Safe Corp., 335 S.C.\r\n  635, 639, 518 S.E.2d 44, 46&nbsp;(Ct.

Leasing Corp. v. Taylor, 326 S.C. 529, 532, 484 S.E.2d 595, 597 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1997); see U.S. Const. art. IV, Â§ 1 (&quot;Full Faith and Credit\r\n  shall be given in each State to the public acts, records, and judicial\r\n  proceedings of every other State.&quot;).&nbsp; \r\nA judgment debtor in South Carolina &quot;may file a motion for\r\n  relief from, or notice of defense to, the foreign judgment . . . on any . . . ground[s]\r\n  for which relief from a judgment of this State is allowed. . . .Â  The South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply.Â  The judgment creditor has the burden\r\n  of proving that the foreign judgment is entitled to full faith and\r\n  credit.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-940 (2005).Â  However, &quot;[i]f [a\r\n  judgment] appears on its face to be a record of a court of general\r\n  jurisdiction, such jurisdiction over the cause and the parties is to be\r\n  presumed unless disproved by extrinsic evidence, or by the record\r\n  itself.&quot;Â  Taylor v. Taylor, 229 S.C. 92, 97, 91 S.E.2d 876, 879\r\n  (1956).Â  If a party successfully proves a judgment is void, then &quot;[o]n\r\n  motion and upon such terms as are just,&quot; a South Carolina court may\r\n  relieve the party from his obligations under that judgment.&nbsp; Rule\r\n  60(b)(4), SCRCP.&nbsp;\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Personal Jurisdiction \r\nSouth Carolina law holds &quot;[t]he Full Faith and Credit Clause\r\n  does not prevent the litigation of personal jurisdiction in an action to\r\n  enforce a foreign judgment&quot; if the party did not make a general appearance\r\n  in the foreign jurisdiction.Â  Col. Pac. Leasing, 326 S.C. at 532-33, 484\r\n  S.E.2d at 596-97 (&quot;Only a defendant who 'remains aloof' by not making an\r\n  appearance and has a default judgment entered against him may contest the issue\r\n  of personal jurisdiction in a later proceeding.&quot;).Â  By the same token, a\r\n  party who &quot;appears [in the foreign jurisdiction] to litigate the merits\r\n  without properly preserving an objection to personal jurisdiction waives the\r\n  right to raise the objection in the initial proceeding and is bound by the\r\n  resulting judgment.&quot;Â  Id. at 533, 484 S.E.2d at 597 (quoting 18 Charles\r\n  A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and\r\n    Procedure Â§ 4430 (1981)).Â  Similarly, in Florida, &quot;although a court\r\n  has already entered judgment, a party waives the right to contest personal\r\n  jurisdiction by entering a general appearance without contesting personal\r\n  jurisdiction at the same time.&quot;Â  Johnson v. State Dep't of Revenue ex\r\n    rel. Lamontagne, 973 So. 2d 1236, 1239 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2008).Â  \r\nIn determining whether a party made a general appearance in the\r\n  foreign jurisdiction, the laws of the state that rendered the judgment must be\r\n  applied.&nbsp; Loyd &amp; Ring's Wholesale Nursery, Inc. v. Long &amp;\r\n    Woodley Landscaping &amp; Garden Ctr., Inc., 315 S.C. 88, 91, 431 S.E.2d\r\n  632, 634 (Ct. App. 1993) (&quot;The validity and effect of a foreign judgment\r\n  must be determined by the laws of the state that rendered the\r\n  judgment.&quot;).&nbsp; In Florida, absent a contemporaneous challenge to\r\n  personal jurisdiction, a motion to vacate a default judgment constitutes a\r\n  general appearance and a waiver of the right to contest personal jurisdiction.Â  Buttigieg v. Prunetti, 610 So. 2d 667, 669 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1992); see\r\n    also Bay City Mgmt., Inc. v. Henderson, 531 So. 2d 1013, 1016 (Fla. Dist.\r\n  Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\nWe affirm the master's finding the Florida judgment was valid\r\n  because Bryan waived her right to challenge personal jurisdiction.Â  Bryan\r\n  argues Florida lacked personal jurisdiction over her because she had no contacts\r\n  with Florida, no business dealings therein, and no relationship with United.[4]Â  Nonetheless, the evidence before us supports\r\n  the master's finding Bryan waived her right to contest personal jurisdiction\r\n  under Florida law.Â  Not only did Bryan move the Florida trial court to set\r\n  aside the default judgment against her, but through counsel, she submitted to\r\n  re-entry of the default judgment.Â  See Johnson, 973 So. 2d at\r\n  1239; Buttigieg, 610 So. 2d at 669; Bay City Mgmt., 531 So. 2d at\r\n  1016.Â  Bryan argues by raising the issue of personal jurisdiction in her\r\n  initial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, she preserved her right to contest\r\n  personal jurisdiction.Â  However, the Florida trial court struck this motion as\r\n  an improper pleading.Â  The order striking this pleading was neither reversed\r\n  nor otherwise modified.Â  Consequently, the issues raised in the stricken\r\n  pleading were not properly before the Florida trial court.Â  See George\r\n    J. Karr, D.D.S., P.A. v. Sellers, 620 So. 2d 1104, 1105 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.\r\n  1993) (holding trial court's striking of defensive pleading rendered default\r\n  judgment proper).Â  Having waived her right to contest this issue in Florida,\r\n  Bryan is precluded from raising it in a collateral attack in South Carolina.Â  See Col. Pac. Leasing, 326 S.C. at 533, 484 S.E.2d at 597.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  master did not err in finding Bryan waived her challenge to the Florida court's\r\n  exercise of personal jurisdiction.Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction \r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the &quot;power to hear and\r\n  determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question\r\n  belong.&quot;&nbsp; Dove v. Gold Kist, 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d\r\n  598, 600 (1994); see also In re D.N.H.W., 955 So. 2d 1236, 1238\r\n  (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2007) (holding subject matter jurisdiction is conferred by\r\n  statute or constitution and not by consent of the parties).Â  To the extent an\r\n  objection to subject matter jurisdiction challenges a court's authority to hear\r\n  a certain class of cases, that objection may not be waived.Â  Pastor v.\r\n    Pastor, 929 So. 2d 576, 578 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006).Â  However,\r\n  &quot;[i]f a court has subject matter jurisdiction and that jurisdiction has\r\n  been properly invoked by pleadings and properly perfected by service of\r\n  process, its judgments, although erroneous as to law or fact and subject to\r\n  reversal on appeal, are nevertheless not void.&quot;Â  Palmer v. Palmer,\r\n  479 So. 2d 221, 221 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985).Â  Both South Carolina law and\r\n  Florida law hold void a judgment of a court lacking subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.&nbsp; Thomas &amp; Howard Co. v. T.W. Graham &amp; Co.,\r\n  318 S.C. 286, 291, 457 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1995); Zitani v. Reed, 992 So.\r\n  2d 403, 409 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2008).&nbsp; \r\nAlthough the master did not expressly rule on the issue of subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction, it is properly before this court nonetheless.Â  Subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.Â  GNOC Corp. v. Estate of\r\n    Rhyne, 312 S.C. 86, 88, 439 S.E.2d 274, 275 (1994).Â  Subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction is rebuttably presumed to exist in foreign judgments presented for\r\n  enforcement in South Carolina.Â  Taylor, 229 S.C. at 97, 91 S.E.2d at\r\n  879.Â  However, the record contains no evidence sufficient to rebut the\r\n  presumption that the Florida court was empowered to hear a Florida company's action\r\n  to collect a debt from a foreign judgment debtor.Â  Consequently, the master did\r\n  not err in finding the Florida judgment was valid and entitled to full faith\r\n  and credit in South Carolina.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Remaining\r\n  Issues \r\nBryan asserts the master erred in declining to dismiss the Florida\r\n  judgment because Florida was an inconvenient forum and the judgment was\r\n  obtained by fraud.Â  We decline to reach these issues because they are\r\n  unpreserved.\r\nFor an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have\r\n  been raised to and ruled upon by the master-in-equity.Â  Ellie, Inc. v.\r\n    Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 102-03, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  An\r\n  appellate court will not consider any issue upon which the master did not\r\n  rule.Â  Id. at 103, 594 S.E.2d at 498.Â  If an issue is raised to the\r\n  trial court but not addressed in the court's final order, that issue is only\r\n  preserved for appellate review if raised in a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  West v. Newberry Elec. Coop., 357 S.C. 537, 543, 593 S.E.2d 500,\r\n  503 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nHere, Bryan raised these issues in her motion to dismiss or stay.Â \r\n  However, the master ruled on only one issue, finding Bryan failed to present\r\n  proof sufficient to overcome the presumption favoring the validity of the\r\n  foreign judgment.Â  The record does not indicate the master made any additional\r\n  rulings or Bryan raised her additional issues in a Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Rather,\r\n  Bryan's January 28, 2008, notice of appeal suggests the opposite.Â  That\r\n  document reflects the master heard and orally denied her motion to dismiss on\r\n  December 3, 2007, and her appeal was from the written order of that denial,\r\n  which she received January 19, 2008.Â  Because the master did not rule on these\r\n  issues and Bryan failed to raise them in a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), they\r\n  are unpreserved and not properly before this court.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find evidence in the record supports the master's decision that\r\n  Florida properly exercised personal and subject matter jurisdiction over Bryan.Â \r\n  Therefore, we affirm the order of the master-in-equity on this matter.Â  We\r\n  decline to reach Bryan's remaining issues because the master did not rule on\r\n  them and Bryan failed to preserve them through a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e).\r\n  Â Accordingly, the order of the master is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] United's complaint was dated January 18, 2004, but\r\n  &quot;2004&quot; appears to be a scrivener's error.Â  The document bears a 2005\r\n  case number and prays for interest on the debt beginning June 4, 2004.Â Â Â  \r\n[2] Bryan attempted to represent both herself and\r\n  Technamax but was advised South Carolina law does not permit a pro se litigant\r\n  to represent a corporation.Â  Therefore, her appearance applied only to\r\n  herself.Â  \r\n[3] The master indicated he made his decision based on\r\n  the pleadings, and no court reporter was present at this hearing.Â \r\n  Consequently, no transcript is available for our review.Â Â Â  \r\n[4] Additionally, Bryan asserts she never did business in\r\n  Florida and she neither resided in Florida nor received service of process\r\n  there.Â  The issue of personal jurisdiction subsumes these additional\r\n  arguments.Â  Because we find Bryan waived her right to challenge personal\r\n  jurisdiction, we do not address these arguments individually.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-394","title":"State v.

Clements, III., of Florence, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this criminal\r\n  case from Marion County, Glenn Q. Pernell appeals his conviction and sentence\r\n  for trafficking in cocaine and trafficking in crack cocaine.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n  AND PROCEDURE\r\nOn\r\n  August 2, 2006, police conducted a &quot;controlled buy&quot; in which\r\n  Appellant allegedly sold crack cocaine to a female confidential informant.Â Â \r\n  Five hours later, after obtaining an arrest warrant, police staked out the\r\n  Imperial Motel in Marion, S.C., knowing that the confidential informant and\r\n  Appellant were scheduled to meet at that location.[1] \r\nAppellant\r\n  arrived at the motel in a white Ford Crown Victoria with two male passengers.Â \r\n  Leaving the passengers in the vehicle, Appellant entered the motel lobby, where\r\n  the police approached him to execute the arrest warrant.Â  A search of Appellant\r\n  incident to his arrest yielded two bags of marijuana.[2]Â  Meanwhile,\r\n  other officers searched the Crown Victoria, finding a black pouch containing\r\n  cocaine, crack cocaine and scales on the driver's seat.Â  \r\nWhile still at the scene, police read\r\n  Appellant Miranda warnings, which he indicated he understood, and\r\n  inquired about the black pouch.Â  Appellant initially confessed ownership of the\r\n  pouch and its contents; however, moments later he recanted this statement and\r\n  claimed the pouch and drugs were not his and that he had not arrived in the Crown\r\n  Victoria.Â  He suggested the person who drove up in the vehicle must have fled\r\n  through a nearby field. \r\nAs\r\n  a result of the controlled buy, Appellant was indicted for distribution of\r\n  crack (the distribution charge).Â  Furthermore, based on the incidents\r\n  surrounding his arrest, Appellant was also indicted for: (1) trafficking in\r\n  cocaine 100-200 grams; (2) possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute\r\n  in close proximity to a school; (3) trafficking in crack cocaine 28-100 grams;\r\n  and (4) possession of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute in close\r\n  proximity to a school (collectively referred to as the trafficking and\r\n  proximity charges). [3] \r\nTrial\r\n  on this matter began on February 27, 2007.Â  Based on discovery delays, the\r\n  trial court granted a motion for a continuance of the distribution charge but\r\n  denied a continuance as to the trafficking and proximity charges. \r\nAppellant\r\n  made a motion in limine to suppress any testimony about the controlled buy and\r\n  offered to stipulate to the existence of a valid arrest warrant.Â  The trial\r\n  court denied the motion, finding the testimony about the controlled buy\r\n  admissible as &quot;an integral part of [the State's] case to show the basis\r\n  for the arrest.&quot;Â  However, the trial court offered a limiting instruction\r\n  in which the jury was informed that the evidence was being offered only\r\n  &quot;for the basis of showing further arrest.&quot; \r\nThe trial court permitted testimony\r\n  regarding Appellant's possession of marijuana as well as testimony that the\r\n  police believed he may have been armed with a pistol when he arrived at the\r\n  motel.[4]Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the close of the trial, Appellant's motion for a mistrial was denied.Â \r\n  Appellant was found guilty of two counts of trafficking.Â  The trial court\r\n  sentenced him to twenty-five years on each charge to run consecutively.Â  The\r\n  Appellant's motion to reconsider the sentence was denied.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n  ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI. \r\n\t\t\tDid\r\n  the trial court err in admitting testimony about the controlled buy,\r\n  Appellant's possession of marijuana, and the police's belief that Appellant may\r\n  have been carrying a pistol?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.\r\n\t\t\tDid\r\n  the trial court err in denying Appellant's motion for a mistrial?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid\r\n  the trial court err in sentencing Appellant to consecutive twenty-five year\r\n  prison terms?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  Thus, an\r\n  appellate court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are\r\n  clearly erroneous.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nAppellant alleges the trial court erred\r\n  in allowing testimony regarding the drug buy, the marijuana discovered during\r\n  his arrest, and the police's belief that he may have been carrying a pistol\r\n  when he arrived at the motel.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe admission of evidence is in the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial court, and its decision will not be disturbed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006); State v. Gaster, 340 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87,\r\n  93 (2002).Â  In order to reverse the trial court's admission of evidence we must\r\n  find: (1) an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court; and (2) likely\r\n  prejudice. State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 21, 596 S.E.2d 475,\r\n  478&nbsp;(2004).Â  A trial court abuses its discretion when its conclusions lack\r\n  evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law. Pagan, 369\r\n  S.C. at 208, 631 S.E.2d at 265; State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325,\r\n  540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000). \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The controlled\r\n  drug buy\r\nAppellant avers that the trial court\r\n  erred in admitting testimony regarding the prior drug transaction with the\r\n  confidential informant.[5]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, &quot;evidence of other\r\n  distinct crimes committed by the accused may not be adduced merely to raise an\r\n  inference or to corroborate the prosecution's theory of the defendant's guilt\r\n  of the particular crime charged.&quot;Â  State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406,\r\n  415, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923); see also Rule 404(b), SCRE (1976)\r\n  (&quot;Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts . . . may . . .Â  be admissible\r\n  to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence\r\n  of mistake or accident, or intent.&quot;).Â  In addition, &quot;evidence of\r\n  other bad acts or other crimes may be admitted under the res gestae theory[.]&quot; State v. Martucci, 380 S.C. 232, 257, 669 S.E.2d 598,\r\n  611 (Ct. App. 2008); State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 122, 470 S.E.2d 366,\r\n  370-71 (1996). Res gestae allows for the admission of prior bad acts\r\n  when the prior acts are an &quot;integral part of the crime . . . charged or\r\n  may be needed to aid the fact finder in understanding the context in which the\r\n  crime occurred.&quot; Martucci, 380 S.C. at 258, 669 S.E.2d at 612; State\r\n    v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 652, 552 S.E.2d 745, 753 (2001), overruled on\r\n      other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494\r\n  (2005); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 527-28, 608 S.E.2d 435, 439 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 379-80, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794-95\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nHere, the trial court found that\r\n  testimony about the controlled buy, which occurred just five hours prior, was\r\n  an integral part of the case to show the basis for the arrest.Â  This evidence\r\n  was relevant to understanding the context in which the crime occurred as it\r\n  explained why the confidential informant was at the motel[6] and how and\r\n  why she recognized the black bag and the Crown Victoria.Â Â  In light of\r\n  Appellant's conflicting statements as to whether he drove the Crown Victoria and\r\n  owned the bag containing the drugs, the evidence of the controlled buy offered\r\n  by the confidential informant demonstrated that when purchasing crack during\r\n  the controlled buy she saw Appellant in possession of the black bag and noticed\r\n  the white Crown Victoria parked in front of his residence.Â  There was no\r\n  attempt by the State to introduce the video or audio surveillance of the controlled\r\n  buy.Â Â  Moreover, the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury that the only\r\n  purpose for the evidence was to demonstrate the basis for the arrest.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; The marijuana and\r\n  testimony regarding the belief Appellant was armed\r\nAppellant alleges that it was error for\r\n  the trial court to introduce testimony that police found marijuana on his\r\n  person when he was searched incident to his arrest and that they believed he\r\n  may have been armed.Â  We find these arguments abandoned on appeal.\r\nAppellant makes a conclusory argument\r\n  that the prejudice of this testimony is manifest and brings no legal authority\r\n  to this Court's attention to support his position.Â  Accordingly, these\r\n  arguments are abandoned. See Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co.,\r\n  370 S.C. 578, 599, 635 S.E.2d 649, 660 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding that when an\r\n  appellant made only a conclusory argument and cited no legal authority the\r\n  issue was abandoned); Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting that failure to cite legal authority\r\n  for a position and making conclusory arguments results in an abandonment of the\r\n  issue on appeal).[7] Â \r\nII.\r\nAppellant\r\n  contends it was error to deny his motion for a new trial or mistrial based on\r\n  the errors alleged above.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nInitially we note that not all of\r\n  Appellant's arguments are preserved for appeal.Â  At trial, Appellant moved the\r\n  court &quot;for a new trial or for a mistrial . . . [because] the testimony\r\n  concerning the distribution charge was highly prejudicial.&quot; Â Because\r\n  Appellant did not move for a mistrial based on the testimony about the\r\n  marijuana or the pistol, the only argument preserved for appeal is whether the\r\n  admission of the testimony regarding the controlled buy should warrant the\r\n  granting of a mistrial.Â  See S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. First Carolina\r\n    Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301-02, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007)\r\n  (demonstrating that in order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review\r\n  it must be both raised to and ruled on by the trial court); Payne v. Payne,\r\n  382 S.C. 62, 70, 674 S.E.2d 515, 519 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating that &quot;issues\r\n  not raised and ruled upon by the trial court will not be considered on\r\n  appeal&quot;); see also State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 119, 485\r\n  S.E.2d 360, 366 (1997) (noting a party cannot argue one ground below and then\r\n  argue a different ground on appeal).\r\nThe\r\n  decision to grant or deny a motion for a mistrial is in the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial court and will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion\r\n  amounting to an error of law. State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 33, 615\r\n  S.E.2d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Garrett, 350 S.C. 613, 619,\r\n  567 S.E.2d 523, 526&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002) (stating generally the grant or\r\n  refusal of a new trial is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal without a clear abuse of that discretion).Â  In light of our\r\n  decision that it was not an abuse of discretion to admit the testimony\r\n  regarding the controlled buy, the trial court correctly denied Appellant's\r\n  motion for a mistrial.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nFinally\r\n  Appellant alleges that it was error to impose consecutive sentences.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nA\r\n  trial judge is granted broad discretion in determining a sentence. State v.\r\n    Franklin, 267 S.C. 240, 246, 226 S.E.2d 896, 898 (1976); State v. Barton,\r\n  325 S.C. 522, 532, 481 S.E.2d 439, 444 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The scope of the trial\r\n  court's ability to inquire about information on sentencing is nearly\r\n  &quot;unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider, or the\r\n  source from which it may come.&quot; Franklin, 267 S.C. at 246, 226\r\n  S.E.2d at 898.Â  &quot;Likewise whether multiple sentences should run\r\n  consecutively or concurrently is a matter left to the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial judge.&quot; Barton, 325 S.C. at 532, 481 S.E.2d at 444.Â \r\n  Moreover, absent &quot;partiality, prejudice, oppression or corrupt motive,\r\n  this Court lacks jurisdiction to disturb a sentence that is within the limit\r\n  prescribed by statute.&quot; Id.; accord Stockton v. Leeke,\r\n  269 S.C. 459, 462, 237 S.E.2d 896, 897 (1997); Franklin, 267 S.C. at\r\n  246, 226 S.E.2d at 898. \r\nThe\r\n  trial court considered the circumstances of this case and determined the\r\n  sentences should run consecutively.Â  The record does not support, and Appellant\r\n  does not allege, the sentence was the product of any partiality, prejudice,\r\n  oppression, or corrupt motive.Â  Accordingly, while the sentence imposed is\r\n  admittedly substantial, in the absence of an abuse of discretion, this Court is\r\n  without authority to disturb it.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause\r\n  the testimony concerning the controlled buy was admissible, and the other\r\n  arguments abandoned, Appellant's motion for mistrial was properly denied.Â \r\n  Moreover, we find no error in the trial court's imposition of consecutive\r\n  sentences.Â  Accordingly, the ruling of the trial court is AFFIRMED.Â  \r\nSHORT, THOMAS and GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; It\r\n  appears that in order to alleviate Appellant's suspicion the confidential\r\n  informant agreed to meet Appellant at the motel under a promise of sexual\r\n  intercourse.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Police\r\n  found one bag in Appellant's pocket and Appellant discarded another bag after\r\n  seeing police approaching in the motel lobby.Â Â Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; It is\r\n  not disputed that the Imperial Motel is within oneâ€“half mile of Mullins Primary\r\n  School as prescribed by Section 44-53-445(B)(1) of the Code of Laws of South\r\n  Carolina.\r\n[4]&nbsp; No\r\n  firearm was found on Appellant's person or in his vehicle; however, police discovered\r\n  ammunition in the vehicle.\r\n[5]&nbsp; Appellant\r\n  alleges that it was error to allow testimony about the controlled buy under the\r\n  common scheme or plan exception.Â  However, the record indicates that the court\r\n  did not admit the evidence to show a common scheme or plan. \r\n[6]&nbsp; Evidence\r\n  indicates that during the controlled buy, the informant feigned interest in\r\n  meeting Appellant at the hotel later in the day for sexual relations in order\r\n  to ease his suspicion.Â  \r\n[7]&nbsp; Moreover,\r\n  notwithstanding the abandonment of these arguments, in light of the\r\n  overwhelming evidence of guilt and the fact that the evidence bore out that no\r\n  gun was found on Appellant, the admission of this testimony did not prejudice\r\n  Appellant. See State v. Hamilton, 368 S.C. 188, 213, 628 S.E.2d\r\n  482, 495 (Ct. App. 2006) (stating that this Court reviews errors in the context\r\n  of the record as a whole and when there exists overwhelming evidence of guilt,\r\n  we may affirm under the harmless error doctrine), overruled on other grounds\r\n    by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-395","title":"Kenneth W. v.

Armstrong, Family Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2009-UP-395\r\nHeard April 22, 2009 â€“ Filed July 20, 2009Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn Elliott, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tC. Cantzon Foster, II, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Gretchen\r\n  D. (Mother) appeals the family court's\r\n  order terminating her visitation rights with her daughter.Â  She asserts the\r\n  court erred in several evidentiary rulings.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nMother and Kenneth\r\n  W. (Father) were divorced by order filed February 4, 2004.Â  They had one child\r\n  together, Daughter, who was born March 24, 1998.Â  In the divorce decree, the\r\n  parties agreed Father would have sole custody of Daughter.Â  Mother was to have supervised\r\n  visitation initially, then unsupervised day-time visitation, and finally\r\n  unsupervised visitation for every other weekend, beginning April 9-11, 2004.Â \r\n  In addition, the order set out conditions for visitation that included: no\r\n  sleeping with Daughter, no nudity around Daughter or by Daughter, no bathing\r\n  with Daughter, and put appropriate clothing on Daughter.Â  The order provided\r\n  Daughter was to continue in therapy with Dr. Samer Touma and the parties were\r\n  to cooperate with Dr. Touma.Â  \r\nDr. Touma counseled\r\n  Daughter until he developed concerns about Daughter's relationship with\r\n  Mother.Â  He referred Daughter to Dr. Elin Berg, who specialized in areas of\r\n  abuse and neglect, which he did not work with at all. Dr. Touma also contacted\r\n  the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) concerning Daughter.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  Father felt that DSS was not acting quickly enough, his attorney arranged for\r\n  Daughter to meet with Donna Rudd, a counselor with the Family Resource Center,\r\n  on November 4, 2004.Â  Rudd testified that during the interview, Daughter\r\n  indicated that on more than one occasion while in the shower at the gym, Mother\r\n  made her touch Mother's breasts. \r\nDaughter\r\n  next saw Dr. Alicia Benedetto with the Assessment and Resource Center (ARC) on\r\n  November 10, 2004.Â  Daughter was referred to Dr. Benedetto by the Richland\r\n  County Sheriff's Office.Â  Daughter described the events in the shower similarly\r\n  to what she had related to Rudd.Â  Dr. Benedetto concluded Daughter had not made\r\n  any substantive disclosure of sexual abuse.Â  \r\nAlthough Father caused\r\n  Daughter to miss two scheduled visitations with Mother, Mother was able to have\r\n  Thanksgiving with Daughter and regular visitation resumed after that. \r\nFather testified\r\n  that on the weekend before Valentine's Day 2005, he picked Daughter up from\r\n  McDonald's after her visitation with Mother.Â  When they returned to the house,\r\n  Daughter gagged outside and then went into the house, where she vomited.Â \r\n  Father and his new wife (Stepmother) drew Daughter a bath.Â  Once she was in the\r\n  bathtub, Daughter began scrubbing herself vigorously and crying.Â  Believing\r\n  Daughter had been sexually abused, Father called DSS.Â  Daughter also reported\r\n  the incident to the guidance counselor at her school.Â  Daughter disclosed to\r\n  the court in an in camera interview Mother &quot;made her lick the dog's\r\n  private parts and . . . made her allow the dog to lick her private parts.&quot; \r\nMother strongly\r\n  denied she had sexually abused Daughter. She explained that with the shower incident\r\n  she and Daughter were taking showers in separate stalls after swimming. Â She\r\n  stated Daughter pulled aside her shower curtain and reached for Mother's\r\n  breasts.Â  Mother told her to stop and not do that again and Daughter complied. One\r\n  of Mother's neighbors testified that during the afternoon of the Sunday before\r\n  Valentine's Day, she watched Daughter for Mother so that Mother could work out\r\n  before a date. She stated when Mother picked up Daughter, her hair was wet and\r\n  she was dressed for her date. Â Mother testified that after she picked Daughter\r\n  up from the neighbor, they went back to her house for just a little while\r\n  because it was almost time to leave to take Daughter to meet Father.Â  She\r\n  asserted there was no time for the alleged incident with the dogs to take\r\n  place. \r\nWhen Father became\r\n  dissatisfied with the inaction of DSS and the Sheriff's Department, he filed a\r\n  complaint and a motion for pendente lite relief on February 28, 2005 asserting\r\n  Mother's visitation should be suspended pendente lite and permanently due to a\r\n  substantial change in circumstances.Â  Father alleged that Mother sexually\r\n  abused Daughter with acts involving her dogs.Â  Father requested an emergency\r\n  hearing and appointment of a guardian ad litem.Â  In her answer, Mother denied the\r\n  allegations of abuse and asserted a counterclaim seeking sole custody of\r\n  Daughter.Â  She alleged Father had attempted to sabotage her role as a parent by\r\n  making &quot;incessant reports and allegations of deviant or prurient\r\n  behavior,&quot; interrogating the child with highly suggestive questioning, and\r\n  involving counselors and therapists to aid and abet his campaign.Â  \r\nAfter an emergency\r\n  hearing, the family court suspended Mother's visitation.Â  The court appointed\r\n  C. Vance Stricklin as guardian ad litem and ordered the guardian to arrange for\r\n  psychological evaluations of the parties as soon as possible.Â  \r\nDr. A.\r\n  Nicholas DePace, the court-appointed psychologist, reported that in both of his\r\n  meetings with Daughter, she demonstrated significant responses consistent with\r\n  being distressed when Mother was the focus of the conversation.Â  She would\r\n  become tearful and hesitant to discuss Mother.Â  She became especially tearful\r\n  when discussing the incident with the dogs.Â  However, when Mother was not the\r\n  subject of the conversation, Daughter appeared very sociable, vibrant,\r\n  energetic, and intelligent.Â  Dr. DePace noticed some inconsistencies in\r\n  Daughter's reports of the incidents with the dogs, saying different names for\r\n  the dogs involved.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  Dr. DePace recommended Daughter have another evaluation, Father took Daughter\r\n  to Dr. Cynthia Brown in Asheville, North Carolina.Â  In addition, Daughter received\r\n  counseling from Dr. Lanette Atkins, who testified as an expert witness in the\r\n  trial.\r\nMother\r\n  presented two expert witnesses, Dr. Jonathan Gould and Dr. Allison DeFelice,\r\n  who criticized the methods used by the other evaluators and discussed the\r\n  reliability problems that could be caused by multiple evaluations.Â  \r\nThe final hearing\r\n  in this case was held the week of March 26, 2007.Â Â  The family court found a\r\n  substantial change in circumstances affecting Daughter had occurred and that\r\n  Mother's visitation should be terminated based on her acting inappropriately\r\n  with Daughter in at least two regards: &quot;(1)[Mother] required [Daughter] to\r\n  touch [Mother's] breasts, and (2) the incident with the dog or dogs.&quot;Â  The\r\n  court noted that despite Mother's defense contending the investigation and\r\n  interviews with Daughter were suggestive and repetitive, no evidence was\r\n  presented Daughter was asked any leading questions about deviant behavior with\r\n  dogs.Â  Furthermore, the family court held Mother presented no evidence Daughter\r\n  was coached or had been exposed to pornography.Â  The court ordered each party\r\n  to be responsible for his or her own expert fees and to divide equally the fees\r\n  for Dr. Touma, Dr. DePace, and the guardian.Â  In addition, the court ordered\r\n  Mother to pay $15,000.00 of Father's attorney's fees.Â  The court subsequently\r\n  denied Mother's motion to alter or amend.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, this court has the authority to find facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Wooten\r\n    v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005).Â  This broad scope\r\n  of review does not, however, require us to disregard the findings of the family\r\n  court which saw and heard the witnesses and generally is in a better position\r\n  to determine credibility.Â  Id.Â  In a custody dispute, the paramount factor\r\n  is the welfare and best interest of the child.Â  Fisher v. Miller, 288\r\n  S.C. 576, 578, 344 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1986).Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  admission of evidence is a matter left to the discretion of the trial judge\r\n  and, absent clear abuse, will not be disturbed on appeal.&quot;Â  Carlyle v.\r\n    Tuomey Hosp., 305 S.C. 187, 193, 407 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1991).Â  &quot;In\r\n  order for this court to reverse a case based on the erroneous admission or\r\n  erroneous exclusion of evidence the plaintiff must show error and\r\n  prejudice.&quot; Â Timmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Comm'n, 254 S.C. 378,\r\n  405, 175 S.E.2d 805, 819 (1970).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Exclusion of\r\n  evidence of acts occurring prior to divorce\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred in excluding evidence of Father's pattern of\r\n  false accusations of child abuse and involvement of the child in the inquiries\r\n  occurring prior to the parents' divorce.Â  \r\nFather\r\n  argues this issue is not properly before the court because Mother failed to\r\n  adequately proffer evidence concerning the past allegations that were deemed\r\n  unfounded. &quot;It is well settled that a reviewing court may not consider\r\n  error claimed in the exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows\r\n  fairly what the rejected testimony would have been.&quot;Â  Jamison v. Ford\r\n    Motor Co., 373 S.C. 248, 260, 644 S.E.2d 755, 761 (Ct. App. 2007), cert.\r\n      granted (July 10, 2008).Â  &quot;However, this rule regarding proffers has\r\n  been relaxed where the appellate court is able [to] determine from the record\r\n  what the testimony was intended to show and that prejudice clearly\r\n  exists.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nOn Father's motion in\r\n  limine, the family court ruled that generally the only relevant evidence\r\n  would be anything that occurred after the date of the divorce.Â  However, the\r\n  court stated it would reconsider its ruling if Mother established evidence of\r\n  events occurring before that time was relevant and encouraged Mother to\r\n  proffer.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  Father's testimony, Mother proffered that she had intended to elicit testimony\r\n  regarding the past reports of abuse by both Father and Mother and Father's\r\n  history of taking Daughter to therapists. Father took his wife and Daughter to\r\n  Tom Frisco around the date of the separation.Â  Father reported Daughter as\r\n  abused to DSS in August of 2001 and DSS deemed the report unfounded.Â  Mother\r\n  next reported Daughter as physically abused in October 4, 2001.Â  Father\r\n  reported Daughter as sexually abused on October 12, 2001.Â  He twice took\r\n  Daughter to Dr. DeFelice at the ARC in October of 2001 for interviews.Â  Mother\r\n  reported Daughter and Stepmother's children as abused on April 25, 2003.Â \r\n  Father took Daughter to another therapist in 2003.Â  The court then ordered an\r\n  evaluation of Daughter, after which she saw Dr. Touma between 2003 and 2004.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the close of Mother's case, she proffered the reports from DSS concerning the\r\n  above allegations.Â  The reports indicate DSS determined the allegations of\r\n  October 4, 2001 of physical abuse and of October 12, 2001 of sexual abuse by\r\n  Mother were unfounded.Â  The August 24, 2001 allegation of verbal abuse and\r\n  leaving Daughter unsupervised was originally determined to be founded but was\r\n  later dismissed. \r\nHere\r\n  the record shows sufficiently what the rejected testimony concerning the prior\r\n  allegations of abuse and Father's history of taking Daughter to therapists\r\n  would have been to allow this court to review the matter.Â  However, we do not\r\n  believe Mother sufficiently proffered testimony from Dr. DeFelice to support\r\n  her argument on appeal.Â  Mother asserts in her brief Dr. DeFelice was\r\n  prohibited from testifying about her direct involvement with Daughter and\r\n  Father in the 2001 allegation of sexual abuse.Â  In her proffered testimony, Dr.\r\n  DeFelice only stated that past allegations of abuse would be relevant to a\r\n  forensic evaluator in rendering an opinion. Â Thus, as Mother did not establish what\r\n  Dr. DeFelice would have related, other than the existence of the prior\r\n  allegations, we cannot review whether the family court erred in limiting Dr.\r\n  DeFelice's testimony.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find even if the family court erred in excluding the evidence, the error was\r\n  not prejudicial.Â  To warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of\r\n  evidence, the complaining party must prove both error and resulting prejudice.Â  Timmons v. S.C. Tricentennial Comm'n, 254 S.C. 378, 405, 175 S.E.2d 805,\r\n  819 (1970).Â  Although the family court did not allow testimony of the\r\n  allegations prior to the divorce, the temporary order states, &quot;[T]here\r\n  have been reports to DSS by [Father] concerning [Mother] which were unfounded.Â \r\n  I further find that only one of the reports involved a sexual abuse allegation,\r\n  which the minor child denied at that time.&quot; Â In addition, in describing\r\n  the documents and records he reviewed, Mother's expert, Dr. Gould, listed the\r\n  DSS reports.Â  Thus, evidence of the past unfounded reports was before the\r\n  family court.Â  \r\nMother\r\n  asserts her reason for wanting the evidence admitted:Â  &quot;The evidence of\r\n  other instances of unsubstantiated allegations made by the father is relevant\r\n  to whether he had a motive to make the allegations, whether his intent was to\r\n  deprive the mother of a relationship with the child, and whether there was a\r\n  pattern of examinations or interviews affecting the child irrespective of\r\n  motive or intent.&quot;Â  The family court admitted other testimony into\r\n  evidence that would similarly support Mother's case.Â  As to Father's motive and\r\n  his intent to deprive Mother of her relationship with Daughter, Dr. Touma\r\n  testified about the acrimony in the relationship of Father and Mother.Â  He\r\n  stated &quot;I think these two people hated each other more than they loved\r\n  [Daughter] sometimes . . . .&quot;Â  He added that their hostility spilled over\r\n  onto Daughter at times. Â In addition, the record is replete with evidence of\r\n  the numerous examinations and interviews to which Father took Daughter\r\n  following the divorce. Â Mother presented evidence from both Dr. DeFelice and\r\n  Dr. Gould that the numerous interviews could have corrupted Daughter's memory\r\n  and created reliability issues. \r\nMother\r\n  also asserts her experts were limited by the ruling.Â  However, Dr. Benedetto\r\n  testified that even without considering events that had occurred prior to the\r\n  divorce, she could still offer the same conclusions as she had stated in her\r\n  report. Â In addition, Dr. Benedetto was allowed to testify that she was\r\n  concerned for Daughter when she learned that Father had taken her for multiple\r\n  interviews and exams because that was not the best practice for a child.Â \r\n  Accordingly, Mother suffered no prejudice from the court's ruling as to Dr.\r\n  Benedetto's testimony.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  Mother failed to establish prejudice due to the family court's ruling, we find\r\n  no reversible error on this issue.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Expert\r\n  testimony concerning Daughter's credibility\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred by allowing Father's experts to comment on\r\n  whether Daughter was credible or truthful in interviews with them.Â  \r\n&quot;Generally,\r\n  '[w]hether a witness has qualified as an expert, and whether his opinion is\r\n  admissible on a fact in issue, are matters resting largely in the discretion of\r\n  the trial judge.'&quot;Â  Altman v. Griffith, 372 S.C. 388, 400, 642\r\n  S.E.2d 619, 625 (Ct. App. 2007) (citing Prince v. Associated Petroleum\r\n    Carriers, 262 S.C. 358, 365, 204 S.E.2d 575, 579 (1974)).Â  However, an\r\n  expert may not vouch for the credibility of a child sexual abuse victim.Â  S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Lisa C., 380 S.C. 406, 414, 669 S.E.2d 647, 651-52\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008) (finding psychologist improperly commented on child's\r\n  credibility by saying child &quot;'had no apparent motivation . . . to have a\r\n  false allegation,'&quot; and gave a &quot;'consistent disclosure'&quot;); see State v. Dawkins, 297 S.C. 386, 393-94, 377 S.E.2d 298, 302 (1989)\r\n  (finding improper therapist indication he believed victim's allegations were\r\n  genuine); State v. Dempsey, 340 S.C. 565, 571, 532 S.E.2d 306, 309 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000) (finding therapist's testimony children were being truthful in\r\n  ninety-five percent of instances in which sexual abuse was alleged was improper\r\n  vouching for child).\r\nThe\r\n  first statement to which Mother objects in her brief was Rudd's testimony that\r\n  Daughter was emphatic that she was telling the truth, and that no one had told\r\n  her what to say. Â Mother failed to object to this testimony.Â  Therefore, her\r\n  objection to this statement is not preserved.Â  \r\nMother\r\n  also asserts the family court committed error in allowing Rudd to testify she\r\n  saw no evidence Daughter had been coached, she found Daughter's interview\r\n  compelling, and there were indications of sexual abuse. Â Similarly, Mother\r\n  takes issue with portions of Dr. Atkins' testimony.Â  Dr. Atkins testified without\r\n  objection that one of the ways of determining whether a child is lying is to\r\n  look for inconsistencies, and Daughter had been very consistent.Â  The family\r\n  court allowed Dr. Atkins to testify, over Mother's objections, that in her\r\n  opinion Daughter had been truthful, had not been coached, and was not\r\n  exaggerating. \r\nHowever,\r\n  after this testimony, Father's attorney asked Dr. Atkins whether Daughter could\r\n  have made up the disclosures.Â  Dr. Atkins responded, without objection,\r\n  &quot;Could she make them up?Â  Sure.Â  Do I think she did?Â  No.&quot; Â She then\r\n  explained that Daughter's allegations would have been very unusual for a child\r\n  to make up and Daughter's physiological reactions when discussing the incidents\r\n  such as flushing and turning red all over would be difficult for a child to\r\n  make up. Â Dr. Atkins also testified without objection that Daughter had post-traumatic\r\n  stress disorder. \r\nIn\r\n  addition, on cross-examination by Mother, Dr. Atkins explained she had not\r\n  interviewed Mother because she thought Daughter's reports were very credible. Â On\r\n  cross-examination by the guardian, Dr. Atkins testified without objection it\r\n  was not likely that Daughter would have stated that at one point during the\r\n  incident with the dogs it had felt good if she had been coached.Â  Dr. Atkins\r\n  also testified without objection she found no evidence Daughter was fabricating\r\n  these stories to gain approval or positive reinforcement from anyone.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  court-appointed psychologist, Dr. DePace, stated in his report Daughter had not\r\n  demonstrated any behavior strongly indicating she was being coached by her\r\n  parents or anyone else. Â Similarly, the guardian reported he had not seen any\r\n  signs of coaching on the part of Father.Â  He noted that even Dr. Benedetto, who\r\n  was convinced sexual abuse had not occurred, did not believe coaching was\r\n  present. \r\nRudd\r\n  and Dr. Atkins both commented on Daughter's credibility.Â  However, their other\r\n  statements admitted without objection, and other witnesses' testimony\r\n  concerning a lack of coaching is cumulative to the improper statements.Â  Thus\r\n  we find the family court's admission of the improper statements is not\r\n  reversible error.Â  See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343\r\n  S.C. 129, 140, 538 S.E.2d 285, 290-91 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating when evidence is\r\n  merely cumulative to other evidence, its admission is harmless and does not\r\n  constitute reversible error).\r\nC.Â  In camera interview with Daughter\r\nMother argues the\r\n  family court deprived her of the opportunity to confront or challenge\r\n  Daughter's statements in any meaningful way by utilizing an in camera interview with Daughter.Â  She asserts the in camera interview violated her\r\n  due process rights. Â \r\nThe parties\r\n  discussed Daughter's testimony and the possibility of an in camera interview.Â  Both Father's and Mother's attorneys stated they preferred to have\r\n  Daughter take the stand and testify but Mother's attorney never asserted an in\r\n    camera interview would be a violation of Mother's due process rights.Â  Mother's\r\n  attorney suggested questions for the family court judge to ask.Â  The guardian\r\n  accompanied Daughter and the family court judge to chambers.Â  After the\r\n  interview, the family court judge reported for the record the conversation he\r\n  had with Daughter.Â  The family court judge stated he asked Daughter about the\r\n  good and bad times she had with each parent.Â  He related Daughter indicated\r\n  Mother had made her touch Mother's chest and also disclosed the incident with\r\n  the dogs.Â  The guardian confirmed the family court's recollection of the\r\n  interview.Â  \r\nThe family\r\n  court judge asked the attorneys if they had anything they wished to put on the\r\n  record as a result of the interview.Â  Mother's attorney did not offer any\r\n  objections at that time.Â  Not until her motion for a new trial did Mother\r\n  object to what Daughter told the family court judge in the interview regarding\r\n  the allegations, asserting she was deprived of the opportunity to confront the\r\n  allegations in a meaningful way.Â  In denying the motion, the family court judge\r\n  found Mother had waived any objection to the interview by failing to object\r\n  after the court recited for the record what was said in the interview and by\r\n  failing to request an opportunity to cross-examine Daughter. Â Failure to object\r\n  when evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to object.Â  Crawford\r\n    v. Crawford, 321 S.C. 511, 514, 469 S.E.2d 622, 624 (Ct. App. 1996). Â We\r\n  agree with the family court that Mother waived any arguments concerning the in\r\n    camera interview by failing to make a timely objection.\r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp; Testimony of\r\n  Dr. DeFelice\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred in failing to entertain expert testimony from Dr.\r\n  DeFelice on the likelihood of improper influence on the child's assertions.Â  \r\n\r\n\tDuring\r\n  Dr. DeFelice's testimony, Mother offered the following proffer:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tQ. In\r\n  terms of reliability of out-of-court statements made by [Daughter] to others,\r\n  can you say, within a reasonable degree of professional certainty, whether\r\n  [Daughter's] statements, over time, could be considered reliable?\r\n\t\tA. My\r\n  review of the information causes me, personally, as a forensic evaluator, great\r\n  concern about the reliability of her statements at this time in her development\r\n  regarding these allegations from the past.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe family court sustained\r\n  Father's objection to this testimony because Dr. DeFelice had no personal\r\n  knowledge concerning the allegations of this case and had not seen Daughter in\r\n  six years.Â  Although the court excluded this testimony, it did allow Dr.\r\n  DeFelice to testify how protocols of forensic interviewing of suspected child\r\n  abuse victims were deviated from and the effect of that deviation.Â  She stated\r\n  these deviations &quot;muddied the waters.&quot;Â  She related children ages\r\n  three to seven are particularly vulnerable and it creates serious issues of\r\n  memory and suggestibility.Â  She testified:\r\n\r\n\tNow, it\r\n  is my opinion that there very serious deviations in this case â€“I think the best\r\n  word I can use would be corrupt â€“corrupted the capacity of the child to render\r\n  statements not about just anything but about specific events that she's been\r\n  interviewed about repeatedly and under multiple irregular circumstances. \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  addition, she testified on cross-examination by the guardian: &quot;I rendered\r\n  the opinion that there is a protocol or that there are protocols and standards\r\n  for forensic evaluations and that, I believe, that they have not been followed and,\r\n  I believe, as a result that there is the potential reliability problem.&quot;Â \r\n  The family court allowed this testimony.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the family court excluded some testimony from Dr. DeFelice concerning the\r\n  reliability of Daughter's statements, she was allowed to testify that the\r\n  deviations from protocol &quot;corrupted the capacity of the child to render\r\n  statements&quot; and created a &quot;potential reliability problem.&quot;Â  We\r\n  find no significant difference between the testimony the family court allowed\r\n  and the testimony it did not allow.Â  Accordingly, we find no reversible error.Â  See Fields v. Reg'l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 31, 609\r\n  S.E.2d 506, 512 (2005) (stating an error in the exclusion of evidence may be\r\n  deemed harmless if the equivalent or cumulative testimony or evidence is\r\n  admitted).Â  \r\nIn addition, Mother\r\n  asserts in this section of her brief that the family court &quot;admitted all\r\n  manner of the child's hearsay statements through other witnesses in the\r\n  father's case.&quot; Â She fails, however, to call this court's attention to any\r\n  such statements in the record.Â  We find that if Mother is attempting to argue\r\n  the family court erred in admitting these statements, the argument is not\r\n  properly before this court.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR\r\n  (&quot;Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement\r\n  of issues on appeal.&quot;); Davis v. Tripp, 338 S.C. 226, 234, 525\r\n  S.E.2d 528, 532 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating appellant has the burden of showing\r\n  both error and prejudice).\r\nE.Â  Opinion of Dr. Atkins\r\nMother argues the\r\n  family court erred in allowing Dr. Atkins to testify that in her opinion\r\n  Daughter was the victim of child sexual abuse.Â  She asserts that because Dr.\r\n  Atkins' assessment of Daughter was one-sided and only presented Father's side\r\n  of the story, Dr. Atkins' testimony was more prejudicial than probative.Â  Dr.\r\n  Atkins did not personally interview Mother but did read Mother's deposition.Â \r\n  Mother's expert, Dr. Gould, testified that when an evaluator has information\r\n  from only one parent, it biases him or her to generate hypotheses only from the\r\n  perspective of that one parent.Â  Dr. Gould also stated that on the issues of\r\n  judgment and credibility, mental health professionals are no better than the\r\n  general public at being able to identify who is and who is not telling the\r\n  truth. \r\nDr.\r\n  Atkins acknowledged that in ideal circumstances, she would have interviewed\r\n  Mother also, but in this case, she relied on records of treating or other\r\n  evaluating professionals.Â  She asserted that the fact she did not speak with\r\n  Mother was not an impediment to her evaluation. Â \r\nIn Terwilliger\r\n  v. Terwilliger, the father asserted the family court erred in giving undue\r\n  consideration to the mother's expert witness, a clinical psychologist, who tested\r\n  the child, her grandparents, and the mother but did not test the father or\r\n  communicate with him.Â  298 S.C. 144, 147, 378 S.E.2d 609, 611 (Ct. App. 1989). Â This\r\n  court found the father's argument\r\n  concerned the question of credibility and the probative value to be placed upon\r\n  the testimony of the psychologist. Â We held: Â &quot;Resolving questions of\r\n  credibility is a function of the family court judge who heard the testimony. Â Similarly,\r\n  the fact finder determines the weight to be given testimony.&quot; Â Id. Â (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  Thus, we concluded the family court did not err in assessing the\r\n  probative value of the psychologist's testimony. Â Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  the family court was able to consider Mother's experts' criticism of Dr.\r\n  Atkins' failure to interview Mother as well as Dr. Atkins' explanation that the\r\n  fact she did not speak with Mother was not an impediment to her evaluation.Â  We\r\n  hold, as we did in Terwilliger, the family court did not abuse its discretion\r\n  in determining the expert's testimony was more probative than prejudicial.Â  \r\nF.&nbsp; Exclusion of\r\n  deposition\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred in refusing to admit the deposition testimony of\r\n  a psychiatrist who examined Daughter and had previously rendered an opinion as\r\n  to whether she was a victim of child sexual abuse.Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Elin Berg was the psychiatrist with whom Daughter counseled following the\r\n  allegations of sexual abuse.Â  During Dr. Gould's testimony, Mother sought to\r\n  have admitted the following:\r\n\r\n\tQ. Dr.\r\n  Berg, in your opinion, did the sexual abuse occur?\r\n\tA.Â  I\r\n  don't know.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  guardian actually quoted the same language from Dr. Berg's deposition in his\r\n  report.Â  Accordingly, as we cannot see how Mother was prejudiced by this ruling,\r\n  we need not address whether the trial court erred in excluding the deposition excerpt\r\n  during Dr. Gould's testimony. Â See Fields, 363 S.C. at 31, 609\r\n  S.E.2d at 512 (stating an error in the exclusion of evidence may be deemed\r\n  harmless if the equivalent or cumulative testimony or evidence is admitted).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the above stated the reasons, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-396","title":"McPeake Hotels, Inc. v.

School Dist. of Greenville County,\r\n  382 S.C. 8, 14, 675 S.E.2d 439, 442 (2009) (&quot;A landowner has the burden of\r\n  proving damages for the taking of the landowner's property, whether through\r\n  condemnation proceedings or by inverse condemnation.&quot;); WRB Ltd. P'ship\r\n    v. County of Lexington, 369 S.C. 30, 32, 630 S.E.2d 479, 481 (2006)\r\n  (in order to prevail in an inverse condemnation action, the plaintiff must\r\n  prove an affirmative, aggressive, and positive act by the government, causing\r\n  the alleged damage to the plaintiff's property); Raven v. Greenville County,\r\n  315 S.C. 447, 465, 434 S.E.2d 296, 307 (Ct. App. 1993) (stating the measure of\r\n  damages for injury to real property, whether by nuisance, trespass, negligence,\r\n  or inverse condemnation is the diminution in the market value of the property).Â  \r\n2.Â \r\n  As to the remaining claim for injunctive relief, McPeake failed to challenge\r\n  the grounds upon which the trial court based its decision to deny the request\r\n  for an injunction. Â See Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v. Miller Hous.\r\n    Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (providing &quot;an\r\n  unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of this case.&quot;). Â Moreover,\r\n  on appeal, McPeake merely argues a governmental entity is not precluded from\r\n  being enjoined based on sovereign immunity. Â See Anderson v. Short,\r\n  323 S.C. 522, 525, 476 S.E.2d 475, 477 (1996) (holding when a trial court's\r\n  decision is based on multiple grounds, the appellate court will affirm unless\r\n  the appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will become the\r\n  law of the case).Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's denial of\r\n  injunctive relief as it is the law of the case.\r\nAFFIRMED.[4]\r\nHUFF,\r\n  PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â This appeal\r\n  does not involve any claim against Jasper's Porch, Inc.\r\n[2] Although McPeake\r\n  argued the motion for summary judgment was premature in its memorandum in\r\n  opposition to the motion, the trial court never addressed this issue and\r\n  McPeake did not raise the issue in its Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Accordingly, this\r\n  issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v.\r\n    Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (stating issue cannot be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal but must have been raised to and ruled upon\r\n  by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review). Â We further note that\r\n  a motion for continuance was never filed by McPeake.Â  Nonetheless, there was\r\n  ample time to conduct discovery as this action was pending for more than one\r\n  year and McPeake even acknowledged in its interrogatories four months prior to\r\n  the hearing that it would likely retain an expert to testify concerning\r\n  damages. \r\n[3] See Upchurch\r\n  v. New York Times, 314 S.C. 531, 538, 431 S.E.2d 558, 562 (1993) (â€œWe may\r\n  affirm the trial judge for any reason appearing in the record.â€) (citing Rule\r\n  220(c), SCACR).\r\n[4] The Town of\r\n  Ridgeland asked this court to review its denial of the motion to strike the\r\n  deposition pages filed after the trial court orally granted summary judgment.Â \r\n  Because these pages were filed after the trial court granted summary judgment,\r\n  we agree these pages were untimely.Â  See Higgins v.

and A.B., currently age four.Â  In November 2003, while\r\n  the family was living in North Carolina, Father was arrested and incarcerated for\r\n  committing statutory rape a year earlier.Â  In May 2004, Father was convicted\r\n  and sentenced to serve fifteen years and two months in prison.Â Â Â  \r\nSubsequently, Mother\r\n  and Children moved to South Carolina.Â  In approximately December 2004, the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) intervened and placed\r\n  Children with their maternal grandparents.Â  On March 15, 2005, the family court\r\n  conducted a hearing on the merits of removing Children from Mother.Â  Mother\r\n  attended the hearing, but Father did not.Â  According to the family court's\r\n  order, Father was &quot;incarcerated in North Carolina and could not be\r\n  transported.&quot;Â  The family court found Mother's medical and physical\r\n  neglect of Children constituted harm justifying their removal from her, and it adopted\r\n  a placement plan submitted by DSS.Â  The placement plan's &quot;findings of harm\r\n  justifying removal and intervention&quot; and treatment goals related to\r\n  &quot;removal conditions&quot; concerned only Mother.Â  On the other hand, findings\r\n  &quot;justifying intervention,&quot; and goals related to those findings,\r\n  concerned Mother and Father.Â  The family court ordered Mother to complete an\r\n  extensive placement plan and to pay child support.Â  Grandparents received temporary\r\n  legal and physical custody of Children.Â  In addition, the placement plan\r\n  required Father to have &quot;no contact, direct or indirect, with [Children]\r\n  until [he] is assessed by a sex offender therapist upon release from jail.&quot;Â \r\n  The family court held in abeyance other findings regarding Father and determination\r\n  of Father's child support obligation.Â  Also, the family court ordered\r\n  appointment of legal counsel and a guardian ad litem (GAL) for Father.Â  \r\nOn September 8, 2005, the family court conducted a merits\r\n  removal hearing to review &quot;issues pertaining to [Father].&quot;Â  Although Father\r\n  remained incarcerated in North Carolina, an attorney and a GAL represented him\r\n  at the hearing.Â  The family court found &quot;substantial risk of sexual abuse\r\n  of [Children] by [Father] based on the presence of pornography in the home&quot;\r\n  and ordered entry of Father's name into the Central Registry of Sex Offenders.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the family court's order required Father to complete a\r\n  sex-offender program, &quot;either through the North Carolina prison system&quot;\r\n  or by contacting DSS &quot;upon his release from prison . . . to be assessed\r\n  for a treatment plan to include sex offender therapy.&quot; Â The order\r\n  reiterated the court's earlier requirement that Father have no contact with\r\n  Children, direct or indirect, until he completed the sex-offender program.Â  The\r\n  order also required Father to pay child support of $54 per week to Grandfather &quot;upon\r\n  [Father's] release from prison.&quot; \r\nOn January 16,\r\n  2007, the family court conducted a judicial review hearing.Â  Father, his\r\n  attorney, and his GAL were absent.Â  The family court determined DSS\r\n  intervention services were no longer needed and authorized Grandparents to\r\n  retain physical and legal custody of Children.Â  Furthermore, the treatment plan\r\n  stated Grandparents were &quot;prevented from transferring custody to a third party\r\n  without prior court permission.&quot;Â  The placement plan contained no new\r\n  provisions regarding Father.Â  Thereafter, the family court closed DSS's case against\r\n  Mother and Father and relieved Children's GAL.Â  The order stated child support\r\n  would continue according to its prior orders.Â  \r\nIn April 2007,\r\n  Grandfather filed a complaint to terminate the parental rights (TPR) of Mother\r\n  and Father and a petition to adopt Children.Â  Father responded by advising\r\n  Grandfather's attorney: \r\n\r\n\tI do not intend to give up my\r\n  parental rights to my children.Â  I want to write and see my children as quick\r\n  as I can.Â  I appreciate my father-in-law taking care of my children, but I am\r\n  not giving up my parental rights to them.Â  \r\n\r\nOn May 25, 2007,\r\n  Mother signed an affidavit relinquishing her parental rights and consenting to\r\n  Grandfather's adoption of Children.Â  Mother's affidavit stated she had custody\r\n  of Children until March 15, 2005, and thereafter, Grandfather was Children's\r\n  primary caretaker.Â  \r\nOn September 27,\r\n  2007, Father filed a motion asking the family court to deny Grandfather's TPR action\r\n  and to continue its then-existing orders regarding &quot;custody, guardianship,\r\n  visitation, and child support.&quot;Â  Father attached a handwritten,\r\n  fifteen-page letter explaining his relationship with Children, his\r\n  understanding of the family court's orders restraining him from contacting\r\n  Children, his remediation efforts in prison, and the reasons he did not meet\r\n  the statutory grounds for TPR set forth in Grandfather's complaint.Â  Father\r\n  added: \r\n\r\n\t[I]\r\n  know being there part-time is better than no contact at all . . . .Â  [I] do not\r\n  feel that giving up my parental rights is the best thing for my children.Â  I\r\n  want to be the best father I can while I am in prison then continue that\r\n  relationship when I get out and can support my children fully with continuous\r\n  contact with them.Â  \r\n\r\nIn October 2007, Respondents\r\n  filed a motion for leave to intervene and to bring their own action for TPR and\r\n  adoption.Â  The family court granted the motion and temporarily transferred\r\n  custody from Grandfather to Respondents.Â  On January 9, 2008, Respondents\r\n  filed their action seeking TPR and adoption, asserting: &quot;[D]ue to ill\r\n  health, [Grandparents] can no longer physically care for [Children].&quot;Â  Respondents\r\n  contended that, since August 2006, they had &quot;provided for [Children]\r\n  financially, physically, emotionally and medically without regular financial\r\n  assistance from either parent and [had] formed a close bond with [Children]\r\n  such that [Children] [had] come to know and love [Respondents] as their primary\r\n  caregivers.&quot;Â  \r\nThe following month, Father sent a letter to Respondents'\r\n  counsel stating: Â &quot;I will not willfully relinquish my parental rights and\r\n  obligations to [Children].&quot;Â  Father contended Respondents' complaints\r\n  against him were inaccurate and argued he did not meet any of the alleged statutory\r\n  grounds for TPR.Â  Specifically, Father stated he had not willfully failed to\r\n  visit or support Children, abandoned Children, or failed to remedy the\r\n  conditions leading to their removal from Mother.Â  Father stated he had complied\r\n  with the family court's orders requiring him to have no contact with Children\r\n  until he completed the sex-offender program.Â  Father explained:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  problem is that program is only offered in medium custody prison. Â . . . Â I\r\n  have been trying to get my medium custody so I can take this program and be\r\n  able to take part in my children's lives.Â  \r\n\r\nFather also stated the family\r\n  court ordered child support &quot;beginning 30 days after my release\r\n  from prison.&quot;Â  Finally, Father asserted:\r\n\r\n\tI did\r\n  NOT abandon my children at all.Â  I was incarcerated for a crime and I am paying\r\n  the price for it, so by no means did I want to be separated from my children.Â \r\n  I love my children with all my heart and soul and it is not in my children's\r\n  best interest to be separated from each other. Â . . . Â [Grandfather] has denied\r\n  . . . my family and me any and all information concerning the status of my\r\n  children.Â  \r\n\r\nOn May 15, 2008,\r\n  Father filed an answer denying Respondents' allegations, asking the family court\r\n  to maintain his parental rights, and, upon his release from prison, to reopen\r\n  issues of visitation, support, and custody.Â  Moreover, Father asked the family court\r\n  to award custody and guardianship to Respondents and to require Respondents to\r\n  keep him informed regarding Children.\r\nOn June 2, 2008,\r\n  the family court conducted a final TPR hearing.Â  At that hearing, Grandfather\r\n  testified Mother left Children with a friend, who later told DSS that Mother had\r\n  &quot;dropped [Children] off and hadn't been around for a while.&quot;Â \r\n  Grandfather stated DSS contacted him in December 2004 and told him Children\r\n  would be put in foster care if he did not take them immediately.Â  Grandfather's\r\n  custody of Children was formalized by the March 15, 2005, family court order.Â  \r\nGrandfather\r\n  testified that since Children had come into his custody, Father had written one\r\n  letter to them.Â  He added: &quot;And [the family court's] order says in part\r\n  that [Father] is to have no contact with [Children] whatsoever.Â  So I simply\r\n  destroyed the letter.&quot;Â  Grandfather acknowledged that shortly after\r\n  Children came to live with him, Father registered Children to participate in a &quot;prisoner\r\n  gift program.&quot;Â  Grandfather testified Father had sent no support to him for\r\n  Children's care; however, he later acknowledged the family court's order\r\n  specified Father's child support obligation began thirty days after his release\r\n  from prison.Â  Â \r\nNext, the family\r\n  court heard testimony from the three couples who had temporary custody of\r\n  Children.Â  Mr. Doe testified he and Mrs. Doe met N.B. in December 2005 at\r\n  Children's childcare center, where Mrs. Doe was then working.Â  Mrs. Doe was\r\n  present but did not testify.Â  Mrs. Roe testified she and Mr. Roe met A.B., who\r\n  was then eighteen months old, in January 2006.Â  Mrs. Roe explained:\r\n\r\n\t[Mr.\r\n  Roe] is the uncle of [Mrs. Doe] who has [N.B.] and she works at the daycare,\r\n  and she had [A.B.] in her infant room.Â  And she had contacted us knowing that,\r\n  you know, we did not have any children.Â  So on and so forth.Â  And that\r\n  [Grandparents] were having problems caring for A.B. because she was so small.Â \r\n  She was very active.Â  She was 18 months at the time.Â  And asked, you know, if\r\n  we could help out by taking her, you know, a day or two here just to help them\r\n  out because they needed help.\r\n\r\nMr. Roe was present but did\r\n  not testify.Â  Mr. Moe testified he and Mrs. Moe met J.B. in August 2006 through\r\n  a mutual friend.Â  Mr. Moe explained J.B. had been &quot;off and on\r\n  visiting&quot; them when Grandfather filed his TPR action in April 2007, but he\r\n  did not move into their home until October 2007.Â  Mrs. Moe was present, but did\r\n  not testify.Â  All of the testifying Respondents acknowledged: (1) they had\r\n  never communicated with Father; (2) after obtaining temporary custody in\r\n  October 2007, they paid all of their respective child's expenses; and (3) if\r\n  the family court denied their TPR and adoption action, they would continue to\r\n  care for the child in their custody.Â  \r\nAmanda Craven was\r\n  appointed as Children's GAL in the underlying DSS action, which closed in\r\n  January 2007, and in the subsequent private actions.Â  Craven acknowledged\r\n  the family court's March 2005 and September 2005 orders stated that Children\r\n  were removed due to Mother's neglect, and the only treatment goals for Father\r\n  related to conditions &quot;justifying intervention, but not removal.&quot;Â \r\n  Father's counsel asked Craven if she had &quot;done anything to facilitate\r\n  contact between [Father] and [Children] while he's in jail.&quot;Â  Craven\r\n  responded: Â &quot;No.Â  The court order prohibits any contact between him and\r\n  [Children].&quot;Â  Craven admitted: &quot;I don't know anything about [Father's]\r\n  finances or assets.&quot;Â  \r\nAt the close of Respondents'\r\n  evidence, Father's counsel submitted a written motion asking the family court\r\n  to dismiss the action against Father, contending clear and convincing evidence\r\n  failed to establish that Father satisfied any statutory ground for TPR.Â  The family\r\n  court took the TPR matter under advisement and asked both parties to submit\r\n  proposed orders.Â Â Â  \r\nThree weeks later, the\r\n  hearing resumed.Â  The family court found Father satisfied the following\r\n  statutory grounds for TPR: (1) Father failed to remedy the conditions that led\r\n  to Children's removal, (2) Father willfully failed to visit Children for six\r\n  months, (3) Father willfully failed to support Children for six months, and (4)\r\n  Father abandoned Children.Â  The family court additionally found TPR was in\r\n  Children's best interest.Â  Thereafter, the family court excused Father's\r\n  counsel and conducted the adoption hearing.Â  Later that day, the family court\r\n  issued an order terminating Father's parental rights and another order granting\r\n  Respondents' petitions to adopt Children.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAlthough &quot;the\r\n  grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence,&quot; an\r\n  appellate court may examine the entire record in a TPR case &quot;to determine\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence.&quot;Â  Stinecipher v.\r\n    Ballington, 366 S.C. 92, 97, 620 S.E.2d 93, 96 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Despite\r\n  this broad scope of review, the appellate court should not necessarily\r\n  disregard the findings of the family court because it was in a better position\r\n  to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and to assign weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Charleston County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson,\r\n  368 S.C. 87, 95, 627 S.E.2d 765, 770 (Ct. App. 2006). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Statutory Grounds\r\n  for TPR\r\nFather contends the\r\n  family court erred in finding clear and convincing evidence established he\r\n  satisfied four statutory grounds for TPR.Â  We agree.\r\nIn South Carolina, TPR is governed by statute. Â The family court can order TPR only upon finding the\r\n  existence of one or more of the eleven statutory grounds and also finding TPR\r\n  is in the child's best interest. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (Supp. 2008).Â  Before\r\n  terminating parental rights, the alleged statutory grounds must be proven by\r\n  clear and convincing evidence. Â Loe v. Mother, Father, &amp; Berkeley County\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs., 382 S.C. 457, 465, 675 S.E.2d 807, 811 (Ct. App. 2009).Â \r\n  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination of\r\n  whether the termination grounds are supported by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence.Â  Id. \r\n\r\n\tClear\r\n  and convincing evidence is that degree of proof which will produce in the mind\r\n  of the trier of facts a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be\r\n  established.Â  Such measure of proof is intermediate, more than a mere\r\n  preponderance but less than is required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt; it\r\n  does not mean clear and unequivocal.\r\n\r\nAnonymous (M-156-90) v.\r\n  State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 329 S.C.\r\n  371, 374 n.2, 496 S.E.2d 17, 18 n.2 (1998) (internal citations and quotation\r\n  marks omitted).\r\nA.&nbsp; Failure\r\n  to Remedy\r\nFather argues the\r\n  family court erred in finding he failed to remedy the conditions that led to\r\n  Children's removal.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nOne statutory\r\n  ground for TPR addresses a parent's failure to remedy the conditions that led\r\n  to the child's removal from the parent:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  child has been removed from the parent . . . [and] has been out of the home for\r\n  a period of six months following the adoption of a placement plan . . . and the\r\n  parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the removal.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(2)\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nHere, DSS\r\n  recommended, and the family court ordered, that Children be removed from\r\n  Mother.Â  The record reflects &quot;the conditions which caused the\r\n  removal&quot; related to Mother's neglect of Children.Â  The family court found\r\n  no conditions pertaining to Father that merited Children's removal.Â  Father's\r\n  imprisonment began more than a year before Children's removal.Â  He neither\r\n  lived in the home nor exercised control over it at the time Children were\r\n  removed, or thereafter.Â  As a result, Father had no ability to remedy the\r\n  conditions that led to Children's removal from Mother.Â  Accordingly, the family\r\n  court erred in finding Father satisfied this statutory ground for TPR.\r\nB.&nbsp; Grounds\r\n  Requiring a Finding of &quot;Willfulness&quot;\r\nFather argues the\r\n  family court erred in finding he willfully failed to visit or support Children\r\n  and in finding he willfully abandoned them.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nA parent's conduct\r\n  is &quot;willful&quot; when it demonstrates the\r\n  &quot;settled purpose to forego parental duties&quot; and &quot;manifests a\r\n  conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and\r\n  consortium from the parent.&quot; Â Â S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome,\r\n  307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1992).Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; Failure\r\n  to Visit\r\n\r\n\tA statutory ground\r\n  exists to terminate a parent's rights when:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe\r\n  child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months,\r\n  and during that time the parent has wil[l]fully failed to visit the child. The\r\n  court may attach little or no weight to incidental visitations, but it must\r\n    be shown that the parent was not prevented from visiting by the party having\r\n    custody or by court order. The distance of the child's placement from the\r\n  parent's home must be taken into consideration when determining the ability to\r\n  visit. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(3)\r\n  (Supp. 2008) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThis statutory\r\n  ground for TPR requires satisfaction of two criteria: (1) the child must be\r\n  absent from the parental home for six months, and (2) during that time, the\r\n  parent willfully failed to visit the child.Â  Father's arrest and imprisonment in\r\n  North Carolina removed him from the family's home in 2003.Â  The record includes\r\n  a letter from Father, stating Mother brought Children to visit him in jail eight\r\n  times before she and Children moved to South Carolina.Â  No evidence in the\r\n  record established that Father failed to communicate with Children from the\r\n  time they moved to South Carolina until they began living with Grandparents in\r\n  December 2004.Â  \r\nAdditionally, no\r\n  evidence in the record indicates the date Mother left Children with her\r\n  friend.Â  Children certainly &quot;lived outside the home&quot; of their parents\r\n  when they moved into Grandfather's home in December 2004.Â  Grandfather\r\n  acknowledged while Children were living with him, Father arranged for them to\r\n  receive gifts through a prisoner gift program.Â  On March 15, 2005, the family\r\n  court entered an order removing Children from Mother.Â  By this order, the\r\n  family court also mandated Father &quot;shall have no contact, direct or\r\n  indirect, with [Children] until [he] is assessed by a sex offender therapist\r\n  upon release from jail.&quot;Â  Thus, after March 15, 2005, Father was prevented\r\n  by a court order from having any contact, direct or indirect, with Children. \r\nBased on these\r\n  facts, we find the record does not establish by clear and convincing evidence\r\n  that Father, who was in prison in North Carolina, willfully failed to visit\r\n  Children for a six-month period.Â  We find that aside from arranging gifts for\r\n  Children through a prisoner program, Father did not visit or otherwise contact\r\n  Children between the time they began living with Grandparents and entry of the\r\n  no-contact order.Â  This period, from December 2004 to March 2005, comprises\r\n  only three months.Â  Consequently, the family court erred in finding clear and\r\n  convincing evidence supported Father's willful failure to visit Children for\r\n  more than six months.Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; Failure\r\n  to Support\r\n\r\n\tA statutory ground for TPR also exists when: \r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe\r\n  child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months,\r\n  and during that time the parent has wil[l]fully failed to support the child. Â Failure\r\n  to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to\r\n  the child's care. Â A material contribution consists of either financial contributions\r\n  according to the parent's means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or\r\n  other necessities for the care of the child according to the parent's means. Â The\r\n  court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the\r\n  parent has wil[l]fully failed to support the child, including requests for\r\n  support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(4)\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  evidence pertaining to Father's purported failure to visit Children applies also\r\n  to his failure to support them.Â  In both instances, the statutory clock began\r\n  to run when Children began living outside the parent's home.Â  For the reasons\r\n  discussed above, the record indicates Children began living outside the\r\n  parental home in December 2004.Â  The family court's order of March 15, 2005, prohibited\r\n  Father from having &quot;any contact with Children, either direct or\r\n  indirect.&quot;Â  That same order held in abeyance the determination of Father's\r\n  child support obligation.Â  On September 8, 2005, the family court ruled\r\n  Father's child support obligation would not commence until thirty days\r\n  following his release from prison.Â  This order continued to prohibit Father\r\n  having any contact, direct or indirect, with Children.Â  \r\nDespite\r\n  the family court's order, Respondents contend Father could have used his prison\r\n  &quot;canteen credits&quot; to support Children.Â  However, no evidence\r\n  indicated those credits could be distributed as support to Children.Â  Moreover,\r\n  the record contains no evidence Father had any disposable income.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the family court erred in finding clear and convincing evidence supported TPR\r\n  based upon Father's willful failure to support Children for more than six\r\n  months.Â  \r\n3.&nbsp; AbandonmentÂ Â Â Â Â  \r\nAbandonment\r\n  is another ground for TPR.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(7) (Supp. 2008).Â  &quot;Abandonment&quot;\r\n  occurs when a parent &quot;wil[l]fully deserts a child or wil[l]fully\r\n  surrenders physical possession of a child without making adequate arrangements\r\n  for the child's needs or the continuing care of the child.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 63-7-20(1) (Supp. 2008).Â  Incarceration alone, even a lengthy\r\n  incarceration, is not a ground for TPR.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Ledford, 357 S.C. 371, 376, 593 S.E.2d 175, 177 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, when\r\n  an incarcerated parent willfully disregards his child's wellbeing and\r\n  continuing care, the family court may find abandonment.Â  Id. at 377, 593\r\n  S.E.2d at 177-78.Â  \r\nHere, after Father\r\n  was incarcerated in November 2003, Children remained in Mother's care and\r\n  custody for over a year.Â  According to Father, he remained in contact with\r\n  Children through prison visits. Â No evidence established that Father willfully\r\n  deserted Children or failed to make arrangements for their care.Â  To the\r\n  contrary, Father expected Children to live with Mother, and thereafter, he\r\n  acknowledged appreciation for Grandfather's care of Children.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Father wrote lengthy letters to the family court expressing his desire to remain\r\n  a part of Children's lives and asking the family court to give Respondents\r\n  permanent custody of Children, but also to require Respondents to provide\r\n  Father with information about Children.Â  Accordingly, the family court erred in\r\n  finding clear and convincing evidence established that Father abandoned\r\n  Children.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Remaining Issues\r\nFather\r\n  argues the issue of adoption was &quot;not ripe for adjudication&quot; until\r\n  his appeal of the TPR ruling was finally determined.Â  He also contends the\r\n  family court violated his constitutional rights by &quot;holding a final\r\n  adoption hearing on the heels of verbally issuing an order of [TPR].&quot;Â  Because\r\n  our decision to reverse the termination of Father's parental rights is\r\n  dispositive of this appeal, we need not address these issues.Â  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs\r\n  to whether the family court erred in terminating Father's parental rights, we\r\n  find Respondents failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that\r\n  Father satisfied any of the four statutory grounds for TPR. Â Therefore, we\r\n  reverse the family court's termination of Father's parental rights.Â  As a\r\n  consequence of this reversal, Father's parental rights remain intact, and we vacate\r\n  the family court's order of adoption.Â  We remand this matter to the family\r\n  court for entry of an order determining permanent custody.Â  Children shall\r\n  remain in the custody of Respondents pending further order of the family\r\n  court.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  our decision on the issue of TPR is dispositive of the appeal, we need not\r\n  reach Father's remaining arguments.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the family court is \r\nREVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J., and CURETON and GOOLSBY, A.JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
