Gregory, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-427\r\n  Heard March 10, 2004 â€“ Filed July 7, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      \r\n        Assistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General \r\n          John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n          and Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia; and \r\n          Solicitor Randolph Murdaugh, III, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A jury convicted Tavarus Rogers \r\n  of two counts of murder, five counts of kidnapping, one count of armed robbery, \r\n  and one count of first-degree burglary.Â  Rogers contends the trial judge erred \r\n  in admitting:Â  (1) the in-court identifications of two witnesses; and (2) a \r\n  note that Rogers allegedly wrote to a co-defendant while he was incarcerated \r\n  on the charges that are the subject of this appeal.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS \r\nAt approximately 12:30 a.m. on January 2, 1999, Jocelyn \r\n  Elizabeth Shough Wendel, James Mitchell Riley, and Kristal Mae Wire arrived \r\n  at a party held in the home of Paul Reischl on Coffin Point Road in Beaufort \r\n  County, South Carolina.Â  A number of people were present at the party including \r\n  Rogers, West McKinnon, Jonathon Gadsen, Collins Gadsen, John Byars, Paul Reischl, \r\n  and Toby Reischl.\r\nWendel and Wire testified they only knew a couple of \r\n  people at the party and were introduced to the others.Â  Both stated Rogers introduced \r\n  himself as â€œV.â€Â  After about an hour-and-a-half to two hours, Rogers, McKinnon, \r\n  and the Gadsens left the party.Â Â  \r\nApproximately an hour-and-a-half later, two men knocked \r\n  on the door of Paul Reischlâ€™s home.Â  Byars opened the door and the men entered \r\n  the home wielding guns.Â  The men attempted to conceal their identity by using \r\n  some type of white cloth wrapped around their faces. \r\nUpon entering the home, the men started hitting Byars.Â  \r\n  They then forced everyone to the floor and the first intruder began demanding \r\n  money and drugs from Paul Reischl.Â  Following these demands, he forced Reischl \r\n  to a back bedroom.Â  The second intruder, who apparently was witnessing the incident, \r\n  called out to the first intruder some variation of â€œdonâ€™t do it V,â€ shortly \r\n  after which the intruder shot Paul Reischl.Â  The shooter then returned to the \r\n  living room and confronted James Mitchell Riley.Â  After forcing Riley to hand \r\n  over his money, the intruder shot and killed him as well.Â  Before leaving the \r\n  house with the other man, the shooter told everyone in the house â€œyou didnâ€™t \r\n  see anything.â€Â  After the intruders left, Wire and Wendel ran to a nearby home \r\n  and called 911. \r\nSeveral hours after the shooting, Wire and Wendel gave \r\n  written statements to investigators.Â  In one of her two statements, Wire recounted \r\n  the incident and identified the intruders as â€œtwo black males.â€Â  She, however, \r\n  did not identify Rogers other than referencing the statement that was made during \r\n  the incident, â€œV donâ€™t do it.â€ Subsequently, investigators presented Wire with \r\n  three photographic lineups.Â  Wire was unable to identify anyone in these lineups.\r\nWendel also was unable to identify anyone in the three \r\n  photographic lineups that were presented to her shortly after the incident.Â  \r\n  When describing the incident in her statement, Wendel noted that when the \r\n  two intruders entered the home, â€œI recognized him â€˜Vâ€™ as soon as he came in \r\n  the door.â€Â  Throughout her statement, she described the actions of â€œV.â€Â  She \r\n  also gave a physical description of â€œV.â€ \r\nOn January 6, 1999, Rogers was detained on a coronerâ€™s \r\n  warrant. Two days later, while incarcerated, Rogers admitted to investigating \r\n  officers that he killed the two victims.Â  On January 10 and 21, 1999, Rogers \r\n  was arrested on warrants issued by a magistrate.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn February 8, 1999, a Beaufort County grand jury indicted Rogers for two counts \r\n  of murder, six counts of kidnapping, one count of assault and battery with intent \r\n  to kill, one count of first-degree burglary, one count of armed robbery, and \r\n  one count of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. \r\n\r\nPrior to trial, Rogersâ€™s counsel sought to suppress \r\n  any in-court identifications of Rogers. Â Pursuant to Neal v. Biggers, \r\n  409 U.S. 188 (1972), [1]  the \r\n  judge held two in camera hearings regarding the in-court identifications \r\n  of Rogers by Wire and Wendel. Â Â \r\nDuring her testimony, Wire recounted the incident.Â  \r\n  She testified that she recognized the intruders because she had seen them earlier \r\n  in the evening at the party.Â  Wire identified â€œVâ€ as present in the courtroom \r\n  by pointing to â€œthe one in the orange suit.â€ Â When questioned about her \r\n  ability to identify â€œV,â€ Wire stated she had seen the intruders earlier in the \r\n  evening at the party and she recognized their voices. Â She further testified \r\n  that the intrudersâ€™ faces were not completely covered with the white cloth when \r\n  they entered the home. Â Â \r\nOn cross-examination, Wire admitted that she was unable \r\n  to identify anyone in the photographic lineups and she did not give a physical \r\n  description of the intruders, other than their race, in her written statement.Â  \r\n  She also acknowledged that once she was ordered to the floor during the incident \r\n  she never looked up.Â  She further acknowledged that Rogers was the only African-American \r\n  male in the courtroom wearing an orange detention center uniform. Â She \r\n  also admitted that she had:Â  seen Rogers at a bond hearing; been informed by \r\n  an investigating officer that Rogers had been arrested; read newspaper articles \r\n  regarding the incident; and spoken with Wendell about the incident.\r\nDetectives Sam Roser and Matthew Averill, investigating \r\n  officers, testified that they interviewed Wire after the incident and showed \r\n  her the photographic lineups.Â  Roser testified that Wire told him that she knew \r\n  the intruders were African-American because their masks were partially open.Â  \r\n  She also told Roser that she identified â€œVâ€ by his braided hairstyle.\r\nAt the conclusion of the testimony, Rogersâ€™s counsel \r\n  argued Wireâ€™s in-court identification should be suppressed given:Â  Wire gave \r\n  no physical description of the intruders after the incident; she could not identify \r\n  Rogers in the photographic lineups; she had seen Rogers at a bond hearing; and \r\n  Rogers was the only African-American male in the courtroom wearing an orange \r\n  detention suit.Â  The judge denied the motion and ruled Wireâ€™s identification \r\n  was admissible.\r\nIn a subsequent hearing, the judge heard testimony regarding Wendelâ€™s identification \r\n  of Rogers.Â  Wendell testified that at the time of the incident she recognized \r\n  Rogers as one of the intruders because his mask fell down when he entered the \r\n  home.Â  She also knew him as the man who had introduced himself at the party.Â  \r\n  Wendell admitted that she had not been able to identify Rogers in any of the \r\n  photographic lineups.Â  During her testimony, Wendell identified Rogers by pointing \r\n  to him and describing his attire as an orange jumpsuit.Â  On cross-examination, \r\n  she acknowledged that she had seen Rogers at a prior hearing and had read about \r\n  the incident in the newspaper. \r\nAfter the testimony concluded, Rogersâ€™s counsel moved to suppress Wendellâ€™s \r\n  identification.Â  He argued the in-court identification procedure was suggestive \r\n  in that it was the equivalent of an impermissible â€œshow-upâ€ procedure.Â  Additionally, \r\n  he contended Wendellâ€™s identification was not reliable on the grounds:Â  she \r\n  could not identify Rogers in a photographic lineup; she had seen Rogers at prior \r\n  court proceedings; she had reviewed newspaper articles regarding the incident; \r\n  and she had discussed the incident with the other victims as well as her father, \r\n  who had collected the newspaper articles.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe judge denied Rogersâ€™s motion to exclude Wendellâ€™s in-court identification.Â  \r\n  Aside from addressing the reliability of Wendellâ€™s identification, the judge \r\n  also found Rogers could not claim undue prejudice from the identification of \r\n  him in court given the fact that his counsel chose not to use an alternate procedure, \r\n  i.e., placing other African-American males with similar characteristics \r\n  to Rogers at the defense table or in the courtroom. \r\nAt trial, both Wendell and Wire testified regarding \r\n  the incident and identified Rogers as the man who shot the two victims.Â  They \r\n  also identified Rogers in the courtroom. \r\nToby Reischl testified Rogers was at the party and was introduced as â€œV.â€Â  \r\n  Although he could not positively identify the intruders, he testified that one \r\n  of the intruders was referred to as â€œV.â€Â  In addition to this testimony and \r\n  the testimony of the investigating officers, the State introduced, over the \r\n  objection of defense counsel, a note allegedly written by Rogers to his co-defendant \r\n  McKinnon while the two were incarcerated. \r\nThe jury convicted Rogers of two counts of murder, five counts of kidnapping, \r\n  one count of armed robbery, and one count of first-degree burglary.Â  The judge \r\n  sentenced Rogers to life imprisonment for each count of murder and the first-degree \r\n  burglary charge, consecutive thirty-year terms for three of the kidnapping charges, \r\n  [2]  and a concurrent term of twenty-five years for armed robbery.Â  Rogers \r\n  appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  \r\nRogers argues the trial judge erred in admitting the in-court identifications \r\n  of Wire and Wendel.Â Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œGenerally, the decision to admit an eyewitness identification is at the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of such, \r\n  or the commission of prejudicial legal error.â€Â  State v. Moore, 343 S.C. \r\n  282, 288, 540 S.E.2d 445, 448 (2000).Â  â€œHowever, an eyewitness identification \r\n  which is unreliable because of suggestive line-up procedures is constitutionally \r\n  inadmissible as a matter of law.â€Â  Id.\r\nâ€œA criminal defendant may be deprived of due process of law \r\n  by an identification procedure that is unnecessarily suggestive and conducive \r\n  to irreparable mistaken identification.â€Â  State v. Brown, 356 S.C. 496, \r\n  502, 589 S.E.2d 781, 784 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œAn in-court identification of an \r\n  accused is inadmissible if a suggestive out-of-court identification procedure \r\n  created a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.â€ Id.Â  \r\n  Suggestiveness alone, however, does not require the exclusion of evidence.Â  \r\n  State v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 450, 272 S.E.2d 628, 629 (1980).Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œTo determine the admissibility of an identification, \r\n  the court must determine (1) whether the identification process was unduly suggestive \r\n  and (2) if so, whether the out-of-court identification was nevertheless so reliable \r\n  that no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed.â€Â  State v. Cheeseboro, \r\n  346 S.C. 526, 540, 532 S.E.2d 300, 308 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. \r\n  933 (2002).Â  Furthermore, as reliability is the most important factor in determining \r\n  the admissibility of identification testimony, the key inquiry is whether under \r\n  all the circumstances the identification was reliable even though the confrontation \r\n  procedure may have been suggestive.Â  State v. McCord, 349 S.C. 477, 481, \r\n  562 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2002); State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, \r\n  251, 525 S.E.2d 535, 541 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSeveral factors should be considered in evaluating the totality of the circumstances \r\n  to determine the likelihood of a misidentification:\r\n\r\n  (1) the witnessâ€™s opportunity to view the perpetrator at the time of the \r\n    crime, (2) the witnessâ€™s degree of attention, (3) the accuracy of the witnessâ€™s \r\n    prior description of the perpetrator, (4) the level of certainty demonstrated \r\n    by the witness at the confrontation, and (5) the length of time between the \r\n    crime and the confrontation.\r\n\r\nMcCord, 349 S.C. at 481, 562 S.E.2d at 691.Â  â€œOnly \r\n  after a determination as to the reliability of a witnessâ€™ identification has \r\n  been made by the trial court may the witness testify before the jury.â€Â  Moore, \r\n  343 S.C. at 289, 540 S.E.2d at 449.\r\nAlthough there are questions and apparent inconsistencies involved in Wireâ€™s \r\n  and Wendelâ€™s in-court identifications, we do not believe the trial judge abused \r\n  his discretion in admitting their testimony.Â  Specifically, the judge applied \r\n  the correct standard in determining the admissibility of the testimony and there \r\n  is evidence to support his decision.Â  See State v. Wilson, 345 \r\n  S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (An abuse of discretion occurs when \r\n  the conclusions of the circuit court either lack evidentiary support or are \r\n  controlled by an error of law.).\r\nInitially, we find the fact that neither Wire nor Wendel could identify Rogers \r\n  in a photographic lineup is not dispositive of whether their identifications \r\n  were admissible.Â  See McCord, 349 S.C. at 483, 562 S.E.2d at 692 \r\n  (â€œThe fact that a witness is unable to make a positive identification from a \r\n  photo array does not negate the reliability of their positive in-court identification.â€ \r\n  (quoting State v. Blanchard, 920 S.W.2d 147, 149 (Mo. Ct. App. 1996))); \r\n  State v. Scipio, 283 S.C. 124, 126-27, 322 S.E.2d 15, 17 (1984) (finding \r\n  in-court identification of defendant by victim was admissible even though victim \r\n  failed to identify defendant in photographic lineup).Â  \r\nSimilarly, the fact that the witnesses viewed Rogers at a bond hearing did \r\n  not preclude a finding that their in-court identification was reliable.Â  See \r\n  State v. Cunningham, 275 S.C. 189, 193, 268 S.E.2d 289, 291 (1980) (holding \r\n  victimâ€™s in-court identification was admissible even though victim saw the defendant \r\n  at a preliminary hearing prior to the in-court identification); State v. \r\n  Covington, 226 S.E.2d 629, 638 (N.C. 1976) (â€œ[T]he viewing of a defendant \r\n  in the courtroom during the various stages of a criminal proceeding by witnesses \r\n  who are offered to testify as to identification of the defendant is not, of \r\n  itself, such a confrontation as will taint an in-court identification unless \r\n  other circumstances are shown which are so â€˜unnecessarily suggestive and conducive \r\n  to irreparable mistaken misidentificationâ€™ as would deprive defendant of his \r\n  due process rights.â€ (quoting State v. Haskins, 178 S.E.2d 610, 612 (N.C. \r\n  1971))).\r\nTurning to the requisite identification factors, we find there is evidence \r\n  to support the judgeâ€™s conclusion.Â  Both witnesses observed Rogers in a social \r\n  setting for several hours before the incident.Â  Wire testified that she was \r\n  able to identify Rogers because she had seen him earlier and his face was not \r\n  completely covered when he entered the home.Â  Wendel also testified that she \r\n  was able to immediately recognize Rogers when he returned to the home because \r\n  she saw his face.Â  Additionally, in her written statement, Wendel gave a detailed \r\n  description of the incident.Â  She also provided physical descriptions of â€œVâ€ \r\n  as well as the other intruder.Â  Furthermore, given the witnesses were held at \r\n  gunpoint their degree of attention would most likely have been acute.Â  Although \r\n  a significant amount of time elapsed, approximately three years, between the \r\n  incident and the hearing concerning the in-court identification testimony, both \r\n  witnesses were certain in their in-court identifications of Rogers.Â  Â Â \r\nAdmittedly, Wire did not provide a description \r\n  of the intruders in her written statements beyond describing them as â€œtwo black \r\n  males.â€Â  However, any uncertainty as to the identification testimony went to \r\n  the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility.Â  See State v. \r\n  Distance, 594 S.E.2d 221, 226 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004) (â€œ[A]ny uncertainty in \r\n  an in-court identification goes to the weight and not the admissibility of the \r\n  testimony.â€).Â  This evidence was then for the jury to weigh.Â  See State \r\n  v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 451, 272 S.E.2d 628, 630 (1980) (recognizing that \r\n  jury is to weigh identification testimony that has some questionable feature).\r\nFinally, even if the in-court identifications were erroneously admitted, particularly \r\n  that of Wire, any error would not require reversal.Â  See State v. \r\n  Simmons, 308 S.C. 80, 83, 417 S.E.2d 92, 94 (1992) (stating â€œunder certain \r\n  circumstances, if the identification is corroborated by either circumstantial \r\n  or direct evidence, then the harmless error rule might be applicableâ€); State \r\n  v. Thompson, 276 S.C. 616, 620-21, 281 S.E.2d 216, 219 (1981) (recognizing \r\n  admission of improper in-court identification may be harmless error where the \r\n  evidence is merely cumulative to independent and overwhelming evidence of guilt), \r\n  habeas corpus granted by Thompson v. Leeke, 590 F. Supp. 110 (D.S.C. \r\n  1984) (finding improper in-court identification did not constitute harmless \r\n  error where:Â  robbery victim was the only eyewitness; victim could not identify \r\n  perpetrator on two occasions; investigating officer pointed out defendant as \r\n  the man who robbed the victim; victim, at trial, was â€œalmost positiveâ€ that \r\n  defendant was the perpetrator; and the only other testimony identifying defendant \r\n  was that of his accomplice and his accompliceâ€™s wife), affâ€™d, 756 F.2d \r\n  314 (4th Cir. 1985).Â Â  \r\nBecause the in-court identification testimony was \r\n  not the only evidence identifying Rogers, any error would be harmless.Â  Here, \r\n  Wire, Wendel, and Toby Reischl all testified that they believed Rogers was the \r\n  intruder who shot the victim because Rogers introduced himself to them at the \r\n  party as â€œV,â€ and each person heard the second intruder say â€œDonâ€™t do it V.â€Â  \r\n  Wire also testified she recognized the intruders from earlier in the evening \r\n  by their voices.Â  See Stewart, 275 S.C. at 451, 272 S.E.2d at \r\n  630 (finding witnessesâ€™ voice identification of defendant was admissible as \r\n  to the issue of the reliability of the in-court identification).Â  Rogers does \r\n  not challenge this evidence on appeal.Â  Additionally, Wendel was able to identify \r\n  Rogersâ€™s co-defendant by the clothing he had worn during the party.Â  Based on \r\n  the foregoing, we affirm the judgeâ€™s decision to admit the identification testimony.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nRogers asserts the trial judge erred in refusing to suppress the note allegedly \r\n  written by him to his co-defendant while incarcerated.Â  In support of this assertion, \r\n  he contends the note was obtained pursuant to an illegal arrest.Â  Alternatively, \r\n  he argues that even if the note was not fruit of the illegal arrest, it should \r\n  have been excluded as being more prejudicial than probative. \r\nPrior to trial, Rogersâ€™s counsel moved to exclude any \r\n  inculpatory statements made by Rogers while illegally detained under the coronerâ€™s \r\n  warrant. Â Because the coronerâ€™s warrant was invalid and the State did \r\n  not have probable cause to arrest Rogers at the time he confessed to shooting \r\n  the victims, counsel moved to suppress the admission as â€œfruit of the poisonous \r\n  tree.â€Â  See Taylor v. Alabama, 457 U.S. 687, 690 (1982) (â€œ[A] \r\n  confession obtained through custodial interrogation after an illegal arrest \r\n  should be excluded unless intervening events break the causal connection between \r\n  the illegal arrest and the confession so that the confession is â€˜sufficiently \r\n  an act of free will to purge the primary taint.â€™â€ (quoting Wong Sun v. United \r\n  States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963))).\r\nAfter a hearing, the trial judge granted Rogersâ€™s motion.Â  He found that at \r\n  the time the statement was made the State lacked probable cause to arrest Rogers.Â  \r\n  He further held the coronerâ€™s warrant was invalid, as conceded by the State, \r\n  given it was issued without legal authority.Â  Because the State â€œfailed to prove \r\n  that the taint of the Fourth Amendment violation was purged,â€ the judge suppressed \r\n  all of the alleged statements as the â€œfruit of the poisonous tree.â€ \r\nBased on this earlier ruling, Rogersâ€™s counsel objected \r\n  at trial to the admission of the note allegedly written by Rogers to co-defendant \r\n  West McKinnon.Â  Counsel argued the note was not relevant and even if found to \r\n  be relevant, admitting it into evidence would be unfairly prejudicial.Â  He asserted \r\n  there was no indication who wrote the letter or who was the intended recipient. \r\n  Additionally, counsel contended the note should be excluded as evidence obtained \r\n  from Rogersâ€™s illegal detention under the coronerâ€™s warrant.Â  He asserted that \r\n  the magistrateâ€™s warrant, which was issued after the coronerâ€™s warrant, did \r\n  not cure the Fourth Amendment violation because this warrant would not have \r\n  been obtained but for the information illegally obtained under the coronerâ€™s \r\n  warrant.Â  The trial judge denied the motion, finding the note was admissible \r\n  given it was volunteered and Rogers was not being questioned at the time it \r\n  was found.Â  \r\nOfficer Richard Rivers of the Beaufort County Detention \r\n  Center was then permitted to testify that on January 22, 1999, he saw Rogers \r\n  slip a magazine into an adjoining cell.Â  The magazine was retrieved and the \r\n  handwritten note was found stuck between the pages.Â  A South Carolina Law Enforcement \r\n  Division fingerprint analyst found eleven prints on the note, eight of which \r\n  matched those of Rogers.Â  PhilÂ  Foote, another Beaufort County Corrections Officer, \r\n  testified that West McKinnon was in the cell in which Rogers placed the magazine.Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe solicitor read the note as follows:\r\n\r\n  â€œWhat did you tell Mrs. Wilson (the Public Defenderâ€™s investigator)?Â  She \r\n    said our stories are f---ed up.Â  I told her that after we left P sh-- you \r\n    drop themâ€ â€“ up in brackets again â€“ â€œ(Cee and Bro) off at C sh-- and drop \r\n    me off in Saxonville at luck sh-- about 1 a.m. or later.Â  Then I called you \r\n    that morning and you took me to Ladyâ€™s Island with CAP about 7 or 8 a.m.Â  \r\n    You gotta f---ing holla at me less you done told these crackas you was there \r\n    at the time of the sh--, what?Â  We gotta have our stories â€œtop of the lineâ€, \r\n    unquote.Â  (Flush this sh-- â€“ rip it up first*) (*Write me back*).â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThe fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine holds that \r\n  where evidence would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the \r\n  police, and the evidence has been obtained by the exploitation of that illegality, \r\n  the evidence must be excluded.â€Â  State v. Plath, 277 S.C. 126, 134, 284 \r\n  S.E.2d 221, 226 (1981) (citing Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 \r\n  (1963)), overruled on other grounds by State v.

Collins, 329 S.C. 23, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  202 (1998).Â  â€œEven if the arrest was illegal, the fruit of the poisonous tree \r\n  doctrine will not apply to a confession if it is freely and voluntarily given.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 134-35, 284 S.E.2d at 226.Â  \r\nEven assuming Rogers was illegally detained when the note was seized and that \r\n  its contents constituted a confession, we find the note was not the fruit of \r\n  the illegal arrest.Â  Our decision is based on our supreme courtâ€™s holding in \r\n  State v. Funchess, 255 S.C. 385, 179 S.E.2d 25 (1971), cert. denied, \r\n  404 U.S. 915 (1971).Â  In Funchess, the court directly confronted this \r\n  issue, stating:\r\n\r\n  We conclude and hold that every statement or confession made by a person \r\n    in custody as the result of an illegal arrest, is not involuntary and inadmissible, \r\n    but the facts and circumstances surrounding such arrest and the in-custody \r\n    statement should be considered in determining whether the statement is voluntary \r\n    and admissible. Voluntariness remains as the test of admissibility.\r\n\r\nId. at 391, 179 S.E.2d at 28. Â  \r\nIn the instant case, there is no evidence that the note was the product of \r\n  questioning by law enforcement.Â  Instead, it is clear the note was produced \r\n  and passed along voluntarily.Â  Moreover, at the time the note was written Rogers \r\n  had been served with the magistrateâ€™s warrant and apparently had spoken with \r\n  a public defender.Â  Thus, there were intervening acts that broke any causal \r\n  connection between the note and the illegal arrest.Â  Accordingly, we find the \r\n  trial judge was correct in concluding the note was not the fruit of the illegal \r\n  arrest.\r\nFurthermore, we disagree with Rogersâ€™s contention that the note was not relevant \r\n  and was unfairly prejudicial.Â  While Rogers argues the note is too vague to \r\n  be admitted into evidence, we believe the note constitutes circumstantial evidence \r\n  of Rogersâ€™s guilt and was not so prejudicial as to outweigh it probative value.Â  \r\n  See Rule 401, SCRE (â€œâ€˜Relevant evidenceâ€™ means evidence having any tendency \r\n  to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination \r\n  of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€); \r\n  Rule 403, SCRE (â€œAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative \r\n  value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.â€).Â  Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the admission of the in-court identifications \r\n  of Rogers as well as the admission of the note written while Rogers was incarcerated.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ. and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Neil v.

Michael Taylor, of Columbia, \r\n          for Appellant.\r\n        W. Michael Duncan, of Columbia, \r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER \r\n  CURIAM:Â  The family court granted Ann Jennings (Wife) a divorce from William \r\n  Jennings (Husband) on the ground of adultery.Â  Wife appeals the alimony award, \r\n  equitable division of marital property, and imputation of income to Wife.Â  We \r\n  affirm as modified. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband \r\n  and Wife married in June 1982 and separated nearly eighteen years later in May \r\n  2000. [2] Â  Wife filed for temporary \r\n  relief, and she was granted use of the home (though Husband made mortgage payments) \r\n  and temporary alimony of $500 per month.Â  After discovery was conducted, it \r\n  was revealed that Husband had committed adultery.Â  Wife filed an amended complaint, \r\n  seeking a divorce on the grounds of adultery or one yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  \r\n  \r\nIn the \r\n  final order, the family court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  adultery.Â  The court also imputed income to Wife and awarded her $400 per month \r\n  in temporary alimony for eight years.Â  The court then equitably apportioned \r\n  the marital property between the parties.Â  Wife received:Â  one-third of the \r\n  General Electric stock held in Husbandâ€™s name; one-half of Husbandâ€™s Janus account; \r\n  one-half of Husbandâ€™s retirement account; a 1991 Buick; and a payment of $2,200 \r\n  from Husband for her half interest in the partiesâ€™ timeshare.Â  Husband received:Â  \r\n  one-half of the Janus and retirement accounts; various items of personal property; \r\n  the timeshare; and a 1998 Ford.Â  The court found the partiesâ€™ home was titled \r\n  in Wifeâ€™s name, ordered Wife to assume the mortgage payments, and awarded Husband \r\n  special equity in the amount of $65,250 from Wife.Â Â  \r\nAfter \r\n  Wife filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, the family \r\n  court maintained the amount of Wifeâ€™s alimony but changed it to permanent periodic \r\n  alimony.Â  The court did not change any other portions of the prior order.Â  Wife \r\n  appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, \r\n  this Court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its view of \r\n  the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. \r\n  199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not, \r\n  however, require this Court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  \r\n  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  \r\n  Neither is the Court required to ignore the fact that the family court judge, \r\n  who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their \r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. \r\n  Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\n   \r\n\r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Alimony \r\n   \r\n\r\n    Wife argues the \r\n      family court erred in imputing income to her when determining the alimony \r\n      award.Â  She further argues the court erred in awarding her only $400 in \r\n      monthly alimony.Â  \r\n    A.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n      Imputation of Income\r\n    \r\nWife argues the family \r\n  court erred in imputing income to her because she is unable to work as a result \r\n  of being afflicted with Raynaudâ€™s Disease.Â  \r\n    \r\nâ€œAlimony is a substitute \r\n  for the support that is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€Â  McElveen \r\n  v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 599, 506 S.E.2d 1, 9 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The purpose \r\n  of alimony is to place the supported spouse in the position he or she enjoyed \r\n  during the marriage. Â Id.Â  However, alimony should not â€œserve as a disincentive \r\n  for spouses to improve their employment potential or to dissuade them from providing, \r\n  to the extent possible, for their own support.â€Â  Id.Â  In making an award \r\n  of alimony, the family court must consider several factors, including each partyâ€™s \r\n  earning potential and reasonably anticipated income.Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)(4), (6) (Supp. 2003) (â€œIn making an award of alimony or separate \r\n  maintenance and support, the court must consider and give weight in such proportion \r\n  as it finds appropriate to all of the following factors: . . . (4) the employment \r\n  history and earning potential of each spouse; . . . (6) the current and reasonably \r\n  anticipated earnings of both spouses. . . .â€).\r\n    In McElveen, \r\n      the wife testified that she was not sure she could work full-time due to \r\n      her fibromyalgia, and she did not feel she could return to work until her \r\n      children were grown and the house was organized.Â  This court noted there \r\n      was no medical evidence in the record establishing the wifeâ€™s condition \r\n      precluded her employment and that, in fact, the wife pointed to non-medical \r\n      reasons to delay her return to work.Â  McElveen, 332 S.C. at 600, \r\n      506 S.E.2d at 9-10.Â  \r\n    In the present \r\n      case, Wife had several part-time jobs during the marriage, including her \r\n      job driving for the Commission for the Blind at the time of the hearing.Â  \r\n      Wife testified that she suffered from Raynaudâ€™s Disease, \r\n      [3]  which caused severe migraines lasting up to three days, upon exposure \r\n      to cold temperatures or stress.Â  Thus, Wife explained that the only reason \r\n      she was able to work her part-time job driving for the Commission for the \r\n      Blind is because she was not depended upon and could call in sick at any \r\n      time. \r\n    \r\nIn the final order, the family court \r\n  considered Wifeâ€™s health, but noted that no medical evidence was presented regarding \r\n  any ailment that prevented her from working.Â  The court specifically found that \r\n  Wife was â€œphysically and mentally capable of working full time.â€ Â The court \r\n  essentially found that Wife was underemployed and imputed a monthly income of \r\n  $885.Â  The sum of $885 per month resulted from Wife earning minimum wage while \r\n  working forty hours per week. Â \r\n    \r\n    As in McElveen, \r\n      Wifeâ€™s testimony in the present case that she could not work due to her \r\n      illness was not supported by any medical evidence.Â  Sections 20-3-130(C)(4) \r\n      and (C)(6) require the family court to consider each partyâ€™s earning potential \r\n      and reasonably anticipated income.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) \r\n      (Supp. 2003).Â  Because there was no evidence to support a finding that Wife \r\n      could not work due to her illness and Wife was working a part-time job at \r\n      the time of the final hearing, we find the family court did not commit an \r\n      abuse of discretion in considering Wifeâ€™s earning potential and in imputing \r\n      income to her.Â Â Â  \r\n    \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Amount of Alimony\r\n    \r\nWife argues her $400 \r\n  periodic alimony award was inadequate because the family court did not achieve \r\n  the desired objective of placing her close to the economic position she enjoyed \r\n  during the coupleâ€™s marriage.Â  We agree that the court failed to provide adequate \r\n  alimony to Wife.Â  \r\n    \r\nAn award of alimony \r\n  rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 \r\n  S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Factors to be considered in making an alimony \r\n  award include:Â  (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health \r\n  of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history \r\n  and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living during the marriage; \r\n  (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7) current \r\n  and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and non-marital \r\n  properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct \r\n  or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and (13) other \r\n  factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  \r\n    \r\nAt the time of the trial, Wife was \r\n  sixty-one years old and did not have a high school diploma.Â  Wife brought a \r\n  pre-marital estate of $250,000 into the marriage. Â Wife stated the couple enjoyed \r\n  a â€œcomfortable lifestyleâ€ that included annual out-of-state vacations and a \r\n  timeshare in Myrtle Beach. Â Â Shortly after the parties married, Wife purchased \r\n  and operated a dry-cleaning business until she sold it in 1986.Â  As previously \r\n  discussed, Wife testified that she suffered from Raynaudâ€™s Disease, but she \r\n  held several part-time jobs during the marriage.Â  However, at the request of \r\n  Husband, Wife never obtained a permanent, full-time job after selling her dry-cleaning \r\n  business in 1986. \r\n    Wife received \r\n      $258.33 in gross monthly income from her part-time job, and she expected \r\n      to begin receiving Social Security income in the amount of $483 per month \r\n      upon reaching the age of sixty-two.Â  Wife listed $2,808 in expenses on her \r\n      financial declaration, which included the $943 mortgage payment made by \r\n      Husband.Â  \r\n    \r\nAt the time of the \r\n  final hearing, Husband was fifty-seven years old, had two years of a college \r\n  education, and the family court found he had a gross monthly income of $5,176, \r\n  and a net monthly income of $3,710. [4] Â  He had $3,173.83 in monthly expenses, including \r\n  paying $500 in alimony pursuant to the temporary order and paying the mortgage \r\n  on Wifeâ€™s house.Â  Although Husband denied he had an affair during the marriage, \r\n  he admitted he had a close secret friendship with one woman during the marriage \r\n  and a sexual relationship with another woman after the parties separated. \r\n    In awarding $400 \r\n      in monthly alimony, the family court noted that it considered all the relevant \r\n      factors set forth in section 20-3-130(C).Â  The order specifically noted \r\n      the partiesâ€™ ages, Husbandâ€™s income, Wifeâ€™s ability to work, and Wifeâ€™s \r\n      expectation of Social Security benefits.Â  Although not discussed in the \r\n      paragraph dealing with alimony, the court mentioned other facts that are \r\n      statutory considerations in section 20-3-130(C): the duration of the marriage, \r\n      Husbandâ€™s marital misconduct, and marital and non-marital properties. \r\n    \r\nReviewing the order \r\n  shows that the family court considered many of the factors relevant to an alimony \r\n  award.Â  However, we do not believe the court provided an adequate award of alimony \r\n  to Wife.Â  \r\n    \r\nThe order provided \r\n  that Wife would be responsible for the $943 mortgage payment on her home, leaving \r\n  her with expenses of $2,808.Â  Including the imputed minimum wage income of $885 \r\n  and the Social Security income of $483, Wifeâ€™s total income would be $1,368. [5] Â  This would leave her with a monthly deficit of $1,440.Â  Including \r\n  the $400 in alimony awarded by the family court, Wife will still have a deficit \r\n  of $1,040.Â  \r\n    \r\nHusband, on the other \r\n  hand, listed a gross monthly income of $5,176, and a net monthly income of $3,710.35.Â  \r\n  Reducing his $3,173.83 in expenses by the $943 mortgage payment assumed by Wife \r\n  and the $500 temporary alimony payment, Husband had expenses of $1,730.83.Â  \r\n  Thus, after paying his expenses and before calculating any alimony award, Husband \r\n  would have $1,979.52 in surplus funds.Â  \r\n    \r\nConsidering the significant \r\n  drop in Wifeâ€™s standard of living, Wifeâ€™s expenses, Husbandâ€™s income, and Husbandâ€™s \r\n  infidelity, we find the family court erred in only awarding $400 in alimony \r\n  to Wife.Â  We modify the award and order Husband to pay Wife $900 in alimony \r\n  beginning with the month of August 2004.Â  See Morris v. Morris, \r\n  335 S.C. 525, 533, 517 S.E.2d 720, 724 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding that even though \r\n  the family court applied the factors relevant to an alimony award, the award \r\n  was inadequate in light of the husbandâ€™s significant income, the drop in the \r\n  wifeâ€™s standard of living, and the husbandâ€™s adultery).Â  \r\n    II.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n      Apportionment of Property\r\n    Wife argues the \r\n      family court erred in apportioning the property.Â  She argues the method \r\n      used by the court to determine Husbandâ€™s interest in the home was erroneous \r\n      and the $62,250 award of special equity to Husband was excessive. [6] Â  She further argues the court \r\n      erred in dividing up various other items of personal property, including \r\n      the timeshare and the porch furniture. \r\n    \r\nThe apportionment of marital property \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bungener \r\n  v. Bungener, 291 S.C. 247, 251, 353 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Section \r\n  20-7-472 lists fifteen factors for the court to consider in equitably apportioning \r\n  a marital estate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2003); Greene v. Greene, \r\n  351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œAlthough nonmarital \r\n  property is not subject to equitable distribution as such, . . . the family \r\n  court may properly award the other spouse a special equity in the property.â€Â  \r\n  Greene, 352 S.C. at 337, 569 S.E.2d at 398.Â  A spouse has an equitable \r\n  interest in improvements to property to which he or she has contributed, even \r\n  if the property is nonmarital.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 299, \r\n  372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  On appeal, this court looks to the overall \r\n  fairness of the apportionment.Â  Id. at 300, 372 S.E.2d at 113.Â  If the \r\n  end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that the appellate court would have \r\n  arrived at a different apportionment.Â  Id.Â  \r\n    \r\nWife complains the family court erred \r\n  in calculating the amount of Husbandâ€™s special equity.Â  Wife provided $99,525.28 \r\n  of her personal, non-marital funds towards the construction of the partiesâ€™ \r\n  home such that only an $85,000 mortgage was needed.Â  The house was titled in \r\n  Wifeâ€™s name, and the mortgage was jointly titled in both partiesâ€™ names.Â  At \r\n  the time of the final hearing, the balance due on the mortgage was $40,949.44.Â  \r\n  The parties do not dispute that Husband made all of the mortgage payments on \r\n  the house, amounting to $130,500. \r\n    \r\nWife introduced an appraisal valuing \r\n  the home at $240,000.Â  Husbandâ€™s appraisal indicated the home was valued at \r\n  $270,000.Â  The family court adopted Husbandâ€™s valuation, and, after subtracting \r\n  the amount remaining on the mortgage, the family court determined the house \r\n  had a net equity of $229,000.Â  To determine the amount of equity due to Husband, \r\n  the court considered two methods of calculation.Â  First, Wifeâ€™s separate, non-marital \r\n  contribution to the acquisition of the home was subtracted from the net equity, \r\n  which resulted in $129,000 of equity to be divided between the parties.Â  Second, \r\n  the court considered the $130,500 Husband made in total mortgage payments as \r\n  equity to be divided equally between the parties.Â  The court adopted the second \r\n  method of valuation and determined Husband was due $65,250 in special equity \r\n  from Wife.Â Â  \r\n    \r\nWife argues this method of calculating \r\n  Husbandâ€™s special equity interest in the home was erroneous because the marital \r\n  portion of the net equity in the home was only 30.68 [7]  percent.Â  Thus, she asserts only \r\n  $70,272.71 [8]  of the equity \r\n  was marital and Husband was only entitled to $35,136.35. \r\n    \r\nAlthough the family court used an \r\n  unusual method to calculate Husbandâ€™s special equity, we find no error with \r\n  the fairness of the apportionment.Â  There is no set formula to assist the court \r\n  in dividing property.Â  See, e.g., Smith v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, \r\n  198, 363 S.E.2d 404, 407 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œIn valuing marital assets, the trial \r\n  court â€˜is fully within its discretion to choose the valuations of one party \r\n  over those of the other party.â€™â€).Â  Further, Husband paid all of the mortgage \r\n  payments on Wifeâ€™s home.Â  Husbandâ€™s special equity award only amounted to 28.5 \r\n  percent of the net equity of the home.Â  Because we find the special equity award \r\n  to be fair, the family court did not abuse its discretion in determining Husbandâ€™s \r\n  special equity in Wifeâ€™s home.Â  \r\n    \r\nFurther, we find no error with the \r\n  courtâ€™s determination that Husband was entitled to the timeshare and various \r\n  personal property items, including the porch furniture.Â  With the exception \r\n  of the General Electric stock, of which Wife received one-third, the court awarded \r\n  one-half of the marital assets to each party. Â Husband was awarded the timeshare \r\n  and ordered to pay Wife for her one-half interest in it.Â  An appraisal service \r\n  listed over 200 items of personal property in Wifeâ€™s home with a total value \r\n  of $14,457.Â  Husband indicated he wanted approximately fifty of those items, \r\n  valued at $3,607, which included the porch furniture.Â  The court awarded Husband \r\n  the items he requested.Â  Considering these facts, we find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  \r\n    \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n    The family court did not abuse \r\n      its discretion in imputing income to Wife or awarding special equity to \r\n      Husband.Â  However, the court erred in calculating the amount of the alimony \r\n      award.Â  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is \r\n    AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \r\n      \r\n    \r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ. and CURETON, \r\n  AJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n  \r\n   \r\n     [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n      to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n  \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      [2]  No children were born as a result of this marriage. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      [3]  Raynaudâ€™s Disease is defined as â€œa peripheral vascular disorder \r\n      found most frequently in females between the ages of 18 and 30.Â  It is characterized \r\n      by abnormal vasoconstriction of the extremities upon exposure to cold or \r\n      emotional stress.â€Â  Taberâ€™s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 1563-64 \r\n      (16th ed. 1989).\r\n  \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      [4]  Husband submitted a new financial declaration at the final hearing \r\n      that is not included in the record.Â  He testified regarding his income and \r\n      expenses and the family court adopted his amounts.Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      [5]  This assumption does not take into account the effect, if any, \r\n      that a full-time income would have on Wifeâ€™s ability to continue receiving \r\n      Social Security income.\r\n  \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      [6]  The family court found the home was titled solely in Wifeâ€™s name \r\n      and awarded Husband special equity in the home.Â  Although the court did \r\n      not specifically find that the home was Wifeâ€™s nonmarital property, it was \r\n      treated as such and the parties do not dispute that it was nonmarital.Â  \r\n      Husband, however, argues on appeal that the house was transmuted into marital \r\n      property.Â  The issue of transmutation was not raised to or ruled upon by \r\n      the family court judge and, thus, is not preserved for review.Â  McDavid \r\n      v.

Georgia French, and Mark French (collectively â€œPresidentialâ€) \r\n  appeal from an order denying their motion to compel arbitration.Â  We reverse. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nThis case arises out of a dispute concerning \r\n  brokerage services Presidential agreed to perform for investors David and Christine \r\n  March.Â  In September 1998, the Marches opened four brokerage accounts with Presidential.Â  \r\n  For each account, the Marches were required to sign various documents that set \r\n  forth the terms governing their relationship with the company.Â  \r\nOne of these documents, the â€œMedallion Account \r\n  Agreement,â€ contained the following notice in bold, capital letters: â€œI acknowledge \r\n  that the agreementâ€™s terms and conditions contain a predispute arbitration clause \r\n  on page 24 and acknowledge receipt of a copy of those terms and conditions.â€ \r\n  The arbitration clause referred to was contained in a separate booklet entitled \r\n  â€œMedallion Account Terms &amp; Conditions.â€Â  The clause provided that â€œall controversies \r\n  which may arise between [the Marches and Presidential] concerning any transaction \r\n  or the construction, performance, or breach of this or any other agreement between \r\n  us . . . shall be determined by arbitration.â€ The Marches do not dispute that \r\n  they signed all of the documents presented to them by Presidential representatives, \r\n  including the Medallion Account Agreement. \r\nBy 1999, Presidential had lost a significant portion \r\n  of the money in the Marchesâ€™ investment accounts.Â  Shortly thereafter, the Marches \r\n  closed their Presidential accounts.Â  A subsequent review of Presidentialâ€™s brokerage \r\n  actions convinced the Marches that Presidential had mismanaged their money.Â  \r\n  In October 2001, they initiated the present action against Presidential alleging \r\n  causes of action for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and violations \r\n  of the South Carolina Securities Act. \r\nPresidential denied the allegations and filed a \r\n  motion to dismiss and compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause \r\n  contained in the Medallion Account Agreement signed by the Marches.Â  Shortly \r\n  thereafter, the Marches amended their original complaint to allege Presidential \r\n  fraudulently induced them to sign all of the documents pertaining to the brokerage \r\n  agreement, including the document containing the arbitration clause. Â Specifically, \r\n  the Marches added a fifth cause of action for â€œFraud and Constructive Fraud \r\n  in Plaintiffâ€™s Signatures on Arbitration Provisions and Investment Incentive \r\n  Provisions.â€Â  Under this claim, they alleged, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n46.Â  After the funds were transferred \r\n  [to Presidential], on several occasions the Defendant Scott Key [a representative \r\n  of Presidential and named defendant in this action] came by the Plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  house with various papers that were to be signed.Â  He would generally uncover \r\n  only the part of the paper for a signature and told the Plaintiffs that they \r\n  needed to be signed for access to their accounts.Â  The Plaintiffs were never \r\n  given copies of the papers, were never given the option to read the papers and \r\n  any explanations given about the content of the papers were falsely answered.\r\n47.Â  The Plaintiffs were forwarded \r\n  copies of the papers after this suit was filed and found that numerous items \r\n  on the papers had been put in that were not there when the Plaintiffs signed \r\n  them.Â  The dates on the papers were changed or made up and numerous of these \r\n  papers were signed by Georgia French, who the Plaintiffs have never met.\r\n48. The representations and actions \r\n  by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs to induce them to sign these papers was \r\n  to obtain their consent to arbitration and their argument[ [2] ] to allow speculative investments by the Defendants. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the circuit court, the Marches argued \r\n  the determination of whether the arbitration clause was valid could not itself \r\n  be subject to arbitration but was rather a question for the court to decide.Â  \r\n  The circuit court agreed, allowing discovery to proceed on the sole issue of \r\n  the enforceability of the arbitration clause.Â  All of the other claims raised \r\n  by the Marches as to Presidentialâ€™s performance under the terms of the brokerage \r\n  agreement were held in abeyance pending the courtâ€™s determination on arbitration. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPresidential argues the circuit court erred in \r\n  denying its motion to compel arbitration.Â  We agree.\r\nIn Prima Paint Corporation v. Flood &amp; Conklin \r\n  Manufacturing Co., 388 U.S. 395, 406 (1967), the United States Supreme Court \r\n  held that general allegations of fraud in the inducement of a contract are insufficient \r\n  to prevent the invocation of the arbitration provision of the contract.Â  Our \r\n  state supreme court has explained how the rule of Prima Paint should \r\n  be applied by our courts:\r\n\r\nWe join the jurisdictions which \r\n  have rejected limiting the holding in Prima Paint. We hold a party cannot \r\n  avoid arbitration through rescission of the entire contract when there is \r\n  no independent challenge to the arbitration clause. Fraud as a defense to \r\n  an arbitration clause must be fraud specifically as to the arbitration clause \r\n  and not the contract generally.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Great W. Coal (Ky.), \r\n  312 S.C. 559, 562-63, 437 S.E.2d 22, 24 (1993) (emphasis added).\r\nIn this case, although the Marches amended their \r\n  complaint to separately plead a cause of action for fraudulent inducement of \r\n  the arbitration agreement, the allegations set forth in both the complaint and \r\n  the Marchesâ€™ affidavits only support their claim that they were fraudulently \r\n  induced to sign the entire contract, not specifically the arbitration clause. \r\n  [3] Â  Under the rule of Prima Paint and Great Western Coal, \r\n  therefore, it was improper for the circuit court to rule that the validity of \r\n  the arbitration clause was for the courtâ€™s determination.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court \r\n  is\r\n REVERSED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J. and CURETON, \r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  This is probably a typographical error that was \r\n    most likely intended to be â€œagreementâ€ rather than â€œargument.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [3]    In their joint affidavit, the Marches asserted: â€œWe were totally \r\n    and completely deceived with the entire matter of opening this account and \r\n    what was going to occur in connection with it.â€Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-432","title":"Charron v.

Rozelsky and Jennifer S. Barr, both of Greenville, for Appellant. \r\nW. Grady Jordan, and Robert T. Usry, both of Easley, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Robert H. Charron sued Horton Homes, Inc. to recover damages \r\n  for defects in a mobile home.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Charron \r\n  on his breach of warranty claims.Â  Horton appeals the trial courtâ€™s denial of \r\n  his motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict or \r\n  for a new trial.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nCharron purchased a mobile home manufactured by Horton from Discount Housing \r\n  Center.Â  Hortonâ€™s one-year limited warranty on the home stated â€œeach part of \r\n  the manufactured home shall be free under normal use and service from defects \r\n  in material and workmanship for a period of one (1) year after the initial delivery[.]â€Â  \r\n  The warranty required Charron to promptly report any defects to Discount Housing \r\n  or Hortonâ€™s service department to receive repairs.Â  Under the terms of the contract, \r\n  Discount Housing was responsible for handling and coordinating repairs.Â  \r\nCharron immediately experienced problems with the mobile home.Â  The \r\n  large sections of the home were misaligned by almost an inch and a half.Â  Water \r\n  leaked into the structure, shingles fell off, within a few months the foundation \r\n  skirting collapsed, and the walls were bowed.Â  Charron notified Discount Housing \r\n  and Horton of the structural problems.Â  Both companies repeatedly sent repairmen \r\n  to fix the defects, but the attempts at repair were unsatisfactory and serious \r\n  structural problems remained uncorrected. \r\nCharron brought this action for breach of warranties, negligence, \r\n  and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. [2] Â  At trial, the jury awarded Charron \r\n  $27,500 on his breach of warranty claim.Â  The trial court denied Hortonâ€™s post-trial \r\n  motions.Â  \r\nSCOPE\r\nOF REVIEW \r\nUpon appellate review \r\n  of an action at law tried by a jury, the juryâ€™s findings of fact will not be \r\n  disturbed unless the reviewing tribunal determines that no evidence in the record \r\n  supports the juryâ€™s conclusion.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  â€œFurthermore, in deciding motions \r\n  for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the evidence \r\n  and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to \r\n  the non-moving party.Â  If more than one inference can be drawn from the evidence, \r\n  the case must be submitted to the jury.â€Â  Bishop Logging Co. v. John Deere \r\n  Indus. Equip.Â  Co., 317 S.C. 520, 526, 455 S.E.2d 183, 186-87 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995).Â  \r\n  DISCUSSION\r\n  I.Â  Breach of \r\n    Warranties Claim\r\n  Horton contends the trial court \r\n    erred in submitting Charronâ€™s claim for breach of warranties to the jury, \r\n    arguing Charron failed to comply with the notice requirement of the express \r\n    warranty, all implied warranties were conspicuously disclaimed and, in any \r\n    event, Charron failed to prove breach of any implied warranties.Â  We disagree.\r\n  Horton claims Charron \r\n    failed to comply with the notice requirement of the sales contractâ€™s express \r\n    warranty, arguing he did not give Horton prompt notice of defects and an opportunity \r\n    to cure.Â  Whether Charron gave Horton reasonable notice and an opportunity \r\n    to cure is a question of fact properly reserved for the jury.Â  Draffin \r\n    v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 252 S.C. 348, 353, 166 S.E.2d 305, 308 (1969).Â  \r\n  \r\n  Under the express \r\n    warranty provision, â€œ[i]n order to obtain performance of any obligations under \r\n    the foregoing warranty the purchaser shall . . . [p]romptly report any defects \r\n    in materials or workmanship to [Discount Housing], or to the service department \r\n    of Horton Homes, Inc.â€Â  Charron testified he informed Discount Housing â€œfrom \r\n    day oneâ€ sections of the mobile home were misaligned. Â After Discountâ€™s \r\n    repairmen failed to cure the structural defects, Charron contacted Horton \r\n    repeatedly by telephone and in writing requesting further repairs.Â  In one \r\n    of his letters, Charron included a list of the numerous defects with the home. \r\n    Â Horton acknowledged it sent several repairmen out to the mobile home \r\n    in response to Charronâ€™s requests. Â Contrary to Hortonâ€™s assertions, \r\n    the record reveals Charron was in regular communication with Discount Housing \r\n    and Horton requesting repair service for numerous defects in the home.Â  \r\n  Horton further claims \r\n    it was denied the opportunity to cure the alleged defects, citing a single \r\n    instance when Charron refused a service call from a Horton repairman.Â  The \r\n    refusal occurred after months of repeated and unsuccessful service calls.Â  \r\n    Charron explained he declined the repairmanâ€™s request to attempt repairs for \r\n    two reasons.Â  First, the repairman called on a Sunday evening and wanted to \r\n    come then or the following day, which was Labor Day, neither of which was \r\n    acceptable to Charron.Â  Secondly, Charron had been assured by Horton that \r\n    factory employees would perform any required repair work, and the repairman \r\n    who called on this occasion advised Charron that he was an independent contractor.Â  \r\n    A month later, Charron again allowed Horton to send a repairman to his property. \r\n    Â Repairmen from Discount Housing and Horton made multiple trips to \r\n    Charronâ€™s home both before and after the refusal.Â  \r\n  The record contains \r\n    evidence of Charronâ€™s request for repairs and Hortonâ€™s admission it dispatched \r\n    repairmen to the home to repair defects.Â  This evidence is sufficient to create \r\n    a jury question as to whether the express warrantyâ€™s notice requirement was \r\n    met and, if so, whether there were adequate opportunities to cure any defects.Â  \r\n    Accordingly, we find the trial court properly submitted these questions of \r\n    fact on the issue of breach of express warranty to the jury. [3] Â  \r\n  II.Â  Competent Evidence of Damages\r\n  Horton contends the \r\n    circuit court erred in finding Charron presented competent evidence of damages \r\n    for his breach of warranty claims.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n  The trial court denied Hortonâ€™s \r\n    motions for a directed verdict based on the assertion Charron failed to prove \r\n    damages on his breach of warranty claims. Â A trial courtâ€™s grant or \r\n    denial of a directed verdict can only be reversed when there is no evidence \r\n    to support the ruling below.Â  Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine \r\n    Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 28-29, 491 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1997).Â  \r\n  A.Â  Measure of Damages\r\n  Charron presented \r\n    no evidence of the fair market value of the mobile home at the time he accepted \r\n    it for delivery.Â  Therefore, Horton asserts he failed to present sufficient \r\n    proof of damages as required by the Uniform Commercial Code.Â  The applicable \r\n    section of the U.C.C. measures a buyerâ€™s damages for breach as â€œthe difference \r\n    at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted \r\n    and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted . . . .â€Â  \r\n    South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-714(2) (2003).Â  \r\n  Although Charron did not present \r\n    evidence of the homeâ€™s value at the time of delivery, the $44,280 purchase \r\n    price is prima facie evidence of its warranted value, and his expert witness \r\n    testified partial repair costs for defects would be approximately $60,000.Â  \r\n    Long v. Quality Mobile Home Brokers, Inc., 271 S.C. 482, 484, 248 S.E.2d \r\n    311, 312-313 (1978) (stating a goodâ€™s purchase price is prima facie evidence \r\n    of its warranted value).Â  A competent estimate of the cost of repairs is sufficient \r\n    to create a factual question for the jury regarding damages.Â  Scott v. \r\n    Fort Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Works, Inc., 299 S.C. 449, 451, 385 S.E.2d \r\n    826, 827 (1989).Â  The record contains written estimates of the repair costs \r\n    supported by expert testimony.Â  Accordingly, there is ample evidence of damages \r\n    to sustain the trial judgeâ€™s denial of a directed verdict in favor of Horton.\r\n  B.Â  Qualification of Expert \r\n    Witness\r\n  Finally, Horton asserts Charronâ€™s \r\n    expert witness was not qualified to testify about repair methods or costs \r\n    for mobile homes.Â  We disagree.\r\n  Charronâ€™s expert witness was \r\n    a civil engineer licensed in three states and actively engaged in structural \r\n    engineering projects.Â  He personally designed support systems for buildings, \r\n    including mobile home roof trusses, and had previous work experience in a \r\n    mobile home manufacturing plant.Â  He also had considerable experience making \r\n    cost estimations for construction projects.Â  His specialized work experience \r\n    in structural engineering and cost estimation clearly made him more qualified \r\n    than the jury to give his opinion on the cost and extent of repairs required.Â  \r\n  \r\n  The qualification of an expert \r\n    witness and the admissibility of his testimony rest within the sound discretion \r\n    of the trial court.Â  Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 406, 570 S.E.2d \r\n    176, 183 (2002).Â  We will not disturb the courtâ€™s decision to exclude or admit \r\n    expert testimony absent a clear abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  â€œFor a court \r\n    to find a witness competent to testify as an expert, the witness must be better \r\n    qualified than the jury to form an opinion on the particular subject of the \r\n    testimony.â€Â  Id. (citing Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., \r\n    326 S.C. 248, 252-253, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997)).Â  Accordingly, we find \r\n    the trial court did not err in qualifying Charronâ€™s witness as an expert, \r\n    and his testimony was properly admitted.\r\n   AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., STILWELL, \r\n    J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Charron agreed not to pursue his cause of action under the \r\n    UTPA in exchange for Hortonâ€™s decision to abandon its motion challenging the \r\n    courtâ€™s jurisdiction.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  In light of our determination that Charronâ€™s claim for breach \r\n    of an express warranty was properly before the jury, the juryâ€™s general verdict \r\n    stands.Â  Because the juryâ€™s award could be predicated on Hortonâ€™s breach of \r\n    the express warranty alone, we need not address Hortonâ€™s questions regarding \r\n    disclaimer or breach of implied warranties.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-433","title":"Drakeford v.

Smith, of Columbia, \r\n          for Appellant.\r\n        William Lee Duda, of Columbia, \r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER \r\n  CURIAM:Â  Quay Drakeford brought this action for breach of employment contract \r\n  against his former employer, New South, Inc., asserting that an employee handbook \r\n  created an employment contract and New South breached this employment contract \r\n  and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  The trial court granted \r\n  New Southâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nDrakeford \r\n  was hired by New South, a lumber company, in 1995.Â  He worked there continuously \r\n  until he was terminated in 2000.Â  Shortly before his termination, Drakeford \r\n  was promoted to crew leader, supervising a six-person crew.Â  After Drakeford \r\n  became crew leader, a member of his crew asked to be reassigned.Â  When questioned \r\n  about her request, she began to cry and explained that Drakeford was a â€œbullyâ€ \r\n  and intimidated her.Â  She stated he used a â€œhatefulâ€ tone of voice and attitude \r\n  toward her.Â  Further investigation revealed several co-workers who said that \r\n  Drakeford referred to the distressed crew-member as â€œwhiteyâ€ when she was not \r\n  around and made other racially charged comments.Â  Additionally, it was alleged \r\n  he made verbal threats to another member of the crew.Â  \r\nThe \r\n  investigation also resulted in co-workers disclosing an incident in which Drakeford \r\n  allegedly used an open knife to point at another worker and made verbal threats \r\n  to that worker.Â  The co-worker who had been threatened with the knife also stated \r\n  that on another occasion, Drakeford came up behind him holding a piece of lumber \r\n  drawn back like a bat and when discovered said, â€œI could have got him if I wanted.â€Â  \r\n  \r\nBased \r\n  on its investigation of these allegations, New South terminated Drakeford for \r\n  creating a hostile work environment.Â  Drakeford sued New South for breach of \r\n  an employment contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  \r\n  Drakeford asserted that an employee handbook altered his at-will status, creating \r\n  an employment contract and that New South breached the employment contract when \r\n  it did not conform to an employee handbook policy creating a progressive disciplinary \r\n  policy. [2] Â  The trial court granted New Southâ€™s motion \r\n  for summary judgment, finding the employment handbook did not alter Drakefordâ€™s \r\n  at-will employment status, and without an employment contract there could be \r\n  no implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  The court subsequently \r\n  denied Drakefordâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe \r\n  purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do \r\n  not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. \r\n  58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when there \r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 \r\n  S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  The evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  \r\n  â€œIt is well established that summary judgment should be granted â€˜. . . in cases \r\n  in which plain, palpable and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds \r\n  cannot differ.â€™â€Â  Anders v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 307 S.C. \r\n  371, 373, 415 S.E.2d 406, 407 (Ct. App. 1992) (quoting Main v. Corley, \r\n  281 S.C. 525, 526, 316 S.E.2d 406, 407 (1984)); see Bloom v. Ravoira, \r\n  339 S.C. 417, 425, 529 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2000) (finding where a verdict is not \r\n  reasonably possible under the facts presented, summary judgment is proper).Â  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Timeliness of appeal\r\nNew South \r\n  argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal because Drakeford \r\n  failed to timely serve the notice of appeal. [3] Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nOn August \r\n  22, 2002, Drakeford received written notice of the trial courtâ€™s order granting \r\n  New Southâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  He timely served his motion to alter \r\n  or amend the judgment on September 3, 2002. \r\n  [4] Â  The trial court denied the motion in an order filed October 1, 2002.Â  \r\n  Drakeford served the notice of appeal on October 25, 2002.Â  \r\nRule 203(b)(1), \r\n  SCACR, provides, \r\n\r\n  A notice of appeal shall be served \r\n    on all respondents within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice \r\n    of entry of the order or judgment.Â  When a timely motion for judgment n.o.v. \r\n    (Rule 50, SCRCP), motion to alter or amend the judgment (Rules 52 and 59, \r\n    SCRCP), or a motion for a new trial (Rule 59, SCRCP) has been made, the time \r\n    for appeal for all parties shall be stayed and shall run from receipt of written \r\n    notice of entry of the order granting or denying such motion.Â  \r\n\r\nNew South asserts that the timely \r\n  filing of a motion to alter or amend merely tolls the running of the thirty \r\n  day period for serving the notice of appeal rather than the thirty day period \r\n  beginning anew after the appellant receives the order granting or denying the \r\n  motion.Â  Thus, it contends the eleven days between Drakefordâ€™s receipt of the \r\n  original order and his service of the motion to alter or amend must be counted \r\n  against his time for serving the notice of appeal.Â Â  \r\nWe disagree with this interpretation \r\n  of the rule.Â  Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR, clearly states the time for serving the \r\n  notice of appeal â€œshall run from receipt of written notice of entry of the order \r\n  granting or denying [the timely post-trial motion].â€Â  The supreme court reiterated, \r\n  â€œUnder Rule 59(f), when such a motion is made, the time for appeal from the \r\n  judgment begins to run from the time of the order granting or denying the motion.â€Â  \r\n  Otten v. Otten, 287 S.C. 166, 167, 337 S.E.2d 207, 208 (1985).Â  Thus, \r\n  Drakeford had thirty days from the date he received written notice of entry \r\n  of the order denying his motion to alter or amend to serve his notice of appeal.Â  \r\n  As he served the notice of appeal within thirty days of the trial courtâ€™s issuance \r\n  of the order, we find he timely served his notice of appeal.Â  Thus, this court \r\n  has jurisdiction to consider his appeal.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\nII.Â  \r\n  Breach of Contract\r\nDrakeford \r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because material issues \r\n  of fact existed concerning whether New Southâ€™s employee handbook created an \r\n  employment contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth \r\n  Carolina recognizes the doctrine of employment at will in wrongful termination \r\n  actions.Â  Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Coop., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 334, 516 \r\n  S.E.2d 923, 925 (1999).Â  Although some exceptions have been recognized, the \r\n  doctrine of employment at-will remains in South Carolina as a longstanding economic \r\n  incentive that provides the marketplace its necessary flexibility.Â  Prescott, \r\n  335 S.C. at 335, 442 S.E.2d at 925.Â  At-will employment may be terminated by \r\n  either party at any time, for any reason or for no reason at all.Â  Prescott \r\n  335 S.C. at 334, 516 S.E.2d at 925.Â  The general rule is that termination of \r\n  an at-will employee normally does not give rise to a cause of action for breach \r\n  of contract.Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 463, 560 \r\n  S.E.2d 606, 610 (2002).Â  \r\nHowever, \r\n  an employer and employee may choose to contractually alter the general rule \r\n  of employment at-will.Â  Prescott, 335 S.C. at 335, 442 S.E.2d at 925.Â  \r\n  An employee handbook may create such a contract.Â  Small v. Springs, 292 \r\n  S.C. 481, 485, 357 S.E.2d 452, 455 (1987).Â  The court in Small explained, \r\n  â€œIt is patently unjust to allow an employer to couch a handbook, bulletin, or \r\n  other similar material in mandatory terms and then allow him to ignore these \r\n  very policies as â€˜a gratuitous, nonbinding statement of general policyâ€™ whenever \r\n  it works to his disadvantage.â€ Id. at 485, 357 S.E.2d at 455.Â  \r\nAlthough the Small court instructed \r\n  that an employer may continue at-will employment by inserting a conspicuous \r\n  disclaimer into the handbook, the supreme court subsequently ruled a disclaimer \r\n  is merely one factor to consider in ascertaining whether the handbook as a whole \r\n  conveys credible promises that should be enforced.Â  Id.; Fleming v. \r\n  Borden, 316 S.C. 452, 450 S.E.2d 589, 596 (1994).Â  The court in Fleming \r\n  explained, â€œ[A] handbook that contains both promissory language and a disclaimer \r\n  should be viewed as inherently ambiguous.Â  Thus, . . . the entire handbook, \r\n  including any disclaimer, should be considered in determining whether the handbook \r\n  gives rise to a promise, an expectation and a benefit.â€Â  Id. at 463-64, \r\n  450 S.E.2d at 596&nbsp; (quoting Stephen F. Befort, Employee Handbooks and \r\n  the Legal Effect of Disclaimers, 13 Indus.Rel.L.J. 326, 375-76 (1991-92)).Â  \r\n  \r\nAfter \r\n  careful review of New Southâ€™s employee handbook, we find the provisions are \r\n  written in permissive language and accompanied by effective disclaimers of any \r\n  alteration of the at-will nature of employment. \r\nThe \r\n  â€œIntroductory Statementâ€ in New Southâ€™s employee handbook specifically states \r\n  that employment is at-will, and this sentiment is repeated throughout the text, \r\n  including a section entitled â€œNature of Employment.â€Â  The general tenor of the \r\n  handbook is as a source of information.Â  Additionally, upon receipt of the handbook, \r\n  Drakeford signed a form that was part of the handbook in which he acknowledged \r\n  â€œthat this handbook is neither a contract of employment nor a legal document.â€Â  \r\n  He admitted he had read the handbook after receiving it.Â  Drakeford also clearly \r\n  demonstrated his understanding of the basic principles underlying at-will employment, \r\n  as he explained his understanding of the handbook provisions as follows:Â  â€œThat \r\n  the person that is the employer has the right under any circumstance even one \r\n  that has been created, he can [terminate] you.Â  Even if you didnâ€™t do what was \r\n  stated that you did.â€Â  Typically, the question of whether a disclaimer is conspicuous \r\n  is a question of fact.Â  Williams v. Riedman, 339 S.C. 251, 264, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  28, 34&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â  However, considering the written statements in \r\n  the policy, the acknowledgment, and Drakefordâ€™s professed knowledge, we find \r\n  the only reasonable inference from the evidence is that New South made an effective \r\n  disclaimer. \r\nHowever, \r\n  as stated above, the simple existence of a disclaimer is not determinative.Â  \r\n  Instead, we must consider the actual language of the employment handbook to \r\n  determine if the handbookâ€™s provisions are couched in permissive or mandatory \r\n  language.Â  Examples of mandatory language from Conner include:Â  â€œ(1) \r\n  violations of the Code of Conduct â€˜will be disciplined,â€™ (2) â€˜discipline \r\n  shall be of an increasingly progressive nature,â€™ and (3) â€˜all employees \r\n  shall be treated fairly and consistently in all matters related to their \r\n  employment.â€™â€Â  Conner, 348 S.C. at 464 n.4, 560 S.E.2d at 611 n.4.Â  \r\nWe agree with the trial courtâ€™s determination \r\n  that the relevant sections of the New South employee handbook were couched in \r\n  permissive language.Â  The section on â€œProgressive Disciplineâ€ specified: \r\n\r\n  Although employment with New South \r\n    is based on mutual consent and both the employee and New South have the right \r\n    to terminate employment at will, with or without cause or advance notice, \r\n    New South may use progressive discipline at its discretion.Â  (emphasis \r\n    added).\r\n\r\nThe provision \r\n  further provided that â€œ[d]isciplinary action may call for any of three \r\n  steps,â€ and â€œ[t]here may be circumstances when one or more steps are \r\n  bypassed.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  When detailing the progressive policy, New South \r\n  stated that:Â  \r\n\r\n  Progressive discipline means that, \r\n    with respect to most disciplinary problems, these steps will normally \r\n    be followed:Â  a first offense may call for a verbal written warning; \r\n    a next offense may be followed by a written warning; another offense \r\n    of the same nature within 6 months may result in termination, or receipt \r\n    of a third written reprimand for different offenses within a 12 month period \r\n    may then lead to termination of employment.\r\n\r\n(emphasis \r\n  added).Â  In this provision, New South recognized â€œcertain types of employee \r\n  problems . . . are serious enough to justify either a suspension during investigation, \r\n  or, in extreme situations, termination of employment, without going through \r\n  the usual progressive discipline steps.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe â€œProgressive Disciplineâ€ provision \r\n  also referenced an â€œEmployee Conduct and Work Rulesâ€ policy, and stated that \r\n  it â€œincludes examples of problems that may result in immediate suspension \r\n  or termination of employment.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The â€œEmployee Conduct and \r\n  Work Rulesâ€ policy declares itself to be a non-exclusive list of conduct that \r\n  â€œmay result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of \r\n  employment. . .â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Included in the list of unacceptable behavior \r\n  is â€œ[f]ighting or threatening violence in the workplace,â€ â€œdisrespectful conduct,â€ \r\n  and â€œunlawful or unwelcome harassment.â€Â  This policy provision concludes by \r\n  stating â€œ[e]mployment with New South is at the mutual consent of New South and \r\n  the employee, and either party may terminate that relationship at any time, \r\n  with or without cause, and with or without advance notice.â€Â  \r\nDrakeford relies on Jones v. General \r\n  Electric Co., 331 S.C. 351, 503 S.E.2d 173 (Ct. App. 1998) in his argument \r\n  for reversal of the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment.Â  The handbook in \r\n  Jones also included a list of possible offenses in its Work Rules section. \r\n  Class I violations were described as behaviors â€˜â€œin which a single offense subjects \r\n  the involved employee(s) to dischargeâ€â€™ while Class II offenses provided for \r\n  progressive discipline for repeated violations and were described as â€œâ€˜offenses \r\n  which, with repetition, will lead to disciplinary time off and/or discharge.â€â€™Â  \r\n  Id. at 366-37, 503 S.E.2d at 181-82.Â  The Work Rules section of the handbook \r\n  in Jones, especially for Class II violations, used clearly mandatory \r\n  language with regard to punishment.Â  Furthermore, Jones testified that the G.E. \r\n  representatives instructed the new employees during orientation that the handbook \r\n  was G.E.â€™s â€œbible,â€ and that they abided by the procedures described therein.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  at 368, 503 S.E.2d at 182.Â  This court concluded, â€œ[T]here is a \r\n  material question of fact as to whether G.E.â€™s employee handbook, particularly \r\n  the section entitled Work Rules, established mandatory procedures or whether \r\n  the handbook contains merely permissive provisions outlining employee conduct.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 370, 503 S.E.2d at 183.\r\nIn contrast \r\n  to the handbook in Jones, the New South handbook consistently used permissive \r\n  language when discussing behavioral offenses and punishment.Â  Accordingly, we \r\n  find the facts of the present case distinguishable from those in Jones.Â  \r\n  \r\nDrakeford \r\n  also argues that his termination violates the â€œProblem Resolution (Grievance)â€ \r\n  policy of the employee handbook because New South made a commitment to an open \r\n  and frank atmosphere in which problems or complaints would be heard.Â  The handbookÂ  \r\n  provision upon which Drakeford relies stated a general commitment to fair treatment \r\n  and specifically promised that â€œ[n]o employee will be penalized, formally or \r\n  informally, for voicing a complaint with New South in a reasonable, business-like \r\n  manner, or for using the problem resolution procedure.â€Â  This provision does \r\n  not make any promise related to Drakeford, as he did not pursue the â€œProblem \r\n  Resolution (Grievance)â€ steps that are outlined in the policy.Â  \r\nDrakeford \r\n  further argues the trial court erred in not considering the entire handbook \r\n  and only focusing on the relevant provisions.Â  However, the circuit court explained \r\n  in the preamble of its order that it had considered all evidence in the record, \r\n  and the entire contract was in the record.Â  \r\nFurthermore, \r\n  our own review of the employment handbook demonstrates that New South had assumed \r\n  through mandatory language only finite and limited duties.Â  New South used mandatory \r\n  language to describe its duty to be an equal opportunity employer, make reasonable \r\n  accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, comply with legal \r\n  obligations, provide specified employment benefits, give paid holiday time for \r\n  specified holidays, comply with workersâ€™ compensation law, give specified sick \r\n  day benefits, give jury duty benefits, provide short and long term disability \r\n  benefits, offer a 401(k) savings plan, pay the employees on specified paydays, \r\n  make certain pay deductions as required by law, pay overtime, investigate all \r\n  reports of workplace violence, and provide various forms of leave.Â  Many of \r\n  the duties accepted by New South in its employee handbook are required by law \r\n  or provide guidelines that are essential to the operation of a business.Â  To \r\n  use these duties to find that an employeeâ€™s status had been altered from at-will \r\n  would severely undermine the at-will doctrine so as to make an informational \r\n  employment handbook impossible. \r\nAfter reviewing the employment handbook \r\n  at question in its entirety, we conclude Drakefordâ€™s at-will status was not \r\n  altered.Â  See Darby v. Horton Elec. Co., Op. No. 25839 (S.C. Sup. \r\n  Ct. filed July 6, 2004) (Shearouse Adv.Sh. No. 28 at 14, 23) (stating employerâ€™s \r\n  manual exemplified the appropriate manner in which to give employees a guide \r\n  regarding their employment without altering the at-will employment relationship \r\n  where the manual contained conspicuous disclaimers, which the employee understood \r\n  and the disciplinary procedure contained permissive language and did not provide \r\n  for mandatory progressive discipline).Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court \r\n  did not err in granting summary judgment to New South on Drakefordâ€™s claim for \r\n  breach of employment contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith \r\n  and fair dealing. [5] \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, \r\n  JJ., concur.Â \r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The â€œProgressive Disciplineâ€ policy states â€œa first offense may call \r\n    for a verbal warning; a next offense may be followed by a written warning; \r\n    another offense of the same nature within 6 months may result in termination. \r\n    . . .â€Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  New South originally raised this argument in a motion to dismiss.Â  \r\n    This court denied the motion on February 13, 2003.Â  New South renewed its \r\n    argument in its Respondentâ€™s brief.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Monday, September 2, 2002, was Labor Day.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is predicated \r\n    upon the existence of a contract.Â  Williams v.

[2] \r\nFACTS\r\nSaxon was driving along \r\n  Darby Plantation Road when she came to a stop sign and attempted a left turn \r\n  onto Route 39.Â  She stopped at the stop sign, drove her car forward to gain \r\n  a better view of Route 39, and then looked in both directions before turning.Â Â  \r\n  When Saxon pulled out, Thomas Coolerâ€™s vehicle struck the rear driverâ€™s side \r\n  door of Saxonâ€™s vehicle.Â  Cooler was driving at or below the speed limit of \r\n  45 miles per hour, and he did nothing to contribute to the accident. \r\nSaxon filed suit against \r\n  the DOT for negligence, alleging it failed to maintain the vegetation along \r\n  Route 39 and thereby failed to maintain the proper sight line and sight distance \r\n  for cars entering from Darby Plantation Road.Â  At trial, Saxon stated that she \r\n  did not see another car before turning and that prior to turning she had inched \r\n  her car past the stop sign to see past overgrown trees and bushes.Â  Cooler testified \r\n  that he was able to see the stop sign on Darby Plantation Road, but he did not \r\n  see Saxonâ€™s car until the accident. \r\nMr. Lohr, an engineer and \r\n  Saxonâ€™s expert witness, testified the DOT provided inadequate sight distance \r\n  along Route 39.Â  However, during cross-examination, he admitted the 468 feet \r\n  sight distance actually provided should have been sufficient for Saxon to detect \r\n  a vehicle traveling up to 47.7 miles per hour.Â  Because Coolerâ€™s car was traveling \r\n  less than 47.7 miles per hour, Lohr opined the intersectionâ€™s sight distance \r\n  was safe.Â  Dr. King, an expert witness for the DOT, also testified the intersection \r\n  had more than adequate sight distance.Â  Additionally, a highway patrolman, who \r\n  investigated the accident, testified he did not observe any visual obstructions \r\n  the day of the accident.Â  The trooper also stated:Â  he traveled the road frequently; \r\n  it was his duty to report any problems such as obstructions; and he never saw \r\n  any problems.Â Â  \r\nAfter the close of testimony, \r\n  the trial court granted the DOTâ€™s motion for a directed verdict because there \r\n  was no evidence:Â  (1) the accident was proximately caused by any breach of duty \r\n  by the DOT; and (2) the DOT had notice of the dangerous condition.Â  Pursuant \r\n  to Rule 59, SCRCP, Saxon moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) \r\n  and for a new trial.Â  The court denied these motions. Â Saxon appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the \r\n  trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably \r\n  can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the \r\n  motion and to deny the motion where either the evidence yields more than one \r\n  inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife \r\n  &amp; Marine Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 29, 491 S.E.2d 571, 573&nbsp;(1997).Â  \r\n  In deciding whether to grant or deny a directed verdict motion, the trial court \r\n  is concerned only with the existence or nonexistence of evidence.Â  Long v. \r\n  Norris &amp; Assocs., 342 S.C. 561, 568, 538 S.E.2d 5, 9 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n  This court can only reverse the trial court when there is no evidence to support \r\n  the ruling below.Â  Creech, 328 S.C. at 29, 491 S.E.2d at 573. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nSaxon argues the trial court erred in granting \r\n  a directed verdict on the issue of proximate cause.Â  She contends the evidence \r\n  is conflicting and supports the conclusion that the accident was proximately \r\n  caused by the DOTâ€™s negligence.Â  Because this issue required a credibility determination, \r\n  she asserts it should have been submitted to the jury. \r\n  [3] Â  We disagree. \r\nIn a negligence action, a plaintiff must show:Â  \r\n  (1) the defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant breached \r\n  the duty by a negligent act or omission; (3) the defendantâ€™s breach was the \r\n  actual and proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury; and (4) the plaintiff \r\n  suffered an injury or damages.Â  Andrade v. Johnson,&nbsp;356 S.C. 238, \r\n  245, 588 S.E.2d 588, 592&nbsp;(2003).Â  â€œProximate cause requires proof of both \r\n  causation in fact and legal cause, which is proved by establishing foreseeability.â€Â  \r\n  Bray v. Marathon Corp.,&nbsp;356 S.C. 111, 116-17, 588 S.E.2d 93, 95&nbsp;(2003).Â  \r\n  â€œCausation in fact is proved by establishing the plaintiffâ€™s injury would not \r\n  have occurred â€˜but forâ€™ the defendantâ€™s negligence. . . .Â  Legal cause turns \r\n  on the issue of foreseeability.Â  An injury is foreseeable if it is the natural \r\n  and probable consequence of a breach of duty.â€Â  Schmidt v. Courtney, \r\n  357 S.C. 310, 326, 592 S.E.2d 326, 335&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œForeseeability \r\n  is not determined from hindsight, but rather from the defendantâ€™s perspective \r\n  at the time of the alleged breach.â€ Parks v. Characters Night Club, 345 \r\n  S.C. 484, 491, 548 S.E.2d 605, 609 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œFurthermore, legal cause \r\n  is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury.Â  Only when the evidence is susceptible \r\n  to only one inference does it become a matter of law for the court.â€Â  Oliver \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 309 S.C. 313, 317, \r\n  422 S.E.2d 128, 131 (1992).Â  \r\nIn this case, the trial court granted a directed \r\n  verdict on the ground Saxon failed to present any evidence the accident was \r\n  proximately caused by a breach of duty by the DOT.Â  Specifically, the court \r\n  found:Â  (1) neither Saxon nor Cooler testified that inadequate sight distance \r\n  caused the accident; and (2) Saxonâ€™s expert, Lohr, testified that inadequate \r\n  sight distance was not the cause of the accident.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Saxon, we find Saxon failed \r\n  to present any evidence that the DOTâ€™s failure to maintain the vegetation proximately \r\n  caused the accident.Â  Saxonâ€™s own expert witness testified the sight lines were \r\n  insufficient because of overgrown bushes and trees only if a car was driving \r\n  on Route 39 in excess of 47.7 miles per hour. Â Â Â However, it was stipulated \r\n  that the speed limit was 45 miles per hour and that Cooler was driving at or \r\n  below the speed limit.Â  Cooler also acknowledged that the bushes did not obstruct \r\n  his view.\r\nSaxon argues, notwithstanding the testimony of \r\n  her own expert witness, the lay testimony was sufficient to submit the issue \r\n  of proximate cause to the jury.Â  Saxon refers to her direct testimony in which \r\n  she stated that she had to inch up before pulling out to turn left â€œ[b]ecause \r\n  the trees and bushes are overgrown and itâ€™s kinda hard to see all the way down \r\n  Malphrus Road to your left.â€ Â She also points out that she and Cooler both testified \r\n  that even though they were looking, they did not see the other vehicle until \r\n  after the accident.Â  In light of this testimony, Saxon urges this court to reverse \r\n  based on Poston v. Southeastern Constr. Co., 208 S.C. 35, 36 S.E.2d 858 \r\n  (1946), and Roscoe v. Grubb, 237 S.C. 590, 118 S.E.2d 337 (1961).Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn Poston, a workerâ€™s compensation case, \r\n  the claimant testified that an accident at work caused his eyes to become inflamed \r\n  and, in turn, severely affected his vision.Â  Due to the accident, he was unable \r\n  to perform the same types of carpentry jobs he did before the accident.Â  The \r\n  treating physician testified the claimant came to him with red, inflamed, and \r\n  irritated eyes. In contrast to the claimantâ€™s testimony, he stated, as â€œa medical \r\n  fact,â€ the claimantâ€™s farsightedness could not have been caused by any event \r\n  but must have existed all of the claimantâ€™s life.Â  The claimant was awarded \r\n  benefits for the work-related injury.Â  In considering the employerâ€™s appeal, \r\n  our supreme court found that had the case been tried before a jury, the trial \r\n  judge would have submitted the issue to the jury because there was a conflict \r\n  between the claimantâ€™s testimony and the medical testimony.Â  Poston, \r\n  208 S.C. at 38, 36 S.E.2d at 860.Â  The court stated, â€œa medical opinion which \r\n  conflicts with the physical facts will not be permitted to control the determination \r\n  of a factual controversy.â€Â  Id. (citations omitted).Â  The court affirmed \r\n  the award of benefits, finding sufficient lay testimony that the claimantâ€™s \r\n  reduced vision was caused by the accident.Â  The court pointed to the evidence \r\n  that prior to the accident, the claimant had been able to work as a carpenter \r\n  without the aid of glasses.Â  The court held that when expert testimony is disregarded, \r\n  the decision must be based on other competent evidence.Â  Id. at 39.\r\nSimilarly, in Roscoe, the court disregarded \r\n  the testimony of a physician that the decedent died as a result of an automobile \r\n  accident that occurred almost one year prior to the death.Â  Roscoe, 237 \r\n  S.C. at 592-93, 118 S.E.2d at 338.Â  The court noted that â€œwhere physical injury \r\n  is coincident with or immediately follows an accident and is naturally and directly \r\n  connected with it lay testimony may be sufficient to carry to the triers of \r\n  the facts the issue of whether or not the accident proximately caused it, despite \r\n  expert medical testimony that it did not.â€Â  Id. at 596, 118 S.E.2d at \r\n  340.Â  Together, these cases properly situate the expert witnessâ€™s testimony \r\n  as non-binding and intended to aid the fact finder.Â  Hines v. Pac. Mills, \r\n  214 S.C. 125, 132, 51 S.E.2d 383, 385 (1949).\r\nIn the instant case, expert witnesses for both \r\n  Saxon and the DOT testified that given the speed of Coolerâ€™s vehicle there was \r\n  sufficient sight distance, and thus, the vegetation did not in fact cause the \r\n  accident.Â  In contrast to the pointedly different testimony in Poston, \r\n  neither Saxon nor Cooler testified the accident was caused by an inability to \r\n  properly see because of an overgrowth of vegetation.Â  Cooler testified he could \r\n  see the stop sign, but he never saw Saxonâ€™s vehicle.Â  Saxon testified that difficulty \r\n  in seeing down Route 39 caused her to inch past the stop sign prior to turning, \r\n  and she did not see any cars prior to turning onto Route 39.Â  She, however, \r\n  did not testify she was unable to see Coolerâ€™s vehicle because of the overgrowth.Â  \r\n  Instead, she testified the overgrowth forced her to take another action, which \r\n  involved moving her car forward.Â  Saxon was also vague in her testimony regarding \r\n  how far down the road she could see.Â  Although she testified that she could \r\n  not see â€œall the way downâ€ the road, this testimony did not quantify the sufficiency \r\n  of her sight distance.Â  Even construing Saxonâ€™s testimony in the light most \r\n  favorable to her, as we are required to do, we find there is no testimony or \r\n  inferences to be drawn as to causation in fact.Â  Accordingly, the trial court \r\n  properly directed a verdict in favor of the DOT. \r\n\r\nII.\r\nSaxon asserts the trial court erred in granting \r\n  the DOTâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the issue of notice.Â  She contends \r\n  the issue should have been submitted to the jury because the DOT conceded there \r\n  was evidence of a breach of duty, which necessarily encompasses notice, and \r\n  moreover, the DOT failed to affirmatively show a lack of notice. \r\nâ€œThe South Carolina Tort Claims Act provides that \r\n  the State, its agencies, political subdivisions, and other governmental entities \r\n  are â€˜liable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a private \r\n  individual under like circumstances,â€™ subject to certain limitations and exemptions \r\n  with the Act.â€Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 344, 585 S.E.2d \r\n  281, 283 (2003) (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. 2002)).Â Â Â Â  Section \r\n  15-78-60 of the South Carolina Code provides several exceptions to the waiver \r\n  of sovereign immunity.Â  â€œThese exceptions act as limitations on the liability \r\n  of a governmental entity.â€ Id. at 344, 585 S.E.2d at 283.Â  Among these \r\n  exceptions is one providing that a government entity is not liable for a loss \r\n  resulting from â€œnatural conditions of unimproved property of the governmental \r\n  entity, unless the defect or condition causing a loss is not corrected by the \r\n  particular governmental entity responsible for the property within a reasonable \r\n  time after actual or constructive notice of the defect or condition.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60 (10) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nTherefore, the DOT cannot be liable for Saxonâ€™s \r\n  injuries unless the defect or condition that caused her injuries was not corrected \r\n  â€œwithin a reasonable time after actual or constructive notice of the defect \r\n  or condition.â€Â  See Richardson v. City of Columbia, 340 S.C. 515, \r\n  522, 532 S.E.2d 10, 14 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding City of Columbia not liable \r\n  for childâ€™s injuries sustained at baseball field â€œunless the defect or condition \r\n  that caused his injuries was â€˜not corrected by the particular governmental entity \r\n  responsible for maintenance, security, or supervision within a reasonable time \r\n  after actual notice of the defect or conditionâ€™â€ (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(16) \r\n  (Supp. 1999))).Â  The exceptions outlined within the Act must be liberally construed \r\n  in favor of limiting liability.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-20 (f) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  The burden of establishing an exception to the waiver of immunity under the \r\n  Tort Claims Act is upon the DOT.Â  Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Juvenile \r\n  Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 324, 566 S.E.2d 536, 540 (2002).Â  \r\nThe DOT sought to meet this burden by the testimony \r\n  of the highway patrolman.Â  The trooper testified that he traveled the road frequently, \r\n  it was his duty to report any problems, and he never saw any problems.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  a search of records showed no history of prior accidents at this intersection.Â  \r\n  Based upon the stipulation that there was no record of prior accidents at this \r\n  intersection and the testimony of the trooper, the DOT established it did not \r\n  have actual notice of a dangerous condition. See Richardson, 340 \r\n  S.C. at 525, 532 S.E.2d at 15 (holding City of Columbia did not have actual \r\n  notice of any condition or defect prior to childâ€™s accident at baseball field \r\n  where there were no prior complaints that the area was dangerous and no prior \r\n  injuries).Â  \r\nSaxon, however, argues the DOT did have constructive \r\n  notice of overgrowth and reduced sight lines.Â  Specifically, Saxon asserts the \r\n  DOT was charged with constructive notice given it failed to anticipate and discover \r\n  the obstruction by making frequent and careful inspections. \r\nâ€œConstructive notice is a legal inference which \r\n  substitutes for actual notice.Â  It is notice imputed to a person whose knowledge \r\n  of facts is sufficient to put him on inquiry; if these facts were pursued with \r\n  due diligence, they would lead to other undisclosed facts.â€ Strother v. Lexington \r\n  County Recreation Commâ€™n,&nbsp;332 S.C. 54, 63 n.6, 504 S.E.2d 117, 122 \r\n  n.6&nbsp;(1998).Â  Constructive notice requires knowledge of facts sufficient \r\n  to have led the DOT to the danger.Â  The trooper, however, testified that he \r\n  was at the scene immediately after the accident and saw no problem with vegetation \r\n  overgrowth.Â  Despite this testimony, Saxon relies on Campbell v. South Carolina \r\n  State Highway Depâ€™t, 244 S.C. 186, 135 S.E.2d 838 (1964), overruled on \r\n  other grounds by McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985) \r\n  (abolishing the doctrine of sovereign immunity); Inabinett v. South Carolina \r\n  State Highway Depâ€™t, 196 S.C. 117, 12 S.E.2d 848 (1941); and Ford v. \r\n  South Carolina Depâ€™t. of Transp., 328 S.C. 481, 492 S.E.2d 811 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997), for the proposition that the duty owed by the DOT to maintain safe roads \r\n  would require this court to find constructive notice and liability in this case.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe DOT does in fact have a duty \r\n  to maintain safe roads and to discover and remedy potential hazards; however, \r\n  under the specific facts of this case, all testimony points to the existence \r\n  of adequate sight lines.Â  The DOT cannot be charged with constructive notice \r\n  that a dangerous condition existed when there is no testimony that any dangerous \r\n  condition actually existed.Â  Furthermore, each of the above-cited cases is distinguishable \r\n  from the instant case.Â  Unlike this case, there was evidence in each of the \r\n  cases regarding the dangerous condition prior to the incident that was the subject \r\n  of the lawsuit.Â  See Campbell, 244 S.C. at 190-91, 135 S.E.2d \r\n  at 840 (affirming denial of highway departmentâ€™s post-trial motions in case \r\n  involving motorcycle accident on negligently maintained mountain road where \r\n  highway department had on occasion repaired the road and was aware that the \r\n  drainage system was insufficient to take care of excess water); Inabinett, \r\n  196 S.C. at 123-24, 12 S.E.2d at 850 (affirming denial of highway departmentâ€™s \r\n  post-trial motions in case for personal injuries sustained when a tree alongside \r\n  a public highway fell onto plaintiffâ€™s vehicle where plaintiff offered testimony \r\n  that highway department was on constructive notice of the dangerous condition \r\n  given the decay of the tree was visible and the highway department had examined \r\n  the surrounding road shortly before the accident but had not discovered the \r\n  condition of the tree); Ford, 328 S.C. at 487-89, 492 S.E.2d at 814-15 \r\n  (reversing grant of summary judgment in favor of highway department in case \r\n  arising from death of motorcyclist who collided with a fallen tree on the road \r\n  where department worked in the area intermittently in the weeks immediately \r\n  preceding the accident and an area neighbor informed the department prior to \r\n  the accident that trees were falling onto the road and were dangerous).\r\nBecause there was no actual notice of a dangerous condition, and it is impossible \r\n  to charge the DOT with constructive notice of a dangerous condition when there \r\n  is no testimony of a dangerous condition, we find the trial court properly directed \r\n  a verdict in favor of the DOT.Â  Thus, even assuming the DOTâ€™s improper maintenance \r\n  of the vegetation proximately caused Saxonâ€™s injuries, the DOT was immune from \r\n  liability under the Tort Claims Act given it did not have actual or constructive \r\n  notice of the defect or condition.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, \r\n  the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, CJ., STILWELL, J., and CURETON, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Saxon also filed suit against Thomas Cooler, the driver of the other \r\n    vehicle.Â  After discovery was completed, Saxon dismissed Cooler as a party. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  We note the DOT concedes in \r\n    its brief that Saxon presented â€œevidence of all of the elements of negligence \r\n    except proximate cause.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-436","title":"The Connecticut Indemnity Co. v.

[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1992, Tyrone Davis suffered extensive damage to his home during a fire.Â  \r\n  Davis hired contractor Francis Richard Burgess to repair the damage.Â  Burgess \r\n  was licensed by the Residential Builderâ€™s Commission (â€œthe Commissionâ€), and \r\n  Connecticut provided Burgess with a license bond. \r\nA dispute arose between Davis and Burgess concerning Burgessâ€™s performance.Â  \r\n  Davis complained to the Commission, which issued an order on November 9, 1995, \r\n  directing Burgess to correct the omissions in his performance.Â  Davis contacted \r\n  Connecticut and requested the surety pay for the repairs.Â Â  \r\nConnecticut wrote to Burgess requesting he respond \r\n  to Davisâ€™s allegations. Â Burgess informed Connecticut that he had settled \r\n  all issues with Davis, that he had been released, and that Davis was trying \r\n  to get something for nothing.Â  Burgess provided Connecticut with a copy of the \r\n  September 8, 1995 letter from the Commission stating the case had been officially \r\n  closed.Â  Connecticut sought clarification regarding the discrepancy between \r\n  the September 8, 1995 letter and the November 9, 1995 order from the Commission.Â  \r\n  The Commission informed Connecticut that the previous â€œdismissalâ€ of the case \r\n  was only for the purpose of clearing its records and that the order in no way \r\n  relieved Burgess or Connecticut of their responsibilities to make corrections. \r\n\r\nConnecticut filed the underlying declaratory judgment \r\n  action requesting the trial court declare whether Davis was entitled to compensation \r\n  under the bond.Â  Connecticut asked the trial court to declare whether it was \r\n  â€œentitled to be fully and completely indemnified by the defendant Burgess, including \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees, pursuant to the terms of the indemnity agreement between the \r\n  parties.â€Â  Davis counterclaimed for, among other things, bad faith refusal to \r\n  pay.Â Â  After repeated postponements, this case finally came up for trial on \r\n  September 16, 2002. \r\nAt trial, Davis and Burgess settled their dispute for $6,500.Â  As part of the \r\n  settlement, both Davis and Burgess agreed to withdraw any claims they may have \r\n  had against Connecticut.Â  The trial court dismissed the case, finding the only \r\n  claim left was for a declaration of the terms of the indemnity agreement, and \r\n  for a declaration that the agreement required Burgess to pay Connecticutâ€™s attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs incurred in bringing the action. Â The court found the \r\n  remaining action to be a breach of contract action, concluded that it was inappropriate \r\n  to determine the contract issue in a declaratory judgment action, and dismissed \r\n  the case.Â  Connecticut filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied. \r\n  Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nDeclaratory judgment actions are neither legal nor equitable.Â  Wiedemann \r\n  v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 344 S.C. 233, 236, 542 S.E.2d 752, 753 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).Â  Therefore, the standard of review for a declaratory judgment action \r\n  is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Id.Â  The remaining \r\n  issue on appeal is a determination of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs pursuant to \r\n  the indemnity agreement.Â  Interpreting the terms of an agreement is an action \r\n  at law.Â  Barnacle Broad., Inc. v. Baker Broad., Inc., 343 S.C. 140, 146, \r\n  538 S.E.2d 672, 675 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that interpretation of a contract \r\n  is an action at law); see also Weatherford v.

We agree. \r\n\r\n    â€œUnder the Declaratory Judgment Act, a party \r\n      whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a contract \r\n      may seek a courtâ€™s determination of any question of construction or validity \r\n      of the contract and obtain a declaration of the partyâ€™s rights, status, \r\n      or other legal relations thereunder.â€Â  Graham v.

App. 2002), cert. denied (June \r\n  12, 2003).Â  â€œA justiciable controversy exists when a concrete issue is present, \r\n  there is a definite assertion of legal rights and a positive legal duty which \r\n  is denied by the adverse party.â€Â  Graham, 319 S.C. at 71, 459 S.E.2d \r\n  at 845.Â Â  \r\nAt the time Connecticut brought the declaratory judgment action, a justiciable \r\n  controversy existed. It was not clear whether Burgess had been released, whether \r\n  Connecticut needed to pay Davis, or whether Burgess was required to reimburse \r\n  Connecticut or pay fees and costs under the indemnity agreement. When Burgess \r\n  and Davis settled at trial, the issue of determining if Burgess owed Davis became \r\n  moot. In addition, because Burgess and Davis agreed in the settlement to withdraw \r\n  any potential claims against Connecticut, the trial court no longer needed to \r\n  declare whether Burgess must indemnify Connecticut for any amount Connecticut \r\n  would have paid Davis. \r\nHowever, Connecticut's request that the trial court declare whether Burgess \r\n  owed Connecticut attorney's fees and costs pursuant to the indemnity agreement \r\n  was still before the trial court. We find the trial court committed an error \r\n  of law in finding the action was transformed into a breach of contract action, \r\n  prematurely dismissing the case, and failing to proceed further to determine \r\n  Connecticut's entitlement to attorney's fees and costs pursuant to the indemnity \r\n  agreement. Therefore, we reverse and remand this case to the trial court for \r\n  a determination of whether the indemnity agreement authorizes Connecticut to \r\n  receive attorney's fees and costs. If the trial court determines Connecticut \r\n  is entitled to fees, the trial court shall establish the amount of fees and \r\n  costs to be awarded.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n     [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n      to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-437","title":"South Carolina Department of Social Services v.

[1] Â  A toddler was injured in Almeidaâ€™s absence. \r\n  [2] Â  Bright Ideas also had a history of repeated regulatory infractions, \r\n  many concerning staff training and supervision of children. \r\nOn February 3, 2003, the Lexington County Department of Social Services initiated \r\n  an action to enjoin Bright Ideas and Angela Almeida from providing daycare services.Â  \r\n  Prior to the scheduled hearing, however, DSS and Bright Ideas reached an accommodation \r\n  allowing the daycare to continue operating.Â  The parties agreed that if Angela \r\n  Almeida was enjoined from participating in any daycare activities, Bright Ideas \r\n  could continue to operate with a new owner and director.Â  Angela Almeidaâ€™s husband, \r\n  Tim, was named owner/operator and an existing employee became the director.Â  \r\n  It was also agreed that Bright Ideas, DSS, and their attorneys would ensure \r\n  appropriate child-to-staff ratios and staffing compliance, including reductions \r\n  in child population as deemed necessary and that DSS would monitor the facility \r\n  every day.Â  By order dated February 4, 2003, the family court adopted the agreement.Â  \r\n  The order also stated, the â€œ[r]uling on injunction shall be held in abeyance \r\n  pending strictest and fullest compliance with above agreement or this matter \r\n  will be brought back before the Court.â€ \r\nA dispute soon arose as to appropriate child-to-staff ratios, and Bright Ideas \r\n  declined to sign a corrective action plan requiring it to limit the number of \r\n  children under the age of two and reduce its overall child daycare population.Â  \r\n  On February 11, 2003, DSS moved for a hearing on the original request for injunctive \r\n  relief because Bright Ideas failed to comply with the agreement respecting reductions \r\n  in child daycare population. \r\nAfter a hearing, the family court issued an order finding Bright Ideas posed \r\n  a substantial threat of harm to the public and children of Lexington County \r\n  in its â€œformer or present configuration.â€ As a result, the court permanently \r\n  enjoined Angela Almeida and Bright Ideas from providing daycare services. \r\n  [3] Â  Â Bright Ideas appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to grant injunctive relief rests within \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned absent an \r\n  abuse of that discretion. City of Columbia v. Pic-A-Flick Video, Inc., \r\n  340 S.C. 278, 282, 531 S.E.2d 518, 520-21 (2000). â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs \r\n  when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by \r\n  an error of law.â€ County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, \r\n  560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBright Ideas argues the family court erred in entering a permanent injunction \r\n  barring the daycare from future operations because there is no evidence to support \r\n  the injunction.Â  As the basis for this assertion, Bright Ideas claims it has \r\n  complied with the DSS requirements by severing all ties with Angela Almeida \r\n  and by operating without incident under its new management.Â  \r\nIn analyzing this issue, it is instructive to consider the underlying purpose \r\n  for injunctions.Â  The inherent purpose behind the equitable remedy of a temporary \r\n  injunction is to preserve the status quo.Â  Simpkins, 348 S.C. at 671, \r\n  560 S.E.2d at 905 (â€œâ€˜[A] temporary injunction is [used] to preserve the subject \r\n  of controversy in the condition which it is at the time of the Order until opportunity \r\n  is offered for full and deliberate investigation and to preserve the existing \r\n  status during litigation.â€™â€ (quoting County Council of Charleston v. Felkel, \r\n  244 S.C. 480, 483-84, 137 S.E.2d 577, 578 (1964))).Â  In contrast, â€œ[a] permanent \r\n  injunction is issued primarily to prevent future acts of harm and, unless specified \r\n  otherwise in the order, is unlimited in respect of time.â€Â  Bear v. Iowa Dist. \r\n  Court for Tama County, 540 N.W.2d 439, 441 (Iowa 1995);Â  see 42 Am. \r\n  Jur. 2d Injunctions Â§ 2 (2000) (â€œInjunctive relief is designed to meet \r\n  a real threat of a future wrong or a contemporary wrong of a nature likely to \r\n  continue or recur.Â  Whether interlocutory or final, injunctive relief is ordinarily \r\n  preventive or protective in character and restrains actions that have not yet \r\n  been taken.Â  It is generally not intended to redress, or punish for, past wrongs.â€).Â  \r\n  Furthermore, â€œ[p]ermanent injunctions â€˜are permanent so long as the conditions \r\n  which produce the injunction remain permanent.â€™â€Â  Bear, 540 N.W.2d at \r\n  441 (quoting Condura Constr. Co. v. Milwaukee Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades \r\n  Council AFL, 99 N.W.2d 751, 755 (Wis. 1959)).Â Â  \r\nThis distinction is significant when compared with the terms of the statute \r\n  that was the basis for the injunction.Â  DSS is authorized by section 20-7-3010 \r\n  to seek injunctive relief to prohibit the operation of a childcare facility \r\n  â€œ(1) when a facility is operating without a license or statement of registration; \r\n  (2) when there is any violation of this subarticle or of the regulations promulgated \r\n  by the department which threatens serious harm to children in the childcare \r\n  facility; (3) when an operator has repeatedly violated this subarticle or the \r\n  regulations of the department.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-3010 (Supp. 2003).Â  In \r\n  cases where, as here, the injunction sought is specifically authorized by statute \r\n  and the party seeking the injunction is a government entity, the government \r\n  entity must simply show (1) there is a statutory provision covering the situation; \r\n  and (2) that there is a violation of that provision. Simpkins, 348 S.C. \r\n  at 669, 560 S.E.2d at 905. â€œIn such circumstances, no showing of irreparable \r\n  harm need be made by the party seeking the injunction, nor must the court consider \r\n  whether the injunction is in the public interest.â€ Id. at 669, 560 S.E.2d \r\n  at 905 (quoting 42 Am. Jur. 2d Injunctions Â§ 23 (2000)).\r\n In order to obtain its requested injunction against Bright Ideas, DSS needed \r\n  to show evidence which would tend to establish any one of the three enumerated \r\n  grounds prescribed by section 20-7-3010.Â  As evidenced by the family courtâ€™s \r\n  order, DSS pursued the injunction under the second subsection, â€œwhen there is \r\n  any violation of this subarticle or of the regulations promulgated by the department \r\n  which threatens serious harm to children in the childcare facility.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-3010 (2) (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added).Â  By using the \r\n  term â€œthreatens,â€ we believe the General Assembly intended to abate future misconduct.Â  \r\n  This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of a permanent injunction, \r\n  i.e., to prevent future acts of harm.Â  See Strother v. Lexington \r\n  County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998) (â€œThe \r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative \r\n  intent whenever possible.â€); Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 \r\n  S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992) (stating the words of the statute \r\n  must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or \r\n  forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation).Â Â Â  \r\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to the facts \r\n  of the instant case.Â  During the period after DSS and Bright Ideas entered into \r\n  the agreement for bringing the center into compliance with DSS standards and \r\n  regulations, which were incorporated into an order of the family court, there \r\n  is no evidence that Bright Ideas failed to comply with DSS instructions or that \r\n  the DSS inspections indicated any problems with the quality of care provided \r\n  at Bright Ideas.Â  Indeed, the testimony of the DSS officials in the record before \r\n  us indicates the contrary.Â  When asked if there were any problems after Bright \r\n  Ideas began operating under the strict oversight of DSS, the DSS investigators \r\n  and other officials all indicated that the center was in full compliance with \r\n  the safety plan.Â  The only witness who could articulate a reason why Bright \r\n  Ideas, in its operation under the safety plan, should not be allowed to remain \r\n  open, was Helen Lebby, assistant director for childcare licensing and regulation \r\n  at DSS.Â  She testified that â€œthings [at Bright Ideas] are going to be fine as \r\n  long as [the Bright Ideas owner and operators] know that [DSS] will be out there \r\n  every day the way [we] are now . . . .â€Â  However, this concern that Bright Ideas \r\n  would lapse out of compliance with the safety plan if routine daily inspections \r\n  were discontinued is based solely on speculation.Â  There is no evidence in the \r\n  record to establish that Bright Ideas, under the current management, will operate \r\n  in violation of section 20-7-3010.\r\nConsidering the terms of the statute and the purpose \r\n  of a permanent injunction, we find no evidence to support the family courtâ€™s \r\n  finding that Bright Ideasâ€™ â€œpresent configuration poses a substantial threat \r\n  of harm to the public at large and the children of Lexington County.â€Â  Significantly, \r\n  the court did not mention that Bright Ideas violated the terms of the partiesâ€™ \r\n  agreement, but instead, appears to have relied solely on Almeidaâ€™s actions on \r\n  January 28, 2003.Â  Because Bright Ideas terminated Almeida as the director and \r\n  complied with DSS requirements, the â€œtaintâ€ of that incident was cured and there \r\n  was no longer a nexus between the present operation and the threat of harm.\r\nOur decision should in no way be interpreted that we minimize the misconduct \r\n  on the part of Bright Ideas.Â  To be sure, we find deeply disturbing the carelessness \r\n  and disregard for safety on the part of the Bright Ideasâ€™ staff that contributed \r\n  to the injury of a child entrusted to their care.Â  We note, however, that DSS \r\n  did not immediately pursue an injunction based on this egregious incident. \r\n  [4] Â  If the paramount concern was the threat of harm to the children attending \r\n  Bright Ideas at the time of the incident, DSS could have sought the injunction \r\n  to cease any further operation. Instead, DSS held in abeyance its action for \r\n  an injunction and permitted Bright Ideas to continue operating, with some of \r\n  the original staff, based upon the agreement guidelines.Â  Relying on the assurances \r\n  of this agreement, Bright Ideas complied with its terms and took substantial \r\n  corrective action.Â  Although Bright Ideas refused to sign the corrective action \r\n  plan, signing the plan was not a requirement of the original agreement.\r\nIn light of the procedural posture of the injunction \r\n  at issue, our inquiry must be confined to the question of the adequacy of the \r\n  findings underlying the permanent injunction with respect to the â€œpresent configurationâ€ \r\n  of Bright Ideas, not the â€œformer configurationâ€ at the time of the incident.Â  \r\n  On that narrow question alone, the lack of any evidence that Bright Ideas failed \r\n  to comply with the DSS-imposed and court-approved safety plan compels us to \r\n  find the injunction was improvidently granted.Â  \r\nFor these reasons, the family courtâ€™s order permanently enjoining Bright Ideas \r\n  from operation as a daycare center is\r\nVACATED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Two of the caregivers who left their rooms unattended were released \r\n    from their jobs.Â  A third caregiver was placed on administrative leave pending \r\n    resolution of her employment status by DSS. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]Â  The child received at least thirteen bites \r\n    to the head and face. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  Bright Ideas has been closed since April \r\n    11, 2003.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] Â  If DSS had immediately moved \r\n    after the incident to enjoin the operation of Bright Ideas, we would be presented \r\n    with an entirely different case.Â  This incident alone would have been sufficient \r\n    to enjoin the operation of the daycare center.Â  Bright Ideas would have then \r\n    been required to establish a change of circumstances sufficient for the family \r\n    court to vacate or modify the injunction.Â  See Brady v. Anders, \r\n    294 S.C. 342, 343, 364 S.E.2d 467, 468 (1988) (â€œA continuing injunction is \r\n    subject to modification upon a showing of significantly changed factual circumstances \r\n    . . . . When evidence of a change in facts or the law is presented, the court \r\n    which rendered the permanent injunction has the inherent power or authority \r\n    to vacate or modify the injunction.â€) (citations omitted).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
