We affirm.1\r\n\r\n1. Gethers argues the trial court erred by permitting the State to impeach him\r\nusing a document never entered into evidence. We find the State's use of the\r\ndocument during cross-examination was not improper. See State v. Robinson, 305\r\nS.C. 469, 474, 409 S.E.2d 404, 408 (1991) (\"[Because] appellant opened the door\r\nto this evidence, he cannot complain of prejudice from its admission.\"). Gethers\r\nnext argues the State's reference to the document during closing arguments was\r\nimproper. We find this issue unpreserved for appellate review. See State v.\r\nWilson, 389 S.C. 579, 583, 698 S.E.2d 862, 864 (Ct. App. 2010) (\"When an\r\nobjecting party is sustained, the trial court has rendered a favorable ruling, and\r\ntherefore, it becomes necessary that the sustained party move to cure, or move for\r\na mistrial if such a cure is insufficient, in order to create an appealable issue.\").\r\nFinally, Gethers argues the jury's request for the document during deliberations\r\nwas improper. We find this issue is also unpreserved. See State v. Dunbar, 356\r\nS.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003) (\"In order for an issue to be preserved\r\nfor appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n[court].\").\r\n\r\n2. Gethers argues the trial court erred by limiting his cross-examination of the\r\nState's witness to show bias. We disagree. See State v. Jenkins, 322 S.C. 360, 364,\r\n474 S.E.2d 812, 814 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"The Confrontation Clause does not prevent\r\na trial [court] from imposing any limits on defense counsel's inquiry into the\r\npotential bias of a prosecution witness. On the contrary, trial [courts] may impose\r\nreasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other\r\nthings, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, witness's safety, or\r\ninterrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\"); State v. McFarlane,\r\n279 S.C. 327, 330-31, 306 S.E.2d 611, 613 (1983) (noting although a contemplated\r\nlawsuit may be relevant to show a witness's bias, the record must reflect whether or\r\nnot litigation was contemplated).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-411","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Senior Assistant\r\n            Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant\r\n            Attorney General Brendan Jackson McDonald, all of\r\n            Columbia, and Solicitor Scarlett Anne Wilson, of\r\n            Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: After the jury was unable to reach a verdict in his first trial, Oran\r\nSmith was convicted of murder in his second trial and sentenced to thirty years'\r\n\nimprisonment. On appeal, Smith argues the judge presiding over his second trial\r\nerred in denying his request for a Jackson v. Denno1 hearing on the voluntariness\r\nof his statement, relying instead on the Jackson v. Denno hearing held in the first\r\ntrial. We affirm.\r\n\r\nIn June 2009, Smith first stood trial for the June 2007 murder of Cheryl Snow\r\nbefore Judge Harrington. After the jury was selected in that trial, but prior to the\r\njury being sworn, the trial court held a Jackson v. Denno hearing, at which time\r\nSmith sought to exclude one of his statements to police wherein he admitted he\r\nstrangled Snow. In considering the totality of the circumstances, the trial court\r\nfound Smith freely and voluntarily gave his statement to police, and this statement\r\nwas thereafter admitted into evidence over Smith's objection. The jury was unable\r\nto reach a verdict in Smith's first trial, resulting in a mistrial. In December 2009,\r\nSmith was retried for Snow's murder with the same two attorneys representing\r\nSmith and the same two solicitors presenting the State's case. However, Judge\r\nDennis presided over the retrial. After the jury was chosen, but again prior to\r\nbeing sworn, trial counsel sought a Jackson v. Denno hearing. Finding Judge\r\nHarrington had already ruled on the admissibility of the statement in a Jackson v.\r\nDenno hearing prior to the first trial, Judge Dennis declined to hold another\r\nhearing on the matter.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Smith contends Judge Dennis erred in denying his request for a second\r\nJackson v. Denno hearing at his December 7, 2009 trial, after his first trial ended in\r\na mistrial. We find no reversible error.\r\n\r\nA defendant in a criminal case is entitled to a reliable determination as to the\r\nvoluntariness of his statement in an independent evidentiary hearing, by a tribunal\r\nother than the jury charged with deciding his guilt or innocence, prior to the\r\nsubmission of such statement to the jury. State v. Parker, 381 S.C. 68, 84, 671\r\nS.E.2d 619, 627 (Ct. App. 2008); State v. Creech, 314 S.C. 76, 84, 441 S.E.2d 635,\r\n639 (Ct. App. 1994). This evidentiary hearing must be conducted outside the\r\npresence of the jury, where the State must show the statement was voluntarily\r\nmade by a preponderance of the evidence. State v. Simmons, 384 S.C. 145, 162,\r\n682 S.E.2d 19, 28 (Ct. App. 2009). Upon examining the totality of circumstances\r\nsurrounding the statement, the circuit court must determine whether the State has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n\ncarried its burden of proving the statement was given voluntarily. Id. Here, a\r\nlengthy, independent evidentiary hearing was conducted by Judge Harrington, a\r\ntribunal other than the jury charged with deciding Smith's guilt or innocence, and it\r\nwas conducted outside the presence of the jury. After considering the totality of\r\nthe circumstances, Judge Harrington determined the statement in question was\r\nfreely and voluntarily given by Smith. Further, the law is clear that the proper\r\nremedy for the denial of a Jackson v. Denno hearing on the voluntariness of a\r\nstatement is not a new trial, but is a remand for a Jackson v. Denno hearing on the\r\nvoluntariness of the statement. See State v. Primus, 312 S.C. 256, 258, 440 S.E.2d\r\n128, 129 (1994) (remanding the matter to the circuit court for a Jackson v. Denno\r\nhearing since determination of whether appellant was \"in custody\" presents a\r\nfactual issue); Creech, 314 S.C. at 86-87, 441 S.E.2d at 640-41 (holding, when the\r\ntrial court failed to hold a Jackson v. Denno hearing to determine the voluntariness\r\nof a statement, neither the Constitution nor the Jackson v. Denno decision\r\nmandated a new trial, if, in a soundly conducted collateral proceeding, the\r\nappellant's confession was determined to be voluntary; the appropriate remedy was\r\nnot a new trial, but to remand the matter for a suppression hearing); State v.\r\nFortner, 266 S.C. 223, 227, 222 S.E.2d 508, 510 (1976) (holding, where the judge\r\ndeclined to hear any evidence on behalf of appellant concerning circumstances\r\nsurrounding his confession, appellant was denied a reliable determination of the\r\nvoluntariness of his confession and was entitled to a new hearing on the issue of\r\nvoluntariness, and therefore remanding the case \"to the Court of General Sessions\r\n[for that county] to hold a hearing before any judge having jurisdiction in that\r\ncircuit for a determination of the voluntariness of appellant's confession\")\r\n(emphasis added); see also State v. Miller, 367 S.C. 329, 337-38, 626 S.E.2d 328,\r\n332 (2006) (holding, where the trial court improperly denied Miller an in camera\r\nidentification hearing, this court properly determined Miller was not entitled to a\r\nnew trial, but was entitled to a remand for the purpose of conducting an in camera\r\nhearing on the identification). Here, Smith has already received a proper hearing\r\non the matter, and there is no assertion by him that any new circumstances\r\nwarranted a new hearing or that he would have presented any different evidence in\r\na new hearing. Because he would only be entitled to a remand for a Jackson v.\r\nDenno hearing, to be heard by any judge having jurisdiction in that circuit, and he\r\nhas already received the same, we find no prejudicial error.

Black, 400\r\nS.C. 10, 16-17, 732 S.E.2d 880, 884 (2012) (\"To warrant reversal, an error must\r\nresult in prejudice to the appealing party.\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-429","title":"State v.

Heyward Clarkson, III, and John D. Harjehausen, both\r\n             of Clarkson Walsh Terrell & Coulter, PA, of Greenville,\r\n             for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this civil action, Appellant Sherrie McBride argues the trial\r\ncourt erred in: (1) allowing Respondent School District of Greenville County\r\n(District) to amend its answer to assert qualified privilege and immunity as\r\naffirmative defenses prior to the 2011 trial; (2) granting the District's motion for a\r\n\ndirected verdict as to McBride's abuse of process cause of action; (3) granting the\r\nDistrict's motion for a directed verdict as to McBride's defamation cause of action;\r\n(4) denying her due process by excluding relevant evidence and preventing her\r\nfrom fully presenting evidence; and (5) adopting the prior trial testimony of Nancy\r\nMann as reconstruction of her testimony in this trial. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     We hold the trial court did not err in allowing the District to amend its\r\nanswer. A trial court is to freely grant leave to amend when justice requires and\r\nthere is no prejudice to the other party. Rule 15, SCRCP. A motion to amend is\r\naddressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the party opposing the\r\nmotion has the burden of establishing prejudice. Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C.\r\n303, 313, 566 S.E.2d 529, 535 (2002). The prejudice that would warrant denial of\r\na motion to amend the pleadings is a lack of notice that a new issue is to be tried\r\nand a lack of opportunity to refute it. Collins Entm't, Inc. v. White, 363 S.C. 546,\r\n562, 611 S.E.2d 262, 270 (Ct. App. 2005). McBride claims she suffered prejudice\r\ndue to the close proximity of the amendment of the answer and the trial date;\r\nhowever, the District served McBride with notice of the amendment more than two\r\nmonths before trial. Furthermore, immediately after the trial court allowed the\r\nDistrict to amend its answer, McBride insisted on going forward with the trial the\r\nnext week even though the trial court offered to delay the trial to a date months\r\nlater. A party cannot complain of error her own conduct has induced. Erickson v.\r\nJones St. Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 476, 629 S.E.2d 653, 670 (2006).\r\n\r\n2.     We hold the trial court did not err in directing a verdict for the District on\r\nthe abuse of process cause of action. In reviewing a grant of a directed verdict, this\r\ncourt adopts the same standard as the trial court. Burnett v. Family Kingdom, Inc.,\r\n387 S.C. 183, 188, 691 S.E.2d 170, 173 (Ct. App. 2010). When this court reviews\r\na grant of a directed verdict, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom\r\nmust be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-prevailing party. Davis v.\r\nTripp, 338 S.C. 226, 238, 525 S.E.2d 528, 534 (Ct. App. 1999). A directed verdict\r\nshould not be granted unless only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the\r\nevidence. Garrett v. Locke, 309 S.C. 94, 98, 419 S.E.2d 842, 845 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\n\"If the evidence is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, the case\r\nshould be submitted to the jury.\" Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 594,\r\n503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998). \"The tort of abuse of process consists of two\r\nelements: an ulterior purpose, and a willful act in the use of the process that is not\r\nproper in the regular conduct of the proceeding.\" Swicegood v. Lott, 379 S.C. 346,\r\n351-52, 665 S.E.2d 211, 213 (Ct. App. 2008). This court held the evidence\r\npresented in the 2007 trial gave rise to a jury question on the abuse of process\r\ncause of action. McBride v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville Cnty., 389 S.C. 546, 565, 698\r\n\nS.E.2d 845, 855 (Ct. App. 2010). We recognize discrepancies in the evidence\r\npresented in the 2007 trial and the 2011 trial. During the 2007 trial, student John\r\nDoe testified that school resource officer Daniel Oslager pressured Doe into\r\nimplicating McBride in illegal activity. This testimony, combined with testimony\r\nregarding phone calls between Oslager and Berea High School Principal William\r\nRoach, merited the abuse of process claim going to the jury. McBride, 389 S.C. at\r\n565, 698 S.E.2d at 855. Unlike the 2007 trial, the 2011 trial did not feature any\r\nevidence regarding Oslager pressuring Doe into implicating McBride in illegal\r\nactivity. There was no other evidence in the 2011 trial giving rise to a jury issue\r\non this cause of action. Therefore, we agree with the trial court that the District\r\nwas entitled to a directed verdict on McBride's claim for abuse of process.\r\n\r\n3.     We hold the trial court did not err in directing a verdict for the District on\r\nthe defamation claim. To prove defamation, a plaintiff must show: \"(1) a false and\r\ndefamatory statement was made; (2) the unprivileged publication of the statement\r\nto a third party; (3) the publisher was at fault; and (4) either the statement was\r\nactionable irrespective of harm or the publication of the statement caused special\r\nharm.\" Williams v. Lancaster Cnty. Sch. Dist., 369 S.C. 293, 302-03, 631 S.E.2d\r\n286, 292 (Ct. App. 2006). \"The publication of a statement is defamatory if it tends\r\nto harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the\r\ncommunity or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.\"\r\nFleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 494, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). In a defamation\r\naction, the defendant may assert the affirmative defense of qualified privilege.\r\nMurray v. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 139, 542 S.E.2d 743, 748 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\"Where the occasion gives rise to a qualified privilege, there is a prima facie\r\npresumption to rebut the inference of malice, and the burden is on the plaintiff to\r\nshow actual malice or that the scope of the privilege has been exceeded.\" Swinton\r\nCreek Nursery v. Edisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 485, 514 S.E.2d 126,\r\n134 (1999). \"Communications between officers and employees of a corporation\r\nare qualifiedly privileged if made in good faith and in the usual course of\r\nbusiness.\" Murray, 344 S.C. at 141, 542 S.E.2d at 749. Roach's statement to\r\nCochran that McBride \"cleaned us out\" was qualifiedly privileged. Roach was an\r\nemployee of the District and made the alleged statement to another District\r\nemployee, Cochran. Roach's job as school principal included the management of\r\nteachers and school facilities. An inquiry into the location of school property fell\r\nunder Roach's usual course of business, as did an inquiry into whether McBride\r\nhad taken school property. A statement made in connection with an employer's\r\nbona fide inquiry into possible employee misconduct is qualifiedly privileged.\r\nWright v. Sparrow, 298 S.C. 469, 474, 381 S.E. 2d 503, 507 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\n\n4.     We hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence and\r\npreventing McBride from fully presenting evidence. A trial court has broad\r\ndiscretion in its supervision over the progression and disposition of a case in the\r\ninterests of justice and judicial economy. Capital City Ins. Co. v. B.P. Staff, Inc.,\r\n382 S.C. 92, 103, 674 S.E.2d 524, 530 (Ct. App. 2009). \"To warrant reversal\r\nbased on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the complaining party must prove\r\nboth the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice.\" State v. Douglas, 367 S.C.\r\n498, 508, 626 S.E.2d 59, 64 (Ct. App. 2006). McBride alleges the trial court erred\r\nin excluding Cochran's testimony on complaints at the school; however, Cochran\r\nwas permitted to testify about these matters. Additionally, the trial court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in limiting the scope of McBride's redirect examination of\r\nOslager. See State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508, 513, 316 S.E.2d 395, 399 (1984)\r\n(\"The scope of redirect rests in the discretion of the trial court.\"). Furthermore,\r\nMcBride failed to make a proffer of any excluded evidence, and this court cannot\r\nconsider the alleged errors. See State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 46, 599 S.E.2d 448,\r\n454 (2004) (holding the failure to make a proffer of excluded evidence will\r\npreclude review on appeal).\r\n\r\n5.     We hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in adopting Nancy Mann's\r\n2007 testimony as an accurate reconstruction of her 2011 testimony. The trial\r\ncourt has discretion in determining how to reconstruct missing portions of a\r\ntranscript; however, this discretion must lie within the limits required by\r\nprocedural due process. Adams v. H.R. Allen, Inc., 397 S.C. 652, 658, 726 S.E.2d\r\n9, 13 (Ct. App. 2012). \"Procedural due process requirements are not technical; no\r\nparticular form of procedure is necessary. The United States Supreme Court has\r\nheld, however, that at a minimum certain elements must be present. These include\r\n(1) adequate notice; (2) adequate opportunity for a hearing; (3) the right to\r\nintroduce evidence; and (4) the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.\" In\r\nre Dickey, 395 S.C. 336, 360, 718 S.E.2d 739, 751 (2011) (quoting In re Vora, 354\r\nS.C. 590, 595, 582 S.E.2d 413, 416 (2003)). Here the limits required by\r\nprocedural due process were met. A hearing was held on the matter of Mann's\r\nmissing 2011 testimony and both parties provided witnesses who testified on the\r\ncontent of that testimony. Each side had the opportunity to cross-examine all of\r\nthe witnesses and the witnesses presented conflicting accounts of Mann's\r\ntestimony. The trial judge noted that, while he could not exactly recall the\r\ntestimony, he believed the proposed testimony offered by McBride was not\r\naccurate. The trial court deemed Mann's 2007 testimony as the best evidence of\r\nMann's 2011 testimony; consequently, the court adopted Mann's 2007 testimony as\r\nan accurate reconstruction of the missing portion of the record.\r\n\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-440","title":"SCDSS v.

Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia;\r\n        and Solicitor Scarlett Anne Wilson, of Charleston, for\r\n        Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Appellant Christopher Spriggs seeks review of his conviction for\r\nvoluntary manslaughter, arguing the trial court erred in: (1) charging the jury on\r\nvoluntary manslaughter during his murder trial when the trial court had previously\r\nindicated that it would to defer to Appellant's wishes concerning a jury charge on a\r\nlesser-included offense; (2) charging the jury that malice may be inferred from the\r\nuse of a deadly weapon; and (3) denying his motion to submit an affidavit of the\r\njury foreman. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nAppellant lived with his mother, Shelly Greene, and her boyfriend, David\r\nDeschene, in Monck's Corner, South Carolina. In the early morning of December\r\n8, 2007, Appellant was at home hanging out with four teenage friends: Charles\r\nWeaver, Steven Turnage, Jessica Gyulai, and Tyler Kent. While together, the\r\nfriends engaged in drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana, and taking ecstasy pills.\r\nDeschene was also in the home, but he was watching television in his bedroom.\r\nAround 2:00 a.m., Deschene received a phone call from Greene, who reported that\r\nshe had been beaten and tortured by Kindu Molique Bost (Victim). Deschene then\r\npassed the phone to Appellant. Greene relayed to Appellant that she was at the\r\nInTown Suites in North Charleston, South Carolina and asked that Appellant and\r\nDeschene come and assist her in collecting her belongings.\r\n\r\nAppellant was visibly upset after speaking with Greene. Before leaving to assist\r\nGreene, Appellant took a knife from the kitchen and placed it the glove box of\r\nTurnage's Mitsubishi. Appellant and his four friends then left in the Mitsubishi.\r\nDeschene drove separately in his own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAfter about a forty-five minute drive, the group arrived at the hotel. There, the\r\ngroup observed Greene had blood dripping from one ear, several marks around her\r\nneck, and blood in her eyes. After assisting Greene in retrieving her luggage, all of\r\nthe group, except for Greene, got into their respective vehicles and prepared to\r\nleave. As Greene stood outside the hotel room door, carrying some final items,\r\nVictim arrived at the parking lot in a taxi. Victim immediately exited the taxi and\r\nran between the two parked cars towards where Greene was standing. Appellant\r\nexited the Mitsubishi and intercepted Victim. Subsequently, Turnage and Kent\r\nexited the vehicle to assist Appellant. The three teenagers then engaged in a fist-\r\nfight with Victim. Within a few minutes, the three teenagers were able to subdue\r\nVictim.\r\n\nAs Victim laid on the ground of the parking lot, the group attempted to leave.\r\nBefore the group could get away, Victim got up from the ground and charged\r\ntoward the passenger-side door of Deschene's vehicle before Greene could pull it\r\nclosed. As Victim threw punches through the passenger-side door, Kent exited the\r\nMitsubishi and attempted to pull Victim from the car. Victim refused to relent,\r\neven after Kent pulled several dreadlocks from Victim's head. Simultaneously,\r\nAppellant took the knife from the glove box and approached Deshene's vehicle.\r\nAppellant then swung the knife, stabbing Victim twice in the back. In the process,\r\nAppellant accidentally stabbed Kent in the arm. Subsequently, Appellant and Kent\r\nran back to the Mitsubishi.\r\n\r\nDespite his wounds, Victim continued to try and get inside Deschene's vehicle.\r\nGreene and Deschene eventually succeeded in pushing Victim out of the vehicle,\r\nand both vehicles drove away from the hotel. Victim died from his stab wounds\r\napproximately one hour later.\r\n\r\nOn May 5, 2008, Appellant was indicted for murder. At trial, the trial court\r\ninstructed the jury as to the elements of murder, that malice may be inferred from\r\nthe use of a deadly weapon, voluntary manslaughter, and defense of others. The\r\njury found Appellant guilty of the lesser-included offense of voluntary\r\nmanslaughter. The trial court sentenced Appellant to fifteen years' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.   Voluntary Manslaughter Charge\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Appellant does not challenge whether there was sufficient evidence in\r\nthe record to support the charge of voluntary manslaughter. Rather, Appellant\r\nargues the trial court erred in charging the jury on voluntary manslaughter when it\r\nhad previously \"promised\" that it would defer to Appellant's wishes \"to go all or\r\nnothing\" concerning a charge on a lesser-included offense. He further argues the\r\ntrial court's subsequent change in position rendered his trial fundamentally unfair.\r\nWe find no merit to this argument.\r\n\r\nAppellant cites to State v. Jones, 343 S.C. 562, 541 S.E.2d 813 (2001), in support\r\nof his argument. In Jones, the court held that it was error for the trial court to alter\r\na reasonable doubt instruction after defense counsel's closing argument. Id. at 578,\r\n541 S.E.2d at 821-22. The Jones court noted that such alteration was\r\nfundamentally unfair because defense counsel had reasonably relied upon the trial\r\n\ncourt's initial instruction by specifically incorporating the instruction's language\r\ninto his closing argument. Id. Thus, Jones requires a defendant to reasonably rely\r\non the trial court's ruling to his or her detriment in order for a subsequent change to\r\nthe ruling to impact the fundamental fairness of the defendant's trial.\r\n\r\nThe present case differs significantly from Jones. The trial court in the present\r\ncase indicated that it would defer to Appellant's wishes as to the lesser-included\r\noffense during a pre-trial colloquy with defense counsel. While discussing the\r\nissue with defense counsel, the trial court indicated that it had no means of\r\ndetermining what would be charged until after it heard all of the evidence. The\r\ntrial court further stated that it would charge the applicable law as supported by the\r\nfacts of the case. Thus, the trial court essentially acknowledged that it was\r\nrequired to determine the law to be charged based on the evidence presented at\r\ntrial. See State v. Hernandez, 386 S.C. 655, 660, 690 S.E.2d 582, 585 (Ct. App.\r\n2010).\r\n\r\nGiven the full discussion between the trial court and defense counsel as well as the\r\npre-trial timing of the trial court's comment, we find the trial court's statement was\r\nakin to a preliminary ruling. The trial court merely indicated its initial inclination\r\nto charge what the defendant requested. As a general rule, \"[t]rial judges must not\r\nbe held, conclusively, to preliminary rulings made without benefit of all the\r\npertinent and relevant evidence.\" State v. Floyd, 295 S.C. 518, 521, 369 S.E.2d\r\n842, 843 (1988). See Hernandez, 386 S.C. at 660, 690 S.E.2d at 585. Further, the\r\ntrial court must determine the law to be charged based on the evidence presented at\r\ntrial. Accordingly, we find Appellant did not have a right to rely on the trial court's\r\n\"promise.\"\r\n\r\nII. Permissive Inference Instruction on Malice\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could infer\r\nmalice from the use of a deadly weapon and this error was not harmless beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSix months after Appellant's trial concluded, our supreme court in State v. Belcher,\r\n385 S.C. 597, 600, 685 S.E.2d 802, 803-04 (2009), held that a jury charge\r\ninstructing that malice may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon \"is no\r\nlonger good law in South Carolina where evidence is presented that would reduce,\r\nmitigate, excuse or justify the homicide.\" The court, however, reiterated the long-\r\n\nstanding rule, \"[e]rrors, including erroneous jury instructions, are subject to\r\nharmless error analysis.\" Id. at 611, 685 S.E.2d at 809.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Appellant cites to Caldwell v. Bell, 288 F.3d 838 (6th Cir. 2002), as an\r\nexample that a permissive inference instruction on malice cannot be deemed\r\nharmless when there is evidence of provocation, justification, or excuse. However,\r\nAppellant's reliance on Caldwell is misplaced. In Caldwell, the district court did\r\nnot instruct the jury that it could infer malice from the use of a deadly weapon.\r\nRather, the district court instructed the jury to presume malice from the use of a\r\ndeadly weapon. 288 F.3d at 840. Thus, Caldwell is distinguishable in that it\r\npresented the concern that the jury instruction had a substantial effect on the\r\nverdict because it prevented the jury from considering alternative theories\r\npresented by the defense, such as accident or provocation, when the defendant was\r\nfound to have used a deadly weapon.\r\n\r\nHere, the jury found that Appellant acted without malice by convicting Appellant\r\nof voluntary manslaughter. See State v. Pilgrim, 320 S.C. 409, 414, 465 S.E.2d\r\n108, 111 (Ct. App. 1995), overruled on other grounds, State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12,\r\n479 S.E.2d 50 (1996) (\"The distinction between murder and manslaughter is the\r\npresence of malice in murder and the absence of malice in manslaughter.\"). The\r\njury's ultimate verdict demonstrates that the trial court's instruction did not\r\npreclude the jury from seriously considering the evidence of justification and\r\nexcuse presented at trial. Accordingly, we find the trial court's instruction that the\r\njury could infer malice from Appellant's use of a deadly weapon was harmless\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nIII. Admissibility of Juror Affidavit\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to submit an affidavit\r\nof the jury foreman in order to rebut a factual assertion in the trial court's order\r\ndenying Appellant's motion for a new trial. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe general policy in South Carolina is \"courts should not intrude into the privacy\r\nof the jury room to scrutinize how jurors reached their verdict.\" State v. Hunter,\r\n320 S.C. 85, 88, 463 S.E.2d 314, 316 (1995). Consistent with this policy, Rule\r\n606(b), SCRE, prohibits the introduction of a juror's affidavit concerning the\r\nstatements, thought processes, and conduct of jurors during deliberations.\r\nHowever, an exception to this categorical prohibition on the introduction of a\r\njuror's affidavit regarding deliberations has been recognized where a juror's\r\n\naffidavit suggests the conduct of the jury rendered the trial fundamentally unfair.\r\nSee Shumpert v. State, 378 S.C. 62, 68-69, 661 S.E.2d 369, 372 (2008); Hunter,\r\n320 S.C. at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316.\r\n\r\nIn the affidavit at issue, the jury foreman explains his personal considerations for\r\nvoting against the murder conviction and lists the results of a preliminary poll at\r\nthe beginning of deliberations. The affidavit contains no allegations that the jury's\r\nverdict was tainted by any juror misconduct. Because the affidavit in no way\r\nsuggests that the actions of the jury rendered the trial unfair, we find the affidavit\r\ndoes not rise to the high level of seriousness required for the admission of a juror's\r\naffidavit concerning deliberations. Accordingly, we find the trial judge properly\r\ndenied Appellant's motion to submit the jury foreman's affidavit.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-436","title":"State v.
