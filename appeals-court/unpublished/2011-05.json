Stoney, Jr., of Charleston, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this wrongful death action, Jean Holst, individually, and as the personal representative of the estate of\r\n  William Edward Holst, Jr., appeals a jury\r\n  verdict in favor of the South Carolina State Port Authority (SCSPA).Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe background facts of this\r\n  case are set out in this court's opinion in Holst v. KCI Konecranes Int'l\r\n    Corp., 390 S.C. 29, 699 S.E.2d 715 (Ct. App. 2010).\r\n\r\n  William\r\n    Holst (Decedent) was a checker at the Wando Welch Terminal of the South\r\n    Carolina State Ports Authority (SCSPA) in Charleston. As a checker, Decedent\r\n    was responsible for identifying the containers needed for transport between the\r\n    container yard and the ships. Â After identifying the correct containers for\r\n    transport, Decedent would instruct the crane operators to move and load the\r\n    containers in the proper sequence. Â On July 5, 2004, Decedent was working with\r\n    Chad Swan, an employee of the SCSPA, who operated a KCI rubber-tired gantry\r\n    crane (the crane). Swan was transferring containers from a container pad onto\r\n    trucks for transport.Â  [A container pad contains a truck lane and six stacks of\r\n    containers, each with the potential of having four containers stacked on top of\r\n    each other.]\r\n  Decedent\r\n    instructed Swan to move all of the containers in stacks two, three, and four of\r\n    the pad. Â After Swan moved all of the containers out of stack two, he picked up\r\n    the four containers from stack one and lowered them into stack two.Â  Decedent\r\n    was standing in stack two and was crushed to death by the containers.\r\n  Swan\r\n    testified he was unaware Decedent was in the second stack when he grounded the\r\n    containers from stack one. He further testified he did not have visibility of\r\n    the ground in stack two from the operator's cab of the crane. Â Swan stated that\r\n    while Decedent did not instruct him to move the containers from stack one into\r\n    stack two, it was protocol and a safety procedure to move the four containers\r\n    out of stack one.\r\n\r\nId. at 33-34, 699 S.E.2d at 718.\r\nHolst brought this wrongful\r\n  death and negligence action against SCSPA.Â  SCSPA denied any negligence on its\r\n  part and asserted that even if it was negligent, Decedent's negligence was\r\n  greater than its own.Â  The case was tried before a jury to which the trial\r\n  court submitted a special verdict form.Â  The jury found Holst did not prove &quot;by\r\n  the greater weight of the evidence that the defendant, though its agent,\r\n  servant, or employee was negligent, and that such negligence was a proximate\r\n  cause of some loss or damage proven to have been sustained by the plaintiff\r\n  and/or plaintiff's decedent.&quot;Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHolst argues the trial court\r\n  erred in charging the jury on certain Occupational Safety and Health\r\n  Administration (OSHA) regulations.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;An appellate court will\r\n  not reverse the trial court's decision regarding jury instructions unless the\r\n  trial court committed an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Cole v. Raut, 378\r\n  S.C. 398, 404, 663 S.E.2d 30, 33 (2008). &quot;An abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  when the trial court's ruling is based on an error of law or is not supported\r\n  by the evidence.&quot; Id.Â  \r\n&quot;A trial court must\r\n  charge the current and correct law.&quot; Â Wells v. Halyard, 341 S.C.\r\n  234, 237, 533 S.E.2d 341, 343 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  A trial court generally has a\r\n  duty to give a requested instruction that correctly states the law applicable\r\n  to the issues and evidence.Â  Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. 547, 555, 481\r\n  S.E.2d 444, 448 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  However, the court should confine the jury\r\n  instructions to the issues made by the pleadings and supported by the evidence.\r\n  Â Fairchild v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 385 S.C. 344, 350-51, 683 S.E.2d\r\n  818, 822 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nIn reviewing jury charges for\r\n  an alleged error, the appellate court &quot;must consider the court's jury\r\n  charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial. Â If,\r\n  as a whole, the charges are reasonably free from error, isolated portions which\r\n  might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.&quot;Â  Keaton ex\r\n    rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570,\r\n  575 (1999).Â  &quot;An alleged error is harmless if the appellate court\r\n  determines beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged error did not contribute\r\n  to the verdict.&quot;Â  Wells, 341 S.C. at 237, 533 S.E.2d at 343.\r\nThe trial court charged the\r\n  jury:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    addition, there are particular OSHA regulations, that is the Department of\r\n    Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Regulation [29 C.F.R. Â§ 1917.71\r\n    (d)(2) (2010)] that specifically relate to marine terminal operations.\r\n  It\r\n    requires that the employer shall direct employees to stay clear of the area\r\n    beneath a suspended container.Â  . . .Â  [A]nother OSHA regulation [29 C.F.R. Â§\r\n    1917.13(h) (2010)] also relates to, specifically to, marine terminal\r\n    operations, and that regulation requires that the employer shall require\r\n    employees to stay clear of the area beneath overhead drafts or descending\r\n    lifting gear.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  court also charged the jury at Holst's request:\r\n\r\n  And a\r\n    regulation [29 C.F.R. 1910.179(n)(3)(vi) (2010)] provides that the employer\r\n    shall require that the operator, being the operator of a crane, avoid carrying\r\n    loads over people.Â  And where it is shown that the employee has violated the\r\n    requirements of a rule or regulation, that violation may constitute negligence\r\n    on the part of that employee.\r\n\r\nHolst does not challenge the\r\n  wording of the charge.Â  Instead, she asserts the trial court should not have\r\n  charged the OSHA regulations requested by SCSPA to the jury.Â  Holst argues the\r\n  charge was inappropriate because SCSPA could not shift liability to Decedent's\r\n  employer.Â  SCSPA contends it was not attempting to shift liability to Decedent's\r\n  employer.Â  Instead, at trial it claimed Decedent was aware he should stay clear\r\n  of the area beneath a suspended container.Â  In its answer, SCSPA asserted\r\n  Decedent's negligence exceeded its own negligence because, among other reasons &quot;On\r\n  information and belief [Decedent] failed to observe his employer's safety rules\r\n  and procedures for stevedoring operation in which he was engaged at the time of\r\n  his injuries.&quot;Â  SCSPA never attempted to demonstrate Decedent's employer\r\n  failed to comply with the OSHA regulations.Â  It did not seek indemnity or\r\n  contribution from the employer.Â  Instead, SCSPA elicited testimony showing the\r\n  checkers were aware of the safety regulations and provided other testimony\r\n  concerning the regulations.Â  \r\nStephen E. Connor read the\r\n  OSHA regulations to the jury.Â  John Michael Alvanos, a friend of Decedent who\r\n  also worked as a checker, testified the checkers had a safety meeting before\r\n  every shift and safety was on the agenda of every monthly meeting.Â  He stated\r\n  the checkers and clerks were trained and certified under OSHA.Â  In addition, he\r\n  claimed: &quot;[Decedent] knew all the do's and don'ts.Â  I can, I can verify\r\n  for him one hundred percent he knew all the do's and don'ts on that terminal.&quot; \r\nJohn Cleary, a clerk-checker\r\n  like Decedent, testified that while checkers must be careful and aware of where\r\n  the crane is, they must also go into the stacks to do their job.Â  However,\r\n  Cleary also stated that checkers should not go under the load of the crane\r\n  while it is moving and experienced checkers know this.Â  \r\nBill Harwell, Holst's expert\r\n  witness, testified he was aware that according to OSHA regulations no one\r\n  should ever go under a suspended load.Â  He also stated someone of the Decedent's\r\n  experience would know that.Â  \r\nBecause the jury heard\r\n  testimony that included the regulations themselves as well as evidence that\r\n  checkers such as the Decedent were aware of the regulations, we find no\r\n  prejudice from the trial court's charge.Â  \r\nCiting Fernanders v. Marks\r\n  Construction. of South Carolina., Inc., 330 S.C. 470, 475, 499 S.E.2d 509,\r\n  511 (Ct. App. 1998), Holst argues: &quot;The prejudice in instructions of\r\n  irrelevant and inapplicable principles of law is manifest.&quot;Â  This court in Fernanders was discussing the effect of charging the jury on the concept\r\n  of joint and several liability, which it found to be comparable to charging the\r\n  jury on the existence of liability insurance.Â  Id.Â  We find Fernanders does not negate well-established law requiring both error and prejudice.Â  See Cole, 378 S.C. at 405, 663 S.E.2d at 33 (stating an erroneous jury\r\n  instruction is not grounds for reversal unless the appellant can show prejudice\r\n  from the erroneous instruction).[1]\r\nWe find no reversible error\r\n  in the trial court's charge.Â  Accordingly, the verdict in favor of SCSPA is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KONDUROS, and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Holst also argues on appeal that the charges\r\n  were improper because the OSHA regulations do not create a private right of\r\n  action.Â  In addition, in her reply brief, Holst raises for the first time the\r\n  issue that the trial court's charge of the OSHA regulations constituted\r\n  commenting on the facts of the case.Â  We find these issues are not properly\r\n  before this court. Â Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d\r\n  731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the\r\n  first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  judge to be preserved for appellate review.&quot;); State v.

(Collins)\r\n  (collectively Respondents), after they were abducted from Tidal Wave's parking\r\n  lot and assaulted by two men.Â  The City of Beaufort (the City) and Branch Banking\r\n  &amp; Trust of South Carolina (BB&amp;T) were also named as Defendants in each\r\n  action.Â  The\r\n  circuit court consolidated the two actions, and the Master-in-Equity granted\r\n  Respondents' respective summary judgment motions.Â  The Davidsons seek review of\r\n  the master's order granting summary judgment.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nIn 2005, the\r\n  City awarded a contract to Brantley for repairs and upgrades to the Henry C.\r\n  Chambers Waterfront Park in downtown Beaufort, along the Beaufort River.Â  The\r\n  City also hired Collins to oversee the daily construction activities to ensure\r\n  that Brantley performed according to contract specifications.Â  On May 26, 2006,\r\n  during\r\n  the time period in which Brantley performed construction in the Waterfront Park,\r\n  the Davidsons traveled to the City's waterfront area for the purpose of meeting with friends\r\n  at Saltus Riverfront Bar and Grill (Saltus), located at 820 Bay Street and\r\n  adjacent to the Waterfront Park.[2]Â \r\n  When they arrived at the waterfront area, they parked their car in a parking\r\n  lot adjoining the office building at 706 Bay Street, owned by Tidal Wave, which\r\n  was also adjacent to the Waterfront Park.Â  BB&amp;T operated in this building\r\n  and maintained a 24-hour ATM in the corner of the parking lot.Â  There was a\r\n  &quot;No Parking&quot; sign at the parking lot's entrance from the Carteret\r\n  Street side,[3] and the space that the Davidsons parked in was marked &quot;For BB&amp;T\r\n  Customers Only.&quot;Â  It is undisputed that the Davidsons did not use BB&amp;T's\r\n  ATM.Â  \r\nAfter the\r\n  Davidsons visited Saltus, they returned to their car at approximately 1 a.m.Â  Tragically,\r\n  two men attacked, carjacked, and robbed them and sexually assaulted Mrs.\r\n  Davidson.Â  The Davidsons later filed these negligence actions, alleging that Respondents\r\n  breached their duty to provide sufficient lighting and security for Tidal\r\n  Wave's parking lot.Â  The Davidsons maintained that this breach proximately\r\n  caused their abduction as well as resulting physical and mental injuries.Â  \r\nThe complaint\r\n  also alleged that there were multiple signs directing the public to park in\r\n  Tidal Wave's parking lot.Â  Additionally, the complaint stated that Brantley and\r\n  Collins were on notice of a prior abduction from Tidal Wave's parking lot, and,\r\n  therefore, they had a duty to provide lighting to the premises.Â  The complaint\r\n  cited numerous other crimes committed in the waterfront area in the recent past\r\n  due to the lack of lighting and other unspecified &quot;dangerous\r\n  conditions&quot; in the construction area.Â  The complaint asserted that these crimes\r\n  were &quot;publicized and generally known to the community.&quot;Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  discovery, Tidal Wave served the following Requests to Admit on the Davidsons:\r\n\r\n  1.Admit\r\n    that Plaintiffs' presence at the BB&amp;T parking lot on the date of the\r\n    incident, May 26, 2006[,] did not confer any benefit on the commercial landlord\r\n    Tidal Wave 23, LLC.\r\n  2.Admit\r\n    that Plaintiffs' presence at the BB&amp;T parking lot on the date of the\r\n    incident, May 26, 2006[,] did not confer any benefit to the commercial tenant\r\n    BB&amp;T.\r\n  3.Admit\r\n    that Plaintiffs did not use BB&amp;T's ATM at 706 Bay Street, Beaufort, SC[,]\r\n    on the date of loss of May 26, 2006.Â  \r\n  4.&nbsp; Admit\r\n    that Plaintiffs did not intend to use BB&amp;T's ATM at 706 Bay Street, Beaufort,\r\n    SC[,] on the date of loss of May 26, 2006.\r\n  5.&nbsp; Admit\r\n    that Plaintiffs are not customers of and do not conduct business with the\r\n    commercial landlord Tidal Wave 23, LLC[,] on May 26, 2006.\r\n  6. Admit\r\n    that Plaintiffs are not customers of and were not transacting business with\r\n    BB&amp;T on May 26, 2006[,] at 706 Bay Street, Beaufort, SC.\r\n  7. Admit\r\n    that the &quot;public parking&quot; signs referred to in Plaintiffs' Complaint\r\n    are the property of the City of Beaufort and were located on the City of\r\n    Beaufort's real property on the date of the incident, May 26, 2006.\r\n  8. Admit\r\n    that the &quot;public parking&quot; [signs] referred to in Plaintiffs'\r\n    Complaint were not the property of Tidal Wave 23, LLC[,] or BB&amp;T and are\r\n    not located on the real property of Tidal Wave 23, LLC[,] or BB&amp;T.\r\n  9. Admit\r\n    that the Tidal Wave 23, LLC[,] property had a &quot;no parking&quot; sign at\r\n    the entrance of Tidal Wave's parking lot upon entering the parking lot from the\r\n    Cataret [sic] Street side.\r\n  10. Admit\r\n    that the Plaintiffs parked in BB&amp;T's parking space that was marked\r\n    &quot;for BB&amp;T customers only.&quot;\r\n  11. Admit\r\n    that the BB&amp;T's parking lot space that the Plaintiffs parked in was held\r\n    open to the public for BB&amp;T customers only.\r\n  12.&nbsp; Admit\r\n    that Plaintiffs parked in the BB&amp;T parking lot in order to go have dinner\r\n    and drinks at the Saltus restaurant.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Davidsons did not submit a timely response to these Requests to Admit, and, therefore, they were deemed admitted pursuant to Rule 36(a), SCRCP.[4]Â  However,\r\n  at the summary judgment hearing, the master asked the Davidsons' counsel\r\n  &quot;[A]re ya'll going to move to work that out or strike that or are they\r\n  admitted?&quot;Â  Counsel responded:Â  \r\n\r\n  No,\r\n    there are a couple that we don't admit to, namely that I believe the one that\r\n    says the Public Parking sign is on . . . City of Beaufort property, and the\r\n    reason for that being even in the depositions of the people from the City, we\r\n    couldn't figure it out.Â  Nobody will take credit for who put the sign there or\r\n    who, you know, who it\r\n    belongs to.Â \r\n\r\nThe master\r\n  replied &quot;Gotcha.&quot;Â  There is nothing in the record indicating that\r\n  counsel ever filed a formal motion to withdraw these two admissions.[5]\r\nThe master\r\n  concluded that based on their admissions, the Davidsons could not be classified\r\n  as invitees and, therefore, there was no South Carolina precedent creating a\r\n  duty on Respondents' part to protect the Davidsons from the criminal acts of\r\n  third parties.Â  The master granted summary judgment to Respondents\r\n  and denied the Davidsons' motion for reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed. Â \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  1. Did the master\r\n    properly grant summary judgment to Tidal Wave when the\r\n    Davidsons presented no evidence that BB&amp;T or Tidal Wave invited or gave\r\n    consent for them to enter and use the parking lot in question?\r\n  2. Did the master\r\n    properly grant summary judgment to Brantley and Collins when there existed no legal\r\n    duty on their part to the Davidsons?\r\n  3. Did the master\r\n    properly grant summary judgment to Respondents despite the fact that discovery\r\n    had not yet been completed?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from\r\n  the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard as\r\n  that required for the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp.,\r\n  341 S.C. 372, 379, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000).&nbsp; Summary judgment is proper\r\n  when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is\r\n  entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Adamson v. Richland Cnty. Sch. Dist. One,\r\n  332 S.C. 121, 124, 503 S.E.2d 752, 753 (Ct. App.&nbsp;1998).&nbsp; &quot;To\r\n  determine if any genuine issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the [nonmoving] party.&quot;&nbsp; Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161,\r\n  165 (2003).Â  Further, &quot;in cases applying the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence burden of proof, the [nonmoving] party is only\r\n  required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion\r\n  for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock\r\n    v. Mid-South Mgmt., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d\r\n  801, 803&nbsp;(2009). \r\n&quot;The\r\n  purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases [that] do not\r\n  require the services of a fact finder.&quot;Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440,\r\n  452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). &quot;Summary\r\n  judgment is appropriate in those cases in which plain, palpable and\r\n  undisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ.&quot;Â  Priest\r\n    v. Brown, 302 S.C. 405, 408, 396 S.E.2d 638, 639&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1990). Â &quot;It is not sufficient that one create an inference [that] is not\r\n  reasonable or an issue of fact that is not genuine.&quot; Â Id.Â  \r\nOnce\r\n  the moving party meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary\r\n  support for the opponent's case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere\r\n  allegations or denials contained in the pleadings but must come forward with\r\n  specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Â Rule 56(e),\r\n  SCRCP; Boone v. Sunbelt Newspapers, Inc., 347 S.C. 571, 579, 556 S.E.2d 732, 736&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2001).Â \r\n  Specifically, Rule 56(e) states in pertinent part:Â  \r\n\r\n  When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as\r\n    provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations\r\n    or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise\r\n      provided in this rule,[6] must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Â If\r\n    he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered\r\n    against him.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nIf\r\n  the party opposing summary judgment asserts he or she cannot present by\r\n  affidavit facts justifying opposition, he must set forth this belief and the\r\n  reasons for this belief in an affidavit for the trial court's review.Â  Rule\r\n  56(f), SCRCP.Â  Specifically, Rule 56(f) states the following:\r\n\r\n  Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing\r\n    the motion that he cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts\r\n    essential to justify his opposition, the court may refuse the application for\r\n    judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or\r\n    depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such order as is\r\n    just.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  In other words, to obtain the benefit of Rule 56(f), a party must file\r\n  an affidavit setting forth the reasons that he is unable to &quot;present\r\n  by affidavit facts essential to justify his opposition.&quot;Â  See Doe ex rel. Doe v. Batson, 345 S.C. 316, 321, 548 S.E.2d 854,\r\n  857&nbsp;(2001)&nbsp;(&quot;Rule 56(f) requires the\r\n  party opposing summary judgment to at least present affidavits explaining why he\r\n  needs more time for discovery.&quot;).\r\n&quot;Where\r\n  the plaintiff relies solely upon the pleadings, files no counter-affidavits,\r\n  and makes no factual showing in opposition to a motion for summary judgment,\r\n  the lower court is required under Rule 56, to\r\n  grant summary judgment, if, under the facts presented by the defendant, he was\r\n  entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Humana Hospital-Bayside v.\r\n    Lightle, 305 S.C. 214, 216, 407 S.E.2d 637, 638&nbsp;(1991).Â  &quot;[T]his\r\n  court ordinarily will not consider statements of fact presented only in an\r\n  attorney's argument in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact\r\n  exists sufficient to preclude summary judgment.&quot;Â  West v. Gladney,\r\n  341 S.C. 127, 135, 533 S.E.2d 334, 338&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â  Tidal\r\n  Wave\r\nThe\r\n  Davidsons maintain that the master erred in granting summary judgment to Tidal\r\n  Wave because there existed genuine issues of material fact regarding who was\r\n  responsible for lighting the parking lot and whether the Davidsons were\r\n  invitees, licensees, or trespassers on the property.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;South\r\n  Carolina recognizes four general classifications of persons who come on\r\n  premises: adult trespassers, invitees, licensees, and\r\n  children.&quot;Â  Estate of Adair v. L-J, Inc., 372 S.C. 154, 157-58, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 63, 65&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2007) (internal citation and quotation marks\r\n  omitted).Â  The highest duty of care is that owed to an invitee, who enters the\r\n  property at the express or implied invitation of the property owner.Â  Hoover\r\n    v. Broome, 324 S.C. 531, 535, 479 S.E.2d 62, 64&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996).Â \r\n  There are two types of invitees:Â  (1) a public invitee, who is\r\n  invited to enter or remain on land as a member of the public for a purpose for\r\n  which the land is held open to the public; and (2) a business visitor, who is\r\n  invited to enter or remain on land for a purpose connected with business\r\n  dealings with the possessor of the land.Â  Id. at\r\n  536, 479 S.E.2d at 65.Â  The duty owed to invitees is to take reasonable care to\r\n  protect them from dangerous conditions.Â  Id.Â  \r\nA landowner\r\n  has a lesser duty of care to a licensee, who is privileged to enter upon land\r\n  by virtue of the possessor's consent.Â  Neil v. Byrum,\r\n  288 S.C. 472, 473, 343 S.E.2d 615, 616&nbsp;(1986).&nbsp; The\r\n  possessor is under no obligation to exercise care to make the premises safe for\r\n  the licensee's reception, and is under no duty toward him except:\r\n\r\n  (a) To use reasonable care to discover him and avoid injury to him\r\n    in carrying on activities upon the land.\r\n  (b) To use reasonable care to warn him of any concealed\r\n    dangerous conditions or activities which are known to the possessor, or of\r\n    any change in the condition of the premises which may be dangerous to him, and\r\n    which he may reasonably be expected to discover.\r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nA\r\n  landowner's lowest duty of care is toward an adult trespasser, &quot;whose\r\n  presence is neither invited nor suffered[.]&quot;Â  Estate of Adair, 372\r\n  S.C. at 158, 641 S.E.2d at 65 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).Â \r\n  A landowner owes no duty to a trespasser except the duty not to do him willful\r\n  or wanton injury.Â  Estate of Adair, 372 S.C. at 160, 641 S.E.2d at 66. \r\nHere,\r\n  the Davidsons alleged in their complaint that that there existed multiple signs\r\n  directing the public to park in the BB&amp;T parking lot.Â  They argue that by\r\n  virtue of these purported signs, they were public invitees.Â  However, they did not\r\n  submit affidavits or any other evidence at the summary judgment hearing to\r\n  support this allegation.[7] Â The depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\r\n  included in the Record on Appeal are devoid of any evidence that Tidal Wave or\r\n  BB&amp;T posted signs directing the public to park in the BB&amp;T parking lot\r\n  or that the Davidsons were otherwise invited into the parking lot.Â  Rather, the\r\n  record contains admissions by the Davidsons that the alleged signs belonged to\r\n  the City and were located on the City's property, and it is questionable\r\n  whether the master allowed the Davidsons to withdraw these admissions.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  the Davidsons presented no evidence that BB&amp;T or Tidal Wave gave consent\r\n  for them to enter and use the parking lot in question.Â  Hence, there was no\r\n  evidence that the Davidsons enjoyed the status of licensees.Â  See Estate\r\n    of Adair, 372 S.C. at 158, 641 S.E.2d at 65 (stating that a licensee is a\r\n  person not invited but whose presence is suffered).Â  In\r\n  fact, the Davidsons admitted that there was a &quot;No Parking&quot; sign at\r\n  the parking lot entrance from Carteret Street and that the space they parked in\r\n  was marked &quot;For BB&amp;T Customers Only.&quot;Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  sum, the Davidsons failed to present even a scintilla of evidence showing their\r\n  status as invitees or licensees.Â  Therefore, the only duty BB&amp;T or Tidal\r\n  Wave had toward the Davidsons as trespassers was the duty not to do them\r\n  willful or wanton injury.Â  See id., 372 S.C. at 160, 641\r\n  S.E.2d at 66&nbsp;(indicating that a landowner owes no duty to a trespasser\r\n  except the duty not to do him willful or wanton injury).Â \r\n  There is no evidence in the record showing that Tidal Wave or BB&amp;T willfully\r\n  or wantonly injured the Davidsons.\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the master properly granted summary judgment to Tidal Wave.Â  See Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP (providing that summary judgment must be granted &quot;if the pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\n  law&quot;).\r\nII.Â  Brantley\r\n  and Collins\r\nThe Davidsons\r\n  assert that the master erred in granting summary judgment to Brantley and\r\n  Collins because there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether\r\n  Brantley or Collins was responsible for maintaining the safety of the area\r\n  surrounding\r\n  the construction site at the Waterfront Park.[8]Â  We disagree. \r\nTo establish a negligence claim, a plaintiff must show: (1) a duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff; (2) breach of\r\n  that duty; and (3) damages proximately resulting from the breach.Â  Fowler v. Hunter, 388 S.C. 355, 361, 697 S.E.2d 531, 534&nbsp;(2010).Â  &quot;Generally, there is no common law duty to act.&quot; Â Jensen v. Anderson Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 304 S.C. 195, 199, 403 S.E.2d 615, 617&nbsp;(1991).Â  &quot;An affirmative legal duty, however, may be created by statute,\r\n  contract relationship, status, property interest, or some other special\r\n  circumstance.&quot;Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  Â  \r\nHere, any\r\n  activities undertaken by Brantley or Collins that could have possibly affected\r\n  any adjacent property (such as the BB&amp;T parking lot) are irrelevant because\r\n  the Davidsons presented no evidence to establish their status as invitees on\r\n  the parking lot or to show any special relationship between themselves and\r\n  Brantley or Collins.Â  See Gauld v. O'Shaugnessy Realty\r\n    Co., 380 S.C. 548, 559, 671 S.E.2d 79, 85&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;A\r\n  complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the [nonmoving]\r\n  party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.&quot;) (internal\r\n  citation and quotation marks omitted).Â  Â Â \r\nFurther, the\r\n  Davidsons cite no statute imposing a duty on Brantley or Collins to protect\r\n  them.Â  Moreover, the City's contractual relationships with Brantley and Collins\r\n  do not contemplate any third party beneficiaries.Â  The City's contractual\r\n  relationship with Brantley merely requires it to take reasonable steps to avoid\r\n  harm to persons on the construction site resulting from any construction\r\n  activities.Â  No provision of the contract requires Brantley to protect\r\n  trespassers on adjacent property from the criminal acts of third parties.Â  Likewise,\r\n  no provision of the City's contract with Collins requires such protection.Â  \r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, Brantley and Collins were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â \r\n  Therefore, the master properly granted summary judgment to them.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Discovery\r\nThe Davidsons\r\n  maintain that the master erred in granting summary judgment to Respondents when\r\n  discovery had not yet been completed.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;A\r\n  complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the [nonmoving]\r\n  party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.&quot;Â  Gauld,\r\n  380 S.C. at 559, 671 S.E.2d at 85&nbsp;(internal citation and quotation marks\r\n  omitted).Â  Therefore, &quot;the nonmoving party must demonstrate the\r\n  likelihood that further discovery will uncover additional relevant evidence and that the party is not merely engaged in a fishing expedition.&quot;Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580\r\n  S.E.2d 433, 439&nbsp;(2003) (internal citation and quotation marks\r\n  omitted) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Davidsons assert that numerous depositions were required to gather evidence on\r\n  the following issues: Â (1) how the BB&amp;T parking lot was &quot;held open to\r\n  the public;&quot; (2) lighting in the parking lot; and (3) who was responsible\r\n  for lighting. Â They also argue that they were prevented from completing\r\n  discovery on these topics, including giving their own depositions, by the\r\n  circuit court's August 3, 2007 order staying their action pending the\r\n  conclusion of the criminal investigation of the abduction.Â  However, this order\r\n  clearly states &quot;[D]iscovery shall proceed to the degree possible without\r\n  the disclosure of the subject criminal file.&quot;Â  Further, the circuit court\r\n  issued another order on March 26, 2008, to clarify the intent of its August 3,\r\n  2007 order.Â  In the March 26, 2008 order, the circuit court ruled that the\r\n  earlier order staying the action did not preclude the master from hearing\r\n  dispositive motions.Â Â Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  nothing precluded the Davidsons from submitting their own affidavits to support\r\n  their allegation that Tidal Wave or BB&amp;T invited them into the BB&amp;T parking\r\n  lot.Â  Because the Davidsons failed to submit any evidence supporting this\r\n  essential element of their negligence claim when they had the opportunity to do\r\n  so, all other facts in the case were immaterial at that point, and further\r\n  discovery would have been useless.Â  See Dawkins, 354\r\n  S.C. at 69, 580 S.E.2d at 439 (holding that the nonmoving party must\r\n  show a likelihood that further discovery will uncover additional relevant\r\n  evidence); Gauld, 380 S.C. at 559, 671 S.E.2d at 85 (holding that a\r\n  failure of proof on an essential element of the case renders all other facts\r\n  immaterial).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  master's order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We\r\n  decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The Davidsons were\r\n  Charleston residents.Â  \r\n[3] Carteret Street is perpendicular to and intersects with Bay\r\n  Street, as shown in the site plan attached to the City's contract with\r\n  Collins.Â  \r\n[4] Rule\r\n  36(a),\r\n  SCRCP,\r\n  states in pertinent part:Â  &quot;The\r\n  matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after service of the request . . . the\r\n  party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the\r\n  admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter, signed by the\r\n  party or by his attorney . . . .&quot;Â  \r\n[5] See Rule 36(b),\r\n  SCRCP (&quot;Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless\r\n  the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission.&quot;).\r\n[6] Subsections (c)\r\n  and (e) of Rule 56 allow the parties to supplement or oppose affidavits with\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file. \r\n[7] At a prior\r\n  hearing on a motion to dismiss filed by Tidal Wave and BB&amp;T, counsel\r\n  submitted photographs, which were taken a few weeks after the abduction, purporting\r\n  to depict the alleged public parking signs.Â  Counsel also briefly questioned a\r\n  city employee in his deposition about two photographs of the purported signs.Â \r\n  Yet, the employee did not indicate to whom the signs belonged or where they\r\n  were located, despite counsel's prompting.Â  Curiously, counsel did not submit\r\n  these photographs to the master at the summary judgment hearing.Â  But even\r\n  assuming these photographs could be considered part of the record before the\r\n  master, the Davidsons did not include the photographs in the Record on Appeal.Â \r\n  Therefore, we are unable to consider them.Â  See Rule 210(h), SCACR\r\n  (&quot;Except as provided by Rule 212 [Supplemental Record] and Rule\r\n  208(b)(1)(C) and (2) [Statement of the Case], the appellate court will not\r\n  consider any fact which does not appear in the Record on Appeal.&quot;); Germain v.

Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Fred\r\n  Smith, III, appeals his commitment to the South Carolina Department of Mental\r\n  Health pursuant to a jury's finding he was a sexually violent predator (SVP)\r\n  under the Sexually Violent Predator Act (the SVP Act).Â  Smith argues the trial\r\n  court committed reversible error by limiting his cross-examination of the State's\r\n  forensic psychologist regarding the conditions of his expected probation.Â  He\r\n  contends that limitation violated his right to a meaningful cross-examination\r\n  and excluded relevant evidence regarding alternate sources of treatment.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nThe proceedings for\r\n  committing inmates under the SVP Act are civil in nature.Â  In re Luckabaugh,\r\n  351 S.C. 122, 135, 568 S.E.2d 338, 344 (2002).Â  &quot;[A]lthough historically\r\n  limited to criminal prosecutions, [the right to confront one's witnesses] has\r\n  been applied in the civil context&quot; under a procedural due process\r\n  analysis.Â  S.C. Dep't Soc. Serv. v. Holden, 319 S.C. 72, 78, 459 S.E.2d\r\n  846, 849 (1995) (citations omitted).Â  Within that analysis, &quot;due process\r\n  is not violated if there has been a meaningful opportunity to be heard.&quot;Â  Id. at 78, 459 S.E.2d at 849-50 (citation omitted).Â  Moreover, &quot;[t]he scope of\r\n  cross-examination rests largely in the discretion of the trial court.&quot;Â  Watson\r\n    ex rel. Watson v. Chapman, 343 S.C. 471, 482, 540 S.E.2d 484, 489 (Ct.

Ford Motor Co., 385\r\n  S.C. 119, 133, 682 S.E.2d 877, 884 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  Whether an error is\r\n  prejudicial depends upon the importance of the witness's testimony, whether the\r\n  testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of corroborating or\r\n  contradicting testimony, the extent of cross-examination permitted, and the\r\n  strength of the opposing party's case.Â  State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 333-34, 563\r\n  S.E.2d 315, 318-19 (2002) (citation omitted).\r\nHere, (1) Smith was given a\r\n  meaningful opportunity to be heard and (2) no prejudice occurred in limiting\r\n  Smith's cross-examination.Â  Smith extensively cross-examined the forensic\r\n  psychologist about sex-offender programs in general and whether they could reduce\r\n  the likelihood of an inmate's recidivism.Â  Moreover, the forensic psychologist testified\r\n  about a psychological report and actuarial risk analysis he performed on Smith\r\n  and suggested proper probation programs could reduce Smith's likelihood for\r\n  re-offending.Â  The forensic psychologist also provided detailed testimony about\r\n  Smith's lengthy criminal history and psychological problems.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  trial court properly limited the cross-examination.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-203","title":"Witt General Contractors v.

Stanley, of\r\n          Little River, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this mechanic's lien foreclosure action, appellant Robert Farrell appeals the\r\n  decision of the special referee asserting error in the referee's (1) failure to\r\n  offset the amount of damages for his breach of warranty claim against the\r\n  judgment in favor of respondent Witt General Contractor's, Inc., (hereinafter\r\n  Contractor) (2) award of judgment for Contractor on its breach of contract\r\n  cause of action, and (3) award of judgment on Contractor's mechanic's lien\r\n  cause of action.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis action arises from a\r\n  dispute over construction on a house.Â  Contractor filed a mechanic's lien and\r\n  thereafter sought foreclosure of the mechanic's lien in an action asserting\r\n  causes of action of breach of contract and unjust enrichment.Â  Contractor\r\n  asserted he was entitled to judgment in the sum of $32,137.53, together with\r\n  interest, costs and attorney's fees.Â  Farrell answered and counterclaimed,\r\n  raising various defenses and asserting deficiencies in Contractor's work to\r\n  support his counterclaims for, among other things, negligence, unjust\r\n  enrichment, and breach of warranty.Â  \r\nBy consent, the matter was\r\n  referred to a special referee. At the hearing on the matter, Wilbur Witt, the\r\n  owner and president of Witt General Contractor's, Inc., testified he was first\r\n  contacted by Farrell to work on the house in question around the beginning of\r\n  October 2004.Â  According to Witt, Farrell was interested in purchasing the home\r\n  and wanted him to &quot;check out&quot; the house and see &quot;whether or not\r\n  he could go ahead and purchase it and finish it and put it on the market&quot;\r\n  to make a profit.Â  Based on his evaluation, Witt estimated it would cost\r\n  between $80,000 and $100,000 to repair the home.Â  Witt stated his estimation\r\n  was just a general overview of the house when he went through it, and he did\r\n  not know exactly &quot;how bad&quot; the house would be until he got in there.Â \r\n  When asked about his arrangement with Farrell, Witt testified that when his men\r\n  were on the jobsite, &quot;it was going to be time and material,&quot; that he\r\n  was going to pay for all the subcontractors that he subbed out, and at the end\r\n  of the project they would &quot;divvy up some of the profits.&quot; [2]Â \r\n  Witt denied the parties had a fixed price contract, stating he would never have\r\n  accepted that because of the potential for unforeseen problems.Â  When\r\n  explaining what he meant by his assertion that he was to be paid on a time and\r\n  material basis, Witt stated the time spent on the job was to be billed at his\r\n  company's hourly rate for each employee.Â  When Witt took his general\r\n  walk-through of the property, he noticed some framing problems, but once he got\r\n  into the project he found other problems with the house, most notably the\r\n  trusses.Â  The problems with the trusses then caused significant other problems\r\n  throughout the house.Â  Witt maintained he could not have known about these\r\n  problems when he talked with Farrell about the project in October, as he did\r\n  not have the truss diagrams at that time. \r\nContractor began working on\r\n  the home on December 7, 2004.Â  In order to provide money for the work, an\r\n  account was opened by Farrell at a local bank with Farrell and Witt's names on\r\n  it.Â  Farrell initially wired $25,000 into the account and Contractor would pay\r\n  bills from the account as needed, calling Farrell when the account would get\r\n  low so that Farrell could wire more money.Â  The parties agreed that Farrell\r\n  deposited a total of $115,000 into the account for construction of the home.Â \r\n  Toward the end of the project, Farrell informed Witt that he could not put any\r\n  more money into the house.Â  Because there were outstanding bills, Witt borrowed\r\n  $20,000 on a line of credit and put the money in the account for payment of\r\n  these bills.Â  Around the middle of May 2005, Contractor had a final inspection\r\n  on the home and obtained a certificate of occupancy.Â  According to Witt, the\r\n  home still needed some touch-up, clean-up and repair work, but Farrell withdrew\r\n  the remaining money from the account and prevented Contractor from going on the\r\n  job site to finish the work.Â  The money Farrell removed from the account\r\n  included over $4,000 of the unspent portion of the line of credit money Witt\r\n  had provided.\r\nIncluded within the cost of\r\n  the project was labor provided by two of Witt's employees.Â  Witt acknowledged\r\n  that he billed them at a rate of $45 an hour for the project, and what he\r\n  billed for their labor was higher than what the employees were actually paid.\r\n  Witt explained that $45 was the rate he billed for a &quot;time and\r\n  material&quot; job, and that this allowed him to cover his overhead and\r\n  profit.Â  He noted his overhead included workers' compensation and liability\r\n  insurance, as well as fuel costs, his own salary and &quot;everything else it\r\n  takes to operate a business.&quot;Â  Witt stated $45 was his going rate for any\r\n  customer.\r\nFarrell testified that he\r\n  asked Witt to look at the house and let him know what he thought it would take\r\n  to finish the construction.Â  He stated Witt informed him he could complete the\r\n  house for between $80,000 and $100,000, closer to $100,000 if he wanted certain\r\n  upgrades.Â  According to Farrell, the parties had a verbal contract.Â  He claimed\r\n  it was a fixed price contract, where Witt would complete the house for between\r\n  $80,000 and $100,000.Â  When they had already spent $110,000 and Witt asked for\r\n  $5,000 more, Farrell agreed but told Witt that he would put no more into the\r\n  project.Â  Farrell changed the locks on the house, locking out Witt, when Witt\r\n  failed to complete the house within a promised two week period.Â  Farrell\r\n  acknowledged that Witt loaned $20,000 to the project, depositing the money into\r\n  the account on June 2, 2005.Â  However, he testified Witt did not tell him about\r\n  the loan and he thought the remaining money he removed from the account was\r\n  his.Â  When asked whether he had an issue with Witt's labor charges of $45 an\r\n  hour, Farrell stated he did not, asserting that the parties had a fixed price\r\n  contract.Â  He further stated he was not concerned with the labor charges\r\n  &quot;in the least bit, not under the agreed contract.&quot;Â  \r\nFollowing the hearing, the\r\n  referee issued an order concluding Contractor had a valid mechanic's lien,\r\n  Contractor and Farrell did not have a valid contract but one was not needed to\r\n  uphold the mechanic's lien, and that Contractor bestowed a benefit to Farrell\r\n  in the amount of $20,000 and Farrell was unjustly enriched in that amount.Â  The\r\n  referee further denied an award of attorney's fees and costs to either party.Â \r\n  He then ordered Farrell's causes of action against Contractor be dismissed,\r\n  with the exception of Farrell's unjust enrichment claim for labor and\r\n  materials.[3]\r\nFarrell filed a motion for\r\n  reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP asserting, among other things,\r\n  because there was no written contract and Contractor failed to present evidence\r\n  of the amount of his overhead, numerous items were nonlienable and could not be\r\n  included in the mechanic's lien.Â  Included within those items was an alleged\r\n  &quot;minimum of $2,358.00&quot; for labor charges on two of Contractor's\r\n  employees, which Farrell contended was an overcharge by Contractor.Â  Farrell\r\n  also asserted, while there was no written contract, there was a quasi-contract\r\n  or contract implied at law, and the evidence presented indicated the contract\r\n  provided the cost of repair to the house was not to exceed $100,000.Â \r\n  Additionally, Farrell maintained in his 59(e) motion that he was entitled to an\r\n  award for his breach of implied warranty of services in a workmanlike manner\r\n  claim based on evidence of the Contractor's deficiencies in his work on the\r\n  house.\r\nIn response, the special\r\n  referee filed a supplemental order addressing the various matters raised by\r\n  Farrell in his 59(e) motion.Â  In regard to Farrell's argument concerning\r\n  nonlienable labor charges, the referee determined that the testimony of Witt\r\n  showed that part of the hourly basis for his services included overhead and\r\n  profit, and, as such, these amounts were not submitted standing alone and were\r\n  therefore properly lienable.Â Â  \r\nAs to Farrell's assertion\r\n  regarding a quasi-contract or implied contract, the referee noted that in his\r\n  original order he had determined there was no meeting of the minds with regard\r\n  to the material elements of a contract and therefore awarded Contractor damages\r\n  on its unjust enrichment claim.Â  The referee then stated, &quot;[Farrell's]\r\n  argument convinces me that this was an error and a decision on the basis of\r\n  implied contract should have been rendered instead,&quot; and found the parties\r\n  were in agreement with all of the substantial terms of the proposed\r\n  improvements to the real estate.Â  The referee noted the only material point of\r\n  disagreement between the parties was that Farrell claimed the cost of the\r\n  repairs and upgrade was not to exceed $100,000, while Witt asserted their\r\n  discussion on the matter included only an estimate of costs between $80,000 and\r\n  $100,000.Â  He concluded, &quot;[a]fter listening to all of the testimony and\r\n  having a chance to observe the witnesses, I am of the opinion that there was an\r\n  implied contract under which [Contractor] was to improve the house and be\r\n  reimbursed the cost of labor at an agreed rate, plus the cost of materials.Â  I,\r\n  therefore, reverse my decision on the mechanic's lien and find that\r\n  [Contractor] is entitled to foreclosure on the mechanic's lien on the basis of\r\n  implied contract.&quot;Â  The referee determined he accepted the testimony and\r\n  accounting records of Mrs. Witt regarding the $32,137.53 figure due, with the\r\n  exception of a $5,000.00 deposit, and concluded the amount due Contractor on\r\n  the implied contract was therefore $27,137.53.Â  Additionally, the referee\r\n  determined Contractor was the prevailing party and was entitled to attorney's\r\n  fees of $9,578.45 and costs of $1,597.80, for a total judgment against Farrell\r\n  in the amount of $38,313.78. \r\nFinally, as to Farrell's\r\n  argument that he was entitled to an award for Contractor's breach of implied\r\n  warranty of services in a workmanlike manner, the referee agreed Contractor did\r\n  breach this implied warranty. Â He therefore &quot;award[ed] damages sustained by\r\n  [Farrell] on the breach of implied warranty cause of action in the amount of\r\n  $7,000.&quot;Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n1. Whether the referee's supplemental order failed to properly offset the\r\n  amount of damages awarded Farrell on his breach of warranty claim.\r\n2.&nbsp; Whether the referee erred in awarding judgment with regard to Witt's\r\n  breach of contract cause of action because (a) the referee did not have the\r\n  power to rule in favor of Witt on his breach of contract claim in the\r\n  supplemental order and (b) the referee's award of judgment on Witt's breach of\r\n  contract claim was not supported by the evidence.\r\n3. Whether the referee erred in awarding judgment with regard to\r\n  Contractor's mechanic's lien cause of action because (a) the referee did not\r\n  have the power to rule in favor of Witt on his mechanic's lien action in the\r\n  supplemental order, (b) the invoices submitted in support of the mechanic's\r\n  lien contained numerous items that were not for the improvement of real estate,\r\n  and (c) the special referee erred in ruling Witt was entitled to reimbursement\r\n  of attorney's fees and costs under the mechanic's lien statute.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nForeclosure of a mechanic's\r\n  lien is an action at law.Â  T.W. Morton Builders, Inc. v. von Buedingen,\r\n  316 S.C. 388, 397, 450 S.E.2d 87, 92 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  An action for breach of\r\n  contract seeking money damages is an action at law.Â  Roberts v. Gaskins,\r\n  327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In an action at law,\r\n  the appellate court will correct any error of law, but must affirm the special\r\n  referee's factual findings unless there is no evidence that reasonably supports\r\n  those findings.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp; Offset of Damages\r\nFarrell first contends the\r\n  special referee erred in failing to properly offset the amount of damages awarded\r\n  to him under his counterclaim for breach of implied warranty of services in a\r\n  workmanlike manner.Â  He notes that, though the referee found he was entitled to\r\n  an award against Contractor in the amount of $7,000, the referee only ordered\r\n  judgment against him in the amount of $38,313.78 in the &quot;Conclusions&quot;\r\n  portion of his supplemental order.Â  In response to Contractor's assertion that this\r\n  issue is not preserved for appeal, Farrell maintains he did not challenge the\r\n  matter through a second motion because the order was plain on its face in\r\n  awarding him $7,000 and awarding Contractor $38,313.78, and it was only through\r\n  Contractor's interpretation of the order that any error occurred.Â  Farrell\r\n  maintains that during preparation of this appeal, he learned Contractor's\r\n  position was that Farrell owed the full $38,313.78, without credit for the\r\n  $7,000 awarded to him in the supplemental order.\r\nWe find the order is plain on\r\n  its face and grants judgment to Contractor in the amount of $38,313.78, which\r\n  includes $27,137.53 on Contractor's implied contract cause of action along with\r\n  attorney's fees of $9,578.45 and costs of $1,597.80.Â  The order also clearly\r\n  awards Farrell $7,000 on his breach of implied warranty cause of action.Â  Therefore,\r\n  there was no error by the referee, and the order is plain on its face that\r\n  Farrell is entitled to an offset of $7,000 against Contractor's award of\r\n  $38,313.78.\r\nII.&nbsp; Breach of Contract\r\nA. Â Power to Rule\r\nFarrell contends the special\r\n  referee did not have the power to rule in favor of Contractor with regard to\r\n  Contractor's breach of contract cause of action because, though Farrell filed a\r\n  motion to alter or amend the original order, Contractor did not file any\r\n  post-trial motions or seek relief from the referee's original order.Â  He therefore\r\n  contends the issue of Contractor's breach of contract claim was not properly\r\n  before the referee and the referee's reversal of his previous order on\r\n  Contractor's cause of action for breach of contract was beyond the scope of the\r\n  motion before the referee.\r\nThis\r\n  issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Farrell is asserting the supplemental\r\n  order granted relief not presented to the referee.Â  Because Farrell is\r\n  challenging something that was altered from the original judgment, he was\r\n  required to bring a second motion for reconsideration to present the issue to\r\n  the referee for his consideration.Â  Since this argument was neither raised to\r\n  nor ruled upon by the referee, it is not preserved for our review.Â  See Robinson\r\n  v. Robinson, 365 S.C. 583, 585, 619 S.E.2d 425, 426 (2005) (finding a\r\n  second motion for reconsideration is appropriate if it challenges something\r\n  that was altered from the original judgment as a result of the initial motion); I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716,\r\n  724 (2000) (noting the losing party generally must both present his issues and\r\n  arguments to the lower court and obtain a ruling before an appellate court will\r\n  review those issues and arguments); Van Ness v. Eckerd Corp., 350 S.C.\r\n  399, 403-04, 566 S.E.2d 193, 196 (Ct. App. 2002) (determining, where the trial\r\n  judge recused himself following the filing of a motion to reconsider, the issue\r\n  of propriety of trial judge's recusal was not preserved for review because\r\n  appellant failed to make a Rule 59(e) motion challenging the recusal); In re\r\n  Estate of Timmerman, 331 S.C. 455, 460, 502 S.E.2d 920, 922 (Ct. App. 1998)\r\n  (holding when a party receives an order granting relief not previously\r\n  contemplated or presented to the trial court, the aggrieved party must move,\r\n  pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment in order to\r\n  preserve the issue for appeal).\r\nB.&nbsp; Support of Evidence\r\nFarrell next contends the\r\n  referee erred in awarding Contractor judgment on his breach of contract cause\r\n  of action because the referee's award was not supported by the evidence. Â Farrell\r\n  argues the referee's finding that the parties were in agreement with all the\r\n  substantial terms of the proposed improvements to the real estate was a direct\r\n  contradiction of the evidence.Â  In particular, Farrell asserts the evidence\r\n  shows (1) Contractor never sent any invoices to him until after the mechanic's\r\n  lien was filed, (2) the hourly rates charged to the project were never\r\n  disclosed to him prior to or during the renovations, and (3) the parties\r\n  discussed that the repairs would cost between $80,000 and $100,000.Â  He\r\n  therefore contends the evidence demonstrates there was no meeting of the minds\r\n  and the award based on breach of contract is unsupported by the evidence.\r\nFirst, there is evidence of\r\n  record that the reason the invoices were not sent to Farrell was that Farrell\r\n  declined Contractor's offer to fax them to him, instructing Contractor instead\r\n  to keep the invoices in the file.Â  Contractor then made two copies of each\r\n  invoice so that Farrell would have a copy, and the file was always available to\r\n  Farrell.Â  As to Contractor's failure to disclose the hourly rates charged to\r\n  the project, Witt stated $45 was his going rate for any customer, and Farrell\r\n  testified he had no issue with Contractor's $45 an hour labor charges and he\r\n  was not concerned &quot;in the least bit&quot; with those charges.Â  Finally,\r\n  while the parties did discuss the figures of $80,000 to $100,000 for the cost\r\n  of repairs, Witt's testimony is clear that this was not a term of the contract,\r\n  but was only an initial estimate of the costs of the project.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find no merit to Farrell's argument that the award based on breach of contract\r\n  is unsupported by the evidence. [4]\r\nIII.&nbsp; Mechanic's Lien\r\nA. Power to Rule\r\nFarrell contends the original\r\n  order of the special referee did not grant judgment to Contractor on the\r\n  mechanic's lien, but the referee reversed this previous order and awarded\r\n  Contractor relief on the mechanic's lien cause of action.Â  Farrell asserts, as\r\n  with the breach of contract cause of action, there was no motion before the\r\n  referee that allowed for reconsideration of the referee's original denial of\r\n  the mechanic's lien, and the referee was therefore without the power to rule\r\n  for Contractor on the mechanic's lien cause of action.\r\nFarrell is, again, asserting\r\n  the supplemental order granted relief not presented to the referee.Â  Because\r\n  Farrell is challenging something that was altered from the original judgment,\r\n  he was required to bring a second motion for reconsideration to present the\r\n  issue to the referee for his consideration.Â  As with Farrell's argument\r\n  concerning the referee's power to rule in favor of Contractor on its breach of\r\n  contract cause of action, this argument is not preserved for our review.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inflated Salary Rates\r\nFarrell contends the special\r\n  referee erred in awarding judgment with regards to Contractor's mechanic's lien\r\n  cause of action because the invoices submitted in support of the mechanic's\r\n  lien contained numerous items that were not for the improvement of real\r\n  estate.Â  He argues that section 29-5-10 et. seq. applies only\r\n  when a person performs work or furnishes material actually used in the\r\n  erection, alteration, or repair of a building or structure, and items filed for\r\n  matters other than improvement of real estate are invalid, unless specifically\r\n  set forth in the contract.Â  Because lost profits and overhead were not\r\n  specifically included as construction items in the contract, they were not\r\n  lienable and not recoverable items.Â  Farrell argues it was impossible for the\r\n  special referee to find that the &quot;inflated&quot; salary rates of\r\n  Contractor's employees were an agreed upon term of the contract, and as a\r\n  result, &quot;the mechanic's lien must be greatly reduced.&quot;\r\nSection 29-5-10 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A\r\n  person to whom a debt is due for labor performed or furnished or for materials\r\n  furnished and actually used in the erection, alteration, or repair of a\r\n  building or structure upon real estate or the boring and equipping of wells, by\r\n  virtue of an agreement with, or by consent of, the owner of the building or\r\n  structure, or a person having authority from, or rightfully acting for, the\r\n  owner in procuring or furnishing the labor or materials shall have a lien upon\r\n  the building or structure and upon the interest of the owner of the building or\r\n  structure in the lot of land upon which it is situated to secure the payment of\r\n  the debt due to him.\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (2007).\r\nIn Sentry Engineering\r\n  &amp; Construction, Inc. v. Mariner's Cay Devlopment. Corp., 287 S.C. 346,\r\n  338 S.E.2d 631 (1985), our supreme court noted a contractor's mechanic's lien\r\n  may properly include &quot;oversight&quot; and supervisory services, and stated\r\n  the following general rule:\r\nSince\r\n  the statutes provide a lien for labor performed and materials furnished, the\r\n  question arises, particularly where a contractor works under a cost-plus\r\n  contract, whether items which are not direct labor or material costs, such as\r\n  overhead and profit, are lienable.Â  Such items, as such and standing by themselves,\r\n  are nonlienable, but they become lienable when they are included in a contract\r\n  price or are reflected in the reasonable value of labor or materials\r\n  furnished.Â  Thus, the cost or value of labor for which a lien may be\r\n  claimed is not necessarily confined to the actual wages paid by the employer to\r\n  the employee actually performing the labor.Â  It may also include costs and\r\n  expenses of operation in addition to direct wages paid.Â  \r\nId. at 352, 338 S.E.2d at 634-35 (quoting 53 Am. Jur. 2d Mechanic's\r\n  Liens, Â§ 107 (1970)) (emphasis added).Â  Thus, the court determined overhead\r\n  and profit, when stated as part of the contract price, are proper components of\r\n  a mechanic's lien.Â  Id. at 352, 338 S.E.2d at 635.\r\nIn Zepsa Construction, Inc.\r\n  v. Randazzo, 357 S.C. 32, 38, 591 S.E.2d 29, 32 (Ct. App. 2004), this court\r\n  determined the builder of a restaurant, which was only partially completed, was\r\n  not entitled to his overhead and lost profits as part of a mechanic's lien\r\n  claim, finding Sentry inapplicable for several reasons, including that\r\n  the parties' agreement did not include a provision for overhead and profit, and\r\n  the fact that construction in Sentry was substantially completed,\r\n  whereas only $10,000 of the $610,000 Zepsa project had been completed.Â \r\n  In doing so, this court stated as follows:\r\nBased\r\n  on our reading of Sentry, we believe the Supreme Court expanded the\r\n  items that are recoverable under the mechanic's lien statute to include\r\n  overhead and profit.Â  However, this holding is only available in the limited situation\r\n  where the terms of overhead and profit are agreed upon by the parties and are\r\n  subsequently embodied within a contract.\r\nId. at 37-38, 591 S.E.2d at 31-32.\r\nHere, the evidence supports a\r\n  finding that the overhead and profit were reflected in the reasonable\r\n  value of labor furnished.Â  The amount Contractor charged for labor was that\r\n  which was charged for all customers, and was included within the costs of\r\n  providing labor.Â  It was not the overhead and profit for the entire job to be\r\n  performed by Contractor, as it was in Zepsa.[5]Â \r\n  Further, the job here, as in Sentry, was substantially completed.Â  More\r\n  importantly, Farrell specifically indicated he had no problem with the amount\r\n  charged for labor on the job.Â  He merely disputed that the parties had a time\r\n  and materials contract, but instead insisted the parties agreed to a fixed\r\n  price contract.Â  The special referee resolved this issue in favor of\r\n  Contractor.Â  Accordingly, there was evidence to support the referee's inclusion\r\n  of the invoices for labor charges.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorney's Fees\r\n  and Costs\r\nFinally, Farrell contends the\r\n  special referee failed to properly award attorney's fees and costs to him as\r\n  the prevailing party in his original order, and then compounded the error by\r\n  reversing his original ruling and then awarding fees and costs to Contractor in\r\n  his supplemental order.Â  He asserts, in the event this court finds the referee\r\n  erred in reversing its decision on the mechanic's lien, he is entitled to\r\n  reimbursement for attorney's fees and costs, as he would then be the prevailing\r\n  party.Â  Alternatively, he argues should this court find the referee did have\r\n  the power to reverse himself on the mechanic's lien, but that such lien should\r\n  be reduced because of the improper inclusion of overhead and profit, the matter\r\n  should be remanded for a new determination as to the prevailing party.\r\nFarrell's argument in this\r\n  regard is wholly dependent on this court's reversal of the special referee.Â \r\n  Because we find Farrell is not entitled to reversal of these issues, we affirm\r\n  the attorney's fees and costs.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons,\r\n  the special referee's order granting judgment to Contractor in the amount of\r\n  $38,313.78, offset by Farrell's award of $7,000, is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT, and PIEPER,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without\r\n  oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Although the record indicates the home was\r\n  actually sold before this hearing was held, the record before the court does\r\n  not reflect if it was sold for a profit and, if so, how much profit.Â  If it was\r\n  sold for a profit, there is no indication Witt actually shared in any of the\r\n  profit.\r\n[3] In determining no valid contract existed between the\r\n  parties, the special referee found Contractor and Farrell did not have a\r\n  meeting of the minds as to a contract for the renovations and repairs, as the\r\n  parties did not mutually agree and assent to the terms of a contract.Â  Further,\r\n  it appears the referee's refusal to dismiss Farrell's counterclaim for unjust\r\n  enrichment was based upon his finding that Contractor failed to pay Farrell for\r\n  the labor and materials resulting from Contractor's deficiencies and incomplete\r\n  work on the subject property.Â  However, the referee did not grant Farrell any\r\n  sort of judgment or offset for Farrell's unjust enrichment claim in his initial\r\n  order. \r\n[4] It should be noted, although Farrell asserted in his\r\n  motion for reconsideration that there existed a quasi-contract or contract\r\n  implied at law, the referee implicitly determined there existed a contract\r\n  implied in fact, citing law for implied in fact contracts.Â  Express contracts\r\n  and contracts implied in fact are law actions, with the measure of damages\r\n  being determined by the parties' agreement, while quasi-contracts and contracts\r\n  implied by law are actions in equity for which the measure of the recovery is\r\n  the extent of the duty or obligation imposed by law, and is expressed by the\r\n  amount which the court considers the defendant has been unjustly enriched at\r\n  the expense of the plaintiff.Â  Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle\r\n  Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 8, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000). Â A contract &quot;implied\r\n  in fact&quot; arises when the assent of the parties is manifested by conduct,\r\n  not words.Â  Stanley Smith &amp; Sons v.

Savitz, and Appellate\r\n          Defender Tristan M. Shaffer, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Assistant Attorney General Mark R. Farthing,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Desmond Javon Sams appeals his conviction and\r\n  sentence for voluntary manslaughter.Â  Sams contends the trial court committed\r\n  reversible error by refusing to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter\r\n  when the evidence arguably supported a factual finding that Sams\r\n  unintentionally killed Jake Frazier (Victim) while acting in self-defense.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nThe trial court charged\r\n  murder, voluntary manslaughter, and self-defense, but declined to charge\r\n  involuntary manslaughter.Â  The jury returned with a guilty verdict on the\r\n  voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  Limited to the facts of this case, we hold the\r\n  trial court did not err.Â  Sams's appellate brief does not articulate which\r\n  definition of involuntary manslaughter he believes applies to the facts of his\r\n  case.[2]Â \r\n  Therefore, we will proceed to analyze the facts of this case under both\r\n  definitions. Â \r\n&quot;Involuntary\r\n  manslaughter is (1) the unintentional killing of another without malice, but\r\n  while engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause death or\r\n  great bodily harm; or (2) the unintentional killing of another without malice,\r\n  while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard for the safety of\r\n  others.&quot; Â State v. Wharton, 381 S.C. 209, 216, 672 S.E.2d 786,\r\n  789&nbsp;(2009).Â  &quot;If\r\n  there is any evidence warranting a charge on involuntary manslaughter, then the\r\n  charge must be given.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nSams did not qualify for an\r\n  involuntary manslaughter instruction under the first definition because his\r\n  conduct in placing his arms around Victim's neck and holding Victim down for\r\n  over eight minutes was of the type naturally tending to cause death or great\r\n  bodily harm.Â  See Wharton, 381 S.C. at 216, 672 S.E.2d at 789\r\n  (defining involuntary manslaughter as &quot;the\r\n  unintentional killing of another without malice, but while engaged in an\r\n  unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm&quot;). Â \r\nThis case can be factually\r\n  distinguished from State v. Chatman, 336\r\n  S.C. 149, 519 S.E.2d 100 (1999).Â  Chatman accidentally strangled the victim by\r\n  pressing his shoulder into the victim's neck while engaged in a fight with the victim\r\n  on the ground.Â  Id. at 153, 519 S.E.2d at 101-02.Â  The supreme court\r\n  noted Chatman's conduct was not such that naturally tended to cause death or\r\n  great bodily harm because it was not a traditional strangulation-type situation\r\n  involving the accused's hands placed around a victim's neck.Â  Id. at\r\n  153, 519 S.E.2d at 102. Â Thus, Chatman was entitled to an involuntary\r\n  manslaughter charge under the first definition.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn contrast to Chatman,\r\n  the present case is a traditional strangulation-type situation.Â  Sams wrapped\r\n  both arms around Victim's neck and applied pressure for over eight minutes.Â  Sams\r\n  continued to hold Victim face down in a choke hold even after Victim became\r\n  &quot;lifeless.&quot;Â  When the police arrived and asked Sams to release his\r\n  hold on Victim, Sams was reluctant to do so.Â  Furthermore, Sams did not\r\n  expressly argue below, nor does he suggest on appeal, that his actions were not\r\n  of the type naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm.Â  Even if Sams\r\n  had raised this argument, this contention is manifestly without merit.Â  See Rule 220(b)(2) (&quot;The Court of Appeals need not address a point which is\r\n  manifestly without merit.&quot;).Â  \r\nSams was likewise not entitled\r\n  to an involuntary manslaughter charge under the second definition.Â  See Wharton, 381 S.C. at 216, 672 S.E.2d at 789 (further defining\r\n  involuntary manslaughter as &quot;the\r\n  unintentional killing of another without malice, while engaged in a lawful\r\n  activity with reckless disregard for the safety of others&quot;).Â  Sams could only\r\n  qualify for an involuntary manslaughter instruction under the second definition\r\n  if he were acting lawfully in self-defense and unintentionally killed Victim.[3]Â  \r\nSams stated, &quot;I wasn't\r\n  choking him like hard to try to kill him&quot; and &quot;I wasn't trying to\r\n  kill him.&quot;Â  Even assuming Sams was acting lawfully in defending himself,\r\n  he admitted to intentionally choking Victim.Â  In addition, Sams exerted more\r\n  force than was reasonably necessary to defend himself by wrapping his arms\r\n  around Victim's neck for over eight minutes while Victim lay face down on the\r\n  floor and begged for his life.Â  See State v. Campbell, 111 S.C. 112, 113, 96 S.E. 543, 543-44&nbsp;(1918)\r\n  (&quot;A person assaulted, being without fault in bringing\r\n  on the difficulty, has the right to use such force as is necessary for his\r\n  complete self-protection, or which in the mind of a person of ordinary reason\r\n  and firmness would reasonably prevent the assailant from taking his life or inflicting\r\n  serious bodily harm.&quot;).\r\nState v. Pickens, in which the defendant argued he shot a\r\n  gun at his victim in self-defense, is analogous to the present case.Â  320 S.C.\r\n  528, 531-32, 466 S.E.2d 364, 366-67 (1996).Â  In Pickens, refusal to\r\n  charge involuntary manslaughter was proper because the defendant admitted he intentionally\r\n  shot the gun at the victim.Â  Id.Â  Like Pickens, Sams was either\r\n  not guilty by reason of self-defense, or guilty of voluntary manslaughter.Â  Id.Â \r\n  However, no evidence exists indicating Sams's actions were unintentional for\r\n  purposes of an involuntary manslaughter charge.\r\nThis case is distinguishable\r\n  from accidental trigger-pull gun cases where an involuntary manslaughter\r\n  instruction is often deemed appropriate.Â  See, e.g., State v. Mekler, 379 S.C. 12, 15-16, 664 S.E.2d 477, 479\r\n  (2008) (explaining an involuntary manslaughter instruction was warranted when\r\n  testimony supported defendant's assertion that she unintentionally shot victim\r\n  while acting in reckless disregard for the safety of others by negligently handling\r\n  a loaded shotgun); State v. Light, 378 S.C. 641, 648-49, 664 S.E.2d 465,\r\n  468-69 (2008) (holding an involuntary manslaughter instruction was warranted\r\n  when defendant testified he was struggling with his girlfriend to take\r\n  possession of a loaded shotgun when the gun unintentionally discharged); State\r\n  v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 53, 584 S.E.2d 110, 112-13 (2003) (finding\r\n  defendant's contradictory statements that he pulled the trigger and did not\r\n  intend to pull the trigger were sufficient to warrant a jury instruction on\r\n  involuntary manslaughter). \r\nHere, Sams admitted he\r\n  intentionally choked Victim but suggested he did not choke him hard enough to\r\n  kill him.Â  The intentional act of choking someone is evidence of malice, not\r\n  reckless disregard for the safety of others, and a malicious killing is not an\r\n  unintentional killing.Â  See Wharton, 381\r\n  S.C. at 216, 672 S.E.2d at 789 (defining involuntary manslaughter as &quot;the unintentional killing of another without\r\n  malice, while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard for the\r\n  safety of others&quot;) (emphasis added); see also Tate v. State,\r\n  351 S.C. 418, 426, 570 S.E.2d 522, 527&nbsp;(2002) (&quot;Malice is the\r\n  wrongful intent to injure another and indicates a wicked or depraved spirit\r\n  intent on doing wrong.&quot;).Â  Indeed, two eye-witnesses to the incident\r\n  testified Sams told Victim &quot;I'm going to . . . kill you&quot; while\r\n  engaged in the act of choking Victim.Â  \r\nBecause no evidence exists\r\n  demonstrating that this was an unintentional killing under either definition of\r\n  involuntary manslaughter, the decision of the trial court not to charge\r\n  involuntary manslaughter is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nWILLIAMS, GEATHERS, and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â We affirm without oral argument pursuant to Rule\r\n  215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â We are disturbed by the brevity of the legal\r\n  argument in Sams's appellate brief, which consists of less than a page.\r\n[3]Â  The trial court agreed to charge the jury on the law\r\n  of self-defense, and the State did not object to this charge.Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-206","title":"Bing v.

Blitch, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.:&nbsp; Kevin Chase was convicted of criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature (CDVHAN) and sentenced to ten years in\r\nprison.&nbsp; He was acquitted on charges of criminal sexual conduct in the first and third degree.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nChase and the victim, Mary Chase, were married but estranged at the time of the incident.&nbsp; On May 28, 2002, Chase went to the victim's home to see his\r\nchildren.&nbsp; After the children were asleep, the victim was in her bedroom folding laundry when Chase walked up behind her and choked her with his arm until\r\nshe passed out.[1]&nbsp; When the victim awoke, she was face down on the bed.&nbsp; She pulled away from Chase who\r\nwas behind her.&nbsp; Chase &quot;punched hard&quot; until his fist was inserted into her vagina.&nbsp; He remarked, &quot;[t]here, it's in.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nThe victim stood up and leaned against a door in her bedroom.&nbsp; She testified that she looked down and could see blood &quot;spurting and just running\r\nacross the floor.&quot;&nbsp; She told Chase, &quot;I think I'm going to die.&quot;&nbsp; Chase placed her on the toilet in the bathroom and inserted tampons\r\ninside her vagina to try to stop the bleeding.&nbsp; Eventually, Chase took her to the hospital.&nbsp;\r\nThe victim's surgeon testified that he &quot;attempted a vaginal examination, but it was too uncomfortable for her in the emergency room and also she was\r\nbleeding so heavily that [he] felt [he] needed to emergently go to the operating room to assess the problem.&quot;&nbsp; He explained that the victim lost half\r\nof her blood volume, which left her in shock.&nbsp; She suffered a laceration that extended from the inside of her vagina to her cervix and was approximately\r\nfive inches long and three and one-half inches deep.&nbsp; The surgeon testified that the laceration was so deep that he could &quot;see her spine or basically\r\npart of her tailbone.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp; Motion for Recusal\r\nChase contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to recuse the trial judge.&nbsp; The judge who presided over Chase's trial also heard argument in\r\na pre-trial hearing regarding the admissibility of videotapes of the defendant and the victim engaging in prior sexual activity.&nbsp; The judge declined to\r\nrule pre-trial but indicated that her &quot;inclination at [that] point [was] that they would not come in.&quot;&nbsp; The judge thought that the ruling should\r\nbe made &quot;in the context of the case and the testimony . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Chase claims that the State engaged in judge shopping by using its control over\r\nthe docket to ensure that the trial was scheduled in front of the pre-trial hearing judge.&nbsp; Though Chase conceded he had no complaint with the trial judge\r\nand did not claim the judge would be unfair, he argued that the State only presented possible trial dates during that judge's terms of court.&nbsp; The judge\r\ndenied Chase's motion for recusal finding that there was no evidence of judge shopping.&nbsp;\r\nWe affirm for two reasons.&nbsp; First, the judge's inclination on the admissibility of the videotapes was insufficient to support a motion to recuse.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;A motion to recuse may not be predicated upon the judge's rulings in the case before him . . . nor on his demonstrated tendency to rule in any particular\r\nmanner . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 146-47, 473 S.E.2d 804, 808 (Ct. App. 1996).&nbsp; Second, Chase admitted that he did not\r\nthink the judge would be unfair or partial.&nbsp; If Chase was unhappy with the delay, he could have made a motion for a speedy trial to address his complaint\r\nthat &quot;the State's control over the docket was exercised in a manner that deprived [Chase] of his right to due process of law.&quot;&nbsp;\r\n2.&nbsp; Exclusion of Videotapes\r\nChase contends that excluding videotapes of he and the victim engaged in previous consensual choking and fisting sexual activity was error.&nbsp; At trial,\r\nChase argued that the videotapes were admissible to prove consent.&nbsp; The trial judge ruled that the videotapes were inadmissible under the Rape Shield\r\nStatute.&nbsp; The judge explained &quot;[w]hether [the victim] consented a hundred times in the past to a particular activity is not relevant or probative on\r\nthe issue of whether she consented that particular night.&quot;&nbsp; While the trial court found that the activity on the videotapes was relevant to the\r\ndefense of accident or mistake, the judge found that the probative value was outweighed by the inflammatory or prejudicial nature of the videotapes.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  The Rape Shield Statute states, in relevant part:\r\n  \r\n    Evidence of specific instances of the victim's sexual conduct, opinion evidence of the victim's sexual conduct, and reputation evidence of the victim's\r\n    sexual conduct is not admissible in prosecutions under Sections 16-3-615 and 16-3-652 to 16-3-656; however, evidence of the victim's sexual conduct with the\r\n    defendant . . . is admissible if the judge finds that such evidence is relevant to a material fact and issue in the case and that its inflammatory or\r\n    prejudicial nature does not outweigh its probative value. &nbsp;\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-659.1(1) (2003).\r\nWe find the trial court's analysis under the Rape Shield Statute was correct. &nbsp;The judge first found the evidence contained on the videotapes to be\r\nrelevant to a material fact and then engaged in the balancing that the Rape Shield Statute requires.&nbsp; The trial judge concluded that the inflammatory or\r\nprejudicial nature outweighed its probative value[2], and we find this was within the trial court's discretion.\r\nHowever, the Rape Shield Statute applied only to the criminal sexual conduct charges and did not apply to the CDVHAN[3]\r\ncharge, which is the only charge relevant to this appeal. &nbsp;Chase argued the admissibility of the videotapes to the trial judge only under the Rape Shield\r\nStatute, and the judge ruled only under the Rape Shield Statute.&nbsp; Thus, it was incumbent upon Chase to seek an additional ruling under Rule 403, SCRE and\r\nany argument regarding admissibility of the videotapes as they relate to CDVHAN is not preserved for our review.&nbsp; State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138,\r\n142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003) (holding that an issue must be raised and ruled upon by the trial judge to preserve it for appellate review).&nbsp;\r\n3.&nbsp; Admission of Blood-Stained Items\r\nChase argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of blood-stained clothing and bedding.&nbsp; Chase argued that the probative value of the\r\nevidence was &quot;fairly weak&quot; compared to the unfair prejudice of the jury seeing the items covered in blood.&nbsp; Because the CDVHAN charge requires\r\nproof of a serious bodily injury, Chase also offered to stipulate that the victim received a &quot;violent injury that would meet the definition of the CDVHAN\r\nstatute&quot; in lieu of introducing the blood-stained items.&nbsp; The State argued that &quot;[t]he fact that there is blood all over the clothes is very,\r\nvery important to the State's case because it shows that [the victim's] story is consistent&quot; and that Chase and the victim were not engaged in consensual\r\nsex.&nbsp; The State declined to stipulate to the serious bodily injury.&nbsp; On appeal, Chase argues that this evidence was cumulative and unfairly\r\nprejudicial, and therefore inadmissible under Rule 403, SCRE.[4]&nbsp;\r\nRule 403, SCRE states &quot;[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\nprejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative\r\nevidence.&quot;&nbsp; A trial judge's evidentiary rulings will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&nbsp; State v. Saltz, 346 S.C.\r\n114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 (2001). &nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\ni.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cumulative\r\nAnalysis\r\nWe disagree with Chase's argument that the evidence should have been excluded as cumulative.&nbsp; The mere fact that admitted evidence was cumulative is not\r\nalone sufficient to sustain a Rule 403, SCRE objection.&nbsp; Rather, analysis under this prong of Rule 403, SCRE requires consideration of whether the evidence\r\nis a &quot;needless presentation of cumulative evidence.&quot;&nbsp; We agree, for example, that the surgeon's testimony about the amount of blood the victim\r\nlost immediately after the attack coupled with the presentation of the victim's blood-stained bedding is cumulative to other evidence.&nbsp; However, we\r\nconclude that providing the jury with a medical explanation of the injuries and a visual demonstration of how much blood the victim lost presented a complete\r\npicture of the injuries.&nbsp; Thus, it was within the trial court's discretion to find that the presentation &quot;goes to the evidence of establishing an\r\nessential element of the offense.&quot;&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfair\r\nPrejudice Analysis\r\nThe ruling not to exclude the blood-stained items on the basis of unfair prejudice was within the trial court's discretion.&nbsp; The probative value of\r\nblood-stained items is high.&nbsp; A CDVHAN charge is a combination of criminal domestic violence[5] and assault and\r\nbattery of a high and aggravated nature.&nbsp; ABHAN is &quot;an unlawful act or injury&quot; accompanied by an aggravating circumstance.&nbsp; State v.\r\nFennell, 340 S.C. 266, 274, 531 S.E.2d 512, 516 (2000).&nbsp; The aggravating circumstance articulated in the State's case was the infliction of serious\r\nbodily injury.&nbsp; 340 S.C. at 274, 531 S.E.2d at 516-17 (listing aggravating circumstances).&nbsp; The State had the burden of proving that Chase inflicted a\r\nserious bodily injury on the victim.\r\nFirst, the State presented the surgeon's testimony that the victim's pain coupled with the amount of blood she lost made it impossible for him to perform a\r\ncomplete medical exam in the emergency room.&nbsp; This testimony as well as the visibility of the blood on the bedding and clothing indicates that Chase's\r\nactions were not accidental but done with force sufficient to cause serious injury.&nbsp; The blood-stained items supported the seriousness of the injuries the\r\nsurgeon described.&nbsp; Thus, the evidence is highly probative of an essential element of CDVHAN.\r\nWe recognize there is also prejudice associated with the blood-stained items. &nbsp;However, we conclude that the trial judge properly conducted the\r\nbalancing analysis of the probative value of the blood-stained items and the potential prejudice.[6]&nbsp; The ruling\r\nwas within the trial court's discretion.&nbsp;\r\n4.&nbsp; Motion for Mistrial\r\nChase contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; The victim testified about her injuries and her\r\nrecovery process beginning on the second day of Chase's trial.&nbsp; On the morning of the third day of the trial, the jury foreperson explained to the trial\r\ncourt that he had prostate cancer and still has some of the &quot;same complications that [the victim has].&quot;&nbsp; He stated that he could no longer be\r\nfair and impartial and was excused from the jury.&nbsp;\r\nThe foreman also stated that he told the other members of the jury about the impact of his medical condition on his ability to serve.&nbsp; Chase moved for a\r\nmistrial and his motion was denied.&nbsp; However, the trial judge questioned each juror individually to determine what each heard the foreperson say.&nbsp; All\r\nof the jurors indicated that the foreperson commented about his health conditions.&nbsp; One juror told the court that the foreperson said &quot;the defense\r\nwould have to make a really good case&quot; and explained that there was &quot;[s]ome head nodding, thatâ€™s about all&quot; in response to the foreperson's\r\ncomment.&nbsp; Nevertheless, each juror indicated that he or she could remain fair and impartial.&nbsp;\r\nAfter the colloquy with the members of the jury, Chase again moved for a mistrial.&nbsp; The trial court again denied the motion, finding that a mistrial is\r\nnot required when all members of a jury indicate they can remain impartial.&nbsp; A trial judge's ruling on a motion for mistrial will not be disturbed absent\r\nan abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.&nbsp; State v. Sparkman, 358 S.C. 491, 495, 596 S.E.2d 375, 377 (2004).&nbsp; &quot;A mistrial\r\nshould only be granted in cases of manifest necessity and with the greatest caution for very plain and obvious reasons.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Patterson,\r\n337 S.C. 215, 227, 522 S.E.2d 845, 851 (Ct. App. 1999).&nbsp; &quot;[T]he conduct of jurors should be free from all extraneous or improper influences.&nbsp;\r\nUnless the misconduct affects the juror's impartiality, it is not such misconduct as will affect the verdict.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132,\r\n141, 502 S.E.2d 99, 104 (1998).&nbsp; We find that it was within the judge's discretion to determine that the foreperson's statements did not improperly\r\ninfluence the jury and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Chase's motion for a mistrial.\r\n5.&nbsp; Admission of Prior Bad Act Evidence\r\nChase contends that the trial court erred in admitting prior bad act evidence of domestic disputes between him and the victim.&nbsp; The State called\r\nSergeant Robert Walker to testify about his search of the victim's residence on the night of the offense.&nbsp; On cross examination, Chase asked &quot;[d]o you\r\nhave any evidence whatsoever that there was any criminal domestic violence in that home ever, any phone calls to the police or any investigators called out, any\r\ncomplaint to anybody?&quot;&nbsp; Walker replied, &quot;I believe we do have â€“ I don't know if its involving Mr. Chase, but we do have reports of a prior\r\nincident involving Mrs. Chase prior to this, yes.&quot;&nbsp; After Walker testified, the State argued that Chase opened the door, and sought to explore\r\ncriminal domestic violence in the Chase household with the next witness, Detective Michael Anderson.&nbsp; The judge ruled:\r\n\r\n  You asked the question.&nbsp; You asked if they had gone out to a prior domestic violence call, now it's in the air.&nbsp; He says to his knowledge they\r\n  did go, but that it involved Ms. Chase.&nbsp; That then leaves this unanswered, open-ended question in the jury's mind about why they go there, for what\r\n  purpose did they go, did it involve her and someone else.&nbsp; They're entitled to answer that.&nbsp; You did open the door.\r\n\r\nOutside the presence of the jury, the State explained that Anderson had suspicions of domestic violence when he initially went to the Chase home to\r\ninvestigate a reported burglary. &nbsp;After the victim reported that Chase had child pornography on his computer, Anderson asked the victim's advocate to\r\naccompany him to the Chase home to ask Mrs. Chase about domestic violence. &nbsp;The judge agreed to let the State explore the domestic violence issue but ruled\r\nthat any questioning about child pornography was &quot;off limits.&quot;&nbsp; The State then called Detective Anderson.&nbsp; He testified that in 2001 he\r\nresponded to a call that the Chase home had been burglarized.&nbsp; He explained that he returned to the Chase residence several times during the course of the\r\nburglary investigation.&nbsp; The State asked, &quot;[d]id you ever bring a victim advocate with you?&quot;&nbsp; Anderson responded, &quot;[y]es, sir. &nbsp;I\r\ndid.&quot;&nbsp; No additional testimony about his suspicions of domestic violence was elicited.\r\nRule 404(b), SCRE states that &quot;[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action\r\nin conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident,\r\nor intent.&quot;&nbsp; However, when one party introduces evidence, or opens the door, the other party is entitled to &quot;explain it or rebut it, even if the\r\nlatter evidence would have been . . . irrelevant had it been offered initially.&quot;&nbsp; State v. Beam, 336 S.C. 45, 52, 518 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct. App.\r\n1999).&nbsp; We affirm for two reasons.&nbsp; First, the judge's ruling that Chase opened the door to the State's exploration of past criminal domestic violence\r\ndisputes involving Chase and the victim was within her discretion.&nbsp; Second, the testimony the State elicited from Detective Anderson after Chase opened the\r\ndoor was not evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts.&nbsp; The evidence does not indicate that Chase was suspected of domestic violence and only indicates\r\nthat Anderson asked a victim's advocate to accompany him to the Chases' home.&nbsp; The State did not explore the criminal domestic violence issue any further\r\nand Chase did not clarify Anderson's testimony on cross-examination.\r\n6.&nbsp; Exclusion of Audiotaped Conversations\r\nChase contends the trial judge erred in excluding portions of audiotapes of conversations between him and the victim that occurred approximately four to six\r\nweeks after the incident.&nbsp; The State objected to any portion of the tapes being played for the jury.&nbsp; The trial court ruled:\r\n\r\n  Anything that deals with the actual sexual acts, anything that deals with the custody battle, all of that is clearly being offered for its truth.&nbsp;\r\n  [Chase's] theory is that [the victim] had an alternative motive, that she fabricated all of this to get some leverage in the custody battle.&nbsp; So the only\r\n  reason you would be offering a conversation between the two of them on this tape about custody would be for the truth of the matter asserted and its\r\n  hearsay.&nbsp; And unless you can give me an exception, it's not admissible.\r\n  . &nbsp;. &nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  I told you that you could offer it to show their tone as long as its not being offered for its truth.&nbsp; . . . &nbsp;There are many parts of this tape\r\n  you can choose to play that shows their tone with one another, I've told you that is fine, you can play that.\r\n\r\nChase argues that the trial judge erred in excluding any portion of the audiotapes because the conversations show &quot;that the victim and the Appellant\r\nwere engaging in overarching discussion about every aspect of their daily lives at that point in time.&quot;&nbsp; Chase contends the entirety of the tapes\r\nshowed both humorous and serious conversations that were relevant to show the nature of the relationship after the incident.&nbsp; We find the judge's ruling on\r\nthe admissibility of the audiotapes did not prevent Chase from demonstrating the nature of the conversations he had with the victim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFirst, the trial court's limitation on how much of the audiotape was played to the jury was partially based on trial management.&nbsp; This was within the\r\njudge's discretion under Rule 611(a), SCRE.[7]&nbsp; Chase argued that the conversations were offered only to\r\ndemonstrate the tone and nature of the communications between Chase and the victim.&nbsp; The trial judge explained, &quot;[w]ell, we don't need to hear the\r\nwhole tape to hear their tones.&nbsp; I mean, I've heard enough to know what their tone is with one another.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nSecond, the judge's trial management ruling did not prevent Chase from demonstrating the &quot;serious&quot; nature of the relationship he had with the\r\nvictim.&nbsp; The trial court excluded only portions of the audiotape that referred to the custody battle, the incident, and statements about his bond.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court did not exclude any other portion of the audiotape at the outset, providing Chase with &quot;approximately 200 pages of transcript which talk\r\nabout other things.&quot;&nbsp; Further, the admitted portions included more serious conversations between Chase and the victim.&nbsp; Thus, Chase was not\r\nprevented from presenting evidence of serious conversations with the victim and he was able show the full nature of their conversations.\r\nThird, because the admitted portions of the tape accomplished Chase's goal, the trial judge concluded that admitting any additional portions of the tapes\r\nserved no purpose other than to prove the truth of the statements. &nbsp;Based on this analysis, the trial judge was within her discretion in ruling that\r\nstatements by the victim related to the night of the incident, the custody dispute and the status of Chase's bond would be hearsay under Rule 801(c), SCRE.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n7.&nbsp; Limit on Testimony About Victim's Motivation to Fabricate Offense\r\nChase contends that the trial court erred in limiting testimony about the victim's potential motive for fabricating the charges, in violation of his Sixth\r\nAmendment right to present a complete defense.&nbsp; In a pre-trial motion, the judge ruled that while Chase was entitled to explore the victim's bias and\r\nmotivation to lie about the incident, he was prohibited from exploring specific incidents of conduct that occurred during the custody dispute between Chase and\r\nthe victim over Chase's daughter, Kalei.&nbsp; Chase sought to introduce testimony from Amy Lynch, Lindy Clifton, and Carolyn Berlin.&nbsp; We hold the\r\nlimitations the trial judge imposed on the presentation of each witness's testimony were within her discretion.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\ni.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy Lynch\r\nAmy Lynch, Kalei's biological mother, testified about her conspiracy with the victim to keep Chase from taking Kalei out of state.&nbsp; She testified, in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n  We both came up with a plan to keep Kevin away from Kalei, to keep him from being able to come get her.&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; We were determined . . . to get\r\n  his rights revoked.&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; And we would sit down and talk about what we were going to say on these recorded phone conversations.&nbsp; . . .&nbsp;\r\n  I would say bad things about Kevin that weren't true, but I was determined . . . to get him out of my daughter's life at that point.\r\n\r\nFirst, the objections and rulings as to Amy Lynch's testimony listed in Chase's brief concern hearsay.&nbsp; However, Chase makes no argument on appeal that\r\nthe judge erred in ruling that the statements were inadmissible as hearsay.&nbsp; Thus, these rulings stand as the law of the case.&nbsp; State v. Sampson,\r\n317 S.C. 423, 427, 454 S.E.2d 721, 723 (Ct. App. 2005).&nbsp; As to the merits, a ruling that a statement constitutes inadmissible hearsay does not violate a\r\ndefendant's constitutional right to present a defense.&nbsp; While a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to present witnesses in his defense, Crane\r\nv. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 687 (1986), the right to introduce even relevant evidence &quot;is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable\r\nrestrictions.&quot;&nbsp; U.S. v. Scheffer, 523 U.S. 303, 308 (1998).&nbsp; The exclusion of testimony based on state evidence law does not violate the\r\ndefendant's constitutional right to present evidence so long as the evidence law is &quot;not arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes it is designed to\r\nserve.&quot; &nbsp;Id. at 308 (internal quotations omitted).\r\nSecond, Chase argues that the trial judge's ruling interfered with his ability to prove that the victim had a motive to lie about the choking and fisting\r\nincident.&nbsp; However, we find Chase was able to elicit ample testimony from Lynch about her conspiracy with the victim to lie about Chase in order to\r\ninfluence the custody dispute over Kalei.&nbsp; Further, the trial court's decision to exclude wide-ranging testimony about conduct of the parties during the\r\ncustody battle was within her discretion under Rule 611(a), SCRE.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lindy\r\nClifton\r\nLindy Clifton, a certified child trauma specialist, was permitted to testify regarding Kalei's display of trauma symptoms related to domestic violence and\r\nabout the relationship between the child and the victim.&nbsp; As the testimony was presented at trial, the trial judge explained:\r\n\r\n  I am not going to allow them to rehash the custody case.&nbsp; I'm not going to retry the custody case.&nbsp; Quite frankly, it is not relevant to these\r\n  proceedings except to the limited extent of any motivation Ms. Chase may have and any â€“ as the defense contends, and any bearing that may have on her\r\n  credibility, her believability, her reliability, her veracity as a witness.\r\n\r\nWe find it was within the trial court's discretion to determine that the bond between Chase and his daughter as well as the custody battle should be excluded\r\nunder the court's Rule 611(a), SCRE, trial management authority.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\niii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carolyn\r\nBerlin\r\nChase also sought to offer Carolyn Berlin's testimony to impeach the victim's credibility.&nbsp; Specifically, Chase wanted Berlin to testify about whether\r\nthe victim was drugged by Chase on the night of the incident and whether the victim willingly used GHB.&nbsp; Chase also sought to have Berlin testify about the\r\nvictim's attempts to influence the custody case.&nbsp; The trial court refused to permit Berlin to testify about the custody case.&nbsp; After reviewing the\r\nvictim's testimony and asking the court reporter to verify, the trial court concluded that Chase did not ask the victim about drug usage.&nbsp; As a result, the\r\ntrial court ruled that Berlin's testimony could not be used to impeach the victim's statements about drug usage because the victim was never asked to admit or\r\ndeny the statements during Chase's cross-examination.&nbsp; We conclude that the trial court's ruling prohibiting testimony about drug usage was correct under\r\nRule 613(b), SCRE.[8]&nbsp;\r\n8.&nbsp; Jury Charge and Jury Question\r\nChase argues that the trial court erred in failing to give a charge on specific intent on the CDVHAN charge and erred in failing to define terms requested by\r\nthe jury during deliberation.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; When discussing requests for charge, Chase stated:\r\n\r\n  I would ask the Court charge with each element of the offense the actor would have to have criminal intent â€“ Judge I would just ask regarding the mens\r\n  rea requirement that the jury be charged that the defendant to be guilty of a criminal act must also have a criminal intent, and in this case with these\r\n  charges he must act knowingly and intentionally with regard to each element of the offense.\r\n\r\nThe trial court found &quot;the statutory language is adequate and . . . I'm going charge the statute.&quot;&nbsp; A trial court is generally required to\r\ncharge only the current and correct law.&nbsp; Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472-73 (2004).&nbsp; A jury charge is correct if it\r\ncontains the correct definition of law when read as a whole.&nbsp; State v. Rayfield, 369 S.C. 106, 119, 631 S.E.2d 244, 251 (2006).&nbsp; We find that\r\nthe jury charge was a correct statement of the law.\r\nThe goal of Chase's request for a charge on criminal intent was accomplished by the charge.&nbsp; The jury charge properly connected the definition of\r\nassault with the definition of battery.&nbsp; First, the trial court explained, &quot;[a]n assault is the intentional creation of a reasonable fear of immediate\r\nbodily harm.&quot;&nbsp; Then, she defined battery, &quot;[a] battery is the completion of the assault by using or applying force to another person, however\r\nslight, in a rude, angry or resentful manner without legal justification for doing so.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nBy connecting the definitions of assault and battery in this way, the judge defined the mental state the State must prove to differentiate what activity is\r\ncriminal and what activity is consensual.&nbsp; This instruction informed the jury that in order to find that Chase was guilty of CDVHAN, the State had to prove\r\nthat Chase committed an intentional assault by applying force in a &quot;rude, angry, or resentful manner.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nChase failed to submit his criminal intent charge request to the court in writing, even after the trial court requested it at multiple points in the trial as\r\nshe expressed concern about whether the requested charge was appropriate.&nbsp; If Chase wanted a more tailored instruction than the instruction the trial judge\r\ngave to the jury, he should have been more specific in his oral request, or he should have submitted a written request to the court.\r\nDuring deliberation, the jury sent the court a note asking for definitions of the terms &quot;intentional&quot; and &quot;willful.&quot;[9]&nbsp; The judge answered the jury as follows:\r\n\r\n  The elements of each offense and the relevant definitions have been provided to you within the Court's charge on the law.&nbsp; This is the law that you\r\n  are to apply in this case.&nbsp; If you desire to rehear the charge or any portion of the charge, please make me aware of it and I will accommodate your\r\n  request immediately.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe find that this response was within the trial court's discretion.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Both parties testified that they previously engaged in autoerotic asphyxiation of the victim by Chase and\r\nvaginal insertion of Chase's fist as part of their sexual relationship.\r\n[2] The balancing test under the Rape Shield Statute is different from the balancing test under Rule 403, SCRE.&nbsp;\r\nWhile evidence may be excluded under the Rape Shield Statute if the &quot;inflammatory or prejudicial nature&quot; outweighs the probative value, evidence may\r\nbe excluded under Rule 403 only if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value.\r\n[3] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-25-65(A) (2003). &nbsp;\r\n[4] Chase also argues that the fact that the foreperson asked to be excused after hearing the victim's testimony\r\nindicates the inflammatory nature of the evidence. &nbsp;This issue was not raised to or ruled on by the trial court. &nbsp;Thus, we conclude it is not\r\npreserved for our review. &nbsp;Dunbar, 356 S.C. at 142, 587 S.E.2d at 693-94.\r\n[5] Criminal domestic violence is &quot;caus[ing] physical harm or injury to a person's own household\r\nmember.&quot;&nbsp; S.C.

A review\r\n  of the Record indicates Mack did not make a contemporaneous objection at trial and did not raise the issue of the victim's\r\n  in-court identification at any point during trial.Â  Accordingly, the issue is\r\n  not preserved for appellate review. See State\r\n    v. Johnson, 324 S.C. 38, 41, 476 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1996) (holding there\r\n  must be a contemporaneous objection that is ruled upon by the trial [court] in order\r\n  to properly preserve an issue for appellate review).Â  \r\n2. Viewing the evidence\r\n  in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence supports the trial\r\n  court's decision to deny Mack's motion for a directed verdict and submit the\r\n  case to the jury.Â  Through an in-court identification, the victim identified\r\n  Mack as the assailant who first entered the store holding a gun. Â Because\r\n  the trial court is concerned &quot;with the existence or nonexistence of\r\n  evidence, not its weight&quot; when ruling on a directed verdict motion, we\r\n  hold the trial court properly denied the motion for a directed verdict.Â  See State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006) (&quot;When\r\n  ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with\r\n  the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.&quot;).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, KONDUROS,\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-216","title":"State v.

Â We affirm[1] pursuant to rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: \r\n1. As to whether the South Carolina Code pardons Squires from the\r\n  registration requirement: State v. Taub, 336 S.C. 310, 317, 519\r\n  S.E.2d 797, 801 (Ct. App. 1999) (&quot;The\r\n  general rule of statutory construction is that a specific statute prevails over\r\n  a more general one.&quot; (citation omitted)); see also S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 23-3-430(E)-(F) (2007 &amp; Supp. 2010) (requiring re-registration as a\r\n  sex-offender where the offender's guilty plea was not &quot;reversed, overturned,\r\n  or vacated on appeal&quot; or the offender's pardon failed to specifically\r\n  state the pardon was &quot;based on a finding of not guilty&quot;).\r\n2.Â  As\r\n  to whether the registration requirement deprives Squires of the fundamental\r\n  fairness required by due process: Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 484-85, 636\r\n  S.E.2d 598, 615 (2006) (providing that the requirements of fundamental\r\n  fairness are &quot;usually\r\n  deemed to apply in a contested case or hearing which affects\r\n  an individual's property or liberty interest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;); Hendrix v.

Townsend, of Orangeburg, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: The Bank of New York (hereinafter Bank) appeals the\r\n  decision of the trial court granting respondent Mae B. Randolph's motion for\r\n  voluntary non-suit in regard to Bank's foreclosure action on property held by\r\n  Randolph as joint tenant with her brother, Robert Earl Salone.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe facts of this case are\r\n  largely undisputed.Â  In September 1997, Randolph's mother deeded the property\r\n  in question to Randolph and Salone.Â  On December 31, 2001, Salone borrowed\r\n  $25,000 from Bank's predecessor in interest[2] and executed a note in that amount, securing payment with a purported mortgage\r\n  on the entire property.Â  However, though Salone signed the mortgage, it is\r\n  acknowledged that Randolph did not execute the mortgage and her signature on\r\n  the document was forged by an unknown person at the closing.Â  It is equally\r\n  unquestionable that the closing attorney, although directed by the lending\r\n  institution's closing instructions to procure two forms of identification from\r\n  the mortgagors, obtained identification only from Salone.Â  The attorney\r\n  testified he asked Salone to attain the identification of the other party\r\n  purporting to be Randolph, but the person did not have the identification at\r\n  the time of closing.Â  The closing attorney admitted he did not follow the\r\n  lending institution's instructions in this regard, and his failure to obtain\r\n  the proper identification allowed the forgery to occur. \r\nFollowing institution of this\r\n  action against Salone and Randolph for foreclosure on the property, Randolph\r\n  answered and counterclaimed, denying that she executed the mortgage in\r\n  question, and asserting the lender negligently caused a false document\r\n  purporting to be a first lien mortgage to be placed on record with a forged\r\n  signature as a result of the failure to obtain the proper photo identification\r\n  of the person executing the loan documents.[3]Â \r\n  Randolph also asserted the actions of the lender caused a cloud to be placed\r\n  upon title to this property.\r\nRandolph testified she never\r\n  gave her brother permission to mortgage the property, and the first time she\r\n  knew anything about the mortgage was when she received notice of foreclosure\r\n  for failure to repay a mortgage.Â  Randolph further testified that the\r\n  foreclosure action had caused her to have a bad credit record, and because of\r\n  this bad credit she was unable to obtain a loan, resulting in the repossession\r\n  of her automobile.Â  She also indicated the bad credit rating had resulted in a\r\n  higher interest rate on her credit card.Â  At the time of the trial, Bank sought\r\n  a total of $49,531.82 as the amount owing on the loan.Â  Randolph stated the\r\n  value of the home was only about $45,000.Â  Randolph testified that if Bank were\r\n  allowed to foreclose on the property, she would not be in a position to outbid\r\n  Bank.\r\nAt the close of Bank's case,\r\n  Randolph moved for a directed verdict on Bank's foreclosure cause of action,\r\n  asserting the foreclosure action came about as the result of a &quot;bad&quot;\r\n  mortgage that would not have occurred had it been known that the party\r\n  executing the document was not Randolph.[4]Â Â Â \r\n  Randolph maintained, because this was a matter in equity, Bank was required to\r\n  come into the court with clean hands, and Bank should not be allowed to profit\r\n  from its own negligence and &quot;mis-doings.&quot;Â  Randolph argued she did\r\n  not obtain any of the money from the loan, yet it affected her one-half\r\n  interest in the entire property, and the foreclosure action had also ruined her\r\n  credit.Â  Bank countered that it had established the debt, the non-payment, and\r\n  a lien on a one-half interest in the property.Â  Bank asserted Randolph did not\r\n  attack the mortgage directly in her answer, but simply asserted causes of\r\n  action against Bank, and maintained that Bank had &quot;made out a prima facie\r\n  case for a mortgage foreclosure.&quot;Â  Bank therefore argued the trial judge\r\n  should order the foreclosure of Bank's lien on one-half interest in the\r\n  property.\r\nThe trial judge noted\r\n  Randolph was basically asserting Bank's negligence should estop Bank from\r\n  foreclosing on the property.Â  After consideration of Randolph's motion for\r\n  directed verdict, as well as Bank's motion for directed verdict as to\r\n  Randolph's counterclaims, the trial judge concluded Bank should be denied the\r\n  right to foreclose on the property, citing the equitable maxim that, where one\r\n  of two innocent parties must suffer, the law looks with disfavor upon that\r\n  party who, through due diligence, could have avoided the loss.Â  In so doing,\r\n  the trial judge noted Randolph was an innocent party who had no way to protect herself\r\n  from losing her half interest in the property because she did not have the\r\n  financial resources to buy out Bank if foreclosure were allowed.Â  The trial\r\n  judge further concluded, after reviewing case law on the matter, that the\r\n  knowledge of the closing attorney was imputed to the lender and therefore\r\n  knowledge of the closing attorney that closing procedures were not followed as\r\n  far as obtaining proper identification would be imputed to Bank.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the trial judge stated, by the time the lender received the closing papers, it\r\n  would have known the identification procedure had not been followed, and thus\r\n  it was on notice of this fact.\r\nUpon hearing the trial\r\n  judge's inclined ruling, Bank argued that such a finding would leave Randolph\r\n  in the position of being a co-tenant with Salone, that at any point in time\r\n  Salone could convey his one-half interest in the property to a third party, and\r\n  Randolph would then find herself in the same position as she would if\r\n  foreclosure were ordered and Bank became her co-tenant.Â  Because a co-tenant\r\n  can file an action for partition for which there is no defense, Bank argued it\r\n  was simply a matter of choosing a co-tenant, and there was no &quot;distinction\r\n  between those co-tenants.&quot;Â  For this reason, Bank argued the equitable\r\n  doctrine cited by the trial judge was inapplicable.Â  Randolph disagreed with\r\n  Bank's assertion regarding the distinction between co-tenants arguing, without\r\n  the foreclosure, Randolph could file a partition action against Salone without\r\n  having to include Bank as a party, in which case Randolph would be in a better\r\n  position &quot;of taking care of herself and taking care of her\r\n  situation.&quot; \r\nThe trial judge acknowledged\r\n  Bank's argument regarding Randolph still being in the position of being a\r\n  co-tenant, but found the difference was that the Bank was looking to obtain\r\n  around $52,000 out of a partition action for the one-half interest, and if Bank\r\n  bid that amount, Randolph would be &quot;out in the cold,&quot; but she would\r\n  not have to face that risk if she filed a partition action without the lien of\r\n  Bank.Â  Thereafter, the trial judge issued his written order granting Randolph's\r\n  motion for voluntary non-suit in regard to Bank's foreclosure action, again\r\n  relying on the equitable maxim that the loss should fall on the party who, with\r\n  due diligence, could have avoided the loss.[5]Â \r\n  The trial judge further noted in his written order that he was granting\r\n  Randolph's motion for involuntary non-suit in regard to the mortgage\r\n  foreclosure relief sought by Bank &quot;for the reasons I announced in court. .\r\n  . .&quot; \r\nBank filed a Rule 59(e) SCRCP\r\n  motion to alter or amend the judgment, asserting Bank should be allowed to\r\n  enforce its mortgage against Salone's interest in the property, arguing\r\n  Randolph was in no better position by virtue of the court's order because she\r\n  remained a co-tenant of the property with Salone, who could bring an action to\r\n  partition the property at any time.Â  The trial judge dismissed Bank's 59(e)\r\n  motion in a form order.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUE\r\nWhether the trial judge erred\r\n  in denying Bank its foreclosure remedy because there was no dispute that the\r\n  co-tenant to the subject property who signed the mortgage was in default and\r\n  the other co-tenant, who was a party to the action and who did not sign the\r\n  mortgage, failed to plead or prove any defense, either legal or equitable, to\r\n  Bank's foreclosure action.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBank contends the trial judge\r\n  erred in denying its foreclosure of the subject property because Randolph\r\n  failed to plead or prove any defense to the foreclosure action.Â  It argues the\r\n  trial judge's reliance on the equitable maxim - that where one of two innocent\r\n  parties must suffer, the law looks with disfavor upon that party who, through\r\n  due diligence, could have avoided the loss - was improper because Randolph's\r\n  one-half undivided interest in the property would remain free and clear of the\r\n  mortgage lien, and therefore Randolph would suffer no loss, as only Salone's\r\n  interest in the property was encumbered by the mortgage and subject to Bank's\r\n  foreclosure remedy.Â  Bank contends, by disallowing the foreclosure, Randolph\r\n  remained a co-tenant with Salone, and Salone could bring an action for\r\n  partition.Â  Thus, Randolph was in no better position than being a co-tenant\r\n  with Bank, and the decision only precluded Bank from obtaining its rightful\r\n  foreclosure on Salone's mortgage.Â  Additionally, Bank contends the trial judge\r\n  &quot;ruled as [he] did without any issue in the case being raised in the\r\n  pleading or proof to the effect that the Bank's mortgage encumbering Salone's\r\n  interest in the property should not be enforced.&quot;\r\nRandolph argues that she\r\n  presented evidence that the mortgage was procured through fraud, she was an\r\n  innocent victim of the fraud, the loan would not have been consummated without\r\n  the fraud, and she suffered harm as a result of the fraudulent mortgage.Â \r\n  Randolph counters Bank's argument that she would suffer no loss if Bank were\r\n  allowed to foreclose on Salone's interest is without merit because, as noted by\r\n  the trial judge, Randolph would be placed in the untenable position of being\r\n  forced to outbid Bank or purchase Bank's interest, neither of which she had the\r\n  financial resources to do.Â  Accordingly, she argues the trial judge correctly\r\n  determined she would suffer the greater harm if the foreclosure were allowed.\r\nFirst, Bank's assertion that\r\n  the trial judge erred in denying its foreclosure remedy because Randolph failed\r\n  to plead any equitable or legal defense is not properly before the court.Â  At\r\n  no time did Bank argue to the trial judge that the equitable maxim he applied\r\n  to deny the Bank foreclosure was unavailable because Randolph failed to plead\r\n  the matter.[6]Â \r\n  Because this matter was not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge, it is\r\n  not preserved for review.Â  See S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. First\r\n    Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301-02, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007)\r\n  (holding, to be preserved for appellate review, an issue must have been:Â  (1)\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, (2) raised by the appellant, (3)\r\n  raised in a timely manner, and (4) raised to the trial court with sufficient\r\n  specificity); see also Â I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant,\r\n  338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (stating imposing preservation\r\n  requirements on the appellant is meant to enable the lower court to rule properly\r\n  after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments, and noting that\r\n  the purpose of an appeal is to determine whether the trial court erroneously\r\n  acted or failed to act, and when appellant's contentions are not presented or\r\n  passed upon by the trial court, such contentions will not be considered on\r\n  appeal).Â  See also Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Coffey, 389 S.C.\r\n  68, 74 n. 1, 698 S.E.2d 244, 247 n. 1 (Ct. App. 2010) (finding appellant's\r\n  argument on appeal, that respondent was barred from raising affirmative defense\r\n  of unclean hands, was not preserved where master did not address the procedural\r\n  issue when he ruled appellant had unclean hands, and appellant failed to raise\r\n  the matter in a Rule 59(e) motion).Â  Further, the sole argument contained in Bank's\r\n  brief regarding the lack of pleading by Randolph, other than stated in the\r\n  issue on appeal, is the single sentence that &quot;the Circuit Court ruled as\r\n  it did without any issue in the case being raised in the pleading or\r\n  proof to the effect that the Bank's mortgage encumbering Salone's interest in\r\n  the property should not be enforced.&quot; Â (emphasis added).Â  Bank summarily\r\n  argues this point and cites no law to support the proposition that Randolph was\r\n  required to specifically plead this equitable relief.Â  Therefore, this argument\r\n  can be deemed abandoned.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C.\r\n  361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting that when a party fails to cite supporting\r\n  authority or when the argument is simply a conclusory statement, the party is\r\n  deemed to have abandoned the issue on appeal).\r\nIn arguing Randolph failed to\r\n  prove any defense to the foreclosure action, Bank asserts that it had a right\r\n  to foreclose on Salone's interest, and the trial judge erred in applying the\r\n  equitable maxim because Randolph would suffer no loss since she would continue\r\n  to hold a one-half undivided interest in the property.Â  Bank argues the trial\r\n  judge's concern that Bank could outbid Randolph if the foreclosure were allowed\r\n  is misplaced because nothing in the law would preclude Salone from pursuing a\r\n  partition action as co-tenant.\r\nIt is true that, by law, Bank\r\n  would hold a lien on Salone's one-half undivided interest in the property.Â  See 20 Am. Jur. 2d Cotenancy and Joint Ownership Â§\r\n  102 (2005) (&quot;[A] mortgageÂ  . . . executed by less than all of the\r\n  cotenants and purporting to bind the entire estate is a mere nullity insofar as\r\n  the nonassenting cotenants are concerned, unless they authorized such action or\r\n  thereafter ratified it.Â  An encumbrance purportedly placed on the whole\r\n  property is valid as to the cotenant who executed it, and will be held good as\r\n  to the part allotted to that cotenant in any subsequent partition.&quot;); 6\r\n  S.C. Juris. CotenanciesÂ§ 6 (1991) (&quot;The interest of a\r\n  tenant in common is freely alienable by either inter vivos conveyance, devise,\r\n  or descent and is subject to the claims of creditors.&quot;); 6 S.C. Juris. CotenanciesÂ§ 41 (1991) (&quot;[O]ne\r\n  cotenant cannot mortgage the entire common property without the consent of the\r\n  other cotenants.Â  The effect of a mortgage that purports to convey the entire\r\n  interest and which is executed by fewer than all the cotenants results in a\r\n  lien on the interest of the mortgaging cotenants only.&quot;)Â  However, the\r\n  question is not whether Bank had a legal right to seek foreclosure on Salone's\r\n  one-half interest, but whether the trial judge erred in applying the equitable\r\n  maxim to bar Bank's remedy of foreclosure.Â  Here, the only basis Bank argued to\r\n  the trial judge as to why the equitable maxim should not apply was that\r\n  Randolph would be in no different position if the Bank were her co-tenant as\r\n  opposed to Salone, who could convey his one-half interest to a third party at\r\n  any time in the future.Â  The trial judge agreed with Randolph's attorney that\r\n  Randolph would be in a worse position if the foreclosure were allowed, because\r\n  Randolph would be in a better position to hold onto the property if she brought\r\n  a partition action against Salone, as opposed to trying to outbid the Bank with\r\n  its financial resources and motive to recoup a sum of money greater than the\r\n  value of the property.Â  Right or wrong, Bank did not argue against this finding\r\n  of harm to Randolph by the trial judge.Â  Further, while Bank acknowledges in its\r\n  brief that the trial judge expressed legitimate concern that Bank would be the\r\n  successful bidder at a foreclosure action, it does not argue against the trial\r\n  judge's determination that this would amount to harm to Randolph, leaving her\r\n  &quot;out in the cold&quot; in regard to the family property.Â  \r\nThus, the only argument Bank\r\n  raised below as to why the equitable maxim should not apply was that Randolph\r\n  was in the same position whether her co-tenant was Salone or Bank.Â  When the\r\n  trial judge disagreed and found Randolph would face more risk in losing the\r\n  family property if he allowed the foreclosure, Bank did not argue against this\r\n  determination to the trial judge. Â Further, although Bank acknowledges on\r\n  appeal the trial court was concerned that Bank would be the successful bidder\r\n  at a foreclosure of the property, it does not address on appeal the trial\r\n  judge's finding that Bank's argument before him failed because there was a\r\n  distinction between Bank and Salone as co-tenants, and that Randolph would be\r\n  in a worse position with Bank as a co-tenant.Â  Because Bank does not challenge\r\n  the trial judge's finding that Randolph would be in a worse position by having\r\n  Bank as her co-tenant, the trial judge's ruling that Randolph would be harmed\r\n  more if Bank were allowed to foreclose is the law of the case.Â  See Lucas\r\n    v. Rawl Family Ltd. P'ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004)\r\n  (finding an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).\r\nAdditionally, we note our\r\n  courts have found it appropriate to bar a bank from seeking foreclosure on a\r\n  mortgage where a party successfully asserts an equitable doctrine to preclude\r\n  the foreclosure.Â  See Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Coffey, 389 S.C. 68,\r\n  74-76, 698 S.E.2d 244, 247-48 (Ct. App. 2010) (holding the master properly\r\n  granted Mrs. Coffey's motion for summary judgment in Wachovia's foreclosure\r\n  action based on her assertion that the equitable doctrine of unclean hands\r\n  barred Wachovia from seeking equitable relief where Wachovia's employees\r\n  processed the home equity loan to Mrs. Coffey's husband without the supervision\r\n  of an attorney and therefore committed the unauthorized practice of law).Â \r\n  Further, our courts have long followed the equitable doctrine relied upon by\r\n  the trial judge here that where one of two innocent parties must suffer, the\r\n  law looks with disfavor upon that party who, through due diligence, could have\r\n  avoided the loss.Â  See Myrtle Beach Lumber Co. v.

Dep't of Transp. 372 S C. 295, 302-03, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007) (noting that a party need not use the exact name of a\r\n  legal doctrine in order to preserve an argument, but it must be clear that the\r\n  argument has been presented on that ground).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-220","title":"State v.

Elliott and Assistant Attorney\r\n        General J. Emory Smith, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In 1964 Jack Griffith[1] bought a parcel of coastal property that includes land below the mean\r\nhigh water mark and highland above it.&nbsp; In 1975, our supreme court determined the State of South Carolina owned the land below the mean high water\r\nmark.&nbsp; State v. Griffith, 265 S.C. 43, 46-48, 216 S.E.2d 765, 766-67 (1975).&nbsp; In 2004, this court determined that the State also owned the\r\nhighland because it was not in Griffith's chain of title and the land existed only as a result of man-made changes.&nbsp; Greene v. Griffith, Op. No.\r\n2004-UP-056 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 29, 2004).&nbsp; In September 2003, after the circuit court issued its order in Greene, but before this court's\r\nopinion affirming it, Southard sent Griffith a letter expressing his interest in buying the land.&nbsp; Griffith told Southard the property was in\r\nlitigation.&nbsp; Griffith later told Southard he lost the case on appeal, after which, Southard sent him a letter asking to buy the property.&nbsp; At\r\nSouthard's insistence, Griffith sold him the land for $50,000 on January 25, 2005.&nbsp; Griffith's wife testified that &quot;Dr. Southard thought that he could\r\nget [title] cleared.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nSouthard and his lawyer had the Griffith and Greene opinions before the closing.[2]&nbsp; Southard\r\nrequested that Griffith include language in the deed excluding Griffith's liability for claims of the State.&nbsp; Southard also asked his lawyer to &quot;draw\r\nup&quot; an affidavit for Griffith which stated that &quot;as to the highland and title to said property has never been disputed or questioned to the knowledge\r\nof the undersigned, except that the State claims superior title to marshland.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nOn June 7, 2006, the State filed suit against Griffith and Southard alleging the deed was void and fraudulent, seeking to eject Southard, and requesting that\r\nthe court confirm its title to the highland.&nbsp; Southard filed a counterclaim against the State seeking to quiet title to the highland or, alternatively,\r\nalleging an unconstitutional taking.&nbsp; One of the State's defenses to the counterclaim was the res judicata effect of Greene.&nbsp; The State made a\r\nmotion for summary judgment against Southard as to the void deed and ejectment causes of action, and as to Southard's counterclaim.&nbsp; The circuit court\r\ngranted the motion.&nbsp; The court denied Southard's motion to alter or amend the judgment.&nbsp;\r\nSouthard appeals arguing a soils report he obtained in 2008 is newly discovered evidence which establishes the highland is natural and not man-made, and\r\nmakes this court's conclusion in Greene incorrect.&nbsp; He alleges this is evidence of fraud upon the court under Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP.&nbsp; He also\r\nargues he did not have actual or constructive notice of the State's claim to title as established in Greene.\r\nWe affirm[3] pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n(1) As to whether Southard is bound by this court's decision in Greene: Venture Eng'g, Inc. v.

Gunter, 294 S.C. 525, 528, 366\r\nS.E.2d 44, 46 (Ct. App. 1988) (&quot;The doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel do not bar collateral attack of a judgment based on fraud.&quot;); but\r\nsee Perry v.

Hines, both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: Â The\r\n  plaintiff filed this lawsuit against Selective Insurance Company in three\r\n  separate capacities alleging the violation of three distinct duties in five\r\n  different causes of action.Â  We agree with the circuit court that none of them\r\n  are actionable in this case as a matter of law.Â  We affirm the circuit court's\r\n  order granting the motion to dismiss.\r\nI.&nbsp; Facts and Procedural History\r\nBennett Hartsel (&quot;Bennett&quot;)\r\n  and Brett Jones (&quot;Jones&quot;) were tragically killed in a one-car\r\n  accident.Â  The families were uncertain initially as to which of the young men\r\n  was driving, and each estate filed a lawsuit against the other for wrongful\r\n  death and survival.Â  The car was insured by Selective Insurance Company. Â Selective\r\n  hired an engineer who concluded that Jones was driving.Â  Selective settled the lawsuit\r\n  by Jones' estate against Bennett's estate (&quot;the Jones action&quot;) for\r\n  $185,000.00.Â  The parties reached a high/low settlement agreement[1] on Bennett's estate's claim against Jones' estate (&quot;Bennett's action&quot;),\r\n  and the case proceeded to trial.Â  The jury returned a verdict for $50,000.00.Â  \r\nBennett's father Norman\r\n  C. Hartsel (&quot;Norman&quot;) filed this lawsuit against Selective (&quot;the\r\n  Selective action&quot;) in three capacities: (1) as personal representative of\r\n  Bennett's estate, (2) as personal representative of the estate of Mary E.\r\n  Hartsel, who died after the accident for unrelated reasons, and (3) in his\r\n  individual capacity.Â  Norman filed an amended complaint in which he alleged the\r\n  violation of the duty to defend, the duty to indemnify and the duty of good\r\n  faith and fair dealing in causes of action for breach of contract, breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty, bad faith, improper claims practices, and negligence.Â  \r\nII. Analysis\r\nThe duties of an\r\n  insurance company arising out of a liability policy in any particular situation\r\n  are governed primarily by two factors: (1) the nature of the underlying\r\n  litigation, and (2) the identity of the parties to the insurance contract.Â  We\r\n  discuss each of those as a backdrop for our conclusion as a matter of law that\r\n  Selective cannot be liable to Norman in any of the capacities in which he\r\n  brought this lawsuit on any of the theories of recovery asserted.\r\na.&nbsp; The Nature of the Underlying Litigation\r\nWe first discuss the\r\n  Jones action.Â  Jones alleged that Bennett was the driver of the car, and that Bennett's\r\n  negligence caused damages associated with the death of Jones.Â  Because\r\n  Selective insured the car, Bennett's estate is insured under the policy.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(7) (2002) (&quot;Insured&quot; includes &quot;any\r\n  person who uses with the consent, expressed or implied, of the named insured\r\n  the motor vehicle to which the policy applies . . . or the personal\r\n  representative . . . .&quot;).Â  Selective therefore had a duty to defend\r\n  Bennett's estate, and a duty to indemnify Bennett's estate for any judgment\r\n  Jones' estate may obtain up to the limits of liability set forth in the\r\n  policy.Â  Sloan Const. Co. v. Central Nat. Ins. Co. of Omaha, 269 S.C.\r\n  183, 186, 236 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1977) (recognizing duty to defend and duty\r\n  indemnify as &quot;two insuring provisions of major significance&quot;); Nationwide\r\n    Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tate, 313 S.C. 444, 447, 438 S.E.2d 266, 268 (Ct. App.\r\n  1993) (recognizing duty to defend and indemnify). Â Norman was the personal\r\n  representative of Bennett's estate.Â  Therefore, Selective's two duties in the\r\n  Jones action were owed to Norman in his capacity as personal representative of\r\n  Bennett's estate.Â  \r\nNo other person or entity\r\n  connected with the Selective action stood to gain or to lose in the Jones\r\n  action.Â  From Norman's standpoint, the only way in which he could be affected\r\n  by the Jones action was in his capacity defending the Jones action as personal\r\n  representative of Bennett's estate.Â  Mary was even farther removed from the\r\n  Jones action.Â  Neither Norman nor Mary could ever be called upon to pay any\r\n  judgment imposed on Bennett's estate as a result of the Jones action.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the only duties owed by Selective arising out of the Jones action were the duty\r\n  to defend and to indemnify Bennett's estate, acting through Norman as its\r\n  personal representative.\r\nIn Bennett's action,\r\n  Bennett alleged Jones was the driver, and his negligence caused damages\r\n  associated with Bennett's death.Â  Selective insured the car, and Jones was a\r\n  permissive driver.Â  Therefore, Selective owed a duty to defend Jones' estate\r\n  and to indemnify it for any judgment Bennett's estate may obtain up to the\r\n  policy limits.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(7).Â  Just as above, no\r\n  other person connected with Bennett's action stood to gain or to lose in\r\n  Bennett's action.Â  While Norman and Mary are wrongful death beneficiaries[2] and beneficiaries of Bennett's estate, and in those capacities might stand to\r\n  gain indirectly from a favorable outcome of Bennett's action, the actual right\r\n  to recover in those actions belongs exclusively to the personal representative,\r\n  not to Norman and Mary. Â See Hopkins v. Fidelity Ins. Co., 240\r\n  S.C. 230, 233, 125 S.E.2d 468, 469 (1962) (holding for wrongful death or\r\n  survival, a parent's &quot;entitlement to compensation\r\n  was not in her own right, but as beneficiary of the statutory cause of action&quot;);\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-90 (2005) (&quot;Causes of action for and in respect to .\r\n  . . any and all injuries to the person . . . shall survive both to and against\r\n  the personal or real representative . . . of a deceased person . . . any law or\r\n  rule to the contrary notwithstanding.&quot;).Â Â  Therefore, neither\r\n  Norman nor Mary had any stake in Bennett's action except in their deriviative\r\n  capacities as beneficiaries under the wrongful death statute and as\r\n  beneficiaries of Bennett's estate.\r\nIn summary, as to both\r\n  the Jones action and Bennett's action, the only person or entity involved in the\r\n  Selective action who stood to gain or lose was Norman, but only in his capacity\r\n  as personal representative of Bennett's estate.\r\n\r\nb.&nbsp; The Parties to the Insurance Contract\r\nThe insurance policy\r\n  lists four named insureds: (1) Reserve Associates Limited, (2) CB Reserve\r\n  Homeowners Association, (3) Mary E. Hartsel, and (4) Norman C. Hartsel, LPA.Â  Reserve\r\n  Associates Limited and CB Reserve Homeowners Association are apparently\r\n  entirely unrelated to the Jones and Bennett actions, and the record contains no\r\n  information about them.Â  \r\nMary is a party to the\r\n  insurance contract.Â  Selective owed her duties arising out of the contract,\r\n  including the duty of good faith and fair dealing.Â  Doe v. South Carolina\r\n    Med. Mal. Liab. Joint Underwriting Assoc., 347 S.C. 642, 649, 557 S.E.2d\r\n  670, 674 (2001) (&quot;there is an implied covenant of good faith and fair\r\n  dealing in every insurance contract 'that neither party will do anything to\r\n  impair the other's rights to receive benefits under the contract'&quot;); Tadlock\r\n    Painting Co. v. Maryland Cas. Co., 322 S.C. 498, 501, 473 S.E.2d 52, 54\r\n  (1996) (&quot;Implicit . . . is the extension of a duty of good faith and fair\r\n  dealing in the performance of all obligations undertaken by the insurer\r\n  for the insured.&quot;).Â  As explained above, however, Mary does not\r\n  stand to gain or lose in respect to either the Jones action or Bennett's\r\n  action, and thus Selective had no occasion to act upon its duties to her.Â \r\n  Because Selective had no duty to Mary in connection with either the Jones\r\n  action or Bennett's action, Selective cannot be liable to Norman acting as her\r\n  personal representative.Â  Â \r\nNorman C. Hartsell, LPA,\r\n  (&quot;the LPA&quot;) is also a party to the insurance contract.Â  However, the\r\n  LPA is even farther removed from the Jones action and Bennett's action than\r\n  Mary.Â  The LPA does not have any interest whatsoever, not even a derivative\r\n  interest, in either of the underlying lawsuits.Â  Because the LPA has no\r\n  personal interest in the lawsuit, it has no claim for a violation of any duty\r\n  Selective owed arising out of the lawsuit.Â  \r\nNorman in his individual\r\n  capacity claims that he is party to the insurance contract.Â  While the policy\r\n  provides that members and partners of corporate named insureds such as the LPA\r\n  are also insureds, that provision applies &quot;only with respect to the conduct\r\n  of your business.&quot; Â The Amended Complaint does not allege any connection\r\n  between the accident and the conduct of the LPA's business, nor is there any\r\n  allegation that Norman is conducting business in his capacity as personal\r\n  representative of his son's estate.Â  Therefore, Norman is not a party to the\r\n  insurance contract in connection with the Selective action.Â  \r\nc.&nbsp; Summary of the Parties\r\nNone of the parties to\r\n  the Selective policy have any involvement in either of the underlying lawsuits,\r\n  and none of the participants in the underlying lawsuits have any relationship\r\n  to the Selective policy.Â  Therefore, as explained below, there can be no\r\n  liability by Selective to Norman for any of the theories of recovery asserted\r\n  in this litigation.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Breach of Contract\r\nBecause Norman is not a party to the insurance contract in his\r\n  capacity as personal representative of Bennett's estate or in his individual\r\n  capacity in connection with the underlying lawsuits, he has no claim for breach\r\n  of contract in those capacities.Â  In his capacity as personal representative of\r\n  Mary's estate, he does represent a party to the contract.Â  However, Mary has no\r\n  individual interest in the Jones action or Bennett's action.Â  Therefore she has\r\n  no claim for breach of contract.Â  The circuit court was correct to dismiss the\r\n  breach of contract cause of action.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\nThe amended complaint\r\n  alleges the existence of a fiduciary duty under the insurance contract.Â \r\n  However, an insurance relationship does not ordinarily give rise to a fiduciary\r\n  duty.Â  Pitts v. Jackson Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 352 S.C. 319, 331, 574\r\n  S.E.2d 502, 508 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Other than the conclusory allegation that\r\n  Selective &quot;was in a superior position with superior knowledge&quot; and\r\n  the plaintiffs &quot;were at all times in a position to rely on the insurance\r\n  contracts,&quot; the plaintiffs do not allege any special circumstances which\r\n  might give rise to a fiduciary duty.Â  See Pitts, 352 S.C. at\r\n  330-33, 574 S.E.2d at 507-09 (court examined the relationship to determine\r\n  whether special circumstances existed to support the allegation of a fiduciary\r\n  duty).Â  Because no fiduciary duty existed between any of the parties, the\r\n  circuit court was correct to dismiss the breach of fiduciary cause of action.Â  \r\nV.&nbsp; Bad Faith\r\nAn insurance company's\r\n  duty of good faith arises out of the insurance contract.Â  Under the Tyger\r\n    River doctrine, the insurance company owes a duty of good faith to satisfy\r\n  its duties to defend and indemnify within policy limits.Â  Tyger River Pine\r\n    Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 170 S.C. 286, 170 S.E. 346, 348 (1933) (cause\r\n  of action recognized for bad faith failure to pay benefits to the insured).Â \r\n  Only a policy holder may bring a cause of action for bad faith refusal to pay\r\n  benefits under an insurance policy.Â  See Kleckley v. Northwestern Nat'l\r\n    Cas. Co., 338 S.C. 131, 134, 526 S.E.2d 218, 219 (2000) (&quot;A tort\r\n  action for an insurer's bad faith refusal to pay benefits does not extend to\r\n  third parties who are not named insureds.&quot;); Cock-n-Bull Steak House,\r\n    Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 6, 466 S.E.2d 727, 730 (1996)\r\n  (&quot;The elements of an action for bad faith refusal to pay benefits under an\r\n  insurance contract include (1) the existence of a mutually binding contract of\r\n  insurance between the plaintiff and the defendant . . . .&quot;). Â Even when\r\n  the supreme court extended the bad faith doctrine to claims by &quot;an insured against his or her insurer for consequential\r\n  damages allegedly suffered because of the insurer's bad faith handling of third\r\n  party claims,&quot; the court stressed the duty of good faith is grounded in\r\n  the insurance contract.Â  Tadlock Painting, 322 S.C. at 504, 473 S.E.2d at\r\n  55 (1996) (&quot;[T]he insured also is entitled to receive the additional\r\n  security of knowing that she will be dealt with fairly and in good faith.Â  That\r\n  security comes not from the express contractual terms, but from the implied\r\n  covenant of good faith and fair dealing.&quot;Â  322 S.C. at 502, 473\r\n  S.E.2d at 54 (quoting Deese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\r\n  838 P.2d 1265, 1269 (Ariz. 1992) (emphasis omitted))). Â \r\nIf the plaintiff in a bad\r\n  faith action is not a party to the insurance contract, there can be no action\r\n  for bad faith.Â  Because Norman is not a party to the insurance contract, Selective\r\n  does not owe him a duty of good faith. Â He cannot recover as a matter of law.Â  Mary\r\n  is a party to the contract, and for that reason Selective does owe her a duty\r\n  of good faith.Â  However, because Mary had no interest in the Jones action or\r\n  Bennett's action, the duty of good faith was not implicated.Â  Â Â \r\nNorman argues in his\r\n  brief that &quot;this is a case of first impression under S.C. law.&quot;Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  The absolute prerequisite to an action for bad faith is the\r\n  existence of a duty of good faith.Â  As that duty arises only pursuant to an\r\n  insurance contract, a non-party to a contract will never be allowed to assert a\r\n  claim for bad faith.Â  The circuit court was correct to dismiss the bad faith\r\n  cause of action.\r\nVI.&nbsp; Improper Claims Practices\r\n&quot;Third parties do\r\n  not have a private right of action [for improper claims practices.]&quot;Â  Master\r\n    Clean, Inc. v. Star Ins. Co., 347 S.C. 405, 415, 556 S.E.2d 371, 377\r\n  (2001).Â  Mary is the only plaintiff who is party to the insurance contract.Â  Because\r\n  Mary does not have any interest in either of the underlying lawsuits, nor any\r\n  potential liability, she also does not have a claim for improper claims\r\n  practices.Â  The circuit court was correct to dismiss the improper claims\r\n  practices cause of action.\r\nVII.  Negligence\r\nNorman cannot recover\r\n  from Selective for negligence in any of the capacities in which he sues.Â  An\r\n  insurance company owes no duty of due care to a non-insured making a claim\r\n  against the insurer.Â  See Kleckley v. Northwestern Nat'l Cas. Co.,\r\n  330 S.C. 277, 286, 498 S.E.2d 669, 674 (Ct. App. 1998) (&quot;[t]he duty of the\r\n  insurance company to use ordinary care . . . arises out of the . . . contract or\r\n  policy of insurance . . . .&quot;).Â  Further, no right of recovery exists in\r\n  negligence by an insured. Â Kennedy v. Henderson, 289 S.C. 393, 397, 346\r\n  S.E.2d 526, 528 (1986) (&quot;[n]o cause of action exists against an insurer\r\n  for negligence in failing to determine coverage or adjust a third party claim\r\n  against the insured under an insurance policy.&quot;).Â  Because Selective owes\r\n  no duty of due care to Norman in any of the capacities in which he sued, the circuit\r\n  court was correct to dismiss the negligence cause of action.\r\nVIII. Conclusion\r\nThe circuit court was\r\n  correct to dismiss the complaint because it failed to state any cause of\r\n  action.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\nGEATHERS, J., concurs\r\n  in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The high/low settlement agreement provided that\r\n  Selective would pay on behalf of the Jones estate to the Hartsel estate a\r\n  minimum of $200,000.00 and a maximum of $1,000,000.00.\r\n[2] S.C.

Dulaney (Father), appeals the decision of the family court ordering\r\n  Father to reimburse Melissa Dulaney (Mother) $27,720 for two years of tuition\r\n  at a private school incurred for their child's education.Â  Father asserts (1)\r\n  the family court erred in allowing Mother to orally amend her rule to show\r\n  cause to seek reimbursement of tuition for both the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007\r\n  school years; (2) the family court erred in finding Father owed Mother back\r\n  tuition, because Father provided substantial evidence the parties had reached an\r\n  agreement otherwise and Father presented substantial evidence the elements of\r\n  equitable estoppel applied; (3) the family court erred in finding the parties'\r\n  e-mails indicated an agreement Father would reimburse Mother for the contested\r\n  tuition payments at a later date because there was no language in the e-mails\r\n  to support such a finding; (4) the family court erred in refusing to reopen the\r\n  case to take further testimony on the issue of Mother's credibility where\r\n  Mother's credibility was critical to Father's arguments regarding his equitable\r\n  estoppel defense and her requested oral amendment, and the court limited Father's\r\n  cross examination of Mother and prohibited cross-examination of Mother's\r\n  counsel on the issue; and (5) he is entitled to an award of fees and costs if\r\n  this court reverses the family court's determination on tuition reimbursement.Â \r\n  We affirm.\r\n1.&nbsp; We find no error in the family\r\n  court allowing Mother to orally amend her pleading.Â  It is well established\r\n  that a motion to amend is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge,\r\n  and that the party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing\r\n  prejudice.Â  Hardaway Concrete Co. v. Hall Contracting Corp., 374 S.C.\r\n  216, 227, 647 S.E.2d 488, 493-94 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Courts have wide latitude in\r\n  allowing amendment of pleadings.Â  Berry v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 450,\r\n  492 S.E.2d 794, 802 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  While this power should not be used\r\n  indiscriminately or to prejudice or surprise another party, the court's\r\n  decision to allow an amendment is within its sound discretion, and will rarely\r\n  be disturbed on appeal.Â  Id.Â  In considering potential prejudice to the\r\n  opposing party, the court should consider whether that party has had the opportunity\r\n  to prepare for the issue now being formally raised.Â  Armstrong v. Collins,\r\n  366 S.C. 204, 230, 621 S.E.2d 368, 381 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Here, it is clear that\r\n  Father continued to present this equitable estoppel argument to the court in\r\n  regard to both years, and he presented the same evidence in support of this\r\n  argument on the 2005-2006 school year's tuition as he did on the 2006-2007\r\n  school year.Â  Further, Father does not suggest any additional evidence he could\r\n  have presented but was prevented from presenting by reason of the amendment at\r\n  trial.Â  Accordingly, we find Father failed to establish prejudice.\r\n2.&nbsp; We find no merit to Father's\r\n  assertion that the family court erred in determining he owed Mother back\r\n  tuition because he proved his equitable estoppel defense.Â  In appeals from the\r\n  family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance\r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Dickert v. Dickert,\r\n  387 S.C. 1, 5-6, 691 S.E.2d 448, 450 (2010).Â  However, this broad scope of\r\n  review does not require the reviewing court to disregard the findings of the\r\n  family court, as appellate courts should be mindful that the family court, who\r\n  saw and heard the witnesses, sits in a better position to evaluate credibility\r\n  and assign comparative weight to the testimony.Â  Id. at 6, 691 S.E.2d at\r\n  450.Â  In Strickland v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 650 S.E.2d 465 (2007),\r\n  the court stated the following essential elements of equitable estoppel as\r\n  related to the party being estopped: Â (1) conduct which amounts to a false\r\n  representation, or conduct which is calculated to convey the impression that\r\n  the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party\r\n  subsequently attempts to assert; (2) the intention that such conduct shall be\r\n  acted upon by the other party; and (3) actual or constructive knowledge of the\r\n  real facts; and provided as to the party asserting estoppel it is necessary to\r\n  show:Â  (1) lack of knowledge, and the means of knowledge, of the truth as to\r\n  the facts in question; (2) reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped; and\r\n  (3) a prejudicial change of position in reliance on the conduct of the party\r\n  being estopped.Â  Id. at 84-85, 650 S.E.2d at 470.Â  The court further\r\n  noted equitable estoppel is based on affirmative conduct between the parties.Â  Id. at 85, 650 S.E.2d at 470.Â  In looking at the affirmative conduct between the\r\n  parties, the record shows that Mother specifically testified she and Father had\r\n  a financial arrangement for his payment of the tuition, and though they had\r\n  discussed that it would be difficult for him to make the payments when Father\r\n  started law school, that she had communicated with Father in an effort to have\r\n  him pay the tuition, and that Mother informed Father that she understood for\r\n  his first year in law school he &quot;needed to get his feet on the ground,&quot;\r\n  but she still expected him to catch up on the payments in the future.Â  We find\r\n  the issue of credibility was properly considered by the family court, and the\r\n  court's order implicitly reflects a determination Mother was credible on the\r\n  issue of the parties' agreement concerning the tuition.\r\n3.&nbsp;Â In regard to Father's argument\r\n  concerning the family court's finding regarding the e-mails between the\r\n  parties, we first note, as to Father's assertion that the family court erred in\r\n  failing to correct any discrepancy between the court's instructions in its memo\r\n  and the final written order, Father failed to set forth this issue in his\r\n  Statement of the Issues on Appeal.Â  Because this\r\n  issue was not included in Father's Statement of the Issues on Appeal, we need\r\n  not address this argument on the merits. See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (&quot;Ordinarily,\r\n  no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.&quot;).Â  Moreover, this argument advanced in Father's brief\r\n  makes no reference to any supporting authority.Â  See Bryson v. Bryson,\r\n  378 S.C. 502, 510, 662 S.E.2d 611, 615 (Ct. App. 2008) (&quot;An issue is deemed abandoned and will not be\r\n  considered on appeal if the argument is raised in a brief but not supported by\r\n  authority.&quot;); see also Glasscock, Inc. v.\r\n    U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001) (&quot;[S]hort, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for review.&quot;)Â  At any rate,\r\n  the family court declined to make this change as requested in Father's motion\r\n  to amend.Â  Thus, it is clear that the court found the final written order\r\n  properly set forth the court's finding in this regard.Â  See Doe v.\r\n    Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 501, 478 S.E.2d 854, 859 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding judgments are not final until written and entered, and until\r\n  written and entered, the judge retains discretion to change his mind and amend\r\n  his ruling accordingly).Â  As to Father's argument that the family court\r\n  erred in finding the e-mails between the parties indicated an agreement that\r\n  Father would reimburse Mother the contested tuition payments at a later date,\r\n  we note a clear reading of the order shows the family\r\n  court found the e-mails between the parties indicate only there may have been an agreement that the parties intended the Father pay the tuition\r\n  later.Â  Further, the e-mails, together with Mother's testimony that she\r\n  informed Father she expected him to catch up with the tuition at some point in\r\n  time, support this conclusion.Â  Thus, considering the record as a whole, the\r\n  preponderance of evidence supports the family court's finding in this regard.\r\n4. We find there was no abuse of\r\n  discretion in the family court's refusal to reopen the case to take additional\r\n  testimony.Â  &quot;The decision whether to reopen a record for additional\r\n  evidence is within the trial court's sound discretion and will not be disturbed\r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.&quot; Â Brenco v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Transp., 377 S.C. 124, 127, 659 S.E.2d 167, 169 (2008).Â  It is well\r\n  established that a trial judge enjoys considerable latitude and discretion in\r\n  deciding whether to allow a party to reopen his case, and this decision will\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal unless the opposing party was prejudiced thereby.Â  Brown\r\n    v. La France Indus., 286 S.C. 319, 324-25, 333 S.E.2d 348, 351 (Ct. App.\r\n  1985).Â  A review of the record reveals Father's attorney questioned Mother\r\n  extensively regarding the change made from the amount sought in the initial\r\n  rule to show cause to the lower amount sought in the amended rule to show\r\n  cause.Â  Thus, Father's attorney was not limited from examining Mother on the\r\n  issue. At any rate, any additional testimony on the matter would have, at best,\r\n  been marginally relevant, and Father suffered no prejudice.Â  See Â Fields\r\n    v. Reg'l.Â  Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25-26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509\r\n  (2005) (holding the admission or exclusion of evidence in general is within the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial court, and reversal based on the admission or\r\n  exclusion of evidence is not warranted absent a showing of both error and\r\n  resulting prejudice).Â  See also State v. Johnson, 338 S.C.\r\n  114, 124-25, 525 S.E.2d 519, 524 (2000) (noting considerable latitude is\r\n  allowed in cross-examination to test a witness's credibility, but a trial court\r\n  may impose reasonable limits on cross-examination based upon concerns about,\r\n  among other things, harassment or interrogation that is repetitive or only\r\n  marginally relevant; an appellate court will not disturb a trial court's ruling\r\n  concerning the scope of cross-examination of a witness to test his or her\r\n  credibility absent a manifest abuse of discretion).\r\n5.&nbsp; Father contends, should this court\r\n  reverse the finding that he is required to reimburse Mother for the tuition or\r\n  that he is only responsible for the 2006-2007 tuition, the court should grant\r\n  Father all of his fees for defending the rule to show cause, or should remand\r\n  the matter back to the family court for an award of fees. Â Thus, this issue is\r\n  contingent upon this court's reversal on the award of tuition reimbursement. Â Because\r\n  we do not find the family court's decision on reimbursement of tuition should\r\n  be reversed, there is no basis to reverse or remand on the issue of attorney's\r\n  fees and costs.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons,\r\n  the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and HUFF and\r\n  PIEPER, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-228","title":"State v.

Wyman, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this\r\n  workers' compensation case, Appellant Ramone Zepeda-Cepeda (Claimant) seeks\r\n  review of a decision of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (Commission)\r\n  denying his request for temporary total disability benefits and payment of\r\n  medical expenses for an injury to his right leg.Â  Claimant challenges the\r\n  Appellate Panel's finding that his injury did not arise out of and in the\r\n  course of his employment because he was engaging in horseplay when the injury\r\n  occurred.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nIn\r\n  March 2007, Claimant began working for Priority Landscaping and Lawn Care, LLC\r\n  (Employer), located in Folly Beach.Â  Among other equipment, Employer provided\r\n  Claimant and his co-workers with a pole saw and extension ladders for\r\n  trimming tree branches.Â  If a branch was so high that it could not be reached\r\n  while using an extension ladder and a pole saw, Employer\r\n  would subcontract out that particular work to Budget Tree Service (Budget).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  September 4, 2008, Employer assigned Claimant to a crew of four to perform work\r\n  on the grounds at Fort Johnson Baptist Church.Â  The other three workers were Leonardo\r\n  Solano (Leonardo), Frank Shoppel (Frank), and Cesar Rodriguez (Cesar).Â  Frank supervised the crew, and\r\n  Cesar interpreted\r\n  Frank's English into Spanish for Claimant and Leonardo.Â  The crew arrived at\r\n  the location at approximately 12:45 p.m. and ate lunch before beginning work. \r\nAccording\r\n  to Claimant, as he\r\n  began work at the location, Cesar told him that Frank wanted him to\r\n  climb a large oak tree to trim one of its branches.Â  Claimant climbed up to a\r\n  large branch approximately twenty feet off the ground.Â  He began walking along\r\n  the branch and was expecting one of his co-workers to hand him a tool once he\r\n  was near the branch to be trimmed.Â  However, he lost his balance and fell to\r\n  the ground.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  hearing testimony of Frank and Cesar provided a different version of the events\r\n  leading up to Claimant's injury.Â  They both testified that Employer never\r\n  assigned branch trimming for those branches that could not be reached with the\r\n  pole saw and extension ladder.Â  They further testified that on the day of the injury,\r\n  Frank never asked Cesar to tell Claimant to trim any branches on\r\n  the tree in question.Â  Rather, they testified that Cesar offered Claimant a\r\n  twenty-dollar bet that he would not jump out of the oak tree from a limb hovering\r\n  twenty feet off the ground.Â  Claimant quickly accepted the bet, climbed up the\r\n  tree, and began walking out on the limb.Â  He then &quot;cradled&quot; the limb,\r\n  turned over, hung off the\r\n  branch, and deliberately dropped to the ground.Â  \r\nIt\r\n  is undisputed that Claimant landed on his feet and limped over to the truck in\r\n  which the crew rode to the location.Â  He then began to feel pain in his right\r\n  leg. Â Frank\r\n  called Employer's owner, William Hampton (Owner), to determine how to respond\r\n  to Claimant's injury. Â Frank also asked Cesar to advise Claimant that he should\r\n  tell others he stepped in a hole.Â  Employer's secretary drove Claimant to\r\n  Doctor's Care and later took him to a local hospital for further treatment.Â \r\n  The next day, Frank gave a written statement to Owner's wife.Â  In the\r\n  statement, Frank alleged that Claimant had climbed the tree without being\r\n  instructed to do so and that the tree in question was not the type of tree that\r\n  Employer would maintain.Â  Frank also stated &quot;It appears that [Claimant]\r\n  climbed the tree for fun.Â  He was injured when he jumped or fell out of the\r\n  tree.&quot;Â  \r\nClaimant sought temporary\r\n  total disability benefits as well as payment of all medical expenses related to\r\n  his leg injury.Â  Employer and its insurer, Accident Fund Insurance Company of\r\n  America (Carrier), contested the claim on the ground that Claimant had been\r\n  engaging in horseplay when he injured his right leg.Â  The Single Commissioner\r\n  found that Claimant was not engaging in horseplay and awarded Claimant the\r\n  requested benefits.Â  The Appellate Panel reversed the award, finding that\r\n  Claimant was in fact engaging in horseplay, and, therefore, his injury did not\r\n  arise out of and in the course of his employment.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed. Â \r\nISSUE ON APPEAL\r\nWas\r\n  the Appellate Panel's finding that Claimant's injury did not arise out of and\r\n  in the course of his employment supported by substantial evidence when the\r\n  testimony on which the Appellate Panel relied was purportedly not credible?[2]\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard for judicial review of\r\n  decisions by the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission.&nbsp; See Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304,\r\n  306 (1981).&nbsp; Specifically, section 1-23-380 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2010) provides that this court may not substitute its judgment for that\r\n  of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact,\r\n  but may reverse when the decision is affected by an error of law.[3]&nbsp; See Hamilton v.\r\n    Bob Bennett Ford, 336 S.C. 72, 76,\r\n  518 S.E.2d 599, 600-01&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1999), modified on other grounds,\r\n  339 S.C. 68, 528 S.E.2d 667&nbsp;(2000) (interpreting section\r\n  1-23-380).Â  Section 1-23-380 allows reversal of a factual finding of the\r\n  Appellate Panel only if it is &quot;clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n  probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.&quot;\r\n\r\n  In workers' compensation cases, the Commission\r\n    is the ultimate factfinder. Â This Court must affirm the findings of fact made\r\n    by the full commission if they are supported by substantial evidence. Â Substantial\r\n    evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering\r\n    the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the\r\n    agency reached.\r\n\r\nPierre v. Seaside Farms,\r\n  Inc., 386 S.C. 534, 540, 689 S.E.2d 615, 618&nbsp;(2010) (internal citations\r\n  and quotations marks omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nClaimant\r\n  contests the Appellate Panel's finding that his injury did not arise out of and\r\n  in the course of his employment.Â  He argues that this finding is not supported\r\n  by substantial evidence because his supervisor, Frank, and his interpreter, Cesar, who\r\n  both testified that Claimant jumped out of a tree on a bet, had no\r\n  credibility.Â  Claimant asserts that Cesar and Frank admitted in the hearing\r\n  before the Single Commissioner that they did not initially tell the truth about\r\n  how Claimant injured himself.Â  Therefore, Claimant argues, their hearing testimony\r\n  could not be believed.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  workers' compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.&quot;Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535\r\n  S.E.2d 438, 442&nbsp;(2000). Â &quot;The final determination of\r\n  witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the\r\n  Full Commission.&quot; Â Id.Â  &quot;It is not the task of this Court to\r\n  weigh the evidence as found by the Full Commission.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n\r\n  Further, the trier of fact has the prerogative to believe one part of a\r\n  witness's testimony while simultaneously disbelieving other parts of the same\r\n  witness's testimony.Â  See Holcombe v. Dan River Mills,\r\n  286 S.C. 223, 225, 333 S.E.2d 338, 340&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1985) (&quot;The Commission in workers' compensation cases sits as a jury does.\r\n  It is elementary that a jury may believe part or all of a witness's testimony[.]&quot;).Â \r\n  Therefore, Claimant's argument that the testimony of Frank and Cesar cannot\r\n  constitute substantial evidence because they admitted to previous\r\n  misrepresentations is unconvincing.Â  The Appellate Panel could have believed\r\n  the testimony of Cesar and Frank that they were afraid they would lose their jobs\r\n  if Employer learned that Claimant climbed the tree on a bet from Cesar and that\r\n  Frank allowed this to happen.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Owner's testimony supported the Appellate Panel's finding that Claimant's\r\n  injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment.Â  Owner stated\r\n  that the only time that his workers would attempt to trim a large oak tree was\r\n  when it could be done with an extension pole saw and a stepladder and when the\r\n  limb was not too big.Â  Owner also testified that his standard practice was to\r\n  subcontract out to Budget the trimming of any out-of-reach branches; and, that he\r\n  had in fact used Budget for the very property on which Claimant and his\r\n  co-workers were located on the day of the injury.Â  Â Â \r\nClaimant\r\n  also argues that the Appellate Panel made no credibility findings, and, as a\r\n  result, the Single Commissioner's finding that the testimony of Frank and Cesar\r\n  was not credible was left undisturbed.Â  Hence, Claimant asserts, this court\r\n  should give deference to the Single Commissioner's credibility determination.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  In the fifth finding of fact of the Appellate Panel's decision,\r\n  it relied on the testimony of Frank and Cesar.Â  Therefore, there is no question\r\n  that the Appellate Panel found this testimony to be credible.Â  As stated\r\n  earlier, this court is required to give deference to the Appellate Panel's\r\n  credibility determination.Â  See Shealy,\r\n  341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442 (&quot;The final\r\n  determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is\r\n  reserved to the Full Commission.&quot;).\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the evidence in the record would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  conclusion the Appellate Panel reachedâ€”that Claimant was engaging in horseplay,\r\n  and, thus, his injury was not compensable.Â  See Jones\r\n    v. Hampton Pontiac, 304 S.C. 440, 441-42, 405 S.E.2d 395, 395-96&nbsp;(1991)\r\n  (holding that an employee's demonstration of a karate kick, while on break, did not\r\n  give rise to his injury as a natural incident of the work, and, therefore, his\r\n  injury was not compensable).Â  Hence, the Appellate Panel's finding\r\n  that Claimant's injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment\r\n  was supported by substantial evidence.Â  See Pierre, 386 S.C. at 540,\r\n  689 S.E.2d at 618 (&quot;Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence\r\n    which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach\r\n    the conclusion the agency reached.&quot;) (internal citations\r\n  and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  Appellate Panel's decision isÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We\r\n  decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] A claimant's\r\n  injury must arise out of his employment and occur in the\r\n    course of his employment.Â  Beam v. State Workmen's\r\n      Compensation Fund, 261 S.C. 327, 331, 200\r\n  S.E.2d 83, 85&nbsp;(1973).Â  \r\n\r\n  The two elements must co-exist. They must be concurrent and\r\n    simultaneous. One without the other will not sustain an award; yet the two are\r\n    so entwined that they are usually considered together in the reported cases;\r\n    and a discussion of one of them involves the other. \r\n  As is generally held,\r\n    the words &quot;arising out of&quot; refer to the origin of the cause of the\r\n    accident, while the words &quot;in the course of\r\n    employment,&quot; have reference to the time, place and circumstances under\r\n    which the accident occurs.\r\n  \r\n  Douglas v. Spartan Mills,\r\n  245 S.C. 265, 268-69, 140 S.E.2d 173, 174-75&nbsp;(1965) (internal citation and\r\nquotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\n[3] The\r\n  pertinent language of section 1-23-380 is as follows: \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the\r\n    weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision\r\n    of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse\r\n    or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been\r\n    prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or\r\n    decisions are:Â  (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b)\r\n    in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c)\r\n    made upon unlawful procedure; (d)\r\n    affected by other error of law; (e)\r\n    clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\r\n    on the whole record; or (f)\r\n    arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\r\n    unwarranted exercise of discretion.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Middleton\r\n  L. Hatchell appeals his convictions for two counts of second-degree criminal\r\n  sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor, one count of lewd act upon a child, and one\r\n  count of disseminating harmful material to a minor.Â  He argues the trial court\r\n  erred in denying his motions to quash the indictments and motions for a\r\n  directed verdict.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nI. INDICTMENTS\r\nHatchell argues the trial\r\n  court erred in denying his motions to quash the indictments because the periods\r\n  stated on the indictments were too long to provide notice of the charges\r\n  against him.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo\r\n  determine whether the period alleged in the indictment provides sufficient\r\n  notice to a defendant, this court uses a two-prong test: &quot;(1) whether time\r\n  is a material element of the offense; and (2) whether the time period covered\r\n  by the indictment occurred prior to the return of the indictment by the grand\r\n  jury.&quot;Â  State v. Tumbleston, 376 S.C. 90, 98-99, 654 S.E.2d 849,\r\n  853-54 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  \r\nHere, the periods alleged in\r\n  Hatchell's indictments provided him sufficient notice to prepare an adequate\r\n  defense.Â  First, time is not a material element of the CSC, lewd act, or\r\n  dissemination offenses.Â  State v. Baker, 390 S.C. 56, 62-63, 700 S.E.2d 440,\r\n  442 (Ct. App. 2010); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-385(A)-(B) (2003) (providing\r\n  a person is guilty of disseminating harmful material to minors &quot;if,\r\n  knowing the character or content of the material, he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. allows a\r\n  minor to review or peruse material that is harmful to minors&quot; orÂ \r\n  &quot;allows a minor to view a live performance which is harmful to\r\n  minors&quot;).Â  Second, the periods alleged in the indictments occurred before\r\n  Hatchell was indicted.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly denied the\r\n  motions to quash the indictments. \r\nII.Â MOTIONS\r\n  FOR A DIRECTED VERDICT\r\nHatchell\r\n  maintains the trial court erred in denying his motions for a directed verdict\r\n  because the State's evidence amounted only to a suspicion of guilt.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n&quot;When\r\n  reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this [c]ourt views the evidence and\r\n  all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n  party.&quot;Â  State v. Brannon, 388 S.C. 498, 501, 697 S.E.2d 593, 595\r\n  (2010) (internal citations omitted).Â  &quot;[T]he [S]tate must present any\r\n  direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from\r\n  which the defendant's guilt can be fairly and logically deduced.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Muhammed, 338 S.C. 22, 26, 524 S.E.2d 637, 639 (Ct. App. 1999)\r\n  (citations omitted).\r\n&quot;A\r\n  person is guilty of [CSC] with a minor in the second degree if: (1) the actor\r\n  engages in sexual battery with a victim who is fourteen years of age or less\r\n  but who is at least eleven years of age .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(B) (Supp. 2010).Â  A person is guilty of committing a lewd act\r\n  upon a child if the person is &quot;over the age of fourteen years [and]\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. willfully and lewdly commit[s] .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a lewd or\r\n  lascivious act upon or with the body, or its parts, of a child under the age of\r\n  sixteen years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the\r\n  lust or passions or sexual desires of the person or of the child.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-140 (2003).Â  A person is guilty of disseminating harmful\r\n  material to minors &quot;if, knowing the character or content of the material,\r\n  he .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. allows a minor to review or peruse material that is harmful\r\n  to minors&quot; orÂ  &quot;allows a minor to view a live performance which is\r\n  harmful to minors.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-385(A)-(B) (2003).Â  \r\nAs to the CSC charges, the\r\n  State presented testimony Hatchell had sex with the victim multiple times while\r\n  she was between the ages of eleven and twelve.Â  Regarding the lewd act charge,\r\n  the State presented testimony Hatchell repeatedly had sex with the victim and\r\n  touched her breasts and vagina while she was between the ages of nine and\r\n  twelve.Â  For the dissemination charge, the State presented testimony Hatchell\r\n  showed a pornographic video to the victim and did not attempt to turn it off\r\n  after it began playing.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly denied the\r\n  motions for a directed verdict.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., PIEPER and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-240","title":"SCDOT v.

Michael Baxley, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2011-UP-242Â Â  \r\n  Submitted February 1, 2011 â€“ Filed May 24,\r\n  2011\r\n  Withdrawn, Substituted and Refiled June\r\n23, 2011\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\nGene M. Connell, Jr., of Surfside Beach,\r\n  for Appellant.\r\nJ.R. Murphy, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: In this insurance case from Horry County, Joshua Bell brought an action against\r\n  Progressive Direct Insurance Co. (Progressive), seeking to recover underinsured\r\n  motorist (UIM) coverage from a policy issued to his live-in girlfriend, Sarah\r\n  Serven.Â  Bell now appeals the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor\r\n  of Progressive.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  May 4, 2005, Progressive issued an automobile insurance policy covering a\r\n  vehicle owned by Serven and effective until May 4, 2006.Â  The policy listed Serven\r\n  and Bell as &quot;Drivers and household residents,&quot; but listed Serven as\r\n  the only &quot;named insured.&quot;Â  In March 2006, Bell was in an auto\r\n  accident while a passenger in a car owned by his employer.[1]Â \r\n  At the time of the accident Bell was living with Serven.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  March 2006, the couple had a child together.Â  Around this time, Bell gave\r\n  Serven a diamond ring and the two were engaged without having set a wedding date.Â \r\n  Sometime around February 2007, Serven and the child moved to Maryland and the\r\n  couple called off the engagement.Â  Shortly after Serven moved to Maryland, she\r\n  and Bell became engaged for a second time, again without setting a date.Â  While\r\n  Serven and the child lived in Maryland, Bell visited several times and planned\r\n  to move there in June 2007. Â However, around the end of May 2007, Bell made an\r\n  unannounced visit to Maryland and found Serven with another man.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  the couple permanently called off their engagement.\r\nOn\r\n  July 18, 2007, Bell brought this action, seeking UIM coverage under the Progressive\r\n  policy.Â  Progressive moved for summary judgment.Â  The trial court granted the\r\n  motion, finding (1) Bell and Serven were not common law married, and therefore,\r\n  Bell was not a named insured under the policy and (2) South Carolina courts\r\n  have not adopted the doctrine of reasonable expectations, and therefore, Bell\r\n  is not entitled to UIM coverage by virtue of being a &quot;driver or household\r\n  member.&quot;Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and\r\n  it is clear the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  &quot;Appellate courts review the grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court\r\n  . . . [granting summary judgment] where there are no genuine issues of material\r\n  fact, . . . [and viewing] the evidence and all inferences that reasonably can\r\n  be drawn [therefrom] . . . in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\r\n  party.&quot;Â  Argoe v. Three Rivers Behavioral Ctr. &amp; Psychiatric\r\n    Solutions, 388 S.C. 394, 400, 697 S.E.2d 551, 554&nbsp;(2010) (citations\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;[I]n cases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden\r\n  of proof, the non-moving party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of\r\n  evidence in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock\r\n    v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co.,&nbsp;381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801,\r\n  803&nbsp;(2009).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â Â Bell\r\n  argues the trial court erred in failing to find the policy provided him with\r\n  UIM coverage.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIf\r\n  a person's vehicle is not involved in an accident, that person may reach only\r\n  one at-home policy of which he is an insured.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002) (&quot;If none of the insured's or named insured's\r\n  vehicles is involved in the accident, coverage is available only to the extent\r\n  of coverage on any one of the vehicles with the excess or underinsured\r\n  coverage.&quot;).Â  Here, Bell is not an insured under Serven's policy.\r\nServen's\r\n  policy explicitly provides UIM for an &quot;insured person,&quot; and it\r\n  defines that term as &quot;you or a relative.&quot;Â  &quot;You&quot; is defined\r\n  under the policy as &quot;a person or persons shown as a named insured on the\r\n  Declarations Page&quot; and &quot;the spouse of a named insured if residing in\r\n  the same household.&quot;Â  &quot;Relative&quot; is defined as &quot;a person\r\n  residing in the same household as you, and related to you by blood, marriage,\r\n  or adoption .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Consequently, whether Bell is insured\r\n  by and may therefore reach Serven's policy depends upon whether he falls within\r\n  one of the defined terms, you or relative. \r\nAs\r\n  to whether Bell falls within the defined term &quot;you,&quot; Bell first\r\n  argues the use of the term &quot;household resident&quot; on the policy's\r\n  declaration page creates an ambiguity as to whether he is a named insured that\r\n  must be resolved against the insurer, Progressive.Â  We disagree.Â  &quot;The\r\n  majority view is that listing a driver on the declarations page of an insurance\r\n  policy does not make that person a named insured.&quot;Â  Ex Parte United\r\n    Servs. Auto Ass'n, 365 S.C. 50, 55, 614 S.E.2d 652, 654 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Moreover,\r\n  the policy's failure to define &quot;household resident&quot; does not by\r\n  itself make the policy ambiguous.Â  Cf. id. at 55-56, 614 S.E.2d at\r\n  654-55.Â  The policy defines &quot;you&quot; as the &quot;named insured on the\r\n  Declarations Page&quot; and &quot;the spouse of the named insured if residing\r\n  in the same household.&quot;Â  It also defines &quot;relative&quot; as &quot;a\r\n  person residing in the same household as you, and related to you by\r\n  blood, marriage, or adoption.&quot;Â  Thus, we see no ambiguity.\r\nSecond,\r\n  Bell argues the trial court erred in finding he was not Serven's spouse because\r\n  he provided sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment as to whether they\r\n  were bound in common law marriage.Â  We disagree.Â  In South\r\n  Carolina, common law marriage requires cohabitation accompanied by a present intent to be\r\n  husband and wife.Â  See Baker v. Baker, 330 S.C. 361, 367, 499\r\n  S.E.2d 503, 507 (Ct. App. 1998) (recognizing mutual understanding and intent\r\n  are essential to the existence of a common law marriage); see also Callen\r\n    v. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, 624, 624 S.E.2d 59, 62 (2005) (indicating that\r\n  cohabitation combined with holding one's self out as married, creates a\r\n  rebuttable presumption of the existence of a common law marriage).Â  In this\r\n  case, Bell failed to provide evidence he and Serven held themselves out as\r\n  married.Â  Although the couple lived together, cohabitation alone is insufficient\r\n  to create a common law marriage.Â  The evidence indicates Serven and Bell were\r\n  engaged to be married at some undetermined point in the future.Â  The only\r\n  inference to be drawn from this is that the couple did not have a present\r\n  intent to be married but instead a future intent to be married.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the second defined term, Bell maintains he was a &quot;relative&quot; under\r\n  the policy because the mother of his child was Serven, the named insured.\r\n  Again, we disagree.Â  Bell is not a relative under the policy because he is not\r\n  related to Serven by blood or marriage.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly\r\n  held Bell could not reach the UIM coverage of Serven's policy because he was not an\r\n  insured under that policy.\r\n2.Â  Bell\r\n  also urges this court to adopt the doctrine of reasonable expectations.Â  We\r\n  decline to do so.\r\n\r\n  This doctrine essentially is that the objectively\r\n    reasonable expectations of applicants and intended beneficiaries regarding the\r\n    terms of insurance contracts will be honored even though painstaking study of\r\n    the policy provisions would have negated these expectations.Â  The theory is\r\n    based upon the proposition that the construction of the language of an\r\n    insurance contract is not ordinarily controlled by the standards applicable to\r\n    a contract negotiated at arm's length between two parties on the same plane. \r\n  . . .&nbsp;.\r\n  This  view has never been accepted by the Supreme Court of this State. In South  Carolina insurance policies are subject to the general rules of contract  construction. \r\n    . . .&nbsp;.\r\n  If the intention of the parties is\r\n    clear, the Courts have no authority to change the contract in any particular\r\n    and have no power to interpolate into the agreement between the insurer and the\r\n    insured, a condition or stipulation not contemplated by the parties.Â  A reviewing\r\n    court should not rewrite or torture the meaning of policy language to achieve a\r\n    result never intended by the parties. Â \r\n\r\nAllstate\r\n  Ins. Co. v. Mangum,\r\n  299 S.C. 226, 231, 383 S.E.2d 464, 466-67&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1989) (citations and internal\r\n  quotation marks omitted).Â  \r\nBell\r\n  argues because the doctrine was not properly before the court in Mangum,\r\n  the court's statement is dicta and as a result, the court has never explicitly\r\n  rejected the doctrine.Â  See id. at 232, 383 S.E.2d at 467 (noting\r\n  that because the doctrine of reasonable expectations was not addressed by the\r\n  trial court, the issue was not properly preserved for appeal); but see United\r\n    Servs., 365 S.C. at 54, 614 S.E.2d at 654&nbsp;(stating that the doctrine\r\n  of reasonable expectations has been rejected in South Carolina).Â  Admittedly,\r\n  the court's statement in Mangum is not the law of the case; however, the\r\n  supreme court has consistently held that unambiguous insurance policies are\r\n  subject to the general rules of contract construction.Â  See, e.g., Gambrell\r\n    v. Travelers Ins. Co., 280 S.C. 69, 71, 310 S.E.2d 814, 816 (1983); see\r\n      also United Servs., 365 S.C. at 54, 614 S.E.2d at 654 (suggesting\r\n  that implementation of this rule is the equivalent of rejecting the doctrine of\r\n  reasonable expectations).Â  Therefore, even assuming for the sake of argument\r\n  that the doctrine has not been explicitly rejected, because the doctrine cannot\r\n  be reconciled with the rule that unambiguous insurance policies are subject to\r\n  the traditional rules of contract construction, this court is precluded from\r\n  adopting the doctrine.Â  Such a departure from jurisprudence must be left to our\r\n  supreme court.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., THOMAS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Although the\r\n  trial court found the date of the accident to be May 31, 2006, the record\r\n  demonstrates this is a typographical error, and the parties accept that the\r\n  accident actually occurred in March 2006 during the policy period.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-243","title":"Chaplin v.
