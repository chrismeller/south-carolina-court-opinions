Harness, III, of\r\n          Mt. Pleasant, EvanderÂ  Whitehead, of Charleston, James S. Chandler, Jr., of\r\n          Pawleys Island, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This\r\n  action involves Hospital Land Partnersâ€™ (HLPâ€™s) application to obtain a\r\n  stormwater management permit to allow for development of land set aside as a\r\n  mitigation site for previous development.Â  We reverse in part, and vacate in\r\n  part.Â Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHLP owns an 8.55 acre parcel of property (the Property) near Conway, South Carolina.Â  The Property was once part of a larger tract owned by\r\n  International Paper known as Southbridge.Â  In the early 1980â€™s, International\r\n  Paper entered into an agreement with Glenn Hall for development of the\r\n  property.Â  Pursuant to the agreement, Hall Development would develop the property\r\n  and then purchase the lots from International Paper as the lots were finished.Â \r\n  Hall Development was responsible for obtaining state, local, and federal\r\n  permits.Â  It obtained a permit from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers and a\r\n  coastal zone consistency certification from the State of South Carolina,\r\n  through the South Carolina Coastal Council, which was the predecessor to the Department\r\n  of Health and Environmental Controlâ€™s (DHECâ€™s) Office of Ocean and Coastal\r\n  Resource Management (OCRM). Â Hall Development was allowed to fill three wetland\r\n  areas, totaling 1.029 acres for Section VIII of Myrtle Trace Subdivision and\r\n  dredge another area to make a lake.Â  As mitigation for this, Hall Development\r\n  was to protect another wetland area consisting of 4.689 acres and establish a\r\n  buffer around the wetlands.Â  The total mitigation site was 8.337 acres.Â  No\r\n  conservation easement or restrictive covenants were placed on the Property,\r\n  which remained titled to International Paper.Â  At the time, the policies of the\r\n  Army Corps of Engineers and the Coastal Council did not include the requirement\r\n  that a permittee record restrictive covenants and/or conservation easements to\r\n  protect wetlands, wetland buffers, and land provided in mitigation.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  members of HLP, Thomas Roe and Dr. Michael Hodge, became interested in the\r\n  Property in late 1996 or early 1997.Â  Thomas Roe met with Allen Moore, an\r\n  employee of International Paper in charge of the real estate portfolio,\r\n  regarding the availability of the Property.Â  Moore told Roe that the Property\r\n  was available but â€œmessed up.â€Â  Moore testified he told Roe that the Property\r\n  had potential problems with a Corps of Engineers permit.Â  A partnership formed\r\n  by Roe and Hodge, Hodge-Roe General Partnership, entered into an option\r\n  agreement with International Paper to purchase the Property for $225,000.Â  The\r\n  partnership paid only $10.00 for the option.Â  The attorney who conducted the\r\n  title examination did not find any problems with the Property, other than a\r\n  deed to the South Carolina Department of Transportation.Â  This matter was\r\n  resolved.Â  The Partnership also commissioned a wetland redelineation to be\r\n  conducted by the Brigman Company, which had also conducted the earlier wetlands\r\n  delineation for Hall Development.Â  The delineation, which was approved by the\r\n  Corps of Engineers and verified by OCRM, showed that less than 0.8 acres of\r\n  wetlands remained on the site.Â  The reduction possibly resulted from a\r\n  combination of factors, including changed Corps wetland delineation guidelines,\r\n  the excavation of the adjacent wetland, and the creation of the drainage canal\r\n  constructed earlier between the Property and Myrtle Trace.Â  \r\nThe Partnership purchased the Property on December 12, 1997 and\r\n  subsequently deeded it to HLP.Â  The timber on the Property was harvested in\r\n  April of 1998.Â  The residents of Myrtle Trace and Glenn Hall objected to any\r\n  development of the Property.Â  When HLP applied to have the Property rezoned,\r\n  the Horry County Planning Commission required HLP to obtain a letter from the\r\n  Corps of Engineers concerning the status of the Property as a mitigation site.Â \r\n  The Corps responded that although the property was offered as mitigation for a\r\n  permit, there were no easements or covenants in its records and HLP could\r\n  proceed with any work in areas not designated as jurisdictional in the\r\n  delineation.Â  OCRM refused to issue a similar letter because the Property had\r\n  been offered by Hall Development as mitigation for wetlands filled by it.Â  \r\nOn July 7, 1999, HLP submitted an application to OCRM seeking a stormwater\r\n  management and sediment control permit as required by the Stormwater Management\r\n  and Sediment Reduction Act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-14-30(A) (2008) (â€œUnless\r\n  exempted, no person may engage in a land disturbing activity without first\r\n  submitting a stormwater management and sediment control plan to the appropriate\r\n  implementing agency and obtaining a permit to proceed.â€).Â  As part of this\r\n  permitting process, OCRM was to ensure the proposed project, located in a\r\n  coastal zone, was consistent with the policies of the Coastal Management\r\n  Program managed by DHEC.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-80(B)(11) (2008)\r\n  (authorizing DHEC to develop a plan to review all state and federal permit\r\n  applications in the coastal zone, and to certify that these do not contravene the\r\n  management plan).Â  In the application, HLP sought approval of a plan to disturb\r\n  7.77 acres of land for construction of a residential care facility.Â  Although\r\n  the application indicated that no wetlands would be disturbed, the area\r\n  disturbed would include the mitigation site.Â  In a letter dated September 27,\r\n  1999, OCRM informed HLP that the project was inconsistent with the Coastal Zone\r\n  Management Program.Â  However, the letter set forth several conditions that, if\r\n  accomplished, would bring the project into consistency.Â  These conditions were\r\n  that HLP was to:\r\n\r\n  a. Provide for a buffer\r\n    around the wetlands on the HLP property and adjacent tract, which is adjacent\r\n    to the southern property line of the HLP property;Â  \r\n  b. Redirect storm water\r\n    runoff at several locations into the wetlands;\r\n  c. Replant vegetation to\r\n    replace the vegetation that was cleared.Â  This was to re-establish the natural\r\n    screen between the wetland and the upland area;Â  \r\n  d. Purchase credits in an\r\n    off-site mitigation bank, in order to mitigate for the difference in the amount\r\n    of wetlands that were delineated in 1991 and the current amount.Â  The credits\r\n    would be no more than $20,000;Â  \r\n  e. Formally preserve all\r\n    of the wetlands and buffers in the area with a standard deed restriction.[1]Â  \r\n\r\nHLP\r\n  appealed to the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), contesting OCRMâ€™s\r\n  requirements.Â  In addition, Hall Development and Glenn Hall (collectively Hall)\r\n  and residents of Myrtle Trace appealed to the ALJ contesting the projectâ€™s\r\n  consistency with the Coastal Zone Management Act, Coastal Zone Management\r\n  Program Document, and the South Carolina Stormwater and Sedimentation Reduction\r\n  Act.Â  The appeals were consolidated for one hearing.Â  On the second day of the\r\n  hearing, HLP withdrew its claims of lack of authority by OCRM to require the conditions\r\n  and agreed to all of the conditions set forth in OCRMâ€™s letter.Â  \r\nThe ALJ\r\n  noted OCRM has significant discretion in any decision to grant or deny a\r\n  coastal zone permit.Â  He concluded that the buffers and the purchase of credits\r\n  in a mitigation bank to mitigate for the loss of wetlands that has occurred\r\n  over time comply with the requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Program.Â \r\n  He rejected Hall and the Residentsâ€™ res judicata argument, finding the\r\n  loss of wetlands on the property presented a change in circumstances not\r\n  contemplated by OCRM in its original certification determination.Â  He found\r\n  OCRMâ€™s proposed mitigation plan would protect the remaining wetlands more\r\n  effectively than preservation of the status quo.Â  The ALJ ordered HLP to submit\r\n  a stormwater management plan that incorporates the conditions listed in OCRMâ€™s\r\n  September letter.Â  \r\nHall and the Residents appealed to the DHEC Board.Â  The DHEC Board\r\n  initially rejected the ALJâ€™s findings of fact and made its own findings.Â  It\r\n  reversed the decision of the ALJ and denied HLPâ€™s application for a storm water\r\n  and sediment control permit.Â  HLP appealed to the circuit court, which vacated\r\n  the decision of the DHEC Board for making its own findings of fact.[2]Â  After the remand, the DHEC Board\r\n  found the Coastal Zone Management Program certification of Phase VIII of the\r\n  Myrtle Trace development, which required the setting aside and protection of\r\n  the buffer area as mitigation, constituted a final agency action.Â  It held that\r\n  â€œ[o]nly in extraordinary cases can the terms and conditions of a final [Coastal\r\n  Zone Management Program] certification be rescinded.Â  This is clearly not one\r\n  of those cases.â€Â  It held that the effect of the ALJ order would be to allow\r\n  development of the buffer area previously set aside as mitigation and this\r\n  constituted an error of law.Â  It affirmed the ALJâ€™s findings of fact but\r\n  reversed as to its conclusions of law.Â  Thus, it denied HLPâ€™s application for a\r\n  permit.Â  \r\nHLP appealed to the circuit court.Â  The court summarized the testimony\r\n  presented at the hearing before the ALJ.Â  It held that the DHEC Boardâ€™s\r\n  decision that once a piece of land is set aside as mitigation, it must stay set\r\n  aside in the absence of extraordinary circumstances was squarely a ruling of\r\n  law.Â  It concluded the Boardâ€™s ruling on this question of law had legal and\r\n  factual support.Â  In affirming the Boardâ€™s order, the circuit court also\r\n  addressed several additional sustaining grounds.Â  The court subsequently denied\r\n  HLPâ€™s motion to alter or amend.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder the APA (Administrative Procedures Act), the Administrative\r\n  Law Judge presides as the fact finder.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B)\r\n  (2005); [3] Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 520,\r\n  560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002).Â  In reviewing the final decision of the ALJ, the\r\n  DHEC Board sat as a quasi-judicial tribunal and was not entitled to make\r\n  findings of fact.Â  Brown, 348 S.C. at 520, 560 S.E.2d at 417.Â  The DHEC\r\n  Board can only reverse the ALJ based on an error of law or if his findings are\r\n  not supported by substantial evidence.Â  See Dorman v. S.C. Depâ€™t of\r\n    Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 350 S.C. 159, 165, 565 S.E.2d 119, 122 (Ct. App.\r\n  2002).Â  The circuit courtâ€™s review is the same as this courtâ€™s. Â It may reverse\r\n  a decision of an administrative agency if the agencyâ€™s findings or conclusions\r\n  are:\r\n\r\n  (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;Â  \r\n  (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;Â  \r\n  (c) made upon unlawful procedure;Â  \r\n  (d) affected by other error of law;Â  \r\n  (e) clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n    reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record;Â  or \r\n  (f) arbitrary or capricious or\r\n    characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of\r\n    discretion.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  determining whether the ALJâ€™s decision was supported by substantial evidence,\r\n  this court need only find, looking at the entire record on appeal, evidence\r\n  from which reasonable minds could reach the same conclusion that the\r\n  administrative agency reached.â€Â  DuRant v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n    Control, 361 S.C. 416, 420, 604 S.E.2d 704, 706 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œThe mere\r\n  possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\r\n  prevent a finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Id. at 420, 604 S.E.2d at 707. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Permit\r\n  Application\r\nHLP\r\n  argues the DHEC Boardâ€™s order and the circuit courtâ€™s order are erroneous as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  DHEC Board ruled, â€œOnly in extraordinary cases can the terms and conditions of\r\n  a final CZMP certification be rescinded.â€Â  It concluded this case did not meet\r\n  that criteria.Â  DHEC is the agency in charge of enforcing and administering the\r\n  provisions of the Coastal Zone Management Act and the rules and regulations\r\n  promulgated under it.Â  S.C. Code Â§48-39-50 (2008).Â  In addition, DHEC is\r\n  charged with the development of a comprehensive coastal management program and\r\n  the enforcement and administration of this program.Â  S.C. Code Â§ 48-39-80\r\n  (2008).Â  Its interpretation of these statutes and regulations is given great\r\n  deference by the courts.Â  See Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of Examâ€™rs in\r\n    Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987) (â€œ[T]he\r\n  construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be\r\n  accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent\r\n  compelling reasons.â€).Â  In the present case, however, neither the statutes nor\r\n  the regulations promulgated thereunder set forth a requirement of an\r\n  extraordinary case in order for a prior mitigation site to be modified.Â  The\r\n  DHEC Board cannot create a new test by way of quasi-judicial order, but rather\r\n  must promulgate such a test by regulation.Â  See Captainâ€™s Quarters\r\n    Motor Inn v. S.C. Coastal Council, 306 S.C. 488, 491, 413 S.E.2d 13, 14\r\n  (1991) (holding OCRMâ€™s predecessor, the South Carolina Coastal Council,\r\n  overstepped its statutory authority in formulating and applying a damage\r\n  assessment test for purposes of permit evaluations without formalizing it by\r\n  regulation).Â  \r\nHall\r\n  and the Residents assert that under the Coastal Zone Management Program\r\n  Document, once a permit is issued, OCRM may not take any inconsistent action.Â \r\n  It asserts OCRM could not modify the original certification.Â  This provision\r\n  actually provides, â€œIn those instances where more than one permit is required\r\n  for a project, as long as no components of the project change, the Department\r\n  will only place the first permit received on public notice.Â  The Department\r\n  will take identical action on all sequential permits.â€Â  The provision simply\r\n  allows that once OCRM determines a project is consistent with the Coastal Zone\r\n  Management Program and issues the first permit, it will do the same with\r\n  subsequent permits for the same project.Â  Thus, it could not grant one permit\r\n  and then deny a subsequent permit for the same project.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  instant case involves a permit application for an entirely different project\r\n  than the development of Myrtle Trace in which the original mitigation site was\r\n  set aside.Â  It does not involve the rescission of the original Coastal Zone\r\n  Management Program certification; rather it simply allows a release of an area\r\n  that was required to be set-aside as a mitigation site.Â  We find the above\r\n  provision inapplicable to the present case.Â  \r\n We\r\n  conclude the DHEC Board erred as a matter of law in creating a test not set\r\n  forth in statute or regulation.Â  Therefore, we must affirm the ALJâ€™s findings\r\n  and conclusion that HLPâ€™s project was consistent if there is substantial\r\n  evidence in the record to support the decision.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).\r\nThe\r\n  General Assembly mandated the specific state policy to be followed in the\r\n  implementation of the Coastal Zone Management Act is: \r\n\r\n  [t]o promote economic and social improvement of the citizens of\r\n    this State and to encourage development of coastal resources in order to\r\n    achieve such improvement with due consideration for the environment and within\r\n    the framework of a coastal planning program that is designed to protect the sensitive\r\n    and fragile areas from inappropriate development and provide adequate\r\n    environmental safeguards with respect to the construction of facilities in the\r\n    critical areas of the coastal zone . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  48-39-30(B)(1) (2008).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  furtherance of this policy, the General Assembly set forth considerations in\r\n  the approval or denial of a permit, which include:\r\n\r\n  (7) The extent of the economic benefits as compared with the\r\n    benefits from preservation of an area in its unaltered state.\r\n    (8) The extent of any adverse environmental impact which cannot be\r\n    avoided by reasonable safeguards. \r\n    (10) The extent to which the proposed use could affect the value\r\n    and enjoyment of adjacent owners. \r\n  \r\nS. C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  48-39-150 (2008).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, OCRMâ€™s Coastal Zone Management Program Document provides additional\r\n  guidelines for evaluating projects, including â€œthe extent to which the project\r\n  includes consideration for the maintenance or improvement of the economic\r\n  stability of the coastal communities,â€ and the â€œpossible long-range, cumulative\r\n  effects of the project, when reviewed in the context of other possible\r\n  development and the general character of the area.â€Â  \r\nThe ALJ\r\n  considered these factors in concluding that OCRM adequately evaluated the\r\n  project and correctly found that the project, as revised, was consistent with\r\n  the Coastal Zone Management Program.Â  Robert Mikell, manager of federal\r\n  certification for OCRM, testified that if HLP made the changes set forth in the\r\n  September of 1999 letter, the project would be in compliance with the Coastal\r\n  Zone Management Program.Â  The amount of wetlands on the Property significantly\r\n  decreased since the Property was originally set aside as a mitigation site.Â \r\n  This decrease, due in part to the lake and canal constructed in Myrtle Trace,\r\n  happened before HLP purchased the property.Â  Mikell stated that the HLP project\r\n  does not directly impact the remaining wetlands on the Property as they will\r\n  not be filled, excavated, or dredged.Â  \r\nThe ALJ\r\n  also considered the modifications OCRM required in its September of 1999\r\n  letter.Â  The first requirement set forth in the letter is buffering.Â  Although\r\n  OCRMâ€™s Coastal Zone Management Program document suggests that commercial\r\n  buffers should be at least an average of 50 feet, OCRM allowed a buffer of an\r\n  average of 32 feet for this project.Â  Mikell testified that a 32-foot buffer\r\n  can be acceptable depending on the area that is being buffered, the size of the\r\n  wetland, the type of development, the site plan, and the fact that the project\r\n  does not impact wetlands.Â  The ALJ concluded the buffer in place was adequate\r\n  of function as intended.Â  There is substantial evidence to support this\r\n  finding.Â Â  \r\n The\r\n  next requirement was altering the stormwater plan to show runoff being routed\r\n  to the wetland system from several points.Â  Mikell stated that by redirecting\r\n  the water, the wetlands were not likely to further retreat and would either\r\n  stay the same or perhaps increase.Â  \r\nThe third requirement was replanting the wetland/buffer area to\r\n  improve the screening features adjacent to the wetlands.Â  This screening will\r\n  benefit the adjacent property owners and will grow over the years.Â  \r\nThe fourth requirement was HLP would purchase credits at an\r\n  approved mitigation bank a sum to compensate for lost wetlands and buffer\r\n  area.Â  Mikell calculated the payment would be approximately $20,000.Â  OCRMâ€™s\r\n  mitigation guidelines allow for off-site mitigation â€œif the mitigation will\r\n  provide significant ecological benefit to the State of South Carolina.â€Â  Mikell\r\n  testified that the mitigation banks to which HLP is required to purchase\r\n  credits are all located in areas that the state have deemed worthy of being\r\n  restored.Â  Thus, in his opinion, all of the banks have been identified as being\r\n  of ecological benefit to the State.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  final requirement was that the wetlands and buffers must be preserved using\r\n  standard deed restrictions.Â  This requirement eliminates any uncertainty in the\r\n  protection of the remaining wetlands.Â  \r\nThe ALJ held, â€œOCRMâ€™s proposed mitigation plan would protect the\r\n  remaining wetlands more effectively than preservation of the status quo. . . .Â \r\n  Given that the topography of the wetlands [has] changed since 1989, OCRMâ€™s\r\n  proposed mitigation plan appropriately alters the status of the property upon\r\n  reassessment of its physical characteristics.â€Â  We hold there is substantial\r\n  evidence in the record to support this finding\r\nThe ALJ\r\n  also considered the Residentsâ€™ argument concerning diminution of property\r\n  values.Â  A property owner is competent to testify as to the value of his\r\n  property.Â  Hawkins v.

App. 1997).Â  However, Myrtle Trace property owner Renzo\r\n  Falcinelli only testified he believed his property value had gone down.Â \r\n  Neither he nor any other Resident provided actual evidence of the amount of a\r\n  decrease in value.Â  They failed to offer evidence of sales of similar property\r\n  showing the presence of a similar project in the coastal zone had materially\r\n  and negatively impacted the value of adjacent ownerâ€™s property.Â  Falcinelli\r\n  also testified about his loss of enjoyment of the use of his property due to\r\n  the harvesting of the trees.Â  OCRMâ€™s requirement for replanting the buffer area\r\n  should help restore the screening and alleviate some of his and the other\r\n  ownerâ€™s concerns.Â  \r\nThe ALJ\r\n  addressed Hall and Residentsâ€™ argument that the project is not consistent with\r\n  the Coastal Zone Management Program because zoning approval has not been\r\n  obtained.Â  As the ALJ noted, zoning compliance is just one of many factors set\r\n  forth in the Coastal Zone Management Program Document for OCRM to consider.Â \r\n  Here, the local zoning authorities deferred action on HLPâ€™s rezoning request\r\n  until HLP could receive clearance from OCRM to deviate from the previous buffer\r\n  requirements.Â  We agree with the ALJ that the absence of zoning approval in\r\n  this case did not render the project inconsistent with the Coastal Zone\r\n  Management Program.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Coastal Zone Management Act and OCRMâ€™s Coastal Zone Management Program Document\r\n  set forth the considerations to be utilized in achieving the stateâ€™s policy of\r\n  balancing economic development and preservation of the environment.Â  Achieving\r\n  this balance requires flexibility and contemplation of the actual circumstances\r\n  involved in each projectâ€™s permit application.Â  OCRM has allowed modification\r\n  in other plans according to Mikell.Â  In this case, the wetlands on the area\r\n  diminished significantly.Â  The current plan will allow for preservation of the\r\n  remaining wetlands and in addition will provide for payment into the mitigation\r\n  bank to allow for restoration and preservation of an area in need.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find substantial evidence supports the ALJâ€™s decision a\r\n  stormwater management plan that incorporates the requirements in OCRMâ€™s\r\n  September, 1999 letter is consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Program.Â  \r\n2.Â  Additional\r\n  sustaining grounds\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court ruled as an additional sustaining ground that the ALJ erred by\r\n  refusing to consider fundamental principles of property law.Â  The court held\r\n  that Roe had constructive and actual knowledge of the mitigation requirements\r\n  prior to HLPâ€™s acquisition of the property.Â  However, the ALJ never held HLP\r\n  was not bound by the prior mitigation restrictions.Â  In fact, OCRMâ€™s position\r\n  was that the mitigation restrictions were in place and binding on HLP.Â  The\r\n  requirement that HLP purchase credits in an off-site mitigation bank was to\r\n  mitigate for the difference in the amount of wetlands in the original\r\n  delineation and the current amount.Â  Although HLP initially contested OCRMâ€™s\r\n  additional conditions, it later agreed to them and its notice of the mitigation\r\n  site was not an issue.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court also held the ALJ ignored the equitable, economic, and property\r\n  interests of Hall and the Myrtle Trace residents.Â  As stated above, the extent\r\n  to which the project affects the value and enjoyment of adjacent owners was a\r\n  factor considered by the ALJ in determining whether the project was consistent\r\n  with the Coastal Zone Management Program.Â  As we found above, the ALJâ€™s finding\r\n  of consistency is supported by substantial evidence.Â  \r\nTo the\r\n  extent the circuit court relied on other aspects of property law, we vacate\r\n  these rulings.Â  The sole issue in this case is whether the HLP project is\r\n  consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Program in order that HLP may\r\n  receive a Stormwater permit to proceed with the project.Â  As the ALJ stated,\r\n  any issues relating to real property law should be resolved in another forum.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  another additional sustaining ground, the circuit court held the ALJ erred by\r\n  turning a mere settlement proposal into a final staff decision.Â  OCRMâ€™s\r\n  September of 1999 letter set forth the requirements that must be included in a\r\n  revision of HLPâ€™s plans for the project.Â  Although the letter termed it a\r\n  â€œmitigation settlement plan,â€ HLP was entitled to seek an administrative\r\n  hearing on this matter.Â  See 26 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 72-313(A)(5) (Supp.\r\n  2007) (stating an administrative hearing is available to determine the\r\n  propriety of the requirements imposed by the implementing agency for approval\r\n  of the stormwater management and sediment reduction plan).Â  At this\r\n  administrative hearing, Hall and the Residents were allowed to present their\r\n  opposition to the project and were given an opportunity to be heard on the\r\n  consistency of OCRMâ€™s proposed mitigation plan with the Coastal Zone Management\r\n  Program in a contested case proceeding.Â  We find the circuit courtâ€™s ruling was\r\n  in error.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe REVERSE the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the DHEC\r\n  Boardâ€™s denial of HLPâ€™s permit application and reinstate the order of the ALJ\r\n  allowing HLP to resubmit a stormwater plan including OCRMâ€™s additional\r\n  conditions.Â  In addition, we VACATE the circuit courtâ€™s rulings on\r\n  property law issues.Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n  IN PART; VACATED IN PART.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] OCRM also required HLP to raise the outfall\r\n  structure that is located adjacent to the canal in the Myrtle Trace\r\n  Subdivision.Â  However, further review indicated this may cause flooding and\r\nOCRM withdrew this condition.Â  \r\n[2] During the pendency of the initial appeal to circuit\r\n  court, the supreme court had issued an opinion restricting the Boardâ€™s\r\n  authority to make findings of fact.Â  See Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\nControl, 348 S.C. 507, 560 S.E.2d 410 (2002).Â  \r\n[3]This case progressed under the procedures in place\r\n  prior to 2006 revision of the Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act, which omitted the appeals to the DHEC Board and the circuit\r\n  court.Â  See Act.

Â The trial court\r\n  granted summary judgment to Blakeslee and Martin.Â  BillyBob appeals.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS[2]\r\nOutdoor\r\n  Resorts RV Resort and Yacht Club (the Development) is a recreational vehicle\r\n  (RV) resort and marina located on Jenkins Island in Beaufort County.Â  From the Developmentâ€™s inception in 1981, it has consisted of several separate areas\r\n  including a marina, the resort including 200 lots with parking pads for RVs\r\n  (lots), and a real estate and rental management business.Â  The Development, a\r\n  South Carolina General Partnership, developed the resort and owned the marina\r\n  and rental management business.Â  In June 1981, the â€œDeclaration of Covenants\r\n  and Restrictions for Outdoor Resorts, R.V. Resort and Yacht Club and Provisions\r\n  for the R.V. Resort and Yacht Club Ownersâ€™ Association, Inc.â€ (the Covenants)\r\n  were recorded.Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Covenants provide the Developer has the exclusive right to rent lots belonging\r\n  to the individual owners within the resort when not occupied by the owner(s)\r\n  and his or her guest(s) at the scheduled rate promulgated by the Developer.Â \r\n  The Covenants further provide the Developer shall retain fifty percent â€œof\r\n  rental collected on any Lotâ€ and remit the remaining fifty percent to the lot\r\n  owner.Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  August 31, 1999, BillyBob purchased the marina and rental management\r\n  businesses, real estate in the Development, and the Developerâ€™s right to rent\r\n  lots.Â  Based on BillyBobâ€™s changes in restrictions and fee collections, the\r\n  Association and several lot owners filed an action alleging, inter alia,\r\n  BillyBob violated the Covenants.Â  BillyBob counterclaimed asserting numerous\r\n  violations of the Covenants including Blakesleeâ€™s alleged violation of a\r\n  covenant restricting permanent residences in the resort.Â  The referee found, inter\r\n    alia, Blakeslee was not in violation\r\n  of the Covenants.Â  BillyBob appealed to this court, and in RV Resort v. BillyBobâ€™s Marina, Inc., this court affirmed the refereeâ€™s finding.\r\nDuring\r\n  the pendency of that action, BillyBob filed these actions, again alleging Blakeslee was in violation of the covenant\r\n  restricting permanent residences.Â  BillyBob likewise alleged Martinâ€™s use\r\n  violated the Covenants.Â  In separate orders, the trial court found neither Blakeslee\r\n  nor Martin violated the Covenants.Â  The trial court also awarded Blakeslee and\r\n  Martin attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  BillyBob appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe character of an action as legal or equitable depends on the\r\n  relief sought.Â  Cedar Cove\r\n    Homeowners Assâ€™n v. DiPietro, 368 S.C. 254, 258, 628 S.E.2d 284, 286 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  An action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is an equitable action. Â South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617,\r\n  622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001).Â  In an action in equity, we may find facts in accordance with our\r\n  own view of the evidence.Â  Id. Â â€œAs a practical matter, however, we . . . defer to the good judgment of the trial court who heard and observed the witnesses.â€Â  Costa &amp;\r\n    Sons Constr. Co. v. Long, 306 S.C. 465, 468, 412 S.E.2d 450, 452&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  1991).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nBillyBob\r\n  argues the trial court erred in finding the Covenants do not prohibit lot\r\n  owners from permanently residing on their lots.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\n\tArticle\r\n  VIII, section 8.1, of the Covenants states: \r\n\t\r\n\t\tIt is the specific intent of this Declaration to\r\n  create and maintain a lu[x]ury resort for recreation vehicles and to prohibit\r\n  permanent or semi-permanent structures as well as any structure or vehicle\r\n  which is used as, or designed for use as, permanent living quarters on any Lot.Â  In that regard, all Lots . . . shall be reserved and restricted for recreation\r\n  campsites and camping vehicles, including . . . modern travel trailers . . .\r\n  and other similar types of camping trailers and equipment that are mobile. . .\r\n  .Â  Lot Owners . . . are prohibited from erecting or placing on any Lot any permanent or semi-permanent structure or any vehicle which is designed as permanent\r\n  living quarters, which prohibited structures include, without limitation, the\r\n  following:Â  (a) screen rooms, carport, metal awnings . . . ; (b) travel\r\n  trailers longer than thirty-five (35) feet . . . ; (c) mobile homes; (d) any\r\n  structure which cannot be transported within the pulling vehicle . . . ; (e)\r\n  any structure placed on the Lot on blocks . . . ; (f) any structure not\r\n  intended to be temporary, that is, any structure intended not to be readily\r\n  movable; and (g) any structure designed, intended or used as permanent living\r\n  quarters.Â  Provided, this paragraph is not intended to prohibit or limit the\r\n  utilization of otherwise permissible recreation vehicles as described above . .\r\n  . .Â  It is the declared intent of the Developer to exclude mobile homes from\r\n  being placed on any Lot, and to create and maintain an area designated for\r\n  maximum beauty and benefit of campers. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBlakeslee\r\n  and Marvin own travel trailers that are not restricted by the Covenants.Â \r\n  BillyBob presented evidence that Blakeslee lives exclusively in his travel\r\n  trailer, resided for more than twelve consecutive months on his lot in the\r\n  resort, and claimed the homestead exemption for his lot.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 12-37-250 (Supp. 2007) (providing real estate taxation relief for\r\n  dwelling place).Â  BillyBob likewise alleged Martin used his lot as permanent\r\n  living quarters.[3]Â \r\n  BillyBob relies on the language prohibiting â€œpermanent living quartersâ€ to\r\n  argue the Covenants restrict the amount of time a Lot owner may spend on his or\r\n  her lot.Â Â  \r\nRestrictive\r\n  covenants are contractual in nature and rules of contract interpretation\r\n  apply.Â  Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 166, 631 S.E.2d 539, 542 (2006).Â \r\n  However, restrictions on the use of property are strictly construed with all\r\n  doubts resolved in favor of the free use of property.Â  Id.Â  \r\nReading\r\n  Article VIII, section 8.1, of the Covenants as a whole, we agree with the trial\r\n  court that the covenant is intended to exclude mobile homes and permanent\r\n  structures so as to prevent the resort from becoming a mobile home park.Â  The\r\n  Covenants do not place any limit on the amount of time owners may use or occupy\r\n  their lots. We do not read the language prohibiting â€œpermanent living quartersâ€\r\n  as restricting an ownerâ€™s use of their lot to a certain period of time when\r\n  they are using an otherwise acceptable vehicle on the lot.Â  We find support for\r\n  this interpretation in the Covenantâ€™s provision stating: â€œthis paragraph is not\r\n  intended to prohibit or limit the utilization of otherwise permissible\r\n  recreation vehicles . . . . It is the declared intent of the Developer to\r\n  exclude mobile homes from being placed on any Lot, and to create and maintain\r\n  an area designated for maximum beauty and benefit of campers.â€Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find the trial court did not err in finding the Covenants do not prohibit lot\r\n  owners from permanently residing on their lots.\r\nBillyBob also\r\n  argues the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs should be reversed if we reverse\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s orders finding Blakeslee and Martin did not violate the\r\n  Covenants.Â  Because we affirm said orders, we likewise affirm the orders\r\n  granting attorneyâ€™s fees and costs. \r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the orders on appeal are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We\r\ndecide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Some of the facts in this case are as reported\r\n  in RV Resort v.

Horton, Inc. (Horton).Â  We affirm. Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 29, 2003, Horton and Campus Housing entered into a contract\r\n  for the purchase of real estate in Beaufort County.Â  Pursuant to the contract,\r\n  Campus Housing was obligated to make deposits into escrow in four separate\r\n  amounts at specific times.[1]Â \r\n  The contract also provided the â€œSeller will have reasonable ARB [Architectural\r\n  Review Board] approval over the product that will be built by the Purchaser,\r\n  with said ARB guidelines being provided to the Purchaser by the Seller during\r\n  the Due Diligence Period.â€\r\nOn November 19, 2003, the parties amended the original contract\r\n  with an â€œAddendum to Purchase Agreementâ€ (Addendum).Â  In the Addendum, Campus Housing\r\n  had until April 25, 2004 to complete its due diligence study on the property to\r\n  determine the suitability of the property for its intended use.Â  Campus Housing\r\n  could then choose to either terminate the agreement or make the final deposit\r\n  into escrow.\r\nOn April 2, 2004, Horton and Campus Housing entered into a new\r\n  contract for the purchase and sale of additional property in Beaufort County.Â  The new contract also gave Campus Housing until April 25, 2004 to complete\r\n  its due diligence study to determine if it wanted to make the final deposit\r\n  into escrow.\r\nBy letter dated April 21, 2004, Campus Housing informed Horton that\r\n  pursuant to the contract, it believed the deadline for delivering its ARB\r\n  guidelines (guidelines) to Campus Housing was April 7, 2003, more than a year\r\n  prior to the date of the letter.Â  Therefore, Campus Housing argued the due\r\n  diligence period should be extended for a period equal to the time between the\r\n  due date and the date Horton would be providing the guidelines to Campus\r\n  Housing.Â  In a second letter, Campus Housing further claimed it was not\r\n  required to close until Horton provided the guidelines, even though the original\r\n  contract set the closing for fifteen days after the end of the due diligence\r\n  period.Â  Horton rejected Campus Housingâ€™s argument, claiming the delivery of\r\n  the guidelines was not a condition precedent to Campus Housingâ€™s obligation to\r\n  make the escrow deposits.\r\nAs of April 26, 2004, Campus Housing had not made the final\r\n  deposits into escrow or terminated either contract.Â  On April 26, Campus\r\n  Housing sent notices to Horton alleging Horton was in default under the terms\r\n  of both contracts.Â  Specifically, Campus Housing claimed Horton failed to timely\r\n  provide the guidelines because Horton was obligated under the contracts to\r\n  provide the guidelines to Campus Housing during the time period Campus Housing\r\n  was required to complete its due diligence studies.Â  The following day, Horton\r\n  sent a notice of default to Campus Housing for failure to make the escrow payments.Â \r\n  According to the original contract, each party was entitled to written notice\r\n  of default and would have fifteen days from the receipt of the notice to cure\r\n  the alleged defect.\r\nOn April 30, 2004, Horton wrote to Campus Housing providing the guidelines\r\n  Horton intended to impose on the land: \r\n\r\n\t[T]he only [guidelines] which Horton will impose on [the land] . .\r\n  . would be Hortonâ€™s prior written approval of the design and exterior color of\r\n  any improvements [to the land] within 100â€™ of the propertiesâ€™ common boundary\r\n  line with property owned by [Horton] and within 150â€™ of the intersection of any\r\n  right of way at the point where such right of way crosses from property owned\r\n  by [Horton] into properties owned by Campus Housing.\r\n\r\nThe letter\r\n  further stated â€œif [Campus Housing] purchases all properties . . . currently\r\n  under contract to purchase from [Horton] there will be no [guidelines] imposed\r\n  by [Horton].â€\r\nOn May 3, 2004, Campus Housing wrote to Horton asking for\r\n  clarification as to what guidelines Horton planned to employ.Â  In response,\r\n  Horton wrote Campus Housing the next day addressing Campus Housingâ€™s\r\n  questions.Â  However, Campus Housing contended Hortonâ€™s letters did not\r\n  sufficiently provide the â€œarchitectural guidelinesâ€ required by the contract.Â  Neither\r\n  the original contract nor the Addendum defines what the parties intended by the\r\n  term â€œguidelines.â€\r\nSubsequently, Horton wrote to Campus Housing informing them Horton\r\n  was willing to enter into negotiations to revive the January 29 contract because\r\n  Horton considered the contracts to be terminated due to Campus Housingâ€™s\r\n  failure to timely make their payments.Â  The same day, Campus Housing wrote to\r\n  Horton contending Horton had not provided the guidelines as required and rejecting\r\n  Hortonâ€™s assertion the contracts had been terminated.\r\nOn May 26, 2004, Horton filed a declaratory judgment action\r\n  against Campus Housing for breach of contract.Â  On June 2, Campus Housing filed\r\n  its answer and counterclaims for reformation and special performance.Â  After a\r\n  trial without a jury, the trial court issued its order denying both partiesâ€™\r\n  claims.Â  Both parties filed Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motions to alter or amend, which\r\n  the court denied on February 8, 2007.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA\r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.â€ Â Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co. of Cal., 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).[2]Â \r\n  Reformation of a contract and an action for specific performance are actions in\r\n  equity.Â  Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81,\r\n  557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001); Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C.\r\n  98, 531 S.E.2d 287 (2000); see Godfrey v. E.P. Burton Lumber Co.,\r\n  88 S.C. 132, 133, 70 S.E. 396, 397 (1910).Â  In an action in equity, tried by\r\n  the judge alone, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in\r\n  accordance with its views of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes\r\n    Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775\r\n  (1976).Â  However, we are not required to disregard the factual findings of the trial\r\n  court, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to judge\r\n  their credibility.Â  Smith v. Barr, 375 S.C. 157, 160, 650 S.E.2d 486,\r\n  488 (Ct. App. 2007). \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Architectural Guidelines\r\nCampus\r\n  Housing argues the trial court erred in finding Horton fulfilled its obligation\r\n  to provide guidelines to Campus Housing because the materials provided were not\r\n  as contemplated by the parties.Â  We disagree.\r\nCampus Housing contends Hortonâ€™s letters did not provide the\r\n  guidelines required by the contract; however, the contracts did not define what\r\n  the parties intended by the use of the word â€œguidelines.â€Â  The January 29 contract\r\n  provided the â€œSeller will have reasonable ARB [Architectural Review Board]\r\n  approval over the product that will be built by the Purchaser, with said ARB\r\n  guidelines being provided to the Purchaser by the Seller during the Due\r\n  Diligence Period.â€Â  In a letter to Campus Housing, Horton stated the only guidelines\r\n  Horton would impose on the land would be Hortonâ€™s prior written approval of the\r\n  design and exterior color of any improvements to the land within 100 feet of\r\n  the propertiesâ€™ common boundary line with property owned by Horton and within\r\n  150 feet of the intersection of any right of way at the point where such right\r\n  of way crosses from property owned by Horton into properties owned by Campus\r\n  Housing.Â  Horton also added the review rights would not be unreasonable and\r\n  Campus Housing was â€œfree to develop its property as it likes.â€Â  The letter\r\n  further stated that if Campus Housing purchased all the properties it was under\r\n  contract to purchase from Horton, Horton would not impose any guidelines.\r\nThus, sufficient evidence in\r\n  the record supports the trial courtâ€™s finding the contracts did not state what\r\n  the parties meant by â€œguidelinesâ€ and Hortonâ€™s letters were sufficient to fulfill its obligation under\r\n  the contract.\r\nII.Â \r\n  Specific Performance\r\nCampus\r\n  Housing also claims the trial court erred in holding Campus Housing was\r\n  required to prove it was financially ready to close the deal to demand specific\r\n  performance.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œSpecific\r\n  performance should be granted only if there is no adequate remedy at law and\r\n  specific enforcement of the contract is equitable between the parties.â€Â  Ingram\r\n    v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 106, 531 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2000).Â  In Ingram,\r\n  the Supreme Court of South Carolina held to compel specific performance, a\r\n  court of equity must find: \r\n\r\n\t(1) [T]here\r\n  is clear evidence of a valid agreement; (2) the agreement had been partly\r\n  carried into execution on one side with the approbation of the other; and (3)\r\n  the party who comes to compel performance has performed his or her part, or has\r\n  been and remains able and willing to perform his or her part of the contract.\r\n\r\nId. \r\nHere,\r\n  Campus Housing meets the first two elements of specific performance as\r\n  evidenced by record: (1) Horton and Campus Housing had a valid agreement and (2)\r\n  Campus Housing met its obligations prior to April 26, 2004.Â  However, Campus\r\n  Housing also had to prove the ability to perform part of the contract on June\r\n  2, 2004, the date it brought an action for specific performance.Â  While evidence\r\n  in the record suggests Campus Housing made efforts to obtain the money to close\r\n  on the contracts, the evidence presented fails to show Campus Housing had the\r\n  funds to do so on June 2, 2004.Â  Also, the managing director of Campus Housing,\r\n  Craig Germain, testified during his deposition that Campus Housing did not have\r\n  the money to close the deal as of May 10, or June 10, 2004.Â  Germain also\r\n  stated Campus Housing did not have the money in its account to pay the final\r\n  escrow deposits when they were due on April 26, 2004.\r\nTherefore,\r\n  Campus Housing failed to meet the third required element of its claim for\r\n  specific performance and the trial court did not err by determining Campus\r\n  Housing did not have the funds to purchase the property at the time it filed\r\n  its action for specific performance.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the contracts did not define what the parties intended by\r\n  the use of the word â€œguidelines,â€ the trial court was correct in finding Hortonâ€™s letter fulfilled its obligation to\r\n  Campus Housing.Â  Also, the trial court correctly held Campus Housing\r\n  failed to meet a required element of its claim for specific performance because\r\n  the evidence presented showed Campus Housing did not have the necessary funds\r\n  to purchase the land when the action was filed.Â  Therefore, the order of the\r\n  trial court is Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  By\r\n  July 2003, Campus Housing made the first three required deposits into escrow.\r\n[2]Â  The claims presented to the trial court were both\r\n  legal and equitable.Â  Horton filed a complaint alleging breach of contract,\r\n  which is an action at law.Â  Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Langford, 330 S.C.\r\n  578, 581, 500 S.E.2d 496, 497 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Campus Housing answered\r\n  alleging claims for reformation and specific performance, which are actions in\r\n  equity.Â  Because Horton did not appeal the trial courtâ€™s order, we need only\r\n  look at the scope of review for an action in equity.Â  See Kiriakides\r\n    v.

(collectively â€œPremierâ€).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nBarefoot is owner and\r\n  operator of three golf courses at the Barefoot Resort in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[2]Â \r\n  Premier manages large, condominium-resort properties throughout the United States and Mexico and manages properties at the Barefoot Resort.Â  Legends Barefoot had borrowed\r\n  three million dollars from Premier in July of 2002 to pay for purchasing its\r\n  interest in the courses.Â  The parties agreed to an extension of the loan in July\r\n  of 2003.Â  They executed numerous documents in conjunction with the extension of\r\n  the loan.Â  One of these documents was a Shared Services Agreement (â€œSSAâ€).Â  The\r\n  SSA provided several benefits to Premier to help â€œensure the availability of\r\n  golf tee times for clients of Premier.â€Â  These benefits included giving Premier\r\n  control of the tee time sheets for Barefoot, blocking certain tee times for\r\n  Premier customers and paying Premier a four percent commission on all golf tee\r\n  times booked by Premier.Â  \r\nIn January of 2005,\r\n  Barefoot took control of the tee time sheets away from Premier.Â  Premier filed\r\n  suit for breach of contract alleging Barefoot had violated the provisions of\r\n  the SSA.Â  Barefoot answered alleging the SSA was not an enforceable contract\r\n  because it lacked material terms, specifically, a contract duration. Â The\r\n  master-in-equity found the contract was enforceable and the duration of the\r\n  contract was â€œfor as long asâ€ Premier continued doing business at Barefoot.Â  The\r\n  master further held Barefoot had breached the SSA and awarded Premier damages\r\n  in the amount of $161,369.Â  Barefoot appeals.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\nREVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to construe a contract is an action at law. Â Likewise, â€˜[a]n\r\n  action for breach of contract seeking money damages is an\r\n  action at law.â€™â€ Silver v. Aabstract Pools &amp; Spas, Inc., 376 S.C.\r\n  585, 590, 658 S.E.2d 539, 541-42. (Ct. App. 2008) (quoting R &amp; G\r\n    Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 430, 540\r\n  S.E.2d 113, 117 (Ct. App. 2000)).Â  On appeal from a final judgment of the\r\n  master in a law case tried without a jury, â€œwe may not consider the case based\r\n  on our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but must view the record\r\n  so as to support the masterâ€™s findings of fact whenever reasonably possible.â€ South Carolina Fed.

Â â€œIn other words, we must\r\n  consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the respondent,\r\n  eliminating from consideration evidence to the contrary.â€ Â Id. at 79,\r\n  399 S.E.2d at 11.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Enforceability\r\n  of Contract/Duration of Contract[3]\r\nBarefoot\r\n  argues the master erred in finding the SSA to be a valid and enforceable\r\n  contract where material terms were omitted.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œIt\r\n  is well settled in South Carolina that in order for there to be a binding\r\n  contract between parties, there must be a mutual manifestation of assent to the\r\n  terms.â€ Â Edens v. Laurel Hill, Inc., 271 S.C. 360, 364, 247\r\n  S.E.2d 434, 436 (1978). Â â€œSome terms are considered indispensable to a binding\r\n  contract. Â Among these are price, time and place.â€Â  Id.Â  However,\r\n  as noted by the master in his order, the requirement of a specific duration for\r\n  the enforcement of a contract is not limited solely to a calendar date, but may\r\n  be provided upon the occurrence of a specific event.Â  Prestwick Golf Club,\r\n    Inc. v. Prestwick Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 331 S.C. 385, 392, 503 S.E.2d 184, 187-88\r\n  (Ct. App. 1998).Â  \r\nâ€œAlthough\r\n  the interpretation of a contract is generally a matter of law, the intent of\r\n  the parties becomes a question of fact . . . when the contract is ambiguous.â€Â  Id. at 390, 503 S.E.2d at 187.Â  â€œAn ambiguous contract is a contract capable of\r\n  being understood in more than one way or a contract unclear in meaning because\r\n  it expresses its purpose in an indefinite manner.â€Â  HK New Plan Exchange\r\n    Prop. Owner I, LLC v. Coker, 375 S.C. 18, 24, 649 S.E.2d 181, 184 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007). Â When a contract is ambiguous, the courtâ€™s primary objective must be to\r\n  discern the intent of the parties.Â  Ecclesiastes\r\n    Prod. Ministries v. Outparcel Assocs., 374\r\n  S.C. 483, 497, 649 S.E.2d 494, 501 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007).Â  In ascertaining intent, the court will examine the\r\n  totality of the contract and the language used by the parties.Â  The court will\r\n  also strive to discover the situation of the parties, along with their purposes\r\n  at the time they entered the contract.Â  Id. at 498, 649 S.E.2d at 502. Â â€œIn\r\n  arriving at the intention of the parties . . . , the subject matter, the\r\n  surrounding circumstances, the situation of the parties, and the object in view\r\n  and intended to be accomplished by the parties at the time, are to be regarded.â€Â  Id. at 499, 649 S.E.2d at 502 (quoting Brady v. Brady, 222 S.C. 242, 246-47, 72Â  S.E.2d 193, 195\r\n  (1952)).\r\nWe agree with the masterâ€™s finding the duration of the SSA is\r\n  ambiguous as the partiesâ€™ intent is not clearly discernable from the language\r\n  of the SSA.Â  We believe the testimony in the record reasonably supports the\r\n  masterâ€™s finding the parties intended the SSA to be in effect for so long as\r\n  Premier was doing business at Barefoot.Â  Bradley Goulding, part owner and chief\r\n  operating/financial officer of Premier Resorts International, testified Premier\r\n  would not have entered into the loan-extension agreement without the SSA.Â  He further\r\n  testified Premier was making a long-term investment in the Myrtle Beach area\r\n  and would need the advantages offered by the SSA for as long as they were doing\r\n  business at Barefoot.Â  Barbara Zimonja, co-owner and president of Premier\r\n  Resorts International, testified she understood the SSA would be in effect as\r\n  long as Premier was in business at Barefoot.Â  Zimonja also stated Barefoot was\r\n  resistant to allowing Premier to have control of the tee time sheets, but\r\n  eventually Barefoot agreed to the SSA.Â  \r\nIn an e-mail, Thomas Trefor, an attorney acting as general counsel\r\n  for Barefoot at the time the SSA was executed, acknowledged the payoff of the\r\n  loan did not affect the status of the SSA.Â  He further testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Q. Did you have any understanding as to how long the parties\r\n      intended --- Whether they were contractual obligations or not --- how long\r\n      these items mentioned in the Shared Services Agreement were to be enforced?\r\n    A. My understanding was the intention here was that it be in\r\n      perpetuity.Â  Iâ€™ll point out, however, that the reason that Barefoot --- or\r\n      actually Larry Young and Danny Young were willing to agree to this provision,\r\n      if it were contractually binding on them, was that they were really obligated\r\n      to do it to Bank of America and, if they had engaged in this business at\r\n      Barefoot, theyâ€™d be in default of the seventy-five million dollar loan.\r\n    Q. When you say, â€œin perpetuity,â€ do you mean, â€œin\r\n      perpetuity,â€ or do you mean, â€œperpetuity, so long as Barefoot is in business at\r\n      the beach.â€\r\n    . . .\r\n    A. The way that itâ€™s drafted, it would appear to be a claim\r\n      in true perpetuity.Â  In practice, if Barefoot is no longer in business, it\r\n      becomes unenforceable.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nLarry Young, one of the principal owners of Barefoot, admitted\r\n  the SSA was intended to help ensure the availability of golf tee times for\r\n  Premier clients.Â  It logically follows Premier intended to accomplish this goal\r\n  by having control of the tee time sheets as set forth in Paragraph 3(c) of the\r\n  SSA for as long as they were doing business at Barefoot.\r\nLarry Young and Danny Young, another principal owner in Barefoot,\r\n  testified the SSA was to be re-evaluated periodically to see if it continued to\r\n  be mutually beneficial to both parties.Â  However, their testimony indicated\r\n  adjustments to the SSA were contemplated primarily with regard to the release\r\n  dates for the blocked tee times.[4]Â  While Barefoot had little negotiating power in the agreement\r\n  considering the need for the loan extension, they ultimately, and perhaps\r\n  reluctantly, agreed to give control of the tee sheets to Premier.Â  The\r\n  surrounding circumstances and the testimony in the record support the masterâ€™s\r\n  finding that the agreement was to last â€œso long asâ€ Premier was doing business\r\n  at Barefoot.\r\nII. Barefootâ€™s\r\n  Breach of the SSA\r\nNext, Barefoot\r\n  contends the master erred in finding it breached the SSA.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nBarefootâ€™s\r\n  argument on lack of breach goes hand in hand with its arguments regarding the\r\n  validity and duration of the SSA.Â  Barefoot does not deny it took control of\r\n  the tee time sheets.Â  Barefoot simply contends this action provided notice to\r\n  Premier that Barefoot intended to terminate the SSA.Â  See Carolina\r\n    Cable Network v. Alert Cable TV, Inc., 316 S.C. 98, 102, 447 S.E.2d 199,\r\n  201 (1994) (holding when no intent can be gleaned from the circumstances\r\n  surrounding a contract, the court will find the contract to be terminable by\r\n  either party given reasonable notice).Â  However, as previously discussed, we\r\n  find the master did not err in determining the SSA was to be in place so long\r\n  as Premier was doing business at Barefoot.Â  Consequently, the SSA was not\r\n  terminable at will by either party, and Barefootâ€™s actions constituted a breach\r\n  of the agreement.\r\nIII. Grant of\r\n  Injunctive Relief\r\nBarefoot also\r\n  appeals the masterâ€™s issuance of a temporary injunction.Â  The injunctive order allowed\r\n  Barefoot to retain control of the tee time sheets.Â  It also prevented Premier\r\n  from booking any tee times outside of its blocked tee times until Premier had\r\n  booked at least eighty-five percent of its blocked tee times.Â  Finally, the\r\n  order required Barefoot to leave the required tee times blocked until sixty\r\n  days prior at which time the time could be released.Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  the issuance of the masterâ€™s final order, the temporary injunction expired\r\n  rendering this issue moot.Â  Therefore, we decline to address it. See Curtis\r\n    v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 568, 549 S.E.2d 591, 597 (2001) (holding when a is moot).Â  Â Â \r\nIV. Damages\r\nNext, Barefoot\r\n  contends the trial court erred in awarding Premier $161,369 in damages when\r\n  that award was not supported by the evidence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nBarefoot appears\r\n  to argue because Premier was paid the four percent commission on all tee times\r\n  booked during the breach, Premier suffered no damages.Â  However, a plaintiff is\r\n  allowed to offer evidence of lost profits so long as the circumstances indicate\r\n  lost profits would have been within the contemplations of the parties at the\r\n  time of the contract.Â  Drews Co. v. Ledwith-Wolfe Assocs., 296 S.C. 207,\r\n  213, 371 S.E.2d 532, 535 (1988).Â  In this case, all the parties understood the\r\n  control of the tee sheets would have substantial bearing on the success of\r\n  Premier at Barefoot.Â  The parties would have also contemplated loss of control\r\n  of the tee sheets would reduce the number of bookings by Premier.Â  The lost\r\n  profits need not be reduced to a mathematical certainty to be recoverable.Â  Minter\r\n    v. GOCT, Inc., 322 S.C. 525, 528, 473 S.E.2d 67, 70 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  However, the\r\n  damages cannot be left to conjecture, guess, or speculation.Â  Id. \r\nHere, Premierâ€™s\r\n  expert, Robert Mark Woodworth, testified he compared booking trends for Premier\r\n  both â€œpre-breach and post-breach.â€Â  He then compared those figures with Premier\r\n  bookings made during the breach when Barefoot had control of the tee time\r\n  sheets.Â  Woodworth testified he then compared Premierâ€™s performance during the\r\n  breach against other similar businesses in the area.Â  Using all of that data,\r\n  he arrived at the conclusion Premier lost package golf commission income in the\r\n  amount of $79,970 and non-package golf commission in the amount of $89,399. Â Woodworthâ€™s\r\n  testimony established Premierâ€™s lost profits to a reasonable degree of\r\n  certainty providing evidence to support the masterâ€™s award.\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Retention\r\n  of Jurisdiction\r\nFinally,\r\n  Barefoot argues the master erred in retaining jurisdiction â€œfor the purpose of\r\n  compliance with this Order and with the provisions of the Shared Services\r\n  Agreement, and for determining such issues as may arise thereunder.â€Â  This\r\n  issue was not raised to the trial court in its motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment.Â  Therefore this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356\r\n  S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003) (holding\r\n  issues not raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not\r\n  be considered on appeal).Â  \r\nFor all of the\r\n  foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and KONDUROS, J.J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Barefoot is equally\r\n  owned by Barefoot Golf Club, LLC and Legends Barefoot, LLC (â€œLegends Barefootâ€).\r\n[3] We have\r\n  combined Appellantâ€™s Issues 1 and 2.\r\n[4] Danny Young\r\n  testified he had negotiated with Bradley Goulding for the unbooked blocked tee\r\n  times to be released ninety days in advance so they could be booked through\r\n  other avenues.Â  However, the SSA contained a sixty-day provision.Â  Young stated\r\n  Goulding assured him at the signing of the SSA that the timing of the releases\r\n  could be reviewed and adjusted periodically as needed.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-337","title":"Donald v.

DuRant, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  Leroy McGrier challenges the trial judgeâ€™s order revoking ninety days for\r\n  violating the conditions of the Community Supervision Program (CSP).Â  McGrier\r\n  contends application of the CSP statute, section 24-21-560(D) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code, is unconstitutional because it resulted in the imposition of a\r\n  greater sentence than his original sentence.Â  We reverse.[1]Â  Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nMcGrier was sentenced to three concurrent\r\n  prison terms of three years each.Â  After serving thirty-two months of the\r\n  thirty-six month sentence, McGrier was released to the South Carolina\r\n  Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services (the Department) and\r\n  entered the CSP.Â  McGrier was scheduled to end participation in the CSP on May\r\n  3, 2004.\r\nIn February of 2004, the trial judge found McGrier willfully\r\n  violated the terms of the CSP and revoked four months, remanding McGrier back\r\n  to the custody of the South Carolina Department of Corrections.Â  After serving\r\n  this sentence, McGrier was again released to CSP and assigned an ending date of\r\n  June 22, 2006.Â  In April of 2005, the trial judge again found McGrier had\r\n  violated the conditions of the CSP and sentenced McGrier to six months imprisonment.\r\n  Â On April 3, 2006, the trial judge again found McGrier in violation of the\r\n  terms and conditions of the CSP and ordered McGrier held in jail until he was\r\n  accepted into an inpatient substance abuse treatment program. \r\nOn October 26, 2006, the trial judge held another hearing on\r\n  McGrierâ€™s alleged violations of the CSP.Â  McGrier argued the potential one-year\r\n  incarceration for the violations amounted to the imposition of a new criminal\r\n  sentence and violated his constitutional rights by not affording him the rights\r\n  guaranteed to a criminal defendant.Â  On October 30, 2006, the trial judge found\r\n  McGrier in violation of the CSP, revoked McGrierâ€™s CSP, and sentenced him to ninety\r\n  days.Â  McGrier appealed to this court.\r\nOn January 27, 2007, McGrier was again released to the CSP.Â  On\r\n  April 2, 2007, he appeared before the trial judge for alleged violations and\r\n  raised the same constitutional challenge.Â  The trial judge revoked McGrierâ€™s CSP\r\n  and ordered McGrier to serve six months.Â  McGrier appealed and the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court reversed.Â  See State v. McGrier #2,\r\n  Op. No. 26489 (S.C. Sup. Ct. refiled June 23, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 26\r\n  at 24).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppealing the\r\n  October 30, 2006 revocation and sentence, McGrier argues the trial judge erred\r\n  in not finding section 24-21-460(D) of the South Carolina Code unconstitutional\r\n  as applied to him.Â  Based on the supreme courtâ€™s analysis in McGrier #2,\r\n  we agree.\r\n\r\n\tThe CSP statute\r\n  provides: \r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe maximum aggregate amount of time the\r\n  prisoner may be required to serve when sentenced for successive revocations may\r\n  not exceed an amount of time equal to the length of incarceration imposed for\r\n  the original â€œno parole offense.â€ The original term of incarceration does not\r\n  include any portion of a suspended sentence.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(D)\r\n  (2007).Â  In McGrier #2, the supreme court stated:\r\n\r\n\tWe now read this language as limiting the total amount of time an inmate could be incarcerated\r\n  after a CSP revocation to be the length of the remaining balance of the sentence\r\n  for the â€˜no parole offense.â€™ Based on this interpretation, a circuit court may\r\n  not impose a sentence for a CSP revocation that would result in an inmate being\r\n  incarcerated for an aggregate period of time that extended beyond the\r\n  unsuspended portion of the original sentence. Thus, assuming an inmate has\r\n  served at least eighty-five percent of the unsuspended portion of his original\r\n  sentence, an inmate whose CSP is revoked is limited to serving an amount of\r\n  time equal to the remaining fifteen percent balance of this sentence. \r\n\r\nMcGrier #2 at 36.Â  As McGrier has served eighty-five percent of\r\n  the original, three-year term of imprisonment and has served CSP revocation\r\n  time of more than the time remaining on his original sentence, the decision of\r\n  the trial judge is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We\r\n  decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-339","title":"Hobbithouser v.

Baxley, of Lugoff, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDaniel D. Dâ€™Agostino, of York, for Respondents and\r\n\t\t\t\tThomas L. Crosby, Jr., pro se, of Matthews.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this action to foreclose a real estate mortgage, Hobbithouser, LLC (Hobbithouser)\r\n  appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s finding that Thomas L. Crosby, Jr.â€™s payments on\r\n  two promissory notes extinguished the notes and the related mortgage.Â  We affirm.[1] Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  October 13, 1999, Crosby secured personal loans made to him by Carolina First\r\n  Bank (Carolina First) by mortgaging approximately 164 acres in York County (York Property).Â  Subsequently, in an unrelated action, J &amp; A Construction,\r\n  Inc. obtained and recorded a judgment against Crosby.Â  Crosby failed to pay the\r\n  judgment and the sheriff levied on the York Property.Â  On July 10, 2002, after\r\n  two execution sales, the sheriff deeded the York Property to J &amp; A\r\n  Construction, the high bidder at both sales. \r\nAfter\r\n  the York Property was levied, but prior to the execution sales, Crosby executed two promissory notes to Carolina First.Â  The first note (Note One), in the\r\n  amount of $374,307.77, refinanced the original loan from October 1999 and was\r\n  secured by the York Property.Â  The second note (Note Two), in the amount of\r\n  $153,071.71, was cross-collateralized by the October 1999 mortgage on the York\r\n  Property.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 21, 2003 and November 28, 2003, more than a year after J &amp; A\r\n  Construction acquired the York Property, Crosby, using his personal funds, paid\r\n  Carolina First in full for both notes.Â  Thereafter, on December 3, 2003,\r\n  Carolina First assigned Note One, Note Two, and the October 1999 mortgage to\r\n  Hobbithouser, a South Carolina corporation in which Crosby owns an eighty\r\n  percent interest.Â  The assignment was subsequently filed on June 14, 2004. \r\nMeanwhile,\r\n  on November 24, 2003, Crosby wrote a check to himself from the Hobbithouser\r\n  account in the amount of $1,339,129.80 when Hobbithouserâ€™s account contained approximately\r\n  $200.Â  The next day, Crosby made a deposit from his personal account into the Hobbithouser\r\n  account in the exact same amount as written on the check.[2]Â  \r\nSometime\r\n  after the York Property was deeded to J &amp; A Construction and the notes and\r\n  mortgage were assigned to Hobbithouser, Hobbithouser claimed J &amp; A\r\n  Construction failed to timely make interest payments on the notes.Â  On December\r\n  22, 2005, Hobbithouser filed this action against Crosby, J &amp; A Construction,\r\n  and Joe A. Daves to foreclose the mortgage on the York Property.Â  After a non-jury\r\n  trial, the master denied Hobbithouserâ€™s claim for foreclosure of the mortgage\r\n  and directed the clerk of court to satisfy the mortgage.Â  The master also\r\n  denied Hobbithouserâ€™s motion to reconsider.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to foreclose a real estate mortgage is an\r\n  action in equity.â€Â  BB&amp;T of South Carolina v. Kidwell, 350 S.C. 382,\r\n  387, 565 S.E.2d 316, 319 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In an action in equity, we may\r\n  review the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Smith v. Barr, 375 S.C. 157, 160, 650 S.E.2d 486, 488 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007).Â  However, we need not disregard the factual findings of the master,\r\n  who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their\r\n  credibility.Â  Id.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Payments to Carolina First\r\nHobbithouser\r\n  argues the master erred in finding Crosbyâ€™s payments to Carolina First\r\n  extinguished his debt.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Jeffcoat\r\n  v. Morris, the court considered whether a receiver of a debtor, who\r\n  purchased a debtorâ€™s note by paying off the debt, could sue the co-maker of the\r\n  debtorâ€™s note.Â  300 S.C. 526, 389 S.E.2d 159 (Ct. App. 1989), overruled by United Carolina Bank v. Caroprop, 316 S.C. 1, 446 S.E.2d 415 (1994).[3]Â \r\n  After reviewing North Carolina and Virginia case law, the court held â€œpayment\r\n  of a note by a maker, or an appointed receiver of the maker, operates to\r\n  extinguish the note, discharging the liability of any co-makers on the note.â€Â  Id. at 529, 389 S.E.2d at 161.Â  The court reasoned that â€œ[t]o allow a maker of a\r\n  note, or one who stands in the shoes of that person, to acquire an assignment\r\n  of the note and then sue his co-makers on the note would open the doors to\r\n  possible abuse and sharp dealing.â€Â  Id. \r\nSimilarly,\r\n  in Ives v. Rutland, a purchaser of property took the property subject to\r\n  a mortgage, paid the bank in full for the mortgage, and then rather than\r\n  satisfying the mortgage, requested the bank assign it to him.Â  The court held\r\n  the mortgage â€œbecame a dead paperâ€ when the purchaser paid it off, thus there\r\n  were no rights to assign.Â  135 S.C. 173, 182, 133 S.E. 539, 541 (1926). Â See\r\n    also 59 C.J.S. Mortgages Â§ 460 (1998) (stating that payment of a mortgage\r\n  debt generally discharges the mortgage and terminates the mortgageeâ€™s rights).\r\nHere,\r\n  Crosby paid off his debt in full and then secured an assignment to\r\n  Hobbithouser, a company in which he owned an eighty percent interest.Â  In\r\n  accordance with South Carolina jurisprudence, Crosbyâ€™s two notes and mortgage\r\n  were extinguished when he, as the sole debtor on the notes and mortgage, paid\r\n  the debts in full.Â  Once the debts were paid, the mortgage was satisfied and\r\n  there were no rights to assign to Hobbithouser.Â  Therefore, J &amp; A\r\n  Constructionâ€™s judgment lien assumed the status of a first lien on the real\r\n  property, and J &amp; A Constructionâ€™s purchase of the property at the\r\n  execution sale was free and clear from the prior lien of the mortgage.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Agent of Hobbithouser\r\nHobbithouser\r\n  also contends the master erred in finding Crosby acted in an individual\r\n  capacity when he paid off his debts because he was acting as an agent for\r\n  Hobbithouser.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial and in its motion to reconsider, Hobbithouser argued Crosby made the\r\n  payment on its behalf; however, it did not specifically raise any agency\r\n  arguments.Â  See Collins Entmâ€™t Corp. v. Coats &amp; Coats Rental\r\n    Amusement, 368 S.C. 410, 418, 629 S.E.2d 635, 639 (2006) (finding a\r\n  general, non-specific argument that does not encompass the specific grounds\r\n  raised on appeal does not preserve the issue).Â  Accordingly, this argument is\r\n  not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Defense\r\n  of Avoidance\r\nHobbithouser\r\n  argues the master erred in admitting evidence constituting the defense of\r\n  avoidance because J &amp; A Construction failed to plead it as a defense.Â  This\r\n  issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Â Â \r\nHobbithouser did\r\n  not make this argument to the master.Â  Because this argument was not raised to\r\n  or ruled upon by the master, it is not preserved for our review.Â  See Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (stating an\r\n  argument raised for the first time on appeal is not preserved for appellate\r\n  review).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the order on appeal is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We\r\n  decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Crosby testified the money he deposited was\r\n  payment to him from an unrelated land sale. \r\n[3]&nbsp; Jeffcoat was overruled â€œat least to the\r\n  extent that it prevents a mortgagor from being equitably subrogated to rights\r\n  of a mortgagee.â€ Â Williams v.

(Father) appeal from the family courtâ€™s order\r\n  terminating their parental rights (TPR).Â  Mother and Father argue the family\r\n  court erred in finding TPR was in Childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  We disagree.\r\n1. We\r\n  affirm the family courtâ€™s finding Children resided in foster care, under the\r\n  responsibility of the state, for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2007)\r\n  (stating the family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven\r\n  statutory grounds is satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best interest of\r\n  the child); S.C.

Furthermore,\r\n  despite parentsâ€™ arguments to the contrary, our\r\n  review of the record indicates termination of both parentsâ€™ rights is in\r\n  Childrenâ€™s best interests: Children have resided in foster care for the\r\n  majority of their lives; Children are thriving with their foster family; and\r\n  the foster parents plan to adopt Children.Â  See S.C.

Mixon, of Monks Corner, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Emory\r\n  Brown appeals the order of the master finding the tax sale of Blondell Terryâ€™s\r\n  property was void.Â  Specifically, Brown maintains the tax sale notices did not\r\n  violate the statutory requirements and Terry waived her rights to challenge the\r\n  tax sale by accepting the surplus proceeds of the sale.Â  We affirm.[1] Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nTerry\r\n  failed to timely pay her taxes for the year 2001.Â  Pursuant to statutory\r\n  authority, the county mailed Terry a notice of delinquency.Â  When thirty days passed\r\n  with no response, the county mailed Terry a certified notice with restrictive\r\n  delivery, which was returned unclaimed after three attempts to notify Terry.Â  Because\r\n  Terry did not claim her notice, the county posted a tax sale notice on Terryâ€™s\r\n  property.Â  The county also advertised the sale of the property in the local\r\n  newspaper for three consecutive weeks.Â  Brown was the successful bidder at the\r\n  tax sale and obtained the tax deed for the property on March 18, 2004.Â  After\r\n  the tax sale, Terry was notified by mail she was entitled to a check for the surplus\r\n  proceeds of the sale of her property, which she picked up and deposited into\r\n  her bank account.\r\nAfter\r\n  the tax sale, Terry brought an action to set aside the tax deed based on\r\n  defects in the sale.Â  On June 23, 2006, the matter was referred to the master\r\n  and the case was tried on October 3, 2006.Â  During the trial, Terry testified\r\n  she was unaware the check came from the sale of her property.Â  Terry also\r\n  testified she never received notice by mail or posting that her house was going\r\n  to be sold at a tax sale.Â  Terryâ€™s son, who lived with his mother, also\r\n  testified he never saw a posting on the land.Â  During the trial, the defendants\r\n  did not present a copy of the notice of delinquent property taxes mailed to\r\n  Terry.Â  The defendants also did not present any testimony from the employees\r\n  who posted the notice on Terryâ€™s land or from the clerk who gave Terry the\r\n  check from the sale of her land.\r\nOn\r\n  March 1, 2007, the master entered a final order finding the tax sale void for\r\n  defects in the notices that created artificial deadlines and contradicted the\r\n  statutory language.Â  The master also found Terry did not waive her rights to\r\n  challenge the tax sale even though she accepted and deposited a check for the\r\n  surplus proceeds from the sale of her property.Â  Brown filed a Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP, motion to reconsider, which was denied after a hearing on the motion.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â  Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œOur scope of review for a case heard by a [m]aster\r\n  permits us to determine facts in accordance with our own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Smith v. Barr, 375 S.C. 157, 160, 650\r\n  S.E.2d 486, 488 (Ct. App. 2007); see also Folk v. Thomas, 344\r\n  S.C. 77, 80, 543 S.E.2d 556, 557 (2001) (finding an action to set aside a tax\r\n  deed rests in equity, thus, an appellate court may take its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence). Â However, we are not required to disregard the\r\n  factual findings of the master, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a\r\n  better position to judge their credibility.Â  Smith, 375 at 160, 650\r\n  S.E.2d at 488.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Delinquent\r\n  Tax Notices\r\nBrown\r\n  alleges the master erred by ruling the tax sale notices contained artificial\r\n  deadlines for the payment of taxes, rendering the tax sale void.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 12-51-40 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code provides the procedure for notifying delinquent taxpayers\r\n  that property will be sold to collect owed tax monies.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-51-40 (Supp. 2007).Â  Tax sales of property pursuant to the statute must be\r\n  conducted in strict compliance with its requirements.Â  In re Ryan Inv. Co.,\r\n  335 S.C. 392, 395, 517 S.E.2d 692, 693 (1999).Â  In Rives v. Bulsa, 325\r\n  S.C. 287, 293, 478 S.E.2d 878, 881 (Ct. App. 1996), the court determined the\r\n  notice provision in the statute is a jurisdictional requirement:\r\n\r\n  [T]he\r\n    general law is that where a statute requires as a condition precedent to\r\n    foreclosing a taxpayerâ€™s rights in property sold for taxes that he be given\r\n    notice of his right to redeem, such a requirement is generally regarded as\r\n    jurisdictional, and therefore, the ownerâ€™s right of redemption cannot be cut\r\n    off unless the required notice is given.Â  \r\n\r\nÂ â€œFailure to give the\r\n  required notice is a fundamental defect in the tax proceedings which renders the\r\n  proceedings absolutely void.â€Â  Id.\r\nSection 12-51-40(b)\r\n  mandates â€œ[a]ll delinquent notices shall specify that if the taxes,\r\n  assessments, penalties, and costs are not paid before a subsequent sales\r\n    date, the property must be duly advertised and sold for delinquent property\r\n  taxes, assessments, penalties, and costs.â€ (emphasis added). Â Section 12-51-40(c)\r\n  further provides if a certified mail notice is returned, a notice must be\r\n  posted â€œat one or more conspicuous places on the premises, in the case of real\r\n  estate, reading: â€˜Seized by person officially charged with the collection of\r\n  delinquent taxes of (name of political subdivision) to be sold for delinquent\r\n  taxes.â€™â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40 (Supp. 2007).\r\nIn Hawkins v.\r\n  Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 577 S.E.2d 202 (2003), the supreme court\r\n  held the two notices at issue created artificial deadlines for payment, which contradicted\r\n  the statutory language.Â  The language in the first notice stated, â€œ[i]f not\r\n  paid on or before 31 August this property will be duly advertised and sold for\r\n  delinquent taxes as described above on the first Monday in October this year.â€Â  Id. at 37, 577 S.E.2d at 205.Â  The second notice stated the property\r\n  was subject to a sale on October 2, but also provided â€œ[a]ll tax payments must\r\n  be received by September 15, 1995 to avoid your name and property being\r\n  advertised in The Beaufort Gazette and The Island Packet.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe supreme\r\n  court found the August and September deadlines were artificial because the\r\n  sales date was October 2, and the deadlines gave the impression the taxes had\r\n  to be paid weeks before the sale date.Â  Id. at 38, 577 S.E.2d at 206.Â \r\n  The court added â€œthe statute does not provide that the County set a date, other\r\n  than the sales date, after which the taxpayer can no longer pay his delinquent\r\n  taxes before the County can begin advertising.â€Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  the notice mailed to Terry set the date of sale for her property as November,\r\n  4, 2002; however, the notice also provided, â€œif the outstanding taxes,\r\n  assessments, penalties and costs due on the property described below are not\r\n  paid before October 10, 2002, the property must be advertised for sale in a\r\n  newspaper of general circulation.â€Â  The additional language in the notice gave\r\n  the impression Terry had to pay the taxes weeks before the date of sale, which created\r\n  an artificial deadline for payment of taxes before the set sales date of November\r\n  4, 2002.Â  Additionally, the notice posted on Terryâ€™s property set the sale date\r\n  as November, 4, 2002, but contained additional language stating â€œif not paid by\r\n  October 10, 2002 a total cost $100.00 will accrue [for expenses related to the\r\n  levy, seizure, and sale of the property].â€Â  This language also created an\r\n  artificial deadline.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  because the tax sale notices contained additional language and dates other than\r\n  the sales date, they created artificial deadlines that contradicted the\r\n  statutory language.Â  See id.Â  Thus, the master correctly found\r\n  the tax sale was void.\r\nII.Â \r\n  Surplus Proceeds\r\nÂ Brown\r\n  also asserts Terry waived her right to object to the sale by accepting and\r\n  depositing a check for the surplus proceeds of the tax sale.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  waiver is a voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a known\r\n  right.â€Â  Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Prop. Regime, 307\r\n  S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1992).Â  â€œGenerally, the party claiming\r\n  waiver must show that the party against whom waiver is asserted possessed, at\r\n  the time, actual or constructive knowledge of his rights or of all the material\r\n  facts upon which they depended.â€Â  Id. at 344, 415 S.E.2d at 387-88. Â â€œThe\r\n  burden of proof of waiver is on the party asserting it.â€Â  NationsBank v.\r\n    Scott Farm, 320 S.C. 299, 303, 465 S.E.2d 98, 100 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nThe\r\n  master found Brown did not present any credible evidence to establish Terry\r\n  intended to waive her rights to challenge the tax sale.Â  Terry testified she\r\n  was unaware the money was from the tax sale of her property.Â  Brown did not\r\n  present any testimony to rebut Terryâ€™s testimony.Â  Therefore, the master\r\n  correctly found Terry did not waive her claims against Brown regarding the sale\r\n  of her property.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the master is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\nC.J., and SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-414","title":"State v.

Â§ 26.1 (2007).Â  As a recipient of federal highway\r\n  funding, South Carolina created its DBE program through section 12-28-2930 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2000), requiring SCDOT to expend a minimum amount of\r\n  state source highway funds through contracts with DBEs.Â  \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolinaâ€™s DBE program is regulated under\r\n  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 63-700 to 63-718 (Supp. 2007).Â  Under 25A S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Reg. 63-702, to be eligible for participation in both the federal and\r\n  state DBE programs in South Carolina, a firm must first be certified by SCDOT\r\n  â€œas a bona fide [DBE] pursuant to the standards and procedures set forth in\r\n  Regulations 63-703 and 63-704 and 49 C.F.R. Part 26.â€Â  The South Carolina\r\n  regulations incorporate the federal standards for determining DBE status found\r\n  in 49 C.F.R. Â§ 26.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the applicable regulations, a DBE is defined as a for-profit small business,\r\n  which is owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are both socially\r\n  and economically disadvantaged.Â  49 C.F.R. Â§ 26.5 (2007); 25A S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Reg. 63-701 (Supp. 2007).Â  To meet the ownership requirement, â€œa firm must be\r\n  at least 51 percent owned by socially and economically disadvantaged\r\n  individuals.â€Â  49 C.F.R. Â§ 26.69(b) (2007). Â Under the regulations, women are\r\n  presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged individuals but must still\r\n  show they have a net worth not exceeding $750,000 to qualify as a disadvantaged\r\n  individual.Â  49 C.F.R. Â§ 26.67(a)(1) - (2)(i) (2007).Â  In this appeal, SCDOT\r\n  argues L.A. Barrier is not entitled to certification as a DBE because it does\r\n  not meet the ownership requirements of 49 C.F.R. Â§ 26.69 (2007).Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nL.A. Barrier is a\r\n  closely held corporation in the business of hauling and transporting road\r\n  construction materials. Â L.A. Barrier is one of three corporations owned by\r\n  members of the Barrier and Tyson families in Lexington, South Carolina.Â  The\r\n  other two corporations are B &amp; T Sand Co., Inc. (B &amp; T Sand) and B\r\n  &amp; T Investments, Inc. (B &amp; T Investments). \r\nPrior\r\n  to July 1, 2006, Betty Tyson (Betty) owned 25,000 shares of L.A. Barrierâ€™s\r\n  stock, while Bill Barrier (Bill) and Bob Barrier (Bob) each owned 12,000\r\n  shares, and Electa Barrier (Electa) owned 1,000 shares.Â  On or about July 1,\r\n  2006, Betty transferred all 25,000 of her shares without consideration to Lisa\r\n  Tyson (Lisa), who is married to Bettyâ€™s son, Joel Tyson (Joel).Â  Also on or\r\n  about July 1, 2006, Electa transferred 500 shares to Lisa for $4,210. Â Lisa\r\n  paid for the shares using funds from a joint checking account she shared with\r\n  Joel.Â  At the time of the transfers, Bettyâ€™s net worth exceeded $750,000, so\r\n  she no longer qualified as a disadvantaged individual.Â  After the two\r\n  transfers, Lisa, the new president of L.A. Barrier, owned fifty-one percent of\r\n  L.A. Barrierâ€™s stock.Â Â  \r\nOn July 31, 2006,\r\n  L.A. Barrier applied to SCDOT for certification as a DBE.Â  Subsequently, in a letter\r\n  dated December 8, 2006, SCDOT denied the application.Â  The letter outlined\r\n  SCDOTâ€™s reasons for denying certification, including: (1) Betty was involved in\r\n  an affiliate firm through her ownership of stock in B &amp; T Sand; (2) Betty\r\n  was engaged in a business relationship with L.A. Barrier as its landlord\r\n  because she owned a one-half interest in the building and property where L.A.\r\n  Barrier operates; and (3) Joel had not renounced his interest in the ownership\r\n  interest of the 500 shares Lisa purchased using funds from their joint checking\r\n  account.Â  After receiving SCDOTâ€™s letter, L.A. Barrier requested a contested\r\n  case hearing before the ALC.\r\nBetween\r\n  the time of SCDOTâ€™s denial of certification and the contested case hearing,\r\n  Betty and Joel took several steps to correct the errors causing SCDOTâ€™s denial\r\n  of L.A. Barrierâ€™s application.Â  On April 9, 2007, Betty transferred her\r\n  one-half interest in the building and real estate where L.A. Barrier operates\r\n  to Tommy Tyson (Tommy), her husband, without consideration.Â  On the same day,\r\n  she transferred all of her stock in B &amp; T Sand to Joel, her son, without\r\n  consideration.Â  Lastly, Joel signed a document renouncing his interest in the\r\n  500 shares of stock purchased with funds from the joint checking account he\r\n  shared with Lisa. \r\nThe contested case\r\n  hearing was held on May 1 and 2, 2007.Â  Ultimately, the ALC determined L.A.\r\n  Barrier qualified for DBE certification and ordered SCDOT to grant L.A.\r\n  Barrierâ€™s application.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSection 1-23-610 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007)\r\n  sets forth the standard of review when the Court of Appeals\r\n  is sitting in review of a decision by the ALC on appeal\r\n  from an administrative agency.Â  â€œThe review of the administrative law judgeâ€™s\r\n  order must be confined to the record.â€Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-610(C). Â Under section 1-23-610(C), the Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  may affirm the decision or\r\n    remand the case for further proceedings; or [the Court] may reverse or modify\r\n    the decision if the substantive rights of the petitioner [have] been prejudiced\r\n    because [] the finding, conclusion, or decision is:\r\n  \r\n    (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory\r\n      provisions;\r\n    (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the\r\n      agency;\r\n    (c) made upon\r\n      unlawful procedure;\r\n    (d)\r\n      affected by other error of law;\r\n    (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable,\r\n      probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n    (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse\r\n      of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSCDOT\r\n  argues L.A. Barrier does not qualify as a DBE because Joel did not effectively\r\n  renounce his interest in the 500 shares of stock Lisa acquired with funds from\r\n  their joint checking account, and as a result, Lisa does not have sole\r\n  ownership of fifty-one percent of the firm.Â  Specifically, SCDOT argues: (1)\r\n  while Joel renounced his interest in the stock, he did not also renounce his\r\n  interest in the jointly held assets used to purchase the stock, and (2) the\r\n  document whereby Joel renounced his interest in the stock was not included in\r\n  L.A. Barrierâ€™s application for certification.Â Â  We agree.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  49 C.F.R. Â§ 26.69(i) (2007), when marital assets are used to acquire a\r\n  disadvantaged individualâ€™s ownership interest in a business or firm, the finder\r\n  of fact must apply the following rules: \r\n\r\n  (1)\r\n    When marital assets (other than the assets of the business in question), held\r\n    jointly or as community property by both spouses, are used to acquire the\r\n    ownership interest asserted by one spouse, [the entity determining DBE status]\r\n    must deem the ownership interest in the firm to have been acquired by that\r\n    spouse with his or her own individual resources, provided that the other spouse\r\n    irrevocably renounces and transfers all rights in the ownership interest in the\r\n    manner sanctioned by the laws of the state in which either spouse or the firm\r\n    is domiciled. . . . \r\n  (2) A\r\n    copy of the document legally transferring and renouncing the other spouseâ€™s\r\n    rights in the jointly owned or community assets used to acquire an ownership\r\n    interest in the firm must be included as part of the firmâ€™s application for DBE\r\n    certification.\r\n\r\nLooking at the language of the section as a whole, it\r\n  is clear the purpose of the regulation is to ensure the ownership interest is\r\n  solely attributable to the disadvantaged individual for the purpose of\r\n  determining whether the firm meets the fifty-one percent threshold of 49 C.F.R.\r\n  Â§ 26.69(b).Â  While 49 C.F.R. Â§ 26.69(i) sets forth the general rule that some\r\n  portion of the ownership interest is attributable to the disadvantaged\r\n  individualâ€™s spouse if marital assets are used to purchase the ownership\r\n  interest, the section also provides an exception when the spouse has renounced\r\n  his or her portion of the ownership interest.Â  \r\nHowever, subsections (1) and (2) of 49 C.F.R. Â§\r\n  26.69(i) address the method of renunciation differently.Â  While subsection (1)\r\n  mandates that the ALC must treat an ownership interest as being acquired with the\r\n  individualâ€™s own funds when the spouse has renounced any rights in the ownership\r\n    interest, subsection (2) refers to renunciation of the assets used\r\n  to acquire the ownership interest.Â  \r\nSCDOT first argues Joel must have renounced his\r\n  interest in the assets used to acquire the stock in addition to the stock\r\n  itself to comply with the terms of 49 C.F.R. 26.69(i).Â  We agree. \r\nWhen the terms of a statute are clear, the court must\r\n  apply those terms according to their literal meaning. Â Paschal v. State\r\n    Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 436, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995). Â This Court\r\n  cannot construe a statute without regard to its ordinary and plain meaning and\r\n  may not resort to a forced interpretation in an effort to expand or limit the\r\n  scope of a statute. Â Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, 55, 426 S.E.2d 760,\r\n  763 (1993).Â  Furthermore, â€œthe construction of a statute by the agency charged\r\n  with its administration will be accorded the most respectful consideration and\r\n  will not be overruled absent compelling reasons.â€ Â Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of\r\n    Examâ€™rs in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987).Â  \r\nL.A. Barrier argues a renunciation of the 500 shares\r\n  of stock is sufficient to comply with the statute; however, a plain reading of\r\n  the statute demonstrates otherwise.Â  Because Lisa purchased the 500 shares of\r\n  stock with funds from Joel and Lisaâ€™s joint checking account, the statute\r\n  mandates that SCDOT apply 49 C.F.R. Â§ 26.69(i).Â  The plain language of 49\r\n  C.F.R. Â§ 26.69(i) requires the non-disadvantaged spouse to renounce both the rights in the ownership interest and the rights in the jointly owned assets\r\n  used to acquire the ownership interest.Â  See 49 C.F.R. Â§ 26.69(i)(1) - (2).Â  \r\nAlthough Joel may have satisfied 49 C.F.R. Â§\r\n  26.69(i)(1) by renouncing his interest in the stock by the date of the hearing,\r\n  he failed to satisfy 49 C.F.R. Â§ 26.69(i)(2) by never renouncing his ownership\r\n  interest in the joint checking account.Â  While we recognize the 500 shares of\r\n  stock represent a very small portion of the overall ownership interest, the\r\n  fact remains without a full and proper renunciation, these shares must be\r\n  attributed in part to Joel, such that Lisaâ€™s ownership interest falls short of\r\n  the fifty-one percent ownership requirement set forth in 49 C.F.R. Â§ 26.69(b).Â \r\n  Because L.A. Barrier did not meet the eligibility requirements of 49 C.F.R. Â§\r\n  26, SCDOT properly denied its application for certification as a DBE.Â  See 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 63-703(A) (stating SCDOT â€œwill certify a firm as a bona\r\n  fide DBE under the State or Federal DBE Program if [SCDOT] determines that the\r\n  firm meets the eligibility requirements of 49 C.F.R. Part 26â€).\r\nIn\r\n  light of our holding on this issue, it is not necessary to address SCDOTâ€™s\r\n  remaining arguments.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, 335 S.C.\r\n  598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (providing that an appellate court need\r\n  not address additional issues if the resolution of another issue is\r\n  dispositive). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the ALCâ€™s order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWILLIAMS, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-419","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka,\r\n  Senior Assisant Attorney General William Edgar Salter, III, all of Columbia;\r\n  and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Damon Jacquise Jones (Jones)\r\n  appeals his conviction for murder, contending the trial court erred by not\r\n  admitting his videotaped interrogation into evidence.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn late 2005, Jones\r\n  stood trial for the murder of Sigida Long (Sigida).Â  Jones testified to the\r\n  events surrounding this incident.Â  According to his testimony, on February 25,\r\n  2005, Jones, Ben Foster (Foster), and Gregg Hardy (Hardy) were at Hardyâ€™s\r\n  sisterâ€™s house drinking beer.Â  Subsequently, Jones drove Hardy and Foster to Jonesâ€™\r\n  grandmotherâ€™s house to drop off Foster.Â  Upon arrival, Hardy helped Foster, who\r\n  was intoxicated, to the door.Â  While Jones remained in the car, the victim,\r\n  Sigida, and his brother, Atiba Long (Atiba), drove into their driveway next\r\n  door.[1] Sigida and Atiba then exited their vehicle and knocked on the door of Jonesâ€™\r\n  grandmotherâ€™s house in an attempt to get Foster to come outside.Â  Unable to get\r\n  Foster outside, Sigida walked over to Jonesâ€™ vehicle and pulled Jones out of\r\n  the car.Â Â Â  \r\nSigida hit Jones in\r\n  the head a few times, causing Jones to fall back into his vehicle.Â  Jones then\r\n  grabbed a gun out of the glove compartment, exited the vehicle, cocked the\r\n  weapon and told Sigida and Atiba to back up.Â  Sigida rushed Jones, and a\r\n  struggle ensued.Â  During the struggle, the gun discharged, striking and fatally\r\n  wounding Sigida.Â  Jones then ran into his grandmotherâ€™s house and instructed\r\n  his aunt to call the police.Â  \r\nFollowing the shooting, Sergeant Christopher Taylor,\r\n  of the Spartanburg Public Safety Department, questioned Jones about the\r\n  incident, and this interrogation was videotaped.Â  After Jones testified about\r\n  the events of the incident and his distraught and overwhelmed emotional state\r\n  following the shooting, Jonesâ€™ counsel attempted to admit the videotaped\r\n  interrogation into evidence.Â  The State objected to the videotapeâ€™s admission,\r\n  characterizing the evidence as self-serving hearsay.Â  Additionally, the State\r\n  argued because it did not introduce any statements from the videotape, Jones\r\n  could not introduce it to bolster his testimony.Â  The trial court sustained the\r\n  Stateâ€™s objection, finding Jonesâ€™ statements on the tape â€œexactly or quite\r\n  similarâ€ to his testimony.Â Â Â  \r\nDefense counsel\r\n  later called Hardy to testify.Â  Hardy gave his recollection of events and also\r\n  described Jones as being â€œin shockâ€ and â€œhystericalâ€ following the shooting.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury found Jones guilty of murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.Â \r\n  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases,\r\n  the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€Â  State v. Baccus,\r\n  367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  â€œThe admission of evidence is\r\n  within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d\r\n  262, 265 (2006).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  conclusions either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of\r\n  law.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJones\r\n  contends the trial court erred by excluding his videotaped interrogation from\r\n  evidence.Â  In the alternative, Jones argues the portion of the videotape prior\r\n  to his interrogation is not hearsay and was, therefore, improperly excluded.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  improper exclusion of evidence is harmless when it is cumulative to other\r\n  testimony in the record.Â  State v. Sapp, 366 S.C. 283, 294, 621 S.E.2d\r\n  883, 888 (2005).Â  Thus, even if the exclusion of cumulative evidence is\r\n  erroneous, it will not warrant a reversal by this Court.Â  State v. Pipkin,\r\n  359 S.C. 322, 328, 597 S.E.2d 831, 834 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Jones argued the shooting took place while he was acting in self-defense.Â \r\n  Jones testified as to the events surrounding the incident as well as his mental\r\n  state following the shooting.Â  Additionally, Hardy gave his recollection of the\r\n  incident and testified Jones was â€œin shockâ€ and â€œhystericalâ€ following the\r\n  shooting.Â  \r\nDue\r\n  to this testimony, the videotape would have been merely cumulative to evidence\r\n  in the record.Â  The statements on the videotape were found to be â€œexactly or\r\n  quite similarâ€ to Jonesâ€™ testimony, and the jury was told multiple times about\r\n  Jonesâ€™ mental state following the shooting.Â  Jonesâ€™ counsel sought to admit the\r\n  videotape into evidence to corroborate Jonesâ€™ testimony rather than to present\r\n  any new evidence to the jury.[2]Â \r\n  Because of its cumulative nature, even if the evidence was improperly excluded,\r\n  the error was merely harmless.Â  See Sapp, 366 S.C. at 294, 621\r\n  S.E.2d at 888 (finding the exclusion of evidence is harmless if it is\r\n  cumulative to other testimony in the record).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find no reversible error in the exclusion of the videotape and, therefore, do\r\n  not address whether each portion of the videotape was inadmissible hearsay.Â  See Hughes v. State, 367 S.C. 389, 408-09, 626 S.E.2d 805, 815 (2006)\r\n  (finding appellate courts need not address remaining issues when determination\r\n  of prior issue is dispositive).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.[3] \r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Longs lived\r\n  beside Jonesâ€™ grandmother.Â  \r\n[2] We additionally\r\n  note the State never made an issue of Jonesâ€™ statements on the videotape or his\r\n  mental state following the shooting.Â  \r\n[3] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-425","title":"State v.

Nichols, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tFrederick L. Harris, of Myrtle Beach; and George M. Hearn, Jr., of\r\n  Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jon Christopher Nobles (Husband) appeals the family court order granting Carie\r\n  Nobles (Wife) a divorce, arguing the family court erred in its determination of\r\n  marital property, valuation of special equity interests, and equitable division\r\n  of the marital estate.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nI.&nbsp; Background\r\nHusband\r\n  and Wife were high school sweethearts and became engaged while attending Clemson University.Â  Husband graduated from Clemson in December 1993, and obtained\r\n  employment as a credit manager for Heilig-Myers Furniture in Columbia, South Carolina.Â  Husband and Wife married on May 20, 1995.Â  Shortly thereafter, Husband was\r\n  transferred to Griffin, Georgia, as a Heilig-Myers store manager.Â  Wife graduated\r\n  from Clemson in December 1995, and joined Husband in Griffin.Â  In July 1996,\r\n  Husband was transferred to Jacksonville, Florida, where he eventually managed three\r\n  Heilig-Myers stores and earned approximately $100,000 per year.Â  Wife also\r\n  obtained employment in Jacksonville at the Florida Department of Health as a\r\n  health educator earning $28,000 per year.\r\nIn early 2001, Husband lost his job with Heilig-Myers when the\r\n  retail chain filed for bankruptcy.Â  Consequently, Husband and Wife returned to South Carolina to open a franchise furniture store in Myrtle Beach.Â  In March 2001, while\r\n  making plans to leave Jacksonville, Wife became pregnant.Â  Approximately five months\r\n  later, the parties moved to North Myrtle Beach and their first child, Sarah,\r\n  was born in November 2001.Â  Following the birth of Sarah, Husband and Wife\r\n  moved into a new home with financial contributions provided by Wifeâ€™s parents.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Noble Enterprises\r\n  of the Carolinas\r\nWith the proceeds from the sale of their home in Jacksonville and\r\n  Husbandâ€™s 401(k), the parties opened Norwalk: The Furniture Idea (Norwalk), a franchise, under the name Noble Enterprises of the Carolinas, LLC, the\r\n  franchisee.Â  Based upon his management experience in the furniture business,\r\n  Husband served as Norwalkâ€™s managing partner.Â  Husband, his mother and father,\r\n  and Wife each owned a twenty-five percent interest in the business.Â  While Wife\r\n  occasionally assisted with the business, she was primarily responsible for\r\n  caring for the coupleâ€™s first child.Â  \r\nAfter Norwalk opened, Husband began staying away from home and became\r\n  less dedicated to his role as managing partner.Â  Consequently, Wife hired\r\n  Pamela Burris as sales manager for Norwalk.Â  Due to Husbandâ€™s increasing\r\n  unavailability, Burris became the de facto manager of the store.Â  By\r\n  December 2005, Husband was working as a waiter and was no longer associated\r\n  with Norwalk.Â  Shortly thereafter, Norwalk ceased operation.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Termination of\r\n  Marriage \r\nHusband began to withdraw from Wife in December 2003, arriving\r\n  home from work no earlier than 8:00 p.m. and sometimes as late as 11:00 p.m.Â  While\r\n  Wife expressed concern regarding Husbandâ€™s absence, he claimed work demanded\r\n  the majority of his time.Â  Husband showed little emotion and continued to\r\n  withdraw from the marriage when Wife became pregnant with the coupleâ€™s second\r\n  child in April 2004.Â  Husband began devoting his time to conducting private,\r\n  secretive activities on his computer, and would shut down the computer when\r\n  Wife entered the room.Â  Although Husband denied having an affair, Wife\r\n  discovered Husband was visiting various pornographic websites and corresponding\r\n  with at least three women twenty to thirty times a day in various internet chat\r\n  rooms. Â Wife also found suspicious text messages of an explicit nature on\r\n  Husbandâ€™s phone and later found out Husband had rented a private post office\r\n  box.Â  Soon thereafter, Husband began refusing Wifeâ€™s phone calls during the day\r\n  and would not return home until Wife had gone to bed.Â  Husbandâ€™s appearance also\r\n  began to change dramatically.Â  Husband joined Goldâ€™s Gym, hired a personal\r\n  trainer, and spent a minimum of three hours every day at the gym even though\r\n  his business was failing.Â  Husbandâ€™s financial excesses included an ongoing\r\n  health club membership, massages, manicures, hair appointments, car washes, and\r\n  lawn care.\r\nOn March 21, 2005, Wife confronted Husband regarding their marital\r\n  problems.Â  In response, Husband requested Wife file for divorce and the parties\r\n  subsequently separated.Â  Wife hired a private investigator who obtained proof\r\n  of Husbandâ€™s relationship with Allison Sides, a fellow member of Goldâ€™s Gym.Â  Wife\r\n  and Wifeâ€™s father also observed Husband on several occasions with Sides, including\r\n  dinner dates and other social gatherings.Â  According to Husband, he engaged in\r\n  sexual relations with Sides only after the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Post-Separation\r\n  and Subsequent Proceedings\r\nSince the separation, Wife and the coupleâ€™s children have continued\r\n  to reside in the marital home.Â  Wife found employment and earns $2,092 gross\r\n  per month.Â  Wife pays approximately $70 per month for the childrenâ€™s medical\r\n  and dental insurance and $953 per month for daycare. Â Immediately after the separation,\r\n  Husband resided with his parents and continued to work as a waiter.Â  However,\r\n  Husband later moved to Jacksonville, Florida with his present girlfriend,\r\n  Danelle Metz, where he still waits tables at a local restaurant.\r\nFollowing Husbandâ€™s relocation to Jacksonville, Wife brought an\r\n  action against Husband seeking a divorce on the ground of adultery, an award of\r\n  separate support and maintenance, use and possession of the marital home,\r\n  custody of the partiesâ€™ two children, child support, alimony, attorneysâ€™ fees,\r\n  and restraining orders against disposing of assets and exposing the children to\r\n  his romantic relationships.Â  In response, Husband counterclaimed for a mutual\r\n  bar to alimony, equitable apportionment of the marital estate, a co-parenting\r\n  arrangement, and an award of attorneysâ€™ fees and court costs.Â  \r\nOn August 22, 2005, the family court issued a temporary order awarding\r\n  Wife primary custody of the children and use of the marital home.Â  The\r\n  temporary order also required Husband pay child support in the amount of $198\r\n  per month based upon his imputed income of $4,000.Â  In addition, Husband was\r\n  ordered to pay $2,000 per month for Wifeâ€™s separate support and maintenance as\r\n  well as $10,000 towards Wifeâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees.\r\nApproximately one year later, the family court issued a final\r\n  order awarding Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery and granting her primary\r\n  custody of the partiesâ€™ two children.Â  In determining child support, the family\r\n  court imputed a monthly income of $4,000 to Husband finding he was voluntarily underemployed and capable\r\n  of earning more given his skills, experience, and expertise.Â  Based upon\r\n  Husbandâ€™s imputed earnings of $4,000 per month, the family court ordered\r\n  Husband to pay $1,114 in monthly child support.Â  With regards to equitable\r\n  division, the family court valued the marital home at $230,000 and distributed\r\n  sixty percent of the marital property to Wife.Â  In dividing the marital debt,\r\n  the family court also noted Wife faced potential liability to the former family\r\n  business based on an action brought against her by Noble Enterprises.Â  However,\r\n  the family court ordered Husband to indemnify Wife against any judgment awarded\r\n  in the pending lawsuit, finding any debt incurred by Noble Enterprises was â€œa\r\n  direct result of Husbandâ€™s failure to dedicate himself to the business and the\r\n  marriage . . . which he abandoned.â€Â  The family court further ordered Husband to\r\n  pay Wifeâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees in the amount of $12,800.Â  Subsequently, Husband filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  motion, which was denied.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an\r\n  appeal from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find the\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Ex\r\n    parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652&nbsp;(2006).Â  However,\r\n  this broad scope of review does not require the appellate court to disregard\r\n  the findings of the family court.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540,\r\n  615 S.E.2d 98, 102&nbsp;(2005).Â  â€œNeither is the\r\n  appellate court required to ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\n  assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Id. at 540, 615\r\n  S.E.2d at 102. &nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Husbandâ€™s Income\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the family court erred in imputing $4,000 per month income to him.Â \r\n  Specifically, Husband asserts the family court erred in finding he was\r\n  voluntarily underemployed and capable of earning $4,000 per month based upon\r\n  his skill, experience, and expertise.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nOur courts\r\n  have held imputing income to a party who is voluntarily unemployed or\r\n  underemployed is proper.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 532, 599 S.E.2d\r\n  114, 123 (2004); Penny v. Green, 357 S.C. 583, 592, 594 S.E.2d 171, 175\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).Â  To prove voluntary underemployment, â€œa parent seeking to\r\n  impute income to the other parent need not establish a bad faith motivation to\r\n  lower a support obligation.â€Â  Arnal v. Arnal, 371 S.C. 10, 13, 636\r\n  S.E.2d 864, 866 (2006).Â  When â€œimput[ing] income to a parent who is unemployed\r\n  or underemployed, the court should determine the employment potential and\r\n  probable earning level of the parent based on that parentâ€™s recent work\r\n  history, occupational qualifications, and prevailing job opportunities and\r\n  earning levels in the community.â€Â  Engle v. Engle, 343 S.C. 444, 449, 539\r\n  S.E.2d 712, 714 (Ct. App. 2000); 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5)(B)\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  â€œWhere a parent voluntarily lessens his or her earning capacity,\r\n  this Court will closely scrutinize the facts to determine the parentâ€™s earning\r\n  potential, rather than the parentâ€™s actual income.â€Â  Id.; see Camp\r\n    v. Camp, 269 S.C. 173, 174-5, 236 S.E.2d 814, 815 (1977); Robinson v.\r\n      Tyson, 319 S.C. 360, 363, 461 S.E.2d 397, 399 (Ct. App. 1995); see also Chastain v. Chastain, 289 S.C. 281, 283, 346 S.E.2d 33, 35 (Ct. App. 1986)\r\n  (finding father with masterâ€™s degree voluntarily removed himself from the job\r\n  market to attend law school and his earning potential was properly considered\r\n  in calculating child support).\r\nHere,\r\n  Husband earned approximately\r\n  $100,000 per year managing three Heilig-Myers stores.Â  The\r\n  parties testified Husband earned at least $4,000 per month while he worked at Norwalk.Â  Also, Husband filed a loan application indicating he was earning $5,000 per\r\n  month.Â  After Husband abandoned Norwalk, he began working as a waiter in Myrtle Beach.Â  A short time later, Husband moved to Florida with his current girlfriend\r\n  where he also works as a waiter.Â  Husband testified he has applied for jobs,\r\n  but has not found one because he is only looking for upper-level management\r\n  jobs.Â  Husband has the ability to get a higher paying job than working as a\r\n  part-time waiter because of his experience and knowledge of the furniture\r\n  business; however, he has chosen to remain underemployed.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  family court did not err by imputing an income of $4,000 per month to\r\n  Husband.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nII.&nbsp; Marital Home\r\nHusband\r\n  avers the family court erred in valuing the martial home at $230,000.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\nThe\r\n  family court has broad discretion in determining how marital property is to be\r\n  valued and distributed; therefore, the court may use any reasonable means to\r\n  divide the property equitably, and its judgment will be disturbed only where an\r\n  abuse of discretion is found.Â  Wooten, 364 S.C. at 541-45, 615 S.E.2d at\r\n  102-05.Â  In reviewing the family courtâ€™s equitable apportionment of marital\r\n  property, an appellate courtâ€™s role is to examine the fairness of the\r\n  apportionment as a whole.Â  Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 24, 553 S.E.2d 251, 255\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Generally, an appellate court will affirm the\r\n  family court if it can be determined the judge addressed the factors under the\r\n  marital property statute sufficiently for the appellate court to conclude the\r\n  judge was cognizant of the statutory factors.Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (1985).Â  Further, the family court may accept the valuation of one\r\n  party over another, and the courtâ€™s valuation of marital property will be affirmed\r\n  if it is within the range of evidence presented.Â  Woodward v. Woodward,\r\n  294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\nAt trial, Wife and her father testified the house was worth about\r\n  $230,000.Â  Also, Husband listed the house as being worth $230,000 on\r\n  refinancing documents.Â  Husband did not present any evidence the house was\r\n  worth more than $230,000; therefore, Husband, after making no effort in valuing\r\n  the marital home, cannot now argue the family courtâ€™s determination is\r\n  unsupported by the evidence.Â  See Hough v. Hough, 312 S.C. 344,\r\n  347, 440 S.E.2d 387, 389 (Ct. App. 1994) (finding because Husband failed to\r\n  offer values for certain household goods at trial, he could not appeal the\r\n  family courtâ€™s valuation of those goods).Â  Furthermore, Husband bears the\r\n  burden in demonstrating the family court committed reversible error.Â  See Honea v. Honea, 292 S.C. 456, 458, 357 S.E.2d 191, 192 (Ct. App. 1987) (explaining\r\n  the burden is on appellant to show the family court committed reversible error,\r\n  and a party cannot sit back at trial without offering proof, then come to the\r\n  appellate court complaining of the insufficiency of evidence to support the\r\n  family courtâ€™s findings).Â  However, Husband provides no evidence that conclusively\r\n  demonstrates the family courtâ€™s findings are incorrect.Â  Even assuming the\r\n  family court erred in its valuation of the marital home, Husband fails to\r\n  establish the error was prejudicial to him. Â Cox v. Cox, 290 S.C. 245, 248,\r\n  349 S.E.2d 92, 93 (Ct. App. 1986) (stating a party cannot complain of an error that\r\n  his own conduct has induced).Â  Therefore, the family court did not err by\r\n  determining the marital home was worth $230,000. Â Â Â \r\nIII.&nbsp; Equitable Division\r\nHusband\r\n  maintains the family court erred in distributing sixty percent of the marital\r\n  property to Wife.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œThe division of marital property is within the discretion of the\r\n  family court judge and the judgeâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.â€ Â Craig\r\n    v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361 (2005). Â Section\r\n  20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) provides\r\n  fifteen factors for the family court to consider in apportioning marital\r\n  property and affords the family court with the discretion to give weight to\r\n  each of these factors â€œas it finds appropriate.â€Â  â€œOn appeal, this court looks\r\n  to the overall fairness of the apportionment and it is irrelevant that this court might have weighed specific factors\r\n  differently than the family court.â€ Â Greene v. Greene, 351\r\n  S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Additionally, â€œ[w]hile there is certainly no recognized\r\n  presumption in favor of a fifty-fifty division, we approve equal division as an\r\n  appropriate starting point for a family court judge attempting to divide an\r\n  estate of a long-term marriage.â€Â  Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 214, 634\r\n  S.E.2d 51, 56 (Ct. App. 2006); see Avery v.\r\n    Avery, 370 S.C. 304, 311, 634 S.E.2d 668,\r\n  672 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  However, â€œthis equal division of marital assets can . . .\r\n  be altered in favor of one spouse depending on the circumstances of each\r\n  case.â€Â  Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 215, 634 S.E.2d 51, 56 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nIn this case, even though Husband and Wife were married for ten\r\n  years, the family court found, and we agree, Husbandâ€™s adultery caused the\r\n  breakup of the marriage, and thus, is an appropriate consideration for\r\n  equitable apportionment.Â  See id. (holding wifeâ€™s adultery caused\r\n  the breakup of the marriage, and thus, was an appropriate consideration for\r\n  equitable apportionment); Greene, 351 S.C.\r\n  at 341, 569 S.E.2d at 400 (finding the facts and\r\n  circumstances of the case, including Wifeâ€™s marital misconduct, rendered the\r\n  equal division of marital assets fair and reasonable).Â  Husbandâ€™s adultery also\r\n  caused him to abandon Norwalk, which adversely affected the partiesâ€™ economic\r\n  circumstances and the value of their marital estate.Â  Additionally, in dividing\r\n  the estate, the family court took into consideration that Wife has custody of\r\n  the coupleâ€™s two children.Â  Therefore, the division was not inequitable and the\r\n  family court did not err in awarding Wife sixty percent of the marital\r\n  property.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Indemnity\r\nHusband\r\n  contends the family court lacked jurisdiction to order him to indemnify Wife\r\n  against any judgment awarded in the lawsuit brought by Noble Enterprises.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\nâ€œFor\r\n  purposes of equitable distribution, a â€˜marital debtâ€™ is a debt incurred for the\r\n  joint benefit of the parties regardless of whether the parties are legally\r\n  liable or whether one party is individually liable.â€Â  Wooten, 364 S.C.\r\n  at 546, 615 S.E.2d at 105.Â  Section 20-7-472(13) of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2007) creates a rebuttable presumption that a debt of either spouse incurred\r\n  prior to the beginning of marital litigation is a marital debt and must be\r\n  factored in the totality of equitable apportionment.Â  Hickum v. Hickum,\r\n  320 S.C. 97, 102, 463 S.E.2d 321, 324 (Ct. App. 1995). Â â€œThe burden of proving\r\n  a debt is nonmarital rests upon the party who makes such an assertion.â€ Â Id. at 103, 463 S.E.2d at 324.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the record clearly indicates Wifeâ€™s liability to the corporation arose during\r\n  the marriage because Norwalk was formed as a family business.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  family court had jurisdiction to identify and apportion this martial debt under\r\n  its general powers to equitably divide a marital estate.Â  Nevertheless, Husband\r\n  maintains the family court erred in awarding indemnification because Wife\r\n  failed to request such relief in her pleadings.Â  However, this issue is not\r\n  preserved for review because Husband failed to raise it in his Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP, motion.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406,\r\n  412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  Therefore,\r\n  the family court did not err by ordering Husband to indemnify Wife against any\r\n  judgment awarded against her.Â  \r\nV.&nbsp; Attorneysâ€™ Fees\r\nHusband\r\n  asserts the family court erred in awarding Wife attorneysâ€™ fees in the amount\r\n  of $12,800.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe family court is authorized by statute to award attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  in conjunction with marital litigation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(2) (Supp. 2007).Â  When determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the\r\n  following factors should be considered: (1) the partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her\r\n  own attorneyâ€™s fee; (2) the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and (3)\r\n  effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  Glasscock\r\n    v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161 n.1, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 n.1 (1991).Â  If\r\n  the court determines attorneyâ€™s fees are warranted, the court should consider six\r\n  factors when determining the amount to award: (1) the nature, extent, and\r\n  difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) counselâ€™s professional standing; (4) the contingency\r\n  of compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6) the customary\r\n  legal fees for similar services.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe decision to award\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge and\r\n  the award will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Marquez\r\n    v. Caudill, 376 S.C. 229, 246, 656 S.E.2d 737, 745 (2008).\r\nIn this case, the family\r\n  court found Wife â€œhas no ability to pay her attorneyâ€™s fees while the Husband,\r\n  having represented himself and with a very substantial earning potential, can\r\n  afford to pay attorneyâ€™s fees.â€Â  Further, the family court thoroughly analyzed\r\n  each of the factors outlined above and detailed its findings in its final\r\n  order.Â  The courtâ€™s findings are further supported by the affidavits of Wifeâ€™s\r\n  counsel submitted to the family court and contained in the record.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of\r\n  discretion in the family courtâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees to Wife.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTherefore,\r\n  the family courtâ€™s order is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-428","title":"State v.

Â Renee Mullinax, the individual\r\n  allegedly kidnapped by Scroggins, was not called as a witness at trial.Â  During\r\n  cross-examination of Detective Russell, Scrogginsâ€™ counsel questioned Detective\r\n  Russell about statements Mullinax made to police regarding events following the\r\n  robbery, which were recorded in Detective Russellâ€™s report of the case.Â \r\n  Specifically, Scrogginsâ€™ counsel asked Detective Russell about Mullinaxâ€™s\r\n  statements whereby she admitted to having consensual sex with Scroggins\r\n  following the alleged robbery.Â  Following this line of questioning, the State\r\n  raised the issue of whether Scrogginsâ€™ counsel had, by questioning Detective\r\n  Russell about Mullinaxâ€™s statement, opened the door to inquiry of other\r\n  statements made by Mullinax to Detective Russell about the events of the\r\n  robbery.Â  The trial court ruled that Scrogginsâ€™ counsel had opened the door. \r\nAccordingly, during the redirect examination of Detective Russell,\r\n  the State inquired about statements Mullinax made about the robbery.Â  When\r\n  asked specifically what Mullinax had to say about the robbery, Scrogginsâ€™\r\n  counsel objected arguing the line of questioning was based on hearsay.Â  The\r\n  trial court overruled the objection and Detective Russell proceeded with his\r\n  testimony. \r\nScroggins asserts the trial court erred in allowing the State to\r\n  introduce hearsay testimony of Mullinaxâ€™s statement to Detective Russell\r\n  regarding the robbery.Â  Scroggins further asserts the statements were\r\n  prejudicial because they confirmed McLamoreâ€™s testimony regarding the events\r\n  surrounding the robbery, and, in particular, the presence of the gun.Â  We find\r\n  the circuit court did not commit reversible error.Â  See State v. McFarlane, 279 S.C. 327, 330, 306 S.E.2d 611, 613 (1983) (â€œIt is well settled\r\n  that the admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely\r\n  cumulative to other evidence.â€); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507,\r\n  435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993) (any error in admission of evidence cumulative to\r\n  other unobjected-to evidence is harmless).Â  \r\nEven if the door had not\r\n  been opened and the trial court erred in allowing the admission of the\r\n  testimony at issue, we find the error to be harmless. Â Since McLamore testified\r\n  earlier in the trial that Scroggins had robbed him at gunpoint and took\r\n  Mullinax at gunpoint against her will, the disputed testimony by Detective\r\n  Russell is merely cumulative.Â  Moreover, Detective Russell testified, without\r\n  objection, that Mullinaxâ€™s account of the events confirmed what McLamore had\r\n  stated.Â  This testimony by Detective Russell was placed into evidence before\r\n  the disputed testimony at issue herein.Â  Since McLamore testified first,\r\n  followed by Detective Russellâ€™s testimony without objection that Mullinax\r\n  confirmed what McLamore stated, the subsequent admission by the court of other\r\n  statements by Mullinax through Detective Russell was therefore harmless even if\r\n  the admission was in error.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, THOMAS,\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-429","title":"State v.

Barfield, Jr., of\r\n  Chester, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jonathan\r\n  Dennis Carter appeals his conviction of second-degree burglary.Â  He contends\r\n  the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury on third-degree burglary\r\n  because he disputed prior burglary convictions in his name and those prior\r\n  convictions were an element of second-degree burglary.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 22, 2004, police responded to\r\n  a report of a cracked window at the First Washington Baptist Church (the\r\n  Church) in Lancaster, South Carolina, while the Church was closed.Â  The police\r\n  discovered two broken windows and some blood around one of the windows and in other\r\n  parts of the Church.Â  A vacuum cleaner, a crock pot, a microwave oven,\r\n  communion glasses, chemical spray, and hot dogs were missing from the Church.Â  Shortly after their arrival, the police recovered some of the items from a\r\n  wooded area behind the Church.\r\nThat same morning, Carter was\r\n  spotted carrying a bag and walking from a pawn shop near the Church into the\r\n  woods.Â  The police later brought Carter into the police station, where\r\n  he waived his rights and admitted throwing a cinder block through the church\r\n  window.Â  He further confessed to stealing the missing items from the\r\n  church and eating the hotdogs.\r\nA grand\r\n  jury indicted Carter for second-degree burglary and petit larceny.Â  At trial, the\r\n  State called the Lancaster Clerk of Court (the Clerk) to testify to demonstrate\r\n  Carter had previously been convicted of two or more burglaries.Â  However,\r\n  Carter argued the Clerkâ€™s records did not sufficiently prove Carter had two\r\n  prior burglary convictions.Â  The trial court agreed the Clerkâ€™s testimony was insufficient\r\n  and an assistant solicitor and a sheriffâ€™s deputy both involved in the cases of\r\n  the prior burglaries testified in camera Carter was the person they\r\n  dealt with in the prior burglaries.Â  The trial court determined the State had\r\n  presented sufficient evidence to create an issue for the jury.Â  Carter\r\n  requested the jury be charged with third-degree burglary in addition to\r\n  second-degree burglary because there was reasonable doubt Carter had committed\r\n  the previous burglaries.Â  The trial court stated, â€œIâ€™ll think about it, but Iâ€™m\r\n  probably not going to charge that.â€\r\nAt\r\n  trial, the Clerk testified the Clerkâ€™s office had sentencing sheets indicating\r\n  Carter pled guilty to burglaries in 2002 and 2004.Â  The sentencing sheets all\r\n  listed the defendant as Jonathan Dennis Carter and they contained the same\r\n  birth date and social security number.Â  However, the Clerk testified the\r\n  Clerkâ€™s office did not complete the forms and stated he could not testify as to\r\n  the accuracy of the information about Carter on the forms.Â  Thereafter, Deputy\r\n  Brent Williams testified he had served the warrant on Carter for the 2002 burglary\r\n  and transported him to the detention center.Â  He identified Carter as the\r\n  person he arrested but did not know if Carter was convicted of the charge.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Deputy James Shaw testified he arrested Jonathan Dennis Carter at the scene of\r\n  a burglary in 2004.Â  He identified Carter as the person he had arrested but did\r\n  not recall seeing Carter plead guilty to the burglary.Â  Subsequently, probation\r\n  agent Tim Williams testified he processed Carter for probation the same day he\r\n  was sentenced for the 2004 burglary but was not present in the courtroom when\r\n  the guilty plea was rendered.\r\nAt the\r\n  close of the Stateâ€™s case, Carter argued the Stateâ€™s evidence was insufficient\r\n  to identify Carter as the person convicted of the prior crimes.Â  Carter did not\r\n  indicate what relief he sought other than he was not seeking a directed verdict.Â \r\n  The trial court denied the motion.Â  During closing arguments, Carter argued the\r\n  State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt he had committed two prior\r\n  burglaries because the Stateâ€™s evidence of arrest did not prove he was\r\n  convicted of the prior burglaries.Â  He further argued no witness testified the\r\n  information on the sentencing sheets was correct or the signatures on them were\r\n  his.\r\nThe trial court charged the jury on\r\n  second-degree burglary but not third-degree burglary.Â  However, the trial court\r\n  did instruct the jury the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt Carter had\r\n  two or more prior convictions of burglary.Â  The jury convicted Carter of both\r\n  second-degree burglary and petit larceny.Â  The trial court sentenced him\r\n  to life without parole for the burglary because of his two prior convictions\r\n  for serious offenses.Â  Additionally, the trial court sentenced him to ten years\r\n  imprisonment for the petit larceny, to run concurrently.Â  The trial court also\r\n  pronounced Carter guilty but mentally ill by stipulation of the parties.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases,\r\n  the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€Â  State v. Baccus,\r\n  367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006).Â  Thus, an appellate court is\r\n  bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCarter\r\n  argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the lesser included offense\r\n  of third-degree burglary.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court is required to charge the law as determined from the evidence\r\n  presented at trial.Â  See State v. Gates, 269 S.C. 557, 561, 238 S.E.2d 680, 681 (1977).Â  If any evidence supports a charge, it should be given.Â  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999).Â  â€œThe\r\n  trial court commits reversible error if it fails to give a requested charge on\r\n  an issue raised by the evidence.â€Â  Id.Â  However,\r\n  a trial courtâ€™s refusal to give a requested charge must be both erroneous and\r\n  prejudicial to warrant reversal.Â  State\r\n    v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 303 (2002).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[f]ailure\r\n  to give requested jury instructions is not prejudicial\r\n  error where the instructions given afford the proper test for determining the\r\n  issues.â€Â  Id. at 263, 565 S.E.2d at 304.Â  \r\nA\r\n  person is guilty of second degree burglary â€œif the person enters a building\r\n  without consent and with intent to commit a crime therein, and . . . [t]he burglary is\r\n  committed by a person with a prior record of two or more convictions for\r\n  burglary.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-312(B)(2)\r\n  (2003).Â  â€œA person is guilty of burglary in the third degree if the person\r\n  enters a building without consent and with intent to commit a crime therein.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-313(A) (2003).\r\nThe existence\r\n  of evidence to sustain a lesser offense determines whether the charge should be\r\n  submitted to the jury.Â  State v. Funchess, 267 S.C. 427, 430, 229 S.E.2d\r\n  331, 332&nbsp;(1976).Â  The mere contention the jury might accept the Stateâ€™s\r\n  evidence in part and reject it in part will not suffice.Â  Id. (quoting State v. Hicks, 84\r\n  S.E.2d 545, 547 (N.C. 1954)).Â  In State\r\n    v. Fields, 356 S.C. 517, 523,\r\n  589 S.E.2d 792, 795 (Ct. App. 2003), the defendant was charged with first\r\n  degree criminal sexual conduct but argued even though he\r\n  did not testify or present any evidence on his own behalf, the jury could have\r\n  disbelieved a portion of the Stateâ€™s evidence and determined the sex was\r\n  consensual, and thereby found him guilty of the lesser offense of assault and\r\n  battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN).Â  However, this court held the\r\n  defendantâ€™s â€œmere assertion that the jury might have disbelieved the Stateâ€™s\r\n  evidence that the sex was not consensual and on the remaining evidence found\r\n  him guilty of ABHAN does not entitle him to have the lesser\r\n    offense submitted to the jury.â€Â  Id. at 523-24, 589 S.E.2d at 795.Â  See also State\r\n      v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 22, 518 S.E.2d 278, 285 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding the possibility the jury might have disbelieved the\r\n  Stateâ€™s evidence as to the circumstances of aggravation and on the remaining\r\n  evidence found the defendant guilty of simple assault and\r\n  battery did not entitle the defendant to have the lesser offense submitted to\r\n  the jury when no evidence tended to show defendant was guilty only of simple\r\n  assault and battery).\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Carter relied on a Second Circuit Court of Appeals case that held,\r\n  â€œWithout more, a court record showing a conviction of a similarly named person\r\n  (especially an eighteen-year-old record) cannot conceivably furnish assurance\r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt that it pertains to the present defendant.â€Â  United\r\n    States v. Jackson, 368 F.3d 59, 62&nbsp;(2nd Cir. 2004).Â  The court further\r\n  rejected â€œthe governmentâ€™s proposed rule that sufficiency is satisfied as the\r\n  result of the defendantâ€™s failure to offer proof in rebuttal.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  in the present case, the trial court relied on more than just an outdated court\r\n  record: (1) the Clerkâ€™s records indicated someone named Jonathan Dennis Carter,\r\n  with the same birth date and social security number, pled guilty to burglary in\r\n  2002 and 2004, much more recent than the eighteen-year-old record in Jackson;\r\n  (2) the arresting officers testified they arrested Carter for burglary in 2002\r\n  and 2004; and (3) a probation agent testified he processed Carter on the same\r\n  day as the 2004 guilty plea.Â  Carter has only argued the jury might reject the\r\n  Stateâ€™s evidence in part, which is not sufficient to warrant a jury charge.Â  See Funchess, 267 S.C. at 430, 229 S.E.2d at 332.Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court did not err in failing to charge the jury with third-degree burglary.\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., KONDUROS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-430","title":"Newsmall v.

Kozlarek, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Newsmall\r\n  Clemson, LLC, and its sole member, John H. Newsome, Jr., (collectively\r\n  Newsmall) appeal the trial courtâ€™s grantingÂ  of directed verdict to Earth\r\n  Management Systems, Inc. (Earth Management), on its causes of action for\r\n  negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the South Carolina\r\n  Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA).Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nNewsmall was interested in purchasing\r\n  forty-three acres of undeveloped commercial property (the Property) in Columbia, South Carolina at the Clemson Road exit of Interstate 20 for commercial\r\n  development.Â  Charles Small and his company, Diversified Development, represented\r\n  Newsmall and were responsible for developing Newsmallâ€™s projects.Â  Small was\r\n  Newsomeâ€™s business partner in several ventures, and he and his company were\r\n  experienced in real estate development.Â  \r\nSmall hired Earth Management, on behalf of Newsmall, to perform a\r\n  Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I Assessment) of the Property.Â  The\r\n  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard for Phase I\r\n  Assessment Process provides the purpose of a Phase I Assessment is to define\r\n  good commercial and customary practice for conducting an environmental site\r\n  assessment of commercial real estate.Â  The intent is to enable a user to\r\n  qualify for the innocent landowner defense to Comprehensive Environmental\r\n  Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)[1] liability.Â  The ASTM standard provides\r\n  the goal of the Phase I Assessment is to identify recognized environmental\r\n  conditions.Â  It defines recognized environmental conditions as â€œthe\r\n  presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products\r\n  on a property under conditions that indicate an existing release, a past\r\n  release, or a material threat of a release of any hazardous substances or\r\n  petroleum products into structures on the property or into the ground,\r\n  groundwater, or surface water of the property.â€Â  (emphasis omitted).Â  The\r\n  standard defines hazardous substance as â€œa substance defined as a hazardous\r\n  substance pursuant to CERCLA.â€Â  \r\nThe ASTM standard describes the components\r\n  included in a Phase I Assessment as: Â (1) records review; (2) site\r\n  reconnaissance; (3) interviews with current owners and occupants and government\r\n  officials; and (4) report.Â  The\r\n  list of standard environmental sources includes state landfill and/or solid\r\n  waste disposal site lists.Â  The standard provides:\r\n\r\n  One or more additional state sources or local sources of\r\n    environmental records may be checked, in the discretion of the environmental\r\n    professional, to enhance and supplement federal and state sources . . . .\r\n    Factors to consider in determining which local or additional state records, if\r\n    any, should be checked include (1) whether they are reasonably ascertainable,\r\n    (2) whether they are sufficiently useful, accurate, and complete in light of\r\n    the objective of the records review . . . , and (3) whether they are generally\r\n    obtained, pursuant to local good commercial or customary practice, in initial\r\n    environmental site assessments in the type of commercial real estate\r\n    transaction involved. \r\n\r\nFurther, the\r\n  standard provides a list of local sources that may be useful including â€œDepartment\r\n  of Heath/Environmental Division.â€Â  \r\nThe ASTM standard also provides â€œ[a]ll\r\n  obvious uses of the property shall be identified from the present, back to the\r\n  propertyâ€™s obvious first developed use, or back to 1940, whichever is earlier.â€Â  Additionally, it provides a list of standard historical sources. Â Those\r\n  sources include aerial photographs, property tax files, and recorded land title\r\n  records.Â  However, the standard cautions if recorded land title records are\r\n  used, they cannot be the sole historic source consulted.Â  \r\nOn January 28, 1999, Earth Management issued a report following\r\n  its investigation.Â  The report contained an executive summary, which\r\n  provided: â€œ[e]vidence of debris dumping was observed, but nothing of a\r\n  hazardous nature was identified, no extensive dumping was observed, and no\r\n  evidence of debris burial in old borrow pits was identified.â€Â  The executive\r\n  summary further stated: \r\n\r\n  During the 1980s, the eastern half . . . contained several borrow\r\n    areas from which sand was excavated by a local contractor.Â  This practice ceased\r\n    in the mid 1980s, with the excavations backfilled with on-site sand.Â  There is\r\n    no evidence to suggest that foreign materials were introduced into the borrow\r\n    pits and buried.\r\n\r\nThe executive\r\n  summary concluded: Â â€œNo further investigation for environmental considerations is\r\n  recommended at this time.â€Â  \r\nNewsmall purchased the Property on April\r\n  29, 1999.Â  In the process of constructing a road, contractors unearthed a\r\n  landfill.Â  Newsmall found an agreement between Loveless &amp; Loveless\r\n  and Interstate Investment Associates, a former owner of the Property, that\r\n  provided for the mining of sand and also for the implementation and management\r\n  of a refuse dump on the property.Â  The agreement was recorded in the Richland\r\n  County Deeds Book.Â  Additionally, the South Carolina Department of Health and\r\n  Environmental Control (DHEC) had a file detailing the history of the mining and\r\n  landfill operations and identified the Property as a former asphalt plant.Â  \r\nNewsmall excavated part of the landfill to build the road. Â The debris\r\n  could not be reburied because it contained several types of debris such as\r\n  metal, tires, plastic bags, household trash, and construction debris, and DHEC\r\n  regulations required the different types of debris be separated before\r\n  disposal. Â Shortly thereafter, Newsmall hired Geo-Systems to\r\n  determine the amount and location of the former landfill.Â  Geo-Systems\r\n  discovered construction debris, household garbage, paint cans, oil cans,\r\n  batteries, tires, and medical waste.Â  Newsmall paid for the cleanup\r\n  where the road was placed, but did not remove the remaining debris.Â  \r\nNewsmall commenced an action against Earth\r\n  Management, asserting in amended complaints[2] negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the South Carolina\r\n  Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), Sections 39-5-10 to -560 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (1985 &amp; Supp. 2007).Â  At the close of Newsmallâ€™s case, Earth\r\n  Management moved for a directed verdict on all of Newsmallâ€™s causes of action,\r\n  and the trial court granted the motion.Â  Newsmall filed a Rule 59,\r\n  SCRCP, motion, which the trial court denied.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nWhen ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is required\r\n  to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom\r\n  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Â Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  â€œIf more than one\r\n  reasonable inference can be drawn or if the inferences to be drawn from the\r\n  evidence are in doubt, the case should be submitted to the jury.â€Â  Chaney v. Burgess, 246 S.C. 261, 266, 143 S.E.2d 521, 523 (1965).Â  â€œWhen considering directed verdict motions,\r\n  neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide\r\n  credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.â€Â  Erickson\r\n    v. Jones St. Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 463, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Timeliness\r\nEarth Management\r\n  asserts Newsmall did not file its appeal in a timely manner.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Earth Management argues because Newsmall did not make a motion for a new trial\r\n  at the conclusion of the case and instead, without the permission of the trial\r\n  court, filed the motion within ten days, the motion was not properly before the\r\n  trial court. Therefore, Earth Management maintains Newsmall had thirty days\r\n  from the conclusion of the case instead of thirty days from the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling on the motion in which to file its appeal.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œ[A] party must\r\n  make a motion for a new trial promptly after the jury is discharged or request\r\n  ten days within which to make the motion.â€Â  Boone v. Goodwin, 314 S.C.\r\n  374, 376, 444 S.E.2d 524, 525 (1994).Â  Although the trial court has discretion\r\n  to sua sponte grant a new trial within ten days following the close of a\r\n  case, that power cannot remedy a partyâ€™s filing a motion for a new trial\r\n  without the courtâ€™s permission at the close of the case.Â  See id. \r\nAlthough Newsmallâ€™s motion was titled â€œmotion for a\r\n  new trial,â€ the subject of the motion was both a request for a new trial and\r\n  for the trial court to reconsider its decisions.Â  The motion cites to\r\n  Rule 59, SCRCP, but does not specify whether it is referring to sections 59(a)\r\n  through 59(d), which refer to motions for a new trial, or section 59(e), which\r\n  refers to a motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  The supreme court held it\r\n  was proper to treat a plaintiffâ€™s written motion as a Rule 59(e) motion even\r\n  though it was erroneously captioned as a motion for new trial.Â  Fields v.\r\n    Reg. Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 27, 609 S.E.2d 506, 510 (2005).Â \r\n  The courts must treat a motion based on its substance and effect as opposed to\r\n  how it was captioned by a party.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, we view the motion\r\n  as both one for a new trial and one to alter or amend the judgment.Â  \r\nUnlike\r\n  a motion for a new trial, a motion to alter or amend does not require the\r\n  courtâ€™s permission to file the motion.Â  However, both motions stay the time to\r\n  file an appeal, and the thirty day time period does not begin to run until the\r\n  appellant receives the trial courtâ€™s ruling on the motion.Â  Rule 59(f), SCRCP.Â \r\n  Because Newsmallâ€™s motion was at least in part a motion to alter or amend, the\r\n  motion stayed the time for filing an appeal.Â  Newsmall filed its motion within\r\n  thirty days of the trial courtâ€™s ruling on the motion, and thus, the appeal was\r\n  timely.Â  Accordingly, Newsmallâ€™s appeal is properly before this court.\r\nII. Directed Verdict on Negligence\r\n  Claim\r\nNewsmall contends the trial court erred in granting\r\n  Earth Management a directed verdict on its negligence claim.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Newsmall maintains the evidence presented at trial showed Earth Management\r\n  breached its duty to Newsmall.Â  Further, Newsmall argues the evidence presented\r\n  showed Newsmall suffered damages as a result of the breach of duty.Â  We agree.\r\nTo\r\n  establish a negligence cause of action, the plaintiff\r\n  must prove: Â (1) a duty of care owed by defendant to plaintiff; (2) breach of\r\n  that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting\r\n  from the breach of duty.Â  J.T. Baggerly v. CSX Transp., Inc., 370 S.C. 362, 368-69, 635 S.E.2d 97, 101 (2006).Â  â€œProximate cause requires proof of: (1) causation-in-fact, and (2)\r\n  legal cause.â€Â  Id. at 369, 635 S.E.2d at\r\n  101.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â  A.Â \r\n  Breach of Duty\r\nMark Sellers, an environmental consultant testifying on behalf of\r\n  Newsmall, stated he believed the report did not meet the standard of care for\r\n  the requirements of a Phase I Assessment.Â  He further testified:\r\n\r\n  There\r\n    are a number of deviations from the standards which either may or may not have\r\n    been part of the scope of work.Â  The biggest problem I have is that the report\r\n    presents information that there has been at least surface landfilling and that\r\n    there were pits that had been filled and that aerial photographs are referenced\r\n    for those activities, yet it draws the conclusion that no additional work needs\r\n    to be done, and I donâ€™t think the evidence in the report would indicate that no\r\n    additional work needs to be done.Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  Robert White, an expert in ASTM standards, testified he did not believe Earth\r\n  Management had met its standard of care in performing the Phase I Assessment.Â  He testified Earth Management â€œfailed to identify recognized environmental\r\n  conditions on the property, that being the landfill.Â  I believe they failed to\r\n  readily review available records with DHEC.â€Â  Moreover, White testified, â€œI\r\n  donâ€™t know that they even did a search of recorded land titles.Â  And then . . .\r\n  they obviously didnâ€™t identify the existence of the landfill on the property.â€Â \r\n  He also testified based on Earth Managementâ€™s findings, it should have\r\n  recommended a Phase II Assessment of the Property.Â  Finally, he\r\n  testified in his opinion, the landfill was a recognized environmental condition.Â  \r\nWhen considering the directed verdict motion, the trial court\r\n  asked â€œwhere is anything on this site right now under expert testimony or lay\r\n  testimony here today or during this week that says thereâ€™s a likelihood of\r\n  anything hazardous out there other than Mr. White?â€Â  Newsmall replied, â€œYour\r\n  honor, then thatâ€™s for them to argue, his credibility, and â€“ â€ The trial court\r\n  responded, â€œThatâ€™s for right now, because Iâ€™ll deal with Mr. White in a minute,\r\n  but other than Mr. White identify some testimony.â€Â  Later, the trial court\r\n  stated â€œnobody even came in here today with the exception of Mr. White, I will\r\n  give you that Mr. Beard [Newsmallâ€™s counsel] and said that anything falls in\r\n  the purview of CERCLA, which is what the Phase I was intended to look at to\r\n  begin with.â€Â  The trial court did not mention White again.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  testimony of Sellers and White supports Newsmallâ€™s claim that Earth Management\r\n  breached its duty.Â  The trial court even acknowledged Whiteâ€™s testimony\r\n  indicated the duty was breached.Â  In deciding the directed verdict motion, the\r\n  trial court improperly weighed the evidence.Â  However, the trial courtâ€™s duty\r\n  is not to weigh the evidence or determine matters of credibility.Â  Rather, those\r\n  matters are left to the jury. Â See Erickson v. Jones St. Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 463, 629 S.E.2d\r\n  653, 663 (2006) (holding the trial court does not have authority to decide\r\n  credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence when\r\n  considering a directed verdict motion).Â  Therefore, some evidence presented at\r\n  trial suggested Earth Management breached its duty to Newsmall. \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  B.Â \r\n  Damages\r\nBecause\r\n  we determine Earth Management breached its duty, we now turn to whether\r\n  Newsmall provided any evidence of damages.\r\nSmall testified he\r\n  did not believe Newsmall could sell the Property that had not been cleaned up\r\n  because no buyer would know what they were buying.Â  Small further testified the\r\n  real estate community advised Newsmall not to even attempt to sell the Property\r\n  where the landfill was located.Â  The engineer who worked for the construction\r\n  company that discovered the debris, Ben Whetstone, estimated the total cleanup\r\n  costs to be $1,636,575.Â  Sellers testified he found that estimate to be\r\n  reasonable.Â  \r\nIn addition, Newsmall had sold two lots on the Property before discovering\r\n  the landfill.Â  After discovering the landfill and learning those two\r\n  lots included the former landfill, Newsmall had to purchase additional property\r\n  to offer as an exchange to the purchasers.Â  One party received 2 acres\r\n  instead of the original 1.37 acres.Â  The other party received 3.6 acres with a\r\n  slope easement as well as frontage on Percival Road, instead of the original\r\n  3.5 acre tract with no frontage.Â  Additionally, Newsmall\r\n  discounted the price by $100,000 for another parcel that contained debris.Â  \r\nNewsmall\r\n  presented evidence of the cost of clearing the debris, the impact on the\r\n  ability to sell the property, and the expenses they incurred having to appease\r\n  purchasers of lots contaminated by the landfill.Â  A jury could reasonably find\r\n  Newsmall would not have suffered these damages if Earth Management had\r\n  discovered the problems with the Property and Newsmall had purchased other\r\n  property instead.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  because the record contained evidence Earth Management breached its duty and\r\n  Newsmall, as a result, suffered some damages, the trial court erred in granting\r\n  Earth Managementâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the issue of negligence.\r\nIII. Directed Verdict on\r\n  Negligent Misrepresentation\r\nNewsmall\r\n  asserts the trial court erred in granting Earth Managementâ€™s motion for a\r\n  directed verdict on negligent misrepresentation.Â  We agree.\r\nTo establish a claim for negligent misrepresentation, Newsmall\r\n  must be able to prove the following elements: Â â€œ(1) the defendant made a false representation to the\r\n  plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a pecuniary interest in making the statement;\r\n  (3) the defendant owed a duty of care to see that he communicated truthful\r\n  information to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant breached that duty by failing\r\n  to exercise due care; (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation;\r\n  and (6) the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his\r\n  reliance upon the representation.â€Â  AMA Mgmt. Corp. v. Strasburger, 309\r\n  S.C. 213, 222, 420 S.E.2d 868, 874 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œA duty to exercise\r\n  reasonable care in giving information exists when the defendant has a pecuniary\r\n  interest in the transaction.â€Â  Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C.\r\n  459, 474, 581 S.E.2d 496, 504 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  It is not necessary for\r\n  Newsmall to prove Earth Management knowingly made a false representation.Â \r\n  Unlike fraud, which requires the conveyance of a known falsity, negligent\r\n  misrepresentation is predicated upon transmission of a negligently made false\r\n  statement.Â  Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 43, 557 S.E.2d 676, 681 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001).Â  \r\nEarth Management\r\n  asserts the purported misrepresentation relied on by Newsmall, that â€œno further\r\n  investigation for environmental considerations is recommended at this timeâ€ was\r\n  not a representation of a then existing fact but rather was an opinion.Â  This\r\n  court held in a fraud action that the false representation must be one of fact\r\n  rather than the mere expression of an opinion.Â  Winburn v. Ins. Co. of N.\r\n    America, 287 S.C. 435, 440, 339 S.E.2d 142, 145 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding\r\n  statement that a person was a â€œgood mechanicâ€ did not support a claim for\r\n  fraud).Â  However, we find that even if the recommendation was merely an\r\n  opinion, the Phase I Assessment does contain factual representations that could\r\n  support a claim for negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\nIn the\r\n  Phase I Assessment, Earth Management stated â€œ[N]o evidence of debris burial in\r\n  old borrow pits was identified.â€Â  There is evidence in the record to support\r\n  Newsmallâ€™s contention that Earth Management was negligent in failing to review\r\n  the historical sources that indicated the Property had been used as a garbage\r\n  dump.Â  Thus, the jury could find Earth Management negligently misrepresented\r\n  there was no evidence of debris burial on the Property.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, Earth Management stated that former owner Thomas McTeer had been\r\n  interviewed and related that no foreign material was ever placed in the pits\r\n  and buried.Â  However, McTeer testified that when Earth Managementâ€™s Senior\r\n  Hydrogeologist, Brad Hubbard, interviewed him, he told Hubbard that he did not\r\n  know what was in the borrow pits, that Loveless and Loveless had the lease\r\n  agreement on it and he could contact them.Â  It is for the jury to decide\r\n  whether Earth Management made a misrepresentation regarding the interview with\r\n  McTeer.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  Earth Management stated the Property was only zoned C-3, general commercial\r\n  while in fact portions of the Property were zoned M-1, light industrial.Â  Thus,\r\n  the record contains evidence of alleged factual misrepresentations that could\r\n  support Newsmallâ€™s claim.Â  \r\nEarth\r\n  Management argues Newsmall did not reasonably rely on any of the purported\r\n  misrepresentations.Â  â€œWhether reliance is justified in a given situation\r\n  requires an evaluation of the circumstances involved, including the positions\r\n  and relations of the parties.â€ Â Redwend, 354 S.C. at 474, 581 S.E.2d at\r\n  504. Â First, Earth Management asserts no one with Newsmall read the detailed\r\n  Phase I Assessement.Â  However, Newsmallâ€™s developer, Small, testified that he\r\n  looked through the entire assessment.Â  When asked if he studied it, he stated,\r\n  â€œCould I pass an exam on it?Â  I donâ€™t think so.Â  But I probably could tell you\r\n  what was in it, yes.â€Â  In a deposition, Small admitted that he did not recall\r\n  the disclosures of debris dumping in the assessment.Â  In addition, on cross-examination,\r\n  he admitted he had not read every word of the assessment.Â  Although there is a\r\n  conflict in Smallâ€™s testimony, it is for the jury to decide whether he read the\r\n  report and justifiably relied on the representations made in it.Â  \r\nEarth Management\r\n  also asserts the disclosures it made in the Phase I Assessment should have\r\n  alerted Newsmall to the possibility of the existence of debris.Â  The report\r\n  does note the existence of scattered debris on the Property shown on a 1981 aerial\r\n  photograph raised a potential concern that the â€œpossible use of the site as a\r\n  borrow pit may have resulted in debris burial . . . .â€Â  However, the report\r\n  maintains in several places that â€œno evidence of debris burial in old borrow\r\n  pits was identified.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  ASTM Standards call for the environmental profession to review historical\r\n  sources such as land title records and state landfill and/or solid waste\r\n  disposal site lists and to interview local government officials. Â The list of local sources that may be\r\n  useful includes â€œDepartment of Health/Environmental Division.â€Â  Although Newsmall may have discovered the landfill\r\n  if it had made its own records search, a jury may reasonably find Newsmall had\r\n  a right to rely on the professional it hired to make such a review.Â  The\r\n  issue of whether Newsmall reasonably relied upon the representations Earth\r\n  Management made in the report is one for the jury to decide.Â  See Unlimited\r\n    Servs., Inc. v. Macklen Enters., Inc., 303 S.C. 384, 387, 401 S.E.2d 153,\r\n  155 (1991) (â€œThe general rule is that questions concerning reliance and its\r\n  reasonableness are factual questions for the jury.â€).\r\nTaking\r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to Newsmall, we find Newsmall\r\n  presented sufficient evidence to allow the court to submit the issue of\r\n  negligent misrepresentation to the jury.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial\r\n  court erred in granting Earth Management directed a verdict on the claim for\r\n  negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\nIV. Directed Verdict on UTPA\r\nNewsmall\r\n  contends the trial court erred in granting Earth Managementâ€™s motion for a\r\n  directed verdict on violation of the UTPA.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  UTPA creates a private right of action in favor of â€œ[a]ny person who suffers\r\n  any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of\r\n  the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act\r\n  or practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a)\r\n  (1985).Â  In order to recover pursuant to the UTPA a plaintiff must demonstrate:\r\n  Â (1) a violation of the Act by the commission of an unfair or deceptive act in\r\n  trade or commerce; (2) proximate cause; and (3) damages.Â  Schnellmann v. Roettger, 368 S.C. 17, 23, 627 S.E.2d 742, 745-46 (Ct. App. 2006) affâ€™d\r\n    as modified, 373 S.C. 379, 645 S.E.2d 239 (2007). Â â€œAn act is â€˜unfairâ€™ when it is offensive to public policy or when\r\n  it is immoral, unethical, or oppressive.â€Â  Bessinger v. BI-LO, Inc., 366 S.C. 426, 432, 622 S.E.2d 564, 567 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\nA\r\n  plaintiff bringing a private cause of action under the UTPA is required to\r\n  allege and prove the defendantâ€™s actions adversely affected the public\r\n  interest.Â  Daisy\r\n    Outdoor Adver. Co. v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 493, 473 S.E.2d 47, 49 (1996).Â  â€œ[U]nfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of trade\r\n  or commerce have an impact upon the public interest if the\r\n  acts or practices have the potential for repetition.â€ Â Noack Enters., Inc. v. Country Corner Interiors of\r\n    Hilton Head Island, Inc., 290 S.C. 475, 480, 351 S.E.2d 347, 350-51 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986).Â  Plaintiffs in prior cases often\r\n  have shown potential for repetition in two ways: Â (1) by showing the same kind\r\n  of actions occurred in the past, thus making it likely the actions will\r\n  continue to occur absent deterrence; or (2) by showing the companyâ€™s procedures\r\n  create a potential for repetition of the unfair and deceptive acts.Â  Daisy, 322 S.C. at 496, 473 S.E.2d\r\n  at 51.Â  \r\nNewsmall\r\n  asserts Earth Management violated the UTPA by (1) failing to provide Newsmall\r\n  with a proposal as required under the ASTM Standards or (2) failing to explain\r\n  or otherwise inform Newsmall of (i) any restrictions or narrow scope\r\n  limitations based on technical engineering standards incorporated only by\r\n  reference in the final Phase I Report and (ii) that the alleged limitation on\r\n  the Report varied from customs and practices in the industry or Newsmallâ€™s\r\n  reasonable expectations.Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the trial court that Newsmall has failed to show a violation of the\r\n  UTPA.Â  Newsmall failed to provide evidence that the same kind of actions\r\n  occurred in the past.Â  Newsmall asserts the trial court is to blame for this\r\n  failure as it attempted to introduce into evidence an unrelated proposal by\r\n  Earth Management, but the trial court refused to admit the proposal.Â  Although\r\n  Newsmall argues the trial court erred in this decision, it provides no\r\n  reasoning or law to support this argument.Â  Accordingly, we find the issue of\r\n  the admissibility of the proposal is not properly before this court.Â  Mulherin-Howell\r\n    v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting\r\n  when an appellant fails to cite any supporting authority for his position and\r\n  makes conclusory arguments, the appellant abandons the issue on appeal).Â  The\r\n  proposal was the only evidence Newsmall cites to show actual repetition.Â  Â \r\nIn\r\n  addition, Newsmall failed to provide evidence that Earth Managementâ€™s\r\n  procedures create a potential for repetition of the unfair and deceptive acts.Â \r\n  Newsmallâ€™s claim for a UTPA violation is based on an alleged dispute between it\r\n  and Earth Management as to the scope of the Phase I Assessment.Â  The\r\n  Limitations section of the Phase I Assessment clearly provides the report â€œwas\r\n  performed in accordance to performance standards outlined in ASTM Standard\r\n  1527(97)â€.Â  Newsmall claims it did not know the standard and argues the scope\r\n  was intended to be broader for this project.Â  However, it provided no evidence\r\n  other clients of Earth Managment would have a similar dispute over the scope of\r\n  the project.Â  Newsmall relies on a statement Earth Managementâ€™s expert witness,\r\n  Thomas Donn, made in his deposition, although the trial court denied Newsmallâ€™s\r\n  attempt to introduce excerpts of the deposition into evidence.Â  In the\r\n  deposition, Donn testified that the tank, soft sand, the depression, the borrow\r\n  pits, and the partially buried construction debris were not â€œrecognized\r\n  environmental conditions.â€Â  However, when asked if they were environmental\r\n  concerns, he answered, â€œYeah, I would say to some degree, and thatâ€™s why I\r\n  would show those and indicate those in the report.Â  There wouldnâ€™t be any reason\r\n  to include the report if it didnâ€™t have any environmental significance.â€ These\r\n  environmental concerns were in fact noted in the Phase I Assessment.Â  Even if\r\n  we considered Donnâ€™s deposition, we fail to see how it supports Newsmallâ€™s\r\n  claim for a UTPA violation.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find no evidence in the record that this was any more than a dispute of the\r\n  scope of the Assessment limited only to the parties involved.Â  See Jefferies v. Phillips, 316 S.C. 523, 527, 451 S.E.2d 21, 23 (Ct. App. 1994) (stating\r\n  conduct that only affects the parties to the transaction provides no basis for\r\n  a UTPA claim).Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  trial court did not err in granting Earth Managementâ€™s motion for a directed\r\n  verdict on the UTPA violation.Â  \r\nÂ V.Â  Deposition\r\nNewsmall maintains\r\n  the trial court erred in finding it did not have discretion to consider\r\n  allowing an excerpt from Thomas Donnâ€™s deposition because Newsmall failed to\r\n  provide timely notice.Â  We find no prejudice in this ruling.Â  See Lucas\r\n    v. Sara Lee Corp., 307 S.C. 495, 498, 415 S.E.2d 837, 839 (Ct. App. 1992)\r\n  (stating appellant must show error and prejudice in the exclusion of\r\n  evidence).Â  As stated above, even when considering the excerpts from Donnâ€™s\r\n  deposition, we find the trial court correctly granted a directed verdict on Newsmallâ€™s\r\n  UTPA claim.Â  In addition, Newsmall will be able to provide timely notice if it\r\n  wishes to offer the excerpts at the retrial of the negligence and negligent\r\n  misrepresentation claims.Â  \r\nVI. Affirmative Defenses\r\nNewsmall argues the trial court erred in considering\r\n  Earth Managmentâ€™s affirmative defenses when ruling on the directed verdicts.Â  Earth\r\n  Management conceded this issue at oral argument.Â  Accordingly, to the extent\r\n  the trial court ruled on the affirmative defenses, this ruling is reversed.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold the trial court erred in directing verdicts in favor of Earth Management\r\n  on Newsmallâ€™s claims for negligence and negligent misrepresentation.Â  We also\r\n  hold the trial court correctly granted a directed verdict on Newsmallâ€™s claim\r\n  for violation of the UTPA.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., and GOOLSBY, AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 42 U.S.C.A.

Drew, Jr., Master-In-Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-431\r\nHeard May 8, 2008 â€“ Filed July 31, 2008Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        R. Lawton McIntosh, of Anderson, for Appellant.\r\n        Stephen P. Groves, Sr., of Charleston, Thomas L. Stephenson, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lynn\r\n  Mann appeals the Master-In-Equityâ€™s failure to find Silver Bay Seafood\r\n  Restaurants, Inc. (Silver Bay) breached a commercial lease by failing to pay\r\n  rent.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 2001, Silver Bay leased commercial property owned by Mann.Â  The Lease was to commence on April 1, 2002 and\r\n  end on March 31, 2007. Â Article V of the Lease provided the Lessee would â€œpay\r\n  the rental when due.â€\r\nArticle III of the Lease, entitled Repair\r\n  and Maintenance, provided: \r\n\r\n  Subject to the Lesseeâ€™s right to inspect the premises prior to\r\n    entering into this Lease, as additional consideration for the rental paid\r\n    hereunder, the Lessee agrees to accept the Premises in the same condition and\r\n    state of repair as exists upon the date of taking possession hereunder and\r\n    thereafter, the Lessee shall be responsible for all maintenance and upkeep\r\n    thereon.Â  Lessee agrees to promptly report any and all repair and maintenance\r\n    problems to the Lessor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  under Article IV of the Lease, the Lessor was to â€œ[t]imely pay all taxes which\r\n  may become due and owing on the Premises so long as not to interfere with\r\n  possession thereof by the Lessee.â€Â  The Lease also required the Lessor\r\n\r\n  to make additions totaling 1500 square feet, 1000 square feet in\r\n    the form of a party room and 500 square feet in the form of a lighthouse in\r\n    accordance with those certain plans and specifications (and any additions or\r\n    alterations thereto) attached as Exhibit A.Â  Lessor also agrees to make\r\n    improvements to the roof and parking lot of the said Premises in accordance\r\n    with Lesseeâ€™s direction.\r\n\r\nAn addendum to\r\n  the Lease provided a partial list of improvements Silver Bay agreed to make,\r\n  including improvements to the bathroom, kitchen, electricity, and plumbing, as\r\n  well as making â€œoutside walls the same all around.â€\r\nBoth Silver Bay and Mann renovated the\r\n  portions of the Property as the Lease required.Â  Silver Bayâ€™s personnel visited\r\n  the Property daily and Mann was also there regularly.Â  On April 1, 2002,\r\n  Silver Bay took possession of the Property and began operating a restaurant.\r\nOn June 1, 2004, a Notice of Levy was posted on the Property.Â  Mann\r\n  paid the taxes owed the next day.Â  However, Mann did not remove the notice until\r\n  the following week, immediately after Silver Bay informed him of its presence.Â  On June 9, 2004, Silver Bayâ€™s attorney sent Mann a letter regarding the\r\n  Notice of Levy and â€œcertain repairs promised to be repaired on the property.â€Â  On June 30, 2004, Silver Bayâ€™s attorney sent another letter to Mann\r\n  asserting Silver Bay had lost $30,000 as a result of the Notice of Levy.Â  Â The\r\n  letter also mentions a â€œwall problemâ€ and states the Lease is null and void and\r\n  Silver Bay intended to vacate the Property on July 31, 2004.Â  On July 21,\r\n  2004, Silver Bay informed Mann it would not vacate the Property but instead\r\n  would continue to make its monthly rental payments and sue Mann for damages.Â Â  \r\nOn August 18, 2004, Silver Bay commenced an action against Mann\r\n  for breach of contract for Mannâ€™s faulty construction of an addition required\r\n  by the Lease and failure to pay taxes.Â  Mann answered, counterclaimed,\r\n  and filed a third-party complaint against the guarantors of the Lease, seeking\r\n  rents due and other damages under the Lease.Â Â  \r\nIn December 2004, Silver Bay subleased the Property to Neptune Diner.Â  Silver Bay continued making the monthly\r\n  rental payments until Neptune Diner vacated the Property in September 2005.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  Mann listed the Property for lease with a real estate agent.\r\nOn April 13, 2006, the parties consented to refer the matter to a\r\n  master.Â Â  At trial, one of the guarantors, Larry Velaetis, testified the\r\n  roof leaked the first rain after Silver Bay opened the restaurant.Â  Â He\r\n  further testified the leaks continued following every rain.Â  Metz Looper, a\r\n  former magistrate, testified that the three times he visited Silver Bay, he observed a musty odor, water on the floor, and the roof leaking.\r\nVelaetis testified Silver Bay orally informed Mann after the first\r\n  leak occurred and once the leaks continued but never provided written notice or\r\n  demand regarding the leaks, despite the fact the Lease required any notice or\r\n  demand be in writing.Â  Velaetis admitted Silver Bay did not keep any\r\n  record of the dates of the leaks.Â  He also acknowledged Silver Bay failed to inspect the roof when it took possession and once the roof began leaking,\r\n  it did not have it inspected to determine the cause of the leaks.Â  Mann\r\n  testified that at Silver Bayâ€™s request, he had sent a roofer to the Property\r\n  after Silver Bay took possession.Â  Additionally, Mann testified he had a duty\r\n  to provide a properly constructed roof.Â  \r\nThe master denied both Silver Bayâ€™s and Mannâ€™s requests for\r\n  damages.Â Â  Regarding Silver Bayâ€™s damages, the master found:\r\n\r\n  Silver[ B]ay did nothing to document the occasions when water\r\n    allegedly leaked into the restaurant.Â  Although the Court finds credible\r\n    testimony to establish some water damage due to leaks, there was no evidence\r\n    presented establishing a link between these events and Silver[ B]ayâ€™s declining\r\n    revenues, the number of occasions the leaks supposedly occurred or the extent\r\n    of damages allegedly incurred as a result of the leaks. \r\n\r\nThe master determined\r\n  Silver Bay â€œfailed to establish its business was damaged due to water\r\n  intrusion . . . [and] lost revenues with reasonable certainty.â€Â  The\r\n  master further found â€œ[t]he alleged damages due to the posting of delinquent\r\n  tax notice, if at all, are inconsequential.Â  The notice was posted for a rather\r\n  short period of time and the taxes were paid by Mann in short order.â€ Â \r\nAs to Mannâ€™s damages, the master determined: \r\n\r\n  As stated, the Court finds there was credible testimony of some\r\n    water damage due to leaks.Â  However, I find there is a significant question of\r\n    breach of the lease by Mann based upon his failure to properly repair the\r\n    roof.Â  Accordingly, the Court denies Mannâ€™s claim for damages due under the\r\n    Lease.Â  \r\n\r\nMann filed a Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration that the master denied.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn\r\n  action seeking damages for breach of contract is . . . an action at law . . . .â€Â  Kuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 589, 538 S.E.2d 15,\r\n  20&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â  In an appeal from the final judgment of a master, this\r\n  court has the same scope of review as if the appeal is from the circuit court\r\n  without a jury.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237,\r\n  391 S.E.2d 538, 543&nbsp;(1990). Â On appeal of an action at law tried without a\r\n  jury, this courtâ€™s review is limited to correction of errors at law.Â  Epworth\r\n    Childrenâ€™s Home v. Beasley,&nbsp;365 S.C. 157, 164, 616 S.E.2d 710,\r\n  714&nbsp;(2005).Â  The masterâ€™s findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in\r\n  a law action.Â  King v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 317 S.C. 385, 388-89, 453\r\n  S.E.2d 885, 888&nbsp;(1995).Â  \r\n\r\n  We may not consider the case based on our view of the\r\n    preponderance of the evidence, but must construe the evidence presented to the\r\n    Master so as to support his decision wherever reasonably possible. Â We must look at the evidence in the light most\r\n    favorable to the respondents and eliminate from consideration all evidence to\r\n    the contrary.\r\n\r\nSheek v. Crimestoppers\r\n  Alarm Sys.,&nbsp;297 S.C. 375, 377,\r\n  377 S.E.2d 132, 133&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1989) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMann argues the master\r\n  erred in failing to award damages to him under the Lease.Â  Specifically, Mann\r\n  asserts Silver Bay did not establish the elements for constructive eviction\r\n  because it did not vacate the Property before filing its cause of action.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nA\r\n  tenant asserting constructive eviction must show: (1) some intentional act or\r\n  omission of the landlord deprived the tenant of possession or substantially\r\n  interfered with the tenantâ€™s beneficial use or enjoyment of the leased premises\r\n  and (2) as a result of the act or omission by the landlord, the tenant abandoned\r\n  the premises.Â  Pleasantburg Warehouse Co. v. Global Distribution, Inc.,\r\n  287 S.C. 422, 423, 339 S.E.2d 135, 136&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985). \r\n\r\n  There\r\n    is no â€œconstructive evictionâ€ if the tenant continues in possession of the\r\n    premises however much he may be disturbed in the beneficial enjoyment.Â  To establish a constructive\r\n    eviction of the premises, in order to avoid liability for rent, the tenant must\r\n    surrender or abandon the\r\n    premises within a reasonable\r\n  time after the landlordâ€™s wrongful act.\r\n\r\n 49 Am. Jur. 2d Landlord &amp; Tenant Â§ 598 (2006) (footnotes omitted).\r\nMann contends\r\n  Silver Bay does not meet the elements for constructive eviction because it was\r\n  still in possession of the Property when it brought the breach of contract\r\n  action. Although Silver Bay retained possession of the Property after filing\r\n  suit, it continued to pay rent until Neptune Diner vacated the Property.Â \r\n  Further, the masterâ€™s order contains no indication he relied on the theory of\r\n  constructive eviction in finding Silver Bay was not liable for damages to\r\n  Mann.Â  Rather, the order seems to indicate the master found Silver Bay was not\r\n  liable because Mann had breached the terms of the Lease by failing to properly\r\n  repair the roof.Â  When â€œa contract is not performed, the\r\n  party who is guilty of the first breach is generally the one upon whom all\r\n  liability for the nonperformance rests.â€ Â Silver v. Aabstract Pools &amp; Spas, Inc., 376 S.C.\r\n  585, 594, 658 S.E.2d 539, 543&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008) (quoting Willms Trucking Co. v. JW Constr. Co., 314\r\n  S.C. 170, 178, 442 S.E.2d 197, 201 (Ct. App. 1994)).Â  \r\nThe master found â€œcredible testimony of\r\n  some water damage due to leaksâ€ as well as a â€œsignificant question of breach of\r\n  the lease by Mann based upon his failure to properly repair the roof.â€Â  The\r\n  record contains evidence to support finding Mann breached the Lease by failing\r\n  to repair the roof.Â  Mann conceded he had a duty to provide a properly\r\n  constructed roof.Â  Velaetis testified the roof leaked from the first rain after\r\n  Silver Bay took possession.Â  Additionally, Looper testified he observed the\r\n  leaks.Â  Questions regarding credibility\r\n  and weight of evidence are exclusively for the master.Â  Sheek v.\r\n    Crimestoppers Alarm Sys.,&nbsp;297 S.C. 375, 377, 377 S.E.2d 132,\r\n  133&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1989).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  because the record contains evidence indicating Mann breached the contract\r\n  first by failing to properly repair the roof, the master did not err in failing\r\n  to award Mann damages.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the order of the master is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
