(Father) appeals the family court's order terminating parental rights (TPR)\r\n  to his minor child (Child).Â  On appeal, Father argues the family court erred\r\n  in: (1) granting TPR on the unpled statutory ground that Child has resided in\r\n  foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months; (2) considering\r\n  the testimony of the foster parent and potential adoptive parent for the best\r\n  interest of the child analysis; (3) allowing the Department of Social Services\r\n  (DSS) to argue that TPR was the only placement option for Child because section\r\n  63-7-1700(F) of the South Carolina Code (2010) does not permit an extension of\r\n  the permanency placement plan beyond eighteen months after Child was placed in\r\n  foster care; (4) terminating Father's parental rights when DSS's complaint\r\n  failed to set forth the underlying factual circumstances as required by section\r\n  63-7-2540(6); and (5) granting TPR when the family court's prior orders\r\n  concerning Child's protection and permanency failed to provide Father notice as\r\n  required under section 63-7-1680 that if he did not comply with his treatment\r\n  plan, his parental rights could be terminated in six months. Â We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: Â Â Â Â Â \r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the family court erred\r\n  in allowing DSS to argue that TPR was the only placement option for Child\r\n  because section 63-7-1700(F) does not permit an extension of the permanency\r\n  placement plan beyond eighteen months after Child was placed in foster care: Hooper\r\n    v.

(Mother).Â  On appeal, Father contends the family\r\n  court erred in (1) allowing the admission of Child's out-of-court statements\r\n  pursuant to section 19-1-180 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) and (2)\r\n  finding Father committed sexual abuse against Child.Â  We affirm.[1] Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the family court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de\r\n  novo.&nbsp; Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667\r\n  (2011); see Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d 650,\r\n  652 (2011).&nbsp; Although this court reviews the family court's findings de\r\n  novo, we are not required to ignore the fact that the trial court, who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\n  assign comparative weight to their testimony.&nbsp; Lewis, 392 S.C. at\r\n  385, 709 S.E.2d at 652.&nbsp; The burden is upon the appellant to convince this\r\n  court that the family court erred in its findings.&nbsp; Id.\r\n1.&nbsp; As\r\n  to whether the family court erred in admitting the out-of-court statements of\r\n  Child pursuant to section 19-1-180, we affirm.Â  Section 19-1-180 provides for the admission of out-of-court statements\r\n  by certain children.Â  Specifically, the statute provides: \r\n\r\n(A) An out-of-court statement made by a child who is under twelve\r\n  years of age or who functions cognitively, adaptively, or developmentally under\r\n  the age of twelve at the time of a family court proceeding brought pursuant to\r\n  Title 63 concerning an act of alleged abuse or neglect as defined by [s]ection 63-7-20 is\r\n  admissible in the family court proceeding if the requirements of this section\r\n  are met regardless of whether the statement would be otherwise inadmissible.\r\n(B) An out-of-court statement may be admitted as provided in\r\n  subsection (A) if:\r\n(1) the child testifies at the proceeding . . . ; or \r\n(2)(a) the child is found by the court to be unavailable to\r\n  testify on any of these grounds: \r\n. . .\r\n(iv) the child's incompetency, including the child's inability to\r\n  communicate about the offense because of fear; \r\n(v) substantial likelihood that the child would suffer severe\r\n  emotional trauma from testifying at the proceeding or by means of videotaped\r\n  deposition or closed-circuit television; and \r\n(b) the child's out-of-court statement is shown to possess\r\n  particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  19-1-180(A)-(B).Â  We hold the court properly found Child was unavailable to\r\n  testify pursuant to section 19-1-180(B)(2)(a)(v) because there existed a\r\n  &quot;substantial likelihood that [Child] would suffer severe emotional trauma\r\n  from testifying at the proceeding or by means of videotaped deposition or\r\n  closed-circuit television.&quot;Â  Specifically, Child's counselor testified\r\n  Child would not be able to testify &quot;in this type of proceeding&quot; because\r\n  Child suffered a significant level of trauma related to Father and had not seen\r\n  Father in nearly a year, which would likely prevent her from being able to have\r\n  a conversation regarding the allegations of the case.Â  The counselor also\r\n  testified there would be a substantial likelihood Child would suffer severe emotional\r\n  trauma from testifying at the proceeding because of both her history and her\r\n  original symptoms of trauma displayed in early counseling sessions.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the counselor testified Child could not likely endure a deposition or\r\n  closed-circuit television testimony where she would be subjected to\r\n  cross-examination &quot;because of her developmental stage and because of the\r\n  trauma that she's already experienced.&quot;Â  She stated Child does not have\r\n  the &quot;ego strength or the ability to be able to go through this\r\n  process.&quot;Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in admitting Child's\r\n  out-of-court statements upon finding child was unavailable to testify pursuant\r\n  to section 19-1-180.\r\n2.&nbsp; As to whether the family court erred in finding Father\r\n  committed sexual abuse against Child, we affirm.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  63-7-20(4) of the South Carolina Code (2010) defines &quot;'Child abuse or\r\n  neglect' or 'harm'&quot; as occurring when:\r\n\r\n[T]he\r\n  parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the child's welfare: . . .\r\n  (b) commits or allows to be committed against the child a sexual offense as\r\n  defined by the laws of this State or engages in acts or omissions that present\r\n  a substantial risk that a sexual offense as defined in the laws of this State\r\n  would be committed against the child.\r\n\r\n First-degree\r\n  criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor occurs when an individual\r\n  &quot;engages in sexual battery with a victim who is less than eleven years of\r\n  age.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655 (Supp. 2010).Â  &quot;'Sexual battery' means\r\n  sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, or any intrusion,\r\n  however slight, of any part of a person's body or of any object into the\r\n  genital or anal openings of another person's body, except when such intrusion\r\n  is accomplished for medically recognized treatment or diagnostic\r\n  purposes.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(h) (2003).Â  \r\n Testimony supported\r\n  the family court's finding Father committed first-degree CSC with a minor.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Child's Guardian ad Litem, testified Child told her and Child's counselor that\r\n  Father touched Child inappropriately and hurt her by inserting his finger in\r\n  her bottom.Â  Child's counselor also testified Child frequently drew pictures of\r\n  faces with mouths scratched out and colored in, stating &quot;that was when I\r\n  was screaming when my daddy hurt my bottom.&quot;Â  Lastly, Child's social\r\n  worker testified Child made disclosures of sexual abuse against Father by\r\n  stating &quot;[Child] talked about things happening to her bottom, which again\r\n  was her buttocks area, and something being inserted inside that.&quot;Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we affirm the family court's finding Father sexually abused Child.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n SHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-434","title":"State v.

Finney, III, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Jermel\r\n  Anthony Robinson appeals his conviction for first-degree lynching.Â  On appeal,\r\n  he argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.Â \r\n  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n&quot;Any act of violence inflicted by a mob upon the\r\n  body of another person which results in the death of the person shall\r\n  constitute the crime of lynching in the first degree.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-210 (2003).Â  A &quot;mob&quot; is &quot;the assemblage of two or more\r\n  persons . . . for the premeditated purpose and with the premeditated intent of\r\n  committing an act of violence upon the person of another.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 16-3-230 (2003).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the State proffered evidence Robinson and Teron Hakeen Jackson, in an attempt to\r\n  rob the victim, surreptitiously observed the victim sitting in his parked car for\r\n  more than an hour in order to conduct surveillance and plan the robbery, donned\r\n  dark clothes and masks, armed themselves, and charged the victim from either\r\n  side with their guns drawn.Â  Jackson confessed to shooting the victim multiple\r\n  times, resulting in his death.Â  In light of this evidence, it was reasonable\r\n  for the jury to infer Robinson's premeditated intent to commit an act of\r\n  violence upon the victim and to disbelieve Robinson's assertion he did not\r\n  intend to harm the victim.Â  See State v. Tuckness, 257 S.C. 295,\r\n  299, 185 S.E.2d 607, 608 (1971) (&quot;Intent is seldom susceptible to proof by\r\n  direct evidence and must ordinarily be proven by circumstantial evidence, that\r\n  is, by facts and circumstances from which intent may be inferred.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the State proffered sufficient evidence\r\n  to overcome Robinson's motion for a directed verdict on his first-degree lynching\r\n  charge.Â  See State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641,\r\n  648 (2006) (holding &quot;[w]hen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the\r\n  trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not\r\n  its weight&quot;).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-436","title":"In the Matter of Alton M.

Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2011-UP-439\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2011 â€“ Filed October\r\n  11, 2011 \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nCharles E.

McCall,\r\n  both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Charles\r\n  Edward Deese, Jr., appeals the circuit court's order dismissing his legal\r\n  malpractice action against Stephen Schmutz.Â  On appeal, Deese argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in: (1) dismissing Deese's legal malpractice action against\r\n  Schmutz and (2) failing to grant Deese recovery on the theory of quantum meruit\r\n  for his excessive fee complaint.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\n We\r\n  find the circuit court properly dismissed Deese's legal malpractice action against\r\n  Schmutz because Deese failed to submit an expert affidavit identifying Schmutz's\r\n  alleged negligent acts.Â  SeeÂ  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-100(B)[2] (Supp. 2010) (requiring a plaintiff alleging professional negligence against an\r\n  attorney-at-law to submit an affidavit from an expert witness which must\r\n  specify at least one negligent act or omission claimed to exist and the factual\r\n  basis for each claim based on the available evidence at the time of the filing\r\n  of the affidavit).Â  Deese never submitted an expert witness's affidavit\r\n  identifying Schmutz's alleged negligent act or omission.Â  In fact, Deese had over\r\n  four months from the time he received notice of the motion to dismiss based on\r\n  these grounds to correct his error by submitting an affidavit from an expert\r\n  witness.Â  Deese also acknowledged that he did not have an affidavit during the\r\n  hearing. Because Deese failed to submit an expert witness's affidavit\r\n  identifying Schmutz's alleged negligent act or omission, the circuit court did\r\n  not err in dismissing the legal malpractice action for failure to comply with\r\n  section 15-36-100(B).Â  \r\nWe decline to address whether the circuit court erred\r\n  in failing to grant Deese relief on the theory of quantum meruit for his\r\n  excessive fee claim because this issue was not preserved for our review. See Walterboro Cmty. Hosp. v. Meacher,Â  392 S.C. 479, 493, 709 S.E.2d 71, 78\r\n  (Ct.

Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\nAppellate Defender Kathrine Hudgins, of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Joseph\r\n  Leon Zoller pled guilty to second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor\r\n  (CSC) and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment in May 1996.Â  After serving\r\n  eighty-five percent of his sentence, Zoller was released from prison and began a\r\n  community supervision program (CSP).Â  Subsequently, the circuit court revoked Zoller's\r\n  CSP several times and ordered a period of incarceration for each revocation.Â  On\r\n  March&nbsp;17, 2008, the circuit court again revoked Zoller's CSP, sentenced\r\n  him to one year of imprisonment, and imposed lifetime electronic monitoring.Â  On\r\n  March 4, 2009, the circuit court issued an order releasing Zoller from imprisonment\r\n  pursuant to State v. McGrier[1] because Zoller had served an additional 1,313 days' imprisonment beyond his\r\n  original five-year sentence.Â  The circuit court's order also vacated the\r\n  previous circuit court order imposing lifetime electronic monitoring and\r\n  dismissed the arrest warrant for violating the terms and conditions of his\r\n  electronic monitoring.Â  The State appeals this order.[2]Â  We affirm.[3] \r\nCSC is considered a &quot;no parole&quot; offense, and\r\n  therefore, a person convicted must serve eighty-five percent of the &quot;actual\r\n  term of imprisonment imposed&quot; before becoming eligible for CSP.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 24-13-150(A) (Supp. 2010).Â  In addition, a person convicted of a &quot;no\r\n  parole&quot; offense must complete CSP upon release from imprisonment.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(A) (2007).Â  CSP can last no longer than two continuous\r\n  years.Â  Â§ 24-21-560(B) (Supp. 2010). &quot;A prisoner who is sentenced for\r\n  successive revocations of the community supervision program may be required to\r\n  serve terms of incarceration for successive revocations . . . and may be\r\n  required to serve additional periods of community supervision for successive\r\n  revocations . . . .&quot;Â  Â§ 24-21-560(D) (Supp. 2010).Â  &quot;The maximum\r\n  aggregate amount of time a prisoner may be required to serve when sentenced for\r\n  successive revocations may not exceed an amount of time equal to the length of\r\n  incarceration imposed limited by the amount of time remaining on the original 'no\r\n  parole offense.'&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The prisoner must not be incarcerated\r\n  for a period longer than the original sentence.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe find the circuit court properly vacated the\r\n  previous circuit court order imposing lifetime electronic monitoring. Â Zoller was no longer subject to CSP or any of its\r\n  direct or collateral consequences at the time of the March 2008 hearing because\r\n  Zoller had served the entirety of his five-year sentence by October 2003.Â \r\n  Here, Zoller served the requisite eighty-five percent of his five-year sentence\r\n  from May 8, 1996, to May 12, 2000.Â  During this initial incarceration, Zoller\r\n  served 1,678 days of his 1,825-day sentence.Â  Upon his release from jail in\r\n  2000, Zoller only had 147 days remaining on his sentence.Â  On June 2, 2003, the\r\n  circuit court revoked Zoller's CSP and sentenced him to one year of\r\n  imprisonment.Â  Zoller was released on April 30, 2004, after serving 335 days,\r\n  which was 188 days in excess of his five-year sentence. Â See State v.\r\n    McGrier, 378 S.C. 320, 331-32, 663 S.E.2d 15, 21&nbsp;(2008) (holding\r\n  section 24-21-560(D) limits the amount of time a prisoner can be incarcerated\r\n  after a CSP revocation to the length of the remaining balance of the sentence\r\n  for the &quot;no parole offense&quot; and noting the sentence for a CSP\r\n  revocation cannot exceed the &quot;aggregate period of time that extended\r\n  beyond the unsuspended portion of the original sentence&quot;). Â Because Zoller\r\n  was no longer subject to CSP or any of its direct or collateral consequences at\r\n  the time of the March 2008 hearing, Zoller could not be subject electronic\r\n  monitoring or any violations arising out of the improper imposition of electronic\r\n  monitoring. Thus, the arrest warrant was also invalid.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 378 S.C. 320, 663 S.E.2d 15 (2008). \r\n[2] We find the State's argument concerning whether McGrier applies to collateral consequences of CSP revocations is immaterial to this\r\n  case.Â  The supreme court did not draw any distinction between direct or\r\n  collateral consequences of CSP violations in McGrier. Furthermore, the\r\n  issue of whether the rule in McGrier applies to collateral consequences\r\n  is irrelevant here.Â  No direct or collateral consequences of CSP revocations\r\n  could apply to Zoller because Zoller was no longer subject to CSP at the time\r\n  of the March 2008 hearing. \r\n[3] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-443","title":"State v.

(citation\r\n  and quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  find the special referee's order failed to make any specific factual findings to\r\n  support its award of reasonable attorney's fees.[2]Â  Here, the special referee's order is\r\n  unclear as to how it determined the reasonableness of its award of attorney's\r\n  fees.Â  In its order, the special referee invoked the reasonableness standard\r\n  for awarding attorney's fees, but failed to apply it.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  special referee failed to apply the required factors forÂ  determining reasonable\r\n  attorney's fees. Â Moreover, the record contains insufficient evidence to\r\n  support the special referee's decision.Â  The Bank's counsel's affidavit and the\r\n  Senior Vice President's testimony were the only evidence presented to support\r\n  the award.Â  However, counsel's affidavit did not set forth his hourly rate or\r\n  the amount of time devoted to this case, and the Senior Vice President's\r\n  testimony only indicated the Bank agreed to reasonable attorney's fees.Â  Thus, we\r\n  reverse and remand to the circuit court to make specific factual findings supporting\r\n  its award of reasonable attorney's fees.Â Â  See Sunrise Sav. &amp;\r\n    Loan Ass'n v. Mariner's Cay Dev. Corp.,&nbsp; 295 S.C. 208, 211, 367 S.E.2d\r\n  696, 698&nbsp;(1988) (finding an award of $125,000 for attorney's fees was\r\n  unsupported by the evidence in the record because counsel's affidavit stating\r\n  in a conclusory fashion that the fees were reasonable was the only evidence\r\n  presented to support the award).Â  \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] We find the Bank's argument that the amount of\r\n  the attorney's fees set forth in the mortgage applies to Patel is without\r\n  merit.Â  As a guarantor, Patel is not subject to the terms of the mortgage\r\n  because the mortgage and guaranty agreement are separate contracts.Â \r\n  Accordingly, Patel was only responsible for paying reasonable attorney's fees as\r\n  agreed upon in the guaranty agreement.Â  See First Sav.\r\n    Bank v.

(Carrier) appeals a circuit court decision awarding\r\n  benefits to Isidro Osvando Sanchez.Â  Carrier argues the circuit court erred in\r\n  (1) affirming the decision of the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission (the Appellate Panel) that Sanchez's injuries arose out of and in\r\n  the course of his employment[1] and (2) reversing the Appellate Panel's finding Carrier's workers' compensation\r\n  insurance policy did not cover the accident.Â  We affirm pursuant to Rule\r\n  220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n1.Â  As to\r\n  whether the circuit court erred in affirming the finding Sanchez's injuries\r\n  arose out of and in the course of his employment: S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160(A) (Supp. 2006) (providing a claimant is entitled to workers'\r\n  compensation benefits if he sustains an &quot;injury by accident arising\r\n  out of and in the course of employment&quot;); Pierre v. Seaside Farms, Inc., 386 S.C. 534, 540, 689 S.E.2d 615, 618 (2010)\r\n  (&quot;An appellate court can reverse or modify the Commission's decision if it\r\n  is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n  reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the whole\r\n  record.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.Â  [However, t]his Court must\r\n  affirm the findings of fact made by the [Appellate Panel] if they are supported\r\n  by substantial evidence.&quot; (citations and internal quotation marks\r\n  omitted)); Hall, 376 S.C. at 350, 656 S.E.2d at 759 (&quot;An accident arises out of employment when the employment\r\n  is a contributing proximate cause of the accident.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.Â \r\n  [I]f the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work\r\n  and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole\r\n  situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the\r\n  employment, then it arises out of the employment.&quot; (alteration in\r\n  original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); id. at 356-57, 656 S.E.2d at 762 (&quot;An injury occurs in the\r\n  course of employment when it occurs within the period of employment at a place\r\n  where the employee reasonably may be in the performance of his duties and while\r\n  fulfilling those duties or engaged in something incidental thereto.Â  An employee\r\n  need not be in the actual performance of the duties for which he was expressly\r\n  employed in order for his injury to be in the course of employment.Â  It is\r\n  sufficient if the employee is engaged in a pursuit or undertaking consistent\r\n  with his contract of hire and which in some logical manner pertains to or is\r\n  incidental to his employment.Â  An act outside an employee's regular duties\r\n  which is undertaken in good faith to advance the employer's interest, whether\r\n  or not the employee's own assigned work is thereby furthered, is within the\r\n  course of employment.&quot; (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n2.Â  As to\r\n  whether the circuit court erred in reversing\r\n  the Appellate Panel's finding Carrier's workers' compensation insurance policy\r\n  did not cover the accident: M &amp; M Corp. of S.C.\r\n    v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 390 S.C. 255,\r\n  259, 701 S.E.2d 33, 35 (2010) (stating insurance policies are construed using\r\n  the general rules of contract interpretation and in favor of coverage); Patterson\r\n    v.

Dotson, of Lake City, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tara\r\n  Rabuck (Mother) and Andrew Rabuck (Stepfather) (collectively, Appellants)\r\n  appeal the family court's order declining to terminate Robert Wilomovsky's (Father's)\r\n  parental rights, arguing the family court erred in: (1) failing to find Father\r\n  willfully failed to visit Child for a period of six months prior to the entry\r\n  of the temporary order in 2008; (2) failing to find Father had a diagnosable\r\n  condition, which he failed to remedy and prevented him from providing minimally\r\n  acceptable care of Child; (3) failing to find it was in Child's best interest\r\n  to terminate Father's rights and grant Stepfather's request to adopt Child; and\r\n  (4) granting Father's counterclaim for regular weekend visitation with Child\r\n  without requiring his visits be supervised at all times, he undergo regular and\r\n  random drug testing, and attend counseling sessions.Â  We affirm and\r\n  remand the case to the trial court for a hearing on visitation.\r\n1.Â  Appellants argue the family court erred in failing to find\r\n  Father willfully failed to visit Child for a period of six months prior to the\r\n  entry of the temporary order in 2008.Â  Appellants moved to Texas in 2001, and\r\n  Mother testified Father was very involved in Child's life up until that time.Â \r\n  Mother stated Father even regularly visited with Child while they were living\r\n  in Texas.Â  After Appellants moved back to North Carolina in 2005, Child visited\r\n  with Father every other weekend until Mother told Father he could only visit\r\n  Child at Mother's house.Â  Father testified that when he called, Mother told him\r\n  Child did not want to talk to him, or Mother did not take his calls at all.Â \r\n  Father contends that these rebuffs from Mother regarding visitation explain his\r\n  neglect.Â  Furthermore, Father was barred from visiting Child by court order\r\n  from July 2008 to November 2010.Â  &quot;Whether a parent's failure to visit or\r\n  support a child is 'willful' within the meaning of the statute is a question of\r\n  intent to be determined from all the facts and circumstances in each case, and\r\n  the trial judge is given wide discretion in making this determination.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. M.R.C.L., 393 S.C. 387, ___, 712 S.E.2d 452, 455 (2011).Â  &quot;While the trial judge is given wide\r\n  discretion in making this determination, the element of willfulness must be\r\n  established by clear and convincing evidence.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 137, 538 S.E.2d 285, 289 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In Wilson v. Higgins, 294 S.C. 300, 304-05, 363 S.E.2d 911, 914 (Ct. App.\r\n  1987), rev'd in part on other grounds, Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas,\r\n  342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000), this court determined the mother did not\r\n  willfully fail to visit her child when her visitation was discouraged by the\r\n  custodial parent's placing strict limitations on her rights to visit her child.Â \r\n  Additionally, in Hardy v. Gunter, 353 S.C. 128, 138, 577 S.E.2d 231, 236\r\n  (Ct. App. 2003), this court held it was improper to find a father willfully\r\n  failed to visit his children when visitation was prohibited by court order. Â Therefore,\r\n  based on the family court's superior position to evaluate the witnesses' credibility\r\n  and assign comparative weight to their testimony, and our review of the\r\n  evidence, we find the evidence supports the family court's determination that\r\n  Father did not willfully fail to visit Child.Â  \r\n2.Â \r\n  Appellants argue the family court erred in failing to find Father had a\r\n  diagnosable condition that he failed to remedy and prevented him from providing\r\n  minimally acceptable care of Child.Â  However, Father testified he has been\r\n  clean of drugs since leaving a rehabilitation center and has maintained the\r\n  same job since he returned from the center, which requires him to take random\r\n  drug testing.Â  Mother testified she did not know if Father had cured his drug\r\n  addiction, and she did not have any proof that Father was still using drugs.Â \r\n  Therefore, because Mother has not proven by clear and convincing evidence that\r\n  Father has not been rehabilitated, we find the evidence supports the family\r\n  court's determination.Â  See Doe v. Roe, 386 S.C. 624, 630, 690\r\n  S.E.2d 573, 577 (2010) (&quot;Grounds for termination of parental rights must\r\n  be proven by clear and convincing evidence.&quot;).\r\n3.Â \r\n  Appellants argue the family court erred in failing to find it was in Child's\r\n  best interests to terminate Father's rights and grant Stepfather's request to\r\n  adopt Child.Â  However, the family court need only reach the question of the best\r\n  interests of the child if it finds a statutory ground for termination of\r\n  parental rights exists. Â Loe v. Mother, 382 S.C. 457, 471, 675 S.E.2d\r\n  807, 815 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n4.Â \r\n  Appellants argue the family court erred in granting Father's counterclaim for\r\n  regular weekend visitation with Child without requiring his visits be\r\n  supervised at all times, he undergo regular and random drug testing, and he attend\r\n  counseling sessions.Â  Prior to the entry of the temporary order in 2008, Child's\r\n  counselor recommended that Father participate in counseling first by himself\r\n  and then with Child before any visitation began.Â  Also, in 2010, Child's\r\n  counselor stated that because Father and Child had not had any contact for four\r\n  years, it was &quot;imperative for [Child's] mental health that contact be\r\n  started slowly and with the help of a mediator, with whom [Child] feels\r\n  comfortable.&quot;Â  Therefore, we remand this issue to the family court to set\r\n  up a visitation schedule that will be increased gradually and monitored by the\r\n  guardian ad litem and counselor.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-460","title":"State v.

Kenneth Carter, Jr. and Carmelo V.\r\n          Sammataro, both of Columbia and William J. Conroy, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: On\r\n  appeal, Freddie Bartley, as personal representative of the estate of Rachel\r\n  Bartley, asserts the circuit court abused its discretion by excusing a juror\r\n  the court observed sleeping and impaneling an alternate during closing\r\n  arguments.Â  \r\n1. We find no error in\r\n  the circuit court's decision to replace the sleeping juror\r\n  with an alternate.Â  Whether to replace a\r\n  juror with an alternate is a matter within the sound discretion of the circuit\r\n  court, and its decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Carmack, 388 S.C. 190, 198, 694 S.E.2d 224, 228\r\n  (Ct. App. 2010); State v. Bell, 374 S.C. 136, 147, 646 S.E.2d 888, 894\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Bartley's reliance on State v. Hurd, 325 S.C. 384, 480\r\n  S.E.2d 94 (Ct. App. 1996), is misplaced.Â  In Hurd, counsel brought the\r\n  sleeping juror to the attention of the court, and the circuit court implicitly\r\n  acknowledged the juror was in fact asleep during some parts of the closing\r\n  arguments and the jury charge, but the circuit court refused a request to\r\n  question the juror or replace the juror.Â  Id. at 384, 480 S.E.2d at 97. Â Here,\r\n  the circuit court brought the sleeping juror to the attention of trial counsel,\r\n  attempted to put several safeguards into place to prevent the dismissal of the\r\n  sleeping juror, but ultimately had to replace the juror with a qualified,\r\n  alternate juror.[1]Â \r\n  As this court held in Hurd, &quot;the [circuit court] should have either determined whether the juror was in fact asleep, recharged the entire jury, or\r\n    replaced the juror.&quot;Â  Id. at 384, 480 S.E.2d at 97 (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  By replacing the sleeping juror with a qualified, alternate juror, the\r\n  circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing Bartley's request to\r\n  question the juror as to whether she heard all of the closing arguments.\r\n2.&nbsp; Even if the circuit\r\n  court abused its discretion, Bartley failed to prove he was prejudiced by the circuit\r\n  court's decision to replace the sleeping juror\r\n  with an alternate juror.Â  South Carolina\r\n  law has consistently rejected a per se reversible error rule and has required\r\n  the defendant to prove prejudice.Â  See State v. Grovenstein, 335\r\n  S.C. 347, 352, 517 S.E.2d 216, 218 (1999) (rejecting a presumption of prejudice\r\n  and holding a defendant must establish he was denied a fair trial as a result\r\n  of an alternate juror's momentary participation in jury deliberations); State\r\n    v. Wasson, 299 S.C. 508, 510, 386 S.E.2d 255, 256 (1989) (stating the burden is on the defendant to show not only\r\n  error but resulting prejudice from jurors' reading of trial-related newspaper\r\n  article); State v. Bonneau, 276 S.C. 122, 125, 276 S.E.2d 300, 301\r\n  (1981) (holding that it is incumbent on a defendant to demonstrate the presence\r\n  of an alternate juror denied him a fair trial).Â  The alternate juror had\r\n  been approved by both sides at the inception of the trial, and there was no showing\r\n  that Bartley withdrew that approval at the time of substitution. Accordingly,\r\n  Bartley has failed to establish in what manner this procedure prejudiced him.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W.\r\n          Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold Coombs, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: A municipal court jury found Rebekah\r\n  Rogers guilty of shoplifting.Â  Rogers appealed to the Florence County Court of\r\n  Common Pleas, which affirmed the conviction.Â  We affirm.\r\n1.Â As to\r\n  Rogers' argument that a uniform traffic ticket was insufficient to confer\r\n  jurisdiction on the municipal court to try the shoplifting charge, we hold that\r\n  it was incumbent on her to raise this issue before the jury was sworn in order\r\n  to preserve this issue for appeal.Â  See State v. Gentry, 363 S.C.\r\n  93, 101, 610 S.E.2d 494, 499 (2005) (&quot;[I]f an indictment is challenged as\r\n  insufficient or defective, the defendant must raise that issue before the jury\r\n  is sworn and not afterwards.&quot;); id. at 106, 610 S.E.2d at 501\r\n  (expressly overruling Odom v. State, 350 S.C. 300, 566 S.E.2d 528\r\n  (2002), wherein the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the absence of a charging\r\n  document could not be cured by an oral waiver of presentment during a guilty\r\n  plea).Â  \r\n2. As to\r\n  the merits of whether service of the uniform traffic ticket on Rogers conferred\r\n  jurisdiction on the municipal court to try her on the shoplifting charge, we\r\n  hold that notwithstanding the requirement in South Carolina Code section\r\n  22-3-710 (2007) that &quot;[a]ll proceedings before magistrates in criminal\r\n  cases shall be commenced on information under oath, plainly and substantially\r\n  setting forth the offense charged, upon which, and only which, a warrant of\r\n  arrest [shall] issue,&quot; the South Carolina legislature has conferred authority\r\n  on the summary courts to dispose of criminal matters such as the shoplifting\r\n  charge at issue in this appeal. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-25-45 (Supp.\r\n  2010) (&quot;The [municipal] court shall also have all such powers, duties and\r\n  jurisdiction in criminal cases made under state law and conferred upon\r\n  magistrates.&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-110 (2003) (stating a shoplifting\r\n  charge is triable in magistrate's court &quot;if the value of the shoplifted\r\n  merchandise is one thousand dollars or less&quot;)[1]; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-7-10 (2006 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2010) (omitting shoplifting from a list of offenses for which a uniform\r\n  traffic ticket is required to effect an arrest, but also providing that &quot;[t]he\r\n  service of the uniform traffic ticket shall vest all traffic, Â recorders', and\r\n  magistrates' courts with jurisdiction to hear and dispose of the charge for\r\n  which the ticket was issued and served&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-7-15 (2006\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2010) (allowing law enforcement to use a uniform traffic ticket\r\n  &quot;to arrest a person for an offense committed in the presence of a law\r\n  enforcement officer if the punishment is within the jurisdiction of magistrates\r\n  court and municipal court&quot;).\r\n3.Â Regarding\r\n  Rogers' complaints that the circuit court erred in finding that the State\r\n  complied with the requirement in section 56-7-15(A) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2006) to furnish certain information to the State Law Enforcement Division and\r\n  that this alleged error resulted in an improper conclusion that the\r\n  prerequisites for subject matter jurisdiction were met, we hold that because these\r\n  issues were not raised during the municipal court proceedings, they were not\r\n  preserved for appeal.Â  See State v.

Hoefer, Tracey C. Green, and Andrew\r\n          J. MacLeod, of Columbia, for Appellant/Respondent.\r\n        Michael Warner Battle, of Conway, for\r\n          Respondent/Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This cross-appeal arises out of the\r\n  Tourism Expenditure Review Committee (TERC) and the City of Myrtle Beach's (the\r\n  City's) dispute over the disbursement of funds for &quot;tourism-related\r\n  expenditures&quot; for two events under section 6-4-10(4) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (2004).Â  We dismiss this appeal as moot.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nSection\r\n  12-36-920(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) imposes a seven percent\r\n  sales tax on &quot;the rental or charges for any rooms, campground spaces,\r\n  lodgings, or sleeping accommodations furnished to transients by any hotel, inn,\r\n  tourist court, tourist camp, motel, campground, residence, or any place in\r\n  which rooms, lodgings, or sleeping accommodations are furnished to transients\r\n  for a consideration.&quot;Â  Of that tax, two percent is a local accommodations\r\n  tax that must be allocated to cities and counties pursuant to statute.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-2630(3) (Supp. 2010).Â  In cities or counties collecting more\r\n  than $50,000 from the local accommodations tax, after certain amounts are\r\n  allocated, &quot;[t]he remaining balance plus earned interest received by a\r\n  municipality or county must be allocated to a special fund and used for\r\n  tourism-related expenditures.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-4-10 (2004 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2010).Â  Section 6-4-35(B)(1)(a) of the South Carolina Code (2004) provides TERC\r\n  &quot;shall serve as the oversight authority on all questionable\r\n  tourism-related expenditures and to that end, all reports filed pursuant to [s]ection\r\n  6-4-25(D)(3) [of the South Carolina Code (2004)] must be forwarded to the\r\n  committee for review to determine if they are in compliance with this\r\n  chapter.&quot;\r\nIn 2003, the City\r\n  approved $20,000 in tax fund disbursements for the Myrtle Beach Fireworks/Beach\r\n  Bang 2003 (Fireworks Displays), which were put on by for-profit entities including\r\n  hotels, motels, restaurants, bars, and merchants.Â  Of that amount, $321.03 was\r\n  used to advertise the displays, although the application had contemplated\r\n  $2,000 towards advertising.Â  The remaining amount was used towards the $68,200\r\n  cost of putting on the displays.Â  The same year, the City also approved $10,000\r\n  for the 4th Annual Myrtle Beach Fall Rally (Fall Rally), which the Myrtle Beach\r\n  Tavern Owners Association and the Doghouse Bar, also for-profit entities, put\r\n  on to attract motorcycle enthusiasts to a biker rally in the Myrtle Beach\r\n  area.Â  The City's disbursement was used to advertise and promote the rally on\r\n  billboards, on websites, and in motorcycle enthusiast publications.Â  The Fall\r\n  Rally doubled its attendance in 2003 from the previous year.\r\nIn 2004, TERC\r\n  informed the City it had notified the South Carolina Treasurer's Office (Treasurer's\r\n  Office) to withhold $30,000 from the City's future accommodation tax\r\n  disbursements.Â  The notice stated the two disbursements were not appropriate\r\n  because the recipients were for-profit entities.Â  The City contested that\r\n  decision to the administrative law court (ALC), which found the Fireworks\r\n  Displays were not tourism related based on the amount spent on advertising the\r\n  event and that TERC had properly decided $20,000 should be withheld.Â  The ALC\r\n  found the primary use of the disbursement was to entertain tourists already in\r\n  the Myrtle Beach area.Â  Additionally, the ALC found the Fall Rally complied\r\n  with section 6-4-10 and thus TERC had incorrectly determined $10,000 should be\r\n  withheld.Â  Both the City and TERC appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed\r\n  the ALC's order.Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  noted in its order that after the ALC's decision, the General Assembly enacted\r\n  an act requiring accommodations tax revenues withheld by the Treasurer's Office\r\n  prior to July 1, 2006, be returned to the entity from which they were withheld.Â \r\n  The circuit court found that action by the legislature did not moot the appeal\r\n  because TERC still had the authority to certify the withholding of funds.Â  The\r\n  court found the decision satisfies at least one, if not all three, of the\r\n  recognized exceptions to mootness.Â  (citing Douan v. Charleston Cnty.\r\n    Council, 369 S.C. 271, 277 n.1, 631 S.E.2d 544, 547 n.1&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2006), rev'd on other grounds, 373 S.C. 384, 645 S.E.2d 241&nbsp;(2007) (&quot;In\r\n  civil cases, there are three exceptions to the mootness doctrine: (1) an\r\n  appellate court can retain jurisdiction if the issue is capable of repetition\r\n  yet evading review; (2) an appellate court can decide cases of urgency to\r\n  establish a rule for future conduct in matters of important public interest;\r\n  and (3) if the decision by the trial court can affect future events or have\r\n  collateral consequences to the parties, the appellate court can take\r\n  jurisdiction.&quot;)).[1]Â  Both parties appeal.Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe ALC presided as the\r\n  finder of fact at the contested hearing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (2005). Â The\r\n  circuit court's appellate review of the ALC's decision was governed by section\r\n  1-23-610(D) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2005), which at the time provided:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency\r\n      as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  The court may affirm\r\n      the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.Â  The\r\n      court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant\r\n      have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences,\r\n      conclusions or decisions are:\r\n    (a) in violation of constitutional or\r\n      statutory provisions;\r\n    (b) in\r\n      excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n    (c) made\r\n      upon unlawful procedure;\r\n    (d)\r\n      affected by other error of law;\r\n    (e) clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n      reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n    (f) arbitrary or capricious or\r\n      characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of\r\n      discretion.\r\n\r\nThis section also governs our review of the circuit court's decision.Â  S.C.\r\n        Coastal Conservation League v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,\r\n      363 S.C. 67, 73, 610 S.E.2d 482, 485 (2005).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe City contends\r\n  the circuit court erred in affirming the ALC's interpretation of the\r\n  accommodation tax act to mean &quot;tourism-related expenditures&quot; were\r\n  determined by the amount of money spent on advertising and finding the $20,000\r\n  disbursement was properly withheld.Â  TERC argues the circuit court erred in\r\n  affirming the ALC's ruling that a disbursement of $10,000 in accommodations tax\r\n  revenue by the City was compliant with sections 6-4-5 to -35 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code when the purpose of the disbursement was not the promotion of\r\n  tourism as required by section 6-4-10(4).Â  TERC also maintains the circuit\r\n  court erred in affirming the ALC's ruling that two disbursements of\r\n  accommodations tax revenue totaling $30,000 by the City to\r\n  &quot;for-profit&quot; entities were compliant with sections 6-4-5 to -35.Â \r\n  TERC alleges the statute is ambiguous and the ALC improperly failed to defer to\r\n  the TERC's interpretation of the statute as precluding such disbursements\r\n  because they do not promote tourism as required by section 6-4-10(4).Â  We find\r\n  these issues to be moot.\r\nAn appellate\r\n  court will not pass judgment on moot and academic questions or make an\r\n  adjudication when no actual controversy remains. Â Linda Mc Co. v. Shore,\r\n  390 S.C. 543, 557, 703 S.E.2d 499, 506&nbsp;(2010) (quoting Curtis v. State,\r\n  345 S.C. 557, 567, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596 (2001)); see also Sloan v.\r\n    Friends of the Hunley, Inc., 369 S.C. 20, 25, 630 S.E.2d 474, 477 (2006)\r\n  (&quot;Generally, this Court only considers cases presenting a justiciable\r\n  controversy.&quot;). Â A moot case results when &quot;'a\r\n  judgment rendered by the court will have no practical legal effect upon an\r\n  existing controversy because an intervening event renders any grant of\r\n  effectual relief impossible for the reviewing court.'&quot;Â  Ex parte Doe,\r\n  393 S.C. 147, ___, 711 S.E.2d 892, 894 (2011) (quoting Friends of the Hunley,\r\n  369 S.C. at 26, 630 S.E.2d at 477); see also Friends of the Hunley,\r\n  369 S.C. at 25, 630 S.E.2d at 477 (&quot;A justiciable controversy exists when\r\n  there is a real and substantial controversy which is appropriate for judicial\r\n  determination, as distinguished from a dispute that is contingent,\r\n  hypothetical, or abstract.&quot;). \r\nHowever, a court can address a moot issue\r\n  in three situations. Â Sloan v. Greenville Cnty., 380 S.C. 528, 535, 670\r\n  S.E.2d 663, 667&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).Â  &quot;First, if the issue raised is\r\n  capable of repetition but generally will evade review, the appellate court can\r\n  take jurisdiction.&quot; Â Id. Â &quot;In evaluating whether a moot issue\r\n  is capable of repetition, yet evading review the Court does not require that\r\n  the complaining party be subject to the action again.&quot;Â  Friends of the Hunley,\r\n  369 S.C. at 27, 630 S.E.2d at 478.Â  However, the action must actually evade\r\n  review.Â  Id.Â  All actions capable of repetition do not necessarily evade\r\n  review. Â See Seabrook v. City of Folly Beach, 337 S.C.\r\n  304, 307, 523 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1999).\r\n&quot;'Second, an\r\n  appellate court may decide questions of imperative and manifest urgency\r\n  to establish a rule for future conduct in matters of important public interest.'&quot;Â  Greenville Cnty., 380 S.C. at 535, 670 S.E.2d at 667 (quoting Curtis,\r\n  345 S.C. at 568, 549 S.E.2d at 596) (emphasis added by court). Â &quot;Application\r\n  of the public interest exception requires the question at issue to be (1) of\r\n  'public importance,' and (2) of 'imperative and manifest urgency.'&quot;\r\n  Â Id. Â &quot;This evaluation must be made based on the facts of each\r\n  individual situation.&quot;Â  Friends of the Hunley, 369 S.C. at 27, 630\r\n  S.E.2d at 478.\r\n&quot;Third, 'if\r\n  a decision by the trial court may affect future events, or have collateral\r\n  consequences for the parties, an appeal from that decision is not moot, even though the appellate court cannot give effective\r\n  relief in the present case.'&quot; Â Greenville Cnty., 380 S.C. at 535,\r\n  670 S.E.2d at 667 (quoting Curtis, 345 S.C. at 568, 549 S.E.2d at 596). Â &quot;The\r\n  utilization of an exception under the mootness doctrine is flexible and\r\n  discretionary . . . , not a mechanical rule that is automatically invoked.&quot;\r\n  Â Id.\r\nAs part of its\r\n  budget bill for fiscal year 2006-2007, the General Assembly required the\r\n  accommodation tax revenues withheld by the Treasurer's Office pursuant to\r\n  section 6-4-35 prior to July 1, 2006, be returned to the entity from which they\r\n  had been withheld.Â  Act No. 397, 2006 S.C. Acts 492, Part 1B, Section 60.12.Â \r\n  Thus, the $30,000 in accommodations tax proceeds certified by TERC to the Treasurer's\r\n  Office to be withheld from the City were not ultimately withheld.Â  Therefore,\r\n  this issue is moot.\r\nThe utilization\r\n  of an exception under the mootness doctrine is discretionary, and this case meets\r\n  none of the recognized exceptions.Â  First, this situation is not capable of repetition\r\n  yet evading review.Â  Although it is capable of repetition, we have no reason to\r\n  believe the legislature will refund the money collected in the future.Â  Consequently,\r\n  should the City submit requests for funds for activities TERC finds does not\r\n  meet the requirements of the statute, TERC can withhold the funds and the\r\n  parties can litigate the interpretation of the statute then.Â  Second, this is\r\n  also not a situation of imperative and manifest urgency to establish a rule for\r\n  future conduct in matters of important public interest.Â  Finally, this is not a\r\n  situation in which a decision by the trial court will affect future events, or\r\n  have collateral consequences for the parties.Â  Thus, this situation does not\r\n  meet any of the exceptions to the application of the mootness doctrine.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we dismiss this appeal as moot.\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.\r\nFEW, C.J., KONDUROS, J.,\r\n  and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Neither party raises mootness as an issue on appeal.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-465","title":"State v.

Â He argues the trial\r\n  court erred in allowing Willie Ashford, the State's witness, to testify about why\r\n  Ashford thought Johnson's clothing appeared odd.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n&quot;[A]n insubstantial error\r\n  not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent\r\n  evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v.

Â &quot;Where a\r\n  review of the entire record establishes the error is harmless beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt, the conviction should not be reversed.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe trial court overruled\r\n  Johnson's objection to Ashford's testimony that Johnson's clothing, wet and\r\n  with grass on it, appeared like somebody was chasing Johnson.Â  Even assuming Ashford's\r\n  statement was objectionable, its admission is not reversible error. Â See Price, 368 S.C. at 500, 629 S.E.2d at 366 (holding\r\n  improper admission of testimony was harmless in light of the other evidence in\r\n  the record). Â The record\r\n  indicates Johnson admitted participating in the events, but maintained an\r\n  alleged participant forced him. Â Johnson's two co-participants testified at\r\n  trial he was a willing participant and denied the involvement of a fourth\r\n  person or forcing Johnson's participation.Â  Also, Ashford's testimony was\r\n  merely cumulative. Â Johnson maintained he hid in ditchesevery time he saw cars, including police cars, on the\r\n  road towards Ashford's house as a result of being scared of the alleged participant.

Porter Stewart, II,\r\n          of Florence, for Appellants.\r\n        Elizabeth Biggerstaff York, of Hartsville,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n        Beatrice B. Curtis, of Darlington, and\r\n          Robbie Forrester Gardner, III, of Hartsville, for Guardians Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this action from the family court,\r\n  Frederick V. (Father) and Jennifer V. (Mother) appeal the family court's order\r\n  of removal of their three minor children (collectively Children), arguing the\r\n  family court erred in: (1) finding the children were abused and neglected; (2)\r\n  approving Mother and Father's treatment plan; and (3) placing Mother and Father\r\n  on the Department of Social Services (DSS) Central Registry of Child Abuse and\r\n  Neglect (Registry).\r\n1. As to whether the\r\n  family court erred in finding the children were abused and neglected, after reviewing\r\n  the record de novo, we hold there is convincing evidence to affirm the family\r\n  court's findings. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-20(4)(a) (2010) (stating\r\n  &quot;child abuse or neglect&quot; or &quot;harm&quot; occurs when the parent,\r\n  guardian, or other person responsible for the child's welfare inflicts or\r\n  allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or engages in\r\n  acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or mental injury\r\n  to the child, including injuries sustained as a result of excessive corporal\r\n  punishment, but excluding corporal punishment or physical discipline which:Â \r\n  (1) is administered by a parent or person in loco parentis; (2) is perpetrated\r\n  for the sole purpose of restraining or correcting the child; (3) is reasonable\r\n  in manner and moderate in degree; (4) has not brought about permanent or\r\n  lasting damage to the child; and (5) is not reckless or grossly negligent\r\n  behavior by the parents); Simmons v.\r\n    Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414-15, 709\r\n  S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011) (holding that &quot;[i]n appeals from the family court,\r\n  this [c]ourt reviews factual and legal issues de novo&quot;); Lewis v. Lewis,\r\n  392 S.C. 381, 392, 709 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2011) (stating this court has the\r\n  authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence).\r\n2. As to whether the family court\r\n  erred in approving Mother and Father's treatment plan, we find this issue is\r\n  moot; thus, it is dismissed.Â  See Seabrook v. Knox, 369 S.C. 191,\r\n  197, 631 S.E.2d 907, 910 (2006) (stating a moot case exists where a judgment\r\n  rendered by the court will have &quot;no practical legal effect upon an\r\n  existing controversy because an intervening event renders any grant of\r\n  effectual relief impossible for the reviewing court&quot;).\r\n3. As to whether the\r\n  family court erred in placing Mother and Father on the DSS Registry, we find\r\n  there is no evidence in the record showing the family court's ruling complies\r\n  with the relevant statutory law.Â  Accordingly, we reverse.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1940 (2010)(stating\r\n  if the only form of physical abuse found by the court is excessive corporal\r\n  punishment, the court may order that person's name be entered in the DSS\r\n  Registry if the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that the person\r\n  abused or neglected the child in any manner, including the use of excessive\r\n  corporal punishment, and the nature and circumstances of the abuse\r\n  indicate that the person would present a significant risk of committing\r\n  physical or sexual abuse or willful or reckless neglect if the person were in a\r\n  position or setting outside of the person's home that involves care of or\r\n  substantial contact with children); Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412,\r\n  414-15, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011) (holding that &quot;[i]n appeals from the\r\n  family court, this [c]ourt reviews factual and legal issues de novo&quot;).\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, DISMISSED IN PART, AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-468","title":"Johnson v.

Roberts, 369 S.C.\r\n  580, 583, 632 S.E.2d 871, 873 (2006).Â  &quot;Once the defendant has waived\r\n  counsel, the [circuit court] has the responsibility to ensure that the accused\r\n  is informed of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, and makes\r\n  a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, 241, 523 S.E.2d 168, 170 (1999).Â  &quot;Although a\r\n  specific inquiry by the [circuit court] expressly addressing the disadvantages\r\n  of a pro se defense is preferred, the ultimate test is not the [circuit\r\n  court's] advice, but the accused's understanding.&quot; Â State v. Cash, 309 S.C. 40, 42, 419 S.E.2d 811, 813&nbsp;(Ct.App. 1992).\r\nHere, the circuit court made\r\n  a specific inquiry about the disadvantages and obstacles inherent in\r\n  self-representation.Â  The circuit court discussed the subtleties and interplay\r\n  between the rules of evidence, preservation issues, and trial strategy.Â  The\r\n  circuit court also emphasized the advantages of an experienced and objective\r\n  lawyer.Â  Furthermore, the circuit court specifically advised McCoy against\r\n  waiving his right to counsel and told him that he personally would not\r\n  represent himself and offered anecdotes to illustrate the dangers of\r\n  self-representation.Â  McCoy expressed an understanding of how trials work,\r\n  acknowledged the dangers of self-representation, and repeatedly expressed his\r\n  desire to proceed pro se.Â  The circuit court colloquy and McCoy's repeated\r\n  desire to represent himself reveals a knowing and intelligent waiver of McCoy's\r\n  right to counsel.Â  See id.(holding the ultimate test is not the circuit court's advice\r\n  but the accused's understanding). \r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â  Â \r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-472","title":"State v.

Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Mokeia\r\n  Hammond appeals her conviction for armed robbery, arguing the circuit court\r\n  erred in denying her motion for a directed verdict because the State failed to\r\n  present any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence that Hammond was more\r\n  than merely present when the robbery occurred.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nAn appellate court reviews\r\n  the denial of a directed verdict by viewing the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  &quot;If there is any direct\r\n  evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove\r\n  the guilt of the accused, [an appellate court] must find the case was properly\r\n  submitted to the jury.&quot;Â  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  The\r\n  circuit court may not consider the weight of the evidence.Â  Id. at 292,\r\n  625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  A circuit court should grant a directed verdict motion when\r\n  the evidence merely raises a suspicion the accused is guilty.Â  State v.\r\n    Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001).Â  &quot;Under the 'hand\r\n  of one is the hand of all' theory [of accomplice liability], one who joins with\r\n  another to accomplish an illegal purpose is liable\r\n  criminally for everything done by his confederate incidental\r\n  to the execution of the common design and purpose.&quot; State v. Condrey,\r\n  349 S.C. 184, 194, 562 S.E.2d 320, 324 (Ct.

Â However,\r\n  &quot;presence at the scene of a crime by pre-arrangement to aid, encourage, or\r\n  abet in the perpetration of the crime constitutes guilt as a [principal].&quot;\r\n  Â State v. Hill, 268 S.C. 390, 395-96, 234 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1977).Â  \r\nIn viewing the evidence in\r\n  the light most favorable to the State, substantial circumstantial evidence\r\n  existed showing Hammond's guilt.Â  See Weston, 367 S.C. at 292-93,\r\n  625 S.E.2d at 648.Â  Another passenger in the car testified he heard the\r\n  announcement they were going to &quot;do a lick&quot; and understood this to\r\n  mean they were going to commit a robbery.Â  After this announcement, Hammond\r\n  continued to drive to the parking lot to meet the victim and then drove the car\r\n  away from the scene after the robbery and shooting occurred.Â  While mere\r\n  presence and prior knowledge a crime was going to be committed are not enough\r\n  to find a defendant guilty, here, Hammond continued to act as driver after her\r\n  co-defendant stated his criminal intentions and after the crime was committed.Â \r\n  Because Hammond knew of the plan in advance, was present, and aided in the\r\n  commission of the crime by driving, substantial circumstantial evidence existed\r\n  that reasonably tended to prove Hammond's guilt.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court\r\n  did not err in denying Hammond's motion for a directed verdict.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-477","title":"State v.

Snipes (Husband) appeals the family court's\r\n  final order granting a divorce to Tammy R. Snipes (Wife) on the ground of\r\n  habitual drunkenness and division of the parties' assets.Â  Husband argues the\r\n  family court erred in (1) granting Wife a divorce on the ground of habitual drunkenness\r\n  based on his use of prescription drugs; (2) failing to grant his motion for a\r\n  continuance; and (3) including nonmarital property in the division of marital\r\n  assets.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on\r\n  September 16, 1995, and have one child together.[1]Â \r\n  At the time they married, Husband was thirty years old and Wife was twenty-three\r\n  years old. Â Husband had prior experience in industrial work but was not\r\n  working at the time of the divorce hearing, and Wife had a high school degree\r\n  and a cosmetology license to cut hair.Â  Wife also worked part-time for the\r\n  United States Postal Service.Â  \r\nPrior to the commencement of\r\n  the divorce hearing, Husband moved to continue the case.Â  Husband stated he fired\r\n  his attorney and attempted to obtain representation from legal aid but was not\r\n  able to do so.Â  The family court noted Husband had over ninety days since the\r\n  last hearing in the case to obtain another attorney and reminded Husband he had\r\n  no absolute right to a free lawyer in a civil case.Â  Husband explained he did\r\n  not have any money to hire another attorney and stated he wanted to establish\r\n  that he was denied legal aid.Â  The family court proceeded to engage in a long\r\n  colloquy with Husband, explaining Husband's duties in the case and denying his\r\n  motion for a continuance.Â  \r\nAt the divorce hearing, Wife\r\n  testified she sought a divorce on the ground of habitual drunkenness based on\r\n  Husband's addiction to prescription medication.Â  Wife explained Husband had\r\n  prescriptions for multiple pain medications because of three surgeries for\r\n  injuries to his back and neck.[2]Â  Â Â Wife stated: &quot;[Husband] was kind of out of it a lot of times.Â  He\r\n  could sit in a chair and just go to sleep.Â  He could lay in the bed all day\r\n  long and sleep.Â  Sometimes he would get aggravated or mad and just take a handful\r\n  of pills.&quot;Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nWife explained that after\r\n  Husband began taking his medication, he started to act differently, becoming\r\n  mean and arguing with her about different issues.Â  Wife alleged Husband\r\n  &quot;took too much&quot; of the medication for a period much longer than\r\n  needed to recuperate from the surgeries and appeared &quot;drunk&quot; a lot of\r\n  the time after he took the medication but admitted on cross-examination she did\r\n  not know the amount of medication prescribed by the doctors for Husband.[3]Â \r\n  Wife testified she spoke to Husband about his addiction &quot;and asked\r\n  [Husband] to get help, [but Husband said he] did not have a problem and that\r\n  [he] had to take that medication [and] could not live without that\r\n  medicine.&quot;Â  \r\nRegarding the marital\r\n  property, Wife testified she and Husband lived in an old house on Husband's\r\n  property for about a week until the utilities were connected to the mobile home\r\n  she brought to the land.Â  Wife later purchased a 1997 Fleetwood mobile home in\r\n  which the family resided.Â  Wife explained both mobile homes were placed on land\r\n  owned by Husband before the marriage.Â  Wife stated Husband also &quot;bought a\r\n  lot of things and keeps them and the yard would look like a junkyard.&quot;Â \r\n  Wife testified she had the land and the property in the yard appraised at a\r\n  value of $82,850.Â  On cross-examination, Wife admitted some of the property in\r\n  the yard, including some of &quot;the junk cars and things&quot; were probably owned\r\n  by Husband before they were married but maintained everything became marital\r\n  property because it was commingled.Â  \r\nThe family court issued a\r\n  final order granting Wife a divorce from Husband on the ground of habitual\r\n  drunkenness.Â  The family court found: &quot;[T]he evidence of witnesses who\r\n  testified for [Wife] establishes that [Husband] abuses prescription drugs and\r\n  is habitually intoxicated and impaired as a result of his abuse of those\r\n  drugs.&quot;Â  Regarding the apportionment of marital property, the family court\r\n  found the appraisal values assigned to the marital property were appropriate\r\n  and adopted Wife's proposed division of the property awarding Husband $92,145\r\n  and Wife $56,314.62 in marital property.Â  The family court also held:\r\n  &quot;[t]o balance the equities, [Husband] must pay the sum of $21,415.00 to\r\n  [Wife].&quot;Â  Subsequently, Husband filed a motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP.[4]Â \r\n  After a hearing, the family court denied Husband's motion.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate\r\n  court reviews decisions of the family court de novo.Â  Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 392, 709 S.E.2d 650, 655\r\n  (2011). The appellate court generally\r\n  defers to the factual findings of the family court regarding credibility\r\n  because the family court is in a better position to observe the witness and his\r\n  or her demeanor.Â  Id.Â  The party contesting the family court's decision\r\n  bears the burden of demonstrating the family court's factual findings are not\r\n  supported by the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Habitual Drunkenness Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nHusband\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting Wife a divorce on the fault ground of\r\n  his habitual drunkenness.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nA divorce may be granted on\r\n  the ground of &quot;[h]abitual drunkenness; provided, that this ground\r\n  shall be construed to include habitual drunkenness caused by the use of any\r\n  narcotic drug.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-10(4) (1985).Â  &quot;In order to\r\n  prove habitual drunkenness, there must be a showing that the abuse of alcohol\r\n  caused the breakdown of the marriage and that such abuse existed at or near the\r\n  time of filing for divorce.&quot;Â  Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411,\r\n  414, 440 S.E.2d 884, 885 (1994).Â  &quot;[O]ne need not be an alcoholic to be\r\n  guilty of habitual drunkenness.Â  It is sufficient if the use or abuse of\r\n  alcohol causes the breakdown of normal marital relations.&quot;Â  Lee v. Lee,\r\n  282 S.C. 76, 79, 316 S.E.2d 435, 437 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  &quot;Habitual\r\n  drunkenness is the fixed habit of frequently getting drunk; it does not\r\n  necessarily imply continual drunkenness.&quot;Â  Id. at 78-79, 316 S.E.2d\r\n  at 437 (citing Rooney v. Rooney, 242 S.C. 503, 505, 131 S.E.2d 618, 619\r\n  (1963)). \r\nIn this case, Husband does\r\n  not dispute he was using narcotic drugs prescribed by his physician.Â  Wife and\r\n  her brother testified Husband was frequently intoxicated because of the\r\n  medication, and Husband did not refute that testimony.Â  Wife observed that\r\n  Husband &quot;took too much&quot; of the medication for a period much longer\r\n  than needed to recuperate from his surgeries and would sometimes &quot;grab a\r\n  handful of pills&quot; when he got aggravated or mad.Â  Wife testified she and\r\n  Husband had a good marriage in prior years and she separated from Husband\r\n  because he &quot;had become addicted to prescription medicine.&quot;Â  Based on\r\n  the evidence in the record before us, we affirm the family court's grant of\r\n  divorce to Wife on the ground of habitual drunkenness.\r\nII.&nbsp; Continuance\r\nHusband next alleges the\r\n  family court erred in denying his request for a continuance the day of the\r\n  final hearing.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe grant or denial of a\r\n  continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial court and is reviewable\r\n  on appeal only when an abuse of discretion appears from the record.Â  Moore v.\r\n    Moore, 376 S.C. 467, 482, 657 S.E.2d 743, 751 (2008) (citing Bridwell v.\r\n      Bridwell, 279 S.C. 111, 112, 302 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1983)).Â  The &quot;appellate\r\n  court will not set aside a court's ruling on a motion for a continuance unless\r\n  it clearly appears there was an abuse of discretion to the prejudice of the\r\n  movant.&quot;Â  Id. at 483, 657 S.E.2d at 751 (citing Townsend v.\r\n    Townsend, 323 S.C. 309, 313, 474 S.E.2d 424, 427 (1996)).\r\nThe record demonstrates\r\n  Husband had notice of the final hearing and had a period of ninety days in\r\n  which to secure replacement counsel.Â  He did not notify the family court prior\r\n  to the hearing that he was without counsel and would seek to continue the\r\n  hearing.Â  Furthermore, Husband filed the action seeking alimony, and Wife was\r\n  paying temporary alimony, which she sought to terminate. Â Husband actively\r\n  participated in the trial and cross-examined witnesses, and although this was a\r\n  final hearing, the record shows Husband obtained replacement counsel, who filed\r\n  a motion for reconsideration on his behalf.Â  Accordingly, the family court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion in denying Husband's request for a continuance.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Equitable Division\r\nFinally, Husband contends the\r\n  family court erred in including certain property in the marital estate for\r\n  equitable distribution.Â  We agree.Â Â  \r\nHusband's allegations center\r\n  on three different pieces of property: (1) the land upon which the mobile homes\r\n  were placed; (2) a house used briefly by the couple before they moved into the\r\n  mobile homes they occupied; and (3) a collection of secondhand items purchased\r\n  by Husband, including &quot;junk cars&quot; and other miscellaneous items.[5]Â  \r\nMarital property is defined\r\n  in section 20-3-630(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) as &quot;all\r\n  real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the\r\n  marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital\r\n  litigation . . . regardless of how legal title is held.&quot;Â  However, the\r\n  statute also lays out five exceptions to this general rule, stating several\r\n  types of property constitute nonmarital property, including &quot;property\r\n  acquired by either party before the marriage.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-630(A)(2).Â Â  Â \r\nThe family court made no\r\n  findings regarding whether the items at issue were marital or nonmarital although\r\n  Wife testified Husband had purchased the old home and property and at least\r\n  some of the junk cars prior to the marriage.Â  Therefore, we remand the issue of\r\n  equitable division to the family court for a determination of what property is\r\n  included or excluded in the marital estate and equitable apportionment in light\r\n  of those findings. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the family court's\r\n  grant of divorce to Wife on the grounds of Husband's habitual drunkenness and\r\n  we affirm the family court's denial of Husband's request for a continuance.Â  We\r\n  reverse the family court's decision with respect to equitable distribution of\r\n  the parties' assets and remand for a determination of what property is included\r\n  in the marital estate and equitable apportionment. \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and THOMAS and KONDUROS,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The child is over eighteen and lives with Wife.Â \r\n  Wife did not seek child support payments at the divorce hearing and the issues\r\n  of custody and child support payments are not being challenged by Husband on\r\n  appeal.Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\n[2]Â  The record is not clear as to what pain medication\r\n  Husband was prescribed, but Wife testified the list of medications included\r\n  Oxycontin and Vicodin.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Wife's brother, Herbert Cook, also testified at the\r\n  divorce hearing and corroborated Wife's testimony about Husband appearing intoxicated\r\n  while on the prescription medication.Â  \r\n[4]Â  Husband represented himself during the divorce\r\n  hearing but was represented by an attorney for purposes of the Rule 59, SCRCP,\r\n  motion. Â Husband is represented by the same attorney for purposes of his\r\n  appeal.Â Â  Â \r\n[5] We note Husband also raises a challenge related to\r\n  his $5,000 contribution toward the 1997 Fleetwood mobile home.Â  However, this\r\n  issue is not preserved for our review because it was not raised to the family\r\n  court during the hearing or in a post-trial motion.Â  See Nicholson v.\r\n    Nicholson, 378 S.C. 523, 537, 663 S.E.2d 74, 82 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding\r\n  when the family court did not rule on an issue at trial and the party did not\r\n  make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, the issue is not preserved for appellate\r\n  review).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-480","title":"James v.
