Â Wife\r\n  had two children from a previous marriage, whom she and Husband supported\r\n  during their marriage.\r\nIn\r\n  1992, shortly before the parties' marriage, Husband purchased his siblings'\r\n  interest in their late parents' home.Â  The home was titled solely in Husband's\r\n  name and Husband was responsible for the mortgage at all times, which he paid\r\n  off during the course of the parties' marriage from his separate checking\r\n  account.Â  Wife made indirect contributions to the home by paying household\r\n  expenses, cleaning, helping to remodel and update the home, taking out the\r\n  trash, and doing yard work.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  their marriage, Husband and Wife maintained separate banking accounts into\r\n  which their respective paychecks were deposited.Â  Husband worked for Bi-Lo for\r\n  approximately twenty-nine years and was an assistant manager for Bi-Lo during\r\n  the majority of the parties' marriage.Â  He left Bi-Lo and began working for his\r\n  brother in Florida approximately a year after the parties separated.Â  Wife has\r\n  been working at the South Carolina Department of Transportation for\r\n  approximately eighteen years, but she also currently works part-time for the\r\n  South Carolina Credit Union.Â  Before Husband stopped working at Bi-Lo in August\r\n  2004, his gross monthly income was $4,207.12 and Wife's gross monthly income\r\n  was approximately $3,200.[1]Â  \r\nAt the time of the final hearing, Wife was living at her sister's house\r\n  because she claimed she could not afford to buy a house and pay her basic\r\n  living expenses.Â  Wife reasoned that while she was earning more than she earned\r\n  during the marriage, due to the loss of Husband's income, Wife could not\r\n  support herself in the same manner that she was accustomed to during their\r\n  marriage.Â  \r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  May 4, 2004, Husband instituted this divorce action, seeking separate\r\n  maintenance and support, confirmation of property division, discovery,\r\n  reimbursement alimony, and attorney's fees.Â  Wife responded and counterclaimed,\r\n  seeking a dismissal of the complaint, separate maintenance and support,\r\n  equitable distribution of the property, discovery, alimony, and attorney's\r\n  fees.Â  The family court held a final hearing on March 30, 2006.Â Â  \r\nHusband was not\r\n  present at the final hearing.Â  Husband's counsel moved for a continuance\r\n  citing Husband's &quot;severe memory problems,&quot; but counsel acknowledged\r\n  that there was no excuse for Husband's absence as counsel had notified Husband\r\n  of the date of the hearing.Â  The family court denied counsel's motion, but it gave\r\n  Husband's counsel an opportunity to notify Husband of the court's decision to\r\n  proceed with the hearing in Husband's absence.Â Â  \r\nWife\r\n  was the sole witness at the final hearing.Â  Before Wife's testimony, Husband's\r\n  counsel objected to any evidence on Wife's attorney's fees because Wife failed\r\n  to respond to his discovery requests on the grounds of attorney-client\r\n  privilege.Â  The family court denied this motion.Â  Subsequently, Husband's\r\n  counsel attempted to introduce excerpts from Husband's deposition in response\r\n  to Wife's testimony, which the family court did not allow.Â  Husband's counsel then\r\n  moved to alternatively strike any evidence that Wife testified to in reliance\r\n  upon Husband's deposition, but the family court denied this motion and\r\n  proceeded with the hearing. Â \r\nThereafter, on July\r\n  26, 2006, the family court issued a final decree of divorce and awarded the\r\n  parties a divorce based on the statutory ground of one year's continuous\r\n  separation.Â  Finding the home, the 401(k), and the retirement accounts were\r\n  marital property, the court divided the marital estate on a 50/50 basis.Â  The family\r\n  court awarded the home to Husband but allotted $97,264 from Husband's 401(k)\r\n  account to Wife to effectuate an equal division of marital property.Â  Wife retained\r\n  exclusive ownership of her 401(k) and state retirement accounts and was awarded\r\n  $353 per month in permanent periodic alimony.Â  The family court also awarded\r\n  attorney's fees to Wife in the amount of $12,568.02.Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nHusband presents this Court with six grounds of error\r\n  on appeal.\r\n(1)&nbsp; The family court erred in denying\r\n  Husband's motion for a continuance because it was presented with evidence that\r\n  Husband failed to attend the final hearing on account of severe memory\r\n  problems.\r\n(2)&nbsp; The family court erred in\r\n  excluding portions of Husband's deposition, which would demonstrate Husband\r\n  failed to attend the hearing due to a mental infirmity, when the court had\r\n  permitted Wife to testify from the same deposition.\r\n(3)&nbsp; The family court erred in\r\n  permitting Wife to offer evidence on her attorney's fees as she previously\r\n  asserted in response to discovery requests that the fee evidence was\r\n  attorney-client protected. \r\n(4)&nbsp; The family court erred in awarding\r\n  Wife permanent periodic alimony as none of the factors set forth in S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. section 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2008) justify an award of alimony to Wife.\r\n(5)&nbsp; The family court erred in\r\n  transmuting Husband's home into marital property because Wife failed to sustain\r\n  her initial burden of establishing that the parties intended the home be\r\n  transmuted into marital property.Â  \r\n(6)&nbsp; The family court erred in awarding\r\n  Wife fifty percent of the marital estate because Husband made greater financial\r\n  contributions during the marriage and each party maintained separate financial\r\n  accounts.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family\r\n  court, this Court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence. Â Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364\r\n  S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005). Â However, this broad scope\r\n  of review does not require this Court to disregard the findings of the family\r\n  court. Â Id. at 189-90, 612 S.E.2d at 711.Â  Nor can we ignore the fact\r\n  that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541\r\n  (1981). Â Moreover, our broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of\r\n  the burden of proving to this Court that the family court committed error. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Motion for Continuance\r\n\r\nHusband first contends the family court erred in denying his counsel's\r\n  motion for continuance due to Husband's absence at the hearing.Â  We disagree.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nRule 40(i)(1), SCRCP, states: &quot;As actions are\r\n  called, counsel may request that the action be continued. If good and\r\n  sufficient cause for continuance is shown, the continuance may be granted by\r\n  the court.&quot; Â As stated in the Rules, a motion for continuance is\r\n  discretionary with the family court, and we will not disturb its ruling on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Bridwell v. Bridwell, 279\r\n  S.C. 111, 112, 302 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1983).\r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn requesting a continuance, Husband's counsel stated\r\n  that Husband had forgotten about the hearing and his absence was due to\r\n  &quot;severe memory problems which [] manifested themselves at several points\r\n  in this case.&quot; Â Counsel explained that he had problems working with\r\n  Husband and that Husband failed to bring several subpoenaed documents to his\r\n  deposition on the grounds that he just &quot;forgot&quot; them.Â  Husband's\r\n  counsel also stated on the record that Husband was aware of the hearing as\r\n  counsel had talked with Husband about the upcoming hearing several times during\r\n  the preceding week.Â  In opposing\r\n  Husband's motion, Wife's counsel argued Husband's actions were typical of what\r\n  Wife encountered throughout the case.Â  Wife's counsel stated that Husband\r\n  wanted &quot;everyone to believe that he has some great mental, physical\r\n  problem that is causing him to do these things. [But] [t]hat is not the case,\r\n  and I think if he were here that would be pretty evident.&quot; Â \r\n  \r\n  While\r\n    Husband now argues that portions of his deposition testimony substantiate his\r\n    claim that he suffered from a mental infirmity, Husband's counsel did not seek\r\n    to introduce Husband's deposition to establish the mental infirmity issue when\r\n    counsel argued for a continuance.Â  Further, the only other testimony at the\r\n    hearing regarding Husband's health was from Wife who testified that she did not\r\n    believe Husband was in poor health.Â  While her testimony was elicited after the\r\n    court's denial of Husband's motion for a continuance, Husband's counsel did not\r\n    seek to clarify Wife's testimony or question her on whether Husband suffered\r\n    from any memory issues during their marriage.Â  \r\n  Husband\r\n    additionally argues that his memory issues are evidenced by his failure to\r\n    remember important dates and subpoenaed documents at his deposition.Â  However,\r\n    Husband's presence at his deposition demonstrates that he was capable of\r\n    remembering other key events involving the divorce litigation, and while\r\n    Husband failed to bring the requested records, his excuse during the deposition\r\n    was that &quot;[he] didn't really read the subpoena. . . . [He] just saw it was\r\n    a subpoena and [he] read down to, you know, the date.&quot;Â  It is Husband's\r\n    burden to convince this Court that he demonstrated good and sufficient cause\r\n    for a continuance before the family court.Â  See Shirley v. Shirley,\r\n    342 S.C. 324, 329, 536 S.E.2d 427, 429 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating that this\r\n    Court's broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of his burden to\r\n    demonstrate that the family court's findings were in error).Â  Because Husband failed to sustain this burden, we find\r\n    the family court properly denied Husband's motion for a continuance.Â Â  \r\n  II.&nbsp; Evidentiary Issues\r\n  Husband\r\n    asserts that the family court committed two evidentiary errors, the first\r\n    relating to the exclusion of Husband's deposition testimony and the second\r\n    concerning the admission of Wife's attorney's fees information.Â  We disagree on\r\n    both claims of error.Â  \r\n  The\r\n    admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the family court.Â  See Gamble v. Int'l Paper Realty Corp. of S.C., 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474\r\n    S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996). For this Court to reverse a case based on the improper\r\n    admission or erroneous exclusion of evidence, the appellant must demonstrate\r\n    error and prejudice.Â  Osterneck v. Osterneck, 374 S.C. 573, 579, 649\r\n    S.E.2d 127, 131 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  \r\n  A.&nbsp; Husband's Deposition\r\n    Testimony\r\n  Husband\r\n    first argues that the family court's exclusion of certain portions of Husband's\r\n    deposition was prejudicial to Husband, particularly when Wife was permitted to\r\n    reference the deposition and the excluded portions were necessary to rebut\r\n    Wife's testimony.Â  We disagree. \r\n  At\r\n    the final hearing, Husband's counsel attempted to read portions of Husband's\r\n    deposition in response to Wife's statement that she did not recall Husband's\r\n    prior testimony regarding his income.Â  In response, the family court told\r\n    Husband's counsel that it would not permit Husband to bootstrap his deposition\r\n    testimony to Wife's testimony when Wife already stated she did not recall what\r\n    Husband was currently earning.Â  Â Â \r\n  Husband\r\n    now attempts to argue that this portion of his deposition should have been read\r\n    into evidence because the Rules of Civil Procedure permit the introduction of a\r\n    deposition when a witness is infirm or ill or when exceptional circumstances\r\n    exist such that the interests of justice would be served by introducing the\r\n    deposition.Â  Husband cites two subparts of Rule 32, SCRCP, in support of his\r\n    argument. Â Rule 32(a)(3), SCRCP, states: \r\n  \r\n\tThe\r\n    deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for\r\n    any purpose if the court finds: . . .Â  (C) that the witness is unable to attend\r\n    or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or . . . (E) upon\r\n    application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it\r\n    desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of\r\n    presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open court, to allow the\r\n    deposition to be used.\r\n\r\n  As\r\n    stated above, Husband has failed to sufficiently establish that he suffered\r\n    from a mental infirmity or medical condition to warrant the admission of the\r\n    deposition based on Rule 32(a)(3)(C).Â  Moreover, when Husband's counsel argued\r\n    for a continuance based on Husband's memory issues, he did not attempt to\r\n    introduce the deposition at that time to support his motion.Â  \r\n  Husband's\r\n    argument that the family court should have allowed the deposition based on\r\n    exceptional circumstances is also unpersuasive.Â  First, to admit a deposition\r\n    under Rule 32(a)(3)(E), a party must give notice to the family court that\r\n    exceptional circumstances warrant the deposition being read in open court.Â \r\n    While Husband's counsel may not have known prior to the hearing that Husband\r\n    would not attend, a plain requirement for application of this section is prior\r\n    notice.Â  At no time before or even during the hearing did Husband's counsel\r\n    argue for introduction of the deposition on this ground.Â  Second, Husband's\r\n    absence at the hearing does not rise to the level of an &quot;exceptional\r\n    circumstance&quot; to justify the deposition's admission, especially when\r\n    Husband concedes that he had notice of the hearing.Â  Furthermore, both of the\r\n    instances when Husband's counsel attempted to introduce portions of the\r\n    deposition were in response to Wife's recollection, or lack thereof, about\r\n    Husband's previous statements.Â  Husband cannot attempt to introduce testimony\r\n    favorable to Husband by way of his deposition when Husband could have testified\r\n    to the same had he been present at the hearing.Â  As such, the family court\r\n    properly exercised its discretion in refusing to admit Husband's deposition.Â  \r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Admission of Attorney's\r\n    Fees Affidavit\r\n  Husband\r\n    next claims that the family court erred in considering Wife's attorney's fees\r\n    affidavit when Wife previously asserted that her fee evidence was\r\n    attorney-client protected.[2]Â \r\n    We disagree.\r\n  Husband's\r\n    counsel objected to the introduction of Wife's attorney's fee affidavit before\r\n    and during the hearing.Â  The family court overruled his objections, finding\r\n    Husband never submitted a motion to withhold the issue of attorney's fees based\r\n    on Wife's refusal to respond and noting that because Wife requested attorney's\r\n    fees in her pleadings, it was proper to receive the affidavit into evidence.Â  \r\n  The\r\n    family court's rationale for accepting Wife's affidavit is well founded.Â  If\r\n    Husband felt that Wife's refusal to respond to the discovery requests on this\r\n    issue was so egregious as to warrant exclusion based on estoppel, Husband\r\n    should have attempted to compel production of this information prior to the\r\n    hearing. Â See Rule 37(a), SCRCP (&quot;[I]f a party, in response\r\n    to a request for inspection submitted under Rule 34[] fails to respond . . . or\r\n    fails to permit inspection as requested, the discovering party may move for an\r\n    order compelling an answer . . . or an order compelling inspection in\r\n    accordance with the request.&quot;).Â  Further, Wife's response to Husband's\r\n    request to produce states, &quot;[Wife] objects to this request under the\r\n    attorney/client privilege, however, reserves the right to produce it at a\r\n      later date or at the trial of this matter.&quot; (emphasis added). Â Wife\r\n    explicitly reserved the right to produce evidence on her attorney's fees at the\r\n    final hearing, and as stated above, Husband never moved for any additional\r\n    relief prior to the hearing.Â  Therefore, the family court's acceptance of Wife's\r\n    attorney's fee affidavit at the final hearing was proper.\r\n  III.&nbsp; Permanent Periodic Alimony\r\n  Husband\r\n    contends the family court declined to consider the factors set forth in S.C.\r\n    Code Ann. section 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2008), which resulted in an improper award\r\n    of permanent periodic alimony to Wife.Â  We agree.\r\n  The\r\n    decision to grant alimony and the amount granted are discretionary with the\r\n    family court.Â  Williams v. Williams, 297 S.C. 208, 210, 375 S.E.2d 349,\r\n    350 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Alimony is a substitute for support which is normally\r\n    incident to the marital relationship, and all facts and circumstances disclosed\r\n    by the record should be considered. Â Lide v. Lide, 277 S.C. 155, 157,\r\n    283 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1981).Â  \r\n  Section\r\n    20-3-130(c) sets forth thirteen factors which &quot;must be\r\n    weighed&quot; when determining alimony.Â  Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C.\r\n    411, 415, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886 (1994) (emphasis in original). These factors\r\n    include: (1) the duration of the marriage and the ages of the parties at the\r\n    time of the marriage and separation; (2) the physical and emotional condition\r\n    of each spouse; (3) the educational background of each spouse and the need for\r\n    additional education; (4) the employment history and earning potential of each\r\n    spouse; (5) the standard of living established during the marriage; (6) the\r\n    current and reasonably anticipated income of each spouse; (8) the marital and\r\n    nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) the custody of any children; (10)\r\n    marital misconduct or fault; (11) the tax consequences of the award; (12) the\r\n    existence of support obligations to a former spouse; and (13) other factors the\r\n    court considers relevant.Â  Â§ 20-3-130(c); see Patel v. Patel, 347\r\n    S.C. 281, 290, 555 S.E.2d 386, 390 (2001).Â  No one factor should be considered\r\n    dispositive.Â  Lide, 277 S.C. at 157, 283 S.E.2d at 833.Â  \r\n  Family\r\n    Court Rule 26(a) requires &quot;[a]n order of judgment pursuant to an\r\n    adjudication in a domestic relations case [to] set forth the specific findings\r\n    of fact and conclusions of law to support the court's decision.&quot; Â Rule\r\n    26(a), SCRFC.Â  When an order is issued in violation of Rule 26(a), this Court\r\n    may remand the matter to the family court or, when the record is sufficient,\r\n    make its own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance of the\r\n    evidence.Â  Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. 522, 524, 405 S.E.2d 821, 822\r\n    (1991) (internal citations omitted).Â Â Â  \r\n  With\r\n    regard to alimony, the family court stated in its order, &quot;[Wife] shall be\r\n    awarded the sum of Three Hundred Fifty-Three and no/100ths ($353.00) Dollars\r\n    per month in permanent, periodic alimony, terminable only upon the death or\r\n    remarriage of [Husband].&quot;Â  The family court failed to reference any\r\n    circumstances between the parties that would warrant an award of permanent\r\n    periodic alimony or discuss any of the elements from section 20-3-130(C) in\r\n    making its award.Â  Therefore, we reverse the alimony award and remand the\r\n    matter for the determination of Wife's entitlement to alimony based on a\r\n    consideration of all relevant statutory factors.Â  See Fuller v.\r\n      Fuller, 370 S.C. 538, 550-51, 636 S.E.2d 636, 643 (Ct. App. 2006) (remanding\r\n    determination of alimony based on failure of family court to set forth specific\r\n    findings to support award).\r\n  IV.&nbsp; Transmutation\r\n  Husband\r\n    argues the family court erred in classifying the home in which the parties\r\n    lived during the marriage as marital property.Â  We agree.\r\n  Identification\r\n    of marital property is controlled by the provisions of the Equitable\r\n    Apportionment of Marital Property Act (the Act).Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 294, 372\r\n    S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The Act defines marital property as all real\r\n    and personal property acquired by the parties during the marriage which is\r\n    owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation,\r\n    regardless of how legal title is held. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A) (Supp.\r\n    2008).[3]Â \r\n    Under the Act, property acquired by either party before the marriage is\r\n    nonmarital property. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(2) (Supp. 2008); see also Sauls v. Sauls, 287 S.C. 297, 300, 337 S.E.2d 893, 895 (Ct. App. 1985).Â \r\n    Â \r\n  The\r\n    spouse claiming an equitable interest in property upon dissolution of the\r\n    marriage has the burden of proving the property is part of the marital estate. Â Johnson,\r\n    296 S.C. at 294, 372 S.E.2d at 110.Â  If a spouse carries this burden, a prima\r\n    facie case is established that the property is marital property.Â  Id.Â  If\r\n    the opposing spouse then wishes to claim that the property is not part of the\r\n    marital estate, that spouse has the burden of presenting evidence to establish\r\n    its nonmarital character. Â Miller v. Miller, 293 S.C. 69, 71, 358 S.E.2d\r\n    710, 711 (1987).Â  If the opposing spouse can show that the property was\r\n    acquired before the marriage or falls within a statutory exception, this rebuts\r\n    the prima facie case for its inclusion in the marital estate.Â  Johnson,\r\n    296 S.C. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110.Â Â  \r\n  Even\r\n    if property is nonmarital, it may be transmuted into marital property during\r\n    the marriage. Â Id.Â  Transmutation occurs if the property is utilized in\r\n    support of the marriage, becomes so co-mingled as to be untraceable, or is\r\n    utilized in such a manner as to evidence an intent to make it marital property. Â Canady v. Canady,\r\n    296 S.C. 521, 523-24, 374 S.E.2d 502, 503-04 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Although one\r\n    spouse acquires legal title to property, the discharge of indebtedness by both\r\n    the husband and wife may transmute the property into marital property. Â Wyatt\r\n      v. Wyatt, 293 S.C. 495, 497, 361 S.E.2d 777, 779 (Ct. App. 1987). Â Transmutation\r\n    is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case, and the spouse\r\n    claiming transmutation must show that, during the marriage, the parties\r\n    themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage. Â Johnson,\r\n    296 S.C. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110-11. \r\n  Evidence\r\n    of intent to transmute nonmarital property may include placing the property in\r\n    joint names, transferring the property to the other spouse as a gift, using the\r\n    property exclusively for marital purposes, commingling the property with marital\r\n    property, using marital funds to build equity in the property, or exchanging\r\n    the property for marital property. Â Id. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 111.Â  The mere use of separate property to support the marriage,\r\n    without some additional evidence of intent to treat it as property of the\r\n    marriage, is not sufficient to establish transmutation.Â  Greene v. Greene,\r\n    351\r\n    S.C. 329, 338, 569 S.E.2d 393, 398 (Ct.\r\n    App. 2002).\r\n  Shortly\r\n    before Husband and Wife married, Husband purchased the remaining interest in\r\n    his late parents' home from his siblings. Â The home was at all times titled in\r\n    Husband's name, Husband was solely responsible for discharging the debt on the\r\n    home, and the mortgage payments to discharge the debt were drawn from Husband's\r\n    separate checking account. Â Wife testified that her presence in the home during\r\n    their marriage and her contributions to the upkeep and maintenance of the home\r\n    entitled her to share in the home's equity.Â  However, the record does not show\r\n    that her contributions were significant enough to transmute the property, and\r\n    the family court fails to set forth any findings in its order to clarify this\r\n    issue. Â While Wife made contributions to the home by paying household expenses,\r\n    cleaning, helping to remodel and update the home, taking out the trash, and\r\n    doing yard work, Wife failed to produce evidence that an appreciable amount of\r\n    marital funds were expended on these improvements.Â  See Murray v.\r\n      Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 158, 439 S.E.2d 312, 315 (Ct. App. 1994) (in denying the\r\n    wife's claim for transmutation, this Court found she failed to present evidence\r\n    that any appreciable amount of marital funds was expended on improvements to\r\n    the husband's home and rental properties as the wife's efforts were largely\r\n    routine duties such as cleaning and painting). Â \r\n  Further,\r\n    Wife's own statements do not indicate that she believed the home was a shared\r\n    asset of the parties.Â  Wife stated three separate times at the final\r\n    hearing that Husband's only contribution in support of her and her daughters\r\n    was that &quot;[Husband] gave [her] a place to live.&quot; Â Without further\r\n    evidence of a shared intent to transform the home into a marital asset, Wife's\r\n    and her daughters' presence in the home during the marriage is not sufficient\r\n    to establish transmutation.Â  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 295-96, 372\r\n    S.E.2d at 111 (&quot;The mere use of separate property to support the marriage,\r\n    without some additional evidence of intent to treat it as property of the\r\n    marriage, is not sufficient to establish transmutation.&quot;).Â  As such, the\r\n    home was not transmuted into marital property; thus, its inclusion in the\r\n    marital estate was error.Â  \r\n  Despite our finding that the home is Husband's\r\n    nonmarital property, if Wife can present evidence on remand that she\r\n    contributed to the home's appreciation during their marriage, she may be\r\n    entitled to share in any appreciation of the home resulting from her\r\n    contributions.Â  See Murray, 312 S.C. at 161-62, 439 S.E.2d at 317\r\n    (noting that while marital home was not transmuted, family court properly awarded\r\n    special equity in the home to the wife based on her direct and indirect\r\n    contributions); Webber v. Webber, 285 S.C. 425, 428, 330 S.E.2d 79, 81\r\n    (Ct. App. 1985) (citing Anderson v. Anderson, 282 S.C. 163, 164, 318\r\n    S.E.2d 566, 567 (1984) (&quot;A spouse has an equitable interest in\r\n    improvements to property to which he or she contributed, even if the property\r\n    is nonmarital.&quot;).Â  \r\n  Regarding the value and nature of Wife's contributions\r\n    to the home, no specific testimony exists on how her services and contributions\r\n    affected the value of the home.Â  See Murray, 312 S.C. at 158, 439\r\n    S.E.2d at 315.Â  Wife testified that she cleaned, mopped, washed windows, took\r\n    the garbage out, mowed the lawn, and assisted in remodeling and upgrading the\r\n    house.Â  However, Wife had no concrete figures on the appreciation of the home\r\n    as a result of her efforts.Â  Because the record is devoid of any evidence on\r\n    the initial value of the home, its appreciation during the marriage, or the\r\n    fair market value of the home on the date of divorce, we remand with\r\n    instructions for additional findings on these factors before determining\r\n    whether Wife is entitled to an equitable interest in the home. Â See Webber,\r\n    285 S.C. at 428, 330 S.E.2d at 81 (finding home was nonmarital but remanding\r\n    issue of whether the wife had an equitable interest in improvements to home\r\n    based on the extent of her contribution).Â  Consequently, the apportionment of\r\n    the marital estate should be remanded and redetermined consistent with this\r\n    portion of the opinion.\r\n  V.&nbsp; Division of Marital Estate\r\n  Husband\r\n    last argues that the family court erred in awarding Wife half of the marital\r\n    estate because his contributions were greater than those of Wife.Â  We disagree.\r\n  The\r\n    apportionment of marital property is within the discretion of the family court\r\n    and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â See Morris\r\n      v. Morris, 295 S.C. 37, 39, 367 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988). South Carolina Code\r\n    Ann. Â§ 20-3-620(B) (Supp. 2008) provides that the family court must consider\r\n    fifteen factors in apportioning the marital estate and give each factor its\r\n    proper weight.[4] Â On review, this Court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and\r\n    if the end result is equitable, the fact that this Court might have weighed\r\n    specific factors differently than the family court is irrelevant. Â Johnson,\r\n    296 S.C. at 300, 372 S.E.2d at 113; Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C.\r\n    492, 502-03, 478 S.E.2d 854, 859 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating that the reviewing\r\n    court will affirm the family court's apportionment of marital property if it\r\n    can be determined that the court addressed the relevant statutory factors with\r\n    sufficiency for the reviewing court to conclude the family court was cognizant\r\n    of the statutory factors).\r\n  In this case, the overall\r\n    distribution of the marital estate was equitable.Â  While the family court did\r\n    not make in-depth findings, the order stated that the 50/50 split was based on\r\n    the duration of the marriage and the direct and indirect contributions of each\r\n    party. While not all relevant factors appear to have been considered, we find\r\n    based on our view of the evidence that the apportionment was fair as the\r\n    parties were married for eleven years, neither party had minor children to\r\n    financially support on the date of divorce, and neither was at fault in causing\r\n    the dissolution of the marriage.Â  See Perry v. Perry, 301 S.C.\r\n    147, 152, 390 S.E.2d 480, 483 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding that although the family\r\n    court failed to make appropriate findings regarding the equitable apportionment\r\n    factors, the property division was fair and equitable).Â  While Wife's testimony\r\n    indicates Husband made more direct contributions to the acquisition of assets\r\n    in the marital estate, there is also testimony that shows that Wife made\r\n    indirect, quality contributions to the preservation of the marital estate.Â \r\n    Additionally, while Husband may not have been employed on the date of the final\r\n    hearing, the record indicates that both parties' earning potentials were\r\n    relatively commensurate. Â Based on these considerations, we find the 50/50\r\n    division of the marital estate was fair and reasonable. Â \r\n  conclusion\r\n  Based\r\n    on the foregoing, we affirm the family court's denial of Husband's motion for a\r\n    continuance and its ruling on the two evidentiary issues.Â  We reverse the\r\n    family court on the transmutation issue but remand for additional findings on whether\r\n    Wife is entitled to a special equity interest in the home.Â  We also reverse and\r\n    remand the issue of alimony for further findings based on section 20-3-130(C).Â \r\n    Last, we affirm the 50/50 division of the marital estate.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the family court's order is\r\n  AFFIRMED IN\r\n    PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\n  THOMAS,\r\n    GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Husband's financial declaration was submitted on June\r\n  22, 2004, approximately two months before his employment ended with Bi-Lo.Â \r\n  Wife did not submit a financial declaration until March 29, 2006, the day\r\n  before the final hearing.Â  Wife omitted her $300 monthly salary with the South\r\n  Carolina Credit Union in her declaration, which she acknowledged at the final\r\n  hearing.Â  Â \r\n[2] Husband contests\r\n  the award of attorney's fees based only on his claim that the family court\r\n  should not have considered her attorney's fee affidavit as the basis for the\r\n  award.Â  Nowhere does Husband argue that the family court erred in determining whether to award fees pursuant to E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812\r\n  (1992), or in determining the amount of attorney's fees pursuant to Glasscock\r\n    v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991).Â  See Griffith\r\n      v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 645, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534 (Ct. App. 1998)\r\n  (finding the family court erred in awarding attorney's fees when it failed to\r\n  set forth specific findings of fact on the record about each of the required\r\n  factors from Glasscock).Â  Because Husband failed to appeal Wife's\r\n  entitlement to an award of attorney's fees or the amount of attorney's fees\r\n  based on insufficient findings of fact, the award of attorney's fees is the law\r\n  of the case.Â  See In re Morrison, 321 S.C. 370 n.2, 468 S.E.2d\r\n  651 n.2 (1996) (an unappealed ruling becomes the law of\r\n  the case and precludes further consideration of the issue\r\n  on appeal); Griffith, 332\r\n  S.C. at 646, 506 S.E.2d at 534 (finding whether the wife was entitled to attorney's\r\n  fees was not appealed and therefore was law of the case).\r\n[3] Section 20-3-630 was formerly section 20-7-473. \r\n[4] Section 20-3-620 was formerly section 20-7-472.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-191","title":"State v.

DeWayne Pearson, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This\r\n  case is an appeal from a bond estreatment matter involving one defendant and\r\n  two bonding companies. Richard G. Thompson, d/b/a All Out Bail Bonding, and\r\n  Troy Bob, a/k/a Tracey Bowen, d/b/a Bonds by Gaynell (collectively bonding\r\n  companies) appeal from an order of the trial court estreating $55,000 on each\r\n  of the bonding companies' $100,000 bonds.Â  The bonding companies contend the\r\n  trial court erred in ordering the amounts estreated on each bond, asserting the\r\n  court failed to properly consider the necessary elements for bond estreatment\r\n  and the court abused its discretion in ordering a total estreatment of $110,000\r\n  on the two bonds.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn April 5, 2005,Kenneth Lee Lavender was arrested on drug\r\n  trafficking charges.Â  On August 31, 2005, his bond was set at $200,000 with\r\n  certain conditions, including that Lavender not leave the state, that he appear\r\n  at all scheduled hearings and trial, and that he keep the clerk of the State\r\n  Grand Jury advised of his home address.Â  He was released on an appearance\r\n  recognizance bond in the amount of $200,000, with Richard G. Thompson, of All\r\n  Out Bail Bonding, and Troy Bob,[2] of Bonds by Gaynell, executing the &quot;Order Specifying Methods and\r\n  Conditions of Release,&quot; each being responsible for $100,000.Â  Lavender\r\n  failed to appear at a scheduled status conference on April 7, 2006 and a bench\r\n  warrant was issued for his arrest that same day.\r\nFollowing the issuance of a rule to show cause to both bonding\r\n  companies and a September 29, 2006 hearing on the matter, the trial court\r\n  issued a form order on September 29, 2006, followed by an October 9, 2006\r\n  order, estreating the bond in the amount of no more than $90,000 for each bonding\r\n  company based on an incremental schedule.Â  Pursuant to the schedule, if\r\n  Lavender was presented within thirty days of the hearing, the bonding companies\r\n  would have no financial liability.Â  For every thirty-day period thereafter, the\r\n  bonding companies would be responsible in $15,000 increments for the first\r\n  several months, with $30,000 to be forfeited upon the passing of the sixth\r\n  month, until Lavender was presented or the total amount reached $90,000 for\r\n  each company.Â  The order further provided the bonding companies' relief from\r\n  further liability was subject to the State's right to request a hearing to\r\n  determine what, if any, compensation was owed by the companies for costs to the\r\n  State associated in locating and apprehending Lavender.\r\nThe bonding companies filed a motion for relief of judgment from\r\n  the 2006 order of estreatment. After\r\n  Lavender was apprehended in February 2007, the State filed a motion for rule to\r\n  show cause as to criminal and civil contempt in November 2007 based on the\r\n  bonding companies' failure to comply with the court's graduated scale of\r\n  estreatment.[3]Â  At a hearing on the matter, the bonding companies argued that\r\n  costs to the State should be considered, and the court should take note of the\r\n  fact that the companies paid $10,000 for a tip regarding a telephone number that\r\n  ultimately led to Lavender's location in Florida and his subsequent\r\n  apprehension.Â  The companies presented evidence that they began searching for\r\n  Lavender about a week to a week and a half after he absconded, when they discovered\r\n  Lavender had cut off his electronic monitoring bracelet.Â  The companies\r\n  detailed their various attempts to secure Lavender when they believed they had\r\n  found him, but were unsuccessful in attaining the necessary help from\r\n  authorities.Â  Ultimately, the bonding companies paid a confidential informant\r\n  $10,000 for a cell phone number belonging to Lavender, which the companies then\r\n  turned over to SLED.\r\nMax Dorsey, a Lieutenant in the vice unit of SLED, testified that\r\n  after the information was conveyed to him regarding Lavender's phone number,\r\n  SLED obtained a court order resulting in information from the telephone company\r\n  as to the area where Lavender was located.Â  Thereafter, he contacted the\r\n  Florida Department of Law Enforcement with the information and, after some\r\n  police work by that department, the Florida authorities were able to capture\r\n  Lavender.Â  Dorsey noted two SLED agents travelled to Florida to transport\r\n  Lavender back to South Carolina.Â  When asked about the money and man-hours\r\n  expended by SLED on the matter, he testified as follows:\r\n\r\n\tA:Â  Iâ€™m not sure, Ma'am.Â  I know we independently, outside of [the\r\n  owner of one of the bonding companies] and his group of bonding agents, had\r\n  made some attempts to locate Mr. Lavender.Â  We too had informants out there\r\n  that we're working with to find him, many, many man-hours by myself and the\r\n  other SLED agents assigned to the State Grand Jury.Â  \r\n\tNot to mention the amount of money from the phone records that\r\n  SLED had to pay for and then his eventual transport back to the State of South\r\n  Carolina.Â  Â \r\n\r\nThe State requested the court enforce its order of estreatment,\r\n  which at the point of capture of Lavender amounted to $60,000 per company based\r\n  on the graduated scale, but allowed $5,000 a piece for each bonding company\r\n  should be subtracted to reflect the total $10,000 the companies spent on the\r\n  tip which led to Lavender's arrest.Â  The State thus requested $55,000 be\r\n  estreated as to each company.Â  The bonding companies objected, arguing the\r\n  State failed to present sufficient evidence of its efforts in terms of monetary\r\n  expenses and the bonding companies made the effort resulting in the successful\r\n  apprehension of Lavender.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  taking the matter under advisement, the court issued its order estreating the\r\n  companies' bonds in the amount of $55,000 each.Â  The court noted that under the\r\n  original order, the companies would have been required to pay $60,000 a piece,\r\n  but &quot;[a]fter considering the costs to the State as well as the purpose of\r\n  the bond and the nature and willfulness of the default&quot; the court\r\n  determined, pursuant to Section 38-53-70 of the South Carolina Code Ann.\r\n  Section 38-53-70, that justice required each company forfeit $55,000.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from a decision on the forfeiture or remission of a\r\n  bail bond, the appellate court reviews the circuit court's ruling for an abuse\r\n  of discretion.Â  State v. McClinton, 369 S.C. 167, 170, 631 S.E.2d 895,\r\n  896 (2006).Â  \r\n\r\n\tAn\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit court's ruling is based upon an\r\n  error of law, such as application of the wrong legal principle; or, when based\r\n  upon factual conclusions, the ruling is without evidentiary support; or, when\r\n  the circuit court is vested with discretion, but the ruling reveals no\r\n  discretion was exercised; or when the ruling does not fall within the range of\r\n  permissible decisions applicable in a particular case, such that it may be\r\n  deemed arbitrary and capricious.Â  \r\n\r\nId. (citing Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 539,\r\n  354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987); S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 229\r\n  n.6 (2d Cir. 2001)).&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  bonding companies contend the trial court erred in failing to consider the\r\n  necessary elements in determining bond estreatments.Â  They further assert the\r\n  court abused its discretion in ordering a total of $110,000 estreated.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nI.Â  Failure to Consider\r\n  Necessary ElementsÂ Â  \r\nThe\r\n  bonding companies first contend the trial court gave only a cursory examination\r\n  of the factors it was required to consider and failed to properly address the\r\n  requirements in its ruling.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe issue of\r\n  whether a bond forfeiture should be remitted and, if so, to what extent is\r\n  vested in the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Holloway,\r\n  262 S.C. 552, 557, 206 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1974). Â In making a determination as to\r\n  remission of the judgment on a forfeited bond, the court is required to &quot;consider\r\n  the costs to the State or any county or municipality resulting from the\r\n  necessity to continue or terminate the defendant's trial and the efforts of law\r\n  enforcement officers or agencies to locate the defendant.&quot; S. C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 38-53-70 (Supp. 2007);Â  accord Ex parte Polk, 354 S.C. 8, 12,\r\n  579 S.E.2d 329, 331 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding section 38-53-70 unambiguously\r\n  provides the trial court must consider costs to the State in determining\r\n  remission of judgment on a forfeited bond).Â  However, in determining whether\r\n  any remission of the judgment is warranted, the trial court is not limited to\r\n  considering only the actual cost to the State.Â Â  Ex parte Polk, 354 S.C.\r\n  at 12-13, 579 S.E.2d at 331.Â  Rather, the court should consider, at a minimum,\r\n  the following factors:Â  (1) the purpose of the bond; (2) the nature and\r\n  willfulness of the default; and (3) any prejudice or additional expense resulting\r\n  to the State.Â  Id. at 13, 579 S.E.2d at 331.\r\nHere, the trial\r\n  court noted in its order the statutorily mandated consideration of costs to the\r\n  State in determining remission pursuant to section 38-53-70.Â  It further\r\n  acknowledged the three minimum factors enumerated in Ex parte Polk that\r\n  the trial court should consider, and discussed each of these factors as\r\n  pertinent to the circumstances.Â  Accordingly, we find no merit to the bonding\r\n  companies' assertion that the trial court failed to properly consider and\r\n  address the necessary elements.\r\nII.Â \r\n  Abuse of Discretion\r\nThe bonding\r\n  companies further argue the trial court abused its discretion in ordering\r\n  estreatment in the amount of $110,000.Â  They argue the trial court must, after\r\n  review of the Ex parte Polk factors, &quot;use its discretion in setting\r\n  an estreatment amount that fairly compensates the State for any costs and\r\n  prejudice suffered due to the bond skipper's absence&quot; and that nothing in\r\n  the record indicates the court used any cost analysis or reconciled the\r\n  estreatment amount to the cost and inconvenience placed on the State.Â \r\n  Accordingly, they contend the amount ordered estreated by the court was punitive,\r\n  as well as arbitrary and capricious, and represented an abuse of discretion.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe overriding\r\n  purpose of requiring a criminal defendant to post bond before his release from\r\n  custody is to ensure the defendant's appearance before the courts at\r\n  appropriate times.Â  Ex parte Polk, 354 S.C. at 11, 579 S.E.2d at 330; State\r\n    v. Workman, 274 S.C. 341, 343, 263 S.E.2d 865, 866 (1980).Â Â  When a bond is\r\n  violated by the defendant's failure to appear, the State has a right to full\r\n  estreatment.Â  State v. Cochran, 358 S.C. 24, 27, 594 S.E.2d 844, 845\r\n  (2004).Â  As guarantor, the surety on an appearance bond undertakes the risk of\r\n  forfeiture in the event the defendant fails to appear as required.Â  Ex parte\r\n    Polk, 354 S.C. at 11, 579 S.E.2d at 330.Â  When the terms of the bond are\r\n  breached, the bond is estreated by a conditional order and the bondsman is then\r\n  entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard to show cause as to why the\r\n  estreatment order should not become final.Â  State v. Boatwright, 310\r\n  S.C. 281, 286, 423 S.E.2d 139, 142 (1992) (Toal, J., dissenting).Â  Once the\r\n  bond has been estreated by the conditional order, another hearing may be held\r\n  to determine the amount, if any, to be remitted.Â  Id. Â However,\r\n  presentment of an accused after default does not entitle a surety to a remission\r\n  of the forfeiture as a matter of right.Â  Holloway, 262 S.C. at 555-56,\r\n  206 S.E.2d at 824.\r\nTurning to the Ex\r\n  parte Polk factors, it is undisputed Lavender was charged with serious drug\r\n  offenses for which the court required a substantial bond in the amount of\r\n  $200,000 in an effort to ensure Lavender's appearance. Lavender failed to\r\n  appear as required on April 7, 2006 and was not captured until some ten months\r\n  later.Â  The only evidence of record is that Lavender willfully absconded from\r\n  the jurisdiction, remaining at large for a substantial period of time.Â \r\n  Accordingly, he was willfully in default of his appearance bond, and his\r\n  actions placed the bonding companies in default of their obligation to produce\r\n  Lavender at his scheduled hearing.[4] Â Finally, the record clearly shows the State incurred considerable expenses in\r\n  the apprehension of Lavender.Â  Although it did not quantify a specific dollar\r\n  expenditure as the bonding companies desired, the record shows the State worked\r\n  independently of, as well as with, the bonding companies in its attempts to locate Lavender.Â  Agent Dorsey testified\r\n  he had his own informants out there that they worked with in order to locate\r\n  Lavender, and he and the other SLED agents assigned to the State Grand Jury\r\n  &quot;spent many, many man-hours&quot; on Lavender's apprehension.Â \r\n  Additionally, the State incurred expenses related to obtaining a court order to\r\n  acquire information from the telephone company, worked with the authorities in\r\n  Florida to capture Lavender, and sent two SLED agents to Florida to transport\r\n  Lavender back to South Carolina.Â  \r\nHere, the bonding\r\n  companies each undertook the risk of forfeiture of $100,000 a piece on\r\n  Lavender's appearance bond.Â  After Lavender absconded from the jurisdiction,\r\n  the court, in its initial order of estreatment, provided a graduated scale of\r\n  estreatment, allowing the companies to benefit by the earliest capture and\r\n  surrender of Lavender.Â  At the point of Lavender's apprehension, the bonding\r\n  companies faced estreatment in the amount of $60,000 under the prior order.Â \r\n  Upon reconsideration, and after analysis of the Ex parte Polk factors,\r\n  the trial court used its discretion in remitting an additional $5,000 for each\r\n  company, leaving them liable for only $55,000 on their original $100,000\r\n  potential obligations. \r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion by ordering\r\n  estreatment in the total amount of $110,000.Â  Accordingly, the order of the\r\n  trial court isÂ Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHUFF,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Apparently, Troy Bobâ€™s real name is Tracey\r\n  Bowen.\r\n[3] Due to some irregularities in regard to notice of the\r\n  previous estreatment order to all the parties, the court continued the hearing\r\n  and the State subsequently withdrew its motion for criminal and civil contempt.\r\n[4] While the bonding companies focus on the\r\n  companies' actions in attempting to locate and apprehend Lavender, our courts\r\n  have only indicated the focus on the willfulness component is from the\r\n  perspective of the criminal defendant.Â  See Boatwright, 310 S.C.\r\n  at 284, 423 S.E.2d at 141 (noting although the criminal defendant's failure to\r\n  appear was not found to be willful where he had been extradited to another\r\n  state, he otherwise breached the conditions of his bond when he breached the\r\n  condition of good behavior); Â Workman, 274 S.C. at 343-44, 263 S.E.2d at\r\n  866 (stating &quot;[e]ven assuming Workman acted wilfully when he breached the\r\n  good behavior condition of his [appeal] bond, those offenses bore no relation\r\n  to the offenses for which he had been convicted and the State was not\r\n  prejudiced thereby&quot;).Â  However, even assuming, without deciding, that the\r\n  matter is properly considered in light of willfulness from the sureties'\r\n  perspective, the trial court here clearly considered in its order the efforts\r\n  of the bonding companies to apprehend Lavender in regard to the willfulness of\r\n  default factor.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-199","title":"State v.

Quinn, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Ronald Paul (Tenant) appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  jury verdict and award of damages in favor of the Estate of Keith J. Buckles (Landlord),\r\n  and contends the circuit court erred by (1) declaring the partiesâ€™ lease had\r\n  statutorily terminated and (2) cancelling the recording of the lease agreement\r\n  and two lis pendens.Â  We\r\n  affirm. \r\n1.&nbsp; Tenant alleges the theory of res judicata barred the circuit court from hearing Landlordâ€™s\r\n  action for damages related to Tenantâ€™s alleged breach of a lease agreement\r\n  because the magistrateâ€™s court had previously adjudicated the matter. Â \r\nâ€œRes\r\n  judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the claims arise out\r\n  of the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior action\r\n  between those parties. Â . . .Â  To establish res judicata, the defendant must\r\n  prove the following three elements: (1) identity of the parties; (2) identity\r\n  of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue in the former suit.â€ Â Plum\r\n    Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999).Â \r\n  While we agree with Tenant that identity of parties exists in both actions, we\r\n  find no evidence the magistrate ruled following the December 15, 2004 ejectment\r\n  hearing or that Landlord raised the issue of damages for Tenantâ€™s alleged\r\n  breach of lease during the ejectment hearing.Â  Accordingly, res judicata did\r\n  not bar Landlordâ€™s subsequent action in circuit court.Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; Tenant\r\n  also alleges his improvements to the leased building were â€œtenant-ownedâ€ and\r\n  contends the circuit court deprived him of a property interest in the building\r\n  by declaring the lease statutorily terminated following Tenantâ€™s failure to\r\n  make demanded lease payments and subsequent abandonment of the premises in\r\n  December 2004.Â  We find Tenantâ€™s arguments unpersuasive.Â  \r\nA\r\n  tenantâ€™s leasehold interest is terminated by the failure to pay rent or\r\n  abandonment of the premises:\r\n\r\n\tFailure\r\n  to pay the rent agreed upon when due, or a reasonable rent for use and\r\n  occupation when demanded, shall terminate all tenancies for a term, for years,\r\n  from month to month and at will and the tenant shall forthwith vacate the\r\n  premises without notice.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C.

Â§ 27-35-140 (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  \r\n\r\n\tWhen a\r\n  tenant abandons premises theretofore occupied by him the landlord may enter and\r\n  take possession thereof . . . and the term of a tenant abandoning premises used\r\n  and occupied by him as such shall be deemed ended by such abandonment. Â Absence\r\n    from the property for fifteen days after default in the payment of rent shall\r\n    be construed as abandonment.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann.

The victim testified the photographs\r\n  accurately reflected the layout of the trailer, but did not depict the inside\r\n  of the trailer as it was on the date of the assault because the couches had\r\n  been replaced.Â  In explanation, the victim testified the couch in the\r\n  photograph was about the same size as the original couch.

Blanchette, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n          General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General William M. Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Kevin\r\n          S. Brackett, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Darrell R. Efird appeals his conviction\r\n  and sentence for assault and battery of a\r\n  high and aggravated nature as a lesser included offense of attempted\r\n  first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC),\r\n  arguing the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict on\r\n  the attempted first-degree CSC charge because there was no proof he used\r\n  aggravated force.Â  South Carolina Code\r\n  Section 16-3-652 (2003) provides: \r\n\r\n  (1) A person is guilty of\r\n    criminal sexual conduct in the first degree if the actor engages in sexual\r\n    battery with the victim and if any one or more of the following circumstances\r\n    are proven:\r\n  (a)\r\n    The actor uses aggravated force to accomplish sexual battery.\r\n\r\nFor first-degree CSC, &quot; '[a]ggravated force'\r\n  means that the actor uses physical force or physical violence of a high and\r\n  aggravated nature to overcome the victim or includes the threat of the use of a\r\n  deadly weapon.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651 (2003).Â  While the State must\r\n  show a defendant actually used aggravated force to overcome a victim for\r\n  first-degree CSC, in the instant case, Efird was charged with attempted\r\n  first-degree CSC.Â  &quot;Attempt crimes are generally ones of specific intent\r\n  such that the act constituting the attempt must be done with the intent to\r\n  commit that particular crime.&quot; Â State v. Nesbitt, 346 S.C. 226, 231,\r\n  550 S.E.2d 864, 866&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  &quot;In the context of an 'attempt'\r\n  crime, specific intent means that the defendant consciously intended the\r\n  completion of acts comprising the choate offense. Â In other words, the\r\n  completion of such acts is the defendant's purpose.&quot; Â State v. Sutton,\r\n  340 S.C. 393, 397, 532 S.E.2d 283, 285 (2000) (citations omitted).Â  In addition\r\n  to proof of intent, the State must show the defendant effectuated &quot;some\r\n  overt act, beyond mere preparation, in furtherance of the intent, and there\r\n  must be an actual or present ability to complete the crime.&quot;Â  Nesbitt,\r\n  346 S.C. at 231, 550 S.E.2d at 866.Â  &quot;[P]reparation consists in devising\r\n  or arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission of the crime;\r\n  the attempt or overt act is the direct movement toward the commission.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Quick, 199 S.C. 256, 260, 19 S.E.2d 101, 103 (1942).Â  At trial, the\r\n  State presented evidence showing Efird was attempting to have sex with the victim,\r\n  and after she refused, Efird physically grabbed her as she tried to fight him\r\n  off.Â  Further, the victim testified Efird only stopped because someone pulled a\r\n  car into the driveway of the house.Â  Therefore, the State presented evidence\r\n  supporting a conclusion: (1) Efird had the specific intent to use physical\r\n  force to overcome the victim in order to accomplish a sexual battery, and (2) Efird\r\n  performed an overt act towards the commission of the crime.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  must affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of Efird's motion for a directed verdict.Â  State v. McCombs, 368 S.C. 489,\r\n  493, 629 S.E.2d 361, 363 (2006) (stating if any direct evidence or substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, we\r\n  must find the case was properly submitted to the jury).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\nto Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-249","title":"State v.
