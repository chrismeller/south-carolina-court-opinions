Hicks Harwell, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-236Â Â Â \r\nHeard April 5, 2006 â€“ Filed May 9, 2006 \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJack M. Scoville, Jr., of Georgetown, for Appellant.\r\nRobert J. Moran, of Murrells Inlet, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Litchfield Beaches Property Owners Association (Litchfield) brought this action alleging Thomas S. Cerasaro[1] constructed an addition to his oceanfront home in violation of a restrictive covenant establishing a setback line.Â  The trial court granted partial summary judgment to Cerasaro â€œon the issue of the location of the setback line on his property as being measured one hundred (100â€™) feet from the mean [high-water] mark of the Atlantic Ocean.â€Â  Litchfield appeals.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nLitchfield is an unincorporated property ownersâ€™ association vested with the authority to enforce the restrictive covenants applicable to lots in the North Litchfield Beach subdivision in Georgetown County.Â  Cerasaro owns an oceanfront home on Lot 14, Section A of the subdivision.Â  Litchfield alleges Cerasaro constructed an addition to his home that violates a restrictive covenant establishing an oceanfront setback.Â  The parties dispute the actual location of the setback line.\r\nThe property Cerasaro now owns was once part of a larger, 45-acreÂ  parcel purchased by North Litchfield Beach, Inc. from the Boyle family in 1959.Â  The deed to North Litchfield Beach, Inc. referred to a May 1959 plat prepared by Samuel M. Harper, R.L.S. and described the property by courses and distances, e.g., â€œto the Atlantic Ocean; thence along the high[-]water mark of the Atlantic Ocean 6701 feet to the line of lands of International Paper Company,â€ and by metes and bounds, e.g., â€œButting and Bounding to the North by lands of Brook Green Gardens, to the East and Southeast by the Atlantic Ocean.â€Â  Thus, the deed to North Litchfield Beach, Inc. conveyed the property to the high-water mark of the Atlantic Ocean.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe deed excepted certain lots that the Boyle family had previously platted and sold.Â  All of the lots previously sold by the Boyle family, however, contained an area between the eastern boundary line and the Atlantic Ocean that was labeled, â€œSand Dunes.â€Â  These lots apparently were not conveyed to the high-water mark of the Atlantic Ocean.Â  \r\nNorth Litchfield Beach, Inc. caused a subsequent subdivision plat, prepared by Samuel M. Harper dated December 1959 (the â€œHarper Platâ€), to be recorded.Â  This document completed the subdivision of the property purchased from the Boyle family into multiple single-family lots.Â  The Harper Plat is filed in Plat Book O at Page 4.Â  \r\nOn January 22, 1960, North Litchfield Beach, Inc. conveyed Lot 14, Section A, the lot at issue here, to George Rowe Townsend.Â  The deed describes Lot 14-A as follows:\r\n\r\nThat certain lot of land situate, lying and being in the County of Georgetown and State of South Carolina, designated as Lot Number FOURTEEN (14) of SECTION A, on a Map of North Litchfield Beach made by Samuel M. Harper, R.L.S., dated December 1959, recorded in the office of the Clerk of Court for Georgetown County in Plat Book O, page 4.Â  \r\n\r\nThis deed contains neither courses and distances, nor metes and bounds.Â  It does, however, contain a list of fifteen enumerated restrictions.Â  Restriction seven provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n7.Â  The residence constructed on this lot, including porches or projections, shall not be erected nearer than 100 feet from highwater mark as shown on map, nor nearer than 5 feet to either side boundary lot, nor nearer than 25 feet to the rear line thereof, except in the event two (2) lots are purchased for the purpose of erecting thereon one single family dwelling the dividing line between said lots shall not be considered as a side line.Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  \r\n\r\nOn the Harper Plat, Book O at Page 4, Lot 14-A is depicted as a rectangle measuring 70 feet on the front and rear and 200 feet on both sides.Â  The front of the property faces west and borders Seaview Loop.Â  The rear of the property faces east and is bounded by a legend that says, â€œAtlantic Ocean.â€Â  The words â€œhigh-water markâ€ do not appear anywhere on the Harper Plat.Â  \r\nCerasaro acquired Lot 14-A, including a residence, from Albert H. Agett in 1987.Â  The deed contained the same general description as noted in the 1960 Townsend deed.Â  It similarly provides neither courses and distances, nor metes and bounds.Â Â Â  \r\nIn 2004, Cerasaro began construction of an addition to his home that extended to within 119 feet of the high-water mark of the Atlantic Ocean as it then existed.Â  Such improvements, however, extended beyond the boundary line fronting the Atlantic Ocean as drawn on the Harper Plat.Â  As a result, Litchfield brought this action alleging Cerasaroâ€™s construction violated the setback line and sought removal of the encroachment.Â  The parties disputed whether the setback line is to be measured from the undesignated line shown on the Harper Plat or whether it is to be measured from the mean high-water mark as it currently exists.[2]  \r\nCerasaro moved for summary judgment and Litchfield moved for partial summary judgment.Â  The trial court found the restriction was ambiguous, but resolved the ambiguity in favor of the free use of the property and granted partial summary judgment in favor of Cerasaro.Â  The court found for Cerasaro as a matter of law â€œon the issue of the location of the setback line on his property as being measured one hundred (100â€™) feet from the mean [high-water] mark of the Atlantic Ocean.â€Â  The court did not rule on the remaining issues of laches, waiver, and selective enforcement that were raised by the parties, noting those issues involved factual findings.Â Â  Litchfield appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate only â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.â€Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002); see also Baird v. Charleston County,&nbsp;333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, 74&nbsp;(1999) (â€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€).Â  \r\nâ€œIn determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Summer v. Carpenter,&nbsp;328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58&nbsp;(1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Ambiguity of Restriction\r\nLitchfield first argues the trial court erred in ruling the deed restriction is ambiguous.Â  Litchfield contends that, to the contrary, the restriction is unambiguous because the boundary line fronting the Atlantic Ocean on the Harper Plat clearly establishes the high-water mark as of December 1959 and thus permanently fixes the setback line as being 100 feet from that point.Â  We disagree.\r\nA contract is ambiguous when the terms of the contract are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Resources v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 550 S.E.2d 299 (2001).Â  Moreover, â€œ â€˜[a] contract is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.â€™ â€Â  Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 339 (1991)).\r\nIn this case, the deed restriction creates an ocean setback line at the â€œhigh[-]water mark as shown on map.â€Â  The problem is, however, that the Harper Plat referenced in the deed does not contain any notation as to where the high-water mark is located.Â  There is a line on the Harper Plat that ends along a line 200 feet from Seaview Loop, which could indicate the depth of the lot.Â  On the other hand, the notation on the other side of the line is â€œAtlantic Ocean.â€Â  Thus, it is unclear whether this line merely marks the edge of the property or if it is meant to be the high-water mark as of the time the Harper Plat was made in December 1959.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the restriction is ambiguous because the setback could be measured either from the usual high tide of the ocean or from the line purportedly showing the property border on the 1959 survey.Â  The trial court granted partial summary judgment to Cerasaro, ruling any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the free use of property, thus the proper interpretation, as a matter of law, is that the deed refers to the mean high-water mark as it exists today.\r\nIn our opinion, the parties cannot determine, without resort to extrinsic evidence, where the high-water mark existed at the time the restriction was created and where it is supposed to be on the map.Â  Moreover, even if the line were clearly marked on the map, there is further ambiguity as to whether the parties intended the setback line to be 100 feet from the high-water mark as it existed in 1959, thus creating a permanent setback, or whether it was to be interpreted as restricting construction closer than 100 feet to the high-water mark as it exists at the point of construction, as the mean high-water mark is subject to fluctuation over the years.Â  Therefore, we hold the trial court properly determined the deed restriction is ambiguous.Â  \r\nII.Â  Propriety of Granting Partial Summary Judgment\r\nLitchfield further argues that, in the event we uphold the trial courtâ€™s determination that the restriction is ambiguous, the trial court erred in resolving that ambiguity as a matter of law and granting partial summary judgment in favor of Cerasaro regarding the location of the setback line.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe construction and enforcement of an unambiguous contract is a question of law for the court, and thus can be properly disposed of at summary judgment.â€Â  Middleborough Horizontal Property Regime Council of Co-Owners v. Montedison\r\nS.p.A., 320 S.C. 470, 477, 465 S.E.2d 765, 770 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œIn such a case, summary judgment is proper and a trial unnecessary where the intention of the parties as to the legal effect of the contract may be gathered from the four corners of the instrument itself.â€Â  First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Conway Natâ€™l Bank, 282 S.C. 303, 305, 317 S.E.2d 776, 777 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Â \r\nIf, on the other hand, a contract is ambiguous or capable of more than one construction, the question of what the parties intended becomes one of fact and should, therefore, be decided by the trier of fact.Â  Middleborough, 320 S.C. at 477, 465 S.E.2d at 770.Â  â€œOnce a contract is before the court for interpretation, the paramount concern of the court is to give effect to the intention of the parties.â€Â  Id.  \r\nIn this case, the trial court found â€œ[t]he actual location of the oceanfront setback applicable to [Cerasaroâ€™s] property is either measured from the high[-]water mark of the Atlantic Ocean or the most easterly line shown on the original 1959 subdivision plat [the Harper Plat].â€Â  Having found such an ambiguity, the trial court erred in resolving it as a matter of law.Â  See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Resources v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550 S.E.2d 299, 303 (2001) (When construing a restrictive covenant, â€œ[o]nce the court decides the language is ambiguous, evidence may be admitted to show the intent of the parties.Â  The determination of the partiesâ€™ intent is then a question of fact.â€).Â  \r\nCerasaro asserts the trial court properly applied South Carolina case law by resolving the ambiguity as a matter of law in favor of the grantee and the free use of property.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. at 622, 550 S.E.2d at 302, our supreme court stated:Â  â€œ â€˜It is still the settled rule in this jurisdiction that restrictions as to the use of real estate should be strictly construed and all doubts resolved in favor of free use of the property, subject, however, to the provision that this rule of strict construction should not be applied so as to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the instrument.â€™ â€Â  (quoting Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 864 (1998)) (alteration in original).\r\nâ€œ â€˜The purpose of all rules of construction is to ascertain the intention of the parties to the contract.â€™ â€Â  Hansen v. United Servs. Auto. Assâ€™n, 350 S.C. 62, 68, 565 S.E.2d 114, 116 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Bruce v. Blalock, 241 S.C. 155, 161, 127 S.E.2d 439, 442 (1962)).Â  â€œResort may be had to rules of construction only where the language of the instrument, or of a portion thereof, is of doubtful or uncertain meaning, or is ambiguous or contradictory.â€Â  17A C.J.S. Contracts Â§ 303 (1999).Â  â€œ[W]here the terms are ambiguous, the question of the partiesâ€™ intent must be submitted to the [trier of fact].â€Â  Hansen, 350 S.C. at 68, 565 S.E.2d at 116.\r\nWhile the trial court correctly recognized Town of McClellanville favors construing the restrictive covenant here in favor of Cerasaro, under these circumstances we hold the trial court prematurely applied this rule of construction.Â  Once the trial court ruled the provision was ambiguous, the parties should have been allowed to present evidence as to the partiesâ€™ intent or the plain and obvious purpose of the restriction as these issues presented questions of fact that were not appropriate for determination as a matter of law on summary judgment.Â  See Hook v. Rothstein, 275 S.C. 187, 189, 268 S.E.2d 288, 289 (1980) (â€œThis court has often noted that summary judgment is appropriate only where it is perfectly clear that no genuine issue of fact is involved and inquiry into the facts is not desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€); 17B C.J.S. Contracts Â§ 743 (1999) (â€œEvidence as to the intention of the parties is relevant only if the contract in issue is ambiguous.Â  . . .Â  [I]n determining such intention the court may receive parol, or extrinsic evidence.Â  Extrinsic evidence in ascertaining the partiesâ€™ intent includes:Â  (1) the situation of the parties at the time the instrument was executed; (2) the circumstances under which the instrument was executed; and (3) the subsequent conduct of the contracting parties.â€).Â  Accordingly, we reverse the grant of partial summary judgment to Cerasaro and remand for further proceedings.[3]\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  This action was brought against the â€œThomas S. Cerasaro Qualified Personal Residence Trust Dated December 28, 2000,â€ but for purposes of this opinion we shall refer to the defendant/respondent as Thomas Cerasaro or simply, Cerasaro. \r\n[2]Â  If the setback is measured from the line shown as the eastern boundary of Cerasaroâ€™s lot on the Harper Plat, i.e., the line that is 200 feet from Seaview Loop, then Cerasaroâ€™s home addition is, admittedly, inside the setback line.Â  If the setback is measured from the current mean high-water mark, however, the addition definitely is not in violation of the restriction.Â  The trial court noted the mean high-water mark of the Atlantic Ocean as of March 24, 2004 was between 245 feet and 253 feet from Seaview Loop.Â Â Â  \r\n[3]Â  To the extent Litchfield also asserts on appeal that the trial court erred in failing to grant its motion for partial summary judgment, we find this question is not properly before us as the failure to grant a motion for summary judgment is not appealable.Â  Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 (1994) (stating the denial of summary judgment is not directly appealable, even after final judgment, because it does not finally determine the merits of the case).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-237","title":"SCDOT v.

Cottingham, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-237\r\nHeard March 7, 2006 â€“ Filed May 9, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMichael H. Quinn, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nBarbara Munig Wessinger, of Columbia, Larry B. Hyman, Jr., of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  McDonaldâ€™s Corporation (McDonaldâ€™s) appeals an Horry County administrative judgeâ€™s order granting the South Carolina Department of Transportationâ€™s (SCDOTâ€™s) motion in limine regarding evidence of damages arising from a prior condemnation action.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMcDonaldâ€™s owns property (the Property) in Horry County fronting the southern side of Waccamaw Boulevard (Waccamaw), a road which previously accessed Highway 501 (501) directly.Â  McDonaldâ€™s operates a restaurant on the Property, which rests a short distance from the Waccamaw Pottery Complex.\r\nTo improve traffic flow in the area, SCDOT decided to reconfigure the frontage road system along 501 near the Property.Â  Part of this reconfiguration included a change in access from Waccamaw to 501.Â  Instead of directly accessing 501, Waccamaw would connect to the new frontage road system and access 501 through a more circuitous route.Â  To complete the project, SCDOT also needed to acquire certain portions of the McDonaldâ€™s property.Â  Toni P. Elliott, SCDOTâ€™s right of way agent, contacted John Amendola, an employee of McDonaldâ€™s real estate department, to discuss the acquisition of portions of the Property, including 4,372 square feet fronting Bush Drive and a smaller strip of land abutting George Bishop Parkway.\r\nRobert M. Christopher, a licensed real estate appraiser hired by SCDOT, appraised the value of the Property both before and after SCDOTâ€™s proposed acquisition.Â  The appraisal specifically noted the remainder of the Property would â€œgenerally be the same . . . however, in the after situation, the access will change.â€Â  The appraisal indicated that the frontage road systemâ€™s reconfiguration would probably result in a net benefit to McDonaldâ€™s.Â  Christopher ultimately estimated the difference in the Propertyâ€™s value after the 1999 acquisition to be $42,800.\r\nElliott contacted Amendola, explained the results of SCDOTâ€™s appraisals, and offered McDonaldâ€™s $42,800 for the contemplated portion of the Property.Â  This offer is memorialized in a letter from Elliott dated February 3, 1998.Â  For approximately a year following the offer, the parties exchanged phone calls regarding the acquisition and the necessary relocation of the restaurantâ€™s sign.Â  Unable to come to terms on a definitive agreement on the signâ€™s relocation, SCDOT initiated condemnation proceedings (the 1999 condemnation) on February 18, 1999.\r\nThe 1999 condemnation notice describes SCDOTâ€™s acquisition as fee simple title to 4,372 square feet of land â€œ[w]ithin 55 feet of the survey centerline of Frontage Road 6F [formerly Bush Drive], on the left . . . Also herein condemned is property within 45 feet of the survey centerline of George Bishop Parkway, on the right . . . .â€ On March 8, 1999, Sandy Ligon, an employee of McDonaldâ€™s, contacted Elliott about the condemnation notice and indicated she â€œwanted to see if [they] could work the situation out without going to court.â€Â  As a result, the parties settled the 1999 condemnation action.\r\nOn March 23, 1999, McDonaldâ€™s executed a deed to SCDOT reciting consideration of $42,800 for the proposed portion of the Property.Â  The deed also expressly called for the relocation of the restaurantâ€™s sign.Â  Shortly thereafter, the parties executed a stipulation of dismissal with respect to the pending condemnation action, reciting that â€œthis case has been settled and, therefore, should be ended and stricken from the calendar . . . .â€\r\nIn 2000, SCDOT revised the plans for 501, deciding to elevate the highway and allow George Bishop Parkway to run underneath it.Â  As a result, SCDOT initiated a second condemnation proceeding against McDonaldâ€™s (the 2000 condemnation) to obtain an additional 520 square feet of land and â€œrights of access as may be needed for controlled access facilities.â€Â  On December 15, 2003, SCDOT filed a motion in limine requesting the court to exclude any reference to the change in access from Waccamaw to 501, arguing that this change was contemplated in the 1999 condemnation settlement and had no bearing on the current proceedings.Â  McDonaldâ€™s responded with it own motion, asking the court to prevent SCDOT from presenting evidence that McDonaldâ€™s had already received compensation for Waccamawâ€™s change in highway access.\r\nAfter a hearing on the motions, a special administrative judge for the Horry County condemnation roster issued an order granting SCDOTâ€™s motion and denying McDonaldâ€™s.Â  This appeal followed the denial of McDonaldâ€™s motion to reconsider.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and absent a clear abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law, the trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.â€Â  Vaught v. A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons, Inc., 366 S.C. 475, 480, 623 S.E.2d 373, 375 (2005).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMcDonaldâ€™s contends the circuit court erred in concluding the change in access from Waccamaw to 501 was contemplated in the 1999 settlement and, thus, not relevant to the present condemnation action.Â  We disagree.\r\nA motion in limine may be used in civil matters â€œto gain a ruling excluding evidence which is irrelevant.â€Â  75 Am. Jur. 2d Trials Â§ 102 (Supp. 2005).Â  â€œThe compensable measure of damages [in a condemnation proceeding is] the value of the land at the date of the taking plus any resulting injury to the remaining property offset by any benefits to the remaining land as a result of the project.â€Â  South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t v. Carodale Assocs., 268 S.C. 556, 563, 235 S.E.2d 127, 130 (1977) (emphasis added).Â  McDonaldâ€™s, therefore, must show that the damages from the change in access resulted from the present condemnation or were not contemplated in the 1999 settlement for evidence of such to be relevant to the present action.\r\nIt is uncontested that the alteration in access from Waccamaw to 501 did not result from the elevation of 501 over George Bishop Parkway.Â  McDonaldâ€™s instead bases it argument on whether the access alterations were contemplated in the 1999 settlement.Â  Settlement agreements are viewed as contracts between the parties.Â  Harris-Jenkins v. Nissan Car Mart, Inc., 348 S.C. 171, 177, 557 S.E.2d 708, 711 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAn action to construe a contract is an action at law reviewable under an â€˜any evidenceâ€™ standard.â€Â  Pruitt v. South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liability Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 343 S.C. 335, 339, 540 S.E.2d 843, 845 (2001).\r\nSCDOT submitted the affidavit of J. Williams Gobbel, a licensed professional engineer, to support its position the construction plans attached to Christopherâ€™s appraisal and sent to McDonaldâ€™s clearly show Waccamaw would no longer directly access 501.Â  Furthermore, Christopherâ€™s appraisal expressly indicated the change in access to the Property would not result in any pecuniary loss to McDonaldâ€™s.Â  The affidavit of McDonaldâ€™s professional engineer also notably admits that an experienced professional could discern from the plans that access from Waccamaw to 501 would be reconfigured by the initial project plans.Â  In addition, Elliottâ€™s records indicate she discussed the change in access with Amendola and he agreed the change in access could benefit McDonaldâ€™s in the long run.Â  Elliottâ€™s affidavit stated she commenced discussion with McDonaldâ€™s regarding the change in highway access as early as 1994, over four years prior to the 1999 settlement.[1]\r\nBecause there is evidence supporting the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion that any damages arising from the alteration of Waccamawâ€™s access to 501 were contemplated in the 1999 settlement, we conclude the circuit court did not err in excluding evidence of these damages from the current proceedings as irrelevant.Â  We briefly address the following arguments also presented by McDonaldâ€™s on appeal:\r\nI. South Carolina Code Section 28-2-280(C)(3)\r\nMcDonaldâ€™s argues section 28-2-280(C)(3) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) required SCDOT to include the change in access from Waccamaw to 501 in its 1999 condemnation notice.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe Condemnation Notice must . . . contain an appropriate legal description of the property to be taken or out of which an interest will be taken, and of the interest to be taken . . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-280(C)(3) (1991).Â  However, â€œ[a]t any time before or after commencement of an action, the parties may agree to and carry out, according to its terms, a compromise or settlement as to any matter, including all or any part of the compensation or other relief.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-40 (1991).\r\nIn the 1999 settlement, the parties clearly took advantage of section 28-2-40 and entered into a settlement of the condemnation action.Â  Therefore, whether SCDOT complied with the notice requirements of section 28-2-280 (C)(3) is immaterial to the present action when the circuit court determines the change in highway access was contemplated by the prior settlement.\r\nII. The Merger Doctrine\r\nMcDonaldâ€™s asserts the deed should have been the only evidence relied upon by the circuit court to determine the terms of the 1999 settlement.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, â€œa deed made in full execution of a contract of sale of land merges the provisions of the contract therein, and . . . this rule extends to and includes all prior negotiations and agreements leading up to the execution of the deed.â€Â  Charleston &amp; W.C. Ry. Co. v. Joyce, 231 S.C. 493, 504, 99 S.E.2d 187, 193 (1957) (internal citations omitted).Â  However, when â€œa deed constitutes only part performance of a preceding contract, other distinct and unperformed provisions of the contract are not merged in the deed.â€Â  New Prospect Area Fire Dist. v. New Prospect Ruritan Club, 311 S.C. 402, 405, 429 S.E.2d 791, 792 (1993).\r\nIn the present case, the circuit court concluded the deed was not the partiesâ€™ final agreement with respect to the 1999 condemnation, but was only the partial performance of the preceding settlement agreement.Â  The evidence supports this finding.Â  The deed was executed in March 1999, but the stipulation of dismissal, clearly a part of the settlement agreement, was not included in the deedâ€™s terms.Â  We conclude, therefore, that the circuit court did not err in considering evidence outside the deed in determining the terms of the 1999 settlement.\r\nIII. The Effect of the Stipulation of Dismissal\r\nMcDonaldâ€™s contends the effect of the stipulation of dismissal without prejudice was to void the 1999 condemnation notice and the resulting proceedings.Â  This issue is not germane to the present appeal.Â  After SCDOT filed a notice of condemnation, the parties entered into a settlement of the condemnation action.Â  The circuit court concluded this settlement contemplated the change in access from Waccamaw to 501.Â  The circuit court did not determine that the action was barred by concepts of res judicata, thus, the court did not misconstrue the dismissalâ€™s legal consequence.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] McDonaldâ€™s contends the circuit erred in addressing disputed facts in a motion in limine.Â  This issue is not properly preserved for our review.Â  See Long v.

Â Appellant Hutson is currently incarcerated and is expected to be released in January 2007.Â  We affirm.\r\nâ€œIn a termination of parental rights (TPR) case, the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.â€Â  Doe v.

Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  However, despite this broad scope of review, this court is not required to disregard the findings of the family court nor ignore the fact that the trial judge was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  This is especially true in cases involving the welfare of children.Â  Aiken County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilcox, 304 S.C. 90, 93, 403 S.E.2d 142, 144 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\nUnder South Carolinaâ€™s termination of parental rights statute, â€œ[t]he family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the [listed] grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2005).Â  If the family court finds a statutory ground for termination has been proven, it must then find the best interests of the children would be served by termination.Â  Id.Â Â  Significantly, as our supreme court has noted and the TPR statute provides: â€œTPR statutes â€˜must be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by terminating the parent[-]child relationship.â€™â€Â  Joiner ex rel.

Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 1999)).\r\nIn the current case, after considering all the evidence, the family court ruled that Appellantsâ€™ parental rights should be terminated based on several different grounds.Â  As to both Appellants, the court found: (1) The child has lived outside the home for a period of six months and during this time the parents have willfully failed to visit the child.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (3) (Supp. 2005); (2) The child has been in foster care for 15 of the most recent 22 months.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.

Lewis, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nEric K. Englebardt, and Jennifer D. Eubanks, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this appeal from an automobile accident negligence case, Dan Stewart claims the trial judge erred in admitting evidence that violated the collateral source rule.Â  Stewart also alleges the jury verdict with respect to damages was affected by this error and his motion for a new trial nisi additur should have been granted.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 6, 2000, Dan Stewart was involved in an automobile accident with Kevin Flynn, the owner of Flynn Construction Company. Â At trial, Flynn admitted negligence and left damages as the only issue to be determined at trial.Â  Flynn was driving a company truck when he ran into the back of Stewartâ€™s automobile.Â  At this time neither Stewart nor Flynn required medical Â attention. Â Emergency personnel did, however, transport Stewartâ€™s passenger to the hospital for treatment.Â  \r\nLater, when Stewart went to the hospital to visit the passenger, he requested medical attention for pain in his right wrist, right arm, and neck. Â The hospital found no broken bones and did not diagnose any head trauma.[1]Â  Stewart had a history of back pain and sought treatment for that pain before the accident. Â Ultimately Dr. John Haasis, a physiatrist, testified that Stewart suffered a 10% permanent impairment of his lower back as a result of the accident.Â  \r\nSome time after the accident, Stewart began to experience some facial pains.Â  Stewart described the pain as a ticking pain at first eventually turning into a constant and excruciating pain. Â In August of 2000, Stewartâ€™s family physician referred him to Dr. Jerry Sherrill, a neurologist, who diagnosed Stewart with trigeminal neuralgia. Â Trigeminal neuralgia is a condition resulting from inflammation of the trigeminal nerve, which causes severe, shock-like pain in the face.Â  Stewart underwent a procedure called a trigeminal rhizotomy, which is intended to burn the abnormally conducting sensory fibers of the nerve without affecting the portion of the nerve that controls motor function. Â Stewart temporarily lost the ability to move his right eye and permanently lost the ability of his tear ducts to naturally lubricate his right eye. \r\nThe two main issues at trial were the cause of Stewartâ€™s injuries and the damages stemming from them.Â  Both parties used expert testimony to support their claims.Â  Stewart alleged losses related to his past and future medical bills, past and future lost wages, and pain and suffering.Â  The jury returned a verdict in Stewartâ€™s favor, awarding him $14,000 in damages.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œExercise of [a] trial judgeâ€™s discretion [as to admission or exclusion of evidence] will not be disturbed on appeal absent [a] clear showing of abuse of discretion, the commission of legal error, and prejudice to rights of appellant.â€Â  Bonaparte v. Floyd, 291 S.C. 427, 437, 354 S.E.2d 40, 47 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  â€œOn appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of this court extends merely to the correction of errors of law, and a factual finding of the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses there is no evidence which reasonably supports the juryâ€™s findings.â€Â  Rogers v. Norfolk S. Corp., 343 S.C. 52, 59, 538 S.E.2d 664, 668 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nStewart claims the trial court erred in allowing Flynnâ€™s counsel to cross examine Mrs. Stewart regarding Mr. Stewartâ€™s Social Security Disability benefits.Â  This allegation is not properly preserved for our review.\r\nâ€œUnder the collateral source rule, a tortfeasor has no right to any mitigation of damages because of payments or compensation received by the injured person from an independent source.â€Â  Young v. Warr, 252 S.C. 179, 197, 165 S.E.2d 797, 806 (1969).Â  However, our courts have created a clear exception to the collateral source rule when the admission of such testimony is relevant to the witnessâ€™s credibility.Â  Rhodes v. Spartanburg County, 262 S.C. 644, 207 S.E.2d 85 (1974).Â  \r\nThe duty is on the litigant to make a timely objection in order to preserve the right of review.Â  Parks v. Morris Homes Corp., 245 S.C. 461, 141 S.E.2d 129 (1965).Â  â€œFailure to make an objection at the time evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to object.â€Â  Doe v. S.B.M., 327 S.C. 352, 356, 488 S.E.2d 878, 880 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nIn the present case, Flynn argued Mrs. Stewartâ€™s testimony that the family was struggling financially opened the door to cross examination on the Social Security Disability benefits.Â  Flynn intended to introduce the collateral source to show that the Stewarts were not in such bad shape financially and to lessen the emotional impact of Mrs. Stewartâ€™s testimony.Â  At this point in the trial the parties reached a compromise in camera.Â  Stewartâ€™s counsel agreed not to object to cross examination questions about Social Security income so long as the trial court gave a jury charge on the collateral source rule and so long as he was permitted to ask certain questions on redirect examination. \r\nWhen trial resumed both parties proceeded according to the compromise.Â  At the trialâ€™s conclusion the judge charged the jury on the collateral source rule.Â  Stewart argues in his brief that contrary to the agreement, the trial judge limited his ability â€œto explore and explain the issues raised by the admission of the collateral source.â€Â  Stewartâ€™s counsel apparently wanted to explore and explain the collateral source of income with testimony from Dr. Charles Alford, a vocational rehabilitation professional.Â  \r\nUpon review of the record on appeal, this court is unable to find any objections made by Stewartâ€™s counsel during either Mrs. Stewartâ€™s or Dr. Alfordâ€™s testimony.Â  Thus, Stewart did not make a contemporaneous objection, as required, to properly preserve the alleged error for appellate review.Â  State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 440 S.E.2d 869 (1994).Â  \r\nSince we find the admittance of evidence of a collateral source is not preserved for appellate review, we need not address the issue of whether that alleged error affected the juryâ€™s verdict, or whether it required a new trial nisi additur. \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[2]Â \r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] An x-ray of Stewartâ€™s spine showed an old compression fracture but no new fractures were detected.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-241","title":"Marin v.

Nichols, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nGarth H. White, of Charlotte, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this workersâ€™ compensation action, Juan Marin appeals the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s order denying Marinâ€™s claim for depression as a change of condition.Â  We affirm. 1  \r\nFACTS\r\nMarin filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim against Black &amp; Decker Distribution, Inc., and Speciality Risk Services (collectively â€œBlack &amp; Deckerâ€), asserting he was injured when a roll of plastic fell on his right leg while he was operating a forklift.Â  At the hearing on October 24, 2001, the issues presented to the single commissioner were (1) whether Marin was entitled to temporary total disability from March 2, 2001 to July 30, 2001 and (2) whether his alleged depression was causally related to the admitted injury to the foot. \r\nDuring the hearing, Marin testified the injury to his foot rendered him unable to walk, which caused him to be depressed because he was unable to support his family.Â  Marin denied experiencing depression prior to his injury and stated he believed his depression stemmed from his failure to provide for his family.Â  Marin became emotional when he spoke of his daughterâ€™s behavioral problems at school.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner held Marin was entitled to temporary total disability only from the date of the accident until March 26, 2001, when he was to return to work with restrictions but failed to do so.Â  She found that if Marin was depressed, the depression was unrelated to the injury and stemmed from his daughterâ€™s difficulties at school.Â  Accordingly, the single commissioner concluded Marinâ€™s claim for depression was not compensable.Â  \r\nOn February 15, 2002, Marin filed a motion to admit additional evidence to the commission, seeking to introduce medical records and a letter from his doctor dated January 15, 2002, in which the doctor opined Marinâ€™s depression was related to his pain.Â  The commission denied the motion, finding the evidence sought to be admitted did not meet the criteria of newly discovered evidence, pursuant to South Carolina Regulation 67-707 (Supp. 2005), because it was developed after the hearing.Â  \r\nOn appeal, the commission reversed the single commissionerâ€™s denial of temporary total benefits after March 26, 2001 but affirmed the denial of additional benefits related to a claim for depression.Â  Black &amp; Decker appealed the commissionâ€™s ruling on two issues unrelated to this appeal, and the circuit court affirmed the commission.Â  Marin did not appeal the commissionâ€™s decision finding his depression not compensable.\r\nOn August 20, 2002, Marin filed a request for a hearing seeking benefits for depression as a change of condition.Â  At the hearing before the single commissioner, Marin testified since the injury to his foot, he suffered from depression, and because his physical ailments have worsened, he contemplated suicide.Â  The single commissioner denied Marinâ€™s claim for depression as a change of condition, finding Marin had previously requested a hearing as to the compensability of his depression and because Marin had not appealed the decision finding his depression not compensable, that ruling was the law of the case.Â  Additionally, the single commissioner found the change of condition statute does not allow a claimant to maintain a change of condition claim for an injury that was previously considered and not compensated.Â  Further, the single commissioner found the doctrine of res judicata barred Marinâ€™s claim.Â  \r\nThe Appellate Panel of the Workerâ€™s Compensation Commission affirmed the single commissioner, adopting the single commissionerâ€™s findings in full.Â  The circuit court found the decision of the commission was supported by substantial evidence in the record and affirmed that decision.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  This court can reverse or modify the commissionâ€™s decision only if the appellantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the [commission] reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  \r\nThe determination of whether a claimant experiences a change of condition is a question for the fact finder.Â  Krell v. S.C. State Hwy. Dept., 237 S.C. 584, 588, 118 S.E.2d 322, 323-24 (1961).Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change of Condition\r\nMarin argues his claim for depression was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata but rather was compensable as a change of condition.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a litigant is barred from raising issues previously adjudicated between the parties in a subsequent action.Â  Hilton Head Ctr. of S.C., Inc. v.

Commâ€™n of S.C., 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987).Â  Res judicata requires three elements:Â  (1) a judgment that is final, valid, and on the merits; (2) the parties in the second action are identical to those in the first; and (3) the subsequent action must involve a subject matter properly included in the first action.Â  See Owenby v. Owens Corning Fiberglas, 313 S.C. 181, 183, 437 S.E.2d 130, 131 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nHowever, our workersâ€™ compensation statute allows for consideration of a change of condition.Â  South Carolina Code section 42-17-90 (1985) provides:\r\n\r\nUpon its own motion or upon the application of any party in interest on the ground of a change in condition, the Commission may review any award and on such review may make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in this Title, and shall immediately send to the parties a copy of the order changing the award.Â  No such review shall affect such award as regards any moneys paid and no such review shall be made after twelve months from the date of the last payment of compensation pursuant to an award under this Title.\r\n\r\nThis section is â€œlimited to the consideration of a change in condition of the injury on which the original award was made.â€Â  Estridge v. Joslyn Clark Controls, Inc., 325 S.C. 532, 537, 482 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  A change in condition occurs when a claimant undergoes a change in condition as a result of the original injury, occurring after the first award has been made.Â  Causby v. Rock Hill Printing &amp; Finishing Co., 249 S.C. 225, 227, 153 S.E. 2d 697, 698 (1967).Â  To be compensable, a mental condition must be induced by a compensable physical injury or by unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment.Â  Getsinger v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas, 335 S.C. 77, 80, 515 S.E.2d 104, 106 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In order to establish a modification based on a change of condition, the claimant must show a change of condition, and the change must be based upon a causal connection to the original compensable accident.Â  Krell v. S.C. State Highway Depâ€™t, 237 S.C. 584, 588, 118 S.E.2d 322, 323 (1961) (citations omitted).Â  Seeking review as a change of condition â€œis not available as an alternative to, or substitute for, an appeal.â€Â  Gattis v. Murrells Inlet VFW # 10420, 353 S.C. 100, 109, 576 S.E.2d 191, 195 (Ct. App. 2003). \r\nWe agree with the circuit court that Owenby v. Owens Corning Fiberglas, 313 S.C. 181, 437 S.E.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1993), is applicable to the present case.Â  In Owenby, the claimant suffered a work-related injury when a piece of glass became embedded in her finger.Â  The finger became infected and had to be partially amputated.Â  The circuit court and Full Commission affirmed the Single Commissionerâ€™s denial of benefits for psychological injury.Â  The claimant did not appeal.Â  Subsequently, the claimant filed a change of condition form based upon the full amputation of her finger and the worsening of her psychological condition.Â  This court, finding that res judicata barred the claimantâ€™s claim, stated:\r\n\r\nAll three elements are present in the case at hand.Â  In the first action, the trial court affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s finding that any psychological problems suffered by Owenby did not result from her injury and were not compensable.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order was not appealed and, therefore, became a final, valid judgment on the merits.Â  The parties are identical to those in the first action and the issue is the same.Â  Moreover, there is ample evidence on the record that any psychological problems currently suffered by Owenby are a continuation of her previously existing condition which was ruled upon in the initial action.\r\n\r\nId. at 183, 437 S.E.2d at 131-32.Â  \r\nIn the present case, the single commissioner in the initial claim found Marinâ€™s claim for depression not compensable.Â  Additionally, the single commissioner found if Marin was indeed depressed, his depression was not causally related to his injury.Â  Rather, the depression stemmed from his daughterâ€™s behavioral problems at school.Â  The commission affirmed the ruling.Â  Because Marin did not appeal from the full commissionâ€™s order denying benefits for his depression, that ruling became a final, valid judgment on the merits.Â  It is undisputed the parties are the same in both actions.Â  Further, Marinâ€™s claim for depression was fully litigated and decided in the first action.Â  Marinâ€™s claim for depression was raised, ruled upon, and not appealed.Â  \r\nMarin relies on Brayboy v. Clark Heating Co., 306 S.C. 56, 59 n.2, 409 S.E.2d 767, 769 n.2 (1991), for the proposition that a claim for a change of condition may be based upon undiagnosed conditions, resulting from the original injury, which are discovered after the first award.Â  Marin argues because the depression was undiagnosed by medical providers until after the first hearing, his claim falls within the type of claim contemplated by Brayboy.Â  Although it is true a change of condition may be based upon undiagnosed conditions that arise subsequent to the hearing, in this case the depression now asserted as a changed condition existed when the commission entered its May 14, 2002 order.Â  Marin cannot now assert he was unaware of his condition because it was not formally diagnosed when he specifically sought benefits for his depression claim at the first hearing.Â  Marin repeatedly testified at the first hearing he believed his depression stemmed from his work-related injury.Â  As stated in the order of the single commissioner adopted in full by the commission, â€œIt is noted that the evidence submitted by claimant from Dr. Patterson in addition to claimantâ€™s own testimony at the first hearing reveals that claimant has complained of depressive symptoms throughout the pendency of this claim.â€Â  \r\nMarin asserts his claim is consistent with Gattis.Â  In Gattis, the claimant filed a Form 50 seeking additional treatments from his doctor.Â  After a hearing held August 19, 1998, the single commissioner found the claimant had not reached MMI and ordered the employer to pay for the treatment.Â  At the hearing before the commission, the claimant sought to introduce a letter from the doctor dated August 18, 1998.Â  The commission refused to allow the admission of the letter, noting that the letter would provide the claimaint with â€œthe opportunity for a change of condition request.â€Â  The commission held the claimant had reached MMI and denied additional treatments.Â  No appeal was taken from this order.Â  The claimant soon thereafter filed a claim for a change of condition.\r\nThe commission affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s holding that a change of condition had occurred effective August 18, 1998.Â  The circuit court affirmed this ruling.Â  This court also affirmed.Â  We held, â€œBecause the commission limited its order to a determination of Claimantâ€™s condition prior to August of 1998, subsequent events, including Dr. Hortonâ€™s changed diagnosis in August of 1998, were appropriate for consideration in an action alleging a change of condition.â€Â  Id. at 109, 576 S.E.2d at 195-96.Â  We find Gattis inapplicable to Marinâ€™s case.\r\nIn the initial action in the present case, the commission did not place a limit on a timeframe in its consideration of Marinâ€™s condition.Â  As stated above, it fully considered Marinâ€™s claim that his depression was compensable and rejected this claim.\r\nFinally, Marin asserts he is entitled to continuing medical treatment for his depression under Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc., 334 S.C. 574, 514 S.E.2d 593 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In Dodge, this court held that the commission may require additional medical care and treatment even if the claimaint had reached maximum medical improved if such treatment would tend to lessen the period of disability.Â  Id.Â  at 581, 514 S.E.2d at 597.Â  The injury for which the claimant in Dodge sought additional treatment was work-related.Â  In the present case, the commission determined in the initial action that Marinâ€™s depression was not work-related and as stated above, any claim for depression is now barred by res judicata.Â  Therefore, Dodge is clearly inapplicable to the present case.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThus, we find the commissionâ€™s determination that Marinâ€™s depression is not compensable as a change of condition is supported by substantial evidence.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the order of the circuit court affirming the commissionâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-242","title":"Maness v.

Terry Wayne Maness, Op. No. 86-MO-101 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 5, 1986).Â  Maness filed two subsequent applications for post-conviction relief, both of which were dismissed.Â  Furthermore, Maness filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of South Carolina, which was also dismissed.Â  \r\nOn January 5, 2005, Maness sent a second application for a writ of habeas corpus to the Clerk of Court for Anderson County (the Clerk).Â  This application raised the same issues as those alleged in his prior application to the Supreme Court of South Carolina.Â  The Clerk returned this application with a note stating: â€œThere is still a filing fee of $150.00, or you can fill this [motion to proceed in forma pauperis] out and see if the judge will O.K. it.Â  *Shouldnâ€™t this be in FED.

Gambrell and John Sanford Kay, both of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jara Uzenda Gobbi appeals the trial judgeâ€™s decision to deny her in forma pauperis status.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nGobbi and her ex-husband, Scott Gobbi, had numerous properties in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, that went into foreclosure.Â  Several foreclosure actions were filed against Gobbi, and she removed them to federal court.Â  Gobbi also filed several civil actions in state court against the various lien holders.Â  In civil action number 2002-CP-26-3044, Gobbi sued SunTrust Mortgage and various other lien holders.Â  On December 4, 2002, Judge Baxley dismissed the action, finding the action was â€œvexacious to the Defendantsâ€ and noting that the case was â€œsuccessive, repetitive, and involve[d] matters which are res judicata as to all of the Defendants.â€Â  Judge Baxley ordered that Gobbi was prohibited from filing â€œany new or additional lawsuits, motions, writs, or any documents requesting any relief of any sort . . . arising from the same core set of facts and circumstances involved in this case, upon penalty of contempt . . . .â€Â  \r\nIn the underlying matter, the Bank of New York sought to foreclose on one of Gobbiâ€™s properties in case number 02-CP-26-3774.[2]Â  Thereafter, the claim was transferred to SunTrust Mortgage.Â  At some point in time, SunTrustâ€™s original attorney was relieved.Â  Gobbi filed several motions, including a motion to compel the answers of her co-defendants; a motion to dismiss; a motion to proceed in forma pauperis and exempt service on non-answering defendants; and a motion to compel the grounds for relieving SunTrustâ€™s former attorney.Â Â  \r\nOn January 5, 2004, hearings were held before Judge Cottingham on thirty-eight motions in numerous suits involving Gobbi.Â  After the hearing on the motions in case number 02-CP-26-3774, Judge Cottingham orally granted Gobbiâ€™s motion to proceed in forma pauperis; granted her request not to serve the non-answering defendants; and denied the remaining motions.Â  A form order was issued to that effect that same day.Â  On January 8, 2004, Judge Cottingham sua sponte reconsidered his ruling on the in forma pauperis status.Â  Judge Cottingham issued another form order stating: â€œAfter review I have concluded my order of Jan 5, 2004 allowing the defendant Jara Gobbi to proceed in forma pauperis was improvidently granted, and that motion is hereby denied.â€Â  Judge Cottingham denied Gobbiâ€™s motion for reconsideration in a formal order, noting that he reversed his decision on the in forma pauperis status â€œafter reflection and review of the voluminous record involving the litigation involving Defendant Jara Gobbi.â€Â  He held that requiring Gobbi to pay the filing fee would act as a deterrent to abusive and frivolous filings.Â  Judge Cottingham further found that Gobbi had previously been â€œsanctioned for abusive and frivolous filings on two prior occasions by Judge Baxley, and [had] been threatened with sanctions by the Honorable Cameron M. Currie.Â  In light of her prior history of litigation and discovery abuse, Defendant Jara Gobbiâ€™s request for leave to proceed informa pauperis is again DENIED.â€Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nGobbi argues Judge Cottingham lacked jurisdiction in the underlying matter and the order denying in forma pauperis status was void.Â  She asserts Judge Baxley previously ruled on the matters, Judge Baxleyâ€™s prior order was res judicata, and Judge Baxley should have been the judge to rule on her motions.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we address whether the judge had jurisdiction to sua sponte change the order regarding the in forma pauperis status.Â  â€œUnder Rule 59(e), SCRCP, the trial judge has only ten days from entry of judgment to alter or amend an earlier order on his own initiative absent a â€˜reservationâ€™ of jurisdiction in the form order.â€Â  Leviner v. Sonoco Prod. Co., 339 S.C. 492, 494, 530 S.E.2d 127, 128 (2000).Â  Judge Cottingham sua sponte reversed his order granting Gobbi in forma pauperis status three days after its issuance.Â  This is within ten days of entry of judgment.Â  Thus, Judge Cottingham had the jurisdiction to change the order on his own initiative.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe now turn to Gobbiâ€™s allegation that Judge Baxley, not Judge Cottingham, had jurisdiction over the underlying matter.[3]Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provide a mechanism for replacing a judge when he or she is unable to continue in a case:\r\n\r\nIf by reason of death, sickness, or other disability, a judge before whom an action has been tried is unable to perform the duties to be performed by the court under these rules after a verdict is returned or findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed, then the resident judge of the circuit or any other judge having jurisdiction in the court in which the action was tried may perform those duties; but if such other judge is satisfied that he cannot perform those duties because he did not preside at the trial or for any other reason, he may in his discretion grant a new trial.\r\n\r\nRule 63, SCRCP.[4]Â  \r\nAt the January 5, 2004 motions hearing in the underlying action, Gobbi argued civil action number 2002-CP-26-3774 should be dismissed because Judge Baxleyâ€™s prior order held that all of the issues concerning foreclosure had been decided and that no further actions should be filed under penalty of contempt.Â  After Judge Cottingham denied her motions, she moved for reconsideration, requesting a ruling as to whether jurisdiction was with Judge Baxley or with Judge Cottingham.Â Â  \r\nGobbi argued at the hearing on the motion for reconsideration that Judge Baxley still had jurisdiction over the matter.Â  In his March 4, 2004 order, Judge Cottingham ruled that Judge Baxley was â€œdisabledâ€ for the purposes of Rule 63, SCRCP, because he was no longer assigned to that judicial circuit:\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, the issue was raised of whether Judge Baxley, a Circuit Court judge temporarily assigned to Horry County from another judicial circuit is â€œdisabledâ€ pursuant to Rule 63, SCRCP.Â  At the hearing, I ruled that because Judge Baxley is no longer assigned to this judicial circuit, he was â€œdisabledâ€ pursuant to Rule 63, SCRCP.Â  Therefore the Chief Administrative Judge of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit took the appropriate step to reassign this case to me to make all necessary determinations in this case.Â  Upon further review, my ruling was appropriate in light of Ness v. Eckerd Corp., 350 S.C. 399, 566 S.E.2d 193 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n\r\nGobbi asserts Judge Cottingham erred in his ruling because Judge Baxley was not sick, deceased, or otherwise disabled merely because he was out of the circuit.Â  However, we agree with Judge Cottingham that Judge Baxley was no longer assigned to the circuit.Â  Nothing in the record indicates that Judge Cottingham could not become familiar with the case.Â  There is no evidence in the record that Judge Baxley was the only judge assigned to Gobbiâ€™s numerous civil actions.Â  Further, judicial ecomony was served when Judge Cottingham was assigned as the judge to hear all thirty-eight motions on January 5, 2004.Â  Because the intent of Rule 63 is to allow a smooth transition from a judge who is unable to complete a case to a judge who can complete the case, we find no error with Judge Cottinghamâ€™s ruling.Â  Accordingly, Judge Cottingham properly exercised his jurisdiction to rule on Gobbiâ€™s motions.Â  \r\nII.Â  Entitlement to In Forma Pauperis Status\r\nGobbi argues Judge Cottingham erred in denying her in forma pauperis status because SunTrust did not object to the status.Â  Therefore, Gobbi argues, Judge Cottinghamâ€™s decision was without evidentiary support and was arbitrary and baseless.Â  We find no error.\r\nGenerally, a plaintiff seeking to file an action in forma pauperis files a motion to proceed under that status along with the proposed complaint and an affidavit of indigency.Â  Rule 3(c), SCRCP.Â  However, a judge may deny a party in forma pauperis status to prevent fraud and abuse.Â  See In re Maxton, 325 S.C. 3, 5, 478 S.E.2d 679, 679 (1996) (denying an inmate in forma pauperis status and threatening him with sanctions where inmate had frivolously filed sixty-four motions concerning the same or related matters).Â  The decision to deny a party in forma pauperis status will not be reversed where there are specific findings that a partyâ€™s repetitive filings are frivolous and abusive.Â  See Lakes v. State, 333 S.C. 382, 386, 510 S.E.2d 228, 230-31 (Ct. App. 1999) (reversing a judgeâ€™s denial of in forma pauperis status in a post-conviction relief action where the order failed to include factual findings that the inmateâ€™s numerous filings rose to the level of the repetitive and abusive filings in Maxton). \r\nIn her motion to proceed in forma pauperis, Gobbi alleged she was financially devastated by the more than twenty-four actions she was involved in.Â  Gobbi did not present any other evidence to support her allegation that she was indigent.Â  Evidence in the record did show, however, that Gobbi was threatened with sanctions for frivolous filings on prior occasions.Â  Judge Baxley ruled on matters in at least ten civil actions involving the same core facts and circumstances.Â  Noting that Gobbi filed additional, repetitive, non-meritorious motions in the cases after the actions were ended, Judge Baxley prohibited her from filing any new lawsuits, motions, writs or any other documents seeking relief arising from the same core set of facts upon penalty of contempt.Â  Judge Cameron M. Currie remanded to state court Gobbiâ€™s removal of eight foreclosure actions to federal court and dismissed her initiation of one action against various attorneys and SunTrust in federal court.Â  In denying Gobbiâ€™s motion for reconsideration, Judge Currie advised Gobbi that if she persisted in filing motions in the litigation, the court could determine the motions to be frivolous and impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 11(c), Fed. R. Civ. P.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nJudge Cottinghamâ€™s order in the present case denying in forma pauperis status to Gobbi is supported by the record.Â  Judge Cottingham made a specific finding that Gobbi filed numerous, frivolous lawsuits concerning the same matters.Â  Judge Baxley and Judge Currie also warned Gobbi that her numerous filings were frivolous and could warrant sanctions.Â  Because Judge \r\n  Cottingham made specific findings that Gobbiâ€™s numerous filings were frivolous and amounted to litigation abuse, we find no error with the decision to deny in forma pauperis status.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nJudge Cottingham had proper jurisdiction to determine the issues before him.Â  Further, Judge Cottinghamâ€™s order denying Gobbi in forma pauperis status is supported by the record.Â  Accordingly, the order of Judge Cottingham is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The lien holder also sought to foreclose on another of Gobbiâ€™s properties in civil action number 02-CP-26-2639.Â  Gobbi originally appealed the lower courtâ€™s decision on her motions in that case number as well.Â  By order dated December 13, 2004, this court determined that Gobbiâ€™s appeal of all of the issues in civil action number 02-CP-26-2639 was interlocutory.Â  Thus, the only issue remaining on appeal for us to determine is whether the trial judge erred in denying Gobbiâ€™s motion to file in forma pauperis in civil action number 02-CP-26-3774.Â  \r\n[3]Â  We note Gobbi did not raise her argument that Judge Baxley was the appropriate judge to hear the matter until her motion for reconsideration.Â  Generally, this would render the matter unpreserved for appellate review.Â  See Eaddy v. Oliver, 345 S.C. 39, 44, 545 S.E.2d 830, 833(Ct. App. 2001) (holding that a party cannot use a motion for reconsideration to present an issue that could have been raised prior to the judgment but was not).Â  Nothing in Rule 63, SCRCP indicates substitution of a judge raises concerns about the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.Â  See Watson v.

Mark Hayes, II, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-244\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2006 â€“ Filed May 16, 2006\r\n\r\n AFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nTheo W. Mitchell, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Appellant Darrel Jackson appeals his conviction of animal cruelty to twelve pit bull dogs.Â  The conviction forfeited his right to custody and ownership of his pit bulls pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. section 47-1-170 (Supp. 2005).Â  According to section 47-1-150(F), the Humane Society was empowered to make â€œhumane dispositionâ€ of all Jacksonâ€™s vicious and dangerous pit bulls.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 47-1-150(F) (Supp. 2005).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFacts\r\nOn October 13, 2003, Elizabeth Tilley, an employee of the City of Spartanburg Animal Control, went to 433 Farley Avenue to investigate a claim regarding thirty-one pit bulls.Â  When Tilley arrived, she located only twenty-one pit bulls.Â  She described the dogs as looking very thin with â€œbig, heavy chains.â€ Â Because Tilley could clearly see their rib cages and several of the dogs had â€œswollen stomachs,â€ she called a Spartanburg City Public Safety Officer.Â  Once the officer arrived, Tilley and the officer photographed the dogs in the backyard.Â  Several dogs were chained closely to their doghouses, surrounded by feces and trash.Â  Jacksonâ€™s mother owned the house.Â  Jackson admitted the pit bulls belonged to him.\r\nBased on the evidence, Tilley was granted a search warrant, which she executed on October 14 at 433 Farley Avenue.Â  At that time, Tilley and several other officers seized the dogs and the chains.Â  The chains were so heavy and cumbersome that Tilley and the officers were forced to contact the Spartanburg Public Safety Fire Department in order to use their bolt cutters.\r\nDr. Jean Stewart Hovis, DVM, examined the pit bulls upon their arrival at the Humane Society.Â  Dr. Hovis opined that all of the dogs were moderately to severely underweight and many had multiple bite marks.Â  Furthermore, their chains were extremely heavy and proportionally excessive to individual body mass. Â Many of the chains weighed more than half of the dogâ€™s own weight.\r\nJackson was charged with the ill treatment of twenty-one pit bull dogs.Â  He was tried in magistrateâ€™s court.Â  The jury found Jackson guilty on twelve counts and not guilty on nine counts.Â  Two counts were dismissed because two dogs died prior to the trial.Â  He was sentenced to ninety days in jail or a fine of $7,575.\r\nJackson appealed to the circuit judge, who upheld his convictions and sentences.Â  An order granting custody to the Humane Society for humane disposition of the remaining dogs was affirmed.Â  Jackson appeals the forfeiture of the ten living pit bulls and the Humane Societyâ€™s custody for purposes of a humane disposition.Â  He does not challenge his conviction or any other aspect of the sentence.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn criminal appeals from magistrate or municipal court, the circuit court does not conduct a de novo review, but instead reviews for preserved error raised to it by appropriate exception. Â State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Henderson, 347 S.C. 455, 556 S.E.2d 691 (Ct. App. 2001). Â The appellate court reviewing the criminal appeal from the circuit court may review for errors of law only. Â State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 199 S.E.2d 61 (1973); Henderson, 347 S.C. at 457, 556 S.E.2d at 692. Â In criminal cases, the court of appeals sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous. Â State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 625 S.E.2d 239 (Ct. App. 2006); Landis, 362 S.C. at 101, 606 S.E.2d at 505.\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nI. Â The Order\r\n\r\nAn argument not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court is not preserved for review.Â  See State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 599 S.E.2d 448 (2004) (noting that, to be preserved for appellate review, issue must be raised and ruled upon in the trial court).Â  The appellant has â€œthe responsibility to identify errors on appeal, not the court.â€ Â Kennedy v. South Carolina Ret. Sys., 349 S.C. 531, 532-33, 564 S.E.2d 322, 322-23 (2001).Â  â€œThis court has consistently refused to apply the plain error rule.â€ Â Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 306, 486 S.E. 2d 750, 759 (1997).Â  â€œAn issue that was not preserved for review should not be addressed by the Court of Appeals.â€ Â State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003).\r\nIn the case sub judice, no objection was raised in magistrateâ€™s court that seizure of the abused animals was improper on statutory or constitutional grounds.Â  During his sentencing, Jackson failed to move to alter or amend the order that contemplated the destruction of the dogs by the Humane Society. No objection was made challenging the Humane Societyâ€™s command over the dogs.Â  Even if the issue were preserved, it would be meritless.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated section 47-1-170 states: â€œThe owner or person having charge or custody of an animal cruelly used who is convicted of any violation of this chapter forfeits ownership, charge, or custody of the animal.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 47-1-170 (Supp. 2005). Â Section 47-1-150(F)(2) provides: â€œThe officer or agent of any county or of the South Carolina Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or of any society incorporated for that purpose, taking charge of an animal as provided for in this section shall provide for the animal until . . . [t]he animal is turned over to the officer or agent as provided in Section 47-1-170 and a humane disposition of the animal is made.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 47-1-150(F)(2) (Supp. 2005).\r\nJackson disputes the Humane Societyâ€™s authority to take custody of and dispose of the animals but fails to cite authority requiring the magistrateâ€™s order to make findings of fact regarding the forfeiture in section 47-1-170.\r\n\r\nII. Â SubstantialÂ  Evidence\r\n\r\nJackson argues that no evidence supports the forfeiture and destruction of his pit bulls. Â The testimony of Tilley and Dr. Hovis, along with the pictures of the dogs, were sufficient for a jury to convict.Â  There is substantial evidence to support his convictions.\r\n\r\nIII. Â Abuse of Discretion\r\n\r\nJackson contends the magistrateâ€™s court abused its discretion.Â  Citing Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 258 S.C 518, 189 S.E.2d 296 (1972), Jackson argues the forfeiture is arbitrary and capricious as a matter of law.Â  Chemical Leaman Tank Lines is inapplicable because it merely states the scope of review of an action by the Public Service Commission is an administrative law action.Â  Id.Â  In addition, Jackson cites State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 543 S.E.2d 286 (Ct. App. 2001), overruled by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â  Jackson did not articulate his purpose for citing Hamilton.\r\nJacksonâ€™s reliance on State v. Preslar, 364 S.C. 466, 613 S.E.2d 381 (Ct. App. 2005), is misplaced.Â  Preslar addressed the admissibility of a pending charge of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in a trial for the charge of intimidation of a witness where the witness was the victim of the criminal sexual conduct.Â  Id.Â  The charge was found admissible under res gestae.Â  Jacksonâ€™s reasoning is wholly without merit or logic.\r\n\r\nIV. Â Constitutional Issue\r\n\r\nJackson asserts the phrase â€œtake whatever steps it deems proper to dispose of the dogsâ€ is unconstitutional, broad, vague, arbitrary and capricious.\r\nA constitutional argument is not preserved for appeal where appellant failed to argue the constitutional basis for his request at trial.Â  State v. Byram, 326 S.C 107, 112-113, 485 S.E.2d 360, 362-63 (1997).Â  Moreover, one to whose conduct the law clearly applies does not have standing to challenge on constitutional vagueness. Â State v. Michau, 355 S.C. 73, 583 S.E.2d 756 (2003).Â  The evidentiary record revealed the dogs were subject to animal cruelty.Â  Likewise, the evidence shows that Jackson was unfit to care for the pit bulls.Â  Even Jackson averred that â€œthem dogs are real aggressive.â€\r\nBecause Jacksonâ€™s arguments on the constitutionality of the statute are conclusory, the issue should be deemed abandoned on appeal.Â  See State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 518 S.E.2d 278 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating conclusory argument in brief constitutes abandonment of issue on appeal).\r\n\r\nV. Â Custody\r\n\r\nJackson argues the dogsâ€™ custody and destruction by the Humane Society contradicts the purpose of the animal cruelty act.Â  This assertion is\r\nmeritless.\r\nOther than stating in his brief that the animals were illegally seized, Jackson made no objection at trial.Â  The purpose of the statute is to prevent acts of cruelty including: malnourishment, lack of proper medical care, lack of shelter, overloading with heavy chains, and allowing the dogs to inflict injuries upon each other.\r\nThe humane destruction of animals unfit for adoption is not animal cruelty as defined by the statute but an appropriate use of police power to protect the public. Â Sentell v. New Orleans &amp; Carrollton RR. Co., 166 U.S. 698 (1897) (finding legislators may permit the destruction of dogs for safety and protection of citizens). Â Section 47-1-170 clarifies that humane disposition is done to prevent further animal cruelty and to protect society from dangerous animals.\r\nConclusion\r\nAccordingly, Jacksonâ€™s convictions and sentences are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-245","title":"Gobbi v.

Gordon, of Charleston, Lynette Rogers Hedgepath and Richard M. Lovelace, Jr., both of Conway; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action arising out of the transfer of a deed and subsequent procurement of a mortgage, Jara Uzenda Gobbi appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order dismissing all of her causes of action.Â  Gobbi argues the court erred in:Â  (1) finding it had jurisdiction to hear the motions in the case; (2) declining to grant her motion to enlarge the time to file a motion to reconsider; (3) failing to give proper notice of the hearing; and (4) finding she had to comply with previously-issued circuit court orders despite the existence of outstanding motions.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 26, 2002, Gobbi commenced this action against Peopleâ€™s Federal Bank, and attorneys Richard M. Lovelace, Jr. and Lynette R. Hedgepath (Respondents).Â  In her complaint, Gobbi contended Lovelace â€œcoerced and trickedâ€ her into converting a Myrtle Beach lot, which was designated as a business asset, to a marital asset. Â She alleged that Lovelace, who proceeded to represent her husband in a divorce action, persuaded her to deed the property so that it would become subject to equitable division in family court.Â  Additionally, Gobbi asserted the law firm of Lovelace and Hedgepath issued defective title insurance on the deed.Â  Finally, Gobbi claimed Peopleâ€™s Federal Bank improperly executed a mortgage on the property.Â  Based on these allegations, Gobbi sought a declaratory judgment and raised the following causes of action concerning Lovelace:Â  (1) fraudulent conveyance; (2) negligent misrepresentation; (3) breach of contract; and (4) breach of trust.Â  As to the law firm of Lovelace and Hedgepath, Gobbi claimed legal malpractice.Â  Gobbi also asserted a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty against Peopleâ€™s Federal Bank.Â  As to all defendants, Gobbi claimed:Â  (1) civil conspiracy; (2) fraud; and (3) intentional infliction of emotional and financial harm. \r\nIn response, Lovelace generally denied the allegations and raised the following affirmative defenses:Â  (1) the three-year statute of limitations; (2) res judicata; and (3) the South Carolina Frivolous Proceedings Act.Â  Lovelace also sought a temporary injunction prohibiting Gobbi from filing any other actions or motions in Horry County until after her current action was resolved.Â  In conjunction, Lovelace filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the three-year statute of limitations, and res judicata.Â  Lovelace also moved pursuant to Rule 12(e), SCRCP for Gobbi to make a more definite statement of her causes of action. \r\nSimilarly, Hedgepath generally denied Gobbiâ€™s allegations and raised the following affirmative defenses:Â  (1) failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP; (2) failure to plead the specific elements of fraud as required by Rule 9(b), SCRCP; (3) the three-year statute of limitations; (4) abuse of process; and (5) the South Carolina Frivolous Proceedings Act.Â Â  Hedgepath also sought a temporary injunction against Gobbi.Â  On the same date that Hedgepath filed her answer and counterclaim, she filed motions to dismiss which were identical in substance to Lovelaceâ€™s motions.\r\nPeopleâ€™s Federal Bank also generally denied Gobbiâ€™s allegations and asserted Gobbiâ€™s complaint should be dismissed for the following reasons:Â  (1) inadequate service of process; (2) failure to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6); (3) collateral estoppel; (4) the three-year statute of limitations; (5) failure to plead the requisite elements of fraud; and (6) failure to plead special damages as required for a cause of action for conspiracy. \r\nWhen conflict arose between the parties regarding discovery issues, the case was set for a hearing on September 18, 2002, before Circuit Court Judge James E. Lockemy.Â  On the day of the hearing, Judge Lockemy issued a form order in which he ordered Gobbi to be available for Lovelace to depose her within thirty days from the date of the order.Â  Judge Lockemy also discussed with the parties about scheduling another hearing to rule on the partiesâ€™ pending motions. \r\nOn February 14, 2003, Judge Lockemy held a hearing on the partiesâ€™ outstanding motions.Â  At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Lockemy orally ruled and issued a form order in which he took under advisement Lovelaceâ€™s motion to dismiss for res judicata.Â  He struck Gobbiâ€™s causes of action for breach of trust, intentional infliction of emotional and financial harm, and financial harm.Â  As to Gobbiâ€™s remaining causes of action, Judge Lockemy ordered Gobbi to:Â  (1) fully answer Peopleâ€™s Federal Bankâ€™s request to produce within fourteen days; (2) obtain within forty-five days an affidavit from an attorney establishing the standard of care for legal malpractice and outlining how Lovelace and Hedgepath deviated from this standard; (3) make more definite and certain her claim for fraud and to state with specificity her damage claims for all causes of actions; and (4) to appear at a scheduled deposition and bring all of her documents supporting her claims against Respondents. Â Â Additionally, Judge Lockemy instructed the parties that Gobbiâ€™s lawsuit would be treated as a cause of action for damages as opposed to declaratory judgment action requested by Gobbi.\r\nBecause Gobbi failed to comply with the mandates of the February 14, 2003 order, Judge Lockemy issued an order on April 14, 2003, in which he struck Gobbiâ€™s causes of action for legal malpractice and fraud.Â  He also granted Gobbi an additional thirty days to definitively state her claims for damages.Â  Finally, Judge Lockemy informed the parties that he would no longer be presiding over the case because he had been called to report for active military duty on April 21, 2003.Â  He requested the pending motions to dismiss be placed on the motions calendar and reassigned to another judge by the Chief Administrative Judge. \r\nOn May 9, 2003, Gobbi filed a motion to enlarge the time to file a motion for reconsideration of Judge Lockemyâ€™s orders dated February 14, 2003, and April 14, 2003.Â  Because Judge Lockemy requested that the case be assigned to another judge, Gobbi moved for the two orders to be stayed until another judge was assigned.\r\nUltimately, the case was assigned to Circuit Court Judge Edward B. Cottingham who held a hearing on January 5, 2004, to resolve the partiesâ€™ outstanding motions.Â  During the hearing, Judge CottinghamÂ  informed the parties that he had been assigned the case as a result of Judge Lockemyâ€™s military service.Â  Specifically, Judge Cottingham found Judge Lockemy was unavailable and, thus, he assumed jurisdiction over the case.Â  After hearing arguments from the parties, Judge Cottingham declined to overrule Judge Lockemyâ€™s orders and found that Gobbi had not complied with these orders. Based on this finding, Judge Cottingham dismissed Gobbiâ€™s remaining causes of action in an order dated January 5, 2004.Â  \r\nOn January 28, 2004, Gobbi filed a motion for reconsideration of Judge Cottinghamâ€™s order. Â In her motion, Gobbi raised several issues including a challenge to Judge Cottinghamâ€™s jurisdiction to hear her motion to reconsider Judge Lockemyâ€™s orders.Â  Gobbi also requested a hearing on her motion.Â  \r\nWithout holding a hearing, Judge Cottingham ruled on Gobbiâ€™s motion.Â  Â Â By order dated April 6, 2004, Judge Cottingham found upon review of the case file that Gobbi had not filed a motion to reconsider Judge Lockemyâ€™s orders.Â  Instead, Judge Cottingham noted that Gobbi had only filed a motion to enlarge the time to file a motion for reconsideration.Â  Based on this procedural error, Judge Cottingham concluded that Gobbi had not timely filed her motion to reconsider and, thus, Judge Lockemyâ€™s orders dated February 14, 2003, and April 14, 2003, were the law of the case.Â  Because Gobbi had failed to comply with the terms of these orders, Judge Cottingham dismissed Gobbiâ€™s remaining causes of action.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  \r\nGobbi argues Judge Cottinghamâ€™s order should be â€œdeemed void or voidable for lack of jurisdiction.â€ Â Specifically, she contends that Judge Lockemy retained jurisdiction over any motions to reconsider his orders and, thus, Judge Cottingham was without jurisdiction to rule on Judge Lockemyâ€™s orders.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 63 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure governs the disposition of this issue.Â  Rule 63 provides:\r\n\r\nIf by reason of death, sickness, or other disability, a judge before whom an action has been tried is unable to perform the duties to be performed by the court under these rules after a verdict is returned or findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed, then the resident judge of the circuit or any other judge having jurisdiction in the court in which the action was tried may perform those duties; but if such other judge is satisfied that he cannot perform those duties because he did not preside at the trial or for any other reason, he may in his discretion grant a new trial.\r\n\r\nRule 63, SCRCP.[2]\r\nInitially, we note that Gobbi appeared to recognize that Judge Lockemy would be unavailable due to his military duty to rule on any motions after he issued the order dated April 14, 2003.Â  Significantly, in her motion to enlarge the time to file a motion for reconsideration, Gobbi requested additional time to file her motion â€œuntil another judge is assigned.Â  At which time, the issues presented to Judge Lockemy should be revisited.â€Â  Based on this statement, we question whether Gobbi waived any right to challenge Judge Cottinghamâ€™s authority to rule on her motion.Â  \r\nIn any event, we find the proper procedure was followed pursuant to Rule 63, SCRCP.Â  By his order dated April 14, 2003, Judge Lockemy informed the parties that he was being deployed for active military duty on April 21, 2003, and requested that the case be assigned to another circuit court judge.Â  Pursuant to this request, the Chief Administrative Judge assigned the case to Judge Cottingham.Â  At the hearing on January 5, 2004, Judge Cottingham again informed the parties that he would hear the outstanding motions because Judge Lockemy was unavailable to preside over the case.Â  Because Judge Lockemy was â€œunable to perform the duties to be performed by the court,â€ we hold Judge Cottingham had authority to hear the partiesâ€™ outstanding motions.Â  See Ness v. Eckerd Corp., 350 S.C. 399, 403, 566 S.E.2d 193, 196 (Ct. App. 2002) (applying Rule 63, SCRCP and finding that another circuit court judge should have heard partyâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion where original circuit court judge denied partyâ€™s motion to set aside an entry of default and then recused himself before ruling on the Rule 59(e) motion).\r\nII.\r\nGobbi argues Judge Cottingham erred in refusing to grant her motion to enlarge the time to file a motion for reconsideration of Judge Lockemyâ€™s orders.Â  She contends the motion was valid and properly presented to Judge Lockemy and the Chief Administrative Judge. Â We disagree.\r\nRule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides, â€œA motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after receipt of written notice of the entry of the order.â€Â  This ten-day time limit may not be extended.Â  See Rule 6(b), SCRCP (â€œThe time for taking any action under Rules 50(b), 52(b), 59, and 60(b) may not be extended except to the extent and under the conditions stated in them.â€); Leviner v. Sonoco Prods. Co., 339 S.C. 492, 494, 530 S.E.2d 127, 128 (2000) (â€œUnder Rule 59(e), SCRCP, the trial judge has only ten days from entry of judgment to alter or amend an earlier order on his own initiative absent a â€˜reservationâ€™ of jurisdiction in the form order.â€); see also Citizens &amp; S. Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina v. Easton, 310 S.C. 458, 460, 427 S.E.2d 640, 641 (1993) (holding â€œtrial court was without authority to order a new trial beyond 10 days after entry of judgment, regardless of the pendency of the Rule 50(b) motionâ€).Â Â  \r\nIn the instant case, Judge Lockemy issued orders dated February 14, 2003, and April 14, 2003.Â  Gobbi did not file a motion for reconsideration within the ten-day limit.Â  Instead, she waited until May 9, 2003, to file a motion to enlarge the time to file the motion for reconsideration.Â  As evidenced by the above-outlined rules of procedure and case law interpreting the rules, Judge Cottingham lacked jurisdiction to enlarge the time for Gobbi to file a motion for reconsideration.Â  Therefore, we find Judge Cottingham properly denied Gobbiâ€™s motion and affirmed Judge Lockemyâ€™s orders.\r\nTo the extent that Gobbi argues the ten-day time limit was tolled because Judge Lockemyâ€™s orders were, in her assessment, interlocutory, we find this argument is not preserved for our review.Â  A review of Gobbiâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion challenging Judge Cottinghamâ€™s order reveals that Gobbi did not raise this argument.Â  Thus, she is raising it for the first time on appeal.Â  Accordingly, we decline to address this argument.Â  See \r\nLucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (recognizing that in order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, with few exceptions, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court); see also Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 502, 597 S.E.2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting an issue is not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant does not make a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment).\r\nIII.\r\nFinally, Gobbi asserts Judge Cottinghamâ€™s order should be â€œdeemed a nullityâ€ because she was not given proper notice of what would be considered at the hearing.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe find Gobbiâ€™s assertion to be without merit.Â  Gobbi filed her motion entitled â€œMotion to Enlarge Time Pursuant to Rule 6(b), to move for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e), on the Basis of Rule 43(I), for a Stay Pursuant to Rule 62(b), and for Service of the Order Recusing Judge Breeden in this Matter Pursuant to Rule 5(b)â€ on May 9, 2003.Â  Judge Cottingham held the hearing on January 5, 2004, which would appear to be sufficient time for Gobbi to prepare to argue her motion.Â  At the hearing, Judge Cottingham inquired whether Gobbi had received a copy of the roster listing the pending motions to be considered at the hearing.Â  Although Gobbi acknowledged receiving the roster, she questioned whether her motion to reconsider was in fact listed as a pending motion. Â Based on our review of the record, we find Gobbi was apprised of what she would be asked to argue at the January 2004 hearing before Judge Cottingham.Â  Therefore, we find Judge Cottingham properly considered Gobbiâ€™s motion at the hearing.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Judge Lockemy was unable to continue to preside over the case after he issued the order dated April 14, 2003, we find Judge Cottingham had jurisdiction to rule on the partiesâ€™ outstanding motions.Â  Furthermore, we hold Judge Cottingham properly declined to grant Gobbiâ€™s motion to enlarge the time to file a motion for reconsideration.Â  Given there was no timely motion for reconsideration filed, we find Judge Cottingham correctly upheld Judge Lockemyâ€™s orders and concluded Gobbi failed to comply with the mandates of these orders.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â Â  We note that Rule 63 was amended by order dated April 28, 2004.Â  The amended version of the rule provides:\r\n\r\nIf at any time after a trial or hearing has been commenced, but before the final order or judgment has been issued, the judge is unable to proceed, a successor judge shall be assigned. The successor judge may proceed upon certifying familiarity with the record and determining that the proceedings may be completed without prejudice to the parties. In a hearing or a trial without a jury, the successor judge shall, at the request of a party, recall any witness whose testimony is material and disputed and who is available to testify without undue burden. A successor judge may also provide for the recall of any witnesses.\r\n\r\nRule 63, SCRCP.Â  Because the amendment took effect after Judge Cottingham was assigned to the case in January 2004, we cite to the earlier version of the rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-246","title":"Gobbi v.

Myrtle Beach, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jara Uzenda Gobbi appeals the trial judgeâ€™s dismissal of her legal malpractice action against attorneys Marjorie Simerman and Patrick Wayne Mumford.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn early 2000, Gobbi retained the services of Simerman for a family court matter.Â  Simerman referred Gobbi to Mumford for representation regarding Gobbiâ€™s allegations of fraudulent conveyance of some of her real estate holdings.Â  On June 17, 2002, Gobbi initiated a malpractice action against both attorneys by filing a summons and complaint alleging breach of contract, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, conversion, and intentional infliction of emotional and financial harm.Â  Although Gobbi correctly identified Mumford in the caption of the summons, Gobbi transposed Mumfordâ€™s first and middle name in the caption of the complaint, listing him as â€œWayne Patrick Mumford,â€ instead of â€œPatrick Wayne Mumford.â€Â  On June 21, 2002, Gobbi filed an amended complaint that correctly identified Mumford as â€œPatrick Wayne Mumford.â€Â  A sheriffâ€™s deputy personally served Mumford on September 16, 2002, and personally served Simerman on September 27, 2002.Â  Both Mumford and Simerman filed answers, generally denying that they were liable to Gobbi for any professional action or inaction on their parts.Â  Mumford additionally asserted affirmative defenses including waiver, estoppel, laches, unconstitutionality of punitive damages, and failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.Â  In her answer, Simerman also requested: the dismissal of the complaint for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; judgment on the pleadings; and sanctions and costs from\r\nGobbi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nBoth attorneys filed motions to dismiss the action.Â  Simermanâ€™s motion urged dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, for failure to state a cause of action, and for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c), SCRCP.Â  Mumford moved to dismiss the action pursuant to the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) (lack of jurisdiction over the person); 12(b)(4) (insufficiency of process); 12(b)(5) (insufficiency of service of process); 12(b)(6) (failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action); and 12(b)(8) (another action is pending between the same parties).Â  Mumford alleged in his affidavit that he was never served with the original summons and complaint and he had only been served with the amended complaint by mail.Â Â  \r\nA hearing was held on both attorneysâ€™ motions to dismiss.Â  A different attorney in the same office as Mumfordâ€™s attorney appeared on Mumfordâ€™s behalf.Â  Mumfordâ€™s attorney moved to dismiss based upon the insufficiency of the process.Â  The trial judge orally granted the motion to dismiss the action against Mumford without prejudice, ruling that it was improper for Gobbi to have served the amended complaint without having served the original complaint.Â  When Gobbi claimed that she served the original complaint by certified mail, the judge noted that was not sufficient.Â  Simerman, representing herself, argued the action should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.Â  After being informed by Mumfordâ€™s attorney that Simerman was served the same way, the judge dismissed the action against her without prejudice, noting that service by mail was insufficient.Â  The judge issued a form order dismissing the action without prejudice against both attorneys for â€œimproper service.â€Â  Gobbi moved for reconsideration, arguing:Â  the service of the amended complaint was proper; the judge should rule on an outstanding motion to file in forma pauperis; and the judge should comment on a report of felonies.Â  The motion was denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  DismissalÂ  (Appellantâ€™s Issues 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9)\r\nGobbi argues the trial judge erred in dismissing her complaint against both attorneys without prejudice.Â  She asserts the judgeâ€™s decision was erroneous because it amounted to ordering what had already been done.[2]Â  \r\nUnder Rule 4(d)(1), SCRCP, personal service may be made upon an individual â€œby delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to him personally or by leaving copies thereof at his dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein.â€Â  Service may also be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, and delivery restricted to the addressee.Â  Rule 4(d)(8), SCRCP.Â  There is a presumption of proper service when the rules of civil procedure are followed.Â  Roberson v. S. Fin. of South Carolina, 365 S.C. 6, 10, 615 S.E.2d 112, 114-15 (2005).Â  However, it is still the plaintiffâ€™s burden to show that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants.Â  Fassett v. Evans, 364 S.C. 42, 47, 610 S.E.2d 841, 843 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nThere is ample evidence in the record to support the trial judgeâ€™s decision to dismiss the action without prejudice.Â  Despite Gobbiâ€™s assertions that she served Simerman and Mumford via certified mail with the original summons and complaint, there was no proof of that service in the record.Â  As the trial judge noted, service by certified mail alone, without restricting delivery or attaching a return receipt, is not sufficient to satisfy Rule 4(d)(8), SCRCP.Â  The rules also require service of the summons and complaint.Â  Therefore, the service by the sheriffâ€™s deputy of the amended complaint, without a summons attached, was insufficient for personal service under Rule 4(d)(1), SCRCP.Â  Although Gobbi argues the service of the amended complaint amounted to proper service, she failed to comply with the service requirements of Rules 4(d)(1) or 4(d)(8), SCRCP, and dismissal of the action without prejudice was proper.Â  \r\nII.Â  Propriety of Dismissal as to SimermanÂ  (Appellantâ€™s Issues 4 and 5)\r\nGobbi argues it was improper for the trial judge to dismiss the action against attorney Simerman because only the attorney representing Mumford raised and argued the service issue.Â  Further, Gobbi complains that the attorney speaking on behalf of Mumford at the hearing was not the attorney of record and should not have been allowed to speak.Â Â  \r\nArrigo P. Carotti was Mumfordâ€™s attorney of record.Â  John B. McCutcheon, an attorney in Carottiâ€™s firm, appeared on Mumfordâ€™s behalf in place of Carotti.Â  Although Simerman argued the action should be dismissed against her because the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to support any cause of action, the judge eventually dismissed the action against her after Mumfordâ€™s attorney informed the judge that both attorneys were not sufficiently served with process.Â  Gobbi did not object to Carottiâ€™s appearance or to the judgeâ€™s decision to dismiss the action against Simerman based upon a ground she did not argue.Â  Because these issues were not argued before the trial judge, they are not preserved for appellate review.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).[3]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial judgeâ€™s decision to dismiss Gobbiâ€™s complaints against Simerman and Mumford without prejudice is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Gobbi also argues the trial judge erred in dismissing the complaint because: (1) she was denied the opportunity to present evidence at the hearing; (2) she was denied the opportunity to be heard; (3) Simerman and Mumford were barred from moving to dismiss the action based on the insufficiency of service of process after they failed to raise the affirmative defense in their answers and they personally appeared; (4) the order failed to specify the basis for the dismissal, depriving Gobbi of â€œremedial relief;â€ and (5) she was prejudiced by the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  These arguments were not raised before the trial judge or in her motion for reconsideration.Â  Because these issues were not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge, they are not preserved for appellate review and we decline to address them.Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge are not preserved for appellate review). \r\n[3]Â  Gobbi also argues that Judge Cottingham erred by not commenting on a document she filed entitled â€œReport to Judge Cottingham Pursuant to USCA Title 18 Sec. 3 and 4 Misprision of Felony and Accessory After the Fact.â€Â  In this document, Gobbi alleged that Mumford and Simerman violated federal law because they had knowledge of the felonies Scott Gobbi was committing and both failed to take action.Â  Gobbi claimed that she was reporting the negligence of both attorneys to the trial judge for him to report to the proper authorities pursuant to federal law.Â  Because we affirm Judge Cottinghamâ€™s dismissal of this action, we need not address the failure to comment on this report.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-247","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Christina Theos Adams, of Anderson, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Samuel J. Hastings appeals from his convictions on two counts of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  Hastings challenges: (1) the admission of two bloodstained shirts, owned by one of the victims, which were not provided to him for inspection prior to trial; (2) admission of color photographs of a victimâ€™s injuries; and (3) comments by the trial judge during sentencing, which Hastings maintains indicate improper consideration of his exercise of the rights to a jury trial and to testify in his own defense.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn the night of August 31, 2003, a group of regulars were dancing at a bar known as Cadillac Ranch in Oconee County.Â  Hastings and his wife were at the bar, drinking and dancing.Â  One of the women testified that while she was dancing with friends, Hastings bumped into her repeatedly.Â  The woman noticed that Hastings appeared intoxicated, and his wife was attempting to pull him away.Â  The woman tapped Hastings on the shoulder and asked him to stop bumping her.Â  In response, Hastings grabbed the woman on the rear end with both hands, in full view of all of her friends.Â  \r\nThe woman told Hastings not to do it again and moved to another section of the dance floor.Â  Hastings then began bumping into another woman.Â  Hastingsâ€™ wife left the dance floor in frustration.Â  By then several bouncers had taken note of the situation, and Hastings was instructed to calm down and leave the dance floor.Â  Hastings began cursing and, in the ensuing confusion, he hit a woman in the face with his fist.Â  \r\nThe bouncers immediately sought to contain Hastings by forcing him to the floor and holding his arms and legs.Â  Hastings drew a knife and lunged at them several times.Â  As a result, one bouncer was cut several times on his stomach, and another received severe injuries to his leg which required emergency medical treatment and resulted in permanent scarring.Â  \r\nA jury convicted Hastings on two counts of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  The trial judge sentenced him to ten years suspended on service of four years and five yearsâ€™ probation on both counts, to run concurrently.Â  This appeal follows. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS1.\r\nAdmission of the Bloody Shirts\r\n      Hastings first argues that the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence two shirts one of the victims was wearing on the night the incident occurred.Â  The shirts were in the possession of the victim until the day of trial.Â  Hastings contends this evidence should have been suppressed because he was not allowed to inspect the shirts pursuant to Rule 5(a)(1)(C), SCRCrimP.Â  We find no reversible error.Â \r\n        Rule 5(a)(1)(C) of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure provides as follows: \r\n\r\n        Upon request of the defendant the prosecution shall permit the defendant to inspect . . . tangible objects . . . which are within the possession, custody or control of the prosecution, and which are material to the preparation of his defense or are intended for use by the prosecution as evidence in chief at the trial . . . .\r\n\r\n        The trial judge may, among other things, suppress evidence at trial that has been withheld in violation of Rule 5.Â  Rule 5(d)(2), SCRCrimP.Â  The decision to admit evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and may only be reversed on a finding of abuse of discretion.Â \r\n        State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App 2003).Â  Furthermore, any such abuse of discretion must result in prejudice to the defendant.Â \r\n        State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n        At trial, the State sought to introduce an undershirt and outer shirt worn by one of the bouncers.Â  The shirts were cut and stained with blood.Â  Hastings, in discovery, had been provided with photographs of the shirts.Â  Counsel for Hastings objected on the ground that no blood could be seen on the shirts in photographs that had been provided in response to his Rule 5 request.Â  It is uncontested that the shirts were in the possession of the witness until the day of trial, but Hastings argued the items of clothing were under the â€œcontrolâ€ of the prosecution within the meaning of Rule 5(a)(1)(C), and therefore, the shirts should have been provided.Â  The trial judge denied Hastingsâ€™ motion to suppress based on his awareness of the existence of the shirts prior to trial.Â  \r\n        Hastings argues on appeal that this ruling deprived him of the opportunity to do a blood test on the shirts.Â  In response, the State argues that evidence in the possession of a witness is not discoverable under Rule 5.Â  See State v. Gulledge, 326 S.C. 220, 226-27, 487 S.E.2d 590, 593 (1997) (finding no discovery violation where the evidence was in the possession of a third party corporation and thus not â€œwithin the possession, custody or control of the prosecutionâ€).Â  This rule, however, should not be used as a vehicle for avoiding discovery by the prosecution.Â  In Gulledge, the records were voluminous and some confusion occurred as to who was to copy the records.Â  Id. at 225-26, 487 S.E.2d at 592-93.Â  \r\n        This case is quite different, as the shirts could easily have been provided.Â  The State certainly had access to the shirts, as evidenced by the photographs it furnished to counsel for Hastings.Â  We find the shirts were within the â€œcontrolâ€ of the State.\r\n        The State further argues that its â€œopen fileâ€ policy satisfied the inspection requirement.Â  See State v. Newell, 303 S.C. 471, 475-76, 401 S.E.2d 420, 423 (Ct. App. 1991). Â Because all agree the shirts were not in the prosecutionâ€™s possession, however, a search of the file would not have discovered the shirts.Â  \r\n        The better practice would have been for the State to turn over the evidence.Â  We find no reversible error because Hastings cannot show prejudice as a result of admission of the shirts.Â  This evidence was merely cumulative of other evidence, such as the pictures of the bouncerâ€™s stomach and the testimony of the bouncer, his wife, and other witnesses.Â  Moreover, because Hastings had photographs of the shirts, he must bear some responsibility in failing to request an opportunity to inspect the shirts.Â  In any event, any error was surely harmless due to the weight of the evidence adduced at trial.Â  State v. Reeves,&nbsp;301 S.C. 191, 194, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243&nbsp;(1990) (â€œError is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€).Â  \r\n        2. Color Photograph of the Victimâ€™s injuries\r\n        Hastings next argues that color photographs of the injuries to the other bouncerâ€™s legs should have been suppressed under Rule 403, SCRE, because they were more prejudicial than the black and white photographs.Â  We disagree. \r\n        â€œIt is well settled that evidence should be excluded when its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.â€Â  State v. Kelley,&nbsp;319 S.C. 173, 177, 460 S.E.2d 368, 370&nbsp;(1995).Â  â€œThe determination of the relevancy and materiality of a photograph is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.â€Â  Id.Â  Moreover, a trial judgeâ€™s considerable latitude in so ruling will not be disturbed absent a showing of probable prejudice.Â  State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 288, 350 S.E.2d 180, 185 (1986).Â  â€œTo constitute unfair prejudice, the photographs must create a tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.â€Â  State v. Rosemond,&nbsp;335 S.C. 593, 597, 518 S.E.2d 588, 590&nbsp;(1999).Â  \r\n        In the instant case the photographs had some probative value as to the juryâ€™s consideration of the greater offense of assault and battery with intent to kill and the lesser included offense of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  Tate v. State,&nbsp;351 S.C. 418, 427, 570 S.E.2d 522, 527&nbsp;(2002) (holding that ABHAN is the unlawful act of violent injury to another accompanied by circumstances of aggravation, such as use of a deadly weapon).Â  The trial found that the color photographs depicted the wounds better than the black and white ones did.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in admitting the photographs.Â  See, e.g., State v. Fletcher,&nbsp;363 S.C. 221, 257-259, 609 S.E.2d 572, 591-92&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (finding no abuse of discretion in the admission of graphic post-mortem photographs because they were necessary to depict the severity of the injuries and the discoloration of the bruises); State v. Jarrell,&nbsp;350 S.C. 90, 106-107, 564 S.E.2d 362, 371&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002) (upholding the admission of graphic autopsy photographs because they corroborated testimony and demonstrated the extent of the injuries).Â  \r\n        3. Trial Judgeâ€™s Comments during Sentencing \r\n        Hastings submits two final arguments, both of which derive from the trial judgeâ€™s comments during sentencing.Â  Hastings did not lodge any contemporaneous objections.Â  Accordingly, these issues are not preserved for review.Â  State v. Garner,&nbsp;304 S.C. 220, 222, 403 S.E.2d 631, 632&nbsp;(1991) (holding that sentencing issues must be raised at trial to be preserved for appeal).Â  \r\n        CONCLUSION\r\n        We find that the admission of the victimâ€™s shirts did not constitute reversible error as no prejudicial harm to defendant resulted.Â  We further find no abuse of discretion in the admission of the color photographs of the victimâ€™s injuries.Â  Hastingsâ€™ arguments as to sentencing are not preserved for review.Â  Therefore, the convictions are \r\n        AFFIRMED.\r\n        KITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.

Lindemann, of Columbia, for Appellants.Â  \r\nDennis N. Cannon, Jr., of Camden, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The South Carolina Department of Highways and Public Transportation appeals the trial courtâ€™s order enforcing a settlement agreement.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nBen Rabon and his wife, Cynthia, brought a claim against the department for injuries Ben sustained in an automobile accident involving an employee of the department.Â  The department was insured by the South Carolina Insurance Reserve Fund.Â  American Southern Insurance Company was the Insurance Reserve Fundâ€™s servicing reinsurer (hereinafter collectively referred to as the department).Â  \r\nOn August 17, 1994, the Rabons and Carroll Barwick, a claims adjuster engaged by the department, attended a settlement conference.Â  At the conference, the parties agreed to settle the Rabonsâ€™ claim for a lump sum of $25,000 and an annuity of $650 per month for fifteen years.Â  The Rabons signed a handwritten document containing these terms.Â  The document was not signed by Barwick or any representative from the insurance company.Â  Galaher Settlements Company, a structured settlement company engaged by American Southern to administer the settlement, confirmed the above settlement terms with American Southern by letter dated August 18, 1994.Â  \r\nFollowing the conference, the Rabons had misgivings about the agreement.Â  Ben testified that, â€œwithin the next day or two,â€ Cynthia called Barwick to explain their dissatisfaction.Â  Cynthia testified she called Barwick â€œjust a couple of days afterâ€ the conference.Â  Cynthia allegedly asked Barwick whether the insurance company could either provide more money up front or extend the annuity payments.Â  Cynthia testified Barwick said he would speak with the other parties about the Rabonsâ€™ concerns.Â  Barwick testified he did not â€œspecifically recallâ€ speaking with the Rabons about changing the agreement.Â  \r\nThe Rabons received a $25,000 check issued August 19, 1994 as the lump sum portion of the settlement.Â  They marked out the language on the check indicating â€œfinal settlementâ€ and negotiated the check.Â  The Rabons and William Lynch, a representative of American Southern, initialed the modification.Â  \r\nOn September 13, 1994, the Rabons received a proposed settlement agreement via facsimile from Barwick.Â  The proposed agreement provided for the $25,000 lump sum payment and monthly payments of $650 for twenty years.Â  On September 15, 1994, the Rabons met at Barwickâ€™s office to sign the agreement.Â  Ben testified they went over the entire agreement together â€œword for word.â€Â  Cynthia testified they reviewed the agreement thoroughly and she was â€œsureâ€ that the change from fifteen to twenty years was discussed, although she could not â€œsay specifically that that happened.â€Â  The Rabons and Barwick signed the agreement.Â  \r\nBy letter dated September 20, 1994, Barwick transmitted the agreement to Galaher Settlements and copied Lynch.Â  On December 24, 1994, Galaher notified Barwick that the contract â€œmistakenlyâ€ provided for periodic payments for twenty years rather than fifteen years.Â  The Rabons were not notified of the alleged mistake.Â  \r\nOn September 8, 1997, Galaher sent a letter to American Southern indicating the periodic payments were incorrectly stated on the agreement and the annuity contract would not be issued until the appropriate corrections were made.[1]Â  The letter contained lines for Barwick, Ben Rabon, and American Southern to sign to confirm the mistake.Â  Ben did not sign the September 8, 1997 letter.Â  \r\nBy letter dated February 18, 1998, Galaher advised Ben that the annuity would not be issued until he signed a letter agreeing that the annuity term should have been $650 per month for fifteen years.Â  Ben did not sign this letter.Â  \r\nIn January of 1999, Galaher notified American Southern that after several failed attempts to secure Benâ€™s signature, the policy would be issued with the existing documentation.Â  A copy of the annuity contract, the agreement, a surety bond, and a Uniform Qualified Assignment were enclosed.Â  A copy of the letter was sent to Ben.Â  \r\nOn March 16, 1999, the Rabons informed American Southern of their disagreement with the contents of the January 1999 letter and that they were standing by the terms of the September 15, 1994 agreement.Â  The Rabons received no response.Â  \r\nSometime in 2001, Ben sought to have his monthly annuity payments deposited directly into his checking account.Â  At that time, Ben obtained a copy of the annuity contract.Â  The contract authorized only fifteen years of monthly payments.Â  \r\nIn August of 2002, the Rabons commenced this action seeking specific performance of the September 15, 1994 agreement.Â  The department counterclaimed for reformation as a result of a mutual mistake.Â  The trial court found no mutual mistake and rejected the departmentâ€™s equitable defenses.Â  The court ordered the department to specifically perform the terms of the agreement.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for specific performance is an equitable action.Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Associates, 340 S.C. 98, 105, 531 S.E.2d 287, 290 (2000).Â  An action to reform or set aside a written instrument based upon mutual mistake is also an action in equity.Â  Gecy v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 273 S.C. 437, 441, 257 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1979).\r\nIn an action in equity, tried by the judge alone, this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance of the evidence.Â \r\nSettlemeyer v. McCluney, 359 S.C. 317, 320, 596 S.E.2d 514, 516 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require an appellate court to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact that the trial judge is in the better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â \r\nPinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.Â  Mutual Mistake\r\n    The department contends the trial court erred in ordering specific performance of the terms of the September 15, 1994 agreement because the agreement was a result of a mutual mistake.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n    â€œ[A] contract may be avoided or reformed on the ground of mutual mistake of fact where the mistake is common to both parties and, by reason of it, each has done what neither intended.â€Â \r\n    Chet Adams Co. v. James F. Pedersen Co., 308 S.C. 410, 413, 418 S.E.2d 337, 339 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  However, â€œ[b]efore equity will reform an instrument, it must be shown by evidence which is most clear and convincing not simply that it was a mistake on the part of one of the parties but that it was a mutual mistake.â€Â  Sims v. Tyler, 276 S.C. 640, 642, 281 S.E.2d 229, 230 (1981).Â  \r\n    In our view the evidence does not demonstrate a mutual mistake.Â  There is no clear and convincing evidence the Rabons mistakenly agreed to the terms of the September 15, 1994 agreement.Â  First, the rudimentary handwritten note resulting from the August 17, 1994 settlement conference indicates the parties anticipated a more refined document would follow.Â  Also, the record indicates the Rabons believed the August 17, 1994 proposal was not final.Â  This understanding is evidenced by their testimony and further supported by the Rabons eliminating language on the $25,000 check that indicated the lump sum payment was a final settlement.Â  Finally, the Rabons testified they knew the September 15, 1994 agreement provided them with twenty years of monthly annuity payments and agreed to the settlement based on these terms.Â  Thus, the record does not support a finding of a mistake on the Rabonsâ€™ part even if there was a unilateral mistake on the part of the department.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in finding no mutual mistake.Â  \r\nII.Â  Laches\r\n    The department and the Rabons each raised the equitable defense of laches.Â  The department argues the trial court erred in finding laches barred the departmentâ€™s reformation counterclaim but did not bar the Rabonsâ€™ claim for specific performance.Â  We disagree. \r\n    Whether a claim is barred by laches is to be determined in light of the facts of each case.Â  Arceneaux v. Arrington, 284 S.C. 500, 503, 327 S.E.2d 357, 358 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  To prove laches, a party must establish:Â  (1) delay, (2) unreasonable delay, and (3) prejudice.Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 199, 371 S.E.2d 525, 528 (1988).Â  â€œThe court is vested with wide discretion in determining what is an unreasonable delay.â€Â \r\n    Chambers of South Carolina, Inc. v. County Council for Lee County, 315 S.C. 418, 421, 434 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1993).Â  \r\n    We agree with the trial court that the Rabonsâ€™ claim for specific performance is not barred by laches because the Rabonsâ€™ failure to bring this action until August of 2002 does not constitute an unreasonable delay.Â  The record demonstrates the Rabons believed the September 15, 1994 agreement established the terms of the settlement and, thus, the Rabons had no reason to sue for specific performance.Â  The Rabons continued to receive monthly annuity payments pursuant to the agreement and were under no obligation to preempt the issue.Â  In fact, the Rabons may have been justified in delaying any cause of action until the department breached the agreement by ceasing payments after fifteen years.Â  We agree with the trial courtâ€™s finding that laches does not bar the Rabonsâ€™ claim for specific performance.Â  \r\n    III.Â  Other issues\r\n    Based on our finding of no mutual mistake, we decline to reach the remaining issues:Â  1) the Rabonsâ€™ defense of laches; 2) the departmentâ€™s claim for reformation barred by equitable estoppel; and 3) the trial courtâ€™s alleged error in finding the department precluded from reformation based on Barwickâ€™s failure to read the agreement.\r\n    Based on the above, we find the trial court did not err in ordering the department to specifically perform the terms of the September 15, 1994 agreement.Â  The decision of the trial court is accordingly \r\n    AFFIRMED.\r\n    GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The record indicates, however, that SAFECO Life Insurance Company issued an annuity on August 23, 1994.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-252","title":"Lyons v.

Lyons, of Columbia, for Appellant.Â  \r\nDouglas Kosta Kotti, of Columbia, and John M. Hunter, Jr., of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this domestic action, Gale Lyons (Wife) appeals the order of the family court denying her request for alimony and health insurance.Â  Wife also contends the family court failed to properly value the marital property.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nWife and Richard Lyons (Husband) married in August of 1997 and separated on March 5, 2001.Â  During the marriage, Husband worked as a corrections officer, first with the South Carolina Department of Corrections and then, beginning in August of 1998, with the Federal Bureau of Prisons.Â  Initially, Wife worked as an administrative assistant and later as a claims adjustor for Sedgwick Insurance.Â  Due to various health problems, Wife left her employment at Sedgwick in 2001.Â  Wife has applied for disability benefits but has not yet been approved.Â  \r\nOn March 6, 2003, Husband filed for divorce in Aiken County on the ground of one year separation.Â  Wife answered and counterclaimed for divorce on the ground of adultery and requested the case be transferred to Richland County.Â  Wife then amended her pleadings, seeking alimony and health insurance coverage.Â  \r\nThe Aiken County Family Court transferred the case to Richland County.Â  The family court granted the divorce based upon Husbandâ€™s post-separation adultery.Â  The family court found that Husband and Wife enjoyed a modest standard of living during the marriage.Â  Moreover, due in part to the short duration of the marriage[2] and Wifeâ€™s ability to provide for herself, the family court found Wife was not entitled to alimony or health insurance coverage provided by Husband.Â  Both parties agreed to equally apportion the only marital property, Husbandâ€™s thrift savings plan valued at $13,528.85, and agreed to pay their own costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C 207, 213, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings, and we remain mindful of the fact the family court, which saw and heard the parties, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Pendergast v. Pendergast, 354 S.C. 32, 36, 579 S.E.2d 530, 532 (Ct. App. 2003). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife contends the family court erred in denying her request for alimony and health insurance.Â  Wife argues the family court failed to give proper consideration to the partiesâ€™ relative financial status and the lifestyle Wife became accustomed to during the marriage.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAlimony is a substitute for the support that is normally incident to the marital relationship, and its purpose is to place the supported spouse close to the position of support enjoyed during the marriage.Â  See Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The decision to grant or deny alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Williams&nbsp;v. Williams, 297 S.C. 208, 210, 375 S.E.2d 349, 350 (Ct. App. 1988) (citing McKnight v. McKnight, 283 S.C. 540, 324 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1984)).Â  Section 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2005) of the South Carolina Code lists the factors the family court should consider in deciding whether to award alimony: \r\n\r\n(1) the duration of the marriage and the ages of the parties at the time of the marriage and at separation; (2) the physical and emotional condition of each spouse; (3) the educational background of each spouse and the need for additional education; (4) the employment history and earning potential of each spouse; (5) the standard of living established during the marriage; (6) the current and reasonably anticipated income of each spouse; (7) the current and reasonably anticipated expenses of each spouse; (8) the marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) the custody of any children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) the tax consequences of the award; (12) the existence of support obligations to a former spouse; and (13) such other factors the court considers relevant.\r\n\r\nHowever, no single factor should be considered dispositive of the issue of alimony.Â  Lide v. Lide, 277 S.C. 155, 157, 283 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1981).Â  \r\nIn denying Wife alimony and health insurance, the family court noted the partiesâ€™ marriage was one of short duration.Â  In the divorce decree, the family court stated the standard of living established during the marriage was not extravagant.Â  The court elaborated â€œ[t]he parties never owned a home during the marriage and lived in a series of apartments, possibly as many as four . . . .Â  The parties did not take extravagant trips and did not have a lavish life style.â€Â  The only asset of the marriage was Husbandâ€™s thrift savings plan, valued at $13,528.85, which the parties agreed to divide.Â  The family court also observed Husband drove a 1986 Volkswagen and Wife drove a 2002 vehicle, which she purchased after the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  \r\nThe family court found Husband was in good health, and that although Wife did have some health problems, her primary problem was with her hip, which she injured before the marriage.Â  In denying Wife alimony and health insurance, the family court stated Wife did not present sufficient evidence of her disability.Â  See Williamson v. Williamson, 311 S.C. 47, 49-50, 426 S.E.2d 758, 760 (1993) (finding that other than her own testimony, Wife did not present any evidence which would have established the extent of her disability and denying alimony). \r\nFurther, the family court stated Wife worked during the marriage and had the ability to provide for her own needs.Â  Additionally, Husband and Wife also had the same educational background, a high school degree and approximately two years of college.Â  Finally, the family court indicated that although it granted Wife a divorce based upon Husbandâ€™s adultery after the partiesâ€™ separation, Husbandâ€™s adultery did not contribute to or affect the partiesâ€™ decision to separate.Â  Therefore, the family court found Husbandâ€™s conduct was not a significant factor weighing in favor of granting Wife alimony.Â  \r\nThe record supports the family courtâ€™s decision.Â  The family court considered all of the pertinent statutory factors in deciding whether to award alimony and health insurance in this case.Â  Again, we reiterate the decision to grant or deny alimony, including an award of health insurance, remains within the sound discretion of the family court.Â  See Williams, 297 S.C. at 210, 375 S.E.2d at 350.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s decision to deny Wife alimony or health insurance.Â  \r\nNext, Wife maintains the family court erred in its valuation of Husbandâ€™s thrift savings plan.Â  Wife contends her attorney coerced her into accepting the valuation of $13,528.85, but the correct valuation is $15,250.43.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note Wife did not raise this issue below and therefore it is questionably preserved for appeal.Â  See Holy Loch Distrib., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000) (â€œIn order to preserved an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).Â  In any event, when questioned by the court concerning the partiesâ€™ agreement, Wife testified that the terms were fair and the valuation of the plan was accurate.Â  The family court approved the agreement, and it is binding on the parties.Â  See Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 353, 306 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1983) (â€œWith the courtâ€™s approval, the terms [of the agreement] become part of the decree and are binding on the parties and the court.â€).Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in approving a valuation freely and voluntarily agreed upon by both parties. \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp;&nbsp; The family court found the parties separated for several months in 1999 then reconciled and separated permanently in 2001.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-253","title":"State v.

Bailey, of Florence, for Appellant. \r\nDavid A. Aldridge, of Vidalia, Kathy Price Elmore and Kimberly C. Thomas, both of Florence, for Respondents. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This is a family court action by George Larry Thomas (Stepfather) against Kimberly Thomas (Mother), David Alan Aldridge (Father) and Baby Boy David (Child) seeking to terminate the parental rights of Father, and to allow Stepfather to adopt Child and change his name.Â  Termination is sought under section 20-7-1572(3) and (4) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) for alleged willful failure to visit and pay child support.Â  Stepfather appeals from the denial of his request.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Stepfather argues that the family court erred in its findings regarding the timing of Fatherâ€™s visits.Â  We agree that the family court erred in finding that Father visited the child in June of 2003.Â  This error does not affect the result, however, because it neither proves that Fatherâ€™s failure to visit was willful nor demonstrates that termination would be in the best interest of Child.Â  \r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Stepfather next challenges the family courtâ€™s finding that Father did not willfully fail to visit Child within the meaning of section 20-7-1572(3).Â  We affirm the family courtâ€™s finding pursuant to the following authorities:Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden,&nbsp;354 S.C. 602, 608, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423&nbsp;(2003) (holding that the statutory grounds for termination must be proved by clear and convincing evidence); Id. at 610, 582 S.E.2d at 423 (holding that failure to visit must be wilful, which is defined as a â€œconscious indifference to the rights of the childâ€); Hopkins v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs.,&nbsp;313 S.C. 322, 326, 437 S.E.2d 542, 544&nbsp;(1993), overruled on other grounds by Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas,&nbsp;342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375&nbsp;(2000) (holding that failure to visit is not grounds for termination where the parent was prevented from seeing the child); accord Wilson v. Higgins,&nbsp;294 S.C. 300, 304, 363 S.E.2d 911, 914&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987), overruled on other grounds by Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas,&nbsp;342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375&nbsp;(2000) (â€œA finding of a wilful failure to visit will not be predicated upon parental conduct that can be reasonably explained.â€).Â  \r\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Stepfather further asserts that Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated because he failed to pay child support.Â  Clear and convincing evidence does not support termination on this ground either, based on the following authorities: Boyer v. Boyer,&nbsp;291 S.C. 183, 186, 352 S.E.2d 514, 516&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987) (â€œBefore parental rights may be severed, the willful failure to support a child after being requested to do so by the childâ€™s custodian must be established by clear and convincing evidence.â€).Â  Hardy v. Gunter,&nbsp;353 S.C. 128, 134, 577 S.E.2d 231, 234&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003) (â€œA finding of willful failure to support will not be predicated upon parental conduct that can be reasonably explained.â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) (providing that the family court may consider all relevant circumstances, including requests for support and ability of the parent to provide support); Hardy,&nbsp;353 S.C. at 134-35, 577 S.E.2d at 235 (considering extenuating circumstances in ruling on failure to pay).Â  We find the following cases inapposite to the given situation: S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker,&nbsp;336 S.C. 248, 256-58, 519 S.E.2d 351, 355-56&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999) (wherein the parent failed to visit or support the child over a period of years and the appellate court was reviewing the trial courtâ€™s discretionary finding that termination was warranted); Jamison v. Jamison,&nbsp;285 S.C. 603, 607, 330 S.E.2d 671, 673&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985) (same); Abercrombie v. LaBoon,&nbsp;290 S.C. 35, 37-38, 348 S.E.2d 170, 171-72&nbsp;(1986) (wherein an initial finding of abandonment was made, and judicially-motivated repentance stood alone as a factor demonstrating such abandonment had been cured).Â  \r\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Stepfatherâ€™s final argument is that the family court erred in overruling his objection regarding certain testimony by his pastor. The party objecting to disclosure of the information has the burden of showing the privilege applies. The determination whether the privilege applies is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  We find no abuse of discretion and affirm pursuant to the following authorities: Rivers v. Rivers,&nbsp;292 S.C. 21, 26, 354 S.E.2d 784, 787&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1987), overruled on other grounds by Russo v. Sutton,&nbsp;310 S.C. 200, 205, 422 S.E.2d 750, 753&nbsp;(1992) (holding that four conditions must be established before the clergyman-penitent privilege applies: (1) a confidential communication; (2) the confidential communication must be disclosed to a regular or duly ordained minister, priest, or rabbi; (3) the confidential communication must be entrusted to the clergyman in his professional capacity; and (4) the confidential communication must be one that is necessary and proper to enable the clergyman to discharge the functions of his office according to the usual course of practice or discipline of his church or religious body).Â  We further discern no resulting prejudice from the pastorâ€™s testimony.\r\n5.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We concur with the experienced and able family court judgeâ€™s finding that termination is not in the best interests of Child, a finding to which Stepfather takes no exception.Â  The failure to challenge this finding is an independent basis on which to affirm.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant,&nbsp;338 S.C. 406, 419-421, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723-24&nbsp;(2000) (holding that an appellate court may affirm based on any ground appearing in the record); Parker,&nbsp;336 S.C. at 258, 519 S.E.2d at 356&nbsp;(â€œIn a termination of parental rights case, the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.â€); S.C.

Johnson III, of Columbia; Samuel M. Price, Jr., of Newberry; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This appeal concerns the probate courtâ€™s refusal to remove a formal testacy action to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court affirmed the denial of the removal.Â  We vacate in part, reverse in part, and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nMary Fulmer died April 29, 2002, at age 88, survived by her six children.Â  In a will dated July 2, 1998, Mrs. Fulmer left her daughter, appellant Janette Cain, 10.59 acres of real estate, with the rest of her real estate to be divided among her other five children and her residuary estate to be equally divided among all six children.Â  She also designated another daughter, respondent Jewel Oxner, to be the personal representative of her estate. \r\nOn December 20, 2002, Oxner, in her capacity as personal representative of Mrs. Fulmerâ€™s estate, filed an action in the probate court against Cain.Â  In her complaint, Oxner sought to set aside the transfer of funds in certain accounts to which Cain and their late mother held joint title, asserted a cause of action for fraud against Cain, and initiated a formal proceeding to set aside a handwritten codicil purportedly executed by Mrs. Fulmer on September 15, 2000,[2] by which she devised additional real property to Cain.Â  Cain counterclaimed for Oxnerâ€™s removal as personal representative, damages for waste, and the issuance of deeds of distribution.Â  Cain did not seek to remove this action to the circuit court.Â  \r\nOn February 28, 2003, the respondents in this appealâ€”Oxner and Mrs. Fulmerâ€™s other four childrenâ€”filed a petition in the probate court for formal testacy and other relief, naming Cain as party-defendant.Â  The petition included a jury trial demand.Â  That same day, Respondents filed an addendum to their petition challenging the validity of the codicil and asserting causes of action against Cain for breach of contract and fraud in the inducement, breach of confidential or fiduciary relationship, tortious interference with a contract, and tortious interference with inheritance rights.Â  They also moved to consolidate their action with the case that Oxner had filed on behalf of Mrs. Fulmerâ€™s estate.Â  On March 4, 2003, Cain moved to remove the second action to the circuit court and to dismiss it pursuant to Rule 12(b),\r\nSCRCP.&nbsp; \r\nAfter a hearing on July 17, 2003, the probate court (1) granted Respondentsâ€™ motion to consolidate the two actions; (2) denied Cainâ€™s motion to remove the action to the circuit court; and (3) granted Cainâ€™s motion to dismiss the cause of action for interference with an inheritance; (4) otherwise denied Cainâ€™s motion to dismiss.\r\nOn cross-appeals from the probate courtâ€™s ruling, the circuit court reversed the dismissal of the cause of action for interference with an inheritance and affirmed the probate courtâ€™s decisions to consolidate the two actions and to deny Cainâ€™s motion to remove the second action to the circuit court.Â  Cain appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Probate Code governs appeals from the probate court.[3]Â  Under South Carolina Code section 62-1-308(a), â€œa person interested in a final order, sentence, or decree of a probate court and considering himself injured by it may appeal to the circuit court in the same county.â€[4]Â  The circuit court, in determining the appeal, must apply the same standard of review as an appellate court would apply.[5]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Respondents argue the order Cain challenges is interlocutory and does not fall within any of the categories of appealable judgments, decrees, or orders.[6]Â  We agree the order is interlocutory; however, based on our review of the pleadings filed in this case, we conclude it is nevertheless appealable because it has the effect of denying Cain a mode of trial to which she is entitled.[7]\r\nThe South Carolina Probate Code provides certain actions filed in the probate court â€œmust be removedâ€ to the circuit court upon a timely motion by â€œany party.â€[8]Â  These actions include â€œformal proceedings for the probate of wills and for the appointment of personal representativesâ€[9] and â€œactions in which a party has a right to trial by jury and which involve an amount in controversy of at least five thousand dollars in value.â€[10]Â  Although, as Respondents argue, jury trials are available in the probate court,[11] the commentary to the pertinent statutory provisions suggests the legislature contemplated that the â€œmode of trialâ€ to which an interested litigant was entitled as a matter of right includes the particular tribunal designated to adjudicate the matter.[12]Â  Unlike a venue order, which affects only the location of the tribunal and is therefore not appealable, the denial of Cainâ€™s motion to remove the matter to the circuit court involves the tribunal itself.Â  Moreover, we cannot overlook the significance of the fact that, although the South Carolina General Assembly in 1988 amended the statute governing jury trials in the probate court to state that â€œ[t]he right to trial by jury exists in, but is not limited to proceedings in favor of the probate of a will or contesting the probate of a will,â€[13] it left the right of removal to the circuit court intact.Â  \r\n2.Â  Respondents contend Cainâ€™s failure to appeal the probate courtâ€™s finding that she had waived her right to remove the second lawsuit by failing to request removal of the first action warrants dismissal of this appeal under the â€œlaw of the caseâ€ doctrine.Â  We disagree.Â  Cainâ€™s motion to remove was based on section 62-1-302, which, as evident from its heading, concerns the â€œ[s]ubject matter jurisdictionâ€ of the probate court.Â  Cainâ€™s alleged failure to appeal the probate courtâ€™s finding of a waiver should not bar her from raising this issue on appeal.[14]Â  In any event, we agree with Cain that her first ground of appeal to the circuit court adequately encompassed the issue of waiver.[15]\r\n3.Â  Respondents further argue Cainâ€™s appeal is moot because their counsel â€œstipulated that if this Court were to remand the consolidated actions to the Probate Court, they would not oppose [Cainâ€™s] removal of the consolidated actions to this Court once the Personal Representative amended her pleadings.â€Â  We disagree.Â  At best, the stipulation would control only Respondentsâ€™ actions.Â  It does not guarantee that the probate court would grant the removal even without opposition from Respondents.Â  Because we are called to determine whether removal to the circuit court was mandatory irrespective of whether there is opposition from another party to the litigation, our judgment, when rendered, will have a â€œpractical legal effect upon [the] existing controversy.â€[16]Â  Contrary, then, to Respondentsâ€™ assertion, Cainâ€™s appeal is not moot.\r\n4.Â  We agree with Cain that the circuit court erred in affirming the probate courtâ€™s denial of her motion for removal.Â  â€œ[N]otwithstanding the exclusive jurisdictionâ€ of the probate court over certain matters, the South Carolina Probate Code specifically allows litigants to request removal of cases pending in the probate court to circuit court.[17]Â  Provided the motion for removal is timely, removal to the circuit court is not a matter of discretion for the probate court; rather, it must occur if the causes of action requested for removal relate to certain subject matters, among them formal proceedings for the probate of wills and the appointment of personal representatives[18] and â€œactions in which a party has a right to a jury trial and which involve an amount in controversy of at least five thousand dollars in value.â€[19]Â  There is no allegation in the present case that Cainâ€™s motion to remove was untimely or that the cause of action for which she sought removal did not relate to at least one of the subject matters enumerated in South Carolina Code section 62-1-302(c).\r\n5.Â  Respondents correctly point out that Cain did not request removal of the action that Oxner filed against her on behalf of the estate.Â  We, however, agree with Cain that this failure does not amount to a waiver of her right to remove the later action that Respondents filed against her.Â  \r\nWe agree there may have been some overlap in the issues raised in the two lawsuits.Â  Nevertheless, whereas the initial action was ostensibly brought to recover assets for Mrs. Fulmerâ€™s estate, the second action included a claim by her purported beneficiaries for recovery of actual and punitive damages for themselves, not their motherâ€™s estate.Â  Under these circumstances, the two actions are not related in such a way that Cainâ€™s failure to request removal of the first one would constitute a forfeiture of her right to have the subsequent one transferred to the circuit court pursuant to section 62-1-302.[20]\r\n6.Â  We further agree with Cain that the probate court erred in ruling on any matter other than removal to the circuit court and hold the circuit court should have vacated any such rulings.Â  The probate code expressly requires that, upon removal, the circuit court â€œshall proceed upon the matter de novo.â€[21]Â  \r\n VACATED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  This date is taken from Oxnerâ€™s complaint.Â  The appealed order states the codicil is stated July 15, 2002, which is inconsistent with the fact that Mrs. Fulmer died April 29, 2002.\r\n[3]Â  Golini v.

Ott, and James B. Jackson, Jr., both of Orangeburg, for Guardian Ad Litem.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Sharon Smith appeals the termination of her parental rights to two of her children, Desmond Smith and John Smith.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe South Carolina Department of Social Services filed suit seeking to terminate the parental rights of Smith.Â  Adam Turkvant, Johnâ€™s father, agreed to the termination of his rights.Â  The termination of Desmondâ€™s fatherâ€™s rights has not been appealed.[2]Â  Desmond and John were removed from Smithâ€™s care when she tested positive for drugs at the time of Desmondâ€™s birth.Â  The boys were placed in the care of their great-grandmother, Maybell Color-Wolf, pursuant to a DSS safety plan.Â  They were removed from Wolfâ€™s care on November 5, 2001 because, at the age of 92 and in failing health, Wolf was unable to appropriately supervise and care for the children.[3]Â  Desmond and John were placed in foster care with a family that is now prepared to adopt both.Â  \r\nSmith appeared at a court hearing regarding the children in November 2001.Â  After the hearing, the family court issued an order requiring Smith to do the following:Â  (a) complete all services [primarily drug counseling] recommended by the Dawn Center, (b) complete parenting classes and follow recommendations, and (c) maintain safe and suitable housing.Â  Smith did not attempt to communicate with anyone at DSS regarding the children again until over a year later in December 2002.Â  In the interim, in August 2002, Smith was incarcerated in a Florida federal prison on drug charges.Â  \r\nWhile incarcerated, Smith has been employed earning $.68 per hour.Â  She has completed drug counseling and parenting classes.Â  Smith has failed to send any monetary support to Desmond and John other than some pajamas and a book.Â  \r\nDSS filed the underlying TPR action in March 2004.Â  The family court terminated Smithâ€™s parental rights based on a failure to support for six months, failure to remedy the conditions that caused the removal of the children, and their presence in foster care for 15 out of the previous 22 months.Â  Smith appeals the courtâ€™s rulings as to failure to support and failure to comply with her treatment plan.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR case, the paramount consideration is the best interests\r\nof the children.Â  See Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 296, 513 S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999).\r\nÂ In a TPR case, the appellate court may review the record and make its own findings of whether clear and convincing evidence supports termination.Â  Hardy v. Gunter, 353 S.C. 128, 134, 577 S.E.2d 231, 234 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  However, our broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact that the trial judge was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â \r\nDorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSmith claims the family court erred in finding that she willfully failed to support Desmond and John for a period of six months and failed to comply with her prescribed treatment plan.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn support of her argument, Smith points out that she was not under a court order to pay support and that she was incarcerated since August of 2002.Â  While incarceration may limit a parentâ€™s ability to earn, it does not relieve them of the burden to support their child.Â \r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Phillips, 301 S.C. 308, 310, 391 S.E.2d 584, 585 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  Furthermore, â€œnothing in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3) &amp; (4) . . . requires a parent be â€˜notifiedâ€™ of [her] duty to support or visit [a child] before failure to discharge those duties may serve as grounds for termination of parental rights.â€Â \r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 258, 519 S.E.2d 351, 356 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The record shows that Smith was earning $.68 per hour.Â  While that is an admittedly modest sum, the only things she ever sent to the children were pajamas and a book.Â  Additionally, in months immediately preceding her incarceration, Smithâ€™s whereabouts were unknown, and the unrefuted evidence is she provided no support during that time.Â  Based on the record and the applicable statutory provision, we find there is clear and convincing evidence to support the family courtâ€™s determination.\r\nSmith further claims the family court erred in finding that she had not complied with the terms of her treatment plan and remedied the conditions that caused the childrenâ€™s removal from the home.Â  However, the record shows that Smith only attempted to comply with the counseling requirements of her treatment plan after her incarceration and that she had, as of the time of the TPR hearing, failed to obtain stable housing.Â  \r\nAs to the best interests of the children, the record shows that their behavior and schoolwork have improved significantly while in foster care.Â  They have established a bond with their foster parents calling them â€œMaâ€ and â€œDaâ€ and, according to their caseworker, are ready to proceed with the process of adoption.Â  \r\nBecause there is clear and convincing evidence supporting the family courtâ€™s termination of parental rights and because such action is in the best interest of the children, the ruling of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, STILWELL, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]   Kenneth Grant and/or John Doe are cited as Desmondâ€™s father.Â  The judge determined that Desmondâ€™s father had failed to support or visit him for greater than six months and that Desmond had lived in foster care for at least 15 of the last 22 months.Â  \r\n[3]   The legal basis for removal was â€œchild abuse or neglectâ€ under S.C.

Mitchell, of Greenville; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Richard Howard, Jr., appeals the family courtâ€™s order finding the emergency removal of his children from his home had merit.[1]Â  We reverse and remand. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 10, 2005, the Department of Social Services (DSS) was contacted concerning a black eye and cut or scratch on the face of ten-year-old Richard Howard, IV (Son).Â  According to Son and his mother, Loretta Henry (Mother), his injuries were caused when Richard Howard, Jr. (Father) slapped Son on the back of his head, causing him to fall forward and hit his head on the kitchen table.Â  During the DSS investigation, allegations were made that Father trained pit bulls on the familyâ€™s property to fight; had several weapons; was physically and emotionally abusive towards Mother; threatened the life of the childrenâ€™s maternal grandmother; and suffered from bipolar disorder.Â  As a result, Son and his three sisters were taken into emergency protective custody on January 13, 2005.Â Â  \r\nA probable cause hearing was held on January 18, 2005.Â  Mother appeared, but Father was not present because he was involuntarily placed at the Carolina Center for Behavioral Health.Â  The family court issued an order appointing counsel and a guardian ad litem for Father and finding probable cause existed to keep the children in protective custody.Â  The Probable Cause Removal Hearing Order gave the parties notice that a merits hearing would be held on February 15, 2005.Â  A merits removal order was issued on February 15, 2005,[2] and Father was personally served with the order.Â  Included in the order was a notice for the trial date of March 17, 2005.Â Â  \r\nFather failed to appear at the March 17, 2005 hearing because he was incarcerated in federal prison in North Carolina awaiting a mental evaluation.Â  Fatherâ€™s guardian ad litem and appointed counsel appeared on his behalf.Â  Counsel moved for a continuance, arguing that he did not have access to Father and there was no way for Father to participate in the hearing.Â  Counsel stated he was informed that he would not have access to Father until after the mental evaluation, which would be at least four or five months after the hearing.Â  The family court noted the removal statute only allows for a thirty-day continuance and requires the matter to be concluded within sixty-five days.Â  Noting that Father still would be unavailable within thirty days, the matter was already near the sixty-five day mark, and Father had a guardian ad litem, the court denied the request for a continuance.Â  After a hearing on the merits, the court made a finding that Father physically struck Son and placed the other children at substantial risk of abuse.Â  The court also approved Motherâ€™s plea agreement with DSS, finding a substantial risk of abuse to the children based on a failure to protect.Â  The court approved a treatment plan for both parents.Â  The court approved placement of the oldest daughters with their maternal grandmother and placement in foster care for Son and the youngest daughter.Â  Father appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œThis degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of a minor child.â€Â  Ex Parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 62, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006).Â  Further, this broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant from the burden of showing the family court erred.Â  Id.Â  Whether to grant or deny a motion for a continuance is a matter within the sole discretion of the family court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bridwell v. Bridwell, 279 S.C. 111, 112, 302 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1983).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFather argues the family court erred in failing to grant his motion for a continuance because it resulted in a violation of his due process rights.Â  He asserts the merits hearing concerned his fundamental rights as a parent, and thus, he deserved the â€œopportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.â€Â  \r\nIn discussing due process rights in removal situations, this court noted as follows:\r\n\r\nâ€œDue process is a flexible concept, and the requirements of due process in a particular case are dependent upon the importance of the interest involved and the circumstances under which the deprivation may occur.â€Â \r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Beeks, 325 S.C. 243, 246, 481 S.E.2d 703, 705 (1997).Â  â€œThe fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.â€Â  Id.  \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Meek, 352 S.C. 523, 533, 575 S.E.2d 846, 851 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  A parentâ€™s interest in the custody of his or her children is â€œextraordinarily significant,â€ triggering fundamental due process rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard.Â  Meek, 352 S.C. at 534, 575 S.E.2d at 851.Â  \r\nIn DSS emergency removal cases, the statute outlines a strict timeline for the judicial process.Â  A probable cause hearing must be held within seventy-two hours of the time the child was taken into protective custody.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-610(M) (Supp. 2005).Â  A hearing on the merits â€œmust be held within thirty-five days of the date of the receipt of the removal petition.â€Â  Id.Â  When read in conjunction with other statutes, our courts have determined this section does not mean that the hearing must be concluded within thirty-five days, but the merits hearing must be scheduled within thirty-five days.Â \r\nSouth Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Gamble, 337 S.C. 428, 432, 523 S.E.2d 477, 479 (Ct. App. 1999) (reading section 20-7-610(M) in conjunction with section 20-7-736(E), the court found that â€œthe plain language of the statute indicates that a merits hearing must be scheduled to be held within thirty-five days of receipt of the removal petition.Â  The statute does not indicate that the hearing must be completed within the thirty-five day period.Â  Therefore the requirement that a hearing on the merits actually come to a conclusion within thirty-five days of the removal petition should not be read into the statute.â€).Â  \r\nWhere exceptional circumstances exist, the family court may grant a continuance:\r\n\r\nA party may request a continuance that would result in the hearing being held more than thirty-five days after the petition was filed, and the court may grant the request for continuance only if exceptional circumstances exist.Â  If a continuance is granted, the hearing on the merits must be completed within sixty-five days following receipt of the removal petition.Â  The court may continue the hearing on the merits beyond sixty-five days without returning the child to the home only if the court issues a written order with findings of fact supporting a determination that the following conditions are satisfied, regardless of whether the parties have agreed to a continuance:\r\n  \r\n(1)Â  the court finds that the child should remain in the custody of the department because there is probable cause to believe that returning the child to the home would seriously endanger the childâ€™s physical safety or emotional well-being;\r\n(2)Â  the court schedules the case for trial on a date and time certain which is not more than thirty days after the date the hearing was scheduled to be held; and\r\n(3)Â  the court finds that exceptional circumstances support the continuance or the parties and the guardian ad litem agree to a continuance.\r\n  \r\nThe court may continue the case past the date and time certain set forth in subsection (M) only if the court issues a new order as required in subsection (M).\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-610 (M) (Supp. 2005).Â  The plain language of this statute indicates that multiple continuances can be given past the sixty-five day time limit as long as the family court revisits the matter every thirty days, issuing a new order each time.Â  See Gamble, 337 S.C. at 431, 523 S.E.2d at 478 (noting that the legislative intent of a statute must be determined from the language of the statute itself where the statute is complete, plain, and unambiguous).\r\nIn denying Fatherâ€™s motion for a continuance in the present case, the family court noted that the parties were nearing the statutory sixty-five day time limit.Â  The court also noted that continuances could be given every thirty days past the sixty-five day time limit:\r\n\r\nI would continue it, but I can only do it for 30 days.Â  And quite candidly, it just does not appear thereâ€™s going to be a significant change for anybody in 30, 60, 90 days.Â  And from that standpoint, I donâ€™t see anything to be achieved, or gained, by continuing the case.Â  I have great sympathy for counsel, and understand it puts you in sort of a dilemma that you donâ€™t have a client.Â  But legally, thereâ€™s a guardian appointed, and he is in federal prison, so I believe that the department can go forward.Â  So what Iâ€™m going to do is, Iâ€™m gonna deny the request for a continuance.\r\n\r\nAlthough the decision to grant a continuance normally rests within the broad discretion of the family court, there is not enough in the record to support the denial of the requested continuance in this case.Â  Considering the fact that Father failed to appear at two hearings because he was institutionalized either in a behavioral hospital or in federal prison awaiting a mental evaluation, a continuance of the case against Father would have allowed counsel and the guardian ad litem the opportunity to attempt to meet with Father to discuss the removal case.Â  The family court pointed out, and Fatherâ€™s counsel did not deny, that it was possible Father would not have been available to appear at a hearing within ninety days if the matter was continued.Â  However, there was no further inquiry into the possibility of Father being available for a rescheduled hearing past this initial speculation.Â  \r\nWe are mindful of the fact that family courts must proceed as expeditiously as possible in emergency placement cases to protect the welfare of the children.Â  Any continuance of the matter against Father, however, would not have created a risk of harm to the children as they were safely placed either in foster care or with their maternal grandmother pursuant to Motherâ€™s plea agreement.Â  Because the children were not in any danger and Fatherâ€™s counsel seemed unsure of when he could see his client, the family court could have allowed a continuance for further inquiry into the possibility of Fatherâ€™s later appearance.Â  As previously discussed, however, the family court denied Fatherâ€™s motion based on speculation that a continuance would have been futile.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the denial of the continuance and remand the matter for specific findings on whether there was evidence at the time of the hearing that Father would not have been available within the time provided by statute.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nUnder the particular facts of this case, we find the family courtâ€™s order denying Father a continuance of the merits hearing is not supported by the record.Â  Accordingly, the portion of the family courtâ€™s merits order regarding Father is reversed and the matter is remanded to the family court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.[3]  \r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Loretta Henry, the mother of the four children, was also a party in the underlying DSS action.Â  She is not a party in this appeal.Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  Although there is no evidence in the record indicating that a merits hearing was held on February 15, 2005, it appears there was such a hearing at which time a continuance was granted.Â  The January 18, 2005 Probable Cause Removal Hearing Order notifies the parties that a hearing was to be held on February 15th.Â  The February 15, 2005 placement plan included in the record references the February 15, 2005 order, which is not in the record.Â  Further, DSSâ€™s brief indicates the original merits hearing was continued until March 17, 2005, to allow appointment of an attorney for Father.Â Â  \r\n[3]Â  Father also argued on appeal that the family court erred in making a finding of abuse.Â  There is evidence in the record to support the removal of the children.Â  We are only reversing and remanding for a hearing to determine whether there were facts to support the denial of the motion for a continuance.Â  If the family court finds there was evidence at the time of the hearing that Father would not have been available after a continuance, then the family courtâ€™s order denying the continuance and making findings to support the removal shall be reinstated.Â  If the court finds there was no evidence that a continuance would have been futile, then a new merits hearing shall be held with regard to Father.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial

Pride II, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Shawn L. Reeves, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: John Tamorris McClure appeals his conviction for possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFacts\r\nOn April 22, 2004, the Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Enforcement Unit (the Unit) executed a search of a mobile home located at 2447 Holly Road in York County, South Carolina and the immediate surrounding area. Â Prior to that date, the Unit had received complaints of drug activity in that area, which made Holly Road an area of interest.Â  After a police informant made a crack cocaine purchase at the mobile home on Holly Road, the officers noticed further suspicious activity.Â  Several individuals were seen â€œcoming and going, persons driving up and staying less than five minutes, meeting with other persons and then leaving, which is consistent with drug activity.â€ Further, the officers noticed that in the afternoons, people would gather on both sides of the street near the home.Â  \r\nBased on the information obtained from their observations and informant, the officers of the Unit obtained a search warrant for the mobile home. The Unit planned a surveillance of the grassy lot directly across the street. Â â€œConsensual encountersâ€ were to be conducted with people on the grassy lot.Â  During the search, McClure was seated in a car in the grassy lot across the street. While two teams from the Unit went into the house, two other officers parked, without blocking in McClure, and â€œranâ€ over to the vehicle in which McClure was in the driverâ€™s seat.Â  The officers testified to seeing drugs in the car as they approached the vehicle.Â  Everyone in the car was detained and searched.\r\nMcClure was indicted for possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine.Â  Although the court agreed with McClure that the search of the car and the seizure of the crack cocaine had been completed without a search warrant, the court found the evidence fell within the â€œplain viewâ€ exception.Â  After conviction by a jury, the trial judge sentenced McClure to fifteen years, plus a $50,000 fine.Â  Further, the judge revoked McClureâ€™s probation related to a previous conviction, thereby adding nine years to his fifteen year sentence.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001). Â The appellate court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings, including preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases, unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Wilson, 245 S.C. at 5, 545 S.E.2d at 829.\r\nThe appellate standard of review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding.Â  State v. Pichardo, 367 S.C. 84, 623 S.E.2d 840 (Ct. App. 2005). Â The trial judgeâ€™s factual findings on whether evidence should be suppressed due to a Fourth Amendment violation are reviewed for clear\r\nerror. State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 625 S.E.2d 216 (2006); see also State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 665-66 (2000) (noting a private search is a question of fact and the trial courtâ€™s ruling will be reversed only if there is clear error).Â  The appellate court may only reverse where there is clear error.Â  Pichardo, 367 S.C. at 95, 623 S.E.2d at 846.Â  The â€œclear errorâ€ standard means that an appellate court will not reverse a trial courtâ€™s finding of fact simply because it would have decided the case differently.Â  Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234 (2001); Pichardo, 367 S.C. at 96, 623 S.E.2d at 846.Â  Rather, the appellate court must ask whether, on the entire evidence, it is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.Â  Id.\r\nAn appellate court must affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling if there is any evidence to support the ruling.Â  Pichardo, 367 S.C. at 96, 623 S.E.2d at 846.\r\nDiscussion\r\nDuring a pretrial hearing, McClure moved to suppress the crack cocaine and other items found in his possession on the night of April 22, 2004.Â  After the motion for suppression was heard and in camera testimony was proffered, the judge denied the motion to suppress the evidence.Â  The judge elucidated: â€œI [am] allowing it in. When it [is] offered into evidence, obviously then you can just simply make an objection, just note â€˜my objectionâ€™ and I [will] do that at the time. Make sure it [is] protected on the record.â€ Â When the evidence was later introduced, McClure did not object.Â  McClure did not object: (1) to Commander Marvin Brownâ€™s testimony concerning the drugs he found in McClureâ€™s possession; or (2) when the State entered as evidence the metal box containing drugs found in McClureâ€™s lap, the saucer found at McClureâ€™s feet, or the drugs found both in the metal box and at McClureâ€™s feet.\r\nAn in limine ruling is not final and does not preserve an issue for appeal.Â  State v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 591, 521 S.E.2d 500, 503 (1999). Â An issue is not preserved for appeal if trial counsel fails to make a contemporaneous objection to the entry of evidence when the evidence is presented at trial. Â State v. Wannamaker, 346 S.C. 495, 499, 552 S.E.2d 284, 286 (2001).Â  No issue may be raised for the first time on appeal, instead it must have been raised at trial in order to preserve the issue for appeal.Â  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118 (1997). Â Because McClure failed to object to the entry of evidence at the time the State introduced the evidence at trial, he is precluded from raising this issue on appeal.Â  Thus, this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nConclusion\r\nAccordingly, McClureâ€™s conviction and sentence are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY, and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-261","title":"Premier Resorts International v.

Jackson Thomas, of Myrtle Beach, for Appellant.\r\nMark McAdams and Amanda A.

The term of this Agreement shall commence on May 1, 2002 and shall continue until December 31, 2007.Â  Thereafter, this Agreement shall renew annually subject to termination by [Sands] or [Premier] upon notice delivered prior to November 1 of each year.\r\n. . . .\r\n10.Â Â Â Â  No Special Damages.Â  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, neither party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages (including but not limited to damages for lost profits, lost revenues, or the cost of purchasing replacement services) arising out of the performance or failure to perform under this Agreement.\r\n. . . .\r\n19.Â Â Â Â  Termination.\r\n. . . .\r\n[(2)] (d) Budget Shortfall. Either party hereto may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice if [certain contractual budgetary and revenue-related goals] for Resort Operations [are not met] . . . .\r\n(3) Compensation.Â  Within sixty (60) days after termination as provided herein, [Sands] shall pay to [Premier] the management fees prorated as of the termination date and its reimbursable expenses.Â  Upon such termination and payment, neither party shall have any obligation to the other for future performance under the Agreement, except that each party shall remain liable to the other with respect to performance due or owed under this Agreement . . . .\r\n\r\nThe parties agree that Sands terminated the Agreement in January 2003.Â  The parties disagree, however, about whether Sandsâ€™ termination was wrongful or in compliance with paragraph 19(2)(d) of the Agreement.Â  As a result, Premier filed a complaint against Sands for breach of the Agreement.Â  Premier sought two distinct damage awards: $196,559.09 for services rendered, and approximately $5,000,000 for lost revenue and profit based on the amount that would be due under the Agreement through December 31, 2007.Â  Sands answered, alleged that it complied with paragraph 19(2)(d) in terminating the Agreement, and averred that paragraphs 10 and 19(3) of the Agreement precluded the second type of damages alleged by Premier.Â  \r\nSands paid $189,836.00 to settle Premierâ€™s first damage claim for services rendered.Â  In October 2004, Sands moved for summary judgment on the second damages claim for lost revenues, arguing the express terms of the Agreement prevented Premier from recovering damages for lost revenue or lost profits.Â  Premier argued the lost revenues or profits to which it was entitled were general damages and thus outside the province of paragraph 10.Â  In addition, Premier argued paragraph 19(3) did not apply because Sands wrongfully breached the Agreement.Â  \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment to Sands, holding the parties intended to preclude the recovery of lost revenues or profits, whether general or special damages, in paragraph 10 of the Agreement. The court further held that the lost revenues or profits alleged by Premier were special damages precluded by paragraph 10, and that paragraph 19(3) applies only to a wrongful breach.Â  Premier filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion, which the trial court denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  Houck v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.,&nbsp;366 S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326, 329&nbsp;(2005).Â  The trial court should grant summary judgment â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535&nbsp;(2005).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 338, 611 S.E.2d 485, 487&nbsp;(2005).Â  \r\nMoreover, the construction and enforcement of an unambiguous contract is a question of law for the court and thus can be properly disposed of at summary judgment.Â  Hansen v. United Servs. Auto. Assâ€™n, 350 S.C. 62, 67, 565 S.E.2d 114, 116&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  In such a case, summary judgment is proper and a trial unnecessary when the intention of the parties as to the legal effect of the contract may be gathered from the four corners of the instrument itself.Â  First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Conway Natâ€™l Bank, 282 S.C. 303, 305, 317 S.E.2d 776, 777&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPremier argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because: (1) the Agreement unambiguously states only lost revenues or profits that can be categorized as special damages are precluded; (2) the lost revenues and profits it seeks here are properly categorized as general damages; and (3) paragraph 19(3) only applies to a wrongful termination.Â  Because we disagree with Premierâ€™s first argument, we find it unnecessary to address Premierâ€™s second and third issues.\r\nâ€œIn general, if the contract is unambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used, and the terms are to be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.â€Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 110, 531 S.E.2d 287, 293&nbsp;(2000).Â  When the parties define the words or terms that they propose using, the contract will be interpreted according to such definitions if free from ambiguity.Â  C.A.N. Enters., Inc. v. S. C. Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 378, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586&nbsp;(1988).Â  â€œThe judicial function of a court of law is to enforce a contract as made by the parties, and not to rewrite or to distort, under the guise of judicial construction, contracts, the terms of which are plain and unambiguous.â€Â  Hardee v. Hardee, 355 S.C. 382, 387, 585 S.E.2d 501, 503&nbsp;(2003).Â  The duty of a court is limited to the interpretation of the contract made by the parties themselves regardless of the contractâ€™s wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, or failure of the parties to guard their rights carefully.Â  Gilstrap v. Culpepper, 283 S.C. 83, 86, 320 S.E.2d 445, 447&nbsp;(1984).\r\nHowever, when an agreement is ambiguous, the court should seek to determine the partiesâ€™ intent.Â  Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 94, 594 S.E.2d 485, 493&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  A contract is ambiguous only when it may fairly and reasonably be understood in more ways than one.Â  Goldston v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 358 S.C. 157, 170, 594 S.E.2d 511, 518&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  A contract is read as a whole document so that one may not, by pointing out a single sentence or clause, create an ambiguity.Â  Southern Atl. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Middleton, 356 S.C. 444, 447, 590 S.E.2d 27, 29&nbsp;(2003).Â  Furthermore, a proper construction seeks to harmonize the various provisions, and a construction that gives meaning to all should be preferred over one which renders some provisions meaningless.Â  Hays v. Adair, 267 S.C. 291, 296, 227 S.E.2d 665, 667-68&nbsp;(1976).\r\nIn this case, the trial court held â€œeven if the Court were to categorize the damages sought by Premier as general damages, the recovery of those damages have been specifically precluded by the parties.â€Â  By its express terms, paragraph 10 includes lost revenues and lost profits in the category of damages that cannot be recovered.Â  Premier contends on appeal that paragraph 10 should be read correctly as â€œneither party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, including special damages for lost profits, lost revenue . . . .â€Â  However, this construction would render the parenthetical information in paragraph 10 meaningless.Â  See Hays, 267 S.C. at 296, 227 S.E.2d at 667-68.Â  We hold the Agreement unambiguously defines any claims for loss of revenue or profit as claims for special damages.Â  Therefore, the trial court properly held these claims were excluded under paragraph 10 of the Agreement.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-262","title":"Norton v.

Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\nSteveÂ  Wukela, Jr., of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation action, Wellman, Inc., appeals a circuit court order affirming the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s decision awarding benefits to Elaine Norton, a former employee.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt the time Elaine Norton testified in front of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, she was 62 years old.Â  Norton worked for Wellman, Inc., for thirty years in several different capacities.Â  When Norton first began her employment, her duties consisted primarily of typing reports written by other people in the company.Â  After approximately seven years, Norton began working in the purchasing department where she typed purchase orders and shipping authorizations.Â  \r\nWhen the company began using computers, Norton began to do a considerable amount of keyboard data entry.Â  Due to company downsizing, for the last five years of Nortonâ€™s employment she was the only clerk working in the purchasing department.Â  Nortonâ€™s other duties consisted of filing, answering the phone, information gathering, and various other computer work.Â  \r\nNorton testified that for approximately fifteen years she had problems with neck pain.Â  She also stated that her employer was aware of these problems and that she began seeing a chiropractor for treatment.Â  Norton received treatment from this chiropractor, Dr. Ware, for fifteen years.Â  Norton stated that during â€œthe last quarter of 2002â€ she began to develop pain in her arms between the shoulder and elbow.Â  \r\nBecause of the increasing pain and failure of the chiropractic visits to alleviate it, Norton began seeing Dr. Miller, her family physician.Â  Dr. Miller conducted several tests on Norton including an MRI on the upper portion of her body.Â  After receiving the results of these tests, Dr. Miller suggested Norton cease working and she was placed on medical leave on February 4, 2003.Â  \r\nAfter several visits to Dr. Miller, Norton was referred to Dr. Healeyâ€”a neurologist.Â  Dr. Healey also performed a number of tests on Norton including, inter alia, another MRI and a test for carpel tunnel syndrome on June 12, 2003.Â  Dr. Healeyâ€™s tests revealed a number of medical problems.Â  For instance, Dr. Healey testified that Norton suffered from a sleep disorder, depression, and degenerative changes in her spine.Â  When questioned as to whether Nortonâ€™s spinal problems were caused by her duties at Wellman, Inc., Dr. Healey testified that he believed her work did contribute to the problems she was having.Â  \r\nDr. Healey also testified the carpal tunnel test revealed moderately severe bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.Â  He stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the carpal tunnel problems were related to the work Norton performed at Wellman, Inc.Â Â  In his deposition, Dr. Healey stated that June 24, 2003 was the first time he and Norton specifically talked about Nortonâ€™s work at Wellman, Inc. \r\nOn July 22, 2003, Norton filed a Form 50 with the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  A hearing was held before a single commissioner on March 16, 2004.Â  In her order, the single commissioner found, among other things, â€œthe evidence supports a finding the claimant suffered compensable work related injuries bilaterally to the upper extremities and back on or about June 24, 2003. . . .â€Â  Wellman, Inc. appealed this decision to an Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.\r\nOn February 24, 2005, the panel issued an order affirming the single commissionerâ€™s order with one amendment.Â  The panel amended the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact to clarify that Nortonâ€™s injuries were to her cervical spine and not to her lumbar spine.Â  Otherwise the commissionerâ€™s order was affirmed in its entirety.Â  \r\nWellman, Inc. then appealed this decision to the circuit court on June 9, 2005.Â  After review, the circuit court held there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Full Commissionâ€™s February 24, 2005 order.Â  Accordingly, the court affirmed the Commissionâ€™s decision in an order dated August 5, 2005.Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal to this court, Wellman, Inc. argues the preceding tribunals erred in finding and subsequently affirming the holding that Norton injured her back and right or left arm in an accident arising out of and in the course of her employment on June 24, 2003.Â  We affirm.\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act applies to appeals from decisions of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  In an appeal from the Commission, neither this Court nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 617, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œAny review of the commissionâ€™s factual findings is governed by the substantial evidence standard.â€Â  Lockridge v. Santens of Am., Inc., 344 S.C. 511, 515, 544 S.E.2d 842, 844 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Accordingly, we limit review to deciding whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Corbin, 351 S.C. at 617, 571 S.E.2d at 95.Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the full commission reached.â€Â  Lockridge, 344 S.C. at 515, 544 S.E.2d at 844.Â  â€œThe â€˜possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€™â€Â  Lee v. Harborside CafÃ©, 350 S.C. 74, 78, 564 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984)).\r\nSignificantly, â€œ[t]he Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases and is not bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.â€Â  Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 517, 526 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Accordingly, the appellate panel has the final determination of witness credibility and also determines the weight to be accorded evidence.Â  Id.Â  In the current case, after â€œcareful review,â€ the Commission found all of the hearing commissionerâ€™s Findings of Fact and Rulings of Law were correct as stated with the exception of the aforementioned amendment.Â  As such, the Commission adopted the hearing commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and rulings of law by reference into its final order as it is entitled to do under sections 42-17-40 and 1-23-350 of the South Carolina Code.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 42-17-40 (Supp. 2005) &amp; 1-23-350 (2005); see also Eaddy v. Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., 355 S.C. 154, 167-168, 584 S.E.2d 390, 397-398 (Ct. App. 2003) (interpreting these statutory provisions and concluding the Commission meets the requirements contained therein when it incorporates a single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and rulings of law by reference into its order).\r\nAs noted previously, Wellman, Inc. takes exception to the finding that Norton was injured in an accident arising out of her employment on June 24, 2003.Â  Wellman, Inc. is particularly concerned with the specific date of June 24, 2003, because it takes the position that since Norton ceased working in February 2003, it would be impossible for her to injure herself in an accident arising out of or in the course of her employment in June 2003.\r\nHowever, it is apparent from all of the previous orders issued in this case, including the circuit court order, that June 24, 2003, was the date Norton was diagnosed with conditions related to her employment with Wellman, Inc.Â  Dr. Healey specifically testified he did not talk to Norton about her duties at Wellman, Inc. until June 24, 2003.Â  It was on that date Dr. Healey attributed Nortonâ€™s problems to her employment.Â  \r\nAs noted by the circuit court, a repetitive trauma injury such as carpal tunnel syndrome is compensable under workersâ€™ compensation law.Â  Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 474, 617 S.E.2d 369, 380 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Furthermore, it is clear that a claimant must give notice of his injuries â€œwhen the employee becomes disabled and could discover with reasonable diligence his condition is compensable.â€Â  Id. at 481, 617 S.E.2d at 383.Â  \r\nNorton did not find out her health problems were causally related to her employment until June 24, 2003.Â  Shortly thereafter, she filed a Form 50 on July 22, 2003, which, as the circuit court noted, was well within the time limit prescribed for giving notice.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985) (delineating standards for providing notice of accidents covered by workersâ€™ compensation).Â  Accordingly, we find Wellman, Inc.â€™s appeal to be without merit. \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-263","title":"Richardson v.

Protopapas, Keith M. Babcock, A. Camden Lewis, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Joseph Richardson brought suit against Fairfield County for injuries resulting from a purported violation of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).Â  The trial court dismissed Richardsonâ€™s suit for mootness.Â  Richardson appeals the order, arguing the trial court erred: Â (1) in dismissing the action after granting leave to amend the complaint; (2) in dismissing the action when relief having a practical legal effect on the existing controversy was available; and (3) in the alternative, finding the â€œpublic importanceâ€ exception to the mootness doctrine did not apply.Â  We affirm. Â \r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 22, 2003, the Fairfield County Council noticed a Worksession/Special Meeting for April 23, 2003.Â  The notice included the location of the meeting, the date and time of the meeting, and an agenda for the meeting.Â  In addition, the notice listed â€œC&amp;D Landfillâ€ under â€œItems for Discussion.â€Â Â Â  \r\nAt the April 23, 2003 meeting, the County Council voted to issue a Letter of Consistency to I-77 Properties, LLC, (Company) indicating Companyâ€™s proposed landfill was consistent with county ordinances.Â Â Â  Company needed a Letter of Consistency to comply with the Department of Health and Environmental Controlâ€™s (DHEC) then existing permitting process.Â  At that time, DHEC delegated authority to the counties to determine whether a landfill was consistent with county ordinances, one requirement for receiving a permit for a landfill.Â Â  \r\nOn May 23, 2003, Richardson filed a complaint against Fairfield County for various causes of action.Â  On July 7, 2003, Richardson filed an amended complaint adding two other plaintiffs and alleging two causes of action.Â  Richardson alleged the Letter of Consistency was issued illegally and in violation of his due process rights under the South Carolina and United States Constitutions. Â Richardson also alleged Fairfield County violated FOIA by holding a meeting without providing proper notice of the meetingâ€™s agenda.Â  Specifically, Richardson argued the notice was overly vague and requested that the court issue an injunction preventing County Council from sending the Letter of Consistency to DHEC.Â  Company intervened in the action.Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nIn April of 2004, in Southeast Resource Recovery, Inc. (SRRI) v. South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, the South Carolina Supreme Court held â€œDHEC, not the county, is charged with ensuring proposed landfills meet the requirements for permitting,â€ and, thus, DHEC cannot delegate to the counties the authority to determine consistency with county ordinances through the countiesâ€™ issuance of Letters of Consistency.Â  Southeast Resource Recovery, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 358 S.C. 402, 408, 595 S.E.2d 468, 471 (2004).Â  Based on the courtâ€™s holding in SRRI, Fairfield County filed a motion to dismiss for mootness pursuant to Rule 12,\r\nSCRCP.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe circuit court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss on July 14, 2004.Â  At the hearing, Richardson moved to amend the complaint a second time in order to eliminate his due process claim.Â  The court granted leave to amend and then heard arguments surrounding Fairfield Countyâ€™s motion to dismiss the FOIA claim.Â  By order, the court granted the Countyâ€™s motion to dismiss for mootness.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nRichardson filed a Motion to Reconsider the Order Granting Dismissal.Â Â Â Â  The court denied Richardsonâ€™s Motion to Reconsider.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to grant a Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss must be based solely upon the allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  Carolina Care Plan, Inc. v. United Healthcare Servs., Inc., 361 S.C. 544, 550, 606 S.E.2d 752, 755 (2004).Â  A 12(b)(6) motion should not be granted if the facts alleged and the inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case. Â Gentry v. Yonce, 337 S.C. 1, 5, 522 S.E.2d 137, 139 (1999).Â  The question is whether, viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the complaint states any valid claim for relief, even if the court doubts that the plaintiff will prevail.Â  Carolina Care Plan, Inc., 361 S.C. at 550, 606 S.E.2d at 755. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDismissal After Granting Leave to Amend \r\nRichardson argues the trial court erred in dismissing this action after granting Richardson leave to amend his complaint.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, â€œ[a]n order to amend carries with it permission to file the amended pleading.â€Â  71 C.J.S. Pleading Â§ 423 (2000).Â  â€œPermission to amend the complaint contemplates an amendment which will cure the defects of the pleading without changing the essential basis of the cause of action which it originally attempted to set out.â€ Id.Â  The amended pleadings must be in conformity with the order to amend.Â  Id.Â  \r\nInitially, we find this issue is not preserved for review.Â  At the hearing, the trial court granted Richardson â€œleave to amend the complaint to eliminate the first cause of actionâ€ and then permitted Richardson to retain the allegations contained within the first cause of action to be included in the second cause of action in the amended complaint.Â  Subsequently, without objection, the court considered DHECâ€™s motion to dismiss the FOIA claim, the second cause of action. Â Because Richardson offered no objection to this procedure, he failed to properly preserve the issue for this courtâ€™s review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œ[A]n issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 212, 479 S.E.2d 35, 41 (1996) (noting failure to object at trial waives argument on appeal); Medlock v. One 1985 Jeep Cherokee VIN 1JCWB7828FT129001, 322 S.C. 127, 132, 470 S.E.2d 373, 376 (1996) (recognizing a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate review). Â Furthermore, Richardsonâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion, arguing the trial court erred in ruling on the issue of mootness before Richardsonâ€™s second amended complaint could be filed, is not sufficient to preserve this issue.Â  See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct. App. 1995) (stating, â€œ[a] party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trialâ€).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn any event, this issue fails on the merits.Â  After granting leave to amend pleadings, the trial court may still rule on a motion to dismiss pleadings that are unaffected by the leave to amend.Â  See Skudowitz v. Basha et. al., 106 S.C. 541, 544, 91 S.E. 868, 868 (1917) (recognizing trial court has discretion to grant partyâ€™s motion to amend pleadings at any stage in the trial â€œeven though it might have been necessary to withdraw the case from the jury and continue it, to prevent prejudice to the opposite partyâ€) (emphasis added); cf.\r\nShah v. Richland Memâ€™l Hosp., 350 S.C. 139, 147-51, 564 S.E.2d 681, 685-87 (Ct. App. 2002) (holding the trial court erred in failing to grant leave to amend pleadings to add additional party but upholding the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of one of plaintiffâ€™s claims due to mootness).Â  \r\nMoreover, even assuming a procedural abnormality, we fail to see how Richardson was prejudiced by the courtâ€™s decision to rule prior to a formal amendment to the pleadings.Â  In amending his complaint during the hearing, Richardson did not add any new causes of action, but instead, eliminated the first cause of action and retained the FOIA claim along with any relevant allegations that were part of the first cause of action. Moreover, Richardson was then permitted to argue the merits of the FOIA claim.Â  Thus, the court and the parties were cognizant of the substance of the remaining cause of action and any related issues. Â See Rule 15(b), SCRCP (â€œWhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.Â  Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues.â€); see also Parker v. Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer Dist., 362 S.C. 276, 286, 607 S.E.2d 711, 716 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œThe prejudice Rule 15 envisions is a lack of notice that the new issue is going to be tried, and lack of opportunity to refute it.â€); Ball v. Canadian Am. Express Co., 314 S.C. 272, 275, 442 S.E.2d 620, 622 (Ct. App. 1994) (discussing Rule 15, SCRCP and stating â€œ[p]rejudice occurs when the amendment states a new claim or defense which would require the opposing party to introduce additional or different evidence to prevail in the amended actionâ€).Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMootness \r\nRichardson contends the trial court erred in dismissing the FOIA claim as moot.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe court â€œwill not pass on moot and academic questions or make an adjudication where there remains no actual controversy.â€Â  Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 552, 590 S.E.2d 338, 349 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œA case becomes moot when a judgment, if rendered, would have no practical legal effect upon the existing controversy, thus making it impossible for the reviewing court to grant effectual relief.â€Â  State v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 581, 611 S.E.2d 273, 280 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nRichardson asserts his claim is not moot because the court may provide equitable relief that remedies the injury caused by the County Councilâ€™s purported FOIA violation. Â Admittedly, for violations of FOIA, â€œ[t]he court may order equitable relief as it considers appropriate.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-100(a) (1991).Â  Based on section 30-4-100(a), Richardson argues the court could invalidate the County Councilâ€™s Letter of Consistency which may still be considered by DHEC, issue an order that would â€œrestore to their full lawful condition [Richardsonâ€™s] and the publicâ€™s statutory rights under FOIA,â€ or order some other equitable relief.Â Â Â  \r\nWe find Richardson waived any right to an order invalidating the Letter of Consistency.Â  At the hearing, Richardson admitted the relief originally requested, to undo the Letter of Consistency, was no longer available.[1]Â  Â Â When asked by the court what relief Richardson sought, counsel responded, â€œ[t]he relief that I had asked for, your honor, was to undo the letter of consistency.Â  Obviously, we canâ€™t do that with S.R.I. [sic].â€Â  Based on this statement, we find Richardson abandoned his claim by failing to present any argument to the trial court. Â See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œ[A]n issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); In the Interest of Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004)(stating â€œthe trial court must be given an opportunity to resolve the issue\r\nbefore it is presented to the appellate courtâ€).Â  \r\nAdditionally, Richardsonâ€™s motion pursuant to Rule 59(e) did not preserve the issue.Â  First, Richardson could not use his motion to raise an issue which could have been presented to the court during the hearing.Â  Secondly, and more significantly, Richardson abandoned the issue at trial.Â  Finally, the trial court summarily denied the motion without specifically ruling on whether an order invalidating the Letter of Consistency would have a practical legal effect on the existing controversy. Â Without a specific ruling, this court is unable to review any alleged error in the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â  See Patterson, 318 S.C. at 185, 456 S.E.2d at 437 (â€œA party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.â€);\r\nShealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 460, 535 S.E.2d 438, 444 (2000) (stating a trial judgeâ€™s general ruling is insufficient to preserve a specific issue for appellate review).Â  \r\nEven on the merits, we find any other judgment that the court may render in Richardsonâ€™s favor, other than a judgment effecting the disposition of the Letter of Consistency, would have no effect on the existing legal controversy.Â  Indeed, at the hearing, Richardson suggested one possible remedy that the court could fashion would be to order the county to revise their notice procedures but admitted this remedy was solely to protect citizens in future situations.Â  Also, in his brief, Richardson suggests the court could issue an order enjoining the Council from future FOIA violations or issue an injunction that the Council alter its notice methods to ensure future compliance with the law.Â  Richardsonâ€™s suggested remedies and any other remedy the court could fashion would have no effect on the existing legal controversy, the Councilâ€™s issuance of a Letter of Consistency for Companyâ€™s proposed landfill.Â  To the contrary, the suggested remedies and any judgment other than a judgment affecting the disposition of the Letter of Consistency would only affect future situations.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed Richardsonâ€™s claim as moot.Â  See In re Chance, 277 S.C. 161, 161, 284 S.E.2d 231, 231 (1981) (recognizing South Carolina appellate courts have â€œconsistently refrainedâ€ from issuing purely advisory opinions).Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPublic Importance Exception to Mootness Doctrine \r\nIn the alternative, Richardson alleges that if his claim is deemed moot, the trial court erred in failing to apply the â€œpublic importanceâ€ exception to the mootness doctrine.Â  We disagree. \r\nUnder the â€œpublic importanceâ€ exception to the mootness doctrine an â€œappellate\r\ncourt may decide questions of imperative and manifest urgency to establish a rule for future conduct in matters of important public interest.â€Â  Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 568, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596 (2001).Â  â€œThe determination whether a particular suit raises â€˜questions of imperative and manifest urgencyâ€™\r\nmust be decided on an individual basis.â€Â  Sloan v. Greenville County, 361 S.C. 568, 570-71, 606 S.E.2d 464, 466 (2004) (quoting Curtis, 345 S.C. at 568, 549 S.E.2d at 596).Â  Generally, the â€œpublic importanceâ€ exception is applied in a â€œlimited nature.â€Â  Sloan, 361 S.C. at 571, 606 S.E.2d at 466.\r\nÂ This case does not fall under the â€œpublic importanceâ€ exception because there is no imperative or manifest urgency in ordering compliance with FOIA or ordering the Council to revise the notice procedures.Â  Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that the alleged vagueness of the meeting notices was a recurring problem.Â  The question of the vagueness of the notice is subject to repetition, but will not usually become moot before it can be reviewed.Â  Thus, whenever the Council commits a violation of FOIA in the future, a citizen may then bring an action to remedy the specific injury caused by the violation.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to apply the â€œpublic importanceâ€ exception to the mootness doctrine in this case. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not err in dismissing Richardsonâ€™s claim as moot.Â  The decision of the trial court is accordingly\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We note Richardsonâ€™s admission may be in error.Â  The Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling in SRRI may only limit DHECâ€™s reliance on a countyâ€™s Letter of Consistency and may not dispel DHECâ€™s consideration of such letters.Â  However, we make no determination of SRRIâ€™s effect on Letters of Consistency because we find the issue is not preserved.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-264","title":"MIT v.

Fred Kuhn, Jr., of Beaufort, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  MIT, Inc., appeals the special refereeâ€™s finding that MIT failed to prove damages in its claim against Collins Entertainment (aka Collins Music Company) under the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA).Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe South Carolina video poker gaming industry was initiated on July 1, 1993, when the South Carolina Video Game Machines Act went into effect.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2770 (Supp. 1998).Â  At that time and for all times relevant to this case, IGT was the preeminent manufacturer of video poker gaming machines, and Collins Entertainment was IGTâ€™s exclusive distributor in South Carolina.Â Â  \r\nIn April of 1993, Oscar Tysinger purchased ten IGT Playerâ€™s Choice machines for $62,947.50 from Fred Collins, salesperson for Collins Entertainment.Â  Around May of 1993, Tysinger formed MIT with Walter McGee and Henry Ingram. Â MIT operated and owned video poker machines in various locations throughout South Carolina.Â  All tolled, at the time of formation, MIT owned approximately thirty Playerâ€™s Choice machines (McGee owned twenty machines prior to formation).Â  MIT acquired additional used Playerâ€™s Choice machines from both Collins and others over time.Â  The trial court found MIT paid a total of $200,000 for the machines.Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn January 23, 1995, the South Carolina Supreme Court declared that video gaming machines with rolling screens that randomly stopped and awarded the player additional games based on winning combinations of words were slot machines and, thus, illegal in South Carolina.Â  State v. Four Video Slot Machines, 317 S.C. 397, 400, 453 S.E.2d 896, 898 (1995).Â  The decision rendered operation of the Playerâ€™s Choice machines illegal because the machines contained two rolling slot games.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision, Tysinger asked Collins to remove the prohibited games from the machines.Â  Collins eventually provided Tysinger with a microchip that stopped the rolling games.Â  However, the microchip had a â€œglitchâ€:Â  the microchip not only stopped the rolling games, but also stopped one of the three card games originally on the machine, reduced the payout schedule, and caused the machine to misrepresent the payouts.Â  As a result of Collinsâ€™ alterations, the percentage pay table on the machines was reduced from ninety-six percent or ninety-eight percent to ninety-two percent, causing the machines to retain approximately three times as much of the playerâ€™s money.Â  Collins allegedly requested the ninety-two percent pay table change, and the requested change was confirmed by IGT.Â Â  In time, Collins fixed the machines so the original three card games could be played; however, Collins did not correct the reductions to the payout schedule.Â  The changes to the machinesâ€™ payout schedules allegedly reduced MITâ€™s profits because players were less willing to play machines with reduced odds for winning.Â  \r\nAfter receiving numerous complaints from customers, Tysinger asked Collins for a program that would take the illegal rolling games off but leave everything else exactly as it was.Â  Collins informed Tysinger that IGT had â€œhis hands tied.â€Â  IGT informed Tysinger they could supply such a program, but any order must come from Collins with a detailed explanation of the desired objectives.Â  Tysinger asked Collins to order the curative program from IGT, but Collins failed to provide any curative microchip.Â Â  \r\nMIT commenced this action on December 16, 1996, alleging conduct by IGT and Collins Entertainment violated the UTPA and an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.Â  All claims against IGT were dismissed.Â  Collins filed a motion for summary judgment on both causes of action.Â  By order dated June 6, 2003, the trial court granted Collinsâ€™ Motion for Summary Judgment on the breach of implied warranty claim but found that there was a sufficient question for the fact finder on the UTPA claim.Â  By order dated August 20, 2004, the trial court found Collins violated the UPTA but MIT failed to prove damages.Â  MIT appeals the trial courtâ€™s finding of no damages and its failure to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn an action at law, tried without a jury, the appellate court standard of review extends only to the correction of errors of law.â€Â \r\nOkatie River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern Site Prep., L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d 468, 472 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc., 338 S.C. 572, 580-81, 527 S.E.2d 371, 375 (Ct. App. 2000), affâ€™d as modified, 343 S.C. 587, 541 S.E.2d 257 (2001).Â  â€œThe judgeâ€™s findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action,â€ whether the findings are made with or without a reference.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDamages \r\nMIT contends the trial court erred in finding MIT failed to prove damages proximately caused by Collinsâ€™ conduct.Â  MIT asserts it suffered a property loss valued at $200,000 due to Collins Entertainmentâ€™s UTPA violation.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nâ€œ[T]o recover pursuant to the UTPA one must prove each of the following three elements by the greater weight or preponderance of the evidence: 1) a violation of the Act, 2) proximate cause, and 3) damages.â€Â \r\nCharleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 318 S.C. 471, 482, 458 S.E.2d 431, 438 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Section 39-5-140(a) of the South Carolina Code (1985) provides:Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 may bring an action individually, but not in a representative capacity, to recover actual damages.Â  If the court finds that the use or employment of the unfair or deceptive method, act or practice was a willful or knowing violation of Â§ 39-5-20, the court shall award three times the actual damages sustained and may provide such other relief as it deems necessary or proper.Â  Upon the finding by the court of a violation of this article, the court shall award to the person bringing such action under this section reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.\r\n\r\nThe only issue relevant to this appeal is whether MIT proved Collins Entertainmentâ€™s conduct proximately caused MIT to suffer damages cognizable under the UTPA.Â  MIT argues they suffered an ascertainable loss of $200,000, the purchase price of the Playerâ€™s Choice machines, because Collins Entertainmentâ€™s conduct rendered the machines worthless.Â  The contention that the machines were valueless is based on Collinsâ€™ testimony, which reads as follows:Â  \r\n\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  If Mr. Tysinger comes to you and says â€œMr. Fred, Iâ€™ve got these twenty IGT Playerâ€™s Choice machines you sold me, I need to get them out of my way, what will you give me for them, what would they be worth?â€\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  To me?\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Uh-huh (Affirmative response).\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  I wouldnâ€™t pay him anything.Â  I might haul them away for him but I wouldnâ€™t pay him anything because I canâ€™t use them.Â  I canâ€™t sell them.Â  I canâ€™t operate them.Â  \r\n\r\nThe special referee interpreted Collinsâ€™ testimony as referring â€œto the value of the machines as of March 26, 1999, and not at the time MIT purchased the machines,â€ and found the record indicated MITâ€™s machines were not valueless.Â  The referee also found the true measure of damages was lost profits.Â  \r\nWe agree with the special refereeâ€™s conclusion that the machines were not valueless.Â  Collinsâ€™ statement can reasonably be interpreted as referring to the value of the Playerâ€™s Choice machines at the time the question was asked.Â  Collins was questioned in 1999 and was not asked to estimate the value of the machines at an earlier date.[1]Â  Moreover, the record indicates the machines clearly had some value after Collins altered the pay table.Â  In fact, MIT was able to make a considerable profit from several Playerâ€™s Choice machines in 1997, about two years after Collinsâ€™ initial alterations.Â  Five machines supplied and owned by MIT earned a net profit of $88,281.75 during the quarter ending June 30, 1997; a net profit of $57,391.69 during the quarter ending September 30, 1997; and a net profit of $65,694.66 during the quarter ending December 31, 1997.Â  Thus, at least some of MITâ€™s Playerâ€™s Choice machines remained in operation despite the â€œglitchâ€ and were quite profitable.Â Â Â  \r\nThe record also indicates that despite MITâ€™s complaint regarding the payout schedule, MIT continued to use the Playerâ€™s Choice machines.Â  MIT did not replace them with better machines until the licenses for the Playerâ€™s Choice machines ran out.Â  This evidence supports a finding that the machines were not valueless; a reasonable business person would not continue to use a valueless product until the license ran out but would rather replace or discard the product immediately.Â  \r\nFurther, we agree with the special refereeâ€™s finding that the most appropriate method for calculating damages in this action was demonstrating a difference in profits between the original Playerâ€™s Choice machines and the machines as altered.Â  MITâ€™s UTPA claim is based on Collins Entertainmentâ€™s tampering with the payout schedule on the machines.Â  Thus, the true measure of damages is the lost profits suffered by the reduction in play based on the lowered pay tables.Â  Indeed, Tysinger admitted he was trying to prove the damages suffered in the form of the difference in profits â€œfrom the time [the machines] got malfunctioned.â€Â  However, in a response to an interrogatory sent to MIT by Collins, MIT waived damages beyond the purchase price because they were â€œunable to articulate a lost income figure.â€Â  MIT also specified at oral argument before this court that it was waiving all claims of lost profits.Â  \r\nThere was evidence in this case to support the special refereeâ€™s findings that MITâ€™s Playerâ€™s Choice machines were not without value after receiving Collinsâ€™ chip and that the true measure of damages in this case was lost profits.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the refereeâ€™s finding that MIT failed to prove the element of actual damages because MIT failed to prove how Collinsâ€™ conduct reduced the value of the Playerâ€™s Choice machines.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAttorneyâ€™s Fees \r\nMIT argues the trial court erred in failing to award attorneyâ€™s fees despite finding Collinsâ€™ conduct violated the UTPA.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThis issue is not preserved for review.Â  â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  An issue is not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant does not move to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 502, 597 S.E.2d 897, 899 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œIn other words, the trial court must be given an opportunity to resolve the issue before it is presented to the appellate court.â€Â \r\nIn re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004).Â  The trial court did not address the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees in its order, and no Rule 59(e) motion was filed by MIT; thus, this issue is not preserved for review.Â  \r\nOn the merits, MIT is not entitled to an award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Section 39-5-140(a) provides: â€œUpon the finding by the court of a violation of [the UTPA], the court shall award to the person bringing such action under this section reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140(a) (1985)(emphasis added).Â  A person who â€œmay bring an action . . . to recover actual damagesâ€ under section 39-5-140(a) is â€œ[a]ny person who suffers an ascertainable lossâ€ as a result of an UTPA violation.Â  MIT failed to prove any ascertainable loss and, thus, does not qualify as a person bringing an action under this article.Â  Therefore, MIT is not entitled to an award of attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the record supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that MIT failed to prove the element of damages.Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Even if Collinsâ€™ testimony refers to the value of the Playerâ€™s Choice machines immediately after Collinsâ€™ alterations, his opinion is not dispositive.Â  Simply because the machines had no value to Collins does not necessarily mean they were valueless to all.Â  Considering Collins owned a large quantity of Playerâ€™s Choice machines and that Playerâ€™s Choice machines were â€œno longer being playedâ€ partly because Pot Oâ€™ Gold, a new machine, â€œput them out of business,â€ it is easy to understand why Collins would opine that the Playerâ€™s Choice machines were valueless to him.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-265","title":"Brown v.

Scarborough, Master-In-Equity\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nG. Thomas Hill of Ravenel, for Appellants.\r\nRobert H. Mozingo, Timothy A. Domin amd Michael B. McCall, all of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this appeal, Appellants contend the Master-in-Equity erred in finding that they do not possess a prescriptive easement over the property which is the subject of this appeal.Â  We affirm.[1]Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe real property which is the subject of this action is located in Charleston County, and consists of a parcel of land formerly owned and utilized by various railroad companies as a bed for their tracts. The subject property runs through various parcels of land owned by numerous individuals including the properties of the heirs of Louis Brown (Brown Heirs) and the heirs of Robert Lowry (Lowry Heirs). Sometime prior to October 1992, the railroad tracks were removed and the use of the property for the operation of a railroad was discontinued. Jessie Brown (Brown) contacted CSX Transportation, Inc., the owner of the property, and inquired about purchasing the land. In October of 1992, CSX executed and delivered to Brown a quitclaim deed to the subject property.Â Â  \r\nBrown commenced this action in April 2002, to establish that he holds fee simple absolute title to the property.Â  Both the Brown Heirs and the Lowry Heirs filed Answers, Counterclaims and Cross Claims.Â  The Brown Heirs contended CSX did not have the authority to transfer the property to Brown based on the deed from Louis Brown to CSXâ€™s predecessor and that title to the property reverted to them upon CSXâ€™s discontinuance of its use for tract purposes.Â  The Lowry Heirs contended they possess ingress/egress rights over the property by virtue of a prescriptive easement.Â  Â Â \r\nThe case was referred to the Master-in-Equity. The master ruled the Brown Heirs and the Lowry Heirs did not possess ownership rights nor did they have an easement by prescription over the abandoned railroad-bed claimed by Brown.Â  Furthermore, the master held Brown owns the subject property in fee simple by virtue of the quit-claim deed from CSX, and that the Brown Heirs and Lowry Heirs have no right to use the subject property. The Lowry Heirs filed a Notice of Appeal regarding the issue of prescriptive easement.Â  The Brown Heirs appealed the issue of a potential reverter, which was dismissed by this court. Therefore, only the Lowry Heirsâ€™ (hereinafter â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal is before us.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of the existence of an easement is an action at law. Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 410, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998); Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 331 S.C. 398, 416, 503 S.E.2d 191, 200 (Ct. App. 1998). Establishing the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law action. Jowers v. Hornsby, 292 S.C. 549, 551, 357 S.E.2d 710, 711 (1987). Accordingly, our scope of review is limited to correction of errors of law, and we will not disturb the masterâ€™s factual findings that have some evidentiary support. Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend they possess an easement by prescription over the subject property.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn order to establish an easement by prescription a party must show: (1) the continued and uninterrupted use or enjoyment of a right for a full period of twenty years; (2) the identity of the thing enjoyed; and (3) that the use or enjoyment was adverse or under claim of right. Horry County v. Laychur, 315 S.C. 364, 367, 434 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1993); Babb v. Harrison, 220 S.C. 20, 24-25, 66 S.E.2d 457, 458 (1951); Hartley v. John Wesley United Methodist Church of Johns Island, 355 S.C. 145, 150, 584 S.E.2d 386, 388 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The party claiming a prescriptive easement has the burden of proving all elements. Morrow v. Dyches, 328 S.C. 522, 527, 492 S.E.2d 420, 423 (Ct. App. 1997); Babb v. Harrison, at 20, 66 S.E.2d at 458 (stating that the claimant â€œcarries with her the burden of proving that the use of such disputed area was adverse for the full period of twenty years in order to establish an easement by prescription.â€). \r\nAppellants fall short of establishing a prescriptive easement.Â  The evidence offered by Appellants does not establish the requisite twenty year continuous use.Â  None of the witnesses were able to state with any certainty when the railroad ceased operation, nor did any witness offer direct testimony establishing the length of time the railbed had been used by them to access their property. In fact, testimony supported the opposite conclusion.Â  \r\nOne of the Lowry descendants stated he did not know how long he had used the road to get back to the river to fish, but estimated â€œover ten years.â€Â  Furthermore, one of the Brown descendants testified that the tracts had been removed and the railbed was overgrown when he returned from New York in 1981.Â  He further testified that when he returned in 1981, no one was using the railbed to access their properties except Jessie Brown.Â Â  \r\nThere was no clear evidence presented that showed continuous use of the property for twenty years.Â  At best, the testimony presented supports sporadic use for access to hunt, crab or fish for an unknown time frame.Â Â  Further, any use by Appellants was interrupted.Â  An attempt to prevent others from crossing the property constitutes an interruption, however brief, in the use and enjoyment of that property to prevent acquisition of an easement by prescription.Â  See Pittman v. Lowther, 355 S.C. 536, 540, 586 S.E.2d 149, 151-52 (Ct. App. 2003).Â Â  The testimony showed Jessie Brown erected a chain across the roadway to create such an interruption.Â  \r\nNot only did Appellants fail to establish a twenty year uninterrupted and continuous use of the property, they have also failed to establish the use was adverse or under a claim of right.Â  The testimony did not point to a claim that the Lowry Heirs had title to the railbed; rather, the testimony was that the railbed was the way â€œwe used to get access.â€Â  Further, there was no claim that Appellantsâ€™ use of the property was adverse to Brown. â€œEvidence establishing the mere fact of use does not necessarily equate with the evidence establishing the character of such use.â€Â  Morrow, 328 S.C. at 527, 492 S.E.2d at 424.Â  \r\nAppellants have failed to meet their burden of proof in establishing the elements of an easement by prescription.Â  Because the masterâ€™s findings of fact have evidentiary support, we affirm his finding that no prescriptive easement exists.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the masterâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-266","title":"Altman v.

We reverse.[1] Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nGriffith and Bart Altman have never been married, but have a son born May 27, 1999. Â On December 6, 2004, Altman was awarded custody of their son, and Griffith was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $45.46 plus five percent to be paid weekly through the clerk of the family court commencing on the first Friday after the Final Order was signed.Â Â  \r\nGriffith attempted to pay child support through the clerkâ€™s office, only to be told that the clerk was â€œunable to identify reason, our docket number or any other information as to why this check was forwarded to our court.â€Â Â Â  Griffithâ€™s first payment was returned to her by the clerk. Â Â Pursuant to advice from her attorney, Griffith made the next two payments directly to Altman, who cashed the checks. \r\nOn January 28, 2005, the clerk issued a rule to show cause directing Griffith to appear on March 9, 2005, and show cause why she should not be held in contempt of court for failing to pay $238.65 in child support payments that had become due. The sheriffâ€™s affidavit of service shows Griffith was not served with the rule to show cause until February 22, 2005. On February 23, 2005, Griffith sent a letter to the clerk explaining why she had not made the first payment, which was due on December 10, 2004, and enclosed the payment. Griffith also noted in this letter that her attorney was in contact with the clerkâ€™s office regarding proper crediting of her previous payments. Photocopies of money orders presented to the clerk at that time established that the only payments Griffith had not made were the first payment (which had been paid at the time of the contempt hearing) and the two payments she made directly to Altman.\r\nAt the contempt hearing, Altman acknowledged accepting these two payments but stated that they were â€œfor another debt that she owed me,â€ which he claimed Griffith was required to pay him under the terms of the Final Order. Griffith testified she did not owe Altman any money. No evidence was offered by Altman that the two payments he accepted from Griffith, which substantially coincided with the due dates and amounts of the child support obligations, were to reimburse him for any monies Griffith owed him under the terms of the final order.[2] Â Â \r\nThe family court found Griffith in contempt of court and sentenced her to ninety days in jail, which could be purged by paying the two payments to the clerk, plus paying $150 in court costs, and paying Altman twenty-five dollars for time lost from work. Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, an appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  A finding of contempt\r\nrests within the sound discretion of the trial court and results from willful disobedience of a court order. Â Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1989). Â â€œA trial courtâ€™s determination regarding contempt is subject to reversal where it is based on findings that are without evidentiary support or where there has been an abuse of discretion.â€\r\nHenderson v. Puckett, 316 S.C. 171, 173, 447 S.E.2d 871, 872 (Ct. App. 1994). â€œEven though a party is found to have violated a court order, the question of whether or not to impose sanctions remains a matter for the courtâ€™s discretion.â€ Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 503, 597 S.E.2d 897, 900 (Ct. App. 2004). â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs either when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order,\r\nbased upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.â€ Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGriffith contends the family court erred in finding her in contempt for failing to pay child support through the clerkâ€™s office where there was no evidence she had willfully violated the court order.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to preservation of order in judicial proceedings.â€ In re Brown, 333 S.C. 414, 420, 511 S.E.2d 351, 355 (1998). Â Contempt results from a partyâ€™s willful disobedience of a court order. Â Smith v. Smith, 359 S.C. 393, 396, 597 S.E.2d 188, 189 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. 2004) (stating that a party may be found in contempt of court for the willful violation of a lawful court order). A willful act is one which is â€œâ€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires\r\nto be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™â€ Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988)). â€œ[B]efore a court may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€ Widman, 348 S.C. at 119, 557 S.E.2d at 705.\r\nâ€œIn a proceeding for contempt for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of a court order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance with the order.â€ Â Hawkins, 359 S.C. at 501, 597 S.E.2d at 899. Â â€œOnce the moving party has made out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his or her defense and inability to comply with the order.â€ Â Widman, 348 S.C. at 120, 557 S.E.2d at 705.Â  Furthermore, it is generally recognized that where a contemnor is unable, without fault on his part, to obey an order of the court, he is not to be held in contempt.Â  Hicks v. Hicks, 280 S.C. 378, 381, 312 S.E.2d 598, 599 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\nThe evidence was undisputed that Griffith was unable, without fault on her part, to make these child support payments through the clerk of courtâ€™s office at the time they were due, and on the advice of her counsel, she made them directly to Altman.Â  The evidence also shows that these payments were made as child support, notwithstanding Altmanâ€™s statement that Griffith owed him money under the Final Order and that he â€œaccepted the money on that behalf.â€Â  The likelihood that the two payments Griffith made Â substantially in the amounts due and on the dates when the payments were due, were for anything other than child support is simply not supported by the evidence. \r\nThe family court abused its discretion in finding Griffith in contempt where there was no evidence she had willfully violated the court order to pay child support.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, JJ., AND CURETON, A.J., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.&nbsp;\r\n[2] The Final Order was not presented to the trial court.Â  Moreover, Altman never identified what provision of the order requires Griffith to pay him the sums he claims Griffith owed him.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-267","title":"Barnum v.
