Howle, Sally Howle Ritchie, Mirian Howle, Ken Howle, and Sally Howle\r\n  Ritchie, as personal representative of the estate of Cleonita W. Howle allege\r\n  the trial court erred in: (1) finding Leslie Howle did not assume the mortgage on\r\n  the Beach House and Plaintiffs were not entitled to have the mortgage\r\n  reinstated and assigned to Plaintiffs; (2) finding the assumption was invalid\r\n  because Carolina Bank had no knowledge of any type of assumption; (3) finding\r\n  Darlington Fuel Company, Inc. was a necessary party to the action; (4) finding Plaintiffs\r\n  were not entitled to judgment against Leslie Howle based on breach of contract;\r\n  (5) finding the statute of limitations prohibited their breach of contract\r\n  claim; and (6) allowing Leslie Howle to present evidence of setoff and payment\r\n  although such was not pled in her counterclaim.Â  Leslie Howle cross appeals\r\n  arguing the trial court erred in finding she was not entitled to an award based\r\n  upon diminution in property value of the Beach House due to Phillip Howle's\r\n  filing of a lis pendens. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities.Â  \r\n1.Â  As\r\n  to whether the trial court erred in (1) finding Leslie Howle did not assume the\r\n  mortgage on the Beach House and Plaintiffs were not entitled to have the\r\n  mortgage reinstated and assigned to Plaintiffs; (2) finding the assumption was\r\n  invalid because Carolina Bank had no knowledge of any type of assumption; and (3)\r\n  finding Darlington Fuel Company, Inc. was a necessary party to the action, we\r\n  find these issues are abandoned.Â  See State v. Jones, 344 S.C.\r\n  48, 58-59, 543 S.E.2d 541, 546 (2001) (finding an issue is deemed abandoned and\r\n  will not be considered on appeal if the argument is raised in a brief but not\r\n  supported by authority).Â  Â Â \r\n2.Â  We\r\n  hold the trial court did not err in finding Philip Howle's breach of contract\r\n  claim was barred by the statute of limitations pursuant to: S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-3-530 (2005) (providing a party must commence an action within three years\r\n  of the date the cause of action arises); Martin v. Companion Healthcare\r\n    Corp., 357 S.C. 570, 575, 593 S.E.2d 624, 627 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding the\r\n  three-year statute of limitations &quot;begins to run when the underlying cause\r\n  of action reasonably ought to have been discovered&quot;).Â  \r\n3.Â  We\r\n  find Philip Howle's argument that the trial court erred in relying on a three-year\r\n  statute of limitations pursuant to section 15-3-530 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2005) is not preserved for review. Â See In re Michael H., 360\r\n  S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (&quot;An issue may not be raised for\r\n  the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal, it must be\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.&quot;).Â  \r\n4.Â  We\r\n  find Philip Howle's argument that the trial court erred to the extent its order\r\n  was based on evidence of setoff and payment presented at trial is not preserved\r\n  for our review because the trial court did not make a final ruling on this\r\n  issue. Â See S.C. Dept. of Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C.,\r\n  372 S.C. 295, 301, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007) (holding that in order for an\r\n  issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the trial judge).Â  \r\n5.Â  We\r\n  find Leslie Howle's cross appeal is not preserved for review.Â  See Noisette\r\n    v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding that when a\r\n  trial court makes a general ruling on an issue, but does not address the\r\n  specific argument raised by the appellant and the appellant does not make a\r\n  motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to obtain a ruling on\r\n  the argument, the appellate court cannot consider the argument on appeal).Â  Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-259","title":"State v.

Windell McCrackin, of Myrtle Beach, for Appellant.\r\n        Elaine Helms, of Lancaster, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Linda\r\n  Cowart (Cowart) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s determination Elaine Helms is\r\n  entitled to the benefits of William Cowartâ€™s life insurance policy (the\r\n  Policy).&nbsp; We affirm. [1]\r\nOmaha Life Insurance (Omaha) issued William B. Cowart (decedent)\r\n  the Policy in the amount of $30,000.&nbsp; Decedent was the named\r\n  applicant.&nbsp; Originally, Cowart, decedentâ€™s wife, was the named beneficiary\r\n  under the Policy.&nbsp; However, decedent later executed a change of beneficiary form, naming Helms, his sister, the\r\n  beneficiary.&nbsp; Following decedentâ€™s death, Omaha filed an interpleader action, requesting permission to deposit the &nbsp;proceeds from the Policy with the Horry County\r\n  clerk of court.&nbsp; After a hearing, the circuit court determined decedent, as owner of the Policy, executed a proper change of\r\n  beneficiary and Helms is entitled to the Policy proceeds. We find the circuit\r\n  court properly determined from the Policy language decedent was the owner of\r\n  the Policy and Helms is entitled to the Policy proceeds.&nbsp; \r\nInsurance\r\n  policies are subject to general rules of contract construction and courts must\r\n  enforce, not write, contracts of insurance and must give policy language its\r\n  plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.&nbsp; Fritz-Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick v. Goforth, 312 S.C. 315, 318, 440 S.E.2d 367,\r\n  369&nbsp;(1994) â€œ[T]he terms of an insurance policy must be construed most\r\n  liberally in favor of the insured and where the words of a policy are ambiguous\r\n  or where they are capable of two reasonable interpretations that construction\r\n  will be adopted which is most favorable to the insured.â€&nbsp; Garrett v. Pilot Life Ins. Co., 241 S.C. 299, 304, 128\r\n  S.E.2d 171, 174&nbsp;(1962).&nbsp; &nbsp;The right to change the\r\n  beneficiary may be reserved by the language of the policy itself.&nbsp; Waters\r\n    v. S. Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co., 365 S.C. 519, 523-24, 617 S.E.2d 385,\r\n  387-88&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) \r\nCowart\r\n  argues she is the owner of the Policy, and therefore, decedentâ€™s change of\r\n  beneficiary form is invalid, making her entitled to the Policy proceeds.&nbsp;\r\n  The Policy defines â€œownerâ€ as â€œ(a) the Insured, (b) the applicant if a person\r\n  other than the Insured applied for this policy, or (c) the assignee of record\r\n  in the case of an assignment of ownership.â€[2]&nbsp; The Policy language itself reserves\r\n  the right of the insured to change the beneficiary.&nbsp; The beneficiary under\r\n  the Policy named in the application â€œmay be changed as describedâ€ in the Policy\r\n  unless the owner states it is irrevocable.&nbsp; A change in beneficiary under\r\n  the Policy must be made in writing and is effective the date the owner signs\r\n  the request once it is â€œrecorded and acknowledged by [Omaha.]â€&nbsp; \r\nHere, decedent is both the insured and the applicant on the Policy.&nbsp;\r\n  Additionally, his signature appears on the application form.&nbsp; Furthermore,\r\n  the change of beneficiary form bears decedentâ€™s signature as the Policy\r\n  owner.&nbsp; As owner of the Policy, decedent executed a proper change of\r\n  beneficiary form which effectively changed the beneficiary from Cowart to\r\n  Helms.&nbsp; Consequently, at the time of decedentâ€™s death, Helms was the\r\n  recorded beneficiary.&nbsp; Therefore, the circuit court did not err in determining\r\n  decedent was the owner of the Policy and in finding Helms, not Cowart, was\r\n  entitled to Policyâ€™s benefits.&nbsp; \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Cowart does not argue there was an assignment of\r\n  ownership. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-262","title":"State v.

Graham was convicted of distribution of crack\r\n  cocaine at trial on May 29, 2003 (first trial).Â  Graham was convicted on a\r\n  second charge of distribution of crack cocaine at trial on June 25, 2003 (second\r\n  trial).Â  Graham did not appeal either conviction or sentence.Â  Graham filed an\r\n  application for post-conviction relief (PCR) alleging ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel at both trials.[1]Â \r\n  The PCR court found trial counsel was ineffective in Graham's first trial and\r\n  granted a new trial.Â  The PCR court denied Graham's application for PCR as to\r\n  his second trial, but found trial counsel's deficient performance in the first\r\n  trial influenced the sentencing phase of Graham's second trial and granted a\r\n  new sentencing hearing.Â  \r\nGraham seeks a writ of certiorari from the denial of his application\r\n  for PCR as to his second trial (Question I) and from the grant of a belated\r\n  appeal (Question II).Â  The State cross-petitions seeking a writ of certiorari\r\n  from the PCR court's grant of a new trial for Graham's first trial, and a new\r\n  sentencing hearing for his second trial (State's Petition).\r\nBecause evidence\r\n  supports the PCR court's finding that Graham did not knowingly and\r\n  intelligently waive his right to a direct appeal, we grant certiorari on\r\n  Graham's Question II and proceed with a review of the direct appeal issues\r\n  pursuant to Davis v. State, 288 S.C. 290, 342 S.E.2d 60 (1986) and White v. State,\r\n  263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).Â  We deny the petition for certiorari as to\r\n  Graham's Question I and as to the State's Petition. Â Â \r\nAs to\r\n  Graham's direct appeal issues, we affirm[2] pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: Humbert v.\r\n    State, 345 S.C. 332, 337-38, 548 S.E.2d 862, 865&nbsp;(2001) (finding a\r\n  &quot;defendant's appearance at trial dressed in jail clothing is not automatically\r\n  reversible error&quot;);Â  Id. at 337-38 n.4, 548 S.E.2d at 865&nbsp;n.4\r\n  (&quot;[I]n order to obtain a new trial on direct appeal, an objection must be\r\n  raised at trial.&quot;); State v.

Parker Barnes, Jr., of Beaufort, Charles E. Carpenter, Jr. and\r\n  Steven J. Pugh, both of Columbia, for Appellant/Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tLouis S. Moore, of College Park, R. Bentz KirbyÂ  and Glenn\r\n  Walters, both of Orangeburg, for Respondents/Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this civil case, we must\r\n  determine whether the trial court erred in denying South Carolina Electric and\r\n  Gas Company's (SCE&amp;G) motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict\r\n  (JNOV) and motion for a new trial absolute.Â  Additionally, Bobby and Clara Holland\r\n  (collectively the Hollands) appeal the trial court's decision to reduce the\r\n  punitive damages award from approximately $300,000 to $50,000.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2001, the Hollands were developing a parcel of land at St.\r\n  Helena Island in Beaufort County to build their retirement home and develop a\r\n  subdivision for sale to third parties.Â  The Hollands employed Beaufort\r\n  Engineering Corporation to do the engineering work, Joe Pizzo and his company\r\n  JOCO Construction to install the water system and waterline, and SCE&amp;G to\r\n  install the electrical system.Â  \r\nAccording to Mr. Holland, he showed SCE&amp;G the approximate\r\n  location of the waterline Pizzo installed.Â  Subsequently, SCE&amp;G installed\r\n  the power lines and by its own admission, cut the waterline in two places.Â \r\n  According to Pizzo, SCE&amp;G also cut the waterline in a third place.Â \r\n  SCE&amp;G failed to notify Pizzo or the Hollands of the cuts.Â  \r\nFollowing the waterline being cut, Pizzo was preparing the\r\n  waterline for inspection and acceptance by Beaufort Jasper Water and Sewer\r\n  Authority (BJWSA).Â  During this process, Pizzo became aware of the cuts and\r\n  offered to repair them.Â  Rather than accept this offer, SCE&amp;G employed its\r\n  crew to do the repairs.Â  Despite the repairs, the waterline failed a pressure\r\n  test.Â  Consequently, BJWSA did not accept the waterline, and as a result, the\r\n  Hollands were unable to obtain clean running water to their home and the\r\n  subdivision.Â  \r\nPizzo informed the Hollands SCE&amp;G's repairs were improper.Â \r\n  Pizzo proceeded to make the necessary repairs to the waterline, and in so\r\n  doing, he discovered a third cut in the waterline.Â  Subsequent to his repairs,\r\n  Pizzo conducted a pressure test without the aid of BJWSA and concluded the\r\n  waterline held the requisite amount of pressure to be accepted by BJWSA.Â  Pizzo\r\n  submitted a bill to SCE&amp;G for the repair work.Â  Initially, SCE&amp;G\r\n  communicated to Pizzo it would pay the bill in full; this amount was later\r\n  reduced to one-half, then reduced again to one-third, and no payment was ever made.Â \r\n  Pizzo refused to certify the line to BJWSA's approval because neither SCE&amp;G\r\n  nor the Hollands would pay him for the repairs he had made.\r\nAs a result, the Hollands were unable to secure clean running\r\n  water to their house and were forced to dig a well in order to obtain running\r\n  water.Â  This had an impact on the Hollands' personal life.Â  The couple's\r\n  disabled son had a tube in his stomach that prohibited the Hollands from\r\n  bathing him with the contaminated well water.Â  Additionally, Mr. Holland\r\n  testified the well water was the worst well water he had ever seen.Â  According\r\n  to Mr. Holland, the water would stain his house and the couple's possessions in\r\n  the house.Â  \r\nThe Hollands filed suit against SCE&amp;G.Â  The Hollands claimed\r\n  damages in excess of $300,000 for lost sales in the subdivision, dead palmetto\r\n  trees, the cost to connect the well to supply water to their home, damage to\r\n  their home and appliances as a result of the well water, and the cost to\r\n  install a well to a sold lot in the subdivision.Â  \r\nAfter the trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the\r\n  Hollands for $162,630.Â  The jury found the Hollands 18.75% negligent, and their\r\n  damages were reduced to $132,136.87.Â  The jury also awarded the Hollands\r\n  $314,583 in punitive damages.Â  SCE&amp;G filed post trial motions for JNOV, a\r\n  new trial absolute, a new trial nisi remittitur based on the\r\n  jury's award of actual damages, and a new trial nisi remittitur based on the jury's award of punitive damages.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  motions for JNOV and a new trial absolute but granted the motion for a new\r\n  trial nisi remittitur based on the award of punitive damages.Â \r\n  Consequently, the trial court reduced the amount of punitive damages to\r\n  $50,000.Â  The Hollands and SCE&amp;G have appealed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSCE&amp;G argues the trial court erred in failing to\r\n  grant its motion for JNOV on the grounds the Hollands (1) failed to mitigate\r\n  their damages; (2) failed to prove SCE&amp;G damaged their waterline; (3) were\r\n  not legally entitled to install or operate the waterline; and (4) were not\r\n  entitled to punitive damages.Â  In the alternative, SCE&amp;G appeals the trial\r\n  court's denial of its motion for a new trial absolute and asks this court to\r\n  reverse the judgment and/or remand the case for a new trial.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  Hollands appeal the trial court's decision to reduce the punitive damages from\r\n  approximately $300,000 to $50,000.Â  We address each argument in turn. \r\nI.\r\n  SCE&amp;G's AppealÂ Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  SCE&amp;G argues it was entitled to JNOV or a new trial nisi remittitur based on the jury's award of\r\n  actual damages because the Hollands could\r\n  have mitigated their damages by paying Pizzo to have the waterline certified.Â \r\n  We disagree. \r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for JNOV, this court must\r\n  employ the same standard as the trial court, by viewing the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Welch\r\n    v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 299-300, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418-19 (Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\n  The trial court must deny a JNOV motion when the evidence yields more than one\r\n  inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Id.Â  An appellate court will\r\n  reverse the trial court only when no evidence supports the ruling below.Â  Id.Â \r\n  When considering a JNOV motion, neither the trial court nor the appellate court\r\n  has the authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the\r\n  testimony or evidence.Â  Id.Â  A motion for JNOV may be granted only if no reasonable jury\r\n  could have reached the challenged verdict.Â  Id.Â  The jury's verdict will\r\n  be affirmed if any evidence exists that sustains the factual findings implicit\r\n  in its decision.Â  Id.\r\nA party injured by the acts of another is required to do those\r\n  things a person of ordinary prudence would do under the circumstances to\r\n  mitigate his damages, but the law does not require him to exert himself\r\n  unreasonably or incur substantial expense to avoid damages.Â  McClary v.\r\n    Massey Ferguson, Inc., 291 S.C. 506, 510-11, 354 S.E.2d 405, 407-08 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1987).Â  Moreover, the reasonableness of actions to mitigate damages is\r\n  ordinarily a question for the jury.Â  Id.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we note the Hollands had paid Pizzo before he began installing the waterline.Â \r\n  The Hollands testified they called numerous plumbers and three sewer workers to\r\n  get the waterline approved by BJWSA.Â  However, once these individuals became\r\n  aware of the ongoing dispute between Pizzo and SCE&amp;G, they refused to get\r\n  involved.Â  Testimony was offered that showed SCE&amp;G told the Hollands not to\r\n  pay Pizzo for the repair work because SCE&amp;G described him as a &quot;money\r\n  grabber.&quot;Â  Mrs. Holland stated a SCE&amp;G representative described Pizzo\r\n  as &quot;a money grabber and all [Pizzo] wanted was money, and the kind of\r\n  money he wanted was too much for the repair.&quot;Â  While SCE&amp;G argues the\r\n  Hollands should have paid Pizzo to mitigate their damages, their own representative\r\n  told the Hollands not to pay Pizzo the price he was asking.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  jury may have considered this issue in arriving at its conclusion to hold the\r\n  Hollands 18.75% negligent.Â  Based on this, we cannot say the trial court\r\n  committed reversible error in denying SCE&amp;G's JNOV motion.Â Â  \r\nSCE&amp;G\r\n  also argues the trial court should have granted its new trial nisi remittitur motion based on the Hollands' alleged failure to mitigate their damages. Â Specifically,\r\n  SCE&amp;G contends this court should reduce the verdict to the amount the\r\n  Hollands could have paid Pizzo to have the waterline operational.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nThis court's decision in Howard v. Roberson succinctly sets\r\n  out the law regarding a new trial nisi. \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  grant or denial of new trial motions rests within the discretion of the trial\r\n  judge, and his decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings are\r\n  wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by\r\n  error of law.Â  The trial [judge] alone has the power to grant a new trial nisi when he finds the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate or excessive.Â \r\n  However, compelling reasons must be given to justify invading the jury's\r\n  province by granting a new trial nisi additur or remittitur.Â \r\n  The consideration for a motion for a new trial nisi additur or \r\n\tremittitur requires the trial judge to consider the adequacy of the verdict in light of\r\n  the evidence presented.Â  Great deference is given to the trial judge who heard\r\n  the evidence and is more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial, and\r\n  who thus possesses a better-informed view of the damages than this Court.Â  \r\n\r\n376 S.C. 143,\r\n  155-56, 654 S.E.2d 877, 883-84 (Ct. App. 2007) (internal quotations and\r\n  citations omitted).Â  Based on the testimony\r\n  described above and our applicable standard of review, we cannot say the trial\r\n  court erred in denying SCE&amp;G's new trial nisi remittitur motion.Â  \r\nNext,\r\n  SCE&amp;G contends it is entitled to JNOV because the Hollands failed to\r\n  present evidence the waterline was functional and operational prior to\r\n  SCE&amp;G's cutting it.Â  Apparently SCE&amp;G is arguing the Hollands failed to\r\n  establish SCE&amp;G's cut caused the damage to the waterline resulting in the\r\n  waterline not working properly.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, in order to recover damages, the evidence should be\r\n  such as to enable the jury to determine the amount of the damages with\r\n  reasonable certainty or accuracy.Â  Collins Entm't, Inc. v. White, 363\r\n  S.C. 546, 559, 611 S.E.2d 262, 269 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Although the existence,\r\n  causation, or amount of damages cannot be left to conjecture, guess, or\r\n  speculation, proof with mathematical certainty of the amount of loss or damage\r\n  is not required.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the time SCE&amp;G damaged the waterline, Pizzo was in the process of preparing\r\n  the line for testing in order to certify the line and obtain acceptance by\r\n  BJWSA.Â  During this time,\r\n  Pizzo became aware of two cuts to the waterline.Â  SCE&amp;G fixed these cuts;\r\n  nonetheless, the waterline failed a pressure test.Â  Consequently, BJWSA did not\r\n  accept the waterline, and as a result, the Hollands were unable to obtain clean\r\n  running water to their home.Â  Pizzo proceeded to make the necessary repairs to\r\n  the waterline, and in so doing, he discovered a third place the waterline had\r\n  been cut.Â  SCE&amp;G did not fix this cut.Â  After Pizzo completed all the\r\n  repairs, he conducted a pressure test and concluded the waterline held the\r\n  requisite amount of pressure to be accepted by BJWSA.Â  \r\nViewing the\r\n  evidence and its inferences in the light most favorable to the Hollands, it is\r\n  reasonable to infer SCE&amp;G's failure to remedy the third cut to the\r\n  waterline prevented the waterline from being certified by Pizzo and ultimately\r\n  passing the pressure test required by BJWSA.Â  As such, SCE&amp;G's cuts and its failure to fix these cuts\r\n  caused the damage to the waterline that resulted in it not working properly.Â  As\r\n  such, the trial court did not commit reversible error when it denied\r\n  SCE&amp;G's JNOV motion, because the Hollands presented evidence the waterline\r\n  was functional and operational prior to SCE&amp;G's cutting it.\r\nNext,\r\n  SCE&amp;G asserts it was entitled to JNOV because the Hollands engaged in an\r\n  illegal activity by constructing and installing their water system without the\r\n  proper permit.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) issued the\r\n  Hollands a water supply construction permit on January 11, 1999.Â  This permit\r\n  states, &quot;Construction must be completed prior to January 10, 2001, or this\r\n  permit will expire.&quot;Â  The Hollands retained Pizzo to install their water\r\n  system in June 2001, by which time the DHEC permit had expired.Â  \r\nDHEC\r\n  regulations allow for an extension of a permit if requested.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 61-58.1(B)(9) (Supp. 2008).Â  Mr. Holland testified he obtained another\r\n  permit from DHEC prior to Pizzo installing the water system.Â  Viewing the evidence and the inferences that can be reasonably\r\n  drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the Hollands, we conclude the\r\n  Hollands were in possession of a valid permit when Pizzo installed the water\r\n  system, and therefore, the trial court properly concluded SCE&amp;G was not entitled to JNOV.\r\nIn its next argument, SCE&amp;G contends it is entitled to a new\r\n  trial absolute because the trial court erred in charging the jury on the\r\n  notification requirements set forth in section 58-35-60 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe grant or denial of a new trial motion is left to the\r\n  discretion of the trial court, and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  unless its findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions\r\n  reached are controlled by an error of\r\n  law.Â  Umhoefer v. Bollinger, 298\r\n  S.C. 221, 224, 379 S.E.2d 296, 297 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  In deciding whether to assess\r\n  error to a trial court's denial of a motion for a new\r\n  trial, we must consider the testimony and reasonable inferences to be drawn\r\n  therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  law to be charged to the jury must be determined by the evidence offered at\r\n  trial.Â  State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 231-32, 625 S.E.2d 239, 245-46\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).Â  In South Carolina, a trial court is required to charge only\r\n  the current and correct law of this state.Â  Id.Â  A jury charge\r\n  is correct if it contains the correct definition of the law when read as a\r\n  whole.Â  Id.Â  On review, an\r\n  appellate court considers the charge as a whole in view of the evidence and\r\n  issues presented at trial.Â  Id.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  58-35-60, entitled the Underground Utility Damage\r\n  Prevention Act, in pertinent part provides:\r\n\r\n\t(a) [B]efore\r\n  commencing any excavation or demolition operation . . . each person responsible\r\n  for such excavation or demolition shall serve advance written or telephonic\r\n  notice of intent to excavate or demolish not less than three, but not more than\r\n  ten full working days\r\n\t1. On each operator which has underground utilities located in the\r\n  proposed area of excavation or demolition; or\r\n\t2. If the proposed area of excavation or\r\n  demolition is served by an association . . . on such association and on each\r\n  operator which has underground utilities in the proposed area of excavation or\r\n  demolition that is not receiving the services of the association; where\r\n  demolition of a building is proposed, operators shall be given reasonable time\r\n  to remove or protect their underground utilities before demolition of the\r\n  building is commenced.\r\n\r\nIf the language in a statute\r\n  is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no\r\n  need to resort to the rules of statutory interpretation.Â  City of Columbia v. Am. Civil\r\n    Liberties Union of S.C., Inc., 323 S.C. 384, 387, 475 S.E.2d 2d 747, 749\r\n  (1996).Â  If the\r\n  terms of a statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to\r\n  their literal meaning.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the language of section 58-35-60 is plain and unambiguous.Â \r\n  Subsection (a)(1) requires any &quot;person&quot; excavating to contact each\r\n  &quot;operator&quot; that has an underground utility located in the place to be\r\n  excavated.Â  &quot;Person&quot; is defined as &quot;any\r\n  individual, owner, corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity\r\n  organized under the laws of any state; any subdivision or instrumentality of a\r\n  state; and any authorized representative thereof.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  58-35-20(6) (Supp. 2008).Â  &quot;Operator&quot; is defined as &quot;any person\r\n  who owns or operates a utility.&quot;Â  Â§ 58-35-20(8).\r\nSCE&amp;G\r\n  qualifies as a &quot;person&quot; because it is a corporation organized under\r\n  the laws of a state.Â  The Hollands, Pizzo, and Pizzo's company, JOCO Construction, had already installed the waterline when SCE&amp;G\r\n  came to install the electric lines. Â Either the Hollands or Pizzo were the\r\n  operators for purposes of section 58-35-60 because either party owned the\r\n  waterline that was being installed.Â  SCE&amp;G, by its own admission, could not\r\n  say whether the Hollands or Pizzo were contacted prior to the installation of\r\n  the electric lines.[1]Â \r\n  Additionally, the purpose of section 58-35-60 is to prevent the exact thing that\r\n  occurred in this case, to prevent underground utilities that are in place from\r\n  being damaged.Â  In order to effectuate this purpose, subsections (a)(1) and (2)\r\n  require an excavator to contact others who might have utilities in the place that\r\n  is to be excavated so they may have the opportunity to have their lines marked\r\n  in order to prevent damage.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  expert witness, Roger Davis, testified that anyone who excavates has a duty to\r\n  contact others who might own utilities that could be damaged by the\r\n  excavation.Â  According to Davis, the Palmetto Utility Protection Service (PUPS)\r\n  was established as a clearing house that an excavator must call so PUPS can\r\n  notify the other owners of utility lines that an excavation is going to take\r\n  place.Â  Davis also stated the purpose of this is to give the other owners an\r\n  opportunity to go to the excavation location and mark the location of their\r\n  lines so their lines will not be damaged.Â  Davis testified an excavator\r\n  contacts PUPS, which in turn issues a ticket that provides documentation a call\r\n  to PUPS has been made.Â  Davis stated before any excavation is done, water and\r\n  sewer industry and underground utilities industry standards require PUPS be\r\n  contacted to determine the location of any other underground utilities to\r\n  prevent damaging them.Â  Davis also testified SCE&amp;G had a duty to contact\r\n  the Hollands because they should have been given the opportunity to have their\r\n  lines marked in order prevent damage.Â  \r\nA\r\n  representative from SCE&amp;G testified he called PUPS prior to putting in the\r\n  electric lines.Â  However, he could not locate the ticket number and stated,\r\n  &quot;I don't know what happened to it.&quot;Â  In viewing the evidence in the\r\n  light most favorable to nonmoving party, this ticket provides documentation the\r\n  call to PUPS was made.Â  Based on the foregoing, we cannot say the trial court\r\n  committed reversible error in denying SCE&amp;G's new trial motion. See Umhoefer,\r\n  298 S.C. at 224, 379 S.E.2d at 297 (holding the denial of a new trial motion\r\n  will not be disturbed unless the trial court's findings are wholly unsupported\r\n  by the evidence and when considering such a denial the\r\n  testimony and reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom are to be construed\r\n  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party).\r\nFinally, SCE&amp;G contends it was entitled to a JNOV on the\r\n  jury's award of punitive damages because, at most, its conduct was simple\r\n  negligence.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to collect an award of punitive damages, the plaintiff\r\n  bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence the defendant's\r\n  misconduct was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of the plaintiff's\r\n  rights. Â Welch, 342 S.C. at 301, 536 S.E.2d at 419.Â  A conscious failure\r\n  to use due care constitutes willfulness.Â  Id.Â  The question of punitive\r\n  damages must be submitted to the jury if more than one reasonable inference can\r\n  be drawn from the evidence as to whether the defendant's behavior was reckless,\r\n  willful, or wanton.Â  Id.Â  The amount of punitive damages awarded remains\r\n  largely within the discretion of the jury, as reviewed by the trial court.Â  Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 112, 406 S.E.2d 350, 355 (1991). This court will set aside the trial courtâ€™s determination if it has\r\n  abused its discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  Id.Â  An appellate\r\n  court must affirm the trial court's punitive damages finding if any evidence\r\n  reasonably supports the trial court's factual findings.Â  Austin v. Specialty\r\n    Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 314, 594 S.E.2d 867, 875 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the trial court's decision to deny SCE&amp;G's JNOV motion is\r\n  supported by the evidence.[2]Â \r\n  As discussed above, SCE&amp;G's failure to contact PUPS to determine the location of underground\r\n  utilities violated industry standards.[3] Â Additionally, SCE&amp;G failed to take responsibility for the third cut in the\r\n  waterline, which ultimately led to the Hollands' inability to obtain clean\r\n  running water.Â  Moreover, SCE&amp;G told the Hollands not to pay Pizzo and\r\n  described him as a &quot;money grabber,&quot; which led to Pizzo's\r\n  unwillingness to certify the line for BJWSA inspection.Â  Along these same\r\n  lines, SCE&amp;G communicated\r\n  to Pizzo it would pay the bill in full; this amount was later reduced to\r\n  one-half, then reduced again to one-third, and no payment was ever made.Â  Mrs.\r\n  Holland testified she contacted an SCE&amp;G representative after its crew\r\n  fixed the two cuts and complained the waterline was not functional and asked\r\n  when it would get fixed.Â  The SCE&amp;G representative responded, &quot;That\r\n  will never happen.&quot;Â  Once SCE&amp;G learned\r\n  of the third cut, its attempt to escape liability by promising Pizzo he would\r\n  be paid and urging the Hollands not to pay Pizzo required the question of punitive damages to be submitted to the\r\n  jury, because more than one reasonable inference could have been drawn as to\r\n  whether SCE&amp;G's behavior was reckless, willful, or wanton.Â  Â Â \r\nMoreover, in South Carolina the causative violation of a statute\r\n  constitutes negligence per se and is evidence of recklessness and willfulness,\r\n  requiring the submission of the\r\n  issue of punitive damages to the jury.Â  Austin, 358 S.C. at 314-15, 594\r\n  S.E.2d at 875-76. (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Although violation of a statute does not\r\n  constitute recklessness, willfulness, and wantonness per se, it does provide\r\n  some evidence the defendant acted\r\n  recklessly, willfully, and wantonly.Â  Id.Â  Ultimately, the jury determines\r\n  whether the defendant has been reckless, willful, and wanton.Â  Id.\r\nAs we previously explained, SCE&amp;G violated section 58-35-60\r\n  when it failed to contact others who might\r\n  have utilities in the place to be excavated so they may have the opportunity to\r\n  have their lines marked to prevent damage.Â  As such, the question of whether\r\n  this constituted reckless, willful, and wanton behavior was for the jury to\r\n  decide.Â  Id.Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\r\n  SCE&amp;G's JNOV motion concerning the jury's award\r\n  of punitive damages.\r\nII. The Hollands' Appeal\r\nAt the conclusion\r\n  of the trial, SCE&amp;G filed numerous post-trial motions including a new trial nisi remittitur based on the jury's award of punitive damages.Â  The trial court granted this\r\n  motion and reduced the amount of punitive damages from approximately $300,000\r\n  to $50,000.Â  On appeal, the\r\n  Hollands argue the trial court's ruling that the award of punitive damages was\r\n  the result of jury passion is in error.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a new trial motion rests within the discretion of the\r\n  trial court, and its decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless its\r\n  findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are\r\n  controlled by an error of law.Â  Howard, 376 S.C. at 155-56, 654 S.E.2d\r\n  at 883-84.Â  The trial court alone has the power to grant a new trial nisi if it finds the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate or excessive.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Great deference is given to the trial court, which heard the evidence and is\r\n  more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial, and thus, possesses a\r\n  better-informed view of the damages than this court. [4]Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn the present case, the trial court granted the nisi motion because it felt the amount of punitive damages was the result of the\r\n  jury's sympathy for the Hollands' son.Â  The following testimony was heard by\r\n  the jury about the Hollands' son: \r\n\r\n\tQ: [Mrs. Holland,] tell the jury about your son. \r\n\tA: My son, whose name was Shawn, was a beautiful boy, and he was\r\n  born severely mentally retarded.Â  He was not a burden to us. He was just . . . a\r\n  lot of work, and I was his care-giver, and I took care of him from the time he\r\n  was born until he passed away in [2004].Â  And he required a lot, and my husband\r\n  was just very good with him.Â  I mean, he would stand at the window in the\r\n  evening looking for my husband to come home from work.Â  So he was â€“ he cared\r\n  for him as well as I did, but I was home all day with him.\r\n\tQ: How did the water situation, or the water from the well[[5]], affect the taking care of Shawn?\r\n\tA: It was kind of difficult because Shawn needed a lot of care. .\r\n  . . [W]e were together constantly until, you know, I got him ready for school.Â \r\n  He would spend a few hours in school.Â  I was there when he got home, so I did\r\n  everything for him. I fed him, I changed him, and that was a little difficult\r\n  because I'd have to keep washing him, and I really didn't like to use [the\r\n  well] water because I wasn't sure what was going on with that water. . . . Â \r\n\tQ: How did the well water affect you and your husband if you\r\n  bathed in it? \r\n\tA: You'd itch and you'd have to use almost a gallon of lotion,\r\n  because your skin stayed real dry, and you'd itch a lot.Â  You would just itch\r\n  and scratch until your skin burned.Â  So it wasn't very good[,] it wasn't a very\r\n  good thing for bathing.\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\tQ: Did you bathe Shawn in this water?\r\n\tA: No. We didn't want to because we didn't know what was happening\r\n  with this water, and eventually Shawn got into a feeding tube, and we were\r\n  particularly scared then because sometime[s] he would pull the feeding tube out\r\n  and I had to insert it back in.Â  So I really didn't want to put him in the well\r\n  water because . . . he also had been diagnosed as terminally ill before we left\r\n  Washington.\r\n\tQ: All right. Well, we aren't saying [SCE&amp;G] is responsible .\r\n  . . .\r\n\tA: Oh, no.Â  Oh, no.Â  My son is they are not responsible for my\r\n  son's death.Â  \r\n\tA: Did you bathe Shawn on a daily basis?Â  \r\n\tQ: Yes.Â  I had to. \r\n\r\nÂ The trial court reasoned the amount of punitive damage was the\r\n  result of sympathy the jury felt for the Hollands' &quot;plight for having to\r\n  take care of a son in those conditions,&quot; and it concluded an element of\r\n  passion was involved in the amount of punitive damages.Â  Based on the quoted\r\n  testimony, discerning the trial court's concern is not difficult.Â  The\r\n  testimony of Mrs. Holland could have easily swayed the jury to award $314,583\r\n  in punitive damages.Â  We believe the trial court's decision to grant the nisi motion was within its discretion.Â  See id. (holding the decision to grant or deny new trial motions rests within the discretion\r\n  of the trial court, and great deference is given to the trial court, which\r\n  heard the evidence and is more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere at\r\n  trial and thus possesses a better-informed view of the damages than this court).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â  \r\nHUFF,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We need not determine who was the operator, the\r\n  Hollands or Pizzo, because SCE&amp;G failed to notify either.Â  Thus, which\r\n  party is considered the operator is irrelevant.Â  See Sloan v. Greenville\r\n    County, 356 S.C. 531, 552, 590 S.E.2d 338, 349 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding the\r\n  function of an appellate court is not to give opinions on abstract or\r\ntheoretical matters).Â  \r\n[2] As previously noted, the trial\r\ncourt reduced the punitive damages from approximately $300,000 to $50,000.Â  \r\n[3] While we recognize an SCE&amp;G representative\r\n  testified he called PUPS, he could not produce the documentation to\r\n  substantiate his claim.Â  Our standard of review when\r\n  adjudicating the denial of a motion for JNOV is constrained by viewing the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\n  nonmoving party.Â  Welch, 342 S.C. at 299-300, 536 S.E.2d at 418-19.Â \r\n  Additionally, the trial court must deny a JNOV motion when the evidence yields\r\nmore than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Id.\r\n[4] The Hollands incorrectly set out our standard of\r\n  review.Â  They state the standard of review for JNOV.Â  However the trial court\r\ngranted SCE&amp;G's nisi motion.Â  \r\n[5] As mentioned, when the Hollands could not obtain\r\nwater from BJWSA they installed a well.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-282","title":"Mozingo v.

Elliot, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this wrongful death and\r\n  survivor action, Helen Ann Mozingo appeals the grant of summary judgment in\r\n  favor of Visteon Corporation (Visteon) arguing the trial court erred in finding\r\n  Visteon was not a successor corporation to Ford.Â  Specifically, while Visteon\r\n  as a separate entity was not in existence at the time the vehicle was\r\n  manufactured, Mozingo asserts Visteon's SEC Registration Statement and Master\r\n  Transfer Agreement (MTA) evidenced an assumption of liability for component\r\n  parts supplied to Ford and installed in 1997 and later year model Ford\r\n  vehicles. Â We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2).\r\nAs to whether the Registration Statement and MTA created\r\n  a genuine issue of fact on the successor corporation claim, summary judgment\r\n  was appropriate as neither the Registration Statement nor the MTA were\r\n  submitted to the court prior to or at the summary judgment hearing.Â  See West v. Gladney, 341 S.C. 127, 135, 533 S.E.2d 334, 338 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n  (affirming summary judgment where statement of fact presented only in\r\n  attorney's argument would not be considered by the court in determining whether\r\n  a genuine issue of material fact exists sufficient to preclude summary\r\n  judgment). Â Moreover, while the Registration Statement was submitted after the\r\n  hearing as an exhibit with the Rule 59(e) motion, a party cannot use Rule 59(e)\r\n  to present new evidence to the court.Â  See Brailsford v. Brailsford,\r\n  380 S.C. 443, 448, 669 S.E.2d 342, 345 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding issue is not\r\n  preserved for appeal where it was never presented to the trial court prior to\r\n  the filing of the motion to alter or amend); Eaddy v. Oliver, 345 S.C.\r\n  39, 44, 545 S.E.2d 830, 833 (Ct. App. 2001) (a party cannot for the first time\r\n  raise an issue by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at\r\n  trial).Â  \r\nNotwithstanding, even if we were to consider the untimely\r\n  Registration Statement and MTA, summary judgment would still be appropriate as\r\n  the provisions cited by Mozingo evidence, at most, a mere indemnification\r\n  agreement between Ford and Visteon for auto parts.Â  Likewise, while the\r\n  existence of an agreement to assume the debts of the predecessor or selling\r\n  company is an exception to the general rule of nonliability, Visteon's\r\n  willingness to assume liability to Ford for auto parts is not analogous to\r\n  being a successor corporation to Ford.Â  See Simmons v. Mark Lift\r\n    Indus., Inc., 366 S.C. 308, 312, 622 S.E.2d 213, 215 (2005) (stating in the\r\n  absence of a statute, a successor or purchasing company ordinarily is not\r\n  liable for the debts of a predecessor or selling company under a theory of\r\n  successor liability unless: (1) there was an agreement to assume the debts of\r\n  the predecessor or selling company; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\r\n  transaction warrant a finding of a consolidation or merger of the two\r\n  corporations; (3) the successor company was a mere continuation of the\r\n  predecessor; or (4) the transaction was entered into fraudulently for the\r\n  purpose of wrongfully defeating creditors' claims) (citing Brown v. Am. Ry.\r\n    Express Co., 128 S.C. 428, 123 S.E. 97 (1924)).Â  The record is simply\r\n  insufficient to establish any basis upon which to classify Visteon as a\r\n  successor corporation to Ford.Â  Moreover, Mozingo does not challenge the trial\r\n  court's additional finding that Visteon cannot be liable under an independent\r\n  products liability theory since Visteon did not manufacture the vehicle; thus, this\r\n  finding is the law of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v.\r\n    Miller Hous. Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (stating\r\n  an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of\r\n  this case). \r\nAccordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-283","title":"State v.

(Mother) appeals the family court's order\r\n  denying her motion to withdraw voluntary consent relinquishing her parental\r\n  rights to minor child (Child).Â  On appeal, Mother contends the family court\r\n  erred in (1) finding the consent was valid; (2) excusing the guardian ad\r\n  litem (GAL); and (3) failing to consider Child's best interest.Â  Mother further\r\n  contends South Carolina adoption statutes violate equal protection and public\r\n  policy.Â  We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: \r\n1.Â  As to whether Mother's consent was valid:Â  S.C.

Blitch, Jr., and Solicitor Warren B\r\n  Giese; all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Miama Kromah appeals her convictions\r\n  and sentences for unlawful neglect of a child and infliction of great bodily\r\n  injury upon a child.Â  She argues the trial court erred in (1) permitting the State's witnesses to testify as to\r\n  the actions they took as a result of hearsay statements made by the three-year\r\n  old victim who would have been incompetent to testify at trial; (2) allowing\r\n  the State to argue during closing argument that the victim was deliberately\r\n  hidden away from the State, implying the victim would have testified Kromah\r\n  committed this crime; and (3) denying Kromah's new trial motion based on\r\n  after-discovered evidence.Â  We affirm. \r\n1.&nbsp; We find Kromah's argument that the trial court erred in\r\n  permitting the State's witnesses to testify unpreserved for review.Â  With\r\n  regards to Heather Smith's testimony, the objection did not specifically\r\n  pertain to her reliance on the victim's statements, but rather addressed the\r\n  form of the State's question.Â  See State v. Turner, 373 S.C. 121, 126 n.1, 644\r\n  S.E.2d 693, 696 n.1 (2007) (holding in order for an issue to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court); State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 58, 609 S.E.2d 520, 523 (2005)\r\n  (holding an objection should be addressed to the trial court in a sufficiently\r\n  specific manner that it brings attention to the exact error).Â  Similarly, the objection lodged during\r\n  Investigator Roy Livingston's direct-examination did not address any alleged\r\n  hearsay statement.\r\n2.Â  We find Kromah's argument that the trial court erred in\r\n  allowing the State's closing argument unpreserved for review because the\r\n  objection addressed the lack of evidence to support the State's arguments, not\r\n  the implications of the argument.Â  Additionally, Kromah did not make a\r\n  contemporaneous objection to the closing argument based on its insinuations.Â  See State\r\n    v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003) (&quot;A party may\r\n  not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal.&quot;); In\r\n    the Matter of the Care &amp; Treatment of McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 93, 551\r\n  S.E.2d 235, 238-39 (2001) (holding the proper course is to object immediately\r\n  to an improper argument).\r\n3.Â  We\r\n  find the trial court properly denied Kromah's new trial motion because the\r\n  alleged after-discovered evidence is not such that it would probably change the\r\n  result if a new trial was granted and the evidence could have been discovered\r\n  and presented during her trial.Â  See State v. Spann, 334 S.C.\r\n  618, 619-20, 513 S.E.2d 98, 99 (1999) (holding that in order to prevail on a\r\n  new trial motion based on after-discovered evidence, the appellant must show\r\n  the evidence:Â  &quot;(1) is such that it would probably change the result if a\r\n  new trial were granted; (2) has been discovered since the trial; (3) could not\r\n  in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered prior to the trial; (4)\r\n  is material; and (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching&quot;). \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-323","title":"State v.

Polk, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this workers' compensation action, Kenneth Dale Sharp (Sharp) appeals\r\n  from an order of the circuit court affirming the full commission's decision to\r\n  award 50% disability benefits of the right lower extremity.Â  On appeal, Sharp\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in affirming the commission's order denying\r\n  benefits of the hip on the ground Sharp sustained an injury to the hip as well\r\n  as to the lower extremity or leg. Â Sharp further asserts the circuit court\r\n  erred in affirming the commission's finding that Sharp's Form 16 settlement,\r\n  which awarded recovery to the leg only, precluded Sharp from seeking recovery\r\nfor the hip under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  we acknowledge that the hip is separate from the leg, substantial evidence exists\r\n  to support the commission's award.Â  Furthermore, due to Sharp's Form 16\r\n  settlement, the application of collateral estoppel as a bar to Sharp's\r\n  additional claim to the hip was not in error as the record indicates Sharp was\r\n  aware of his hip injury prior to his voluntary decision to enter into the\r\n  settlement for benefits to the leg only. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-70\r\n  (1985) (noting that an unappealed award or settlement of the commission shall\r\n  have the same effect as a judgment); Singleton v. Young Lumber Co., 236\r\n  S.C. 454, 463, 114 S.E.2d 837, 841 (1960) (stating an agreement for\r\n  compensation, when approved by the commission, is binding on the parties as an\r\n  order, decision or award of the commission unappealed from, or an award of the\r\n  commission affirmed upon appeal).

Summers, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â \r\n  The South Carolina Department of Corrections (the Department) appeals the\r\n  circuit court's decision reversing the denial of back pay to William\r\n  Brightharp, Jr.Â  We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  April of 2003, Brightharp, a long-time corrections officer, was placed on\r\n  administrative suspension without pay pending homicide by child abuse charges\r\n  filed against him.Â  These charges related to Brightharp's second job supervising\r\n  and managing emotionally disturbed children/adolescents in an inpatient setting\r\n  at New Hope Treatment Center.Â  He and two other employees were accused of\r\n  improperly restraining a minor patient who died of asphyxiation.Â  Brightharp\r\n  filed a grievance with the Department asking to be allowed to work in some sort\r\n  of capacity during the investigation of the charges against him. Â Â He wrote:\r\n\r\n\tI have not gone\r\n  to court[;] therefore, I'm innocent till proven otherwise.Â  By allowing me to\r\n  work I may continue[] to up hold my obligation to this agency and my family.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBrightharp's\r\n  request for reinstatement was investigated by Crystal Rookard, the Department's\r\n  Deputy General Counsel.Â  Rookard filed a report with Robert E. Ward, the Acting\r\n  Director of the Department's Division of Operations, who upheld Brightharp's administrative\r\n  suspension.Â  In the letter informing Brightharp his suspension was being\r\n  upheld, he was advised he could continue the grievance process by appealing to\r\n  the Director of the Department.Â  Brightharp did not pursue his grievance any\r\n  further.\r\nIn\r\n  August of 2004, the Department's Policy Number ADM-11.04, dealing with corrective\r\n  actions, was amended to include a discussion of administrative suspensions.[1]Â  It stated:Â  \r\n\r\n\tAdministrative\r\n  Suspension refers to a period of suspension without pay that may exceed 15\r\n  workdays if the alleged violation requires that an employee not be allowed to\r\n  return to work pending the outcome of an internal/external investigation or\r\n  when the presence of an employee presents a perceived threat or danger to the\r\n  health and/or safety of other employees or to the operation or security of an\r\n  office or institution.Â  (NOTE: If an employee is authorized to return to work,\r\n  reimbursement for back pay may or may not be approved by the Division Director\r\n  of Human Resources based on the circumstances of administrative suspension.)Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  February of 2005, the charges against Brightharp were dismissed.Â  The\r\n  Solicitor's Office provided Brightharp with a letter explaining the deceptive\r\n  actions of the administration at New Hope Treatment Center were directly\r\n  responsible for Brightharp's indictiment.Â  Had the parties been truthful, the\r\n  letter stated, charges would never have been brought against Brightharp.Â  Brightharp\r\n  submitted a Notification of Arrest/Disposition form and the letter from the\r\n  solicitor's office to the Department.Â  He was taken off administrative suspension\r\n  and returned to work at Lieber Correctional Institute, but was denied back pay.Â \r\n  Unsatisfied with this resolution, Brightharp filed a grievance in which he requested\r\n  back pay for the two years he was on administrative suspension and credit for\r\n  time lost.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Department's Division of Human Resources informed Brightharp his grievance\r\n  regarding the denial of back pay was an improper attempt to reopen his April\r\n  2003 grievance.Â  Brightharp was informed via letter at the next appellate level\r\n  that &quot;[t]he appeal must be denied because you failed to exhaust\r\n  administrative remedies at the agency level. . . . Since you failed to exhaust\r\n  and did not initiate an appeal with the State Human Resources Director [in\r\n  2003] within the time frame established by the Act, the merits of your appeal\r\n  were not reviewed.&quot; \r\nBrightharp\r\n  appealed the denial of back pay to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court heard\r\n  Brightharp's appeal and requested the Department substantiate the record with\r\n  respect to the basis for the denial.Â  In response, the Department provided the circuit\r\n  court with the affidavit of its Director of Human Resources, John Near.Â  In his\r\n  affidavit, Near stated that under Policy Number ADM-11.04 he was the proper\r\n  party to make the decision regarding the award of back pay to Brightharp.Â  He\r\n  stated he reviewed the letter submitted by the solicitor's office along with\r\n  Brightharp's Notification of Arrest/Disposition form on March 2, 2005.Â  Near\r\n  made a handwritten notation on the form:Â  &quot;No further action required.Â \r\n  Approved to reinstate per legal to previous salary with general increase\r\n  effective upon reinstatement. No salary backpay or service reinstatement.&quot;Â \r\n  Near stated that on March 3, 2005, he reviewed Brightharp's employment history\r\n  and again made a handwritten notation:Â  &quot;I believe [Brightharp] will\r\n  return to work on Friday 3/4/05.Â  Please ensure general increase is awarded at\r\n  that time.Â  No backpay and no service reinstatement.&quot;Â  Near further stated\r\n  he disapproved Brightharp's back pay in light of the Department's historical\r\n  practice of not awarding back pay when an administrative suspension without pay\r\n  was imposed as a result of an arrest, indictment, or prosecution unrelated to\r\n  employment with the Department and outside of the Department's control.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court concluded Brightharp's 2003 grievance had not animated a request\r\n  for back pay and that he had been denied due process because the Department had\r\n  failed to consider the merits of his request.Â  The circuit court found\r\n  Brightharp could not have requested back pay in his 2003 grievance because the\r\n  back pay provision of Policy Number ADM-11.04 was not in place at that time.Â  The\r\n  court further concluded the Department had provided no evidence to substantiate\r\n  its decision to deny Brightharp's request and reversed the denial of\r\n  Brightharp's request for back pay.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder the scope of review\r\n  established in the Administrative Procedures Act, this court â€œmay not substitute\r\n  its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on\r\n  questions of fact.â€Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2008).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify\r\n  a final agency decision if the agency's findings, inferences, conclusions or\r\n  decisions are &quot;affected by . . . error of law,&quot; are &quot;clearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial\r\n  evidence on the whole record,&quot; or areÂ  &quot;arbitrary or capricious or\r\n  characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of\r\n  discretion.&quot; Â Â§\r\n  1-23-380(5)(d)-(f).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Exhaustion\r\n  of Administrative Remedies \r\nThe\r\n  Department argues Brightharp's 2003 request for reinstatement animated a\r\n  request for back pay; therefore, his failure to exhaust his administrative\r\n  remedies in 2003 precluded consideration of his request in 2005.Â  We disagree.\r\nNo\r\n  specific provision indicates when or how an employee is to make a request for\r\n  back pay.Â  The Department's argument seems to hinge on the fact that if Brightharp's\r\n  suspension had been reversed, he would automatically have been granted back\r\n  pay.[2]Â  However, according\r\n  to Policy Number ADM-11.04, the Department's Director of Human Resources makes the\r\n  decision regarding back pay in his discretion.Â  The policy does not mention any\r\n  requirement that the employee's suspension be found to have been unlawful or\r\n  improper.Â  Consequently, the award of back pay is not tied directly to a\r\n  determination regarding the lawfulness of the suspension, a matter that may\r\n  well have been abandoned when Brightharp did not pursue his 2003 grievance.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we agree with the circuit court that a request for back pay was not necessarily\r\n  included in a request for reinstatement, and thus, the filing of Brightharp's\r\n  2005 grievance was not an attempt to reopen his 2003 grievance. Â \r\nII.&nbsp; Due\r\n  Process\r\nThe\r\n  Department next contends it did not violate Brightharp's due process rights by\r\n  failing to consider his grievance on the merits.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œThe right to hold specific employment and the\r\n  right to follow a chosen profession free from unreasonable governmental\r\n  interference come within the liberty and property interests protected by the\r\n  Due Process Clause [of the Fourteenth Amendment].â€Â  Sloan v. S.C. Bd. Of\r\n    Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 483, 636 S.E.2d 598, 615 (2006).\r\nProcedural due process in matters regarding a property or liberty\r\n  interest generally includes &quot;adequate notice, the opportunity to be heard\r\n  at a meaningful time and in a meaningful way, the right to introduce evidence,\r\n  the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses whose testimony is used to\r\n  establish facts, and the right to meaningful judicial review.&quot; Â Id. at 484-85, 636 S.E.2d at 615.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  have concluded Brightharp's 2005 grievance should not have been disposed of on\r\n  procedural grounds but should have been considered on the merits.Â  We must now\r\n  consider whether he was afforded the required due process.Â  \r\nEvidence\r\n  in the record suggests Near, the Department's Director of Human Resources, considered\r\n  Brightharp's entitlement to back pay on the merits.Â  In his affidavit, Near\r\n  stated he considered the letter from the solicitor's office detailing the\r\n  circumstances of Brightharp's indictment, as well Brightharp's employment\r\n  history with the Department.Â  Near also factored in the Department's historical\r\n  practice of not awarding back pay for suspensions related to outside matters.Â  However,\r\n  according to correspondence from the Department's Division of Human Resources\r\n  and the State Director of Human Resources, Brightharp's appeal from that decision\r\n  was not reviewed on its merits.Â  We agree with the circuit court that this\r\n  deprived Brightharp of due process.\r\nIn\r\n  reaching its ultimate ruling, the circuit court found Near's reliance on the\r\n  historical practice of denying back pay was essentially a pretext because the\r\n  language of Policy\r\n  Number ADM-11.04 was only amended a few months prior to Near's decision. Â The\r\n  circuit court then affirmatively granted Brightharp's request for back pay.Â  We\r\n  believe this action went beyond the permissible scope of judicial review, and\r\n  the appropriate action would have been to remand the matter to the Department\r\n  for review of Near's decision on the merits. \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit court's award of back pay is vacated and the issue of Brightharp's\r\n  grievance is remanded for a review on the merits to be conducted in accordance\r\n  with the Department's grievance policy.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In the 2002\r\n  edition of this policy, administrative suspension was not discussed in any\r\n  detail, but was listed as an option available to the reprimanding authority.\r\n[2] This position\r\n  may be supported in some respects by Perry v.

DuRant, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In\r\n  2004, Travis Dale Smith pled guilty to committing a lewd act on a minor.Â  He\r\n  was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment, suspended upon the service of five\r\n  years' probation, and received credit for 374 days served.Â  According to the\r\n  sentencing sheet, Smith was required to refrain from contacting the victim and\r\n  to &quot;follow special conditions for sex offenders.&quot;Â  On September 16,\r\n  2004, Smith endorsed a document entitled &quot;Special Conditions for Sex\r\n  Offenders,&quot; which prohibited him from initiating, establishing, or\r\n  maintaining &quot;contact with any male or female child under the age of 18,\r\n  except a member of [his] immediate household family.&quot;\r\nOn September 18, 2007, Smith's probation agent found a\r\n  seventeen-year-old girl hiding in Smith's bed and recommended Smith's probation\r\n  be revoked.Â  The circuit court revoked the balance of Smith's probation based\r\n  upon Smith's failure to pay some supervision fees, failure to follow the advice\r\n  and instructions of his probation agent or to comply with conditions of his\r\n  probation, and failure to abide by the special conditions.Â  The circuit court\r\n  specifically refused to order global positioning satellite (GPS) monitoring.Â  \r\nThe State appeals, arguing the circuit court abused its discretion\r\n  by refusing to order GPS monitoring as well.Â  We agree.[1]Â  \r\nA decision to\r\n  revoke probation generally rests within the circuit court's discretion; however,\r\n  an appellate court should reverse when that decision is based on an error of\r\n  law or lacks supporting evidence.Â  State v. Crouch, 355 S.C. 355, 359,\r\n  585 S.E.2d 288, 291&nbsp;(2003).Â  &quot;A person who is required to register [as\r\n  a sex offender] pursuant to this article for . . . committing or attempting a\r\n  lewd act upon a child under sixteen, pursuant to Section 16-15-140, and who\r\n  violates a term of probation . . . must be ordered by the court or\r\n  agency with jurisdiction to be monitored . . . with an active electronic\r\n  monitoring device.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-540(C) (Supp. 2008)\r\n  (emphasis added).&nbsp; &quot;The person shall be monitored . . . for\r\n  the duration of the time the person is required to remain on the sex offender\r\n  registry.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-540(H) (Supp.\r\n  2008) (emphasis added).[2]&nbsp;\r\n  &quot;When a statute's terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is\r\n  no room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according\r\n  to its literal meaning.&quot;&nbsp; Miller v. Aiken, 364 S.C.\r\n  303, 307, 613 S.E.2d 364, 366 (2005).&nbsp; The word &quot;shall&quot;\r\n  indicates the time period set forth in Â§ 23-3-540(H) is mandatory.&nbsp; See State v. Foster,&nbsp;277 S.C. 211, 212, 284 S.E.2d 780, 780&nbsp;(1981)\r\n  (&quot;Taken literally, the word 'shall' is mandatory.&quot;).&nbsp; \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court erred in refusing to impose GPS monitoring because this decision\r\n  clearly was not within its discretion. Â GPS monitoring following a probation\r\n  violation is discretionary in some cases.Â  However, GPS monitoring following a\r\n  probation violation is mandatory in the case of a person classified as a sex\r\n  offender for committing a lewd act on a child under sixteen.Â  Smith violated\r\n  not only the special condition restricting his contact with minors, but also\r\n  conditions requiring him to pay\r\n  supervision fees, to follow the advice and instructions of his probation agent,\r\n  and to comply with conditions of his probation.Â  Each of these violations\r\n  individually mandated revocation of his remaining probation and imposition of\r\n  GPS monitoring.Â  Accordingly, to the\r\n  extent it declines to order Smith to submit to GPS monitoring, the order of the\r\n  circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEANR,\r\nC.J., THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] However, a person may petition for release from the\r\n  monitoring requirements ten years from the date electronic monitoring is\r\n  imposed.Â  S.C.

Fred Kuhn,\r\n          Jr., of Beaufort and Richardson Wieters, of Hilton Head, for Respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Douglas\r\n  Lambrecht appeals the denial of a motion to impose sanctions under Rule 11,\r\n  SCRCP, or pursuant to the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions\r\n  Act (FCPSA)\r\n  under Sections 15-36-10, et seq. of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008). Â We\r\n  now withdraw our previous opinion from publication and substitute this revised\r\nopinion.Â  We vacate and remand.\r\nUnder the\r\n  peculiar facts of this case, more specific findings and conclusions by the\r\n  trial court are necessary because a duty to dismiss or withdraw frivolous\r\n  litigation may arise at a subsequent point in the litigation based on whether\r\n  an attorney knew or should have known a claim is frivolous.Â  This type of\r\n  review requires an intensive factual consideration of the record, including\r\n  discovery. Â We are unable to determine which facts the trial court relied upon\r\n  in its decision.Â  We therefore vacate the denial of sanctions and remand the\r\n  matter to the trial judge for an order &quot;identifying the facts and\r\n  accompanying legal analysis on which [he] relied&quot; to enable meaningful\r\n  appellate review of this issue.
