Thye, of Columbia,\r\n        for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; This appeal\r\narises after the trial court directed a verdict for the City of Columbia in an\r\naction brought by Wanda Stanley involving allegations that the City unlawfully\r\ndetained and euthanized five of her Shar-Pei puppies.&nbsp; We reverse and\r\nremand for trial.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case has had a tangled\r\nprocedural history that includes a prior appeal resulting in a decision by this\r\ncourt and review by the supreme court, which affirmed in part and reversed in\r\npart our decision.&nbsp; We adopt the factual summary of the supreme court in Stanley\r\nv. Kirkpatrick, 357 S.C. 169, 172-173, 592 S.E.2d 296, 297-98 (2004), as\r\nincluded below.\r\nRespondent bred Shar-Pei dogs at her Columbia home.&nbsp; Due to the complaints of neighbors, the City\r\nfined Respondent several times for operating an unlawful kennel and for keeping\r\nunlicensed pets.&nbsp; Officer Kevin Kirkpatrick issued at least three of these\r\ncitations.\r\nKirkpatrick testified he received a\r\ncomplaint in July 1996.&nbsp; As a result, he, along with Officer H.P.\r\nStephenson of the Humane Society, visited Respondentâ€™s home and saw fifteen\r\nShar-Pei dogs inside the house and in the backyard, which was enclosed with a\r\nmetal gate.&nbsp; On July 8, 1996, Stephenson and Kirkpatrick returned to the\r\nresidence in an effort to acquire details for a search warrant.&nbsp; On this\r\nvisit, they saw five female Shar-Pei puppies running around the street and in\r\nthe neighborâ€™s yard.&nbsp; They captured the at-large puppies.\r\nThe following day, Kirkpatrick\r\nserved a warrant on Respondent, citing her for violating a city ordinance\r\nrestricting the number of dogs per residence.&nbsp; He informed Respondent he\r\nhad captured five puppies that were taken to the Animal Services Shelter (the\r\nshelter) and that she needed to contact the shelter to\r\nidentify the puppies.&nbsp; While Kirkpatrick assumed the dogs were Respondentâ€™s,\r\nhe testified that because the dogs were picked up at-large, there was still a\r\nquestion whether they were truly hers.\r\nIn her deposition, Respondent\r\ndisputed the events as related by Kirkpatrick and Stephenson.&nbsp; She\r\ntestified she believed Kirkpatrick opened the gate, entered her backyard, and\r\nremoved her dogs.[2]&nbsp; However,\r\nshe stated she did not see him open the gate, nor did anyone tell her they saw\r\nhim open the gate.&nbsp; She stated a dog had never escaped from her backyard,\r\nand there was mesh screening around the gate to prevent such an occurrence.\r\nRespondent contacted the shelter and\r\nwas informed she would have to pay $129 per dog to redeem them.[3]&nbsp; Two employees at the shelter testified they\r\ndirectly informed respondent she had to identify the dogs because the shelter\r\nholds unidentifiable animals for only five days.[4]&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent claimed no one told her she had only five\r\ndays to retrieve the dogs.\r\nBecause no one came to the shelter\r\nto identify the dogs, they were euthanized.&nbsp; They were found to be\r\nunsuitable for adoption because they had a skin problem and were aggressive\r\ntowards each other and the handlers.\r\nRespondent filed a Â§ 1983 claim\r\nagainst the City.[5]&nbsp; She later\r\nfiled a motion to amend the complaint to add state tort claims to her Â§ 1983\r\nlawsuit.&nbsp; The City filed a motion for summary judgment.&nbsp; The trial\r\ncourt denied the motion to amend and granted the Cityâ€™s motion for summary\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the trial courtâ€™s denial of Respondentâ€™s\r\nmotion to amend her complaint to add state tort claims and reversed the trial\r\ncourtâ€™s order granting summary judgment on the Â§ 1983 claim.&nbsp; The\r\nsupreme court affirmed by also finding the trial court had in fact erred by\r\ndenying Respondentsâ€™ motion to amend the complaint.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; at 178, 592 S.E.2d at 300.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the supreme court reversed on the granting of the summary judgment on\r\nthe Â§ 1983 claim.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nThe court determined Respondent was unable to show any official policy or custom\r\nexisted that caused her to suffer a denial of a constitutional right.&nbsp; Id. at 175-178, 592 S.E.2d at 299-300.\r\nAs a result of the supreme court\r\ndecision, the case was remanded and Stanley\r\nwas allowed to amend the complaint to add causes of action for trespass to land,\r\ntrespass to chattels, and conversion.&nbsp; The case proceeded to trial.&nbsp;\r\nAfter Stanleyâ€™s case-in-chief, the court granted a directed verdict for\r\nthe City on the grounds:\r\n\r\n  the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the plaintiff is that she did not believe Mr. Kirkpatrickâ€™s\r\n  statement that the dogs were wriggling out from under the fence because her\r\n  â€“ she considered her yard secure and they had never escaped before;\r\n  therefore, he must have let them out.&nbsp; I find that is â€“ and he\r\n  ultimately ended up with possession, so therefore, he had to let them\r\n  out.&nbsp; I find thatâ€™s speculative and conjectural.&nbsp; That is not\r\n  sufficient circumstantial evidence or direct evidence to establish that he\r\n  opened the gate or that he did anything which â€“ to allow the dogs to come\r\n  out of the fenced area; therefore, as to the trespass Iâ€™m directing a\r\n  verdict.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRegarding the claim of conversion,\r\nthe court also granted a directed verdict because Stanley did nothing more than\r\ncall and inquire after the puppies.&nbsp; The court says a claim of ownership is\r\nrequired and suggests that Stanleyâ€™s actions do not fulfill the\r\nrequirement.&nbsp; Stanley appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen the trial court rules on a\r\nmotion for directed verdict, it is required to view the evidence and the\r\ninferences which reasonably can be drawn in the light most favorable to the\r\nparty opposing the motion and to deny the motion where either the evidence\r\nyields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.&nbsp; Harvey v.\r\nStrickland, 350 S.C. 303, 308, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002).&nbsp; â€œWhen\r\nconsidering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate\r\ncourt has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the\r\ntestimony or evidence.â€&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; â€œIn essence, we must\r\ndetermine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be reasonably\r\npossible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€&nbsp; Bultman\r\nv. Barber, 277 S.C. 5, 7, 281 S.E.2d 791, 792 (1981).&nbsp; â€œIf the\r\nevidence is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, the case should\r\nbe submitted to the jury.â€&nbsp; Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C.\r\n589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998).\r\nLAW AND DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trespass\r\n\r\nStanley argues the trial court erred\r\nin granting a directed verdict on the trespass cause of action.&nbsp; We agree.\r\nIn delivering its ruling, the trial\r\njudge stated:\r\n\r\n  the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the plaintiff is that she did not believe Mr. Kirkpatrickâ€™s\r\n  statement that the dogs were wriggling out from under the fence because her\r\n  â€“ she considered her yard secure and they had never escaped before;\r\n  therefore, he must have let them out. . . .&nbsp; I find thatâ€™s speculative\r\n  and conjectural.&nbsp; That is not sufficient circumstantial evidence or\r\n  direct evidence to establish that he opened the gate or that he did anything .\r\n  . . to allow the dogs to come out of the fenced area.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nHowever, if there is even a mere â€œscintilla\r\nof evidenceâ€ tending to prove the allegations of the complaints, the motion\r\nmust be denied.&nbsp; Jamison v. The Pantry, Inc., 301 S.C. 443, 444, 392\r\nS.E.2d 474, 475 (Ct. App. 1990).&nbsp; â€œBecause a direction of a verdict is\r\nnot favored, a case must be clear, certain, or indisputable to warrant a trial\r\njudgeâ€™s granting of a motion seeking a directed verdict.â€&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nThis is the same standard this court employs when reviewing a grant of summary\r\njudgment.&nbsp;\r\nWe previously ruled that summary\r\njudgment was inappropriate because â€œStanley provided evidence by deposition\r\ntestimony and sworn affidavits that the puppies were in the fenced back yard,\r\nthat they were of a size unable to go under the fence, and that the fence was\r\nreinforced with mesh.â€&nbsp; Stanley v. Kirkpatrick, Op. No.\r\n2001-UP-016 (S.C.Ct.App. refiled Oct. 3, 2001).&nbsp; Without ruling on how this\r\nprior decision impacts the law of the case, we note its findings are still\r\ntrue.&nbsp;\r\nStanley testified at trial that the\r\npuppies were in the fenced backyard, that they were of a size unable to go under\r\nthe fence, and that the fence was reinforced with mesh.&nbsp; Additionally,\r\nStanley testified it was unlikely a Shar-Pei would dig under the fence, and it\r\nwas unlikely the puppies would have left their mother, who was in the\r\nbackyard.&nbsp; Finally, Stanley presented evidence that although she received\r\nother animal control violation tickets from Officer Kirkpatrick, she had not\r\nbeen ticketed for allowing dogs to run at-large.&nbsp;\r\nThis evidence establishes Stanleyâ€™s\r\nbelief was not based on mere conjecture or speculation but ascertainable\r\ncircumstantial evidence.&nbsp; Importantly, â€œCircumstantial evidence is proof\r\nof a chain of facts and circumstances indicating the existence of a fact.&nbsp;\r\nThe law makes absolutely no distinction between the weight or value to be given\r\nto either direct or circumstantial evidence.â€&nbsp; Moriarty v. Garden\r\nSanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 337, 534 S.E.2d 672, 680\r\n(2000).&nbsp; Because there is circumstantial evidence tending to prove the\r\nallegations of the complaint, the trial court erred in granting a directed\r\nverdict as to the trespass cause of action.\r\n\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversion\r\n\r\nStanley also argues the trial court\r\nerred in directing a verdict on the conversion cause of action.&nbsp; We agree.\r\nâ€œConversion is the unauthorized\r\nassumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or personal\r\nchattels belonging to another, to the alteration of the condition or the\r\nexclusion of the ownerâ€™s rights.â€&nbsp; Crane v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Servs.,\r\nInc., 313 S.C. 70, 73, 437 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1993) (citations omitted).&nbsp;\r\nâ€œTo establish the tort of conversion, it is essential that the plaintiff\r\nestablish either title to or right to the possession of the personal property.â€&nbsp;\r\nId.&nbsp; â€œConversion is a wrongful act which emanates by either a\r\nwrongful taking or wrongful detention.â€&nbsp; Regions Bank v. Schmauch,\r\n354 S.C. 648, 667, 582 S.E.2d 432, 442 (Ct. App. 2003).&nbsp; â€œSince\r\nconversion is a wrongful act, it cannot arise from the exercise of a legal\r\nright.â€&nbsp; Castell v. Stephenson Finance Co., 244 S.C. 45, 51, 135\r\nS.E.2d 311, 313 (1964) (citation omitted).\r\nWe have already stated there was\r\nsufficient evidence to present the trespass cause of action to the jury because\r\nof evidence that Kirkpatrick opened the gate and removed the dogs.&nbsp; This\r\nsame evidence makes it improper to direct a verdict on the conversion cause of\r\naction because it is circumstantial evidence from which the jury might find\r\nKirkpatrick wrongfully took or detained the puppies.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the\r\norder of the trial court is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n[2] Respondent further testified that, at a prior court hearing on her\r\ncitations, Kirkpatrick told her, â€œIâ€™ll find your dogs.â€&nbsp; Kirkpatrick\r\ndenied the conversation.\r\n[3] This fee included a $76 fine for the puppy being at-large, a $20\r\nimpound fee, $28 for spaying, and $5 for a future rabies vaccination.\r\n[4] Section 9-5027(a) of the Columbia City Code states, â€œ[I]mpounded\r\nanimals not redeemed within five (5) days may thereafter be humanely destroyed\r\nby the animal control division.â€\r\n[5] 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 provides,\r\nin part: â€œEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,\r\ncustom, or usage, of any State . . . , subjects, or causes to be subjected, any\r\ncitizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges,\r\nor immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party\r\ninjured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for\r\nredress.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-482","title":"State v.

Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 557 S.E.2d 676 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating the elements of negligent misrepresentation); Ardis v. Cox, 314 S.C. 512, 431 S.E.2d 267 (Ct.

Banks and Banking Â§ 266 (Supp. 2005) (noting a bank has a duty under federal law to protect the confidentiality of its customersâ€™ nonpublic personal information).\r\n2.Â  The trial court properly directed a verdict in favor of the Bank and dismissed Postonâ€™s counterclaim based on Â§ 552 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts as the Restatement approach has not been adopted in this State with respect to the facts of this case:Â  ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 320 S.C. 143, 463 S.E.2d 618 (Ct.

Mahnke, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Furman Dabbs and his corporation, Dabbs Incorporated, appeal from a directed verdict for William Davis, Asset Management, Inc., and Pacific Life Insurance Company.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nPacific Life entered into separate, distinct, and non-exclusive contracts with Dabbs and Dabbs, Inc. (collectively â€œDabbsâ€) and Davis.Â  Both Dabbs and Davis are independent life insurance agents.Â  Pacific Life hired Davis as a Producer and assigned him to Dabbs, one of Pacific Lifeâ€™s Marketing Organizations, for back office support, product training, and administration.[2]Â  Dabbs was not a party to the Producer contract between Davis and Pacific Life.Â  The Marketing Organization contract between Pacific Life and Dabbs stated the following:\r\n    \r\n      No territory or product is assigned to Marketing Organization or its employees, agents or brokers exclusively . . . . [Pacific Life] may exclude any state or portion thereof from the territory from which Marketing Organization may submit applications.Â  Marketing Organization does not have authority to change or terminate any contract or agreement between a Producer and [Pacific Life].Â  [Pacific Life] may, at its sole option, refuse to contract with any proposed Producer.Â  [Pacific Life] may terminate any [Pacific Life] contract made with any Producer with or without cause at [Pacific Lifeâ€™s] discretion.Â Â  \r\n    \r\n    In all other aspects, the two contracts have similar applicable provisions.Â  Either party may terminate the contract at any time.Â  Furthermore, the contracts provide â€œ[n]o oral promises or representations shall be binding nor shall this contract be modified except by agreement in writing.â€Â  It is undisputed that neither the Marketing Organization contract nor the Producer contract was ever modified. \r\n    Davisâ€™ sales accounted for a substantial majority of Dabbsâ€™ Pacific Life business.Â  In 1999, Davis informed Dabbs he was interested in expanding his business, even suggesting that Dabbs and Davis form a partnership.Â  However, Dabbs admitted he was never interested in a partnership with Davis.Â  Pacific Life, through numerous contacts with Davis, expressed its sincere hope that Davis and Dabbs would â€œwork something out.â€Â  In addition, Pacific Life encouraged Dabbs to â€œwork something outâ€ with Davis, even suggesting a partnership in owning the Marketing Organization.\r\n    Dabbs never conveyed the suggested offer to Davis, and at a December 8, 1999 meeting, Davis indicated he would â€œgo ahead and build [his] companyâ€ without Dabbs and â€œwould either do it with Pacific Life, Manual Life or one of the other companies [he] was working with.â€Â  Pacific Life told Dabbs that Davis had inquired about forming a Marketing Organization contract, at which time Dabbs requested Pacific Life hold off offering the contract until Dabbs and Davis could agree on a new arrangement. \r\n    On December 14, 1999, Dabbs sent Davis a proposal by e-mail.Â  Among other things, the proposal suggested making Davis an officer in Dabbs, Inc. and giving Davis a twenty-point override on variable life products.Â  In discussions that followed, Dabbs allegedly told Davis the additional twenty points would be coming from Dabbs instead of Pacific Life because Dabbs would be paying Davis â€œunder the table.â€Â  Though Dabbs told Pacific Life that a new arrangement seemed inevitable, Davis informed Pacific Life that â€œhe wasnâ€™t pleased and that [Dabbs] was planning on paying him under the table.â€Â  Because Davis did not intend on working with Dabbs any further, Pacific Life offered Davis a Marketing Organization contract.Â  He subsequently accepted on December 22, 1999, but not before he notified Dabbs in writing that he was no longer interested in an arrangement with Dabbs.Â  His e-mail stated that he was â€œtruly sorry this [had] come to such an end,â€ but he had â€œabsolutely no intention of getting involved in litigation betweenâ€ Dabbs and Pacific Life, signifying his concern with the possible â€œunder the tableâ€ payments of points. \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Dabbs filed a complaint against Davis, Asset Management, Inc. (Davisâ€™ company), and Pacific Life (collectively â€œRespondentsâ€) on eighteen causes of action, including: breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, unfair trade practices, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  Respondents moved for a directed verdict at the end of the trial in September 2003.Â  The trial judge took the matter under advisement and requested that both parties submit memorandums.Â  The judge also requested that Respondents submit a proposed order granting a directed verdict on all causes of action, except in regards to possible unpaid commissions required by the contract between Dabbs and Pacific Life.Â  Both parties offered extensive oral arguments as to the unpaid commissions issue, and the trial judge took this matter under advisement as well.\r\n    On February 5, 2004, Dabbs filed a memorandum in opposition to a directed verdict, followed by Respondentsâ€™ reply memorandum.Â  Later that February, Dabbs filed a motion for a mistrial because he claimed the jury was dismissed prior to the resolution of factual issues.Â  The trial judge ordered a directed verdict for Respondents on all causes of action.Â  He subsequently denied Dabbsâ€™ motions for reconsideration and mistrial.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n    In ruling on motions for a directed verdict, â€œthe trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions and to deny the motions where either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.â€Â  Strange v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994).Â  â€œWhen considering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.â€Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 308, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002).Â  â€œIn essence, we must determine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€Â  Bultman v. Barber, 277 S.C. 5, 7, 281 S.E.2d 791, 792 (1981).Â  â€œIf the evidence is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the jury.â€Â  Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998).\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n I.Â  Fiduciary Duty\r\nDabbs claims the trial judge erred in directing a verdict for Respondents because a fiduciary relationship between the parties was breached.Â  We disagree.\r\n    \r\n\r\n  South Carolina Appellate Court Rules specify that an appellant brief â€œshall be divided into as many parts as there are issues to be argued. At the head of each part, the particular issue to be addressed shall be set forth in distinctive type, followed by discussion and citations of authority.â€Â  Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR.Â  South Carolina law states that â€œshort, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for review.â€Â  Glasscock, Inc. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nDabbs did not cite any supporting authority for his position.Â  Dabbs directs this court to his memorandum in opposition to the motion for a directed verdict, even though this argument was not restated in his brief, and he did not make a single citation to any error in the trial judgeâ€™s order in the body of his argument.Â  Further, Dabbsâ€™ arguments are merely conclusory statements.Â  Therefore, Dabbs abandoned the issues on appeal, and this court need not address them.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (stating Appellant was deemed to have abandoned an issue for which he failed to provide any argument or supporting authority); R &amp; G Const., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regional Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 437, 540 S.E.2d 113, 120 (declaring an issue is deemed abandoned if argument in appellate brief is only conclusory).Â  \r\nII. Discharge of the jury \r\nDabbs also claims the trial judge erred in discharging the jury prior to ruling on the directed verdict motion.Â  We disagree.\r\n  â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  â€œAn appellate court may not, of course, reverse for any reason appearing in the record. The losing party must first try to convince the lower court it is has ruled wrongly and then, if that effort fails, convince the appellate court that the lower court erred.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 421-422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724&nbsp;(2000) (emphasis in original).Â  â€œImposing this preservation requirement on the appellant is meant to enable the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.â€Â  Id. at 422, 526 S.E.2d at 724. \r\n  The trial judge sufficiently informed the parties that he was taking the motion for a directed verdict under advisement, but was â€œ100 percent sure that [he was] going to grant a directed verdict on some claimsâ€ and â€œ99.9 percent sure that [he was] going to grant directed verdict on all of the other claims except for breach of contract.â€Â  The judge also asked Dabbsâ€™ counsel if he needed a jury to decide if Pacific Life breached its contract with Dabbs and any damages that may have arisen from that breach.Â  Dabbsâ€™ counsel replied, â€œI donâ€™t think so.â€Â  In a lengthy discussion, the trial judge told the parties his thoughts as to the directed verdict motion, and he requested that Respondents draft a proposed order to that effect.Â  Dabbs did not object to the juryâ€™s dismissal during the discussions or for almost a month afterward.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  \r\n  III.Â  Vested commissions \r\nDabbs claims the trial judge erred in overlooking its previous ruling that Pacific Life owed Dabbs vested commissions from the breach of contract claim.Â  We disagree.\r\n Dabbs misstates the trial judgeâ€™s decision.Â  The trial judge did not overlook the vested commission issue, as Dabbs suggests.Â  Instead, he chose to direct a verdict for Respondents on all claims.Â  While the trial judge suggested at trial that he might consider damages for breach of contract, he did not make a final decision.Â  Furthermore, he requested the parties to thoroughly brief the issue.Â  In his final order dated March 1, 2004, the trial judge granted Respondentsâ€™ motion for directed verdict â€œon all causes of action.â€\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n          [1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n  [2] As an entity, the Marketing Organization procures its sales through the Producer, who is appointed by Pacific Life.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-507","title":"Cook v.

Cook acquired a parcel of real estate from Arthur Boyd in February 1959.Â  A survey prepared at the request of Cook revealed the property, thereafter referred to as the â€œArthur Boydâ€ tract, contained 31.08 acres of land. \r\nIn December 1997, Cook conveyed a portion of the Arthur Boyd tract to his son, Appellant, and another portion of the property to his daughter, Wilma C. Kay (Respondent).Â  Maxine Dawes, a real estate broker, prepared the deeds for Cook.Â  In both deeds, Cook reserved a life estate for himself and his wife.Â  In July 1999, Cook executed new deeds releasing the reserved life estates.Â  The new deeds contained legal descriptions identical to those in the deeds formally prepared by Dawes. Â \r\nThe deed conveyed to Appellant contained the following language:\r\n\r\n  ALL AND SINGULAR that certain parcel of land situate in Simpson Creek Township, Horry County, South Carolina and containing fifteen 15 acres, more or less described as follows:\r\n  Beginning at the ditch corner on the East side of the Arthur Boyd tract, in the lands of Henry Boyd: thence traveling in a Northwestern direction approximately 400 feet to center ditch in said tract; thence going about Northeast along ditch through the center of said 31.08 acre tract to the lands of H. C. Stevens, this being the western side of the Arthur Boyd Tract. \r\n\r\nThe deed conveyed to Respondent contained the following language:\r\n\r\n  ALL AND SINGULAR that certain parcel of land situate in Simpson Creek Township, Horry County, South Carolina and containing fifteen (15) acres, more or less described as follows:\r\n  This is the remaining half of the Arthur Boyd tract, from which the left half was this date conveyed to Vernon Cook; this being the eastern portion bounded by lands of Henry Boyd. \r\n\r\nCook passed away in 2000.Â  Thereafter, Respondent hired Eric C. Perry to prepare a survey of her property.Â  Perryâ€™s survey indicated Respondent owned the eastern half of the Arthur Boyd tract, containing 15.569 acres, and Appellant owned the western half, containing 15.52 acres.Â  Appellant then hired Robert D. Inman to prepare a survey of his property.Â  That survey reflected Appellant owned the western 18.19 acres of the tract, and Respondent owned the eastern 12.8 acres of the tract. \r\nAppellant filed a complaint alleging the survey prepared by Perry was incorrect and requesting the court affirm the survey prepared by Inman.Â  Respondent filed a counterclaim alleging the survey prepared by Inman was incorrect and requesting the affirmation of the survey prepared by Perry.Â  The master to whom the matter was referred found the grantor intended the property to be divided equally, with Appellant receiving the western half and Respondent receiving the eastern half of the tract.Â  Therefore, the master found Perryâ€™s survey controlling because it correctly divided the property in half.Â  This appeal follows. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA boundary dispute is an action at law.Â  Bodiford v. Spanish Oak Farms, Inc., 317 S.C. 539, 544, 455 S.E.2d 194, 197 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  In an action at law tried before a master-in-equity where the appeal is based on an alleged error of fact, this court must affirm the masterâ€™s order if any evidence reasonably supports his factual findings.Â  Carjow, L.L.C. v. Simmons, 349 S.C. 514, 519, 563 S.E.2d 359, 362 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues the deeds, when construed together, lend themselves to more than one interpretation.Â  Therefore, he asserts extrinsic evidence should have been considered by the master in determining the boundary lines of the tract.Â  We affirm.\r\nThe main object in construing a deed is to ascertain the intention of the grantor from the language used in the deed.Â  Lake View Acres Dev. Co. v. Tindal, 306 S.C. 477, 479, 412 S.E.2d 457, 458 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  â€œThe vital question is the intent of the grantor at the time the deed is executed.â€Â  Garrett v. Locke, 309 S.C. 94, 98, 419 S.E.2d 842, 845 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  When there is no ambiguity in the description of the property conveyed, the grantorâ€™s intent must be determined from within the four corners of the deed.Â  See Bellamy v. Bellamy, 292 S.C. 107, 111, 355 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  When the intention of the grantor is not accurately expressed in the deed, extrinsic evidence may be admitted to explain it.Â  Smith v. Du Rant, 236 S.C. 80, 90, 113 S.E.2d 349, 354 (1960).Â  \r\nWhen construed together, the deeds in this case indicate the grantorâ€™s intent to divide the property equally between Appellant and Respondent.Â  Appellantâ€™s deed contains a general description of the boundaries of his tract.Â  Appellant asserts Inman correctly surveyed his portion of the property using such boundary descriptions.Â  He also argues that because Inman and Perry discovered different boundary lines, the deeds must be capable of more than one inference.Â  However, the last sentence of Appellantâ€™s deed description states that this is to be the â€œwestern sideâ€ of the Arthur Boyd tract.Â  â€œ[I]f a general description is followed by a clause summing up the intention of the parties as to the premises conveyed, such clause has a controlling effect on all prior phrases used in the description. . . .â€Â  Lake View, 306 S.C. at 480, 412 S.E.2d at 459.Â  Therefore, the controlling phrase in Appellantâ€™s deed indicates he is to retain the western half of the tract.Â  The grantor clearly intended that Appellant and Respondent equally divide his property.Â  \r\nThe intent of the grantor to divide this property in half is further illustrated by the language in Respondentâ€™s deed.Â  The deed states: â€œThis is the remaining half of the Arthur Boyd tract, from which the left half was this date conveyed to Vernon Cook . . . .â€Â  Because no other boundary description is given, only one interpretation is possible.Â  Again, the grantor clearly intended to equally divide his property, with the western half of the tract going to Appellant and the eastern half going to Respondent. We find the grantorâ€™s intent is clearly established from within the four corners of the deeds.Â  Therefore, the master was correct in finding the deeds are unambiguous.\r\nAppellant next argues the master placed too much emphasis on the acreage requirement in determining the intent of the grantor.Â  We affirm. \r\nThe master referenced the fact that both deeds state fifteen acres, more or less, is to be conveyed.Â  â€œIn locating land, resort is had first to natural boundaries, next to artificial monuments, then to adjacent boundaries, and last to courses and distances.â€Â  Garrett, 309 S.C. at 98-99, 419 S.E.2d at 845.Â  Acreage is ordinarily of little or no importance in determining boundaries of land.Â  Phillips v. Du Bose, 223 S.C. 224, 232, 75 S.E.2d 56, 60 (1953).Â  However, the rules for determining disputed boundaries are flexible and subject to modification depending upon the particular facts of each case.Â  Garrett, 309 S.C. at 98, 419 S.E.2d at 845.Â  As noted above, the grantorâ€™s intent is clearly shown by language other than the acreage amount.Â  However, the acreage requirement reiterates the grantorâ€™s intent to equally divide the property.Â  Accordingly, the master cited the acreage amount in addition to other language quoted from the deeds.Â  Therefore, the master did not err in referencing the acreage requirement in his ruling.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-508","title":"Brewer v.

Trundy, of North Charleston, and Thomas Hayden Hesse, of Summerville, for Appellant.\r\n        Douglas M. Zayicek, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Dawn Brewer appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Myrtle Beach Farms Company, Inc., doing business as the Myrtle Beach Pavilion, on her claims for negligence and inadequate warnings of the dangers associated with riding its roller coaster, the â€œMad Mouse.â€Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 31, 2000, Brewer was spending the day at Myrtle Beach Pavilion, an amusement park, while vacationing with her family when she decided to ride the Mad Mouse.Â  The Mad Mouse is a ten-car roller coaster designed to speed around a track with hairpin turns at approximately 30 miles per hour.Â  Several clearly visible signs near the entrance of the roller coaster warn that the Mad Mouse â€œBY ITS VERY NATURE CREATES FORCES &amp; SPEEDS THAT MAY NOT BE ACCEPTABLE TO SOME RIDERS WITH Pre-existing medical CONDITIONSâ€ and those with neck or back problems â€œMUST NOT BOARD THE MAD MOUSE.â€Â  Although Brewer had pre-existing back problems stemming from a car accident and â€œdidnâ€™t want to get on it,â€ she did not read or heed the warnings and boarded the roller coaster.Â  \r\nDespite a sign that warned riders to â€œSIT UP STRAIGHT WITH BACK &amp; SHOULDERS AGAINST THE SEAT BACK WITH HEADS ERECT TO AVOID INJURY,â€ Brewer was riding the Mad Mouse with her head leaning out of the side of the car and her eyes closed.Â  The Mad Mouse went around a curve on the track and came to an abrupt stop that thrust Brewer against the lap bar restraint.Â  Brewer waited on the stopped Mad Mouse for several minutes while Pavilion maintenance personnel inspected it.Â  Then the Mad Mouse started up again and completed its trip around the track.Â  After Brewer exited the ride, she spoke to maintenance personnel who informed her the Mad Mouse was completely controlled by a computer system, and the computerâ€™s safety mechanism had likely shut down the ride because one car was traveling at a higher rate of speed than another.Â  \r\nBrewer waited until the following day to see a doctor in the Myrtle Beach area who told her she had bruised ribs and gave her pain medication.Â  When Brewer retuned home from vacation, she saw her chiropractor who diagnosed her with compressive spinal fractures.Â  \r\nOn June 23, 2003, Brewer brought suit against the Pavilion and the roller coasterâ€™s designer S&amp;S Power, Inc., formerly known as Arrow Dynamic, Inc., whom she later voluntarily dismissed, for injuries she sustained while riding the Mad Mouse.Â  The Pavilion moved for summary judgment.Â  At the hearing, William Avery, a safety expert, testified the rideâ€™s computerâ€™s safety feature engaged because of a possible mechanical, electrical, or operational malfunction but that he could not determine which possibility caused the Mad Mouse to stop.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to the Pavilion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Negligence\r\nBrewer argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Pavilion.Â  Brewer contends her expert presented specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nSummary judgment is inappropriate when facts are presented on which reasonable minds could differ.Â  Allen v. Long Mfg. NC, Inc., 332 S.C. 422, 428, 505 S.E.2d 354, 357 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  It is not enough that one create an inference which is not reasonable or an issue of fact that is not genuine.Â  Id. at 429, 505 S.E.2d 357-58.Â  â€œThe judge is not required to single out some one morsel of evidence and attach to it great significance when patently the evidence is introduced solely in a vain attempt to create an issue of fact. . . .â€Â  Main v. Corley, 281 S.C. 525, 527, 316 S.E.2d 406, 407 (1984).Â  \r\nTo establish a prima facie case for negligence, a plaintiff must prove the following elements: 1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, 2) a breach of that duty by negligent act or omission, and 3) damage proximately caused by the breach. Â Huggins v. Citibank, N.A., 355 S.C. 329, 332, 585 S.E.2d 275, 276&nbsp;(2003).Â  South Carolina does not recognize the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, but negligence may be proved by circumstantial or direct evidence.Â  Chaney v. Burgess,&nbsp; 246 S.C. 261, 266, 143 S.E.2d 521, 523&nbsp;(1965). â€œWhere circumstantial evidence is relied upon to establish liability, the plaintiff must show such circumstances as would justify the inference that his injuries were due to the negligent act of the defendant, and not leave the question to mere conjecture or speculation.â€Â  Id. \r\nExpert testimony on the question of the causal connection between a plaintiffâ€™s injuries and the acts of the defendant must satisfy the â€œmost probablyâ€ rule.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 111, 410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991).Â  It is not sufficient for the expert to testify that the injury might or could have resulted from the alleged cause, but the testimony must indicate the opinion represents his professional judgment as to the most likely one among the possible causes.Â  Id.Â  \r\nBrewer contends she presented sufficient circumstantial evidence through her expert Averyâ€™s testimony, to survive a summary judgment motion.Â  Avery testified the Mad Mouse came to a sudden stop because of an operational, mechanical, or electrical malfunction, but stated that it â€œis not possible at this time to reverse engineer and conclude whether the breakdown was mechanical, electrical, or operational.â€Â  Avery alleged, â€œthe Pavilionâ€™s failure to properly document the event prevents us from knowing exactly how [the Pavilion] acted negligently prior to the malfunction.â€Â  Avery maintained the Pavilion â€œdeviated from the standard of careâ€ by failing to document the event that caused the Mad Mouseâ€™s safety feature to engage.\r\nAveryâ€™s testimony does not create a genuine issue of material fact.Â  It is Brewerâ€™s burden to show the Pavilion was negligent in the rideâ€™s computer shutting down, and nowhere does Avery allege the Pavilionâ€™s actions most probably injured Brewer.Â  Avery opined the rideâ€™s computer likely shut down because two of the cars were too close together due to an operational, mechanical, or electrical malfunction.Â  However, Avery never discusses why the cars may have been too close together, what maintenance or inspections would have corrected this situation, or that proper maintenance and inspections were not done by the Pavilion.Â  Avery presented no testimony or evidence that he spoke to Pavilion personnel regarding the incident or consulted any engineering experts. Moreover, nothing the Pavilion did or failed to do after the accident is proof of negligence before the incident.Â  \r\nThe Pavilion presented evidence, through the testimony of its maintenance supervisor, that Pavilion staff inspected the Mad Mouse the morning of the incident and found no problems.Â  Additionally, the Pavilion showed the ride shut down for safety as designed by the manufacturer.Â  The Pavilion also presented detailed safety inspection records showing the inspections complied with the manufacturerâ€™s specifications and industry standards. Additionally, no evidence was presented to show Pavilion personnel could have caused an operational malfunction in light of the Pavilionâ€™s evidence the Mad Mouse was completely operated by a computer, designed by the rideâ€™s manufacturer.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the Pavilion because Brewer presented no evidence showing the Pavilion caused any problem to the Mad Mouse or knew, or should have known, of any problem with the ride.Â  \r\n2.Â  Warnings\r\nBrewer argues the trial court erred in finding as a matter of law that the Pavilionâ€™s warnings were adequate and that any further warnings would have been futile.Â  We disagree.\r\nNeither party disputes the question of whether a roller coaster needs a warning to be safe, so the only question at issue is whether the warnings the Pavilion provided for the Mad Mouse were adequate as a matter of law.Â Â  \r\nGenerally, the question of the adequacy of the warning is one of fact for the jury as long as evidence has been presented that the warning was inadequate.Â  Allen v. Long Mfg. NC, Inc., 332 S.C. 422, 428, 505 S.E.2d 354, 357 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  A product bearing a warning that the product is safe for use if the user follows the warning is neither defective nor unreasonably dangerous; therefore, the seller is not liable for any injuries.Â  Id.Â  Further, a seller is not required to warn of dangers or potential dangers that are generally known and recognized.Â  Dema v. Shore Enters., 312 S.C. 528, 530 435 S.E.2d 875, 876 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  It follows, then, that a product cannot be deemed either defective or unreasonably dangerous if a danger associated with the product is one that the productâ€™s users generally recognize.Â  Anderson v. Green Bull, Inc., 322 S.C. 268, 271, 471 S.E.2d 708, 710 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nBrewer presented no evidence the Pavilionâ€™s warnings were inadequate.Â  Several signs, clearly visible to anyone boarding the roller coaster warned that the Mad Mouse:Â  â€œBY ITS VERY NATURE CREATES FORCES &amp; SPEEDS THAT MAY NOT BE ACCEPTABLE TO SOME RIDERS WITH Pre-existing medical CONDITIONSâ€ and those with neck or back problems â€œMUST NOT BOARD THE MAD MOUSE.â€Â  Another sign warned riders to â€œSIT UP STRAIGHT WITH BACK &amp; SHOULDERS AGAINST THE SEAT BACK WITH HEADS ERECT TO AVOID INJURY.â€Â  Brewer testified that she watched the Mad Mouse for several minutes then decided to ride even though she â€œdidnâ€™t want to get on itâ€ and had a pre-existing back injury.Â  When asked at deposition whether she read or heeded the warnings, Brewer responded, â€œno sir, I did not.Â  I didnâ€™t need to read the warning signs anyway.â€Â  Brewer also testified that she rode the Mad Mouse with her head leaned over the side of the car, directly contrary to the warnings.Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, Brewerâ€™s expertâ€™s testimony that additional warnings were needed does not create a genuine issue of material fact that the warnings were inadequate.Â  Avery never states what additional warnings are required, and the signs comport with the required warnings from the rideâ€™s manufacturer.Â  The fact that the ride shut down and caused cars on the track to brake does not mean that the force created was dissimilar to the other jolts and forces normally associated with the Mad Mouse.Â  Brewerâ€™s expert provided no evidence whatsoever that the force created by the event was different from any other force or stress created by the inherent nature of a roller coaster.Â  Moreover, Brewer clearly stated that further warnings would not have made a difference and would have been futile under the circumstances.Â  Because Brewer presented no genuine evidence the warnings were inadequate, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s finding the warnings were adequate as a matter of law.Â  For the reasons stated above, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY, and SHORT, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-509","title":"Bales v.

City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\n        We have not found any jurisprudence in South Carolina that addresses damages resulting from an injury to a pet.Â  However, a limited number of cases decided throughout the United States have considered what damages are recoverable due to injuries to a dog.Â  Typically, the courts have limited the award of damages to the dogâ€™s market value in view of the general recognition of dogs as personal property.Â  4 Am. Jur. 2d Animals Â§Â§ 6 and 165 (1995); see State v. Langford, 55 S.C. 322, 33 S.E. 370 (1899). \r\n        A New York case, with facts similar to the case sub judice, held that the owner of a cat could not recover for mental distress after seeing it attacked by a dog because the dogâ€™s owner was not grossly negligent and did not willfully intend to cause the distress.Â  Buchanan v. Stout, 108 N.Y.S. 38 (N.Y. App. Div. 1908).Â  Any recovery of damages, the court concluded, would be limited to the pecuniary loss to the owner resulting from the death of her cat.Â  Id.;Â  but see \r\n        Peloquin v. Calcasieu Parish Police Jury, \r\n        367 So.2d 1246, 1251 (La. Ct. App. 1979) (holding that an owner of a animal may sue for damages for conversion thereof and â€œdamages may include awards for mental anguish, humiliation, etc. as well as special and/or actual damages.â€); 4 Am. Jur. 2d Animals Â§ 164 at 508 (1995) (stating that â€œ[a]lthough recovery has been denied for claims based upon sentimental or fanciful value placed on animals, damages for mental distress are a proper item of recovery for death or injury to animals such as . . . dogs, provided that the owner presents sufficient evidence of emotional distress.â€). \r\n        Therefore, we hold that South Carolina law does not support a cause of action for emotional distress for injury to oneâ€™s pet.Â  Furthermore, we hold that a claim for lost wages resulting from injury to an animal is not actionable because a dog is considered personal property under our law.Â  Thus, we modify the trial courtâ€™s judgment, awarding damages only for reimbursement of veterinary expenses in the amount of $1,258.10.\r\n        AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n        HEARN, C.J., BEATTY, and SHORT, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-510","title":"State v.

Clare, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attoney General W. Rutledge Martin, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia; and Solicitor Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Gregory Tucker was convicted of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, and possession of a knife during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Tucker appeals, arguing the trial court erred in denying his challenge of the Stateâ€™s peremptory strikes.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nTucker, an African-American male, was indicted for first-degree criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, first-degree burglary, and possession of a knife during the commission of a violent crime.Â  During jury selection for Tuckerâ€™s trial in March 2003, the State used its peremptory challenges to strike Juror #53, a black male; Juror #15, a black male; and Juror #142, a black female.Â  Before the jury was sworn, Tucker made a motion under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), challenging the Stateâ€™s use of its peremptory strikes to exclude black jurors.Â  The State explained that it struck Juror #53 because he had served time on a â€œcontempt charge for failure to pay child support.Â  He also had a Magistrate level drug conviction.â€Â  The State said it struck Juror #15 because the victim in this case was a female and the juror had made comments during the qualification process that elicited â€œa negative attitude toward (sic) women.â€Â  Finally, the State argued it struck Juror #142 because she had â€œ[m]agistrate level convictions for drugs and for breach of trust.â€Â  As evidence of pretext, Tucker pointed out that the third juror seated by both parties was a white male who had a magistrate level offense for driving under suspension.Â  The State explained that â€œthere may, based on witness testimony, be some evidence brought in with regards to drugs and thatâ€™s why [it] kept all drug convictions out.â€Â  The trial court held the State had shown â€œvalid reasons for striking the jurors that were excusedâ€ and denied Tuckerâ€™s motion.[2]\r\nThe jury found Tucker guilty of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, and possession of a knife during commission of a violent crime.Â  The jury acquitted him of the first-degree burglary charge.Â  Tucker made a motion for a new trial based on his challenge of the peremptory strikes.Â  Though no evidence of drugs came out at trial, the trial court denied Tuckerâ€™s motion for a new trial, finding Tucker did not show the strikes were pretextual. \r\nThe trial court sentenced Tucker to 30 years imprisonment for criminal sexual conduct, 30 years concurrent for kidnapping, and 5 years consecutive for possession of a knife during the commission of a violent crime.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTucker claims the trial court erred in denying his challenge to the Stateâ€™s peremptory strikes because they were racially motivated.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the striking of a venire person on the basis of race or gender.Â  Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 89 (1986); State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 211, 499 S.E.2d 209, 211 (1998).Â  As a result, a â€œtrial judge must hold a Batson hearing when members of a cognizable racial group or gender are struck and the opposing party requests a hearing.â€Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 629, 515 S.E.2d 88, 90 (1999).Â  Once a Batson hearing has been requested, the proponent of the strike must offer a race or gender-neutral explanation for excusing the juror.Â  Id.Â  In return, the opponent must show the race or gender-neutral explanation was mere pretext, which is generally established by showing the party did not strike a similarly situated member of another race or gender.Â  Id. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 91.Â  \r\nThe opponent of the strike carries the ultimate burden of persuading the trial court the challenged party exercised strikes in a discriminatory manner.Â  State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 124, 470 S.E.2d 366, 372 (1996).Â  â€œIn deciding whether the opponent of a strike has carried the burden of persuasion, a court must undertake a sensitive inquiry into the circumstantial and direct evidence of intent.â€ Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 91.Â  â€œA strike must be examined in light of the circumstances under which it is exercised, including an examination of the explanations offered for other strikes.â€Â  Id.Â  Under some circumstances, the explanation given by the proponent may be so fundamentally implausible that the trial judge may determine the explanation was mere pretext, even without a showing of disparate treatment.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWhether a Batson violation has occurred must be determined by examining the totality of the facts and circumstances in the record.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe trial courtâ€™s findings regarding purposeful discrimination are accorded great deference and will be set aside on appeal only if clearly erroneous.â€Â  Id. at 630, 515 S.E.2d at 91.Â  Because the trial courtâ€™s findings regarding purposeful discrimination rest largely upon an evaluation of the credibility of the attorney making the strikes, we give those findings great deference.Â  State v. Patterson, 307 S.C. 180, 182, 414 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1992).Â  However, where the record does not support the attorneyâ€™s stated reason for the strike, the trial courtâ€™s findings must be overturned.Â  Id. at 182-83, 414 S.E.2d at 157.\r\nWe hold Tucker did not carry his burden of persuasion in proving the State engaged in purposeful discrimination during the jury selection process.Â  In this case, the Stateâ€™s primary reason for striking two jurors was because they had drug convictions, and counsel for the State was concerned with these jurorsâ€™ reactions to testimony and evidence of drug use that potentially could come in during the trial of the case.Â  Though there is some confusion as to the criminal history of Juror #26, a white male, there is no doubt he did not have a drug conviction.[3]Â  Tucker did not point to any other seated jurors of another race who were similarly situated to the stricken venire persons.Â  The State struck the third juror for questionable comments regarding women, a potential problem because the victim was a female.Â  Therefore, the record contains no indication that the Stateâ€™s reasons for striking the three black jurors were motivated by purposeful discrimination.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY, and SHORT, J.J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Judge James Brogdon, Jr., qualified the jury, but Judge J. Michael Baxley presided over the trial itself.Â  \r\n[3] During the Batson hearing, the State presented that Juror #26 had a six-year-old conviction for driving under suspension.Â  However, during the post-trial motions, the State did not correct Tucker when he represented to the trial court that Juror #26 had a conviction for driving under the influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
