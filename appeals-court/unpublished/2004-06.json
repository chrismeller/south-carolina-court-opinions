Culbertson, of Georgetown, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\nEllis R. Lesemann and Amy Y. Jenkins, both of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\nCharles T. Smith, of Georgetown, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Century 21 Grimes &amp; Associates, \r\n  Inc. commenced this action against John E. Benford alleging breach of contract \r\n  and seeking a real estate commission in the amount of $18,500.Â  The trial court \r\n  granted judgment to Century 21 in the amount of $9,250.Â  From this ruling, Century \r\n  21 and Benford appeal.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis cause of action arises out of the sale of \r\n  a 160-acre tract in Williamsburg County owned by Benford.Â  On January 28, 2000, \r\n  Benford published the following advertisement in the Georgetown Times:\r\n\r\nHUNTING PARADISE for sale.Â  160 acres with hunting \r\n  road, deer stand, duck pond and an abundance of wild turkey, quail and rabbits.Â  \r\n  12x65 trailer ready for hunting or very serene living.Â  Shown by appointment \r\n  only or one time listing for all Real Estate agents.Â  $200,000.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the notice, Truitt Owens, a real \r\n  estate broker for Century 21, met with Benford and had Benford sign a one-time \r\n  showing agreement that identified six prospective purchasers for the property.Â  \r\n  Stuart Ballard was listed as one of the prospective purchasers.Â  The showing \r\n  agreement stated in part:\r\n\r\nÂ [I]n consideration of the revelation of the identity of \r\n  said purchasers and the efforts of Century 21 Grimes &amp; Associates, Inc., \r\n  to bring about a sale of said property, the undersigned does hereby acknowledge \r\n  an obligation to pay Century 21 Grimes &amp; Associates, Inc. a commission equal \r\n  to 10% of the sales price upon consummation of a sale of the described property \r\n  to the prospective purchasers referred to herein.Â  It is further acknowledged \r\n  that the aforesaid commission obligation shall be binding upon [Benford] with \r\n  respect to any sale made to, or on behalf of, said purchasers during the period \r\n  of 360 days from the date hereof.Â  \r\n\r\nAlthough Benford entered into the \r\n  showing agreement, he refused to sign an exclusive listing agreement with Owens \r\n  or any other broker or realtor because he wished to retain the right to sell \r\n  the property himself.Â  Benford told Owens he would pay a 10% commission to the \r\n  realtor who brought him the ultimate purchaser.Â  \r\nBallard, who had been looking for property like \r\n  Benfordâ€™s for over a year, also noticed Benfordâ€™s advertisement and placed a \r\n  call to his real estate agent, Chip Lachicotte of the Lachicotte Company, to \r\n  obtain more information on the property.Â  Ballard had a long-standing relationship \r\n  with Lachicotte and the Lachicotte Company.Â  Lachicotte had worked closely with \r\n  Ballard on several prior occasions, providing him with fact sheets, plats, and \r\n  other information on potential properties, as well as walking certain properties \r\n  with Ballard.Â  Ballard was unable to reach Lachicotte when he called him, as \r\n  Lachicotte was en route to Ballardâ€™s office.Â  At the suggestion of one of Ballardâ€™s \r\n  friends, he then called Owens to gather some information on the property.Â  Owens \r\n  did not have the information Ballard sought; however, Lachicotte arrived at \r\n  Ballardâ€™s office moments later and provided Ballard with the information.Â  Lachicotte \r\n  obtained plats and other information on the property for Ballard.Â  \r\nDuring this process, Les Oâ€™Hara, another agent \r\n  in Lachicotteâ€™s office, was working with another individual interested in the \r\n  property, Robert Norris.Â  Norris, who was not listed as a prospective purchaser \r\n  on Owensâ€™s listing agreement, eventually offered to purchase the property.Â  \r\n  Benford accepted and notified Owens of Norrisâ€™s offer.Â  Upon learning of Norrisâ€™s \r\n  offer, Owens ceased marketing the property.Â  The contract with Norris fell through \r\n  before closing.Â  Benford did not immediately notify Owens that the closing did \r\n  not occur.Â  \r\nLachicotte continued to work with Ballard on pursuing \r\n  the property, including thoroughly walking the property and wading through knee-deep \r\n  water on the tract.Â  Ballard made an offer on the property through the Lachicotte \r\n  Company for $185,000.00, and Benford accepted.Â  The Lachicotte Company drafted \r\n  and presented the contract of sale and held and delivered the earnest money \r\n  to Benford.Â  The contract of sale provided that Benford would pay the Lachicotte \r\n  Company a commission on the sale of the property.Â  On April 13, 2000, Benford \r\n  conveyed the property to Ballard for the contract price.Â  He paid the Lachicotte \r\n  Company a 10% commission of $18,500.Â  \r\nOn May 18, 2000, Owensâ€™ employer, Century 21, brought \r\n  this action against Benford seeking $18,500 plus prejudgment interest for breach \r\n  of contract to pay a real estate commission.Â  Benford answered and brought a \r\n  third party claim against the Lachicotte Company for reimbursement of the real \r\n  estate commission he paid to them.Â  The trial court ruled in favor of Century \r\n  21 in the amount of $9,250 based upon a 5% real estate commission and denied \r\n  Benfordâ€™s reimbursement request.Â  Benford and Century 21 appealed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for a real estate brokerâ€™s commission \r\n  is an action at law.Â  See United Farm Agency v. Malanuk, 284 S.C. \r\n  382, 383, 325 S.E.2d 544, 545 (1985).Â  In an action at law, tried without a \r\n  jury, the trial courtâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless \r\n  no evidence exists which reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s findings or the \r\n  decision is controlled by an error of law.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City \r\n  of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85-86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBenford argues the trial court erred in finding him \r\n  liable for breach of contract for refusing to pay a sales commission to Owens.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nA broker suing to recover his commission has the burden \r\n  of proving all the conditions precedent to his right to performance have occurred.Â  \r\n  Chambers v. Pingree, 351 S.C. 442, 451, 570 S.E.2d 528, 532 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002).Â  In this case, the showing agreement specifically stated that Century \r\n  21 was entitled to a commission in consideration of (1) the revelation of the \r\n  identity of the purchasers and (2) the efforts of Century 21 in bringing about \r\n  the sale of the property.Â  The agreementâ€™s second condition precedent is consistent \r\n  with South Carolina case law, which provides a real estate broker generally \r\n  earns a commission when the broker acts during his agency as the efficient or \r\n  procuring cause of a sale.Â  Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 487, 486 \r\n  S.E.2d 771, 775 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Although the actual agreement for the sale \r\n  may be made by the owner without the aid of the broker, the broker will be regarded \r\n  as the procuring cause if his intervention is the foundation upon which the \r\n  negotiation resulting in the sale is begun.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThere is no evidence in the record that supports \r\n  a conclusion that Owens was the procuring cause of the sale or that he was successful \r\n  in any efforts he made toward the sale. Owens admitted that Ballard was never \r\n  his client.Â  He stated he had spoken with Ballard over the years and knew he \r\n  was interested in property similar to Benfordâ€™s.Â  Owens testified that he called \r\n  Ballard after signing the agreement with Benford and told him about the property.Â  \r\n  He related that although Ballard seemed very excited during that first call, \r\n  his enthusiasm had cooled by a second call and during the third call Ballard \r\n  â€œbrushed him off.â€Â  Owens acknowledged that he did nothing with Ballard other \r\n  than make those telephone calls.Â  He stated he never took Ballard to the property, \r\n  never took any offers from Ballard, and never held any earnest money.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nOwensâ€™ slight contact with Ballard was in no way \r\n  the foundation upon which the negotiations began between Ballard and Benford.Â  \r\n  While Owens merely had a telephone conversation with Ballard, Lachicotte provided \r\n  Ballard with plats and other written information on the property, walked the \r\n  property with Ballard, drafted and proposed the contract, and held and delivered \r\n  the earnest money.Â  Clearly, Lachicotte was intimately involved in pursuing \r\n  the property and closing on the sale.Â  It was Lachicotteâ€™s diligent and continuous \r\n  efforts that ultimately brought about the sale between Benford and Ballard.Â  \r\n  Lachicotte, not Owens, was the procuring cause of the sale.Â  \r\nCentury 21 contends Owens did market the \r\n  property by contacting the prospective purchasers listed on the one-time showing \r\n  agreement, identifying and contacting additional prospective purchasers, and \r\n  taking prospective purchasers to the property.Â  We find these actions Owens \r\n  took in marketing the property to other potential purchasers did not entitle \r\n  Century 21 to a commission.Â  \r\n\r\nA broker is never entitled to commissions for unsuccessful \r\n  efforts.Â  The risk of failure is wholly his.Â  The reward comes only with his \r\n  success.Â  That is the plain contract and contemplation of the parties.Â  The \r\n  broker may devote his time and labor, and expend his money with ever so much \r\n  devotion to the interests of his employer, and yet if he fails, if without effecting \r\n  an agreement or accomplishing a bargain, he abandons the effort, or his authority \r\n  is fairly and in good faith terminated, he gains no right to commissions.Â  He \r\n  loses the labor and effort which was staked upon success.Â  And in such event \r\n  it matters not that after his failure and the termination of his agency, what \r\n  he has done proves of use and benefit of the principal.\r\n\r\nSwanson v. Stratos, 350 S.C. 116, 122, 564 \r\n  S.E.2d 117, 120 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nThe actions Century 21 took in marketing the property \r\n  to others does not alter the fact that it was not the procuring cause of the \r\n  sale of the property to Ballard.Â  As Century 21 was not the procuring cause \r\n  of the sale between Benford and Ballard, it was not entitled to a commission.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in finding Benford was liable for \r\n  breach of contract and awarding Century 21 a 5% commission.Â  Accordingly, the \r\n  judgment in favor of Century 21 for breach of contract is\r\n REVERSED. \r\n  [1]   \r\n ANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Because we find Benford is not \r\n    liable for breach of contract, we do not address the remaining issues on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-357","title":"Hall v.

Bell, Jr., of Lancaster, for Appellant.\r\nPatrick M. Teague, of Blythewood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  John A. Hall appeals a circuit \r\n  court ruling upholding the South Carolina Department of Public Safetyâ€™s order \r\n  suspending his driverâ€™s license for driving under the influence.Â  We affirm.\r\nIn November 2000, Hall was detained at a license \r\n  checkpoint conducted by the South Carolina Highway Patrol after a patrolman \r\n  detected the smell of alcohol in his car.Â  After Hall failed a field sobriety \r\n  test, he was placed under arrest and taken to the Lancaster Detention Center.Â  \r\n  Once there, Hall took a breathalyzer test which indicated an alcohol concentration \r\n  of 0.18 percent.Â  Because Hall registered an alcohol concentration in excess \r\n  of 0.15 percent, his driverâ€™s license was immediately suspended. Â Hall \r\n  subsequently challenged the suspension in an administrative hearing but the \r\n  hearing officer sustained the suspension.Â  On its appellate review, the circuit \r\n  court likewise found no error and affirmed the suspension.Â Â  \r\nHall asserts the following errors: 1) the circuit court \r\n  should have remanded the case for further determination by the Hearing Officer \r\n  on the issue of the reliability and admissibility of the breathalyzer results; \r\n  2) the Hearing Officer erred by failing to dismiss the charges because the Department \r\n  did not introduce into evidence the videotapes of Hall at the site where he \r\n  was initially arrested or at the breathalyzer site; and 3) the Department erred \r\n  by failing to enter individual findings for each of the factual considerations \r\n  South Carolina Code section 56-5-2951 lists as being within the scope of an \r\n  administrative hearing for a person whose license was suspended for DUI.\r\nWe affirm [1]  pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following \r\n  authorities:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2003) (limiting appellate \r\n  modification of agency decisions to those causing prejudice to substantial rights); \r\n  S.C. Code Ann.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and \r\n  Solicitor E.L. Clements, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Brandon Leandre Brown appeals \r\n  from his conviction and sentences for first-degree criminal sexual conduct with \r\n  a minor and for transmitting a sexual disease. 1Â  \r\n\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  refusal to direct a verdict of acquittal on the indictment charging Brown with \r\n  transmitting a sexual disease.Â  When reviewing the denial of a directed verdict \r\n  motion, the court of appeals must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. \r\n  359, 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  If there is any direct evidence or any \r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of \r\n  the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to \r\n  the jury.Â  State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999).Â  The evidence supported the finding that the victim in this case contracted \r\n  gonorrhea from Brown.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We need not address the issue of whether \r\n  the trial court erred in admitting Brownâ€™s second statement in evidence because \r\n  the police did not repeat the Miranda warnings to Brown prior to his \r\n  giving the statement.Â  The issue is not preserved for appellate review because \r\n  Brown never specifically raised the issue to the trial court and never received \r\n  an explicit ruling upon it.2Â  See State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, \r\n  120, 481 S.E.2d 118, 123 (1997) (â€œ[An] exception is not preserved for review \r\n  because appellant simply made a general objection during the expertsâ€™ testimony \r\n  without giving the specific ground.Â  An issue may not be raised for the first \r\n  time on appeal, but must have been raised to the trial judge to be preserved \r\n  for appellate review.â€); see also Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. \r\n  56, 403 S.E.2d 122 (1991) (holding that where the circuit court did not explicitly \r\n  rule on an argument the issue was not properly before the court of appeals and \r\n  should not have been addressed by it). \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  1 \r\n    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rules 215 \r\n    and 220(b)(2), SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n  2Â Â  Although we do not address the \r\n    issue of whether the interrogating officer should have repeated to Brown the \r\n    Miranda warnings given him three hours and thirty-nine minutes before \r\n    he gave the second statement, other courts have held that repeated warnings \r\n    are not necessary to a finding that a defendant knowingly and intelligently \r\n    waived them in similar instances.Â  See United States v. Frankson, \r\n    83 F.3d 79 (4th Cir. 1996) (two and one-half hours); Jarrell v. Balkcom, \r\n    735 F.2d 1242 (11th Cir. 1984) (three hours); Commonwealth v.

App. 1982) (three and one-half hours).Â  We also note that here the officer \r\n    reminded Brown of his rights before obtaining a second statement from him \r\n    and Brown appeared to have an understanding of his rights at that time.Â  See \r\n    State v. Smith, 259 S.C. 496, 192 S.E.2d 870 (1972) (wherein the supreme \r\n    court held the question of whether Miranda warnings should be repeated \r\n    at a later stage of interrogation after having been once given must be determined \r\n    on the basis of the facts and circumstances surrounding each case).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-359","title":"State v.

Mark Taylor, \r\n  of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Gayle Boyd appeals the family court \r\n  order requiring her to reimburse Robert Bell for post majority support payments.Â  \r\n  Bell made payments to Boyd in the amount of $7,725.00, even though the partiesâ€™ \r\n  son, Robert, failed to attend college as was required for Bell to continue the \r\n  agreed-upon support obligation.Â  The court also awarded Bell attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  in the aggregate sum of $15,269.44 at the rate $1,000 per month.Â  We affirm.\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The family court did not err in awarding \r\n  Bell reimbursement of overpayment of child support, even though the mediated \r\n  agreement did not call for reimbursement. The family court has authority to \r\n  order reimbursement of child support expenses. LaFitte v. LaFitte, 280 \r\n  S.C. 473, 477, 313 S.E.2d 41, 44 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  â€œThe question of child support \r\n  is largely within the discretion of the trial judge whose decision will not \r\n  be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown.â€ Hopkins v. \r\n  Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 305, 540 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2000).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The evidence \r\n  presented showed not only that Bellâ€™s support obligation should have ended, \r\n  but also that Boyd was aware, but attempted to deceive Bell to continue receiving \r\n  support payments.Â  Under the circumstances, the family court did not abuse its \r\n  discretion in ordering reimbursement of the child support overpayment.\r\n2.Â  Â Â Â Â  The family court \r\n  did not err in requiring Boyd to pay attorneyâ€™s fees. â€œThe award of attorney \r\n  fees is within the discretion of the court.â€Â  Pendergast v. Pendergast, \r\n  354 S.C. 32, 39, 579 S.E.2d 530, 533 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Boyd has shown no abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  In determining whether to award attorney fees, the court should \r\n  consider each party's ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results \r\n  obtained by the attorney, the parties' respective financial conditions, and \r\n  the effect of the fee on each party's standard of living. Wooten v. Wooten, \r\n  354 S.C. 242, 254â€“255, 580 S.E.2d 265, 771 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In determining \r\n  the amount of attorney fees to award, the court should consider the nature, \r\n  extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted \r\n  to the case, counsel's professional standing, the contingency of compensation, \r\n  the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services. \r\n  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\n  Bell and Boyd stipulated that the attorneys would not have to testify regarding \r\n  fees. The family court reviewed the attorney affidavits and the itemized bills, \r\n  and made the requisite findings relating whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  the reasonable amount of fees.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  [1] \r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-361","title":"Diabate v.

Hamlin, Pro Se, for Appellant.\r\nHarry O. Shaw, III, of the South Carolina Department of Social \r\n  Services, Child Support Enforcement Division, Charleston, S.C., for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM: Â The family court ordered \r\n  $6,330 held by the Colleton County Sheriffâ€™s Department as proceeds from the \r\n  collection of a civil judgment in favor of Carlos L. Hamlin to be applied to \r\n  Hamlinâ€™s four overdue child support obligations, three of which had been reduced \r\n  to child support judgments.Â  Hamlin appeals. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nHamlin fathered five children raised in four separate \r\n  custodial families. Each time, the custodial parent received assistance from \r\n  SCDSS and assigned child support rights to SCDSS.Â  SCDSS brought actions for \r\n  support and Hamlin was ordered to pay support for each child by the family court. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, one custodial parent terminated subsistence \r\n  through SCDSS, and an order was entered by the family court on February 9, 1999, \r\n  determining the amount still owed in support for that child up to that time. \r\n  Thereafter, Hamlin began receiving Supplemental Social Security, and Hamlin \r\n  and SCDSS entered into a consent order on August 8, 2001, terminating the support \r\n  obligations as to the remaining custodial households.Â  In this consent order, \r\n  the court determined the amount of unpaid support for each case due and owing \r\n  by Hamlin, reducing those amounts to judgments. No appeal was taken from either \r\n  order.\r\nOn October 7, 2002, SCDSS learned from the sheriffâ€™s \r\n  department that Hamlin would be receiving $6,330 in payment of a civil judgment \r\n  on October 10, 2002. SCDSS applied to the family court and obtained an order \r\n  requiring the funds to be paid to the clerk of the family court pending any \r\n  objection by Hamlin. The order recited the amount of each unpaid child support \r\n  obligation, and gave Hamlin ten days in which to file any objection he had to \r\n  applying the funds to those overdue obligations.\r\nHamlin received a copy of the order from the Sheriffâ€™s Office \r\n  and thereafter objected. A hearing was held before Judge Armstrong pursuant \r\n  to notice. At the hearing, Hamlin appeared and argued he had not received notice \r\n  prior to the issuance of the initial order. He further argued one of the overdue \r\n  obligations had not been reduced to a judgment. \r\nConcluding Hamlin failed to give any reasons why the funds \r\n  should not be paid to the custodial families in partial satisfaction of the \r\n  debts, the court ordered payment to the custodial families on a pro-rata basis. \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice \r\n   \r\nHamlin first argues he did not receive notice as required \r\n  under S.C. Code Ann. section 20-7-1295 (2003).Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe initial notice requirements of section 20-7-1295 \r\n  deal with notice to the child support obligor of past due child support. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1295 (B) (â€œWhen the division determines that child support \r\n  is unpaid in an amount equal to or greater than one thousand dollars, it shall \r\n  send written notice to the obligor by first-class mail to the obligor's last \r\n  known address, as filed with the tribunal pursuant to Section 20-7-854.â€).Â  \r\n  However, this notice is not necessary here because the child support as to three \r\n  of the obligations was already reduced to a judgment by consent order on August \r\n  8, 2001.Â  As to the fourth obligation, it was reduced to a sum certain \r\n  by previous final order. Therefore, Hamlin had actual notice of the amounts \r\n  equal to or exceeding one thousand dollars claimed in unpaid child support.\r\nHamlin also argues notice was required in accordance \r\n  with section 20-7-1295 (C).Â Â  He specifically argues this was necessary to perfect \r\n  a lien against real property.Â  However, there is nothing in the record to suggest \r\n  a lien was obtained against real property owned by Hamlin.Â  Furthermore, this \r\n  issue was not raised to or ruled on by the family court. Bakala v. Bakala, \r\n  352 S.C. 612, 576 S.E.2d 156 (2003)(ruling an issue not raised and ruled upon \r\n  by the family court will not be addressed on appeal).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn any event, subsection (C) deals with the manner \r\n  of perfecting liens by filing the requisite notice in the correct office responsible \r\n  for recording and maintaining liens in respect to the type of property involved.Â  \r\n  It does not add a notice requirement to the obligor.\r\nThe other pertinent notice provision in Â§ 20-7-1295 \r\n  states:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n(H) The division shall send timely written notice \r\n  to the obligor by first-class mail of any action taken to perfect a lien, execute \r\n  a levy, or seize any property.Â  The notice shall specify the amount due, the \r\n  steps to be followed to release the property so placed under lien, levied, or \r\n  seized, and the time period within which to respond to the notice and shall \r\n  include the name of the court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction \r\n  which entered the child support order.\r\n\r\nClearly this provision is designed to \r\n  give the obligor notice of â€œany action takenâ€ to perfect a lien or execute a \r\n  levy, and to provide an opportunity to be heard.Â  Here, the court provided that \r\n  notice and Hamlin was afforded an opportunity to be heard. Therefore, this argument \r\n  is without merit.\r\nFinally, Hamlin argues the lack of proper notice \r\n  constituted a Due Process violation.Â  However, Hamlin provided no analysis or \r\n  authority for this argument.Â  Issues are deemed abandoned and thus not presented \r\n  for appellate review where they are argued using only short, conclusory statements, \r\n  without supporting authority.Â  Glasscock, Inc. v. United States Fid. &amp; \r\n  Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001); see \r\n  also First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, \r\n  514 (1994) (holding appellant was deemed to have abandoned issues on appeal, \r\n  where he failed to provide any argument or supporting authority); R &amp; \r\n  G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 437, 540 \r\n  S.E.2d 113, 120 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding where no authority is cited and argument \r\n  is brief and conclusory, issue is deemed abandoned).Â  Therefore, we deem this \r\n  issued abandoned.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice Under Family Court Rule 17(a) \r\n   \r\nHamlin next argues SCDSS failed to comply with Rule 17, SCRFC.Â  \r\n  However, this rule is clearly inapplicable, as it deals with notice to a non-answering \r\n  defendant of the time and date of the hearing on the merits.Â  In any event, \r\n  as stated previously, Hamlin received notice and attended the hearing.Â  Therefore, \r\n  this issue is manifestly without merit.\r\nIII.Â &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jurisdiction\r\nHamlin couches his last argument \r\n  as jurisdictional, claiming the family court did not have jurisdiction to â€œsupercedeâ€ \r\n  a prior court order directing a judgment â€œwithout due process.â€Â  However, his \r\n  argument does not pertain to the stated exception.Â  Instead, Hamlin alludes \r\n  to the fact that the applicant was SCDSS as opposed to the individual obliges.Â  \r\n  He then repeats his assertion that no timely notices were afforded him, thereby \r\n  violating Due Process.Â  Lastly, he argues the initial order seizing the funds \r\n  â€œgot the cart before the horseâ€ because no determination had been made that \r\n  he was the obligor and that the money seized was his.\r\nWe conclude Hamlin presents no discernable argument \r\n  and no authority for his position.Â  Issues are deemed abandoned and thus not \r\n  presented for appellate review where they are argued using only short, conclusory \r\n  statements, without supporting authority.Â  Glasscock, Inc. v. United States \r\n  Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001); \r\n  see also First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d \r\n  513, 514 (1994) (holding appellant was deemed to have abandoned issues on appeal, \r\n  where he failed to provide any argument or supporting authority); R &amp; \r\n  G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 437, 540 \r\n  S.E.2d 113, 120 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding where no authority is cited and argument \r\n  is brief and conclusory, issue is deemed abandoned).Â  Therefore, these issues \r\n  are deemed abandoned on appeal.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order \r\n  of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.

Maples, of West Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nLake E. Summers and Thomas C. R. Legare, Jr., both of Columbia; \r\n  and Vinton DeVane Lide, of Lexington, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Michael Andrew Maples (â€œAppellantâ€) \r\n  appeals a circuit court order granting summary judgment in favor of Donald V. \r\n  Myers, Samuel R. Hubbard, III, and Wayne Wilson (collectively â€œRespondentsâ€) \r\n  dismissing all of Appellantâ€™s claims against them.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nThis matter arises from the seizure of Appellantâ€™s \r\n  1988 Pontiac Firebird and a number of weapons in connection with his arrest \r\n  on multiple charges including â€œTrafficking in Marijuanaâ€ and â€œTrafficking in \r\n  Marijuana Within Proximity of a School.â€\r\nOn April 22, 1995, respondent Wayne Wilson, then \r\n  Chief of Police for the town of South Congaree, was informed a citizen had discovered \r\n  a number of small cups containing plants which he believed were marijuana while \r\n  walking in a wooded area within town limits.Â  Later that day, a South Carolina \r\n  Law Enforcement Division (â€œSLEDâ€) agent accompanied Wilson to the site.Â  On \r\n  April 25, SLED agents set up a motion activated video camera at the grow site.Â  \r\n  During this period of video surveillance, Appellant visited the area several \r\n  times and tended to the marijuana plants.Â  On June 7, one hundred and ninety-four \r\n  (194) marijuana plants were confiscated from the grow site.Â  During the search \r\n  of the area, an army duffel bag was found containing an M-1 rifle and ammunition.\r\nFollowing the seizure of the marijuana crop, SLED \r\n  agents arrested Appellant in West Columbia and transported him to the South \r\n  Congaree Police Department.Â  After the arrest, other SLED agents took custody \r\n  of Appellantâ€™s personal vehicle, a 1988 Pontiac Firebird, at his place of work \r\n  in Richland County and towed it to the South Congaree Police Department. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nWhile in custody and after being advised of his rights, \r\n  Appellant voluntarily executed a detailed written statement.Â  In the statement, \r\n  Appellant admits he germinated marijuana seeds and hauled the germinated seeds, \r\n  plant food, and potting soil to the grow site in his Pontiac Firebird.Â  He told \r\n  Wilson he germinated the marijuana seeds in his bedroom.Â  Appellant also admitted \r\n  his involvement in three earlier shooting incidents, one in which Appellant \r\n  fired the weapon found at the grow site seven times into an occupied mobile \r\n  home.Â  Following the statement, Appellant gave Wilson written consent to search \r\n  his padlocked bedroom in his motherâ€™s home.Â  In the course of this search, seven \r\n  loaded weapons were found and seized.Â  On June 8, 1995, Wilson filed an â€œInitial \r\n  Report of Seizureâ€ covering the property seized from Appellantâ€™s bedroom.Â  On \r\n  June 14, he filed a similar report concerning Appellantâ€™s vehicle.Â  The solicitorâ€™s \r\n  office, however, did not file a final forfeiture complaint against any of this \r\n  property until May 2000, almost five years after the propertyâ€™s seizure.Â  \r\nAppellant was indicted by the grand jury for â€œManufacturing \r\n  and Possession of Marijuana With Intent to Distribute Within Proximity of a \r\n  Schoolâ€ and â€œTrafficking in Marijuanaâ€ in violation of South Carolina Code section \r\n  44-53-370(e)(1)(b).Â  Although Appellant pled guilty to the proximity charge, \r\n  the trafficking charge was pled down to â€œManufacturing in Marijuana 2nd.â€Â  \r\n  For these offenses, Appellant was sentenced to a total of seven years imprisonment. \r\n  He later pled guilty to discharging a firearm into a dwelling and three counts \r\n  of assault with intent to kill, for which he received two consecutive ten-year \r\n  prison terms.\r\nIn 1998, Appellant brought a civil action against Wilson, \r\n  both individually and in his official capacity as chief of the South Congaree \r\n  Police Department, alleging unlawful conversion of the above mentioned seized \r\n  property.Â  After several amendments to his original complaint, Appellant served \r\n  Respondents with the final version of the underlying lawsuit in June 2000.Â  \r\n  The final complaint, among other claims, added Respondents Donald V. Myers, \r\n  circuit solicitor, and his assistant, Samuel R. Hubbard, III, as new defendants \r\n  under a theory of civil conspiracy.Â  The thrust of Appellantâ€™s lawsuit appeared \r\n  to be that Wilson improperly seized his vehicle and weapons, and, by failing \r\n  to comply with the forfeiture statutes in a timely manner, Respondents conspired \r\n  to deprive Appellant of his property and are liable for conversion.\r\nIn November 2000, Wilson moved for summary judgment \r\n  on all causes of action.Â  Following a grant of this motion, Appellant filed \r\n  a motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  In June 2001, while Appellantâ€™s motion \r\n  was pending, Myers and Hubbard filed their own motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  Wilson joined this motion, as it pertained to issues raised against him in Appellantâ€™s \r\n  pending motion to alter or amend.Â  Following a combined hearing on both motions, \r\n  summary judgment was granted to Myers and Hubbard and Appellantâ€™s motion to \r\n  alter or amend was dismissed.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the \r\n  disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.Â  Dawkins \r\n  v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003); George v. Fabri, \r\n  345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  When reviewing the grant of \r\n  a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs \r\n  the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there \r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Laurens Emergency Med. Specialists, P.A. \r\n  v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Sons Bankers, 355 S.C. 104, 108-9, 584 S.E.2d 375, \r\n  377 (2003); Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  \r\n  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all \r\n  factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in a light most favorable to \r\n  the nonmoving party.Â  Sauner v. Public Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, \r\n  354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003); Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., \r\n  353 S.C. 449, 455-56, 578 S.E.2d 711, 714 (2003).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant raises several issues on \r\n  appeal, all ostensibly pertaining to his underlying claims against Respondents \r\n  for the illegal conversion of the above mentioned seized property, allegedly \r\n  perpetuated by civil conspiracy.Â  Conversion is an unlawful act defined as â€œthe \r\n  unauthorized assumption and exercise of the rights of ownership over \r\n  goods or personal chattels belonging to another . . . to the exclusion of the \r\n  ownerâ€™s rights.â€Â  Powell v. A.K. Brown Motor Co., 200 S.C. 75, 78, 20 \r\n  S.E.2d 636, 637 (1942); Green v. Waidner, 284 S.C. 35, 37, 324 S.E.2d \r\n  331, 333 (Ct. App. 1984) (emphasis added).Â  The tort of conversion, therefore, \r\n  â€œcannot spring from the exercise of a legal right.â€Â  Steele v. Victory Sav. \r\n  Bank, 295 S.C. 290, 296, 368 S.E.2d 91, 94 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Appellant asserts, \r\n  due to several alleged statutory violations, the seizure and subsequent forfeiture \r\n  of his property was not a proper exercise of Respondentsâ€™ legal rights, and \r\n  therefore, each is personally liable for the conversion of his property.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nI. Â Â Â Â Â  Civil Conspiracy\r\nAppellant seems to contend that each respondent \r\n  is individually liable for the acts of the other respondents under a theory \r\n  of civil conspiracy.Â  We find this theory of imputation without merit.\r\nIn South Carolina a civil conspiracy requires: (1) \r\n  a combination of two or more persons; (2) for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff; \r\n  (3) which cause the plaintiff special damages.Â  Vaught v. Waites, 300 \r\n  S.C. 201, 208, 387 S.E.2d 91, 95 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  â€œ[I]n order to establish \r\n  a conspiracy, evidence, direct or circumstantial, must be produced from which \r\n  a party may reasonably infer the joint assent of the minds of two or more parties.â€Â  \r\n  Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, 292 S.C. 595, 601, 358 S.E.2d 150, 153 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\nAppellant failed to provide any evidence from which \r\n  one could infer a meeting of the minds between Respondents.Â  In fact, the only \r\n  alleged communication of any kind between Wilson and the Solicitorâ€™s Office \r\n  is the statutorily required seizure notice.Â  Notwithstanding this courtâ€™s standard \r\n  of review, an argument based on mere suggestion and speculation should not survive \r\n  a motion for summary judgment when no evidence is presented which creates a \r\n  material issue of fact on the issue.Â  See Rule 56(e), SCRCP.Â  We therefore \r\n  agree with the trial court in that, as a matter of law, the conspiracy claim \r\n  must fail.Â  As such, we address the possible personal liability of Myers and \r\n  Hubbard (circuit solicitor and assistant solicitor who commenced final forfeiture \r\n  proceedings against Appellantâ€™s property) separately from that of Wilson (sheriff \r\n  who initially seized the property).\r\nII. Â Â Â Â  Personal Liability of Myers and Hubbard\r\nAppellant contends that Myers and \r\n  Hubbard are personally liable for the value of his seized property because \r\n  the final proceedings for forfeiture were commenced in an untimely fashion.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nThere is no need to address the merits of Appellantâ€™s \r\n  various assertions that the proper statutory forfeiture procedures were not \r\n  followed to the letter.Â  It is uncontested that section 44-53-530 grants the \r\n  solicitorâ€™s office the power to petition the circuit court for the forfeiture \r\n  of property seized under 44-53-520.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-530 (2002) (â€œ(a) \r\n  Forfeiture of property defined in Section 44-53-520 must be accomplished by \r\n  petition of . . . the circuit solicitor or his designeeâ€). As such, Myers and \r\n  Hubbard, when commencing the final forfeiture proceedings, were acting solely \r\n  in their official, not personal, capacities.\r\nEven assuming the efficacy of the alleged \r\n  statutory violations (namely that Myers and Hubbard purposefully delayed in \r\n  commencing final forfeiture proceedings against Appellantâ€™s property in violation \r\n  of section 44-53-520 and various statutes of limitation \r\n  [2] ), because Myers and Hubbard acted in no way outside their official \r\n  capacities as prosecutorial agents of the State, they enjoy an absolute immunity \r\n  from civil suits.Â  See Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 553 S.E.2d \r\n  496 (Ct. App. 2001) (discussing in great length the history, policy and modern \r\n  application of prosecutorial immunity from civil liability).Â  While we do not \r\n  in any way condone the solicitorâ€™s officeâ€™s undue delay in bringing final forfeiture \r\n  proceedings following the propertyâ€™s seizure, Appellant states no plausible \r\n  grounds in his pleadings for Myers or Hubbardâ€™s personal liability for the value \r\n  of Appellantâ€™s property.\r\nAppellant seems to assert on appeal, albeit \r\n  vaguely, that he is statutorily provided a remedy by South Carolina section \r\n  44-56-586, which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) Any innocent owner . . . may apply to court of \r\n  common pleas for the return of any item seized under the provisions of Â§ 44-53-520.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n(b) The court may return any seized item to the owner \r\n  if the owner demonstrates to the court by a preponderance of the evidence:\r\n(1) in the case of an innocent owner, that the person \r\n  or entity was not a consenting party to, or privy to, or did not have knowledge \r\n  of, the use of the property which made it subject to seizure and forfeiture.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-586 (2002). \r\nSection 44-53-586 lends Appellant no support.Â  \r\n  First, it would border on frivolity to suggest Appellant qualifies as an â€œinnocent \r\n  owner.â€Â  Second, nothing in this section grants an owner a civil cause of action \r\n  for damages against state agents for carrying out the forfeiture proceedings \r\n  on behalf of the State.Â  As such, we conclude the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary \r\n  judgment to respondents Myers and Hubbard was proper. [3] \r\nIII. Â Â  Personal Liability of Wilson\r\nWe first make note that none of Appellantâ€™s \r\n  issues concerning the final forfeiture proceedings against his property properly \r\n  apply to Wilson.Â  It is specifically provided in the first sentence of section \r\n  44-53-530 that forfeiture proceedings â€œmust be accomplished by petition of the \r\n  Attorney General or his designee or the circuit solicitor or his designee.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-530 (2002). Accordingly, because Wilson did not have \r\n  authority to institute forfeiture proceedings, he could not have any duty to \r\n  do so nor any liability to Appellant for failure to do so in a timely manner.\r\nHowever, as Appellant, again rather vaguely, appears \r\n  to argue Wilson is liable for conversion and concomitant damages arising from \r\n  the unlawful seizure of his property, we address legality of that seizure.Â  \r\n  See Steele, 295 S.C. atÂ  296, 368 S.E.2d at 94 (Ct. App. 1988)(holding \r\n  that conversion cannot arise from the exercise of a legal right).\r\nAppellant contends that the initial seizure of his \r\n  property was unlawful because: 1) no finding was made as to the weight of the \r\n  marijuana; 2) there was no probable cause to seize the weapons found in his \r\n  bedroom; and 3) his vehicle was towed from a location outside of respondent \r\n  Wilsonâ€™s jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nA. Â Â Â Â  Weight of Marijuana\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that his vehicle \r\n  was unlawfully seized because the State failed make a finding as to the weight \r\n  of the marijuana found at the grow site prior to the vehicleâ€™s seizure.Â  Appellantâ€™s \r\n  property was seized pursuant to South Carolina Code section 44-53-520(b), which \r\n  reads:\r\nAny property subject to forfeiture under this article \r\n  may be seized . . . Seizure without process may be made if . . . (4) the department \r\n  has probable cause to believe that the property was used or is intended to be \r\n  used in violation of this article.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-520(b) (2002).Â  Appellant contends \r\n  Wilson had no probable cause to seize the vehicle because, without a determination \r\n  of the marijuanaâ€™s weight, the property was not determinatively â€œused . . . \r\n  in violation of [the] article.â€Â  \r\nAppellant erroneously bases this argument on the following \r\n  language of section 44-53-520, the statute which makes certain property subject \r\n  to forfeiture to the State when used to facilitate the â€œproduction, manufacturing, \r\n  distribution, sale, importation, exportation, or traffickingâ€ of controlled \r\n  substances:\r\nNo motor vehicle may be forfeited to the State under \r\n  this item unless it is used, intended for use, or in any manner facilitates \r\n  a violation of Section 44-53-370(a), involving at least one pound or more of \r\n  marijuana . . .\r\nS.C. Code Ann. 44-53-520 (2002).Â  Appellant, however, \r\n  overlooks the fact that this statute, continues to read â€œ . . . or unless \r\n  it is used . . . or in any manner facilitates a violation of Section 44-53-370(e).â€Â  \r\n  Id. (emphasis added)\r\nSection 44-53-370(e) defines the offense \r\n  of â€œtrafficking in marijuanaâ€ as the cultivation of â€œone hundred to one thousand \r\n  marijuana plants regardless of weight.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. 44-53-370(e)(1)(b) (2002).Â  \r\n  In his written statement, Appellant confessed to the cultivation of approximately \r\n  200 marijuana plants and the specific use of his vehicle in facilitating such.Â  \r\n  A signed written statement confessing to a charged offense as well as specifically \r\n  outlining the use of certain property in facilitating that offense certainly \r\n  provided the police with section 44-53-520â€™s requisite probable cause for the \r\n  propertyâ€™s seizure.Â  Because Appellantâ€™s vehicle was seized pursuant to the \r\n  forfeiture statuteâ€™s reference to 44-53-370(e)(1)(b) and not 370(a) (which is \r\n  limited to only those offenses involving at least one pound of marijuana), a \r\n  finding of the plantâ€™s actual weight was unnecessary. \r\n\r\nB. Â Â Â Â  Probable Cause to Seize the Weapons Found \r\n  in Appellantâ€™s Bedroom\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that the seizure \r\n  of the weapons and other items from his bedroom was unlawful because Wilson \r\n  lacked probable cause to seize the items.Â  Again, Appellantâ€™s own confession \r\n  went beyond the threshold of probable cause in regard to the propertyâ€™s use \r\n  in facilitating a violation of 44-53-370(e).\r\nAppellant admitted in writing to cultivating \r\n  the marijuana found at the grow site.Â  He stated to Wilson that the germination \r\n  of the crop, mentioned in the written statement, took place in his bedroom.Â  \r\n  He also admitted to involvement in three shooting incidents involving firearms \r\n  located in the bedroom.Â  Furthermore, Appellant agreed in writing to allow a \r\n  search of the padlocked bedroom (located in his parentâ€™s home).Â  â€œThe mere probability \r\n  that a crime is being committed [or, as here, that property is being used in \r\n  furtherance of a crime], rather than a prima facie showing of criminal [use], \r\n  is the standard probable cause.â€Â  State v. Dean, 282 S.C. 136, 139, 317 \r\n  S.E.2d 744, 745 (1984).Â  The above confession and the location of the weapons \r\n  in such close proximity to the admitted germinating area of the marijuana crop \r\n  provided Wilson with requisite probable cause that the items were subject to \r\n  forfeiture under section 44-53-520, thus, their seizure was proper.\r\n\r\nC. Â Â Â Â  The Towing of the Vehicle\r\n\r\nAppellant also argues Wilson personally \r\n  towed Appellantâ€™s vehicle from an area outside of Wilsonâ€™s jurisdiction, thus, \r\n  he is liable in an individual capacity for the conversion of Appellantâ€™s vehicle.Â  \r\n  We find this argument without merit.Â  \r\nAccording to Wilson, SLED agents towed Appellantâ€™s \r\n  vehicle to the South Congaree Police Department, where Wilson later executed \r\n  a seizure report.Â  Appellant submitted no evidence at the hearing to refute \r\n  Wilsonâ€™s account of the towing.Â  His assertions as to Wilsonâ€™s personal actions \r\n  are, in fact, pure speculation as Appellant was in custody at the time of the \r\n  towing.Â  Furthermore, Appellantâ€™s argument that Wilsonâ€™s alleged behavior gives \r\n  rise to personal liability is wholly conclusory, as Appellant cites no authority \r\n  for this position.Â  See Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. \r\n  Co., 348 S.C. 76, 557 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œSouth Carolina law clearly \r\n  states that short, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are \r\n  deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for review.â€)Â  Finally, \r\n  Appellantâ€™s unlawful jurisdiction theory in regard to Wilsonâ€™s alleged towing \r\n  of the Firebird is raised for the first time on appeal, thus unpreserved for \r\n  out review.Â  See Fraternal Order of Police v. South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Revenue, 352 S.C. 420, 435, 574 S.E.2d 717, 725 (2002) (â€œGenerally, claims \r\n  or defenses not presented in the pleadings will not be considered on appeal.â€)\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe grant of summary judgment in favor \r\n  of Respondents is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Appellant asserts that Wilson, not SLED, personally towed \r\n    the vehicle. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  S.C.

Farry, and David A. Wilson, both of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation case, Janet Agnew \r\n  appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision affirming the Full Commissionâ€™s ruling \r\n  that Agnew sustained a compensable injury to her back and was entitled to permanent \r\n  partial disability of 40%.Â  We vacate and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\n Janet Agnew worked for Spartanburg County School District No. 3 \r\n  as a teacher for approximately twenty-two years.Â  On September 19, 1995, she \r\n  sustained injuries while at school after tripping over tape that was stuck to \r\n  the floor.Â  Initially, Dr. Howard Tiller treated her for pain in her knees, \r\n  ankle, and shoulder.Â  Subsequently, Dr. Tiller saw her for pain in her lower \r\n  back. She was prescribed physical therapy, which included the use of a TENS \r\n  device.Â  It was noted that the TENS device helped relieve some pain.Â  \r\nOn September 16, 1996, Dr. Tiller found:Â  1) Agnew continued to have \r\n  back pain resulting from her September 1995 accident; 2) x-rays revealed degenerative \r\n  disk disease; 3) she had reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) and suffered \r\n  a 10% permanent physical impairment to her back; and 4) the TENS unit had helped \r\n  and was the most appropriate treatment to continue.Â  \r\nAgnew continued seeing Dr. Tiller periodically, and on December 23, \r\n  1997, received an MRI, which indicated degenerative change. Â In February \r\n  1998, Dr. Tiller noted Agnew had several lumbar epidurals, which helped considerably \r\n  with her leg pain.Â  Agnewâ€™s counsel discussed the back injury with Dr. Tiller \r\n  in February 1998.Â  Dr. Tiller indicated the back pain/injury was related to \r\n  the September 1995 fall.Â  He further found:Â  the fall probably aggravated a \r\n  pre-existing degenerative disk disease; Agnewâ€™s treatment had been â€œgeared toward \r\n  lessening her overall period of disability;â€ and that given her progression \r\n  of symptoms required further treatment she had not reached MMI and would need \r\n  a surgical consultation from an orthopaedic spine specialist. \r\nAgnew was referred to Dr. Gerald Rollins for a surgical opinion as to her lower \r\n  back.Â  Dr. Rollins found she had moderately severe degenerative disk disease.Â  \r\n  After initially refusing surgery, Agnew underwent a discectomy and a fusion \r\n  of the L5-S1 disk space.Â  The surgery improved her condition, though she continued \r\n  having pain and restricted motion. \r\nIn July 1998, Agnew retired from her position as a schoolteacher.Â  She testified \r\n  that she was not physically able to perform the work.Â  Even though she was offered \r\n  other positions within the School District, she chose to remain retired.Â  \r\nIn January 1999, Dr. Rollins released Agnew from active treatment.Â  He found \r\n  the fusion should have solidified and indicated she needed medication for pain.Â  \r\n  In June 1999, he found that the use of Ultram for pain was in Agnewâ€™s long-term \r\n  benefit, determined she had a 12% permanent impairment to her back, and found \r\n  she had reached MMI.Â  In response to a questionnaire by the School District, \r\n  Dr. Rollins indicated in September 1999 that Agnew reached MMI in May 1999 and \r\n  her impairment was 10% to the spine.Â  \r\nOn April 7, 2000, Agnew underwent another evaluation, this time by Dr. Glenn \r\n  Scott.Â  Dr. Scott took Agnewâ€™s history, noted that she relied upon pain medications, \r\n  and concluded:Â  1) she had reached MMI; 2) she would need to continue on pain \r\n  medications; and 3) assigned a total impairment to the back of 25%, which he \r\n  allocated as 20% to the injury and 5% to pre-existing conditions. Â \r\nDr. Donald Johnson evaluated Agnew in August 2000.Â  He indicated:Â  1) the surgery \r\n  had helped to some degree; 2) she had to walk with a cane; and 3) she had extremely \r\n  limited range of motion.Â  Based on these findings, he concluded: 1) she had \r\n  reached MMI; 2) she sustained a 25% impairment to the spine; 3) she sustained \r\n  a 25% impairment to the whole person; and 4) that Agnew would not be able to \r\n  return to the workplace as a teacher. \r\nThe following day, Agnew met with Dr. William Stewart for a determination of \r\n  vocational rehabilitation.Â  He noted the significance of her continued pain \r\n  and reliance upon pain medication.Â  He indicated it would be impossible for \r\n  her to return as a schoolteacher and that the use of the pain medication and \r\n  lower back pain made it difficult for her to even do sedentary work.Â  His final \r\n  conclusion was:Â  \r\n\r\n[I]t is concluded that her prognosis for successful vocational rehabilitation \r\n  to some kind of lighter, alternative work or job has to be considered very poor \r\n  to nonexistent.Â  That is, Ms. Agnew will most likely remain unable to work and \r\n  vocationally disabled, as I do not believe a reasonably stable job market exists \r\n  for the types of services she is physically capable to providing/sustaining, \r\n  despite her level of education/sophistication.Â  \r\n\r\nAfter receiving temporary total disability compensation in December \r\n  1998, Agnew filed for permanent total workerâ€™s compensation benefits.Â  The single \r\n  commissioner held a hearing on October 31, 2000.Â  Agnew testified she continued \r\n  to experience significant lower back pain and required pain medication.Â  She \r\n  also testified that she could not sit or stand for long periods of time.Â  While \r\n  admitting to taking trips to both Hawaii and London, she testified that if she \r\n  increased her activity, she must take time off to recover.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner found Agnew had experienced an injury by \r\n  accident while employed by the School District, and the injury resulted in a \r\n  30% permanent partial disability to her back.Â  Agnew appealed this decision \r\n  to the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Full Commission).Â  \r\n  Her appeal contested many of the factual findings of the single commissioner \r\n  and asked that she be found more than 50% disabled.Â  \r\nThe Full Commission was split in its decision.Â  The majority issued \r\n  an opinion that found:Â  Agnew sustained a compensable injury by accident; had \r\n  received proper medical treatment since the accident; and had reached MMI on \r\n  May 1, 1999.Â  The majority concluded that Agnew was entitled to permanent partial \r\n  disability of 40%.Â  \r\nThe dissenting member of the Full Commission found:Â  the majority \r\n  overlooked significant evidence; â€œneither sufficiently analyze[d] this evidence \r\n  nor addresse[d] its impact upon the primary issue in dispute; and . . . disregard[ed] \r\n  the only reasonable inference which may be gleaned from the evidence contained \r\n  in the hearing record.â€Â  The dissent articulated her belief that the majority \r\n  failed to make specific findings of fact as required, and that the implicit \r\n  findings of fact were insufficient to support their conclusion.Â  The dissent \r\n  concluded that Agnew was entitled to an award of permanent and total disability \r\n  compensation.Â  \r\nOn appeal to the circuit court, Agnew contended the Full Commission:Â  \r\n  erred in finding she only had a 40% permanent disability to her back; failed \r\n  to make specific and sufficient findings of fact; and erred in not finding she \r\n  suffered greater than a 50% disability to her back.Â  The circuit court affirmed \r\n  the ruling of the Full Commission, finding its decision of 40% disability was \r\n  supported by substantial evidence and that the findings of fact made by the \r\n  Full Commission were â€œlegally and sufficiently detailed.â€Â  However, in making \r\n  its own determination, the circuit court included over three pages of evidence \r\n  to support its conclusion that was never specifically mentioned by the Full \r\n  Commissionâ€™s majority order. Agnew filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant \r\n  to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  The circuit court denied this motion.Â  Agnew appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard \r\n  of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  \r\n  Lark v.

Texfi \r\n  Indus., 341 S.C. 401, 404, 535 S.E.2d 124, 125 (2000).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence \r\n  is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such \r\n  evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds \r\n  to reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. \r\n  at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nAgnew argues the circuit court erred in affirming the decision of \r\n  the Full Commission given the Commissionâ€™s findings were not sufficiently detailed \r\n  for a proper review of the ultimate holding.Â  She maintains the Full Commission \r\n  never explained its determination that Agnew was 40% disabled as compared to \r\n  the 30% found by the single commissioner or the more than 50% found by the Commissionâ€™s \r\n  dissenting member.Â  Finally, Agnew contends there was uncontradicted evidence \r\n  that was neither examined nor explained by the Full Commission.Â  We agree with \r\n  Agnew that the Commissionâ€™s failure to make specific findings of fact necessitates \r\n  that we remand this case to the Commission. \r\nUnder the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act, â€œ[a] final \r\n  decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated.Â  \r\n  Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by \r\n  a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (1986).Â  Section 42-17-40 of the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act also requires that an award include â€œa statement of the findings of fact, \r\n  rulings of law, and other matters pertinent to the questions at issue.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-40(A) (Supp. 2003).Â Â \r\nAlthough the findings of fact and conclusions of law of an administrative body \r\n  need not be presented in any particular format, they â€œmust be sufficiently detailed \r\n  to enable the reviewing court to determine whether the findings are supported \r\n  by the evidence.â€Â  Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 66, 456 \r\n  S.E.2d 366, 367-68 (1995); Able Communications, Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. \r\n  Serv. Commâ€™n, 290 S.C. 409, 411, 351 S.E.2d 151, 152 (1986).Â  â€œWithout specific \r\n  and definite findings upon the evidence, a court on review of the panelâ€™s decision \r\n  cannot determine whether to uphold the general finding or conclusion . . . .â€Â  \r\n  Baldwin v. James River Corp., 304 S.C. 485, 486, 405 S.E.2d 421, 422 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Implicit findings of fact are not sufficient.Â  Aristizabal \r\n  v. Woodside-Div. of Dan River, Inc., 268 S.C. 366, 370-71, 234 S.E.2d 21, \r\n  23 (1977).Â  Where material facts are in dispute, the administrative body must \r\n  make specific, express findings of fact.Â  Id.Â Â Â \r\nIn Nettles v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. #7, 341 S.C. 580, 590-91, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  146, 151 (Ct. App. 2000), this Court explained the procedural necessity of specific \r\n  findings of fact, stating:\r\n\r\nThe commission must make specific findings of fact upon which a claimantâ€™s right \r\n  to compensation are based.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (1986); Shealy \r\n  v. Algernon Blair, Inc., 250 S.C. 106, 109, 156 S.E.2d 646, 648 (1967); \r\n  73A C.J.S. Public Administrative Law and Procedure Â§ 144, at 104 (1983) \r\n  (â€œWhere the requirements as to administrative findings are contained in statutes, \r\n  the findings must comply therewith.â€).Â  In fact, â€œawards without such specific \r\n  findings do not comply with the requirements of the [workersâ€™ compensation] \r\n  act and are illegal.â€Â  Id. at 110, 156 S.E.2d at 648; see also \r\n  Airco, Inc. v. Hollington, 269 S.C. 152, 160, 236 S.E.2d 804, 808 (1977) \r\n  (finding that the commission has a statutory duty to make a finding of fact \r\n  for all â€œessential factual issues.â€).Â  This court cannot make findings of fact \r\n  when the commission has failed to do so because, in doing so, this court would \r\n  improperly assume the commissionâ€™s role as factfinder.Â  Fox v. Newberry County \r\n  Memorial Hosp., 319 S.C. 278, 280, 461 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1995).Â  Because \r\n  the commission did not make specific findings of fact to support its ruling, \r\n  we must remand the issue to the commission.Â  See, e.g., Parsons v. \r\n  Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 456 S.E.2d 366 (1995) (holding an order of \r\n  the commission that does not include sufficiently detailed findings of fact \r\n  must be remanded to the commission).\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, the order issued by the majority of the Full \r\n  Commission fails to set forth any specific findings of fact related to its determination \r\n  that Agnew suffered a 40% permanent partial disability to her back as opposed \r\n  to the 30% rating assigned by the single commissioner.Â  Moreover, the order \r\n  fails to provide any findings of fact regarding the essential issues of whether \r\n  Agnew was entitled to a finding of total disability or more than 50% permanent \r\n  partial disability.Â  The order merely states, â€œThe injury sustained by the Claimant \r\n  as a result of her accident on September 19, 1995 based on the medical evidence \r\n  and other evidence presented results in a permanent partial disability of 40% \r\n  loss of use of her back.â€ Â Thus, the Full Commission implicitly ruled \r\n  that Agnew did not suffer more than 50% disability and implicitly found against \r\n  the conclusions of Dr. William Stewart, the vocational rehabilitation examiner, \r\n  regarding her ability to perform some function.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the Commission did not incorporate by reference the factual findings \r\n  of the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  Thus, the erroneous omission of detailed \r\n  factual findings in the Commissionâ€™s order was not cured. \r\n  [1] Â  Cf. Eaddy v. Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., 355 S.C. \r\n  154, 168, 584 S.E.2d 390, 398 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied (May 13, \r\n  2004) (finding the Full Commissionâ€™s incorporation of the single commissionerâ€™s \r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law by reference provided the circuit court \r\n  with sufficiently definite and detailed findings to allow the circuit court \r\n  to ascertain whether the findings by the Commission were supported by the evidence \r\n  and whether the law was correctly applied).\r\nAdditionally, the circuit court, in affirming the Full Commissionâ€™s decision, \r\n  utilized over three pages to set forth findings of fact detailing the evidence \r\n  it found supported the Full Commission.Â  However, when the Full Commission failed \r\n  to set forth findings of fact on its own, the circuit court could not make its \r\n  own findings of fact without improperly assuming the role of the Full Commission.Â  \r\n  See Nettles, 341 S.C. at 590-91, 535 S.E.2d at 151 (stating an \r\n  appellate court â€œcannot make findings of fact when the commission has failed \r\n  to do so because, in doing so, [the appellate] court would improperly assume \r\n  the commissionâ€™s role as factfinderâ€).\r\nTherefore, we vacate the circuit courtâ€™s order and remand to the \r\n  Full Commission to make detailed findings of fact.Â  We instruct the Commission \r\n  to review all of the evidence in the present record when making its factual \r\n  findings and conclusions as to Agnewâ€™s degree of disability.Â  See Sigmon \r\n  v. Dayco Corp., 316 S.C. 260, 262-63, 449 S.E.2d 497, 498-99 (Ct. App. 1994) \r\n  (vacating circuit courtâ€™s order and remanding to Full Commission where Full \r\n  Commission did not make findings of fact and circuit court improperly made its \r\n  own findings of fact with regard to claimantâ€™s injury); Baldwin, 304 \r\n  S.C. at 487, 405 S.E.2d at 423 (vacating circuit courtâ€™s order and remanding \r\n  case to Full Commission to make definite and detailed findings of fact on present \r\n  record where Full Commissionâ€™s findings of fact were conclusory as to claimantâ€™s \r\n  award).Â  \r\nII.\r\nAs to the merits of her appeal, Agnew asserts there was uncontradicted \r\n  evidence from Dr. William Stewart indicating she was permanently and totally \r\n  disabled and would be unable to work.Â  Additionally, she contends her treating \r\n  physiciansâ€™ directions for her to continue to use prescription medication and \r\n  to consider chronic pain management are evidence in favor of finding she is \r\n  more than 50% permanently disabled.Â  Finally, she maintains the only reasonable \r\n  inference arising from the evidence is that she experienced a 50% loss of use \r\n  of her back and has been rendered permanently and totally disabled.Â  Thus, the \r\n  Full Commissionâ€™s decision is not supported by substantial evidence, but rather, \r\n  is based on an error of law.\r\nIn light of our decision to remand this case to the Full Commission, \r\n  we need not address this issue.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of \r\n  Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (noting \r\n  that an appellate court need not address appellantâ€™s remaining issues when its \r\n  determination of a prior issue is dispositive); Whiteside v.

Hall, of Hartsville, for Appellant.\r\nFinley B. Clarke, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this legal \r\n  malpractice action, Ella Hall appeals a circuit court order granting summary \r\n  judgment in favor of J. Richard Jones, Esquire.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nElla Hall worked as a nurse for Commander Nursing \r\n  Center.Â  In 1997, she became the subject of an investigation into some missing \r\n  drugs at the center.Â  The South Carolina Board of Nursing investigated the incident.Â  \r\n  Rebecca Plowden, the nursing home administrator, suspended Hall in July 1997 \r\n  after the investigation indicated Hall was responsible for the missing drugs.Â  \r\n  A complaint against her nursing license was filed with the Board.\r\nHall originally hired Anne Bell in August \r\n  1997 as counsel to help with the licensing matter before the Board.Â  She discussed \r\n  bringing suit against Commander for racial discrimination because she was black \r\n  and her husband was white, and she felt that contributed to her suspension.Â  \r\n  Hall became dissatisfied with Bellâ€™s representation and terminated the representation \r\n  in March 1998. \r\nThereafter, Hall retained Jones in March \r\n  1998 to represent her in the Board matter.Â  Additionally, she raised the possibility \r\n  of bringing suit against multiple parties, including Commander, Plowden, the \r\n  Board, and its investigator.Â  Jones pursued his representation of Hall on the \r\n  matter before the Board.Â  In October 1998, Jones and Hall were notified that \r\n  the complaint against Hallâ€™s license had been dismissed.Â  \r\nIn December 1998, Jones ended his representation \r\n  of Hall.Â  He never filed any actions regarding her racial discrimination or \r\n  defamation claims.Â  Hall stated that Jones presented her with a list of other \r\n  counsel to consider for representation.Â  On December 7, 1998, Jones returned \r\n  Hallâ€™s file to her.Â  He never charged Hall for any of his representation.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nOn July 22, 1999, Hall employed David \r\n  Weeks to file actions for racial discrimination and defamation.Â  Hall subsequently \r\n  terminated his representation.Â Â Â  \r\nIn December 2000, Hall filed separate pro \r\n  se legal malpractice actions against Bell, Jones, and Weeks.Â  In her \r\n  complaint against Jones, she alleged breach of contract, breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty, and negligence.Â  All of her claims centered on his failure to file her \r\n  action for defamation and racial discrimination.Â  Each cause of action was framed \r\n  as an action for legal malpractice.Â  Jones filed an answer admitting he represented \r\n  her regarding her nursing license, but denying he ever agreed to pursue the \r\n  racial discrimination and defamation claims.Â  He asserted his representation \r\n  ended on December 7, 1998, when he returned the file to Hall.Â  \r\nJones filed a motion for summary judgment, along \r\n  with an affidavit from an expert.Â  The affidavit stated Jones did not breach \r\n  the standard of care for an attorney.Â  The expert asserted a strategy was required \r\n  to determine whether to file a lawsuit while the matter before the nursing board \r\n  was pending, as well as the type of cause of action to file.Â  Hall failed to \r\n  file an affidavit from an expert in connection with the summary judgment motion.Â  \r\n  The circuit court extended to Hall forty-five days to file an affidavit establishing \r\n  the standard of care and identifying Jonesâ€™ breach of the standard.Â  Hall never \r\n  submitted the affidavit of an expert.\r\nIn ruling on the summary judgment motion, the circuit \r\n  court considered Hallâ€™s three causes of action as one action alleging legal \r\n  malpractice.Â  The court found that she failed to properly establish the standard \r\n  of care by expert testimony.Â  The court also noted that Hall still had several \r\n  viable causes of action at the time Jones ended his representation.Â  As such, \r\n  she did not show how his failure to file certain complaints was the proximate \r\n  cause of any of her alleged damages.Â  Finally, the court concluded Jones â€œexercised \r\n  good judgment and did not deviate from the standard of careâ€ and that Hall â€œsuffered \r\n  no legal prejudice by the fact [Jones] had not filed suit for her prior to December \r\n  7, 1998.â€Â  Hall did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the \r\n  judgment to have the court specifically address either her breach of contract \r\n  or breach of fiduciary duty claims.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, \r\n  this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court:Â  summary \r\n  judgment is proper when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and \r\n  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; \r\n  Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-115, 410 \r\n  S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact \r\n  exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the \r\n  evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â \r\nStrother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. \r\n  54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary \r\n  judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and \r\n  inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the \r\n  non-moving party below.â€Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 \r\n  S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n Hall raises several issues contesting \r\n  the grant of summary judgment in favor of Jones.Â  She alleges: 1) there are \r\n  issues of fact as to whether an attorney-client relationship existed; \r\n  [1]  2) the court erred in requiring an affidavit or testimony by an expert \r\n  to establish the standard of care; 3) there are issues of fact related to Hallâ€™s \r\n  legal malpractice claim; 4) there are issues of fact related to Hallâ€™s claim \r\n  of breach of contract; [2]  5) there are issues of fact related to Hallâ€™s breach of fiduciary \r\n  duty claim; [3]  and 6) the affidavit \r\n  testimony of Jonesâ€™ expert was not uncontradicted.Â  The only issues properly \r\n  before this court for review are the requirement of expert testimony and affidavit \r\n  to establish the standard of care, and whether the trial court properly granted \r\n  summary judgment as to the legal malpractice claim.Â  \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Expert Testimony\r\nHall contends that expert testimony was \r\n  not required to establish the standard of care for the legal malpractice action \r\n  against Jones.Â  She maintains it is common knowledge that an action should be \r\n  filed before the statute of limitations has run.Â  We find the issue in this \r\n  case went beyond the common knowledge of laypersons.Â  Hence, an affidavit of \r\n  an expert was necessary to establish the appropriate standard of care.\r\nIn South Carolina, the plaintiff in a legal malpractice suit \r\n  must prove the following four elements:\r\n\r\n(1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship;\r\n(2) a breach of duty by the attorney;\r\n(3) damage to the client;Â  and\r\n(4) proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages by the breach.Â \r\n\r\nMcNair v. Rainsford, 330 S.C. 332, 342, 499 \r\n  S.E.2d 488, 493-94 (Ct. App. 1998); Smith v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; \r\n  Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 435,Â  472 S.E.2d 612, 613 (1996).Â  Additionally, \r\n  the plaintiff must generally establish the standard of care by expert testimony.Â  \r\n  Smith, 322 S.C. at 435, 472 S.E.2d at 613; Mali v. Odom, 295 S.C. \r\n  78, 80, 367 S.E.2d 166, 168 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œA plaintiff in a legal malpractice \r\n  case must ordinarily establish by expert testimony the standard of care, unless \r\n  the subject matter is of common knowledge to laypersons.â€).\r\nIn the instant case, the issue of when \r\n  to file an action and what type of action to file is more complicated than Hall \r\n  indicates.Â  As discussed by M.Â  Malissa Burnette, Jonesâ€™ expert and a certified \r\n  specialist in employment and labor law, Jones needed to consider the ramifications \r\n  of filing an action while Hallâ€™s nursing license was pending review by the Board.Â  \r\n  Jonesâ€™ predominant interest was in maintaining Hallâ€™s nursing license.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Burnette indicated there were several \r\n  theories under which Hall could proceed in asserting racial discrimination.Â  \r\n  Burnette stated that several theories could only be asserted against certain \r\n  defendants and that some theories had a cap on the amount of damages Hall could \r\n  collect.Â  Burnette further stated that the only statute under which Hall could \r\n  have asserted a claim against all defendants in the amount she desired would \r\n  have been 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1981, and the statute of limitations on that claim did \r\n  not run until July 30, 2000.Â  \r\nThe combination of considerations in filing \r\n  a suitâ€”what type of suit to file, when it was most beneficial to file suit, \r\n  and against whom the suit could be filedâ€”all are beyond the scope of common \r\n  knowledge held by laypersons.Â  As such, the common knowledge exception is inapplicable.Â  \r\n  We agree with the circuit court and find that the general rule requiring the \r\n  standard of care be properly established by expert testimony applies in this \r\n  case.Â  See Smith, 322 S.C. at 435, 472 S.E.2d at 613.Â  \r\nAfter Jones submitted the affidavit of Burnette, \r\n  which established a standard of care and stated it was not breached, the court \r\n  allowed Hall forty-five days in which to file her own affidavit by an expert.Â  \r\n  The circuit court went beyond the requirements of the rule in trying to accommodate \r\n  a pro se plaintiff.Â  Hall failed to file the requisite affidavit \r\n  from an expert to establish the standard of care.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Summary Judgment of Legal Malpractice Claim\r\nHall contends the trial court erred in \r\n  granting summary judgment on her claim for legal malpractice.Â  She alleges that \r\n  issues of fact exist relating to the duty required, the breach of that duty \r\n  by Jones, the damages caused by the breach, and whether Jonesâ€™ actions were \r\n  the proximate cause of the damages.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs discussed above, Hall was required \r\n  to establish the standard of care by expert testimony to survive summary judgment.Â  \r\n  As she failed to do so, summary judgment by the circuit court was appropriate.Â  \r\n  The motion was properly granted in any event.Â  \r\nHallâ€™s primary contention is that Jones \r\n  failed to file a complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \r\n  as amended, 42 U.S.C.A. Â§2000e-2(a)(1), with the Equal Employment Opportunity \r\n  Commission.Â  Hall asserts Jones missed the 300-day statute of limitations for \r\n  filing the claim, and she is now barred. \r\nFirst, this issue is not properly preserved \r\n  for review on appeal.Â  Hall originally charged that Jones missed a 180-day statute \r\n  of limitations for filing.Â  It was not until after the summary judgment hearing, \r\n  but before receipt of the final order granting the motion, that she first made \r\n  the claims regarding the 300-day statute of limitations.Â  As the trial court \r\n  did not expressly rule on that issue, it is not preserved for our review on \r\n  appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d \r\n  731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first \r\n  time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge \r\n  to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\nNext, Hall fails to demonstrate how she \r\n  was harmed by Jonesâ€™ failure to file the claim.Â  Hall had several causes of \r\n  action still available to her after December 7, 1998, including an action under \r\n  42 U.S.C. Â§ 1981.Â  Section 1981 and other tort actions do not have a cap on \r\n  the damages Hall could collect.Â  \r\nJonesâ€™ representation of Hall was terminated \r\n  in December 1998.Â  In July 1999, Hall engaged Weeks to represent her in her \r\n  racial discrimination claims.Â  She had almost a year before the statute of limitations \r\n  ran on her claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1981 and her tort claims.Â  As such, \r\n  Jonesâ€™ failure to file claims on Hallâ€™s behalf would not be the proximate cause \r\n  of her damages, as she still had viable causes of action available to her.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we concur with the circuit \r\n  court and hold that the allegation of attorney malpractice required expert testimony \r\n  as to the standard of care and deviation from such standard.Â  We conclude the \r\n  circuit court properly granted Jonesâ€™ motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  The trial judge assumed for the purpose of his order that an attorney-client \r\n    relationship existed.Â  Therefore, there is no reason for this court to address \r\n    this issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  With regard to the breach of contract issue, the arguments in Hallâ€™s \r\n    brief are conclusory and fail to cite any supporting authority for the position.Â  \r\n    As such, we find Hall abandoned the issues on appeal.Â  See First \r\n    Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994); Solomon \r\n    v. City Realty Co., 262 S.C. 198, 201, 203 S.E.2d 435, 436 (1974).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  With regard to the breach of \r\n    fiduciary duty claim, Hall appears to be arguing the same issues she argued \r\n    in relation to her legal malpractice claim.Â  As such, the issue will be consolidated \r\n    with the legal malpractice claim.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-368","title":"Brown v.

Senn, of Charleston and Stephanie Pendarvis McDonald, \r\n  of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jerry Louis Brown appeals the \r\n  dismissal of his action for damages allegedly resulting from a police investigation \r\n  and the service of arrest warrants on him.Â  We dismiss Brownâ€™s appeal of the \r\n  issues raised in his motion to alter judgment and affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  on the remaining issue. [1]   \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn October 25, 2000, Brown, an inmate in the custody \r\n  of the South Carolina Department of Corrections, brought a civil rights action \r\n  in the United States District Court against Sylvester R. Harper and the Charleston \r\n  Police Department, alleging, among other things, fraud and negligence.Â  On \r\n  October 31, 2000, United States Magistrate Judge Joseph R. McCrorey issued a \r\n  report recommending that the District Court dismiss Brownâ€™s complaint without \r\n  prejudice and without issuance and service of process. \r\nOn December 27, 2000, Brown filed an action in \r\n  the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Common Pleas alleging among other things \r\n  that Harper, an officer with the Charleston Police Department, violated \r\n  Brownâ€™s civil rights during the course of an investigation concerning Brown. \r\n  [2] \r\nOn February 2, 2001, Defendants notified Brown \r\n  the action was removed to the Charleston Division of United States District \r\n  Court for the District of South Carolina.Â  By order entered April 26, \r\n  2001, United States District Judge David C. Norton dismissed Brownâ€™s action \r\n  without prejudice and denied Brownâ€™s request to remand the case to the Charleston \r\n  County Court of Common Pleas, but also provided that Brown could refile in state \r\n  court if he wished. \r\nOn June 15, 2001, Brown filed another \r\n  action against Harper and the Charleston Police Department in the Ninth Judicial \r\n  Circuit Court of Common Pleas.Â  Defendants moved to dismiss the action \r\n  on July 12, 2001.Â  On August 10, 2001, Brown filed a â€œCOMPLAINT OF JOINDERS \r\n  AS DEFENDANTSâ€ against Julie J. Armstrong and Sandra J. Senn â€œin there personal \r\n  capacitys and professional capacitys.â€ \r\n  [3] Â  Defendants then filed a motion to dismiss Brownâ€™s â€œcomplaint \r\n  of joindersâ€ and requested other relief, including sanctions against Brown, \r\n  a preliminary injunction on future cases, and the imposition of a â€œstrikeâ€ against \r\n  Brown.Â  In response, Brown moved to strike Defendantsâ€™ motion.\r\nOn May 1, 2002, Judge Young, sitting as \r\n  a special circuit judge, conducted a hearing on both motions.Â  At the \r\n  conclusion of the hearing, Brown sought and received an additional ten days \r\n  to file a supplemental memorandum of law and any other materials he felt necessary \r\n  to respond to Defendantsâ€™ arguments. \r\nBy order dated and filed July 12, 2002, \r\n  Judge Young granted Defendantsâ€™ motion to dismiss the lawsuit and Brownâ€™s â€œcomplaint \r\n  of joinders.â€Â  The grounds for dismissal of the action were (1) the action \r\n  was time-barred, (2) Defendants were immune from suit, and (3) Brown could not \r\n  attack the validity of his conviction through a tort and civil rights action.Â  \r\n  In the same order, Judge Young denied Defendantsâ€™ motion for sanctions; however, \r\n  he included a statement admonishing Brown that â€œfuture filings in either this \r\n  or any other frivolous matter will not be so kindly tolerated.â€\r\n On July 25, 2002, Brown filed a motion \r\n  under Rule 59(e) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure to alter the \r\n  judgment, alleging that Defendants had â€œwaived all claimsâ€ under Rule 41(c) \r\n  of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  Judge Young denied Brownâ€™s \r\n  motion by order dated August 12, 2002, and filed August 13, 2002.Â  Brown \r\n  received notice of the denial on August 21, 2002. \r\nOnÂ  August 20, 2002, Brown filed a â€œmotion \r\n  from relief from orderâ€ under Rule 60(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil \r\n  Procedure arguing as grounds:Â  â€œSpecial circuit court judge, lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction over the parties, when the plaintiff made timely objection \r\n  upon the record and request jury trial on the matter, and the judgement should \r\n  be made void.â€Â  He further alleged this amounted to an improper deprivation \r\n  of his constitutional right to a jury trial under the seventh amendment of the \r\n  federal constitution, as well as a violation of his due process and equal protection \r\n  rights. \r\nBy order dated and filed October 21, 2002, \r\n  Judge Young denied the motion, noting he â€œheard the motion not as Master-in-Equity \r\n  for Charleston County, but rather as Special Circuit Court Judge for Charleston \r\n  County under appointment of the Chief Justice.â€ \r\nBrownâ€™s notice of appeal in this case \r\n  is dated November 12, 2002.Â  In his appellantâ€™s brief, Brown argues (1) \r\n  Defendants were equitably estopped from raising the statute of limitations as \r\n  a bar to Brownâ€™s action, (2) the removal of this action to the federal district \r\n  court was improper, and (3) because he had demanded a jury trial, â€œthe â€œMaster-in-Equity \r\n  would lack subject matter jurisdiction over summary dismissal.â€\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Defendants argue Brownâ€™s appeal is untimely and should \r\n  be dismissed.Â  We agree with this argument insofar as it concerns the first \r\n  two issues Brown discusses in his brief.Â Â Â  \r\nBrown does not deny that he received the order denying his \r\n  Rule 59(e) motion on August 21, 2002.Â  Because Brownâ€™s notice of appeal, \r\n  dated November 12, 2002, was filed and served more than thirty days after his \r\n  receipt of the order denying his initial post-trial motion, it was untimely \r\n  and this court lacks jurisdiction to review the matters raised in the appeal \r\n  that arise from the orders dismissing his lawsuit and denying his Rule 59(e) \r\n  motion. [4] Â  Contrary to what \r\n  Brown suggests in his reply brief, his later motion under Rule 60(b) did not \r\n  toll the time for him to file his notice of appeal. [5] \r\n2.Â  The third matter Brown discussed in his brief, i.e., his right to a jury \r\n  trial, however, was the gravamen of his Rule 60(b) motion; therefore, we hold \r\n  that inasmuch as his notice of appeal was filed within thirty days after he \r\n  had received the order denying that particular motion, we have jurisdiction \r\n  to entertain his discussion on that issue.Â  Nevertheless, assuming without deciding \r\n  that Brownâ€™s objection was properly raised in the trial court and adequately \r\n  briefed on appeal, we hold the special circuit judge had the authority to dismiss \r\n  this lawsuit, even if the effect of the dismissal was to prevent Brown from \r\n  obtaining a jury trial.Â  Contrary to what Brown has argued both to the special \r\n  circuit judge and to this court, the right to a jury trial â€œdoes not exist with \r\n  respect to a complaint or declaration as to which a dismissal or nonsuit is \r\n  proper.â€ [6] \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.\r\n GOOLSBY, HOWARD, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Brown later agreed with the allegations made against him and is \r\n    now serving a twelve-year sentence stemming from charges of lewd conduct and \r\n    criminal sexual conduct with a minor. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  Armstrong is the Charleston County Clerk of Court and Senn represented \r\n    Harper and the Charleston Police Department.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  See Rule 203(b)(1) (requiring that a notice of appeal be served \r\n    on all respondents within thirty days after receipt of written notice of entry \r\n    of the order or judgment, but further providing thatâ€[w]hen a timely . . . \r\n    motion to alter or amend the judgment . . . has been made, the time for appeal \r\n    for all parties shall be stayed and shall run from receipt of written notice \r\n    of entry of the order granting or denying such motionâ€); Mears v.

Van Osdell and Cynthia Graham Howe, both of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The City of Myrtle Beach (the \r\n  City) brought this action seeking a declaration that it is not obligated to \r\n  provide sewer service to Miss Kittyâ€™s, Inc., a business located just outside \r\n  the Cityâ€™s corporate limits.Â  Miss Kittyâ€™s filed a counterclaim alleging the \r\n  City breached its contract to provide sewer service to the business with the \r\n  intent to violate Miss Kittyâ€™s freedom of speech and equal protection rights.Â  \r\n  The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the City on all of Miss \r\n  Kittyâ€™s claims.Â  Miss Kittyâ€™s appeals, arguing summary judgment was premature \r\n  because it did not have a chance to finish discovery on the issue of whether \r\n  the Cityâ€™s alleged breach of contract violated Miss Kittyâ€™s constitutional free \r\n  speech and equal protection rights.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY\r\nThis case arises from several \r\n  years of litigation concerning the Cityâ€™s authority over the property upon which \r\n  Miss Kittyâ€™s is located and the Cityâ€™s obligation to provide sewer service to \r\n  the property.Â  In 1996, the owner of the subject property, David Eliyahu, sought \r\n  sewer service for the property from the City.Â  Because Eliyahuâ€™s property was \r\n  outside the Cityâ€™s corporate limits, the City required Eliyahu to petition the \r\n  City for annexation of the property as a condition of the City providing sewer \r\n  service.Â  Eliyahu filed the petition and also paid the required sewer impact \r\n  fee.Â  Eliyahu later changed his mind, deciding he would rather not have his \r\n  property annexed.Â  The City, however, refused to allow Eliyahu to withdraw his \r\n  annexation petition because it had already connected sewer services to his property. \r\n\r\nEliyahu subsequently brought an action against \r\n  the City seeking a court order invalidating the ordinance annexing his property.Â  \r\n  The circuit court issued a temporary injunction ordering the City not to exercise \r\n  authority over Eliyahuâ€™s property pending a final determination.Â  The injunction \r\n  also provided the City did not have to provide municipal services to the property, \r\n  with the exception of water.\r\nIn late 1996, during the pendency of Eliyahuâ€™s \r\n  suit against the City, Miss Kittyâ€™s became Eliyahuâ€™s tenant on the property.Â  \r\n  Miss Kittyâ€™s operated as an adult entertainment venue.Â  The City continued to \r\n  provide sewer service when Miss Kittyâ€™s opened its business on Eliyahuâ€™s property. [1] \r\nIn October 2000, Eliyahu and the City settled the \r\n  suit after the City agreed with Eliyahuâ€™s demand to repeal the ordinance annexing \r\n  the property, essentially putting the parties in their pre-annexation positions.Â  \r\n  This settlement included an understanding that the City would no longer provide \r\n  sewer service to the property as a result of the annexation being repealed.Â  \r\n  Sewer service was disconnected on October 17, 2000.Â  The following day, Miss \r\n  Kittyâ€™s contacted the City and threatened a lawsuit if sewer services were not \r\n  restored immediately.Â  Miss Kittyâ€™s attorney later repeated the threat of a \r\n  lawsuit.Â  The City responded by filing the present action seeking a declaratory \r\n  judgment that it was not required to provide sewer services to Miss Kittyâ€™s \r\n  or other property not located within the Cityâ€™s corporate limits.Â  Miss Kittyâ€™s \r\n  counterclaimed, asserting causes of action for inverse condemnation and breach \r\n  of contract with intent to violate Miss Kittyâ€™s right to freedom of speech and \r\n  equal protection under the United States and South Carolina constitutions.\r\nIn June 2001, the City moved to dismiss Miss Kittyâ€™s \r\n  amended answer and counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, for failure \r\n  to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  This motion, however, \r\n  was neither heard nor ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Several months later, \r\n  in November 2001, the City filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  That motion \r\n  was heard on March 7, 2002, and the circuit court issued its order granting \r\n  summary judgment to the City on May 15, 2002.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\nA trial court should grant a motion for summary \r\n  judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Fleming v. \r\n  Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  â€œIn determining whether \r\n  any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can \r\n  be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, \r\n  332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  If triable issues of fact exist, \r\n  those issues must go to the jury.Â  Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., \r\n  333 S.C. 714, 717, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMiss Kittyâ€™s argues summary judgment was premature \r\n  because it did not have an opportunity to complete discovery on the issue of \r\n  whether the Cityâ€™s alleged breach of contract violated Miss Kittyâ€™s constitutional \r\n  free speech and equal protection rights.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs an initial matter, we note that the record \r\n  contains no indication that Miss Kittyâ€™s objected to the circuit courtâ€™s consideration \r\n  of the Cityâ€™s summary judgment motion on the grounds discovery was incomplete.Â  \r\n  The only indication that Miss Kittyâ€™s desired to offer additional evidence was \r\n  its request at the conclusion of the summary judgment hearing that it be allowed \r\n  to submit additional affidavits after the hearing.Â  Neither during the five \r\n  months the motion for summary judgment was pending, nor during the hearing itself, \r\n  did Miss Kittyâ€™s request a continuance of the hearing or otherwise ask the circuit \r\n  court to hold consideration of the motion in abeyance to allow for additional \r\n  discovery.Â  As a threshold matter, therefore, Miss Kittyâ€™s argument on appeal \r\n  was not preserved for our review.Â  See Pryor v. Northwest Apartments, \r\n  Ltd., 321 S.C. 524, 529, 469 S.E.2d 630, 633 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding issue \r\n  of whether judge erred in granting summary judgment because discovery requests \r\n  were outstanding was not preserved when appellant did not ask for a continuance \r\n  to complete discovery).\r\nEven had Miss Kittyâ€™s properly raised to the court \r\n  below its argument that further discovery was warranted, we find it was proper \r\n  for the circuit judge to consider the summary judgment motion.Â  Under Rule 56 \r\n  of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, â€œ[a] party seeking to recover \r\n  upon a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim or to obtain a declaratory judgment \r\n  may, at any time after the expiration of 30 days from the commencement of the \r\n  action . . . move . . . for a summary judgment in his favor upon all or any \r\n  part thereof.â€ Rule 56(a), SCRCP.Â Â  Summary judgment, however, is appropriate \r\n  only after the parties to the action have had a full and fair opportunity \r\n  to gather relevant facts and develop the record on the issue. Dawkins v. \r\n  Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439 (2003); see also \r\n  Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; \r\n  Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, 485, 523 S.E.2d 795, 800 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding \r\n  that summary judgment is mandated â€œafter adequate time for discovery against \r\n  a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of \r\n  an element essential to the partyâ€™s case and on which that party will bear the \r\n  burden of proof at trialâ€).Â  The decision to reopen the record to allow the \r\n  proffer of additional evidence at the summary judgment hearing is a matter within \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Bessinger v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 329 \r\n  S.C. 617, 620, 496 S.E.2d 33, 35 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nThe timeline of events in the litigation of this case reveals \r\n  Miss Kittyâ€™s had ample opportunity to pursue discovery on all of the issues \r\n  related to its defenses and counterclaims.Â  The Cityâ€™s initial complaint in \r\n  this case was filed in October 2000.Â  Two months later Miss Kittyâ€™s moved to \r\n  amend its answer and counterclaim to include a defense that terminating its \r\n  sewer services violated its First Amendment rights and a counterclaim for breach \r\n  of contract with intent to violate its constitutional free speech and equal \r\n  protection rights.Â  By consent order, the circuit court granted Miss Kittyâ€™s \r\n  motion to amend in May 2001, and the City served a timely response in June 2001.Â  \r\n  As previously noted, the City did not file its summary judgment motion until \r\n  November 2001, and that motion was not heard until March 2002.Â  Throughout this \r\n  time period, Miss Kittyâ€™s largely failed to conduct or participate in discovery.Â  \r\n  In fact, in June 2001, the City was forced obtain an order from the trial court \r\n  compelling discovery responses from Miss Kittyâ€™s.Â  The City was even prompted \r\n  to move for sanctions when Miss Kittyâ€™s failed to respond as required by the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s order.\r\nMiss Kittyâ€™s, therefore, squandered its opportunity \r\n  to discover material facts and develop the record in this case.Â  Beyond the \r\n  bare assertions contained in the pleadings, there are no facts in the record \r\n  before us which would indicate the Cityâ€™s decision to terminate sewer services \r\n  to the subject property was motivated by a desire to suppress Miss Kittyâ€™s constitutional \r\n  right to free expression or that the City otherwise handled the sewer service \r\n  dispute differently than it would have had Miss Kittyâ€™s not been engaged in \r\n  the adult entertainment business.Â  Indeed, the City was aware of the nature \r\n  of Miss Kittyâ€™s business and provided sewer service to the business for several \r\n  years prior to the settlement with the property owner, Eliyahu. Accordingly, \r\n  Miss Kittyâ€™s has failed to show that additional discovery would shed evidentiary \r\n  light on these allegations that have gone unsupported throughout the pendency \r\n  of this case.Â  See Dawkins, 354 S.C. at 69, 580 S.E.2d at 439 \r\n  (holding that â€œthe nonmoving party must demonstrate the likelihood that further \r\n  discovery will uncover additional relevant evidence and that the party is â€˜not \r\n  merely engaged in a fishing expeditionâ€™â€) (quotingÂ  Baughman v. Am. Tel. \r\n  and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 S.E.2d 537, 544 (1991)).\r\nFor these reasons, we find the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s order granting the motion for summary judgment is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Miss Kittyâ€™s requested additional sewer service for its operation \r\n    on the subject property for which it paid the City an increased sewer impact \r\n    fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-370","title":"Thigpen v.

Thigpen, Jr., Pro se, for Appellant. \r\n        John Steven Rodenberg and Kirsten Leslie Barr, both of Mt. Pleasant, \r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â Kenneth L. Thigpen appeals an order of the circuit court \r\n  affirming the decision of an appellate panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission \r\n  denying his claim for compensation.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nKenneth Thigpen was employed by Baker Homes on January 6, 2000, to disassemble \r\n  a house.Â  While on the site, a large overhead beam fell and Thigpen reacted \r\n  by attempting to catch or block the beam.Â  After seeing a chiropractor, he sought \r\n  the medical attention of Dr. James Aymond.Â  Dr. Aymond indicated Thigpen complained \r\n  of lower back pain and posterior thigh pain.Â  He recommended Thigpen undergo \r\n  an MRI, which later revealed a paracentral disc herniation.Â  Thigpen continued \r\n  to be seen for treatment of his lower back and underwent physical therapy.\r\nOn May 11, 2000, Dr. Aymond indicated that Thigpen was able to lift weights \r\n  up to 60 pounds and recommended he undergo a functional capacity evaluation.Â  \r\n  At his next visit on May 25, 2000, Thigpen was found to be able to lift â€œwithin \r\n  a physical demand of medium.â€Â  He was placed on a weight restriction of 50 pounds.Â  \r\n  Dr. Aymond also found Thigpen had reached Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI) \r\n  and assigned an 8% impairment rating to his spine. \r\nIn April 2000, Thigpen was involved in a non work-related automobile accident.Â  \r\n  In October 2000, he returned to Dr. Aymond, complaining of pain in his hip and \r\n  groin.Â  Thigpen was referred to Dr. McCrosson for evaluation.Â  After an MRI, \r\n  it was determined that Thigpen had right femoral head osteonecrosis. \r\n  [1] Â  The main treatment plan was to perform a core depression of the hip.Â  \r\n  Following a delay in treatment, the femoral head collapsed, requiring Thigpen \r\n  to undergo a hip replacement.Â  \r\nAfter filing for compensation benefits, the single commissioner found that \r\n  the spinal injury was compensable, that there was no compensable injury to Thigpenâ€™s \r\n  hip, and that Thigpen reached MMI on May 25, 2000.Â  In addition, the commissioner \r\n  found Thigpen was not entitled to temporary total disability benefits between \r\n  May 25 and September 8, 2000, and Baker Homes was entitled to a credit towards \r\n  the amount of permanent disability owed for the payments made to Thigpen between \r\n  May 25 and September 8, 2000.Â  \r\nAn Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Commission) affirmed \r\n  the commissionerâ€™s findings and awarded Thigpen $27,396.36 in permanent partial \r\n  disability for an 18% disability to his spine.Â  The amount was offset by the \r\n  payments made between May 25 and September 8, 2000.Â  The Commission reaffirmed \r\n  the finding that the femoral head osteonecrosis was not a compensable injury \r\n  related to the January 6, 2000 accident.Â  The circuit court affirmed and determined \r\n  there was substantial evidence to support the decision of the Commission.Â  This \r\n  appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard \r\n  of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission \r\n  as the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. \r\n  130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere \r\n  scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, \r\n  when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach \r\n  the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, \r\n  341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  â€œIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, \r\n  the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn an appeal from the Commission, this court may not substitute \r\n  its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on \r\n  questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2003).Â  The appellate \r\n  court can reverse or modify the Commissionâ€™s decision only if the claimantâ€™s \r\n  substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by \r\n  an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, \r\n  and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThigpen raises a total of ten issues in his pro se brief.Â  However \r\n  only three issues were properly presented to the circuit court.Â  Any issue raised \r\n  to this court must previously been raised to and ruled upon by the commission \r\n  and the circuit court. [2] Â  See Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., \r\n  353 S.C. 339, 352, 577 S.E.2d 475, 481-82 (Ct. App. 2003) (noting that an issue \r\n  cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to \r\n  and ruled upon by the trial court).Â Â Â  \r\nTherefore, the only issues that are properly preserved \r\n  for our review are the three that were ruled upon by the Commission and presented \r\n  for appellate review to the circuit court.Â  See Rodney v. Michelin \r\n  Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 517, 466 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1996) (â€œArguments not \r\n  raised to the workersâ€™ compensation commission or to the circuit court are not \r\n  preserved for appeal.â€).Â  The three issues which are preserved for our review \r\n  include whether the Commission properly determined:Â  1) the femoral head osteonecrosis \r\n  was not causally related to the January 2000 accident; 2) Thigpen reached MMI \r\n  as to his spinal injury in May 2000 and is not entitled to any further medical \r\n  treatment for his hip or his spine; and 3) Thigpen was not entitled to temporary \r\n  total disability payments from May 25, 2000 through September 8, 2000, and Respondent \r\n  is entitled to a credit for these payments against the amount of permanent partial \r\n  disability it is required to pay.Â Â  \r\nI.Â Â Coverage for the Hip Injury\r\nThigpen contends the Commission erred in finding he was not entitled to compensation \r\n  benefits for his alleged hip injury.Â  He maintains the evidence indicates the \r\n  injury was an injury by accident sustained during the course of his employment.Â  \r\n  We find there is evidence in the record to support the Commissionâ€™s determination \r\n  that the hip injury was not causally related to the January 2000 accident.\r\nDr. Aymondâ€™s medical notes indicate Thigpen complained of lower back pain, \r\n  which radiated through his thighs.Â  Throughout several months of visits with \r\n  Dr. Aymond for follow-up and treatment, there is no mention in the medical records \r\n  of a complaint of hip pain.Â  Thigpen did not complain of pain in the hip or \r\n  the groin until October of 2000.Â  In a letter regarding his treatment of Thigpen, \r\n  Dr. Aymond explained:\r\n\r\n  In my experience, avascular necrosis from trauma is only suspected after \r\n    a severe pelvic injury, such as a hip dislocation that disrupts the blood \r\n    supply to the femoral head.Â  There are other nontraumatic reasons for avascular \r\n    necrosis, but these by definition do not involve any trauma in my experience.\r\n  Therefore, in my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Mr. \r\n    Thigpenâ€™s avascular necrosis of his right hip is not related to his work-related \r\n    injury in January of 2000.Â  \r\n\r\nThigpen was referred to Dr. McCrosson for evaluation of the \r\n  hip.Â  Dr. McCrosson initially indicated the femoral head osteonecrosis might \r\n  have been related to Thigpenâ€™s work injury on January 6, 2000.Â  However, he \r\n  later indicated:Â  â€œAt this time I feel that there are too many factors confounding \r\n  the issue and that it is impossible to say with any medical certainty what the \r\n  cause of Mr. Thigpenâ€™s avascular necrosis is.â€Â  Dr. Rustin, who also saw Thigpen \r\n  for his hip injury, stated, â€œit is impossible for me to attribute the probability \r\n  of the cause of his avascular necrosis to his workerâ€™s comp event.â€Â  \r\nWe find that substantial evidence exists in the record to support the finding \r\n  of the Commission that Thigpenâ€™s injury is not the result of an injury by accident \r\n  arising out of and in the course of his employment. \r\nII.Â Entitlement to Benefits Beyond May 25, 2000\r\nThigpen asserts that he should be entitled to compensation and continued medical \r\n  care for his femoral head osteonecrosis.Â  As we have determined above, Thigpenâ€™s \r\n  hip injury is not causally related to the January 2000 accident.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  he is not entitled to continued medical care for his hip.\r\nWe construe a portion of Thigpenâ€™s argument as questioning the finding that \r\n  he reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) as to his compensable injury.Â  \r\n  â€œMaximum medical improvement is a term used to indicate that a person has reached \r\n  such a plateau that in the physicianâ€™s opinion there is no further medical care \r\n  or treatment which will lessen the degree of impairment.â€Â  Oâ€™Banner v. Westinghouse \r\n  Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24, 28, 459 S.E.2d 324, 327 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The \r\n  Commission must make a factual determination of whether the claimant has reached \r\n  MMI.Â  See id.Â  This Court would only reverse the finding of the \r\n  Commission if it is unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  See Shealy, \r\n  341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nIn this case, Dr. Aymond indicated in a medical record dated May 25, 2000: \r\n  Â â€œI believe the patient has reached [MMI] and has an impairment of 8% impairment \r\n  of the spine.Â  We will plan to see him in follow-up as needed.â€Â  While Thigpen \r\n  does not specifically challenge the finding that he reached MMI as to his spinal \r\n  injury, the above documentation provides support for the Commissionâ€™s finding.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the determination that Thigpen reached MMI on May 25, 2000 and \r\n  is not entitled to further temporary total disability benefits is supported \r\n  by substantial evidence.Â  \r\nIII.Â Benefits Between May and September 2000\r\nThigpen contends the Commission erred in determining that he was not entitled \r\n  to benefits from May 25 to September 8, 2000.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œWorkersâ€™ compensation awards have generally provided \r\n  for temporary total disability benefits until maximum medical improvement, at \r\n  which point a claimant receives permanent partial disability if warranted.â€Â  \r\n  Oâ€™Banner, 319 S.C. at 28, 459 S.E.2d at 326.Â  The Commission must make \r\n  a factual determination of whether the claimant has reached MMI, and therefore, \r\n  the employer would no longer be liable for temporary total disability compensation.\r\nDr. Aymond found Thigpen reached MMI on May 25, 2000, and assigned 8% impairment \r\n  to the spine.Â  Baker Homes continued to pay Thigpen temporary total disability \r\n  compensation until September 8, 2000, when the payments were stopped after Baker \r\n  Homes received videotaped evidence that Thigpen was able to work.Â  The surveillance \r\n  records detailing the videotape indicate that on September 8, 2000, Thigpen \r\n  was seen lifting vinyl siding, using tools, climbing a ladder, and bending over \r\n  while working at a job site.Â  \r\nAs we have determined the Commission correctly \r\n  found Thigpen reached MMI by May 25, 2000, it also correctly determined he was \r\n  then entitled to permanent partial disability and not temporary total disability.Â  \r\n  The Commission awarded Thigpen 18% disability to the spine and required permanent \r\n  partial disability compensation of $27,396.36. \r\nWe find the decision denying Thigpen temporary total disability benefits \r\nfrom May 25 to September 8, 2000 was supported by substantial evidence.Â  In addition, \r\nBaker Homes is entitled to a credit for the amount of temporary total disability \r\npayments made to Thigpen during this period of time.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nMost of the issues raised by Thigpen attempt to relitigate issues which were \r\n  abandoned after an adverse decision by the single commissioner and later the \r\n  Commission.Â  Accordingly, these issues were not preserved for our review on \r\n  appeal.Â  We find there is substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s findings \r\n  that the femoral head osteonecrosis was not compensable, that Thigpen had reached \r\n  MMI on May 25, 2000 and was not entitled to additional temporary total disability \r\n  benefits, and that Baker Homes was entitled to a credit for benefits paid between \r\n  May 25 and September 8, 2000.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  This is also referred to in the record as avascular \r\n    necrosis or AVN.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  We note that Thigpen has failed to follow the South Carolina Appellate \r\n    Court Rules in his filings with this court.Â  His brief is conclusory and contains \r\n    no supporting authority for his positions.Â  See First Sav.

Dunlap, Steven \r\n  D. Hale, and Roger K. Meagher (â€œAppellantsâ€) brought this legal malpractice \r\n  action against Pierce, Couch, Hendrickson, Baysinger &amp; Green; H. Blanton \r\n  Brown &amp; Associates, P.C.; Brown &amp; Sanger, P.C.; and Young Clement Rivers \r\n  &amp; Tisdale, LLP (â€œRespondentsâ€). Appellants allege that Respondents were \r\n  negligent in pursuing a case that lacked legal merit, or in the alternative, \r\n  improperly handled the litigation. The trial judge granted Respondentsâ€™ motions \r\n  for summary judgment, finding the claims were barred by the statute of limitations, \r\n  collateral estoppel, and res judicata. We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS \r\nThe Landmark group owned and managed golf resorts \r\n  across the country. In 1988, Landmarkâ€™s parent company, Clock Tower Place Investments, \r\n  Ltd., established a self-funded health and welfare plan for its employees called \r\n  the Landmark Group Insurance ProgramÂ  (â€œthe Planâ€). The Plan was set up as an \r\n  Employee Welfare Benefit Plan in accordance with ERISA.Â  In 1991, Landmark declared \r\n  bankruptcy and was soon controlled by the Resolution Trust Corporation (â€œRTCâ€).Â  \r\n  RTC created the Landmark Trust (â€œthe Trustâ€) to oversee the Plan during the \r\n  bankruptcy and receivership.Â  In 1993, RTC hired Gloria Robinson as the Plan \r\n  administrator and appointed Michael Welch and V. Jackson Carney (â€œOriginal Trusteesâ€) \r\n  as the trustees of the Trust. Robinson eventually learned that Landmark had \r\n  paid more than one million dollars in benefits out of the Plan to certain unqualified, \r\n  independent contractors [2]  and \r\n  their dependents. \r\nIn November of 1995, the Trust submitted \r\n  a case memorandum to RTC requesting the allocation of funds to Clock Tower to \r\n  repay the amount of the ineligible claims to the Trust.Â  RTC denied the claim.Â  \r\n  The following month, Robinson and the Original Trustees hired Respondents and \r\n  filed an action (â€œRobinson Iâ€) against Landmark, Clock Tower, the FDIC, and \r\n  RTC seeking reimbursement for the payments to the ineligible independent contractors. \r\n  Clock Tower counterclaimed against the Original Trustees on behalf of the Trust, \r\n  alleging Robinson and the Original Trustees breached their fiduciary duty and \r\n  wasted the Trustâ€™s assets by hiring Respondents to pursue Robinson I.Â  On March \r\n  28, 1996, the trial court dismissed Robinsonâ€™sÂ  and the Original Trusteesâ€™ claims \r\n  for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Clock Tower continued to pursue its \r\n  counterclaims. [3] Â  On April \r\n  25, 1996, Clock Tower informed the Original Trustees they would be removed effective \r\n  May 26, 1996.Â  Clock Tower then replaced the Original Trustees with Michael \r\n  Dunlap, Steven Hale, and Roger Meagher (â€œAppellant Trusteesâ€).Â  Dunlap was appointed \r\n  on March 8, 1996, and Hale and Meagher on June 1, 1996.Â  The Appellant Trustees \r\n  are former employees of the FDIC.Â  \r\nOn June 13, 1996, Appellant Trustees \r\n  fired Respondents. In April of 1997, Clock Tower, acting on behalf of the Trust \r\n  and with assistance from the Appellant Trustees, moved to disgorge attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees from the Original Trustees and Respondents.Â  The trial court granted the \r\n  motion in part and ordered Respondents to return all fees unused as of June \r\n  13, 1996.Â  On August 31, 1997, the Plan was terminated due to lack of employees \r\n  or Plan participants.Â  \r\nAppellants filed the current action on May 28, 1999.Â  They alleged that Respondents \r\n  were negligent and performed unnecessary work. Appellants sought to disgorge \r\n  the fees paid to Respondents.Â  Respondents filed motions for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  At the August 10, 2001 hearing, the trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motions, \r\n  deeming Appellantsâ€™ claim barred by the statute of limitations, collateral estoppel \r\n  and res judicata.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in finding that this action is barred \r\n      under the statute of limitations?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in finding that this action is barred \r\n      under res judicata because of the previous action to disgorge payments?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial court err in finding this action is barred under \r\n      the settlement and release from the previous action?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.\r\n    Did the trial court ignore evidence of Appellantsâ€™ damages?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court \r\n  applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: \r\n  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Baril \r\n  v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 352 S.C. 271, 279, 573 S.E.2d 830, 835 (Ct. App. \r\n  2002).Â  â€œSummary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, depositions, answers \r\n  to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if \r\n  any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the \r\n  moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Id. at 280, \r\n  573 S.E.2d at 835.\r\nLAW/ANALYSISÂ  \r\nAppellants argue that the trial court erred in finding that the \r\n  statute of limitations had expired prior to the commencement of this action.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder Rule 3(b), SCRCP, an action is commenced, and the statute of limitations \r\n  tolled, by filing and serving the summons and complaint.Â  The statute of limitations \r\n  â€œupon a contract, obligation, or liability, express or impliedâ€ expires after \r\n  three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (Supp. 2003). The statute of limitations \r\n  on a negligence claim accrues at the time of the negligence or when facts and \r\n  circumstances would put a person of common knowledge on notice of a possible \r\n  claim against another party.Â  Â§ 15-3-535.Â  Under the discovery rule, an action \r\n  accrues when the injury is discovered or should have been discovered by reasonable \r\n  diligence.Â  Strong v. Univ. of S.C. Sch. of Med., 316 S.C. 189, 190, \r\n  465 S.E.2d 850, 852 (1994).Â  The injured party is not required to comprehend \r\n  the full extent of the damage or the exact nature of the wrong to start the \r\n  running of the statute.Â  Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 364, 468 \r\n  S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996).Â  All that is required is that the party have inquiry \r\n  notice of a possible claim.Â  Binkley v. Burry, 352 S.C. 286, 297, 573 \r\n  S.E.2d 838, 844 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nThe complaint in this action was served on Respondents on May 28, 1999, but \r\n  at least one trustee, Michael Dunlap, had constructive notice of a claim prior \r\n  to May 28, 1996 because Clock Towerâ€™s counterclaim was a matter of public record \r\n  as of February 1996. See Berry v. McLeod, 328 S.C. 435, 445, 492 \r\n  S.E.2d 794, 799 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œAn individual on inquiry or constructive notice \r\n  is held to be on notice of the contents of documents filed in conformity with \r\n  applicable statutory law, which an inquiry would have revealed.â€). Therefore, \r\n  the trial judge was correct to rule that this action is barred by the statute \r\n  of limitations.\r\nIn addition to constructive notice, Dunlap also had actual notice. He had been \r\n  an FDIC employee from 1990 to February 1996 and became a trustee on March 8, \r\n  1996. He admits that he knew Robinson I was pending and could have obtained \r\n  the pleadings at any time. [4] Â  \r\n  Moreover, Dunlap was copied with Clock Towerâ€™s letter terminating the Original \r\n  Trustees and barring them from making further payments to Respondents.Â  He was \r\n  also copied with the May 1, 1996 letter informing the Original Trustees they \r\n  would be held personally accountable for the payments to Respondents.Â  Additionally, \r\n  on May 23, 1996, Respondents actually provided Dunlap with a copy of Clock Towerâ€™s \r\n  Answer and Counterclaim.Â  On May 26, 1996, the Original Trustees were removed \r\n  and Dunlap became the sole trustee.Â  \r\nWe find that Dunlap, as a trustee, had the knowledge and ability to act against \r\n  Respondents prior to May 28, 1996. That knowledge is imputed to the other trustees. \r\n  See Dorman v. Campbell, 331 S.C. 179, 185, 500 S.E.2d 786, 789 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998) (affirming that â€œa principal is affected with . . . knowledge \r\n  of all [information] of which his agent receives notice while acting within \r\n  the scope of his authorityâ€) (citing Crystal Ice Co. of Columbia, Inc. v. \r\n  First Colonial Corp., 273 S.C. 306, 309, 257 S.E.2d 496, 497 (1979)). Therefore, \r\n  this action cannot lie.\r\nAs Appellantsâ€™ action is time-barred, we do not reach the remaining issues \r\n  on appeal. [5] \r\nCONCLUSIONÂ  \r\nBased on the above, we find that the trial court properly granted Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  motions for summary judgment.Â  Accordingly, the decision isÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The independent contractors were golf pros for \r\n    the resorts.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  On September 1, 2000, Clock Tower, \r\n    Appellants, and the Original Trustees entered into a settlement agreement \r\n    that released the Original Trustees from any liability in connection with \r\n    payments to Respondents and acknowledged that the Original Trustees fulfilled \r\n    their fiduciary obligations to the Trust and the Plan.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The trial court dismissed the Original Trusteesâ€™ \r\n    claims in Robinson I on March 28, 1996, but that was after Dunlap had become \r\n    a trustee.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  See Futch v.

Tetterton, of Camden, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this divorce action, the \r\n  appealed order (1) granted Sylvia Crawford, the wife, a divorce from Lawrence \r\n  Crawford, the husband, on the ground of a one-year separation, (2) granted both \r\n  parties sole and exclusive possession of the property in their respective possessions, \r\n  and (3) restored the wifeâ€™s maiden name.Â  The husband appeals.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\n1.Â  We find no merit to the husbandâ€™s argument \r\n  that the family court judge who heard the matter should have recused himself \r\n  because that same judge also presided in a matter involving the Department of \r\n  Social Services against the husband.Â  See Roper v. Dynamique Concepts, \r\n  Inc., 316 S.C. 131, 139, 147 S.E.2d 218, 223 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œA judge is \r\n  not required to recuse himself merely because he presided over other proceedings \r\n  on the same or related cases.â€); Payne v. Holiday Towers, Inc., 283 S.C. \r\n  210, 217, 321 S.E.2d 179, 183 (Ct. App.1984) (â€œWhen no evidence is presented \r\n  other than prior appearances by a party which resulted in â€˜adverseâ€™ rulings \r\n  by the judge, the judge is not required to recuse himself.â€).Â  Here, although \r\n  the husband appears to allege on appeal that the other proceeding resulted in \r\n  â€œcontinual bias actionsâ€ against him, he offered no evidence, by affidavit or \r\n  otherwise, to show the presiding family court judge could not be impartial in \r\n  this case.\r\n2.Â  The family court ordered that the marital property \r\n  in the possession of each party be the sole and exclusive property of that party, \r\n  free from any claims of the other.Â Â  The husband alleges error in the family \r\n  courtâ€™s decision to confirm the wifeâ€™s right to the marital property in her \r\n  possession.Â  We find no error.Â  \r\nThe wife testified that she took clothes belonging \r\n  to herself and the children, the partiesâ€™ living room set, the washer and dryer, \r\n  and the refrigerator.Â  The husband alleges on appeal that the wife had taken \r\n  into possession other items that she did not mention at trial, including jewelry, \r\n  electronic equipment, credit cards, and social security benefits.Â  At the conclusion \r\n  of the hearing, the family court agreed to take the issue of equitable distribution \r\n  under advisement pending the husbandâ€™s provision of written information of â€œvaluation \r\n  of all of the items in the mobile home in addition to the items that [the \r\n  wife] hasâ€ (emphasis added).Â  The family court requested the husband to \r\n  â€œmark which items [the wife] has and which items . . . are still left in there.â€Â  \r\n  Although the husband provided a statement alleging the wife owed him $24,700 \r\n  in social security benefits and had taken other items of value, the record on \r\n  appeal does not contain, as the family court requested, a valuation of the items \r\n  to which the husband retained possession.Â  Moreover, the husband does not appear \r\n  to dispute the findings in the appealed order that he had retained possession \r\n  of the marital real estate, the remaining household furnishings, and two automobiles.Â  \r\n  As the wife notes in her brief, the evidence could support a finding that the \r\n  value of the items that she took represented a very small portion of the total \r\n  assets of the marriage.Â  Under these circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion \r\n  in the family courtâ€™s decision to award the wife the marital property that she \r\n  agreed was in her possession.Â  See Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. \r\n  85, 97, 561 S.E.2d 610, 616(Ct. App. 2002) (citing the principle that, absent \r\n  an abuse of discretion, the family courtâ€™s apportionment of marital property \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal).\r\n3.Â  The husband appears to raise several additional \r\n  matters on appeal; however, in his brief, he failed to present a concise and \r\n  direct statement for these issues, preferring to include discussion on them \r\n  within the arguments for which statements were provided.Â  As an appellate court, \r\n  we are not at liberty to consider these other matters because they have not \r\n  been preserved for appeal.Â  See Langehans v. Smith, 347 S.C. 348, \r\n  352, 554 S.E.2d 681, 683 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œAn appellate brief must be divided \r\n  into as many parts as there are issues to be argued, and an issue is not preserved \r\n  for appeal if appellantâ€™s brief does not conform to these requirements. . . \r\n  . [I]t is error for the appellate court to consider issues not properly raised \r\n  to it.â€).\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-382","title":"State v.

Teague, General \r\n  Counsel Frank L. Valenta; South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nTimothy Clay Kulp, of North Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â We reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  reversing the administrative decision and ordering the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to restore McDanielâ€™s driverâ€™s license.\r\nFACTS\r\nWilliam McDaniel was arrested for driving under the influence of \r\n  alcohol.Â  After he was arrested, McDaniel was transported to the police station \r\n  where he was offered a DataMaster breath test. McDaniel refused to submit to \r\n  the breath test. As a result of refusing to take the breath test, McDanielâ€™s \r\n  driverâ€™s license was suspended for a period of 90 days pursuant to S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950. \r\nMcDaniel requested an administrative \r\n  hearing through the DMV. After hearing the matter, the hearing officer sustained \r\n  the action taken by the DMV. McDaniel appealed the administrative decision to \r\n  the circuit court, which reversed the administrative hearing officerâ€™s decision \r\n  finding that evidence presented at the hearing did not establish that McDaniel \r\n  was advised in writing of his rights enumerated in section 56-5-2950. The DMV \r\n  appeals the circuit courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court err by substituting its judgment for \r\n  that of the administrative agency on a question of fact when substantial evidence \r\n  existed to support the administrative decision?\r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW\r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed \r\n  correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence. Kearse \r\n  v. State Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Comm'n, 318 S.C. 198, 199, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  892, 893 (1995).Â  Substantial evidence is defined as â€œsuch evidence as a reasonable \r\n  mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.â€Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., \r\n  276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981).Â  A court may not substitute its \r\n  judgment for that of an agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions \r\n  of fact unless the agency's findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, \r\n  probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. Rodney v. Michelin \r\n  Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 519, 466 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe DMV asserts the trial court exceeded its scope \r\n  of review when the trial court substituted its judgment regarding a question \r\n  of fact when there was substantial evidence in the record to support administrative \r\n  agencyâ€™s findings.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nSection 56-5-2950(a)(1) sets forth the procedures regarding \r\n  implied consent to testing for drugs or alcohol.Â  The statute mandates, in pertinent \r\n  part, that: \r\n\r\nNo tests may be administered or samples obtained unless \r\n  the person has been informed in writing that:\r\nâ€¦\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he does not have to take the test \r\n  or give the samples, but that his privilege to drive must be suspended or denied \r\n  for at least ninety days if he refuses to submit to the tests and that his refusal \r\n  may be used against him in court;\r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his privilege to drive must be suspended \r\n  for at least thirty days if he takes the tests or gives the samples and has \r\n  an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more;\r\n  3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he has the right to have a qualified \r\n  person of his own choosing conduct additional independent tests at his expense;\r\n  4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he has the right to request an administrative \r\n  hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension; and\r\n  5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if he does not request an administrative \r\n  hearing or if his suspension is upheld at the administrative hearing, he must \r\n  enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a) (Supp. 2003).\r\nIn reviewing Officer Usryâ€™s testimony, we believe \r\n  there was substantial evidence to support the administrative officerâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\n  Officer Usry testified that she read the Implied Consent Rights form to McDaniel \r\n  and issued a copy of the rights to McDaniel prior to attempting to administer \r\n  the DataMaster test. Accordingly, McDaniel was advised, in writing of his rights \r\n  as they are enumerated in section 56-5-2950.Â  It is not required that the administrative \r\n  officer enumerate that each portion of the statute has been satisfied, only \r\n  that substantial evidence exist to support his decision.Â  Therefore, the trial \r\n  court erred in reversing the administrative officerâ€™s decision.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, the decision of the circuit \r\n  court is\r\nREVERSED. \r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-392","title":"State v.

Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia, \r\n  and Solicitor Edgar Lewis Clements, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tracy Willard Daniels was charged \r\n  with murder following a shooting death at his home.Â  His testimony at trial, \r\n  that the shooting was accidental, differed significantly from his statements \r\n  given at the scene and at the police station.Â  The trial court submitted voluntary \r\n  manslaughter as a lesser-included offense to the jury over Danielsâ€™ objection \r\n  and the jury convicted him of that charge. Â He appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  to submit voluntary manslaughter as a lesser-included offense of the indicted \r\n  offense of murder.Â  The statement Daniels gave at the police station, that the \r\n  shooting occurred immediately after the victim cut him, trying to cut off his \r\n  thumb, and threatened to turn his â€œinsides out,â€ was sufficient to support the \r\n  voluntary manslaughter charge.Â  See State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. \r\n  352, 359, 535 S.E.2d 420, 424 (2000) (defining voluntary manslaughter as the \r\n  unlawful killing of another person in sudden heat of passion upon sufficient \r\n  legal provocation); State v. Lowry, 315 S.C. 396, 399, 434 S.E.2d 272, \r\n  274 (1993) (â€œTo warrant a courtâ€™s eliminating the offense of manslaughter, it \r\n  should very clearly appear that there is no evidence whatsoever tending to reduce \r\n  the crime from murder to manslaughter.â€); Locklair, 341 S.C. at 360, \r\n  535 S.E.2d at 424 (explaining sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation \r\n  is such as would â€œrender the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflectionâ€); \r\n  State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. 538, 549, 500 S.E.2d 489, 495 (1998) (noting \r\n  â€œfear can constitute a basis for voluntary manslaughterâ€ as the mind can be \r\n  rendered incapable of cool reflection by a number of strong emotions); State \r\n  v. Johnson, 333 S.C. 62, 65, 508 S.E.2d 29, 31 (1998) (â€œAlthough words alone \r\n  may not constitute sufficient legal provocation, words accompanied by some overt, \r\n  threatening act may be sufficient.â€).Â  \r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in excluding testimony that the victimâ€™s medical condition and the substances \r\n  in his system might have made him agitated and affected his aggressiveness.Â  \r\n  This evidence was speculative, might have confused the jury, and might have \r\n  unfairly prejudiced the jury against the victim.Â  See Rule 403, SCRE \r\n  (providing relevant evidence â€œmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially \r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading \r\n  the jury . . .â€); State v.

Smith, Jr., of Greenvill, for Appellants.\r\nSarah S. Purnell, G. Dewey Oxner, Jr., of Greenville, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The estate of Tony Foster, \r\n  Jr. (the Estate) filed a wrongful death claim against the Greenville Memorial \r\n  Hospital System (Greenville Memorial).Â  The trial court granted Greenville Memorialâ€™s \r\n  motion to dismiss, finding a prior judicial determination, that Greenville Memorial \r\n  was not negligent, barred the subsequent wrongful death claim.Â  The Estate appeals.Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1] \r\n FACTS\r\n   In January 1992, four-year-old Tony \r\n    Foster, Jr., was brought into the Greenville Memorial emergency room suffering \r\n    from dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea.Â  Although a CT scan was ordered upon \r\n    Tonyâ€™s admittance to the hospital, a delay in obtaining the CT scan led to \r\n    a delay in diagnosing him with hydrocephalus.Â  Tony subsequently sustained \r\n    severe neurological injuries and thereafter remained in a vegetative state.Â Â  \r\n    Tonyâ€™s mother, acting as his guardian ad litem, brought a medical \r\n    malpractice action in May 1993, arguing the doctors employed by Greenville \r\n    Memorial were negligent in failing to timely diagnose and treat Tonyâ€™s condition. \r\n    [2] Â  After the trial in November 1995, the jury returned a verdict for \r\n    Greenville Memorial.Â  This Court affirmed in Keaton v. Greenville Memâ€™l \r\n    Hosp., Op. No. 97-UP-379 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Aug. 28, 1997).Â  Our state \r\n    Supreme Court affirmed, as modified, this Courtâ€™s opinion and upheld the juryâ€™s \r\n    verdict for Greenville Memorial.Â  Keaton v. Greenville Memâ€™l Hosp., \r\n    334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999).Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n Tony died November 28, 1999, as a result \r\n    of his injuries.Â  The Estate filed a wrongful death action against Greenville \r\n    Memorial in October 2001, alleging negligence by Greenville Memorialâ€™s employees \r\n    resulted in Tonyâ€™s injuries.Â  In its answer, Greenville Memorial denied the \r\n    allegations and affirmatively pled the defenses that the complaint failed \r\n    to state a cause of action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, and that the \r\n    case was barred by res judicata.Â  At the hearing on the motion to dismiss \r\n    pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, Greenville Memorial informed the trial court \r\n    that the negligence issues had already been determined in the prior personal \r\n    injury case.\r\n  The trial court granted the motion based upon \r\n    several grounds.Â  The judge found the Estateâ€™s complaint failed to state facts \r\n    sufficient to constitute a cause of action because it did not allege: (1) \r\n    that Tony died; (2) the date Tony died; or (3) that Greenville Memorialâ€™s \r\n    negligence caused his death.Â  After considering information presented by Greenville \r\n    Memorial regarding the prior lawsuit, the trial court further found the instant \r\n    case was barred by both the wrongful death statute and the doctrine of collateral \r\n    estoppel.Â  The Estate appeals. \r\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n     The Estate appeals the trial courtâ€™s \r\n      decision to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  However, \r\n      as in the present case, if the trial court considers matters outside the \r\n      complaint on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, â€œthe \r\n      motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided \r\n      in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present \r\n      all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.â€Â  Rule 12(b), SCRCP; \r\n      Gilbert v. Miller, 356 S.C. 25, 27, 586 S.E.2d 861, 862 (Ct. App. \r\n      2003) (holding that where the trial court considers matters outside the \r\n      pleadings the motion to dismiss is converted to one for summary judgment). [3] \r\n     LAW/ANALYSIS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      The Estate argues the trial court \r\n      erred in granting Greenville Memorialâ€™s motion because â€œa prior determination \r\n      in a tort action does not bind nor bar a subsequent action for wrongful \r\n      death.â€Â Â  We do not agree.\r\n       Section 15-51-10 of the wrongful death statute \r\n        provides:\r\n\r\n      Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful \r\n        act, neglect or default of another and the act, neglect or default is \r\n        such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party \r\n        injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, \r\n        the person who would have been liable, if death had not ensued, \r\n        shall be liable to an action for damages. . . .\r\n\r\n      S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-51-10 (1977) (emphasis \r\n        added).\r\n      Section 15-51-60 of the wrongful \r\n        death statute addresses the effect of an action filed prior to the individualâ€™s \r\n        death.Â  This section states the wrongful death statute â€œshall not apply \r\n        to any case in which the person injured has, for such injury, brought \r\n        action, which has proceeded to trial and final judgment before his or \r\n        her death.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-51-60 (1977).Â  \r\n      When interpreting these statutes, we must determine \r\n        the intent of the Legislature.Â  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., \r\n        353 S.C. 31, 39, 577 S.E.2d 202, 207 (2003) (â€œThe cardinal rule of statutory \r\n        construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.â€).Â  \r\n        If the terms of the statute are clear, this Court must apply the terms \r\n        according to their plain and ordinary meaning.Â  Paschal v. State Election \r\n        Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 436, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995).Â  \r\n      Section 15-51-10 plainly states that a wrongful death \r\n        action may be filed on behalf of a deceased in cases where the deceased \r\n        would have been entitled to file a personal injury claim had he or she \r\n        not died.Â  Further, section 15-51-60 is clearly intended to prevent a \r\n        double recovery.Â  It excludes a right of action in the estate where the \r\n        deceased brought and tried an action to a final judgment during the deceasedâ€™s \r\n        lifetime.Â  As such, sections 10 and 60, when read together, stand for \r\n        the proposition that a judgment in a prior personal injury case extinguishes \r\n        the right to pursue a subsequent wrongful death claim.Â  Thus, as the Estate \r\n        would have been prohibited from retrying Tonyâ€™s personal injury case before \r\n        his death, it is prohibited from bringing such a suit at this time.Â  \r\n      Even interpreting the facts in the present \r\n        case in the light most favorable to the Estate, the Estate is barred by \r\n        statute from bringing the wrongful death action because Tony pursued a \r\n        personal injury action to final judgment during his lifetime.Â  As such, \r\n        the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Greenville \r\n        Memorial.\r\n      The Estate, however, cites two \r\n        cases for the proposition that it was permitted to file both a personal \r\n        injury action and a wrongful death action.Â  In Bennett v. Spartanburg \r\n        Ry., Gas &amp; Elec. Co., 97 S.C. 27, 81 S.E. 189 (1914), a husband \r\n        alleged two causes of action in his complaint: he brought a survival action \r\n        on both his behalf and the behalf of his children to recover for their \r\n        loss in the wrongful death of his wife; and an action to recover for wifeâ€™s \r\n        personal injuries and suffering.Â  Our state Supreme Court held the elements \r\n        of damages recoverable in the two causes of action were different, and \r\n        the cases should go forward in separate trials.Â  Bennett, 97 S.C. \r\n        at 30-31, 81 S.E. at 190.Â  \r\n      The Estate also cites Deaton \r\n        v. Gray Trucking Co., 275 F. Supp. 750 (D.S.C. 1967).Â  In Deaton, \r\n        three women were killed in a car accident.Â  The estate of the first woman, \r\n        Pamela, brought a wrongful death action wherein a verdict was rendered \r\n        in favor of the trucking company.Â  Subsequently, an action was filed on \r\n        behalf of the estates of all the women against the trucking company alleging \r\n        a survival action for Pamela and wrongful death actions for the other \r\n        two women.Â  Citing Bennett, the District Court for the District \r\n        of South Carolina held Pamelaâ€™s wrongful death suit was separate and distinct \r\n        from a survival action, and thus the prior judgment did not bar the survival \r\n        action.Â  The court also held that the prior suit did not bar the wrongful \r\n        death actions of the other women because it had not been previously litigated.Â  \r\n        The court denied the defendantâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  Deaton, \r\n        275 F. Supp. at 753-56. \r\n      These cases do not support the \r\n        Estateâ€™s argument in the present case.Â  Bennett discussed whether \r\n        a claim for the death of the decedent and a survival claim could be brought \r\n        in the same action.Â  Deaton dealt with whether a judgment in favor \r\n        of the defendant in a wrongful death cause of action barred a subsequent \r\n        survival action or subsequent wrongful death actions on behalf of the \r\n        estates of different decedents.Â  Although Deaton dealt with the \r\n        question of whether res judicata or collateral estoppel barred the wrongful \r\n        death suits on behalf of the estates of the other two decedents, neither \r\n        Deaton nor Bennett discussed whether a personal injury case \r\n        filed and ultimately decided during the decedentâ€™s lifetime barred a subsequent \r\n        wrongful death claim for that same decedent.Â  Further, these cases were \r\n        decided prior to the enactment of the current version of the wrongful \r\n        death statute.Â  As such, the Estateâ€™s argument has no merit.  [4] Â  \r\n      CONCLUSION\r\n      Because section 15-51-10 read in conjunction \r\n        with section 15-51-60 mandates that a wrongful death action may not be \r\n        filed subsequent to the final determination of a personal injury action \r\n        filed during the decedentâ€™s lifetime, the trial court did not err in granting \r\n        summary judgment to Greenville Memorial.Â  Thus, the trial courtâ€™s order \r\n        granting summary judgment to Greenville Memorial Hospital System is\r\n\r\n      \r\n AFFIRMED. [5] \r\n      HUFF and STILWELL, JJ. and CURETON, \r\n        AJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The Estate subsequently filed an amended complaint in August 1994. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The Estate did not complain below and does not complain now on appeal \r\n    that the trial court improperly considered matters outside the complaint in \r\n    ruling on the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  We note the Estate also argued the trial court erred in finding the \r\n    Estateâ€™s complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause \r\n    of action and in finding the cause of action was barred by collateral estoppel.Â  \r\n    However, as this case is barred by the wrongful death statute, it is not necessary \r\n    to reach the issues raised concerning the adequacy of the pleadings or collateral \r\n    estoppel.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Although the parties and the trial court did not take notice that \r\n    the trial courtâ€™s consideration of matters outside the complaint converted \r\n    the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment, we may affirm the grant \r\n    of summary judgment based on the Record.Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate \r\n    court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment based upon any ground(s) appearing \r\n    in the Record on Appeal.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-398","title":"State v.

Floyd, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-399\r\nSubmitted May 12, 2004 â€“ Filed June 22, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Aileen P. Clare, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, \r\n  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Patrick Guess was convicted \r\n  of second-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor and sentenced to \r\n  twelve years imprisonment.Â  Guessâ€™s appeal was originally filed pursuant to \r\n  Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).Â  After reviewing the record \r\n  and briefs pursuant to Anders, this Court found the only issues of arguable \r\n  merit were whether assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) \r\n  was a lesser-included offense of second-degree CSC with a minor, and, if so, \r\n  whether the trial judge erred in failing to charge the jury on the lesser-included \r\n  offense.Â  The parties have re-briefed these issues, which are the only issues \r\n  considered on appeal.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nThe State presented evidence at \r\n  trial that eighteen-year-old Guess lured his fourteen-year-old neighbor (Victim) \r\n  to an abandoned house and sexually assaulted her.Â  Victim testified that Guess \r\n  grabbed her wrist when he led her to the abandoned house, and there he penetrated \r\n  her vagina during the assault. Â Â Victim further testified that Guess repeatedly \r\n  inserted his penis into her vagina and subsequently ejaculated on the ground.Â  \r\n  Semen collected from Victimâ€™s underwear was confirmed through DNA testing to \r\n  be a positive match to Guess.Â  However, a medical examination of Victim was \r\n  inconclusive as to penetration.Â Â  Guess did not testify at trial.Â  However, \r\n  in his statement to police and in a conversation with Victimâ€™s mother, Guess \r\n  denied sexually assaulting or even touching Victim.Â Â  \r\nAt the close of the evidence, Guess requested a \r\n  charge of ABHAN as a lesser-included offense of second-degree CSC with a minor.Â  \r\n  The court denied the request, and Guess was ultimately convicted of second-degree \r\n  CSC with a minor and sentenced to twelve years imprisonment.Â  Guess appeals.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  Guess argues the trial court erred in failing \r\n    to charge the jury on the law of ABHAN because it is a lesser-included offense \r\n    of second-degree CSC with a minor.Â  Even assuming ABHAN is a lesser-included \r\n    offense of second-degree CSC with a minor, the evidence did not support the \r\n    requested instruction.Â  See Moultrie v. State, 354 S.C. 646, \r\n    648, 583 S.E.2d 436, 437 (2003) (implicitly recognizing ABHAN as a lesser-included \r\n    offense of CSC with a minor).Â  Thus, we find no error.\r\n  The law charged to the jury is determined by \r\n    the evidence presented at trial.Â  State v. Blurton, 352 S.C. 203, 207, \r\n    573 S.E.2d 802, 804 (2002).Â  With regard to lesser-included offenses, â€œ[t]he \r\n    trial judge is required to charge the jury on a lesser[-]included offense \r\n    if there is evidence from which it could be inferred that the defendant committed \r\n    the lesser rather than the greater offense.â€Â  State v. Murphy, 322 \r\n    S.C. 321, 325, 471 S.E.2d 739, 741 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In other words, â€œwhere \r\n    there is no evidence to support a finding that the defendant was guilty of \r\n    the lesser offense, there can be no error in the failure to charge the lesser \r\n    offense.â€Â  State v. Gadsden, 314 S.C. 229, 232, 442 S.E.2d 594, 596-97 \r\n    (1994).Â  This Court cannot reverse the trial courtâ€™s refusal to give a requested \r\n    jury instruction unless the refusal was both erroneous and prejudicial.Â  State \r\n    v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 263, 565 S.E.2d 298, 304 (2002); State v. \r\n    Harrison, 343 S.C. 165, 173, 539 S.E.2d 71, 75 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n  Second-degree CSC with a minor is statutorily \r\n    defined as the sexual battery of a minor between the ages of eleven and fourteen \r\n    years old.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(2) (2003).Â  ABHAN, however, is an â€œunlawful \r\n    act of violent injury accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.â€Â  State \r\n    v. Fennell, 340 S.C. 266, 274, 531 S.E.2d 512, 516 (2000).Â  â€œCircumstances \r\n    of aggravation include the use of a deadly weapon, the intent to commit a \r\n    felony, infliction of serious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or \r\n    physical conditions of the parties, a difference in gender, the purposeful \r\n    infliction of shame and disgrace, taking indecent liberties or familiarities \r\n    with a female, and resistance to lawful authority.â€Â  State v. Primus, \r\n    349 S.C. 576, 580-81, 564 S.E.2d 103, 105-06 (2002).Â  \r\n  In the present case, there is nothing \r\n    in the record that could support a charge of ABHAN.Â  Guess not only verbally \r\n    denied touching Victim, but in his statement to police, he denied having sex \r\n    with her at all.Â  At trial, Guessâ€™s counsel contended, â€œit could be argued \r\n    that [Guess and Victim] were together, and there was no penetration but a \r\n    sexual battery.â€Â  Sexual battery, however, is an element of second-degree \r\n    CSC with a minor.Â  As the trial judge correctly stated, â€œeither sexual intercourse \r\n    occurred or it did not.â€Â Â  If no sexual battery occurred, Guess would simply \r\n    be found not guilty of second-degree CSC with a minor.Â  The evidence does \r\n    not otherwise support a charge of ABHAN.\r\n  Under the evidence presented at trial, we conclude \r\n    the jury could not have inferred Guess took indecent liberties or familiarities \r\n    with the female victim â€“ an aggravating circumstance that would support a \r\n    conviction for ABHAN â€“ without finding him guilty of second-degree CSC with \r\n    a minor.Â  See Moultrie, 354 S.C. at 648, 583 S.E.2d at 437 (â€œUnder \r\n    the evidence presented, respondent was guilty of a sexual battery or no battery \r\n    at all.Â  In such a case, the defendant is not entitled to a charge of ABHAN \r\n    as a lesser-included offense of CSCM.â€).Â  Because there was no evidence to \r\n    support ABHAN, the trial court did not err in declining to charge ABHAN.\r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    Based upon the foregoing, Guessâ€™s \r\n      conviction and sentence are\r\n     AFFIRMED.\r\n    HEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J. and \r\n      CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-400","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHOWARD, \r\n  J.: Daniel Webster Williams was convicted of shoplifting and assault \r\n  of a high and aggravated nature (â€œAHANâ€).Â  The circuit court sentenced Williams \r\n  to nine years imprisonment for shoplifting and one year imprisonment for AHAN.Â  \r\n  On appeal, Williams argues the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to convict and sentence him to nine years imprisonment for shoplifting because \r\n  the indictment against him alleged an incorrect subsection of the shoplifting \r\n  statute.Â  Williams also argues the circuit court erred by denying his request \r\n  to charge the jury on simple assault as a lesser-included offense of AHAN.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nK-martâ€™s loss prevention manager allegedly saw Williams \r\n  concealing childrenâ€™s clothing in the front of his pants and jacket.Â Â  According \r\n  to the loss prevention manager, he attempted to stop Williams as he exited the \r\n  store.Â  Williams proceeded into the K-Mart parking lot, and the loss prevention \r\n  manager grabbed Williamsâ€™ arm.Â  Williams then began swinging at him with a box \r\n  cutter.Â  \r\nAs a result of this incident, Williams was indicted \r\n  and tried for shoplifting and AHAN.Â  At trial, the defense requested a jury \r\n  charge on the offense of simple assault as a lesser-included offense of AHAN.Â  \r\n  The circuit court denied the request.Â  Subsequently, Williams was convicted \r\n  and sentenced to nine years imprisonment for shoplifting and one year imprisonment \r\n  for AHAN.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Indictment\r\nWilliams argues the \r\n  circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict and sentence him \r\n  to nine years imprisonment for shoplifting because the indictment against him \r\n  alleged an incorrect subsection of the shoplifting statute.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIssues related to subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction may be raised at any time.â€Â  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, \r\n  362, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998). A circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  if: â€œ(1) there has been an indictment which sufficiently states the offense; \r\n  (2) there has been a waiver of indictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser included \r\n  offense of the crime charged in the indictment.â€Â  Id.Â Â  â€œThe true test \r\n  of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could be made more definite \r\n  and certain, but whether it contains the necessary elements of the offense intended \r\n  to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared \r\n  to meet.â€Â  Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 \r\n  (1995).Â  \r\nâ€œThe caption of an \r\n  indictment is no part of the finding of the grand jury; instead, it is the body \r\n  of the indictment that is important.â€Â  Tate v. State, 345 S.C. 577, 581, \r\n  549 S.E.2d 601, 603 (2001).Â  If the body of an indictment specifically states \r\n  the essential elements of the crime and is otherwise free from defect, a defect \r\n  in the caption will not cause it to be invalid.Â  Id.\r\nSouth Carolina Code \r\n  Ann. section 16-13-110(A) is the statute prohibiting the offense of shoplifting.Â  \r\n  Section 16-13-110(B), delineating potential sentences based on the value of \r\n  the shoplifted merchandise, provides:\r\n\r\nA person who violates the provisions \r\n  of this section is guilty of a:Â  (1) misdemeanor triable in magistrateâ€™s court \r\n  and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned \r\n  not more than thirty days if the value of the shoplifted merchandise is one \r\n  thousand dollars or less; (2) felony and, upon conviction, must be fined \r\n  not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than five years, or \r\n  both, if the value of the shoplifted merchandise is more than one thousand dollars \r\n  but less than five thousand dollars; (3) felony and, upon conviction, must be \r\n  imprisoned not more than ten years if the value of the shoplifted merchandise \r\n  is five thousand dollars or more.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-110 (B) \r\n  (Cum. Supp. 1995) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nHere, the body of \r\n  the indictment charges Williams with shopliftingÂ  â€œchildrenâ€™s clothing valued \r\n  at approximately Three Hundred Dollars and No Cents ($300.00) . . . in violation \r\n  of Â§ 16-13-110 (Cum. Supp. 1995).â€Â  Although the body of the indictment does \r\n  not specify a subsection, shoplifting $300 of merchandise is a violation of \r\n  subsection (B)(1).Â  However, the caption on the reverse side of the indictment \r\n  references subsection 16-13-110(B)(3), which carries a greater sentence.Â  Williams \r\n  argues the caption incorrectly charges him with violating section 16-13-110 \r\n  (B)(3) even though the body of the indictment charges him with shoplifting merchandise \r\n  valued at three hundred dollars, and the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to \r\n  convict and sentence him under section 16-13-110(B)(3).Â  \r\nWe first note, the \r\n  circuit court did not sentence Williams under section 16-13-110(B)(3).Â  Rather, \r\n  Williams was charged and convicted under section 16-13-110(B)(1) for shoplifting \r\n  merchandise valued at three hundred ($300) dollars, but was sentenced as a third \r\n  or subsequent offender under S.C. Code Ann. section 16-1-57 (Supp.1995) because \r\n  he admittedly had three or more prior convictions for shoplifting.Â  â€œA person \r\n  convicted of an offense for which the term of imprisonment is contingent upon \r\n  the value of the property involved must, upon conviction for a third or subsequent \r\n  offense, be punished as prescribed for a Class E felony.â€Â  A person convicted \r\n  of a Class E felony may be imprisoned for up to ten years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  16-1-20(A)(5) (Supp. 1995); see also State v. Lewis, 325 S.C. \r\n  324, 327, 478 S.E.2d 696, 698 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nFurthermore, the body \r\n  of the indictment in this case contained â€œthe necessary elements of the offense \r\n  intended to be charged and sufficiently apprise[d] the defendantâ€ of the allegations \r\n  against him.Â  Browning, 320 S.C. at 368, 465 S.E.2d at 359.Â  The body \r\n  of the indictment charged Williams with shoplifting $300 of childrenâ€™s clothing \r\n  in violation of section 16-13-110 and did not mention a subsection.Â  As Williams \r\n  was apprised of the charged offense, the error in the caption of the indictment \r\n  did not render the indictment invalid.Â  Tate, 345 S.C. at 581, 549 S.E.2d \r\n  at 603.Â  \r\nAs this was Williamsâ€™ third or subsequent \r\n  conviction for shoplifting, the circuit court properly sentenced him under the \r\n  enhanced penalties of S.C. Code Ann. section 16-1-57 (Supp.1995).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Jury Charge\r\nWilliams argues the circuit court erred by denying \r\n  his request to charge the jury on simple assault as a lesser-included offense \r\n  of AHAN.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe law to be charged is determined from the facts \r\n  presented at trial.â€Â  State v. Lewis, 328 S.C. 273, 278, 494 S.E.2d 115, \r\n  117 (1997).Â  An instruction on a lesser-included offense is required when the \r\n  evidence presented indicates the defendant may be guilty only of a lesser offense.Â  \r\n  A requested charge is properly refused where there is no evidence tending to \r\n  show the defendant was guilty only of the lesser offense.Â  State v. Tyndall, \r\n  336 S.C. 8, 16, 518 S.E.2d 278, 282 (1999).Â  However, a circuit court commits \r\n  reversible error if it fails to give a requested charge if there is evidence \r\n  from which it could be inferred the defendant committed the lesser, rather than \r\n  the greater offense.Â  State v. Sprouse, 325 S.C. 275, 285, 478 \r\n  S.E.2d 871, 877 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nIn determining whether a circuit court \r\n  erred in refusing to give a requested charge, an appellate court must review \r\n  the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  State v. Gadsden, 314 S.C. \r\n  229, 232, 442 S.E.2d 594, 597 (1994); see State v. Caulder, 287 \r\n  S.C. 507, 513, 339 S.E.2d 876, 880 (Ct. App. 1986) (holding when reviewing a \r\n  jury charge, an appellate court must consider the charge as a whole and in light \r\n  of the evidence and issues presented at trial).\r\nâ€œThe test for determining when a crime is a lesser \r\n  included offense is whether the greater of the two offenses includes all the \r\n  elements of the lesser offense.â€Â  Knox v. State, 340 S.C. 81, 84, 530 \r\n  S.E.2d 887, 888 (2000).\r\nAssault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) â€œis an unlawful \r\n  act of violent injury accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 580, 564 S.E.2d 103, 105 (2002).Â  Circumstances \r\n  of aggravation include the use of a deadly weapon, the intent to commit a felony, \r\n  infliction of serious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical \r\n  conditions of the parties, a difference in gender, the purposeful infliction \r\n  of shame and disgrace, taking indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, \r\n  and resistance to lawful authority.Â  Id. at 580-81, 564 S.E.2d. at 105-06.Â  \r\n  â€œ[A]ssault of a high and aggravated nature contains the same elements of ABHAN \r\n  with the exception of the element of touching the victim . . . .â€Â  State \r\n  v. Murphy, 322 S.C. 321, 325, 471 S.E.2d 739, 741 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Simple \r\n  assault is an attempted battery or â€œan unlawful attempt or offer to commit a \r\n  violent injury upon another person, coupled with the present ability to complete \r\n  the attempt or offer by a battery.â€Â  State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 397, \r\n  532 S.E.2d 283, 285 (2000).Â  Thus, assault of a high and aggravated nature contains \r\n  all of the elements of simple assault, plus the circumstance of aggravation.Â  \r\n  Consequently, simple assault is a lesser-included offense of assault of a high \r\n  and aggravated nature.Â  \r\nAt trial, the victim testified Williams attempted \r\n  to strike him with a box cutter.Â  The State argued the use of a box cutter constituted \r\n  the aggravating circumstance.Â  In contrast, Williams testified he did not have \r\n  any weapons, and he swung at the victim two or three times with his fist when \r\n  the victim grabbed him without explanation in the parking lot. \r\nWilliamsâ€™ testimony provides evidence from which \r\n  the jury could find there was no box cutter, and in a light most favorable to \r\n  Williams, no circumstance of aggravation.Â  Therefore, his testimony would support \r\n  a conclusion he was guilty of the lesser offense of simple assault.Â  See \r\n  Â State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 397, 532 S.E.2d 283, 285 (2000) (holding \r\n  simple assault is an attempted battery or â€œan unlawful attempt or offer to commit \r\n  a violent injury upon another person, coupled with the present ability to complete \r\n  the attempt or offer by a battery.â€).Â  Consequently, the circuit court erred \r\n  in refusing to charge the lesser-included offense of simple assault.Â  Sprouse, \r\n  325 S.C. at 285, 478 S.E.2d at 877.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Williamsâ€™ conviction for shoplifting is AFFIRMED.Â  \r\n  Williamsâ€™ conviction for assault of a high and aggravated nature is REVERSED, \r\n  and the case is REMANDED for a new trial on the indictment for AHAN.Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.

Teague, SeniorÂ  Asst. General Counsel, Frank L. Valenta, Jr., General \r\n  Counsel, SC Dept. of Motor Vehicles, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nTimothy Clay Kulp, of N. Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The circuit court reversed \r\n  the ruling of an administrative officer to suspend the license of James Schuler. \r\n  We reverse.\r\n \r\n  FACTS\r\nAn officer for the Mount Pleasant Police Department \r\n  arrested Respondent James Schuler on June 15, 2002. A citizen observed a vehicle \r\n  driving erratically and called the officer; the officer made the same observation. \r\n  The officer stopped the car, approached the car, asked the driver for his license, \r\n  registration, and insurance. Respondent was the driver. The officer smelled \r\n  alcohol on Respondent. Respondent was unsteady and his speech was slurred. Respondent \r\n  admitted that he had drunk some alcohol that evening. \r\nThe officer placed Respondent under arrest for \r\n  driving under the influence and transported him to the police department. There, \r\n  the officer asked Respondent to take a DataMaster test. The officer is a certified \r\n  DataMaster operator. The officer placed Respondent in the DataMaster room and \r\n  told Respondent he was being videotaped. The officer read and gave the \r\n  Advisement of Implied Consent Rights / Videotaping to Respondent. However, Respondent \r\n  refused to take the test and the machine registered a refusal. Accordingly, \r\n  Respondentâ€™s driving license was suspended. \r\nRespondent requested an administrative hearing. \r\n  The administrative officer sustained the suspension. Respondent appealed to \r\n  the circuit court. The circuit court reversed, finding that to simply read Respondentâ€™s \r\n  rights to him did not meet the statutory requirements under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  56-5-2950. SCDPS appeals.\r\nISSUEÂ  \r\nDid the trial court err by reversing the ruling \r\n  of the administrative officer finding that there was no substantial evidence \r\n  to support it?Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSISÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed \r\n  correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence. Kearse \r\n  v. State Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Comm'n, 318 S.C. 198, 199, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  892, 893 (1995).Â  Substantial evidence is defined as â€œsuch evidence as a reasonable \r\n  mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.â€Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., \r\n  276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981).Â  A court may not substitute its \r\n  judgment for that of an agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions \r\n  of fact unless the agency's findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, \r\n  probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. Rodney v. Michelin \r\n  Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 519, 466 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1996).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSCDPS asserts the trial court exceeded its scope of review \r\n  when the trial court substituted its judgment regarding a question of fact when \r\n  there was substantial evidence in the record to support administrative agencyâ€™s \r\n  findings.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nSection 56-5-2950(a)(1) sets forth the procedures regarding \r\n  implied consent to testing for drugs or alcohol.Â  The statute mandates, in pertinent \r\n  part, that: \r\n\r\nNo tests may be administered or samples obtained unless \r\n  the person has been informed in writing that:\r\nâ€¦\r\n  1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He does not have to take the test \r\n  or give the samples, but that his privilege to drive must be suspended or denied \r\n  for at least ninety days if he refuses to submit to the tests and that his refusal \r\n  may be used against him in court;\r\n  2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His privilege to drive must be suspended \r\n  for at least thirty days if he takes the tests or gives the samples and has \r\n  an alcohol concentration of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent or more;\r\n  3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has the right to have a qualified \r\n  person of his own choosing conduct additional independent tests at his expense;\r\n  4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has the right to request an administrative \r\n  hearing within thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension; and\r\n  5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he does not request an administrative \r\n  hearing or if his suspension is upheld at the administrative hearing, he must \r\n  enroll in an Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a) (Supp. 2003).\r\nIn reviewing the record, we believe there was substantial \r\n  evidence to support the administrative officerâ€™s ruling.Â  The officer read the \r\n  Implied Consent Rights form to Respondent and gave a copy of the rights to Respondent \r\n  prior to attempting to administer the DataMaster test. Therefore, Respondent \r\n  was advised â€“ in writing â€“ of his rights as they are enumerated in section 56-5-2950.Â  \r\n  It is not required that the administrative officer enumerate how each portion \r\n  of the statute has been satisfied, only that substantial evidence exist to support \r\n  his decision.Â  Therefore, the trial court erred in reversing the administrative \r\n  officerâ€™s decision.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HOWARD, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-412","title":"State v.

Gosnell appeals \r\n  his conviction for first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  Gosnellâ€™s \r\n  appellate counsel has petitioned to be relieved as counsel, stating she has \r\n  reviewed the record and has concluded Gosnellâ€™s appeal is without legal merit \r\n  sufficient to warrant a new trial.Â  The issue briefed by counsel concerns whether \r\n  the trial court erred in not granting Gosnellâ€™s motion for a directed verdict \r\n  of acquittal.Â  Gosnell did not file a brief with this court on his own behalf.\r\nAfter a review of the record as required \r\n  by Anders v.

W. DesChamps, Jr., of Myrtle Beach, for Appellant.\r\n  Reese R. Boyd III, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  PER CURIAM:Â  Little River \r\n    Lodging, LLC, appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting judgment in favor of \r\n    CMI Contracting, Inc., on a mechanicâ€™s lien in the amount of $73,620.75.Â  \r\n    The order also awarded CMI $18,055.95 in prejudgment interest and $8,533.70 \r\n    in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  As an alternative but superceded ground for recovery, \r\n    the trial court found Little River liable to CMI for the amount of the alleged \r\n    mechanicâ€™s lien on the basis of CMIâ€™s unjust enrichment claim.Â  We affirm. \r\n    [1] \r\n  FACTS\r\n  Little River is the \r\n    owner of a parcel of real estate situated in Horry County, South Carolina \r\n    upon which it sought to construct a commercial hotel development.Â  Through \r\n    its owner and operator, Bhupendra Patel, Little River contacted co-defendant \r\n    Construction Design Associates, Inc., (â€œCDAâ€), a general contractor, in February \r\n    2000 and asked CDA to begin working on the project.Â  CDA and Little River \r\n    understood the first phase of this project to include clearing the parcel \r\n    and filling some wetlands on the property.Â  Due to a longstanding professional \r\n    relationship between CDA and Little River, CDA did not initially require a \r\n    written agreement with Little River.Â  \r\n  Subsequent to \r\n    these discussions concerning the property, CDA entered a subcontract agreement \r\n    with CMI for the clearing and wetland work to be performed on the property.Â  \r\n    The subcontract agreement included a cost estimate from CMI of approximately \r\n    $118,000.Â  CMI began performing the agreed upon work in early March and completed \r\n    the work on April 11, 2000.Â  CDA and Patel visited the work site during the \r\n    months CMI performed the work specified in the subcontract agreement.Â  \r\n  Following the \r\n    workâ€™s completion, CMI submitted invoices to CDA for payment totaling $123,621.Â  \r\n    CDA then submitted $50,000 in payment to CMI after receiving a check for the \r\n    same amount and purpose from Patel of Little River.Â  This was the only payment \r\n    CMI received for the work.Â  Although an internal CDA document recognized a \r\n    $61,259 balance due CMI on the subcontracting work, Patel later claimed he \r\n    understood the $50,000 payment to be the complete amount due CMI for the project.Â  \r\n  \r\n  Little River and CDA \r\n    did not memorialize their general contracting agreement for developing the \r\n    property until October 2000.Â  The contract states work shall not commence \r\n    until all of the following are accomplished: 1) financing is in place and \r\n    designated for the project; 2) a building permit is obtained; and 3) written \r\n    notice to proceed is received by CDA.Â  Because construction financing could \r\n    not be obtained, CDA never commenced contract performance.Â  No hotel or other \r\n    structure exists on the property today.\r\n  In the meantime, \r\n    CMI served a summons, complaint, and notice and certificate of a mechanicâ€™s \r\n    lien on the property on Little River on July 18, 2000 and to CDA on August \r\n    11, 2000.Â  In addition to the mechanicâ€™s lien, CMI asserted a claim against \r\n    Little River for unjust enrichment.Â  The trial court awarded CMI a judgment \r\n    of $100,210.40, the lien plus interest and attorneyâ€™s fees, against Little \r\n    River.Â  The court order also stated CMI was entitled to $73,620.75 on its \r\n    claim for unjust enrichment, but explained this award was â€œsuperceded by CMIâ€™s \r\n    judgment on its mechanicâ€™s lien.â€Â  This appeal followed.\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  A proceeding to enforce a mechanicâ€™s lien is \r\n    an action at law.Â  Seckinger v. Vessel Excalibur, 326 S.C. 382, 386, \r\n    483 S.E.2d 775, 777 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In an action at law, on appeal of a \r\n    case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed \r\n    upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports \r\n    the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. \r\n    81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\n  LAW / ANALYSIS\r\n  I. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\n  Little River argues the mechanicâ€™s lien \r\n    foreclosure should be reversed because the trial court lacked subject matter \r\n    jurisdiction over the matter due to untimely service.Â  We disagree.\r\n  South Carolina Code section 29-5-90 provides, \r\n    in pertinent part: \r\n  \r\n  [A] lien shall be dissolved unless the person desiring \r\n    to avail himself thereof, within ninety days after he ceases to labor on or \r\n    furnish labor or material for such building or structure, serves upon the \r\n    owner . . . a statement of a just true account of the amount due him . . . \r\n    together with a description of the property intended to be covered by the \r\n    lien . . . with the name of the owner of the property, if known.\r\n  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-90 (Supp. 2003). [b1] &nbsp;Â  It is undisputed that CMI served this required \r\n    notice and certificate of a mechanicâ€™s lien on Little River after the statutorily \r\n    mandated ninety-day period.Â  However, when questioned at trial regarding the \r\n    sufficiency of the lienâ€™s service, the following exchange occurred between \r\n    the trial court and counsel for Little River:\r\n  \r\n  THE COURT:Â  Is there an issue about the technical aspects \r\n    of the mechanicâ€™s lien such as the notice, the certificate was given, the \r\n    timing of the foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien? All the technical aspects, \r\n    is that an issue?\r\n  LITTLE RIVER:Â  I think the mechanicâ€™s lien was served and \r\n    everything.\r\n  THE COURT:Â  I donâ€™t have the roll up here.\r\n  LITTLE RIVER:Â  Iâ€™ve got some other points to argue, but \r\n    itâ€™s not regarding service or whether the mechanicâ€™s lien was properly prepared.\r\n  \r\n  The sufficiency of the lienâ€™s service was never again discussed \r\n    or raised before the trial court.\r\n  While Little River certainly could have \r\n    argued the timeliness of the mechanicâ€™s lienâ€™s service as valid grounds to \r\n    dismiss the initial foreclosure action, it failed to do so.Â  Generally, an \r\n    issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised \r\n    to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.Â  \r\n    Wilder v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  However, \r\n    Little River argues the issue of timeliness of service is one of subject matter \r\n    jurisdiction and, as such, may be raised at any time, including for the first \r\n    time on appeal.Â  See Johnson v. State, 319 S.C. 62, 64, 459 \r\n    S.E.2d 840, 841 (1995) (stating issues related to subject matter jurisdiction \r\n    can be raised at any time).\r\n  Subject matter jurisdiction has been defined \r\n    as â€œthe power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the \r\n    proceedings in question belong.â€Â  McLendon v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Highways and \r\n    Pub. Transp., 313 S.C. 525, 525-26, 443 S.E.2d 539, 540 (1994).Â  In McLendon, \r\n    the supreme court determined that a statute of limitations defense does not \r\n    raise a question of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Id. at 525-26, 443 \r\n    S.E.2d at 540. The supreme court extended this holding to the time limits \r\n    set by statutes of creation. [2]  Simpson v. Sanders, 314 \r\n    S.C. 413, 415 n.1, 445 S.E.2d 93, 94 n.1 (1994).Â  As such, issues of timeliness \r\n    of service, even when they arise from the mandatory terms of statutes of creation, \r\n    do not give rise to concerns of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\n  Thus, as Little River failed to raise to the trial court \r\n    the issue of whether the mechanicâ€™s lien in this case was timely served, this \r\n    issue is not properly preserved for our review.\r\n  II. Absence of a Structure on the Building Site\r\n  Little River contends the trial court \r\n    erred in enforcing the mechanicâ€™s lien because the absence of a building or \r\n    structure on the tract of land in question precludes attachment of the lien \r\n    to the land.Â  We disagree.\r\n  The South Carolina mechanicâ€™s lien statute provides: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  A person to whom a debt is due for labor performed . . \r\n    .Â  in the erection, alteration, or repair of a building or structure upon \r\n    real estate . . . by virtue of an agreement with, or by consent of, the owner \r\n    of the building or structure, or a person having authority from, or rightfully \r\n    acting for, the owner in procuring or furnishing the labor or materials shall \r\n    have a lien upon the building or structure and upon the interest of the owner \r\n    of the building or structure in the lot of land upon which it is situated \r\n    to secure the payment of the debt due to him.Â  \r\n  . . .\r\n  [L]abor performed . . . includes . . . the work making \r\n    the real estate suitable as a site for the building or structure.Â  The work \r\n    is considered to include, but not be limited to, the grading, bulldozing, \r\n    leveling, excavating, and filling of land . . .\r\n  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  Little River relies on Clo-Car Trucking Co., \r\n    Inc. v. Clifflure Estates of South Carolina, 282 S.C. 573, 320 S.E.2d \r\n    51 (Ct. App. 1984), for the proposition that if no structure is erected on \r\n    a tract of land, a mechanicâ€™s lien, by the plain language of the statute, \r\n    cannot attach to the land.Â  In Clo-Car Trucking, the contractor, pursuant \r\n    to its contract with the previous owner, cleared and graded land for the construction \r\n    of streets and roads.Â  Neither the contractor nor anyone else did anything \r\n    more to the land.Â  This court held that, under section 29-5-10, â€œa mechanicâ€™s \r\n    lien cannot attach to land or to an ownerâ€™s interest in land where the work \r\n    done is unconnected with and forms no integral part of the erection, alteration, \r\n    or repair of either a building or a structure of some description.â€Â  Clo-Car \r\n    Trucking Co., Inc., 282 S.C. at 578, 320 S.E.2d at 54.\r\n  We find A.V.A. Construction Corporation v. Santee Wando \r\n    Construction, 303 S.C. 333, 400 S.E.2d 498 (Ct. App. 1990), more instructive \r\n    on this issue.Â  In A.V.A. Construction, the contractor had contracted \r\n    to construct the tennis court, provide drainage facilities, build roads with \r\n    curbs, and clear and grade land in anticipation of development of a subdivision.Â  \r\n    At the time the action was commenced, no houses had been constructed on any \r\n    of the lots.Â  Noting the General Assemblyâ€™s recent liberalization of the mechanicâ€™s \r\n    lien statute, this court found the mechanicâ€™s lien attached to the land because \r\n    the work was â€œprovided in order to make [the land] usable for building structures,â€ \r\n    notwithstanding the fact that the buildings were â€œyet to come.â€ [3] Â  Id. Â at 335, 400 S.E.2d at 500.Â  In \r\n    reaching this decision, this court expressly distinguished Clo-Car Trucking \r\n    on the factual basis that, in the earlier case, no allegation was made that \r\n    the clearing and grading were done in connection with the construction or \r\n    erection of any building or structure.Â  Id.\r\n  We find the facts before this court more analogous \r\n    to those in A.V.A. Construction.Â  While no structure currently exists \r\n    on Little Riverâ€™s property, the work performed by CMI was clearly performed \r\n    in anticipation of the construction of a hotel and was provided to Little \r\n    River in order to make the plot suitable for such.Â  We find the statute sufficiently \r\n    broad to encompass labor essential to the ownerâ€™s development of his property, \r\n    regardless of the subsequent progress of that development.Â  \r\n  III. Owner Consent\r\n  Little River argues the trial court erred \r\n    in enforcing the mechanicâ€™s lien because there was no agreement with or consent \r\n    from the owner of the land, Little River, for CMI to perform the labor on \r\n    the land.Â  We disagree.\r\n  Little River bases its argument on the language \r\n    of the mechanicâ€™s lien statute which provides:\r\n  \r\n  A person to whom a debt is due for labor performed . . \r\n    . in the erection, alteration, or repair of a building or structure upon real \r\n    estate . . . by virtue of an agreement with, or by consent of, the owner \r\n    of the building or structure, or a person having authority from, or rightfully \r\n    acting for, the owner in procuring or furnishing the labor or materials \r\n    shall have a lien upon the building or structure and upon the interest of \r\n    the owner of the building or structure in the lot of land upon which it is \r\n    situated to secure the payment of the debt due to him.Â  \r\n  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (Supp. 2003) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n    Little River contends, because no contract existed directly between it and \r\n    CMI, no consent was given to CMI to perform the labor on the land.Â  \r\n  The consent required by section 29-5-10 is â€œsomething \r\n    more than a mere acquiescence in a state of things already in existence.Â  \r\n    It implies an agreement to that which, but for the consent, could not exist, \r\n    and which the party has a right to forbid.â€Â  F &amp; D Elec. Contractors, \r\n    Inc. v. Powder Coaters, Inc., 350 S.C. 454, 459-60, 567 S.E.2d 842, 844 \r\n    (2002).Â  This consent does not require an express contract, but must indicate \r\n    â€œan agreement that the owner of . . . the land shall be, or may be, liable \r\n    for the materials or labor.â€Â  F &amp; D Elec. Contractors, 350 S.C. \r\n    at 460, 567 S.E.2d at 845 (quoting St. Catherineâ€™s Church Corp. of Riverside \r\n    v. Technical Planning Assocs., 9 Conn.App. 682, 520 A.2d 1298 (Conn. Ct. \r\n    App. 1987)).\r\n   F &amp; D Elec. Contractors involved the \r\n    issue of owner consent regarding a mechanicâ€™s lien in a landlord-tenant context.Â  \r\n    In such a context, the landlord/owner or his agent must directly give the \r\n    tenant or materialman express or implied consent acknowledging his liability \r\n    for the work.Â  The reasoning behind this requirement is manifest in the landlord-tenant \r\n    relationship.Â  A landlord/owner should not be liable for repairs or improvements \r\n    undertaken at the sheer caprice of a tenant, even if the landlord is aware \r\n    of the improvements or grants the tenant general permission to undertake them.Â  \r\n    We find the situation before us now, however, quite different from that arising \r\n    within the landlord-tenant context.\r\n  The labor performed by CMI was commenced and \r\n    completed at the sole behest of Little River, through its general contractor \r\n    CDA.Â  But for the consent and impetus of Little River, the labor on the plot \r\n    of land would not exist.Â  The labor was performed for the sole benefit of \r\n    Little River.Â  Its owner and operator, Patel, visited the sight and expressed \r\n    his satisfaction with the work.Â  These visits constitute more than mere acquiescence \r\n    of a particular state of the land.Â  Rather they are evidence that the work \r\n    commenced under the direction of Little River.Â  The evidence in the record \r\n    demonstrates the understanding between Little River and CDA, who shared a \r\n    longstanding professional relationship, that the work being performed on the \r\n    site by CMI was within the agreed upon scope of the essential first stage \r\n    of the propertyâ€™s development.Â  For these reasons, we conclude the work performed \r\n    by CMI on the hotel sight was commenced by consent of Little River.Â  Thus, \r\n    the enforcement of the lien was proper.\r\n  IV. Monies due CDA from Little River \r\n  Little River argues that because no monies were due CDA at the \r\n    time CMI served its notice and certificate of mechanicâ€™s lien, Little River \r\n    owes CMI nothing on the lien.Â  As this issue was not conclusively raised at \r\n    trial or ruled upon by the trial court in its final order, it is not preserved \r\n    for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, \r\n    497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised \r\n    for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon \r\n    by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\n  V.Â  Award of in personam judgment \r\n  Little River argues \r\n    the trial court erred in awarding CMI a monetary in personam judgment against \r\n    Little River without ordering the sale of the property to pay the mechanicâ€™s \r\n    lien indebtedness.Â  It asserts this issue is one of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\n    We disagree with this assertion.Â  As stated above, subject matter jurisdiction \r\n    concerns â€œthe power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which \r\n    the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  McLendon v. South Carolina Department \r\n    of Highways and Public Transportation, 313 S.C. 525, 525-26, 443 S.E.2d \r\n    539, 540 (1994).\r\n  \r\n  There is a wide difference between a want of jurisdiction \r\n    in which case the court has no power to adjudicate at all, and a mistake in \r\n    the exercise of undoubted jurisdiction in which case the action of the trial \r\n    court is not void although it may be subject to direct attack on appeal.Â  \r\n    A judgment will not be vacated for a mere irregularity which does not affect \r\n    the justice of the case, and of which the party could have availed himself, \r\n    but did not do so until judgment was rendered against him.\r\n  \r\n  Thomas &amp; Howard Co. v. \r\n    T.W. Graham and Co., 318 S.C. 286, 291, 457 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1995) (citations \r\n    omitted).\r\n  â€œWhen a court acts with proper subject matter jurisdiction \r\n    but takes some action outside of its authority, the party against whom the \r\n    act is done must object and directly appeal.â€Â  Coon v. Coon, 356 S.C. \r\n    342, 348, 588 S.E.2d 624, 627 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\n  Here, the trial court certainly had the power to hear and \r\n    determine mechanicâ€™s lien cases.Â  Its failure to order the sale of the property \r\n    involved is, at the most, a mistake in the exercise of its undoubted jurisdiction.Â  \r\n    As Little River failed to raise this omission to the trial court in a post-trial \r\n    motion, the issue is not properly before this court.Â  See Padgett \r\n    v. Mercado, 341 S.C. 229, 233, 533 S.E.2d 339, 341 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating \r\n    a post-trial motion must be made where there are errors or inconsistencies \r\n    in the trial courtâ€™s order).\r\n    VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Amount of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n     \r\n  Little River argues the trial court erred in its award \r\n    of attorneyâ€™s fees to CMI as the court failed to make specific findings of \r\n    fact on the record for each of the six factors necessary for consideration \r\n    in determining such an award.Â  Little River, however, failed to raise to the \r\n    trial court its concern over a lack of consideration of these factors in the \r\n    form of a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP.Â  \r\n    Accordingly, this issue is not properly before this court.Â  See Wilder \r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic \r\n    that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have \r\n    been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate \r\n    review.â€); Baker v. Wolfe, 333 S.C. 605, 614, 510 S.E.2d 726, 731 (Ct. \r\n    App. 1998) (noting where record did not indicate appellant objected to the \r\n    reasonableness of the hours or fees, either at the hearing or by way of a \r\n    motion to reconsider, the issue was not properly before the court).Â  Furthermore, \r\n    because the mechanicâ€™s lien was proper, we find the trial court properly granted \r\n    CMI attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n  VII.Â  Unjust Enrichment\r\n  Because we conclude the mechanicâ€™s lien \r\n    was properly enforced against Little River, we need not address Little Riverâ€™s \r\n    exceptions to the trial courtâ€™s ruling on CMIâ€™s unjust enrichment claim.Â  \r\n    See Hodge v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n, 267 S.C. 270, \r\n    275, 227 S.E.2d 310, 312 (1976) (stating that because the appellant had failed \r\n    to establish error in the enforcement of the mechanicâ€™s lien, the personal \r\n    judgment premised upon the contingency of the invalidity of the lien was academic).Â  \r\n  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  For the foregoing reasons, the order of the trial court \r\n    is\r\n   AFFIRMED.\r\n  ANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Although similar in operation, a statute that creates a new liability \r\n    and affixes the time within which an action may be commenced is not a statute \r\n    of limitation but a statute of creation.Â  Simpson v.

Newby and C. Scott Masel, of Myrtle Beach, for Appellants.\r\nGene McCain Connell, Jr. and Norwood David DuRant, both of \r\n  Surfside Beach, and Richard S. Joye, of Murrells Inlet, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Dan McGeown and Scott McLaren \r\n  appeal the trial courtâ€™s order holding them individually liable to employees \r\n  of a closed business for unpaid wages under the South Carolina Payment of Wages \r\n  Act and theory of promissory estoppel.Â Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part. [1]  Â Â  Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nThis case arises after the sudden closing of Holiday Network \r\n  International, Inc.Â  McGeown was the president and owner of Holiday Network.Â  \r\n  McGeown did not live in state, but would visit the Myrtle Beach office every \r\n  couple of months for approximately a weekâ€™s duration.Â  McGeown signed the payroll \r\n  checks and generally ran the business without regard to corporate formalities.Â  \r\n  McLaren was the vice president, marketing director, and effectively acted as \r\n  the â€œbossâ€ at the Myrtle Beach location when McGeown was absent.Â  After the \r\n  close of Holiday Network, McLaren was transferred to a business owned by McGeown \r\n  in Florida.Â  \r\nWhen Holiday Network suddenly closed, the employees \r\n  were left without payment for wages due.Â  These employees were to have been \r\n  paid the last day the business operated, a Friday.Â  However, McLaren explained \r\n  to them payment was late due to a delayed Federal Express delivery.Â  McLaren \r\n  told employees if any of them were in desperate need of money prior to Monday, \r\n  they could come to his house and he would sell his golf clubs to give them money \r\n  from the sale.Â  At least one employee testified he went to McLarenâ€™s house to \r\n  accept his offer, but McLaren did not answer the door.Â  \r\nOn Sunday, McGeown told the bookkeeper that he \r\n  would personally see that everyone was paid.Â  This same employee testified that \r\n  in her capacity as bookkeeper, she relayed this information to all of the employees \r\n  who called her home.Â  Many other employees also testified as to direct communication \r\n  between themselves and McGeown and his promise they would be paid.Â  Others testified \r\n  they tried to contact McGeown in Florida, but could never speak to him personally.Â  \r\n  Holiday Network was closed that Monday.Â  \r\nLeft without wages they had earned, the employees \r\n  filed suit against the Holiday Network, McGeown, and McLaren.Â  The circuit court \r\n  granted the employees partial summary judgment, declaring that they were employees \r\n  of Holiday Network as a matter of law.Â  The case subsequently was referred to \r\n  the master-in-equity for trial.Â  The trial court held McGeown and McLaren liable \r\n  for the unpaid wages under a theory of promissory estoppel and pursuant to the \r\n  South Carolina Payment of Wages Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-10 et seq.Â  \r\n  In addition, the court trebled the damages and awarded attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant \r\n  to the statute.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-80(C) (Supp. 2003).\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen legal and equitable actions are maintained \r\n  in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal or equitable for purposes \r\n  of the applicable standard of review on appeal. Â Corley v. Ott, 326 S.C. \r\n  89, 485 S.E.2d 97 (1997). Â An action for promissory estoppel is equitable in \r\n  nature.Â  West v. Newberry Elec. Co-op., 357 S.C. 537, 542, 593 S.E.2d \r\n  500, 502 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Thus, in reviewing the action for promissory estoppel, \r\n  we may determine facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Jocoy v. Jocoy, 349 S.C. 441, 444, 562 S.E.2d 674, \r\n  675&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, we are not required to disregard the findings \r\n  of the trial court, which saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate their credibiliy.Â  Id. Â In the action pursuant to the South \r\n  Carolina Payment of Wages Act, which is an action at law, this courtâ€™s scope \r\n  of review extends only to the correction of errors of law.Â  See Evans \r\n  v. Taylor Made Sandwich Co. 337 S.C. 95, 101, 522 S.E.2d 350, 353 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999) (stating factual disputes under the Payment of Wages Act are to be determined \r\n  by a jury); Sims v. Hall, 357 S.C. 288, 294, 592 S.E.2d 315, 318&nbsp;(Ct. \r\n  App. 2003) (stating the standard of review for an action at law).Â  The factual \r\n  findings of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless a review \r\n  of the record reveals there is no evidence which reasonably supports the courtâ€™s \r\n  findings.Â  Sims, at 294-95, 592 S.E.2d at 318.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promissory Estoppel  \r\nMcGeown and McLaren argue the trial court erred \r\n  in finding liability against both of them based on a theory of promissory estoppel.Â  \r\n\r\nA successful claim under promissory estoppel requires \r\n  four elements: (1) the presence of a promise unambiguous in its terms, (2) reasonable \r\n  reliance upon the promise by the party to whom the promise is made, (3) the \r\n  reliance is expected and foreseeable by the party who makes the promise, and \r\n  (4) the party to whom the promise is made must sustain injury in reliance on \r\n  the promise.Â  Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C. 477, 483-484, 570 S.E.2d 535, \r\n  538 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œThe applicability of the doctrine [of promissory estoppel] \r\n  depends on whether the refusal to apply it â€˜would be virtually to sanction the \r\n  perpetration of a fraud or would result in other injustice.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  at \r\n  484, 570 S.E.2d at 538 (citation omitted).\r\nMcLaren was not the owner of Holiday Network; instead \r\n  he only managed the Myrtle Beach operation during McGeownâ€™s absence.Â  Although \r\n  he made representations to some of the other employees that they would be paid, \r\n  McLaren neither had control over the actual signing and sending of these paychecks \r\n  nor did he personally assume any obligation.Â  The employees place much emphasis \r\n  on McLarenâ€™s offer to sell his golf clubs and pay any employees that could not \r\n  wait for their paycheck.Â  However, it would be inequitable to use this offer \r\n  of charity to impose liability on McLaren personally.\r\nAs to the claims against McGeown, the employees \r\n  presented testimony that McGeown promised them that they would be paid.Â  According \r\n  to the bookkeeper, he assured her that he would personally see to everyone being \r\n  paid.Â  She then relayed this assurance to other employees.Â  Although the employees \r\n  presented this testimony as evidence of McGeownâ€™s promise to personally pay \r\n  them, they did not present any evidence of any injury caused by reliance on \r\n  this promise.Â  \r\nAccording to the testimony, the earliest McGeown \r\n  made the promise to pay was the last day Holiday Network operated, a Friday.Â  \r\n  There is no evidence any employee continued working in reliance on either McGeown \r\n  or McLarenâ€™s promises.Â  In fact, the next business day, a Monday, Holiday Network \r\n  was closed.Â  As the employees did not establish every element of promissory \r\n  estoppel, their cause of action based on this theory must fail.Â  \r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South Carolina Payment of Wages Act  \r\n\r\na.Â  Liability under the \r\n  South Carolina Payment of Wages Act\r\n\r\nMcGeown and McLaren argue \r\n  they were not employers who knowingly permitted the corporation to violate the \r\n  South Carolina Payment of Wages Act.Â  We affirm as to McGeown and reverse as \r\n  to McLaren.\r\nThe South Carolina Payment of Wages Act provides \r\n  â€œevery employer in the State shall pay wages due. . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-40(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  The statute further defines an â€œemployerâ€ as a â€œcorporation . \r\n  . . and any agent or officer of the above classes employing any person in this \r\n  State.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-10(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  As this court explained, \r\n  â€œthe legislature intended to impose individual liability on agents or officers \r\n  of a corporation who knowingly permit their corporation to violate the \r\n  Act.Â  To hold otherwise would require us to ignore the words â€˜and any agent \r\n  or officer of the above classes.â€™â€ Dumas v. Infosafe Corp., 320 S.C. \r\n  188, 195, 463 S.E.2d 641, 645 (Ct. App. 1995) (emphasis added).Â  In Dumas, \r\n  the court imposed individual liability under the Payment of Wages Act upon a \r\n  business president, who was also the sole shareholder.Â  \r\nUnder a plain reading of the actâ€™s definition of \r\n  â€œemployer,â€ both McGeown and McLaren may be considered employers.Â  They were \r\n  both â€œofficers,â€ president and vice president respectively, of a â€œcorporation,â€ \r\n  Holiday Network.Â  Dumas requires this court to determine whether McGeown \r\n  and McLaren â€œknowingly permittedâ€ the business to violate the Payment of Wages \r\n  Act.Â  McGeown was the owner, ran the business, directed the employees, signed \r\n  the payroll checks, and continually promised various employees that he would \r\n  pay them.Â  We find the evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s determination that \r\n  McGeown did knowingly permit the business to violate the act.\r\nHowever, the trial court made no findings of fact \r\n  concerning McLarenâ€™s ability or power within the business as it related to the \r\n  payment of payroll.Â  Despite McLarenâ€™s title as vice president, it was not in \r\n  his power to pay the employees.Â  Instead, payment was in McGeownâ€™s power.Â  McLaren \r\n  could not knowingly permit the business to withhold wages, because there \r\n  is no indication that he had the authority or power to grant or withhold wages.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we find the trial court erred in holding McLaren liable under the \r\n  South Carolina Payment of Wages Act.\r\n\r\nb.Â  The law of the case\r\n\r\nMcGeown \r\n  [2]  argues a prior court order is the law of the case and holds he is not \r\n  an employer of any of the plaintiffs.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nA prior circuit court order \r\n  stated it â€œgrants partial summary judgment to the Plaintiffs and finds, as a \r\n  matter of law, that they were employees of Defendant, Holiday Network Int., \r\n  Inc.â€Â  The order justifies its decision based on the fact that the employees \r\n  presented, among other things, payroll check stubs to them from the business.Â  \r\n  It is important to note that this order was issued in the shadow of denials \r\n  to two sets of requests for admission from the employees asking Holiday Network \r\n  to admit it employed them and that they received paychecks from it.Â  \r\nThe definition of â€œemployerâ€ under the South Carolina \r\n  Payment of Wages Act clearly envisions the existence of multiple employers.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. 41-10-10(1); Dumas v. Infosafe Corp., 320 S.C. \r\n  188, 463 S.E.2d 641 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding both the company and its president \r\n  liable under the Act).Â  The circuit court order does not prohibit the existence \r\n  of other â€œemployers,â€ but merely declares that the employees were employees \r\n  of Holiday Network.Â  This definition neither actually nor by implication prohibits \r\n  the naming of other parties as being â€œemployers,â€ if such a determination is \r\n  legally and factually supported.Â  Therefore, we find this order does not limit \r\n  the application of the status as â€œemployerâ€ to Holiday Network exclusively.\r\n\r\nc.Â  Treble damages\r\n\r\nMcGeown argues the damages should not be trebled \r\n  because he did not act intentionally or in bad faith.Â  \r\nSection 41-10-80(C) of the South Carolina Wage \r\n  Payment Act provides in part:\r\nIn case of any failure to pay wages due to an employee as \r\n  required by Section 41-10-40 or 41-10-50 the employee may recover in a civil \r\n  action an amount equal to three times the full amount of the unpaid wages, plus \r\n  costs and reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees as the court may allow.\r\nS.C.Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-80(C) (Supp. 2003).\r\nThe decision of whether to award treble damages \r\n  is within the discretion of the trial court.Â  Rice v. Multimedia, Inc., \r\n  318 S.C. 95, 98, 456 S.E.2d 381, 383 (1995).Â  In holding the award of treble \r\n  damages was discretionary, the court explained, â€œThis interpretation accords \r\n  with the purpose of the Wage Payment Act, to wit:Â  to protect employees from \r\n  the unjustified and wilful retention of wages by the employer.Â  The imposition \r\n  of treble damages in those cases where there is a bona fide dispute would be \r\n  unjust and harsh.â€Â  Id.Â Â  The court cautioned, â€œIf there is a dispute \r\n  over unpaid wages the employer acts at his peril and the court in its discretion \r\n  may award treble damages when the withholding was unreasonable and there was \r\n  no good faith wage dispute.â€Â  Id. Â at 99, 456 S.E.2d at 383.Â  In Rice, \r\n  pursuant to its handbook policy, the company refused to pay the employee commissions \r\n  on seven contracts following his termination.Â  Id. Â at 97, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  at 382.Â  The supreme court held the trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in refusing to award treble damages because there was no evidence the employer \r\n  acted intentionally and in bad faith.Â  Id.Â  at 99-100, 456 S.E.2d at \r\n  384.\r\nIn the present case, it is undisputed that the \r\n  employees are entitled to the wages they seek.Â  McGeown was the president and \r\n  owner of Holiday Network, which suddenly closed its doors leaving its employees \r\n  without their wages.Â  We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in \r\n  trebling the employeesâ€™ damages.Â  \r\n\r\nd.Â  Attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n\r\nMcGeown argues the trial court awarded attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees without making the necessary findings pursuant to Baron Data Systems, \r\n  Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 377 S.E.2d 296 (1989) \r\n  [3] .Â  McGeown, however, failed to raise to the trial court his concern \r\n  over a lack of consideration of these factors in the form of a motion to alter \r\n  or amend the judgment.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  \r\n  See Wilder v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) \r\n  (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, \r\n  but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved \r\n  for appellate review.â€); Padgett v. Mercado, 341 S.C. 229, 233, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  339, 341 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating any argument alleging an inaccuracy or inconsistency \r\n  in an order must be raised by a post-trial motion).Â  \r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Affidavits and absent employees  \r\nMcGeown argues the master-in-equity erred by admitting affidavits \r\n  and\r\nevidence of absent employees.Â  We find these issues \r\n  are not properly before this court.\r\nThe trial court admitted the affidavits of employees \r\n  Regina Brandon and Robert Warham, who were not present at trial, in which the \r\n  two employees stated the amount of wages owed them.Â  At trial, McGeownâ€™s counsel \r\n  objected to the admission of the affidavits arguing:Â  â€œI will have to object \r\n  just because these individuals are not here and plaintiffs as a general rule \r\n  canâ€™t present their case by way of their own affidavit.â€Â  On appeal, however, \r\n  McGeown argues the affidavits were inadmissible because they were hearsay.Â  \r\n  A party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and a different ground \r\n  on appeal.Â  Murray v. Bank of America, 354 S.C. 337, 347, 580 S.E.2d \r\n  194, 199 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Accordingly, this argument is not preserved.\r\nMcGeown also argues the trial court erred in awarding \r\n  judgments in favor of a number of employees who did not appear to testify at \r\n  trial.Â  Although the trial court ruled that these employees could present evidence \r\n  at a subsequent hearing, no such hearing ever occurred.Â  McGeown failed to raise \r\n  to the trial court his objection to the judgments in favor of these employees \r\n  either during the trial or in a post-trial motion.Â  Thus, this argument is not \r\n  preserved.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d \r\n  731, 733 (1998)(â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first \r\n  time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge \r\n  to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. v. Dutton, \r\n  311 S.C. 56, 60, 427 S.E.2d 673, 675 (1993) (stating that although the appellant \r\n  learned for the first time upon receiving the order on a post-trial motion that \r\n  the respondent would be granted certain additional relief, the appellant must \r\n  move under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment to preserve the \r\n  issue).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the trial courtâ€™s judgment \r\n  in favor of the employees on their cause of action for promissory estoppel is \r\n  reversed as to both McGeown and McLaren.Â  The courtâ€™s imposition of individual \r\n  liability under the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act is reversed as to McLaren \r\n  and affirmed as to McGeown.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  As we found above McLaren is not liable under \r\n    the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act, we address the remaining issues as \r\n    they pertain to McGeown alone.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] These factors are:Â  (1) the nature, extent and \r\n    difficulty of the legal services rendered; (2) the time and labor necessarily \r\n    devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency \r\n    of compensation; (5) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar \r\n    legal services; and (6) the beneficial results obtained.Â  Baron, 297 \r\n    S.C. at 384-85, 377 S.E.2d at 297.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-424","title":"Jacobsen v.

Peeples, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-424\r\nHeard June 10, 2004 â€“ Filed June 30, 2004\r\n\r\nVACATED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nCeleste T. Jones and Benjamin E. Nicholson, V, both of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellants.\r\nJohn E. Parker and Grahame E. Holmes, both of Walterboro, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Respondents, Val Jacobsen and \r\n  his wife Loretta, brought suits against appellants, American Agviation, Inc. \r\n  and Transland, Inc., seeking redress for injuries Val suffered in the crash \r\n  of his crop duster plane.Â  When both companies failed to appear for trial, the \r\n  court held a bench trial in their absence and awarded the Jacobsens over $12 \r\n  million in damages.Â  Agviation and Transland then filed motions for a new trial \r\n  or, in the alternative, to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, amend \r\n  findings of fact, alter or amend the judgment, open judgment for additional \r\n  testimony, and/or for relief from judgment.Â  The court denied all their motions \r\n  and Agviation and Transland now appeal, asserting procedural errors and contending \r\n  the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction.Â  For the reasons set forth below, \r\n  we vacate the trial courtâ€™s order.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn August 1994, Val Jacobsen, a high school \r\n  teacher and part-time crop duster, telephoned American Agviation, an Arkansas \r\n  company, to request information on an aircraft the company was selling.Â  American \r\n  Agviation responded with a letter to Val describing the plane.Â  On August 19, \r\n  1994, after several telephone conversations with Agviationâ€™s president negotiating \r\n  the price and an overhaul to the plane, Jacobsen traveled to Arkansas and purchased \r\n  the used 1970 Grumman Ag-Cat airplane.Â  Val used the plane strictly for crop \r\n  dusting.Â  On the morning of July 14, 1996, Val was severely burned when the \r\n  aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff.Â  \r\nOn July 8, 1999, Val filed suit against \r\n  Agviation and Transland, Inc. in the Hampton County Court of Common Pleas for \r\n  injuries he received in the crash.Â  On July 9, 1999, Loretta filed a loss of \r\n  consortium action against the two companies.Â  The Jacobsens alleged the plane \r\n  caught fire shortly after Valâ€™s take-off, and when he attempted to dump his \r\n  load of chemicals in order to land safely, the defective design of the crop \r\n  dusting device prevented him from doing so causing him to crash into a tree.Â  \r\n  As to Agviation, the Jacobsens claimed the company negligently sold Val an airplane \r\n  with defective exhaust stacks.Â  As to Transland, the Jacobsens claimed it negligently \r\n  designed the planeâ€™s dumping system in such a way that â€œthe system could unintentionally \r\n  be in a position to prevent emergency dumping,â€ thereby causing Valâ€™s injuries.Â  \r\n  The Jacobsensâ€™ complaints contained a demand for a jury trial.Â  \r\nThe companies, upon receipt of the Jacobsensâ€™ \r\n  Summons and Complaint, each responded by writing a letter to the Jacobsensâ€™ \r\n  attorney, John Parker.Â  On July 9, 1999, Translandâ€™s president, Conrad Barlow, \r\n  replied with a letter sent by facsimile and certified mail, informing Parker \r\n  that Transland did not manufacture the dumping device on the airplane.Â  On August \r\n  4, 1999, Agviationâ€™s president, Frank Kelly, also responded through a letter \r\n  to Parker, raising factual defenses and asserting the South Carolina court did \r\n  not have jurisdiction over Agviation.Â  This letter contained the following carbon \r\n  copy information in its postscript:\r\n\r\nSTATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nOffice of Jim Miles, SECRETARY OF STATE\r\nCourt of Common Pleas/County of Hampton\r\nP. O. Box 11350\r\nColumbia, S.C. 29211\r\n\r\nTransland also sent a copy of its responsive letter \r\n  to the above address on August 9, 1999.Â  \r\nTransland maintained it received six separate notices \r\n  of roster meetings in the matter.Â  Agviation indicated it received eight such \r\n  notices.Â  After receiving one of the notices from the Hampton County Clerk of \r\n  Court, Translandâ€™s president, Barlow, sent a letter to the Jacobsensâ€™ attorney \r\n  on September 4, 2001, noting the roster included his name under American Agviation \r\n  and insisting he had no affiliation to Agviation.Â  After receiving a roster \r\n  meeting notice in January 2002, Transland sent another letter dated February \r\n  11, 2002, this one to The Hampton County Clerk of Court, expressing confusion \r\n  over the matter, enclosing correspondence with the Jacobsensâ€™ attorney, and \r\n  requesting it be removed from the lawsuit.Â  \r\nOn December 17, 2001, the Hampton County Clerk \r\n  of Court mailed a roster of cases for the January 28, 2002 term of court to \r\n  Agviation and Transland.Â  The notice was addressed to â€œAttorneys At Lawâ€ and \r\n  stated as follows:\r\n\r\nThere will be a term of Common Pleas Court on JANUARY 28, 2002 \r\n  beginning at 9:30 a.m.Â  The Honorable Rodney A. Peeples will be the presiding \r\n  judge.Â  The jury will report at 2:00 p.m.\r\n Enclosed you will find a copy of the roster and a Pre-Trial Brief.Â  \r\n  Please fill out a Brief for each case you have on this roster.Â  Bring three \r\n  (3) copies to the Roster Meeting January 28, 2002.Â  If you have any questions, \r\n  please contact the Administrative Judgeâ€™s office at (843) 549-7878.Â  Please \r\n  follow all telephone calls to the Judge or Clerkâ€™s office with a faxed or mailed \r\n  letter.\r\n\r\nThe notice also gave the name, address, and phone and fax numbers for the \r\n  Administrative Judge.Â  The Jacobsensâ€™ two suits against Agviation and Transland \r\n  were placed as cases 9 and 10 on the roster of 108 cases.Â  Their case listings \r\n  included the names of John Parker under the Jacobsens and Conrad Barlow under \r\n  American Agviation, and indicated â€œPRE-TRIAL DATE:Â  00/00/0000.â€Â  \r\nOn January 28, 2002 when the cases were called \r\n  to trial, neither Transland nor Agviation appeared before the court to defend \r\n  against the Jacobsensâ€™ claims.Â  At that time, the Jacobsens proceeded with a \r\n  bench trial and their attorney presented a full case on the merits, eliciting \r\n  testimony and introducing evidence to substantiate the Jacobsensâ€™ claims.Â  By \r\n  order filed February 14, 2002, the court determined its exercise of personal \r\n  jurisdiction over Agviation and Transland was proper, and found both companies \r\n  liable for Jacobsenâ€™s injuries and his wifeâ€™s loss of consortium, awarding them \r\n  over $12 million in damages.Â  Thereafter, Agviation and Transland retained legal \r\n  counsel and filed timely motions for a new trial or, in the alternative, to \r\n  dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, amend findings of fact, alter or \r\n  amend the judgment, open judgment for additional testimony, and/or for relief \r\n  from judgment.Â  In these motions, Agviation and Transland asserted various grounds \r\n  for the court to set aside the judgment or grant a new trial, including but \r\n  not limited to the following: (1) they were not given notice the case was transferred \r\n  to the non-jury roster and they did not consent to such transfer; (2) they were \r\n  not given adequate notice of the trial; (3) they were not given a hearing on \r\n  their motion to dismiss; (4) they were not given notice that, as a party, they \r\n  were required to attend the roster meeting; and (5) the court lacked personal \r\n  jurisdiction over them.Â  Following a hearing, the court denied each of their \r\n  motions.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n On appeal, Agviation and Transland contend \r\n  the trial court erred in sua sponte transferring their cases to \r\n  the non-jury docket.Â  We agree.\r\nRule 38, SCRCP governs the right to trial by jury \r\n  and provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(a) Right Preserved.Â  The right of trial by jury as declared \r\n  by the Constitution or as given by a statute of South Carolina shall be preserved \r\n  to the parties inviolate.Â  Issues of fact in an action for the recovery of \r\n  money only or of specific real or personal property must be tried by \r\n  a jury, unless a jury trial be waived.\r\n(d) Waiver.Â  The failure of a party to serve a \r\n  demand as required by this rule and to file it as required by Rule 5(d) \r\n  constitutes a waiver by him of trial by jury.Â  A demand for trial \r\n  by jury made as herein provided may not be withdrawn without the consent of \r\n  the parties, except where an opposing party is in default under Rule 55(a).\r\n\r\nRule 38 (a) and (d), SCRCP (emphasis added).Â  Further, Rule \r\n  39 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, provides in pertinent part \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\nWhen trial by jury has been demanded as provided in Rule \r\n  38, the action shall be designated upon the calendar and the clerkâ€™s filebook \r\n  as a jury action.Â  The trial of all issues so demanded shall be by \r\n  jury, unless (1) the parties or their attorneys of record, by written \r\n  stipulation filed with the court or by an oral stipulation made in open court \r\n  and entered in the record, consent to trial by the court sitting without a jury \r\n  or (2) the court upon motion or its own initiative finds that a right of trial \r\n  by jury of some or all of those issues does not exist.\r\n\r\nRule 39(a), SCRCP (emphasis added).\r\nIn their motions before the trial court, Appellants \r\n  requested the court set aside the judgment or grant them a new trial on the \r\n  ground that they were not given proper notice that the cases were transferred \r\n  from the jury roster to the non-jury roster, and they did not consent to such \r\n  a transfer.Â  In denying the motion on this basis, the trial court indicated \r\n  it considered Appellants to technically be in default for failing to properly \r\n  answer within the time prescribed under the rules [1] .Â  However, it noted that the Jacobsens never \r\n  moved pursuant to Rule 55(a) to have the defaults entered upon the calendar, \r\n  [2]  and therefore Appellants â€œdid not waive their right to a trial by jury \r\n  pursuant to Rule 38(d).â€Â  The court further recognized the constraints of Rule \r\n  39(a), SCRCP, requiring consent of all parties before issues in which a jury \r\n  trial is demanded can be heard non-jury, unless the right to trial by jury does \r\n  not exist for some or all of the issues.Â  Nonetheless, it denied the motion \r\n  finding â€œany problems arising in these actions are the direct result of [Agviationâ€™s \r\n  and Translandâ€™s] own neglectâ€ in failing to monitor the progress in these cases.Â  \r\n  We find this ruling to be in error.\r\nThis action is indisputably one for the recovery \r\n  of money for which a jury trial may properly be demanded.Â  Rule 38(a), SCRCP.Â  \r\n  It is equally clear that the Jacobsens demanded in their complaints that these \r\n  cases be tried by a jury.Â  Agviation and Transland were entitled to rely on \r\n  the Jacobsensâ€™ demand for trial by jury and need not make their own demand.Â  \r\n  See Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co, 298 S.C. 127, 129, 378 \r\n  S.E.2d 599, 600 (1989) (â€œUnder Rule 38, a defendant may rely on a plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  demand for a jury trial.â€)Â  Because a demand for jury trial was properly made, \r\n  such demand could not be withdrawn â€œwithout the consent of the parties,â€ unless \r\n  the opposing party is in default.Â  Rule 38(d), SCRCP.Â  Further, the parties \r\n  or their attorneys did not â€œby written stipulation filed with the court or by \r\n  an oral stipulation made in open court and entered in the record, consent to \r\n  trial by the court sitting without a juryâ€ pursuant to Rule 39(a), SCRCP.Â  \r\nThus, the rules of civil procedure are clear, that \r\n  where a jury trial is properly demanded, such demand may not thereafter be withdrawn \r\n  without the consent of all parties, unless the party from whom consent \r\n  is not obtained has been held in default pursuant to Rule 55(a), SCRCP.Â  As \r\n  noted by the trial court, the Jacobsens never moved pursuant to Rule 55(a) to \r\n  have any defaults entered upon the calendar. [3] Â  Rather, they proceeded to trial, \r\n  presenting evidence on both liability and damages.Â  We therefore hold the trial \r\n  court erred in transferring the cases to the non-jury docket and hearing them \r\n  in a bench trial.Â  Where the consent of all parties is not obtained, there is \r\n  no provision in the rules allowing the transfer of a case from the jury docket \r\n  based upon a partyâ€™s failure to appear for trial, unless default has been entered \r\n  against that party.Â  Here, the fact that Appellants were not present when the \r\n  case was called for trial is irrelevant, as there had been no entry of their \r\n  default.\r\nFor the foregoing reason, the judgments against \r\n  Agviation and Transland are vacated. \r\n  [4] \r\nVACATED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] The court relied in part on Renaissance Enters., Inc. v. Summit \r\n    Teleservices, Inc., 334 S.C. 649, 651, 515 S.E.2d 257, 258 (1999), holding \r\n    a non-lawyer cannot represent a corporation in either the circuit or appellate \r\n    courts of this state. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] See Rule 55(a), SCRCP (â€œWhen a party against whom a judgment \r\n    for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as \r\n    provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, \r\n    the clerk shall enter his default upon the calendar (file book).â€)\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Indeed, there is no indication that the Jacobsens, by affidavit or \r\n    otherwise, asserted the appellants failed to plead or otherwise defend such \r\n    that they would have been entitled to entry of default against the appellants \r\n    pursuant to Rule 55(a).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Because our decision on this issue renders Appellantsâ€™ other arguments \r\n    moot, we need not address them in this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-425","title":"State v.

Elliott \r\n  and Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A Richland County jury convicted \r\n  Melvin McNeil of assault and battery with intent to kill.Â  He appeals, asserting \r\n  the trial court erred by (1) improperly admitting evidence of a prior bad act \r\n  allegedly committed by McNeil, and (2) refusing to grant a mistrial following \r\n  the solicitorâ€™s inappropriate reference to the prior bad act evidence during \r\n  closing arguments.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn the evening of January 2, 2001, Levette \r\n  Goodwin, Tyrone Rivers, and Mary Wooden were walking together along Flamingo \r\n  Road in the Bluff Estates neighborhood of Columbia.Â  As they continued down \r\n  the road, a vehicle drove slowly past the group and stopped a short distance \r\n  in front of them.Â  McNeil emerged from the driverâ€™s side of the car holding \r\n  a handgun.Â  Seeing this, Goodwin began running away.Â  McNeil fired the handgun \r\n  a couple of times, hitting Goodwin in his leg with one bullet.Â  \r\nMcNeil was subsequently arrested and charged \r\n  with assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK).Â  At trial, the solicitor \r\n  introduced evidence that McNeil shot Goodwin in another incident that occurred \r\n  on November 12, 2000, some 50 days before the January 2, 2001 shooting.Â  Over \r\n  defense counselâ€™s objection, the trial court admitted the evidence as proof \r\n  of McNeilâ€™s intent when he shot Goodwin on January 2, 2001.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Admission of Prior Bad Act Evidence\r\nMcNeil first claims the trial court erred \r\n  by admitting testimony that he allegedly shot the victim several weeks prior \r\n  to the incident charged.Â  We disagree.\r\nGoodwin testified that he had known McNeil all \r\n  his life, but that hostilities developed between them sometime in late 2000 \r\n  after they had been â€œslap boxingâ€ at the home of Goodwinâ€™s cousin: \r\n\r\nI was messing around and grabbed \r\n  [McNeil] by his leg and fell on top of him, and we was just playing, kidding \r\n  around.Â  Ever since that day [McNeil] just took it serious and he had like a \r\n  vendetta against me. . . . Every time he saw me it was like Iâ€™m going to get \r\n  you, and he was like pulling out guns and wanting to fight, you know. \r\n\r\nGoodwin further testified that subsequent to the \r\n  wrestling incident, on November 12, 2000, McNeil shot him while he was walking \r\n  through the Bluff Estates neighborhood:\r\n\r\nI was going to my cousinâ€™s house \r\n  earlier that morning, and I was coming through the cut and Mr. McNeil was sitting \r\n  in the chair on the side of the house and he had a shotgun in his hand.\r\n. . . .\r\nI turned around and I jumped \r\n  the gate. Then he ran behind me with the shotgun and started shooting, right. \r\n  I was running. I was behind the lady that stays next to my cousin.Â  I hid behind \r\n  her car.Â  When I tried to jump the gate, thatâ€™s when he got to shooting some \r\n  more and thatâ€™s when the buck shots hit the gate and one hit me right here in \r\n  my arm. \r\n\r\nMcNeil argues the admission of this testimony regarding \r\n  the prior shooting was unfairly prejudicial to his defense, only serving to \r\n  foster in the jurorsâ€™ minds a presumption of guilt for the crime charged.\r\nWhile evidence of prior crimes or misconduct is \r\n  inadmissible to prove the specific crime charged, it may be admitted if it tends \r\n  to establish:Â  (1) motive; (2) intent; (3) the absence of mistake or accident; \r\n  (4) a common scheme or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so \r\n  related to each other that proof of one tends to establish the others; or (5) \r\n  the identity of the person charged with the present crime.Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE; \r\n  State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 416, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923).Â  If not the \r\n  subject of a conviction, a prior bad act must first be established by clear \r\n  and convincing evidence.Â  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 135, 536 S.E.2d \r\n  679, 683 (2000).Â  The decision on whether to admit evidence of other bad acts \r\n  is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and that decision will \r\n  not be disturbed by the appellate court if there is any evidence to support \r\n  the admission.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).\r\nIn the present case, the trial court admitted \r\n  the evidence concerning McNeilâ€™s prior assault on Goodwin as probative of McNeilâ€™s \r\n  intent when he committed the shooting for which he was charged.Â  However, evidence \r\n  of other crimes, even if logically relevant to prove intent, is inadmissible \r\n  if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice \r\n  to the defendant.Â  Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Brooks, 341 S.C. 57, 62-63, \r\n  533 S.E.2d 325, 328 (2000).Â  The determination of prejudice must be based on \r\n  the entire record and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  at 62, 533 S.E.2d at 328.Â  Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if it \r\n  has an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis.Â  State \r\n  v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 666, 552 S.E.2d 745, 760 (2001).\r\nBased on our review of the record before \r\n  us, we conclude the evidence of McNeilâ€™s prior shooting of Goodwin bears sufficient \r\n  logical relevance to the ABIK charge in this case.Â  Both incidents occurred \r\n  close in time and under similar circumstances involving the same victim.Â  Evidence \r\n  of the November 12, 2000 shooting was, therefore, significantly probative of \r\n  McNeilâ€™s intent when he shot Goodwin on January 2, 2001.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Mistrial\r\nMcNeil next argues the trial court erred \r\n  by denying his motion for mistrial following the solicitorâ€™s reference to the \r\n  November 12, 2000 shooting in his closing statement.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe portion of the solicitorâ€™s closing \r\n  argument at issue was transcribed as follows:\r\n\r\nSOLICITOR: One thing in \r\n  [defense counselâ€™s] opening statement that he seemed to harp on a lot was the \r\n  fact that it was just a leg wound.Â  [Goodwin] was just shot in the lower leg.Â  \r\n  I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, ask yourselves, how many times does that \r\n  young man have to be shot, and â€“\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL:Â  Your \r\n  Honor, I object to that argument.\r\nTRIAL JUDGE:Â  I think \r\n  so.\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL:Â  And \r\n  I have a matter of law to take up whenever the court wishes.\r\nTRIAL JUDGE:Â  All right, \r\n  sir.Â  Just move on please, sir.\r\nSOLICITOR:Â  Yes, sir.\r\nShot two times, is that not enough \r\n  to find malice? Is that not enough for there to be malice, ladies and gentlemen?\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: I continue \r\n  the objection, sir. \r\n\r\nThe trial judge then convened a bench conference \r\n  with counsel out of the hearing of the jury.Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of closing arguments, \r\n  defense counsel moved the trial court for a declaration of mistrial on the grounds \r\n  that the portion of the solicitorâ€™s closing argument quoted above made reference \r\n  to the evidence of McNeilâ€™s prior bad act in a manner beyond the scope of the \r\n  limited purpose for which it was admitted.Â  Defense counsel argued that, instead \r\n  of being used to show McNeilâ€™s intent at the time he committed the act for which \r\n  he was charged, the solicitor was attempting to appeal to the passion and prejudice \r\n  of the jury.Â  \r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  State \r\n  v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 63, 530 S.E.2d 626, 627-28 (2000).Â  â€œA mistrial \r\n  should only be granted when absolutely necessary,â€ and a defendant must show \r\n  both error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial.Â  Id. \r\n  at 63, 530 S.E.2d at 628; see also State v. Beckham, 334 \r\n  S.C. 302, 310, 513 S.E.2d 606, 610 (1999) (â€œThe granting of a motion for a mistrial \r\n  is an extreme measure which should be taken only where an incident is so grievous \r\n  that prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.â€).\r\nIn this case, we do not discern any error or prejudice \r\n  resulting from the content of the solicitorâ€™s closing statement.Â  The reference \r\n  to the two shootings and the question, â€œhow many times does that young man have \r\n  to be shot,â€ while no doubt intended to capture the jurorsâ€™ attention, did not \r\n  necessarily suggest that the evidence of McNeilâ€™s alleged prior bad act be considered \r\n  for any purpose other than to determine McNeilâ€™s intent when he committed the \r\n  crime charged.Â  Indeed, one of the avenues pursued by McNeilâ€™s attorney in his \r\n  defense was to suggest, even if McNeil did shoot Goodwin, he did not have the \r\n  necessary intent for the jury to find him guilty of ABIK.Â  The solicitorâ€™s statement \r\n  can be reasonably interpreted as merely emphasizing the fact that the prior \r\n  alleged shooting tends to prove the intent with which McNeil acted when he shot \r\n  Goodwin on January 2, 2001.Â  That the jury would draw this conclusion from the \r\n  solicitorâ€™s argument is all the more likely when considering the manner in which \r\n  the solicitor qualified his statement after defense counselâ€™s initial objection, \r\n  adding: â€œShot two times, is that not enough to find malice? Is that not enough \r\n  for there to be malice, ladies and gentlemen?â€Â  The solicitor therefore made \r\n  clear that he was focusing the juryâ€™s attention on McNeilâ€™s intent when he shot \r\n  Goodwin on January 2, 2001.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons above, we find the trial court \r\n  did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of McNeilâ€™s prior bad act, \r\n  nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in denying McNeilâ€™s motion for \r\n  a mistrial based on the solicitorâ€™s closing argument.Â  Finding no error, the \r\n  rulings of the trial court are therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
