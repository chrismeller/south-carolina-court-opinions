Howard, Sr., of Young Clement Rivers, LLP,\r\n            of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Theresa M. Brown appeals from an order of the trial court\r\ngranting summary judgment in favor of Janet Butcher and the Butcher Law Firm,\r\nP.A. (collectively Butcher) in Brown's legal malpractice action against Butcher\r\nstemming from Butcher's representation of Brown in Brown's divorce proceedings.\r\n\nThe trial court issued a detailed order granting summary judgment in favor of\r\nButcher on three separate bases: (1) that Brown was judicially estopped from\r\nasserting the cause of action; (2) viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to\r\nBrown, she suffered no damages or injury as a proximate result of any alleged\r\nnegligence by Butcher; and (3) Brown failed to provide expert testimony necessary\r\nto create a factual issue.\r\n\r\nBecause Brown does not sufficiently challenge all of the trial court's bases in\r\nsupport of the granting of summary judgment, in particular the various individual\r\nfindings on the third basis – – that Brown failed to provide expert testimony\r\nnecessary to create a factual issue – – we affirm. See Jones v. Lott, 387 S.C. 339,\r\n346, 692 S.E.2d 900, 903 (2010) (holding \"where a decision is based on more than\r\none ground, the appellate court will affirm unless the appellant appeals all grounds\r\nbecause the unappealed ground will become the law of the case.\"); First Union\r\nNat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 566, 511 S.E.2d 372, 378 (Ct. App.\r\n1998) (holding an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case and\r\nrequires affirmance); see also Herron v. Century BMW, 395 S.C. 461, 466, 719\r\nS.E.2d 640, 642 (2011) (holding every ground of appeal ought to be so distinctly\r\nstated that the reviewing court may at once see the point which it is called upon to\r\ndecide without having to grope in the dark to ascertain the precise point at issue)\r\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted); McCall v. IKON, 380 S.C. 649,\r\n659-60, 670 S.E.2d 695, 701 (Ct. App. 2008) (noting an appealed order comes to\r\nthe appellate court with a presumption of correctness, with the burden on appellant\r\nto demonstrate reversible error, and the appellate court is obliged to reverse when\r\nerror is called to its attention, but it is not in the business of figuring out on its own\r\nwhether error exists).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, even if we were to find Brown has sufficiently challenged the trial\r\ncourt's rulings in this regard, we would nonetheless affirm on the merits. Based on\r\nthe record before us, the testimony elicited from Brown's expert is insufficient to\r\nmeet the requirements of expert testimony necessary in a malpractice case. See\r\nHarris Teeter, Inc. v. Moore & Van Allen, PLLC, 390 S.C. 275, 289, 701 S.E.2d\r\n742, 749 (2010) (holding an expert witness who concludes a defendant in a\r\nmalpractice case has breached the standard of care but fails to establish the correct\r\nstandard of care, which is the degree of skill, care, knowledge, and judgment\r\nusually possessed and exercised by members of the profession, does not create a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact); id. at 290, 701 S.E.2d at 750 (finding a generic\r\nstatement of what a reasonably competent lawyer would do given the facts of the\r\n\nsituation, which could be applied to any professional negligence claim, does not\r\ncreate a genuine issue of fact as to a breach of the standard of care).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-233","title":"Brown v.

Blitch, Jr., both of\r\n             Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Appellant, Rodriques Carter, was convicted of criminal sexual\r\nconduct (CSC) in the first degree, kidnapping, and burglary in the first degree.\r\nCarter appeals, asserting the trial court erred in (1) finding that he opened the door\r\nto inadmissible hearsay statements by the victim to her mother concerning the\r\n\nidentity of the victim's perpetrator and the circumstances of the assault and (2)\r\npermitting the solicitor to shift the burden of proof to Carter during his closing\r\nargument by remarking on Carter's failure to elicit certain testimony. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. Carter argues the trial court erred in finding he opened the door to inadmissible\r\nhearsay statements by Victim concerning the identity of her perpetrator and the\r\ncircumstances of the assault, based upon Carter questioning Victim's mother\r\n(Mother) about Mother's conduct as a result of Victim's statements. The record\r\nshows that Mother testified on direct examination that she beat Carter with a lamp\r\nbecause of what she learned he had done to her daughter. On cross examination,\r\nMother agreed she \"beat [Carter] bloody,\" and that she beat him for about ten\r\nminutes. Defense counsel then asked, \"Based on what, based on what your\r\ndaughter said, right?\" Mother replied, \"No. Based on what I said.\" As defense\r\ncounsel continued questioning Mother, he again asked her if she was going to kill\r\nCarter, and Mother acknowledged that was her intent. Counsel again asked,\r\n\"Based on what your daughter said?\" Mother responded, \"My daughter didn't say\r\nthat. I did.\" Thereafter, on re-direct examination, the following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\n             [Solicitor]: [Defense Counsel] asked you based upon\r\n             what your daughter said. What did your daughter tell\r\n             you?\r\n\r\n             [Mother]: My daughter couldn't tell me anything but – –\r\n             –\r\n\r\n             [Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I would – – –\r\n\r\n             [Mother]: [Carter] raped her.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel then objected to this testimony as hearsay. The Solicitor\r\nresponded defense counsel had opened the door to the testimony, and defense\r\ncounsel disagreed that he had done so. The trial judge instructed the parties to\r\n\"just move past it.\" The solicitor stated, \"I'm sorry?\" and the trial court stated,\r\n\"That's okay.\" The Solicitor then indicated he had not heard the court's ruling, and\r\nthe trial judge stated, \"Let's ask the next question. Just don't ask that question.\"\r\n(emphasis added). The solicitor then asked Mother why she got upset. When\r\nMother began to respond by saying, \"because my daughter – – –,\" the solicitor\r\ninterrupted her and instructed her not to say what her daughter said. Mother then\r\nstated, \"I'm not telling you what she said. I said because of my daughter. My child\r\nwas raped. That was my reason of being upset.\" Defense counsel objected and\r\n\nmoved to strike this testimony, arguing the witness had no basis in fact from her\r\nown personal knowledge. The trial judge overruled the objection without further\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Carter contends the trial court erred in finding he opened the door to\r\ninadmissible hearsay statements from Mother concerning who raped her daughter.\r\nHe argues the trial court abused its discretion in determining Carter opened the\r\ndoor to the hearsay statements by Victim concerning the identity of the perpetrator\r\nand the circumstances of the assault, because defense counsel's questions\r\nconcerned whether Mother's conduct of beating Carter was the result of statements\r\nby Victim, and he never questioned Mother regarding the substance of those\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, we find the only portion of testimony from Mother that is preserved\r\nfor review is that where Mother stated she was upset because her daughter had\r\nbeen raped. Initially, the solicitor asked Mother what Victim had told her, and\r\ndefense counsel objected to Mother's testimony identifying Carter as the person\r\nwho raped Victim. Upon counsel's objection, the trial court specifically instructed\r\nthe solicitor to move past it and to not ask that question. While the solicitor argued\r\nthe defense opened the door to this testimony, there is no indication the trial court\r\nagreed with this position or found the objected-to testimony admissible on this\r\nbasis. Rather, the trial court effectively sustained defense counsel's objection,\r\ndirecting the solicitor to move on and not to ask that question. Thereafter, counsel\r\nrephrased the question and made sure the witness understood she was not to state\r\nwhat the victim said. Defense counsel did not move to strike this testimony and\r\ndid not ask for a mistrial. Accordingly, no issue is preserved for review as to this\r\ntestimony. See State v. Wilson, 389 S.C. 579, 583, 698 S.E.2d 862, 864 (Ct. App.\r\n2010) (holding appellate courts have recognized that an issue will not be preserved\r\nfor review where a question is answered before an objection may be interposed and\r\nthe trial court sustains a party's objection to improper testimony, if the party does\r\nnot subsequently move to strike the testimony or move for a mistrial, the rationale\r\nbeing that without a motion to strike or motion for a mistrial, when the objecting\r\nparty is sustained, he has received what he asked for and cannot be heard to\r\ncomplain about a favorable ruling on appeal). Further, though Carter notes the\r\nsubsequently elicited testimony from Mother stating she was upset because her\r\ndaughter had been raped, he does not assert on appeal that this testimony was\r\nimproper hearsay or that its admission constituted reversible error.1\r\n\r\n1At any rate, we find such testimony is not inadmissible hearsay, as it was merely\r\nMother's explanation of why she was so upset, i.e. her belief her daughter had been\r\n\nFinally, we find any error in admitting the evidence to be harmless. As argued by\r\nCarter, our supreme court, in the case of Jolly v. State, 314 S.C. 17, 443 S.E.2d 566\r\n(1994), held that \"[i]mproper corroboration testimony that is merely cumulative to\r\nthe victim's testimony . . . cannot be harmless, because it is precisely this\r\ncumulative effect which enhances the devastating impact of improper\r\ncorroboration.\" Id. at 21, 443 S.E.2d at 569. However, as noted by the State, in\r\nState v. Jennings, 394 S.C. 473, 716 S.E.2d 91 (2011), a majority of our supreme\r\ncourt collectively overruled Jolly to the extent it imposed a categorical or per se\r\nrule regarding harmless error. See id. at 482, 716 S.E.2d at 95-96 (Kittredge, J.,\r\nconcurring in a separate opinion joined by Hearn, J.) (agreeing \"with Chief Justice\r\nToal that the apparent categorical rule emanating from Jolly v. State and its\r\nprogeny precluding a finding of harmless error goes too far,\" and though it may be\r\na rare occurrence for the State to prove harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt\r\nin these circumstances, such determinations are necessarily context dependent and\r\na categorical rule is at odds with longstanding harmless error jurisprudence), id. at\r\n483, 716 S.E.2d at 96 (Toal, C.J., dissenting) (disagreeing with the string of cases\r\nproviding improperly admitted hearsay testimony that is merely cumulative to the\r\nvictim's testimony can never be harmless error, finding those cases create a rule of\r\nper se prejudice when testimony is cumulative to the victim's testimony, and such a\r\nrule is contrary to the traditional analysis of improperly admitted hearsay\r\n\r\n\r\nraped. See Rule 801(c), SCRE (\"'Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by\r\nthe declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove\r\nthe truth of the matter asserted.\"). Additionally, this testimony was permissible\r\nunder our rules of evidence, because the statement that Victim was raped did not\r\ngo beyond the parameters set forth in our rules, which limit testimony\r\ncorroborating a victim's complaint of sexual assault to time and place. See Rule\r\n801(d)(1)(D), SCRE (providing a statement is not hearsay if \"[t]he declarant\r\ntestifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the\r\nstatement, and the statement is . . . consistent with the declarant's testimony in a\r\ncriminal sexual conduct case or attempted criminal sexual conduct case where the\r\ndeclarant is the alleged victim and the statement is limited to the time and place of\r\nthe incident\"). See also Dawkins v. State, 346 S.C. 151, 156, 551 S.E.2d 260, 262\r\n(2001) (holding, when a victim in a CSC case testifies, evidence from other\r\nwitnesses that the victim complained of a sexual assault is admissible in\r\ncorroboration, limited to the time and place of the assault). Here, Mother's\r\ntestimony that her daughter was raped does not go beyond the limited\r\ncorroborative testimony allowed by Rule 801, SCRE.\r\n\ntestimony, which requires a finding of prejudice, and concluding Jolly should be\r\noverruled).\r\n\r\nHere, we first note that not only did Victim testify that Carter raped her, but the\r\nneighbor, Marie, also testified that Victim told her Carter had raped her. No\r\nobjection was made to this testimony by Marie, whose testimony occurred prior to\r\nthat of Mother. Thus, Mother's testimony was cumulative to the unobjected-to\r\ntestimony of Marie, and did not simply corroborate Victim's testimony.\r\nAdditionally, the medical testimony of Dr. Morad supports Victim's testimony that\r\nsomething traumatic happened to Victim, as did the testimony of Marie and\r\nMarie's husband, who answered their door to the distraught Victim. Under the\r\ncircumstances, Carter has not shown that the testimony of Mother in this regard\r\nprejudiced him. See id. at 484, 716 S.E.2d at 96 (Toal, C.J., dissenting) (providing\r\na defendant should always be required to prove he suffered prejudice from the\r\nimproper introduction of cumulative hearsay testimony).\r\n\r\n2. Carter contends the trial court erred in permitting the State to shift the burden of\r\nproof to him by remarking, during closing arguments, on Carter's failure to elicit\r\ntestimony concerning DNA evidence. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The State may not comment on a defendant's exercise of a constitutional right.\"\r\nMcFadden v. State, 342 S.C. 637, 640, 539 S.E.2d 391, 393 (2000). \"Specifically,\r\nthe solicitor must not comment, either directly or indirectly, on a defendant's\r\nsilence, failure to testify, or failure to present a defense.\" Id. Here, we do not\r\nbelieve the solicitor's argument, when examined in context, was a direct or an\r\nindirect comment on Carter's silence, his failure to testify, or his failure to present a\r\ndefense. Rather, it was a response to defense counsel's consistent assertions during\r\nclosing argument that, although there was evidence there were vaginal swabs taken\r\nduring Victim's medical examination, there was no sperm and no DNA. The\r\nsolicitor was merely attempting to counter defense counsel's argument that there\r\nwas no DNA or sperm by pointing out that none of the witnesses were ever asked\r\nif there was DNA or sperm present.\r\n\r\nHowever, even assuming the argument constituted an improper comment on\r\nCarter's constitutional right to remain silent or not to testify or call witnesses, we\r\nbelieve the comment was harmless and did not so infect the trial with unfairness as\r\nto make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. See State v. Hill, 382 S.C.\r\n360, 369, 675 S.E.2d 764, 769 (Ct. App. 2009) (noting, in a case where appellant\r\nasserted the solicitor improperly commented on his right to remain silent and his\r\nright to not present a defense, while it is impermissible for the State to comment\r\n\ndirectly or indirectly upon a defendant's failure to testify at trial, even improper\r\ncomments on a defendant's failure to testify do not automatically require reversal if\r\nthey are not prejudicial to the defendant, and the defendant must show the\r\nimproper comment deprived him of a fair trial). Further, we note the trial court\r\ncharged the jury that the State bore the burden of proving Carter guilty beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt, that Carter had the constitutional right to remain silent and\r\nassertion of that right could not be considered or discussed by the jury, and that\r\nCarter was not required to prove his innocence, but the burden remained on the\r\nState to prove Carter's guilt. See id. at 370, 675 S.E.2d at 769 (finding the trial\r\ncourt's jury instruction that the defendant's silence could not be considered in any\r\nmanner whatsoever and the defendant had no burden of proof and was not required\r\nto prove his innocence should be deemed to have cured any error or prejudice that\r\nmay have resulted from any alleged improper comment from the solicitor's closing\r\nargument).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-241","title":"Johnson v.

Grandmother claims the family court erred in\r\n   making certain evidentiary rulings as well as findings of fact, which improperly\r\n   influenced the family court's decision to grant custody of J.L. to Cousin.\r\n\r\n   Specifically, Grandmother claims the family court erred in excluding records from\r\n   the New York Department of Social Services (DSS); admitting audio tapes of\r\n   threatening phone calls made to Cousin; and excluding the last will and testament\r\n   of a non-party and consequently limiting cross-examination of Cousin on that\r\n   issue. She also argues the family court erred in considering actions of unknown\r\n   third parties; finding Grandmother's home was unstable; finding Cousin had a\r\n   strong moral code; finding Grandmother's age and health affected her ability to\r\n   care for J.L.; considering the amount of time J.L. spent with Cousin prior to the\r\n   final hearing; finding Grandmother's act of coming to South Carolina without\r\n   proper notice to retrieve J.L. affected Grandmother's ability to be a fit custodian;\r\n   and finding Grandmother should not be given preference over Cousin based on the\r\n   degree of kinship to J.L. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. Initially, we note Grandmother sets forth no legal authority to support the vast\r\n   majority of her arguments. As the appellant, Grandmother carries the burden of\r\n   providing sufficient authority to support her arguments. See Rule 208(b)(1)(D),\r\n   SCACR (\"The brief shall be divided into as many parts as there are issues to be\r\n   argued. At the head of each part, the particular issue to be addressed shall be set\r\n   forth in distinctive type, followed by discussion and citations of authority.\");\r\n   Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578, 599, 635 S.E.2d 649, 660 (Ct.\r\n   App. 2006) (noting that when an appellant fails to cite any supporting authority for\r\n   his or her position and makes conclusory arguments, the appellant abandons the\r\n   issue on appeal); State v. Crocker, 366 S.C. 394, 399 n.1, 621 S.E.2d 890, 893 n.1\r\n   (Ct. App. 2005) (holding that conclusory statements unaccompanied by argument\r\n   and citation to authority are insufficient to preserve an issue for appellate review\r\n   and noting that failure to provide such argument and citation renders an issue\r\n   abandoned). With the exception of Grandmother's argument that the family court\r\n   erred in failing to give her preference based on her status as J.L.'s grandmother, we\r\n   hold her arguments are not preserved for our review.\r\n\r\n2. Even if Grandmother properly raised these arguments, we find it was within the\r\n   family court's province to make all of the contested factual findings and\r\n   evidentiary rulings based on the evidence and testimony adduced at the final\r\n\n   hearing. As to the evidentiary rulings, \"A family court's ruling on the admission or\r\n   exclusion of evidence will only be reversed if it constitutes an abuse of discretion\r\n   amounting to an error of law.\" High v. High, 389 S.C. 226, 239, 697 S.E.2d 690,\r\n   696 (Ct. App. 2010). Further, as the appellant, Grandmother must show prejudice\r\n   from the admission of evidence to warrant reversal. See Fields v. Reg'l Med. Ctr.\r\n   Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005) (holding appellant must\r\n   show both legal error and resulting prejudice from admission of evidence to\r\n   warrant reversal). As to Grandmother's objection that Rule 7(d), SCRFC, permits\r\n   the admission of the New York DSS files, the family court permitted Grandmother\r\n   to introduce the New York medical records and photographs from the New York\r\n   DSS file that directly related to the abuse allegations. As a result, we find\r\n   Grandmother failed to demonstrate how the family court's evidentiary rulings\r\n   prejudiced her.\r\n\r\n   As to the factual findings, because the family court was in a better position to\r\n   assess the credibility and demeanor of witnesses, we defer to the family court. See\r\n   Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 392, 709 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2011) (stating the\r\n   appellate court generally defers to the factual findings of the family court regarding\r\n   credibility because the family court is in a better position to observe the witness\r\n   and his or her demeanor). Further, while we recognize conflicting evidence and\r\n   testimonies were presented on which party would better serve J.L.'s interests, we\r\n   find ample evidence in the record to support the family court's decision to award\r\n   custody of J.L. to Cousin. See S.C.D.S.S. v. Mary C., 396 S.C. 15, 26, 720 S.E.2d\r\n   503, 509 (Ct. App. 2011) (holding that it is proper to defer to the family court even\r\n   if conflicting evidence is presented on appeal as long as ample evidence in the\r\n   record supports the family court's findings and conclusions); Pinckney v. Warren,\r\n   344 S.C. 382, 387-88, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001) (holding the appellant carries\r\n   the burden of demonstrating error in the family court's findings of fact).\r\n\r\n3. We separately address Grandmother's argument that the family court erred in\r\n   failing to give her preference based on her status as J.L.'s grandmother.\r\n   Grandmother claims that because J.L.'s mother (Mother) was alive when\r\n   Grandmother instituted this custody action and wanted J.L. to live with\r\n   Grandmother, Mother's preference controls the family court's custody decision.\r\n   We disagree.\r\n\r\n   The best interest of the child is the primary and controlling consideration of the\r\n   family court in all child custody controversies. Moore v. Moore, 300 S.C. 75, 78-\r\n   79, 386 S.E.2d 456, 458 (1989). \"Nevertheless, there is a rebuttable presumption\r\n\nthat it is in the best interest of any child to be in the custody of its biological\r\nparent.\" Id. at 79, 386 S.E.2d at 458. However, when the custody controversy\r\ndoes not involve the natural parents, but instead, as here, involves family members,\r\n\"their status, as blood relatives, is but one factor in determining the child's best\r\ninterests.\" McCutcheon v. Charleston Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 302 S.C. 338,\r\n347, 396 S.E.2d 115, 120 (Ct. App. 1990); see also Dunn v. Dunn, 298 S.C. 365,\r\n367-68, 380 S.E.2d 836, 838 (1989) (finding section 20-7-1820, the predecessor to\r\nsection 63-9-1110, did not create a preference for blood relatives in adoption\r\nproceedings because the grandparent status of the appellants was but one factor in\r\ndetermining the child's best interests); Kemry v. Fox, 273 S.C. 268, 269, 255\r\nS.E.2d 836, 837 (1979) (\"The welfare of the child and what is in his/her best\r\ninterest is the primary, paramount and controlling consideration of the Court in all\r\nchild custody controversies. While, in a contest for custody of a child between a\r\ngrandparent and a party not related to the child, some weight should be given to the\r\ngrandparent's status as a relative, the welfare and best interests of the child are\r\ndeterminative.\" (internal citations omitted)).\r\n\r\nAlthough the outcome might be different if Mother was still alive, a biological\r\nparent is not involved. As such, Grandmother's argument that she is entitled to\r\npreference in the court's custody determination is not availing. See Marquez v.\r\nCaudill, 376 S.C. 229, 245, 656 S.E.2d 737, 745 (2008) (finding the maternal\r\ngrandmother had no biological preference in a custody action against the stepfather\r\nand holding the grandmother could not step into her deceased daughter's place\r\nbecause the grandmother remained a third party seeking custody). Because\r\nGrandmother cannot step into Mother's place in this custody dispute, the\r\ncontrolling consideration is J.L.'s best interests. To that end, as in all custody\r\ndisputes, the family court must consider the character, fitness, attitude, and\r\ninclinations on the part of each party as they impact on the child. See Epperly v.\r\nEpperly, 312 S.C. 411, 415, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886 (1994). Psychological, physical,\r\nenvironmental, spiritual, educational, medical, family, emotional, and recreational\r\naspects of the child's life should also be considered. Wheeler v. Gill, 307 S.C. 94,\r\n99, 413 S.E.2d 860, 863 (Ct. App. 1992). \"In other words, the totality of\r\ncircumstances unique to each particular case constitutes the only scale upon which\r\nthe ultimate decision can be weighed.\" Paparella v. Paparella, 340 S.C. 186, 189,\r\n531 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 2000). After a thorough review of the record and\r\nthe family court's final order, we find the family court considered the above-\r\nreferenced factors in its decision when it awarded custody of J.L. to Cousin.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-242","title":"State v.

We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities:\r\n\r\n1.     As to whether the circuit court erred in sentencing Rogers to twelve years:\r\nState v.

As to whether the circuit court erred in denying Rogers's motion to suppress\r\nevidence seized from the vehicle based on a lack of reasonable suspicion and\r\nprobable cause: State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 248, 525 S.E.2d 535, 539 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1999) (\"A police officer may stop and briefly detain and question a person for\r\ninvestigative purposes, without treading upon his Fourth Amendment rights, when\r\nthe officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts, short of\r\nprobable cause for arrest, that the person is involved in criminal activity.\").\r\n\r\n3.    As to whether the circuit court erred in denying Rogers's motion for directed\r\nverdict: State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 321, 555 S.E.2d 402, 404 (2001) (\"A\r\ndefendant is entitled to a directed verdict [only] when the State fails to produce\r\nevidence of the offense charged.\"); State v.

Co., South Carolina Property &\r\n             Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this workers' compensation action, after an injured employee,\r\nScottie Wayne Floyd (Decedent), passed away more than six years after his\r\noriginal injury, his mother and personal representative of his estate, Betty Joe\r\nFloyd (Mother), alleged he was entitled to a permanent award for the loss of use of\r\nthe brain and back as well as permanent disability and also lifetime benefits and\r\nthus she was now eligible for benefits. She contends his discontinuation of seizure\r\nmedicine was the proximate cause of his death in September 2008, not the 2001\r\nworkplace accident that caused the seizures. Mother appeals circuit court's\r\naffirming the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission's denial\r\nof her claims. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     The Appellate Panel did not err in finding Decedent's death was the\r\nproximate result of the September 13, 2001 workplace accident because substantial\r\nevidence supports that decision. See Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C. 435, 440,\r\n622 S.E.2d 569, 571 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding the Appellate Panel's decision must\r\nbe affirmed if supported by substantial evidence in the record); see also Shealy v.\r\nAiken Cnty., 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000) (holding in workers'\r\ncompensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate finder of fact); Bass v.\r\nKenco Grp., 366 S.C. 450, 458, 622 S.E.2d 577, 581 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding the\r\nfinal determination of the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved for the\r\nAppellate Panel); Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 290, 599 S.E.2d\r\n604, 611 (Ct. App. 2004) (determining that when the evidence conflicts over a\r\nfactual issue, the findings of the Appellate Panel are conclusive); Stone v. Traylor\r\nBros., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding this court\r\nmay not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of\r\nthe evidence on questions of fact).\r\n\r\n2.     The Appellate Panel did not err in determining Mother is not in the class of\r\npersons who the Act deems to be conclusively wholly dependent for support on\r\nDecedent in derogation of section 42-9-140(B) of the South Carolina Code.\r\nSection 42-9-140(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) provides, \"If the\r\ndeceased employee leaves no dependents or nondependent children, the employer\r\nshall pay the commuted amounts provided for in Section 42-9-290 for whole\r\ndependents . . . to his father and mother, irrespective of age or dependency.\"\r\n\n(emphasis added). Section 42-9-290 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012)\r\nprovides, \"If death results . . . while total disability still continues and within six\r\nyears after the accident, the employer shall pay [benefits] . . . .\" (emphasis added).\r\nBecause Decedent died more than six years after the original injury, Mother is not\r\neligible for benefits under section 42-9-140(B). See Gunnells v. Raybestos-\r\nManhattan, Inc., 261 S.C. 106, 110-11, 198 S.E.2d 535, 536 (1973) (\"By the terms\r\nof the statute, the right to such benefits is expressly limited to cases in which 'death\r\nresults proximately from an accident and within two years thereafter [o]r while\r\ntotal disability still continues and within six years after the accident . . . .' . . . .\r\nUnfortunately for claimant, this leaves unfulfilled a further condition precedent to\r\nthe accrual of any right to compensation for the death of her husband, I.e., that\r\nsuch death occur 'within six years after the accident.' . . . . '[T]he right of recovery\r\nis conditioned upon' satisfaction of the requisites of the statute by which the right\r\nwas conferred. The requirement of death within six years of the accident not\r\nhaving been met, the right asserted never vested in the claimant.\" (first ellipses by\r\ncourt) (citations omitted)).\r\n\r\n3.     Finally, the Appellate Panel did not err in (a) finding Mother was not a\r\ndependent and not entitled to benefits Decedent would have received \"had he\r\nlived\" for loss of use of his back and brain pursuant to sections 42-9-30 and -280 of\r\nthe South Carolina Code and Regulation 67-1101(C) of the South Carolina Code;\r\n(b) failing to find that prior to Decedent's death he had a permanent 20% loss of\r\nuse of the back, arising out of the compensable accident of April 9, 2004, and\r\npursuant to section 42-9-280, Mother is entitled to the unpaid balance of\r\ncompensation Decedent would have been entitled to had he lived, because his\r\ndeath was from any cause other than the April 9, 2004 injury; (c) in failing to find\r\nthat prior to Decedent's death, he had a permanent 85% loss of use of the brain\r\narising from the admitted September 13, 2001 accident, and pursuant to section 42-\r\n9-280, Mother is entitled to the unpaid balance of compensation he would have be\r\nentitled to if he lived, because his death was from any other cause than his\r\nSeptember 13, 2001 injury; and (d) in failing to award 2,279.4 weeks of benefits\r\nfor loss of use of brain to Mother pursuant to section 42-9-30 and Regulation 67-\r\n1101(C).\r\n\r\nAs stated above, substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panel's determination\r\nDecedent died as a result of the original accident. Therefore, section 4-9-280 does\r\nnot apply here. See Stone v. Roadway Express, 367 S.C. 575, 585, 627 S.E.2d 695,\r\n700 (2006) \"[Section] 42-9-290 is the applicable statute where the employee dies\r\nfrom the injury or accident which entitled him to workers' compensation benefits.\r\n\nIt simply has no application to [section] 42-9-280, which applies when . . . the\r\nemployee dies from an independent cause.\").\r\n\r\nFurther, section 42-9-280 requires a party to be a dependent to receive benefits\r\nunder it. Substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panel's decision that Mother\r\nwas not a dependent of Decedent. See Shuler, 366 S.C. at 440, 622 S.E.2d at 571\r\n(holding the Appellate Panel's decision must be affirmed if supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence in the record); see also Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at\r\n442 (holding in workers' compensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate\r\nfinder of fact); Bass, 366 S.C. at 458, 622 S.E.2d at 581 (\"The final determination\r\nof witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved for the\r\n[A]ppellate [P]anel.\"); Hargrove, 360 S.C. at 290, 599 S.E.2d at 611 (determining\r\nthat when the evidence conflicts over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate\r\nPanel are conclusive). Accordingly, Mother was not entitled to benefits under\r\nsection 42-9-280. Further, because Decedent's death arose out of the original\r\naccident but transpired more than six years after the accident, Mother is not\r\neligible for benefits. Moreover, no award was made under sections 42-910 or -30\r\nbecause Decedent was not found to have reached MMI and was receiving\r\ntemporary benefits.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-252","title":"State v.

Breakfield, for cause. Woods argues the circuit court erred in (1)\r\nproceeding with the appeal without the entire record from the probate court as\r\n\nrequired by section 62-1-308(b) of the South Carolina Code, (2) failing to remove\r\nBreakfield because he lied under oath, and (3) failing to issue to Woods subpoenas\r\nupon his request. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities:\r\n\r\n1. As to whether the circuit court erred in proceeding without the entire probate\r\ncourt record: McCall v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987)\r\n(stating a complainant must show error and prejudice to be entitled to relief for a\r\nprocedural violation); Cox v.

(\"This [c]ourt will\r\nnot reward a party's recalcitrant and obstructionist conduct at trial by overturning\r\nthe decree for technical noncompliance with [a rule of civil procedure].\").\r\n\r\n2. As to the remaining issues: Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 41, 619 S.E.2d\r\n437, 449 (Ct.

McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General\r\n        Matthew J. Friedman, and Assistant Attorney Ashleigh\r\n        R. Wilson, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: This post-conviction relief (PCR) appeal arises out of Petitioner\r\nJames Bowers' conviction for armed robbery. Bowers was sentenced to life\r\nwithout parole (LWOP) pursuant to section 17-25-45(A) of the South Carolina\r\nCode (2003), also known as the two-strikes law. On appeal, Bowers argues the\r\nPCR court erred by finding trial counsel was not ineffective when trial counsel\r\nfailed to challenge his prior conviction for assault with intent to ravish as a \"most\r\nserious offense\" for purposes of imposing a LWOP sentence pursuant to the two-\r\nstrikes law. Because we find the issue unpreserved for review, we must affirm the\r\nPCR court's denial of Bowers' application.\r\n\r\nThe PCR court ruled trial counsel sufficiently challenged the use of Bowers' prior\r\nconvictions for purposes of the trial court imposing LWOP pursuant to the two-\r\nstrikes law. At the hearing, the PCR court found trial counsel raised to the trial\r\ncourt the issue of whether assault with intent to ravish was the same offense as the\r\nmost serious offenses of assault with intent to commit first or second-degree\r\ncriminal sexual conduct (CSC). The record indicates that at sentencing, trial\r\ncounsel objected to the trial court using Bowers' prior assault with intent to ravish\r\nconviction to enhance his conviction, arguing the two-strikes law is\r\nunconstitutional and the conviction was too remote. Trial counsel also objected to\r\nusing Bowers' prior robbery conviction to enhance Bowers' conviction. The State\r\nexplained it was relying on the assault with intent to ravish conviction to enhance\r\nBowers' conviction pursuant to the two-strikes law. Trial counsel responded, \"I am\r\nsatisfied [that the assault with intent to ravish conviction] was the same offense,\r\nbasically, that we have here today and our laws concerning criminal sexual\r\nconduct.\" In ruling the prior assault with intent to ravish conviction could enhance\r\nBowers' sentence to LWOP, the trial court found \"as [Bowers' counsel] indicated,\r\nthis particular offense, that is, assault with intent to ravish, is the same as assault\r\nwith intent to commit criminal sexual conduct in either the first or the second\r\ndegree which comes within the most serious crime classification.\" Trial counsel\r\ndid not object to this ruling, and the trial court sentenced Bowers to LWOP. Based\r\non the foregoing, we have concerns trial counsel did not challenge the use of the\r\nprior assault with intent to ravish conviction on the basis that it was not the\r\nequivalent to first or second-degree CSC. Instead, trial counsel actually agreed\r\nwith the State that the prior conviction is equivalent to first or second-degree CSC\r\nand could be used as a \"most serious offense\" to impose LWOP pursuant to the\r\ntwo-strikes law.\r\n\r\nHowever, we need not address whether the PCR court's finding is clearly\r\nerroneous. Despite the foregoing, PCR counsel did not raise the issue of the use of\r\n\nthe assault with intent to ravish prior conviction as a \"most serious offense\" to the\r\nPCR court. At the PCR hearing, PCR counsel argued Bowers' only ground for\r\nchallenging sentencing was trial counsel's failure to challenge the sentence based\r\non the prior conviction of common law robbery. PCR counsel did not provide the\r\nPCR court with any arguments, testimony, objections, or case law that trial counsel\r\nwas ineffective in challenging the LWOP sentence based on the use of Bowers'\r\nprior conviction for assault with intent to ravish as a \"most serious offense.\"\r\nSimilarly, PCR counsel did not provide the PCR court with any arguments that\r\ntrial counsel's errors prejudiced Bowers or subjected him to an increased sentence.\r\nSee Patrick v. State, 349 S.C. 203, 207, 562 S.E.2d 609, 611 (2002) (noting the\r\nburden of proof is on a PCR applicant to prove trial counsel was ineffective and\r\ntrial counsel's errors prejudiced the applicant). Additionally, in Bowers' two Rule\r\n59(e), SCRCP motions to alter or amend the judgment, PCR counsel alleged trial\r\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the LWOP sentence based upon his\r\nprior conviction for common law robbery, but did not allege trial counsel was\r\nineffective for failing to challenge the LWOP sentence based upon the prior assault\r\nwith intent to ravish conviction. Further, the Rule 59(e) motions did not challenge\r\nthe PCR court's finding on trial counsel's challenge to the use of the prior assault\r\nwith intent to ravish conviction as a \"most serious offense.\" Because Bowers\r\nfailed to meet his burden of proof, we hereby affirm the decision of the PCR\r\ncourt.1 See Terry v. State, 394 S.C. 62, 66, 714 S.E.2d 326, 329 (2011) (\"A PCR\r\napplicant bears the burden of establishing he is entitled to relief.\"); id.

It asserts the trial court erred in\r\ndismissing the action due to LOP's failure to answer Respondents' purported\r\ncounterclaims, arguing no counterclaim was asserted. LOP also argues the court\r\nerred in dismissing the action due to LOP's failure to name Strategic Lending\r\nSolutions, LLC, as a real party in interest under Rule 17(A), SCRCP.\r\n\r\nAfter the trial court dismissed LOP's present action, LOP and Strategic Lending\r\nSolutions, LLC, filed a new action (Second Action) against Respondents similar to\r\nLOP's amended complaint in the present action.

Blitch, Jr., both of\r\n             Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Anthony Tilmon appeals his convictions for three counts of lewd\r\nact on a minor and three counts of criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor,\r\narguing the trial court erred in: (1) refusing to admit evidence of his good character\r\n\ntowards children; (2) denying his motion for a mistrial; and (3) denying his motion\r\nto suppress a videotape of Victim's forensic interview. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nDuring the Spring of 2009, Tilmon's mother occasionally babysat Victim at the\r\nTilmons' home in Aiken, South Carolina. Later that year, Victim and her mother\r\nmoved to Florida. Once in Florida, Victim disclosed to her mother that Tilmon\r\nhad sexually assaulted her three different times while she was staying at the\r\nTilmons' home.\r\n\r\nLater, during an interview with investigators at the Aiken County Sheriff's Office,\r\nTilmon confessed to sexually assaulting Victim. The majority of Tilmon's\r\nconfession was videotaped. Tilmon also completed a written statement detailing\r\neach of the three incidents of abuse.\r\n\r\nVictim, who was nine-years-old at the time of trial, testified in detail regarding\r\neach incident of abuse. The State also presented the testimony of Detective Carol\r\nDansky, who testified that she conducted a forensic interview of Victim at the\r\nBroward Sheriff's Office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in November 2009. Over\r\ndefense counsel's objection, the trial court admitted a videotape recording of the\r\nforensic interview and played it for the jury. Subsequently, the defense offered the\r\ntestimony of several character witnesses. Additionally, Tilmon testified that he did\r\nnot sexually assault Victim and that he confessed because he felt threatened by the\r\ninvestigating officers.\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty on all six counts as indicted. The trial judge\r\nsentenced Tilmon to thirty-five-years' imprisonment on each count of CSC with a\r\nminor and to fifteen years on each count of lewd act with a minor. All sentences\r\nwere to run concurrently. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nTilmon argues the trial court erred in refusing to allow two of his character\r\nwitnesses to testify concerning his good character towards children. In this case,\r\nTilmon did not proffer the testimony of either of his witnesses, nor did he explain\r\nwhat the testimony of his witnesses would have been. Therefore, we find this\r\nargument is not preserved for our review. See State v. Santiago, 370 S.C. 153,\r\n163, 634 S.E.2d 23, 29 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding \"a proffer of testimony is required\r\nto preserve the issue of whether testimony was properly excluded by the trial\r\n\njudge, and an appellate court will not consider error alleged in the exclusion of\r\ntestimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the excluded testimony\r\nwould have been\").\r\n\r\nTilmon next argues the trial court erred in refusing to grant a mistrial because of\r\nVictim's conduct during defense counsel's closing argument. The State contends\r\nthat this issue is not preserved because defense counsel did not contemporaneously\r\nobject when the alleged conduct occurred. Even if this issue was preserved, the\r\ntrial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial. See State v.\r\nAnderson, 322 S.C. 89, 91-92, 470 S.E.2d 103, 105 (1996) (\"The decision whether\r\nto grant a mistrial because of a witness's outburst rests within the sound discretion\r\nof the trial judge and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion or manifest\r\nprejudice to the complaining party.\"). Directly after closing argument, the trial\r\njudge had the jury take a break and sua sponte sought to determine whether Victim\r\nneeded to leave the courtroom because of her emotions. This inquiry led to\r\nVictim's mother removing Victim from the courtroom before her behavior could\r\nescalate to the point of an outburst. Thus, the trial judge took sufficient curative\r\nmeasures to ensure a mistrial was unnecessary. See id. at 93, 470 S.E.2d at 105\r\n(finding no error in denial of mistrial motion when the trial judge dismissed the\r\njury and called a recess as soon as the outburst occurred in order to give the\r\nwitness time to calm down). Moreover, in denying the motion for a mistrial, the\r\ntrial judge stated that he had observed Victim throughout closing argument and he\r\ndid not hear her cry aloud. He further noted that he watched the jury closely\r\nduring closing argument and the jury did not appear distracted in any way.\r\nBecause the trial judge was in the best position to assess the degree to which the\r\njury may have been prejudiced by Victim's conduct, we find the trial judge did not\r\nabuse his discretion in denying Tilmon's motion for a mistrial. See id. at 93, 470\r\nS.E.2d at 105-06 (finding the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying\r\nappellant's motion for a mistrial because \"the trial judge was in the best position to\r\nassess the degree to which the jury may have been prejudiced by the [witness's]\r\noutburst\").\r\n\r\nLast, Tilmon argues that the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress a\r\nvideotape of Victim's forensic interview violated his right to confrontation.\r\nSpecifically, he contends that the application of South Carolina Code subsection\r\n17-23-175(A) (Supp. 2012), which permits the admission of out-of-court\r\nstatements from child sexual abuse victims when certain conditions are met,\r\nviolated the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause because (1) Victim was not\r\navailable for cross-examination during the taping of the interview and (2) the\r\n\nstatements in the videotape constituted prior consistent statements that improperly\r\nbolstered Victim's testimony.1\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause guarantees \"[i]n all criminal\r\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the\r\nwitnesses against him.\" U.S. Const. amend. VI. In Crawford v. Washington, 541\r\nU.S. 36, 53-54 (2004), the United States Supreme Court held that testimonial\r\nhearsay statements are not admissible under the Confrontation Clause unless the\r\ndeclarant is unavailable to testify at trial and the accused had a prior opportunity to\r\ncross-examine the declarant. \"However, the Confrontation Clause places no\r\nconstraints at all on the use of the declarant's prior testimonial statements when the\r\ndeclarant appears for cross-examination at trial.\" State v. Hill, 394 S.C. 280, 291,\r\n715 S.E.2d 368, 374-75 (Ct. App. 2011) (citing State v. Stokes, 381 S.C. 390, 401,\r\n673 S.E.2d 434, 439 (2009)). \"The Confrontation Clause 'does not bar admission\r\nof a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.'\"\r\nStokes, 381 S.C. at 401, 673 S.E.2d at 439 (quoting Crawford, 541 U.S. at 59 n.9).\r\n\r\nTilmon contends that his cross-examination was not effective because he did not\r\nhave the opportunity to cross-examine Victim during the forensic interview.\r\nHowever, \"the Confrontation Clause 'guarantees only an opportunity for effective\r\ncross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to\r\nwhatever extent, the defense might wish.'\" Id. at 401-02, 673 S.E.2d at 439-40\r\n(quoting United States v. Owens, 484 U.S. 554, 559 (1988)). \"Indeed the\r\nopponent's opportunity for cross-examination has been deemed the 'main and\r\nessential purpose of confrontation.'\" Id. at 402, 673 S.E.2d at 440. Thus, it is the\r\nopportunity to cross-examine that is constitutionally protected.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, Victim was present at trial and Tilmon had the opportunity to\r\ncross-examine Victim regarding her statements in the videotape while she was on\r\nthe stand.2 See Hill, 394 S.C. at 291-92, 715 S.E.2d at 374-75 (holding there is no\r\nConfrontation Clause violation when the declarant appears for cross-examination\r\nat trial). Because Tilmon had the opportunity for effective cross-examination, we\r\nfind he was not denied his right to confrontation.\r\n\r\n1At oral argument, Scott conceded that the statutory conditions required for\r\nadmission of the videotape were met.\r\n2Notably, Tilmon's defense counsel extensively cross-examined Victim regarding\r\nher testimony at trial; however, counsel did not cross-examine Victim about the\r\nvideotape or her testimony on the videotape.\r\n\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and GEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-276","title":"State v.

Code\r\nAnn. § 42–1–360(2) (Supp. 2012). In determining whether Frazier was subject to\r\nthe Act, we may take our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. See\r\nShuler v. Tri-County Elec.

Accordingly, we hold Frazier was subject\r\nto the Act. See Ost v. Integrated Prods.

Malloy McEachin, Jr., of McEachin & McEachin,\r\n            P.A., of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this tort action, Appellants appeal the trial court's grant of\r\nsummary judgment, contending the trial court erred in finding their causes of\r\naction are barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act\r\n\n(the Act) because the claims fall within the personal comfort doctrine. According\r\nto Appellants, because swimming is not necessary to an employee's life, comfort,\r\nand convenience, it is not covered by the personal comfort doctrine. We affirm.\r\n\r\nWhether the exclusivity provision of the Act applies, barring an employee-\r\nplaintiff's tort claim against a defendant-employer, is a jurisdictional question;\r\ntherefore, it is a question of law. See Sabb v. S.C. State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 422-\r\n23, 567 S.E.2d 231, 234 (2002) (noting whether the Act's exclusivity provision\r\napplies invokes a question of the circuit court's original jurisdiction); Harrell v.\r\nPineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 320, 331, 523 S.E.2d 766, 769, 775\r\n(1999) (noting the determination of statutory employment and the consequent\r\napplication of the exclusivity provision is a question of law); Glass v. Dow Chem.\r\nCo., 325 S.C. 198, 201-02, 482 S.E.2d 49, 50-51 (1997) (reviewing the appellant's\r\nargument that the Act provided the exclusive remedy for the respondent as a\r\nquestion of law because it was jurisdictional in nature). In such cases, \"this [c]ourt\r\nhas the power and duty to review the entire record and decide the jurisdictional\r\nfacts in accord with the preponderance of the evidence.\" Harrell, 337 S.C. at 320,\r\n523 S.E.2d at 769. \"'In determining jurisdictional questions, doubts of jurisdiction\r\nwill be resolved in favor of inclusion of employees within workers' compensation\r\ncoverage rather than exclusion.'\" Hill v. Eagle Motor Lines, 373 S.C. 422, 429,\r\n645 S.E.2d 424, 427 (2007) (quoting Wilson v. Georgetown Cnty., 316 S.C. 92, 94,\r\n447 S.E.2d 841, 842 (1994)).\r\n\r\nThe personal comfort doctrine assists a tribunal in determining whether an\r\nemployee's actions, while entirely personal activities engaged in at work, are such\r\nthat they are considered incidental to employment and therefore covered under the\r\nAct. Osteen v. Greenville Cnty. Sch. Dist., 333 S.C. 43, 46, 508 S.E.2d 21, 23\r\n(1998). The personal comfort doctrine provides:\r\n\r\n             Such acts as are necessary to the life, comfort, and\r\n             convenience of the servant while at work, though strictly\r\n             personal to himself, and not acts of service, are incidental\r\n             to the service, and injury sustained in the performance\r\n             thereof is deemed to have arisen out of the employment.\r\n             A man must breathe and occasionally drink water while\r\n             at work . . . . That such acts will be done in the course of\r\n             employment is necessarily contemplated, and they are\r\n             inevitable incidents. Such dangers as attend them,\r\n             therefore, are incident dangers. At the same time injuries\r\n\n             occasioned by them are accidents resulting from the\r\n             employment.\r\n\r\nMack v. Branch No. 12 Post Exch., 207 S.C. 258, 264-65, 35 S.E.2d 838, 840\r\n(1945). However, the personal comfort doctrine \"has consistently been limited to\r\nimperative acts such as eating, drinking, smoking, seeking relief from discomfort,\r\npreparing to begin or quit work, and resting or sleeping.\" Osteen, 333 S.C. at 47-\r\n48, 508 S.E.2d at 23. Specifically, seeking relief from discomfort \"includes getting\r\nwarm, getting fresh air or relief from heat, and seeking toilet facilities.\" Id. at 47\r\nn.2, 508 S.E.2d at 23 n.2.\r\n\r\nHere, the record contains testimony indicating the inmates had been working in\r\nextreme heat. Additionally, Brown testified the inmates specifically asked if they\r\ncould get in the water to \"cool off,\" providing direct evidence the inmates were\r\nattempting to seek \"relief from the heat.\" Based on this evidence, we hold the trial\r\ncourt did not err in finding the inmates' actions, in getting into the river, fell within\r\nthe personal comfort doctrine.\r\n\r\nFurther, we reject Appellants' contention that the inmates' swimming was outside\r\nthe personal comfort doctrine because it was not \"necessary to the life, comfort,\r\nand convenience\" of the inmates. In Osteen, the court specifically found \"eating,\r\ndrinking, smoking, seeking relief from discomfort, preparing to begin or quit work,\r\nand resting or sleeping,\" to be within the personal comfort doctrine. 333 S.C. at\r\n47-48, 508 S.E.2d at 23. We read the \"necessary to the life, comfort, and\r\nconvenience\" language to apply more broadly to the general categories set forth in\r\nOsteen, rather than to the specific manner in which an employee might accomplish\r\nthose categories. In essence, the court was saying, as a matter of law, these\r\ncategories are \"necessary to the life, comfort, and convenience\" of an employee.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Professor Larson, often cited by South Carolina courts as an authority in workers'\r\ncompensation law, seems to agree, opining after reviewing the cases finding\r\nsmoking \"does not constitute a departure from the employment, it becomes\r\nobvious there is little left of the 'necessity' test in qualifying activities for the\r\npersonal comfort rule.\" 2 Lex K. Larson, Larson's Workers' Compensation §\r\n21.04 (Mathew Bender, Rev. Ed.) (2012); see Bentley v. Spartanburg Cnty., 398\r\nS.C. 418, 422, 730 S.E.2d 296, 298 (2012) (citing Professor Larson's treatise to\r\nidentify the three categories into which work-related injuries fall); Cauley v. Ross\r\n\nAccordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in finding Appellants' actions fell\r\nwithin the personal comfort doctrine. In reaching this determination, we also note\r\nother jurisdictions have reached the same conclusion on similar facts to this case.\r\nSee LFI Pierce, Inc. v. Carter, 829 So.2d 158 (Ala. Civ. App. 2001) (finding\r\nemployee's actions in jumping into a lake to fall within the personal comfort\r\ndoctrine); State Comp. Ins. Fund v. Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., 434 P.2d 619 (Cal.\r\n1967) (finding employee's injury from swimming in a nearby canal on a hot day to\r\nbe within the personal comfort doctrine). Consequently, the trial court did not err\r\nin finding Appellants' claims were barred pursuant to the Act's exclusivity\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilders Supplies, Inc., 238 S.C. 38, 40, 118 S.E.2d 879, 880 (1961) (adopting\r\nProfessor Larson's rule for injuries occurring while assisting co-employees).\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-283","title":"State v.

Blitch, Jr., both of\r\n        Columbia, for Respondent.   \r\n \r\n\nPER CURIAM: Appellant David Tyre seeks review of his convictions for\r\nhomicide by child abuse and infliction of great bodily injury upon a child.\r\nAppellant challenges the trial court's denial of his motion to sever the charges as\r\nwell as the denial of his motion for a directed verdict on the charge of infliction of\r\ngreat bodily injury upon a child. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. As to Appellant's motion to sever the charges, the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in denying the motion. See State v. Caldwell, 378 S.C. 268, 277, 662\r\nS.E.2d 474, 479 (Ct. App. 2008) (\"A motion for severance is addressed to the\r\nsound discretion of the trial court and the court[']s ruling will not be disturbed on\r\nappeal absent an abuse of that discretion.\" (citation omitted)); id. at 277-78, 662\r\nS.E.2d at 479 (\"Criminal charges can be tried together where they (1) arise out of a\r\nsingle chain of circumstances, (2) are proved by the same evidence, (3) are of the\r\nsame general nature, and (4) no real right of the defendant has been prejudiced.\"\r\n(citation omitted)); id. (\"Where the offenses charged in separate indictments are of\r\nthe same general nature involving connected transactions closely related in kind,\r\nplace and character, the trial judge has the discretionary power to order the\r\nindictments tried together if the defendant[']s substantive rights would not be\r\nprejudiced.\" (citations omitted)).\r\n\r\nHere, the two charges, i.e., homicide by child abuse and infliction of great bodily\r\ninjury upon a child, are of the same general nature. Further, the trial court properly\r\nruled that the two alleged offenses arose out of a single chain of circumstances\r\nbecause they were connected events. These events involved the same victim at the\r\nsame location, and Appellant was the only adult present during both incidents.\r\nMoreover, in an attempt to perpetuate his false claim that Victim's arm fracture\r\nresulted from her rolling out of her bed, Appellant himself connected the arm\r\nfracture incident with the head trauma incident. Appellant asked the physician\r\ntreating Victim's head trauma if the trauma could have resulted from her rolling out\r\nof a bed.\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that his rights were unfairly prejudiced because evidence of the\r\nfirst incident resulting in Victim's arm fracture would have been excluded as\r\nimproper propensity evidence in a separate trial for the second incident resulting in\r\nVictim's death. We disagree. At trial, Appellant contested the \"extreme\r\nindifference\" element of homicide by child abuse,1 which is \"a mental state akin to\r\n                                                            \r\n1 Section 16-3-85 of the South Carolina Code (2003) provides, in pertinent part,\r\nthat a person is guilty of homicide by child abuse if the person causes the death of\r\na child under the age of eleven while committing child abuse or neglect, and the\r\n                                                                \r\n \r\n\nintent characterized by a deliberate act culminating in death.\" State v. Jarrell, 350\r\nS.C. 90, 98, 564 S.E.2d 362, 367 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n\r\nEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is admissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE\r\nto show intent. Appellant's infliction of Victim's arm fracture was relevant to\r\nAppellant's intent during his commission of the acts resulting in Victim's death.\r\nAdditionally, Appellant's false claim about the cause of Victim's fracture, and his\r\nperpetuation of this falsity after Victim arrived at the emergency room with head\r\ntrauma, was relevant to Appellant's intent during both incidents. See Rule 401,\r\nSCRE (defining \"relevant evidence\" as evidence \"having any tendency to make the\r\nexistence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more\r\nprobable or less probable than it would be without the evidence\"); cf. State v.\r\nMartucci, 380 S.C. 232, 252-53, 669 S.E.2d 598, 609 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding that\r\nthe defendant's prior abuse of the victim and his attempt to conceal the abuse was\r\nadmissible as proof of intent and the absence of accident with respect to the charge\r\nof homicide by child abuse).\r\n\r\nFurther, we reject Appellant's implication that the State was required to prove the\r\nintent element of infliction of great bodily injury upon a child before the two\r\ncharges could be tried together. \"[I]n determining joinder, the trial judge need not\r\nfind clear and convincing evidence of the charges.\" State v. Cutro, 365 S.C. 366,\r\n374, 618 S.E.2d 890, 894 (2005). \"In the context of the joinder of charges for a\r\njury trial, . . . procedural safeguards are already in place that eliminate the need for\r\npreliminary fact-finding by the trial judge.\" Id. at 375, 618 S.E.2d at 894.2\r\n\r\nFinally, much of the evidence produced at trial pertained to both charges. The\r\nsame family members were involved in both incidents and the same police\r\ndetective took Appellant's statement covering both incidents. Further, Dr. Sahhar's\r\nrecitation of Victim's medical history had relevance to both incidents, as it\r\nindicated Victim had been treated at the same emergency room for both the\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\ndeath occurs under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human \n\r\nlife. \n\r\n2 Moreover, \"[t]he defendant may argue unfair prejudice if, after the State's case, \n\r\nthe trial judge determines that a directed verdict should be granted.\" Cutro, 365 \n\r\nS.C. at 375, 618 S.E.2d at 894 (emphasis added). \"If the trial judge finds there is\r\nno substantial evidence to submit any one of the joined charges to the jury, the\r\ndefendant may move for a mistrial on the basis of unfair prejudice resulting from\r\njoinder.\" Id. (emphasis added).                                                                \r\n \r\n\nfracture and the head trauma. Notably, Dr. Sahhar stated that Victim had no\r\ndiseases of the bones that would cause them to fracture easily.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial court acted well within its discretion in denying\r\nAppellant's motion to sever the charges.\r\n\r\n2. As to the directed verdict motion, the trial court properly denied the motion.\r\nSee State v. Odems, 395 S.C. 582, 586, 720 S.E.2d 48, 50 (2011) (holding that in\r\nevaluating a directed verdict motion, the court must view the evidence in the light\r\nmost favorable to the State); State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 555, 564 S.E.2d 87, 92\r\n(2002) (holding that this court may reverse the trial court's denial of a directed\r\nverdict motion only if there is no evidence to support the trial court's ruling); State\r\nv. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001) (\"If there is any direct\r\nevidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove\r\nthe guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly\r\nsubmitted to the jury.\").\r\n\r\nAppellant argues there existed no evidence that Victim's arm fracture caused\r\nprotracted loss or impairment of the arm's functioning.3 We disagree. The\r\nphysician who performed Victim's autopsy, Dr. John Wrenn, testified that he found\r\na healing contusion on Victim's right arm with an underlying fracture of her\r\nhumerus. Dr. Wrenn also stated that x-rays had been taken of Victim's right arm,\r\nwhich showed a fracture below the shoulder but above the elbow. Further, one of\r\nVictim's nurses testified that Victim's treating physician ultimately had to bind her\r\nright arm against her midsection with an ace bandage to keep the arm immobilized\r\nfor the purpose of letting it heal.\r\n\r\nIn the light most favorable to the State, all of this evidence, taken together, was\r\nsufficient to prove that the fracture Appellant inflicted on Victim caused protracted\r\nimpairment of the right arm's functioning. See Odems, 395 S.C. at 586, 720 S.E.2d\r\nat 50 (holding that in reviewing a ruling on a directed verdict motion, this court\r\nmust view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State). Therefore, this\r\nfracture fell within the definition of \"great bodily injury\" in section 16-3-95 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (2003). Appellant's argument that Victim was still able to\r\n                                                            \r\n3 Section 16-3-95 of the South Carolina Code (2003) provides that it is unlawful to\r\ninflict great bodily injury upon a child. Subsection (C) of the statute defines \"great\r\nbodily injury\" as bodily injury that creates \"a substantial risk of death or which\r\ncauses serious or permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the\r\nfunction of any bodily member or organ.\" (emphasis added).      \r\n \r\n\nmove the right arm and \"could escape from her bandage on her own\" is based on\r\nthe premise that keeping the arm immobilized to allow for healing was\r\nunnecessary. Such a premise is unreasonable and is not supported by the record.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the trial court properly submitted the charge of inflicting\r\ngreat bodily injury upon a child to the jury.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and GEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          \r\n \r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-287","title":"Patel v.

Davis Howser, Howser Newman & Besley, LLC, of\r\n             Columbia, and Andrew Elliott Haselden and Justin Paul\r\n             Novak, Howser Newman & Besley, LLC, both of\r\n             Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Anjay Patel, Mani Investments, LLC, and Mani One, Inc.\r\n(collectively \"the Appellants\") appeal the circuit court's order granting summary\r\njudgment on their legal malpractice claim in favor of The Garrett Law Firm, PC,\r\nCarson M. Henderson, and Billy J. Garrett Jr. (collectively, \"the Respondents\").\r\n\r\nTo the extent the Appellants argue the Respondents proximately caused their\r\ndamages by negligently drafting the lease and option contracts, we find the\r\ndoctrine of collateral estoppel bars them from relitigating this issue. In the\r\nprevious lawsuit, Mani Investments claimed its damages were proximately caused\r\nby the seller's breach of contract and the Respondents' negligent drafting of the\r\ncontracts. An order dismissed the breach of contract claim against the seller\r\nbecause the court found Mani Investments' damages were caused by its failure to\r\nexercise the option. Because the order dismissing that claim is final and decided\r\nthe issue of what caused the Appellants' damages, the Appellants cannot relitigate\r\nthe issue of proximate causation in their malpractice claim against the\r\nRespondents. See Carolina Renewal, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 385 S.C. 550,\r\n554, 684 S.E.2d 779, 782 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating collateral estoppel prevents\r\nrelitigation of an issue when it was \"(1) actually litigated in the prior action; (2)\r\ndirectly determined in the prior action; and (3) necessary to support the prior\r\njudgment\"); Carolina Renewal, 385 S.C. at 556, 684 S.E.2d at 783 (stating\r\ncollateral estoppel applies \"regardless of whether . . . the causes of action in\r\nsuccessive lawsuits are the same\"). Moreover, because Patel co-owned both Mani\r\nInvestments and Mani One, Patel had every opportunity to litigate the causation\r\nissue both on his own behalf and on behalf of Mani One in the previous lawsuit.\r\nSee Snavely v. AMISUB of S.C., Inc., 379 S.C. 386, 398, 665 S.E.2d 222, 228 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2008) (holding mutuality of parties is not required when the party to be\r\nestopped \"had a full and fair opportunity to previously litigate the issues\").\r\nTherefore, we affirm the circuit court's granting of summary judgment because the\r\nAppellants are barred from establishing the proximate cause element of their\r\nmalpractice claim. See Gauld v. O'Shaugnessy Realty Co., 380 S.C. 548, 559, 671\r\nS.E.2d 79, 85 (Ct. App. 2008) (stating summary judgment is appropriate when the\r\nnon-moving party fails to establish an element of its case); Rydde v. Morris, 381\r\n\nS.C. 643, 646, 675 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2009) (stating proximate cause is an element\r\nin a legal malpractice claim).\r\n\r\nTo the extent the Appellants claim the Respondents breached a duty by not drafting\r\nan owner finance agreement, we find the Appellants produced no evidence to\r\nsupport this claim. At oral argument, Appellants' counsel relied on the commercial\r\npurchase agreement and its expert's affidavit as evidence that the Respondents\r\nbreached a duty to the Appellants by drafting a lease with option contract. First,\r\nthe commercial purchase agreement gave the Respondents the option to draft an\r\n\"owner finance agreement\" or \"lease with option agreement, whichever document\r\n[the bank] will approve,\" and the record fails to show whether the bank approved\r\nfinancing for a purchase. There is also no evidence the Appellants told the\r\nRespondents they wanted, or even expected, an owner finance agreement. Second,\r\nthe expert's affidavit does not support the idea that the Respondents breached a\r\nduty by drafting a lease with option agreement. Thus, we affirm the court's\r\ngranting of summary judgment because the Appellants cannot establish a genuine\r\nissue of fact exists as to the element of breach of duty. See S.C. Dep't of Labor,\r\nLicensing, & Regulation v. Chastain, 392 S.C. 259, 262, 708 S.E.2d 818, 820 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2011) (stating an appellate court may affirm a ruling for any grounds\r\nappearing in the record); Hancock v. Mid-S. Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673\r\nS.E.2d 801, 803 (2009) (stating to withstand a motion for summary judgment, the\r\nnon-moving party must submit a mere scintilla of evidence that shows a genuine\r\nissue exists for trial); Gauld, 380 S.C. at 559, 671 S.E.2d at 85 (stating summary\r\njudgment is appropriate when the non-moving party fails to establish an element of\r\nits case); Rydde, 381 S.C. at 646, 675 S.E.2d at 433 (stating breach of duty is an\r\nelement in a legal malpractice claim).\r\n\r\nBecause we affirm on the basis that the Appellants cannot establish the elements of\r\nproximate cause and breach of duty, we do not address the Appellants' other\r\narguments. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address\r\nremaining issues on appeal when disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\nTo the extent the Appellants still pursue their theories of equitable recovery, we\r\nfind summary judgment was appropriate because the Appellants' equitable claims\r\nare based solely on their contractual relationship with the seller and are thus\r\nirrelevant to the Appellants' malpractice claim against the Respondents.\r\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the circuit court's granting of summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and GEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-288","title":"State v.

Riley, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n            Bruce Wyche Bannister, of Bannister & Wyatt, LLC, of\r\n            Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Mary Margret Ruff and Samuel Nunez Jr., formerly wife and\r\nhusband, shared joint custody of their child Gabriel, with Nunez having primary\r\nplacement. In 2009, Ruff sought sole custody, child support, and other relief,\r\narguing a substantial change in circumstances had occurred that affected Gabriel's\r\nwelfare. The family court's final order denied many of her claims, including her\r\n\nrequest for sole custody. We affirm the family court's custody determination,\r\naffirm in part the court's holiday visitation schedule and modify it as it relates to\r\nRuff's Christmas and spring break visitations, and affirm the court's other findings\r\nand legal conclusions.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nRuff and Nunez married in 2000, and Gabriel was born a year later. In 2006, they\r\ndivorced and agreed to share joint custody of Gabriel, with Nunez receiving\r\nprimary placement. In April 2009, Ruff filed an ex parte motion for emergency\r\nrelief, alleging a substantial change in circumstances and seeking sole custody,\r\nsupervised visitation, child support, and other relief. Specifically, Ruff claimed a\r\nsubstantial change of circumstances occurred when Nunez (1) went to New Jersey\r\nfor two months in the spring of 2009, (2) left Gabriel in her care during this time\r\nwithout support and without medical insurance, (3) failed to inform her of his\r\nwhereabouts, and (4) later informed Ruff he wanted Gabriel to move to New\r\nJersey with him.\r\n\r\nFollowing an emergency hearing, the court issued a temporary order, awarding the\r\nparties (1) joint custody, with Ruff receiving primary placement during the school\r\nyear and Nunez having primary placement during the summer, (2) child support to\r\nboth parties for the period of time they had primary placement, and (3) visitation\r\nfor both parties when they did not have primary placement. The order also\r\nenjoined Ruff from using alcohol in Gabriel's presence and ordered both parties to\r\ngive Gabriel his prescribed medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\r\n(ADHD) until he could be evaluated by a physician.\r\n\r\nIn February 2010, the family court found Ruff in contempt for consuming alcohol\r\nin Gabriel's presence. Again in September 2010, the court found Ruff in contempt\r\nfor having alcohol in her home while Gabriel was present. As a result of these two\r\nviolations, the court granted Nunez temporary sole custody, and Gabriel moved to\r\nNew Jersey. A month after Gabriel relocated to New Jersey, the family court\r\nissued a Rule to Show Cause order requiring Nunez to \"immediately restart\r\n[Gabriel's ADHD] medicine.\" However, the court subsequently dismissed the\r\naction because Gabriel was taken off his medication pursuant to his physician's\r\nrecommendation.\r\n\r\nThe family court held a two-day trial in January 2011. In its final order, the court\r\nfound Ruff and Nunez should continue to enjoy joint custody, with primary\r\nplacement remaining with Nunez. Specially, the court found Ruff did not prove a\r\n\nsubstantial change in circumstances affecting the best interests of the child because\r\nNunez's move to New Jersey was in Gabriel's best interests. The court explained\r\nNunez was in a better position to care for Gabriel in New Jersey than in South\r\nCarolina, and his home and job were stable.\r\n\r\nThe court, however, noted that even if Ruff proved a substantial change in\r\ncircumstances, it \"would not be justified in changing the custody arrangements\"\r\ndue to Ruff's current circumstances. The court reasoned \"nothing ha[d] changed\r\nfrom the final order as it relates to [Ruff]\" because she continued to change jobs on\r\na regular basis, lacked stable housing, and depended on her current boyfriend to\r\npay bills. The court went on to find her conduct to be \"self-serving and for the\r\npurpose of gaining an advantage in the [custody] action.\" As to issues relating to\r\nGabriel's ADHD medication, the court found Ruff (1) used Gabriel's ADHD\r\nmedication issues \"as an offensive weapon\" against Nunez to discredit him and\r\n\"sway the [GAL] to support her [custody] action,\" (2) had not cooperated in having\r\nprescriptions filled or paid medical bills in a timely fashion, and (3) had frustrated\r\nNunez's attempts to seek advice from medical professionals regarding Gabriel's\r\nADHD medication. In response to Ruff's contention that she does not have an\r\nalcohol problem, the court found Ruff offered \"no witnesses who would\r\nacknowledge [her] problem with alcohol; instead, [she] chose to offer testimony of\r\nwitnesses who minimized her selfish and irresponsible behaviors.\" Regarding\r\nissues relating to visitation, the court found Ruff uncooperative in scheduling\r\nvisitation with Nunez, which \"increased the cost of this litigation, . . . contributed\r\nto the anxiety and stress [of Gabriel], and has not been in the best interest of the\r\nchild.\" Finally, the court noted Ruff is unemployed and drinks on a regular basis\r\nand has refused to provide medical and dental treatment for Gabriel. Accordingly,\r\nthe court denied Ruff's request for sole custody.\r\n\r\nAs to Gabriel's medical care, the court ordered Nunez to make all medical\r\ndecisions related to Gabriel, finding Nunez had \"exhibited sincere concern\" and\r\ngone to \"extraordinary lengths\" to assure Gabriel received appropriate medical\r\ncare. Additionally, the court ordered the parties to equally divide all uncovered\r\nmedical expenses relating to Gabriel. Regarding outstanding medical bills, the\r\ncourt ordered Nunez to pay Ruff $48 for medical expenses she had previously paid\r\nbut had not been reimbursed for.\r\n\r\nAs to visitation, the family court set forth a minimum visitation schedule but\r\nexplained the \"parties may at any time deviate from [the schedule] . . . as they may\r\nagree.\" The schedule provided Ruff with visitation once a month—coinciding with\r\nGabriel's school holiday schedule—and visitation over the summer. As to\r\n\nvisitation-related costs, the court ordered Ruff to pay the transportation costs of her\r\nvisitation and to fly Gabriel into and out of Newark Liberty International Airport.\r\nLikewise, the court ordered Nunez to pay the transportation costs for his two\r\nweeks' visitation over the summer and to fly Gabriel into and out of Charlotte\r\nDouglas Airport.\r\n\r\nThe family court also set forth a holiday visitation schedule, which provided Nunez\r\nvisitation for Easter each year, Thanksgiving break during odd-numbered years,\r\nand Christmas vacation during even-numbered years. Ruff received visitation for\r\nThanksgiving break during even-numbered years and Christmas vacation during\r\nodd-numbered years, with visitation beginning on December 26 and thus not\r\nincluding Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. Ruff also received visitation for\r\nGabriel's spring break each year, but the court ruled that if Gabriel's spring break\r\nfell on the same week as Easter, Ruff's visitation would be cut short by three days\r\nso that Gabriel could be with Nunez for Easter.\r\n\r\nIn regard to issues raised concerning the parties' ability to contact Gabriel when he\r\nwas in the other party's custody, the court set a phone schedule. The court ordered\r\nthe party with primary placement to provide a minimum of one call per week from\r\nGabriel to the party without physical placement. The court provided, however, that\r\nthe parties must make reasonable arrangements to allow Gabriel to talk on a more\r\nfrequent basis than once a week.\r\n\r\nAs to the alcohol-related restrictions on Ruff, the court noted Ruff had an ongoing\r\nproblem refraining from the use of alcohol in front of Gabriel. Therefore, the court\r\nfound the alcohol restrictions should continue. Specifically, the order provided\r\nRuff could not possess alcohol in her home or consume alcohol when Gabriel was\r\nin her presence and care.\r\n\r\nRegarding child support, the family court ordered Ruff to pay $475 per month in\r\nchild support and retroactive child support for a total of six months that Nunez had\r\nphysical custody of Gabriel. Although Ruff testified she currently had no income\r\nbecause she was unemployed, she also testified she was expecting to receive\r\nunemployment benefits after the trial ended on January 6, 2011 and was currently\r\nlooking for employment. Based on this testimony, the court found Ruff's\r\n\"unemployment benefits shall begin or [she] will have employment by the end of\r\nJanuary, 2011.\" Moreover, the court imputed income to Ruff consistent with the\r\nincome she received prior to losing her job. The court justified the imputation of\r\nincome because Ruff (1) \"is able[-]bodied and capable of earning a living equal to\r\n\nher income prior to the beginning of th[e] action,\" and (2) was employed during the\r\npendency of the action, except for a short period of time before and during the trial.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the GAL's fee, the family court ordered Ruff to pay the entire fee\r\nbecause Ruff's \"behavior resulted in a substantial balance due to the [GAL].\" The\r\ncourt explained that \"the length of time this matter was pending [wa]s a direct\r\nresult of [Ruff]'s actions,\" and her child custody action was ultimately\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\n      II.    Issue on Appeal\r\n\r\nRuff asserts on appeal the family court erred in making findings and conclusions\r\nthat were against the preponderance of the evidence—or in not making any\r\nfindings or conclusions as to \"crucial\" facts—when the court:\r\n\r\n   (1) Denied Ruff's request for sole custody;\r\n   (2) Continued to enjoin Ruff from consuming or possessing alcohol in Gabriel's\r\n       presence;\r\n   (3) Ordered holiday visitation;\r\n   (4) Ordered Ruff to pay transportation costs for her visitation;\r\n   (5) Ordered Ruff to obtain unemployment benefits or employment by the end of\r\n       January 2011;\r\n   (6) Imputed income to Ruff at the previous level she was paid before she \n\r\n       became unemployed; \n\r\n   (7) Ordered Ruff to pay retroactive child support;\r\n   (8) Ordered Ruff to pay half of Gabriel's uncovered medical expenses;\r\n   (9) Ordered Nunez to reimburse Ruff $48 for Gabriel's outstanding medical\r\n       bills;\r\n   (10) Set a telephone contact schedule;\r\n   (11) Granted Nunez the exclusive right to make all medical decisions related to\r\n          Gabriel; and\r\n   (12) Ordered Ruff to pay the GAL's fee in full.\r\n\r\nWe address each issue separately.\r\n\r\n      III.   Standard of Review\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the family court, our standard of review is de novo. Argabright v.\r\nArgabright, 398 S.C. 176, 179, 727 S.E.2d 748, 750 (2012). Therefore, we may\r\nfind facts in accordance with our view of the preponderance of the evidence. Id.\r\n\nHowever, we are not required to disregard the family court's findings and \"should\r\ngive great deference to [them] where matters of credibility are involved.\" Pirayesh\r\nv. Pirayesh, 359 S.C. 284, 292, 596 S.E.2d 505, 510 (Ct. App. 2004). This is\r\nespecially important when cases involve the welfare and best interests of the child.\r\nLatimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 380, 602 S.E.2d 32, 34 (2004).\r\n\r\n      IV.    Issues Raised By Ruff\r\n\r\n             1.     Custody\r\n\r\n\"In a custody dispute, the paramount and controlling factor is the welfare and best\r\ninterests of the child.\" Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 526, 599 S.E.2d 114, 119\r\n(2004) (quoting Matthews v. Matthews, 273 S.C. 130, 132, 254 S.E.2d 801, 802\r\n(1979)). When determining whether a change in custody is warranted, the analysis\r\ncenters on whether the transfer of custody is in the child's best interests. Latimer,\r\n360 S.C. at 381, 602 S.E.2d at 35. When a non-custodial parent seeks a change in\r\ncustody, that parent must establish: \"(1) there has been a substantial change in\r\ncircumstances affecting the welfare of the child and (2) a change in custody is in\r\nthe best interests of the child.\" Id. A change in circumstances justifying a change\r\nin custody means \"sufficient facts have been shown to warrant the conclusion that\r\nthe best interests of the child[] would be served by the change.\" Spreeuw v.\r\nBarker, 385 S.C. 45, 59, 682 S.E.2d 843, 850 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n\r\n\"A change in the custodial parent's residence is not in itself a substantial change in\r\ncircumstances affecting the welfare of the child[] that justifies a change in\r\ncustody.\" Walrath v. Pope, 384 S.C. 101, 105-06, 681 S.E.2d 602, 605 (Ct. App.\r\n2009); see also Latimer, 360 S.C. at 382, 602 S.E.2d at 35 (\"We decline to hold\r\nrelocation in itself is a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of\r\na child.\"). Relocation is only one factor to consider, and \"[i]t should not be\r\nassumed that merely relocating and potentially burdening the non-custodial\r\nparent's visitation rights always negatively affects the child's best interests.\"\r\nLatimer, 360 S.C. at 382, 602 S.E.2d at 35. In determining whether a child's best\r\ninterests are served by relocation, our supreme court has considered the following\r\nfactors: (1) the potential advantages of the relocation; (2) the likelihood the move\r\nwill improve the quality of life for the custodial parent and child; (3) the integrity\r\nof the motives of both parents in seeking the move or seeking to prevent it; and (4)\r\nthe availability of a realistic substitute visitation arrangement that will foster an\r\nongoing relationship between the non-custodial parent and child. Latimer, 360\r\nS.C. at 384-85, 602 S.E.2d at 36-37.\r\n\nWe find Nunez should continue to enjoy primary placement of Gabriel, despite his\r\nrelocation to New Jersey. Ruff asserts a substantial change in circumstances\r\naffecting Gabriel's welfare occurred when Nunez (1) went to New Jersey for two\r\nmonths in the spring of 2009, (2) left Gabriel in her care during that time without\r\nsupport, (3) failed to inform her where he was or when he would return to South\r\nCarolina, and (4) later informed her he wanted Gabriel to move to New Jersey with\r\nhim. However, Nunez contradicted many of these allegations at trial. He testified\r\nthat while in New Jersey, he contacted Ruff on a daily basis and gave her\r\ninformation regarding his whereabouts. He also testified he did not abandon\r\nGabriel without support because he continued to pay for daycare and medical\r\ninsurance for Gabriel.1 The court explicitly found Nunez's testimony \"regarding\r\nhis family support to be credible.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, pursuant to the factors considered in Latimer, the relocation to New Jersey is\r\nin Gabriel's best interests. Although the court did not delineate its consideration of\r\nthe Latimer factors in its order, by our own view of the preponderance of the\r\nevidence, we believe Gabriel's relocation to New Jersey is in his best interests.2\r\nFirst, as to the integrity of the parties' motives in seeking to move or challenge the\r\n\r\n1 The exhibit submitted by Nunez only showed he made payments to Gabriel's\r\ndaycare through April 2007, which is not relevant to whether Nunez made\r\npayments when he went to New Jersey during the spring of 2009. We believe this\r\nexhibit neither proves, nor disproves, that he did not make payments to the\r\ndaycare. There is evidence, however, that Nunez did allow Gabriel's medical\r\ninsurance to lapse during this two-month time period, but Nunez has since\r\nmaintained insurance for Gabriel. All this evidence was before the family court\r\nwhen it made its determination, and we believe the court appropriately weighed the\r\nevidence in making its custody decision.\r\n2 The Latimer court did not endorse or specifically approve one set of factors;\r\nrather, the court set forth the various factors used by New York and Pennsylvania\r\nstate courts. 360 S.C. at 382-83, 602 S.E.2d at 35-36; see also Walrath, 384 S.C.\r\nat 106, 681 S.E.2d at 605 (explaining our supreme court \"has acknowledged,\r\nwithout endorsing or specifically approving,\" factors that other states consider\r\nwhen making a relocation custody determination). Ruff asserts the court erred in\r\nnot enumerating the factors required to be considered in making a custody\r\ndetermination, but because our supreme court has not specifically approved a set of\r\nfactors, we find this argument unpersuasive.\r\n\nmove, we believe both parties' motives are legitimate. Nunez testified he moved to\r\nNew Jersey to attend college and ultimately become a teacher because he was laid\r\noff3 from his job in South Carolina. Thus, his motive is based on an intent to\r\nimprove his education and financial situation, which positively affects Gabriel's\r\nbest interests. As to Ruff's motives, we believe she opposed the move because she\r\nwas surprised by Nunez's decision to relocate, and she desired regular and\r\nmeaningful contact with Gabriel. Ruff testified she and Nunez agreed they \"would\r\nbe together . . . where it wouldn't make it impossible for [them] to . . . see [Gabriel]\r\nall the time regularly.\" Ruff stated Nunez told her in the middle of March 2009\r\nthat he was not planning to move to New Jersey, but at the end of March, he\r\ninformed her he intended to move to New Jersey and take Gabriel with him.\r\nAdditionally, the GAL testified she did not believe Ruff was trying to get back at\r\nNunez in any way by filing the action. Based on these facts, we believe both\r\nparties' motives are legitimate, so this factor does not affect either party negatively\r\nin the overall custody determination.\r\n\r\nSecond, the advantages to Gabriel of Nunez's relocation appear to weigh in\r\nNunez's favor. The family court found Nunez's relocation resulted in him being in\r\na better position to care for Gabriel. Nunez stated his work schedule at his\r\nprevious job was sixty hours per week, but now his work and school schedule\r\nallow him to be home when Gabriel gets home from school. Moreover, whenever\r\nhe has a scheduling conflict, Nunez's relatives are available to watch him. It also\r\nappears Nunez has substantial family ties in New Jersey because approximately\r\ntwenty-four of his relatives live within five miles of his home. While Ruff\r\ncontends the court ignored the fact that Gabriel also has close family members\r\nresiding in South Carolina, the existence of this fact does not mean the move was\r\nnot in Gabriel's best interest, and the court appropriately exercised its discretion in\r\nweighing the evidence presented on this issue. Additionally, Ruff testified Gabriel\r\nattends church with Nunez and was baptized at this church. Overall, we find this\r\nfactor weighs in Nunez's favor because (1) Nunez is employed and pursuing an\r\neducation that will increase his earning potential; (2) Nunez and Gabriel have a\r\nstrong support system and stable family environment in New Jersey; and (3) Nunez\r\n\r\n3 Although Nunez testified he was \"laid off,\" there is evidence in the record\r\nshowing he was terminated for cause. Ruff argues his dishonesty with the court on\r\nthis issue is one of many \"proven facts\" affecting the resolution of the custody\r\nissue because it is \"directly relevant to [Nunez]'s lack of responsibility and\r\ncredibility.\" We disagree and believe many of the facts she alleges as \"proven\"\r\nand \"crucial\" were in fact disputed and minimal in the overall determination.\r\n\nhas assumed the responsibility for Gabriel's moral upbringing by taking him to\r\nchurch each week.\r\n\r\nThird, we find Nunez's relocation will substantially improve his and Gabriel's\r\nquality of life. First, for the reasons stated above, we believe this factor favors\r\nNunez. Second, Ruff's use and possession of alcohol around Gabriel—in violation\r\nof the family court's order—weighs in Nunez's favor. Finally, Gabriel has a\r\ndifficult time adjusting to change because he suffers from ADHD and oppositional\r\ndefiance disorder (ODD). Because Gabriel is seeing a new therapist for his ODD\r\nin New Jersey, attending church and school there, and participating in\r\nextracurricular activities, we think it is in his best interests to remain in New\r\nJersey, where he has lived since September 2010.\r\n\r\nFinally, as to the availability of a realistic substitute visitation arrangement, the\r\nfamily court's order encourages both parties to work together to ensure each parent\r\nreceives reasonable visitation. The family court set forth a minimum visitation\r\nschedule, which gives Ruff physical placement during Gabriel's summer break, and\r\none weekend per month visitation coinciding with Gabriel's holiday schedule at\r\nschool. Additionally, the family court set a monthly and holiday visitation\r\nschedule and ordered the parent with physical placement to provide at least one\r\ncall per week to the parent without physical placement. The court noted that\r\nbecause \"electronic communication . . . has been a challenge for [the parents],\" the\r\nparties were encouraged to \"use other forms of communications to allow the party\r\nwho does not have physical placement . . . to enjoy a close and loving relationship\r\nwith [Gabriel] while they are apart.\" Although Ruff contends Nunez's relocation to\r\nNew Jersey makes their agreement regarding visitation unworkable, it appears Ruff\r\nhas the opportunity to maintain a close relationship with Gabriel through visitation,\r\ntelephone contact, and other forms of communication. Therefore, we find this\r\nfactor favors Nunez.\r\n\r\nBased on the above analysis, we find Gabriel's relocation to New Jersey is in his\r\nbest interests. Ruff argues, however, that the court ignored testimony and evidence\r\nthat was favorable to her and decisive on the issue of custody. First, she claims the\r\ncourt failed to consider the GAL's testimony and report as it relates to custody.\r\n\"The role of the guardian ad litem in making custody recommendations is to aid,\r\nnot direct, the court. Ultimately, the custody decision lies with the trial judge.\"\r\nShirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 339, 536 S.E.2d 427, 435 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nAlthough the GAL's report contradicted some of Nunez's testimony, it ultimately\r\nfound both parents equally suitable to care for Gabriel, which is not inconsistent\r\nwith the court's decision to allow Gabriel to remain in Nunez's custody. Also, we\r\n\ndisagree that the court \"ignored\" the GAL's testimony because the order stated the\r\nruling was based on \"the testimony of the parties and their witnesses, and . . . the\r\nevidence submitted at trial.\" We believe the court gave proper weight and\r\nconsideration to the recommendation when determining the custody issue.\r\n\r\nSecond, Ruff claims the court ignored evidence that allegedly showed Nunez\r\nexhibited financial and moral irresponsibility, violated two court orders regarding\r\nGabriel's medication, and falsely represented certain facts to the court. Once again,\r\nwe disagree that the court ignored evidence that was before it when it made its\r\ndetermination. Also, because we lack the opportunity to directly observe the\r\nwitnesses, we \"should give great deference to the family court's findings where\r\nmatters of credibility are involved.\" Pirayesh, 359 S.C. at 292, 596 S.E.2d at 510.\r\nConsidering Ruff's own misconduct that is highlighted in the court's order—her\r\ntwo violations of the temporary order's restrictions regarding alcohol, her loss of\r\ncustody due to these violations, the finding that her conduct throughout litigation\r\nwas \"self-serving and for the purpose of gaining an advantage in the [custody]\r\naction,\" and the finding that her behavior increased the cost of litigation—we find\r\nthe court properly weighed the evidence and correctly decided the custody issue.\r\n\r\nWe also disagree with Ruff's contention that the family court did not make specific\r\nfindings regarding Gabriel's best interests and the parties' character, fitness, and\r\nattitude as they impact Gabriel. See High v. High, 389 S.C. 226, 244-45, 697\r\nS.E.2d 690, 699 (Ct. App. 2010) (stating in making a custody determination, \"the\r\nfamily court should consider the character, fitness, attitude, and inclinations on the\r\npart of each parent as they impact the children\"). The order contains clear\r\ncredibility and fitness determinations regarding both parties. In fact, the order\r\ndedicates three and a half pages to explaining why it should not grant custody to\r\nRuff, even if she proved a substantial change in circumstances.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are inclined to agree that there is no evidence in the record to support\r\nthe family court's finding that Ruff was uncooperative in scheduling visitation\r\nwhile Nunez was in New Jersey. The GAL's report provided \"[Ruff] has\r\ncooperated with [Nunez]'s visitation in New Jersey,\" and Nunez did not testify to\r\nthe contrary. Thus, the only evidence in the record on this point contradicts the\r\nfinding that Ruff was uncooperative. Although we find there is no evidence in the\r\nrecord to support this finding, and thus cannot affirm it, we do not believe it\r\nchanges the overall determination as it relates to custody.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing discussion, we affirm the family court's refusal to grant a\r\nchange in custody because we find Ruff failed to show (1) there was a substantial\r\n\nchange in circumstances affecting Gabriel's welfare, and (2) a change in custody\r\nwould be in Gabriel's overall best interests.\r\n\r\n             2.     Alcohol Restrictions\r\n\r\nRuff contends the court erred in continuing to enjoin her from possessing or using\r\nalcohol in Gabriel's presence because Nunez presented no evidence proving the\r\nrestriction is warranted. In the alternative, Ruff contends both parties should be\r\nsubject to a restriction that only limits excessive consumption of alcohol.\r\n\r\nWe recommend affirming the family court's decision to continue the alcohol-\r\nrelated restrictions. The restrictions are strong but reasonable in light of the history\r\nof this case and the evidence presented. At the temporary hearing, Nunez told the\r\ncourt Ruff played drinking games with friends while Gabriel was present. This\r\nevidence caused the court to restrain Ruff from consuming or keeping alcohol in\r\nher home while Gabriel was in her physical custody. However, the court later\r\nfound Ruff in contempt for violating this order twice, once for consuming alcohol\r\nand once when the GAL conducted an unannounced home visit and found beer in\r\nRuff's garage refrigerator. At trial, a private investigator testified he observed Ruff\r\nconsuming alcoholic beverages while Gabriel was in her care and then driving\r\nafter drinking with Gabriel in her automobile on several occasions. Given Ruff's\r\npast violations of the temporary order and the evidence presented, we find the\r\ncontinuing alcohol restriction is reasonable and appropriate.\r\n\r\nAs to her argument that both parties should be restricted from excessive alcohol\r\nconsumption, the record does not support such a request. Ruff's counsel even\r\nconceded at the temporary hearing that Nunez does not have a \"drinking problem.\"\r\nIn family court, a party seeking a restraining order \"must show such facts and\r\ncircumstances\" proving it is warranted. Calcutt v. Calcutt, 282 S.C. 565, 572, 320\r\nS.E.2d 55, 59 (Ct. App. 1984). Because Ruff presented no evidence that a\r\nrestraining order against Nunez is necessary, we deny her request because it would\r\nimpose an unwarranted restraint upon him.\r\n\r\n             3.     Visitation\r\n\r\nRuff argues the family court erred in setting the visitation schedule because the\r\nprovisions are unfair to her and unsupported by the evidence. Specifically, she\r\ncontends (1) her Christmas visitation is unfair because she will never get to spend\r\nChristmas Eve or Christmas Day with Gabriel; (2) it is unfair that if Easter falls\r\nduring spring break, Ruff's spring break visitation is shortened by at least three\r\n\ndays because Gabriel must return to New Jersey for Easter; and (3) any holiday\r\nvisitation time should be in addition to her one weekend per month.\r\n\r\n\"When awarding visitation, the controlling consideration is the welfare and best\r\ninterest of the child.\" Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158\r\n(1996). Although we find the majority of the family court's order concerning\r\nvisitation to be in Gabriel's best interests, we believe the days included in Ruff's\r\nChristmas visitation should be modified. Currently, the final order only provides\r\nRuff with Christmas visitation during odd-numbered years, which begins\r\nDecember 26. This schedule does not permit Ruff to ever enjoy visitation over\r\nChristmas Eve and Christmas Day. The order did not state why visitation should\r\nnot include these days, and Nunez puts forth no argument on this point. We think\r\nit would be in Gabriel's best interests if Ruff's Christmas visitation during odd-\r\nnumbered years included Christmas Eve and Christmas Day because Gabriel\r\nshares a loving relationship with both parents. Accordingly, we modify the order\r\nso that Ruff's Christmas visitation begins December 23.\r\n\r\nRegarding Easter and spring break visitation, we disagree that Ruff's spring break\r\nvisitation should be shortened when it coincides with Easter. The family court\r\ngave Nunez visitation for Easter and gave Ruff visitation during Gabriel's spring\r\nbreak. However, during school years where Easter occurs during Gabriel's spring\r\nbreak, the order shortens Ruff's spring break visitation by at least three days so\r\nGabriel is with Nunez for Easter. Although we acknowledge Easter is a religious\r\nholiday and Gabriel attends church with Nunez in New Jersey, it is important for\r\nRuff to receive the full amount of visitation allotted to her and to also have the\r\nopportunity to celebrate Easter with Gabriel. Accordingly, we modify the court's\r\norder so that when Easter coincides with Gabriel's spring break, Ruff's visitation\r\nincludes Easter.\r\n\r\nRuff's remaining argument is that she should essentially get two visitations per\r\nmonth during the months she has holiday visitation. However, we believe the\r\nfamily court properly took into account Gabriel's best interests when limiting\r\nvisitation. Requiring Gabriel to travel back and forth from New Jersey, as an\r\nunaccompanied minor, multiple times in one month may put too much strain on\r\nhim and adversely impact his education and involvement in extracurricular\r\nactivities. Moreover, the family court made additional provisions for alternate\r\nforms of visitation, i.e., telephone contact. Therefore, we affirm this finding.\r\n\n             4.    Transportation Costs\r\n\r\nRuff contends requiring her to pay \"all transportation costs\" is unfair because\r\nNunez is the party who moved away and made the costs necessary. She argues\r\nthat if she must pay transportation costs, she should be allowed to use the most\r\neconomical means of transporting Gabriel.\r\n\r\nWe find the family court correctly determined this issue. Initially, we note Ruff\r\nmischaracterizes the family court's order because she contends it is unfair for her to\r\nbe responsible for paying all travel costs. However, the court ordered Ruff to pay\r\nonly the travel costs associated with her own visitation; Nunez remains responsible\r\nfor his visitation costs during the summer, when Ruff has primary custody of\r\nGabriel. Second, the family court set forth which airports each parent is required\r\nto fly Gabriel into and out of because it found \"visitation has been an ongoing\r\nirritant between the parties during the pendency of this action.\" The order only\r\nindicates which airports each parent must use and does not prohibit Ruff from\r\nusing discounts or certain airlines. Thus, she may still use the most economical\r\nmeans of transporting Gabriel, provided she flies him into and out of Newark\r\nLiberty International Airport. For these reasons, we disagree with Ruff's argument\r\non this issue and affirm the family court's ruling.\r\n\r\n             5.    Unemployment Benefits or Employment\r\n\r\nThe court found Ruff's \"unemployment benefits shall begin or [she] will have\r\nemployment by the end of January 2011,\" which gave Ruff approximately twenty-\r\nfive days to secure either employment or unemployment benefits. Ruff contends\r\nthis finding is unsupported by the evidence because no party presented evidence\r\nconcerning the probability of either happening within the family court's timeline.\r\nShe also argues it is unfair because she has no control over either option.\r\n\r\nWe find the record supports the court's finding. Ruff testified she worked all of\r\nGabriel's life; she had never been fired from a job; she was unemployed at the time\r\nof trial because the company she worked for closed its office; and she was\r\ncurrently looking for employment. Ruff also told the court she had been receiving\r\nunemployment benefits shortly before trial but was not currently receiving them\r\nbecause she had to re-file her paperwork. However, she stated she intended to do\r\nso after the trial concluded. Ruff's own testimony indicates it is reasonable for the\r\ncourt to expect her to either secure employment or unemployment benefits by\r\nJanuary 31, 2011. Accordingly, we affirm the family court's finding.\r\n\n             6.     Child Support\r\n\r\nAs to the finding that Ruff should pay $475.00 per month in child support, Ruff\r\nargues the court erred when it (1) imputed income to her at the amount she was\r\npaid before she became unemployed, (2) set the amount of child support, and (3)\r\nfound she has been unemployed but has maintained the same level of income.\r\n\r\nAs to the first issue, \"[i]f the court finds that a parent is voluntarily unemployed or\r\nunderemployed, it should calculate child support based on a determination of\r\npotential income which would otherwise ordinarily be available to the parent.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5) (2012); see also Patel, 359 S.C. at 532, 599\r\nS.E.2d at 123 (\"It is proper to impute income to a party who is voluntarily\r\nunemployed or underemployed.\"). In calculating the amount of income to impute,\r\n\"the court should determine the employment potential and probable earnings level\r\nof the parent based on that parent's recent work history, occupational\r\nqualifications, and prevailing job opportunities and earning levels in the\r\ncommunity.\" Regs. 114-4720(A)(5)(B); see also Sanderson v. Sanderson, 391\r\nS.C. 249, 256, 705 S.E.2d 65, 68 (Ct. App. 2010).\r\n\r\nRuff does not contend the court erred in imputing income to her but only that it\r\nimputed the incorrect amount; thus, we need not analyze whether the court's\r\ndecision to impute income was proper. As to the amount of income imputed to\r\nher, the court made the following findings when it ruled:\r\n\r\n             The Court finds that [Ruff] is able[-]bodied and capable\r\n             of earning a living equal to her income prior to the\r\n             beginning of this action. The Court finds that she has\r\n             been employed almost the entire time litigation was\r\n             pending and her income was relatively consistent, except\r\n             for a short period of time prior to the trial of this case.\r\n             Therefore, the Court finds it appropriate to impute\r\n             income consistent with the income [she] enjoyed prior to\r\n             losing her job. In finding that [Ruff] should have income\r\n             imputed to her, this Court notes that [Ruff] changed jobs\r\n             at least once during the pendency of this action with less\r\n             than thirty (30) days in between positions. The Court\r\n             further finds that without the litigation time constraint,\r\n             and with [Gabriel] residing with [Nunez], [Ruff] should\r\n             be able to obtain employment.\r\n\nFrom its ruling, it appears the court took into consideration her employment\r\npotential and probable earning level based on her recent work history. Although\r\nRuff was unemployed at the time of the hearing, she testified: (1) she had worked\r\nall of Gabriel's life; (2) she had been employed the last four and a half years; (3)\r\nshe was unemployed at the time of trial because she was laid off; (4) she was\r\ncurrently capable of working; and (5) she was looking for a job. We believe this\r\nevidence supports the finding that Ruff is capable of working at the income level\r\nshe enjoyed over the past four and a half years.\r\n\r\nAs to Ruff's argument that the court erred in setting the child support amount, she\r\ncontends the family court simply echoed the income stated in the prior order\r\nbecause her financial declaration showed she could no longer pay child support.\r\nBecause we find the court correctly imputed to Ruff the same income she\r\npreviously made, we further find the court correctly based the amount of child\r\nsupport on this income.\r\n\r\n             7.    Retroactive Child Support\r\n\r\nThe family court's order required Ruff to pay retroactive child support for a total of\r\nsix months under the terms of the temporary order. The temporary order issued in\r\n2009 (1) gave Ruff primary placement during the 2009-2010 school-year and child\r\nsupport in the amount of $340 per month, and (2) gave Nunez primary placement\r\nduring June and July of 2009, with $475 per month in child support for those\r\nmonths. Ruff paid child support for June and July of 2009 but did not pay in 2010.\r\nRuff claimed she tried to pay child support in 2010, but the court would not accept\r\nher payment because the language of the temporary order only required Ruff to pay\r\nfor June and July of 2009. The family court ordered her to pay child support for\r\nthose two months and also ordered her to pay child support for the fall of 2010\r\nwhen Nunez had temporary custody due to Ruff's loss of custody in September\r\n2010.\r\n\r\nRuff contends the temporary order issued in 2009 only contemplated payments for\r\nJune and July of 2009, not 2010, so she should not have to pay retroactive child\r\nsupport for those months. Moreover, she argues the court did not order support for\r\nGabriel during the fall of 2010 when it removed Gabriel from Ruff's custody; thus,\r\nRuff should not have to pay retroactive support for those four months. We\r\nacknowledge the temporary order only required Ruff to pay child support for the\r\nsummer of 2009, and the order removing Gabriel from Ruff's custody did not\r\naddress the issue of child support. However, the family court's power to award\r\nretroactive child support depends on the facts and circumstances of each case,\r\n\nSutton v. Sutton, 291 S.C. 401, 408, 353 S.E.2d 884, 888 (Ct. App. 1987), and we\r\nbelieve the facts of this case warrant such an award. Nunez claims that because the\r\ndocket was back-logged, he had custody of Gabriel during the summer of 2010.\r\nThus, equity requires the temporary order's child support requirements to continue\r\nfor that summer, notwithstanding the fact that the order only contemplated\r\npayment for one summer. And for the same reasons, the parties should have\r\ncontinued to pay child support during the following school year as well, meaning\r\nNunez would have owed Ruff child support for the 2010 school year. However,\r\nRuff lost custody of Gabriel due to her willful contempt of court, so it became\r\nRuff's responsibility to pay child support. For these reasons, the court correctly\r\nfound Ruff owed child support for the summer and fall of 2010.\r\n\r\nRuff also argues that because the court did not order Nunez to pay retroactive\r\nsupport when he went to New Jersey for two months in March 2009 and left her\r\nwithout support, any back child support due from her should be offset against any\r\nsupport Nunez should have paid to Ruff during that time. When Nunez went to\r\nNew Jersey in 2009, however, the support agreement in effect at the time did not\r\nprovide for any child support payments. Because child support payments were not\r\ncontemplated by the parties at that time, we deny Ruff's request to offset her\r\nretroactive child support.\r\n\r\nAs to Ruff's remaining arguments on this issue, we find they are not preserved for\r\nour appellate review because Ruff did not argue them to the family court or in her\r\nRule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend. See Marchant v. Marchant, 390\r\nS.C. 1, 7, 699 S.E.2d 708, 711 (Ct. App. 2010) (\"A point not raised to and ruled\r\nupon by the family court will not be considered on appeal.\").\r\n\r\n            8.     Uncovered Medical Expenses\r\n\r\nThe family court ordered the parties to divide all of Gabriel's uncovered medical\r\nexpenses evenly. Ruff contends the family court failed to follow the law of South\r\nCarolina in ordering her to pay half of the uninsured medical bills, but she did not\r\nspecify which law the family court failed to follow and cites no authority to\r\nsupport her argument. We find Ruff abandoned this argument on appeal. See Judy\r\nv. Judy, 384 S.C. 634, 644, 682 S.E.2d 836, 841 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding appellant\r\nabandoned issue on appeal because no legal authority cited to support argument).\r\n\n             9.    Outstanding Medical Bills\r\n\r\nAt the time of trial, the court found there were outstanding medical expenses\r\ntotaling $190. Additionally, the court found Ruff had previously paid $143 in\r\noutstanding medical bills, while Nunez had paid only $95. After concluding that\r\n\"medical bill reimbursements have been a substantial problem in this case\" and that\r\nNunez offered credible testimony regarding the payments of medical expenses and\r\nreimbursements, the court ordered Nunez to reimburse Ruff $48 within ninety days\r\nof the order.\r\n\r\nRuff argues the findings stated above are unsupported by evidence in the record.\r\nAlthough Ruff appeals this issue, Ruff's entire argument on this point consists of\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n             As to the outstanding medical bills, there was no\r\n             testimony or evidence as to the exact amount owed by\r\n             one party to the other, except that [Ruff] testified that the\r\n             amount is \"less than three hundred dollars.\" This finding\r\n             by the Court is simply not supported by any evidence of\r\n             record whatsoever.\r\n\r\nRuff only argues the finding is not supported by the evidence and does not assert\r\nshe is owed more than $48 or request we remand the issue to the family court. If\r\nwe were to agree with her argument, we would vacate the award due to the lack of\r\nevidence supporting the findings. However, in light of the fact that (1) Ruff is the\r\nparty appealing this issue; (2) the record contains evidence that there were\r\nproblems with Nunez reimbursing Ruff for medical expenses; (3) Ruff testified she\r\nwas owed \"less than three hundred dollars;\" (4) the court made detailed findings of\r\nmedical expenses, with the figures including cent values, and (5) the court\r\nexplicitly stated it made these findings \"after reviewing the exhibits\" and testimony\r\npresented at trial, we believe the evidence, exhibits, and testimony—in the totality\r\nof what the court considered—is sufficient to affirm the court's ruling on this issue.\r\nThus, we affirm the award.\r\n\r\n             10.   Telephone Contact\r\n\r\nThe order set a phone schedule that required the party with physical placement to\r\nprovide a minimum of one call per week from Gabriel to the party without physical\r\nplacement. Ruff argues \"the telephone contact allowed—one telephone call per\r\nweek—is so restrictive . . . and so unfair\" that it is meaningless. Moreover, she\r\n\ncontends the one call per week schedule will only serve to limit her contact with\r\nGabriel, \"as it has been proven during the course of this litigation that [Nunez] will\r\nnot cooperate in allowing even Court-ordered telephone and Skype visitation,\r\nmuch less allow extra 'agreed-upon' visitation.\"\r\n\r\nInitially, we note Ruff mischaracterizes the court's order. The one call per week is\r\nmerely a minimum of what the party with physical placement must provide to the\r\nother party. In fact, the order (1) encourages \"free and reasonable telephone\r\naccess\" for the party without physical placement, (2) promotes the use of \"other\r\nforms of communication\" so that the party may \"enjoy a close and loving\r\nrelationship with [Gabriel] while they are apart,\" and (3) requires both parties to\r\nmake reasonable arrangements to allow Gabriel to talk \"on a more frequent basis\r\nas\" the parties' schedules allow. We find phone schedule reasonable and affirm.\r\n\r\n             11.   Medical Decisions\r\n\r\nRuff argues the finding that Nunez shall make all medical decisions related to\r\nGabriel is against the greater weight of the evidence and could prove \"disastrous\"\r\nfor Gabriel. In support for her argument, she contends Nunez took Gabriel off his\r\nADHD medication in violation of two court orders; he did not appear at either\r\ncontempt hearing regarding this violation; and he exhibited denial of Gabriel's\r\ndiagnosis. Moreover, she asserts the court did not consider (1) her own testimony\r\nand the GAL's testimony that showed it was Ruff who took appropriate care of\r\nGabriel's medical and therapy needs, and (2) testimony that showed Gabriel's\r\nbehavior improved while in her custody but regressed while in Nunez's custody.\r\n\r\nWe believe allowing Nunez to make all medical decisions is in Gabriel's best\r\ninterest because it provides a clear chain of command regarding Gabriel's medical\r\nneeds. Moreover, we are not persuaded that this will prove \"disastrous\" for\r\nGabriel. The record shows Nunez was uncertain Gabriel needed to be treated with\r\nmedication, so he had Gabriel reevaluated, which required him to be taken off his\r\nmedications. Once a physician recommended the medication be maintained,\r\nNunez followed the doctor's recommendations. Nunez testified he has informed\r\nhimself about the disorder and the effects of the medications, as well as researched\r\nother non-medicinal techniques for dealing with the disorder. Based on this\r\nevidence, the court determined Nunez's decisions regarding Gabriel's ADHD\r\nmedications were reasonable because he \"exhibited sincere concern\" and has \"gone\r\nto extraordinary lengths\" to assure Gabriel received appropriate medical care. We\r\naffirm the court's ruling because the facts were in dispute and the court was in the\r\n\nbest position to determine the credibility of the witnesses and weigh the evidence\r\npresented by the parties.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Ruff contends the family court erred in not addressing Gabriel's\r\nADHD and ODD. She argues that despite the GAL's conclusion that Gabriel's\r\nADHD medications and ODD counseling must be addressed in the final order, the\r\norder failed to make findings and conclusions as to this issue. We do not believe,\r\nhowever, that the family court was in any position to assume the role of a\r\nphysician and give directives as it relates to Gabriel's medical treatment. The court\r\ndetermined Nunez's actions relating to Gabriel's medical treatment were reasonable\r\nand granted him the authority to make all the decisions regarding his medical\r\ntreatment in the future. We believe this sufficiently \"address[ed] Gabriel's\r\ndiagnosed ADHD and ODD.\"\r\n\r\n             12.   Guardian Ad Litem's Fee\r\n\r\nRuff argues the court's finding that she should be required to pay the entire GAL's\r\nfee is not supported by the evidence presented at trial. \"An award of guardian ad\r\nlitem fees lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be\r\ndisturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\" Shirley, 342 S.C. at 341, 536\r\nS.E.2d at 436. The same equitable considerations that apply to attorney's fees also\r\napply to GAL's fees. Garris v. McDuffie, 288 S.C. 637, 644, 344 S.E.2d 186, 191\r\n(Ct. App. 1986). A family court must first consider the following factors in\r\ndetermining whether to award GAL's fees: \"(1) each party's ability to pay his or her\r\nown fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the parties'\r\nrespective financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the fee on each party's\r\nstandard of living.\" Farmer v. Farmer, 388 S.C. 50, 57, 694 S.E.2d 47, 51 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2010). After deciding to award GAL's fees, a family court must then\r\nconsider the following factors in deciding how much to award: \"(1) the nature,\r\nextent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3)\r\nprofessional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial\r\nresults obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn requiring Ruff to pay the GAL's fee in full, which amounted to approximately\r\n$10,000, the court stated:\r\n\r\n             The Court finds that the length of time this matter was\r\n             pending is a direct result of [Ruff]'s actions. The court\r\n             finds that [Ruff] was unsuccessful in her action as it\r\n             relates to a substantial change of circumstance and the\r\n\n             Court finds that [her] behavior resulted in a substantial\r\n             balance due to the Guardian ad Litem. This Court finds\r\n             that [Ruff] should pay the Guardian's Fees in full. [R]uff\r\n             shall be responsible for the outstanding balance of $7,864\r\n             due to the Guardian. [R]uff shall reimburse [Nunez]\r\n             $2,256 for the payments he has made to the Guardian.\r\n\r\n             ...\r\n\r\n             In considering the allocation of the Guardian Fees, the\r\n             Court will note that it is not awarding attorney fees and\r\n             costs to either party. The Court finds that while [Nunez]\r\n             was the prevailing party, and acted reasonably during the\r\n             course of this litigation, and had [Ruff] conducted herself\r\n             similarly, neither party would have the substantial\r\n             attorney fees and costs or the substantial Guardian fees\r\n             set forth above.\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge the court did not delineate its consideration of the factors in\r\nordering Ruff to pay the GAL's fees. However, an appellate court may, \"where the\r\nrecord is sufficient, make its own findings of fact in accordance with the\r\npreponderance of the evidence.\" Thomson v. Thomson, 377 S.C. 613, 623, 661\r\nS.E.2d 130, 135 (Ct. App. 2008) (citation omitted); see also Farmer, 388 S.C. at\r\n57-58, 694 S.E.2d at 51 (affirming an award of attorney's fees based on its own\r\nfindings of fact because the family court did not explicitly consider all the factors\r\nin making the award). In doing so, we are not required to disregard the findings of\r\nthe family court, particularly those relating to credibility. See Pirayesh, 359 S.C.\r\nat 292, 596 S.E.2d at 510.\r\n\r\nGiving deference to the family court's findings and credibility determinations, we\r\naffirm the decision. The order provided many examples of how Ruff's behavior\r\ncaused the GAL's fee to be substantial, including (1) Ruff's violations of the\r\ntemporary order, which caused her to lose custody of Gabriel, (2) the finding that\r\nRuff's actions relating to Gabriel were \"self-serving and for the purpose of gaining\r\nan advantage\" in the custody action, (3) the finding that Ruff used the issue of\r\nmedication to discredit Nunez and \"sway the Guardian to support her action,\" (4)\r\nthe finding that Ruff refused to allow visitation during the pendency of the action,\r\n(5) the finding that Ruff \"chose to interpret the Order to her advantage rather than\r\nmaking decisions that would be in the child's best interest,\" (6) the finding that she\r\nhas not cooperated in having prescriptions filled and paying medical bills, and (7)\r\n\nthe finding that \"she has frustrated [Nunez]'s attempts to seek second opinions and\r\nadvice from medical professionals.\" Additionally, the court awarded only the\r\nGAL's fee and did not award attorney's fees or additional costs.

McIntosh, Senior Assistant\r\n        Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant\r\n        Attorney General Mark Reynolds Farthing, all of\r\n        Columbia; and Solicitor W. Walter Wilkins, III, of\r\n        Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: In this criminal appeal, James Moore contends the trial court\r\nerred in failing to charge the jury with his requested reasonable doubt definition.\r\nHe maintains the trial court's jury charge diluted the jury's burden and resulted in a\r\nviolation of his right to due process. Moore specifically objects to the trial court's\r\nfollowing statements: \"There are few things in this world that we know with\r\nabsolute certainty. And in criminal cases our law does not require proof that\r\novercomes every possible doubt.\" We affirm.\r\n\r\nFirst, we note a trial court is not prohibited from, nor required to, define reasonable\r\ndoubt. Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1, 5 (1994). Our supreme court has\r\nreinforced this position, finding a defendant's argument that a trial court erred by\r\nrefusing to define reasonable doubt altogether over the defendant's requested\r\ncharge from State v. Manning, 305 S.C. 413, 409 S.E.2d 372 (1991), was\r\nmanifestly without merit. State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 126, 470 S.E.2d 366, 373\r\n(1996); see also Manning, 305 S.C. at 417, 409 S.E.2d at 375 (suggesting the trial\r\ncourt give no further definition for reasonable doubt than \"[a] reasonable doubt is\r\nthe kind of doubt that would cause a reasonable person to hesitate to act\"),\r\noverruled on other grounds by State v. Aleksey, 393 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248\r\n(2000).\r\n\r\nWhen a trial court chooses to define reasonable doubt, our supreme court has\r\nexplicitly identified two appropriate definitions and stated trial courts should rarely\r\nfind it necessary to deviate from those approved charges. State v. Needs, 333 S.C.\r\n134, 155-56, 508 S.E.2d 857, 868 (1998), modified on other grounds by State v.\r\nCherry, 361 S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d 475 (2004). The first option for a reasonable\r\ndoubt charge provides: \"'A reasonable doubt is the kind of doubt that would cause\r\na reasonable person to hesitate to act.'\" Id. at 155 n.12, 508 S.E.2d at 868 n.12\r\n(quoting Manning, 305 S.C. at 417, 409 S.E.2d at 375). The trial court also may\r\nuse the following charge or combine it with the Manning charge:\r\n\r\n             The State has the burden of proving the Defendant guilty\r\n             beyond a reasonable doubt. Some of you may have\r\n             served as jurors in civil cases where you were told that\r\n             [it] is only necessary to prove the fact is more likely true\r\n             than not, such as by the greater weight or preponderance\r\n             of the evidence. In criminal cases, the State's proof must\r\n             be more powerful than that. It must be beyond a\r\n             reasonable doubt.\r\n\n             Ladies and gentlemen, proof beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n             is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the\r\n             Defendant's guilt. There are very few things in this\r\n             world that we know with absolute certainty. And in\r\n             criminal cases, the law does not require proof that\r\n             overcomes every possible doubt. The law doesn't\r\n             require that.\r\n\r\n             If, based on your consideration of the evidence, you are\r\n             firmly convinced that the Defendant is guilty of the crime\r\n             charged, you must find him guilty. You must find him\r\n             guilty. If on the other hand you think there is a real\r\n             possibility that he is not guilty, you must give him the\r\n             benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added) (quoting State v. Darby, 324 S.C. 114, 115-16, 477 S.E.2d\r\n710, 710-11 (1996) (endorsing the definition of reasonable doubt developed by the\r\nFederal Judicial Center and cited with approval in Justice Ginsberg's concurring\r\nopinion in Victor v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. Husted first argues he should have been granted a directed verdict because the\r\nState failed to prove there was probable cause for the arrest that formed the basis of\r\nthe charge against him. He contends the evidence at best, showed only that the\r\nofficers were conducting an investigative stop. The evidence, however, when\r\nconsidered in the light most favorable to the State, was sufficient to support the\r\nfindings that (1) the officers had probable cause to arrest Husted, (2) they were in\r\nthe process of arresting Husted on the underlying offense, and (3) Husted's acts of\r\nresistance were directed toward both the officers' efforts to detain him as well as\r\ntheir attempt to arrest him.\r\n\r\nIn his brief, Husted correctly points out that when the officers first approached\r\nhim, they were only investigating the incident that prompted the call to the\r\nCharleston Police Department. However, we disagree with Husted's statement that\r\nhis \"pre-restraint conduct\" was \"merely walking pas[t] the officers and not\r\nresponding to their commands.\" The State presented testimony that when the\r\nofficers arrived at the scene, they were informed that bystanders had seen \"two\r\nwhite males that were possibly involved in the altercation run into the woods\" and\r\n\"[b]oth of them had blood on them.\" The officers went to the wooded area, where\r\nthey met Husted and the other man and noticed both men were highly intoxicated\r\nand covered in blood. These observations, along with the information the officers\r\nreceived upon their arrival, justified the officers' decision to detain Husted and\r\ntheir exercise of reasonable force in doing so. See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S.\r\n386, 396 (1989) (\"Our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized that\r\nthe right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily carries with it the right\r\nto use some degree of physical coercion or threat thereof to effect it.\"); State v.\r\nBurton, 349 S.C. 430, 438, 562 S.E.2d 668, 671 (Ct. App. 2002) (indicating that\r\neven without probable cause, a police officer may elevate an encounter with a\r\ncitizen into an investigatory stop or detention if the officer has a reasonable\r\nsuspicion of criminal activity supported by articulable facts), rev'd on other\r\ngrounds, 356 S.C. 259, 589 S.E.2d 6 (2003). One of the officers testified that\r\nwhen Husted attempted to run away, she grabbed one of his arms in an attempt to\r\nrestrict his movement, at which time Husted became combative; therefore,\r\nevidence was presented that the officers witnessed Husted behaving in a disorderly\r\nmanner, as apparent from his public intoxication and belligerent refusal to\r\ncooperate with their investigation. See S.C. Code Ann. § 16-17-530 (2003)\r\n\n(stating that any person found \"at any public place . . . in a grossly intoxicated\r\ncondition or otherwise conducting himself in a disorderly or boisterous manner\"\r\n\"shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor\").1 Unlike the defendant in State v.\r\nBrannon, 388 S.C. 498, 697 S.E.2d 593 (2010), which Husted cites in support of\r\nhis position, Husted was not merely attempting to evade an attempt by the police to\r\ndetain him for questioning. Rather, his intoxication and his unruly behavior\r\ntoward the officers when they tried to prevent him from leaving the scene justified\r\nthe officers' subsequent attempt to handcuff him and place him under arrest. After\r\nHusted was partially handcuffed, he swung his cuffed arm in an aggressive\r\nmanner, exposing the attending officer to injury from the unattached cuff. This\r\nsubsequent attempt to injure the officer was evidence that Husted willfully resisted\r\nthe arrest.\r\n\r\n2. Husted next argues the trial court erred in failing to include in its jury\r\ninstructions a definition of a lawful arrest and a charge that a lawful arrest is a\r\nnecessary element of resisting arrest. We find no error.\r\n\r\nWe note first section 16-9-320 of the South Carolina Code (2003), the statute\r\nunder which Husted was charged, no longer expressly requires a showing that the\r\ndefendant resisted a \"lawful arrest.\"2 See Brannon, 388 S.C. at 504, 697 S.E.2d at\r\n\r\n\r\n1Husted did not argue at trial or on appeal that the events leading to his arrest did\r\nnot occur in a public place.\r\n2In 1980, when section 16-9-320 was added to Chapter 9 of Title 16 of the South\r\nCarolina Code, it read in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n             Section 16-9-320. Any person who knowingly and\r\n             wilfully[sic]:\r\n\r\n             (a) Opposes or resists any law enforcement officer in\r\n             serving, executing or attempting to serve or execute any\r\n             legal writ or process or who resists any lawful arrest,\r\n             whether under process or not, shall be deemed guilty of a\r\n             misdemeanor . . . .\r\n\r\n             (b) Assaults, beats or wounds any law enforcement\r\n             officer engaged in serving, executing or attempting to\r\n\n597 (declining to determine whether police officers intended to arrest the defendant\r\nbased on objective inquiry as to whether they had probable cause and stating that\r\n\"[u]nder the plain language of section 16-9-320(A), we are only focused on\r\ndetermining whether an arrest was being made at the time of Brannon's flight\").\r\n\r\nTo the extent, however, that such a showing was necessary here,3 we hold the jury\r\ncharge imparted this information to the jury by including instructions that (1) the\r\nState had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Husted \"knowingly and willfully\r\nresisted a lawful arrest,\" (2) \"[a] citizen is not required to submit to an illegal\r\narrest,\" and (3) \"a person who flees a police officer's demand to stop is not\r\ncommitting resisting arrest.\" See State v. Stone, 285 S.C. 386, 387, 330 S.E.2d\r\n286, 287 (1985) (stating the South Carolina Constitution requires a trial judge to\r\n\"'explain so much of the criminal law as is applicable to the issues made by the\r\nevidence adduced at trial'\") (quoting State v. White, 211 S.C. 276, 281-82, 44\r\nS.E.2d 741, 743 (1947) (abrogation recognized by State v. Salisbury, 343 S.C. 520,\r\n523, 541 S.E.2d 247, 248 (2001)); State v. Gibson, 390 S.C. 347, 356, 701 S.E.2d\r\n766, 770-71 (Ct. App. 2010) (\"In order to amount to reversible error, the failure to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             serve or execute any legal writ or process or who\r\n             assaults, beats or wounds such officer where such person\r\n             is resisting any lawful arrest, whether under process or\r\n             not, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\r\n\r\n1980 S.C. Acts 511.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, this statute was amended to change the phrase \"lawful arrest\" in both\r\nparagraphs to \"arrest.\" The amended version included in both paragraphs a\r\nrequirement that the arrest be \"made by one whom the person knows or reasonably\r\nshould know is a law enforcement officer.\" 1990 S.C. Acts 598. In contrast, the\r\ncurrent version of section 16-3-625 of the South Carolina Code (2003), which was\r\nalso enacted in 1980 and concerns resisting arrest with a deadly weapon, has\r\nretained the requirement that one charged with this offense must \"resist[ ] the\r\nlawful efforts of a law enforcement officer to arrest him or another person . . . .\"\r\n3 Although Husted correctly notes the indictment mentioned a lawful arrest, a\r\nvariance between the charge and the proof \"is not material if it is not an element of\r\nthe offense.\" State v. Evans, 322 S.C. 78, 81, 470 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1996).\r\n\ngive a requested charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial.\"), cert. dismissed\r\nas improvidently granted, 401 S.C. 569, 737 S.E.2d 853 (2013).\r\n\r\n3. Finally, Husted complains the trial court erred in declining to include five other\r\ninstructions that he requested to be included in the jury charge. We find no\r\nreversible error.\r\n\r\nWe first question whether Husted has adequately preserved the omission of these\r\nrequests to charge for our review. The argument he presents in his brief is of a\r\nsummary nature and includes no supporting authority. See State v. Jones, 344 S.C.\r\n48, 58-59, 543 S.E.2d 541, 546 (2001) (declining to address an issue on appeal\r\nbecause the supporting argument was \"so conclusory that it has been abandoned\").\r\nWe also note the absence of any indication in the record that Husted, though he\r\nobjected to the omission in the charge regarding the absence of the instruction he\r\nrequested on lawful arrest, never argued after the charge was read to the jury that\r\nthe other instructions were erroneously omitted. See Rule 20(b), SCRCrimP\r\n(allowing the parties in a criminal trial to \"object to the giving or omission of an\r\ninstruction\" \"[n]otwithstanding any request for legal instructions\" and providing\r\nthat \"[f]ailure to object in accordance with this rule shall constitute a waiver of\r\nobjection\").\r\n\r\nIn any event, we hold the jury charge was adequate. Four of the instructions at\r\nissue here concerned the necessity of proving a defendant used fighting words as\r\nopposed to mere profanity toward a police officer to convict that defendant of\r\ndisorderly conduct. The substance of these requested charges was included in the\r\ntrial court's instructions that \"[t]he State may not punish a person for voicing an\r\nobjection to a police officer where no fighting words are used\" and that \"[f]ighting\r\nwords are words which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an\r\nimmediate breach of the peace.\" The fifth requested instruction, that a person who\r\nflees a police officer's \"simple demand to stop\" is not resisting arrest, was\r\nostensibly taken from this court's opinion in State v. Brannon, 379 S.C. 487, 508,\r\n666 S.E.2d 272, 283 (Ct. App. 2008). The Supreme Court of South Carolina,\r\nhowever, has issued its own opinion in Brannon indicating that even in the absence\r\nof any physical contact between a police officer and a suspect, an arrest could be\r\nfound to be in progress upon a showing of \"intent on the part of the officer to arrest\r\nthe suspect, and intent on the part of the suspect to submit to the arrest, under the\r\nbelief that submission was necessary.\" Brannon, 388 S.C. at 504, 697 S.E.2d at\r\n\n597. Husted's remaining request to charge was not a correct statement of the law\r\nwhen this matter came to trial,4 and the trial court committed no abuse of discretion\r\nin refusing to include it. See Cole v.

(collectively, Respondents). Dill argues the trial court erred in: (1) declining\r\nto adopt the doctrine of reasonable expectations; (2) finding Respondents did not\r\nhave a duty to advise Jim Morton, the former president of The Barn; (3)\r\ndetermining Morton's failure to read the insurance policy is a bar to liability; and\r\n(4) finding the statute of limitations bars her claims of negligence and negligent\r\nmisrepresentation. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities:\r\n\r\n1.     As to Dill's argument the trial court erred in declining to adopt the doctrine\r\nof reasonable expectations: State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 134, 620 S.E.2d\r\n737, 741 (2005) (holding an issue is not preserved for appeal where one ground is\r\nraised below and another ground is raised on appeal); Staubes v. City of Folly\r\nBeach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (\"It is well-settled that an\r\nissue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and\r\nruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.\").1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Even if we found the issue preserved, we would affirm. See Ex Parte United\r\nServs. Auto. Ass'n, 365 S.C. 50, 54, 614 S.E.2d 652, 654 (Ct. App. 2005) (\"The\r\ndoctrine of reasonable expectations, which is essentially that the objectively\r\nreasonable expectations of insureds as to coverage will be honored even though a\r\ncareful review of the terms of the policy would have shown otherwise, has been\r\nrejected in South Carolina.\" (citing Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mangum, 299 S.C. 226, 231,\r\n383 S.E.2d 464, 466-67 (Ct. App. 1989))).\r\n\n2.     As to Dill's argument the trial court erred in finding Respondents did not\r\nhave a duty to advise Morton: Houck v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C.\r\n7, 12, 620 S.E.2d 326, 329 (2005) (determining an insurance agent has no duty to\r\nadvise an insured at the point of application, absent an express or implied\r\nundertaking to do so; however, a duty may be imposed if the agent undertakes to\r\nadvise the insured); Gordon v. Fid. & Cas. Co. of N.Y., 238 S.C. 438, 450-51, 120\r\nS.E.2d 509, 515 (1961) (finding no relationship of trust and confidence existed\r\nbetween the insurance applicant and the insurance agent, and silence on the part of\r\nthe agent with respect to the benefits under the policy was not fraud when the agent\r\ndid nothing to prevent the applicant from reading the policy); O'Connor v. Bhd. of\r\nR.R. Trainmen, 217 S.C. 442, 448, 60 S.E.2d 884, 886 (1950) (holding no relation\r\nof trust and confidence existed between the insurance applicant and the soliciting\r\nagent where they had not known each other prior to the transaction and the agent\r\ndid nothing to prevent the applicant from reading the application); Pitts v. Jackson\r\nNat'l Life Ins. Co., 352 S.C. 319, 331, 574 S.E.2d 502, 508 (Ct. App. 2002) (\"[A]n\r\napplicant for an insurance policy does not stand in a fiduciary relationship with the\r\ninsurer.\"); Carolina Prod. Maint., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 310 S.C. 32, 37-\r\n38, 425 S.E.2d 39, 42-43 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding the insurance agent was not\r\nnegligent in obtaining a business liability policy for the insured company that\r\ncontained a \"care, custody, or control\" exclusion because the exclusion was\r\nstandard, so the agent could not have obtained policy without it, and the agent did\r\nnot assume any special duty to advise the insured).\r\n\r\n3.     As to Dill's argument the trial court erred in determining Morton's failure to\r\nread the insurance policy is a bar to liability: Doub v. Weathersby-Breeland Ins.\r\nAgency, 268 S.C. 319, 326-327, 233 S.E.2d 111, 114 (1977) (finding the insurance\r\nagency was not liable for an alleged misrepresentation that the policy covered\r\neverything, when it excluded loss caused directly or indirectly by frost, cold\r\nweather, ice, snow, or sleet, because the plaintiff had 18 months to inform himself\r\nof the terms, conditions, and exclusions in the written insurance contract, yet he\r\nmade no effort to do so and never read the contract); Gordon, 238 S.C. at 446-47,\r\n120 S.E.2d at 513 (\"We have consistently followed the rule that ordinarily one\r\ncannot complain of fraud in the misrepresentation of the content of a written\r\ninstrument when the truth could have been ascertained by reading the instrument,\r\nand one entering into a written contract should read it and avail himself of every\r\nreasonable opportunity to understand its content and meaning.\"); O'Connor, 217\r\nS.C. at 449, 60 S.E.2d at 886-87 (\"[I]t was gross negligence for one to sign an\r\napplication for insurance without knowing its contents and without considering the\r\neffect it would have upon his rights.\"); Frierson v. Inter-Ocean Cas. Co., 168 S.C.\r\n\n178, 182-83, 167 S.E. 232, 234 (1933) (holding there was no actionable fraud\r\nbecause the plaintiff was negligent in failing to read the application and in failing\r\nto inspect the policy after it was delivered).\r\n\r\n4.     As to Dill's argument the trial court erred in finding the statute of limitations\r\nbars her claims of negligence and negligent misrepresentation: S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n15-3-530(1) and (5) (2005) (providing the following actions must be commenced\r\nwithin three years: \"(1) an action upon a contract, obligation, or liability, express\r\nor implied\" and \"(5) an action for assault, battery, or any injury to the person or\r\nrights of another, not arising on contract and not enumerated by law.\"); S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 15-3-535 (2005) (\"[A]ll actions initiated under Section 15-3-530(5) must be\r\ncommenced within three years after the person knew or by the exercise of\r\nreasonable diligence should have known that he had a cause of action.\");\r\nChristensen v. Mikell, 324 S.C. 70, 73, 476 S.E.2d 692, 694 (1996) (\"The statutory\r\nlimitations period begins to run when a person could or should have known,\r\nthrough the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a cause of action might exist in\r\nhis or her favor, rather than when a full-blown theory of recovery is developed.\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
