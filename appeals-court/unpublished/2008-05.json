Babb (Babb)\r\n  appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order for the Respondents arguing (1) the statute\r\n  of limitations expired before their declaratory judgment counterclaim was\r\n  filed, (2) the counterclaim did not relate back to the date of the original\r\n  pleadings, and (3) the circuit court erred in ruling on the Respondentsâ€™ waiver\r\n  defense because it had been disposed of prior to trial by summary judgment.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFacts\r\nAt an auction conducted by the United States Marshals Service in June 1991, Babb, Charles Watson, and Carl Meares submitted a\r\n  successful bid of $400,000 for an 8.4 acre parcel of land known as Little River\r\n  Campground (the Campground) in Horry County, South Carolina.Â  Babb, Watson and\r\n  Meares each paid $25,000 earnest money to hold their interest, leaving a\r\n  balance of $375,000.Â  The parties agreed to form a corporation in which the Campground\r\n  would be the corporationâ€™s asset.Â  Babb, Watson and Meares would be\r\n  shareholders with a one-third interest in the corporation.Â  In August, 1991,\r\n  the parties filed articles of incorporation for Little River Campground\r\n  Incorporated (LRCI).Â  Babbâ€™s husband, Mac Babb, was appointed president and\r\n  Watson was Secretary and Treasurer.Â  In April 1995, Watson issued three LCRI\r\n  stock certificates, one to each party, and mailed them to Mac Babb for his\r\n  signature as president.Â  Babb is in possession of her stock certificate though\r\n  the parties contest whether the certificates were ever satisfactorily signed\r\n  and delivered before closing.Â  \r\nDue\r\n  to environmental cleanup efforts, the sale of the property was not closed until\r\n  December 6, 1995, at which time Babb, Watson and Meares each paid $125,000.Â \r\n  Prior to closing, however, Babb instructed the closing attorney, John Martini\r\n  (Martini), to deed to her a one-third undivided interest in the 8.4 acres.Â  It\r\n  is undisputed that upon closing, LRCI was deeded a two-third undivided interest\r\n  in the property and Babb was deeded an undivided interest in one-third.Â  \r\nBabb\r\n  contended that she became aware that 4.2 acres of land adjacent to the\r\n  Campground was available for purchase.Â  In amended pleadings, she stated the\r\n  parties discussed forming a new corporation in which to title this new acreage\r\n  and any subsequently acquired real property.Â  The parties concede the acreage\r\n  was purchased and titled to CLW Investments, a real estate investment company\r\n  operated by respondents Watson and McLamb.Â  \r\nOn June\r\n  24, 1997, Babb commenced a derivative suit against Watson, and McLamb\r\n  concerning the purchase.[2] Â Respondents answered with general denials.Â  Babb filed an amended\r\n  complaint on August 10, 1998, naming as plaintiffs LRCI; Mac Babb, as an\r\n  officer and director of LRCI; and herself individually and as a shareholder.Â  The\r\n  case was stricken from the roster pursuant to Rule 40(j), SCRCP, but restored\r\n  by motion in May 1999.Â  Respondents filed an amended answer in April 2001.Â \r\n  This answer provided in part:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tTo the extent that Plaintiffâ€™s Complaint infers \r\n\t\t\tthat Plaintiff Brenda Babb is shareholder in Little River \r\n\t\t\tCampground, Inc., such allegation is denied and strict proof is \r\n\t\t\tdemanded thereof.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn addition to general\r\n  admissions and denials, the answer asserted no agreement was reached concerning\r\n  the purchase of the adjacent property.Â  It asserted the defenses of unclean\r\n  hands, waiver by Babb of any legal or equitable interest in LRCI, and laches.Â \r\n  The answer additionally requested a 12(b)(6) dismissal.Â  Pursuant to\r\n  Respondentsâ€™ motion, LRCI and Mac Babb were dismissed from the case on May 25,\r\n  2001.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  June 2001, Respondents filed and served an amended answer that included a\r\n  counterclaim for slander of title.Â  A reply to the amended answer and\r\n  counterclaim was filed July 26, 2001.Â  Regarding the counterclaim, Babb claimed\r\n  Respondents failed to bring the counterclaim within the applicable statute of\r\n  limitations, and asserted the additional defense of laches.\r\nRespondents\r\n  moved to transfer the suit to the non-jury roster and requested that any\r\n  equitable shareholderâ€™s claim should be resolved prior to a jury trial on any\r\n  remaining issues.Â  The order was granted with the circuit court finding:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1)&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tThe gravamen of Plaintiffâ€™s\r\n  complaint is a shareholderâ€™s derivative suit filed on behalf of Little River\r\n  Campground, Inc. against Defendants alleging they usurped a corporate\r\n  opportunityâ€¦.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2)\r\n\t\t\tThat many, if not all, of the other claims asserted \r\n\t\t\tby Plaintiffs have, as their basis, a claim that Defendants were \r\n\t\t\talleged required to acquire land on behalf of Little River \r\n\t\t\tCampground, Inc. and that Defendants usurped a corporate \r\n\t\t\topportunity;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  July 26, 2002, Babb filed an amended reply to Respondentsâ€™ second amended\r\n  answer and counterclaim.Â  In addition to a general denial, Babb reiterated the\r\n  statute of limitations and laches defenses.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court in Charleston County, on June 18, 2003, addressed several motions\r\n  filed by the parties.Â  Relevant to this appeal, Babbâ€™s motion to amend and\r\n  dismiss her claims as a shareholder in LRCI was granted.Â  \r\nBabb\r\n  moved for summary judgment on Respondentsâ€™ slander of title counterclaim and\r\n  the defenses of unclean hands and waiver.Â  By an order filed December 29, 2003,\r\n  summary judgment was granted to Babb on the slander of title counterclaim.Â  The\r\n  circuit court acknowledged Babbâ€™s claims as a shareholder had been dismissed at\r\n  her request.Â  The court stated:\r\n\r\n\tBecause\r\n  her damage claims as a shareholder have been dismissed, defendantsâ€™ affirmative\r\n  defenses as to those claims should likewise be dismissed.Â  Therefore,\r\n  plaintiff is hereby granted summary judgment on defendantsâ€™ defenses of unclean\r\n  hands and waiver.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nRespondents\r\n  moved for a third amended answer and counterclaim in December 2003.Â Â  The\r\n  answer added LRCI and shareholder Carl Meares as parties.Â  It repeated the same\r\n  general admissions and denials contained in previous answers.Â  Pertinent to this\r\n  appeal, as a defense and by way of a counterclaim, Respondents raised a\r\n  declaratory judgment action.Â  In support, Respondents contend they are entitled\r\n  to a court order declaring Babb (1) waived any legal or equitable interest in\r\n  LRCI by request and receipt of an undivided one-third interest; (2) is barred\r\n  from claiming interest by the unclean hands doctrine; and (3) is not a\r\n  shareholder in LRCI.Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  granted Respondentsâ€™ motion to amend the answer and counterclaim and add\r\n  parties on January 5, 2004.Â  The order stated:\r\n\r\n\t[I]t\r\n  appears that the matters which Defendants seek to raise by amendment are matters\r\n  which have been litigated by these parties for the past several years this\r\n  action has been pending.Â  Under these circumstances, Plaintiff is not\r\n  prejudiced by such amendment.\r\n\r\nBabb\r\n  filed her reply to the third amended answer and counterclaim on March 4, 2004.Â \r\n  In June 2004, the declaratory action was heard at a bench trial.Â  The sole\r\n  issue was whether Babb was a shareholder in LRCI.Â  The circuit court ruled in\r\n  favor of Respondents.Â  \r\nDiscussion \r\nBabb\r\n  argues the circuit court erred by (1) hearing Respondentsâ€™ counterclaim because\r\n  the statute of limitations had expired; (2) finding the counterclaim related\r\n  back to the date of the original pleadings; and (3) ruling on Respondentsâ€™\r\n  waiver defense because it had previously been dismissed by summary judgment.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n\r\n\tAccording to the discovery rule, the\r\n  statute of limitations begins to run when a cause of action reasonably ought to\r\n  have been discovered. The statute runs from the date the injured party either\r\n  knows or should have known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause\r\n  of action arises from the wrongful conduct.\r\n\r\nHedgepath v. AT&amp;T, 348 S.C. 340, 355-56, 559 S.E.2d 327, 336 (2001)\r\n  (quoting Dean v. Ruscon, 321 S.C. 360, 468 S.E.2d 645 (1996)).Â  â€œThe\r\n  exercise of reasonable diligence means simply that an injured party must act\r\n  with some promptness where the facts and circumstances of an injury would put a\r\n  person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has\r\n  been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist.â€Â  Wiggins\r\n    v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, 442 S.E.2d 169 (1994).Â  The fact that an injured\r\n  party may not comprehend the full extent of the damage is immaterial.Â  Dean\r\n    v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 468 S.E.2d 645 (1996).Â  In State ex rel.\r\n      Condon v. City of Columbia, 339 S.C. 8, 19, 528 S.E.2d 408, 414 (2000), our\r\n  Supreme Court instructed:\r\n\r\n\tStatutes of limitations embody important public policy\r\n  considerations in that they stimulate activity, punish negligence, and promote\r\n  repose by giving security and stability to human affairs. Â One purpose of a\r\n  statute of limitations is to relieve the courts of the burden of trying stale\r\n  claims when a plaintiff has slept on his rights. Â Another purpose ... is to\r\n  protect potential defendants from protracted fear of litigation.\r\n\r\nHere, Babb asserts\r\n  the statute of limitations began to run with the December 6, 1995 closing on\r\n  the Campground. Â She contends Respondents knew or should have known she claimed\r\n  a one-third interest in both LRCI and the Campground.Â  According to Babb, Respondentsâ€™\r\n  declaratory judgment action was barred on December 5, 1998.Â  Respondents filed\r\n  the action January 16, 2004.Â  \r\nRespondents\r\n  argue the counterclaim for declaratory judgment relates back to Babbâ€™s initial\r\n  lawsuit pursuant to Rule 15(c), SCRCP.Â  Rule 15 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\t(c) Relation Back of Amendments. Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended\r\n  pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction or occurrence set forth or\r\n  attempted to be set forth in the original pleadings, the amendment relates back\r\n  to the date of the original pleading.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  central requirement here is that the party defending against the new claim have\r\n  sufficient notice of it, i.e., â€˜the new claim must be â€˜logically\r\n  relatedâ€™ to the matters originally pleaded so that the defendant is not\r\n  prejudiced by the new claim asserted after the statute of limitations has expired.â€™â€ Â Â Whitfield\r\n    Constr. Co. v. Bank of Tokyo Trust Co., 338 S.C. 207, 223, 525 S.E.2d 888,\r\n  897 (Ct. App. 1999) (quoting James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil\r\n    Procedure 127 (2d ed.1996)) (emphasis in original).Â  \r\n\r\n\tIn federal practice, the factors to determine whether or not a\r\n  claim arose out of the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth in\r\n  the original pleading include: (1) whether the party defending against the new\r\n  claim had notice of it; (2) whether the party seeking to add the new claim will\r\n  rely on the same kind of evidence offered in support of the original claim to\r\n  prove the new claim; and (3) whether unfair surprise to the defending party\r\n  would result if the amendment were to relate back.\r\n\r\nId.Â  (citing James Wm. Moore, Mooreâ€™s\r\n  Federal Practice Â§ 15.19[2]Â  (Daniel R. Coquillete et al eds., 3d\r\n  1999)).\r\nIn Whitfield, the defendant bank asserted a counterclaim\r\n  for abuse of process after the statute of limitations had run.Â  This court\r\n  instructed, â€œ[t]he proper inquiryâ€¦ is whether [the defendant] had ever provided\r\n  notice in any of its prior pleadings that it intended to allege such a\r\n  counterclaim, not whether Whitfield should have anticipated that the\r\n  counterclaim would follow as a result of his own actions.â€Â  Id. Â The\r\n  defendantâ€™s first responsive pleading presented only general denials and\r\n  certain defenses.Â  A first amended counterclaim added an unjust enrichment\r\n  counterclaim and prayed for a set-off, but it was otherwise similar to the\r\n  original answer.Â  Neither pleading suggested the plaintiff made improper use of\r\n  process, and â€œ[w]ithout any indication in its prior responsive pleadings that Whitfield\r\n  was to defend against such an allegation, we fail to see how [the defendant]\r\n  had set forth, or even attempted to set forth, the conduct, transaction, or\r\n  occurrence giving rise to a counterclaim for abuse of process.â€Â  Id. at 224, 525 S.E.2d at 897.Â  The court noted the lack of any serious dispute that\r\n  the defendant knew or should have known it had an abuse of process counterclaim\r\n  when the complaint was filed.Â  Id. at 224, 525 S.E.2d at 898.Â  â€œThe\r\n  question of whether the amendment resulted in actual prejudice to Whitfield is\r\n  not a factor in determining whether the counterclaim is barred by the statute\r\n  of limitations.â€Â  Id. at 224-25, 525 S.E.2d at 898.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  counterclaim did not relate back.\r\nHere,\r\n  the circuit court judge inquired whether Respondents ever gave notice in prior\r\n  pleadings of an intention to allege a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment\r\n  that Babb was not a shareholder in LRCI.Â  He determined the first answer filed\r\n  July 16, 1997, included only general denials and certain defenses.Â  But after\r\n  Babb first asserted she was a shareholder in her amended complaint filed August\r\n  10, 1998, Respondentsâ€™ amended answer in reply specifically denied Babb was a\r\n  shareholder in LRCI.Â  The circuit judge found â€œ[u]nlike in Whitfield,\r\n  the defendants in the instant case indicated in their prior responsive\r\n  pleadings that the plaintiff was to defend against the allegation that she was\r\n  not a shareholder of [LRCI].â€Â Â  Accordingly, the circuit judge concluded the\r\n  declaratory judgment counterclaim â€œarose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence\r\n  set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the plaintiff\r\n  had sufficient notice of the claim, and the claim is logically related to the\r\n  matters originally pled.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court judge further noted the issue had previously been decided by an\r\n  order filed January 4, 2004, by a different circuit court judge.Â  There, Respondentsâ€™\r\n  motion to amend their answer and assert the counterclaim was granted.Â  The\r\n  judge granting the motion determined, â€œit appears that the matters which [Respondents]\r\n  seek to raise by amendment are matters which have been litigated by these\r\n  parties for the past several years this action has been pending.â€Â  Importantly,\r\n  no motion to alter or amend the ruling has been made by either party, nor has\r\n  there been a request to reconsider.Â  Thus, the judge issuing the declaratory\r\n  judgment correctly acknowledged he had no right to reconsider the order of\r\n  another circuit judge.Â  See Dinkins v. Robbins, 203 S.C. 199,\r\n  202, 26 S.E.2d 689 (1943) (â€œthe prior order of one Circuit Judge may not be\r\n  modified by the subsequent order of another Circuit Judge, except in cases\r\n  where the right to do so has been reserved to the succeeding Judge, when it is\r\n  allowed by rule or statute, or when the subsequent order does not substantially\r\n  affect the ruling or decision represented by the previous order.â€)Â  \r\nIn\r\n  their counterclaim, Respondents argued Babb â€œwaived any legal or equitable\r\n  interest she had in [LRCI], inasmuch as she requested and received an undivided\r\n  one-third interest in 8.4 acres (2.8 acres) that was to be titled, in its\r\n  entirety, in the name of [LRCI].â€Â  â€œWaiver is a voluntary and intentional\r\n  abandonment or relinquishment of a known right.â€Â  Murdock v. Murdock,\r\n  338 S.C. 322, 333, 526 S.E.2d 241, 247 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Parker v.\r\n    Parker, 313 S.C. 482, 443 S.E.2d 388 (1994)).Â  Waiver may be express or implied\r\n  by a partyâ€™s conduct.Â  Parker, 313 S.C. at 487, 443 S.E.2d at 391.Â  Acts\r\n  inconsistent with the continued assertion of a right may implicate waiver.Â  Provident\r\n    Life and Acc. Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 478, 451 S.E.2d 924, 928\r\n  (Ct. App. 1994).Â  â€œWhether a party is barred byâ€¦ waiver can only be determined\r\n  in light of the circumstances of each case.â€Â  Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas\r\n    Horizontal Property Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 388 (1992).Â \r\n  Waiver is an affirmative defense and the party asserting it has the burden of\r\n  proof.Â  Provident Life and Acc. Ins. Co., 317 S.C. at 478, 451 S.E.2d at\r\n  928; Frady v. Smith, 247 S.C. 353, 147 S.E.2d 412 (1966).Â  â€œGenerally,\r\n  the party claiming waiver must show that the party against whom waiver is\r\n  asserted possessed, at the time, actual or constructive knowledge of his rights\r\n  or of all the material facts upon which they depended.â€Â  Janasik, 307\r\n  S.C. at 344, 415 S.E.2d at 387-88.\r\nBabb\r\n  argues Respondentsâ€™ use of waiver is an inappropriate offensive use of the\r\n  doctrine.Â  See Janasik, 307 S.C. at 345, 415 S.E.2d at 388\r\n  (waiver is protective only and not to be used as an offensive weapon).Â  However,\r\n  the circuit court concluded the Respondents â€œasserted waiver to protect their\r\n  purported investment, to shield [Babb] from claiming an interest in which they\r\n  do not concede she has a right.â€Â  We agree.\r\nBabb\r\n  brought her shareholder status into contention when she brought a shareholder\r\n  derivative action.Â  When Babb voluntarily dismissed her claims as a shareholder\r\n  over Respondentsâ€™ objection, the record shows Respondents expressed to the\r\n  court their desire that the order reflect their continued claims that Babb was\r\n  not a shareholder.Â  Babb contends that because she had dismissed her\r\n  shareholder claims, Respondents were without a cause of action requiring this\r\n  defense.Â  However, as the circuit judge stated, Respondents only raised the\r\n  declaratory judgment action upon the dismissal of her shareholder claims.Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œThe Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act does not create substantive\r\n  rights or duties; rather it authorizes an action to establish a partyâ€™s\r\n  entitlement to a pre-existing right.â€Â  Harvey v. South Carolina Depâ€™t\r\n    of Corrections, 338 S.C. 500, 527 S.E.2d 765 (Ct. App. 2000); see also Noisette v. Ismail, 299 S.C. 243, 247 n. 1, 384 S.E.2d 310, 312 n. 1\r\n  (Ct. App. 1989), revâ€™d in part by 304 S.C. 56, 403 S.E.2d 122 (1991); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-53-10 et. seq. (2005).Â  Respondentsâ€™ counterclaim\r\n  seeking to establish their right to possess the shares of LRCI was authorized\r\n  by the Declaratory Judgments Act.Â  \r\nRespondents, however, carried the burden to prove Babb waived her\r\n  interest in LRCI.Â  The parties agree LRCI was formed solely for the purpose of\r\n  holding the 8.4 acres of land known as Little River Campground.Â  Articles of\r\n  incorporation were filed with the Secretary of State in August, 1991.Â  Further,\r\n  the parties agree Babb was deeded an undivided one-third interest in the Campground.Â \r\n  A review of the record leads this court to agree with the circuit court that\r\n  Babb voluntarily and intentionally abandoned or relinquished any right to a one-third\r\n  interest in LRCIâ€™s corporate shares.Â  \r\nAccording to Mearesâ€™ testimony, at the time of LRCIâ€™s formation in\r\n  1991, no stock certificates were issued.Â  Between 1991 and 1995, no shareholder\r\n  agreement existed, and no formal meetings were held to take votes.Â  As of 1991,\r\n  Meares agreed Babb was a shareholder.Â  Due to contamination issues, it took\r\n  from 1991 to 1995 to close on the property.Â  Together with Mac Babb and the\r\n  help of attorneys, Meares worked on the environmental cleanup.Â  He was involved\r\n  with correspondence and phone calls, and attended numerous related meetings\r\n  with Mac Babb.Â  Meares testified that he and Mac Babb volunteered their\r\n  efforts, spent roughly the same time working on the cleanup, and had never had\r\n  any agreement that the two would be compensated.Â  Further, he said he never had\r\n  a conversation with Babb indicating she would receive more than a one-third\r\n  interest in the Campground.Â  \r\nOn April 4, 1995, Watson sent to Babb and Mac Babb three\r\n  promissory notes for $5000 to be executed by each investor, a proposed\r\n  shareholder agreement, and stock certificates for Babb, Watson and Meares.Â  Although\r\n  signed by Watson as secretary of LRCI, to be valid, the certificates required\r\n  Mac Babbâ€™s signature as president.Â  The record indicates on May 17, 1995,\r\n  Watson sent a revised shareholder agreement to Babb and Mac Babb and requested\r\n  again that Mac Babb sign and return the stock certificates.Â  At trial, Jerry\r\n  Fehlig, Watsonâ€™s son-in-law and current LRCI secretary, and Meares both\r\n  testified to never having seen any stock certificates bearing both required\r\n  signatures.Â  Whereas Respondents produced copies of certificates for Meares and\r\n  Watson bearing only Watsonâ€™s signature, Babb introduced into evidence an\r\n  original stock certificate bearing the signatures of Watson and Mac Babb.Â  Citing Ward v. Atlas Construction Company, Inc., 276 S.C. 346, 278 S.E.2d 621 (1981),\r\n  the circuit court explained in its order mere possession of a stock certificate\r\n  is not dispositive.\r\nRespondents contend Babb and Mac Babb created the shareholder\r\n  claim by Mac Babb signing the stock certificate after the closing on the Campground\r\n  and the death of Watson.Â  Mac Babb stated in his deposition he did not remember\r\n  the date he signed the certificates, but he knew it was â€œafter April the 26th of 1995.â€Â  At trial, Babb testified she saw Mac Babb sign the stock\r\n  certificates in Watsonâ€™s office and believed this happened in early June.Â \r\n  However, in her earlier deposition Babb reported she did not know when Watson\r\n  sent the certificates to Mac Babb, whether they were signed by him as president\r\n  of LRCI, or if Mac Babb transmitted the certificates to the other\r\n  shareholders.Â  Babb explained the differing testimony resulted from her\r\n  reviewing her records and notes some time after being deposed.Â  The circuit\r\n  court observed â€œeven if she was much better prepared for trial, the trial was\r\n  in 2004, three years after the deposition and ten years removed from the events\r\n  in question.â€\r\nMeares and Fehlig said Babb first produced her stock certificate\r\n  bearing both signatures during discovery in 2001 or 2002.Â  Both told the court\r\n  the other stock certificates sent simultaneously to Mac Babb for his signature\r\n  were never signed and returned.Â  Fehlig further testified at trial that his\r\n  review of corporate records failed to disclose any agreements concerning Babbâ€™s\r\n  shareholder claim in LRCI.Â  Fehlig found neither corporate records documenting\r\n  Mac Babbâ€™s LRCI activities nor any documents or corporate resolutions professing\r\n  to â€œgive awayâ€ interest in LRCI to Babb.Â  The record indicates no corporate\r\n  bank account was established.Â  The $5000 promissory notes and a shareholdersâ€™\r\n  agreement were never executed.Â  However, the circuit judge in his order\r\n  concluded â€œeven if the circumstances surrounding the stock certificates seem\r\n  suspicious, the defendants have not proven fraud on the part of the plaintiff\r\n  in the procurement of the signed stock certificate.â€\r\n\r\n\tIn his deposition, Mac Babb was asked:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tDo you have any knowledge whether initially the \r\n\t\t\tdeed for Little River Campground at closing was going to be \r\n\t\t\tdeededâ€”the property was going to be deeded solely in the name of [LRCI]?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tIt was never intended for that to happen.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tNeverâ€”from what point was it never intended.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tNever intended.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHowever, the circuit judgeâ€™s order indicates a letter entered into\r\n  evidence indicated on October 3, 1995, Mac Babb, as president, received a letter\r\n  from the General Services Administration asking if Mac Babb to â€œ[p]lease\r\n  confirm that [Mac Babb] still desire[d] to have the deed identify the grantee\r\n  as [LRCI].â€Â  A second letter from the General Services Administration dated\r\n  November 2, 1995, asked Mac Babb to again confirm whether he still wanted the\r\n  deed to identify LRCI as the grantee.Â  On November 13, 1995, Brandon sent a\r\n  letter and a copy of the deed to closing attorney Martini.Â  Brandon indicated\r\n  the original deed would be â€œovernightedâ€ to Martini upon receipt of the\r\n  checks.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record shows Babb entered evidence that on November 14, 1995, she delivered a\r\n  letter to closing attorney Martini that included a cashierâ€™s check for $125,000\r\n  representing the purchase of one-third of the Campground.Â  Babb further\r\n  indicated to Martini:\r\n\r\n\tThe deed should identify me as Grantee for my portion of this\r\n  transaction in the following manner and should be confirmed with the [General\r\n  Services Administration] prior to closing by your office:Â  Brenda Robinson\r\n  Babb, a resident of Brunswick County, North Carolina, a One Third Undivided\r\n  Interest[.]\r\n\r\nAt trial, Meares testified he received a phone call from Martini before the closing, and\r\n  then phoned Mac Babb in response:\r\n\r\n\tAfter I received the call from [Martini], I called thisâ€”this was\r\n  the night before we had to close the next day.Â  And if we didnâ€™t close, the US Marshal Service had already notified us that we would lose the property and our $25,000\r\n  that we originally put down.Â  And so I got a hold of Mac and asked him why he\r\n  was all of a sudden at the last minute taking his one-third interest outside\r\n  the corporation.Â  And he said, well, I donâ€™t want to be out-moneyed, and we\r\n  just donâ€™t feel comfortable being in the corporation.Â  He said that Brenda\r\n  doesnâ€™t feel comfortable being in the corporation, so she wants to take her\r\n  one-third interest outside the corporation.Â  \r\n\r\nMeares reported there was never any conversation with Mac Babb or\r\n  Babb discussing Babbâ€™s entitlement to more than the one-third interest outside\r\n  the corporation.Â  As a result, Meares stated his understanding was that he and\r\n  Watson would be the only shareholders in LRCI.Â  In a subsequent phone call to\r\n  Martini, Meares told him:\r\n\r\n\tI told [Martini] that Mac just was not going to cooperate so we\r\n  had no other choice but to go ahead and give [Babb] her one-third interest\r\n  outside the corporation, and I didnâ€™t have any choice but to agree to that or\r\n  lose the property.\r\n\r\nBabb\r\n  explained at trial that she believed the original agreement between the parties\r\n  was that â€œeach would participate with a third.â€Â  She averred her understanding\r\n  was based on conversations to which she was a party.Â  However, in her\r\n  deposition she had previously stated, â€œI donâ€™t know what the original\r\n  understanding was because I wasnâ€™t involved in those negotiations.â€Â  She then\r\n  explained in her testimony:\\\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tI did not hear what Mr. Meares,\r\n  Mr. Watson, and Mr. Babb discussed at the auction because I was standing at the\r\n  other side of the tent.Â  What I am referring to is what I heard at the later\r\n  meeting.Â  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  September 1995, Babb said it was decided she would receive more out of the\r\n  investment.Â  Babb testified she never gave up or waived her interest in the\r\n  shares of LRCI.Â  She explained, had she done so, Mac Babb would not have been\r\n  compensated for his services as president.Â  However, Babbâ€™s counsel argued at\r\n  trial there was an additional agreement between the shareholders to compensate\r\n  Mac Babb.Â  Babb told the court that Mac Babb agreed in 1991 to become the\r\n  president on the condition he be compensated based on his performance, which\r\n  included enhancing the value of the property.Â  \r\nOver\r\n  his ten years as president, Babb stated Mac Babb secured the tape from the\r\n  auction, attended several meetings in Georgia and South Carolina addressing the\r\n  contamination issue, secured estimates of the dock repair and obtained dock\r\n  permits, and dealt with various zoning matters.Â  Over the ten year period, Babb\r\n  estimated Mac Babb â€œworked close to 3,000 hours a year on this property.â€Â  The\r\n  circuit judge in his order considered this approximation â€œa staggering amount\r\n  of time that this court calls into question.â€\r\nBabb\r\n  contended a compensation agreement was reached in September 1995.Â  On direct\r\n  examination, Babb was asked:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tAll right.&nbsp; Letâ€™s go back, and you tell the \r\n\t\t\tcourt how it is that you ended up with a deed of one-third interest \r\n\t\t\tof the real estate and a stock certificate representing one-third of \r\n\t\t\tthe stock.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\t[Mac Babbâ€™s] compensation was based on his \r\n\t\t\tperformance.&nbsp; As a result of his performance, I was given a \r\n\t\t\tone-third undivided interest in the property which represented 11 \r\n\t\t\tpercent from Mr. Watson, 11 percent from Mr. Meares.Â  The reason that I was given a one-third\r\n  undivided interest is if I was given additional stock I would have controlling\r\n  interest in the corporation.â€\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWhile\r\n  on the stand, the judge asked Babb:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\t[I]s it your position, maâ€™am, you\r\n  were paidâ€”you were compensated in this manner for services that you husband\r\n  performed for the corporation?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tMy husband was compensated and my husband gave me \r\n\t\t\tthe compensation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn its order, the\r\n  circuit court noted:\r\n\r\n\t[Babb] testified that Meares agreed that she would receive\r\n  one-third (1/3) of the real estate in addition to her stock.Â  However, [Babb]\r\n  testified at trial that she never had a conversation with Meares about any\r\n  agreement to give her more of an interest.Â  As indicated previously, Meares\r\n  testified he never had a conversation with [Babb] whereby [she] would receive\r\n  more than a one-third (1/3) share of Little River Campground.\r\n\r\nIn his\r\n  deposition, Mac Babb said Babb is a shareholder in LRCI, and she additionally holds\r\n  a one-third undivided interest in the 8.4 acre campground.Â  Respondentsâ€™\r\n  counsel questioned him on this outcome:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tHow is it, if you have three shareholders and they \r\n\t\t\tall put in approximately the same amount, she comes out with so much \r\n\t\t\tmore?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tIt happens all the time, sir.&nbsp; It happens all \r\n\t\t\tthe time, sir.&nbsp; It happens in most people that donâ€™t pay the \r\n\t\t\tsame.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tOkay.&nbsp; What exactlyâ€”so youâ€™re sayingâ€”what are \r\n\t\t\tyou saying?&nbsp; Just out of the goodness of their heart Carl Meares or Mr. Watson just said, Here, take some extra acreage?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;That may have been what happened.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\t[] I want to know what your personal understanding \r\n\t\t\tis as to how that arrangement was reached.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA:\r\n\t\t\tI donâ€™t know.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tDoes that seem fair to you, that everybody would \r\n\t\t\tput---\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tIt seems fair to me.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ: \r\n\t\t\tWas there any additional consideration given by \r\n\t\t\t[Babb] to get additional acreage such that while every party put in \r\n\t\t\tan equal amount of money she got more acreage than they did?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tIt happens all the time.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tâ€¦\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ:\r\n\t\t\tExplain to me how she ended up getting one-third \r\n\t\t\tundivided interest when everybody put in the same amount.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA: \r\n\t\t\tIt happened.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough review of the record, this court agrees with the\r\n  order of the circuit court judge.Â  Although Babb was at one time a shareholder\r\n  in LRCI, Mearesâ€™ testimony that Babb took an undivided one-third interest in\r\n  the real property in lieu of any interest in LRCI is a more credible\r\n  interpretation of the circumstances surrounding the closing on the Campground\r\n  and production of the deed than that offered by Babb. Â We find no credible testimony\r\n  that Babb and Meares agreed she would receive more than a one-third share in\r\n  the real estate as a means of compensating Mac Babb for his services as\r\n  president.Â  Indeed, she told the court her husband was compensated and he gave\r\n  the compensation to her.Â  However, the record indicates that at her deposition,\r\n  Babb stated she did not know whether Mac Babb ever requested compensation.Â  Mac\r\n  Babb never mentioned that a compensation agreement was reached or that compensation\r\n  was received by him and given to Babb.Â  Rather, when asked whether any\r\n  additional compensation supported Babbâ€™s one-third interest in LRCI, he simply\r\n  answered â€œ[i]t happens all the time.â€\r\nDespite Babbâ€™s argument that any phone call between Meares and Mac\r\n  Babb was insufficient to establish relinquishment of her rights in LRCI, Mac\r\n  Babb represented Babbâ€™s interest as her agent throughout the venture.Â \r\n  â€œApparent authority to do an act is created as to a third person by written or\r\n  spoken words or any other conduct of the principal which, reasonably\r\n  interpreted, causes the third person to believe the principal consents to have\r\n  the act done on his behalf by the person purporting to act for him.â€Â  R&amp;G\r\n    Constr., Inc. v. LowCountry Regional Transp. Authority, 343 S.C. 424, 433,\r\n  540 S.E.2d 113, 118 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Frasier v. Palmetto Homes,\r\n  323 S.C. 240, 473 S.E.2d 865 (Ct. App. 1996)).Â  The elements of apparent agency\r\n  are: (1) purported principal consciously or impliedly represented another to be\r\n  his agent; (2) third party reasonably relied on the representation; and (3) the\r\n  third party detrimentally changed his or her position in reliance on the\r\n  representation.Â  Id.Â  â€œWhen a principal, by any such acts or conduct,\r\n  has knowingly caused or permitted another to appear to be his agent, either\r\n  generally or for a particular purpose, he will be estopped to deny such agency\r\n  to the injury of third persons who have in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable\r\n  prudence dealt with the agent on the faith of such appearances.â€ Â Id. (citing Mortgage &amp; Acceptance Corp. v. Stewart, 142 S.C. 375, 140\r\n  S.E. 804 (1927).Â  Generally, agency is a question of fact and may be implied or\r\n  inferred and proven circumstantially by the conduct of the purported agent\r\n  showing a pretense of authority with the alleged agentâ€™s knowledge.Â  Id.\r\nWe find Mac Babb was an apparent agent of Babb with the authority\r\n  to relinquish her interest in LRCI.Â  Mac Babb testified he â€œhad [] Babbâ€™s\r\n  proxyâ€ in a certain situation, which suggests he was an agent to other matters.Â \r\n  Babb testified she was not involved in the original negotiations carried out at\r\n  the auction and indicated she did not hear Watson, Mac Babb, and Meares\r\n  conversing.Â  Yet, she became an investor despite her lack of involvement.Â \r\n  During this initial discussion concerning the purchase of the Campground and\r\n  formation of LRCI, Babb permitted Mac Babb to represent her interests.Â  From\r\n  this interaction, Respondents reasonably believed Mac Babb had the authority to\r\n  negotiate on behalf of Babb.Â  Specifically, Meares negotiated with Mac Babb\r\n  concerning Babbâ€™s relinquishment of her interest in LRCI in lieu of a one-third\r\n  undivided interest in the real property.Â  He reasonably relied on Mac Babbâ€™s\r\n  assertions in informing closing attorney Martini to deed Babbâ€™s interest\r\n  outside the corporation.Â  Further, Babb ratified Mac Babbâ€™s conduct with her\r\n  letter to Martini instructing, â€œ[t]he deed should identify me as Grantee for my\r\n  portion of this transactionâ€¦.â€Â  \r\nThis Court finds the record demonstrates Babb had full knowledge\r\n  of Mac Babbâ€™s actions concerning the relinquishment of her rights in LRCI.Â &nbsp; Babb\r\n  ratified Mac Babbâ€™s conduct by manifesting her intent to adopt her husbandâ€™s\r\n  actions and accepting the benefits.Â  She requested and was deeded an undivided\r\n  one-third interest in Little River Campground.Â  See Crowley v.\r\n    Harvey &amp; Battey, P.A., 327 S.C. 68, 488 S.E.2d 334 (1997); Anthony\r\n      v. Padmar, Inc., 320 S.C. 424, 465 S.E.2d 737 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  The record\r\n  clearly demonstrates Babb ratified Mac Babbâ€™s actions taken on her behalf and\r\n  their conduct established an agency relationship.\r\nThrough her own actions and those of her agent, Mac Babb, this\r\n  Court affirms the circuit judgeâ€™s conclusion that Babb voluntarily and\r\n  intentionally relinquished her right to a one-third interest in LRCI.\r\nRespondentsâ€™ answer and counterclaim included the equitable\r\n  defense of unclean hands.Â  The doctrine of unclean hands precludes a plaintiff\r\n  from recovering in equity if he acted unfairly in a matter that is the subject\r\n  of the litigation to the prejudice of the defendant.Â  First Union National\r\n    Bank of South Carolina v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 511 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Respondents have clearly raised credibility issues concerning Babbâ€™s\r\n  claims. Â However, this court finds Respondents failed to meet their burden of\r\n  proving Babb acted unfairly in a matter that is the subject of the litigation\r\n  between the parties sufficient to demonstrate â€œunclean hands.â€Â  We decline to\r\n  apply the doctrine of unclean hands to the instant dispute.\r\nConclusion\r\nRespondentsâ€™ counterclaim for a declaratory judgment that Babb was\r\n  not a shareholder of LRCI was determined in the January 4, 2004, circuit court\r\n  order finding it related back to matters originally pleaded and was not barred\r\n  by the statute of limitations.\r\nRespondents proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Babb\r\n  voluntarily and intentionally relinquished her right to a one-third interest in\r\n  the shares of LRCI in return for an undivided one-third interest in the 8.4\r\n  acres known as Little River Campground. Therefore, the order of the circuit\r\n  court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Charles Watson died in 1998 and this litigation has\r\n  proceeded with the Estate of Charles L.

Kelly Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Herbert Lee Bell (Bell) appeals his\r\n  conviction of trafficking in crack cocaine in an amount of more than two\r\n  hundred grams but less than four hundred grams.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  late 2003, police obtained information about possible illegal drug activity in\r\n  a trailer at 5595 Panola Road (â€œ5595â€) in Pinewood, in Sumter County.Â  Based on this information, the police sent a confidential informant wearing a wire to\r\n  5595 on November 12 to purchase drugs. Â The informant purchased a quantity of\r\n  crack cocaine (crack) from Reggie Robinson (Robinson).Â  The next day, an\r\n  informant returned to 5595 and purchased another quantity of crack from\r\n  Alexander Lewis (Lewis).Â  On November 20, the informant made another purchase\r\n  of crack in 5595 from Robinson.Â  On November 25, the informant purchased more\r\n  crack inside 5595 from Robinson.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  a result of their investigation and the prior buys, the police obtained a\r\n  search warrant for 5595 on November 26.Â  Before the warrant was executed, the\r\n  police sent the informant back on December 4 to confirm the presence of drugs.Â \r\n  The informant went to 5595 in the morning, but there was no answer at the\r\n  door.Â  The informant returned to the car where the police were waiting.Â  As\r\n  they drove off down the road, Lewis walked out of another residence across the\r\n  street at 5650 Panola Road (â€œ5650â€).Â  The informant got out of the car and\r\n  talked with Lewis on the driveway of 5595.Â  Lewis told the informant to return\r\n  at another time.Â  The informant returned to 5595 around eleven oâ€™clock, but\r\n  again nobody was home.Â  Lewis came out of 5650 and told him to return at two\r\n  oâ€™clock.Â  Around two oâ€™clock, the informant returned and purchased crack inside\r\n  5595 from Lewis.Â  \r\nA\r\n  few hours later, the police executed the search warrant for 5595.Â  Lewis was\r\n  seized inside the trailer and Robinson was apprehended as he tried to flee out\r\n  the back door.Â  The police subsequently set up a reverse-sting and arrested\r\n  numerous individuals who came to 5595 to purchase drugs.Â  They soon ran out of\r\n  space to park the buyersâ€™ cars, so they ceased the operation.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the search of 5595, the police found a chair by the window near the door.Â \r\n  There was a small sliding match box on the window sill with crack inside.Â  A\r\n  walkie-talkie was near the chair.Â  An aspirin bottle with crack and a jar of\r\n  crack were seized in a bedroom.Â  There was a marijuana pipe in the bedroom with\r\n  trace amounts of crack in it.Â  The total weight of the crack from 5595 was\r\n  74.32 grams.Â  There was no furniture in the trailer other than the chair near\r\n  the door and a mattress on the floor of the bedroom.Â  The bathroom was not\r\n  functional.Â  Officer Angela Barger testified the trailer â€œdoesnâ€™t look like\r\n  itâ€™s actually a lived in residence.Â  It just appears to be used solely for the\r\n  purpose of narcotics.â€Â  An electric bill under the name â€œRacheka Michelle Bellâ€\r\n  was found in the kitchen.Â  An appointment card and a medical receipt for Lewis\r\n  were found in the kitchen.Â  A cash ticket for Bell from a furniture store for a\r\n  roll-away bed was also found in the kitchen.\r\nWhile\r\n  the police were at 5595, other officers proceeded to 5650 to investigate.Â  Bell answered the door.Â  He agreed to accompany them across the street to 5595.Â  The\r\n  police subsequently obtained a search warrant for 5650.\r\nPursuant\r\n  to the search of 5650, the police seized a chair by the window in the living\r\n  room with a clear view of 5595.Â  There was no other furniture inside except for\r\n  a television and a video game system.Â  They found a scanner, binoculars, and a\r\n  walkie-talkie nearby.Â  The kitchen had no dishes, food, or anything which\r\n  indicated somebody lived in the residence.Â  The police discovered a half-gallon\r\n  mason jar in the dishwasher in the kitchen, â€œone third to one half fullâ€ of\r\n  crack.Â  The jar contained 227.03 grams of crack.Â  There were also assorted\r\n  glassware and paraphernalia inside the dishwasher used to make crack.Â  There\r\n  was crack residue on the items.Â  The walkie-talkies at 5650 and 5595 were set\r\n  to the same channel.Â  The police found an insurance card for Bell in a drawer\r\n  in the kitchen.Â  An application for pretrial intervention for Robinson was also\r\n  inside the drawer.Â  Rental agreements for 5595 to Alexander Lewis and for 5650\r\n  to â€œMichael Lewis,â€ dated November 1, 2003, were found in the living room.Â  An\r\n  electric bill to Michael Lewis was found in a bedroom.Â  The mason jar found in\r\n  5650 was dusted for fingerprints.Â  Robinson and Bellâ€™s fingerprints were found\r\n  on it.Â  \r\nBell was served with arrest warrants for manufacturing\r\n  crack and trafficking in crack on December 5, 2003.Â  Bell was released on a\r\n  $70,000 surety bond, and he signed a bond sheet wherein under the heading\r\n  â€œACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY THE DEFENDANT,â€ it indicates: â€œI understand and have been\r\n  informed that I have a right and obligation to be present at trial, and should\r\n  I fail to attend the court, the trial will proceed in my absence.â€Â  \r\nOn\r\n  February 19, 2004, the Sumter County Grand Jury indicted Bell on trafficking in\r\n  crack cocaine in an amount of more than twenty-eight grams but less than one\r\n  hundred grams and for trafficking in crack cocaine more than two hundred grams\r\n  but less than four hundred grams.Â  On March 7, 2006, circuit court Judge\r\n  Clifton Newman proceeded to trial with a jury against Bell on the trafficking\r\n  charge of more than two hundred grams but less than four hundred grams.Â  Bellâ€™s attorney was present and ready for trial, but Bell was not in attendance at the\r\n  trial.Â  The bailiff called his name from the courthouse step three times, but Bell did not respond and present himself for trial.Â  The two-day trial proceeded in Bellâ€™s absence.\r\nDetective\r\n  Allen Dailey explained the amount of crack seized from the mason jar in 5650\r\n  â€œis solely something you would find with a seller, itâ€™s quite a bit of money.â€Â \r\n  Dailey testified the crack was â€œfreshly cutâ€ for sale.Â  Deputy Trevor Brown\r\n  testified the police â€œhardly everâ€ find that much crack at one location.Â  Brown\r\n  further said it was not uncommon for drug dealers to store drugs at one\r\n  location and then sell them from another location.\r\nMack\r\n  McLeod testified he owned both properties.Â  He recalled that shortly before Bellâ€™s arrest, Bell wanted to purchase 5650.Â  He paid rent in cash for it in November.Â \r\n  McLeod said 5595 was rented out by his father (since deceased), but he thought\r\n  Lewis rented it.Â  \r\nAlexander\r\n  Lewis testified for the State.Â  Lewis testified he moved to 5595 with Bell, who is his nephew.Â  He stated Bell paid the rent.Â  Lewis said his brother Michael\r\n  and Robinson also stayed with them on occasion.Â  Lewis testified he sold drugs from\r\n  the trailer.Â  Lewis said the crack was kept in the jar seized by the police.Â \r\n  Lewis claimed he would go through a jar of crack â€œsometimes two times a day.â€Â \r\n  Lewis testified he got the crack from Bell and sold it for him.Â  In return,\r\n  Lewis got crack for his personal use.Â  Lewis said Bell produced the crack in\r\n  5595 and 5650.Â  He stated that Bell had moved to 5650.\r\nRobinson\r\n  also testified for the State.Â  Robinson said he stayed at 5595 â€œoff and on.â€Â \r\n  He and Bell were longtime friends.Â  Robinson testified Bell paid the rent and\r\n  was there â€œall the time.â€Â  He said Alexander and Michael Lewis also stayed\r\n  there.Â  Robinson said he sold drugs from 5595 for Bell.Â  Robinson testified Bell provided the crack and put it in the jars to sell.Â  He said a jar of crack would last\r\n  â€œabout a week, two weeks.â€Â  Robinson gave Bell the money from the sales.Â \r\n  Robinson also testified Bell produced the crack in 5595 and 5650 and they used\r\n  the walkie-talkies to communicate between the residences.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  jury found Bell guilty, and Judge Newman issued a sentence but sealed it until Bell was present.Â  On June 7, 2006, Judge Steven H. John unsealed the sentence in Bellâ€™s presence and sentenced Bell to twenty-five years and a fine of $100,000.Â  Bellâ€™s attorney filed a notice of appeal on June 8, 2006.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in proceeding with Bellâ€™s \r\n\t\t\ttrial in his absence?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in not granting a mistrial \r\n\t\t\twhen the State failed to provide their expertâ€™s fingerprint report?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State\r\n    v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  We are\r\n  bound by the trial court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id. at 388, 577 S.E.2d at 500-01. \r\nOn\r\n  review, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State\r\n    v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 224, 625 S.E.2d 239, 241-242 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  An\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error\r\n  of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000); State\r\n    v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In order for an\r\n  error to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant.Â  See State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536 S.E.2d 679 (2000); see\r\n    also State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 453 S.E.2d 890 (1995).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Trial in absentia\r\nBell argues the trial court erred by proceeding with his\r\n  trial in his absence because he alleges the State failed to prove he had notice\r\n  that his trial would proceed in his absence.Â  We disagree.\r\nBell signed a bond sheet on December 5, 2003, wherein\r\n  under the heading â€œACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY THE DEFENDANT,â€ it indicates: â€œI\r\n  understand and have been informed that I have a right and obligation to be\r\n  present at trial, and should I fail to attend the court, the trial will proceed\r\n  in my absence.â€Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, defense counsel admitted Bell was informed the Friday before that the\r\n  case was going to be tried. Â He did not know where Bell was at the time of the\r\n  trial.Â  Defense counsel then attempted to explain Bellâ€™s failure to appear.Â  He\r\n  noted Bell had been given prior notices of trial and he appeared for trial and\r\n  roll call during several terms of court during the past two years.Â  He surmised\r\n  there were no assurances it would be different this time.Â  He stated â€œhow much\r\n  assurance can an individual know that their case is actually going to trial if\r\n  they have been told 2 or 3 times in the past that itâ€™s going for trial.Â  They\r\n  show up, and it doesnâ€™t.Â  So itâ€™s like crying wolf . . . .â€Â  Defense counsel\r\n  also said Bell had to work and Bell recently told him that he may take a job in\r\n  New Orleans.\r\nBellâ€™s name was then called three times from the\r\n  courthouse steps, but he did not respond.Â  Bell was thereafter tried in his\r\n  absence.Â  \r\nTo\r\n  preserve an issue for review there must be a contemporaneous objection that is\r\n  ruled upon by the trial judge.Â  State v. Johnson, 324 S.C. 38, 476\r\n  S.E.2d 681, 682 (1996).Â  The objection should be addressed to the trial judge\r\n  in a sufficiently specific manner that brings attention to the exact error.Â  State\r\n    v. Prioleau, 345 S.C. 404, 548 S.E.2d 213, 216 (2001); State v.\r\n      Funderburk, 367 S.C. 236, 625 S.E.2d 248, 250 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  If a party\r\n  fails to properly object, the party is procedurally barred from raising the\r\n  issue on appeal.Â  State v. Pauling, 322 S.C. 95, 470 S.E.2d 106, 109\r\n  (1996); see State v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 526 S.E.2d 228 (2000) (party\r\n  may not argue one ground at trial and an alternative ground on appeal); State\r\n    v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 440 S.E.2d 869 (1994) (to preserve error for\r\n  appeallate review, a defendant must make a contemporaneous objection on a\r\n  specific ground); McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327,\r\n  479 S.E.2d 67, 76 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting the appellant failed to â€œpoint to\r\n  specific objections and rulingsâ€ as required by the South Carolina Appellate\r\n  Court Rules, thus leaving the court to â€œâ€˜grope in the darkâ€™ concerning the\r\n  specific allegations of errorâ€); see also State v. Bray, 342 S.C.\r\n  23, 535 S.E.2d 636 (2000) (it is error for an appellate court to consider\r\n  issues not raised to it).\r\nAlthough\r\n  Bellâ€™s counsel objected to the trial in Bellâ€™s absence, he did not\r\n  specifically object on the ground that Bell was not adequately warned the trial\r\n  would proceed in his absence if he failed to appear.Â  Instead, defense counsel\r\n  merely attempted to mitigate Bellâ€™s failure to appear, although he admitted Bell had notice of the trial.Â  Because there was no objection to the trial in Bellâ€™s absence on the ground alleged on appeal, the issue is not preserved for appellate\r\n  review.\r\nBellâ€™s argument also fails on the merits.Â  Although the\r\n  Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right of an\r\n  accused to be present at every stage of his trial, this right may be waived.Â  State\r\n    v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 360 S.E.2d 706, 711 (1987); Ellis v. State,\r\n  267 S.C. 257, 227 S.E.2d 304, 605 (1976).Â  Rule 16 of the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Criminal Procedure provides:\r\n\r\n\t[A]\r\n  person indicted for misdemeanors and/or felonies may voluntarily waive his\r\n  right to be present and may be tried in his absence upon a finding by the court\r\n  that such person has received notice of his right to be present and that a\r\n  warning was given that the trial would proceed in his absence upon a failure to\r\n  attend the court.\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\n  a waiver of such an important right is permitted only in limited\r\n  circumstances.Â  Aiken v. Koontz, 368 S.C. 542, 629 S.E.2d 686, 689 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Therefore, before a defendant may be tried in absentia, the trial judge\r\n  must determine a defendant voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial,\r\n  making findings of fact on the record the defendant (1) received notice of his\r\n  right to be present and (2) was warned the trial would proceed in his absence.Â  Id.\r\nIt\r\n  is well-settled a bond form that provides notice that a defendant can be tried\r\n  in absentia may serve as the requisite notice.Â  State v. Goode, 299 S.C.\r\n  479, 385 S.E.2d 844, 846 (1989); State v. Fairey, 374 S.C. 92, 646\r\n  S.E.2d 445, 449-50 (Ct. App. 2007); Koontz, 629 S.E.2d at 689-90.\r\nIn Koontz, the defendant was arrested for driving with a suspended license,\r\n  and when he posted bond the day after arrest, he was provided an order\r\n  specifying methods and conditions of release.Â  Id., 629 S.E.2d at 689.Â Â \r\n  The defendant also signed a form entitled â€œAcknowledgment by Defendant,â€ which\r\n  read â€œI understand and have been informed that I have a right and obligation to\r\n  be present at trial and should I fail to attend the court, the trial will\r\n  proceed in my absence.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, this Court held Koontz was warned a\r\n  failure to appear would result in a trial in his absence and he understood the\r\n  warning and obligation by signing the acknowledgment.Â  \r\nIn Fairy, the defendant signed a similar bond sheet in 1998.Â  His original\r\n  indictment was dismissed, but he was indicted for the same crime in 2001, and\r\n  the 1998 bond was reinstated in 2002 by court order.Â  This Court held the 1998\r\n  bond was in effect and thereby served as notice to the defendant that he would\r\n  be tried in his absence if he failed to appear.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Bell admits he signed the bond two years before his trial and\r\n  shortly after his arrest.Â  Bell contends he â€œdid not know whether he was going\r\n  to have a trial,â€ because the case was called for trial several times before\r\n  and it did not go to trial.Â  Bell argues he appeared at prior times and his\r\n  having to appear at every term of court interfered with his ability to hold a\r\n  steady job.Â  Bell notes defense counsel did not state that he informed him the\r\n  trial would proceed without him.Â  Bell states there was no evidence he read the\r\n  bond form when he signed it or even that he could read.Â  His arguments are\r\n  without merit.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  the outcome of the prior roll calls in this case, Bell appeared as required.Â \r\n  Clearly, he demonstrated knowledge of his obligation to appear under the terms\r\n  of the bond.Â  Bellâ€™s decision on this particular occasion to ignore the notice\r\n  of trial, simply because he thought the outcome would be similar, does not\r\n  excuse his failure to appear.Â  As in Fairey and Koontz, Bellâ€™s signature on the acknowledgment served as a warning he would be tried in his absence\r\n  if and when his case was called for trial and he failed to appear.Â  Bell clearly understood such a warning and waived his right to be present.Â  Bellâ€™s other arguments go to the credibility of the evidence.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s findings\r\n  were supported by the record and should not be disturbed.Â  \r\nII.Â  Stateâ€™s\r\n  fingerprint expert\r\nBell argues the trial court erred in not granting a\r\n  mistrial when the State failed to provide the fingerprint report.Â  Bell contends he was prejudiced because he was unable to cross-examine the expert\r\n  thoroughly or appropriately without the report and the defense did not have the\r\n  opportunity to hire its own expert to examine the report.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSLED\r\n  Agent Edward Porter was qualified as an expert in fingerprint analysis and\r\n  comparison.Â  Porter testified he received the backers from the mason jar.Â  At\r\n  this point, defense counsel requested a â€œbrief side bar,â€ and counsel conferred\r\n  with the trial judge.Â  Porter then testified he compared the fingerprints\r\n  lifted from the mason jar with known fingerprints of Bell, Robinson, and\r\n  Lewis.Â  Porter was able to match one of Bellâ€™s fingerprints on the jar and two\r\n  of Robinsonâ€™s fingerprints.Â  On cross-examination, Porter testified he sent a\r\n  report of his findings to law enforcement.\r\nAfter\r\n  the State rested its case four witnesses later, defense counsel requested a\r\n  mistrial.Â  He argued he had not previously received the report despite his\r\n  pretrial discovery request.Â  Defense counsel said Bell was prejudiced by not\r\n  having the report, because counsel could not use it in cross-examination and he\r\n  did not have the opportunity to hire an expert to examine the report.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial judge denied the mistrial.Â  He initially noted that although â€œwe had a\r\n  side bar,â€ there was â€œno objectionâ€ to Porterâ€™s testimony.Â  The trial judge\r\n  further determined the failure to turn over the report was harmless because the\r\n  defense was not surprised.Â  He noted defense counsel made a pretrial motion to\r\n  suppress testimony about fingerprints.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  issue is not properly preserved.Â  To preserve an issue for appellate review, a\r\n  contemporaneous objection must be made when the evidence is offered.Â  See State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 498 S.E.2d 642, 644 n.3 (1998) (â€œUnless\r\n  an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling\r\n  made, the issue is not preserved for review.â€); State v. Johnson, 324\r\n  S.C. 38, 41, 476 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1996) (â€œAppellant made no contemporaneous\r\n  objection at trial and did not raise this issue at any point during trial.Â \r\n  Consequently, this issue is not preserved for review.â€).Â  It well-settled a\r\n  failure to contemporaneously object to the introduction of evidence claimed to\r\n  be prejudicial cannot be later bootstrapped by a motion for a mistrial.Â  State\r\n    v. Lynn, 277 S.C. 222, 284 S.E.2d 786 (1981); State v. Moultrie, 316\r\n  S.C. 547, 451 S.E.2d 34 (Ct. App. 1994); State v. Wilkins, 310 S.C. 81,\r\n  425 S.E.2d 68 (Ct. App. 1992); see also State v. Curtis, 356 S.C.\r\n  622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004) (a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve\r\n  error for appellate review); State v. Atchison, 268 S.C. 588, 235 S.E.2d\r\n  294 (1977) (if a party fails to make a proper contemporaneous objection to the\r\n  admission of evidence, he cannot later raise the issue by a motion for a\r\n  mistrial).Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Bell requested a â€œside barâ€ during the testimony of the Stateâ€™s fingerprint\r\n  expert, the trial judge clearly noted there was no objection made at the time\r\n  of the admission of the fingerprint evidence.Â  An objection was not made until\r\n  the close of the Stateâ€™s case four witnesses later when Bell moved for a\r\n  mistrial.Â  Bellâ€™s objection was untimely.Â  \r\nAssuming\r\n  arguendo that defense counsel timely objected to the Stateâ€™s fingerprint expert\r\n  off-the-record, he was nevertheless required to immediately set forth the\r\n  ground for the objection on the record to preserve it for appellate review.Â \r\n  His failure to do so here precludes review.Â  See York v. Conway Ford,\r\n    Inc., 325 S.C. 170, 480 S.E.2d 726, 728 (1997) (an objection made in an\r\n  off-the-record conference but not placed on the record does not preserve the\r\n  issue for appellate review); Hundley v. Rite Aid of S.C., Inc., 339 S.C.\r\n  285, 529 S.E.2d 45, 57 (Ct. App. 2000) (motions must be made on the record to\r\n  be preserved for review by an appellate court).\r\nIn\r\n  any event, Bellâ€™s argument is without merit.Â  â€œâ€˜The power of a court to declare\r\n  a mistrial ought to be used with the greatest caution under urgent\r\n  circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causesâ€™ stated into the record by\r\n  the trial judge.â€Â  State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 573 S.E.2d 856, 862 (Ct. App. 2002); see also State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999) (a mistrial should only be granted in cases of manifest necessity and with\r\n  the greatest caution for very plain and obvious reasons).Â  The granting of a\r\n  motion for a mistrial is an extreme measure which should be taken only where an\r\n  incident is so grievous the prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.Â  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999); State v. Adams,\r\n  354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nA\r\n  mistrial should only be granted when â€œabsolutely necessary,â€ and a defendant\r\n  must show both error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a\r\n  mistrial.Â  Simmons, 573 S.E.2d at 862; see also State v.\r\n    Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999) (a mistrial should not be\r\n  granted unless absolutely necessary; to receive a mistrial, a defendant must\r\n  show error and resulting prejudice).Â  â€œThe less than lucid test is therefore\r\n  declared to be whether the mistrial was dictated by manifest necessity or the\r\n  ends of public justice.â€Â  State v. Prince, 279 S.C. 30, 301 S.E.2d 471,\r\n  472 (1983).Â  â€œWhether a mistrial is manifestly necessary is a fact specific\r\n  inquiry.â€Â  State v. Rowlands, 343 S.C. 454, 539 S.E.2d 717, 719 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nThe\r\n  decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial judge. Â State v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 575 S.E.2d 77 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s decision will not be overturned on appeal absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  State v. Harris, 340\r\n  S.C. 59, 530 S.E.2d 626 (2000); State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d\r\n  63 (1998); see also State v. Arnold, 266 S.C. 153, 157, 221\r\n  S.E.2d 867, 868 (1976) (the general rule of this state is that â€œthe ordering\r\n  of, or refusal of a motion for mistrial is within the discretion of the trial\r\n  judge and such discretion will not be overturned in the absence of abuse thereof\r\n  amounting to an error of lawâ€).Â  \r\nRule\r\n  5 of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the disclosure of\r\n  evidence in criminal cases.Â  Applicable in this case are those provisions of\r\n  Rule 5 which require the disclosure of certain documents, tangible objects, and\r\n  reports of examinations and tests, that are within the possession, custody or\r\n  control of the prosecution, and which are material to the preparation of the\r\n  defendantâ€™s defense or are intended for use by the prosecution as evidence in\r\n  its case-in-chief.Â  Rules 5(a)(1)(C) &amp; (a)(1)(D), SCRCrimP.Â  Evidence is\r\n  deemed material â€œonly if there is a reasonable probability that, had the\r\n  evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have\r\n  been different.â€Â  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689, 693\r\n  (1996); see also State v. Kennerly, 331 S.C. 442, 503 S.E.2d 214,\r\n  220 (Ct. App. 1998) (definition of â€œmaterialâ€ for purposes of Rule 5 is the\r\n  same as definition used in the Brady context), affâ€™d, 337 S.C.\r\n  617, 524 S.E.2d 837 (1999).Â  Any omission â€œmust be evaluated in the context of\r\n  the entire record.â€Â  State v. Wilkins, 310 S.C. 81, 425 S.E.2d 68, 70 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Absent a showing of prejudice suffered by the defendant, such that he is\r\n  deprived of a fair trial, reversal is not required.Â  State v. Trotter,\r\n  322 S.C. 537, 473 S.E.2d 452 (1996).\r\nEven\r\n  if the State failed to comply with Bellâ€™s Rule 5 request, the trial judge had\r\n  the discretion to provide a proper remedy.Â  The exercise of this discretion\r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v.\r\n    Scipio, 283 S.C. 124, 322 S.E.2d 15 (1984); State v. Davis, 309 S.C.\r\n  56, 419 S.E.2d 820 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  It is well-settled that if a party fails\r\n  to comply with the rule, the court â€œmay order such party to permit the\r\n  discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from\r\n  introducing evidence not disclosed, or it may enter such other order as it\r\n  deems just under the circumstances.â€Â  Rule 5(d)(2); see State v. Salisbury, 330 S.C. 250, 498 S.E.2d 655 (Ct. App. 1998), affâ€™d as modified, 343\r\n  S.C. 520, 541 S.E.2d 247 (2001).\r\nHowever,\r\n  this Court need not determine here whether the report in question should have\r\n  been disclosed, since the trial judge properly determined Bell showed no\r\n  prejudice.Â  The record clearly shows defense counsel was aware of the\r\n  fingerprint evidence, as indicated by his pretrial motion to suppress it as the\r\n  â€œfruitâ€ of an illegal arrest.Â  At no time, however, did the defense request a\r\n  continuance or a recess to review the written report or to obtain other experts\r\n  to refute the findings once it was disclosed.Â  See State v. Davis,\r\n  309 S.C. 56, 419 S.E.2d 820 (Ct. App. 1992) (trial judgeâ€™s denial of the suppression\r\n  of defendantâ€™s oral statements because the statements were not disclosed in a\r\n  timely manner was upheld where the defendant did not request a continuance or\r\n  recess to review the prosecutionâ€™s file); see also State v. Mitchell,\r\n  330 S.C. 189, 498 S.E.2d 642 (1998) (issue not preserved when defense counsel\r\n  indicated he might need a recess but never actually requested one).Â  Defense\r\n  counsel was further able to thoroughly cross-examine the Stateâ€™s fingerprint\r\n  expert.Â  Bell has failed to demonstrate there is a reasonable probability the\r\n  result would have been different had the report been disclosed to him earlier.Â \r\n  There was no prejudice and Bell was not deprived of a fair trial.Â  There was no\r\n  abuse of discretion in the denial of a mistrial motion.Â  Davis, 419\r\n  S.E.2d at 825; see State v. Thompson, 276 S.C. 616, 281 S.E.2d\r\n  216 (1981) (the Stateâ€™s failure to disclose does not warrant reversal unless\r\n  the defendant is deprived of a fair trial).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  trial court did not err in proceeding with Bellâ€™s trial in his absence and in\r\n  not granting a mistrial when the state failed to provide their expertâ€™s\r\n  fingerprint report.Â  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-250","title":"Ratliff v.

Ratliff,\r\n  III, DVM, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  James W. Ratliff, III, DVM, petitioned the Administrative Law Court (ALC),\r\n  appealing the order of the South Carolina State Board of Veterinary Medical\r\n  Examiners (the Board).Â  The ALC reversed the Boardâ€™s order.Â  The Board\r\n  appeals.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nDr.\r\n  Ratliff practiced veterinary medicine at the Pet Vac Express in the Greenville area.Â  Ratliff operated Pet Vac Expressâ€™ mobile veterinary clinic on Saturdays.Â \r\n  The Board held a hearing based on a report from a member of the public against three\r\n  veterinarians, including Ratliff.Â  The Board filed a Complaint against the\r\n  veterinarians, alleging, inter alia, the veterinarians failed to ensure that\r\n  vaccines were properly maintained.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  a hearing, the Board concluded Ratliff violated South Carolina Code Section\r\n  40-69-140(12) by not adequately ensuring the vaccines were properly acquired\r\n  and/or maintained.[2]Â \r\n  The Board issued a public reprimand and ordered Ratliff to pay a civil penalty\r\n  of $250.Â  Ratliff appealed to the ALC.Â  On appeal, the ALJ found no substantial\r\n  evidence to support the Boardâ€™s order and reversed.Â  The Board appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) governs\r\n  contested proceedings before the Board.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 40-1-160 (2001) &amp; 40-69-160\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  The standard for judicial review, after an exhaustion of administrative remedies, is also governed by\r\n  the APA. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380\r\n  (Supp. 2007). Â Pursuant\r\n  to the APA, a reviewing court may reverse or modify an agency decision which is either affected by error of law or clearly erroneous\r\n  in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the record.\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(Supp. 2007).Â  Review by an administrative law\r\n  judge, heard in the appellate jurisdiction of the ALC, is governed by this\r\n  standard.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(B)(Supp. 2007).Â  This court, on appeal\r\n  from the ALC in its appellate capacity, applies the same standard of review.Â  See Dorman v. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 350 S.C. 159, 164, 565\r\n  S.E.2d 119, 122 (Ct. App. 2002) (defining scope of review of second appellate\r\n  review).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Board argues\r\n  the ALJ erred in reversing its findings against Ratliff.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 40-69-140(12)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code enables the Board to reprimand a veterinarian for\r\n  â€œengaging in conduct determined by the board to be incompetent or negligent in\r\n  the practice of veterinary medicine.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-69-140(12) (2006)\r\n  (amended by 2006 Act No. 294, Â§ 1, eff. May 31, 2006).[3]Â \r\n  Regulation 120-7.8(c) governs the practice of veterinary medicine relating to\r\n  vaccines and requires that â€œ[t]emperature control shall be maintained for all\r\n  drugs and biologics.â€Â  S.C. Code Reg. 120-7.8(c) (Rev. 1997).\r\nWe find substantial\r\n  evidence to support the Boardâ€™s sanction\r\n  against Ratliff.Â  Ratliff testified that\r\n  he and Tabor â€œpretty muchâ€ knew when the vaccines would arrive based on the\r\n  order date.Â  However, the evidence also indicates the vaccines were sent to a postal delivery site and\r\n  remained there until Tabor took them to her home.Â  At best, the delivery site\r\n  offered only an interior location out of the elements, and there is no evidence\r\n  indicating such an environment would provide the necessary temperature control required\r\n  by Regulation 120-7.8(c).Â  Based on the\r\n  limited record[4] and our limited standard of review in APA cases, we find the ALJ erred in\r\n  reversing the Boardâ€™s findings.Â  Accordingly, the order on appeal is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON, SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral\r\n  argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; The Board dismissed the complaint\r\n  against one of the veterinarians and made findings similar to those made\r\n  against Ratliff as to the third veterinarian. \r\n[3]&nbsp; The Board relied on the prior version of\r\n  the code, section 40-69-140(12) (amended by 2006 Act No. 294, Â§ 1, eff. May 31,\r\n  2006).Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-690-110 (12) (2007).\r\n[4]&nbsp; The Record on Appeal is limited to\r\n  excerpts from the transcript of the proceeding before the Board, and Ratliff failed\r\n  to file a respondentâ€™s brief with this Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-251","title":"Pye v.

Jefferson, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-251\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2008 â€“ Filed May 7, 2008Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tBonnie Travaglio Hunt, of Mt.

Coval, both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This\r\n  is an appeal of an order finding Lee Pyeâ€™s motion for a jury trial on her\r\n  action against a Charleston County magistrate, Mary B. Holmes, and Charleston\r\n  County was untimely made.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Pye contends the circuit court erred by (1) denying her the right to a\r\n  jury trial because the issues raised by the amended pleadings were triable by\r\n  jury, she timely moved to transfer the case to the jury docket, and she\r\n  inadvertently failed to demand a jury trial initially; and (2) refusing to rule\r\n  on her motion to reconsider the order denying a jury trial until after the\r\n  bench trial was concluded.\r\n1.Â  We agree with Holmes that the circuit court properly\r\n  denied Pyeâ€™s motion on the basis it was untimely.Â  Pye filed this complaint in\r\n  September 2003 without requesting a jury trial and amended her complaint in\r\n  October 2003, again without requesting a jury trial.Â  In her initial answer\r\n  filed in January 2004, Holmes asserted multiple defenses, including failure to\r\n  state a claim for which relief could be granted, judicial immunity, sovereign\r\n  immunity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, comparative negligence, and expiration\r\n  of the statute of limitations.Â  Holmes also did not request a jury trial in her\r\n  pleadings.Â  Holmes later moved to amend her answer, and the request was\r\n  granted.Â  In her amended answer, Holmes asserted additional defenses, such as\r\n  sole negligence, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.Â  The amended answer\r\n  also admitted some of the allegations that had been denied in the original\r\n  answer.Â  It was not until May 5, 2006, that Pye formally moved for the case to\r\n  be transferred to the jury roster. \r\nRule\r\n  38 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure governs requests for a jury\r\n  trial as of right and provides a party must serve a demand upon the other party\r\n  in writing not later than ten days after the last pleading addressed to the\r\n  issue or else a jury trial is waived:\r\n\r\n\t(b)\r\n  Demand. Â Any party may demand a\r\n  trial by jury of any issue triable of right by a jury by serving upon the other\r\n  parties a demand therefor in writing at any time after the commencement of the\r\n  action and not later than 10 days after the service of the last pleading\r\n  directed to such issue. Such demand may be endorsed upon a pleading of the\r\n  party.\r\n\t. . . . \r\n\t(d)\r\n      Waiver. Â The failure of a party to serve a demand as\r\n  required by this rule and to file it as required by Rule 5(d) constitutes a\r\n  waiver by him of trial by jury. A demand for trial by jury made as herein\r\n  provided may not be withdrawn without the consent of the parties, except where\r\n  an opposing party is in default under Rule 55(a).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rule 38, SCRCP.\r\nRule 39(b), SCRCP further\r\n  provides:Â  â€œIssues of law and\r\n  issues not demanded for trial by jury as provided in Rule 38 shall be tried by\r\n  the court or may be referred to a master as provided in Rule 53; but,\r\n  notwithstanding the failure of a party to demand a jury in an action in which\r\n  such a demand might have been made of right, the court in its discretion upon motion may order a trial by jury of any or all issues.â€Â  [Emphasis added.]\r\nRule 38(b), SCRCP\r\n  requires a motion to transfer a matter to the jury roster be made not later\r\n  than ten days after the last pleading addressed to the issue.Â  In this case, we\r\n  first note the motion to transfer was made more than ten days after the last\r\n  amended answer and thus did not comply with Rule 38.Â  In addition, Pye admitted\r\n  at the hearing on the motion that she did not comply with the requirements of\r\n  Rule 38.\r\nIn King\r\n  v. Shorter, 291 S.C. 501, 354 S.E.2d 402 (Ct. App. 1987), this court held\r\n  that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a motion to amend\r\n  an answer to assert a counterclaim for unfair trade practices while denying a\r\n  motion to transfer the case to the jury roster.Â  We noted three previous sets\r\n  of pleadings had been filed without a request for a jury trial being made.Â  Id. at 502, 354 S.E.2d at 403.Â  In King, we stated:Â  â€œ[A] litigantâ€™s\r\n  entitlement to a jury trial on the issues presented by an amended pleading,\r\n  when no prior demand for a jury trial has been made, turns on whether the\r\n  amended pleadings create new issues of fact.â€Â  Id. at 503, 354 S.E.2d at\r\n  403.Â  We concluded that the pleadings involved essentially the same facts and\r\n  thus the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to the\r\n  jury calendar.Â  Id. \r\nSimilarly,\r\n  the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in this instance as Pye did not\r\n  formally request a jury trial until the action had been pending for almost\r\n  three years, Pyeâ€™s motion was made, in any event, more than ten days after the\r\n  last pleading addressed to the issue, and the amended pleading involved\r\n  essentially the same facts.Â  Further, Pye expressly conceded that she failed to\r\n  comply with the requirements of Rule 38.Â  In denying the motion, the circuit\r\n  court expressed concern about the delay of the case, the reason for Pyeâ€™s failure\r\n  to request a jury trial, and the prejudice to Holmes in having to prepare for a\r\n  jury trial.Â  Thus, we cannot say the circuit court abused its discretion in\r\n  this instance. \r\n2.Â  As to Pyeâ€™s allegation that the circuit court erred in\r\n  failing to rule on her motion to reconsider until the bench trial was held, an\r\n  order denying a mode of trial is immediately appealable if it denies a mode of\r\n  trial to which the party is entitled.Â  In Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C.\r\n  477, 570 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 2002), we held that an order under Rule 38\r\n  affecting the mode of trial affects substantial rights and must be immediately\r\n  appealed or any alleged error is waived.Â  We concluded the appellantâ€™s appeal\r\n  of the denial of his motion for a jury trial under Rule 38 was untimely and therefore\r\n  could not be considered on appeal because he did not appeal until after the\r\n  trial had already been held.Â  Id. at 490, 570 S.E.2d at 542.Â  However,\r\n  we did consider the appellantâ€™s argument under Rule 39(b) as to whether the\r\n  trial court had erred in failing to grant the motion as a matter of\r\n  discretion.Â  We stated, â€œA decision denying a jury trial based on Rule 39(b) is\r\n  discretionary and not immediately appealable.â€Â  Id. Â We held the\r\n  appellant had shown no abuse of discretion, however, because the trial court\r\n  had denied the request after considering the issues involved, the prejudice to\r\n  the appellant, the timeliness of the request, the docket, and the reason for\r\n  the delay.Â  In addition to the trial courtâ€™s reasons, our court stated we were\r\n  unable to discern any prejudice to the appellant because the legal\r\n  counterclaims had been dismissed in the action.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the case before us, Pye was not entitled to a jury trial as a matter of right\r\n  based on the filing of the amended answer as it was based on essentially the\r\n  same factual allegations.Â  Pye clearly failed to timely demand a jury trial and\r\n  the amended answer did not resurrect this right that had been waived.Â  A mode\r\n  of trial ruling is immediately appealable only if denies a mode of trial to\r\n  which the party is entitled as a matter of right.Â  The matter of a jury trial\r\n  here was an issue committed to the discretion of the circuit court once it was\r\n  waived, and we have found no abuse of discretion in this instance.Â  Because the\r\n  decision on the request for a jury trial was a matter committed to the\r\n  discretion of the court, it was not immediately appealable and Pye has shown no\r\n  error in the timing of the courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-252","title":"Historic Charleston Foundation v.

Taylor, of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This\r\n  action involves collection of a child support arrearage totaling $84,167.71.Â  Denise\r\n  G. Taylor (Mother) appeals the family courtâ€™s order requiring Thomas D. Taylor\r\n  (Father) to repay the arrearage at a rate of $200.00 per month, declining to\r\n  garnish Fatherâ€™s Social Security Disability benefits to pay the arrearage, and\r\n  declining to order Fatherâ€™s arrearage reported to credit reporting agencies.Â \r\n  We Â­Â­Â­Â­Â­affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nFather and Mother divorced in 1997.Â  Mother received custody of\r\n  their two minor daughters, and the family court ordered Father to pay monthly child\r\n  support directly to Mother.[2]Â \r\n  Father quickly fell behind in his child support payments.Â  In 1998 and 2004, Mother\r\n  initiated contempt proceedings in the family court to force Father to pay the arrearage.Â  \r\nIn 1998, the family court found Fatherâ€™s arrearage was $7,968.00, held\r\n  Father in contempt, and sentenced him to thirty days in the county jail unless\r\n  he adhered to the new payment schedule.Â  The family court changed the payment\r\n  schedule from monthly to weekly, required Father to pay support through the\r\n  Clerk of Court rather than directly to Mother, and garnished Fatherâ€™s wages.Â  \r\nOn February 1, 2002, Father sustained a work-related injury.Â \r\n  Father settled his Workerâ€™s Compensation claim for $82,500.00.Â  Father also\r\n  filed a claim for Social Security Disability benefits listing both children as\r\n  dependents.Â  \r\nIn November 2004, the family court found Fatherâ€™s arrearage was\r\n  $82,818.80, held father in contempt, and sentenced him to six months in the\r\n  county jail unless he made payments totaling $41,409.40 to Mother and $750.00\r\n  to Motherâ€™s attorneys by December 15, 2004.Â  The family court reprimanded both\r\n  Father and Mother for failing to route Fatherâ€™s intermittent support payments\r\n  through the Clerk of Court.Â  Furthermore, the family court found the parties\r\n  had agreed not to require Father to pay child support from November 2002\r\n  through 2003, because their older daughter, Holly, had lived with Father during\r\n  that period.Â  The South Carolina Department of Social Services and Department\r\n  of Juvenile Justice took custody of Holly in January 2004.Â  Both parties were\r\n  ordered to pay support for Holly to the Department of Social Services.Â  Mother\r\n  retained custody of the younger child.Â  Because Fatherâ€™s Social Security\r\n  Disability claim was still pending, the family court held the issue of Fatherâ€™s\r\n  child support obligation in abeyance until after resolution of his Social\r\n  Security Disability claim. \r\nFather failed to make the required payments and served the jail\r\n  sentence.Â  In July 2005, the family court continued the hearing on Motherâ€™s\r\n  rule to show cause because Mother was unable to obtain service on Father.Â  In\r\n  November 2005, the family court again continued the hearing in an effort to\r\n  allow both parties to present additional evidence concerning the amount of the\r\n  arrearage. Â \r\nIn January 2006, the family court held a final hearing on Fatherâ€™s\r\n  arrearage.Â  Mother presented her records of Fatherâ€™s payments and of payments\r\n  she had received for the children from the Social Security Administration.Â  Father\r\n  asserted he had made payments in addition to those reflected in Motherâ€™s\r\n  records and had exchanged child support payments for items like tires and\r\n  furniture.Â  However, he failed to present any evidence supporting these\r\n  assertions.Â  Consequently, the family court found Father had made payments\r\n  totaling $28,292.60 since the entry of the initial order of support in 1997.Â  The\r\n  family court also found Father had expended $30,000.00 of his Workerâ€™s\r\n  Compensation settlement to make a down payment on a home titled solely in his sisterâ€™s\r\n  name.Â  Additionally, Father had received a lump-sum payment of $23,516.20 and\r\n  had begun receiving monthly Social Security Disability benefits of $1,291.20\r\n  through December 2005 and $1,343.50 beginning in January 2006.Â  The family\r\n  court awarded Mother interest on the arrears through February 1, 2002, the date\r\n  Father became disabled, and terminated child support as of February 1, 2002,\r\n  because of Fatherâ€™s disability.Â  The family court recalculated Fatherâ€™s\r\n  arrearage as $84,167.71 and required Father to repay this amount in monthly\r\n  increments of $200.00. Â \r\nMother filed a motion to reconsider seeking rulings on her request\r\n  for garnishment of Fatherâ€™s Social Security Disability benefits, her request\r\n  for an order requiring Fatherâ€™s arrearage to be reported to credit bureaus, and\r\n  other issues.Â  In August 2006, the family court found Father had failed to pay\r\n  anything under the new schedule.Â  The family court held Father in contempt\r\n  again and sentenced him to ninety days in the county jail unless he paid Mother\r\n  $1,200.00 by the end of the next day.Â  The family court denied Motherâ€™s motion\r\n  for reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed.[3]Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  question of child support is largely within the discretion of the family court,\r\n  whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â Hopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 305, 540 S.E.2d 454, 456&nbsp;(2000).Â  An\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the court is controlled by some error of law or\r\n  where the order, based upon the findings of fact, is without evidentiary\r\n  support. Â Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1996). Â An appellate court will reverse a manifest abuse of discretion\r\n  where the error of law is â€œso opposed to the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion as\r\n  to amount to a deprivation of the legal rights of the party.â€Â  Jeter v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp.,\r\n  369 S.C. 433, 438, 633 S.E.2d 143, 145-46 (2006).Â  The term â€œabuse of\r\n  discretionâ€ does not reflect negatively on the trial court; rather, it merely\r\n  indicates the appellate court believes an error of law occurred in the\r\n  circumstances at hand.Â  Macauley v. Query, 193 S.C. 1, 5, 7 S.E.2d 519,\r\n  521 (1940).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Repayment\r\n  ScheduleÂ  \r\nMother\r\n  asserts the family court erred in ordering Father to repay the $84,167.71\r\n  arrearage in increments of $200.00 per month, because repayment at this rate\r\n  would span approximately thirty-five years.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  family court has exclusive jurisdiction . . . to determine the manner in which\r\n  sums ordered paid for support shall be paid and applied.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-420(A)(21) (Supp. 2007).Â  However, â€œ[e]quity will always endeavor to\r\n  provide a remedy where one has a right violated.â€Â  Matheson v. McCormac,\r\n  186 S.C. 93, 100, 195 S.E. 122, 125 (1938).\r\nThe\r\n  family court erred in requiring Father to repay a child support obligation\r\n  totaling more than $84,000.00 at a rate of only $200.00 per month when he\r\n  possessed the means to pay more.Â  Father began receiving $1,343.50 per month in\r\n  Social Security Disability benefits beginning in January 2006.Â  No evidence\r\n  exists that this income supported anyone other than himself.Â  Father stated it was\r\n  his only income.[4]Â \r\n  The $200.00 payment ordered by the family court, and ignored by Father, was a\r\n  mere fifteen percent of this monthly benefit.Â  Moreover, as Mother argues, even\r\n  faithful repayment at this rate would take more than thirty-five years.Â  The\r\n  children supported by this order would be more than fifty years old before\r\n  repayment was complete.Â  Where Father has the means to pay more, we view this\r\n  rate as an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nFatherâ€™s\r\n  monthly payment toward the arrearage should increase to an amount that will\r\n  enable him to repay his child support obligation as quickly as possible while\r\n  still providing for his own needs.Â  Mother argues in favor of an order\r\n  requiring Father to pay sixty-five percent of his Social Security Disability\r\n  benefit, or approximately $873.00 per month, toward this debt.Â  While this rate\r\n  would shrink the term of Fatherâ€™s repayment to approximately eight years, it\r\n  would leave Father unable to provide for his own needs. Â Father testified that\r\n  although he paid $30,000 toward the purchase of the home he occupied, he paid\r\n  rent of $984.00 per month on that home rather than a mortgage.Â  Father\r\n  testified to approximately $200.00 in monthly living expenses, not including\r\n  rent, food, transportation, or insurance.Â  However, we are unable to determine\r\n  the total amount of Fatherâ€™s current monthly living expenses.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  look to the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines (Guidelines) for assistance\r\n  in determining a fair and adequate amount to set aside to meet Fatherâ€™s needs.[5]Â \r\n  The Guidelines recognize a self support reserve of $748.00 per month to ensure\r\n  the obligor â€œhas sufficient income available to maintain a minimum standard of\r\n  livingâ€ and provide for himself.Â  S.C. Code Regs. Â§&nbsp;114-4720(A)(11) (Supp.\r\n  2007).Â  Setting aside this amount as the minimum necessary to meet Fatherâ€™s own\r\n  needs, Father realizes a monthly surplus of $595.50.Â  We believe Father should be\r\n  able to repay his support obligation at a rate of $350.00 per month. \r\nII.&nbsp; Garnishment\r\nMother\r\n  asserts the family court erred in declining to order garnishment of Fatherâ€™s\r\n  Social Security Disability benefits.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  income of a child support obligor â€œis subject to immediate withholding as of\r\n  the effective date of the order without the requirement that an arrearage\r\n  accumulateâ€ unless the parties agree or a court finds good cause not to order\r\n  the income withheld.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1315(B)(1) (Supp. 2007).Â  The\r\n  amount of income withheld must comply with limits enunciated in the Federal\r\n  Consumer Credit Protection Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1315(F)(2)(b) (Supp.\r\n  2007).Â  Under the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act, where an obligor is\r\n  not supporting either a spouse or a dependent child who is not the subject of\r\n  the support order, and where the support has been owed for more than twelve\r\n  weeks, the maximum weekly income subject to withholding for payment of a\r\n  support order is sixty-five percent.Â  15 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1673(b)(2) (West 1998).Â  Moneys\r\n  payable by the United States government to an individual as â€œremuneration for\r\n  employmentâ€ are subject to withholding to satisfy support orders.Â  42 U.S.C.A. Â§\r\n  659(a) (West Supp. 2007).Â  Moneys subject to withholding include those â€œamounts\r\n  payable on account of personal services performed by the individual or any\r\n  other individual,â€ such as Social Security Disability benefits.Â  42 U.S.C.A. Â§\r\n  659(h)(1)(A) (West Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court erred in failing to order garnishment of Fatherâ€™s Social Security\r\n  Disability benefits.Â  Clearly, under South Carolina and federal law, Fatherâ€™s Social\r\n  Security Disability income is subject to withholding to satisfy his child\r\n  support obligation.Â  Section 20-7-1315(B)(1) creates a presumption in favor of garnishment,\r\n  with the obligor bearing the resultant burden of proving why the family court\r\n  should refrain from withholding his income.Â  In the matter at hand, we find\r\n  Father has failed to show good cause for the family court not to order his support\r\n  payments withheld from income.Â  On the contrary, Fatherâ€™s record of non-payment\r\n  militates strongly in favor of garnishment.Â  Father disposed of his Workerâ€™s\r\n  Compensation and Social Security Disability lump-sum payments totaling more\r\n  than $100,000 without diverting any of those funds to satisfy his child support\r\n  obligation.Â  Furthermore, Father failed to make a single payment under the\r\n  family courtâ€™s final order.Â  The family court sentenced Father to jail on three\r\n  separate occasions for his repeated failure to honor his support obligation.Â  In\r\n  light of Fatherâ€™s refusal to honor the family courtâ€™s previous orders, we see\r\n  no likelihood he will voluntarily comply in the future.Â  In the absence of a\r\n  written agreement or a showing to the contrary, the family court abused its\r\n  discretion in failing to order garnishment of Fatherâ€™s Social Security\r\n  Disability benefits.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Credit Reporting\r\n  Agencies\r\nMother\r\n  asserts the family court erred in declining to order that Fatherâ€™s arrearage be\r\n  reported to credit reporting agencies.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nFederal\r\n  law requires each State to enact laws establishing procedures for periodically\r\n  reporting to â€œconsumer reporting agenciesâ€ the names of noncustodial parents\r\n  delinquent in paying child support, as well as the amounts unpaid.Â  42 U.S.C.A.\r\n  Â§ 666(a)(7) (Supp. 2007).Â  In South Carolina, the Department of Social Services\r\n  â€œprovide[s] consumer credit reporting agencies an automated monthly report of\r\n  obligors in Title IV-D cases who have an arrearage in an amount of one thousand\r\n  dollars or greater.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 43-5-585(A) (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nMother\r\n  relies on federal law to support her assertion that the family court erred in\r\n  declining to order Fatherâ€™s arrearage reported to credit reporting agencies.Â \r\n  Motherâ€™s reliance on that law is misplaced.Â  The federal statute required States\r\n  to enact laws establishing certain administrative procedures to ease interstate\r\n  collection of child support arrearages as a condition to the Statesâ€™ receiving\r\n  federal moneys for children and families.Â  The South Carolina Legislature\r\n  complied with this mandate by enacting section 43-5-585(A), under which the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Social Services reports arrearages in certain\r\n  interstate child support cases to credit reporting agencies monthly.Â  The\r\n  family court does not enact laws on behalf of the State and therefore is not\r\n  bound to fashion its orders in compliance with this statute.Â  S.C. Const. Art.\r\n  I, Â§ 8.Â  Consequently, the family court did not err in declining to order\r\n  Fatherâ€™s arrearage reported.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs to the issue of\r\n  the rate at which Father shall repay his child support arrearage, we find the\r\n  family court erred in setting Fatherâ€™s rate of repayment at $200.00 per month.Â \r\n  We find Father is capable of paying $350.00 per month.Â  Accordingly, we modify\r\n  the order of the family court to require Father to repay his child support\r\n  arrearage at a rate of $350.00 per month.Â  \r\nAs to the issue of\r\n  garnishment of Fatherâ€™s monthly Social Security Disability benefits, we find\r\n  the family court erred in declining to issue an order to withhold Fatherâ€™s\r\n  income.Â  Father has demonstrated a blatant disregard for the orders of the\r\n  family court and will not likely repay his obligation voluntarily.Â \r\n  Consequently, we reverse the order of the family court on this issue and remand\r\n  to the family court with instructions to issue an order requiring withholding\r\n  of the amount of Fatherâ€™s monthly payment toward his child support arrearage.\r\nAs to the issue of\r\n  reporting Fatherâ€™s arrearage to credit reporting services, we find the family\r\n  court did not err.Â  South Carolina law requires that child support arrearages\r\n  collected through the South Carolina Department of Social Services be reported\r\n  to credit reporting services on a monthly basis.Â  However, no such law compels\r\n  the family court to report arrearages.Â  Therefore, we affirm the order of the\r\n  family court on this issue.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  order of the family court in this matter is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS,\r\n  JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The family court ordered Father to pay $2,500.00 per\r\n  month for the first five months, then $1,110.00 per month thereafter.Â  \r\n[3] Father did not file a respondentâ€™s brief in this\r\n  matter.Â  â€œUpon the failure of respondent to timely file a brief, the appellate\r\n  court may take such action as it deems proper.â€Â  Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR.Â  \r\n[4] We acknowledge Motherâ€™s argument that federal law\r\n  would permit Father to earn additional income up to $900.00 per month without\r\n  reducing his Social Security Disability benefit.Â  However, no evidence\r\n  indicates Father has been able to work for more than a few weeks since he\r\n  became disabled.Â  We therefore decline to impute employment income to him for\r\n  purposes of determining an appropriate rate of repayment.Â  \r\n[5] The family court discontinued Fatherâ€™s support order\r\n  due to his disability, and the child support arrearage is no longer\r\n  accumulating.Â  Ongoing child support is no longer an issue in this matter, and\r\n  therefore, the Guidelines are not mandatory in this matter.Â  However, we\r\n  believe the Guidelinesâ€™ self support reserve, calculated to protect obligor\r\n  parents, aids us in establishing a baseline income amount to provide for\r\n  Fatherâ€™s own needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-256","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia;\r\n  and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Ted\r\n  Dean Hatcher appeals his conviction for assault and battery with intent to kill\r\n  (ABWIK), alleging the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on the\r\n  lesser included offense of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature\r\n  (ABHAN).Â  We reverse and remand.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHatcher was charged with ABWIK against\r\n  Cedrick Lyles after Hatcher shot Lyles while Lyles was stopped in his car in\r\n  front of Hatcherâ€™s trailer.Â  Hatcher claimed he thought he saw Lyles reaching\r\n  for a weapon and shot off his gun in self defense.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Hatcher testified that he bought crack cocaine from Lyles the night\r\n  before the shooting.Â  When Hatcher returned home that night, roughly thirty\r\n  minutes later, he saw a car parked outside his trailer with its inside lights\r\n  on.Â  As he drove closer, he saw Lyles run from the back of the car and jump in\r\n  his driverâ€™s side door.Â  Hatcherâ€™s girlfriend, Ferrin Brown, was standing at the\r\n  back of the car crying.Â  Lyles asked Hatcher to get in the car and talk.Â  He\r\n  told Hatcher that Brown loved Hatcher and would never â€œdo nothing behind\r\n  [Hatcherâ€™s] back.â€Â  Lyles said he knew the two had been arguing and wanted to\r\n  help them work through their problems.Â  Hatcher got out of the car and Lyles\r\n  followed him into the trailer.Â  \r\nInside,\r\n  Brown was sitting in the bathroom crying.Â  Lyles said he was going to help them\r\n  â€œtalk through this,â€ but Hatcher told him he did not need help and asked Lyles to\r\n  leave.Â  After Lyles left, Hatcher went back to Brown, slapped her, and asked\r\n  her what was going on.Â  Eventually, Brown told him that she had been raped but\r\n  refused to go to the hospital.Â  \r\nHatcher\r\n  testified that he called Lyles several times the next day and told him he knew\r\n  what had happened the night before and he was going to â€œwhoop his ass.â€Â  Lyles\r\n  said he would come by Hatcherâ€™s house and â€œtake care of you both.â€Â  Hatcher\r\n  testified he thought Lyles was going to shoot him and Brown, so he borrowed a\r\n  gun from a friend for protection.Â  He also said he knew Lyles carried a gun and\r\n  had seen him with a weapon two weeks earlier.Â  \r\nHatcher\r\n  testified when Lyles arrived later that day, Lyles stopped his car and said\r\n  â€œwhatâ€™s up.â€ Â Hatcher then saw him â€œlean forward in his driverâ€™s seat and reach\r\n  like this.â€Â  Hatcher said he thought Lyles was reaching for a gun, so, without\r\n  taking aim, Hatcher began to shoot.Â  After firing the gun, Lyles put his foot\r\n  on the gas and drove straight into the woods.Â  Hatcher ran back to his trailer\r\n  and told his father what happened.Â  Hatcher left his trailer, threw the gun in\r\n  the lake, and went to his brotherâ€™s house where the police found him the next\r\n  day. Â \r\nAccording to Lyles, Hatcher called and told him to come by the\r\n  trailer. Hatcher told Lyles that he needed to talk and he had something for him.\r\n  Â As Lyles approached Hatcherâ€™s house, he saw him about 50 yards from his\r\n  driveway.Â  Lyles pulled over, rolled down his window, and greeted Hatcher.Â \r\n  Lyles testified Hatcher accused him of messing with Brown and began shooting.Â  Lyles\r\n  was shot several times, sustaining gunshot wounds to his left upper abdomen,\r\n  left eye, left neck, and left shoulder.Â  Lyles lost control of his car and it\r\n  veered off the road.Â  Lyles claimed Hatcher went through his pockets and then\r\n  ran from the scene.Â  Lyles got out of the car and managed to walk until an officer\r\n  saw him in the street covered in blood.Â  \r\nAt trial, Hatcher requested the judge charge the jury on ABHAN as\r\n  a lesser-included offense of ABWIK.Â  The judge stated that he would not charge\r\n  the lesser-included offense because â€œthere wasnâ€™t any fist and there wasnâ€™t\r\n  anything else other than a .38 shot five times.â€Â  He concluded, â€œeither he\r\n  acted in self-defense or intent to kill the guyâ€ and refused to charge ABHAN.Â  The\r\n  judge charged the jury with ABWIK, possession of a weapon during the commission\r\n  of a crime, and the defense of self-defense.Â  The jury found Hatcher guilty of\r\n  ABWIK and possession of a firearm. Â The judge sentenced Hatcher to twenty years\r\n  for ABWIK and five years for possession of a firearm.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIf any evidence supports a jury charge,\r\n  the trial judge should grant the request.Â  State v. Brown, 362 S.C. 258, 262, 607 S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct. App. 2004)Â \r\n  Â The law to be charged is determined from the evidence presented at trial.Â  State\r\n    v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 231, 625 S.E.2d 239, 245 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  â€œDue process requires that a lesser\r\n  included offense be charged when the evidence warrants it but only if the\r\n  evidence would permit a jury rationally to find the defendant guilty of the\r\n  lesser offense.â€Â  State v. Small, 307 S.C. 92, 94, 413 S.E.2d 870, 871\r\n  (Ct. App. 1992).Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, this court sits to review only errors of law.Â  State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 525, 608 S.E.2d 435, 438 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Â â€œTo\r\n  warrant reversal, a trial court's refusal to give a requested jury charge must\r\n  be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.â€ Â Patterson, 367\r\n  S.C. at 232, 625 S.E.2d at 245.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nHatcher\r\n  argues the trial judge erred by refusing to charge the jury on ABHAN.Â  We agree.\r\nInitially, we address the Stateâ€™s contention that Hatcher failed\r\n  to preserve this issue for appeal because he offered a â€œbare bonesâ€ jury charge\r\n  and did not object to the trial judgeâ€™s jury instructions.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn State v. Johnson, the South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n  clarified it is â€œthe long-standing rule that where a party requests a jury\r\n  charge and, after opportunity for discussion, the trial judge declines the\r\n  charge, it is unnecessary, to preserve the point on appeal, to renew the\r\n  request at conclusion of the courtâ€™s instruction.â€Â  333 S.C. 62, 64 n.1, 508\r\n  S.E.2d 29, 30 n.1 (1998).Â  The court reiterated the rule because it found its\r\n  earlier decision in State v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683 (1996)\r\n  was misinterpreted.Â  Whipple was being read as indicating that where a\r\n  partyâ€™s jury charge objections or requests are denied on the record after a\r\n  pre-charge conference, the party must renew those objections or requests\r\n  subsequent to the court's instructions to the jury.Â  Id.Â  In Johnson,\r\n  the court explained because there was no on-the-record discussion regarding\r\n  whether the judge would give Whippleâ€™s jury charge, there was no on-the-record\r\n  ruling as to whether the court would give a certain charge.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Therefore, Whipple failed to preserve the issue by failing to object to the\r\n  judgeâ€™s charge as given.Â  Id.Â  Conversely, the court found Johnsonâ€™s\r\n  request to charge was denied on-the-record after an opportunity for\r\n  discussion.Â  Therefore, the court found Johnson was not required to renew his\r\n  request at the conclusion of the charge. Â Id. \r\nAs in Johnson, Hatcher made an on-the-record request for an\r\n  ABHAN charge.Â  The court afforded an opportunity for discussion, eliciting discussion\r\n  from both Hatcher and the Solicitor.Â  After the discussion, the trial judge\r\n  stated, â€œIâ€™m not going to charge the lesser included offense.â€Â  The judge\r\n  proceeded to charge the jury on ABWIK, possession of a weapon during the commission of a crime, and the\r\n  defense of self-defense.Â  We\r\n  find Hatcher was not required to renew his request at the conclusion of the\r\n  charge and therefore, this issue is preserved for our review.Â  Â Â Â \r\nWe next address\r\n  whether the trial judge erred in refusing to charge the lesser included offense\r\n  of ABHAN.Â  ABWIK is an unlawful act of a violent nature to the person of\r\n  another with malice aforethought, either express or implied.Â  State v. Foust,\r\n  325 S.C. 12, 14, 479 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1996).Â  Malice is a required element of\r\n  ABWIK.Â  State v. Kinard, 373 S.C. 500, 504, 646 S.E.2d 168, 170 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007).Â  With the exception of the death of the victim, each element of\r\n  murder must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order for a jury to convict\r\n  a defendant of ABWIK.Â  Kinard at 503, 646 S.E.2d at 169.Â  Malice\r\n  aforethought, which encompasses acts committed with extreme recklessness, satisfies\r\n  the general intent required for a conviction of ABWIK.Â  Id. at 505-06,\r\n  646 S.E.2d at 170.\r\nOn the other hand, ABHAN is an unlawful act of violent injury accompanied by circumstances of\r\n  aggravation.Â  State v. Fennell, \r\n  340 S.C. 266, 274, 531 S.E.2d 512, 516 (2000)Â  Circumstances of aggravation\r\n  include the use of a deadly weapon, infliction of serious bodily injury, intent\r\n  to commit a felony, great disparity between the ages and physical conditions of\r\n  the parties involved, and a difference in the sexes. Â Id. at 274, 531\r\n  S.E.2d at 516-17.Â  The absence of malice is not a required element of ABHAN,\r\n  and the fact that a defendant acts with malice does not preclude a finding of\r\n  ABHAN.Â  State v. Tyler, 348 S.C. 526, 530-31, 560 S.E.2d 888, 890\r\n  (2002). Â \r\nIn\r\n  determining whether the evidence required the judge to charge the jury on\r\n  ABHAN, this court must view the facts in the light most favorable to the\r\n  defendant.Â  See State v. Byrd, 323 S.C. 319, 321, 474\r\n  S.E.2d 430, 431 (1996).Â  In this case, examining the evidence in a light most\r\n  favorable to Hatcher, a jury could conclude that he is guilty of only ABHAN.Â  Hatcher\r\n  testified that he stood 3-4 feet away from Lyles car and did not aim when he\r\n  shot the gun.Â  He then stated he initially did not know whether he hit Lyles\r\n  because he did not aim the gun at Lyles, rather he just pulled the gun and\r\n  fired it.Â  Further, Lyles sustained gunshot wounds to various parts of his\r\n  body, indicating Hatcher may have simply been shooting in Lylesâ€™ direction in\r\n  an attempt at self preservation whether legally justified or not.Â  While the\r\n  jury ultimately rejected the issue of self-defense, that determination is not\r\n  dispositive of the issue.Â  Furthermore, while the evidence in this case may\r\n  give rise to an inference the shooting was committed with malice, the inference\r\n  is a permissive one which the jury is free to accept or reject.Â  See State\r\n    v. Pilgrim, 320 S.C. 409, 415 n.3, 465 S.E.2d 108, 112 n.3 (Ct. App. 1995), overruled on other grounds by State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479\r\n  S.E.2d 50 (1996).Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  because there is evidence to support an ABHAN instruction, we find the trial\r\n  judge erred in failing to charge the lesser-included offense of ABHAN and that\r\n  the appellant was prejudiced by this error. Â Furthermore,\r\n  in reversing Hatcherâ€™s ABWIK conviction, we must also reverse the conviction\r\n  for possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime because\r\n  the former conviction is a prerequisite to the latter.Â  E.g., S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-23-490(E) (2003) (noting the additional punishment for possession of\r\n  a firearm during the commission of a violent crime may not be imposed unless\r\n  the defendant is convicted of the underlying violent crime); State v. Taylor, 356 S.C. 227, 235 n.4, 589 S.E.2d 1, 5 n.4 (2003) (noting defendant's\r\n  conviction for possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime\r\n  must be reversed where the court was reversing defendant's murder conviction). Â Based\r\n  on the foregoing, Hatcherâ€™s convictions are hereby\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-257","title":"Bell v.

Shupe, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General R. Westmoreland Clarkson, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this commitment action under the Sexually Violent Predator Act (Act)[1], Roger Dale McCoy appeals the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s allowance of certain testimony by the Stateâ€™s expert witness.Â  McCoy\r\n  contends the testimony was irrelevant, was unfairly prejudicial, and improperly brought into issue the character of his\r\n  expert witness. Â We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMcCoy pled guilty to two counts of first-degree criminal sexual\r\n  conduct and one count of indecent exposure.Â  He was incarcerated for those crimes\r\n  in 1998.Â  In 2004, pursuant to the Act, the South Carolina Department of\r\n  Corrections (Department) assessed McCoy and determined he was a sexually\r\n  violent predator as defined by section 44-48-30 of the South Carolina Code.Â \r\n  The Department then petitioned the circuit court to order a formal evaluation\r\n  of McCoy and, if a jury determined he was a sexually violent predator under the\r\n  Act, to commit McCoy to the custody of the South Carolina Department of Mental\r\n  Health for care and treatment until he could safely re-enter society.Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit court found probable cause existed for McCoyâ€™s\r\n  continued detention and ordered McCoy evaluated.Â  On June 21, 2005, the circuit\r\n  court tried the issue of whether McCoy should be committed as a sexually\r\n  violent predator.Â  During the trial, McCoy cross-examined the Stateâ€™s expert\r\n  witness, Dr. Pamela Crawford, as to her expert opinion. McCoy then presented\r\n  attorney Larry Crane, who testified Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony in McCoyâ€™s trial\r\n  differed from her testimony in prior sexually violent predator trials.Â  During\r\n  Dr. Crawfordâ€™s rebuttal testimony, McCoy questioned whether she had referred a\r\n  serial rapist to the defense expert, Dr. Thomas Martin, and attorney Crane.Â  Dr.\r\n  Crawfordâ€™s affirmative response included statements that Dr. Martin was â€œ[a]\r\n  doctor who had a very liberal sense of letting people goâ€ and â€œwho lets people\r\n  go and is known in the community for letting people go when theyâ€™re very\r\n  dangerous.â€Â  Dr. Crawford further stated she had recommended Dr. Martin and\r\n  Crane to the other patient because she believed they were the people most\r\n  likely to â€œget [him] off.â€Â  McCoy objected to these statements.Â  Although the\r\n  circuit court stopped Dr. Crawford from testifying as to the details of another\r\n  case in which Crane represented a sexually violent predator, it permitted Dr.\r\n  Crawford to continue her testimony regarding Dr. Martin and Crane and allowed\r\n  McCoy to question Dr. Crawford further.Â  \r\nThe jury ultimately found McCoy was a sexually violent predator.Â \r\n  The circuit court ordered McCoy committed to the Department of Mental Health for\r\n  long-term treatment upon completion of his sentence.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  admission of evidence is within the discretion of the circuit court and will\r\n  not be reversed by an appellate court absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State\r\n    v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467&nbsp;(2000).Â  A circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of an expertâ€™s testimony constitutes an\r\n  abuse of discretion when the ruling is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or\r\n  unfair.Â  Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609\r\n  S.E.2d 506, 509&nbsp;(2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMcCoy\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in allowing Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony concerning Dr.\r\n  Martin.Â  McCoy contends the testimony was irrelevant, was unfairly prejudicial,\r\n  and improperly brought into issue Dr. Martinâ€™s character.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nI. Relevance\r\nMcCoyâ€™s\r\n  objection to Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony as irrelevant is unpersuasive.Â  â€œâ€˜Relevant\r\n  evidenceâ€™ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact\r\n  that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less\r\n  probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  â€œA witness\r\n  may be cross-examined on any matter relevant to any issue in the case,\r\n  including credibility.â€Â  Rule 611, SCRE.Â  A witness may be re-examined and\r\n  cross-examined to rebut the testimony of another witness.Â  Id.Â  Any\r\n  party may impeach a witness.Â  Rule 607, SCRE.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  Rule 401, Dr. Crawfordâ€™s credentials, expert opinion, and credibility were all\r\n  relevant to the question of whether McCoy fit the criteria of a sexually\r\n  violent predator under the Act.Â  As an expert witness, Dr. Crawford offered\r\n  expert testimony on which the jury could choose to rely in making its decision.Â \r\n  McCoyâ€™s first cross-examination of Dr. Crawford elicited her credentials and tested\r\n  her expert opinion.Â  After examining attorney Crane regarding Dr. Crawfordâ€™s\r\n  testimony at prior trials, McCoy attempted to use his second cross-examination\r\n  of Dr. Crawford to diminish her credibility.Â  During this second encounter,\r\n  McCoy questioned whether Dr. Crawford had referred another patient to Dr.\r\n  Martin and attorney Crane.Â  Dr. Crawford answered and explained why she had\r\n  made the referral.Â  The circuit court maintained control over the interrogation\r\n  of Dr. Crawford, stopping her answer when it no longer pertained to the\r\n  question and exercising appropriate discretion by allowing Dr. Crawford to\r\n  explain her answer.Â  Because Dr. Crawfordâ€™s statements were relevant, the\r\n  circuit court did not abuse its discretion in admitting her testimony.Â  \r\nII. Unfair Prejudice\r\nMcCoyâ€™s\r\n  argument that even if Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony was relevant, it nevertheless was\r\n  unfairly prejudicial, is equally unsuccessful.Â  Otherwise relevant evidence\r\n  â€œmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\r\n  danger of unfair prejudice.â€Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  To warrant reversal based on the\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence, the complaining party must prove both the\r\n  error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice.&nbsp; Fields, 363 S.C. at\r\n  26, 609 S.E.2d at 509.Â  To show prejudice, reasonable probability must exist\r\n  that the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack\r\n  thereof.&nbsp; Id.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, McCoy fails to prove prejudice.Â  McCoy asserts Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony\r\n  implied Dr. Martinâ€™s â€œprofessional opinion was for saleâ€ and the State\r\n  â€œexploitedâ€ this testimony in closing argument.Â  However, the trial transcript\r\n  supports neither assertion.Â  Dr. Crawfordâ€™s assessment of Dr. Martin as a\r\n  doctor with a â€œvery liberal sense of letting people goâ€ recognized the doctorsâ€™\r\n  opinions differed vastly without impugning Dr. Martinâ€™s integrity as an honest\r\n  practitioner.Â  In closing argument, both parties attempted to â€œspinâ€ Dr.\r\n  Crawfordâ€™s statements in a light favorable to their respective positions.Â \r\n  McCoy ridiculed Dr. Crawfordâ€™s reasoning for her referral as â€œpreposterous.â€Â \r\n  The State characterized it as honesty and â€œgood faith.â€Â  Neither party\r\n  insinuated this testimony condemned Dr. Martin.Â  The trial transcript simply\r\n  does not support an inference of reasonable probability that the disputed\r\n  testimony influenced the jury.Â  Therefore, the circuit court did not err in\r\n  admitting Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony.\r\nIII.Â  Hearsay\r\nDuring\r\n  cross-examination of Dr. Crawford, McCoy objected to her testimony, stating,\r\n  â€œAnd itâ€™s hearsay about Dr. Martinâ€™s reputation in the community.â€Â  This argument\r\n  is also meritless.Â  With limited exceptions, â€œ[e]vidence of a personâ€™s\r\n  character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving\r\n  action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion.â€Â  Rule 404(a), SCRE. Â McCoy\r\n  seems to argue on appeal Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony was offered as evidence â€œthat\r\n  the defense expert may have been mistaken in an unrelated case.â€Â  However,\r\n  McCoy, and not the State, elicited this testimony from Dr. Crawford.Â  Neither\r\n  the State nor Dr. Crawford offered this testimony â€œfor the purpose of proving\r\n  action in conformityâ€ with a trait of Dr. Martinâ€™s character, but rather for\r\n  the purpose of explaining the bases of Dr. Crawfordâ€™s decision to make a\r\n  referral brought into issue by McCoy himself.Â  Consequently, Rule 404(a) does\r\nnot apply, and the circuit court did not err in admitting this testimony.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court did not err in admitting Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony concerning her\r\n  decision to refer another patient to Dr. Martin.Â  With her credibility under\r\n  attack, Dr. Crawford explained the bases for her decision to make the referral,\r\n  and no prejudice resulted.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  PIEPER, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C.

Â Alltel moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â \r\n  The magistrateâ€™s court dismissed the action after Alltel helped to remove\r\n  past-due mobile phone charges from Kemppinenâ€™s credit history. \r\nKemppinen timely filed a notice of appeal with the circuit court,\r\n  but failed to serve Alltel or Alltelâ€™s counsel with the notice of appeal. Â The\r\n  circuit court dismissed Kemppinenâ€™s appeal for improper service. Â Kemppinen\r\n  filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but the circuit court denied his motion.\r\n  Kemppinen appeals. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nâ€œ[T]he procedure on appeal to the circuit court from the judgment of an inferior court\r\n  . . . shall be in accordance with the statutes providing such appeals.â€Â  Rule\r\n  74, SCRCP.Â  Section 18-7-20 of the South Carolina Code requires an appellant to serve his\r\n  notice of appeal within thirty days of receiving written notice of judgment by\r\n  the magistrate.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-20 (Supp. 2007).Â  Â In addition, where\r\n  the notice of appeal is required by statute, Rule 74 mandates the â€œnotice of\r\n  appeal to the circuit court must be served on all parties within thirty (30)\r\n  days after receipt of written notice of the judgment, order or decision\r\n  appealed from.â€Â  Rule 74, SCRCP.\r\nFailure to perfect an appeal from magistrateâ€™s court divests the\r\n  trial court of appellate jurisdiction.Â  See State v. Brown,\r\n  358 S.C. 382, 387, 596 S.E.2d 39, 41 (2004).Â  Further, service\r\n  of notice of intent to appeal on the opposing party is a jurisdictional\r\n  requirement, and an appellate court has no authority to extend the time in which\r\n  the notice of intent to appeal must be served.Â  Mears v.

Riddle, Family Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-267\r\nHeard April 9, 2008 â€“ Filed May 16, 2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tO.W. Bannister, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDavid Michael Collins, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this domestic action, Melissa Burrell Cline (Wife) appeals the findings of the\r\n  family court arguing: (1) the court erred in holding repayment of marital debt\r\n  did not include interest; (2) the court erred in finding 1.1 acres of\r\n  nonmarital property had been transmuted into marital property; and (3) the\r\n  court abused its discretion in denying Wife alimony.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nWife and Thomas A. Cline (Husband) began\r\n  dating when Wife was in the eighth grade.Â  After graduating high school, Wife\r\n  and Husband married on April 24, 1993.Â  Wife and Husband have two children who\r\n  were respectively nine years old and four years old at the time of the final hearing. \r\nIn anticipation of marriage, Wife and Husband purchased a mobile\r\n  home which they placed on land given to Wife by her grandfather. Â Â Husband\r\n  assisted the grandfather in selecting, clearing, and preparing the land in\r\n  order to place the mobile home.Â  The couple named the road used to access the\r\n  land â€œT&amp;M Cline Drive,â€ otherwise known as â€œTommy and Melissa Cline Drive.â€Â \r\n  Additionally, the land was used as collateral to secure the loan for the mobile\r\n  home.Â  During the course of their marriage, Wife and Husband fully paid for the\r\n  mobile home and continued to make improvements to the land.Â  \r\nDue to\r\n  poor financial history, Husband and Wife were unable to obtain loans from a\r\n  bank. As a result, they borrowed money from Linda Bradley, Wifeâ€™s mother,\r\n  throughout the marriage.Â  Although no signed documents indicate any loans or a\r\n  promise to repay the debt, neither Husband nor Wife dispute receiving loans\r\n  from Bradley.[1]Â \r\n  Instead, the parties dispute the amount owed.Â  According to Wife, each time a\r\n  loan was received from Bradley, Bradley would establish a payment schedule with\r\n  interest.Â  However, Husband was unaware of any payment schedule or the accrual\r\n  of interest because Wife, using marital funds, handled the payments.Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to having children, Wife worked full-time making ten dollars an hour. Â Following\r\n  the birth of their first child, Wife continued to work on a part-time basis. Â After\r\n  the birth of their second child, Wife left work to care for her children.Â  At\r\n  some point during the marriage, Wife attended technical college for one and\r\n  one-half years, but at the final hearing she claimed going back to school was\r\n  not an option.Â  According to Husband, Wife refused to work outside of the\r\n  home.Â  At the time of the hearing, in addition to watching her own children,\r\n  Wife provided day care services for four additional children at the rate of\r\n  $20.00 to $25.00 per day.Â  Husband, who at the time of the hearing was on\r\n  short-term disability, has been employed by BMW since 1999 and makes a base pay\r\n  of $25.15 per hour.Â  \r\nDuring the course of their marriage, Husband and Wife separated on\r\n  three occasions as a result of Husbandâ€™s extramarital affair with another\r\n  woman.Â  The final separation occurred on February 2, 2005.Â  On May 24, 2005,\r\n  Wife filed for divorce on the grounds of adultery and on September 19, 2006,\r\n  the family court issued its final order and decree of divorce awarding full\r\n  custody of the children to Wife.Â  For the purpose of determining child support,\r\n  the family court imputed the sum of $8.00 per hour to Wife, which equates to a\r\n  gross monthly income of $1,386.00.Â  Husbandâ€™s gross monthly income was\r\n  calculated at $3,266.00, which was reflective of his disability pay.Â  Husband\r\n  was ordered to pay child support of $1,121.00 per month.Â  Wife was awarded full\r\n  ownership and possession of the marital home but did not receive an alimony\r\n  award.Â  The family court found the land on which the marital home sits had been\r\n  transmuted into marital property.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find\r\n  the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652&nbsp;(2006).\r\n  However, this broad scope of review does not require the appellate court to\r\n  disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C.\r\n  532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102&nbsp;(2005).Â  Neither is the appellate court\r\n  required to ignore the fact that the family court judge, who saw and heard the\r\n  witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and to assign\r\n  comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Latimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375,\r\n  380, 602 S.E.2d 32, 34&nbsp;(2004).Â  â€œQuestions concerning alimony rest with\r\n  the sound discretion of the [family] court, whose conclusions will not be\r\n  disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion.â€&nbsp; Kelley v. Kelley,\r\n  324 S.C. 481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).&nbsp; The family court â€œabuses its discretion when factual\r\n  findings are without evidentiary support or a ruling is based upon an error of\r\n  law.â€ &nbsp;Smith v. Doe, 366 S.C. 469, 474, 623 S.E.2d 370, 372 (2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  Marital Debt\r\nWife argues the\r\n  family court erred in its calculation of marital debt because Husband and Wife\r\n  were expected to repay the principal owed to Bradley with interest.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nDebts\r\n  incurred for marital purposes are subject to equitable distribution.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(13) (Supp. 2006).Â  â€œSection 20-7-472 creates a rebuttable\r\n  presumption that a debt of either spouse incurred prior to marital litigation\r\n  is a marital debt and must be factored into the totality of equitable\r\n  apportionment.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 103, 545 S.E.2d 531,\r\n  539&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  Additionally,\r\n  loans from close family members must be carefully scrutinized for legitimacy.Â  Id. at 104, 545 S.E.2d at 539.Â  \r\nOur\r\n  review of the record suggests that Bradley gave Husband and Wife approximately\r\n  $41,000 with the expectation that she would be repaid.Â  Husband, Wife, and\r\n  Bradley testified that Bradley made loans to the parties throughout the\r\n  marriage.Â  Husband and Wife presented testimony that between $20,000 and $31,000\r\n  had been paid back to Bradley.Â  Both Bradley and Wife stated the loans were\r\n  interest bearing.Â  However, neither Wife nor Bradley introduced into evidence a\r\n  promissory note or any other document as proof the payment was an interest\r\n  bearing loan. Â Instead, the record reveals the only document indicating a\r\n  payment schedule, including a 7.5% interest rate, was created right before the\r\n  scheduled trial.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  excluding interest when calculating the remaining balance of the marital debt\r\n  only for the purposes of equitable distribution.[2]\r\nII.Â  Transmutation\r\n      \r\nWife asserts the\r\n  family court erred in finding the 1.1 acres of land, a premarital gift, was\r\n  transmuted into marital property.Â  We disagree.\r\nProperty\r\n  acquired by either party before the marriage is nonmarital property. S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(2) (Supp. 2006).\r\n  Â While not ordinarily subject to division, a gift of real estate to one spouse\r\n  may lose its nonmarital character if used in support of the marriage or\r\n  otherwise utilized in such a manner as to evidence intent by the parties to\r\n  make it marital property. Trimnal v. Trimnal, 287 S.C. 495, 497-98, 339\r\n  S.E.2d 869, 870 (1986).Â  Property that is nonmarital at the time of its\r\n  acquisition may be transmuted if it: (1) becomes so commingled with marital\r\n  property as to be untraceable; (2) is titled jointly; or (3) is utilized by the\r\n  parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an\r\n  intent by the parties to make it marital property.Â  Id. \r\nâ€œAs a general rule,\r\n  transmutation is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case.â€ Â Johnson\r\n    v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œThe\r\n  spouse claiming transmutation must produce objective evidence showing that, during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.Â  Id. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110-11.Â  If\r\n  one spouse carries this burden, that spouse establishes a prima facie case the\r\n  property is marital property.Â  Id. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110.Â  If the\r\n  opposing spouse then wishes to claim that the property so identified is not\r\n  part of the marital estate, the opposing spouse has the burden of presenting\r\n  evidence to establish its nonmarital character.Â  Id. \r\nEvidence\r\n  that nonmarital property has been transmuted may include â€œplacing the property\r\n  in joint names, transferring the property to the other spouse as a gift, using\r\n  the property exclusively for marital purposes, commingling the property with\r\n  marital property, using marital funds to build equity in the property, or\r\n  exchanging the property for marital property.â€Â  Id. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 111.Â  However, the\r\n  mere use of separate property to support the marriage,\r\n  without some additional evidence of intent to treat it as property of the\r\n  marriage, is not sufficient to establish transmutation.Â  Id. at 295-96, 372 S.E.2d at 111.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina\r\n  courts have found sufficient evidence to establish transmutation where separate\r\n  property is used to support the marital home.Â  Recently our court held land\r\n  acquired by husband by gift lost its nonmarital character when husband and wife\r\n  erected the marital home on the land.Â  Simpson v. Simpson, Op. No. 4341\r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 8, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 7 at 71) (citing Cooper\r\n    v. Cooper, 289 S.C. 377, 380, 346 S.E.2d 326, 328 (Ct. App. 1986)).Â  In Simpson,\r\n  husband acquired land by gift during the marriage.Â  Thereafter, husband and\r\n  wife cleared the land and used marital funds to build a home, which the parties\r\n  then occupied from the time it was built in 1995 until the commencement of\r\n  their divorce proceeding in 2004. Â Id.Â  Based on these occurrences, this\r\n  court found the parties used the home and land in support of the marriage and\r\n  upheld the family courtâ€™s ruling that the home was transmuted into marital\r\n  property.Â  Id. Â Similarly, in Cooper, this court held husbandâ€™s\r\n  nonmarital property was effectively transmuted into marital property when the\r\n  marital home was erected thereon.Â  Cooper, 289 S.C. at 380, 346 S.E.2d\r\n  at 328.Â  In finding Husbandâ€™s nonmarital property transmuted into marital\r\n  property, the Cooper court reasoned: \r\n\r\n\t[a]lthough\r\n  the evidence shows that the husband acquired the land by gift from his father\r\n  during the marriage, it also shows, and we so find, that the property lost its\r\n  nonmarital character and therefore became subject to equitable distribution\r\n  when the husband, nine years before the parties separated, erected the marital\r\n  home thereon and thereby used the 1.4 acre tract in support of the marriage.Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. Â Â Here, as in Simpson and Cooper, the land given to Wife by gift effectively lost its\r\n  nonmarital character when it was used to support the marriage.Â  Applying this\r\n  courtâ€™s analysis in Simpson and Cooper, the use of Wifeâ€™s nonmarital\r\n  land as the foundation to sustain the marital mobile home for the duration of\r\n  Husband and Wifeâ€™s marriage supports the family courtâ€™s finding of transmutation.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the facts further evidence the intent of the parties to treat the property as\r\n  marital property. Husband assisted in selecting, clearing, and preparing the\r\n  land for the mobile home and the land was used as collateral to secure the loan\r\n  to enable the purchase of the marital mobile home.Â  Husband and Wife, using\r\n  marital funds, improved the property by installation of a sewer and septic\r\n  tank, addition of electricity and water, and pavement of the driveway.[3]Â \r\n  The couple even named the road\r\n  used to access the land under the coupleâ€™s married name, calling it â€œT&amp;M Cline Drive.â€ Â These actions, in combination,\r\n  evidence intent by the parties to make the land marital property.Â  As a result,\r\n  the family court did not abuse its discretion in finding the land was\r\n  transmuted into marital property.\r\n\r\n    III.Â  Alimony\r\nWife contends the\r\n  family court abused its discretion in denying her request for alimony.Â \r\n  Specifically, Wife asserts the family courtâ€™s denial of alimony was erroneously\r\n  based on the premise that child support is a substitute for alimony and the\r\n  courtâ€™s decision was incorrect due to error as to the other grounds of this\r\n  appeal.Â  We disagree. \r\nAn\r\n  award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and will\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Allen v. Allen,\r\n  347 S.C. 177, 184-85, 554 S.E.2d 421,\r\n  424-25&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the findings\r\n  of the family court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an\r\n  error of law.Â  Bryson v. Bryson, 347 S.C. 221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nâ€œAlimony\r\n  is a substitute for the support which is normally incident to the marital\r\n  relationship.â€ Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113\r\n  (Ct. App. 1988).Â  As such, alimony serves as a means of placing the supported\r\n  spouse in a position as near as possible to the position he or she enjoyed\r\n  during the marriage.Â  Id.Â  â€œHowever, â€˜[a]limony should not dissuade a\r\n  spouse, to the extent possible, from becoming self-supporting.â€™â€Â  Davis v.\r\n    Davis, 372 S.C. 64, 79, 641 S.E.2d 446, 453-54&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006)\r\n  (quoting Rimer v. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 525, 605 S.E.2d 572, 574 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004)).Â  The ultimate alimony award, while based upon the reasonable needs\r\n  of the wife, â€œshould not serve as a disincentive for her to make reasonable\r\n  efforts to improve her employment potential or dissuade her, to the extent\r\n  feasible, from becoming self-supporting.â€Â  Josey v. Josey, 291 S.C. 26,\r\n  33, 351 S.E.2d 891, 896&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986).Â  â€œIt is the duty of the family\r\n  court to make an alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just if the claim is\r\n  well founded.â€Â  Allen, 347 S.C. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 424 (citing Woodward\r\n    v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 217, 363 S.E.2d 413, 417 (Ct. App. 1987)).\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina law provides the family court\r\n  may grant alimony in such amounts and for such term as the judge considers\r\n  appropriate under the circumstances.Â  Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 462,\r\n  486 S.E.2d 516, 523 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Factors to be considered in making an\r\n  alimony award include: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the\r\n  parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and\r\n  earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the\r\n  marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7)\r\n  current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and\r\n  nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital\r\n  misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support obligations;\r\n  as well as (13) other factors the court considers relevant. S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2007).Â  Additionally, the amount received as a result of\r\n  equitable distribution is also a factor to be considered in awarding alimony.Â  Josey,\r\n  291 S.C. at 33, 351 S.E.2d at 895-96.Â  The weight accorded to each factor is\r\n  within the family courtâ€™s sound discretion.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  The family court has discretion to determine the amount of any\r\n  alimony award.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-230(B)(1) (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nWhere\r\n  alimony is appropriate, South Carolina favors permanent periodic alimony over\r\n  other statutory forms of alimony.Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 95,\r\n  545 S.E.2d 531, 535 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Despite this preference, however, South Carolina recognizes rehabilitative alimony as an alternative in special\r\n  circumstances.Â  â€œRehabilitative alimony may be awarded only upon a showing of\r\n  special circumstances justifying a departure from the normal preference for\r\n  permanent periodic support.â€Â  Jenkins, 345 S.C. at 95, 545 S.E.2d at\r\n  535.Â  The purpose of rehabilitative alimony is to further the ability of a\r\n  dependant spouse to become self-supporting following a divorce.Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the family court considered all of the pertinent statutory factors\r\n  including the duration of the marriage and Husbandâ€™s conduct in determining\r\n  whether to make an award of alimony.Â  Upon weighing the necessary factors as\r\n  well as the equitable distribution award, the family court found that permanent\r\n  periodic alimony was not appropriate in this case.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the court did not specifically find the need for rehabilitative alimony.Â \r\n  Instead, the court evaluated whether rehabilitative alimony, in a best case\r\n  scenario, would be beneficial to Wife.Â  After reviewing the numbers and upon\r\n  consideration of the tax consequences, the family court concluded that Wife was\r\n  better off financially without an award of alimony.Â  While we would not condone\r\n  the substitution of child support for alimony, we do not reach this question as\r\n  we do not interpret the courtâ€™s best case scenario as being tantamount to a\r\n  finding to award rehabilitative alimony.Â  Accordingly, the courtâ€™s alternative\r\n  reasoning is merely dicta and is not dispositive of this appeal.Â  We interpret\r\n  the courtâ€™s decision as denying any form of alimony after consideration of the\r\n  various factors and record, especially in light of Wifeâ€™s age, education,\r\n  employment history, and ability to work.Â  In her brief on appeal, Wife only\r\n  claims that she is entitled to permanent periodic alimony.Â  Since Wife bases\r\n  her alimony argument on the alleged errors of the court on the other grounds of\r\n  appeal, as well as the courtâ€™s alleged error in that portion we find to be dicta,\r\n  we find no abuse of discretion by the family court.Â  We further note that the\r\n  court was never presented with any request, by virtue of the pleadings, or at\r\n  trial, to award rehabilitative alimony. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion in\r\n  the family courtâ€™s decision to deny Wife alimony.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the decision of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., PIEPER, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] According to Bradley, Husband and Wife borrowed approximately\r\n  $41,000 and have paid back over $33,000.Â  \r\n[2] Bradley is not a party to this litigation.Â  Our\r\n  ruling on this issue is limited solely to the courtâ€™s equitable distribution\r\n  analysis.Â  We express no opinion on Bradleyâ€™s right to assert a claim against\r\n  Husband or Wife.\r\n[3] Wife asserts all of these acts, except pavement of\r\n  the driveway, occurred before marriage and suggests the property is thus\r\n  nonmarital.Â  However, the court is not limited solely to acts occurring during\r\n  marriage in its determination of the intent of the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-268","title":"In the Interest of James L. v.

Elliott, Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia; and\r\n  Solicitor Randolph Murdaugh, III, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â   James L. (James) appeals the family\r\n  courtâ€™s sentence of suspended\r\n  commitment to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) and probation based on\r\n  Jamesâ€™ convictions for third-degree arson and third-degree burglary.Â  James\r\n  contends the family court erred when it failed to grant his motions for\r\n  directed verdicts on these two charges.Â  We agree.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  the afternoon of March 25, 2004, fifteen-year-old James and his thirteen-year-old\r\n  friend, T.J., entered a vacant mobile home in Walterboro, South Carolina.Â \r\n  According to Jamesâ€™ statement to the police and his testimony at trial, he and\r\n  T.J. entered the mobile home through the unlocked front door.Â  James testified\r\n  they were not planning on stealing anything or damaging the mobile home.Â  After\r\n  walking around the inside of the unoccupied home, they remained in the living\r\n  room where they smoked several cigarettes. Â Once they finished smoking the\r\n  cigarettes and the pack was empty, James set the empty carton on fire and threw\r\n  it on the floor. Â He then proceeded to stomp out the remaining flames, and both\r\n  boys exited the mobile home.Â  \r\nT.J.\r\n  also testified they entered through the unlocked front door of the mobile home,\r\n  which was missing its doorknob. Â T.J. said after walking around the mobile\r\n  home, they stopped in the living room where James proceeded to smoke two\r\n  cigarettes.Â  Afterwards, James lit the pack on fire and threw it onto the floor\r\n  near a mattress.Â  T.J. stated James asked him to urinate on the pack to put out\r\n  the fire, but T.J. refused. Â James stomped the pack out with his feet, but T.J.\r\n  said there was still â€œa little bit of ashes [lit] up.â€ \r\nAfter\r\n  James and T.J. left the mobile home, the smoldering ashes caught the living\r\n  room on fire, which ultimately resulted in the burning of the mobile home.Â  James\r\n  was subsequently charged with third-degree arson and second-degree burglary.[1]Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  trial, the investigating detective testified there was no physical evidence to\r\n  support the arson charge. Â The detective stated James intentionally set the\r\n  fire, but he also stated James was negligent in setting the fire.Â  Further, when\r\n  questioned, the detective admitted it was possible for James to have thought he\r\n  extinguished the fire without realizing it was still smoldering.Â  \r\nAt the\r\n  conclusion of the Stateâ€™s case, Jamesâ€™ counsel made directed verdict motions on\r\n  the arson and burglary charges, which the family court denied.Â  Jamesâ€™ counsel\r\n  renewed these motions at the close of trial, which the family court again\r\n  denied.Â  The family court held the State proved its case beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt, as James acted wrongfully and willfully when he lit the\r\n  cigarette pack on fire and caused the burning of the trailer.Â  As such, James\r\n  was sentenced to a suspended commitment to the DJJ and was also placed on probation.Â \r\n  This appeal follows.[2]Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, this Court must view the evidence\r\n  in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C.\r\n  622, 633, 591 S.E.2d 600, 605 (2004).Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed\r\n  verdict, the family court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of\r\n  evidence, not its weight.Â  In the Interest of\r\n    Cisco K., 332 S.C. 649, 652, 506 S.E.2d 536, 538 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nIf\r\n  there is any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably\r\n  tending to prove the guilt of the accused, this Court must find the denial of\r\n  the directed verdict was proper.Â  State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653,\r\n  572 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2002).Â  On the other hand, a defendant is entitled to a\r\n  directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense\r\n  charged. Â State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 642, 576 S.E.2d 168, 171\r\n  (2003).Â \r\n  Similarly, the trial court should grant a directed verdict when the evidence\r\n  merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  State v. Zeigler,\r\n  364 S.C. 94, 102, 610 S.E.2d 859, 863 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJames\r\n  argues the family court erred in denying his motions for directed verdicts on\r\n  the arson and burglary charges because the State presented no direct or\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove Jamesâ€™ guilt.Â  We\r\n  agree. \r\nI.\r\n  Arson in the Third Degree\r\nOur arson\r\n  statute provides in pertinent part that â€œa person who wilfully and maliciously\r\n  . . . sets fire to, burns, or causes a burning which results in damage to a\r\n  building or structure . . . is guilty of arson in the third degree . . . .â€\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-110(C) (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nThe State must\r\n  present evidence of the corpus delicti for an arson case to proceed to the jury.\r\n  Â State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 381, 385, 468 S.E.2d 656, 658 (1996). Â In\r\n  an arson case, the corpus delicti is comprised of (1) a burned building or\r\n  other property, and (2) some criminal agency which caused the burning.Â  Id. at 384, 468 S.E.2d at 658.Â  â€œIn other words, the corpus delicti includes not\r\n  only the fact of burning, but it must also appear that the burning was by the\r\n  willful act of some person, and not as a result of a natural or accidental\r\n  cause.â€ Id. at 384-85, 468 S.E.2d at 658 (internal quotations omitted). \r\nIn this case,\r\n  the State failed to present any evidence, either direct or circumstantial, that\r\n  the burning of the mobile home was an intentional, willful, or malicious act.Â Â \r\n  Both Jamesâ€™ and T.J.â€™s testimony tend to prove James did not intend to burn the\r\n  mobile home when he lit the cigarette pack on fire and threw it on the floor. Â Both\r\n  testified James stomped on the pack more than once in an attempt to extinguish\r\n  any remaining flames.Â  Further, James stated he did not see any ashes or\r\n  smolder, but if he had, he would have stomped out the remaining flames.Â  James\r\n  believed the fire was completely extinguished when they exited the home. \r\nDuring trial,\r\n  the investigating detective admitted no physical evidence existed to support\r\n  the arson charge. Â Further, the detective admitted it was possible for James to\r\n  have thought he put the fire out without realizing it was still smoldering when\r\n  he left the mobile home.Â  \r\nConsidering\r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, there is no direct or\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence showing Jamesâ€™ actions rose to a level that\r\n  would support the charge of arson.Â  While James may have been negligent in\r\n  failing to extinguish the cigarette pack before leaving the mobile home, the\r\n  State failed to present sufficient evidence he acted in a willful and\r\n  intentional manner.Â  Consequently, the family court erred in denying Jamesâ€™\r\n  motion for a directed verdict on the arson charge.\r\nII.Â  Burglary in\r\n  the Third Degree\r\nSouth Carolinaâ€™s burglary statute provides a â€œperson is guilty of burglary in the third\r\n  degree if the person enters a building without consent and with intent to\r\n  commit a crime therein.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-313(A) (Supp. 2007). \r\nIn this case,\r\n  it is uncontroverted James entered the mobile home without the ownerâ€™s\r\n  permission, as the owner testified she never gave James permission to go on the\r\n  property.Â  Thus, the determinate factor is whether James entered the mobile\r\n  home with the intent to commit a crime.Â  \r\nâ€œThere is no\r\n  requirement that the intent element is satisfied only by proving an intent to\r\n  commit the specific crime that is charged in the indictment as an aggravating\r\n  circumstance.â€Â  Pinckney v. State, 368 S.C. 502, 505, 629 S.E.2d 367,\r\n  369 (2006).Â  The only requirement is that the person has the intent to commit\r\n  any crime at the time of entry. Â Id.Â  The personâ€™s actions after\r\n  entering the dwelling can be evidence in determining whether the person had the\r\n  intent to commit a crime at the time of entry.Â  State v. Pinckney, 339\r\n  S.C. 346, 349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000).Â  Further, to constitute burglary, it\r\n  is not necessary the intended crime be committed or the person be convicted of\r\n  the intended crime.Â  State v. Peterson, 336 S.C. 6, 7, 518 S.E.2d 277,\r\n  278 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nIn this case,\r\n  the State argued James entered the mobile home with the intent to commit a\r\n  crime. Â The State first contended James entered the mobile home with the intent\r\n  to commit arson, as he wanted to burn the mobile home to conceal he had entered\r\n  it without permission.Â  This assertion mirrors the juvenile petition, which\r\n  stated the burglary charge was supported by Jamesâ€™ unlawful entry coupled with\r\n  the intent to commit arson.Â  As explained above, the evidence does not support\r\n  a charge of arson.Â  \r\nThe State\r\n  further argued that based on Jamesâ€™ prior burglary of a neighborâ€™s storage\r\n  shed,[3] the family court could infer intent to commit larceny on the day in question. Â However,\r\n  the State failed to produce any evidence, either direct or circumstantial, that\r\n  James stole any property or intended on that specific occasion to enter the\r\n  mobile home for the purpose of stealing property.Â  Jamesâ€™ and T.J.â€™s testimony\r\n  contradicts this assertion as well.Â  \r\nJamesâ€™ counsel\r\n  claimed at the directed verdict stage that while the investigating officer\r\n  argued Jamesâ€™ act of underage smoking was a crime, Jamesâ€™ entry into the mobile\r\n  home with the intent to smoke cigarettes would not support a charge of third-degree\r\n  burglary.Â  \r\nWhile the sale\r\n  or purchase of tobacco products to a minor is illegal, if a minor under the age\r\n  of eighteen buys or possesses tobacco products, the minor commits only a non-criminal\r\n  offense and is subject to a civil fine of twenty-five dollars.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§Â§ 16-17-500(A), (E)(1), (E)(2)Â  (Supp. 2007).Â  The statute specifically states\r\n  that â€œa violation of this subsection is not a criminal or delinquent offense\r\n  and no criminal or delinquent record may be maintained.â€Â  Â§ 16-17-500(E)(5).Â \r\n  Consequently, this argument is without merit. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe State failed\r\n  to present any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence to establish James\r\n  was guilty of third-degree arson or third-degree burglary.Â  Without more than a\r\n  mere suspicion of guilt, the family court erred in failing to grant Jamesâ€™\r\n  motions for directed verdicts on the arson and burglary charges.\r\nTherefore, the\r\n  order of the family court isÂ Â Â  \r\nREVERSED.[4]\r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] James was initially\r\n  charged with burglary in the second degree and arson in the third degree for\r\n  the mobile home incident and burglary in the third degree for a separate\r\n  incident.Â  The State moved to amend its petition from a charge of burglary in\r\n  the second degree to burglary in the third degree, which the family court\r\n  granted.Â  James pled guilty to the third-degree burglary charge stemming from\r\n  the separate incident and requested a trial on the remaining two charges.Â  \r\n[2] James appealed\r\n  the family courtâ€™s ruling pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738\r\n  (1967).Â  Jamesâ€™ appellate counsel filed a brief along with a petition to be\r\n  relieved, stating her examination of the record indicated the appeal was\r\n  without merit.Â  Following our Anders review, this Court ordered the\r\n  parties to brief the following issue: Whether the family court properly denied\r\n  Jamesâ€™ motions for directed verdicts on the charge of arson in the third degree\r\n  and burglary in the third degree.Â  This issue is now our sole appellate\r\n  consideration.\r\n[3] The record\r\n  fails to fully establish the details of the storage shed incident.Â  It appears\r\n  from the record that James admitted to removing several dishes and appliances\r\n  from a neighborâ€™s shed prior to this incident and selling them to another\r\n  individual for five dollars per box.Â  James pled guilty to this burglary charge\r\n  and does not appeal this ruling. \r\n[4] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-269","title":"Singleton v.

Carter Elliott, Jr., both of Georgetown, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Prison\r\n  Health Services, Inc. (Prison Health) appeals from two discovery orders.Â  We\r\n  dismiss the appeal as interlocutory.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 5, 2004, the Estate of George King (the\r\n  Estate) brought claims for negligence and wrongful death against Richland County.Â  On February 28, 2005, the complaint was amended to include Prison Health\r\n  as a defendant.Â  The complaint alleged Richland County and Prison Health failed\r\n  to provide adequate medical care to King after he was injured while\r\n  incarcerated at the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center in Richland County, and\r\n  King died as a result. Â At the time, Prison Health provided medical\r\n  services for the Detention Center.\r\nOn September 26, 2005, the Estate sent Rule 30(b)(5)\r\n  and 30(b)(6) deposition notices to Prison Health, including requests for the\r\n  production of documents at the deposition.Â  Subsequently, Prison Health filed\r\n  motions to quash portions of the deposition notices, and the Estate responded by\r\n  filing a motion to compel Prison Health to produce the requested documents and\r\n  answers. Â Following a hearing, Judge Reginald Lloyd denied Prison\r\n  Healthâ€™s motions to quash, and granted the Estateâ€™s motion to compel on January\r\n  31, 2006.\r\nThe Estate attempted to move forward with the\r\n  depositions; however, the Estate contended the information Prison Health\r\n  provided did not meet the requirements of Judge Lloydâ€™s order and subsequently\r\n  filed a motion to enforce the courtâ€™s order.Â  On September 8, 2006, the matter\r\n  was heard before Judge James R. Barber,[1] who requested the parties reach an agreement on the information to be provided\r\n  by Prison Health; however, the parties were unable to agree.Â  Ultimately, Judge\r\n  Barber issued an order granting the Estateâ€™s motion.Â  Prison Health responded\r\n  with a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the order.Â  \r\nOn October 10, 2006, Judge Barber filed an amended order,\r\n  as well as a qualified protective order.Â  The amended order required Prison\r\n  Health to comply with Judge Lloydâ€™s initial order by providing all information\r\n  and witnesses necessary to fully and completely respond to the Rule 30(b)(5)\r\n  and 30(b)(6) deposition notices.Â  Additionally, the order required Prison\r\n  Health to produce all materials by October 13, 2006.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn October 20, 2006, Prison Health filed and served an\r\n  amended notice of appeal.Â  Subsequently, the Estate responded by filing a motion\r\n  to dismiss the appeal, which was denied with leave to argue the issue of appealability.\r\n  Â In response, the parties filed briefs arguing both the issue of appealability\r\n  as well as the merits of the appeal itself.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nâ€œThe right of appeal arises from and is controlled by\r\n  statutory law.â€ Â Ex parte Capital U-Drive-It, Inc.,&nbsp;369 S.C. 1, 6,\r\n  630 S.E.2d 464, 467&nbsp;(2006).Â  â€œAn appeal ordinarily may be pursued only\r\n  after a party has obtained a final judgment.â€ Â Id.; S.C.Code Ann. Â§\r\n  14-3-330 (1976); Rule 72, SCRCP; Rule 201(a), SCACR.Â  â€œThe determination of whether a party may immediately appeal\r\n  an order issued before or during trial is governed primarily by S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 14-3-330.â€Â  Ex parte Capital U-Drive-It, Inc.,&nbsp;at 6, 630 S.E.2d\r\n  at 467.Â  â€œAbsent a specialized statute, an order must fall into one of several\r\n  categories set forth in Section 14-3-330 in order to be immediately\r\n  appealable.â€Â  Id.Â  Courts in South Carolina have generally held that\r\n  orders directing a party to participate in discovery are interlocutory and not\r\n  directly appealable under section 14-3-330. Â See, e.g., Ex\r\n    parte Whetstone, 289 S.C. 580, 580, 347 S.E.2d 881, 881&nbsp;(1986); Patterson\r\n      v. Specter Broadcasting, 287 S.C. 249, 335 S.E.2d 803 (1985); Lowndes\r\n        Products, Inc. v. Brower, 262 S.C. 431, 205 S.E.2d 184 (1974).\r\nIn an\r\n  analogous case involving privileged information, the supreme court held a discovery\r\n  order was not immediately appealable because â€œan order compelling discovery\r\n  does not ordinarily involve the merits of the case.â€ Tucker v. Honda of South Carolina Mfg., Inc., 354 S.C. 574, 577, 582 S.E.2d 405, 406 (2003).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the court explained â€œ[s]ince a contempt order is final in\r\n  nature, an order compelling discovery may be appealed\r\n  only after the trial court holds a party in contempt.â€ Id. at 577, 583 S.E.2d at 406-07.Â  â€œThus, a party may comply with the\r\n  order and waive any right to challenge it on appeal or refuse to comply with\r\n  the order, be cited for contempt, and appeal.â€Â  Id. at 577, 582 S.E.2d\r\n  at 407.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  the holdings of the cases above, Prison Health argues the order is appealable\r\n  because 1) it requires the production of privileged and confidential material\r\n  and 2) compliance with the order would prevent an appeal of the issues.Â  As\r\n  explained in the Tucker case, Prison Health may appeal if it is\r\n  held in contempt.Â  Furthermore, section 14-3-330(2)(a), which applies to orders\r\n  affecting substantial rights which â€œin effect determine[] the action and\r\n  prevent[] a judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the\r\n  action,â€ does not apply to the present case. (emphasis added).Â  The limited civil\r\n  cases in which section 14-3-330(2)(a) has been applied to discovery orders are\r\n  distinguishable because in those cases the subject matter of the entire\r\n  litigation was the protection of information; therefore, the discovery orders\r\n  compelling the production of the information effectively determined the actions\r\n  and ended the litigation as moot.Â  See, e.g., Knight Pub. Co.\r\n    v. Univ. of South Carolina, 295 S.C. 31, 32, 367 S.E.2d 20, 21&nbsp;(1988)\r\n  (â€œThe appealed order allows discovery of documents that respondents ultimately\r\n  seek disclosed as the subject of these FOIA actions. This order is directly\r\n  appealable under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2)(a) (1976) because it in effect\r\n  determines the action and prevents an appealable judgment.â€), overruled on\r\n  other grounds, Simpson v. Sanders, 314 S.C. 413, 445 S.E.2d 93 (1994).Â  Â \r\nThe\r\n  discovery order in the instant case, however, does not effectively meet the\r\n  requirements for immediate appealability.Â  The Estateâ€™s causes of action for\r\n  negligence and wrongful death are not so intimately associated with the\r\n  production of the requested documents that the order itself determines the\r\n  subject matter of the action.Â  Indeed, regardless of whether the documents are\r\n  actually produced, the Estateâ€™s action would proceed to further stages of the\r\n  litigation. Therefore, section 14-3-330(2)(a) does not provide for immediate\r\n  appeal of the order.Â  Prison Healthâ€™s appeal is interlocutory and premature.Â \r\n  Since Prison Health has not refused to comply with the order and has not been\r\n  found in contempt, the discovery order remains interlocutory and unappealable.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the order about which Prison Health complains affords a mechanism by which\r\n  Prison Health can seek additional protection for information believed to be\r\n  protected under HIPPA or more stringent state law.Â  Judge Barberâ€™s order\r\n  specifically states that all materials covered by HIPPA â€œshall be produced\r\n  without redaction unless required by HIPPA or a state statute which is more\r\n  stringent than HIPPA.â€Â  Moreover, the order provides an additional opportunity\r\n  to seek a subsequent court order if a determination is made that the\r\n  information requested is additionally protected by state law.Â  Further, in the\r\n  event Prison Health refuses to turn over information it deems protected, it\r\n  will have the opportunity to show cause before the trial court why it is not in\r\n  contempt.Â  Therefore, the discovery order at issue herein is not immediately appealable.[2]\r\nFinally,\r\n  any assertion that Judge Barber improperly enforced or altered Judge Lloydâ€™s\r\n  order, or that a final order had not yet been issued by Judge Lloyd, does not\r\n  convert this matter from an interlocutory order to a final order.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Prison Healthâ€™s appeal is interlocutory and hereby\r\nDISMISSED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., PIEPER, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In the time between Judge Lloydâ€™s initial order and\r\n  the Estateâ€™s motion, Judge Lloyd had left the bench.Â  \r\n[2] In McGee v. Bruce Hospital System, 312 S.C. 58,\r\n  439 S.E.2d 257 (1993), the Supreme Court reviewed on appeal a discovery order\r\n  pertaining to the Peer Review Statute and that decision was relied upon by a\r\n  panel of this court in Wieters v. Bon-Secours-St. Francis Xavier Hosp., Inc.,\r\n  Op. No. 4374 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 23, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. at 16\r\n  at 75).Â  However, we find McGee distinguishable since that case was\r\n  being reviewed by the Supreme Court pursuant to a writ of certiorari and any\r\n  issue of the interlocutory nature of the order was not addressed.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  discovery orders at issue in McGee and Wieters were unlike the\r\n  order in the case sub judice which clearly allowed for the withholding of HIPPA\r\n  information further protected by state law and additionally provided for\r\n  further court review if necessary to obtain such information.Â  The open-ended\r\n  nature of the order herein clearly makes it interlocutory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-275","title":"Oliphant v.

Elliot, all of\r\n  Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Christine Grove appeals her\r\n  convictions for possession with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nDeputy Sean Seebode observed a car backing out of a\r\n  power substation at 3:30 a.m. on December 14, 2005.Â  When he pulled in to\r\n  investigate, he observed two women in the vehicle: Grove, and the driver Bianca\r\n  Ford.Â  Seebode inquired as to their reason for being at the substation so early\r\n  in the morning, and the two replied they had stopped so Grove could go to the\r\n  bathroom in the neighboring woods.Â  Seebode checked Fordâ€™s driverâ€™s license and\r\n  called in Groveâ€™s name and birthdate, as she did not have identification on her\r\n  person.Â  While Seebode checked the identifications, Corporal Jennifer Flowers\r\n  joined him at the scene.Â  Both Seebode and Flowers asked for permission to\r\n  search the vehicle, and Ford verbally consented on each occasion.Â  \r\nOnce consent was\r\n  given, Ford and Grove were then directed to exit the vehicle, and Flowers\r\n  conducted an initial pat down.Â  Flowersâ€™ subsequent search of the vehicle\r\n  revealed a film canister containing three individually-wrapped bags of\r\n  marijuana and six bags of cocaine located under the passenger seat, and five\r\n  bags of marijuana beside the driverâ€™s seat. Â Grove and Ford were placed under\r\n  arrest and taken into custody.Â  Thereafter, Flowers conducted a more thorough pat\r\n  down and search incident to arrest of both women, finding $634 in cash on Grove.[1] \r\nGrove was indicted\r\n  for possession with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine, and a jury trial\r\n  was held.Â  After the State presented its case, Grove moved for a directed\r\n  verdict, contending the State failed to show she had constructive possession of\r\n  the drugs since she was a passenger in a car that belonged to Ford.Â  This\r\n  motion was denied.Â  Grove presented no evidence in her defense and renewed her\r\n  motion for directed verdict at the close of the case.Â  That motion was denied,\r\n  and the jury found Grove guilty of possession with intent to distribute cocaine\r\n  and marijuana.Â  She was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  considering a motion for directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the\r\n  existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  State v. Weston,\r\n  367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  A defendant is entitled to a\r\n  directed verdict when the State fails to present evidence of the offense\r\n  charged.Â  Id.Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, an\r\n  appellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light\r\n  most favorable to the State.Â  Id.Â  If there is any direct evidence or\r\n  any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt\r\n  of the accused, the appellate court must find the case was properly submitted\r\n  to the jury.Â  Id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGrove\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying her motion for directed verdict as the State\r\n  failed to prove she had possession of the cocaine and marijuana that was found\r\n  in the vehicle owned by her co-defendant.Â  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  conviction of possession requires proof of actual or constructive possession of\r\n  an illegal substance and knowledge of its presence.Â  State v.

Van Riper, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  In this action for death benefits, the circuit court affirmed the Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Commissionâ€™s (Commissionâ€™s) denial of benefits for the death of\r\n  Keith Davideit.Â  Kevin Davideit appeals on behalf of the decedent.Â  We affirm.Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nWhen he died, Keith Davideit was a forty-four-year-old employee of\r\n  ScanSource.Â  Davideit had a seizure disorder that he managed by taking Dilantin.Â \r\n  He suffered only two seizures in thirteen years.Â  Sometime in the afternoon of\r\n  May 9, 2003, Davideit left his work station and went to the menâ€™s restroom.Â \r\n  His co-workers later found him there, dead.Â  He was lying on his back in a\r\n  stall with his pants around his knees, as if he had been sitting on the toilet\r\n  and had fallen off.Â  A waste can partially covered his head, and he had\r\n  aspirated some of the waste canâ€™s plastic liner.Â  A co-worker â€œhad to pull\r\n  several timesâ€ to remove the plastic liner from Davideitâ€™s mouth.Â  \r\nDr. Michael Ward performed an autopsy at the request of the\r\n  coroner and the medical examinerâ€™s office.Â  The autopsy revealed\r\n  atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease with seventy to seventy-five percent\r\n  stenosis of the vessel lumen and acute pulmonary vascular congestion.[1] Â Dr. Ward found Davideitâ€™s somewhat\r\n  enlarged heart (mild cardiomegaly) and his aspiration of the plastic liner\r\n  contributed to his death. Â \r\nDr. Ward testified he believed Davideit died from a heart attack\r\n  caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease rather than from\r\n  asphyxiation.Â  Dr. Ward prepared paraffin blocks during the autopsy, but they\r\n  did not confirm asphyxiation as the cause of death.Â  He found mild pulmonary\r\n  vascular congestion, meaning blood was backed up in the lungâ€™s blood vessels\r\n  because the left side of the heart was not functioning properly near death.Â  Dr.\r\n  Ward testified this condition corresponds directly with a heart attack but only\r\n  indirectly with asphyxiation. Â Dr. Ward conceded Davideit may have suffered a\r\n  seizure as well as a heart attack.Â  The postmortem toxicology report found no\r\n  Dilantin in his system.Â  Dr. Ward believed Davideit did not die immediately\r\n  upon falling to the floor; rather, he continued breathing at least long enough\r\n  to inhale the plastic liner.Â  However, Dr. Ward opined that Davideit would have\r\n  died regardless of whether the plastic liner was in his throat.Â  Â Â \r\nSix other doctors reviewed the records pertaining to Davideitâ€™s\r\n  death and autopsy, but none of them examined the body.Â  Five of those doctors\r\n  theorized Davideit suffered a seizure, and four believed Davideit would have\r\n  survived had he not aspirated the plastic liner.Â  One doctor found inadequate\r\n  data to determine the cause of death with certainty but believed Davideit could\r\n  have died from either a heart attack or asphyxiation.Â  \r\nDavideitâ€™s family sought workersâ€™ compensation benefits for his\r\n  death.Â  The single commissioner found Davideit died of a heart attack and\r\n  denied benefits.Â  Both the appellate panel of the Commission and the circuit\r\n  court affirmed.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  reviewing workersâ€™ compensation decisions, the appellate court ascertains â€œwhether\r\n  the circuit court properly determined whether the appellate panelâ€™s findings of\r\n  fact are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the\r\n  panelâ€™s decision is affected by an error of law.â€ Â Baxter v. Martin Bros.,\r\n    Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 513, 630 S.E.2d 42, 43&nbsp;(2006) (citations omitted); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2007).Â  â€œâ€˜Substantial\r\n  evidenceâ€™ is evidence which, considering the entire record, would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to arrive at the same conclusion reached by the administrative\r\n  agency.â€Â  S.C. Second Injury Fund v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 353 S.C.\r\n  117, 122, 576 S.E.2d 199, 202 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The Administrative Procedures\r\n  Act does not permit an appellate court to â€œsubstitute its judgment for that of\r\n  the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.â€Â  West\r\n    v. Alliance Capital, 368 S.C. 246, 251, 628 S.E.2d 279, 282 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDavideit\r\n  argues his death is compensable as a fall under the increased danger rule.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  appellate panel is the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases and\r\n  is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Etheredge v.\r\n    Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 454, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â \r\n  The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded\r\n  evidence is reserved to the appellate panel.Â  Id. at 455, 562 S.E.2d at\r\n  681.Â  Expert medical testimony is designed to aid the appellate panel in coming\r\n  to the correct conclusion.Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 624, 571\r\n  S.E.2d 92, 98&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  Therefore, the appellate panel determines\r\n  the weight and credit to be given to the expert testimony.Â  Id. at 624,\r\n  571 S.E.2d at 98.Â  When there is conflicting medical evidence, the findings of\r\n  fact of the appellate panel are conclusive.Â  Nettles v. Spartanburg Sch.\r\n    Dist. No. 7, 341 S.C. 580, 592, 535 S.E.2d 146, 152&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œâ€˜[T]he\r\n  possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\r\n  prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s findings from being supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.â€™â€Â  Corbin, 351 S.C. at 618, 571 S.E.2d at 95 (quoting Muir\r\n    v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 282, 519 S.E.2d 583, 591 (Ct. App. 1999)).\r\nI.&nbsp; Substantial\r\n  Evidence\r\nOur\r\n  first task in this matter is to determine whether the circuit court erred in\r\n  finding substantial evidence supported the appellate panelâ€™s findings of fact.Â  See Baxter, 368 S.C. at 513, 630 S.E.2d at 43.Â  The single\r\n  commissioner, the appellate panel, and the circuit court all found Davideit\r\n  died of a heart attack.Â  By contrast, Davideitâ€™s argument on appeal hinges on\r\n  the theory that he died from asphyxiation following a fall.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court did not err in finding substantial evidence supported the\r\n  decision of the appellate panel.Â  Following Davideitâ€™s unwitnessed death, the appellate\r\n  panel relied upon forensic evidence to determine the cause of death.Â  The\r\n  appellate panel received and considered evidence including the coronerâ€™s\r\n  report, the medical examinerâ€™s autopsy report and testimony, and opinions from\r\n  six additional expert physicians.Â  Two likely causes of death emerged: heart\r\n  attack and asphyxiation following a fall.Â  \r\nA substantial amount of evidence supported the heart attack\r\n  theory, including the observation that Davideitâ€™s arteries suffered a seventy\r\n  to seventy-five percent reduction in blood flow due to atherosclerosis.Â  In\r\n  addition, blood had accumulated in his lungs, which suggested the left side of\r\n  Davideitâ€™s heart failed shortly before death. Â Dr. Ward explained the lack of\r\n  damage to the heart muscle by stating such damage generally becomes apparent\r\n  only if the decedent survives the heart attack for at least six hours.Â  On the\r\n  other hand, a substantial amount of evidence also supported the asphyxiation\r\n  theory.Â  The waste canâ€™s plastic liner lodged deep in Davideitâ€™s throat\r\n  indicated a prolonged struggle to breathe.Â  Davideitâ€™s history of a seizure\r\n  disorder, coupled with the finding of no Dilantin in his system, offered a\r\n  plausible explanation for a fall and subsequent inability to extricate himself\r\n  from the overturned waste can.Â  However, Dr. Ward testified the paraffin blocks\r\n  he prepared during the autopsy failed to establish asphyxiation as the cause of\r\n  death.Â  Thus, the appellate panel had to decide between two competing and\r\n  highly credible explanations for this death.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  appellate panel made its decision by assigning different weights to the\r\n  opinions of the expert physicians.Â  Of the physicians who offered opinions,\r\n  only the medical examiner, Dr. Ward, had actually examined the body.Â  The\r\n  opinions of all the other experts were â€œobtained by the attorneys from both\r\n  sides for the purpose of supporting their respective positions on the cause of\r\n  death.â€ Â Whereas Dr. Ward personally examined the body and conducted the\r\n  autopsy, and the other expert physicians merely reviewed records prepared by\r\n  Dr. Ward and others, the appellate panel placed greater weight upon Dr. Wardâ€™s\r\n  opinion.Â  Consequently, the appellate panel subscribed to Dr. Wardâ€™s theory of\r\n  death by heart attack.Â  Because substantial evidence supported this theory,\r\n  neither the appellate panel nor the circuit court erred in accepting it.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Error of Law\r\nHaving\r\n  found the circuit court properly concluded substantial evidence supported the\r\n  appellate panelâ€™s findings of fact, we next turn to whether the appellate\r\n  panelâ€™s decision was affected by an error of law. Â See Baxter,\r\n  368 S.C. at 513, 630 S.E.2d at 43.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  injury is compensable under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act (Act) if it occurs\r\n  accidentally, â€œarising out of and in the course of employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 42-1-160(A) (Supp. 2007).Â  Generally, when an employeeâ€™s death is\r\n  unexplained, unnatural, and accidental, courts presume the death arose out of\r\n  employment when circumstances indicate the death â€œtook place within the time\r\n  and space limits of the employment.â€Â  Bagwell v. Ernest Burwell, Inc.,\r\n  227 S.C. 444, 451, 88 S.E.2d 611, 614 (1955).Â  Breaks taken to care for an\r\n  employeeâ€™s personal comfort are incidental to employment, and events occurring\r\n  during those breaks arise out of and in the course of employment.Â  Portee v.\r\n    S.C. State Hosp., 234 S.C. 50, 54, 106 S.E.2d 670, 672 (1959).Â Â  However,\r\n  specific rules relating to unexplained falls and heart attacks modify this\r\n  rule, as indicated below.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  standard we use to determine whether an employeeâ€™s death is compensable under\r\n  the Act depends upon the cause of death.Â  Therefore, we evaluate the\r\n  compensability of Davideitâ€™s death from a fall using a different standard than\r\n  the compensability of his death from a heart attack.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Fall\r\nUnder\r\n  the increased danger rule, an unexplained fall is generally not compensable\r\n  unless the employment contributed to either the cause or the effect of the\r\n  fall.Â  Bagwell, 227 S.C. at 452-53, 88 S.E.2d at 614-15.Â  However, under\r\n  the special risk rule:Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the\r\n  neighborhood.Â  It must be incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of master and servant.Â  It need not have\r\n  been foreseen or expected, but after the event it must appear to have had\r\n    its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from\r\n  that source as a rational consequence.\r\n\r\nWest v. Alliance Capital, 368 S.C. 246, 252, 628 S.E.2d 279, 282 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006) (emphasis added; internal citations omitted).Â  Injuries are excluded from\r\n  compensability under the Act when they come â€œfrom a hazard to which the workmen\r\n  would have been equally exposed apart from the employment.â€Â  Crosby, 330\r\n  S.C. at 493, 499 S.E.2d at 255.Â  \r\nAssuming\r\n  arguendo Davideit died from the combination of a fall followed by asphyxiation,\r\n  his death would not be compensable.Â  Davideit argues on appeal that the\r\n  increased danger rule, and not the special risk rule, governs this matter.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  We find these rules work in harmony with one another and are not\r\n  mutually exclusive.Â  The special risk rule clarifies and limits the increased\r\n  danger rule rather than competing with it.Â  For example, our supreme court\r\n  denied compensation for death from an unexplained fall onto a concrete floor,\r\n  despite recognizing that the hard concrete floor may have contributed to the\r\n  severity of the employeeâ€™s injury.Â  Bagwell, 227 S.C. at 453, 88 S.E.2d\r\n  at 615.Â  When the employee would likely have encountered the same hazard in any\r\n  public place or private home, the increased danger rule did not apply.Â  Id. at 453, 88 S.E.2d at 615.Â  \r\nDavideit\r\n  asserts the most likely sequence of events leading to his death include a\r\n  seizure or heart attack event while seated on the toilet, a resulting fall to\r\n  the floor, and asphyxiation on the waste canâ€™s plastic liner while\r\n  incapacitated by the seizure.Â  Because Davideitâ€™s injury occurred â€œwithin the\r\n  time and space limits of [his] employment,â€ we begin with the presumption that\r\n  his death arose out of his employment.Â  See Bagwell, 227 S.C. at\r\n  451, 88 S.E.2d at 614.Â  The personal comfort doctrine protects his claim from\r\n  exclusion merely because his injury occurred during a restroom break.Â  See Portee, 234 S.C. at 54, 106 S.E.2d at 672.Â Â  Davideit argues his\r\n  exposure to the waste canâ€™s plastic liner renders his death compensable under\r\n  the increased danger rule.Â  However, Davideit does not assert his work at\r\n  ScanSource exposed him to waste cans or plastic liners any more than any other\r\n  aspect of his life.Â  In fact, no evidence supports the assertion that\r\n  Davideitâ€™s exposure to waste cans or plastic liners was incidental to the\r\n  character of his work, or that he encountered those items more at work than in\r\n  any other aspect of his life.Â  Consequently, we find the special risk rule renders\r\n  Davideitâ€™s death not compensable.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Heart\r\n  Attack\r\nA\r\n  heart attack may be compensable if â€œâ€˜the death arose out of employment, in that\r\n  it was brought about by unexpected strain or over-exertion, or as a result of\r\n  unusual and extraordinary conditions of employment.â€™â€Â  S.C. Second Injury\r\n    Fund v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 353 S.C. 117, 124, 576 S.E.2d 199, 203 (Ct. App. 2003) (quoting Jennings v. Chambers Dev. Co., 335 S.C. 249, 255, 516 S.E.2d\r\n  453, 456 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  Under the two-pronged heart attack standard, an\r\n  injured employee must prove he suffered some unexpected exertion as part of his\r\n  employment and the exertion caused his injury.Â  Id. at 125-26, 576\r\n  S.E.2d at 204.Â  \r\nDavideitâ€™s\r\n  death from a heart attack is not compensable.Â  Again, we begin with the\r\n  presumption Davideitâ€™s death arose from his employment and was not excluded\r\n  from compensability merely because it occurred during a personal comfort\r\n  break.Â  However, under the heart attack standard, a claimant must prove some unexpected\r\n  strain or over-exertion or extraordinary condition of employment caused his\r\n  heart attack.Â  Davideit does not argue, nor does the evidence indicate, that he\r\n  experienced any unanticipated strain or exertion.Â  Furthermore, there is no\r\n  indication that any such strain caused his heart attack.Â  Although Davideit\r\n  does contend his ingestion of the plastic liner contributed to his death, he\r\n  does not assert it caused his heart attack.[2]Â \r\n  Consequently, we find Davideitâ€™s heart attack did not arise out of his\r\n  employment, and it is not compensable.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the circuit court properly concluded substantial evidence supported the\r\n  appellate panelâ€™s finding of death by heart attack and no error of law affected\r\n  the appellate panelâ€™s decision.Â  Therefore, the circuit court did not err in\r\n  affirming the order of the appellate panel denying Davideit benefits.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the circuit court in this matter is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSHORT\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] â€œAtherosclerotic coronary vascular disease,â€ or\r\n  atherosclerosis, is a condition in which plaque deposits in the arteries\r\n  compromise blood flow.Â  Plaque comprised of deposits of cholesterol, fat,\r\n  calcium, or other waste causes the arteries to narrow and harden.Â  The\r\n  percentage of stenosis of the vessel lumen indicates how much of the original\r\n  passage has become clogged.Â  According to the American Heart Association:\r\n\r\n\tPlaques\r\n  can grow large enough to significantly reduce the bloodâ€™s flow through an\r\n  artery. Â But most of the damage occurs when they&nbsp;become fragile and\r\n  rupture. Â Plaques that rupture cause&nbsp;blood clots&nbsp;to form that can\r\n  block blood flow or break off and travel to another part of the body. If either\r\n  happens and blocks a blood vessel that feeds the heart, it causes a heart\r\n  attack. Â If it blocks a blood vessel that feeds the brain, it causes a stroke.
