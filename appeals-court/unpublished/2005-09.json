E. Bonnoitt, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-514\r\nHeard June 15, 2005 â€“ Filed September 7, 2005Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRonald R. Norton, of Conway, for Appellant.\r\nKevin Michael Hughes, of N. Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Christopher Aumick appeals from a family court order denying him custody of his daughter, arguing that the court erred in finding there had not been a substantial change in circumstances warranting a change in custody and that the court erred in awarding Theresa Russell attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n    In late 1998, Aumick (Father) and Russell (Mother) entered into a relationship that produced an out-of-wedlock daughter, Jessica, who was born in June 1999.Â  The family court issued a final order in December 2000 granting permanent custody of Jessica to Mother, setting child support, and providing for visitation.Â  In August 2002, Mother sought an increase in child support and Father counterclaimed for custody of Jessica based on a change in circumstances.Â  After a final hearing, the family court denied Fatherâ€™s request for change in custody.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n    I. Change in Custody \r\n      Father argues the family court erred in denying him custody of his daughter because there had been a substantial change in circumstances.Â  However, as a result of events that occurred after Father filed this appeal, Father has now been granted temporary custody of Jessica.Â  Therefore, Father has withdrawn this issue from consideration on appeal and we need not address it. \r\n      II.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\n      Father also argues the family court erred in awarding Mother attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\n      The award of attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse of discretion.Â  Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 61, 552 S.E.2d 329, 336 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  When deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay, whether beneficial results were obtained by the attorney, the financial conditions of the parties, and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fees on each party.Â  Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 645, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In determining what amount of attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded, the court should consider â€œthe nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; the time necessarily devoted to the case; the professional standing of counsel; the contingency of compensation; the beneficial results obtained; and the customary legal fees for similar services.â€Â  Id. at 645-646, 506 S.E.2d at 534.Â  The order reflects the court considered the necessary factors, and we therefore find the family court did not abuse its discretion.\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n      HEARN, C.J., BEATTY, and SHORT, J.J. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-515","title":"State v.

Williams, of\r\n        Orangeburg; Gregory Samuel Forman, of Charleston; for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Both\r\nparties appeal the family courtâ€™s order awarding Hope Hix Stillinger (Wife)\r\nalimony and establishing the equitable division of marital property.&nbsp; We\r\naffirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nTommy Mayfield Stillinger (Husband)\r\nand Wife were married on April 16, 1984.&nbsp; At the time of the marriage,\r\nHusband owned a residence, farm, and several businesses.&nbsp; Wife had\r\nlittle to no assets and was working as a bank teller.&nbsp; After their\r\nmarriage, the parties continued to operate the convenience store, grocery, and\r\nfarm.&nbsp; Wife went to work in Husbandâ€™s businesses as a cashier as well as\r\nthe bookkeeper.\r\nThe parties relocated the grocery\r\nand constructed a new building.&nbsp; Wife continued to help manage the\r\ngrocery.&nbsp; In 1999, the â€œinside of the storeâ€ was sold and the parties\r\nretained the land and building, which was then leased for $2,500 per\r\nmonth.&nbsp; In addition, Husband signed a covenant not to compete that paid him\r\n$1,100 per month.&nbsp; The parties continued to operate the convenience store,\r\nwhich was significantly expanded.&nbsp; Wife continued to serve as the\r\nbookkeeper for the store.\r\nThe reasons for the breakup of the\r\nmarriage are in dispute.&nbsp; Wife accused Husband of being unfaithful after\r\nreceiving phone calls from an unknown female caller.&nbsp; The caller\r\nknew details regarding where Husband was at particular times.&nbsp;\r\nAdditionally, Husband accused Wife of mismanaging the convenience store and of\r\ncausing the store to lose money.&nbsp; Wife began seeing several doctors for\r\nmedical problems, as well as a psychologist as a result of the marriage breaking\r\napart.&nbsp; According to Wife, Husband was less than supportive and stated he\r\nwas planning on getting a divorce.\r\nHowever, marital litigation\r\ncommenced when Wife filed for separate support and maintenance, equitable\r\ndivision of the property and debt, alimony, and other relief.&nbsp; After\r\nholding a pendente lite hearing, the court issued a temporary\r\norder, allowing Wife to continue working in the convenience store and to draw\r\n$500 per week for the work.&nbsp; Wife later amended her complaint to seek a\r\ndivorce based upon one yearâ€™s separation.\r\nAfter a hearing, the court granted\r\nthe divorce and divided the marital assets and debt with sixty percent given to\r\nHusband and forty percent to Wife.&nbsp; The court found no marital misconduct\r\nby either party.&nbsp; The court awarded Husband the businesses and all the\r\npartiesâ€™ debt as part of the division.&nbsp; Wife was allocated personal\r\nproperty and $45,100 in a cash adjustment.&nbsp; Finally, the court awarded\r\nalimony to Wife in the amount of $500 per month and denied attorneyâ€™s fees to\r\nboth parties.&nbsp;\r\nThe court denied each partyâ€™s\r\nmotion to reconsider.&nbsp; Wife filed an appeal and Husband cross-appealed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nWifeâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the family court err in\r\n    identifying, valuing, and apportioning the marital property?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the family court err in\r\n    awarding Wife only $500 in alimony when she alleges it is insufficient to\r\n    meet her needs?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the family court err in\r\n    failing to award Wife her attorneyâ€™s fees?\r\n\r\nHusbandâ€™s Appeal\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the family court err in\r\n    failing to account for revenue Husband alleges Wife lost in mismanaging the\r\n    convenience store?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n    Did the family court err in\r\n    awarding Wife $500 in alimony?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court,\r\nthis court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance\r\nof the evidence. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C.\r\n199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992); Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 546,\r\n466 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996).&nbsp; However, this broad scope of review\r\ndoes not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.&nbsp; Stevenson\r\nv. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).&nbsp; Nor must\r\nwe ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in\r\na better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to\r\ntheir testimony.&nbsp; Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d\r\n541, 541 (1981); Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 516, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139\r\n(Ct. App. 2003).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEquitable Division\r\nHusband argues the family court\r\nshould have considered the amount of money Wife allegedly lost or removed from\r\nthe convenience store in determining the equitable distribution of the\r\nparties.&nbsp; In contrast, Wife contends the court erred in its determination\r\nof the marital property and its value.&nbsp; Additionally, Wife asserts the\r\ncourt erred in failing to make an even apportionment.[1]&nbsp; We disagree with both parties and find the\r\nfamily court properly divided the marital estate.\r\nThe apportionment of marital\r\nproperty is within the discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed\r\non appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&nbsp; Morris v. Morris, 295 S.C.\r\n37, 39, 367 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).&nbsp; Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina\r\nCode provides that the family court must consider fifteen factors and give each\r\nweight as it determines.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004).\r\nOn review, this court looks to the\r\nfairness of the overall apportionment, and if the end result is equitable, the\r\nfact that this court might have weighed specific factors differently than the\r\nfamily court is irrelevant.&nbsp; Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289,\r\n300-01, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988); see Doe v. Doe, 324\r\nS.C. 492, 502, 478 S.E.2d 854, 859 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating the reviewing court\r\nwill affirm the family court judgeâ€™s apportionment of marital property if it\r\ncan be determined that the judge addressed the relevant factors under section\r\n20-7-472 with sufficiency for the reviewing court to conclude the judge was\r\ncognizant of the statutory factors).\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHusbandâ€™s Claim\r\nHusband asserts the family court\r\nerred by failing to consider economic misconduct and the contribution of each\r\nspouse in making the equitable distribution.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nAs stated above, the court is\r\nrequired to consider the factors found in section 20-7-472 in making its award\r\nof marital property.&nbsp; Section 20-7-472(2) requires consideration of â€œmarital\r\nmisconduct or fault of either or both parties, whether or not used as a basis\r\nfor a divorce as such, if the misconduct affects or has affected the economic\r\ncircumstances of the parties.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(2) (Supp.\r\n2004).&nbsp; According to section 20-7-472(3), the court is also to consider the\r\nâ€œcontribution of each spouse to the acquisition, preservation, depreciation,\r\nor appreciation in value of the marital property, including the contribution of\r\nthe spouse as homemaker; provided, that the court shall consider the quality of\r\nthe contribution as well as its factual existence.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n20-7-472(3) (Supp. 2004).&nbsp; Finally, no one factor is dispositive and this\r\ncourt will affirm if it can be concluded that the court considered the relevant\r\nfactors.&nbsp; Doe, 324 S.C. at 502, 478 S.E.2d at 859.\r\nThe convenience store began losing\r\nmoney in 2000 and the losses continued thereafter.&nbsp; At trial, Husband\r\nasserted Wife as the bookkeeper and manager of the store was most responsible\r\nfor the losses. &nbsp;However, Wifeâ€™s expert witness, a CPA, testified\r\nthe main reason for the losses was due to the ban on video poker and the\r\nsignificant debt incurred in the expansion of the store.&nbsp; She testified\r\nthat before 2000, the business would have shown only marginal income if it did\r\nnot have the video poker income.&nbsp; Additionally, the expert testified\r\nthat without the video poker income, the store would not be able to cover the\r\ndebt incurred in the expansion.&nbsp;\r\nWhile the CPA testified the cost of\r\ngoods sold went up by five percent, due most likely to employee theft, there is\r\nnothing in the record to indicate the losses were a result of any action taken\r\nby Wife.&nbsp; The CPA also noted Wife took money out of the business, as did\r\nHusband.&nbsp; The CPA was not able to find any material amount removed by Wife.&nbsp;\r\nAdditionally, Husband was aware of several additional loans taken out on\r\nbehalf of the store in order to cover bounced checks and debts owed.\r\nThe court considered the testimony\r\nregarding the misconduct in its order, finding:&nbsp; â€œBased upon the evidence\r\npresented at trial, there is no way for me to determine exactly how much cash\r\nmoney [Wife] may have taken from the business.â€&nbsp; We find the court\r\nproperly considered the actions of Wife and found there was insufficient\r\nevidence from which it could assign an amount of depreciation in value to Wifeâ€™s\r\nmisconduct.&nbsp;\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWifeâ€™s Claim\r\nWife argues it was error for the\r\nfamily court to consider the Farm Service Agency debt as marital debt.&nbsp;\r\nAdditionally, Wife contends other debts, such as the debt to Husbandâ€™s son,\r\nshould not be considered as marital debts.&nbsp; Finally, Wife asserts the court\r\nerred in only awarding her forty percent of the marital property.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.\r\nMarital debts are to be considered\r\nin the equitable distribution of marital property.&nbsp; Marital debt is defined\r\nas â€œdebt incurred for the joint benefit of the parties regardless of whether\r\nthe parties are legally jointly liable for the debt or whether one party is\r\nlegally individually liable.â€&nbsp; Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433,\r\n436-37, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993).&nbsp; Section 20-7-472 â€œcreates a\r\npresumption that a debt of either spouse incurred prior to marital litigation is\r\na marital debt and must be factored in the totality of equitable apportionment.â€&nbsp;\r\nHardy, 311 S.C. at 436, 429 S.E.2d at 813.&nbsp; However, debt assumed\r\nafter the filing of marital litigation does not have the presumption that it is\r\nmarital.&nbsp; The party seeking to include the debt in the division of marital\r\nproperty must show it was incurred for the benefit of the parties.&nbsp; Wooten\r\nv. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, ___, 615 S.E.2d 98, 105 (2005).\r\nThe Farm Service Agency debt was\r\nclearly incurred after the initiation of marital litigation.&nbsp; Accordingly,\r\nthe burden fell on Husband to show it was incurred for the benefit of the\r\nparties.&nbsp; Husband testified money was taken out of the farm and used to pay\r\noff debts owed by the convenience store.&nbsp; Additionally, evidence was\r\npresented that Husband, the convenience store, and the farm all shared one main\r\naccount post-separation.&nbsp; Checks from the account were used to pay back\r\ncash taken from the convenience store.&nbsp;\r\nThe family court held the portion of\r\nthe Farm Service Agency debt that was attributable to the marital property\r\nshould be considered in the equitable distribution.&nbsp; The court found the\r\nparties used the debt to their benefit by covering payments made out of the farm\r\naccount to the convenience store.&nbsp; Given Husband has shown the debt was\r\nincurred for the benefit of both parties, even though after the instigation of\r\nmarital litigation, we find the court did not err in including the debt in its\r\nequitable distribution.\r\nWifeâ€™s arguments related to other\r\nimproperly considered debts, including the debt to Husbandâ€™s son, were not\r\nraised in the motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; Accordingly, they are not\r\nproperly before this court for review on appeal.&nbsp; See Wilder\r\nCorp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is\r\naxiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\nhave been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\nappellate review.â€); Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d\r\n122, 124 (1991) (holding when a trial court does not explicitly rule on an\r\nargument raised, and appellant makes no Rule 59(e) motion to obtain a ruling,\r\nthe appellate court may not address the issue).\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the\r\nfamily court properly considered all relevant factors in making its\r\ndetermination of an equitable distribution.&nbsp; The court correctly included\r\nall marital property, both assets and debts, in its determination.&nbsp; Husband\r\nbrought substantially more into the marriage and was also charged with all of\r\nthe marital debt.&nbsp; As a result, the court awarded him sixty percent of the\r\nmarital property, including the income producing property from which he is to\r\npay the debt.&nbsp; Furthermore, to the extent Wife challenges the accuracy of\r\nHusbandâ€™s financial declaration and his valuation of marital assets and debts,\r\nwe find any question regarding these amounts turned on credibility, particularly\r\nthat of Husband and Wifeâ€™s expert witness.&nbsp; Because the court was in a\r\nbetter position to evaluate their credibility, we defer to the courtâ€™s\r\nfindings.&nbsp; Based on the foregoing, we hold there was no abuse of discretion\r\nin the division provided by the family court.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAlimony Award\r\nBoth parties assert the family court\r\nerred in awarding Wife $500 in alimony.&nbsp; Husband contends the amount is too\r\nhigh, as Wife could provide more for her own support.&nbsp; He further contends\r\nthe court failed to consider Wifeâ€™s fault in the marital breakup and that\r\nHusbandâ€™s income will be substantially reduced in the future.&nbsp; Wife\r\nclaims the amount is too low as it fails to provide an adequate amount to\r\nsustain the lifestyle she became accustomed to during the marriage and does not\r\nmeet her future needs.&nbsp; We disagree with both parties and find the family\r\ncourtâ€™s award was proper.\r\nAn award of alimony rests within the\r\nsound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse\r\nof discretion.&nbsp; Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569\r\nS.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).&nbsp; â€œAlimony is a substitute for the support which\r\nis normally incident to the marital relationship.â€&nbsp; Johnson v.

App. 1997) (â€œSouth Carolina law provides that the\r\nfamily court judge may grant alimony in such amounts and for such term as the\r\njudge considers appropriate under the circumstances.â€).&nbsp; However, alimony\r\nshould not serve as a disincentive for spouses to improve their employment\r\npotential or to dissuade them from providing, to the extent possible, for their\r\nown support.&nbsp; Williamson v. Williamson, 311 S.C. 47, 49, 426 S.E.2d\r\n758, 760 (1993).\r\nFactors to be considered in making\r\nan alimony award include:&nbsp; (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and\r\nemotional health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4)\r\nemployment history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living\r\nestablished during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings\r\nof the parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties;\r\n(8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children;\r\n(10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support\r\nobligations; as well as (13) other factors the court considers relevant.&nbsp;\r\nS.C.

Lide, 277 S.C. 155, 157, 283 S.E.2d 832,\r\n833 (1981).\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHusbandâ€™s Claim\r\nIn analyzing Husbandâ€™s claim, we\r\nnote the family court stated it considered all relevant statutory factors.&nbsp;\r\nThe court concluded Wife had the ability to provide some support for herself,\r\nand it recognized she removed money from the convenience store for her personal\r\nuse.&nbsp; Accordingly, it appears the court considered all the issues raised by\r\nHusband in making its award of alimony to Wife.&nbsp;\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWifeâ€™s Claim\r\nWife maintains the court did not\r\nadequately consider her health concerns and her prior standard of living in\r\nawarding her only $500 per month in alimony.&nbsp; The court expressly stated it\r\nconsidered the factors in section 20-3-130.&nbsp; The court found while Wife was\r\nearning $26,000 to $31,000 a year working at the convenience store, she would\r\nnot be able to earn that in the market.&nbsp; However, the court found she\r\nretained marketable skills for which she could be employed.&nbsp; The court then\r\ndetermined the appropriate amount of income to impute was $20,000 to $21,000,\r\nwhich we find Wife should be able to maintain.\r\nAdditionally, the court explicitly\r\nconsidered her medical and psychological needs when determining the award of\r\nalimony.&nbsp; The court found:&nbsp; â€œAn alimony award will assist [Wife]\r\nwith health insurance costs and health related expenses . . . . While [Wifeâ€™s]\r\nemotional and physical diagnosis do not prevent her from working, she does incur\r\nhealth related expenses in these areas.â€&nbsp;\r\nThe record supports the courtâ€™s\r\nfindings regarding Wifeâ€™s health.&nbsp; Wife was able to work in the partiesâ€™\r\nconvenience store while Dr. Boland and Dr. Hamilton treated her for physical and\r\nemotional issues.&nbsp; She presented testimony of her hypertension, as well as\r\nthe psychological issues she faces.&nbsp; Both treating doctors testified she\r\nwould need further care and treatment. &nbsp;However, Wife testified she\r\nis able to work and has pursued employment.&nbsp; &nbsp;Accordingly, we\r\nfind the court properly considered her health and ability to work in making its\r\ndetermination of alimony.\r\nFinally, the court properly\r\nconsidered the partiesâ€™ standard of living.&nbsp; The court found the parties\r\nhad a comfortable standard of living, especially prior to the loss of the video\r\npoker revenue in the convenience store.&nbsp; The court ruled:&nbsp; â€œI find\r\n[Wifeâ€™s] current and reasonably anticipated expenses as shown on her financial\r\ndeclaration are high.&nbsp; A large part of [Wifeâ€™s] expenses are applied to\r\ninstallment payments on debts [Wife] shows as living expenses.â€&nbsp; The\r\ncourt continued by finding:&nbsp; â€œ[Wifeâ€™s] expenses as shown on her\r\nfinancial declaration would support a higher standard of living than I find that\r\nthe parties enjoyed prior to their separation.â€&nbsp;\r\nWe find the family court properly\r\nconsidered Wifeâ€™s standard of living prior to the separation in making its\r\ndetermination that $500 per month was sufficient alimony.&nbsp; The court\r\nawarded Wife forty percent of the marital property, including a large amount of\r\ncash with which she can eliminate any remaining debt she may have\r\nincurred.&nbsp; With the equitable distribution, the alimony, and her likely\r\nincome from employment, Wife should be able to maintain a standard of living\r\nsimilar to that during the marriage.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find the family court\r\ndid not err in awarding Wife $500 per month in alimony.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s\r\nFees\r\nWife contends the family court erred\r\nin failing to award her attorneyâ€™s fees.&nbsp; She maintains the court\r\nimproperly balanced the requisite factors and found she could pay her own\r\nfees.&nbsp; We disagree and find the court did not abuse its discretion in\r\nrefusing to award attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nPursuant to section 20-3-130(H) of\r\nthe South Carolina Code, the family court may order one party to pay a\r\nreasonable amount to the other for attorneyâ€™s fees and costs incurred in\r\nmaintaining an action for divorce.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(H) (Supp.\r\n2004); Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 464, 486 S.E.2d 516, 524 (Ct. App.\r\n1997).&nbsp; An award of attorneyâ€™s fees will not be overturned absent an\r\nabuse of discretion.&nbsp; Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368\r\nS.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).&nbsp; In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees,\r\nthe family court should consider the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fee,\r\nthe beneficial results obtained by counsel, the respective financial conditions\r\nof the parties, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of\r\nliving.&nbsp; E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816\r\n(1992).&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe find the financial conditions of\r\nthe parties are similar and the impact of the fees would be nearly the same on\r\neach.&nbsp; As the court found, Wife was granted a significant cash adjustment\r\nas well as alimony from which she could make her attorneyâ€™s fee\r\npayments.&nbsp; She has no debt from the marriage other than what she incurred\r\nsince the separation.&nbsp; Given our conclusions above, we find the awards to\r\neach party were equally beneficial.&nbsp; The court properly considered the\r\nfactors in making its decision regarding attorneyâ€™s fees.&nbsp; Accordingly,\r\nwe conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wife attorneyâ€™s\r\nfees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family court properly\r\ndetermined, valued, and apportioned the marital property.&nbsp; Additionally, we\r\nconclude the court did not commit an abuse of discretion in setting the amount\r\nof alimony awarded.&nbsp; Finally, we find the court did not err in declining to\r\naward Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.&nbsp; Accordingly, the decision of the family\r\ncourt is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY and SHORT, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Although we note Wife raises as a separate issue that the\r\nfamily court erred in its findings of fact, we have implicitly incorporated our\r\nanalysis of this issue into our discussion of Wifeâ€™s remaining three\r\nissues.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-517","title":"Turbeville v.

Turner, III, and partial summary judgment to Dr.\r\nThomas Wilson.[1]&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 30, 1997,\r\nseventy-five-year-old Edwin Turbeville, Sr. (the decedent), was admitted to the\r\nhospital for hip replacement surgery.&nbsp; Because of the prior removal of the\r\ndecedentâ€™s large intestine, he developed the post-operative complication of a\r\nsmall bowel obstruction after his small intestines dropped into his\r\npelvis.&nbsp; Thomas Wilson, M.D., surgically removed the bowel obstruction on\r\nJuly 13, 1997, and inserted a Baker tube in the bowel to maintain bowel\r\nfunction.&nbsp; Dr. Wilson also inserted a nasogastric tube (NG-Tube) to aid in\r\nthe removal of excess gastric fluids while the decedent recovered.&nbsp; Because\r\nthe decedent appeared to improve and his lab work was normal, Dr. Wilson removed\r\nthe NG-Tube on the morning of Friday, July 18, 1997.&nbsp; Thereafter, Dr.\r\nWilson asked Leslie Stewart, M.D., a surgeon from another practice and with whom\r\nDr. Wilson shared on-call duties, to check on the decedent throughout the\r\nweekend from the evening of July 18, 1997 until July 20, 1997.&nbsp;\r\nOther physicians who saw the\r\ndecedent during that time period included Robert E. Turner, III, M.D., an\r\ninternist, whose partner was the decedentâ€™s primary care physician.&nbsp; On\r\nJuly 20, 1997, the decedent suffered from abdominal pain, nausea, difficulty\r\nbreathing, a drop in blood pressure, and chest congestion, and Dr. Turner was\r\nthe physician who was consulted the most regarding the decedentâ€™s\r\ncondition.&nbsp; That evening, the decedent vomited gastric fluid, aspirated the\r\nvomit, and had to be placed on a ventilator.&nbsp; The decedentâ€™s condition\r\ncontinued to deteriorate, he suffered from cardiac arrest, and he died early the\r\nnext morning. &nbsp;No autopsy was ever performed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn July 20, 2000, Mary Turbeville (Turbeville),\r\ndecedentâ€™s wife and the personal representative of decedentâ€™s estate, filed\r\na medical malpractice action against Drs. Wilson and Turner alleging causes of\r\naction for wrongful death and for the decedentâ€™s unnecessary pain and\r\nsuffering.&nbsp; Turbeville alleged that Dr. Wilson was negligent in the\r\nperformance of a surgical procedure in July 1997 to correct the decedentâ€™s\r\nbowel obstruction and vicariously liable for the negligence of Dr. Stewart\r\nduring post-operative care.&nbsp; She also alleged Dr. Turner was negligent in\r\nhis care of the decedent on the day of his death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDuring discovery, Turbeville deposed\r\nexpert Dr. Edward R. McLean, a board-certified general and bariatric\r\nsurgeon.&nbsp; Dr. McLean opined that the decedent may have had a bowel\r\nobstruction with the Baker tube in place, causing a leak.&nbsp; However, McLean admitted that he could not actually determine from the medical\r\nrecords that the decedent had a leak.&nbsp; Dr. McLean stated that the NG-Tube\r\nshould not have been removed on July 18, 1997, because the decedent had a very\r\nhigh gastric fluid output.&nbsp; He also testified that he believed the decedent\r\ndied of an intra-abdominal catastrophe causing cardiorespiratory decompensation.&nbsp; McLean believed the death could have been prevented through abdominal\r\nx-rays, obtaining blood gasses, replacement of the NG-Tube, and a suctioning of\r\nthe lungs.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBoth Dr. Wilson and Dr. Turner moved\r\nfor summary judgment.&nbsp; The trial court granted summary judgment as to the\r\nallegations against Dr. Turner and partially granted Dr. Wilsonâ€™s motion for\r\nsummary judgment.&nbsp; The court granted summary judgment as to the allegations\r\nthat Dr. Wilson negligently performed the corrective bowel surgery and that Dr.\r\nWilson was responsible for the negligence of Dr. Stewart.&nbsp; The court ruled\r\nâ€œthe sole issue for trial will be whether or not Dr. Wilson deviated from any\r\nstandards of medical practice in removing the NG-Tube from the decedent on July\r\n18, 1997, and whether this removal proximately caused injury, damage, and/or\r\ndeath to the decedent.â€&nbsp; Turbeville then filed a motion for\r\nreconsideration.&nbsp; Before the trial court could rule on that motion,\r\nTurbeville filed this appeal.&nbsp; Based on a lack of jurisdiction given the\r\npending appeal, the trial court declined to hear the motion for\r\nreconsideration.&nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a\r\nsummary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which\r\ngoverns the trial court under Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure:&nbsp; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.&nbsp; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493-94, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860\r\n(2002).&nbsp; In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the\r\nevidence and all inferences, which can reasonably be drawn therefrom, must be\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice,\r\n350 S.C. 315, 324, 566 S.E.2d 536, 540 (2002).&nbsp; â€œIf triable issues exist,\r\nthose issues must go to the jury.â€&nbsp; Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C.\r\n714, 718, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate\r\nwhen further inquiry into the facts is necessary to clarify the application of\r\nthe law.&nbsp; Vermeer Carolinaâ€™s, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp.,\r\n336 S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d 301, 305 (Ct. App. 1999).&nbsp; All ambiguities,\r\nconclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most\r\nstrongly against the moving party.&nbsp; Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 120, 542 S.E.2d\r\n736, 738 (Ct. App. 2001).&nbsp; When the parties do not dispute the facts, but\r\nonly the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment\r\nshould be denied.&nbsp; Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 173-74, 561 S.E.2d\r\n654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; Moreover, summary judgment is a drastic remedy,\r\nwhich should be cautiously invoked so no person will be improperly deprived of a\r\ntrial of the disputed factual issues.&nbsp; Lanham v. Blue Cross and Blue\r\nShield, 349 S.C. 356, 363, 563 S.E.2d 331, 334 (2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Dr. Turner\r\nTurbeville claims the trial court\r\nerred in granting summary judgment to Dr. Turner because expert testimony or, at\r\nleast, common knowledge, presented a reasonable inference that Dr. Turnerâ€™s\r\nnegligence proximately caused the death of the deceased.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nA. Expert Testimony\r\nMedical malpractice is the failure\r\nof a physician to exercise that degree of care and skill that is ordinarily\r\nemployed by the profession under similar conditions and in like surrounding\r\ncircumstances.&nbsp; Keaton v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 496, 514\r\nS.E.2d 570, 574 (1999); Jernigan v. King, 312 S.C. 331, 333, 440 S.E.2d\r\n379, 381 (Ct. App. 1993).&nbsp; To sustain a medical malpractice action, the\r\nplaintiff must establish by expert testimony both the required standard of care\r\nand the defendantâ€™s failure to conform to that standard.&nbsp; Botehlo v.\r\nBycura, 282 S.C. 578, 583, 320 S.E.2d 59, 62 (Ct. App. 1984).&nbsp; The\r\nreason for requiring expert testimony is that matters of proper medical\r\ndiagnosis and treatment ordinarily involve â€œâ€˜technical knowledge beyond the\r\nken of the laymen.â€™â€&nbsp; Bessinger v. DeLoach, 230 S.C. 1, 11, 94\r\nS.E.2d 3, 8 (1956) (quoting Hill v. Parker, 122 P.2d 476, 482 (Wash. 1942)).&nbsp; Expert testimony is not\r\nrequired in medical malpractice cases in situations where the common knowledge\r\nor experience of laymen is extensive enough for them to recognize or infer â€œnegligence\r\non the part of the doctor and also to determine the presence of the required\r\ncausal link between the doctorâ€™s actions and the patientâ€™s medical problems.â€&nbsp;\r\nPederson v. Gould, 288 S.C. 141, 142, 341 S.E.2d 633, 634 (1986); Hickman\r\nv. Sexton Dental Clinic, P.A., 295 S.C. 164, 168, 367 S.E.2d 453, 455 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1988).\r\nAlthough physicians in one field of\r\npractice may testify as to the standard of care owed by a physician in another\r\nfield of practice, the expert witness must profess knowledge of the applicable\r\nstandard of care and provide a basis for having acquired that knowledge.&nbsp; See,\r\ne.g., Lee v. Suess, 318 S.C. 283, 286, 457 S.E.2d 344, 346 (1995)\r\n(holding a plastic surgeon could testify as to the standard of care owed by\r\nfamily practitioners because he stated his awareness of the standard of care and\r\nshowed proof of acquiring that knowledge); Botehlo, 282 S.C. at 587, 320\r\nS.E.2d at 65 (holding an orthopedic surgeon could not testify to the standard of\r\ncare owed by a podiatrist because he admitted his unfamiliarity with the\r\nstandard of care).&nbsp;\r\nDr. McLean admitted in his\r\ndeposition that he was not competent to address the standard of care owed by an\r\ninternist, such as Dr. Turner, or whether an internist deviated from that\r\nstandard of care.&nbsp; Dr. McLean further testified that there was not anything\r\nDr. Turner did or did not do that caused the decedentâ€™s death.&nbsp;\r\nTurbeville did not present any other expert testimony regarding the standard of\r\ncare of an internist or whether Dr. Turner deviated from that standard.&nbsp;\r\nThus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Turbeville, no expert\r\ntestimony was presented to support the allegation of medical malpractice against\r\nDr. Turner.&nbsp; The trial court appropriately granted him summary\r\njudgment.&nbsp; Botehlo, 282 S.C. at 583, 320 S.E.2d at 62-63 (noting\r\nthat on a defendantâ€™s motion for summary judgment, there will be no issue of\r\nmaterial fact unless the plaintiff presented expert testimony of the standard of\r\ncare and the breach of the standard by the defendant).&nbsp;\r\nB.&nbsp; Common Knowledge\r\nException\r\nTurbeville argues Dr. Turnerâ€™s\r\nactions were such that a person of ordinary knowledge or experience could infer\r\nimproper professional conduct so experts were not needed.&nbsp; Turbeville\r\npoints to Dr. Turnerâ€™s failure to reinsert the NG-Tube, failure to react to\r\nthe decedentâ€™s drop in blood pressure, decision to prescribe Lasix, and\r\nfailure to react to other symptoms exhibited by the decedent, as being issues\r\nwithin the ambit of common knowledge and experience of laypersons.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn discussing the common knowledge\r\nexception, this court has noted that:\r\n\r\n  Where the evidence permits the\r\n  jury to recognize or infer a breach of duty without the aid of expert\r\n  testimony, such testimony is not required in order for the case to go to the\r\n  jury.&nbsp; The application of the common knowledge exception in proving\r\n  negligence in a case involving medical malpractice depends on the particular\r\n  facts of the case.&nbsp; When expert testimony is not required, the plaintiff\r\n  must offer evidence that rises above mere speculation or conjecture.&nbsp;\r\n  And, where the evidence permits the jury to recognize or infer a breach of\r\n  duty without the aid of expert testimony, such testimony is not required for\r\n  the case to go to the jury.\r\n\r\nHickman, 295 S.C. at 168, 367\r\nS.E.2d at 455 (citations omitted).\r\nDr. Turner and various nurses who\r\nwere in charge of the decedent on the day of his death testified regarding the\r\ndecedentâ€™s symptoms, various medical treatments given to combat those\r\nsymptoms, and the decedentâ€™s reaction to the treatments.&nbsp; Dr. McLean,\r\nTurbevilleâ€™s own expert witness, stated â€œwhether an NG-Tube should have been\r\nput in or not, thatâ€™s debatable.â€&nbsp; He also opined this issue posed â€œa\r\ncomplex question,â€ insinuating a lay jury would not be able to resolve the\r\nissue without the benefit of expert testimony.&nbsp; Reviewing the testimony and\r\nthe issues involved in the case, the trial court determined that â€œlay jurors\r\nare not capable of understanding the complex medical issues that are the subject\r\nof this lawsuit.â€&nbsp; The court noted that the case involved complex medical\r\nquestions including the purpose of NG-Tubes, when NG-Tubes should be used or\r\nremoved, when NG-Tubes should be replaced, what measures should be taken when a\r\npatientâ€™s blood pressure drops, what measures must be taken when a patient\r\nvomits or becomes tachycardic, and when blood gas tests need to be\r\nperformed.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe agree with the trial court.&nbsp;\r\nThe issues considered in this medical malpractice action dealt with the\r\ndiagnosis and treatment of an intensive care patient with numerous medical\r\nproblems.&nbsp; The treatment of those medical problems required the expert\r\nknowledge of a physician trained in such areas.&nbsp; What treatments should\r\nhave been utilized and when they should have been administered are not questions\r\nwithin the ambit of common knowledge.&nbsp; Accordingly, the common knowledge\r\nexception does not apply.[2]&nbsp;\r\nII.\r\nDr. Wilson\r\nTurbeville argues the trial court\r\nerred in granting partial summary judgment to Dr. Wilson because evidence\r\nthrough expert testimony and the common knowledge of laymen supported the\r\nallegation that Wilsonâ€™s negligence\r\ncaused the decedentâ€™s death.&nbsp; Turbeville also argues that Dr. Stewart was\r\nthe agent of Dr. Wilson, and thus, Dr. Wilson is responsible for Dr. Stewartâ€™s\r\nnegligence.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nA.&nbsp; Expert Testimony\r\nTurbeville asserts that Dr. McLeanâ€™s\r\ntestimony supported an inference that Dr. Wilson was negligent in performing the\r\ncorrective bowel surgery.&nbsp; He argues that Dr. McLeanâ€™s testimony\r\nsupported his allegation that the use of the Baker tubes was negligent.&nbsp;\r\nThus, she argues, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment with regard\r\nto allegations concerning the surgery.&nbsp;\r\nDr. McLean testified regarding the\r\nuse of a Baker tube during the surgery to prevent future bowel obstruction\r\nformations.&nbsp; Because the â€œbenefits [were] so low in using a Baker tube\r\nand the risks [were] significant,â€ Dr. McLean called into question Dr. Wilsonâ€™s\r\nuse of the procedure.&nbsp; However, he never stated that the use of the Bakerâ€™s\r\ntube was a deviation from the standard of care expected of general\r\nsurgeons.&nbsp; Furthermore, he testified â€œthe Baker tube itself didnâ€™t\r\ncause [decedentâ€™s] death.â€&nbsp; In addition, because no tests were\r\nperformed, Dr. McLean noted that â€œ[t]hereâ€™s a lot thatâ€™s unknown in this\r\ncase.â€&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDr. McLean was unable to state to a\r\nreasonable degree of medical certainty that the use of the Baker tube most\r\nprobably resulted in any complications or proximately caused harm.&nbsp; Because\r\nthere was no evidence that the use of the Baker tube deviated from the standard\r\nof care, Turbeville failed to establish through expert testimony that Dr. Wilson\r\ndeviated from the standard of care in performing the decedentâ€™s surgery.&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, we find no error with the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment\r\nas to the surgery.[3]\r\nB.&nbsp; Common Knowledge\r\nException\r\nCiting Cox v. Lund, 286 S.C.\r\n410, 334 S.E.2d 116 (1985), Turbeville argues that Dr. Wilsonâ€™s own testimony\r\nshowed that he could not properly view the decedentâ€™s bowel obstruction when\r\nhe operated.&nbsp; Thus, she argues, a person of ordinary knowledge would\r\nrealize that Dr. Wilson was negligent in performing the surgery.&nbsp;\r\nIn Cox, the defendant\r\nphysician attempted to perform a colonoscopy, which resulted in a perforation of\r\nthe colon.&nbsp; Cox, 286 S.C. at 413, 334 S.E.2d at 118.&nbsp; The\r\nplaintiff presented expert medical testimony that the colon was â€œtotally\r\nunpreparedâ€ for the procedure such that the physician could not see.&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 417, 334 S.E.2d at 120.&nbsp; In fact, the defendant physician himself\r\nadmitted that the colonoscope should not be advanced when the doctor is unable\r\nto adequately see.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nThe supreme court held â€œ[e]xpert testimony is not required to establish\r\nnegligence when the act complained of was done in the face of a proscription\r\nknown to the actor.â€&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nDr. Wilson testified that while\r\nattempting to surgically relieve the decedentâ€™s bowel obstruction, there came\r\na point in time where he could not see the obstruction because he was required\r\nto reach into the decedentâ€™s bowels.&nbsp; However, he performed a â€œblunt\r\ndissectionâ€ in which he manually manipulated the area to relieve the\r\nobstruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis case is clearly distinguishable\r\nfrom the facts in Cox.&nbsp; Although Dr. Wilson could not see when he\r\nperformed the blunt dissection, nothing indicates that this method deviated from\r\nthe standard of care.&nbsp; Dr. McClean did not testify that Dr. Wilson deviated\r\nfrom the standard of care in freeing the bowel adhesions by means of blunt\r\ndissection.&nbsp; Moreover, Dr. Wilson never admitted his technique was\r\ninappropriate or deviated from the standard of care.&nbsp; Because there was no\r\nadmission from Dr. Wilson himself that his actions deviated from the standard of\r\ncare, a layperson could not determine in this complex medical case whether Dr.\r\nWilsonâ€™s actions in performing a blunt dissection were negligent without the\r\naid of an expert.&nbsp; Thus, the common knowledge exception does not apply in\r\nthis case.&nbsp;\r\nC.&nbsp; Liability for Dr.\r\nStewart\r\nCiting Wilson v. Martin Memorial\r\nHospital, 61 S.E.2d 102 (N.C. 1950), Turbeville claims Dr. Wilson is liable\r\nfor any negligence committed by Dr. Stewart because Dr. Stewart was Dr. Wilsonâ€™s\r\nagent.&nbsp;\r\nWhen a physician for one reason or\r\nanother is â€œtemporarily unable to attend the patient personally, the\r\nphysician, without being viewed as having either abandoned or neglected his\r\npatient, may make provision for a competent physician to attend the patient.â€&nbsp;\r\nJohnston v. Ward, 288 S.C. 603, 610-11, 344 S.E.2d 166, 170 (Ct. App.\r\n1986), overruled on other grounds by Spahn v. Town of Port\r\nRoyal, 330 S.C. 168, 499 S.E.2d 205 (1998).&nbsp; â€œIn the absence of\r\nnegligence in making the substitution, the physician is not liable for injuries\r\nresulting from the substitute physicianâ€™s want of skill or care unless the\r\nsubstitute physician is in his employ or is his agent or partner.â€&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 611, 344 S.E.2d at 170-71.\r\nInitially, we note Turbeville does\r\nnot claim Dr. Wilson was negligent in making the substitution of Dr.\r\nStewart.&nbsp; Further, there is no evidence in this case that Dr. Wilson\r\nexercised any control over Dr. Stewart.&nbsp; Dr. Wilson and Dr. Stewart were\r\nnot partners in the same practice, Dr. Wilson did not supervise Dr. Stewart, and\r\nDr. Stewart did not consult Dr. Wilson on the days he covered for him.&nbsp; Dr.\r\nStewart testified that his role as the substituting physician was â€œto care for\r\nthe patient just like they were your patient.â€&nbsp; Thus, Dr. Stewart was\r\nfree to use his own discretion, knowledge, and skill in the care of the patient\r\nwithout any control, interference, or input from Dr. Wilson.&nbsp; Most\r\nimportantly, the trial court ruled that â€œDr. Stewartâ€™s actions or inactions\r\ndid not proximately cause Mr. Turbevilleâ€™s death.â€&nbsp; Turbeville did not\r\nappeal from this finding.&nbsp; See Brading v. County of Georgetown,\r\n327 S.C. 107, 113, 490 S.E.2d 4, 7 (1997) (holding that an unchallenged ruling,\r\nright or wrong, is the law of the case).&nbsp; The evidence does not support a\r\nfinding of agency in this case.&nbsp;\r\nFurther, we find the North\r\nCarolina case of Wilson v. Martin Memorial Hospital is distinguishable\r\nfrom the facts in the present case.&nbsp; In Wilson, a patientâ€™s treating\r\nobstetrician ordered a second physician to oversee her delivery.&nbsp; The\r\ndelivery resulted in serious, permanent injuries to the patient.&nbsp; The\r\nsecond physician testified that he was handicapped in making decisions, that he\r\nhad no authority to do what he wanted to do, and that he could not use his own\r\njudgment in making decisions regarding the patientâ€™s care.&nbsp; The Wilson court found that the second physician was the agent of the\r\ntreating physician.&nbsp; Wilson,\r\n61 S.E.2d at 104.&nbsp;\r\nAs previously discussed, there is no\r\nevidence that Dr. Wilson exercised control over Dr. Stewartâ€™s decisions in\r\ntreating the decedent or that Dr. Stewart was â€œhandicappedâ€ in making care\r\ndecisions.&nbsp; Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that Wilson\r\nis inapplicable to the case at hand.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light\r\nmost favorable to Turbeville, we find no error with the trial courtâ€™s decision\r\nto grant summary judgment to Dr. Wilson on the issue of vicarious\r\nliability.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nViewing the evidence in the light\r\nmost favorable to Turbeville, the trial court properly granted summary judgment\r\nas to Dr. Taylor and partial summary judgment as to Dr. Wilson.&nbsp; For the\r\nreasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKITTREDGE, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Turbeville also asserts that the trial court did not view\r\nthe facts in the light most favorable to Turbeville in granting summary\r\njudgment.&nbsp; As will be discussed in further detail, we have reviewed the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to Turbeville and found no error with the\r\ntrial courtâ€™s rulings.&nbsp; There is no evidence that the trial court applied\r\nthe wrong standard.&nbsp; Thus, this argument has no merit.&nbsp;\r\n[2]&nbsp; Turbeville also claims Dr. Turnerâ€™s silence, after\r\ndecedentâ€™s son told him his belief that the situation with his father was not\r\nnormal, was an admission of guilt.&nbsp; In Greene v. Lilliewood, 272\r\nS.C. 186, 193, 249 S.E.2d 910, 913 (1978), upon being asked if leaving an IUD in\r\nthe patient caused problems, the physician â€œlooked embarrassed and nodded his\r\nhead.â€&nbsp; The court treated the physicianâ€™s response as an\r\nadmission.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; In this case, Dr. Turner simply did not reply to the\r\nstatement.&nbsp; We refuse to treat his silence to this statement as an\r\nadmission.&nbsp;\r\n[3] Turbeville also argues on appeal Dr. Wilson\r\nnegligently removed the NG-Tube.&nbsp; However, because the trial court denied\r\nsummary judgment on this issue, we need not address this argument.&nbsp; See\r\nOlson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 168, 580 S.E.2d\r\n440, 444 (2003) (holding that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not\r\nappealable).&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-518","title":"SCDSS v.

McIntosh, Senior\r\n        Assistant Attorney General Charles H. Richardson; and Solicitor W.\r\n        Barney Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Edmond\r\nStanley Adams, III., appeals his convictions of&nbsp; Criminal Sexual Conduct in\r\nthe First Degree, Armed Robbery and Kidnapping. &nbsp;We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn Sunday night, August 16, 1998, Adams\r\nasked a co-worker, Victim, to give him a ride home after work from Mr. Friendlyâ€™s\r\nin exchange for a marijuana cigarette.&nbsp; Victim drove Julie Myrick, another\r\nco-worker, home first because her residence was closer.&nbsp; Afterwards, Victim\r\nproceeded to Adamsâ€™ house.&nbsp; On the way to Adamsâ€™ house, Adams\r\ntalked about his girlfriend.&nbsp; Upon arriving at Adamsâ€™ home, Victim stayed in the car, while he went inside to get\r\nthe marijuana cigarette.&nbsp; He came back out and told Victim that his\r\ngirlfriend was awake and wanted to meet her.&nbsp; Victim went into his\r\nhouse.&nbsp; Once inside, Adams pretended to have a\r\nconversation with someone in the house, and asked Victim to wait in a bedroom to\r\nmeet his girlfriend.&nbsp; Victim complied, and shortly thereafter Adams\r\nentered the bedroom, alone, with two belts and a knife.&nbsp; At that time Adams\r\ntold Victim that she was his girlfriend.\r\nAdams hit Victim and demanded she undress.&nbsp; He pushed her onto\r\nthe bed and removed her pants.&nbsp; He repeatedly struck her head.&nbsp; When\r\nshe refused to take off her bra, he put the knife to her throat and threatened\r\nher life.&nbsp; Then he tied her hands behind her back with his belt and forced\r\nher to engage in oral sex, as well as vaginal and anal intercourse. &nbsp;While\r\nhe was raping her, Victim became ill, and had diarrhea on the sheets.&nbsp; Adams\r\nallowed her to go to the bathroom to clean herself.&nbsp; When she refused to\r\ncome out of the bathroom, he barged in and dragged her out.&nbsp; Adams\r\ntied her ankles together with another belt and demanded she tell him if she had\r\nany money and where the keys were to her car.&nbsp; Adams\r\ninformed Victim that he was going outside to move her car, and if she was not in\r\nthe exact same position when he returned, he would kill her.&nbsp; While Adams was gone, she untied the belts and pushed out a window\r\nscreen.&nbsp; She jumped out the window, using a curtain to cover herself.&nbsp;\r\nVictim ran down the street screaming and looking for help, but no one heard her.\r\n&nbsp;Eventually, Adams tackled her into a ditch full of\r\nwater.&nbsp; He strangled her and held her head down in the ditch, choking her\r\nuntil she passed out. &nbsp;She woke up screaming, so Adams\r\nforced her head into the ditch again and she lost consciousness a second\r\ntime.&nbsp; When she awakened, Adams made her drive around\r\nfor a while.&nbsp; Later, he made her lie down in the backseat while he drove\r\nback to his house.&nbsp; Adams demanded she shower, and he\r\nraped her again.&nbsp;\r\nVictimâ€™s mother and boyfriend were\r\nconcerned when Victim did not arrive home as expected that evening.&nbsp; After\r\nshe had been missing for a few hours, they called the owner of Mr. Friendlyâ€™s,\r\nMr. Krsitian Niemi, and he subsequently called the police.&nbsp; Niemi informed\r\nthe police that Victim had offered to drive Myreck and Adams home after work.\r\nAs Adams was\r\nraping her again, the police knocked at his door.&nbsp; He answered the door,\r\ndressed only in a towel, and the police asked him if Victim was at his\r\nhouse.&nbsp; She dressed while the officers were questioning him about her\r\nwhereabouts.&nbsp; Adams instructed her to tell the officers that â€œeverything was fine.â€&nbsp;\r\nShe whispered to one of the officers that â€œSomething has happened.â€&nbsp;\r\nOfficer William Meyer noted that Victimâ€™s voice was not normal.&nbsp; Finally\r\nable to escape, Victim left Adamsâ€™ house and drove\r\nhome.&nbsp;\r\nOnce she arrived at her motherâ€™s\r\nhouse, she told her mother what had transpired, and her mother called the police\r\nand EMS.&nbsp; Victim told law enforcement that it was Adams who had raped\r\nher, held her hostage, assaulted her and stolen money from her.&nbsp; She was\r\ntaken to the emergency room where her physical injuries were documented, and a\r\nrape protocol kit was performed by Dr. Alexis Klock.&nbsp; She sustained\r\nbruising and redness on her neck, bruising and redness to her eye, imprints of\r\nfinger marks around her neck, scratch marks on her breast, abdomen and stomach,\r\nand brush burn marks and abrasions on both knees and thighs. &nbsp;Dr. Klockâ€™s\r\nexamination of Victim revealed the presence of blood and fecal matter on\r\nVictim.&nbsp; No spermatozoa was detected, but Dr. Klock indicated that sperm is\r\nnot always found.&nbsp; Victim was found to have experienced trauma consistent\r\nwith vaginal and anal rape. &nbsp;Victim continued to have difficulty with her\r\neye after the incident.&nbsp; Several days later, she scheduled an appointment\r\nwith Dr. John Hindersman, an ophthalmologist.&nbsp; He diagnosed her with\r\ntraumatic subconjunctival hemorrhage caused by blunt trauma, most likely a fist,\r\nto her eye.&nbsp; The injury was consistent with her description of Adamsâ€™\r\nattack.\r\nOnce Victim was at the hospital,\r\nOfficer Meyer went back to the scene.&nbsp; He found a bare footprint in the mud\r\nnear Adamsâ€™ residence as well as a ditch full of water.&nbsp; The next\r\nday, her bracelet was found in the ditch, and dirt and debris were found in her\r\ncar.&nbsp; A search warrant was executed for Adamsâ€™ home.\r\nAfter knocking and announcing their\r\npresence at the front and side doors to no avail, the officers broke into the\r\nside door of Adamsâ€™ home.&nbsp; They entered, discovered Adams\r\nhiding under the couch and arrested him.&nbsp; At the house, they found dirt and\r\ndebris in the bathtub, as well as long blond-brown hair in the drain.&nbsp; Upon\r\nfurther investigation, they found a window screen that had been pushed-out onto\r\nthe ground.&nbsp; All of the other screens were intact in their respective\r\nwindows. &nbsp;The window with the missing screen had broken cobwebs, evidence\r\nof being recently opened.&nbsp; Additionally, the officers found paint chips and\r\nflecks on the window sill and on the bricks below the window.&nbsp; The paint\r\nhad recently been chipped, because the wood where the paint was missing was\r\nlighter than wood on other areas of the house exposed to the weather.&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, because of recent rain in the area, the officers knew that the window\r\nhad just been pushed out because the paint chips and flecks had not yet been\r\nwashed away.\r\nDr. Donna Schwartz-Watts, an expert\r\nin the field of forensic psychiatry, said that Victimâ€™s reaction to the\r\nofficers when they appeared at Adamsâ€™ house the night of\r\nthe kidnapping and rape was normal.&nbsp; Victim was desperately trying to\r\nescape and was not thinking rationally.&nbsp; Dr. Schwartz-Watts averred that\r\nVictim is suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder due to the incident.\r\nAdams\r\nrepresented himself at trial. The trial judge appointed Mr. McCulloch as standby\r\ncounsel.&nbsp; The trial proceeded and the jury convicted him of all three\r\ncharges, criminal sexual assault, kidnapping and armed robbery.&nbsp; He was\r\nsentenced to twenty-five years for kidnapping, twenty-five years for first\r\ndegree criminal sexual assault and fifteen years for armed robbery to be served\r\nconsecutively.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate court may review\r\ncriminal cases for errors of law only.&nbsp; State v. Wilson,\r\n345 S.C. at 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001), State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520,\r\n608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004), State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575\r\nS.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003). &nbsp;Unless clearly erroneous, this court is bound\r\nby the trial courtâ€™s factual findings. &nbsp;Id.\r\nat 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829. &nbsp;Upon review, this court is limited to determining\r\nwhether or not the trial judge abused his discretion. &nbsp;Id.&nbsp;\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDelay of Trial\r\nAdams argued that delaying his case beyond 180 days violated the South\r\nCarolina Constitution and his right to a speedy trial.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court\r\naffirmed the trial court that refused to quash an indictment due to the Stateâ€™s\r\nfailure to act upon the warrant within 90 days as provided by then Circuit Court\r\nRule 95 because the rule was administrative rather than jurisdictional.&nbsp; State\r\nv. Culbreath, 282 S.C. 38, 39, 316 S.E.2d 681, 681 (1984).&nbsp; The court\r\nexplained:\r\n\r\n  Rule 95 is an administrative rule\r\n  adopted for the purpose of insuring an orderly and prompt disposition of cases\r\n  in the Circuit Court. While the rule is designed to secure a prompt handling\r\n  of cases, it was not intended to be the criterion for determining whether the\r\n  constitutional guaranty of a speedy trial has been met.&nbsp; Therefore, the\r\n  failure of the solicitor to act upon a warrant within ninety (90) days, as\r\n  required by Rule 95, does not within itself invalidate a warrant or prevent\r\n  subsequent prosecution.\r\n\r\nId. at 39-40, 316 S.E.2d at 681. Circuit Court Rule 95, the\r\npredecessor to Rule 3, was crafted to insure an orderly and prompt disposition\r\nof cases in the Circuit Court.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Although the rule was created to insure the prompt\r\nhandling of cases, the rule was not designed to be a constitutional guaranty of\r\na speedy trial.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Adams has no right to a trial\r\nwithin 180 days.&nbsp;\r\nSince there is no guarantee to a\r\nspeedy trial and only a promise of efficiency, Adams must prove that he was\r\nprejudiced by the delay in trial and that the State was negligent and willful in\r\ndenying him a more prompt trial.&nbsp; State v. Dukes, 256 S.C. 218, 182\r\nS.E.2d 286 at 288 (1971).&nbsp; This appellate court must carefully consider the\r\nlength of delay, reason for delay, defendantâ€™s assertion of a right to a\r\nspeedy trial and any prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay.&nbsp; Barker\r\nv. Wingo, 407 U.S.  514 (1972).&nbsp; The appellant was held\r\nfor twenty-one months without a trial.&nbsp; However, since his arrest, the\r\nappellant has been appointed six attorneys and has released six attorneys.&nbsp;\r\nOn the eve of a scheduled date for trial, one of the experts for the state\r\nsuffered a heart attack. &nbsp;Another time, the trial was delayed to wait for a\r\npsychiatric report on Adams to make certain he was\r\ncompetent to stand trial.&nbsp; Moreover, before the jury was struck in this\r\ncase, Adams made a motion for a continuance claiming that\r\nhe had not been able to put forth a meaningful defense.&nbsp; Adams\r\nfailed to show that the state acted willfully and negligently or that he was\r\nprejudiced.&nbsp; The trial judge correctly ruled that there was no prejudice\r\ncaused by the delay in Adamsâ€™ trial.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIndictmentsâ€”Filing\r\nAdams asserts that the indictments were not properly filed with the\r\nClerk of Court, in violation of Rule 3 of SCRCrimP rendering the Circuit Court\r\nwithout jurisdiction to hear his case.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThis argument is without\r\nmerit.&nbsp; All three indictments were properly filed with the clerk of courtâ€™s\r\noffice as is evidenced on the face of the documents.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSufficiency of the Indictment\r\nAdams argues that the Circuit Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\r\nbecause the kidnapping indictment did not sufficiently notify him of what he had\r\nto meet at trial.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nCases combining the concept of the\r\nsufficiency of an indictment with the concept of subject matter jurisdiction\r\nwere overruled by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 105, 610 S.E.2d 494, 501\r\n(2005).&nbsp; â€œThe indictment is the charge of the state against the\r\ndefendant, the pleading by which he is informed of the fact, and the nature and\r\nscope of the accusation.â€&nbsp; Id. at 102, 610 S.E.2d at 499.&nbsp; The Gentry court\r\nexplained:\r\n\r\n  The indictment is a notice\r\n  document. A challenge to the indictment on the ground of insufficiency must be\r\n  made before the jury is sworn as provided by Â§ 17-19-90. If the objection is\r\n  timely made, the circuit court should judge the sufficiency of the indictment\r\n  by determining whether (1) the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and\r\n  particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the\r\n  defendant to know what he is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an\r\n  acquittal or conviction thereon; and (2) whether it apprises the defendant of\r\n  the elements of the offense that is intended to be charged.&nbsp; In\r\n  determining whether an indictment meets the sufficiency standard, the court\r\n  must look at the indictment with a practical eye in view of all the\r\n  surrounding circumstances.&nbsp; Further, whether the indictment could be more\r\n  definite or certain is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Id. at 102-03, 610 S.E.2d at 500\r\n(internal citations omitted).&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUpon viewing the indictment with a\r\npractical eye, the indictment must provide Adams and the\r\ncourt with sufficient certainty of the crime committed.&nbsp; State v.\r\nReddick, 348 S.C.631, 560 S.E.2d 441 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; â€œAn indictment\r\nis sufficient if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and\r\nparticularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, the\r\ndefendant to know what he is called upon to answer, and if an acquittal or a\r\nconviction thereon may be pleaded as a bar to any subsequent prosecution.â€&nbsp;\r\nState v. Towery, 300 S.C. 86, 386 S.E.2d 462 (1989). &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe indictment stated, â€œThat\r\nEdmond Stanley Adams III, did in Richland County on or about August 17th,1998,\r\nunlawfully seize, confine, inveigle, decoy, kidnap, abduct or carry away any\r\nperson to wit Victim by any means whatsoever without an authority of lawâ€.&nbsp;\r\nThe indictment was clear upon its face. &nbsp;When Adams\r\nreceived this indictment he was made aware that he was being charged for his\r\nillegal confinement of Victim on August 17, 1998.&nbsp; As required, the\r\nindictment contained the necessary elements of the offense charged and\r\nadequately informed Adams as to what he had to meet at trial.&nbsp; There was no challenge\r\nto the indictment prior to the jury being sworn, and the indictment meets the\r\npractical eye requirement. &nbsp;Viewing the indictment with a practical eye\r\npursuant to Â§ 17-19-90 and the Supreme Courtâ€™s holding in Gentry, we\r\nfind that the trial court did not err in finding the indictment sufficient.\r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPost-Trial Motions\r\nAdams states\r\nthat he should have received a written order granting or denying his post-trial\r\nmotion(s).&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nAdams is\r\nrelying on Rule 29 SCRCrimP regarding this issue on appeal.&nbsp; However, this\r\nissue is without merit. Rule 29 SCRCrimP states:\r\n\r\n  â€œThe time for appeal for all\r\n  parties shall be stayed by a timely post trial motion and shall run from the\r\n  receipt of written notice of entry of the order granting or denying such\r\n  motion.â€\r\n\r\nAll of Adams\r\npost-trial motions were denied after a hearing, and Rule 29 does not require a\r\nseparate written order.&nbsp; Such a requirement would be unduly burdensome on\r\nthe courts.&nbsp; We observe that Adams was the party who\r\nfiled the intent to appeal which transferred jurisdiction to this court.\r\n&nbsp;The trial court did not err by omitting written post-trial orders.\r\nV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSearch Warrant\r\nAdams claims\r\nthat he was not properly served with a search warrant and thus the evidence\r\nfound in his house should have been suppressed.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe appellate court is bound by the\r\ntrial courtâ€™s factual findings, including preliminary factual findings in\r\ndetermining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases, unless they\r\nare clearly erroneous.&nbsp; State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d\r\n827, 829 (2001). &nbsp;The trial court held a pre-trial hearing on the validity\r\nof the search warrant, and found the search warrant to be valid.&nbsp; Adams\r\nargued before, during and after trial that he was not served with a copy of the\r\nsearch warrant. &nbsp;This is in direct opposition to the pre-trial hearing\r\ntestimony of Officer Thomas Thomas who stated that he read the search warrant to Adams.\r\n&nbsp;Officer Thomas left the search warrant on the kitchen table at Adamsâ€™\r\nhome while Adams was being transported to Richland County Detention Center.&nbsp;\r\nWe conclude that the search warrant was properly executed and that the trial\r\ncourt did not err by refusing to suppress evidence.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis issue may not be preserved for\r\nreview because Adams did not object to the admission of the\r\nphotographs of his home based on the service of the search warrant.&nbsp; See\r\nState v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 428, 462 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1995)\r\n(mentioning a party cannot argue one ground below and then argue another ground\r\non appeal).&nbsp; However, if preserved, the issue is without merit.\r\nVI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBatson Issue\r\nAdams asserts\r\nthat his rights were violated when the judge sat five of the jurors he\r\nstruck.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\n&nbsp;The Equal Protection Clause\r\ndoes not allow the State â€œto challenge potential jurors solely on account of\r\ntheir race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable\r\nimpartially to consider the Stateâ€™s case against a black defendant.â€&nbsp; Batson\r\nv. Kentucky, 476 U.S.  79, 89 (1986).&nbsp; Likewise, the Equal\r\nProtection Clause prohibits a criminal defendant from engaging in purposeful\r\ndiscrimination on grounds of race in the exercise of peremptory\r\nchallenges.&nbsp; See generally Georgia v. McCollum,\r\n505 U.S. 42 (1992). &nbsp;Before the jury was chosen, the judge\r\nexplained to the state and to Adams that if a juror was\r\nstruck solely because of race or gender, that juror would automatically be\r\nseated. &nbsp;Both the state and Adams stated that they understood the judgeâ€™s instructions.&nbsp;\r\nAfter the state made the Batson motion, Adams gave\r\nrace neutral reasons for only five of his ten strikes.&nbsp; By Adams own admission, five of the strikes were based purely on\r\ndiscriminatory reasons.&nbsp; State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 512 S.E.2d 500\r\n(1999).&nbsp; State v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 519 S.E.2d 793 (Ct. App.\r\n1999).\r\nFurthermore, Adams\r\ndid not object when the subsequent jurors were sat.&nbsp; Adams\r\nis therefore precluded from raising an issue on appeal that he failed to object\r\nto during the procedure.&nbsp; State v. Hurd, 325 S.C. 384, 480 S.E.2d 94\r\n(Ct. App. 1996).&nbsp; He is estopped from raising this issue because he failed\r\nto object contemporaneously and on a specified ground. &nbsp;No issue may be\r\nraised for the first time on appeal, instead it must have been raised at trial\r\nin order to preserve the issue for appeal.&nbsp; State v. Nichols, 325\r\nS.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118 (1997).&nbsp; The trial judge correctly sat the jurors\r\nin question.\r\nVII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJuror #126\r\nAdams argues that Juror #126 should have been removed.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.\r\nAfter the trial began, Juror #126\r\nmade it known to the court and to counsel that he did know one of the potential\r\nwitnesses in the case.&nbsp; When asked originally if he knew an April Weber,\r\nthe Juror responded in the negative.&nbsp; His reason for such is that he did\r\nnot know her by her last name.&nbsp; The potential witness, who was not called\r\nto testify in the trial, worked as a switchboard operator at the place where the\r\nJuror was employed.&nbsp; The Juror was employed at that business for twenty\r\nyears, whereas the potential witness had only worked there for a year.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  The question of the impartiality\r\n  of the juror is addressed to the discretion of the trial Judge . . . and the\r\n  scope of inquiry on Voir dire is within the sound discretion of the Circuit\r\n  Judge, . . . and he has the exclusive power to determine a jurorâ€™s\r\n  competency and a finding on such is not reviewable except for error of law . .\r\n  . If the question of the indifference of a juror is a mere question of fact,\r\n  it is not reviewable upon appeal unless the conclusion of the trial Judge is\r\n  wholly unsupported by the evidence . . . If there is evidence, however,\r\n  tending to support the finding of the jurorâ€™s competency, there is no error\r\n  of law.\r\n\r\nState v. Johnson, 248 S.C.\r\n153, 163-64, 149 S.E.2d 348, 353 (1966) (internal citations omitted). &nbsp;The\r\ntrial judge asked the Juror whether or not his knowledge of the potential\r\nwitness would affect his ability to be a fair and impartial juror.&nbsp; The\r\nJuror answered in the negative, and stated that he would not have any difficulty\r\nbeing fair or impartial.&nbsp; By asking the juror if he would be prejudiced\r\ntowards Adamsâ€™ and upon hearing that no such prejudice\r\nwould occur, the trial judge properly sat the juror pursuant to his discretion\r\nand in accordance with Johnson.&nbsp;\r\nAdams neglected to raise the issue of juror #126 at trial.&nbsp;\r\nTherefore it is not preserved for appellate review.&nbsp; Hurd, 325 S.C.\r\n384, 480 S.E.2d 94; Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118.&nbsp; The\r\ntrial court did not err in allowing Juror #126 to sit on the jury panel.\r\nVIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Juror\r\nImpartiality\r\nAdams questions the impartiality of the jury on appeal.&nbsp;\r\nPost-trial, he informed the trial judge that he had sued the South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Mental Health and that several of the jurors were employed by the\r\nDepartment of Mental Health.&nbsp; However, Adams heard the places of employment of all the jurors when they were\r\npolled prior to trial.&nbsp; Moreover, the jurors who worked for the Department\r\nof Mental Health were struck and did not serve on the jury.&nbsp; This argument\r\nis without merit.\r\nAdams states that there were â€œmajor conflictsâ€ with the other\r\njurors.&nbsp; However, he has failed to identify what these â€œmajor conflictsâ€\r\nare.&nbsp; Additionally, he did not object at trial; therefore, there is no\r\nissue preserved for appeal.&nbsp; State v. Williams, 303 S.C. 410, 401\r\nS.E.2d 168 (1991).\r\nIX.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nClosing Argument\r\nAdams appeals on the grounds that the solicitorâ€™s comments in her\r\nclosing argument were improper and that she showed inappropriate pictures. Adamsâ€™\r\nargues that he should be granted a mistrial based on the comments regarding the\r\nWeber incident.&nbsp; We disagree\r\nNot every improper argument requires\r\nreversal as long as it is not prejudicial to the defendant.&nbsp; State v.\r\nCooper, 334 S.C. 540, 514 S.E.2d 584 (1999).&nbsp; The trial judge is given\r\nconsiderable discretion in considering the scope and appropriateness of the\r\nclosing argument of the solicitor.&nbsp; State v. Durden, 264 S.C. 86,\r\n212 S.E.2d 587 (1975).&nbsp; The control of arguments is usually within the\r\nsound discretion of the trial judge, and that discretion will not be questioned\r\nunless there is evidence of clear abuse.&nbsp; State v. Stroman, 281 S.C.\r\n508, 514, 316 S.E.2d 395 (1984).&nbsp; The trial judge did not err by not\r\ndeclaring a mistrial.&nbsp;\r\nThe Solicitor must stay within the\r\nrecord and its reasonable inferences.&nbsp; State v. Linder, 276 S.C.\r\n304, 278 S.E.2d 335 (1981).&nbsp; The judge warned Adams of â€œopening the doorâ€ to the Weber incident.&nbsp; However,\r\non cross-examination of Officer Thomas, Adams insisted upon\r\nasking Officer Thomas about the Weber case.&nbsp; The court then gave the state\r\npermission to question Officer Thomas regarding Weber, because Adams had â€œopened the doorâ€.&nbsp; Selective testimony about Weber\r\nwas heard during trial.\r\nCurative instruction to disregard\r\nincompetent evidence and not to consider it during deliberation is deemed to\r\nhave cured any alleged error in its admission. &nbsp;State v. Kesley, 331\r\nS.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998).&nbsp; During the closing argument, the state\r\npresented:&nbsp; â€œAnd we were limited to how much we could get into it, but is\r\nbefore you now, ladies and gentlemen, as we know that on July the 4th,\r\n1997, another young girl accused this man of the same thing.&nbsp; Criminal\r\nsexual conduct in the first degree and kidnapping.â€&nbsp; Adams\r\nobjected, arguing he was not charged with criminal sexual conduct in the first\r\ndegree.&nbsp; The State explained he was charged with such, and the trial court\r\nsaid, â€œ[T]he jury will remember what evidence has been introduced and you will\r\nmake your decision based on those elements and not what either one of these\r\nlawyers tell you.â€&nbsp; The State was allowed to proceed.&nbsp; The solicitor\r\nreferencing Adamsâ€™ house said, â€œ[h]is house where he\r\nbrutally raped and kidnapped another young woman.â€&nbsp; Adams\r\nobjected again.&nbsp; The trial court agreed the reference was improper, and\r\nreminded the jury of his previous limiting instruction making it clear that he\r\nwould again give a limiting instruction in the jury charge. &nbsp;\r\nAssuming error by the Solicitor, the\r\ntrial court ruled with Adams and gave a curative\r\ninstruction.&nbsp; Such an instruction is deemed to have cured the alleged\r\nerror.&nbsp; In light of the entire record, the instruction adequately cured any\r\nimproper arguments.&nbsp; The record reveals overwhelming evidence of Adamsâ€™\r\nguilt.&nbsp; Furthermore, because Adams fails to\r\ndemonstrate both error and prejudice, the trial court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in denying the motion for mistrial.\r\n&nbsp;Adams\r\nargues that the State showed pictures of Weber during the closing argument that\r\nwere not introduced into evidence.&nbsp; Upon examination of the record based on\r\nthe cite that Adams provided, there were no pictures\r\nintroduced in the closing argument.&nbsp;\r\nWe conclude that any error was\r\nharmless.&nbsp; â€œWhether an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of\r\nthe particular case. &nbsp;No definite rule of law governs this finding; rather,\r\nthe materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from\r\nits relationship to the entire case.â€&nbsp; State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C.\r\n572, 573 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).&nbsp; Abundant evidence in the record\r\npoints to Adamsâ€™ guilt, and, thus, any defects in the Stateâ€™s closing\r\nargument would not have affected the outcome of the trial.&nbsp; Id.\r\n(â€œError is harmless when it â€˜could not reasonably have affected the result\r\nof the trial.â€™â€) (quoting State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 93-94, 180\r\nS.E.2d 888, 890 (1971)).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Adamsâ€™\r\nconvictions and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ.,\r\nconcur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-521","title":"State v.

Hoisington, of Charleston, for\r\n        Appellant.\r\n        Assistant Appellate Defender\r\n        Eleanor Duffy Cleary, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Jonathan\r\nFrazier pleaded guilty to armed robbery and was sentenced to a sentence not to\r\nexceed six years under the Youthful Offenders Act, South Carolina Code section\r\n24-19-10 to 160 (Supp. 2004).&nbsp; The State appeals, arguing that the trial\r\njudge erred by denying its motion to reconsider the sentence because Frazier did\r\nnot qualify as a youthful offender.&nbsp; We reverse.[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFACTS\r\nDuring the morning of November 5,\r\n2001, Frazier and two others planned and carried out a robbery at the Fairfield\r\nInn in North Charleston.&nbsp; While Frazier and Antonio\r\nStaley waited in the truck, Lawanda Collins went inside the hotel and propped\r\nthe dinning room door open for Frazier.&nbsp; Frazier entered the hotel through\r\nthe opened door, wearing a nylon mask and carrying an unloaded rifle.&nbsp; He\r\nthen took the hotel clerk to the bathroom and secured it by tying the door shut\r\nwith an extension cord.&nbsp; Frazier helped Staley carry the hotel safe out to\r\nthe truck and Collins helped them put it in the truck.&nbsp; Staley went back\r\ninto the hotel to wipe off their fingerprints.&nbsp; After leaving the hotel,\r\nall three went home and unloaded the safe.&nbsp; Later that day they tried to\r\nopen the safe with a sledgehammer, but it broke, so they had to buy a torch and\r\nget three other people to help them with it.&nbsp; When they almost had the safe\r\nopen, Staley wanted to take it somewhere else so the others would not have\r\naccess to it.&nbsp; After driving the safe to Sheep Island,\r\nthe three opened the safe and split the cash equally.&nbsp; The three then\r\nburned all the checks and gift certificates from the safe and hid the safe in Mt. Pleasant by the water.\r\nFrazier gave a written statement to\r\nthe police on December 7, 2001 and was willing to testify against Staley.&nbsp;\r\nOn June 26, 2003, Frazier pleaded guilty to armed robbery.&nbsp; The trial judge\r\nsentenced Frazier to a sentence not to exceed six years under the Youthful\r\nOffenders Act, South Carolina Code section 24-19-10 to 160 (Supp. 2004).&nbsp;\r\nThe judge did not order credit for the 557 days Frazier had served awaiting\r\ntrial.&nbsp; The State filed a motion to reconsider the sentence on June 27,\r\n2003.&nbsp; The judge heard and denied the motion on November 20, 2003.&nbsp;\r\nThe State now\r\nappeals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State\r\nargues that the trial judge erred by denying its motion to reconsider the\r\nsentence because Frazier did not qualify as a youthful offender.&nbsp; We agree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code section\r\n24-19-10(d)(ii) (Supp. 2004) defines a â€œyouthful offenderâ€ as an offender\r\nwho is â€œseventeen but less than twenty-five years of age at the time of\r\nconviction for an offense that is not a violent crime . . . and that is a\r\nmisdemeanor, a Class D, Class E, or Class F felony, or a felony which provides\r\nfor a maximum term of imprisonment of fifteen years or less.â€&nbsp; Frazier\r\nwas twenty-four years old at the time of his guilty plea and he pled guilty to\r\narmed robbery.&nbsp;\r\nThe South Carolina Code designates\r\narmed robbery as a â€œviolent crimeâ€ and establishes that it is a class â€œAâ€\r\nfelony.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 16-1-60 and 90(A) (Supp. 2004).&nbsp; The Code\r\nalso provides that, as a felony, armed robbery carries a â€œmandatory minimum\r\nterm of not less than ten years or more than thirty years, no part of which may\r\nbe suspended or probation granted.â€&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A)\r\n(2003).&nbsp; Therefore, the State correctly argues that Frazier does not\r\nqualify as a youthful offender under the Act.&nbsp;\r\nâ€œA trial judge generally has wide\r\ndiscretion in determining what sentence to impose.â€&nbsp; State v. Franklin,\r\n267 S.C. 240, 246, 226 S.E.2d 896, 898 (1976).&nbsp; â€œ[T]his court has no\r\njurisdiction to review a sentence, provided it is within the limits provided by\r\nstatute for the discretion of the trial court, and is not the result of\r\nprejudice, oppression or corrupt motive.â€&nbsp; Id.; State v. Benning, 338 S.C. 59,\r\n64, 524 S.E.2d 852, 856 (Ct. App. 1999).&nbsp;\r\nâ€œ[T]he effect of the enactment of\r\n[the Youthful Offenders Act] statute was to provide alternative methods of\r\nsentencing youthful offenders, leaving the decision as to its application in\r\neach case to the discretion of the trial judge.â€&nbsp; Powell v. State,\r\n262 S.C. 592, 595, 206 S.E.2d 883, 884 (1974).&nbsp; However, â€œ[t]he exercise\r\nof a sound judicial discretion must and should be performed in every case with a\r\nconscientious regard for what is just and proper under the circumstances.â€&nbsp;\r\nState v. Scates, 212 S.C. 150, 155-56, 46 S.E.2d 693,\r\n695 (1948).&nbsp; Here, because Frazier does not qualify as a youthful offender\r\nunder the Act, the trial judge erred by denying the Stateâ€™s motion to\r\nreconsider Frazierâ€™s sentence.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.&nbsp;\r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and SHORT, J.J.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-522","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A jury found Hugh Lussardi guilty of first degree burglary and grand larceny.Â  He was sentenced to life in prison for first degree burglary and five years for grand larceny.Â  Lussardi appeals, arguing the indictment was insufficient, the trial court erred by allowing the State to introduce Lussardiâ€™s two prior burglary convictions because they were more prejudicial than probative, and the trial court erred by sentencing Lussardi to life imprisonment without parole because his two prior burglaries were committed in a continuous course of conduct.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\n&nbsp;\r\n FACTS\r\n    On January 28, 2002, Jody Mabry returned home from work and discovered that the doors to his garage[2] were open.Â  Upon inspection, Mabry noticed that the walk-in door had been smashed and his four-wheeler was missing.Â  Mabry also noticed fresh four-wheeler tracks leading out of the building, around the building, through the woods behind the building, and then turning right onto Mount Olive Road.Â  After discovering that his four-wheeler was gone, Mabry walked to his grandmotherâ€™s house to inquire if she had seen anyone around his house during the day.Â  Mabry then returned home and called the police.Â  Officer Randall Bogan dusted for fingerprints on the garage and on a bar that was used to pry the door open, but he was unable to get any prints.\r\n    Sheila Culbreth, who is Mabryâ€™s Aunt and lives across the street from Mabry, testified she heard her dogs barking that afternoon, so she went to her door to see what was outside.Â  When she looked outside, she saw two men walking up the road.Â  She testified that one of the men had long blonde hair and was wearing a type of cap on his head.Â  She said the other man had dark hair.Â  Culbreth said she did not get a good look at their faces because they never looked at her.Â  Shortly after Culbreth saw the two men in the street, she heard a banging noise and something running in the distance, but she did not see anything.Â  Culbreth saw the dark-haired man, who she later identified as Lussardi, again about two or three days later when she found him standing in her driveway when she came home from work.Â  She saw his face and noticed that he had a beard. \r\n    Thomas Lawter testified that Lussardi was at his house on January 28 and Lussardi wanted him to help him â€œgo get a four-wheeler.â€Â  The two men had been drinking at Lawterâ€™s house.Â  Lawter said Lussardi used a steel rod to break into Mabryâ€™s garage and then drove Mabryâ€™s four-wheeler out of the garage.Â  Lawter said he was scared and hid in the woods while Lussardi broke into the building, but he got on the back of the four-wheeler after Lussardi had stolen it.Â  The two of them then rode the four-wheeler through the woods to Lawterâ€™s house on Corn Mill Road and parked the vehicle behind Lawterâ€™s house.Â  The next morning, Lussardi sold the four-wheeler to a third party.Â  Lawter gave a statement to the sheriffâ€™s department on February 7, 2002, after the police had come to his house looking for Lussardi.Â  Lawter agreed to plead guilty to the charge.Â  Lawter said that he had long gray hair and was wearing a bandana at the time of the incident.Â Â Â Â  \r\n    Lussardi was found guilty of first degree burglary and grand larceny.Â  He was sentenced to life in prison for first degree burglary and five years for grand larceny.Â  Lussardi made a motion for a new trial, which was denied.Â  Lussardi now appeals.Â \r\n \r\n    \r\n \r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n          I.Â  IndictmentÂ Â Â Â Â  \r\n        \r\n            Lussardi argues the trial court erred by allowing the case to go forward as a first degree burglary case and by denying his motion for new trial because the indictment was insufficient.Â  We disagree.\r\n            On appeal, Lussardi claims the indictment failed to give him notice of what he was called upon to defend and failed to protect him against double jeopardy because it stated that Lussardi entered Mabryâ€™s â€œdwelling.â€Â  Lussardi did not directly raise this issue to the trial judge as a defect in the indictment, but indirectly raised it in his request to suppress Lussardiâ€™s prior record on the basis that the statute violates the United States and South Carolina Constitutions.Â  Lussardi argued that Mabryâ€™s garage â€œwas a building, not a dwelling; and therefore to allow the introduction into evidence of his prior record merely for the purposes of establishing a burglary first brings into question his ability to defend himself because he has a right not to be incriminated.â€[3]Â  In response, the trial judge ruled that â€œbased upon that case law and those prior determinations by our courts, I find that the defendantâ€™s motion to preclude and exclude such evidence should be denied.â€Â  Because the issue of whether the indictment failed to give him notice of what he was called upon to defend and failed to protect him against double jeopardy was not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge, the issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  However, even if this issue were properly preserved, we find no error.Â  \r\n            A person is guilty of first degree burglary â€œif the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling, and . . . (2) the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A) (2003). Â For purposes of this statute, â€œâ€˜[d]wellingâ€™ means its definition found in Â§ 16-11-10 and also means the living quarters of a building which is used or normally used for sleeping, living, or lodging by a person.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-310(2) (2003).Â  With respect to burglary, section 16-11-10 of the South Carolina Code (2003) provides that a dwelling house also includes â€œall houses, outhouses, buildings, sheds and erections which are within two hundred yards of [the dwelling house].â€Â  State v. Smalls, 336 S.C. 301, 306-07, 519 S.E.2d 793, 795 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n            â€œAn indictment is sufficient if the offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, the defendant to know what he is called upon to answer, and if an acquittal or a conviction thereon may be pleaded as a bar to any subsequent prosecution.â€Â  State v. Owens, 293 S.C. 161, 165, 359 S.E.2d 275, 277Â  (1987). Â â€œThe true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.â€Â  Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995).Â  â€œAn indictment phrased substantially in the language of the statute which creates and defines the offense is ordinarily sufficient.â€Â  State v. Shoemaker, 276 S.C. 86, 88, 275 S.E.2d 878, 878 (1981).Â  \r\n            The indictment in this case expressly referenced section 16-11-311 of the South Carolina Code (2003) and specifically alleged that Lussardi entered Mabryâ€™s â€œdwellingâ€ without his consent and with the intent to commit a crime therein, and that he had two prior burglary convictions.Â  We therefore find the indictment for first degree burglary was sufficient.\r\n            II.Â  Prior Convictions\r\n            Lussardi argues the trial court erred by allowing the State to introduce Lussardiâ€™s two prior burglary convictions because they were more prejudicial than probative.Â  We disagree.\r\n            A person is guilty of first degree burglary â€œif the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling, and . . . (2) the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A) (2003).Â  â€œTo deter repeat offenders, the General Assembly chose to include two or more prior burglary and/or housebreaking convictions as an element of first degree burglary.â€Â  State v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 154, 526 S.E.2d 228, 230 (2000).Â  In State v. Benton, our Supreme Court ruled that section 16-11-311(A)(2) does not violate due process because it is reasonably designed to accomplish its purpose.Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, a â€œdefendant cannot require the State to stipulate to the prior conviction in lieu of informing the jury about the prior convictions.â€Â  Id. at 155, 526 S.E.2d at 230.Â  Addionally, â€œdue process does not bar the admission of prior crimes simply because there is an accompanying prejudicial effect.â€Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n            In State v. James, 355 S.C. 25, 32, 583 S.E.2d 745, 748 (2003), the Supreme Court reaffirmed the steps it provided in Benton to avoid an improper conviction:\r\n\r\n            To ensure a defendant is not convicted on an improper basis while allowing the State to prove the elements of first degree burglary, the trial court should limit evidence to the prior burglary and/or housebreaking convictions . . . .Â  Particular information regarding the prior crimes should not be admitted.Â  Addionally, the trial court . . . should, on request, instruct the jury on the limited purpose for which the prior crime evidence can be considered.\r\n\r\n            Benton, 338 S.C. at 156, 526 S.E.2d 230.\r\n            Here, the State only offered evidence of Lussardiâ€™s two prior convictions that were required to establish the statutory element of first degree burglary.Â  Also, the court limited the admissible evidence to the existence of Lussardiâ€™s prior convictions and did not allow any evidence regarding the particular circumstances of those convictions to avoid undue prejudice.Â  Furthermore, the trial judge provided a limiting charge to the jury.Â  Therefore, the probative value of admitting Lussardiâ€™s prior burglary convictions was not outweighed by their prejudicial effect.Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\n            III.Â  Continuous Course of Conduct\r\n            Lussardi argues the trial court erred by sentencing Lussardi to life imprisonment without parole because his two prior burglaries were committed in a continuous course of conduct.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n            At trial, Lussardi claimed a life sentence was â€œcruel and unusual punishment considering the fact[s] and the number of years that elapsed between the prior convictions.â€Â  However, Lussardi never raised the â€œcontinuous course of conductâ€ issue to the trial judge.Â  â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733.Â  Therefore, because the â€œcontinuous course of conductâ€ issue was not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge, that issue is not preserved for our review.\r\n            AFFRIMED.\r\n            GOOLSBY, BEATTY, and SHORT, J.J., concur. \r\n        \r\n        [1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n        [2] Mabry testified that the garage is located on his property, 126 feet from his home, and is used by the family every day.\r\n        [3] On appeal, Lussardi contends the indictment should have stated that the garage was a building within two hundred yards of Mabryâ€™s dwelling house.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-530","title":"Moseley v.

Goode, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-530\r\nSubmitted September 1, 2005 â€“ Filed September 16, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWilliam E. Booth, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nBlaney A. Coskrey, III, of Columbia; and Ralph S. Kennedy, Jr., of Batesburg-Leesville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this conversion action, Mary Lou Moseley appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s order granting Jim Oswaldâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFacts\r\nMoseley filed this conversion action alleging that Oswald wrongfully converted personal property belonging to her.Â  Moseleyâ€™s theory as set forth in her complaint is that the person who purchased the real property thereby converted any personal property she may have had that was located there.Â  The complaint avers:\r\n\r\n[T]he Defendant recently has taken title to a parcel of real estate known as the intersection of U.S. Highway #1 and State Highway 23.Â  The property in question previously belonged to Plaintiffâ€™s son.Â  Plaintiffâ€™s property at all times has been lawfully stored on the property and Plaintiff has only recently come to learn that the property in question belongs to the Defendant.\r\n\r\nIn his answer, Oswald denied Moseleyâ€™s allegations.Â  Before filing the answer, Oswald filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that a necessary party, Oswald Wholesale Lumber, Inc. (Oswald Wholesale), should have been named as a defendant because Oswald Wholesale was the purchaser of the real property, as opposed to Oswald individually.Â  The court denied the motion.Â  More than four years after the case was filed, Moseley filed a motion to amend her complaint to add Oswald Wholesale as a party.Â  The motion was denied.Â  Thereafter, Oswald filed a motion for summary judgment, which the circuit judge granted.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nSummary judgment is proper when it is clear there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Bowen v. Lee Process Systems Co., 342 S.C. 232, 536 S.E.2d 86 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Summary judgment should be granted when plain, palpable, and undisputable facts exists upon which reasonable minds cannot differ.Â  Id.Â  To determine whether an issue of fact exists, the court must view the evidence and all its inferences in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Id.\r\nOnce the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Peterson v. West American Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 518 S.E.2d 608 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nDiscussion\r\nMoseley argues the circuit court erred in granting Oswaldâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nConversion is the illegal use, misuse, or detention of anotherâ€™s chattel to the exclusion of the ownerâ€™s rights.Â  Hite v. Thomas &amp; Howard Co., 305 S.C. 358, 409 S.E.2d 340 (1991).Â  Conversion is defined as the unauthorized assumption and exercise of rights of ownership over goods or personal chattels belonging to another, to alteration of their condition or to exclusion of rights of the owner.Â  Mullis v. Trident Emergency Physicians, 351 S.C. 503, 570 S.E.2d 549 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nMoseley submitted an affidavit in opposition to the summary judgment motion.Â  In her affidavit, Moseley declared: â€œJim Oswald personally has exercised control and apparent ownership of the automobiles on several occasions.â€Â  Moseley provides no admissible facts to support this conclusory statement.Â  The court must consider facts, not conclusory statements in affidavits.Â  Ultimate or conclusory facts and conclusions of law, as well as statements made on information and belief, cannot be utilized on a summary judgment motion.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003); see also Shupe v. Settle, 315 S.C. 510, 445 S.E.2d 651 (Ct. App. 1994) (finding conclusory statement in affidavit insufficient to resist summary judgment).\r\nFurther, Moseley states: â€œI dealt with Mr. Oswald and had my son Dennis talk to Mr. Oswald about getting the cars and other property off of the property. . . . My son Dennis also talked to Mr. Oswald about getting the automobiles.â€Â  There is no indication of what Dennis said, what Oswald said in response, or how that conversation supports a claim of conversion against Oswald individually.Â  Moreover, that conversation, as described by Moseley, is hearsay.\r\nMoseleyâ€™s allegation that Oswald purchased real property, thereby converting her personal property, is without support.Â  There is no genuine issue as to any material fact for trial.Â  Thus, the judge did not err in granting summary judgment to Oswald.\r\nAccordingly, the order of the circuit judge granting summary judgment to Oswald is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, HUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-531","title":"Nicholson v.

Watson, Master-In-Equity\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-531\r\nHeard September 14, 2005 â€“ Filed September 20, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJoseph Todd Manley, of Moncks Corner; for Appellant.\r\nGeorge B. Bishop, of Moncks Corner; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Eula Nicholson (Nicholson) initiated this action to quiet title to property she claimed she purchased from the appellant, Betty Gresham (Gresham).Â  We affirm the Master-In-Equityâ€™s ruling that Nicholson is the owner of the disputed property.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nNicholson and Gresham met in the early 1990s, and became close friends up until the events giving rise to this case.Â  Gresham owned an acre of property which included a boat landing, a bait and tackle shop, several mobile home trailers, and Greshamâ€™s residence.Â  Around March of 1999, Nicholson and Gresham entered into an agreement whereby Nicholson occupied and had exclusive use of a portion of the disputed property.Â  Because the parties were close friends, they did not involve an attorney in the transaction.Â  Nicholson paid Gresham $10,000 in March 1999, and paid an additional $40,000 in monthly installments over the course of the next four years.Â  Nicholson claims this transaction was a sale; Gresham, however, contends the arrangement was a four-year leaseâ€”not a sale.Â  Nicholson presented a document, signed by both her and Gresham, which simply states:\r\n\r\nThis is to verify that I Eula M, [sic] Nicholson will pay the amount of 10,000 as a down payment with the balance of 40,000 to be paid in full at the end 4 yr.\r\n\r\nTwo surveys were performed to divide the property.Â  The first survey was conducted in 1999.Â  Nicholson testified that after the first survey, the surveyor prepared a deed which was signed by both parties and notarized.Â  Gresham denies signing this deed.Â  However, the deed was recorded in January 2003.Â  Additionally, Nicholson entered into evidence a writing which accounted for the payments she made to Gresham.Â  Gresham admitted that every month when Nicholson would make her $1,200 payment, Gresham would initial on this document, indicating the payment had been received.Â  \r\nThe portion of the property that Nicholson possessed included two mobile home trailers.Â  Nicholson testified that these trailers were in poor condition and that she renovated the trailers so she could rent them.Â  Furthermore, she brought two additional trailers onto the property.Â  In all, three trailers were designated for rent, and the fourth Nicholson kept for herself, although it was not her primary residence.Â  Witnesses gave varying opinions on how much rental income could be derived from the property with estimates ranging from $275 to $400 per trailer per month.Â  \r\nIn August of 2002, after Nicholson had paid the $50,000, Gresham had a second survey performed.Â  Gresham had a fence, which transected the property, moved approximately five feet to enlarge her portion of the land.Â  Subsequently, Gresham moved the fence a second time, this time taking a substantial portion of the space that Nicholson occupied.Â  Eventually, Nicholson filed suit to quiet title.Â  \r\nThe master found the recorded deed was void due to form because the consideration stated on the deed was incorrect and it was doubtful that the parties signed the deed simultaneously or in each otherâ€™s presence.Â  The master nonetheless found that Gresham had sold the property to Nicholson.Â  He ruled that the Statute of Frauds was not applicable because of full or part performance and because Nicholson made improvements to the property.Â  Therefore, he granted Nicholson exclusive quiet possession and title to the portion of the property she claimed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis case presents issues of both law and equity.Â  Where legal and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal or equitable for purposes of the applicable standard of review.Â \r\nKuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs.Â¸ 342 S.C. 579, 538 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In an action at law, this Court will not disturb the findings of fact unless they are wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  Kemp v. Rawlings, 358 S.C. 28, 594 S.E.2d 845 (2004).Â  However, where questions of equity are involved, we may take our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Williams v. Wilson, 349 S.C. 336, 563 S.E.2d 320 (2002).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGresham contends that Nicholsonâ€™s action must fail because it is barred by the Statute of Frauds, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10(4) (1991).Â  We disagree.\r\nThe first question is whether a parol contract to sell the property existed between Gresham and Nicholson.Â  See Aust v. Beard, 230 S.C. 515, 96 S.E.2d 558 (1957).Â  The master found â€œby clear and convincing evidence, the Defendantâ€™s intentions and desire was to sell a portion of her propertyâ€ to Nicholson.Â  Although Gresham forcefully denies that she sold the property, there is ample evidence to support the masterâ€™s finding.Â  For instance, Sandra Gresham, who is of no relation to the appellant, testified that appellant Gresham previously had tried to sell her the property for $50,000.Â  The master found Sandraâ€™s testimony credible and found â€œno reason to believe that she was biased or prejudicial for one side or the other.â€Â  Furthermore, Nicholson provided a payment schedule which accounts for all of the monthly $1,200 payments she made to Gresham.Â  Gresham initialed by each payment.Â  Nicholson, who paid Gresham in cash, by check, or by combination of the two, entered into evidence one check which read â€œMortgageâ€ in the memo line.Â  After reviewing all of the evidence, we defer to the masterâ€™s conclusion that the parties intended the arrangement to be the sale of property and not a lease.Â  \r\nNext, because this case is an action to charge Gresham on a contract for the sale of land, it must either meet the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10, or else fall under an exception to the Statute of Frauds.Â  Section 32-3-10 provides that \r\n\r\nNo action shall be brought whereby:\r\n. . . .\r\n(4)Â  To charge any person upon any contract or sale of lands. . .\r\nUnless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought or some memorandum or note thereof shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith or some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10 (1991).Â  Gresham correctly states the general proposition that the Statute of Frauds requires a written memorandum, signed by the party to be charged, which contains all the essential elements of the contract for the sale of land. Â See McCathern v. Oâ€™Donnell &amp; Co., 181 S.C. 76, 186 S.E. 659 (1936).Â  However, exceptions to the Statute of Frauds exist.Â  â€œAn oral contract within the Statute of Frauds may be taken out by performance where one party does some act essential to performance of the agreement resulting in loss to himself and benefit to the other.â€Â  Graham v. Prince, 293 S.C. 77, 81, 358 S.E.2d 714, 717 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Where the parties fully perform the contract, the Statute of Frauds no longer applies.Â  See DeWitt v. Kelly, 256 S.C. 224, 182 S.E.2d 65 (1971).Â  Further, the Statute may not apply where there has been partial performance.Â \r\nSettlemeyer v. McCluney, 359 S.C. 317, 596 S.E.2d 514 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Factors such as possession of the land, payments made, and improvements undertaken are considered in determining the sufficiency of partial performance.Â  Stackhouse v. Cook, 271 S.C. 518, 248 S.E.2d 482 (1978).Â  \r\nThe master found there had been full or partial performance and that Nicholson had made substantial improvements to the property.Â  Because we adopt the masterâ€™s conclusion that the parties entered into a contract for the sale of the land, we find the contract was fully performed.Â  Gresham conceded that she received the $50,000.Â  Therefore, we affirm the masterâ€™s finding that the sale was taken out of the Statute of Frauds by full or partial performance.Â  Further, we hold the master properly ordered the issuance of a master deed to specifically enforce the partiesâ€™ contract.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n ANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-532","title":"State v.

Howard and the Estate of Leland Finklea appeal the grant of summary judgment to Derrell Lawayne Cox on their claims for rescission and unjust enrichment.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn 2000, Leland Finklea and his daughter, Georgia Howard, contracted to sell two parcels of unimproved farmland in Florence County to Derrell Cox for $100,000.Â  Finklea and Howard later agreed to lower the price to $90,000 when Coxâ€™s contingency financing was jeopardized by a lower appraisal. The sale took place on September 11, 2000.Â  \r\nFinklea died on June 8, 2001.Â  In May 2002, Cox secured an administrative transfer of tobacco allotments assigned to the two parcels.Â  Howard learned of the transfer in August or September 2002.Â  Howard and her husband attempted to buy the allotments back from Cox; however, Cox did not agree to the sale. \r\nHoward and the Estate of Leland Finklea (hereafter collectively referred to as â€œHowardâ€) filed this action against Cox alleging the following causes of action:Â  (1) breach of contract; (2) specific performance; and (3) unjust enrichment.Â  Howard later amended her action to include an additional claim for rescission based on a mistake â€œas to the facts and terms upon which the contract was based.â€Â  Cox moved for summary judgment, arguing the statute of frauds barred any contractual claim against him and asserting no genuine issue of material fact was in dispute.Â  At a hearing on Coxâ€™s motion for summary judgment, Howard abandoned the breach of contract cause of action and proceeded solely on the theories of unjust enrichment and rescission. Â \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment to Cox on Howardâ€™s equitable causes of action.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHoward argues the trial court placed undue emphasis on the established principle that tobacco allotments run with the land.[1] Â She further challenges the trial courtâ€™s holding that she was â€œnot entitled to judicial relief on the grounds of mistake from the terms of a poorly prepared agreement of [her] own making,â€ contending the rule that tobacco allotments run with the land does not preclude her from recovering on the equitable theories of mistake of fact or unjust enrichment.Â  We reject these arguments.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  As to mistake of fact, whether unilateral or mutual, recovery requires a showing that the mistake was not due to the complainantâ€™s negligence.[2]Â  Here, Howard conceded in her brief that either party could have discovered that the allotments were assigned to the tracts in question.Â  If Howard or Finklea had made appropriate inquiries before agreeing to sell the property, the mistake that led to Coxâ€™s acquisition of the tobacco allotments could have been avoided.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  As to Howardâ€™s action for unjust enrichment, the trial court concluded that even if Howard and Finklea were totally unaware of the principle that agricultural allotments run with the land, Cox was under no legal or ethical duty to educate or inform them of this principle.Â  As an additional basis for dismissing this cause of action, the trial court held that Cox had paid a reasonable amount for the property including the allotments.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find no reversible error concerning the trial courtâ€™s second determination.Â  In this case, Howard needed to show not only that Cox received a benefit at her expense but also that it would have been unconscionable for him to retain it.[3]Â  Logically, such a showing in the present case would include substantive evidence about the value of the allotments.[4]Â  Here, Howard presented no evidence suggesting that the price she received for the property was unconscionably low in view of the fact that the tobacco allotments transferred with it.Â  Without such evidence, we cannot fault the trial court for refusing to allow Howard to proceed on her action for unjust enrichment.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  See Lee v.
