Toal, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n          Vernon Lee McCullough, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  PER CURIAM: Tressy Chick McCullough (Mother) appeals the family courtâ€™s order denying her request for Vernon Lee McCullough (Father) to pay retroactive child support.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\n  FACTS\r\n  Father and Mother married on August 9, 1993, and had one child together in July 1998.Â  Mother and Father separated in January 1998. \r\n  On October 24, 2002, Father, who was incarcerated, filed for divorce on the statutory ground of living separate and apart for one year.Â  He also requested the trial court reserve the right to award child support until after he was released from prison.Â  In her answer and counterclaim, Mother admitted separation without cohabitation for more than one year and requested a divorce, child support, back child support, custody, and a bar to alimony.Â  \r\n  During the trial, Mother presented a financial declaration that she subsequently modified on the record. Â She testified that she earned approximately $1,450 per month, a forty percent decrease from the $2,416 gross monthly income stated on her financial declaration.Â  She explained her income was reduced when she was placed on short-term disability for injuries sustained in an automobile accident.Â  Fatherâ€™s financial declaration showed his average monthly salary to be $1,982.Â  However, Father testified at trial that he had â€œaverage[d] about â€“ about [$]4,000 a monthâ€ since April 2003.Â  Father also admitted that he had not paid any child support in the past.Â Â Â  \r\n  In its order dated January 7, 2004, the family court:Â  (1) granted the parties a divorce based on the ground of living separate and apart for a period of one year; (2) awarded Mother custody of the partiesâ€™ minor child; (3) ordered Father to pay child support in the amount of $575 per month; (4) ordered Father to pay retroactive child support dating from April 15, 2003, in the amount of $4,000; (5) equitably divided the marital estate; (6) denied alimony to either party; and (7) permitted Mother to resume her maiden name. \r\n  Subsequently, Father filed a motion for reconsideration in which he claimed the family court erred:Â  (1) in determining child support because he was not released from prison until May 2003; (2) assessing the number of dependents claimed by Mother; and (3) calculating Fatherâ€™s gross monthly income.Â  Following a hearing on the motion, the court affirmed its order with the exception of the award of retroactive child support.Â  Without explanation, the court ordered retroactive child support to be stricken from the original order.Â  Mother appeals the family courtâ€™s decision with respect to retroactive child support.\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  â€œOn appeal from an order of the family court, this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Hopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 304, 540 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2000).Â  However, this does not mean that this court should disregard the findings of the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses.Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 (1999).\r\n  DISCUSSION\r\n  Mother claims the trial court erred in striking the award of retroactive child support.[2]Â  We agree.Â  \r\n  We preface our discussion of this issue by noting that Father failed to file a brief.Â  Based on this fact alone, we would be justified in reversing the family courtâ€™s order.Â  See Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR (â€œUpon the failure of respondent to timely file a brief, the appellate court may take such action as it deems proper.â€); Wierszewski v. Tokarick, 308 S.C. 441, 444 n.2, 418 S.E.2d 557, 559 n.2 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding that where respondent failed to file a brief appellate court deemed it proper â€œto reverse on the points presented rather than to search the record for reasons to affirmâ€); see also Smith v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 284 S.C. 469, 471, 327 S.E.2d 348, 349 (1985)(holding, under prior appellate court rules, the supreme court would not â€œgrope in the darkâ€ in order to identify errors).Â  Despite Fatherâ€™s failure to adhere to the appellate court rules, we deem it proper to address the merits of Motherâ€™s appeal.\r\n  Both parents have an obligation to support their children.Â  Wint v. Wint, 310 S.C. 48, 50, 425 S.E.2d 48, 49 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  The entitlement to retroactive child support depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.Â  Sutton v. Sutton, 291 S.C. 401, 408, 353 S.E.2d 884, 888 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  â€œThe issue of retroactive support is to be resolved in accordance with the evidence presented.â€Â  Major v. Major, 277 S.C. 318, 321, 286 S.E.2d 666, 668 (1982).Â  \r\n  The decision to award retroactive child support rests in the sound discretion of the family court.Â  Kelly v. Kelly, 310 S.C. 299, 302, 423 S.E.2d 153, 155 (Ct. App. 1992); see Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 197, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988) (stating â€œ[t]he question of the award of child support is largely within the discretion of the trial judge whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shownâ€).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon the findings of fact, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 485, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n  Section 20-7-852(A) of the South Carolina Code establishes a â€œpresumption that the amount of the award which would result from the application of the guidelines . . . is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-852(A) (Supp. 2004).Â  However, â€œ[a] different amount may be awarded upon a showing that application of the guidelines in a particular case would be unjust or inappropriate.â€Â  Id.\r\n  Under the specific facts of this case, we find the family court erred in eliminating Fatherâ€™s obligation to pay Mother retroactive child support.Â  Initially, we note the court failed to give an explanation for striking Motherâ€™s award of retroactive alimony.Â  In view of the absence of factual findings, we can discern no reason for this complete reversal of the award.Â  Although Father moved for the court to reconsider the amount of the retroactive child support and the amount of the monthly child support, he never challenged Motherâ€™s entitlement to an award of retroactive child support.Â  In fact, Motherâ€™s counsel, not Father, drew the courtâ€™s attention to Fatherâ€™s issue regarding the amount of the award of retroactive child support.Â  Furthermore, at the initial hearing Mother specifically requested retroactive child support.Â  Father also testified that he began working in April 2003 and had not paid any child support.\r\n  Because there is no evidence to support the family courtâ€™s decision to strike the award of retroactive child support, we find the ruling constituted an abuse of discretion.Â  Accordingly, we remand for the court to reconsider this issue and provide specific findings of fact.Â  On remand, if retroactive child support is warranted, the court should recalculate the amount based on Fatherâ€™s actual monthly income and payment for health insurance, Motherâ€™s monthly income, and the correct number of dependents in accordance with the child support guidelines.[3]Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is\r\n  REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n  HEARN, C.J., BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [2]Â Â  Because both issues raised by Mother concern the award of retroactive child support, we have consolidated them in the interest of brevity and clarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [3]Â  Based on our review of the record, it appears the $4,000 award of retroactive child support was calculated using an amount of monthly child support that significantly deviated from the child support guidelines.Â  Specifically, the partiesâ€™ only mutual child should have been considered for the award of support.Â  Additionally, the record indicates that Fatherâ€™s monthly salary is substantially less than the $4,000 amount apparently relied upon by the family court.Â  In light of these discrepancies, the family court may wish to reconsider the amount of monthly child support as well as the amount of retroactive child support.Â  If the court determines that the support award should deviate from the guidelines, it should make specific findings of fact outlining the basis for the award.Â  See Engle v. Engle, 343 S.C. 444, 452, 539 S.E.2d 712, 716 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œDeviation from the Guidelines should be the exception rather than the rule.Â  When the court orders a child support award that varies significantly from the amount resulting from the application of the Guidelines, the court shall make specific, written findings of those facts upon which it bases its conclusion supporting the award.â€) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-368","title":"Smith v.

Nichols, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Cynthia Barrier Castengera, of Newland, NC, and Sheila McNair Robinson, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is a domestic action for modification of alimony consolidated with an appeal from the divorce decree.Â  Kathryn Dale Nelson (Wife) appealed the divorce decree ordering David H. Nelson (Husband) to pay her alimony in the amount of $500 per month.Â  Her appeal was held in abeyance while Husband sought a reduction in alimony based on changed circumstances.Â  The family court found a substantial change in circumstances and reduced the amount of alimony from $500 per month to $250 per month.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married in 1980.Â  At the time of the divorce, Husband was 56 years of age and Wife was 54.Â  Although Wife is a seven-year cancer survivor and Husband suffers high blood pressure, both parties are in reasonably good health.Â  Each party received a high school diploma.Â  The partiesâ€™ three children have reached the age of majority.Â  Wife did not work outside the home during the marriage except for a short period in the fall of 2000.Â  However, she contributed to the marriage by performing household services such as cleaning, cooking, and caring for the children.Â  \r\nHusband worked for BellSouth as a telephone specialist for over 30 years.Â  After the parties separated, Wife took a job as an office clerk with the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED).Â  The coupleâ€™s standard of living during the marriage was impacted by excessive consumer debt.Â  At the time of the divorce hearing, they owed nearly $37,000â€”more than the equity in the marital home.Â  \r\nHusband earned a gross monthly income of $4,741.66 and a net monthly income of $3,072.42.Â  Wife earned a gross monthly income of $1,484.90 and a net monthly income of $1,053.70.Â  Neither party anticipated an increase in income.Â  \r\nIn August of 2000, the family court issued a temporary order setting alimony at $500 per month.Â  Husband was ordered to contribute $750 toward Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  By order filed May 17, 2001, the family court increased the alimony to $1,000 per month, as the marital home was sold and Husband was no longer required to make the mortgage payments.Â  \r\nIn the final order of divorce, the family court found both parties claimed expenses in excess of their income.Â  The court found Husbandâ€™s financial declaration truthful and honest.Â  The court found Wife inflated her expenses.Â  From a net monthly income of $1,053.70, she claimed expenses totaling $3,318.48, including $266 per month for dental work she had not yet incurred, $300 per month for clothing, $300 per month for incidentals, and $275 per month for entertainment.Â  \r\nHusband had no non-marital assets.Â  The Wife had a one-third interest in two parcels of family real estate in Florence:Â  a home listed for sale for $85,900 at the time of the hearing, and a 120-acre farm, both of which were non-marital assets.Â  The assets divided in equitable distribution consisted primarily of the proceeds from the sale of the marital home and Husbandâ€™s retirement account.Â  The court allocated 60% of the estate to Husband because he had been the sole financial contributor to the marriage.Â  Each party retained a vehicle.Â  The court awarded Wife alimony as follows:Â  $150 per month beginning December 1, 2001, $200 per month beginning December 1, 2002, and $250 per month beginning December 1, 2003.Â  \r\nWife filed a motion for reconsideration.Â  The family court refused her request for $1,000 per month but increased the alimony to $500 per month.Â  Wife appealed this order.Â  With the permission of this court, the appeal was held in abeyance pending Husbandâ€™s retirement.Â  Husband then filed an action for modification of alimony.Â  Wife answered and counterclaimed for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing, the family court found Husband had experienced a substantial and material change in circumstances.Â  Husband took voluntary retirement from BellSouth with a lump sum payment of one and a half times his annual salary.Â  The entire sum was paid to Wife to satisfy the equitable distribution ordered in the divorce decree.Â  \r\nHusbandâ€™s gross monthly income fell to $1,496.36 and his net monthly income to $1,014.65.Â  Additionally, Husbandâ€™s property, excluding retirement, decreased from $42,846.87 to $4,772.67.Â  Husband was also required to pay for his insurance coverage and was experiencing new medical problems, including diabetes.Â  \r\nIn contrast, the family court found Wifeâ€™s financial situation had improved.Â  She had been promoted to a full-time position at SLED and had received an increase in pay.Â  Her gross monthly income increased to $1,607 and her net monthly income to $1,243, excluding the alimony.Â  Additionally, her monthly expenses decreased almost $2,000, from $3,318.48 to $1,352.Â  She had purchased a new house in a residential community with a fenced-in yard and a security system.Â  Moreover, Wifeâ€™s assets had increased, including $43,000 in a savings account.Â  She retained her one-third interest in the 120-acre farm in Florence and the house, which was then listed for sale for $59,500.Â  She also had an undisclosed sum in her SLED retirement account.Â  \r\nThe family court found that Husband met his burden of showing a substantial and material change of circumstances and ordered the alimony reduced to $250 per month.Â  Wife also appeals this order. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from the family court, this court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 335, 569 S.E.2d 393, 397 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court, however.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  â€œNeither are we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Roberson v. Roberson, 359 S.C. 384, 388, 597 S.E.2d 840, 842 (Ct. App. 2004) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA.Â  Alimony\r\nWife argues error in the divorce decree setting alimony at $500, down from the $1,000 set in the temporary order.Â  Wife also appeals the modification order, setting alimony at $250 based on Husbandâ€™s retirement.Â  We find no error.\r\nThe amount of alimony varied throughout the course of the litigation.Â  The family court temporarily ordered alimony of $500 per month and increased it to $1,000 per month after the marital home was sold.Â  After the hearing, the family court modified it to $150 per month beginning on December 1, 2001, $200 per month beginning on December 1, 2002, and $250 per month beginning on December 1, 2003.Â  However, in the order on Wifeâ€™s motion to alter or amend, the family court increased alimony to $500 per month.Â  Following Husbandâ€™s action for modification, the family court reduced it to $250 per month.Â  \r\n1.Â  The Divorce Decree\r\nWife first argues that the family court erred in setting the alimony amount at $500 per month following the divorce, a reduction from $1,000 per month in the temporary order.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 183-84, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the judge is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Roberson, 359 S.C. at 390, 597 S.E.2d at 843. \r\nâ€œAlimony is a substitute for the support that is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€Â  McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 599, 506 S.E.2d 1, 9 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œThe purpose of alimony is to place the supported spouse in the position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.â€Â  Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 63, 606 S.E.2d 489, 498 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, alimony should not serve as a disincentive for a spouse to improve his employment potential or to dissuade him from providing for his own support.Â  Id. \r\nA court must consider the following factors in making an alimony award:Â  (1) the duration of the marriage; (2) the physical and emotional health of the parties; (3) the educational background of the parties; (4) the employment history and earning potential of both parties; (5) their standard of living during the marriage; (6) their current and reasonably anticipated earnings; (7) their current and reasonably anticipated expenses; (8) the marital and non-marital properties of the parties; (9) custody of the children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations of either party; and (13) other factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2004). \r\nThe family court carefully considered each of the statutory factors in the amended divorce decree and then reconsidered the amount of alimony in the final order.Â  In particular, the family court found Husband lacked the ability to pay $1,000 per month based on his financial declarations.Â  The family court observed that a large alimony amount would unduly penalize Husband.Â  See Beasley v. Beasley, 264 S.C. 611, 612, 216 S.E.2d 535, 535-36 (1975) (stating that alimony should not penalize one party and reward the other).Â  \r\nMoreover, the family court questioned the veracity of the Wifeâ€™s expenses in her financial declaration.Â  The court found her expenditures of $300 per month for clothing, $300 per month for incidentals, and $275 per month for entertainment to be excessive.Â  Additionally, the family court found her reported estimate of future monthly expenditures of $266 per month for dental work speculative.Â  The court further observed that Wifeâ€™s financial declaration failed to include her one-third interest in the Florence family properties.Â  The family court found the properties were capable of generating additional income for Wife.Â  \r\nWe find no error in the family courtâ€™s decision.Â  The family court judge was in a better position to evaluate the credibility and assign comparative weight to the testimony of the witnesses.Â  There was ample support for the award of $500 per month.\r\n2.Â  Husbandâ€™s Modification Action\r\nWife next challenges the reduction of the alimony to $250 per month in Husbandâ€™s action for modification based on changed circumstances.Â  Wife contends Husbandâ€™s retirement should not be considered a change of circumstances because it was within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the divorce decree.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œChanged conditions may warrant a modification or termination of alimony.â€Â  Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 516, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œTo justify modification, the changes in circumstances must be substantial or material.â€Â  Pendergast v. Pendergast, 354 S.C. 32, 38, 579 S.E.2d 530, 533 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Voluntary changes in employment that impact a spouseâ€™s ability to pay alimony will be closely scrutinized, and the family court may impute income in such situations.Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 488, 477 S.E.2d 727, 731 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nGenerally, changes within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the divorce decree do not provide grounds for modification of alimony.Â  Calvert v. Calvert, 287 S.C. 130, 139, 336 S.E.2d 884, 889 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  However, events that are anticipated but considered distant at the time the decree is entered may qualify as changed circumstances permitting modification in alimony.Â  Sharps v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 77, 535 S.E.2d 913, 916 (2000).Â  In Sharps, the court explained as follows:Â  â€œAs a general rule, a court hearing an application for a change in alimony should look not only to see if the substantial change was contemplated by the parties, but most importantly whether the amount of alimony in the original decree reflects the expectation of that future occurrence.â€Â  Id. at 78, 535 S.E.2d at 917.Â  \r\nThe family court noted in the divorce decree that Husband was â€œapproaching retirement age.â€Â  However, Husband testified at the hearing that he planned to work at least six more years before retiring.Â  Although Husbandâ€™s retirement was voluntary, Husband retired because his employer announced an anticipated layoff of 4,000 to 5,000 managers and offered early retirement packages.Â  Husband testified that the retirement package, a lump sum payment of one and a half times his annual salary, was the best he had seen while employed at BellSouth.Â  \r\nMoreover, the change in financial condition of the parties was significant.Â  As a result of retirement, Husbandâ€™s monthly income was significantly reduced.Â  Meanwhile, Wifeâ€™s financial condition had substantially improved.Â  Her monthly income increased and her expenses decreased.Â  We find no error in the family courtâ€™s finding of changed circumstances.\r\nB.Â  Equitable Distribution\r\nWife next contends the family court should have ordered an equal division of the marital estate.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) sets forth the equitable apportionment factors a court must consider and vests the family court with discretion to weigh the evidence bearing on each factor.Â  â€œOn review, this Court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment.Â  If the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that this Court might have weighed specific factors differently than the trial judge.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988) (internal citation omitted).Â  \r\nWife did not work outside the home at all during the marriage, except for a two or three-month period when she had a part-time job.Â  In similar cases, the appellate courts of this state have upheld a similar split.Â  In Pool v. Pool, the wife made approximately twenty percent of the financial contributions to the marriage in addition to her contributions as a homemaker.Â  321 S.C. 84, 87, 467 S.E.2d 753, 755 (Ct. App. 1996), modified on other grounds, 329 S.C. 324, 494 S.E.2d 820 (1998).Â  The court found no abuse of discretion in a 60/40 split.Â  Id. at 88, 467 S.E.2d at 756.Â  See also Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 24, 553 S.E.2d 251, 255 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding a 65/35 property split fair and equitable); Brandi v. Brandi, 302 S.C. 353, 358, 396 S.E.2d 124, 127 (Ct. App. 1990) (upholding a 70/30 property split).Â  \r\nThe family court in this case recited that it considered all of the statutory factors regarding equitable apportionment found in section 20-7-472.Â  Although Wife made significant indirect contributions to the marriage, Husband was the sole financial contributor.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nC.Â  Factual Finding Regarding Wifeâ€™s Inherited Property\r\nWife next contends the family court erred in finding her interest in the Florence properties afforded her â€œa sufficient financial resource from which she is able to generate additional funds.â€Â  We disagree. \r\nSouth Carolina law requires a court to consider, inter alia, the opportunity of each spouse for future acquisition of capital assets, and the non-marital property of each spouse.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(4) &amp; (7) (Supp. 2004).Â  When determining the amount of alimony, a court must consider marital and non-marital properties of the parties, and any other factors the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C)(8) &amp; (13) (Supp. 2004). \r\nWife first points out that although the house was listed for $85,900 at the time of the hearing, the price was subsequently reduced to $59,500 and no offers had been received due to extensive termite damage.Â  Despite the need for repairs to one of the properties, the potential for Wife to generate income or funds from both properties continues to exist.Â  We find no error.\r\nD.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife finally argues the family court erred in requiring the parties to pay their own attorney fees.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees is within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â See Bowen v. Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d 271, 272 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial results obtained, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on the partiesâ€™ standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  \r\nThe family court found that both parties had achieved beneficial results and neither party was at fault in the breakup of the marriage.Â  We find no error.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-370","title":"Marshall v.

Grady Query, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Â  This is an appeal from a trial courtâ€™s grant of a preliminary injunction.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\n Joseph and Annie Hickman own 32A Centre Street in Folly Beach, South Carolina.Â  From 1997 until 2003, the Hickmans leased the property to Ken (â€œMarshallâ€) and Mary Marshall through the Marshallsâ€™ corporation, Springerland, Inc., for use as a restaurant and bar named Planet Follywood.Â  Upon the Marshallâ€™s petition for divorce, the family court issued a temporary order, awarding Mary Marshall sole control over the operations of Planet Follywood.\r\nIn October 2003, John Pence, a Planet Follywood patron, and Marshall discussed the potential of forming a partnership or association to run Planet Follywood.Â  Pence introduced Marshall to Rick Neighbors as a potential third partner because Neighbors â€œhad started, managed and sold a number of successful businesses.â€Â  Marshallâ€™s primary concern was having a name other than his listed as the owner of the business because he had unpaid tax liens owed to the IRS.Â  However, the discussions ended because Marshall did not want Neighbors as a partner.Â  After Marshall approached Pence a second time in November 2003 about forming a business relationship, Pence suggested his son-in-law Jerry Massey, manager of a local restaurant franchise, as the third partner.Â  Marshall, Pence, and Massey met at Penceâ€™s home later that month to discuss the organization of the business and inspect Springerlandâ€™s financial books.Â  Because of Marshallâ€™s IRS difficulties, Massey agreed to put all necessary permits and licenses in his name, including the lease on the 32A Centre Street property.Â  Massey also agreed to handle the day-to-day operations of the restaurant and bar because Marshall expressed a desire to continue his job in construction; however, Marshall wanted a portion of the monthly proceeds from the operation of the new business. \r\nAt trial, Marshall testified he simply asked Pence to help him meet the past due rental amounts so he could take over the restaurant once his divorce proceedings were final.Â  He stated he never intended to form a partnership with Pence or Massey, but he admits he discussed a business association with them at some point.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Hickmans notified Marshall in early December that Mary Marshall was behind on her rent payments.[1]Â  They began formal eviction proceedings against Springerland on December 22, 2003, though the â€œproceedings [were] never concluded and . . . therefore [eventually] deemed by [the] court to be null and void.â€ Â In addition, the IRS ordered Planet Follywood to close at the end of December 2003 because of Springerlandâ€™s unpaid tax liens.Â  Subsequently, Mary Marshall threw a going out of business and customer appreciation party on December 25, 2003.Â  \r\nOn December 16, 2003, Massey, Pence, and Marshall met with the Hickmans to discuss the new lease on the property.Â  At that meeting, Massey paid $3,200 to the Hickmans for December 2003 and January 2004 rent on the property.Â  Also during the meeting, Joseph Hickman signed a document, witnessed by Annie Hickman and Massey and in the presence of Marshall and Pence, attesting to his receipt of rent for the months of â€œDec. 03 and January 04 from the new tenants of Planet Follywood 32 Center St Folly Beach SC 29439.Â  The new lease will be prepared in ap[p]rox two weeks by atty Ben Peeples.Â  New tenants are [sic] Jerry Massey.â€Â  Massey testified that Marshall was present for the meeting, the payment of the rent, and the signing of the temporary lease agreement from the Hickmans to Massey; however, Marshall testified that he was not at the meeting.Â  Shortly thereafter, Massey formed a corporation named Planets Edge, Inc. for purpose of operating the new business.Â  Planets Edge signed a one-year lease with the Hickmanâ€™s for 32A Centre Street that contained an option to renew until December 2009. \r\nWhile Massey, Pence, their respective spouses, and occasionally Marshall prepared the restaurant for opening, Marshallâ€™s divorce became final.Â  As a result of the settlement, on January 15, 2004, Mary Marshall paid Marshall $50,000, satisfied the IRS tax lien against Springerland, and surrendered her interest in Springerland to Marshall.[2]Â  Massey testified that Marshall contacted Pence on January 17, 2004 and scheduled a meeting at the property for the following day, where he informed Massey that he did not â€œthink this partnership [was] going to workâ€ because Massey was â€œtoo corporateâ€ for a family business like Planet Follywood.Â  Marshall stated to both Massey and Pence that he would not do business with either of them in the future.Â  Unbeknownst to Pence and Massey until that day, Marshall had applied for liquor licenses and other permits on January 15 and 16, 2004 in his name and the name of his new corporation, Vol-World, LLC, thereby preventing Appellants from obtaining permits for the same address in their corporate name.\r\nTo protect their investment, Massey and Pence contacted legal counsel, and after notifying the Hickmans, changed the locks on the 32A Centre Street building.Â  Respondents[3] instituted a breach of contract action against the Hickmans.Â  Respondents also brought an action for intentional interference with contractual relations, conversion, trespass, and forcible entry and detainer against Appellants.Â  In their amended complaint, Respondents withdrew the breach of contract claim against the Hickmans and added a request for specific performance of the 1997 lease between Springerland and Hickman.Â  They also requested injunctive relief awarding them possession of 32A Centre Street and the return of any personal property belonging to Springerland left inside the premises.Â Â  \r\nFrom January 2003 until the trial court ordered the preliminary injunction on February 27, 2004, Appellants remained in possession of the 32A Centre Street premises and were current on all rent due for the premises.Â  Marshall also was current on all rent due for the premises.Â  Following the hearing on February 27, 2004, the trial court ordered Appellants to vacate the premises and â€œimmediately grant access to the said premises toâ€ Respondents, once Respondents posted a $3,200 attachment bond.Â  The trial court held the following:\r\n\r\n  [T]here was [sic] discussions to lead up to the formation of a partnership, but a partnership was never formed.Â  Secondly, as far as the competing leases are concerned, I think that the first lease is still valid and it is enforced [sic] and therefore Iâ€™ll grant the injunction, the temporary injunction, turning the property over to the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nThis appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants claim the trial court erred in awarding a preliminary injunction to Respondents because Appellants were in actual possession under â€œcolor of right.â€Â  We agree. \r\nActions for injunctive relief are equitable.Â  Doe v. South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 347 S.C. 642, 645, 557 S.E.2d 670, 672 (2001).Â  In equitable actions, we may review the record and make findings of fact in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id.Â  â€œPursuant to the â€˜main purpose rule,â€™ in actions praying for both money damages and equitable relief, â€˜characterization of the action as equitable or legal depends on the plaintiffâ€™s â€˜main purposeâ€™ in bringing the action.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Floyd v. Floyd, 306 S.C. 376, 380, 412 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1991)).Â  Marshallâ€™s main purpose in instituting this action was to restore the status quo.Â  Thus, the â€œmain purposeâ€ of Marshallâ€™s action was equitable in nature.Â  However, â€œ[t]he granting of temporary injunctive relief is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion.â€Â  City of Columbia v. Pic-A-Flick Video, Inc., 340 S.C. 278, 282, 531 S.E.2d 518, 520 (2000).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  Id. at 282, 531 S.E.2d at 521.Â  \r\nOrdinarily the purpose of a temporary injunction is merely to preserve the existing status during the litigation, and as a general rule, subject to some exceptions, it will not be allowed to have the effect of transferring the possession of property from a litigant in possession to another who claims the right to possession.Â  Atlantic Coast Lumber Corp. v. E.P. Burton Lumber Co., 89 S.C. 143, 145, 71 S.E. 820, 820 (1911).Â  â€œIn case of property rights the purpose is to preserve the status quo pending litigation.â€Â  County Council of Charleston v. Felkel, 244 S.C. 480, 484, 137 S.E.2d 577, 578 (1964).Â  If â€œthe right of possession is in dispute between two parties, one of whom is in actual possession under a claim or color of right, injunction will not, as a rule, lie to transfer possession to the other party.â€Â  43A C.J.S. Injunctions Â§ 127 (2004) (emphasis added). \r\nAppellants were in actual possession of the property prior to February 27, 2004 when the temporary injunction was issued.Â  Although there was some debate as to Marshallâ€™s intent to enter into a partnership and which of the partiesâ€™ leases was primary, there was some evidence that Appellants were in possession of 32A Centre Street by â€œcolor of right.â€Â  See 43A C.J.S. Injunctions Â§ 127 (2004).Â  Marshall requested that Pence help him financially to get the business operating again and possibly entered into an oral partnership agreement with Pence and Massey.Â  Also, Mary Marshall failed to make rent payments on the lease and the Hickmans executed eviction proceedings.Â  Further, Joseph Hickman handwrote a note to Massey, in the presence of his wife, Pence, and arguably Marshall to the effect that Massey was the â€œNew Tenantâ€ of 32A Centre Street and had paid rent for December 2003 and January 2004.Â  The Hickmans and Planet Edge entered into a lease agreement on January 16, 2004.Â  This evidence, whether disputed or not, prevents the trial court from transferring possession, thereby preserving the status quo.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFurthermore, as the Appellants argue, the issue of title is a legal issue to be tried by a jury.Â  â€œWhile it is true a suit for injunction invokes the equitable jurisdiction of the court, yet if the defendant claims paramount title to the land in dispute and the subject of the equitable proceeding, which title if confirmed in the defendant would defeat the equitable remedy of injunction, then the issue of title should be tried first, and it is a legal issue to be tried by a jury.â€Â  Santee River Hardwood Co. v. Hyman, 44 F.Supp. 857, 859-60 (1942).Â  Thus, the trial court erred in granting a temporary injunction based on its determination that the Springerland lease â€œwill be determined to have priority over the subsequent lease on the premises.â€ \r\nREVERSED.\r\nBEATTY, J., concurs.\r\nANDERSON, J., concurs in result only in a separate opinion. \r\nANDERSON, J. (concurring in result only):Â  I disagree with the analysis and explication in regard to the issuance and propriety of a temporary (preliminary) injunction.Â  It is necessary and essential to academically review the law extant on the efficacy of temporary injunctions.\r\nTEMPORARY (PRELIMINARY) INJUNCTIONS\r\nAn action for an injunction is equitable.Â  Blanks v. Rawson, 296 S.C. 110, 370 S.E.2dÂ  890 (Ct. App. 1988); accord Richland County v. Kaiser, 351 S.C. 89, 567 S.E.2d 260 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  An injunction is not granted as a matter of legal right, but is granted when a review of all of the evidence establishes that it is necessary to prevent irreparable harm.Â  Metts v. Wenberg, 158 S.C. 411, 155 S.E. 734 (1930); Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, 167 S.E.2d 313 (1969); see also Shapemasters Golf Course Builders, Inc. v. Shapemasters, Inc., 360 S.C. 473, 602 S.E.2d 83 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding appellant failed to show irreparable harm).Â  Injunctive relief is a drastic remedy which should be used cautiously.Â  Sprouse v. Winston, 212 S.C. 176, 46 S.E.2d 874 (1948); see Scratch Golf Co. v. Dunes West Residential Golf Properties, Inc., 361 S.C. 117, 603 S.E.2d 905 (2004).Â  â€œThe remedy of injunction is a drastic one and should be cautiously applied only when legal rights are unlawfully invaded or legal duties are willingly or wantonly neglected.â€Â  Seabrook Island Prop. Owner Assâ€™n v. Marshland Trust, Inc., 358 S.C. 655, 666, 596 S.E.2d 380, 385 (Ct. App. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting LeFurgy v. Long Cove Club Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n, Inc., 313 S.C. 555, 558, 443 S.E.2d 577, 578 (Ct. App. 1994)).Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. sections 15-55-10 through â€“100 (1976) formerly governed injunctions in this State.Â  However, upon the advent of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure on July 1, 1985, these code sections were repealed.Â  Rule 65, SCRCP, now governs injunctions.Â  \r\nTranscontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, 167 S.E.2d 313 (1969), is the leading South Carolina case on temporary injunctions.Â  There, our supreme court edified: \r\n\r\n  The two essential conditions to the granting of a temporary injunction were thus stated in Childs v. City of Columbia, 87 S.C. 566, 568, 70 S.E. 296, 297, 34 L.R.A.,N.S., 542: â€˜First, the complaint must allege facts which appear to be sufficient to constitute a cause of action for injunction; and, second, on the entire showing from both sides it must appear, in view of all the circumstances, that the injunction is reasonably necessary to protect the legal rights of the plaintiff pending the litigation.â€™\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is well settled that, in determining whether a temporary injunction should issue, the merits of the case are not to be considered, except in so far as they may enable the court to determine whether a prima facie showing has been made.Â  When a prima facie showing has been made entitling plaintiff to injunctive relief, a temporary injunction will be granted without regard to the ultimate termination of the case on the merits.Â  Alderman &amp; Sons Co. v. Wilson, 69 S.C. 156, 48 S.E. 85.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Injunctive relief, under the foregoing section, is a matter that rests in the sound discretion of the judge to whom application is made and, as stated in Alston v. Board of Health, 93 S.C. 553, 77 S.E. 727, â€˜while a judge, at chambers, cannot Finally decide anything as to the merits, he can and ought to look into the merits, whether they present issues of law or fact, and Consider them to the extent necessary to enable him to exercise his discretion wisely.â€™\r\n\r\n\r\n  We have held that a temporary injunction may properly issue to protect rights acquired under an easement.Â  Darlington Oil Company v. Pee Dee Oil &amp; Ice Company, 62 S.C. 196, 40 S.E. 169; Alderman &amp; Sons Co. v. Wilson, supra, 69 S.C. 156, 48 S.E. 85; Marion County Lumber Co. v. Tilghman Lumber Co., 75 S.C. 220, 55 S.E. 337.\r\n\r\nTranscontinental, 252 S.C. at 480-81, 167 S.E.2d at 315.\r\nPowell v. Immanuel Baptist Church, 261 S.C. 219, 199 S.E.2d 60 (1973), amplified Transcontinental by inculcating the quintessence of temporary injunctions:     \r\n\r\n  It is implicit in the language of the statute, and the authorities agree, that the sole purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo, and thus avoid possible irreparable injury to plaintiff, pending the litigation.Â  42 Am.Jur.2d, Injunctions, Sec. 13 (1969); County Council of Charleston v. Felkel, 244 S.C. 480, 137 S.E.2d 577 (1964).\r\n\r\nPowell, 261 S.C. at 221, 199 S.E.2d at 61 (emphasis added).Â  This point was reiterated by Justice Nessâ€™s dissent in Universal Life Church, Inc., v. City of North Charleston, 277 S.C. 81, 83, 282 S.E.2d 607, 608 (1981): â€œA temporary injunction is properly issued â€˜to preserve the status quo, and thus avoid possible irreparable injury to plaintiff, pending the litigation.â€™Â  (Emphasis supplied).Â  Powell v. Immanuel Baptist Church, et al., 261 S.C. 219, 221, 199 S.E.2d 60 (1973).â€Â  \r\nIn Helsel v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C. 29, 413 S.E.2d 824 (1992), the South Carolina Supreme Court elucidated:\r\n\r\n  The sole purpose of a temporary injunction is to avoid irreparable injury to a plaintiff pending final adjudication of a case.Â  Powell v. Immanuel Baptist Church, 261 S.C. 219, 221, 199 S.E.2d 60, 61 (1973).Â  When a court is requested to issue a temporary injunction it may consider the merits of a case to the extent necessary to determine whether a temporary injunction is appropriate.Â  Roberts v. Union County Board of School Trustees, 284 S.C. 299, 301, 326 S.E.2d 163, 164 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  Once a prima facie showing has been made entitling the plaintiff to injunctive relief, a temporary injunction will be granted without regard to the ultimate termination of the case on the merits.Â  Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Custom Recording Co., Inc., 258 S.C. 465, 471-72, 189 S.E.2d 305, 308 (1972).Â  A temporary injunction is made without prejudice to the rights of either party pending a hearing on the merits, and when other issues are brought to trial, they are determined without reference to the temporary injunction.Â  Alston v. Limehouse, 60 S.C. 559, 569, 39 S.E.2d 188, 191 (1901).Â  \r\n\r\nHelsel, 307 S.C. at 32, 413 S.E.2d at 826.Â  \r\nMore recently, our supreme court noted:\r\n\r\n  The sole object of a temporary injunction is to preserve the subject of the controversy in its condition at the time of the order until opportunity is offered for full and deliberate trial investigation.Â  Epps v. Bryant, 218 S.C. 359, 62 S.E.2d 832 (1950).Â  Temporary injunctions are interlocutory, tentative, and impermanent and are superseded by the final judgment rendered on the merits.Â  42 AM.JUR.2D Injunctions Â§ 294 (2000).Â  Thus, temporary injunctions â€œremain in force only until, and expire upon, the entry of final judgment and are not enforceable after the final judgment has been entered.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nCurtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 569, 549 S.E.2d 591, 597 (2001).\r\nIn Zabinski v. Bright Acres Associates, 346 S.C. 580, 553 S.E.2d 110 (2001), the court observed:\r\n\r\n  The granting of temporary injunctive relief is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  City of Columbia v. Pic-A-Flick Video, Inc., 340 S.C. 278, 531 S.E.2d 518 (2000).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court is controlled by an error of law or where the trial courtâ€™s order is based on factual conclusions without evidentiary support.Â  Id.Â  The sole purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo and thus avoid possible irreparable injury to a party pending litigation.Â  Powell v. Immanuel Baptist Church, 261 S.C. 219, 199 S.E.2d 60 (1973). \r\n\r\nZabinski, 346 S.C. at 601, 553 S.E.2d at 121.Â  \r\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, in Safety-Kleen, Inc. (Pinewood) v. Wyche, 274 F.3d 846 (4th Cir. 2001), instructed:\r\n\r\n  In evaluating whether to grant a preliminary injunction, a court should consider (1) the likelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiff if the preliminary injunction is denied; (2) the likelihood of harm to the defendant if the injunction is granted; (3) the likelihood that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits; and (4) the public interest.Â  See Direx Israel, Ltd. V. Breakthrough Med. Corp., 952 F.2d 802, 812 (4th Cir. 1991).Â  The â€œlikelihood of irreparable harm to the plaintiffâ€ is the first factor that a court should consider.Â  See id.Â  A courtâ€™s next step is to balance the likelihood of harm to the plaintiff against the likelihood of harm to the defendant.Â  See Blackwelder Furniture Co. v. Seilig Mfg. Co., 550 F.2d 189, 195 (4th Cir. 1977).Â  If the harm balance â€œtips decidedly in favor of the plaintiff, a preliminary injunction will be granted if the plaintiff has raised questions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make them fair ground for litigation and thus for more deliberate investigation.â€Â  Rum Creek Coal Sales, Inc. v. Caperton, 926 F.2d 353, 359 (4th Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).Â  In other words, the plaintiffâ€™s case must at bottom present a â€œsubstantial question.â€\r\n\r\nSafety-Kleen, 274 F.3d at 858-59.\r\nIn County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 560 S.E.2d 902 (Ct. App. 2002), this Court propounded:\r\n\r\n  A plaintiffâ€™s entitlement to an injunction requires the complaint to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for injunction while also showing an injunction must be reasonably necessary to protect the legal rights of the plaintiff pending in the litigation.Â  Transcontâ€™l Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, 480-81, 167 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1969).Â  Generally, to obtain an injunction, a party must demonstrate irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, and an inadequate remedy at law.Â  Roach v. Combined Util. Commâ€™n, 290 S.C. 437, 442, 351 S.E.2d 168, 170 (Ct. App. 1986). \r\n\r\nSimpkins, 348 S.C. at 669, 560 S.E.2d at 904\r\nThe court, in FOC Lawshe Limited Partnership v.

M.A. Bailey &amp; Associates, 356 S.C. 363, 588 S.E.2d 635 (Ct.

Pic-A-Flick Video, Inc., 340 S.C. 278, 282, 531 S.E.2d 518, 520-21 (2000).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.â€Â  County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n  To warrant a temporary injunction, the complaint must allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for injunction and the information offered by both sides must demonstrate the injunction to be reasonably necessary to protect the legal rights of the plaintiff pending in the litigation.Â  Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Porter, 252 S.C. 478, 480-81, 167 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1969).Â  Generally, to obtain an injunction, a party must demonstrate irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, and an inadequate remedy at law.Â  Roach v.

App. 1986).\r\n  \r\n    It is well settled that, in determining whether a temporary injunction should issue, the merits of the case are not to be considered, except in so far as they may enable the court to determine whether a prima facie showing has been made.Â  When a prima facie showing has been made entitling plaintiff to injunctive relief, a temporary injunction will be granted without regard to the ultimate termination of the case on the merits. \r\n  \r\n  Transcon., 252 S.C. at 481, 167 S.E.2d at 315.Â  â€œ[T]he sole purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo . . . .â€Â  Powell v.

Mostek Corp., 797 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1986).Â  The fact that a court orders arbitration of a dispute does not â€œabsolve [it] of its obligation to consider the merits of a requested preliminary injunction.â€Â  Roso-Lino Bev.

Cantrell, of Pelzer, for Appellant.\r\nR. Davis Howser, Andrew E. Haselden, Michael Todd Loftis and Sylvia P. Harrison, all of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Larry Cantrell brought this action against Beattie Ashmore and Robert Ariail, seeking to recover property forfeited after his arrest and to reinstate the forfeiture action to the jury trial docket.Â  The trial court dismissed the action.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS[2]\r\nCantrell was convicted of trafficking in cocaine in 1999.Â  Ashmore represented him at the time, and Ariail prosecuted the case on behalf of the State. Subsequent to the conviction, Ariail filed a complaint for forfeiture of items seized from Cantrell.Â Â Â  \r\nAt the time of the forfeiture action, Cantrell granted his mother a general power of attorney. Ashmore and Ariail reached a settlement regarding the forfeiture of certain items, with other items being placed in the possession of Cantrellâ€™s mother.Â  Cantrellâ€™s mother signed the consent agreement on his behalf.Â  The consent order was issued in March 2000. \r\nCantrell filed a complaint in January 2003, in which he alleged:Â  â€œThe Defendants by deceit, trickery, and knowingly making a false statement of material fact and assisting Plaintiffâ€™s General Power of Attorney to commit fraud upon the Court.â€Â  He alleged he intended to assert his right to a jury trial in the forfeiture action and in no way consented or agreed to the compromise settlement. Cantrell also maintained his mother was led to believe he consented to the forfeiture and she â€œwould have never entered into this compromise settlement if she had known the truth that neither Defendants had discussed this matter with her son.â€Â  \r\nFor relief, Cantrell asked the court to â€œgrant his Motion to Restore his Forfeiture case No 99-CP-39-491 back on the docket for a jury trial.â€Â  Additionally, he sought an order requiring â€œthe Defendants to pay the Plaintiffs for all the property and return all the money contained within the Complaint for Forfeiture.â€Â  Finally, he sought payment of his costs and any other relief the court deemed just and proper.Â  \r\nAshmore and Ariail moved to dismiss the action pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 12(c), SCRCP, on the ground that time for filing under the statute of limitations contained in section 15-3-550 of the South Carolina Code (2005) had passed.Â  Additionally, each filed an answer asserting numerous defenses including the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.Â  \r\nThe trial court issued a Form 4 order, which simply read:Â  â€œSolicitor Robert Ariail is DISMISSED.Â  Beattie Ashmore is DISMISSED.â€ (R.45). Cantrell failed to file a motion to reconsider pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCantrell maintains the trial court erred in dismissing his action.Â  He alleges it was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations under section 15-3-550 of the South Carolina Code (2005) because he brought an action for fraud and not an action based upon the forfeiture, or in the alternative, the two-year statute of limitations was tolled.Â  We find Cantrellâ€™s arguments are not preserved as they were never ruled on by the trial court in its order, and he failed to raise them in a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\nAccordingly, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,Â  and BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The majority of the facts are derived from the complaint filed by Cantrell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-372","title":"Kneece v.

Kneece (collectively â€œKneeceâ€), appeals the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of William H. Babcock, M.D., and South Carolina Oncology Associates, P.A.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn early 1999, Robert Kneece was diagnosed with colon cancer.Â  Surgery was performed in February 1999, and the tumor and part of his colon were removed.Â  After the surgery, Mr. Kneece was referred to Dr. Babcock, an oncologist employed by South Carolina Oncology Associates, P.A., for follow-up care.Â  \r\nAt a visit on April 19, 1999, Dr. Babcock ordered blood tests to monitor Mr. Kneeceâ€™s carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, which is considered a marker for cancer.Â  The initial CEA registered a count of 4.4, which was within the â€œnormalâ€ range though slightly higher than Mr. Kneeceâ€™s preoperative level of 3.8. A second CEA test in July revealed a level at 5.7, a number just slightly outside the normal range.Â  A third test was taken in January of 2000 which showed Mr. Kneeceâ€™s CEA level had become significantly elevated, with a CEA count of 28.5.Â  Dr. Babcock had the test repeated in February.Â  The resulting count was further elevated at 38.7.Â  A CT scan revealed several areas in the liver that were suspicious for metastatic disease.Â  A biopsy of the liver was positive for carcinoma.Â  Following the diagnosis, Mr. Kneece explored multiple courses of therapy.Â  Unfortunately, the treatments were unsuccessful and Mr. Kneece died from liver cancer on November 23, 2000, less than two years after the initial diagnosis.Â  \r\nKneece alleged Dr. Babcock negligently failed to make a timely diagnosis and that Dr. Babcock failed to initiate treatment in a timely fashion.Â  Specifically, Kneece argued Dr. Babcock took no action with regard to the elevated CEA in July 1999 and, as a result, was negligent in treating Mr. Kneece, which shortened his life.Â  \r\nPrior to trial, both Kneece and Dr. Babcock deposed medical experts as to the standard of care, whether Dr. Babcock deviated from that standard, and whether Dr. Babcockâ€™s actions most probably caused the injury to Mr. Kneece.Â  As a result of these depositions, Dr. Babcock moved the circuit court for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court granted the summary judgment in favor of Dr. Babcock finding, as a matter of law that Kneece was unable to establish a causal connection between the delay in diagnosis and Mr. Kneeceâ€™s subsequent death.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Laurens Emergency Med. Specialists, P.A. v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Sons Bankers, 355 S.C. 104, 109, 584 S.E.2d 375, 377 (2003).Â  Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the evidence and all the inferences which can be drawn therefrom should be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  At the summary judgment stage of litigation, the court does not weigh conflicting evidence with respect to a disputed material fact.Â  South Carolina Prop. &amp; Cas. Guar. Assâ€™n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518, 548 S.E.2d 880, 883 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Kneeceâ€™s â€œshortened lifeâ€ argument\r\nKneece first argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Dr. Babcock because the circuit court failed to consider that Dr. Babcock â€œnegligently shortened Mr. Kneeceâ€™s lifeâ€ by failing to begin cancer treatments earlier.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for appeal.\r\nIn order to preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Holy Loch Distrib., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000).Â  Where a party raises an issue, but the circuit court never rules on it, the party must file a motion to alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue for appellate review.Â  Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991).\r\nThe circuit court order granting summary judgment did not address Kneeceâ€™s theory that Dr. Babcock could be held liable for shortening Mr. Kneeceâ€™s life.Â  Absent a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the order to receive a ruling on this issue from the circuit court, it is not preserved for our review.\r\nII.Â  â€œLoss of chance of survivalâ€ doctrine\r\nKneece next alleges recovery in this matter should be allowed under the â€œloss of chance of survivalâ€ doctrine.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court expressly and unanimously rejected the â€œloss of chance of survivalâ€ doctrine in Jones v. Owings, 318 S.C. 72, 77, 456 S.E.2d 371, 374 (1995).Â  As Chief Justice Toal states in her treatise on South Carolina appellate practice, â€œthe Court of Appeals is an error-correction court, whereas the Supreme Court is a law-giving court.Â  The decisions of the Supreme Court bind the Court of Appeals.â€Â  Toal, Vafai &amp; Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in South Carolina, at 12 (2d ed. 2002).Â  See also S.C. Const., art. V. Â§ 9 (establishing the jurisdiction of the court of appeals and explaining the binding effect of supreme court opinions); Daniels v. City of Goose Creek, 314 S.C. 494, 498, 431 S.E.2d 256, 260 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding that any modification of supreme court case law must be undertaken by the supreme court).Â  \r\nTherefore, we reject Kneeceâ€™s contention that the circuit court erred in denying recovery under the â€œloss of chance of survivalâ€ theory.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of William H. Babcock, M.D., and South Carolina Oncology Associates, P.A., is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-373","title":"State v.

Pieper, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-373\r\nHeard April 4, 2005 â€“ Filed June 10, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJack B. Swerling, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  James Summersett appeals his conviction for murder, arguing the trial court erred in three of its evidentiary rulings.Â  We are asked to decide: (1) whether certain testimony admitted was improper character evidence; (2) whether evidence of a prior bad act was properly admitted under Rule 404(b), SCRE; and (3) whether two rap songs admitted into evidence were sufficiently relevant and not unfairly prejudicial.Â  Finding no reversible error or abuse of discretion, we affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThis case concerns a fatal shooting that occurred during a street brawl involving Summersett and several other individuals on April 15, 2002.Â  During the fight, Summersett fired a pistol, killing Julian Grant.Â  Summersett claimed the shooting was an accident.Â  He was tried and convicted for murder.\r\nThe Fight and Shooting\r\nThe fight involved two families who lived on the same street and had known each other for many years.Â  It erupted in front of the home of Josephine Hawkins, the victimâ€™s grandmother.Â  Summersettâ€™s parents lived next door.\r\nThe fight initially started between Jason Grant (the victimâ€™s brother) and Travis Brown (Summersettâ€™s cousin) during an argument over an unpaid debt.Â  Their argument quickly escalated and turned physical.Â  Others soon joined in the fight, including Jeremy Hawkins (the victimâ€™s cousin) and Summersettâ€™s brother, Quincy.Â  Hawkins began striking Quincy in the head, prompting Summersett to join the fight.Â  Using the butt of his pistol, Summersett struck Hawkins in the head.Â  The victim, Julian Grant, then intervened.Â  According to trial testimony, Julian Grant was attempting to break up the fight, and in so doing, pushed Summersett, causing him to fall to the ground.Â  At that point, Summersettâ€™s gun fired,Â  fatally wounding Grant. \r\nSummersett then fled the area.Â  Law enforcement was called to the scene and immediately launched a search for Summersett.Â Â  A few hours after the shooting, Summersett telephoned William Thrower, an attorney who had represented Summersett in the past.Â  Thrower testified that Summersett explained he had shot Julian Grant by mistake.Â  Summersett also told Thrower he would not turn himself in until he could obtain a statement from eyewitnesses that could corroborate his version of events. \r\nLaw enforcement continued its investigation and search for Summersett, but he managed to avoid detection in the days following the shooting.Â  Approximately two weeks later, Summersett was found living in a North Charleston motel where he was arrested and charged with the murder of Julian Grant.Â  \r\nAt Trial\r\nSummersett testified at trial, denying he intentionally shot Grant.Â  On the stand, he admitted firing the weapon, but he maintained it was purely unintentional, discharging accidentally after he was pushed and fell to the ground.Â Â  Â Â  \r\nThe State presented two factual theories for its murder case against Summersett.Â  The first theory was simply that Summersett directly intended to shoot Grant.Â  In support of this theory, the State called several witnesses who testified that Summersett deliberately pointed and aimed the gun at Grant and shot.Â  The defense attempted to counter this theory by offering the testimony of eyewitnesses who claimed the gun fired accidentally when Summersett fell and hit the ground.Â  Summersett also took the stand and claimed the shooting was purely accidental.Â  The State attempted to rebut Summersettâ€™s claim of accident or mistake by offering the testimony of William Thrower regarding a 1993 incident in which Summersett shot a â€œfriendâ€ in the foot and claimed accident.Â  Defense counsel objected to this evidence under Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  The objection was overruled, and the testimony was admitted under the â€œabsence of mistake or accidentâ€ exception to Rule 404(b). \r\nThe second factual theory offered by the State was that Summersett actually intended to shoot another person involved in the brawlâ€”Jeremy Hawkinsâ€”not Grant.Â  In support of this alternate theory, the State sought the admission of two rap songs written by Summersett and recorded at his music studio that contain lyrics expressing venomous threats directed at Hawkins.Â  In conjunction with these songs, the State offered evidence that Hawkins had been involved in a sexual relationship with Summersettâ€™s girlfriend and also that Hawkins had been providing information to the federal government in its investigation of illegal narcotics activity in the area.Â  Appellant objected to the admission of the rap songs, which the trial court overruled. \r\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Summersett guilty on all charges, and the trial court sentenced Summersett to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[1]\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nÂ \r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  This court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  â€œOn review, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThis Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.â€ Id.Â  â€œThe admission and exclusion of evidence is largely a matter of trial judge discretion and his rulings will not be overturned on appeal unless he manifestly abuses his discretion and the defendant suffered prejudice as a result.â€Â  State v. Thompson, 305 S.C. 496, 502, 409 S.E.2d 420, 424 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOn appeal, Summersett challenges three of the trial courtâ€™s evidentiary rulings.Â  We address these arguments individually below.\r\nI.Â  Admission of Character Evidence\r\nSummersett first argues the trial court erred in admitting improper character evidence in the form of testimony concerning the fact that Summersett\r\nfathered six children by five different women out of wedlock.Â  We conclude that any error, if found, would be harmless in light of other evidence adduced at trial.\r\nThe State began its cross-examination of Summersett with the following colloquy:\r\n\r\nSOLICITOR:Â  All right, Jimmy.Â  By way of background, letâ€™s get some clarity on some of these things.Â  You were talking about you have one child?\r\nSUMMERSETT:&nbsp; No.\r\nSOLICITOR:Â  You actually have five children; donâ€™t you?\r\nSUMMERSETT:&nbsp; Six.\r\nSOLICITOR:Â  Six children?\r\nSUMMERSETT: Yes.\r\nSOLICITOR:Â  By how many different women?\r\nSUMMERSETT:&nbsp; Five.\r\n. . . .\r\nSOLICITOR:Â  Okay.Â  Have you ever had any of those children while you were in wedlock with your wife?Â  Did you ever have any children out of wedlock?\r\nSUMMERSETT:&nbsp; Iâ€™m not legally married.\r\n\r\nDefense counsel then objected that the State was attempting to introduce improper character evidenceâ€”specifically arguing that the State was using this line of questioning to imply that â€œif you have one child out of wedlock you are a bad person.â€Â  The trial court overruled the objection and allowed the Stateâ€™s cross-examination on this subject to continue.\r\nInitially, we note this argument may not be properly preserved for our review.Â  Defense counselâ€™s objection to the solicitorâ€™s cross-examination regarding Summersett having fathered multiple children out of wedlock came only after several questions on this subject had been asked and answered by Summersett. See State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (holding that a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate review); State v. Sullivan, 310 S.C. 311, 314, 426 S.E.2d 766, 768 (1993) (holding that â€œ[t]o preserve an issue for appellate review, an appellant must object at his first opportunityâ€).Â  Therefore, it is arguable whether Summersettâ€™s trial counsel effectively preserved the objection to this line of questioning.Â  \r\nEven if properly preserved, however, we find Summersett is not entitled to relief on this issue.Â  Rule 404(a), SCRE, states the general rule that â€œ[e]vidence of a personâ€™s character or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion . . . .â€Â  However, when the accused offers evidence of his good character regarding specific character traits relevant to the crime charged, the prosecution has the right to cross-examine him as to particular bad acts or conduct. State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 6, 501 S.E.2d 716, 718 (1998).Â  The State is restricted, however, to showing bad character only for the traits initially focused on by the accused. State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 174, 508 S.E.2d 870, 878 (1998). \r\nThe State argues the trial court properly admitted the evidence regarding Summersett having fathered six children by five different women out of wedlock because Summersett put this particular character trait in issue by virtue of several repeated references to his son, Ques, during his testimony on direct examination.Â  These references to his son occurred during Summersettâ€™s narrative of the events leading up to the April 15, 2002, shooting.Â  In describing his activities and movement that afternoon, Summersett mentioned that he picked up his son from school and took him to his baseball game and that taking care of his son in this fashion was part of his normal routine.Â  \r\nIn its argument to the trial judge and again in this appeal, the State asserts that the cumulative effect of this testimony was to paint a â€œbroad pictureâ€ that Summersett was a â€œdevoted fatherâ€ by â€œshowcasing only one son.â€Â  Accordingly, the State claims that Summersettâ€™s testimony regarding his son â€œopened the doorâ€ to impeachment of his â€œgood father image.â€ \r\nBased on our review of Summersettâ€™s testimony we find a close question is presented as to the admissibility of the testimony at issue.Â  While it is perhaps arguable that Summersett was attempting to leverage his testimony to foster a â€œgood father image,â€ it appears more likely that Summersett was simply referring to his son in a fashion purely incidental to his narrative description of the events prior to the shooting.Â  \r\nNevertheless, we find it unnecessary to reach an ultimate determination as to whether the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting this testimony because the error, if found, would be harmless in light of the other evidence of Summersettâ€™s promiscuity presented at trial.Â  Our supreme court has held that â€œwhere there is other properly admitted evidence of conduct demonstrating the particular character trait in question, there is no reversible error.â€ State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 196, 577 S.E.2d 445, 448 (2003); see also State v. Brown, 344 S.C. 70, 75, 543 S.E.2d 552, 555 (2001) (noting that â€œ[t]he erroneous admission of character evidence is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if its impact is minimal in the context of the entire recordâ€); State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 463, 469 S.E.2d 49, 54 (1996) (instructing that error in admission of evidence is harmless where it is cumulative to other evidence which was properly admitted); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993) (noting that any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence is harmless).Â  \r\nIn this case, three witnesses took the stand before Summersett who each testified that Summersett had an ongoing sexual relationship with Jeremy Hawkinsâ€™ wife, Tasha Hawkins, while Summersett was either married or engaged to another woman.Â  Additionally, Jeremy Hawkins testified that he was having an affair with Summersettâ€™s fiancÃ©e, and that Summersett was aware of this fact at the time.Â  Summersett raised no objection to any of this testimony about his promiscuity.Â  Accordingly, we conclude that the Stateâ€™s cross-examination of Summersett regarding his having children out of wedlock by different women was merely cumulative to the other, unobjected-to evidence of Summersettâ€™s promiscuity and infidelity contained in the record.Â  Any error by the trial court in allowing the State to pursue this line of questioning was therefore harmless.\r\nII.Â  Admission of Prior Bad Act Evidence\r\nSummersett next asserts the trial court improperly admitted into evidence a prior bad act as relevant to the issue of whether Summersett accidentally or intentionally shot the victim in the present case.Â  We find no abuse of discretion.\r\nAt trial, the State sought to introduce evidence that Summersett had previously been charged with assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK) stemming from an incident in which he shot another person during an argument.Â  The trial court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine the admissibility of this evidence.\r\nDuring the hearing, the State presented the testimony of William Thrower, Summersettâ€™s former attorney.Â  Thrower testified that Summersett shot Ernie Riley in the foot during a confrontation between the two in 1993.Â  After the incident, Summersett fled the scene, but later called Riley to apologize for the shooting, claiming it was unintentional and purely accidental.Â  Summersett was later found, arrested, and charged with ABIK.Â  In his defense, Summersett claimed Riley was a friend and that he inadvertently shot Riley while aiming the pistol towards the ground.Â  Thrower testified that Summersett ultimately entered a plea of nolo contendere to the ABIK charge.Â  \r\nThe State argued that Throwerâ€™s testimony was admissible to show lack of mistake or accident by Summersett when he shot Grant in the present case.Â  Summersett objected to the evidence of the prior shooting, arguing the incident with Riley was not relevant because it was too remote, dissimilar, and unrelated to the present charge and that admission of this evidence would be highly inflammatory and unfairly prejudicial.Â  He also argued that the State had failed to offer clear and convincing proof of the underlying facts of the prior shooting.\r\nThe law in South Carolina regarding the admission of evidence of prior bad acts is well established.Â  As a general rule, evidence of other crimes or prior bad acts is inadmissible to show criminal propensity or to demonstrate the accused is a bad individual.Â  State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 143, 591 S.E.2d 646, 652 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Such evidence is admissible, however, when it tends to establish (1) motive, (2) intent, (3) the absence of mistake or accident, (4) a common scheme or plan, or (5) the identity of the person charged with the present crime. Rule 404(b), SCRE; State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  To be admissible under one of these permitted exceptions, a prior bad act must first be established by clear and convincing evidence. State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 135, 536 S.E.2d 679, 683 (2000). Next, the record must support a logical relevance between the prior bad act and the crime for which the defendant is accused. State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 634, 541 S.E.2d 833, 836 (2001). Finally, even if relevant, the trial court must exclude the evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Rule 403, SCRE; State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 512, 514 S.E.2d 578, 582 (1999). Of course, the decision to admit contested evidence is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). \r\nIn the present case, the trial court admitted the evidence of the prior shooting under the absence of mistake or accident exception to Rule 404(b), SCRE, and Lyle.Â  However, it limited its ruling to admission of the underlying conduct, not admission of the resulting conviction.Â  Summersett now contends the admission of this evidence was an abuse of discretion.Â  We are unpersuaded.\r\n\r\nA.Â  Â Â Â  Clear and Convincing Evidence\r\n\r\nFirst, we find no reversible error in the trial courtâ€™s finding there was clear and convincing evidence of the prior shooting.Â  â€œWhen considering whether there is clear and convincing evidence of other bad acts, this court is bound by the trial judgeâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.â€ State v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 325, 580 S.E.2d 186, 189 (Ct. App. 2003); see also State v. Wallace, 364 S.C. 130, 611 S.E.2d 332, 335 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting that â€œ[t]his court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial courtâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidenceâ€). In this case, there is evidence in the record in the form of William Throwerâ€™s detailed testimony concerning his direct knowledge of the prior shooting and Summersettâ€™s subsequent claim of accident.Â  The determination as to whether this testimony clearly and convincingly established that the prior shooting occurred is a matter well within the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Tutton, 354 S.C. at 325-26, 580 S.E.2d at 190.Â  We find no abuse of that discretion in light of Throwerâ€™s proffered testimony.\r\n\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relevance Under the Absence of Mistake\r\nor Accident Exception to LyleÂ Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nHaving found the record supports the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Summersett committed the prior bad act, we must next determine whether there is a logical relevance between the prior act and the crime charged.Â  We find this necessary connection is sufficiently established.Â  \r\nThe determination of logical relevancy does not depend simply upon an enumeration of the similarities between the two incidents.Â  Rather, the evidence in question is relevant if it tends to prove or disprove a material fact or element of the crime charged. See State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 28, 393 S.E.2d 364, 369 (1990); State v. Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 241, 609 S.E.2d 572, 582 (Ct. App. 2005). â€œ[I]fÂ  [the evidence of the other crime] is logically pertinent in that it reasonably tends to prove a material fact in issue, it is not to be rejected merely because it incidentally proves the defendant guilty of another crime.â€ Lyle, 125 S.C. at 416, 118 S.E. at 807.\r\nThe material fact at the very center of this case concerns whether Summersett intentionally or accidentally shot the victim.Â  The evidence of the prior shooting of Ernie Riley is directly probative on this critical question of fact.Â  Evidence in the record indicates that, in both incidents, Summersett engaged in a violent confrontationâ€”whether actual or threatenedâ€”with an acquaintance.Â  Both times Summersett wielded a firearm in a threatening manner.Â  Ernie Riley testified that, in the first incident, Summersett confronted him on the street, grabbed Rileyâ€™s gun, and threatened to shoot him.Â  During this altercation, Summersett fired the weapon, striking Riley in the foot.Â  Likewise, in the present case, Summersett entered a fight brandishing a weapon, hammer cocked, and even used the firearm as a blunt-force object to strike another person in the head.Â  As in the Riley incident, Summersett fired the weapon during the brawl, wounding another personâ€”this time fatally.Â  In both cases, Summersett fled the scene and later claimed accident.\r\nThese closely parallel facts tend to prove Summersett acted with full knowledge of the risks that obtain when brandishing and using a firearmÂ  when engaged in actual or threatened physical violence against another person.Â  Such knowledge makes it substantially less likely Summersett haplessly and unintentionally fired his weapon in the present case as he claims to have done.Â  The logical relevancy between the two incidents is therefore clear and unmistakable. \r\nWe acknowledge that evidence of this prior shooting potentially paints Summersett as an individual prone to deadly violence.Â  This fact is not to be lightly dismissed.Â  Nevertheless, when, as in the instant case, the logical relevance between two incidents is clearly perceived, we may notâ€”consistent with the mandate of Lyleâ€”choose to ignore the evidence of the prior act simply because it incidentally proves the defendant is guilty of another crime.\r\n\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Balancing Probative Value and\r\nPrejudice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\nFinally, even if the evidence is clear and convincing and logically relevant within a Lyle exception, the trial court must exclude it under Rule 403, SCRE, if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. See State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 468, 523 S.E.2d 787, 791 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Rule 403, SCRE).Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s ruling that the Rule 403 balancing weighed in favor of admitting the evidence.Â  \r\nIn this case, the Rule 403 calculus is in our view a close one.Â  We recognize that the violent nature of the prior act and its similarity to the crime charged enhanced the danger of unfair prejudice in this case.Â  However, it is exactly these close questions that give rise to the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review.Â  Inherent in this standard is the well-settled recognition that there are difficult evidentiary questions that turn on matters uniquely within the purview of the trial court.Â  \r\nThe trial court is uniquely positioned to make the careful, nuanced judgments required when balancing fact-specific concepts like probative value and prejudice, and we are reluctant to disturb the sound exercise of that discretion.[2]Â  See State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct. App. 2003) (noting that the Court of Appeals should â€œreview a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding Rule 403 pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard and are obligated to give great deference to the trial courtâ€™s judgmentâ€); State v. Grace, 350 S.C. 19, 28, 564 S.E.2d 331, 335 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating that â€œ[a] trial courtâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value versus prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional circumstancesâ€); State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 358, 543 S.E.2d 586, 593 (Ct. App. 2001) (opining that â€œ[a] trial judgeâ€™s balancing decision under Rule 403 should not be reversed simply because an appellate court believes it would have decided the matter otherwise because of a differing view of the highly subjective factors of the probative value or the prejudice presented by the evidenceâ€), overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005). \r\nBecause the balancing of probative value and the danger of unfair prejudice presented such a close question in this case, we find the issue fell squarely within the ambit of the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion, and we are unpersuaded of the need to overturn the trial courtâ€™s decision.\r\nIII.Â  Admission of Rap Songs\r\nSummersettâ€™s final argument on appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting two rap songs and related testimony into evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe State sought to introduce the rap songs into evidence in order to prove Jeremy Hawkins was Summersettâ€™s intended target when he fired his handgun during the street brawl in April 2002.Â  Summersett admitted he participated in writing and producing both songs at his record studio and admitted the lyrics directly refer to Jeremy Hawkins (specifically mentioned in the song by his nickname, â€œScroogeâ€).Â  Importantly, Summersett does not deny the clear animus towards Hawkins conveyed throughout the lyrics to these songs.Â  For example, Summersett explained that passages in the songs such as, â€œNow tell me how does it feel to be the snitch on the block / You sold your soul to the devil cuzâ€™ you have no heart,â€ refer specifically to the fact that it was widely believed in the community that Hawkins was acting as a confidential informant for federal authorities in an ongoing narcotics investigation.Â  Along this same line, a subsequent passage reads, â€œSo you best check yourself, bulletproof yourself, and tell them feds they best help you protect yourself.â€Â  \r\nOther parts of the songs allude to Hawkinsâ€™ adulterous affairs with Summersettâ€™s girlfriend and Summersettâ€™s own affair with Hawkinsâ€™ wife: â€œNow let me tell you something thatâ€™s true / When I was locked up, you f---ed my bitch and now Iâ€™m f---ing yours too.â€Â  Again, Summersett admitted these lyrics refer specifically to Hawkins.\r\nDefense counsel objected to the admission of these songs, arguing they were highly inflammatory because of the profanity and violence depicted and were not sufficiently probative of any intent by Summersett to harm Hawkins because the lyrics were too general or vague and were written at a time too remote from the shooting.Â  The trial court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence with the following instruction to the jury:\r\n\r\nIf you should decide that the lyrics are generalized music lyrics, you must not consider them in any way because generalized lyrics including any generalized threats of violence found in a musical composition are not relevant in any way.\r\nOn the other hand, should you decide the lyrics are specific as to Jeremy Hawkins, you may give those lyrics such weight, if any, as you deem appropriate only as to issues of motive and intent about which issues I will fully explain in the law in my concluding instructions to you.\r\nYou must not consider these lyrics as evidence of the defendantâ€™s character or in any other way inconsistent with my specific instructions.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court did, however, grant defense counselâ€™s request that a transcript of the lyrics not be admitted into evidence.Â  Instead, the two rap songs at issue were played in their entirety to the jury from a compact disc recording.Â  \r\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the songs into evidence.Â  Our supreme court addressed a similar question concerning the admissibility of music lyrics in State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 552 S.E.2d 300 (2001).Â  In that case, the trial court admitted into evidence rap lyrics the accused had written in jail while awaiting trial for the underlying murder charge.Â  The lyrics at issue in Cheeseboro contained violent references to â€œleaving no prints and bodies left in a pool of blood.â€ Id. at 550, 552 S.E.2d at 313.Â Â  Applying the basic threshold relevancy analysis set out in Rule 403, SCRE, the supreme court found the admission of this evidence was error because the lyrics lacked any connection to the crimes committed:Â  â€œWe find these references too vague in context to support the admission of this evidence. . . . [T]hese lyrics contain only general references glorifying violence.â€ Id.Â  The court therefore concluded that â€œ[t]he minimal probative value of this document is far outweighed by its unfair prejudicial impact as evidence of appellantâ€™s bad character, i.e. his propensity for violence in general.â€Â  Id.\r\nApplying the same Rule 403, SCRE, relevancy analysis in the present case compels a different conclusion.Â  Unlike the vague lyrics at issue in Cheeseboro, the songs admitted in the present caseâ€”by Summersettâ€™s own admissionâ€”refer specifically to Jeremy Hawkins.Â  Instead of â€œgeneral references glorifying violence,â€ the songs in this case convey clear animus in the form of violent and vitriolic lyrics directed at Hawkins.Â  The message of these songs is therefore clearly probative of Summersettâ€™s alleged motive and intent to kill Hawkins.Â  While we recognize the possibility that the jury could improperly consider the overall violence and profanity of these songs as reflecting poorly upon Summersettâ€™s character and his propensity for violence in general, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s determination that the danger of unfair prejudice is outweighed by the probative value that arises from the pointed animus conveyed in these songs Summersett wrote and produced.Â  Moreover, the danger of unfair prejudice was diminished by the trial courtâ€™s instruction to the jury as to the limited purposes for which they could consider this evidence.Â  Notably, Summersett raised no objection to the adequacy of this instruction.\r\nFor these reasons, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the two raps songs into evidence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, though we find this case presents a number of difficult evidentiary questions, we conclude the trial courtâ€™s rulings did not exceed the prescribed legal and discretionary bounds discussed above or otherwise rise to the level of reversible error.Â  Finding none of Summersettâ€™s claims on appeal warrant reversal, we affirm his conviction in all respects.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] In addition to the murder charge, Summersett was also charged with possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence.Â  In light of the sentence imposed for the murder conviction, the trial court found it unnecessary to pronounce sentence for the conviction for possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence. \r\n[2] Viewing the record as a whole, it is notable that the Riley incident was only one of several similar prior bad acts the State attempted to admit into evidence.Â  Carefully applying the Lyle analysis, the trial court thoroughly examined each of these prior acts to determine admissibilityâ€”ultimately finding the Riley incident alone satisfied the standard for admission. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-374","title":"State v.

Edwards, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-378\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2005 â€“ Filed June 13, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        William Patrick Yon, of Anderson, for Appellant.\r\n        William N. Epps, Jr., of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this domestic action, Charles McFarlin (Husband) appeals a family court order holding him in contempt for violations of an earlier temporary order.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn April 2, 2003, Dymaris McFarlin (Wife) filed a complaint for divorce and a motion for temporary relief against Husband.Â  After a hearing on her request for temporary relief, the family court issued a temporary order awarding Wife possession of the marital home and ordering Husband to bring the mortgage current as of May 1, 2003, with Wife bearing responsibility for the mortgage thereafter.Â  The family court further ordered Husband to pay $2,000 per month in alimony beginning May 1, 2003, with the express qualification that the court could grant Husband reimbursement of this alimony upon a hearing on the merits of the underlying divorce action.Â  \r\nOn June 3, 2003, Wife filed a rule to show cause against Husband, alleging he failed to comply with the temporary order.Â  Wife asserted Husband failed to bring the mortgage current as of May 1, 2003, causing the mortgage holder to foreclose, and that he refused to make alimony payments.Â  Husband denied Wifeâ€™s allegations, arguing he did not willfully violate the temporary order, but was unable to make the payments due to disability and an erroneous calculation of his income.Â  Husband also alleged that Wife committed fraud on the court by falsifying e-mails to support an untruthful adultery allegation. \r\nAfter a hearing on July 30, 2003, the family court found Husband was capable of making the mortgage payments through May 1 and held him in willful contempt.Â  Husband was sentenced to six months in jail, suspended upon payment of the mortgage up to the specified date within 45 days of the contempt order. Â Â \r\nBased upon Husbandâ€™s reported earnings from April 2003 through the end of July, the family court also found Husband in willful contempt of the temporary alimony order and sentenced him to six months in jail, suspended upon payment of half the $6,000 arrearage.Â  Due to Husbandâ€™s documented minor knee surgery, the family court held the remainder of the arrearage in abeyance until the final hearing and ordered that Husband pay only $850 per month from August 1 until October 31, 2003.Â  Husbandâ€™s motion to reconsider was denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999). A finding of contempt, however, should not be reversed on appeal unless it is without evidentiary support or amounts to an abuse of discretion. Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840, 840 (1988).\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in finding him in contempt because the evidence presented at the hearing did not support a finding that he willfully violated the temporary order.Â  We disagree.[2]\r\nSection 20-7-1350 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) states that an â€œadult who willfully violates, neglects, or refuses to obey or perform a lawful order of the court . . . may be proceeded against for contempt of court.â€Â  For the purposes of determining contempt, â€œ[a]n act is willful if â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™â€Â  Wilson v. Walker, 340 S.C. 531, 538, 532 S.E.2d 19, 22 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988)).Â  The moving party must show the existence of a court order and facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance with the order.Â  Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 338, 491 S.E.2d 583, 588 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Thereafter,Â  â€œthe burden shifts to the respondent to establish his defense and inability to comply.â€Â  Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1989).Â  The record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct before a party may be held in contempt.Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, the temporary order clearly mandates that Husband bring the mortgage current as of May 1, 2003 and pay Wife $2000 per month in alimony.Â  Husband did not deny his failure to comply with the order, but asserted the violations were not willful because of his financial situation. A review of the record reveals substantial evidence supporting the family courtâ€™s finding of willful contempt.Â  Husband testified that he earned $15,983 from April 21 to July 21, 2003, the time period in question.Â  Although Husband had sufficient income to comply with the family courtâ€™s order, he chose to use his income for other purposes.Â  Husband was clearly capable of paying for goods and services such as utilities, groceries, a private detective, and his attorney, but did not attempt to pay any portion of the money he owed to Wife.Â  Based upon these facts, we find the record clearly and specifically reflects Husbandâ€™s contemptuous behavior, and Husband did not meet his burden in proving he was unable to comply.\r\nHusband also contends that Wifeâ€™s unilateral listing of the marital home for sale at an inflated price has negatively affected his ability to comply with the temporary order.Â  This issue, however, was satisfactorily resolved by the family courtâ€™s contempt order.Â  Paragraph 10 of the family courtâ€™s order states the following:\r\nAs to the sale of the marital home, I find that [Husband] shall have full rights to meet with the listing realtor for a discussion of sales price.Â  If the parties cannot agree on the fair market price to be asked for the home, either party may make a Motion to submit that issue to the Court for determination.\r\nAs to the affect of Wifeâ€™s alleged unilateral insistence on asking an unreasonably high price for the home on Husbandâ€™s past ability to comply with the temporary order, the family court found Husband was able to comply notwithstanding Wifeâ€™s behavior.Â  As discussed above, the evidence supported this finding. \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the family courtâ€™s contempt order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Husband also makes several arguments relating to the merits of Wifeâ€™s allegations of adultery as a ground for divorce.Â  These issues are not presently ripe for our review.Â  The purpose of a temporary order is to maintain the status quo until the issues of a case can be determined in a family court hearing on their merits.Â  The present order expressly reserves the family courtâ€™s power to reimburse Husband all payments made pursuant to the temporary order following a hearing on the validity of Wifeâ€™s allegations.Â  Because these issues have yet to be resolved in their proper forum, a divorce hearing in the family court, we do not address them here. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-379","title":"Schneider v.

Elliott, and AssistantÂ  Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, allÂ  of Columbia; and Solicitor Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â Nathan D. Smith appeals a guilty plea to one count each of armed robbery and safecracking.Â  The trial court sentenced him to concurrent sentences of ten years on each charge.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 4, 2002, Nathan Smith, Jeremiah Washington, and Ishmael Wilson entered a local gas station armed and wearing masks.Â  Upon entering, Washington forced one of the employees at gunpoint to open the cash register and demanded that she lay on the floor while he emptied its contents. Â \r\nWhile Washington was so occupied, Wilson and Smith went to the rear of the store.Â  There they held another employee at gunpoint and used her to get into the office where they encountered a third employee who was counting the nightâ€™s receipts.Â  They took what money they could find and then forced an employee at gunpoint to open the storeâ€™s safe.Â  After taking all the paper money from the safe, Wilson and Smith ran back to the front of the store where they met up with Washington before fleeing the scene.Â  \r\nDuring the course of the robbery, the employees were able to identify Washington and Wilson.Â  Wilson was identified as a former employee of the store and thus, the authorities were able to obtain his address from employee files.Â  When officers arrived at Wilsonâ€™s home a short time later, all three perpetrators were arrested.Â  A subsequent search of the home produced over $25,000 in cash and a .45 caliber pistol.Â Â  \r\nSmith, Washington, and Wilson were charged with two counts of armed robbery, safecracking, and conspiracy.Â  On October 23, 2003, Smith and Washington appeared before the circuit court to enter guilty pleas.Â  In exchange for pleading guilty to one count of armed robbery and safecracking, the State agreed to dismiss the remaining armed robbery and conspiracy charges.Â  In addition, due to a lack of prior criminal history, the State recommended minimum sentences.Â  \r\n After ensuring the defendants understood their constitutional rights and that their pleas were voluntarily and intelligently given, the trial court, without objection from either defendant, accepted the Stateâ€™s recommendation and gave both the minimum possible sentencesâ€”concurrent terms of ten years on each charge.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Smith argues the trial court erred in accepting his plea to safecracking because the facts of the robbery do not satisfy of the elements of the charge.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is axiomatic, that to preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  See State v. Powers, 331 S.C. 37, 501 S.E.2d 116 (1998) (holding failure to raise constitutional issue at trial precluded its consideration on appeal).Â  As mentioned previously, neither Smith nor his cohort raised any objections to the trial court during the plea proceeding.Â  Furthermore, â€œ[t]he general rule is that guilty pleas, freely and voluntarily entered, act as a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects and defenses, including the claims of a violation of a constitutional right prior to the plea.â€Â  Whetsell v. State, 276 S.C. 295, 297, 277 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1981).\r\nBecause Smith does not claim the trial court lacked jurisdiction, his argument would be more properly raised in an action for post-conviction relief.Â  See e.g., Fossick v. State, 317 S.C. 375, 453 S.E.2d 899 (1995).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.

(ESI) and Ken Kuszmaul alleging breach of contract.Â  After a bench trial, the trial court awarded Ingle $56,471 on the contract and $16,805.76 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  ESI and Kuszmaul appeal.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nESI contracted to build a project for Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer District.Â  This contract required ESI to obtain a payment bond.Â  ESI obtained the bond from Indiana Lumbermenâ€™s Mutual Insurance Co.Â  \r\nKuszmaul, on behalf of ESI, contacted John Ingle about performing subcontract work on the project.Â  Ingle and ESI entered into an oral agreement under which Ingle agreed to construct a pre-engineered building, including laying the foundation and installing yard pipe to the building.Â  \r\nESI, Kuszmaul, and Ingle later disagreed on the amount ESI contracted to pay Ingle for his work.Â  Ingle filed a mechanicâ€™s lien on the sewer districtâ€™s property seeking payment of $56,471 plus costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Ingle then filed a complaint and lis pendens seeking to foreclose on the mechanicâ€™s lien or, in the alternative, seeking payment pursuant to the payment bond.Â  The trial court issued a consent order pursuant to the partiesâ€™ agreement to dismiss the mechanicâ€™s lien and lis pendens, in exchange for the sewer districtâ€™s deposit of approximately $75,000 into escrow pending resolution of the partiesâ€™ dispute.Â  \r\nIngle filed an amended complaint against Kuszmaul, ESI, and Lumbermenâ€™s alleging ESI owed him $56,471 for work performed.Â  Ingle also sought incidental and consequential damages and attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  \r\nESI, Kuszmaul, and Lumbermenâ€™s answered Ingleâ€™s complaint, denying all material allegations and asserting counterclaims including:Â  (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of warranty; (3) negligence; and (4) quantum meruit.Â  Kuszmaul and ESI claimed Ingleâ€™s work contained numerous defects, and was not performed in a timely manner.Â  Kuszmaul and ESI alleged they suffered actual, consequential, and special damages because Ingleâ€™s performance damaged their relationship with the sewer district.Â  In addition, Kuszmaul and ESI claimed damages as a result of performing or hiring other subcontractors to perform work Ingle did not complete.Â  Kuszmaul and ESI also alleged that due to the absence of a statutory or contractual provision permitting the award of attorneyâ€™s fees, Ingle was not entitled to fees.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the parties entered into a contract entitling Ingle to receive $72,000 for his services.Â  The court thus awarded Ingle $56,471, the unpaid balance due under the contract,[2] and $16,805.76 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  In addition, the trial court found for Ingle on all counterclaims and set-offs.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action for breach of contract is an action at law.Â  Sherman v. W &amp; B Enters., Inc., 357 S.C. 243, 247, 592 S.E.2d 307, 309 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, our jurisdiction extends only to the correction of errors of law.Â  Kemp v. Rawlings, 358 S.C. 28, 34, 594 S.E.2d 845, 848 (2004).Â  Therefore, we will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact unless they are wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  Id. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Breach of Contract \r\nESI and Kuszmaul (hereinafter referred to collectively as ESI) argue the trial court erred in finding Ingle did not breach the contract and in finding ESI breached the contract.Â  ESI asserts the parties agreed to a contract price of $47,000, rather than $72,000, and ESI did not breach the contract by failing to pay Ingle the additional $56,471.Â  In addition, ESI claims Ingle failed to perform under the terms of the contract.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe find evidence existed to support the trial courtâ€™s findings of a contract price of $72,000 and ESIâ€™s breach of the contract.Â  The amount due under a contract is for the fact finder.Â  J.J. Lawter Plumbing v. Wen Chow Intâ€™l Trade &amp; Inv., Inc., 286 S.C. 49, 55, 331 S.E.2d 789, 792 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  The failure to make payment as provided in a contract constitutes a substantial breach of the contract.Â  Zemp Constr. Co. v. Harmon Bros. Constr. Co., 225 S.C. 361, 366, 82 S.E.2d 531, 533 (1954).Â  \r\nIngle testified he sent a fax outlining the work he proposed to do on the project.Â  Ingle stated that after he sent the fax, he and Kuszmaul had a conversation concerning the cost of Ingleâ€™s work.Â  Ingle maintained he quoted Kuszmaul a price of $72,000 for the work and Kuszmaul agreed to the price.Â  Kuszmaul admitted he did not pay at least two of the invoices he received from Ingle.Â  There is evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s findings of the contract price and ESIâ€™s breach of contract. \r\nIn addition, we find evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s finding that Ingle did not breach the contract.Â  ESI asserts Ingle breached the contract by failing to complete the work he contracted to perform.Â  One who prevents a condition of a contract cannot rely on the other partyâ€™s resulting nonperformance in an action for breach of contract.Â  Champion v. Whaley, 280 S.C. 116, 120, 311 S.E.2d 404, 406 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Ingle admitted he did not install a base plate in the bottom of the sledge tank and the chlorine chamber, as the parties agreed.Â  However, Ingle asserted he could not perform this task because, although he had repeatedly requested the tank be dewatered, he was never able to enter the chlorine contact chamber due to water in the tank.Â  Ingle testified this task would have taken about two hours.Â  Other than this item, Ingle contends ESI did not perform any other task on his behalf.Â  Thus, we find evidence existed to support the trial courtâ€™s determination that Ingle fulfilled his obligations under the agreement, and therefore did not breach that agreement.Â  \r\nII.Â  Set-Off\r\nESI argues the trial court erred in denying its request to set off amounts owed to Ingle for labor and materials it supplied to complete Ingleâ€™s work and the cost of supplies provided to Ingle.Â  We find no error.\r\nâ€œIn a situation where a plaintiff supposedly owes a defendant monies, but nevertheless brings a suit in contract against the defendant, the proper defense to the action is a counterclaim or a set-off.â€Â  Carolina Mech. Contractors, Inc. v. Yeargin Constr. Co., 261 S.C. 1, 12, 198 S.E.2d 224, 230 (1973).Â  A party claiming a set-off has the burden of establishing the amount of the alleged set-off with reasonable certainty.Â  Diamond Swimming Pool Co. v. Broome, 252 S.C. 379, 386, 166 S.E.2d 308, 312 (1969).Â  \r\nIngle testified that ESI was not required to perform any work on behalf of Ingle except for the installation of the base plate in the chlorine chamber, which Ingle was prevented from completing.Â  In addition, Eric Ingle, Ingleâ€™s son who worked on the project, testified the work performed on the job site by ESI related to ESIâ€™s performance under its contract with the sewer district, and not work Ingle agreed to perform.Â  Thus, we find evidence in the record to support the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny ESIâ€™s claims for set-off.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nESI argues the trial court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Ingle.Â  Specifically, ESI contends this award was not supported by a term of the contract or a statutory provision providing for attorneyâ€™s fees, and thus, the trial court abused its discretion in making the award.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nâ€œGenerally, attorney fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.â€Â  Seckinger v. The Vessel, Excalibur, 326 S.C. 382, 386, 483 S.E.2d 775, 777 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The trial court awarded attorneyâ€™s fees based on the mechanicâ€™s lien Ingle filed.Â  Section 29-5-20 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004), governing mechanicâ€™s liens, allows the trial court, in its discretion, to award the prevailing party reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  However, the parties consented to dismiss the action to foreclose on Ingleâ€™s mechanicâ€™s lien, and the trial court ordered dismissal.Â  Thus, we find no entitlement to attorneyâ€™s fees under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute.\r\nIngle asserts even if attorneyâ€™s fees are not available under the mechanicâ€™s lien statute, sections 29-5-440 and 11-1-120 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004), providing a claimant the right to sue on a payment bond, entitle him to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.Â  These sections are part of the mechanicâ€™s lien statutory scheme and permit a direct action on the payment bond against the bonding company (section 29-5-440) and explain the procedure for such a suit (section 11-1-120).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;11-1-120 (Supp. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-440 (Supp. 2004).Â  â€œA statute allowing attorney fees is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed.â€Â  Belton v. State, 339 S.C. 71, 74, 529 S.E.2d 4, 5 (2000).Â  Sections 29-5-440 and 11-1-120 do not specifically provide for payment of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Therefore, based on our strict construction of these statutes, we decline to read such a provision into the language of the statute.Â  In addition, the payment bond itself does not provide for the payment of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, Ingle cannot recover attorneyâ€™s fees based on his action for payment under the payment bond.Â  \r\nFinally, the parties do not allege their oral agreement authorized the award of attorneyâ€™s fees in the case of litigation pertaining to the contract.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court abused its discretion in awarding Ingle attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART. \r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â Inclusive of change order charges and previous partial payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-394","title":"Dehoney v.

Dehoney, of Bennettsville, for Appellant.\r\n        Kelli Gregg Maddox, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Michael F. Dehoney appeals a circuit court order denying his motion for costs in regard to a civil action he initiated against the South Carolina Department of Corrections (â€œSCDCâ€).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1992, Dehoney was convicted of unlawful use of a vehicle and murder.Â  Dehoney has completed his sentence for unlawful use of a vehicle, but continues to serve a life sentence for murder. \r\nIn October 2001, Dehoney initiated a civil action against SCDC pursuant to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act and 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983.Â  Dehoney alleged SCDC wrongfully recorded in his prison records that he was involved in an escape or escape related event.Â  SCDC removed the action to federal court, but the case was remanded back to state court following a finding that the action was essentially a state law claim.Â  \r\nAt a July 2003 hearing on the matter, Dehoney acknowledged his prison records were currently accurate with respect to his â€œescape screen,â€ but asked the circuit court for an order preventing SCDC from changing it.Â  The Department asserted it had no reason to alter Dehoneyâ€™s escape report unless another escape attempt was made in the future or it later became aware of a past escape event.Â  The circuit court, with Dehoneyâ€™s full approval, ordered his escape report be maintained in the current state for all incidents occurring before July 10, 2003.\r\nDehoney later filed a motion for an award of costs on the basis that, as the prevailing party, he was entitled to recoup his filing and service fees in conjunction with this action.Â  The circuit court denied the motion, holding Dehoney failed to establish a rule of court or statute authorizing costs against the State.Â  Dehoney then filed a very disrespectful motion to reconsider this ruling, which was likewise denied by the circuit court.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI. Award of Costs\r\nAppellant argues the circuit court erred in denying his motion for costs accrued in the underlying civil action because Rule 54(d), SCRCP, entitles him to such.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe applicable portion of Rule 54(d), SCRCP, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  [C]osts shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the Court otherwise directs, but costs against the State, its officers and agencies shall be imposed only to the extent permitted by law. (emphasis added)\r\n\r\nThe plain language of the rule grants the circuit court the authority to award costs to a party, but in no way requires the court to do so.Â  Even if an award of costs against the SCDC is permissible in the present case,[2] it remains within the discretion of the circuit court to deny such an award.\r\nAn appellant court may affirm an order upon any ground appearing in the record on appeal.Â  Rule 220(C), SCACR; see also Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000).Â  Because several of Appellantâ€™s causes of action were withdrawn and the circuit court ruling essentially amounts to nothing more than a court-ordered maintenance of the status quo, we conclude Appellant was not a true prevailing party as contemplated by Rule 54(d), SCRCP.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Appellantâ€™s motion for award of costs.\r\nII. Clarity of Circuit Courtâ€™s Initial Order\r\nAppellant also argues the circuit courtâ€™s order of July 10, 2003, which ordered that SCDC maintain his escape record in its current state for all incidents occurring before the date of the order, is vague, ambiguous, and allows the SCDC to circumvent its intent.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nAs the circuit court announced its ruling, the following exchange took place between Appellant and the circuit court:\r\n\r\n  The Court:Â  And so what I will do is I will issue an order that says as to - - as of this date, July the 10th of 2003, that the [SCDC] offender management system classification review escape/attempt list shall be maintained as to incidents occurring prior to 2003 . . .\r\n  Appellant:Â  Right.\r\n  The Court:Â  - - Prior to July 10, 2003 - -\r\n  Appellant:Â  Exactly.\r\n  The Court:Â  It shall be maintained as it is currently stated - -\r\n  Appellant:Â  Exactly.Â  \r\n\r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s final order contains identical language to that requested by Appellant at the hearing.Â  Appellant made no objection to the agreed upon relief, nor did he file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend this aspect of the order.Â  â€œA contemporaneous objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate review.â€Â  Hawkins v. Pathology Assocs. of Greenville, P.A., 330 S.C. 92, 111, 498 S.E.2d 395, 406 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Accordingly, this issue is not properly before us.Â  Should the SCDC attempt in the future to circumvent the intent of the circuit courtâ€™s order, the proper venue for legal recourse is a rule to show cause in the circuit court, not appellate review of the initial order.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] See Varn v.

Williams, 305 S.C. 116, 406 S.E.2d 357 (1991), we hold there are no directly appealable issues that are arguable on their merits.Â  Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal and grant counselâ€™s petition to be relieved.1\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  Â \r\n\r\n1Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rules 215 and 220(b)(2), SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-396","title":"Davis v.

Wylie, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-396\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2005 â€“ Filed June 15, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Cynthia Bailey Berry, of Orangeburg, for Appellant.\r\n        Thomas E. Elliott, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jimmy Bruce Young appeals the family courtâ€™s order holding him in contempt of a restraining order.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAutumn LaDawn Davis and Young were divorced on May 27, 2003.Â Â Â  In the final divorce decree, the family court ordered: â€œeach of the parties shall be, and [] is hereby, enjoined and restrained from harassing, abusing, bothering, threatening, or interfering with the other party and from entering upon or attempting to enter upon the other partyâ€™s residence or place of employment.â€Â  \r\n In August of 2003, Davis filed a petition in support of the issuance of a rule to show cause requesting that the family court find Young in willful contempt for failure to pay alimony, failure to make automobile and insurance payments, and violation of the mutual restraining order.Â Â Â  Concerning the restraining order, Davis alleged Young had repeatedly driven to her home and walked about her property.Â  Â Â \r\nThe family court issued a rule to show cause, and Young was served.Â  Young responded by, among other things, denying a violation of the restraining order. Â The contempt hearing was held on February 12, 2004.Â  Although Davis raised several issues in her original petition, the only issue adjudicated at the hearing was Youngâ€™s violation of the restraining order.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, Davis presented testimony and police incident reports in support of her claim that Young willfully violated the restraining order.Â  Davis testified that she had seen Young on numerous occasions at varying hours of the day, outside of her mobile home, at her back door, and parked in the mobile home park driveway, both alone and with others.Â  Specifically, Davis stated that Young showed up at her house on June 6, 2003, and tried to get in through the front door.Â  Davis also testified that, on June 9, 2003, Young pulled into her motherâ€™s front yard (next door to Davisâ€™s residence), pointed at Davis, made the shape of a gun with his hand, and then drove away.Â  On June 19, 2003, Young entered the mobile home park and kept watch on her from a car.Â  Another resident of the mobile home park, Emily Finley, corroborated Davisâ€™s testimony.Â  Finley testified she saw Young at the mobile home park on at least two occasions, and particularly remembered seeing Young and his brother sitting in a red truck watching Davisâ€™s mobile home.Â  Â Â \r\nBy a bench order dated February 12, 2004, the family court held Young in willful contempt of the restraining order, sentenced him to three months in jail, suspended upon 30 days service, and ordered Young to pay Davis $1,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Young began serving his sentence immediately following the hearing.Â  On March 3, 2004, the family court issued a formal order in which Youngâ€™s contempt was characterized as â€œcivil.â€Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999). However, a finding of contempt should not be reversed on appeal unless it is without evidentiary support or amounts to an abuse of discretion. Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840, 840 (1988).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn the final written order, the family court referred to Youngâ€™s contempt as â€œcivilâ€ in nature although the sanction, a definite period of incarceration, is indisputably indicative of criminal contempt.Â  No one argues on appeal that the contempt sentence was civil in nature.Â  Because the family courtâ€™s March 3, 2004, order erroneously characterizes the contempt as civil, Young argues this court should reverse the family court.Â  We disagree.\r\nContempt results from the willful disobedience of an order of the court, and before a court may hold a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically demonstrate the acts or conduct upon which such a finding is based.Â  Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 382, 287 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1982).Â  A willful act is â€œone done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€Â  State v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994) (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988)).Â  Civil contempt must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 113, 502 S.E.2d 86, 89 (1998).Â  In a criminal contempt proceeding, the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.Â  The determination of contempt ordinarily resides in the sound discretion of the trial judge. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. at 129, 447 S.E.2d at 217.\r\nThe determining factor in resolving whether contempt is civil or criminal is the purpose for which the power is exercised, including the nature of the relief and the purpose for which the sentence is imposed.Â  Poston, 331 S.C. at 111, 502 S.E.2d at 88.\r\nÂ  â€œThe purpose of civil contempt is â€˜to coerce the defendant to do the thing required by the order for the benefit of the complainant.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Gompers v. Buckâ€™s Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 441 (1911)).Â  The sanctions for civil contempt are conditioned on compliance with the courtâ€™s order.Â  Poston, 331 S.C. at 112, 502 S.E.2d at 89.Â  The conditional nature of the punishment allows the contemnor to discharge himself of the sentence by â€œdoing what he had previously refused to do.â€Â  Id. (quoting Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. 624, 633 (1988)).Â  \r\nâ€œThe primary purposes of criminal contempt are to preserve the courtâ€™s authority and to punish for disobedience of its orders.â€Â  Poston, 331 S.C. at 111, 502 S.E.2d at 88.Â  A penalty for criminal contempt is unconditional and punitive in nature.Â  Id.Â  The contemnor has no power to undo or remedy what has been done and cannot shorten the term by an affirmative act.Â  Id. at 111-12, 502 S.E.2d at 88-89.Â  \r\nHere, the family courtâ€™s sanction was clearly criminal in nature.Â  Young was ordered to serve three months, suspended upon thirty days service, and had no ability to purge himself of the sentence.Â  The judgeâ€™s comments from the benchâ€”and resulting bench orderâ€”establish that the purpose of the contempt sentence was to punish Young for his violation of the restraining order.Â  The family court judge stated: \r\n\r\n  weighing all of the evidence that she [Davis] has presented, including that of her witness, I find that he was in violation of a court order on at least the occasion when the red truck was observed there by the eyewitness who testified . . . and I believe places him there in violation of the court order.Â  \r\n\r\nThat the subsequent order of March 3, 2004, contained language erroneously characterizing the contempt as civil in nature does not change the nature of the contempt itself, which was clearly punitive.[1]Â  \r\nWe are firmly convinced the family court judge applied the correct burden of proofâ€”beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  This is especially so when we consider the judgeâ€™s comments from the bench at the conclusion of the February 12, 2004, hearing.Â  Moreover, our review of the record indicates Davis presented sufficient evidence to support a finding Young was guiltyâ€”beyond a reasonable doubtâ€”of willfully violating the restraining order.Â  Davis testified that she had seen Young on numerous occasions outside of her mobile home, at her back door, and parked in the mobile home park driveway.Â  Her neighbor, Emily Finley, testified she saw Young, who she recognized from a previous meeting, at the mobile home park several times.Â  Finley distinctly recalled seeing Young and his brother sitting in a red truck watching Davisâ€™s mobile home.Â  The family court judge found this evidence credible, and we concur.Â  Although Young denied the general allegations, he admitted his brother owns a red truck.Â  Based on his observation of the witnesses, the family court judge found that the testimony of Davis and Finley was credible, whereas Youngâ€™s testimony that he did not violate the restraining order was not credible.Â  While we acknowledge the erroneous reference to the finding of civil contempt in the March 3, 2004, order, we find no basis for reversal, for Young was not legally prejudiced by this error.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough the family court incorrectly characterized Youngâ€™s contempt as civil in the March 3, 2004, order, we find this mistake does not constitute reversible error.Â  The sanction for the contempt was criminal in nature, and ample evidence exists on the record to support a finding of criminal contempt.Â  Therefore, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] As noted above, neither party to this appeal argues the contempt sentence was actually civil in nature.Â  Indeed, at the time the family court issued its March 3, 2004, written order, Young did not see the need to petition the family court for reconsideration or clarification of the discrepancy he now claims warrants a finding of reversible error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-397","title":"S.C.

Macaulay, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-401\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2005 â€“ Filed June 23, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Byron Putnam Roberts, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        Anthony L. Harbin and Larry A. Welborn, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Service Partners, LLC, and Travelers Indemnity Company appeal the circuit courtâ€™s decision reversing the Workersâ€™ Compensation Appellate Panel (Full Commission) and finding Karen McClure suffered a compensable injury by accident while in the course and scope of her employment with Service Partners.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nAll parties admit the underlying facts in this case are undisputed.Â  On the date of the incident, November 19, 1999, McClure was an employee of Service Partners.Â  She informed her supervisor, Scott Hawkins, she was taking the mail to a drop box.Â  Hawkins asked if he could accompany her to pick up lunch while she was out.Â  Hawkins accompanied McClure even though McClure had not intended to eat lunch.\r\nMcClure drove her personal vehicle on the errand.Â  McClure and Hawkins drove to a mail drop box located in the parking lot of a Sonic Restaurant, which was where Hawkins wanted to get lunch.Â  While waiting to pick up his lunch, Hawkins offered to unload a mirror McClure purchased the night before and still had in her car.Â  \r\nAfter Hawkinsâ€™ suggestion, McClure drove to her home instead of returning to the office.Â  When they arrived at her home, Hawkins unloaded the mirror while McClure remained in the car.Â  McClure and Hawkins then headed back to the office.Â  \r\nDuring the return trip, and prior to reaching the location of the mailbox and Sonic Restaurant, McClureâ€™s vehicle was involved in an accident.Â  McClure suffered multiple injuries during the accident, including injuries to her back, shoulder, left arm, and pelvis.Â  Anderson Orthopaedic Clinic saw McClure for her injuries; however, she failed to indicate that she sustained the injuries in a work-related incident.Â  On the patient questionnaire, McClure did not check that she was injured at work but instead indicated that she was injured in an automobile accident.\r\nIn August 2001, she filed a claim for workersâ€™ compensation benefits, alleging injury to her back, left shoulder, and left arm.Â  The single commissioner found she sustained an injury by accident arising in the course and scope of her employment.Â  The Full Commission reversed this finding in a split decision.Â  The Full Commission found the accident did not â€œarise out of her employment nor was it in the course and scope of her employment.â€Â  Additionally, the majority found the errand was â€œmore than a slight deviation,â€ and McClure was no longer on a dual-purpose mission when she took the mirror to her home.Â  Finally, the Full Commission determined the errand was of no benefit to Service Partners and denied McClureâ€™s claim for benefits.\r\nMcClure appealed to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court found where all facts are undisputed, the determinations to be made by the court are questions of law and not of fact.Â  The court found McClure was in the care and control of her employer throughout the errand, was on a dual-purpose trip, and made â€œat worst, a slight deviation.â€Â  The court reversed the decision of the Full Commission and reinstated the order of the single commissioner.Â  Â Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  â€œIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.â€Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  â€œThe final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Full Commission.â€Â  Id.\r\n In an appeal from the Full Commission, this court, as well as the circuit court, may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2004).Â  The appellate court can reverse or modify the Full Commissionâ€™s decision only if the claimantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Id.\r\n&quot;The question of whether an accident arises out of and is in the course and scope of employment is largely a question of fact for the Appellate Panel.Â  However, where, as here, the facts are undisputed, the question of whether an accident is compensable is a question of law.&quot;Â  Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 517, 526 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 2000)(citations omitted).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nService Partners contends the circuit court erred in reversing the decision of the Full Commission.Â  Service Partners asserts the circuit court erred in finding McClureâ€™s injury was compensable:Â  (1) because she was in the â€œcare and controlâ€ of her employer; (2) under the dual-purpose doctrine; and (3) because the trip to her house was only a slight deviation.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Circuit Courtâ€™s Standard of Review\r\nService Partners first argues the decision of the circuit court should be reversed because it applied an incorrect standard of review.Â  Service Partners maintains the circuit court improperly substituted its own findings of fact for those of the Full Commission.Â  However, as stated above, when there are undisputed facts, the determination of whether an injury by accident is compensable becomes a question of law for the court to determine and not one of fact.Â  Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at 729.Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, Service Partners failed to contest the standard of review employed by the circuit court in a motion to reconsider pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  Therefore, the issue is not preserved for review on appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Care and Control\r\nService Partners contends the circuit court erred in finding McClure suffered a compensable injury by accident that arose in the course and scope of her employment.Â  Service Partners asserts it was error for the court to find the accident was compensable because McClure was in the â€œcare and controlâ€ of her employer at the time.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo be compensable under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, an injury by accident must both â€œarise out ofâ€ and be â€œin the course ofâ€ employment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2004).Â  The claimant has the burden of proving facts that will bring the injury within the Workersâ€™ Compensation law.Â  Clade v. Champion Labs., 330 S.C. 8, 11, 496 S.E.2d 856, 857 (1998).Â  Additionally, â€œworkersâ€™ compensation statutes are construed liberally in favor of coverage.â€Â  Peay v. U.S. Silica Co., 313 S.C. 91, 94, 437 S.E.2d 64, 65 (1993).Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œâ€˜Arising out ofâ€™ refers to the injuryâ€™s origin and cause . . . . For an injury to â€˜arise out ofâ€™ employment, the injury must be proximately caused by the employment.Â  The injury arises out of employment when there is a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.â€Â  Osteen v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 333 S.C. 43, 50, 508 S.E.2d 21, 24-25 (1998) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nIn Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999), this court stated:\r\n\r\n  The phrase â€œin the course of the employmentâ€ refers to the time, place, and circumstances under which the accident occurred.Â  An injury occurs â€œin the course ofâ€ employment within the meaning of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act when it occurs within the period of employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be in the performance of his [or her] duties and while fulfilling those duties or engaged in something incidental thereto.\r\n\r\nId. at 498, 520 S.E.2d at 639 (citations omitted).\r\nAs a general rule, employees going to or coming from the place where their work is to be performed is not engaged in performing any service growing out of or incidental to their employment, and therefore, an injury sustained by accident at such time does not arise out of and in the course of their employment.Â  Aughtry v. Abbeville County Sch. Dist. No. 60, 332 S.C. 453, 458-59, 504 S.E.2d 830, 833 (Ct. App. 1998), revâ€™d on other grounds by, 340 S.C. 604, 533 S.E.2d 885 (2000).Â  \r\n\r\n  However, South Carolina has recognized a number of exceptions to this rule.Â  Among these are: (1) Where, in going to and returning from work, the means of transportation is provided by the employer, or the time that is consumed is paid for or included in the wages; (2) Where the employee, on his way to or from his work, is still charged with some duty or task in connection with his employment . . . .\r\n\r\nMedlin v. Upstate Plaster Serv., 329 S.C. 92, 95, 495 S.E.2d 447, 449 (1998).\r\n In Sexton v. Freeman Gas Co., 258 S.C. 15, 187 S.E.2d 128 (1972), our supreme court considered facts analogous to those in the instant case.Â  In Sexton, the claimant left work driving a company vehicle, which contained a two-way radio on which he could be summoned to perform company business at any time.Â  While he left for a personal errand to get his haircut, the court found â€œhe was continuously subject to his employerâ€™s control.â€Â  Sexton, 258 S.C. at 18, 187 S.E.2d at 129.Â  Additionally, the court found â€œhis fixed salary impliedly compensated him for the time so spent; and the use of his employerâ€™s vehicle in such a manner was an incident of the employment contract and in the interest of his employer.â€Â  Id.Â  The court found his death was compensable in the course of his employment when he left the scene of a brushfire and was returning to the office.Â  Id. at 19, 187 S.E.2d at 129-30.\r\nIn the case sub judice, McClure left the office not for her lunch break, but rather with the specific intention to drop off the companyâ€™s mail.Â  This is admittedly one of her duties for Service Partners.Â  Additionally, Service Partners paid McClure a fixed salary for the performance of those duties and periodically reimbursed her for a tank of gas. Â McClureâ€™s supervisor chose to accompany McClure on this business-related errand.Â  As McClureâ€™s supervisor, he testified he could have directed her at any time to alter her trip to conduct company business.Â  We note, however, that the supervisorâ€™s mere presence in McClureâ€™s car is not the dispositive factor.Â  If that were the case, any time a supervisor drove with an employee would potentially permit compensation for injuries an employee sustained in an automobile accident.Â  For example, an automobile accident that occurred during the travel to and from a purely social lunch involving a supervisor and his or her employees could be compensable.Â  Our decision in no way should be construed this broadly.Â  \r\nUnder the specific facts of this case, we find McClure was under the care and control of her supervisor at the time of the accident because the trip was initiated for the sole purpose of a business-related errand.Â  McClure specifically testified that she did not intend to go out for lunch that day and only left the office for the purpose of dropping off the companyâ€™s mail.Â  Because McClure was not on her lunch break, but instead was conducting company business she could have been directed by her supervisor to perform some business duty or task while returning to work.Â  Finally, as in Sexton, she was paid a fixed salary, which included the time for delivering the mail and returning to her office.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court properly determined her injury was the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of her employment so as to be compensable under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Dual-Purpose Trip\r\nService Partners contends the circuit court erred in finding the injury was compensable under the dual-purpose rule.Â  We disagree and find the dual-purpose rule an additional reason for sustaining the conclusions of the circuit court.\r\nThe dual-purpose rule in South Carolina explains:\r\n\r\n  [W]hen a trip serves both business and personal purposes, it is a personal trip if the trip would have been made in spite of the failure or absence of the business purpose and would have been dropped in the event of failure of the private purpose, though the business errand remained undone;Â  it is a business trip if a trip of this kind would have been made in spite of the failure or absence of the private purpose, because the service to be performed for the employer would have caused the journey to be made by someone even if it had not coincided with the employeeâ€™s personal journey.\r\n\r\nDiMaria v. Multimedia, Inc., 308 S.C. 387, 389, 418 S.E.2d 324, 324-25 (Ct. App. 1992) (quoting 1 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 18.12 (1990)).Â  â€œStated another way, if the work of the employee necessitates his travel, he is in the course of employment, even though he is serving at the same time some purpose of his own.Â  The service to the employer must be at least a concurrent cause of the trip, but not necessarily the sole cause.â€Â  Stough v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 311 S.C. 129, 130-31, 427 S.E.2d 716, 717 (Ct. App. 1993). \r\nMcClureâ€™s trip had both a personal purpose and a business purpose.Â  However, her main intention in leaving was to take the companyâ€™s mail to a drop box.Â  This was one of her routine duties and she was taking the mail in furtherance of her employerâ€™s business.Â  The trip to unload her mirror was not planned until after the departure on the business trip.Â  Additionally, it is clear the personal trip would not have been made were it not for the necessity of the business trip coupled with the control exercised by her supervisor, who was in the car at all times.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court did not err in finding the trip was a dual-purpose trip in which the primary reason was business related.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Slight Deviation\r\nService Partners maintains the circuit court erred in finding the trip to her home was only a slight deviation, thus allowing coverage.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 526 S.E.2d 725 (Ct. App. 2000), this court looked to Professor Arthur Larson for explanation of a slight deviation:\r\n\r\n  An identifiable deviation from a business trip for personal reasons takes the employee out of the course of employment until the employee returns to the route of the business trip, unless the deviation is so small as to be disregarded as insubstantial.Â Â  In some jurisdictions, the course of employment is deemed resumed if, having completed the personal errand but without having regained the main business route, the employee at the time of the accident was proceeding in the direction of the business destination.Â  If the main trip is personal, a business detour retains its business character throughout the detour.\r\n\r\nGibson, 338 S.C. at 522, 526 S.E.2d at 731 (quoting 1 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§Â§ 17.01 to 17.06 (Introductory Scope) (1999)) (second emphasis added).Â  This court continued:\r\n\r\n  Courts now generally recognize that â€œhuman beings do not run on tracks like trolley cars,â€ and therefore uphold awards in situations like the following:\r\n  getting cigarettes during a trip to or from work in the employerâ€™s conveyance; running across the street in the course of a delivery trip to buy a little food; driving a daughter to school, dropping oneâ€™s wife off at church, leaving a message with oneâ€™s sister about working late, picking up mail for vacationing friends, crossing the street during a beer break to retrieve oneâ€™s lunch, stopping at home to get a raincoat and leave some meat; crossing the road during a delivery trip to have a glass of beer at 2:00 in the afternoon; or to get a newspaper; making a personal phone call; looking for a ring; picking up two young ladies and taking them home while driving a car to test its brakes; buying a toy during spare time to take home to a child; and even picking cherries from a customerâ€™s cherry tree.\r\n\r\nId. (quoting 1 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Workersâ€™ Compensation Law Â§ 17.06[3], at 17-38 to 17-40 (1999) (footnotes omitted)).\r\nWe find the circuit court properly found the detour taken by McClure at the suggestion of her supervisor was only a slight deviation from the purpose of her trip.Â  We recognize the detour took her several miles away from the main business route of the trip.Â  However, McClure was heading in the direction of her office and was again available for her supervisor to command her to perform a business-related task.Â  We believe, given the specific facts of this case, compensation should be allowed.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find McClure was under the â€œcare and controlâ€ of her supervisor at the time of the accident, paid a fixed salary, and had performed a duty required of her employment.Â  Accordingly, as in Sexton, we find the accident arose out of and in the course of her employment. Â Additionally, we find the dual-purpose rule provides additional support for the finding, as the main purpose of her trip was to perform her duties on behalf of Service Partners.Â  Finally, we conclude the circuit court correctly found her deviation for personal business was only a slight deviation, and she had resumed the return trip to her office while under the control of her supervisor.Â  Accordingly, we hold the decision of the circuit court finding her injury compensable is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-402","title":"State v.

The contract was\r\nfor three years and provided for an automatic renewal unless 60 days prior\r\nwritten notice was given.&nbsp; It further provided that if either party failed\r\nto perform under the agreement, the other party could give written notice of the\r\nbreach, which, if not corrected within 60 days, would entitle the injured party\r\nto cancel the contract upon an additional 60-day notice.&nbsp; On April 15,\r\n1999, the contract automatically renewed itself for an additional three-year\r\nterm.&nbsp;\r\nIn June 1999, Brent Cromer, Cromerâ€™s\r\nvice president, approached Compact Air to discuss the possibility that Cromer\r\nwould provide vending services at Compact Airâ€™s facility.&nbsp; On July 26,\r\n1999, Cromer and Compact Air signed an agreement under which Cromer would\r\nprovide vending services to Compact Air beginning October 1, 1999.&nbsp;\r\nCromer drafted a document, which\r\nCromer and Compact Air later signed, and styled it as a â€œproposal/agreement.â€&nbsp;\r\nIt listed the type of food and drinks to be stocked, specified when the machines\r\nwould be serviced and restocked, and required that Cromer pay weekly commissions\r\nto Compact Air of at least ten per cent.[1]&nbsp;\r\nThe agreement also contained the\r\nfollowing language:&nbsp;\r\nRESERVATIONS\r\n\r\n  Cromer Food Services, Inc.\r\n  expressly reserves the right to refuse any offer on the part of Compact Air\r\n  unless the aforementioned proposal is accepted in its entirety, with no other\r\n  vending machines of a similar description being permitted on the premises of Compact\r\n  Air as to be in competition with the machines of Cromer Food Services,\r\n  Inc.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;(Boldface in\r\noriginal.)&nbsp; Compact Air attempted to end its existing arrangement with\r\nAtlas; however, a few days before Cromerâ€™s scheduled installation, Atlasâ€™s\r\npresident advised Compact Air by letter that Atlas would not agree to the\r\ntermination.\r\nOn September 30, 1999, the day\r\nbefore Cromer was to place its machines at Compact Air, Angela Radford, Compact\r\nAirâ€™s purchasing agent, called Brent Cromer requesting that Cromer delay the\r\ninstallation.&nbsp; She also assured him that â€œthey would get it worked outâ€\r\nso that Cromer could install its machines.&nbsp; Cromer agreed to wait for the\r\nnew installation date and kept its equipment warehoused in anticipation of that\r\noccasion.&nbsp; In January 2000, however, Compact Airâ€™s plant manager informed\r\nCromer that Compact Air had elected to stay with Atlas.&nbsp;\r\nCromer subsequently filed suit\r\nagainst Compact Air alleging causes of action for breach of contract, quantum\r\nmeruit, and promissory estoppel.&nbsp; The trial judge found in favor of Compact\r\nAir on all Cromerâ€™s causes of action.&nbsp; After Cromer unsuccessfully moved\r\nto alter or amend the judgment, it filed this appeal.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.&nbsp; The trial judge dismissed\r\nCromerâ€™s breach of contract action finding (1) a condition precedent had not\r\nbeen met, (2) there was no meeting of the minds, and (3) Cromer failed to prove\r\nits damages with reasonable certainty.&nbsp; On appeal, Cromer challenges all\r\nthree findings.&nbsp; We, however, hold that, notwithstanding Cromerâ€™s\r\narguments, the record supports the trial judgeâ€™s determination that Cromer was\r\nnot entitled to recover for breach of contract.[2]\r\nIn the appealed order, the trial\r\njudge found as follows:&nbsp; â€œThere was no evidence presented to the Court\r\nthat Compact Air prohibited Cromer from installing its equipment.&nbsp; Rather,\r\nit is quite clear that when Compact Air could not terminate its contract with\r\nAtlas and give Cromer exclusive vending rights, Cromer elected not to begin\r\noperations at Compact Air.â€&nbsp; There is evidence in the record to support\r\nthese findings.&nbsp; On cross-examination, Brent Cromer admitted he would not\r\nput equipment at the site as long as Atlasâ€™s machines were there because such\r\nan arrangement would not have been profitable.&nbsp; Furthermore, when Compact\r\nAir advised Cromer in January 2000 that it decided to honor its contract with\r\nAtlas, Cromer offered only to wait until the Atlas contract had â€œexpiredâ€\r\nand to take over the vending services after that time.&nbsp; Cromer never\r\ninsisted on placing its machines at Compact Airâ€™s facility while Atlasâ€™s\r\nmachines were still on the premises.\r\nMoreover, the agreement at hand did\r\nnot give Cromer exclusive vending rights at Compact Airâ€™s facility.[3]&nbsp; The above-quoted clause was\r\nonly a reservation of rights under which Cromer could â€œrefuse any offerâ€\r\nfrom Compact Air if Compact Air permitted a competitorâ€™s vending machines on\r\nits premises.&nbsp; Cromerâ€™s decision not to place its machines on Compact Airâ€™s\r\npremises in such a situation, then, was nothing more than exercise of its rights\r\nunder the reservation clause and did not give rise to an action for\r\nbreach.&nbsp;\r\n2.&nbsp; Cromer appeals the trial\r\njudgeâ€™s decision to direct a verdict on its cause of action for quantum meruit.&nbsp;\r\nWe find no error.&nbsp; Contrary to what Cromer argues in its brief, the\r\nevidence at trial supports only a finding that Atlasâ€™s performance improved\r\nafter October 1999; there was no evidence that this improvement would not have\r\noccurred if Compact Air had not entered into the agreement with Cromer.[4]&nbsp; Furthermore, the allegations\r\nin Cromerâ€™s pleadings supporting its claim for quantum meruit are virtually\r\nidentical to those supporting its claim for breach of contract.[5]\r\n3.&nbsp; On appeal, Cromer argues it\r\nrelied on Compact Airâ€™s promise to terminate the existing arrangement with\r\nAtlas so that Cromer could install its machines on October 1, 1999.&nbsp; It\r\nfurther contends that, after it was notified of the existing contract between\r\nCompact Air and Atlas, it warehoused its machines with the understanding that\r\nthe delay was only temporary.&nbsp; We reject these arguments.\r\nAlthough Brent Cromer testified that\r\nvending services providers do not have contracts everywhere they do business, he\r\nacknowledged he knew that Atlas used contracts with some of its customers.&nbsp;\r\nIt further appears undisputed that he was aware when negotiating with Compact\r\nAir that Atlas was its vending services provider.&nbsp; Moreover, there was\r\nevidence that he was informed of Atlasâ€™s contract with Compact Air the day\r\nbefore Cromer was initially to begin installing its machines.&nbsp; Cromer,\r\nthen, was aware of the possibility that Compact Air had a contract with Atlas\r\nand could have easily determined whether or not Compact Air was in a position to\r\nchange its vending machine arrangements.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, we\r\nhold that Cromer could not have reasonably relied on any alleged promises by\r\nCompact Air to terminate its contract with Atlas.[6]&nbsp; We therefore affirm the directed verdict on\r\nCromerâ€™s cause of action for promissory estoppel.&nbsp;\r\n4.&nbsp; Because we affirm the\r\ndirected verdicts on Cromerâ€™s claims for quantum meruit and promissory\r\nestoppel and the dismissal of its breach of contract claim, we do not address\r\nthe issue of whether Cromer proved its damages with reasonable certainty.[7]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;

Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Edward\r\nBennett, as personal representative of the Estate of Isaiah Bennett appeals the\r\ntrial courtâ€™s ruling that the Estate was not entitled to property titled in\r\nClement J. Vanderhorstâ€™s name by way of a resulting trust or adverse\r\npossession.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1967, Isaiah Bennett and\r\nhis wife purchased the property located at 35 Race Street, Charleston, South\r\nCarolina.&nbsp; A year later, Isaiahâ€™s wife died.&nbsp; Though Isaiahâ€™s wife\r\ndied intestate, leaving a portion of her ownership interest in the property to\r\nArthur Grant, her son from a prior relationship, Grant conveyed all his right,\r\ntitle, and interest in the property to Isaiah.&nbsp;\r\nIsaiah deeded the property to his\r\nnephew Reginald Johnson in June of 1975.&nbsp; Reginald had lived with Isaiah\r\nsince his mother had passed away in 1971 when Reginald was 17 years old.&nbsp;\r\nWhile he was in college, Reginald considered the Race\r\nStreet property his home and returned to the property to live for a year after\r\nhis college graduation.&nbsp; In 1976 Reginald moved to New\r\nJersey.&nbsp; Reginald was unaware of the deed until after Isaiahâ€™s\r\ndeath.&nbsp;\r\nVanderhorst, another nephew of\r\nIsaiah, moved into 35 Race Street\r\nin the summer of 1976 and disputedly resided there until he married in 1984. The Race\r\nStreet house was where relatives visiting Charleston\r\nwould stay.&nbsp; Several family members and Rosetta Simmons, who was declared\r\nby the probate court to be Isaiahâ€™s common law wife, testified that they did\r\nnot recall Vanderhorst residing at the property.&nbsp; However, Vanderhorst\r\nclaims he would stay with his mother in McClellanville when family\r\nvisited.&nbsp; One of Isaiahâ€™s nephews testified that even Isaiah would not\r\nstay at the house during holidays because it was full of visiting\r\nrelatives.&nbsp;\r\nA foreclosure action against the\r\nproperty was brought in August of 1979.&nbsp; Notice of foreclosure against\r\nReginald was served upon â€œhis roommate (sic), Clement Vanderhorst, a person of\r\nsound discretion living at the residence,â€ though Vanderhorst denied receiving\r\nthe documents.&nbsp; Robin Jackson purchased the property at the foreclosure\r\nsale.\r\nUpon learning of the foreclosure\r\nsale, Isaiah arranged for the repurchase of the property from Jackson\r\nfor $20,000.&nbsp; The title to the property was placed in Vanderhorstâ€™s\r\nname.&nbsp; Vanderhorst attended the closing with Isaiah and executed a mortgage\r\nand note for $21,500.&nbsp; Vanderhorst also took out insurance on the property\r\nand deducted the mortgage interest from his tax returns from 1979 until the\r\npresent.&nbsp; In 1994, Vanderhorst, with Isaiahâ€™s knowledge, refinanced the\r\nproperty, with the payout of $2,000 going into a joint bank account in\r\nVanderhorst and Isaiahâ€™s names.&nbsp; Isaiah continued to make the mortgage\r\npayments, repairs and improvements to the home and live on the property.&nbsp;\r\nVanderhorst did not make any payments during Isaiahâ€™s life.&nbsp;\r\nFollowing Isaiahâ€™s death, Edward\r\nBennett, as personal representative for his brotherâ€™s estate, brought an\r\naction to obtain title from Vanderhorst under theories of accommodation and\r\nadverse possession.&nbsp; With approval of the trial court, the Estate later\r\namended its complaint to include a claim for a resulting trust.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court held that as\r\nVanderhorst was â€œthe natural object of Isaiah Bennettâ€™s bounty,â€ the\r\ninference was created that Isaiah intended a gift, and the Estate thus had the\r\nburden of proving a gift was not Isaiahâ€™s intent.&nbsp; The trial court\r\ndetermined the Estate did not meet its burden, and â€œIsaiah Bennett intended a\r\ngift or advancement to his nephew Clement [Vanderhorst] of the property upon his\r\ndeath.â€&nbsp; Furthermore, the court held the evidence would rebut the\r\npresumption of a resulting trust.&nbsp; In addition, the trial court held the\r\nEstateâ€™s claim for adverse possession failed.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court denied the Estateâ€™s\r\npost-trial motions.&nbsp; This appeal followed.&nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhether an action is one at law or\r\nin equity is determined by the nature of the pleadings and the character of the\r\nrelief sought.&nbsp; In re Estate of Holden, 343 S.C. 267, 278, 539\r\nS.E.2d 703, 709 (2000).&nbsp; The appellate court will apply the appropriate\r\nstandard of review for a particular issue in a case that contains both legal and\r\nequitable issues.&nbsp; Eldridge v. City of Greenwood,\r\n331 S.C. 398, 417, 503 S.E.2d 191, 200 (Ct. App. 1998).&nbsp;\r\nAn action to determine a resulting\r\ntrust sounds in equity.&nbsp; Jocoy v. Jocoy, 349 S.C. 441, 444, 562\r\nS.E.2d 674, 675 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; As such, we may determine facts in\r\naccordance with our view of the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp; Townes\r\nAssocs., Ltd. v.

Bowen, 352 S.C. 494,\r\n499, 575 S.E.2d 553, 556 (2003).&nbsp; As a general rule, when real estate is\r\nconveyed to one person and the consideration paid by another, it is presumed\r\nthat the party who pays the purchase money intended a benefit to himself, and\r\naccordingly a resulting trust is raised in his behalf.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the presumption may be rebutted and the actual intention shown by parol\r\nevidence.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nIn contrast, when the conveyance is\r\nmade to a spouse or child, or to any other person for whom the purchaser is\r\nunder legal obligation to provide, no such presumption arises.&nbsp; Bowen,\r\n352 S.C. at 499, 575 S.E.2d at 556.&nbsp; In that case, the presumption is that\r\nthe purchase was designated as a gift or advancement to the person to whom the\r\nconveyance is made.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nThis presumption may also be rebutted by parol evidence or circumstances showing\r\na contrary intention.&nbsp; Id.\r\nWe find that even if Vanderhorst was\r\nnot the natural object of his uncleâ€™s bounty and the presumption of resulting\r\ntrust applies, Vanderhorst successfully rebutted this presumption.&nbsp;\r\nIn Larisey v. Larisey, 93\r\nS.C. 450, 77 S.E. 129 (1913), an uncle purchased property in the nephewâ€™s\r\nname, but he then took and held possession of the property, made improvements,\r\nand paid all of the taxes.&nbsp; At the time of the purchase, the uncle was a\r\nbachelor and did not intend to marry.&nbsp; The uncle expressed his intention\r\nabout giving the property to his nephew to a witness at the signing of the\r\ndeed.&nbsp; He also reiterated the intended gift in a letter introduced at\r\ntrial.&nbsp; The supreme court found the uncle intended a gift of the property\r\nto his nephew, rebutting the presumption of a resulting trust.&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;at\r\n452-53, 77 S.E. at 129-30.&nbsp;\r\nThe facts in the present case are\r\nsimilar to those in Larisey.&nbsp; Like the uncle in Larisey, Isaiah was also\r\nunmarried at the time he purchased the property in Vanderhorstâ€™s name.&nbsp;\r\nIsaiah had previously attempted to gift a favored nephew with the property by\r\ndeeding the property to Reginald.&nbsp; At the time of the foreclosure and\r\nreaquisition of the property in Vanderhorstâ€™s name, Vanderhorst had been\r\nliving with his uncle for three years while Reginald was living in New\r\nJersey.&nbsp; Furthermore, like the uncle in Larisey, Isaiah also spoke of his\r\nintent.&nbsp; John Jones, former neighbor, specifically recalled Isaiah telling\r\nhim that upon Isaiahâ€™s death, the house would belong to Vanderhorst.&nbsp; In\r\naddition, Mildred Bennett, Isaiahâ€™s sister-in-law, testified Vanderhorst told\r\nher that Isaiah â€œtold him that the house was going to him.â€&nbsp;\r\nBased on the evidence stated above,\r\nwe affirm the holding of the trial court that Isaiah intended a gift of the\r\nproperty at 35 Race Street to his nephew Vanderhorst.&nbsp;\r\nAdverse Possession\r\nThe Estate argues the trial court\r\nerred in failing to find Isaiah acquired the property by adverse\r\npossession.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\nAdverse possession may be\r\nestablished under a ten-year statute of limitation.&nbsp; See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 15-3-340 (2005).&nbsp; To constitute adverse possession, which results\r\nin obtaining title to the disputed property, the possession must be continuous,\r\nhostile, open, actual, notorious, and exclusive for the requisite period.&nbsp; Getsinger\r\nv. Midlands Orthopaedic Profit Sharing Plan, 327 S.C. 424, 430, 489 S.E.2d\r\n223, 226 (Ct. App. 1997).&nbsp; The claimantâ€™s possession must be hostile to\r\nnot only the true owner, but also to the rest of the world so as to indicate his\r\nexclusive ownership of the property.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The burden of proof\r\nof establishing adverse possession is upon the party asserting such a\r\nclaim.&nbsp; Id. at 428 489 S.E.2d at 225.&nbsp; The party asserting a\r\nclaim of adverse possession must establish the claim by clear and convincing\r\nevidence.&nbsp; Id. at 429, 489 S.E.2d at 225.&nbsp;\r\nIsaiah did not exercise all the acts\r\nof ownership over the property as if he were the sole owner.&nbsp; Though Isaiah\r\npaid for, maintained, and lived on the property until his death, he titled the\r\nproperty in Vanderhorstâ€™s name.&nbsp; He also informed Jones and Vanderhorst\r\nof his intentions to gift the property to his nephew.&nbsp; In addition, Isaiah\r\nallowed Vanderhorst to seek the tax deductions for the mortgage interest on the\r\nproperty and did not object when Vanderhorst refinanced the property.&nbsp;\r\nFinally, although evidence of Vanderhorstâ€™s improvements on the property is\r\nminimal, he cut the grass, cleaned the house, and installed handicap handrails\r\nin the shower.&nbsp; Therefore, we find the Estate failed to provide clear and\r\nconvincing evidence that Isaiah acted in open, notorious, hostile, continuous,\r\nand exclusive possession of the property.&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the\r\ntrial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-413","title":"Ballentine v.

Ballentine (Wife) on\r\nFebruary 20, 2001.&nbsp; Husband appeals a family court order that found the\r\npartiesâ€™ Separation Agreement, which was incorporated into the final divorce\r\ndecree, was ambiguous.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband was granted a divorce on\r\nFebruary 20, 2001.&nbsp; The Final Decree incorporated the partiesâ€™ Separation\r\nAgreement, which, among other things, provides for a division of personal\r\nproperty and financial accounts.&nbsp; The Agreement states:\r\n\r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal\r\n  Property and Financial Accounts\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  . . . .\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The SARSEP account, Husbandâ€™s IRA, Husbandâ€™s 401k, Wifeâ€™s 401k, and Wifeâ€™s\r\n  IRA will be divided as set forth in Exhibit A.\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The purpose of Exhibit A is to illustrate the apportionment of the property\r\n  listed and to show the adjustment that has to be made in order to achieve the\r\n  fifty-eight (58%) percent/forty-two (42%) percent distribution.&nbsp; The\r\n  adjustment itself is to be drawn from the Wifeâ€™s 401k by way of a Qualified\r\n  Domestic Relations Order (QDRO).&nbsp; The parties agree to request that this\r\n  Court retain jurisdiction for the purpose of any supplemental orders which may\r\n  be necessary.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nExhibit A is a schedule of the\r\npartiesâ€™ assets, the net value of which is listed as $1,306,537.&nbsp; As\r\nnoted on Exhibit A, the assets were allocated in such a way that Husbandâ€™s\r\nshare was $548,746 and Wifeâ€™s share was $757,791.&nbsp; In order to achieve\r\nthe desired 58%/42% distribution, a $128,187 adjustment was to be paid to\r\nHusband, the adjustment â€œto be drawn from wifeâ€™s 401k plan.â€&nbsp;\r\nOn January 8, 2002, the family court\r\nentered a QDRO directing Wifeâ€™s employer, BellSouth, to disburse to Husband\r\nhis share of Wifeâ€™s 401(k).&nbsp; BellSouth received the QDRO, but informed\r\nHusbandâ€™s counsel by a letter dated March 12, 2002, that it did not meet\r\nrequirements of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp; Specifically,\r\nBellSouth instructed: â€œThe Order should be amended to address the issue of\r\nwhether or not the Alternate Payeeâ€™s benefits will be credited with gains and\r\nlosses accumulated between the assignment date and the date of distribution.â€&nbsp;\r\nHusbandâ€™s counsel forwarded the BellSouth letter to Wifeâ€™s counsel, along\r\nwith a request that Wife secure an amended QDRO addressing the concerns raised\r\nby BellSouth.&nbsp; The family court entered an Amended QDRO on May 15,\r\n2002.&nbsp; Paragraph five of the Amended QDRO provides:\r\n\r\n  The BELLSOUTH RETIREMENT\r\n  SAVINGS PLAN 401(k) is directed to pay, to the Alternate Payee, ONE\r\n  HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND, ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN AND NO/100\r\n  ($128,187.00) of the account balances credited to the Plan Participant as of\r\n  February 20, 2001, to include gains or losses on this amount.\r\n\r\nBellSouth received the Amended QDRO\r\nin June of 2002, and on August 14, 2002, BellSouth notified the parties the\r\norder had been approved.&nbsp; Husband was issued a check for $87,138.99 on\r\nSeptember 25, 2002.&nbsp; This amount constitutes the $128,187 adjustment, minus\r\nlosses incurred by the plan between February 20, 2001 and the date of\r\ndistribution.\r\nOn November 26, 2003, over a year\r\nafter receiving the check from BellSouth, Husband requested that Wife consent to\r\na third QDRO which would provide that Husbandâ€™s adjustment of $128,187 would\r\nnot reflect gains or losses accumulated between February 20, 2001 and the date\r\nof distribution.&nbsp; Wife declined Husbandâ€™s request.&nbsp;\r\nConsequently, on January 28, 2004,\r\nHusband filed a Motion for Rule to Show Cause alleging Wife was in contempt for\r\nfailing to consent to the third QDRO.&nbsp; After a hearing, the family court\r\nissued an order dismissing Husbandâ€™s Rule to Show Cause.&nbsp; The court found\r\nthe Separation Agreement was ambiguous as to whether Husbandâ€™s adjustment was\r\nsubject to gain and loss fluctuations between the entry of divorce and\r\nsettlement of the account.&nbsp; The family court noted that â€œ[n]either the\r\nSettlement Agreement nor the QDRO guaranteed the Plaintiff a minimum amount of\r\n$128,187 payable from Defendantâ€™s BellSouth 401(k).&nbsp; To the contrary, the\r\nwhole point of both was to effectuate the 58%/42% division of the marital\r\nproperty, as it was valued on February 20, 2001.â€&nbsp; Reading the Amended\r\nQDRO along with the Final Decree, the court determined the parties intended\r\nHusband to receive $128,187, plus any gains or minus any losses.&nbsp; Husband\r\nappeals this order dismissing his Rule to Show Cause.&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe pertinent provision giving Husband the adjustment from Wifeâ€™s BellSouth\r\n401(k) is found in the Final Decree.&nbsp; However, the decree incorporated the\r\nSeparation Agreement, which was entered into by the consent of the\r\nparties.&nbsp; Thus, as in Bogan v. Bogan, 298 S.C. 139, 142, 378 S.E.2d\r\n606, 608 (Ct. App. 1989), â€œwe are essentially dealing with an agreement\r\nbetween the parties.â€&nbsp;\r\nWhere an agreement is clear and\r\ncapable of legal interpretation, the courtâ€™s only function is to interpret its\r\nlawful meaning, discover the intention of the parties as found within the\r\nagreement, and give effect to it.&nbsp; Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 543\r\nS.E.2d 224 (Ct. App. 2001).&nbsp; â€œThe court must enforce an unambiguous\r\ncontract according to its terms, regardless of the contractâ€™s wisdom or folly,\r\nor the partiesâ€™ failure to guard their rights carefully.â€&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 158, 543 S.E.2d at 230.&nbsp; If a contractâ€™s language is plain,\r\nunambiguous, and capable of only one reasonable interpretation, no construction\r\nis required, and the contractâ€™s language determines the instrumentâ€™s force\r\nand effect.&nbsp; Jordan v. Security Group, Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 428\r\nS.E.2d 705 (1993).\r\nWhen an agreement is ambiguous, the\r\ncourt should seek to determine the intent of the parties.&nbsp; Ebert v.\r\nEbert, 320 S.C. 331, 465 S.E.2d 121 (Ct. App. 1995).&nbsp; â€œA contract is\r\nambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning or when its meaning is\r\nunclear.â€&nbsp; Smith-Cooper v. Cooper, 344 S.C. 289, 295, 543 S.E.2d\r\n271, 274 (Ct. App. 2001).&nbsp;\r\nWe agree with the family court that\r\nthe Separation Agreement was ambiguous as to whether Husbandâ€™s adjustment was\r\nsubject to gains and losses accrued between the date of divorce and the date of\r\ndistribution.&nbsp; On one hand, the agreement did not state Husband was\r\nentitled to a definite, lump sum payment of $128,187.&nbsp; On the other hand,\r\nthe Separation Agreement also did not specifically provide that Husbandâ€™s\r\nadjustment was subject to gains or losses.&nbsp; The Separation Agreement simply\r\nfails to address the issue and is susceptible to more than one reasonable\r\ninterpretation.\r\nThe Amended QDRO resolves the\r\nambiguity by clarifying the adjustment should take into account gains and losses\r\naccrued.&nbsp; Thus, read together, the Separation Agreement and the Amended\r\nQDRO provide that Husbandâ€™s adjustment is subject to market\r\nfluctuations.&nbsp; Because the Amended QDRO and the Separation Agreement are\r\nreconcilable, the family court properly determined they should be read\r\ntogether.&nbsp; See Davidson v. Davidson, 916 S.W.2d 918, 923\r\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 1995).&nbsp;\r\nThe Amended QDRO takes a sound\r\napproach to clarifying the ambiguity in the Separation Agreement.&nbsp; The\r\nparties expressed a clear intent to split personal property and financial\r\naccounts 58% to Wife, 42% to Husband.&nbsp; Ideally, Wifeâ€™s BellSouth 401(k)\r\nwould have been divided on the date of divorce.&nbsp; However, the federal law\r\nrequirements for alienating a retirement account render the process time\r\nconsuming.&nbsp; 29 U.S.C.A. section 1056 sets forth a number of criteria for\r\nestablishing an exception to the general rule against assignment or alienation\r\nof pension plans.&nbsp; Plan administrators are required to analyze QDROs to\r\nensure they comply with the applicable federal law.&nbsp; See 29 U.S.C.A.\r\nÂ§ 1056(d)(3)(G)(i)(II).&nbsp; As a result, Husband was not able to obtain his\r\nshare of Wifeâ€™s 401(k) at the time of divorce.\r\nAs of the date of divorce, the\r\nBellSouth 401(k) was valued at $314,275.&nbsp; The unfortunate downturn in the\r\nfinancial markets and the domestic turmoil occurring in 2001 resulted in both\r\nHusband and Wife suffering substantial losses to their respective shares of Wifeâ€™s\r\n401(k).&nbsp; Under the Amended QDRO, the parties bear this loss in accordance\r\nwith their agreed upon distribution ratio of 58%/42%.&nbsp; Of course, had the\r\nparties clearly expressed that Husband was entitled to a fixed sum of $128,187,\r\nsuch an agreement would control.&nbsp; However, considering the ambiguity in the\r\nSeparation Agreement, we hold the family court correctly interpreted the\r\nagreement in conjunction with the Amended QDRO to best effectuate the partiesâ€™\r\nintent.&nbsp; Accordingly, we affirm the family courtâ€™s dismissal of Husbandâ€™s\r\nRule to Show Cause.&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and WILLIAMS,\r\nJJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-414","title":"Horger v.

Code Ann. Â§ 57-9-10 (1991) to close\r\na portion of Vincent Drive that crosses their property in Orangeburg\r\nCounty.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\n1.&nbsp; We find there is no\r\nevidence to support Appellantsâ€™ contention that they entered into an agreement\r\nwith the Fire District to leave the road open only until a new fire station\r\nbecame available to serve the area in the vicinity of the road.&nbsp; Appellants\r\nassert under this agreement the Fire District agreed to withdraw its objection\r\nto the road closing.&nbsp;\r\nIn their brief, Appellants cite to\r\ntheir attorneyâ€™s statement during the hearing in this matter that they had\r\nentered into such an agreement with the Fire Department.&nbsp; Appellants do\r\nnot, however, cite to any evidence in the record containing proof of such an\r\nagreement.&nbsp; See, e.g., Historic Charleston Foundation v.\r\nKrawcheck, 313 S.C. 500, 443 S.E.2d 401 (Ct. App. 1994) (stating the\r\narguments of counsel generally cannot be considered as evidence when deciding\r\nfactual issues); Gilmore v. Ivey, 290 S.C. 53, 348 S.E.2d 180 (Ct. App.\r\n1986) (holding the statements of counsel are not considered factual\r\nevidence).&nbsp; The burden is on an appellant to furnish a sufficient record on\r\nappeal from which this Court can make a review.&nbsp; Germain v. Nichol,\r\n278 S.C. 508, 299 S.E.2d 335 (1983).&nbsp; Because we do not find any evidence\r\nin the record to support Appellantsâ€™ contention that an agreement existed, we\r\nfind no error in this regard.\r\n2.&nbsp; We next address Appellantsâ€™\r\nargument that the School District did not have standing to\r\nobject to the closure of the road.&nbsp; Appellants argue all school bus\r\ntransportation is administered by the South Carolina Department of Education\r\npursuant to section 59-67-410 of the South Carolina Code.&nbsp; See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 59-67-410 (2004) (â€œThe control and management of all school bus\r\ntransportation in the State shall be vested in the State Board of Education.â€).&nbsp;\r\nThey contend the State of South Carolina, therefore, not the School\r\nDistrict, has standing to object to the closing of the road.\r\nInitially, we question whether this\r\nissue is preserved for appeal.&nbsp; Although the parties discussed standing at\r\nthe hearing and the master orally indicated he believed the School District had\r\nstanding, the master did not include a specific ruling on the issue of standing\r\nin his final, written order, and Appellants did not file a motion to alter or\r\namend the masterâ€™s order pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP with regard to this\r\nissue.&nbsp; See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 403 S.E.2d 122\r\n(1991) (holding an issue must be both raised to and ruled on by the court and if\r\nthe issue is not explicitly addressed in the courtâ€™s order, the party should\r\nfile a motion to alter or amend the judgment to include a ruling on the\r\nmatter).&nbsp;\r\nIn any event, even assuming the\r\nissue is preserved, given the School Districtâ€™s obligations under the\r\nRegulations of the South Carolina Board of Education to supervise school\r\ntransportation programs and to prepare routes to be approved by the Department\r\nof Education, we find the School District has a real, material, or substantial\r\ninterest in the subject matter of the action and thus has standing to object to\r\nthe road closing.&nbsp; See 24 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 43-80(A) (Supp. 2004)\r\n(â€œThe school district board of trustees shall be responsible to the State\r\nBoard of Education for the supervision of the school transportation program in\r\nthe district.â€); 24 S.C.

Tracy Brown, of Charleston,\r\n        for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; First Sun\r\nOutplacement and Personnel Consultants, Inc. appeals the decision of the circuit\r\ncourt finding First Sun owed Debbie Williams compensation for work she performed\r\nâ€œduring or after her disassociation with [First Sun].â€&nbsp; First Sun\r\ncontends any compensation would violate public policy as their contract for\r\nservices was unlawful.&nbsp; We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1991, First Sun began providing\r\npersonnel placement services throughout South\r\nCarolina and in several cities in neighboring states.&nbsp; First Sun assisted\r\nemployers with termination procedures and also offered transitional career\r\nservices for individuals who had been laid off and were seeking\r\nemployment.&nbsp; The services included preparing resumes and helping clients\r\nlearn how to search for positions, to approach potential employers, and to\r\nimprove their interviewing skills.&nbsp;\r\nIn 1995, Williams signed an\r\nagreement with First Sun to become a licensee of the company.&nbsp; Under the\r\ncontract, Williams was to be compensated at the rate of 80% of the gross income\r\nshe generated.&nbsp; She also was to â€œreceive 1% equity ownership for each\r\n$100,000 of adjusted gross business generated up to 5% ($500,000).â€&nbsp; The\r\ncontract contained a covenant not to compete, in which Williams agreed she would\r\nnot â€œengage in professional outplacement . . . throughout the State of South\r\nCarolina or any other markets served by First Sunâ€ for two years in the event\r\nshe terminated their agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDuring her tenure, Williams learned\r\nFirst Sun was operating without a business license as required by the South\r\nCarolina Private Personnel Placement Services Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-25-10\r\nto â€“110 (1986 &amp; Supp. 2004), and she advised First Sun of the need to\r\nobtain a license.&nbsp; The Act requires businesses providing private personnel\r\nplacement services to be licensed.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-25-30(A) (Supp.\r\n2004) (â€œNo person or firm may engage in the private personnel placement\r\nservice business in South Carolina unless the person or firm has a current\r\nlicense for the business as provided in this chapter.â€).&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn 2002, Williams left First Sun and\r\nopened a competing company offering similar services after First Sun refused to\r\ngive her the equity shares she alleged she was entitled to under the partiesâ€™\r\ncontract.&nbsp; After Williams left First Sun, clients paid invoices to First\r\nSun that would have resulted in commissions being paid to Williams.&nbsp; In\r\naddition, First Sun asked Williams to continue working on certain assignments\r\nthat she had begun but not completed at the time of her resignation.&nbsp; The\r\nparties agreed Williams would be paid for those services; however, First Sun\r\nnever paid Williams for that work.\r\nFirst Sun brought this action in\r\n2003 alleging Williams was in violation of the partiesâ€™ covenant not to\r\ncompete and asserting causes of action for breach of contract, tortious\r\ninterference with current and prospective contractual relationships, and\r\nmisappropriation of trade secrets.&nbsp; First Sun also sought to enjoin\r\nWilliams from further violation of the non-compete clause.[2]&nbsp; Williams answered, denying the allegations,\r\nand filed counterclaims for quantum meruit and breach of\r\ncontract.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe circuit court bifurcated the\r\nissues of liability and damages, with the parties agreeing to have the issue of\r\nliability decided upon stipulated facts.&nbsp; The circuit court adopted the\r\nstipulated facts and found First Sun operated unlawfully in violation of the\r\nSouth Carolina Private Personnel Placement Services Act by failing to obtain a\r\nlicense.&nbsp; The court found the partiesâ€™ contract and the covenant not to\r\ncompete were, therefore, void as violative of statutory law and public policy.[3]&nbsp; As for Williamsâ€™s\r\ncounterclaims, the court found Williams was entitled â€œto any sums due her for\r\nwork done for [First Sun] during or after her disassociation with [First Sun].â€&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFirst Sun filed a motion to alter or\r\namend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, in which it asked the court\r\nâ€œto reconsider its ruling that [Williams] is entitled to recover under her\r\nCounterclaim, in light of the Courtâ€™s ruling that the Covenant is not\r\nenforceable.â€&nbsp; The court denied the motion, and this appeal\r\nfollowed.&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFirst Sun argues the circuit court\r\nerred in finding Williams is entitled to compensation for the work she performed\r\nafter her severance from the company.&nbsp; First Sun maintains any work\r\nWilliams performed was unlawful and should not be compensable since the company\r\nwas not licensed.&nbsp;\r\nFirst Sun asserts the circuit court\r\nmust have based its theory of recovery in equity because the court found the\r\npartiesâ€™ original contract was void as unlawful since First Sun was not\r\nlicensed.&nbsp; First Sun contends any new, supplemental contract for the\r\nservices Williamsâ€™s performed after her resignation would, therefore,\r\nnecessarily be void for the same reasons.\r\nAssuming the recovery was in equity,\r\nFirst Sun further asserts that, since the court found the original contract was\r\nvoid, it could not allow a recovery on an equitable ground because one cannot\r\nrecover for an unlawful act either in contract or in equity.&nbsp;\r\nAs noted above, quantum meruit\r\nwas one of the two counterclaims asserted by Williams.&nbsp; â€œ[Q]uantum\r\nmeruit, quasi-contract, and implied by law contract are equivalent terms\r\nfor an equitable remedy.â€&nbsp; Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 8, 532 S.E.2d 868,\r\n872 (2000).&nbsp; The equitable doctrine of quantum meruit allows\r\nan aggrieved party to recover for unjust enrichment.&nbsp; Columbia Wholesale\r\nCo. v. Scudder May N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129, 130\r\n(1994).&nbsp;\r\nTo prevail on this theory, a\r\nplaintiff must establish the following three elements:&nbsp; (1) a benefit\r\nconferred by the plaintiff upon the defendant, (2) realization of that benefit\r\nby the defendant, and (3) retention of the benefit by the defendant under\r\ncircumstances that make it inequitable for the defendant to retain it without\r\npaying its value.&nbsp; Myrtle Beach Hosp., 341 S.C. at 8-9, 532\r\nS.E.2d at 872.\r\nâ€œIn a law action, the measure of\r\ndamages is determined by the partiesâ€™ agreement, while in equity, â€˜the\r\nmeasure of the recovery is the extent of the duty or obligation imposed by law,\r\nand is expressed by the amount which the Court considers the defendant has been\r\nunjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.â€™ â€&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 8, 532 S.E.2d at 872 (quoting U.S. Rubber Prods., Inc. v. Town of\r\nBatesburg, 183 S.C. 49, 55, 190 S.E. 120, 123-24 (1937)).\r\nWe hold Williams has met the\r\nrequired elements for recovery under a theory of quantum meruit as\r\nWilliams conferred a benefit upon First Sun by performing work for which she was\r\nnot compensated, First Sun realized that benefit, and First Sun has retained the\r\nbenefit under circumstances that would make it inequitable for it to do so\r\nwithout paying its value.\r\nWe further conclude the circuit\r\ncourtâ€™s determination that the partiesâ€™ original contract was unlawful does\r\nnot bar Williamsâ€™s recovery.&nbsp; First Sun relies upon Jackson v. Bi-Lo\r\nStores, Inc., 313 S.C. 272, 437 S.E.2d 168 (Ct. App. 1993), for the\r\nproposition that public policy will not allow a contract based upon an unlawful\r\nact to be enforced.&nbsp; First Sun contends that, since the circuit court\r\ndetermined that partiesâ€™ original contract was void because First Sun did not\r\nhave a business license, Williams likewise cannot obtain compensation for her\r\nservices under an equitable theory.&nbsp; See id. at 276, 437\r\nS.E.2d at 170 (â€œIt is a well-founded policy of law that no person be permitted\r\nto acquire a right of action from their own unlawful act and one who\r\nparticipates in an unlawful act cannot recover damages for the consequence of\r\nthat act.&nbsp; This rule applies at both law and in equity and whether the\r\ncause of action is in contract or in tort.â€ (internal citation omitted)).\r\nAlthough we agree that the\r\nlegislature intended businesses such as First Sun obtain appropriate licensing,\r\nthat legislative intent would not be defeated by allowing Williams to be\r\ncompensated for the work she performed at First Sunâ€™s request after she had\r\ngiven notice of her resignation.&nbsp; Considering all of the surrounding\r\ncircumstances, it would simply be unjust for First Sun to reap the benefit of\r\nWilliamsâ€™s work and then avoid compensating her because First Sun failed to\r\nfollow the law.[4]&nbsp; Accordingly,\r\nwe conclude the circuit court did not err in determining Williams is entitled to\r\nreasonable compensation for her services.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE,\r\nJJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule\r\n215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; First Sun also brought suit against Jim Kirk; however, none\r\nof those claims are involved in this appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n[3]&nbsp; No challenge is made on appeal to the circuit courtâ€™s\r\nruling that the partiesâ€™ original contract is void and unenforceable; thus,\r\nthe ruling is now the law of the case.&nbsp; See, e.g., Larimore v.\r\nCarolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438, 531 S.E.2d 538 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n(stating an unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case and the appellate\r\ncourt must presume it is correct).\r\n[4]&nbsp; We note First Sun did not obtain a business license until\r\nafter the commencement of this action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-416","title":"State v.

Spencer, Office of the Attorney General, all of\r\n        Columbia, and Robert Douglas Robbins, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Stanley\r\nBennett appeals from his convictions for driving under suspension (DUS), 4th,\r\nand habitual traffic offender, arguing the trial judge erred by allowing the\r\nadmission of his entire driving record into evidence.&nbsp; We affirm.[1]&nbsp;\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 31, 2002, Bennett\r\noverturned his sports utility vehicle in a one-car accident on I-26.&nbsp; When\r\nthe police officer arrived at the scene of the accident, Bennett was already\r\noutside of the vehicle and talking to an off-duty emergency services technician\r\nwho stopped to help.&nbsp; The officer testified that Bennett told him he was\r\nthe driver of the vehicle, and he was alone in the vehicle at the time of the\r\naccident.&nbsp; However, Bennett testified he was not driving the vehicle and\r\nprior to the officerâ€™s arrival the driver had left the scene of the accident\r\nto get help.&nbsp; When the officer asked Bennett for his license, Bennett told\r\nthe officer it was inside the overturned vehicle.&nbsp; After obtaining Bennettâ€™s\r\nname and calling the dispatch, the officer discovered that Bennettâ€™s license\r\nwas suspended and the Department of Public Safety (the â€œDepartmentâ€) had\r\ndeclared him a habitual offender.\r\nDuring a jury trial on March 20,\r\n2003, Bennett stipulated to jurisdiction in circuit court and objected to the\r\nadmission of his prior three convictions for DUS.&nbsp; However, the trial judge\r\nruled they were admissible to prove the habitual offender charge, and therefore,\r\nthere was no prejudice to Bennett.&nbsp; The trial judge also noted that the\r\nState did not have to accept Bennettâ€™s offer to stipulate to the existence of\r\nprior offenses when the existence of the prior offenses was necessary to\r\nestablish jurisdiction of the circuit court.&nbsp; Bennett objected to the\r\nadmission of his entire driving record unless it showed only Bennettâ€™s three\r\nprior convictions for DUS that were necessary to establish jurisdiction, arguing\r\nthe entire record was unduly prejudicial and not relevant.&nbsp; The trial judge\r\nruled that the statute permits the entire record to be entered into\r\nevidence.&nbsp; Thus, at trial, the State introduced letters from the Department\r\nstating that Bennett was under suspension for DUS and for being a habitual\r\noffender.&nbsp; The State also introduced a certified copy of Bennettâ€™s\r\ndriving record, which listed numerous violations of traffic laws including\r\nconvictions for driving under the influence, convictions for DUS, and\r\nsuspensions for failing to take a breathalyzer.&nbsp; Bennett was found guilty\r\nas charged.&nbsp; He was sentenced to six months in prison for DUS and five\r\nyears, suspended to three, and three years probation for driving after being\r\ndeclared a habitual offender.&nbsp; Bennett\r\nappeals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate\r\ncourt reviews errors of law only.&nbsp; State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829\r\n(2001).&nbsp; â€œThe admission of evidence is left to the discretion of the\r\ntrial judge, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion\r\nby the trial judge.â€&nbsp; State v. James, 355 S.C. 25, 30, 583 S.E.2d\r\n745, 747 (2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBennett argues the trial judge erred\r\nby allowing the admission of his entire driving record into evidence during his\r\ntrial for DUS and driving after the Department had declared him a habitual\r\noffender.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nTo prove that Bennett was driving\r\nunder suspension, the State had to prove that Bennett was operating a motor\r\nvehicle on the public highway while his license was suspended.&nbsp; State v.\r\nJohnson, 299 S.C. 130, 132, 382 S.E.2d 909, 910 (1989).&nbsp; To establish\r\njurisdiction in the trial court, the State was required to prove that Bennett\r\nhad two or more prior suspensions.&nbsp; State v. Anderson, 318 S.C. 395, 398-399, 458 S.E.2d 56, 58 (Ct. App.\r\n1995).&nbsp; Bennett stipulated to jurisdiction in circuit court; however, the\r\nState refused to accept the stipulation.&nbsp; In State v. James, our\r\nsupreme court held that â€œthe State cannot be forced to accept a defendantâ€™s\r\nstipulation to prior convictions because that would interfere with the Stateâ€™s\r\nright to prove its case with â€˜evidence of its own choosing.â€™â€&nbsp; 355\r\nS.C. 25, 34, 583 S.E.2d 745, 749 (2003) (quoting State v. Hamilton, 327\r\nS.C. 440, 445, 486 S.E.2d 512, 514 (1997)).&nbsp;\r\nBennett asserts the State was\r\nrequired to accept his offer to stipulate under Section 56-5-2980 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2004), which provides that â€œ[i]f the defendant stipulates\r\nthat the charge constitutes a second or subsequent offense, the indictment shall\r\nnot contain allegations of prior offenses and evidence of such prior offenses\r\nmust not be introduced.â€&nbsp; However, section 56-5-2980 does not apply to\r\nthe crimes of DUS or habitual offender.&nbsp; Section 56-5-2980 states that it\r\nonly applies to trials and proceedings â€œin which the defendant is charged with\r\na violation of Section 56-5-2920 [reckless driving], 56-5-2930 [operating a\r\nvehicle under the influence], or 56-5-2933 [driving with an unlawful alcohol\r\nconcentration].â€&nbsp; See Anderson, 318 S.C. at 399 n.2, 458\r\nS.E.2d at 58 n.2 (â€œThe plain meaning of the statute [Â§ 56-5-2980], which has\r\nno application to a charge of DUS, suggests that the solicitor must assent\r\nbefore a stipulation is effective.â€).&nbsp; Since the State refused to accept\r\nthe stipulation and was not required to by the statute, the State had to prove\r\nthat the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction of the DUS charge.&nbsp; Anderson,\r\n318 S.C. at 398-399, 458 S.E.2d at 58.&nbsp; Therefore, â€œ[a]bsent a\r\nstipulation as to subject matter jurisdiction, [Bennett] had no real right to\r\nobject to the admission into evidence of his prior DUS . . . conviction[].â€&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 399, 458 S.E.2d at 58.&nbsp; Further, the trial judge instructed the jury\r\nthat Bennettâ€™s prior record was â€œintroduced solely for the purpose of\r\nshowing jurisdiction in [trial] court.â€&nbsp; Thus, the trial court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in admitting a certified copy of Bennettâ€™s driving record\r\nand letters from the Department stating that Bennett was under suspension for\r\nDUS and for being a habitual offender.&nbsp; Additionally, Bennett was not\r\nprejudiced by the admission into evidence of prior convictions because the trial\r\ncourt gave a sufficient limiting instruction to the jury.&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nThe Department has the authority to\r\ndeclare a person a habitual offender by following the procedures outlined in\r\nsection 56-1-1030 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004).&nbsp; Pursuant to\r\nthis statute, the Department had adjudicated Bennett to be a habitual\r\noffender.&nbsp; To prove that Bennett was driving after having been declared a\r\nhabitual offender, the State was required to show that Bennett had been found to\r\nbe a habitual offender and was operating a motor vehicle while the decision of\r\nthe Department prohibiting operation was in effect.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n56-1-1100 (Supp. 2004).\r\nBennett argues that the judge should\r\nnot have allowed the State to introduce his whole driving record into evidence;\r\nhowever, the trial judge had already properly admitted his prior convictions for\r\nDUS to establish jurisdiction of the court.&nbsp; Although Bennettâ€™s prior\r\nrecord of driving under the influence and violation of the implied consent law\r\nmay have been inadmissible, we find that the evidence was not unduly prejudicial\r\nto Bennett based on the entire record in the case and the judgeâ€™s limiting\r\ninstruction to the jury.&nbsp; Additionally, we hold the admission of the\r\nevidence was harmless error in light of the overwhelming evidence against\r\nBennett.&nbsp; See State v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73,\r\n82, 606 S.E.2d 215, 220 (Ct.

Lindsay, 328\r\nS.C. 329, 338, 491 S.E.2d 583, 588 (Ct. App. 1997).&nbsp; â€œFailure to\r\nchallenge the ruling â€˜is an abandonment of the issue and precludes\r\nconsideration on appeal.â€™â€ Id. (quoting Biales v. Young, 315\r\nS.C. 166, 168, 432 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1993)).&nbsp; â€œThe unchallenged ruling,\r\nâ€˜right or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmance.â€™â€&nbsp; Id.\r\n(quoting Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 161, 177\r\nS.E.2d 544, 544 (1970)).\r\nSaad had notice of the lawsuit,\r\nresponded to it, and suffered the judgment to be entered against his individual\r\ntrade name.&nbsp; Thereafter, Saad did not challenge the magistrateâ€™s\r\nruling.&nbsp; Thus, Saad abandoned the issue of the use of his trade name in the\r\nlawsuit, and the unchallenged ruling has become the law of the case.&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY, and SHORT,\r\nJJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-418","title":"State v.

Henry McKellar\r\nfound Rawl was an indispensable plaintiff under Rule 19, SCRCP.&nbsp; Taylor moved to alter or amend the order on the ground it failed to\r\nspecify the manner and means whereby Rawl would be brought into the\r\nlawsuit.&nbsp; By order dated July 19, 2001, Judge McKeller ordered Master\r\nConstruction to effectuate the joinder of Rawl.&nbsp; Master Construction did\r\nnot comply with the order to join Rawl.\r\nAfter Taylor\r\nfailed to appear at a roster meeting, Judge Alison R. Lee dismissed the action\r\nfor failure to prosecute by order dated July 16, 2001.&nbsp; Judge Leeâ€™s order\r\nreflects that the attorneys of record for each party were served with the order;\r\nhowever, Taylor contends he had no notice of the dismissal until July 16,\r\n2003.&nbsp;\r\nOn September 12, 2002, Taylor\r\nfiled an amended complaint adding Rawl as plaintiff.&nbsp; Master Construction\r\nanswered and asserted the case should be dismissed because the statute of\r\nlimitations had run.&nbsp; Nine months later, on July 3, 2003, Master\r\nConstruction moved for summary judgment and referenced, for the first time,\r\nJudge Leeâ€™s order in its memorandum in support of summary judgment.&nbsp;\r\nMaster Construction argued Judge Leeâ€™s order dismissed the case, and the\r\nthree-year statute of limitations barred the action at the time Taylor\r\nfiled the amended complaint adding Rawl as a party.&nbsp; On July 18, 2003, Taylor\r\nand Rawl moved to alter or amend Judge Leeâ€™s order dismissing the case,\r\narguing the case should be restored to the roster because neither Taylor nor\r\nRawl had notice of the order of dismissal until Master Constructionâ€™s attorney\r\nfaxed it to them on July 16, 2003.&nbsp; Thereafter, Judge Lee vacated her prior\r\norder dismissing the case and restored the case to the active roster.&nbsp;\r\nBy order dated October 15, 2003,\r\nJudge Reginald I. Lloyd denied Master Constructionâ€™s previous motion for\r\nsummary judgment, and the case proceeded to trial.style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;\r\nmso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\r\nmso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA&quot;&gt;&nbsp; At the\r\ntrial, Master Construction again moved for summary judgment, but the motion was\r\ndenied.&nbsp;\r\nAdditionally, Master Construction proffered the testimony of Glen Walker,\r\nthe general manager of the company from which Master Construction purchased the\r\nconcrete.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the trial court disallowed the witness on the basis \r\n\r\n Walker\r\n\r\n was testifying as an expert witness and could not be qualified as such.&nbsp;\r\nAfter both sides presented their\r\ncases to the jury, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of Taylor and\r\nRawl on the breach of contract claim, finding there was no question of fact that\r\nthe pad was defective and submitted the issue of damages to the jury.&nbsp; The\r\njury returned a verdict for $52,000.&nbsp; Master Construction moved for\r\na new trial nisi remittitur, a new trial, and a judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict, all of which were denied.&nbsp; This appeal\r\nfollows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nStatute of Limitations\r\nMaster Construction argues the trial\r\ncourt erred in failing to dismiss the case because the applicable three-year\r\nstatute of limitations had expired when Taylor and Rawl filed the amended\r\ncomplaint on September 12, 2002.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nA cause of action for breach of\r\ncontract must be filed within three years after the date the breach was or\r\nshould have been discovered.&nbsp; S.C.

App.\r\n1998) (holding the discovery rule applies to breach of contract actions, and\r\npursuant to the discovery rule, the action accrues on the date the aggrieved\r\nparty knew or could have discovered the breach through the exercise of\r\nreasonable diligence).&nbsp; In the instant case, the statute of limitations\r\nbegan to run, at the latest, in July 1998.&nbsp; Taylor\r\ntimely filed the original complaint on April 8, 1999.&nbsp; Master Construction\r\nmoved to have Rawl joined as a party under Rule 19, SCRCP.&nbsp; Before the\r\nstatute of limitations had run, the trial court granted Master Constructionâ€™s\r\nmotion and ordered Rawl added as a party.&nbsp; However, Master Construction did\r\nnot file the amended complaint within the statute of limitations period and thus\r\nRawl was not added to the caption of the complaint.&nbsp; Taylor only filed the\r\namended complaint adding Rawl to the caption because of Master Constructionâ€™s\r\nfailure to do so.&nbsp;\r\nPursuant to Rule 15(c), SCRCP:\r\n\r\n  An amendment changing the party\r\n  against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the foregoing provision\r\n  is satisfied and, within the period provided by law for commencing the action\r\n  against him the party to be brought in by amendment (1) has received such\r\n  notice of the institution of the action that he will not be prejudiced in\r\n  maintaining his defense on the merits, and (2) knew or should have known that,\r\n  but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action\r\n  would have been brought against him.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).&nbsp; Therefore, a\r\nplaintiff may substitute a defendant, who was not named in the original\r\npleading, after the statute of limitations has expired as long as certain\r\nrequirements are met.&nbsp; In Jackson v. Doe, 342 S.C. 552, 558-59, 537\r\nS.E.2d 567, 570 (Ct. App. 2000), this court held that the plain language of Rule\r\n15(c), SCRCP, indicates that although amendments substituting a party relate\r\nback to the date of the original pleading, those that add a new party not named\r\nin the original pleading do not relate back, therefore additional parities must\r\nbe added within the statute of limitations period.&nbsp; We note that the plain\r\nlanguage of Rule 15 refers only to defendants, whereas the party joined in the\r\ninstant case was a plaintiff; however, a plaintiff must also file an action\r\nwithin the three-year statute of limitations or the claim is barred.&nbsp; S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(1) (2005).&nbsp; Regardless, assuming the rule that an\r\namendment adding a party cannot be made after the statute of limitations expires\r\napplies to plaintiff, the trial court ordered Rawl joined as a party prior to\r\nthe running of the statute of limitations, thus we find the statute of\r\nlimitations does not bar the instant action.&nbsp;\r\nMaster Construction contends the\r\namended complaint adding Rawl as a party constituted a re-filing of the cause of\r\naction because the case had been dismissed by Judge Leeâ€™s order dated July 16,\r\n2001.&nbsp; However, Judge Leeâ€™s order dismissing the complaint was nullified\r\nby her subsequent order vacating that decision; therefore we address the\r\nremainder of the case as if the dismissal never occurred.&nbsp; Master\r\nConstruction filed a notice of appeal designating it was appealing from the\r\ntrial courtâ€™s order entering a verdict in favor of Taylor and Rawl; however,\r\nit did not specify it was appealing from Judge Leeâ€™s order.&nbsp; Because\r\nMaster Construction failed to designate it was appealing from Judge Leeâ€™s\r\norder dated October 16, 2003, which vacated the earlier order dismissing the\r\naction and restored the case to the active roster, is the law of the case.&nbsp;\r\nTolerâ€™s Cove Homeowners Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Trident Constr. Co., Inc.,\r\n355 S.C. 605, 610, 586 S.E.2d 581, 584 (2003) (holding an unappealed order\r\nbecomes the law of the case).&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWitness Testimony\r\nMaster Construction argues the trial\r\ncourt erred by refusing to allow its witness to testify. &nbsp;We disagree.\r\nThe decision to admit or exclude\r\nevidence is within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion and will not be\r\ndisturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Gamble v. Intâ€™l Paper\r\nRealty Corp. of South Carolina, 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438,\r\n441 (1996).&nbsp; â€œGenerally, there is no abuse of discretion where the\r\nexcluded testimony is merely cumulative of other evidence proffered to the jury.â€\r\nCommerce Center of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen &amp; Assocs., Inc.,\r\n347 S.C. 545, 559, 556 S.E.2d 718, 726 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nMaster Construction listed Walker as\r\na fact witness prior to trial and indicated that he would testify regarding the\r\ncontract.&nbsp; During the proffer, Walker testified that Master Construction\r\nordered 3,000 PSI concrete.&nbsp; However, Walker also gave highly technical\r\nexpert testimony, which the trial court excluded because Walker could not be\r\nqualified as an expert witness.&nbsp; Assuming the trial court properly excluded\r\nWalkerâ€™s testimony, there was no abuse of discretion.&nbsp; J. Eddie Fulmer,\r\nowner of Master Construction, also testified he ordered 3,000 PSI concrete from\r\nWalker and Master Constructionâ€™s proffer indicated the only non-expert\r\ntestimony Walker would give regarded Master Constructionâ€™s order.&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, because Walkerâ€™s testimony was merely cumulative to other admitted\r\ntestimony, we find no basis for reversal.\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDirected Verdict\r\nMaster Construction argues the trial\r\ncourt erred in directing a verdict in favor of Taylor and Rawl on the breach of\r\ncontract claim.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\nIn ruling on a motion for directed\r\nverdict, a court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the\r\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party.&nbsp; Swinton Creek Nursery v.\r\nEdisto Farm Credit, ACA, 334 S.C. 469, 476, 514 S.E.2d 126, 130 (1999). When\r\nthe evidence yields only one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the\r\nmoving party is proper.&nbsp; Id.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light\r\nmost favorable to Master Construction, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s\r\ndecision to direct a verdict on the breach of contract claim.&nbsp; Uncontested\r\nevidence indicated Master Construction breached the contract with Taylor.&nbsp;\r\nThe contract stated that the pad would be four inches thick with a strength of\r\nâ€œ3000 PSI with wire reinforcing,â€ and the work would be â€œcompleted in a\r\nsubstantial workmanlike manner.â€&nbsp; In his testimony, Fulmer stated he\r\nagreed the pad was not 3,000 PSI, the pad needed to be fixed, and he â€œwould\r\nnot want it the way it was.â€&nbsp; Additionally, G. Allen Moore, an expert\r\nwitness, testified that testing on the pad showed it was not four inches thick\r\nand it did not test at 3,000 PSI.&nbsp; Master Construction contends Walkerâ€™s\r\ntestimony would have countered Allenâ€™s testimony; however, Walker only\r\ntestified in the proffer that Master Construction ordered 3,000 PSI\r\nconcrete.&nbsp; Walker did not testify that the finished pad had a strength of\r\n3,000 PSI, as required by the contract.&nbsp; Because Master Construction\r\noffered no evidence to contradict the assertion that the pad did not test at\r\n3,000 PSI, we find Master Construction breached the contract as a matter of law.\r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDefense of Acceptance\r\nMaster Construction argues the trial\r\ncourt erred in denying its motion to amend the pleadings to include the defense\r\nof acceptance.&nbsp; We find the argument has not been properly preserved.\r\nAn issue must be raised and ruled\r\nupon by the trial judge in order to be preserved for appellate review. &nbsp;Talley\r\nv. South Carolina Higher Educ. Tuition Grants Comm., 289 S.C. 483, 487, 347\r\nS.E.2d 99, 101 (1986).&nbsp; Master Construction argues it moved to amend its\r\npleadings to include the defense of acceptance at the end of the trial; however,\r\nour review of the record indicates Master Constructionâ€™s attorney made only a\r\ngeneral motion to â€œrenew my motion under 16(b) (sic) to amend the pleadings to\r\nconform to the evidence,â€ which lacked any specific reference to the defense\r\nof acceptance.&nbsp; In Master Constructionâ€™s only other Rule 15(b) motion,\r\nMaster Construction asked to include the defenses of waiver and estoppel.&nbsp;\r\nWe can find no instance where Master Construction raised the defense of\r\nacceptance to the trial court.&nbsp; Because arguments raised for the first time\r\non appeal are not preserved for our review, we decline to consider the\r\nissue.&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-420","title":"State v.

Gay, of Rock\r\n        Hill, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: &nbsp;Zepsa\r\nConstruction, Inc. appeals the trial courtâ€™s order denying its request for\r\ndisbursement of funds from a mechanicâ€™s lien bond to pay a personal judgment\r\nZepsa asserts it is owed from Phillip and Virginia Randazzo.&nbsp; We affirm.1\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Randazzos entered into a\r\ncontract with Zepsa under which Zepsa agreed to construct a restaurant for the\r\nRandazzos for $610,000.&nbsp; After Zepsa commenced work on the project, the\r\nRandazzos notified it, through their attorney, that they wished to terminate the\r\ncontract.&nbsp; Subsequently, Zepsa filed a complaint and notice of mechanicâ€™s\r\nlien against property owned by the Randazzos seeking payment of a total of\r\n$108,461.33.&nbsp; This amount included the alleged $81,346.00 balance due on\r\nthe Randazzosâ€™ account and attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of\r\n$27,115.33.&nbsp;\r\nInitially, the Randazzos did not\r\nrespond to Zepsaâ€™s complaint and after a hearing on the matter, the trial\r\ncourt issued an order for judgment and foreclosure of mechanicâ€™s lien.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court subsequently set aside this default judgment after the Randazzos\r\nasserted service of the summons and complaint was insufficient.&nbsp; After\r\nanother hearing on the matter, the trial court issued an order in January of\r\n2001 finding the Randazzos liable for $10,846 for the unpaid balance of the work\r\ndone to the property and $40,000 in lost profits and overhead to Zepsa.&nbsp; In\r\naddition to the $50,846 award, the trial court ordered the Randazzos to pay\r\nprejudgment interest on this amount to Zepsa.&nbsp; Later, the trial court\r\nissued another order requiring the Randazzos to pay attorneyâ€™s fees and costs\r\nto Zepsa pursuant to the mechanicâ€™s lien statute.&nbsp;\r\nThe Randazzos appealed both the\r\ntrial courtâ€™s orders.&nbsp; This court initially issued an order affirming, as\r\nmodified, the trial courtâ€™s order.2&nbsp;\r\nIn that order, we determined the trial court erred in awarding the $40,000 in\r\nlost profits and overhead to Zepsa.&nbsp; First, we determined the trial court\r\nerred in awarding this amount as an element of damages under Zepsaâ€™s breach of\r\ncontract action because Zepsa only pleaded a mechanicâ€™s lien theory of\r\nrecovery.&nbsp; Second, we found as lost profits and overhead generally are not\r\nrecoverable as an element of damages in mechanicâ€™s lien foreclosure action,\r\nZepsa was limited to recovery of only $10,846.00 for the work actually\r\ncompleted.&nbsp; Later, we withdrew this opinion and filed a substituted opinion\r\nonly addressing the issue of whether the trial court erred in determining lost\r\nprofits and overhead were recoverable as an element in a mechanicâ€™s lien\r\nforeclosure action.3&nbsp; Again, we\r\ndetermined such amounts were not recoverable under a mechanicâ€™s lien\r\nforeclosure action, thereby only entitling Zepsa to $10,846, the amount due\r\nrelated to work performed.&nbsp;\r\nZepsa filed an ex parte\r\nmotion to attach a $108,461 cash bond the Randazzos had posted with the York\r\nCounty Clerk of Court, pursuant to South Carolina Code Annotated Section\r\n29-5-110.&nbsp; Zepsa sought to have the entire amount of the funds disbursed to\r\npay the mechanicâ€™s lien judgment and the personal judgment it claimed the\r\ntrial court ordered in the underlying action.&nbsp; The Randazzos opposed this\r\nmotion, objecting to disbursement of any funds other than the $10,846.00 for the\r\nmechanicâ€™s lien judgment.&nbsp; After the hearing, the trial court issued an\r\norder granting Zepsaâ€™s request with regard to the amount owed under the\r\nlien.&nbsp; This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nZepsa argues the trial court erred\r\nin not ordering disbursement of the entire bond amount.&nbsp; Zepsa asserts\r\nalthough this courtâ€™s decision precluded damages for lost profits and overhead\r\nunder its action to foreclose on a mechanicâ€™s lien, it remains entitled to\r\nthis award as a personal judgment against the Randazzos.&nbsp;\r\nRegardless of whether Zepsa is\r\nentitled to a personal judgment against the Randazzos, we find Zepsa is not\r\nentitled to collect this amount from the bond posted by the Randazzos.&nbsp;\r\nSection 29-5-110 of the South Carolina Code governs the release of a lien upon\r\nfiling security.&nbsp; This section provides:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  At any time after service and\r\n  filing of the statement required under Â§ 29-5-90 the owner or any other\r\n  person having an interest in or lien upon the property involved may secure the\r\n  discharge of such property from such lien by filing in the office of clerk of\r\n  court or register of deeds where such lien is filed his written undertaking,\r\n  in an amount equal to one and one-third times the amount claimed in such\r\n  statement, secured by the pledge of United States or State of South Carolina\r\n  securities, by cash or by a surety bond executed by a surety company licensed\r\n  to do business in this State, and upon the filing of such undertaking so\r\n  secured the lien shall be discharged and the cash, securities or surety bond\r\n  deposited shall take the place of the property upon which the lien existed and\r\n  shall be subject to the lien. In the event of judgment for the person\r\n  filing such statement in a suit brought pursuant to the provisions of this\r\n  chapter, such judgment shall be paid out of the cash deposited or, in event of\r\n  pledge of securities, it shall be paid from the proceeds of a sale of so much\r\n  of the pledged securities as shall be necessary to satisfy such judgment or,\r\n  in event of the filing of a surety bond, the surety company issuing such bond\r\n  shall pay such amount found due, not to exceed the amount of the bond.\r\n  . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-110 (Supp.\r\n2004) (emphasis added).&nbsp; This statute allows any person with an interest in\r\nproperty subject to a mechanicâ€™s lien to file a bond releasing the property\r\nfrom the lien.&nbsp; When a lien is released upon the posting of a bond pursuant\r\nto this statute, the effect of the release is to transfer the lien from the\r\nproperty to bond.&nbsp; See Maddux Supply Co. v. Safhi, Inc.,\r\n316 S.C. 404, 412, 450 S.E.2d 101, 105 (Ct. App. 1994).&nbsp;\r\nPrior to trial, the Randazzos posted\r\na $108,461.33 bond in exchange for the release of the mechanicâ€™s lien placed\r\non their property by Zepsa.&nbsp; After the trial and the disposition of Zepsaâ€™s\r\nappeal, Zepsa filed a motion for attachment of the Randazzosâ€™ bond.&nbsp; In\r\nits motion, Zepsa acknowledged the bond was for the purpose of releasing of the\r\nmechanicâ€™s lien pursuant to section 29-5-110.&nbsp; In addition, Zepsa stated\r\nin its motion:&nbsp; â€œThe funds on deposit for the mechanicâ€™s lien released\r\nexceed the amount necessary to pay the liened part of Zepsaâ€™s judgment.&nbsp;\r\nZepsa seeks an order attaching the excess funds so that they may be applied\r\nagainst its personal judgment against the Randazzos, which is not covered by the\r\nlien.â€&nbsp;\r\nThe bond the Randazzos filed may\r\nonly be used to satisfy a judgment awarded pursuant to the provisions of the\r\nmechanicâ€™s lien statutes.&nbsp; Even if Zepsa may recover the $40,000 related\r\nto lost profits and overhead as a personal judgment against the Randazzos, it\r\ncannot seek to recover this amount in an action to attach a mechanicâ€™s lien\r\nbond.4&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn accordance with our findings\r\nabove, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.&nbsp;\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n2 Zepsa Constr., Inc. v.

Thomas Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.\r\n2005-UP-423\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2005 â€“ Filed June 27, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Acting Deputy Chief Attorney\r\n        Wanda H. Carter, of Columbia,\r\n        for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry D.\r\n        McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n        Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney\r\n        General W. Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren Blair\r\n        Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Christopher\r\nJames Reese appeals from his convictions for armed robbery, two counts of\r\ncarjacking, two counts of assault with intent to kill, and one count of\r\npossession of a firearm by a person convicted of a violent crime.&nbsp; Reese\r\nraises two issues on appeal.&nbsp; First, he argues the trial court erred in\r\nadmitting statements he made to police following his arrest.&nbsp; Second, Reese\r\nargues the trial court erred in refusing to grant a continuance. We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nReese robbed a bank in Richland County in December of 2000, while\r\narmed with a pistol.&nbsp; Multiple eyewitnesses saw Reese from the time he\r\nentered the bank until he was placed under arrest.&nbsp; A security video camera\r\nalso recorded the bank robbery.&nbsp; Reese did not wear a mask or anything to\r\nhide his identity.&nbsp;\r\nUpon entering the bank lobby, Reese\r\ndrew a pistol, and demanded that the teller fill his bag with money.&nbsp; The\r\nfirst teller complied, but Reese was unsatisfied with the amount, so he demanded\r\nanother teller to put money in the bag.&nbsp; Reeseâ€™s demeanor was initially\r\ncalm, but when another teller walked in from the back he became nervous and\r\nagitated.&nbsp; When the additional money was placed into the bag, one of the\r\ntellers put a dye pack into the bag with the money.&nbsp; Approximately $5,000\r\nwas taken.&nbsp; Reese then turned and ran out the front door with the bag of\r\nmoney.&nbsp;\r\nOther eyewitnesses saw Reese flee\r\nthrough the parking lot with the bag.&nbsp; Reese ran into a church parking lot\r\nand tried to get into a white SUV waiting there.&nbsp; One of the tellers at the\r\nbank drive-through window had noticed a white SUV parked in front of the bank\r\nshortly before Reese entered.&nbsp; The vehicle drove away before Reese could\r\nget inside, and Reese fell back into the parking lot, still holding the bag.\r\nAfter several unsuccessful\r\ncarjacking attempts, Reese pointed his gun at the driver of a pick-up truck\r\nentering a grocery store parking lot.&nbsp; The driver and his fellow passengers\r\njumped out of the truck and yielded to Reeseâ€™s threats.&nbsp; Reese got in the\r\npick-up truck and exited the parking lot.&nbsp;\r\nA police officer arrived on the\r\nscene and one of the men that had been in the truck pointed to Reese as he was\r\npulling back out onto the highway.&nbsp; The officer activated her emergency\r\nlights and siren and pursued the truck Reese had carjacked.&nbsp; During the\r\nhigh speed chase, he stuck his hand out the window and fired several shots at\r\nthe pursuing officer.&nbsp; Reese also shot twice at another officer he\r\nencountered during the chase.&nbsp;\r\nReese eventually lost control of the\r\ntruck and crashed.&nbsp; Reese was arrested, and the gun was retrieved from the\r\nscene.&nbsp; One of the officers asked Reese for identification, and he told her\r\nhe did not have it with him in case he was caught. &nbsp;\r\nAnother police officer arrived\r\nshortly after the accident and talked to Reese before he was placed into the\r\nambulance.&nbsp; At that time, Reese appeared shaken up, but coherent and able\r\nto communicate.&nbsp; However, a paramedic testified that Reese became very\r\ncombative and uncooperative in the ambulance.&nbsp; The paramedic reported that\r\nReese said things that were illogical.&nbsp; On cross-examination, the paramedic\r\ntestified that it was not unusual for suspects in similar situations to become\r\ncombative and resist after they are restrained, and to voice their\r\ndispleasure.&nbsp; The paramedic was able to get Reeseâ€™s name, social security\r\nnumber, and date of birth from him, and passed this information along to police.\r\nThe investigating officer followed\r\nthe ambulance to the hospital and went with Reese into the emergency room.&nbsp;\r\nThey arrived at the hospital at about 4:30 p.m.&nbsp; The officer again found\r\nReese responsive and coherent.&nbsp; At that time Reese was under arrest and\r\nrestrained with handcuffs.&nbsp;\r\nAt approximately 4:50 p.m. Reese was\r\ngiven 25 mg of Phenergan, a sedating medication.&nbsp; Phenergan generally does\r\nnot alter memory, but can cause drowsiness.\r\nThe officer read Reese read his Miranda[1] rights at about 5:10 p.m. and took\r\nan oral statement shortly thereafter.&nbsp; Reese was excited but communicative\r\nduring the interview.&nbsp; The officer testified that during the interview,\r\nReese responded appropriately to his questions, knew what the officer was\r\ntalking about, and gave intelligent and rational responses.&nbsp; According to\r\nthe officer, Reese understood the Miranda warnings and, of his own\r\nvolition, agreed to speak with the officer.&nbsp; The officer did not threaten\r\nor coerce Reese in any way and did not promise him anything.&nbsp;\r\nReese then told the officer he met\r\nthe driver of the getaway vehicle at a crack house in Greenview.&nbsp; He\r\nidentified the driver as â€œPeanutâ€ and said Peanut had loaned Reese the\r\npistol. &nbsp;He admitted to the carjackings and remembered shooting a\r\ngun.&nbsp; He also said Peanut knew Reese was going to rob something but did not\r\nknow what.&nbsp; Reese told the officer he â€œwas just trying to get away\r\nbecause he didnâ€™t want to go back to prison.â€&nbsp; Reese said he lived for\r\nthree things: money, sex, and cocaine.&nbsp; Reese also gave some background\r\ndetails about himself, his girlfriend, and the driver of the getaway vehicle.\r\nReese told the officer that he had\r\nbeen diagnosed as â€œanti-socialâ€ and had been prescribed Haldol, an\r\nanti-psychotic drug.&nbsp; Reese stated he was not taking the prescribed drug\r\nbecause of the side effects.&nbsp;\r\nAt about 6:00 p.m. Reese was given\r\nan injection of 2 mg of Versed.&nbsp; Versed is a potent, fast-acting\r\nbenzodiazepine that would cause sedation and amnesia for one to three\r\nhours.&nbsp; The medication was administered so that certain medical procedures\r\nand tests could be performed.\r\nAnother officer picked Reese up from\r\nthe hospital at about 10:45 that evening.&nbsp; The charge nurse said Reese was\r\nfit to be physically transported to the jail.&nbsp; Reese walked out of the\r\nhospital with the officer.&nbsp; They arrived at the Sheriffâ€™s department\r\nabout ten minutes later.\r\nThe officer advised Reese of his Miranda\r\nrights around 11:00 p.m.&nbsp; At that time Reese appeared responsive and\r\ncoherent.&nbsp; Reese acknowledged that he understood his rights and signed a\r\nwaiver without any promises, threats, or coercion from the officer.&nbsp; The\r\nofficer then took a second statement from Reese.&nbsp; Reeseâ€™s demeanor during\r\nthe interview was calm and cooperative.&nbsp; Reese did not appear\r\nconfused.&nbsp; The officer wrote down what Reese said, and Reese signed it\r\nafter reviewing it.&nbsp; The officer testified that he had prior experience\r\ninterviewing people with mental problems and he saw nothing to indicate Reese\r\nwas suffering any kinds of symptoms at the time the statement was taken.&nbsp;\r\nThis statement also included several\r\nself-incriminating statements.&nbsp; Reese said he was with an acquaintanceâ€”identified\r\nas Peanutâ€”who supplied Reese with a $20 bag of cocaine. According to Reese,\r\nPeanut was on his way to Charlotte, but he dropped Reese off at the\r\nbank.&nbsp; Reese admitted he grabbed Peanutâ€™s gun out of the glove\r\ncompartment and held up the bank.&nbsp; Reese said some â€œMexican dudesâ€ gave\r\nhim the truck.&nbsp; Reese also admitted to firing the gun at the\r\nofficers.&nbsp;\r\nThe following day, the officer who\r\nhad taken the first statement from Reese in the emergency room saw Reese\r\nagain.&nbsp; Police were still trying to identify the driver of the getaway\r\ncar.&nbsp; The officer picked Reese up from the detention center and drove him\r\nto the Greenview area.&nbsp; Once again, Reese was read, and appeared to\r\nunderstand, his Miranda rights.&nbsp; His mood was calmer than the day\r\nbefore, and somewhat somber.&nbsp; They drove around looking for Peanutâ€™s\r\nhouse, but Reese was unable to identify it.\r\nWhen they returned to the Sheriffâ€™s\r\noffice, the officer read Reese his Miranda rights again.&nbsp; Reese\r\nagain appeared to understand, and signed another waiver.&nbsp; Reese then gave a\r\nthird statement to the police.&nbsp; The content of this statement was\r\nsubstantially consistent with the first two statements.&nbsp;\r\nReese moved prior to trial to\r\nexclude all his statements to the police on the ground that they were not\r\nvoluntary.&nbsp; Donna Schwartz-Watts, a forensic psychiatrist who testified as\r\nan expert witness on Reeseâ€™s behalf, testified Reese was suffering from a\r\nmajor mental illness on the date of the crime.&nbsp;&nbsp; She also believed\r\nReese was suicidal at that time.&nbsp;\r\nDr. William A. Morton, Jr. also\r\ntestified that certain medications Reese took at the hospital might have\r\naffected his thinking.&nbsp; Dr. Morton noted that Reese was in four-point\r\nrestraints and handcuffed when the officer took the first statement in the\r\nemergency room.&nbsp; Reese was administered Phenergan about twenty minutes\r\nbefore that statement was taken.&nbsp; Additionally, Reese was given Versed\r\nabout five hours before the second statement was taken.&nbsp; Dr. Morton opined\r\nthat a personâ€™s ability to make an important decision (whether to give a\r\nstatement to police, for example) could be impaired after receiving the\r\nmedications.&nbsp; Upon inquiry by the trial judge, Dr. Morton clarified that\r\nthis level of impairment lasted about three hours after administration of\r\nVersed.&nbsp; However, he stated that the half-life of Versed is two to five\r\nhours.&nbsp;\r\nReeseâ€™s history of mental problems\r\nbegan shortly after he was committed to the Department of Corrections in\r\n1991.&nbsp; He was diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia and was admitted to the\r\npsychiatric hospital seven times in eight years.&nbsp; When the time came for\r\nReese to be released, the director of Mental Health Services insisted that he be\r\ninvoluntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital because he was believed to be\r\na danger to himself or others.&nbsp; Out of about one thousand inmates released\r\nfrom the Department of Corrections per year, Mental Health Services insists on\r\ninvoluntary commitment in only 12 to 15 cases.&nbsp;\r\nAt his first competency hearing in\r\nDecember of 2001, the experts agreed Reese was not competent to stand\r\ntrial.&nbsp; Reese remained in an extremely psychotic and disorganized state\r\nthroughout 2002.&nbsp; Dr. Schwartz-Watts diagnosed Reese with paranoid\r\nschizophrenia.&nbsp; She based her conclusion on her observations and medical\r\nrecords indicating Reese experienced hallucinations, delusions, and\r\nparanoia.&nbsp; These symptoms included Reese hearing voices, seeing things that\r\nare not real, and exhibiting bizarre behavior.&nbsp;\r\nAt the time of trial, Dr.\r\nSchwartz-Watts and the court-appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Pratap Narayan, agreed\r\nReese was competent to stand trial.&nbsp; However, they disagreed about his\r\ncriminal responsibility on the date of the crime.&nbsp;\r\nDr. Narayan evaluated Reese on\r\nOctober 12, 2001 and October 30, 2002 and concluded Reese had the ability to\r\ndifferentiate right from wrong and the capacity to conform his conduct to the\r\nrequirements of the law at the time of the alleged offense.\r\n&nbsp;Prior to the March 2003 trial,\r\ncounsel for Reese also moved for a continuance because Reese was not able to\r\ndiscuss anything in a coherent manner until February of 2003, about a month\r\nbefore trial.&nbsp; Dr. Schwartz-Watts believed Reese could be found guilty but\r\nmentally ill, but indicated further she was unable to form an opinion on Reeseâ€™s\r\ncriminal responsibility because the difficulty in interviewing Reese.&nbsp; Dr.\r\nSchwartz-Watts told the trial judge she needed two more weeks to make the\r\ndetermination.&nbsp; However, she was unable to provide assurance that the\r\ndetermination could be made within that time frame.&nbsp; Another of Reeseâ€™s\r\nexperts, Dr. Ellen Berg, also testified she was unable to make a determination\r\nabout his criminal responsibility and agreed that two more weeks might be\r\nhelpful.&nbsp;\r\nThe State opposed the motion for a\r\ncontinuance, noting the prior delays and taking the position that Reese could be\r\nmade available every day until and continuing through the term of the\r\ntrial.&nbsp; The State pointed out that the parties had met and scheduled the\r\ncase in January of 2003.&nbsp; The trial judge denied the motion for a\r\ncontinuance, but required the State to make Reese available for further\r\nassessment as discussed.&nbsp;\r\nAt trial, Dr. Schwartz-Watts\r\ntestified she was unable to form an opinion as to whether Reese was not guilty\r\nby reason of insanity.&nbsp; She opined that Reese was experiencing delusions on\r\nthe day of the crime.&nbsp; She testified that the delusion caused Reese to\r\nbelieve he was possessed by a demon, and that only death by the bullet of a\r\npolice officer would get rid of it.&nbsp; She further testified that influences\r\nfrom movies and rap stars had played into his command hallucinations and\r\nreligious delusions.&nbsp; However, she admitted that Reese understood it is\r\nwrong to rob a bank.&nbsp; Dr. Schwartz-Watts also testified that Reese has\r\nperiods of rational thinking, but noted that a person with schizophrenia may\r\nappear rational when they in fact are not.&nbsp;\r\nDr. Narayan also testified at\r\ntrial.&nbsp; Dr. Narayan opined that the mere fact that a person is suffering\r\nfrom a major mental illness does not exempt them from being held responsible for\r\na crime.&nbsp; He testified as to his conclusion that Reese was criminally\r\nresponsible for his actions.&nbsp; Dr. Narayan based his conclusion on two\r\nstatements made to police: (1) Reese told the arresting officer that he was not\r\ncarrying identification because he knew he might be caught; and (2) Reese told\r\nanother officer that he eluded police because he did not want to go back to\r\nprison.&nbsp; Dr. Narayanâ€™s report noted that Reeseâ€™s statements also\r\nestablished a motive for the crimeâ€”to get money to buy more cocaine.&nbsp; He\r\ntestified that although Reese had expressed suicidal ideation, he had never been\r\nknown to attempt suicide.&nbsp; He further saw no evidence that Reese was under\r\nthe influence of a hallucination or a delusion on the date of the crime.&nbsp;\r\nCounsel for Reese renewed the motion\r\nfor a continuance after trial.&nbsp; The trial judge denied the motion.&nbsp;\r\nThe jury found Reese guilty of the various charges and, on appeal, he challenges\r\nthe admission of his statements to the police and the denial of his motion for a\r\ncontinuance.&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nVoluntariness of the Confession\r\nReese first asserts that the\r\nstatements he made to the police must be suppressed because they were not\r\nvoluntary.&nbsp; He maintains the statements were involuntary because he was\r\nsuffering from a mental condition, and because he was under the influence of\r\nmedications administered at the hospital when they were made.&nbsp; We find\r\nevidence supporting the trial courtâ€™s admission of the statements.&nbsp; See\r\nState v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 47, 596 S.E.2d 488, 492 (2004) (â€œOn\r\nappeal, the trial judgeâ€™s ruling as to the voluntariness of the confession\r\nwill not be disturbed unless so erroneous as to constitute an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.â€).&nbsp;\r\nUnder state law, the determination\r\nof voluntariness requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances,\r\nincluding the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.&nbsp; State\r\nv. Franklin, 299 S.C. 133, 138, 382 S.E.2d 911, 914 (1989).&nbsp;\r\nVoluntariness must be proved by the State by a preponderance of the\r\nevidence.&nbsp; Id. at 137, 382 S.E.2d at 913.&nbsp; A confession is not\r\ninadmissible because of a mental deficiency alone.&nbsp; State v. Hughes,\r\n336 S.C. 585, 594, 521 S.E.2d 500, 505 (1999).&nbsp; Furthermore, the fact that\r\na defendant was under medication and in restraints at the time the statement was\r\ntaken is not determinative, but is only a circumstance to consider in\r\ndetermining voluntariness.&nbsp; State v. White, 311 S.C. 289, 294-95,\r\n428 S.E.2d 740, 743 (Ct. App. 1993)\r\nThe trial court found no credible\r\nevidence of police coercion, and the record supports this finding.&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, Reeseâ€™s mental condition alone does not compel a finding of\r\ninvoluntariness.\r\nThe officers uniformly testified\r\nthat Reese appeared coherent and cooperative when each of the statements was\r\ntaken.&nbsp; The questioning began only after Reese was given his Miranda\r\nwarnings.&nbsp; There was no evidence of confusion or irrationality, and his\r\nanswers were responsive to the questions asked.&nbsp; See Id., 311\r\nS.C. at 294, 428 S.E.2d at 743 (finding a statement voluntary when the defendant\r\nwas under medication and in restraints, but was responsive and gave coherent\r\nanswers to questions).&nbsp; In this regard, the record reveals consistency\r\namong the statements and with the testimony of other witnesses.&nbsp; Although\r\nReese suffers from chronic schizophrenia, a thought disorder, there was\r\ntestimony that he has periods of rationality.&nbsp;\r\nWe do recognize that Reese made the\r\ninitial statements after being administered medications at the hospital.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, Reese gave the third statement the next day, free from the effects of\r\nthe medication.&nbsp; The content of the third statement was substantially\r\nconsistent with the previous statements.&nbsp; Additionally, the first statement\r\nwas made before Reese was given the Versed.&nbsp; Reeseâ€™s expert admitted that\r\nPhenergan alone does not alter memory.&nbsp;\r\nThe second statement was taken after\r\nReese returned from the hospital, five hours after he took the Versed.&nbsp;\r\nAgain, however, Reese appeared alert and coherent, and the content of what he\r\nsaid was rational and consistent.&nbsp; The evidence indicates the drugâ€™s\r\ninfluence would have been strongest from two to five hours after he took the\r\ndrug.&nbsp; The statement was taken outside of this window.&nbsp; Thus, there is\r\nevidence to support the finding that neither Reeseâ€™s mental disorder nor the\r\nmedications were sufficient to render his statements involuntary.&nbsp;\r\nFinally, even if the statements were\r\ninvoluntary, the error was harmless.&nbsp; â€œWhen guilt has been conclusively\r\nproven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be\r\nreached, the Court should not set aside a conviction because of insubstantial\r\nerrors not affecting the result.â€&nbsp; State v. Bailey,&nbsp;298 S.C.\r\n1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584&nbsp;(1989).&nbsp; The evidence of guilt was\r\noverwhelming in this case.&nbsp; No circumstantial evidence was needed because\r\nmultiple eyewitnesses testified to all the events for which Reese is\r\ncharged.&nbsp; The police officers testified that the purpose of the statements\r\nwas to apprehend Reeseâ€™s accomplice because no further evidence against Reese\r\nwas needed.&nbsp; Therefore, because guilt could be proven even without the\r\nstatements, any error in admitting them was harmless.&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMotion for a Continuance\r\nReese next argues the trial court\r\nerred in refusing to grant a continuance to allow his experts time to reach a\r\ndefinite conclusion as to his criminal responsibility.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\nâ€œThe granting of a motion for a\r\ncontinuance is a matter resting in the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion and his\r\nruling will not be disturbed without a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.â€&nbsp;\r\nWhite, 311 S.C. at 293, 428 S.E.2d at 742.\r\nHere, the court-appointed expert\r\ndetermined that Reese was not insane when he committed the crimes.&nbsp; Reese\r\nrequested a continuance because his experts desired more time to evaluate\r\nhim.&nbsp; However, she could not guarantee a more definite opinion.&nbsp; We\r\nfind no abuse of discretion in denying the request for a continuance.&nbsp; See\r\nState v. Lewis, 328 S.C. 273, 279, 494 S.E.2d 115, 118 (1997) (holding\r\nthat the defendantâ€™s standoff with police evidenced his sanity, even though\r\nthere was evidence the defendant was â€œout of his mindâ€ and severely\r\ndepressed).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the trial court acted\r\nwithin its discretion in admitting Reeseâ€™s statements and denying his motion\r\nfor a continuance.&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miranda v.

Bryan, Jr, of\r\n        Laurens, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: David Babb\r\nappeals an order permanently restraining him from signing and issuing subpoenas\r\nhimself and temporarily restraining him from having the clerk issue subpoenas on\r\nhis behalf and from contacting Bettie Ann Scott and her employer.&nbsp; We\r\naffirm.[1]\r\nBabb, representing himself, brought\r\nthis action against his former paramour, Scott, and others.&nbsp; In his\r\nvoluminous complaint, Babb alleged that during their relationship he rendered a\r\nnude painting of Scott, which she took after their relationship ended.&nbsp; He\r\nalso alleged Scott, who is an elementary school art teacher, made comments to\r\nothers in the arts community about Babb that damaged his reputation and that she\r\nspread a sexually transmitted disease to him.&nbsp; In the process of pursuing\r\nthe suit, Babb personally signed and issued subpoenas to Scottâ€™s employer,\r\nbanker, and doctor seeking documents.&nbsp;\r\nScott alleged these subpoenas were\r\nunduly burdensome and meant solely to harass, embarrass, and humiliate\r\nher.&nbsp; She asked the court to quash the subpoenas.&nbsp; Additionally, in\r\nher answer to the complaint, she asked for a restraining order to prevent Babb\r\nfrom coming about, contacting, or harassing her.&nbsp; She filed a petition\r\nseeking a restraining order restraining Babb from coming about and harassing her\r\nand â€œfrom indirectly harassing her by sending out invalid subpoenas and\r\nrequesting irrelevant material from persons and from sending printed material\r\nconcerning her to her employer and to other people she is connected with in an\r\nattempt to humiliate and embarrass her.â€&nbsp;\r\nAfter a hearing, the trial court\r\nissued an order temporarily and permanently restraining Babb from issuing and\r\nsigning subpoenas on his own behalf, pursuant to Rule 45, SCRCP.&nbsp; The court\r\nordered Babb was temporarily restrained from having the clerk issue subpoenas on\r\nhis behalf until his deposition is taken.&nbsp; It also restrained Babb from\r\nharassing, coming near Scott, or contacting her employer until the deposition is\r\ntaken.&nbsp; Babb appeals.&nbsp;\r\nLAW AND DISCUSSION\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAppealability\r\nWe first question whether the trial\r\ncourtâ€™s order is immediately appealable.&nbsp; A grant of an injunction is\r\nimmediately appealable.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(4) (Supp.\r\n2004).&nbsp; However, discovery orders are interlocutory and not immediately\r\nappealable.&nbsp; Flagstar Corp. v. Royal Surplus Lines,\r\n341 S.C. 68, 73, 533 S.E.2d 331, 334 (2000) (stating discovery orders are not\r\ndirectly appealable); Lowndes Products, Inc. v.

Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 43, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997) (stating that where\r\ntrial judge did not rule on issue at trial and party did not make a Rule 59,\r\nSCRCP, motion for a ruling, issue is not preserved for appellate review).\r\nEven if we were to consider the\r\ncourtâ€™s remarks on the record as a ruling, we find the issue of the timeliness\r\nof the notice is not preserved as the court only addressed the issue of the\r\nnotice coming from Scottâ€™s counsel rather than the clerkâ€™s office.&nbsp; See\r\nWilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt\r\nis axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but\r\nmust have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\nappellate review.â€).\r\nWe find no merit to Babbâ€™s\r\ncontention that the notice of the hearing was inadequate because it was provided\r\nto him by Scottâ€™s counsel rather than the clerkâ€™s office.&nbsp; Rule 65 (a),\r\nSCRCP, only provides an adverse party must be given notice before the court may\r\nissue a temporary injunction.&nbsp; The rule does not specify that the notice\r\nmust come directly from the clerkâ€™s office.&nbsp; Here, Scott filed her motion\r\nfor an injunction and notice of hearing on the motion with the clerk of courtâ€™s\r\noffice and served the documents on Babb.&nbsp; We find no error in the trial\r\ncourtâ€™s determination that this method provided Babb with adequate notice of\r\nthe hearing.&nbsp;\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nInjunction\r\nBabb argues the trial court erred in\r\ngranting Scott injunctive relief and in suspending his subpoenas.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.&nbsp;\r\nThe granting of an injunction is\r\ndiscretionary and the appellate court will not disturb the conclusions of the\r\ntrial court unless there has been an abuse of discretion showing the order is\r\nclearly erroneous.&nbsp; Gilley v. Gilley, 327 S.C. 8, 12, 488 S.E.2d\r\n310, 312 (1997).&nbsp; Similarly, â€œ[t]he rulings of a trial judge in matters\r\ninvolving discovery will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an\r\nabuse of discretion.â€&nbsp; Bayle v. South\r\nCarolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 128-29, 542 S.E.2d 736, 742-43\r\n(Ct.App.2001).&nbsp; An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial judgeâ€™s\r\nruling is based upon an error of law or, when based on factual conclusions, is\r\nwithout evidentiary support.&nbsp; An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial\r\njudgeâ€™s ruling is based upon an error of law or, when based on factual\r\nconclusions, is without evidentiary support.&nbsp; Id.\r\nIt is uncontested that Babb issued\r\nsubpoenas signed by him, rather than having them signed and issued by the Clerk\r\nof Court and thus was in violation of Rule 45, SCRCP.[2]&nbsp; Thus, we find no error in the trial court\r\nordering that he be temporarily and permanently restrained from issuing and\r\nsigning subpoenas on his own behalf.&nbsp;\r\nWe also find no abuse of discretion\r\nin the trial courtâ€™s order restraining Babb from having the clerk issue\r\nfurther subpoenas on his behalf, harassing Scott, and contacting her employer\r\nuntil after his deposition is taken.&nbsp;\r\nAs the trial court found:\r\n\r\n  It is&nbsp; . . . evident that\r\n  [Babb] had contact with [Scottâ€™s] employer, which could affect her job.\r\n  The parties acknowledge that there\r\n  is scheduled for July 15, 2004, a deposition of [Babb] after which time the\r\n  issues can hopefully be narrowed and more clearly stated.\r\n  This Court finds that the\r\n  voluminous Complaint in this matter makes it difficult to determine what the\r\n  issues are.&nbsp; Further, [Babb] informed the Court at the motion hearing\r\n  that he was filing and Amended Complaint, although there is no order\r\n  permitting said amendment.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not permanently\r\nprohibit Babb from having the clerk issue subpoenas on his behalf in this\r\nlitigation.&nbsp; Rather, the court merely restrained him doing so until after\r\nhis deposition in an attempt to have Babbâ€™s claims clarified so that the court\r\ncould better determine whether the information Babb sought, which was of a\r\nhighly personal nature, was relevant to his claims and thus properly\r\ndiscoverable.&nbsp; We find no abuse of discretion in this action.&nbsp;\r\nBabb argues the trial court erred in\r\ngranting the temporary injunction because an adequate remedy of law\r\nexists.&nbsp; He also contends the trial court erred in granting the temporary\r\ninjunction without requesting the undertaking of a bond.&nbsp; The trial court\r\naddressed neither of these issues in its order and Babb failed to file a Rule\r\n59, SCRCP motion requesting the court rule on them.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find\r\nthese issues are not preserved for our review.&nbsp; See Summer v.\r\nCarpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 43, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997) (stating that where\r\ntrial judge did not rule on issue at trial and party did not make a Rule 59,\r\nSCRCP, motion for a ruling, issue is not preserved for appellate review).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the\r\ntrial courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n[2] Rule 45, SCRCP provides subpoenas shall be signed and issued by\r\nthe clerk of court or by an attorney as an officer of the court.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-425","title":"Reid v.

Dunn, 298 S.C. 499, 502, 381 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1989) (â€œA trial\r\ncourt judgeâ€™s rulings on discovery matters will not be disturbed on appeal\r\nabsent a clear abuse of discretion.â€ (citing Hook v.

Slocumb, 336 S.C. 619,\r\n626-27, 521 S.E.2d 507, 511 (Ct. App. 1999).&nbsp; No abuse of discretion\r\noccurred here, particularly since the record shows the conclusions formed by the\r\nexperts in question formed no part of the â€œunderlying facts or dataâ€ that\r\nsupported Byersâ€™ opinion.[4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court committed no reversible error in failing to allow Maytag to call\r\nthe two experts whom the Reids informally consulted to testify as to the cause\r\nof the fire and the condition of the dryer because, even assuming this was\r\nerror, Maytag suffered no prejudice.&nbsp; See, e.g., Fields v. Regâ€™l\r\nMed. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509&nbsp;(2005) (â€œTo\r\nwarrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant\r\nmust prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., that\r\nthere is a reasonable probability the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the\r\nchallenged evidence or the lack thereof.â€); Fishburne v. Short, 268\r\nS.C. 546, 550, 235 S.E.2d 118, 120 (1977) (holding an error without prejudice\r\ndoes not warrant reversal).&nbsp; Maytag offered four witnesses of its own who\r\ntestified about the cause of the fire and the condition of the dryer.&nbsp; Any\r\nadditional testimony would have been merely cumulative.&nbsp; See Fields,\r\n363 S.C. at 31, 609 S.E.2d at 512 (â€œWhen evidence is erroneously excluded by\r\nthe trial court, the appellate court usually engages in the following analysis\r\nto determine whether prejudice has occurred.&nbsp; First, the court considers, inter\r\nalia, whether the error may be deemed harmless because equivalent or\r\ncumulative evidence or testimony was offered . . . .â€).&nbsp;\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court committed no abuse of discretion in allowing the Reids to\r\npresent evidence regarding the condition of the dryer at trial without requiring\r\nthem to establish a chain of custody and committed no error in declining to\r\ninstruct the jury regarding chain of custody because the evidence at issue, the\r\ndryer, is a non-fungible item.&nbsp; State v.

The causes of action arise from Joseph Pantherâ€™s sale of the\r\ncoupleâ€™s marital residence to Catto Enterprises.&nbsp; The trial court denied\r\nAppellantâ€™s claims for relief. &nbsp;We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe present dispute originates from\r\nthe marital difficulties of Joseph and Dianne Panther.&nbsp; The couple has been\r\nmarried for over 35 years, and, based on the record before us, continued to be\r\nmarried throughout the course of this litigation and remain married today.\r\nThis case centers around Josephâ€™s\r\ndecision to sell or otherwise transfer ownership of the coupleâ€™s home during a\r\nperiod of marital discord.&nbsp; The property, which consists of a house and\r\nfourteen acres of land, was purchased by Joseph Panther several years after the\r\ncouple married.&nbsp; It is titled solely in Josephâ€™s name.&nbsp; This home\r\nwasâ€”and remainsâ€”the Panthersâ€™ marital residence.&nbsp;\r\nIn the 1990s, Joseph engaged in an\r\nextramarital affair.&nbsp; He grew increasingly concerned Dianne would discover\r\nthe affair and claim an interest in the marital residence as part of an\r\nanticipated divorce proceeding.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph turned to a friend, Ron\r\nAvenger, for advice on how to prevent Dianne from acquiring the property should\r\nshe initiate a divorce action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs it happened, Avenger was uniquely\r\npositioned to help Joseph in this regard.&nbsp; At the time, Avenger was a\r\nlicensed real estate broker working for Catto Enterprises, L.L.C., a small\r\nconcern owned and managed by Michael and Phillip Catto.&nbsp; Part of\r\nAvengerâ€™s job at the firm was to identify potential investment properties for\r\nCatto Enterprises. &nbsp;He saw such an opportunity in Joseph Pantherâ€™s\r\nsituation.\r\nAvenger subsequently arranged a\r\nmeeting between Joseph and the Cattos.&nbsp; At the meeting, according to\r\nPhillip Cattoâ€™s testimony, Joseph made plain his objective: to â€œshaftâ€ his\r\nwife on the house because he was leaving her for another woman.&nbsp; Michael\r\nCatto similarly testified Joseph informed him he â€œwas living with another\r\nwoman and that he felt like when [Dianne] found out . . . she probably would\r\nleave him.â€&nbsp;\r\nUltimately, a deal was struckâ€”though\r\nthe basic terms of the agreement are contested.&nbsp; According to Joseph, the\r\nCattos agreed to â€œhold my house in trust until I could come back and get it or\r\nwanted it backâ€ in exchange for $45,000 cash Joseph purportedly paid to the\r\nCattos.&nbsp; Avengerâ€™s testimony supports Josephâ€™s claim that the property\r\nwas to be held by the Cattos in some type of trust arrangement for the benefit\r\nof Joseph:&nbsp; â€œMike [Catto] said, well, you know, we can hold it and just\r\ntransfer it to me and Iâ€™ll give you a letter saying that you can get it back\r\nany time you want to.â€&nbsp; The Cattos, however, assert they made no such\r\nagreement to return the property.&nbsp; Rather, the Cattos maintain they agreed\r\nto&nbsp; purchase the property for $45,000.&nbsp;\r\nNo written sales agreement was\r\nexecuted.&nbsp; However, with the aid of an attorney, the parties agreed to\r\neffect the transaction and proceed with a real estate closing.&nbsp; At the\r\nclosing, Catto Enterprises issued two checks totaling $45,000.&nbsp; Michael, on\r\nbehalf of Catto Enterprises, wrote one check to the closing attorney for the\r\npayoff amount for Josephâ€™s mortgage plus the closing costs, and another to\r\nJoseph for the balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCatto Enterprises promptly mortgaged\r\nthe property, appraised at $145,500, to secure a $100,000 line of credit with\r\nCarolina Southern Bank.&nbsp;\r\nThe Panthers were thereafter\r\ninvolved in the anticipated family court litigation wherein Dianne sought an\r\nequitable interest in the marital residence as part of the division of the\r\nmarital estate.&nbsp; Following the trial in this caseâ€”as stipulated in the\r\nbriefs and conceded at oral argumentâ€”the Panthers reconciled and the family\r\ncourt proceeding was dismissed.&nbsp; Again, the record before us reveals that\r\nthe Panthers continue to reside together as husband and wife.&nbsp;\r\nThis Action\r\nDianne filed this action against\r\nJoseph, Avenger, Michael and Phillip Catto, Catto Enterprises, and Carolina\r\nSouthern Bank.&nbsp; She alleged civil conspiracy against all defendants, except\r\nCarolina Southern Bank, and requested the trial court declare a resulting trust\r\nor, in the alternative, a constructive trust in her favor.&nbsp;\r\nA bench trial was held on all three\r\nclaims.&nbsp; Although the Panthers are now reconciled, at the time of the\r\ntrial, Dianne and Joseph were separated and had a divorce action pending.&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court found for the defendants on all causes of action.&nbsp; Dianne\r\nfiled a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\nwhich the trial court denied.&nbsp; This appeal followed.&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Civil Conspiracy\r\nDianne argues the trial court erred\r\nin finding Joseph, Avenger, Michael and Phillip Catto, and Catto Enterprises not\r\nliable for civil conspiracy.&nbsp; Although we find the trial court erred in\r\nruling that only unlawful acts may give rise to a conspiracy claim, the\r\ndismissal of the family court litigation precludes her from establishing the\r\nnecessary element of special damages.&nbsp;\r\nâ€œIt is well-settled in South\r\nCarolina that the tort of civil conspiracy contains three elements: (1) a\r\ncombination of two or more persons; (2) for the purpose of injuring the\r\nplaintiff; (3) causing plaintiff special damage.â€&nbsp; Kuznik v.\r\nBees Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 610, 538 S.E.2d 15, 31 (Ct. App.\r\n2000).&nbsp; â€œIn order to establish a conspiracy, evidence, either direct or\r\ncircumstantial, must be produced from which a party may reasonably infer the\r\njoint assent of the minds of two or more parties to the prosecution of the\r\nunlawful enterprise.â€&nbsp; First Union Natâ€™l Bank of South\r\nCarolina v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 575, 511 S.E.2d 372, 383 (Ct. App.\r\n1998).[1]\r\nIn its order, the trial court\r\nstated:&nbsp; â€œThere can be no conspiracy established where the acts\r\ncomplained of, and the means employed in doing the act, are lawful, and so long\r\nas the parties seek only to further their own fair interests.â€&nbsp; This\r\nlegal conclusion is in error.&nbsp; From a factual standpoint, the trial court\r\nfound Michael and Phillip were aware of Josephâ€™s intent to defraud his spouse\r\nof any interest she may have had in the property, and the record supports this\r\nfinding.&nbsp; However, the trial court further found that â€œthe desire [of the\r\nCattos] to further their own self-interest was the predominate motive for the\r\nCattos participating in the transaction, and that the fact that it would also\r\nâ€˜benefitâ€™ Mr. Panther was of no consequence to the Defendants, Catto.â€&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nâ€œA civil conspiracy may, of\r\ncourse, be furthered by an unlawful act.&nbsp; However, an unlawful act is not a\r\nnecessary element of the tort.&nbsp; An action for conspiracy may lie even\r\nthough no unlawful means are used and no independently unlawful acts are\r\ncommitted.â€&nbsp; Lee v. Chesterfield Gen. Hosp., Inc., 289\r\nS.C. 6, 11, 344 S.E.2d 379, 382 (Ct. App. 1986) (citations omitted).&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, the trial court incorrectly stated a lawful act or lawful means can\r\nnever form the basis of a civil conspiracy claim.&nbsp; In addition, the trial\r\ncourt concluded that, because the Cattos were motivated by profit, they did not\r\nact for the purpose of injuring Dianne.&nbsp; We do not view the Cattosâ€™\r\nprofit-motive as mutually exclusive from their intent to harm Dianne.&nbsp;\r\nGaining a profit or other form of self-interest lies at the heart of virtually\r\nevery conspiracy scheme.&nbsp; Here, the Cattos were aware of the harm to Dianne\r\nupon purchasing the property, regardless of their concomitant desire to profit\r\nfrom the transaction.&nbsp; The intent element necessary to establish a civil\r\nconspiracy is clearly met.&nbsp;\r\nWe nevertheless find Dianneâ€™s\r\ncivil conspiracy claim must fail.&nbsp; Specifically, we find Dianne cannot\r\nsatisfy the requirement of proving special damages to establish her civil\r\nconspiracy claim because she cannot establish a cognizable interest in the\r\nproperty.&nbsp; Rule 220(c), SCACR, provides:&nbsp; â€œThe appellate court may\r\naffirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record\r\non Appeal.â€&nbsp;\r\nSection 20-7-471 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2004), dealing with a spouseâ€™s acquisition of a special\r\nequity interest and ownership right in marital property, provides:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  During the marriage a spouse shall\r\n  acquire, based upon the factors set out in Â§ 20-7-472, a vested special\r\n  equity and ownership right in the marital property as defined in Â§ 20-7-473,\r\n  which equity and ownership right are subject to apportionment between the\r\n  spouses by the family courts of this State at the time marital litigation\r\n  is filed or commenced as provided in Â§ 20-7-472.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).&nbsp; In Prosser\r\nv. Pee Dee State Bank, 295 S.C. 212, 367 S.E.2d 698 (1988),\r\nthe South Carolina Supreme Court interpreted this statute.&nbsp; The supreme\r\ncourt determined:\r\n\r\n  The â€œownership rightâ€ in â€œmarital\r\n  propertyâ€ is acquired during marriage.&nbsp; â€œMarital propertyâ€ as such\r\n  does not exist until the date when marital litigation is filed or\r\n  commenced.&nbsp; The â€œownership rightâ€ in â€œmarital propertyâ€, then,\r\n  cannot attach until that property is created by the filing of marital\r\n  litigation.\r\n\r\nId. at 214, 367 S.E.2d at 700\r\n(citation omitted).&nbsp; Further, in regard to this section, we stated: â€œBy\r\nrequiring the estate to be identified as of the date marital litigation is\r\nfiled, the Legislature has elected to foreclose the spouses from litigating\r\nevery expenditure or transfer of property during the marriage.â€&nbsp; Panhorst\r\nv. Panhorst, 301 S.C. 100, 105, 390 S.E.2d 376, 379 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1990).&nbsp;\r\nJoseph solely held title to the\r\nproperty sold to Catto Enterprises.&nbsp; Therefore, for purposes of this\r\naction, Dianne asserted she owned an equitable interest in the property as\r\nmarital property.&nbsp; However, because the marital litigation between Joseph\r\nand Dianne was dismissed, her purported interest in the property was never\r\njudicially determined.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, Dianneâ€™s lack of a recognized\r\ninterest in the property warrants the conclusion as a matter of law that she\r\ncannot establish the damage component of the civil conspiracy claim.&nbsp;\r\nAppellantâ€™s counsel, however,\r\nargues a finding that Dianne suffered no special damage or injury is untenable\r\nin light of this courtâ€™s ruling in Brown v. Butler, 347 S.C. 259, 554\r\nS.E.2d 431 (Ct. App. 2001).&nbsp; In that case, a husband and wife had a falling\r\nout and separated.&nbsp; The wife told her husband that she would take legal\r\naction â€œto get what rightfully belonged to her and their children.â€ Id.\r\nat 261, 554 S.E.2d at 432.&nbsp; Before she could take such action, however, the\r\nhusband deeded to his sister a three-acre parcel of real property he acquired\r\nduring the marriage.&nbsp; The husband died intestate before any of the\r\nthreatened marital litigation was commenced.&nbsp; The wife subsequently brought\r\nan action to set aside the deed to the husbandâ€™s sister, claiming the transfer\r\nof property violated the Statute of Elizabeth. Id. at 262, 554 S.E.2d at\r\n432.&nbsp; This statute reads, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  Every gift, grant, alienation,\r\n  bargain, transfer, and conveyance of lands, . . . by writing or otherwise . .\r\n  . which may be had or made to or for any intent or purpose to . . . defraud\r\n  creditors and others of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts, accounts,\r\n  damages, penalties, and forfeitures must be deemed . . . to be clearly and\r\n  utterly void . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-23-10 (Supp.\r\n2004).&nbsp; Applying this provision, the trial court set aside the deed.&nbsp;\r\nOn appeal, we affirmed the lower courtâ€™s ruling:\r\n\r\n  We hold, however, an estranged\r\n  wife in [the respondentâ€™s] position has a sufficient interest in property\r\n  titled in her husbandâ€™s name to set aside a conveyance that could adversely\r\n  affect her claims for separate support and maintenance, for alimony, or for an\r\n  equitable division of the marital property.&nbsp; Even if not a â€œcreditor,â€\r\n  an estranged wife would fall within the phrase â€œand others,â€ a phrase that\r\n  the statute also uses and refers to â€œpersons who, like creditors, have\r\n  causes of action which may be prejudicially affected by a transfer of assets\r\n  by one against whom the right of action exists.â€\r\n\r\nBrown, 347 S.C. at 264, 554 S.E.2d at 433 (footnotes\r\nomitted).&nbsp;\r\nWe find the rule set out in Brown\r\nis inapplicable under the distinct facts and circumstances of the instant case.[2]&nbsp; The present case comes to us\r\nin a fundamentally different posture than that of Brown.&nbsp; Unlike the\r\nestranged wife in Brown, Dianne Panther continues to live in the full\r\ncommunion of marriage with Joseph.&nbsp; All marital litigation between the two\r\nwas abandoned, and they are reconciled, living together as husband and\r\nwife.&nbsp; On the other hand, the marital litigation in Brown was\r\nimminent.&nbsp; The facts of that case reveal the wife had actually begun the\r\nprocess of initiating legal action, though such action was not perfected prior\r\nto the husbandâ€™s death.[3]&nbsp; In\r\naddition, the wife in Brown sought to have title to the subject property\r\nreturned to her husbandâ€”specifically, his estateâ€”so that her rights in the\r\ndistribution of the estate could be protected.&nbsp; In the present case, Dianne\r\ndid not seek to have title restored to Joseph or otherwise preserve the asset\r\nfor ultimate determination of ownership rights in the family court.&nbsp;\r\nRather, Dianne is seeking damages while continuing in the marital relationship\r\nwith no present contemplation of marital litigation.&nbsp; Therefore, it cannot\r\nbe said that Dianne occupies a position analogous to that of a â€œcreditorâ€ as\r\nfound in Brown and as contemplated under the Statute of Elizabeth.&nbsp;\r\nWe therefore conclude Appellantâ€™s\r\nreliance on Brown is misplaced, and find her claim for civil conspiracy\r\nmust fail for lack of showing special damages.[4]\r\nII.&nbsp; Constructive Trust\r\nNext, Dianne argues the trial court\r\nerred by not imposing a constructive trust on the property Joseph sold to the\r\nCattos.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nAn action to declare a constructive\r\ntrust is an action in equity, and thus, an appellate court may find the facts in\r\naccordance with its own view of the evidence.&nbsp; Macaulay v. Wachovia Bank\r\nof South Carolina, N.A., 351 S.C. 287, 294, 569 S.E.2d 371,\r\n375 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; To establish a constructive trust, the evidence must\r\nbe clear and unequivocal.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  A constructive trust arises\r\n  whenever circumstances under which property was acquired make it inequitable\r\n  that it be retained by the one holding legal title.&nbsp; These circumstances\r\n  include fraud, bad faith, abuse of confidence, or violation of a fiduciary\r\n  duty which gives rise to an obligation in equity to make restitution.\r\n\r\nHendrix v. Hendrix, 299 S.C.\r\n233, 235, 383 S.E.2d 468, 469 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nAt the time Dianne filed this\r\naction, Catto Enterprises held legal title to the property and Carolina Southern\r\nBank held an undisputedly valid mortgage on the property.&nbsp; Based on our\r\nreview of the record, we find Dianne failed to establish facts entitling her to\r\nrelief under a constructive trust theory.&nbsp; Specifically, we find no\r\nconfidential relationship existed between Dianne and the Cattos or Catto\r\nEnterprises.&nbsp; We further concur in the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that, â€œif\r\na constructive trust were to be imposed under the facts of this case, every sale\r\nof property solely owned by one spouse would be subject to the imposition of an\r\nequitable lien in favor of the non-owning spouse who was not in agreement with\r\nthe sale . . . . This requirement would impose an unreasonable impediment to the\r\norderly transfer of real estate in the market.â€&nbsp;\r\nA constructive trust may also be\r\nimposed against someone who withholds property from someone who is beneficially\r\nentitled to it.&nbsp; See SSI Med. Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301\r\nS.C. 493, 500, 392 S.E.2d 789, 793-94 (1990) (holding that â€œ[a] constructive\r\ntrust arises whenever a party has obtained money which does not equitably belong\r\nto him and which he cannot in good conscience retain or withhold from another\r\nwho is beneficially entitled to it . . . .â€).&nbsp; As discussed above, Dianne\r\ndid notâ€”and does notâ€”have a cognizable ownership interest in the property,\r\nand therefore was not beneficially entitled to the property.&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, if we were to impose a\r\nconstructive trust under these facts, the benefit of the constructive trust\r\nwould flow only indirectly to Dianne.&nbsp; The imposition of a trust would\r\nrequire a return of the property to the prior owner of the property, Joseph, who\r\ninstigated the plan to â€œshaftâ€ Dianne.&nbsp; â€œThe law will not permit a\r\nparty to deliberately put his property out of his control for a fraudulent\r\npurpose, and then, through intervention of a court of equity, regain the same\r\nafter his fraudulent purpose has been accomplished.â€&nbsp; All v. Prillaman,\r\n200 S.C. 279, 308, 20 S.E.2d 741, 753 (1942) (quoting Jolly v. Graham, 78\r\nN.E. 919, 920 (Ill. 1906)).\r\n&nbsp; For these reasons, we find\r\nthe trial court properly denied Dianneâ€™s request for the imposition of a\r\nconstructive trust on the property.&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that Dianne Pantherâ€™s\r\nclaim for civil conspiracy must fail because she failed to prove special\r\ndamages.&nbsp; We also concur in the trial courtâ€™s denial of her request for\r\nthe imposition of a constructive trust.&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and\r\nWILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; â€œAn action for civil conspiracy is an action at law, and\r\nthe trial judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld on appeal unless they are without\r\nevidentiary support.â€&nbsp; Gynecology Clinic, Inc. v. Cloer, 334\r\nS.C. 555, 556, 514 S.E.2d 592, 592-93 (1999).&nbsp; Although an action for civil\r\nconspiracy is normally an action at law, the character of the action as legal or\r\nequitable depends on the relief sought.&nbsp; First Union, 333 S.C. at\r\n574, 511 S.E.2d at 382 (noting that in an action for civil conspiracy, â€œ[w]hen\r\nequitable relief is sought . . . the action is one in equityâ€).&nbsp; Our\r\nreview of the claimed legal error is plenary in nature regardless of the\r\ncharacterization of Dianneâ€™s complaint as primarily legal or primarily\r\nequitable.\r\n[2] In addressing Dianne Pantherâ€™s resort to and reliance upon the\r\nrule set out in Brown v. Butler, we initially note that, in the present\r\ncase, no issue or argument was raised to the trial court concerning the Statute\r\nof Elizabeth.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we find it proper to address the applicability\r\nof this case and rule in light of our decision to affirm the trial courtâ€™s\r\nruling on the additional sustaining ground concerning the failure to show\r\nspecial damage or injury.\r\n[3] In Brown, the wife hired an attorney who began preparing\r\nthe filings for her case.&nbsp; Before the commencement of the suit could occur,\r\nhowever, the wifeâ€™s attorney lost his privilege to practice law in South\r\nCarolina, forcing the wife to retrieve her file and seek legal assistance\r\nelsewhere.&nbsp; Her husband died shortly thereafter.&nbsp; Brown, 347\r\nS.C. at 261-62, 554 S.E.2d at 432.\r\n[4]&nbsp; We find a remand to the circuit court inappropriate and\r\nunnecessary.&nbsp; First, a remand is not requested as a result of the dismissal\r\nof the family court action and Appellantâ€™s concomitant forfeiture of her\r\ncognizable interest in the property.&nbsp; The information is presented to us\r\nonly in the context of an additional sustaining ground.&nbsp; Second, a remand\r\nwould be an exercise in futility in light of Appellantâ€™s abandonment of the\r\nfamily court action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
