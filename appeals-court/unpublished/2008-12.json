Heath, 370 S.C. 326, 329, 635 S.E.2d 18, 19 (2006)\r\n  (holding constructive possession can be proven through direct or circumstantial\r\n  evidence).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  HUFF, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-672","title":"State v.

Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-230 (2007) (enabling a prisoner to earn credit toward\r\n  early release by participating in productive work or education programs while\r\n  incarcerated); Busby v. Moore, 330 S.C. 201, 204, 498 S.E.2d 883, 884\r\n  (1998) (holding earned credits may not be applied to a prisonerâ€™s sentence\r\n  until after they have been earned), overruled on other grounds by Al-Shabazz\r\n    v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000).Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; As\r\n  to whether the ALC erred in finding substantial evidence supported the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s performance of its calculations in a routine and good-faith\r\n  exercise of its administrative duties:Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections v.\r\n    Mitchell, 377 S.C. 256, 259, 659 S.E.2d 233, 235 (Ct. App. 2008) (quoting Waters\r\n      v. S.C. Land Res.

Elliott,\r\n  Assistant Attorney General Christina J. Catoe, and Solicitor Warren Blair\r\n  Giese, all of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Clifton Suber pled guilty to three counts of uttering\r\n  a fraudulent check of more than $1,000 and one count of bank fraud. The plea\r\n  judge sentenced Suber to ten years on one of the fraudulent check charges; a\r\n  consecutive term of ten years on another, suspended with five years probation;\r\n  and concurrent sentences of ten years suspended during probation on the\r\n  remaining fraudulent check charge and five years suspended during probation on\r\n  the bank fraud charge.&nbsp; The plea judge further directed Suber would\r\n  receive no credit for time served. Suber appeals, arguing he is entitled to\r\n  credit for time spent in custody awaiting trial and/or sentence.&nbsp; We\r\n  remand.\r\nII.&nbsp; FACTS\r\nSuber\r\n  pled to the above Richland County charges on January 30, 2007.&nbsp; During the\r\n  plea hearing, he informed the judge he had been in jail â€œon these chargesâ€ for\r\n  about a year.&nbsp; Defense counsel corrected that Suber â€œwas in on a Lexington\r\n  County fraudulent check charge also,â€ but stated the charges were â€œall\r\n  related.â€&nbsp; The Lexington County charge resulted in Suberâ€™s imprisonment\r\n  for a term of one year and six months in the Department of Corrections, which\r\n  he began serving on August 30, 2006.&nbsp; She explained that prior to August\r\n  30, 2006, Suber had been incarcerated â€œabout three monthsâ€ on both the Richland\r\n  and Lexington County charges.&nbsp; She requested the court consider backdating\r\n  Suberâ€™s sentence to August 30, 2006, â€œand possibly giving him credit for the\r\n  time prior to thatâ€ of â€œroughlyâ€ three months.&nbsp; The plea judge stated, â€œI\r\n  assume whatever he has done since August he is getting credit for on the\r\n  existing sentence.â€&nbsp; Defense counsel confirmed that he was.&nbsp; The plea\r\n  judge then sentenced Suber as described above and concluded with the statement,\r\n  â€œNo credit for time served.â€&nbsp; This appeal followed.\r\nIII.&nbsp; LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Suber contends the plea judge erred in ruling he would receive no credit\r\n  for time spent in custody awaiting trial and/or sentence.&nbsp; Specifically,\r\n  Suber asserts it is apparent from the record that he was entitled to credit for\r\n  time spent in custody prior to his commencement of serving the one year and six\r\n  month sentence on August 30, 2006, i.e. â€œabout three months.â€&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nSection\r\n  24-13-40 of the South Carolina Code provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  every case in computing the time served by a prisoner, full credit against the\r\n  sentence shall be given for time served prior to trial and\r\n  sentencing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Provided, however, that credit for time served\r\n  prior to trial and sentencing shall not be given:&nbsp; (1) when the prisoner\r\n  at the time he was imprisoned prior to trial was an escapee from another penal\r\n  institution; or (2) when the prisoner is serving a sentence for one offense and\r\n  is awaiting trial and sentence for a second offense in which case he shall not\r\n  receive credit for time served prior to trial in a reduction of his sentence\r\n  for the second offense.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-40 (2007)\r\n  (emphasis in original).&nbsp; â€œSection 23-13-40 mandates a prisoner be given\r\n  credit for all time served prior to trial unless one of two exceptions\r\n  exist:&nbsp; 1) either the prisoner was an escapee or 2) the prisoner was\r\n  already serving a sentence on one offense.â€&nbsp; Allen v. State, 339\r\n  S.C. 393, 395, 529 S.E.2d 541, 542 (2000).&nbsp; The matter of credit for time\r\n  served under this statute is not discretionary with the trial court.&nbsp; State\r\n    v. McCord, 349 S.C. 477, 487, 562 S.E.2d 689, 694 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; \r\nBecause\r\n  Suber was neither an escapee nor serving any sentence during the approximate\r\n  three-month period he was incarcerated prior to his August 30 imprisonment on\r\n  the Lexington County charge, he is entitled to credit for time served on the\r\n  Richland County charges.&nbsp; See Allen, 339 S.C. at 395-96, 529\r\n  S.E.2d at 542 (holding where appellant pled to five offenses resulting from two\r\n  separate arrests, he was entitled to credit for time served on first charges\r\n  from time he was re-arrested on second charges and bond was revoked on first\r\n  charges, as he was clearly in custody on all charges from the date of\r\n  re-arrest);&nbsp; Blakeney v. State, 339 S.C. 86, 88, 529 S.E.2d 9,\r\n  10-11 (2000) (noting our courts have held â€œâ€˜time servedâ€™ in Â§ 24-13-40 means\r\n  the time during which a defendant is in pre-trial confinement and charged\r\n  with the offense for which he is sentenced (so long as he is not serving time\r\n  for a prior conviction).â€) (emphasis in original). \r\nThe\r\n  record before us does not contain any evidence of the exact amount of time Suber\r\n  spent in jail awaiting trial and sentencing prior to imposition of his\r\n  Lexington sentence.&nbsp; Accordingly, we remand for the plea court to\r\n  determine the exact amount of time Suber served on the Richland charges prior\r\n  to commencement of his Lexington sentence.&nbsp; \r\nREMANDED.[1]\r\nHEARN, C.J., KONDUROS, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Because oral argument would not aid the court\r\n  in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-681","title":"State v.

Shupe, all of Columbia; Solicitor Harold W.\r\n  Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Hardy\r\n  Lassiter was convicted of two counts of armed robbery, two counts of possession\r\n  of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and two counts of\r\n  pointing and/or presenting a firearm.Â  On appeal, Lassiter argues the trial\r\n  court erred in (1) refusing to suppress the clothing worn during the commission\r\n  of the alleged robberies and (2) refusing to charge the jury on â€œmere presence.â€\r\n  Â We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220, SCACR, and the following\r\n  authorities:\r\n1.Â  The trial court did not\r\n  err refusing to suppress Lassiterâ€™s clothing because police seized the clothing\r\n  while Lassiter was in police custody following a lawful arrest.Â  U.S. v.\r\n    Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 224 (1973) (â€œIt is well settled that a search\r\n  incident to a lawful arrest is a traditional exception to the warrant\r\n  requirement of the Fourth Amendment.â€); U.S. v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800,\r\n  803-04 (1974) (â€œ[B]oth the person and the property in his immediate possession\r\n  may be searched at the station house after the arrest has occurred at another\r\n  place and if evidence of crime is discovered, it may be seized and admitted in\r\n  evidence.Â  Nor is there any doubt that clothing or other belongings may be\r\n  seized upon arrival of the accused at the place of detention and later\r\n  subjected to laboratory analysis or that the test results are admissible at\r\n  trial.â€); Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 528 (1984) (holding a prisonerâ€™s\r\n  expectation of privacy is diminished as a consequence of confinement).Â  \r\n2.Â  The trial court did not\r\n  err in failing to instruct the jury on â€œmere presenceâ€ because the evidence\r\n  presented at trial did not support such an instruction.Â  State v. Lee-Grigg,\r\n  374 S.C. 388, 405-06, 649 S.E.2d 41, 50 (Ct. App. 2007) (holding a trial court\r\n  has a duty to give a requested instruction that is supported by the evidence\r\n  and correctly states the law applicable to the issues);Â  State v. Stokes,\r\n  339 S.C. 154, 163, 528 S.E.2d 430, 434 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding a mere presence\r\n  instruction is applicable if there is a doubt over whether the defendant is\r\n  guilty as an accomplice to a crime); State v. Dennis, 321 S.C. 413, 420,\r\n  468 S.E.2d 674, 678 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding mere presence applies where the\r\n  defendant is charged with possession of contraband as a result of being present\r\n  where contraband was found); State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 55, 625\r\n  S.E.2d 216, 223 (2006) (â€œWhen guilt is conclusively proven by competent\r\n  evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached, this [c]ourt\r\n  will not set aside a conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting the\r\n  resultâ€).Â  We believe neither mere presence situation applies to the present\r\n  case, and in any event believe the State proved Lassiterâ€™s guilt conclusively\r\n  by competent evidence.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-689","title":"State v.

Harris, as Personal Representative and sole heir and devisee\r\n  of the Estate of Eloise P. Harris, and Judy P. Singleton (collectively\r\n  â€œRespondentsâ€), holding Appellantsâ€™ lawsuit to quiet title on the ten-acre\r\n  tract was untimely.Â  This appeal followed.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\n1.Â  The trial\r\n  court granted summary judgment to Respondents on the ground that this lawsuit\r\n  was barred under section 15-3-340 of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  We hold\r\n  this was error.Â  Whereas section 15-3-340 addresses actions for either the\r\n  recovery of real property or the recovery of possession of real property,\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ amended complaint asserted the ownership interest in the subject\r\n  property asserted by the Estate of Eloise Harris and the devisees of Eloise\r\n  Harris were based on â€œerroneous forgeries and fraudulent cross-deeds and devises.â€Â  This\r\n  allegation was the gravamen of Appellantsâ€™ lawsuit insofar as it concerned the\r\n  ten-acre tract.Â  As such, any limitation period set by section 15-3-340 would\r\n  be inapplicable.Â  See McKinnon v. Summers, 224 S.C. 331, 336, 79\r\n  S.E.2d 146, 148 (1953) (stating a complaint for cancellation of a deed on the\r\n  ground of forgery is different from an action for the recovery of real\r\n  property).Â  Moreover, even if we were to take the complaint at face value as\r\n  one to quiet title, such an action would not governed by section 15-3-340.Â  See Fox v. Moultrie, 379 S.C. 609, 613, 777 S.E.2d 915, 917 (2008) (â€œAn\r\n  action to quiet title is one in equity.â€); Parr v. Parr, 268 S.C. 58, 67,\r\n  231 S.E.2d 695, 699 (1977) (stating statutes of limitation are generally not\r\napplicable in equitable actions).Â  \r\n2.Â  In their briefs, the\r\n  parties address both the applicability of laches and the legal ramifications of\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ failure to file claims against the estates of Ellis Pinckney and\r\n  Isadora Pinckney.Â  Neither point, however, is a basis on which to affirm the\r\n  appealed order.Â  The trial courtâ€™s reference to Appellantsâ€™ failure to file\r\n  claims against the estates of Ellis Pinckney and Isadora Pinckney was not\r\n  presented as an independent ground for summary judgment, and there is no\r\n  mention of laches in the appealed order.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\nto Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-706","title":"State v.

State, 357 S.C. 646,\r\n  665, 594 S.E.2d 462, 472-73&nbsp;(2004) (holding a trial judge is required to\r\n  charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina and a jury charge is correct if it\r\n  contains the correct definition of the law when read as a whole); State v.\r\n    Elliott, 346 S.C. 603, 606, 552 S.E.2d 727, 728 (2001), overruled on\r\n      other grounds by State v.

Casey Manning, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2008-UP-713\r\n  Heard December 3, 2008 â€“ Filed December\r\n16, 2008\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Hammond A.\r\n          Beale, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        James W. Poag, Jr.,Â  of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Sue\r\n  Price (Seller) appeals the trial courtâ€™s decision to affirm an arbitration\r\n  award.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nSeller entered into a listing agreement (the Agreement) with\r\n  Colony United Brokers (Agent) for the sale of her business, Dannyâ€™s Package\r\n  Store, which also did business as Dannyâ€™s Party Store.Â  Pursuant to the\r\n  Agreement, Agent was required to find a purchaser for Sellerâ€™s business.Â  In\r\n  return, Seller agreed to pay Agent ten percent of the purchase price.Â  \r\nAgent procured Thomas Gill (Buyer) to purchase the\r\n  business.Â  Agent facilitated appointments between Seller and Buyer, and on\r\n  September 11, 2003, Buyer made an offer of $95,000 to purchase the business.Â  A\r\n  few days later Seller made a counteroffer of $97,500, which Buyer accepted.Â  However,\r\n  Buyer and Seller were unable to close the deal.Â  \r\nAgent sought its commission from Seller, but Seller\r\n  refused.Â  Seller maintained she mailed a letter to Agent terminating the\r\n  Agreement prior to Agent procuring Buyer.Â  Agent argued it never received the\r\n  letter.Â  Consequently, Agent instituted an arbitration action with the American\r\n  Arbitration Association (the AAA) to resolve the disagreement.Â  Seller objected\r\n  to the jurisdiction of the AAA on the grounds that an arbitration agreement did\r\n  not exist between the parties.Â  \r\nArbitration was conducted by the AAA.Â  The arbitrator found\r\n  for Agent and concluded there was a contract between Agent and Seller and\r\n  Seller had breached this contract.Â  Additionally, the arbitrator awarded Agent\r\n  its commission along with attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Seller, through her attorney filed\r\n  a motion to vacate the arbitration award.Â  The trial court affirmed the\r\n  arbitration award and granted judgment in favor of Agent.Â  This appeal follows. \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nDeterminations of\r\n  arbitrability are subject to de novo review.Â  MBNA Am. Bank v. Christianson,\r\n  377 S.C. 210, 213, 659 S.E.2d 209, 211 (Ct. App. 2008).Â Â  However, a circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if there is any\r\n  evidence reasonably supporting the findings.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAn\r\n  arbitrator does not have jurisdiction to enter an arbitration award in favor of\r\n  one party if the opposing party disputes the existence of an agreement to\r\n  arbitrate.Â  Id. at 215, 659 S.E.2d at 212.Â  In such a case, it is the\r\n  responsibility of the party desiring arbitration to petition the trial court to\r\n  compel arbitration because it is the duty of the courts rather than the\r\n  arbitrator to determine whether such an agreement exists.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Agent instituted an arbitration action with the AAA to\r\n  arbitrate the issue of whether it was owed commission for producing Buyer.Â  In\r\n  response, Seller objected to the jurisdiction of the AAA â€œon the ground that\r\n  there [was] no existing arbitration agreement between the parties.â€Â  At this\r\n  point, the AAA was without jurisdiction to enter an arbitration award because\r\n  Seller had objected on the grounds that an arbitration agreement did not exist\r\n  between the parties.Â  As such, the AAA did not have the authority to enter the\r\n  award, and the trial court committed reversible error when it did not grant the\r\n  motion to vacate the arbitration award.Â  See Simpson v. MSA of Myrtle\r\n    Beach, Inc., 373 S.C. 14, 23-24, 644 S.E.2d 663, 667-68 (2007) (stating if\r\n  one party denies the existence of an arbitration agreement a court must\r\n  immediately determine whether the agreement exists in the first place); MBNA\r\n    Am. Bank, 377 S.C. at 214-15, 659 S.E.2d at 211-12 (holding the arbitrator\r\n  lacked jurisdiction to enter an arbitration award in favor of a bank and\r\n  against a credit card holder once the card holder disputed the existence of an\r\n  agreement to arbitrate and the bank failed to petition the trial court to\r\n  compel arbitration).\r\nInterestingly,\r\n  neither party raised the jurisdictional issue.Â  However, â€œlack of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be raised for the\r\n  first time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte by the court.â€Â  Nix v. Columbia Staffing Inc., 322 S.C. 277, 280, 471 S.E.2d 718, 719\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Moreover, the parties may not consent to subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Talnall v. Gardner, 350 S.C. 135, 137, 564 S.E.2d 377,\r\n  378 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Thus, it is proper for this Court to consider this issue. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nWILLIAMS and GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-714","title":"State v.

Hodge, Jr., of Cheraw, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Johnny Jones appeals his conviction and\r\n  sentence for trafficking cocaine, arguing the trial court erred by refusing to\r\n  direct a verdict of acquittal.Â  Jones claims he was merely present as a\r\n  passenger in the vehicle in which cocaine was found and did not constructively\r\n  possess the drugs. \r\nViewing\r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, as we must, we find the\r\n  State offered sufficient circumstantial evidence to prove Jones had the right\r\n  to exercise constructive possession over the cocaine in the trunk of the car.Â  See State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292-93, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006)\r\n  (holding if there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, the appellate\r\n  court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury).Â  Specifically,\r\n  Jonesâ€™s conduct after the vehicle was pulled over by the policeman indicated he\r\n  was likely a knowledgeable participant in a joint criminal act:Â  (1)Â  Jones was\r\n  a passenger without any luggage in a rental car traveling from Florida to\r\n  Virginia; (2) when explaining the purpose for this trip, Jones gave the\r\n  policeman an explanation that was completely at odds with the driverâ€™s account;\r\n  (3) Jones contradicted himself when the policeman inquired about the person who\r\n  rented the vehicle, first stating it was his uncle who rented the vehicle but\r\n  admitting he did not know his uncleâ€™s name, and finally confessing that it was\r\n  not his uncle who rented the car.Â  See id;Â  State v. Attardo,\r\n  263 S.C. 546, 550, 211 S.E.2d 868, 869 (1975) (explaining knowledge of an\r\n  illegal substance may be proved by circumstantial evidence of acts,\r\n  declarations, or conduct of the accused from which the inference may be drawn\r\n  that the accused knew of the existence of the prohibited substances); State\r\n    v.
