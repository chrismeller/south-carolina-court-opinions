Graham appeals the dismissal of\r\n  his petition for writ of habeas corpus. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\n  AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nGraham\r\n  was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison by Judge Paul M. Burch\r\n  in August of 1998.Â  An Anders appeal was filed and dismissed.Â  Graham\r\n  then filed an application for post-conviction relief, and that application was\r\n  dismissed.Â  His subsequent writ of certiorari to the South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court was denied.Â  Graham filed another application for post-conviction relief\r\n  which was also dismissed.Â  Graham then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus\r\n  which was dismissed by Judge Burch acting in his capacity as chief\r\n  administrative judge.\r\nGraham\r\n  appeals the dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus.Â  The focus of\r\n  his appeal is on Judge Burchâ€™s failure to recuse himself from ruling on the petition\r\n  as he was the presiding judge at his trial.Â  Graham also argues in a very\r\n  cursory fashion that his petition is meritorious.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGraham\r\n  contends Judge Burch was required to recuse himself from considering the\r\n  dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus because of his prior involvement\r\n  with Grahamâ€™s case.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nCanon 3(E)(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, South\r\n  Carolina Appellate Court Rules, provides\r\n  that â€œ[a] judge shall\r\n  disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judgeâ€™s impartiality\r\n  might reasonably be questioned.â€Â  This includes instances where â€œthe judge has a personal bias or\r\n  prejudice concerning a party or a partyâ€™s lawyer, or personal knowledge of\r\n  disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.â€Â  Code of Judicial\r\n  Conduct, Canon 3(E)(1)(a), CJC, Rule 501, SCACR.Â  However, the standard for\r\n  establishing such prejudice is high.\r\n\r\n\tThe alleged bias must stem from an\r\n  extrajudicial source and result in a decision based on other than what the\r\n  judge learned from his participation in the case. It is not enough for a party\r\n  to allege bias; a party seeking disqualification of a judge must show some\r\n  evidence of bias or prejudice. When no evidence is presented other than claimed\r\n  â€œadverseâ€ rulings by the judge, the judge is not required to recuse himself.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nReading v. Ball, 291 S.C. 492,\r\n  494, 354 S.E.2d 397, 398 (Ct. App. 1987) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, Graham has failed to put forth any evidence\r\n  that calls Judge Burchâ€™s impartiality into question.Â  Furthermore, Judge Burch\r\n  was only acting in his capacity as chief administrative judge when he dismissed\r\n  Grahamâ€™s Petition.Â  Judge Burch performed a ministerial function dismissing the\r\n  case on procedural grounds because of Grahamâ€™s filing the petition in circuit\r\n  court as opposed to the original jurisdiction of the South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court.Â  See Keeler v. Mauney, 330 S.C. 568, 571, 500 S.E.2d 123,\r\n  124 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œA person is procedurally barred from petitioning the\r\n  circuit court for a writ of habeas corpus where the matter alleged is one which\r\n  could have been raised in a PCR application.Â  Â Furthermore, if a person is\r\n  procedurally barred, his only means of obtaining state habeas corpus relief is\r\n  to file a petition in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.â€).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBecause there is no evidence of bias on the part of Judge Burch or\r\n  prejudice to Graham, the dismissal of Grahamâ€™s petition is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; This case was decided without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to SCACR 215.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-499","title":"Furtick v.

Baxley, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â Â  2008-UP-499\r\nSubmitted September 2, 2008 â€“ Filed\r\n  September 5, 2008\r\nDISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJames Furtick, pro se Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tRobert Wesley Jacobs, South Carolina Department of Corrections, of\r\n  Columbia for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  James Furtick appeals the refusal of the\r\n  Marlboro County Clerk of Court to file his petition for writ of mandamus.Â  We\r\n  dismiss.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\n  AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nFurtick\r\n  attempted to file a petition for writ of mandamus with the Clerk of Court in Marlboro County where he is incarcerated.Â  The filing was not accepted, but was returned to\r\n  Furtick with a notation indicating that his filing was not in compliance with\r\n  â€œRule 3.â€Â  The notation is signed by a circuit court judge.[2] Furtick attempted to file the petition again, but the documents were returned\r\n  to him with a post-it note affixed advising him to â€œ[f]ile in the county of\r\n  conviction.â€Â  Furtick appeals the failure of the Clerk to file his petition. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  issue of the Clerkâ€™s failure to file Furtickâ€™s petition is not appealable.Â \r\n  Even if we assume the notation by the circuit court judge constituted a ruling,\r\n  it does not appear to fall within the parameters of those rulings which are\r\n  reviewable by this court.[3]Â \r\n  The ruling is not a final judgment, and it does not necessarily affect the\r\n  judgment or involve the merits of the petition.Â  The ruling does not affect a\r\n  substantial right, nor does it involve an injunction or the appointment of a\r\n  receiver.Â  All Furtick must do is file his petition in the proper county.Â  We\r\n  must assume that if he does so, the petition will be considered on the merits\r\n  and only then will it become a final judgment eligible for review by this\r\n  Court. \r\nHowever,\r\n  it is imperative to note that the instruction for Furtick to file his petition\r\n  in the county of conviction is erroneous.Â  â€œA writ of mandamus is used to\r\n  compel a public officer to perform a ministerial duty or act the officer\r\n  refuses to perform.â€Â  Richland County v. Kaiser, 351 S.C.\r\n  89, 94, 567 S.E.2d 260, 262 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In this case, Furtick seeks to\r\n  compel officials with the South Carolina Department of Corrections to perform\r\n  certain behavioral assessment that could entitle him to a reduction in his\r\n  sentence.Â  Because they seek to require the action of the respondent, it\r\n  logically follows that such petitions are to be filed in the county where the\r\n  respondent resides.Â  See State ex rel. Kirven v.\r\n    Scarborough, 70 S.C. 288, 288, 49 S.E. 860, 861 (1904) (â€œ[A]n issue in\r\n  mandamus proceedings should be tried where the respondent resides.â€).Â  In the\r\n  instant case, the correctional officers who work directly with Furtick are\r\n  employed in Marlboro County where he is incarcerated.Â  However, the\r\n  headquarters for SCDC, a state institution, is in Richland County.Â  Therefore, it would certainly be appropriate for Furtick to file his petition there.[4]Â  \r\nSCDC\r\n  also contends they are not a proper party in this appeal.Â  Because the issue is\r\n  disposed of on the basis of appealability, we decline to address this\r\n  argument.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One,\r\n  311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (holding the appellate court need\r\n  not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nBased on all of the foregoing, this appeal is\r\nDISMISSED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; This case was decided without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to SCACR 215.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Furtick maintains the notation was made by\r\n  Judge John M. Baxley.Â  It is not entirely clear from the record who signed the\r\n  note, but that is not relevant to the disposition of the case.\r\n[3]&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (Supp.\r\n  2007) addresses appellate jurisdiction and provides for jurisdiction over an\r\n  appeal from the following:\r\n(1) A final\r\n  judgment in a court of common pleas or general sessions; \r\n  (2) On appeal from any such final judgment, any intermediate order or decree â€˜necessarily\r\n  affecting the judgment [and] not before appealed fromâ€;\r\n  (3) An intermediate judgment, order, or decree of a court of common pleas or\r\n  general sessions â€œinvolving the meritsâ€;\r\n  (4) â€œAn order affecting a substantial right when such order \r\n(a) in effect\r\n  determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be\r\n  taken or discontinues the action; \r\n  (b) grants or refuses a new trial; or \r\n  (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof or any pleading in any action;â€ \r\n  (5) A final order â€œaffecting a substantial rightâ€ made in a â€œspecial\r\n  proceedingâ€ or in a summary proceeding after judgment; and \r\n  (6) An interlocutory order or decree in a court of common pleas which (a)\r\n  grants, continues, modifies, or refuses an injunction or (b) grants, continues,\r\n  modifies, or refuses the appointment of a receiver. \r\n[4]&nbsp; It is arguable that Marlboro County is also an appropriate place for filing under the circumstances.Â  However, since Richland County is the headquarters for SCDC it would clearly be correct for Furtick to\r\n  file the petition there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-500","title":"State v.

Pachak, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Christina J. Catoe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Donald V.\r\n  Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Alex Claude Sheriff, appeals his\r\n  convictions for possession of contraband, possession with intent to distribute\r\n  marijuana, and criminal conspiracy.Â  Sheriff argues the trial court erred in\r\n  not allowing him to introduce evidence of his prior guilty pleas. We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nSheriff\r\n  was a prisoner at Trenton Correctional Institution in Edgefield.Â  He was\r\n  working on a road crew assisting with maintenance of an area park.Â  The\r\n  contraband officer for the prison had received information that the road crew\r\n  was bringing drugs into the prison, so he went out to search the park.Â  The\r\n  officer discovered a brown bag containing marijuana and cocaine stuffed between\r\n  the wall and the sink in the menâ€™s bathroom. The officer replaced the package\r\n  with a decoy package and observed the road crew on its next assignment at the\r\n  park.Â  Sheriff and another inmate, Herbert Jones, walked directly to the\r\n  bathroom, and officers found the decoy package stuffed inside Jonesâ€™s boot.Â \r\n  Jones testified that he and Sheriff were in on the plan together.Â  Sheriff\r\n  eventually told the officers that he was involved with bringing the drugs into\r\n  the prison.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to\r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court[,] and its ruling will not be disturbed\r\n  in the absence of a manifest abuse of discretion accompanied by probable\r\n  prejudice.â€Â  State v. Douglas, 369 S.C. 424, 429, 632 S.E.2d 845, 847-48\r\n  (2006). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Sheriff argues the trial court erred in not allowing him to introduce\r\n  evidence of his prior guilty pleas to various criminal charges. The defense\r\n  hoped to offer the evidence to show that Sheriff had pled guilty on previous\r\n  occasions and therefore, if he was guilty of the present charges, would have\r\n  pled guilty as well.[2]Â \r\n  The trial court did not allow the proffered testimony regarding the disposition\r\n  of the previous charges, because it would improperly bolster his credibility.Â  \r\nAccording\r\n  to Rule 608(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence, â€œ[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of\r\n  attacking or supporting the witnessâ€™[s] credibility, other than\r\n  conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic\r\n  evidence.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  The evidence may be introduced on\r\n  cross-examination if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness.Â  Id.Â  Rule 609 deals strictly with using criminal convictions to impeach a witness.Â  It\r\n  provides that certain convictions are admissible, and notes that there is no\r\n  distinction between a conviction resulting from a trial or a guilty plea.Â  See SCRE 609 (â€œFor the purposes of this rule, a conviction includes a conviction\r\n  resulting from a trial or any type of plea . . . .â€).\r\nApplying\r\n  these rules to the facts of this case, Rule 609 indicates that the disposition\r\n  of Sheriffâ€™s prior charges is irrelevant.Â  It only matters that he was\r\n  ultimately convicted of the charges.Â  Consequently, the evidence is\r\n  inadmissible.Â  See SCRE 402 (â€œEvidence which is not relevant is not\r\n  admissible.â€).\r\nThe\r\n  fact that Sheriff previously pled guilty is likewise inadmissible under Rule\r\n  608.Â  If the act of pleading guilty is considered a specific act of conduct, it\r\n  cannot be proved extrinsically to support the witnessâ€™s credibility.Â  That is\r\n  exactly what Sheriff was attempting to do by contrasting his prior behavior\r\n  with his decision to go to trial on the charges in this case.Â  Because\r\n  Sheriffâ€™s guilty pleas were irrelevant under Rule 609 and would improperly\r\n  bolster his credibility under Rule 608, the trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in refusing to admit Sheriffâ€™s testimony about his prior guilty\r\n  pleas.Â Â Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the ruling of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  This case was decided without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The proffered testimony consisted of the following\r\n  exchange:\r\n\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; Mr. Sheriff, youâ€™ve got the prior convictions\r\n  that we spoke about, correct?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; Yes sir.\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; Were those convictions at trial or did you\r\n  plead guilty?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; I plead guilty.\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; And have you plead not guilty to\r\n  this charge?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; To this charge?\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; The one youâ€™re here for.\r\n\tA.&nbsp; I plead not guilty.\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; Why are you not pleading guilty to\r\n  this charge?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; Because Iâ€™m not guilty of this\r\n  charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-522","title":"State v.

Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Kevin S.\r\n          Brackett, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Christopher A. Woody, appeals his\r\n  conviction for murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\r\n  violent crime.Â  Â Woody argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for\r\n  mistrial based on the solicitorâ€™s closing statement.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nDuring\r\n  the Stateâ€™s closing argument at trial, the solicitor made the following\r\n  comment:Â  â€œLadies and Gentlemen, this mountain of evidence that stands before\r\n  you speaks the truth, just as your verdict will speak the truth and thatâ€™s what\r\n  verdict in its original form means, to speak the truth and thatâ€™s what I ask\r\n  you to do.Â  Thatâ€™s what the judge asks you to do, thatâ€™s what South Carolina\r\n  asks you to do and that is your duty today, to speak the truth.â€Â  The defense\r\n  objected to the solicitorâ€™s comments arguing that the remarks gave the jury the\r\n  impression that the judge was aligned with the Stateâ€™s position.Â  The defense\r\n  requested a mistrial, but that request was denied.Â  The judge decided to\r\n  address the question of his neutrality during his charge on the law.Â  At the\r\n  beginning of his charge, the judge instructed:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    court is neutral in any case that comes before it insofar as the court is\r\n    concerned and when the solicitor, I think, mentioned to you in his final\r\n    argument, I believe, that he asked that you render a verdict which speaks the\r\n    truth and he says that he judge wants you to do that.Â  Well, let me say to you\r\n    that you should not infer from that in any way that the judge is not a neutral\r\n    party in this case or is aligned with one side or the other in the case,\r\n    because the judge is not.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Woody argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial\r\n  based on the solicitorâ€™s closing statement.Â  We disagree.Â  â€œThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial\r\n  is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  A mistrial should only be\r\n  granted when absolutely necessary, and a defendant must show both error and\r\n  resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial.â€Â  State v. Ward,\r\n  374 S.C. 606, 612, 649 S.E.2d 145, 148 (Ct. App. 2007) (citations omitted).Â  â€œGenerally, a curative instruction is deemed to have cured any alleged\r\n    error.â€ State v.

Melnick, both of Hilton Head Island,\r\n  for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Shawn M. Reid appeals the masterâ€™s grant\r\n  of summary judgment in favor of the Carrs based on the failure to serve a\r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\n  AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nReid\r\n  performed electrical work on a home being built by the Carrs.Â Â Â  Reid filed a\r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien against the property.Â  Reid attempted to serve the Carrs by\r\n  leaving the notice and certificate of lien with Carlos Garcia, a painting\r\n  subcontractor present on the property.Â  Reid had the Sheriffâ€™s Office in Oakland County, Michigan attempt to serve the Carrs at their residence in that state.Â  When\r\n  the Sheriffâ€™s Office was unable to serve the Carrs, Reid filed affidavits of\r\n  non-service approximately 109 days after the last date of work on the subject\r\n  property.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  master granted the Carrâ€™s motion for summary judgment for lack of effective\r\n  service under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-90, the mechanicâ€™s lien statute.Â  Reid\r\n  appeals.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nReid\r\n  argues that the master erred in granting summary judgment to the Carrs, because\r\n  there were genuine issues of material fact regarding service of the mechanicâ€™s\r\n  lien.Â  However, the record shows that the facts are essentially undisputed.Â \r\n  The question presented to the master was whether the facts set forth satisfied\r\n  the service requirements found in the mechanicâ€™s lien statute.Â Â  â€œWhen an\r\n  appeal involves stipulated or undisputed facts, an appellate court is free to\r\n  review whether the trial court properly applied the law to those facts.â€Â  Duke\r\n    Power Co. v. Laurens Elec. Co-op., Inc., 344 S.C. 101, 104, 543 S.E.2d 560,\r\n  561 (Ct. App. 2000).Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nReidâ€™s\r\n  first argument involves service of the notice and certificate of lien on\r\n  Garcia.Â  Reid contends that Garcia, a laborer of a subcontractor, constitutes a\r\n  â€œperson in possessionâ€ as contemplated by the mechanicâ€™s lien statute.Â  The\r\n  statute provides that a mechanicâ€™s lien shall\r\n  be dissolved unless the person desiring the lien serves the owner or â€œperson in\r\n  possessionâ€ of the property with a notice and certificate of lien.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 29-5-90 (2007).Â  The only\r\n  case touching on this issue is Stovall Bldg. Supplies, Inc. v. Mottet,\r\n  305 S.C. 28, 406 S.E.2d 176 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  In Stovall, the court\r\n  determined that service of a mechanicâ€™s lien on a subdivision security guard\r\n  did not constitute service on a â€œperson in possessionâ€ as contemplated by the\r\n  statute.Â  Id. at 33, 406 S.E.2d at 179.Â  The court stated â€œ[t]he\r\n  security guard was not a responsible person living in the [ownerâ€™s] home.â€Â  Id.Â  Likewise, Garcia, as the employee of a subcontractor, was not a responsible\r\n  person living in the home.Â  Therefore, service on Garcia would not constitute\r\n  service on a â€œperson in possessionâ€ and would not be sufficient to preserve the\r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien.\r\nReid\r\n  further argues the affidavits of non-service that were filed outside the ninety-day\r\n  statutory period are valid to preserve the lien.Â  The statute sets a ninety-day\r\n  time limit after the last date of labor or furnishing of materials to\r\n  accomplish service.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  29-5-90 (2007).Â  The statute contemplates that service may not always be\r\n  possible.Â  Id.Â  â€œ[I]n the event neither the owner nor the person in\r\n  possession can be located after diligent search, and this fact is verified by\r\n  affidavit of the sheriff or his deputy, the lien may be preserved by filing the\r\n  statement together with the affidavit.â€Â  Id. Â The statute does not however provide for an\r\n  extension of time for attempted service or the subsequent filing of affidavits\r\n  of non-service.Â  To read a vague grace period into the statute would go against\r\n  the general policy of interpreting statutes according to their plain meaning.Â  See Mun. Assâ€™n of S.C. v. AT&amp;T Commcâ€™ns of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C.\r\n  576, 580, 606 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2004) (â€œ[T]he words of the statute must be given their plain and\r\n  ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or\r\n  expand the statute's operation.â€).Â  Accordingly, the master correctly applied\r\n  the statute under these circumstances to conclude that the filing of affidavits\r\n  of non-service outside the ninety-day time limit did not preserve the lien. \r\nFinally,\r\n  Reid argues that service on the Kessler Construction Company Â as general\r\n  contractors satisfied the requirement of service on the owners.Â  Nothing in the\r\n  statute provides for such substituted service, and the relevant affidavit of\r\n  service only indicates service on Kessler Construction as a party, not as agent\r\n  for the Carrs.\r\nBased on all of the foregoing, the ruling of the master is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nANDERSON, WILLIAMS,\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-542","title":"Berkeley Hall Club v.
