Boone Aiken, III, of Florence, and James B. Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nPeter L. Hearn, Sr, of Conway, and Richard M. Lovelace, Jr., of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Terry Tindall brought this action against H&amp;S Homes, LLC, Pete Hughes, Jr., and Horton Homes, Inc. for breach of contract, fraud, negligence, and breach of express and implied warranty.Â  The jury awarded Tindall actual and punitive damages on her negligence cause of action against H&amp;S.Â  H&amp;S appeals, arguing the trial court should have granted its motions for directed verdict, JNOV, and a new trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHorton Homes, Inc., of Edenton Georgia, is a mobile home manufacturer that principally owns and operates approximately thirty mobile home dealerships in the Southeast.Â  H&amp;S Homes, LLC, of Conway, is a Horton Homes dealership.Â  Pete Hughes, Jr., began working as H&amp;Sâ€™s general manager in September of 1998.Â  Hughes testified that H&amp;S received a damaged 1997 model mobile home some time prior to the time he began his employment.\r\nTerry Tindall is a disabled and dyslexic forty-four-year-old single mother with minimal education.Â  In March of 1999, Tindall and her teenage daughter visited H&amp;S Homes on several occasions to purchase a double-wide mobile home.Â  Hughes showed Tindall several homes, including the damaged 1997 model, which Tindall alleges Hughes told her was a 1998 model.Â  On March 5, 1999, Tindall signed a purchase agreement to buy the alleged 1998 model home for $53,210.Â  The purchase agreement did not include the model year, but it did indicate the home was new.\r\nH&amp;S allowed Tindall and her\r\ndaughter to move into the home prior to the April 16, 1999 closing.Â  During the closing, Tindall learned the home was a 1997 model.Â  The closing attorney delayed the closing in response to Tindallâ€™s concern regarding the model year, but Tindall completed the purchase because H&amp;S sold her trade-in, a single-wide mobile home, and the purchaser of the trade-in had already moved in to the home prior to the closing.Â  Tindall testified she felt â€œstuckâ€ because â€œshe didnâ€™t have anywhere to go.â€\r\nTindallâ€™s neighbor testified the walls â€œlooked like somebody took a hammer and just beat holes in it.â€Â  The home leaked around the windows, under the sinks, behind the refrigerator, and in the bathrooms.Â  As a result, the exterior walls, floors, and cabinets rotted and the vinyl floor became discolored.Â  The leaks also created mold and mildew, resulting in a bad odor throughout the home.Â  The commode was replaced three times, the doors were unlevel and would not close properly, and the molding around the front door was three quarters of an inch off the wall.Â  A carpenter hired by Tindall testified the molding was â€œnot even touching the wall to seal the draft . . . around the doorway.â€Â  The ceiling fan fell out of the ceiling, and the chandelier was damaged to the extent it had to be taken apart and put back together.Â  Tindall testified the linoleum in the bathroom, kitchen, and her daughterâ€™s room had â€œcuts in itâ€ from when H&amp;S â€œset the house up.â€Â  Tindall also testified the kitchen â€œsmell[ed] like sewerâ€ and when she hired a plumber to determine the cause of the smell, the plumber found one of the plumbing vents did not have a vent cap to prevent the sewer gas from backing up the line.Â  Additionally, the brick underpinning on the house was falling down because there was not enough mortar in the brickwork.Â  Incidentally, a neighbor witnessed H&amp;Sâ€™s work crew drinking liquor as the crew set up Tindallâ€™s brick underpinning. \r\nTindall contacted H&amp;S on several occasions asking H&amp;S to repair her home.Â  H&amp;S attempted to repair some of the problems, but many of the repairs were unsuccessful or inadequate.Â  Tindall testified concerning several of H&amp;Sâ€™s attempts to repair including the following:Â  (1) H&amp;S tried to fix the leak under the bathroom sink, â€œbut when they would come out they would . . . screw that little screw . . . where the sink is and it would split all the way up, so it kept leakingâ€; (2) H&amp;S replaced the first commode and â€œtried to put caulking on it, silicon, to stop it from leaking, and it leaked around the commode pipes, and it turned the floor darkâ€;Â  (3) H&amp;S put clear caulking on the ceiling cracks, but the clear caulking could not be painted; (4) H&amp;S replaced the back door because of water damage, but did not attempt to repair the leak that caused the damage; (5) H&amp;S attempted to repair the doors, but the doors remained unlevel and never shut properly; (6) H&amp;S patched the torn linoleum floors in the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom with silicone instead of replacing the floors with vinyl; and (7) H&amp;S placed screws in the bottoms of leaking windows, but the screws blocked the weep holes, prevented drainage, and caused the windows to rust out.Â  H&amp;S did not even attempt to repair several of the problems, including repair or replacement of furniture that was damaged during the transport of the home.\r\nTindall brought this action against H&amp;S Homes, Horton Homes, and Pete Hughes, Jr., for negligence, fraud, breach of contract, and breach of express and implied warranty.Â  At trial, the defendants moved for a directed verdict on all causes of action.Â  The trial judge granted the motion for negligence as to Horton Homes, but denied the motion on all grounds as to H&amp;S Homes.Â  At the close of the testimony, the defendants renewed the motions.Â  Following the motions, the court conducted a charge conference.Â  During the conference, the trial judge determined the jury could choose only one theory of liability.Â  Tindall elected to forgo the warranty causes of action to â€œsimplify matters for the jury.â€Â  The court, therefore, instructed the jury on the following causes of action: (1) breach of contract as to H&amp;S Homes and Horton Homes; (2) fraud and deceit as to H&amp;S Homes and Pete Hughes, Jr.; and (3) negligence as to H&amp;S Homes.Â  In addition, the court submitted the issue of punitive damages to the jury on the theory of fraud and deceit and on the theory of negligence.\r\nThe jury found for the defendants on the breach of contract action and on the fraud and deceit action. Â The jury found for Tindall on the theory of negligence.Â  The jury awarded $95,000 actual damages and $300,000 punitive damages.Â  H&amp;S Homes moved for a new trial, a new trial nisi remittitur, and a JNOV.Â  The trial judge granted the nisi remittitur, reduced the verdict for actual damages to $43,210, and directed Tindallâ€™s counsel to notify the court within ten days whether Tindall would accept the reduced verdict.Â  The trial judge indicated if Tindall refused to accept the new verdict, the trial judge would grant a new trial absolute.\r\nH&amp;S Homes moved to strike the punitive damages award arguing, â€œwhat the jury had the opportunity to find here was ordinary negligence and ordinary negligence in this state will not support a punitive damage award.â€Â  The trial judge responded that he would review the punitive damage award if Tindall accepted the new trial nisi remittitur.Â  Tindall accepted the new trial nisi remittitur within the ten-day time limit, and the judge entered his order of judgment in the reduced amount.Â  The parties then submitted briefs to the trial judge on the issue of punitive damages.Â  After conducting a review pursuant to Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991), the judge declined to reduce the amount of the punitive damages award in a June 28, 2004 order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Directed Verdict and JNOV\r\nH&amp;S argues the trial court erred by denying its motions for directed verdict and JNOV because there was no evidence that H&amp;S negligently breached any tort duty owed to Tindall.Â  This argument is not preserved for review.\r\nOn appeal, H&amp;S alleges that Tindall was attempting to convert an action for breach of warranty and for fraud, both contract actions, into a negligence action, a tort action.[1]Â  However, at trial, H&amp;S did not assert that Tindall was trying to convert a contract action into a tort.Â  In its motion for directed verdict, H&amp;S simply argued that Tindallâ€™s negligence allegation was not supported by evidence as pled:\r\n\r\n[Tindallâ€™s] allegations are that Horton, H&amp;S LLC was willfully negligent in the transportation, installation of the home violating applicable housing standards for such transportation and installation.Â  I donâ€™t believe thereâ€™s been any evidence about what standards for transportation [and] installation there are, if there happen to be such standards.Â  There just hasnâ€™t been any evidence in this case and Iâ€™m just saying that the negligence count not only falls with regard to Horton Homes[,] it also falls as pled with regard to H&amp;S. \r\n\r\nTherefore, H&amp;Sâ€™s motion for a directed verdict was not sufficient to preserve the issue on appeal.Â  See State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989) (stating a party cannot argue one theory at trial and a different theory on appeal); State v. Fletcher,&nbsp; 363 S.C. 221, 257, 609 S.E.2d 572, 591&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (â€œTo be preserved for appellate review, an objection should be sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error.â€).\r\nII.Â  New Trial Absolute\r\nH&amp;S argues the trial judge erred by not granting a new trial absolute because the verdict for actual damages exceeded the largest amount supported by the evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIf the amount of the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive so as to be the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, or some other influence outside the evidence, the trial judge must grant a new trial absolute.â€ Oâ€™Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 527, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993).Â  Also, if the verdict â€œconclusively shows the jury disregarded the courtâ€™s instructions or else capriciously fixed damages without reference to the evidence,â€ then it is error for the court to refuse a motion for new trial.Â  Carrigg v. Blue, 283 S.C. 494, 500, 323 S.E.2d 787, 790 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  The trial judgeâ€™s failure to grant a new trial absolute in such situations amounts to an abuse of discretion and on appeal this court will grant a new trial absolute.Â  Weir v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Servs. Inc.,&nbsp;312 S.C. 511, 518, 435 S.E.2d 864, 868-69&nbsp;(1993).\r\nIn this case, Tindall paid $53,210 and traded in a single-wide mobile home valued at $8,100 to purchase the mobile home from H&amp;S.Â  Additionally, the record contains testimony that the cost to repair the home would exceed the value of the home.Â  Taking all of these factors into consideration, we find that the juryâ€™s verdict of $95,000 in actual damages was not grossly excessive so as to be the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, or some other influence outside the evidence.Â  \r\nFurthermore, H&amp;S moved for a new trial nisi remittitur in addition to moving for a new trial absolute, which the court granted.Â  â€œ[T]he import of a new trial nisi additur or nisi remittitur is a suggestion on the part of the [trial] judge of a settlement figure.â€ Stroud v. Stroud, 299 S.C. 394, 397, 385 S.E.2d 205, 206 (Ct. App. 1989) (overruled on other grounds).Â  â€œThe trial court has wide discretionary power to reduce the amount of a verdict which in his or her judgment is excessive.â€Â  Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 381, 426 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1993).Â  On appeal, the trial judgeâ€™s decision â€œto reduce the verdict will not be disturbed unless it clearly appears that the exercise of discretion was controlled by a manifest error of law.â€Â  Id.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s decision is given great deference because the judge, â€œwho heard the evidence and is more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial[,] possesses a better-informed view of the damages than this [c]ourt.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nAdditionally, if the party opposing the motion for a new trial nisi remittitur agrees to pay the amount suggested by the trial court, the opposing party cannot thereafter complain.Â  Stroud, 299 S.C. at 397, 385 S.E.2d at 206.Â  â€œHaving asked for the relief and having received it, the moving party is likewise bound.â€Â  Estes v. Grav,&nbsp; 319 S.C. 551, 554, 462 S.E.2d 561, 562&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  Because H&amp;S moved for the remittitur and received it, H&amp;S is bound by the judgment.Â  \r\n\r\n    III.Â  Punitive DamagesÂ  \r\nH&amp;S argues the trial judge erred by submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury because there was no evidence that its conduct was reckless, willful, or wanton.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe issue of punitive damages must be submitted to the jury if more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence as to whether the defendantâ€™s behavior was reckless, willful, or wanton.Â  Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 398, 321 S.E.2d 40, 43 (1984).Â  To receive punitive damages, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the defendantâ€™s misconduct was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of the plaintiffâ€™s rights.Â  Scott v. Porter, 340 S.C. 158, 172, 530 S.E.2d 389, 396&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œA conscious failure to exercise due care constitutes willfulness.â€Â  Hawkins v. Pathology Assocs. of Greenville, P.A.,&nbsp; 330 S.C. 92, 110, 498 S.E.2d 395, 405&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998). A tort is reckless, willful, or wanton if committed in such a manner or under such circumstances that an ordinary person would have been conscious of it as an invasion of the plaintiffâ€™s rights.Â  Id.Â  Although an award of punitive damages demands more than gross negligence, â€œnegligence may be so gross as to amount to recklessness, and when it does, it ceases to be mere negligence and assumes very much the nature of willfulness.â€Â  Hicks v. McCandlish,&nbsp; 221 S.C. 410, 415, 70 S.E.2d 629, 631&nbsp;(1952).Â  \r\nTindall presented evidence that could be interpreted as reckless, willful, and wanton conduct by H&amp;S.Â  There was testimony that H&amp;S â€œthrewâ€ siding in the mobile home during its transport, tearing furniture and destroying the interior walls, H&amp;Sâ€™s work crew drank liquor as they set up the brick underpinning of Tindallâ€™s home, and H&amp;S sent Tindall a box of hinges rather than fix the doors.Â  Thus, the trial judge did not err in submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nBEATTY, SHORT, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]  Although H&amp;S did not mention the â€œeconomic loss ruleâ€ in its brief, it is essentially what they are arguing.Â  The economic loss rule assists in determining whether contract or tort theories are applicable to a given case.Â  Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., Inc., 299 S.C. 335, 345, 384 S.E.2d 730, 736 (1989).Â  While some states have used the economic loss rule to prohibit tort actions for purely economic damages, South Carolina has recognized limited tort actions where the damages were purely economic losses.Â  Id. at 346, 384 S.E.2d at 737 (holding that a cause of action in negligence will be available where a builder has violated a legal duty, no matter the type of resulting damage); Beachwalk Villas Condo. Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Martin, 305 S.C. 144, 147, 406 S.E.2d 372, 374 (1991) (extending the Kennedy decision to architects).Â  Our supreme court has determined that the question of whether the plaintiff may maintain an action in tort for purely economic loss turns on the determination of the source of the duty plaintiff claims the defendant owed.Â  The court held that a plaintiff might maintain an action in tort for purely economic loss if the breach of duty arises independently of any contract duties.Â  Tommy L. Griffin Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Jordan, Jones &amp; Goulding, Inc., 320 S.C. 49, 55, 463 S.E.2d 85, 89 (1995) (holding that design professionals can be liable in tort for purely economic loss when the relationship between the design professional and the plaintiff is such that the design professional owes a professional duty to the plaintiff arising separate and distinct from any contractual duties between the parties or with third parties).Â  However, â€œ[a] breach of duty which arises under the provisions of a contract between the parties must be redressed under contract, and a tort action will not lie.â€Â  Tommy L. Griffin Plumbing &amp; Heating Co., 320 S.C. at 56, 463 S.E.2d at 88.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-536","title":"The Sun Publishing v.

Â We agree. \r\nIf a person or entity seeking relief prevails in an action brought pursuant to the FOIA, reasonable attorney fees and other costs of litigation may be awarded.[2] Â The circuit courtâ€™s order denying attorney fees in this case states the request was denied â€œ[b]ased upon the facts of this case.â€Â  The circuit court included no explanation of what those facts were, notwithstanding Sun Publishing in its application for attorney fees cited Burton v. York County Sheriffâ€™s Department[3] and quoted the portion of Burton that referenced a trial courtâ€™s duty to â€œmake specific findings of fact on the recordâ€ when determining an award of attorney fees.[4]Â  A failure to enter findings regarding the denial of a request for attorney fees under the FOIA is an abuse of discretion and warrants remand for proper consideration.[5] Â We therefore remand this matter to the circuit court pursuant to Burton for it to make specific findings of fact on the record regarding Sun Publishingâ€™s right to attorney fees.Â  \r\nREMANDED.

Merriman, of Florence, for Appellant.\r\nH. Thad White, Jr., of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Robert L. Wiley appeals a circuit court order granting summary judgment to Jack Woodham, d/b/a Indian Hill Farms (collectively â€œWoodhamâ€) on Woodhamâ€™s action to enforce a promissory note Wiley gave Woodham.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nWiley hired Woodham to perform grading, compacting, and drainage work for the roads in the Savannah Heights Subdivision in Florence County, which Wiley was developing.Â  Wiley paid Woodham in cash each week until his funds became depleted.Â  Woodham agreed to continue working, in exchange for which Wiley gave Woodham an unsecured promissory note.Â  The note provided:\r\n\r\nFOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned promises to pay Jack Woodham and Johnford Murray d/b/a Indian Hill Farms,[1] or order, the principal sum of FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND NO/100 ($15,000.00) DOLLARS, without interest.Â  The said principal shall be payable . . . within ninety (90) days of the approval of the Savannah Heights Subdivision roads and drainage.Â  If this note is not paid within ninety (90) days of the approval of the Savannah Heights Subdivision roads and drainage, any sum remaining due and owed on this Note will begin to accrue interest at the rate of eight per cent (8.0%) per annum from the date of approval, PROVIDED HOWEVER; no payment shall be due on this Note nor shall any interest accrue on this Note until such time that the County of Florence approves the Savannah Heights Subdivision roads and drainage.Â  The right to prepay all or a part of this Note without penalty is granted.\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).Â  The note also provided for reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees and costs in the event of default.Â  \r\nWoodham continued working for approximately one additional week, at which point he informed Wiley he could do nothing further until rain fell on the work site.Â  According to Woodham, once rain fell, he could finish the compacting.Â  \r\nShortly thereafter, a utility company working on the site dug trenches across the road, causing damage.Â  The damage caused by the utility company apparently created additional work for the road, necessitating repair before the road project could be completed.Â  Woodham demanded an additional sum from Wiley to repair this damage.Â  Wiley declined to pay any additional consideration to Woodham, who then refused to work further on the project.Â  Wiley hired another contractor to repair the damage and complete the work.Â  \r\nFlorence County approved the subdivision.Â  After ninety days passed, Woodham sought payment under the note, which Wiley refused.\r\nWoodham brought the present action seeking payment on the note.Â  Wiley answered, asserting that Woodham was not entitled to payment on the note because Woodham failed to perform under their agreement.Â  Â Â \r\nWoodham moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  Wiley sought to defeat summary judgment due to Woodhamâ€™s failure to perform.Â  The circuit courtâ€”relying on the recital in the note of â€œFOR VALUE RECEIVEDâ€â€”refused to allow extrinsic evidence. The circuit court granted summary judgment for Woodham, finding the note required payment to Wiley when the subdivisionâ€™s roads and ditches passed the Countyâ€™s inspection, which undisputedly had occurred.Â  The court awarded Woodham the amount due under the note and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wiley appealed.\r\n STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  In determining whether a triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all\r\nfactual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 42, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997).Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nWe agree with Wiley that the circuit court erred in refusing to allow extrinsic evidence that Woodham had failed to perform the grading services contemplated as the consideration for the note.Â Â  We find the case of Iseman v. Hobbs, 290 S.C. 482, 351 S.E.2d 351 (Ct. App. 1986) persuasive.Â  In Iseman, this court addressed whether parol evidence was admissible to show lack of consideration for a note that contained the recital â€œfor value receivedâ€â€”the exact language at issue in the note in the present case.Â  The court held that parol evidence should have been considered:\r\n\r\nThe rule is well settled in this State that parol evidence is admissible to show a different consideration from that expressed in a written instrument when language of consideration is intended as a mere recital, but not when it is contractual. Thus, if the consideration recited is an act or forbearance, as distinguished from a promise or covenant, it may be shown that it did not take place and that therefore the writing is gratuitous and unenforceable. On the other hand, if a promise or covenant is recited as having been made as consideration, this recital cannot be contradicted, explained, or varied by extrinsic evidence. In the present case, the phrase â€œfor value receivedâ€ is not a recital of a promise or covenant, but a recital that an act (i.e., the receipt of value) has occurred. Contradiction of the fact of receipt would in no way alter the contractual terms of the note.\r\n\r\nId. at 483-84, 351 S.E.2d at 352-53 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).\r\nWe find Iseman v. Hobbs controlling and construe the language of consideration here as â€œmere recital,â€ thereby permitting the court to properly consider the parol evidence offered by Wiley.Â  Accordingly, when such evidence is considered, a genuine issue of material fact exists, rendering summary judgment inappropriate.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court erred in not considering the evidence of Woodhamâ€™s failure to perform under the contract.Â  That evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact.Â  The grant of summary judgment to Woodham is reversed and the matter is remanded. \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Johnford Murray is not a party to this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-539","title":"Tharington v.

T. Abbott, III, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-539\r\nSubmitted September 1, 2005 â€“ Filed October 11, 2005Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAnita Ruth Floyd, Â of Conway, for Appellant.\r\nFrederick L. Harris, of Surfside Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this appeal from a decree of divorce, Elizabeth Votor argues the family court erred in 1) refusing to hold the husband, James Michael Tharington, in contempt, 2) changing the surname of the partiesâ€™ child from Votor to Tharington, and 3) awarding Votor only $2500.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.Â  1\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nTharington and Votor were married on July 25, 2001.Â  Votor was pregnant with their child at the time.Â  The parties had a heated argument on their honeymoon and their relationship never recovered.Â  During the marriage Tharington spent two to three weeks a month in Tennessee on business.Â  He left for one such trip the day before the partiesâ€™ child was born.Â  Once he arrived at the hospital after the child was born by caesarian section, he stayed for thirty minutes.Â  Tharington did not return to the hospital during Votorâ€™s five-day hospital stay until the day Votor and the child were to be discharged.Â  When he arrived at the hospital, Tharington learned that Votor had named their son Aidan John Votor rather than giving the child his surname.Â  He and Votor argued until she asked hospital personnel to make Tharington leave.Â  Tharington then left the hospital without Votor or Aidan.Â  Votor had to call Tharingtonâ€™s mother and ask her to bring them home.Â  The partiesâ€™ separated on January 14, 2002, ten days after their sonâ€™s birth.Â  \r\nOn February 25, 2002, the parties were involved in an altercation at the marital home.Â  Votor called 9-1-1.Â  The responding officer, Corporal Dan Flood, testified that the partiesâ€™ gave conflicting stories about how a scratch on Votorâ€™s arm occurred.Â  Votor stated Tharington had pushed her, causing her to fall over a trash bag and hit her arm on the wall, but Tharington stated Votor had merely tripped over the bag and fallen.Â  Corporal Flood testified he did not believe he had probable cause to make an arrest.Â  He stayed at the residence until Tharington, who had offered to leave, packed up his belongings and left.Â  \r\nVotor filed with the family court a petition for an order of protection on February 27, 2002.Â  The parties entered into a consent order providing inter alia that Votor would be entitled to the marital home until the house she owned could be refurbished and that Tharington would be responsible for the cost of refurbishing the house.Â  Votor was to vacate the marital home upon 48 hours notice by Tharington that the refurbishment was complete.Â  \r\nTharington filed a petition for a rule to show cause on March 13, 2002 asserting Votor should be held in contempt for failing to vacate the marital home in accordance with the consent order.Â  The family court declined to hold Votor in contempt.Â  \r\nIn the meantime, Tharington had filed a complaint for an order of separate maintenance.Â  He asked for joint custody of Aidan, child support, and possession of the marital home.Â  Votor filed a counterclaim seeking a divorce on the grounds of adultery and physical cruelty, sole custody of Aidan, equitable distribution of debt, possession of the marital home, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nVotor left the marital home to return to her own house.Â  Once there, she replaced the carpets, had new appliances installed, and took other steps to improve the home.Â  At the final hearing, she sought to have Tharington held responsible for these improvements under the consent order.Â  \r\nIn the final decree of divorce, the family court granted the parties a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation, awarded Votor custody of Aidan and standard visitation to Tharington, and set child support.Â  At Tharingtonâ€™s request, the family court ordered Aidanâ€™s birth certificate be amended to read â€œAidan John Tharington.â€Â  The court held Tharington was not responsible for the funds Votor expended improving her home.Â  It also made other rulings on the equitable distribution of the marital estate and debt.Â  Finally, the court ordered Tharington to be responsible for $2500.00 of Votorâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nBoth parties filed motions to alter or amend.Â  The family court clarified visitation and changed its ruling to provide Tharington must reimburse Votor for the tires she purchased for his vehicle.Â  Other than those rulings, the court reaffirmed its previous rulings.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEWÂ Â  \r\nâ€œOn appeal from an order of the family court, this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Hopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 304, 540 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2000).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to ignore the findings of the family court.Â  Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 58, 552 S.E.2d 329, 334 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œNeither are we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€ Id.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contempt\r\nVotor argues the family court erred when it declined to hold Tharington in contempt for failing to comply with the consent order that he would refurbish her house.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA determination of contempt lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, Inc. v. Cloyd, 350 S.C. 596, 607, 567 S.E.2d 514, 519 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œA determination of contempt is a serious matter and should be imposed sparingly.â€Â  Haselwood v. Sullivan, 283 S.C. 29, 32, 320 S.E.2d 499, 501 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Contempt results from willful disobedience of a court order.Â  Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, Inc., 350 S.C. at 607, 567 S.E.2d at 519.Â  In order for a person to be held in contempt, the record must be clear and specific as to acts or conduct upon which the contempt is based.Â  Id.Â  A willful act is â€œone done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€Â  Id. at 608, 567 S.E.2d at 520. \r\nDuring the partiesâ€™ marriage, Votor rented out the house in which she had lived before the marriage.Â  The tenants vacated the house around the time of the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  In the March 5, 2002 consent order, the parties agreed:\r\n\r\n[Votor] is entitled to the marital [home] as to such time the non-marital home can be refurbished.Â  At the time the home is refurbished [Votor] will have 48 [hours] notice by [Tharington] and she will depart the marital home.Â  [Tharington] is responsible for the costs associated with the refurbished home.Â  \r\n\r\nTharington testified he had the walls of Votorâ€™s house painted and had the carpets professionally steam cleaned.Â  Tharington repaired holes in the sheetrock, a broken glass door in the medicine cabinet, and the broken door on the bathroom vanity, and replaced doorknobs.Â  He also installed a washer and dryer himself.Â  Tharington acknowledged that he had agreed to replace the carpets if needed, but insisted the carpets â€œcleaned up fine.â€Â  In addition, he testified that all of the appliances worked.Â  \r\nVotor testified she wanted Tharington to replace the carpet because her tenantsâ€™ dogs had urinated on them.Â  She stated the pet stains on the carpet quickly reappeared.Â  She purchased new carpet herself and had it installed.Â  She also purchased and had installed new appliances including a refrigerator, dishwasher, stove, and washer.Â  She had a microwave installed over the stove and new shelves installed in the closet.Â  She and her friends repainted the inside of the house.Â  Votor also presented her bills for having cable and utilities hooked up to her house and for $4900.00 in furniture.Â  She asked the court to hold Tharington responsible for these expenses under the consent order.Â  \r\nThe court, however held it would not â€œbe appropriate to make any award for [Tharington] to pay [Votor] as to the alleged costs.Â  To do so would require an interpretation of the term â€˜refurbishmentâ€™ and the testimony presented is insufficient to establish that the parties intended for [Tharington] to make such major improvements to [Votorâ€™s] home.â€Â  \r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in this ruling.Â  Tharington testified that he had completed the â€œrefurbishmentâ€ as required by the consent order while Votor testified his work was incomplete.Â  Although the partiesâ€™ testimony is contradictory, we find the evidence supports the family courtâ€™s holding that Tharington should not be held responsible for the extensive improvements Votor made to her house.Â  \r\nVotor asserts that when the family court declined to hold her in contempt on Tharingtonâ€™s rule to show cause, it tacitly held that Tharington had not completed the refurbishment in accordance with the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â  However, at the hearing on the rule, the family court explained that it was declining to hold Votor in contempt because there had been no â€œmeeting of the mindsâ€ and the parties were not in agreement as to what the word â€œrefurbishâ€ meant.Â  This finding in no way supports Votorâ€™s contention that Tharington should be held in contempt.Â  Rather, the family court declined to hold either party in contempt of the order because, as there was no agreement between the parties, neither party was acting in willful disobedience of the order.\r\nAccordingly, we find the family court did not err in declining to hold Tharington in contempt and refusing to make Tharington responsible for the funds Votor expended improving her house.Â Â Â  \r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name change\r\nVotor argues the family court erred in ordering the partiesâ€™ sonâ€™s name be changed from Aidan John Votor to Aidan John Tharington.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nVotor contends the family court did not have authority to grant the name change because Tharington never requested such relief in his pleading.Â  As Votor failed to raise this issue to the family court, it is not preserved for our review.Â  SeeÂ  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â Â  \r\nThe family court should grant a request to change a childâ€™s surname only if the change promotes the childâ€™s best interests and welfare.Â  Mazzone v. Miles, 341 S.C. 203, 210, 532 S.E.2d 890, 893 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The burden of proving that the change will further the childâ€™s best interests lies on the parent seeking to change the childâ€™s surname.Â  Id.Â  Both parents have an equal interest in the child bearing their respective surname.Â  Id. at 211-12, 532 S.E.2d at 894.\r\nIn Mazzone, this court set out the following factors for the court to consider in a request for childâ€™s name to be changed:Â  \r\n\r\n(1) The length of time that the child has used the present surname; (2) the effect of the change on the preservation and development of the childâ€™s relationship with each parent; (3) the identification of the child as part of a family unit; (4) the wishes of the parents; (5) the stated reason for the proposed change; (6) the motive of the parents and the possibility that the use of a different name will cause insecurity or a lack of identity; (7) the difficulty, harassment, or embarrassment that the child may experience when the child bears a surname different from the custodial parent; (8) theÂ  preference of the child if the child is of an age and maturity to express a meaningful preference; and (9) the degree of community respect associated with the present and proposed surname.Â Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 210-11, 532 S.E.2d at 893-94. \r\nApplying the above factors that are applicable in this case, we find the change of Aidanâ€™s surname to Tharington is in his best interest.Â  Aidan was barely two years old at the time the family court ordered the change of his surname.Â  It is unlikely he had developed a strong identification with the surname Votor at such a young age.Â  There is no indication in the record that the change of Aidanâ€™s last name to Tharington would weaken his relationship with Votor, who appears to be a devoted mother.Â  Tharington also appears to be an involved parent, exercising the visitation awarded to him and requesting more.Â  Although Tharingtonâ€™s relationship with Aidan would probably not be damaged by Aidan retaining the name Votor, the change to Tharington may even strengthen the bond between father and son.Â  \r\nFor the third factor, identification as a family unit, we find no preference in name.Â  Votor does have a daughter from a previous relationship, but as this child has the surname of her father, she and Aidan would have different surnames even if Aidan had the name Votor.Â  \r\nAs to the wishes of the parents, it is obvious both want Aidan to bear his or her own surname.Â  Next, we consider the partiesâ€™ motives.Â  Tharington testified the reason he married Votor was for his son and that it was very important to him for his son to have his last name.Â  There is evidence in the record that although Votor never changed her name on her social security card or driverâ€™s license, she did in fact use the name Tharington.Â  She changed her name to Tharington for her banking and checked into the hospital under the name Tharington when she delivered Aidan.Â  The hospital bills and records list Aidan as â€œBaby Boy Tharington.â€Â  Thus, the record indicates Tharington asked for the change in keeping with the partiesâ€™ understanding of what the childâ€™s name would be.\r\nVotor testified that she gave Aidan her surname because by the time she named him, she knew she was going to be a single parent and she did not want to have three different last names in her household.Â  However, Votorâ€™s attorney gave another motive for the name in a letter dated March 20, 2002, writing:Â  â€œIn a moment of frustration and anger, Ms. Votor did not give Aidan Mr. Tharingtonâ€™s last name but instead used her name.Â  This was because Mr. Tharington was in Tennessee with a paramour throughout the Christmas holidays as well as at the time of the birth of the partiesâ€™ child.â€Â  \r\nConsidering the letter, the family court found Votorâ€™s explanation for giving Aidan her surname was â€œdisingenuous at best.â€Â  The evidence shows a great deal of animosity between the parties at the time of Aidanâ€™s birth and Votorâ€™s decision on his name.Â  On the day before Aidan was born, Tharington left for Tennessee on business, planning to return for the scheduled caesarian section on the following Monday.Â  Votor testified she begged him not to leave because she believed the baby would be born earlier.Â  Tharington did not return before Votor underwent an emergency cesarian section the next day.Â  Tharington came to the hospital that day, but left thirty minutes later after he and Votor had an argument.Â  He did not return during Votor and Aidanâ€™s five-day hospital stay until the day they were to be discharged.Â  Votor testified that it was not until this fifth day she decided to give Aidan the last name Votor.Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe agree with the family court, which was in a better position to judge Votorâ€™s credibility, that her explanation for the naming was disingenous and her actual motive was anger and frustration with Tharington, as stated in her attorneyâ€™s letter. \r\nTharington testified that Votorâ€™s giving the child her surname has been a â€œbone of contentionâ€ since he found out about it.Â  The change of Aidanâ€™s name to Tharington in accordance with what appears to have been the intention of the parties during the pregnancy may in fact alleviate some of the animosity between the parties.Â Â  \r\nThe final applicable factor is the difficulty, harassment, or embarrassment that the child may experience when the child bears a surname different from the custodial parent.Â  Votor currently is the custodial parent.Â  However, Tharington has standard visitation with his son and provides insurance for him.Â  Although the child may experience some â€œdifficulty, harassment, or embarrassmentâ€ from not having the same last name as his mother, he could also experience â€œdifficulty, harassment or embarrassmentâ€ from not having the last name of his father, with whom he spends considerable time.Â  \r\nConsidering the relevant factors, we find it is in Aidanâ€™s best interest that he be given the name Tharington.Â  Accordingly we affirm the family courtâ€™s order changing his name from Aidan John Votor to Aidan John Tharington.2  \r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s fees\r\nFinally, Votor argues the family court erred in awarding her only $2500.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees is within the sound discretion of the family court.Â  See Bowen v. Bowen, 327 S.C. 561, 563, 490 S.E.2d 271, 272 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In determining the reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nThe family court held Votor was entitled to a partial reimbursement of attorneyâ€™s fees, finding at least a portion of the fees incurred were due to the non-cooperation and lack of truthfulness on behalf of Tharington in regards to financial matters.Â  In addition the family court found Tharington was in a much better financial position to satisfy an award of attorneyâ€™s fees and any award of fees would have less impact on Tharington than Votor.Â  The court then thoroughly addressed the Glasscock factors.Â  Importantly, the court found Votor was unsuccessful on almost all monetary issues and the issue of the childâ€™s last name and was only successful in limiting Tharingtonâ€™s request to spend more than standard visitation with his only child.Â  \r\nIn reviewing the factors, we find no abuse of discretion in the family court awarding Votor $2500.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above stated reasons, the order of the family court is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 In determining Aidanâ€™s last name should be changed to Tharington, the family court relied on South Carolina Code section 20-1-70 (1985).Â  Although we find this section not applicable to the present case, we have concluded the change in name is in the childâ€™s best interest and thus affirm the family courtâ€™s decision.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v.

Toal, of Columbia, for Appellant.Â  \r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Samuel Cunningham appeals his convictions for assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature and armed robbery.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the second day of Cunninghamâ€™s trial, a juror, Anthony Dolo, sent a note to the judge indicating that â€œ[he] didnâ€™t realize until the end of the day that [he] went to school with Sam [the defendant].Â  [He] wasnâ€™t friends with him.Â  He [the defendant] was in a higher grade . . .â€Â  Following the disclosure of this information, the solicitor requested that Dolo be replaced with an alternate juror.Â  Cunninghamâ€™s counsel objected on the basis that the dismissal of the juror would violate Cunninghamâ€™s rights.Â  Nevertheless, the trial court granted the request and replaced Dolo with an alternate.Â  \r\nDuring the course of the trial, Cunningham elected not to testify in his own behalf.Â  During closing arguments, the solicitor made reference to money found in Cunninghamâ€™s home subsequent to the robbery at issue.Â  The solicitor stated: Â â€œThe one thing you never got an explanation of is all this money, all this money, all this money thatâ€™s found 16 hours --.â€Â  Cunningham immediately objected to the comment.Â  A conference was held off the record, and the solicitor resumed his argument.Â  \r\nLater in his closing, the solicitor stated â€œwhen they described Samuel Cunningham that night [the night of the robbery], they said he was calm.Â  Thatâ€™s the one thing they said about him, unlike Ronnie Davis [another defendant], he was calm.Â  I think he sat through this entire trial and --.â€Â  Cunningham objected, and the objection was sustained.Â  \r\nDuring the initial jury charge, the judge instructed the jury that the defendant has a constitutional right to remain silent and has no responsibility to explain anything.Â  He further advised that the defendantâ€™s decision not to testify should not be considered in the deliberations in any way.Â  \r\nCunningham argued the instruction did not adequately cure any prejudice caused by the solicitorâ€™s previous comments.Â  He claimed the Stateâ€™s first remark about the money that was found implied that the failure to testify and offer an explanation was somehow indicative of guilt.Â  Furthermore, the defense claimed the reference to the robberâ€™s calm demeanor and Cunninghamâ€™s behavior at trial could cause the jury to draw impermissible inferences from Cunninghamâ€™s exercise of the right to remain silent.Â  \r\nIn response to Cunninghamâ€™s objection, the trial court re-charged the jury extensively on the subject of the defendantâ€™s constitutional right to remain silent and the legal concept that such silence could not be held against him in any way during jury deliberations.Â  No further objection was made, and no motion for a mistrial was made.Â  The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhether to replace a juror with an alternate is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and [an appellate court] will not reverse him on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Hurd, 325 S.C. 384, 480 S.E.2d 94, 97 (Ct. App. 1996) (internal citations omitted).Â  â€œIt is impermissible for the prosecution to comment, directly or indirectly, upon the defendantâ€™s failure to testify.Â  However, improper comments on a defendantâ€™s failure to testify do not automatically require reversal if they are not prejudicial to the defendant.â€Â  Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 187, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997) (internal citations omitted).Â  An instruction is usually deemed to have cured an error unless, on the facts of the particular case, it is probable that notwithstanding such instruction or withdrawal the accused was prejudiced.Â  State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 89-90, 512 S.E.2d 795, 801 (1999). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Dismissal of Juror\r\nCunningham argues on appeal that the trial court committed reversible error and violated Doloâ€™s rights by removing him from the jury.Â  Cunningham also contends that the trial court failed to conduct a probing inquiry to determine if Dolo was unqualified.Â  See State v. Hurd, 325 S.C. 384, 480 S.E.2d at 97 (â€œ[I]t is incumbent upon the trial court to conduct a probing and tactful inquiry to determine whether a sworn juror is unqualified . . . .â€).Â  Although the procedure employed by the trial court may have been irregular, we are not required to address that issue because the record clearly shows that Cunninghamâ€™s objection at trial was based on his rights and not the rights of the juror.Â  \r\nIt is well settled that a ground not argued at trial cannot be raised and argued for the first time on appeal.Â  State v. Davis, 354 S.C. 348, 361, 580 S.E.2d 778, 785 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing State v. Dickman, 341 S.C. 293, 524 S.E.2d 268 (2000)); Durham v. Vinson, 360 S.C. 639, 654, 602 S.E.2d 760, 767 (2004) (citing Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996)).Â  Consequently, any contention regarding Doloâ€™s rights is not preserved for our review.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Improper Argument\r\nCunningham next argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the remarks by the State in closing argument were improper and prejudicial, and not cured by the trial courtâ€™s re-charge to the jury.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nCunninghamâ€™s first objection to the argument that the jury â€œnever got an explanation of all this money. . . .â€ resulted in a bench conference, but no ruling on the objection on the record.Â  Consequently, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See State v. Rogers, 361 S.C. 178, 183, 603 S.E.2d 910, 912-13 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding that an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order to be preserved for appellate review.)Â  \r\nIn like fashion, the objection to the Stateâ€™s second â€œdemeanorâ€ argument is not preserved.Â  Cunninghamâ€™s contemporaneous objection to that remark was sustained and, upon his request, the trial court gave a more explicit curative instruction to ameliorate any prejudice the two remarks may have created.Â  However, no objection followed.Â  â€œ[N]o issue is preserved for appellate review if the objecting party accepts the judgeâ€™s ruling and does not contemporaneously make an additional objection to the sufficiency of the curative charge or move for a mistrial.â€Â  State v. McCord, 349 S.C. 477, 486, 562 S.E.2d 689, 694 (Ct. App. 2002) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, Cunninghamâ€™s convictions are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-542","title":"GMAC v.

Simpson, of Charlotte, North Carolina and James W. Bradford, Jr., of York, for Appellant.\r\nRobert C. Byrd, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corporation (GMAC) filed this action to collect on 24 loans personally guaranteed by F.C. â€œTallyâ€ Roberts, Jr.Â  The trial court granted GMACâ€™s motion to add U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank) as a party plaintiff.Â  The court also granted GMACâ€™s motion to strike Robertsâ€™ demand for a jury trial.Â  Roberts appeals.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe guaranties in this case secured loans totaling greater than $18 million made by Franchise Mortgage Acceptance Company, LLC to either Acme Petroleum and Fuel Company or Acme Properties Limited Partnership (Borrowers).Â  Roberts was the chief executive officer of Borrowers and personally guaranteed the loans.Â  U.S. Bank is the current owner and holder of the loans and guaranties.Â  GMAC is the servicer of the loans and is allegedly authorized to sue on U.S. Bankâ€™s behalf. Â \r\nAfter Borrowers defaulted, GMAC filed this collection action.[1]Â  In response, Roberts demanded a jury trial and asserted that GMAC is not the real party in interest and lacks standing to bring the action.Â Â  GMAC moved to join U.S. Bank as a party plaintiff and to strike Robertsâ€™ demand for a jury trial based on waivers contained in the guaranties.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the jury trial waivers to be valid and enforceable and granted the motion to join U.S. Bank as a party plaintiff. Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Joinder of U.S. Bank as a Party Plaintiff\r\nRoberts contends the trial court erred in granting the motion to join U.S. Bank as a party plaintiff.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure permit â€œall personsâ€ to join an action as plaintiffs â€œif they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all these persons will arise in the action.â€Â  Rule 20(a), SCRCP.Â  In Twelfth RMA Partners v. National Safe Corp., 335 S.C. 635, 638, 518 S.E.2d 44, 45-46 (Ct. App. 1999), a party who was not the holder of a note and guaranty moved on the day of trial to substitute the holder of the note as the proper party.Â  The court allowed the substitution finding no prejudice to the defendant as no new claims were added and the subject of the claim remained the same.Â  Id. at 641, 518 S.E.2d at 47.Â  The court therefore concluded the defendant suffered no prejudice.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAlthough U.S. Bank was added rather than substituted, we find the analysis in Twelfth RMA Partners sound.Â  U.S. Bankâ€™s claim arises from the same transactions or occurrences as GMACâ€™s claimâ€”the notes and guaranties.Â  Furthermore, the trial court correctly noted that any substantive defenses Roberts has may still be asserted at trial.Â  Roberts has failed to show any prejudice resulting from the joinder.Â  We find the motion for joinder was properly granted.Â  \r\nII.Â  Waiver of Right to Jury Trial\r\nRoberts next argues the trial court erred in granting GMACâ€™s motion to strike his demand for a jury trial, in part because GMAC did not have standing to assert the waivers.Â  We find no error. \r\nFirst, we find GMACâ€™s alleged lack of standing immaterial as we find the trial court properly allowed the Bank to be joined as a party.Â  On the merits of the waivers, we likewise find no error.Â  Each guaranty contains the following provision:\r\n\r\n21.Â Â Â Â  NO JURY TRIAL.Â  The Guarantors waive all rights to trial by jury in any litigation or other proceeding relating to or arising out of this Guaranty or any of the other Loan Documents.Â  The Guarantors acknowledge that:Â  (i) the provisions of this waiver have been fully disclosed to and discussed by each Guarantor and the Lender, and shall be subject to no exceptions; (ii) this waiver is made knowingly, intentionally and willingly by each Guarantor as part of a bargained-for loan transaction; and (iii) the Lender has not in any way agreed with, represented or intimated to any Guarantor or any of their representatives that the provisions of this waiver shall not be fully enforced in all instances.Â  \r\n\r\nEach guaranty also contains a choice of law provision stating that the law of Connecticut applies.Â  \r\nRoberts argues North Carolina law applies under the law of lex loci rei sitae[2] because North Carolina was the principal place of business and the state of Borrowersâ€™ organization.[3]Â  We disagree.Â  A guarantorâ€™s liability is a separate contractual obligation, independent of the obligation on the original note.Â  TranSouth Fin. Corp. v. Cochran,&nbsp;324 S.C. 290, 295, 478 S.E.2d 63, 65&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996).Â  Additionally, parties may contractually choose the law that will govern the transaction.Â  See Lybrand v. Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 321 S.C. 70, 74, 467 S.E.2d 745, 747&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (enforcing a choice of law provision in an arbitration agreement); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-1-105(1) (2003) (providing that the parties to a transaction may choose by agreement which stateâ€™s law will apply).Â  Furthermore, a number of the loans in this case were secured by property located in South Carolina.Â  We agree with the trial courtâ€™s finding that the guaranties were governed by either South Carolina or Connecticut law.Â  \r\nUnder Connecticut law, contractual jury trial waivers are presumptively valid.Â  L &amp; R Realty v. Connecticut Natâ€™l Bank,&nbsp;715 A.2d 748, 755&nbsp;(Conn. 1998).Â  To rebut this presumption, the party seeking to avoid the waiver must present evidence that it clearly did not intend to waive the right to a jury trial.Â  Id. at 755-56.Â  Likewise, under South Carolina law, a party may waive the right to a jury trial by contract.Â  Beach Co. v. Twillman, Ltd.,&nbsp;351 S.C. 56, 63-64, 566 S.E.2d 863, 866&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  Because the right to trial by jury is a substantial right, the terms of the waiver must be strictly construed.Â  Id.Â  However, the terms of the waiver must be construed using their plain, ordinary and popular meaning.Â  Id.Â  \r\nRoberts argues the waivers are not enforceable because they were not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made, in part because he allegedly did not have an opportunity to read the documents at closing.Â  South Carolina law is settled that a person who signs a contract cannot avoid the effect of the document by claiming he did not read it.Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 663, 582 S.E.2d 432, 440&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  Under Connecticut law, the burden is on the party seeking to avoid a waiver.Â  L &amp; R Realty,&nbsp;715 A.2d at 755.Â  \r\nRoberts relies on his affidavit, which states he did not have the opportunity to read the agreements at closing.Â  However, the guaranties provide that Roberts made the waivers knowingly and voluntarily.Â  Furthermore, Roberts is an experienced business person and was represented by a prominent law firm at the time he executed the guaranties.Â  Robertsâ€™ counsel issued an opinion letter to the lender stating he had examined the loan documents and guaranties and had represented Roberts in the transaction.Â  The opinion letter clearly indicated a thorough review of the guaranties, including the waiver provisions.Â  As did the trial court, we find the waiver provisions valid under either South Carolina or Connecticut law.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Unpreserved Issues\r\nRoberts raised the following unpreserved issues on appeal:Â  1) application of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-15-102(a); 2) GMACâ€™s waiver by delay; 3) application of waiver of jury trial provision to tort counterclaims; 4) GMACâ€™s improper use of joinder rules; and 5) GMACâ€™s reliance on irrelevant materials not timely submitted to the court.Â  As to the first three issues, these issues are not preserved for appellate review, as they were not ruled upon by the trial court.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  As to the fourth and fifth issues, these issues are not preserved as they were raised for the first time in Robertsâ€™ reply brief.Â  See Continental Ins. Co. v. Shives, 328 S.C. 470, 474 n.2, 492 S.E.2d 808, 811 n.2 (Ct. App. 1997) (An appellant may not use the reply brief to argue issues not argued in the initial brief.).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court properly granted the motion to join U.S. Bank as a party plaintiff.Â  We further find the jury trial waiver provisions are valid and enforceable under either South Carolina or Connecticut law.Â  Accordingly, the order on appeal is \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\n HEARN, C.J., STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nGMAC originally brought this action in North Carolina and Roberts objected on the ground of lack of personal jurisdiction, as he is a South Carolina resident.Â  GMAC voluntarily dismissed the North Carolina action without prejudice and filed this action in South Carolina.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe law of the place where a thing is located.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 911 (6th ed. 1990).\r\n[3]&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnder North Carolina law, a provision for the waiver of the right to a jury trial is unconscionable and unenforceable.Â  N.C.

Borg-Warner Acceptance Corp., 279 S.C. 90, 92, 302 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1983).Â  â€œIn an appeal of an equitable action tried before a master authorized to enter final judgment, this Court must review the entire record and make its own\r\nfindings of fact according to its view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  This requirement does not, however, command us to ignore the findings of the trial judge . . . .â€Â  Thomas v. Mitchell, 287 S.C. 35, 37-38, 336 S.E.2d 154, 155 (Ct. App. 1985).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe Jamroks argue the special refereeâ€™s decision was in error because the Rogerses and Lunn did not have the right to build the fence so as to exclude them from a common area within the subdivision.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Jamroks contend that the designation of the pond as â€œPondâ€ on the plat of the subdivision makes the pond and the surrounding shoreline common areas from which they cannot be excluded.Â  Assuming arguendo that the pond is a common area, the Jamroks have offered no evidence that they have been excluded from the waters of the pond.Â  Therefore, the only area in issue is the shoreline.Â  \r\nA review of the plat for the subdivision shows the pond is designated as â€œPond,â€ but the area of shoreline immediately adjacent thereto is not marked as common area.Â  See Hamilton v. CCM, Inc., 274 S.C. 152, 158, 263 S.E.2d 378, 381 (1980) (examining a subdivision plat for evidence of a dedicated open space).Â  Neither the Jamroksâ€™ deed nor the Rogersesâ€™ deed references any common areas, and an examination of the protective covenants of the subdivision reveals nothing designating the shoreline as common area.Â  See Newington Plantation Estates Assâ€™n. v. Newington Plantation Estates, 318 S.C. 362, 365, 458 S.E.2d 36, 38 (1995) (reviewing a property ownerâ€™s deed and the relevant restrictive covenants for evidence of easement).Â  Consequently, there is no evidence to support the Jamroksâ€™ argument that the shoreline is a common area.Â  \r\nIt is important to note that while the shoreline is not a common area, it is also not the private property of the Jamroks or the Rogerses.Â  It is undisputed that the property lines of both the Jamroks and the Rogerses do not extend all the way to the pond.Â  The shoreline is still under the control of the developer, and its use is governed by the protective covenants of the subdivision.Â  Pursuant to those covenants, the developer retained the right to grant an easement of this type over the shoreline and into the water.[2]Â  Both the Rogerses and their predecessors sought and obtained permission to construct a fence.Â  We find no reason why the provisions of the restrictive covenants are not controlling.Â  \r\nTherefore, we find the shoreline surrounding the pond is not a common area, and the developer was within his rights when he consented to the construction of the fencing.Â  Accordingly the findings of the special referee are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nâ€œ11.Â  No fences of any kind shall be built on or around any of said numbered lots without the written approval of John E.

Ariail of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: David Paul Cordle appeals his conviction of failure to stop for a blue light on the basis of an improper jury charge. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 23, 2002, David Cordle, while driving his vehicle, passed Sergeant Rodney Turner and Investigator Wendy Alley on Highway 14 in Greenville County.Â  The posted speed limit on Highway 14 was 45 miles per hour, but Cordle appeared to be traveling at a significantly higher rate of speed.Â  Sergeant Turner and Investigator Alley, of the Greenville-Spartanburg Airport Police, followed and paced Cordle for approximately two miles, eventually determining that the defendant was traveling between 62 and 65 miles per hour.Â  \r\nSergeant Turner turned on the vehicleâ€™s blue lights and siren, but Cordle refused to stop.Â  Instead, he increased his speed to over 70 miles per hour. Â Cordle was forced to stop about 1 Â½ miles due to heavy traffic at an intersection.Â  When Sergeant Turner approached Cordleâ€™s car, he asked him to either roll down the window completely or get out of the car.Â  Cordle refused. Â Cordleâ€™s window was rolled down just far enough for Sergeant Turner to stick his hand through in an attempt to turn off the engine and retrieve the keys.Â  Once Sergeant Turner placed his hand in the car window, Cordle grabbed his fingers and rolled-up the window on Sergeant Turnerâ€™s arm.Â  They struggled, and Sergeant Turner freed his arm.Â  Investigator Alley opened the car door and removed Cordle from his vehicle. Â Sergeant Turner and Investigator Alley placed him under arrest.Â  \r\nA jury found Cordle guilty on one count of failure to stop for a blue light.Â  He was sentenced to 2 years incarceration, which was suspended to 30 days and 2 years of probation.Â  The circuit court judge allowed Cordle to delay his sentence due to a family medical emergency.Â  The judge warned Cordle that his sentence would be reconsidered if he did not report as ordered.Â  Cordle did not report as required, and he was apprehended in Alabama a few months later.Â  The circuit judge reviewed Cordleâ€™s record, and revoked his probation on prior charges.Â  Prior probation was revoked because Cordle tested positive for methamphetamine, was in arrears regarding his supervision fee, was terminated from the offender treatment program for failure to submit a urine screen and failure to attend class, and was terminated from another treatment program for noncompliance with attendance requirements.Â  Based on Cordleâ€™s behavior, the circuit court judge sentenced him to three years of incarceration.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nÂ When reviewing jury charges for error, the appellate court must consider the jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial. Â State v. Todd, 290 S.C 212, 349 S.E.2d 460, 464 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 577 S.E.2d 460, 464 (Ct. App. 2003). â€œIf the charge as a whole is reasonably free from error, isolated portions of the charge which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€Â  Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., Â 334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570,575 (1999); Cole v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas, Inc., 355 S.C. 183, 191, 584 S.E.2d 405,410 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  This court must determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood the jury applied a challenged reasonable doubt instruction in a manner that violates the Constitution.Â  State v. Alesky, 343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248, 251 (2000).Â  Â \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJury Instruction \r\nCordle argues that the circuit courtâ€™s jury instruction regarding reasonable doubt unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof which caused the jury to apply a reduced burden of proof.Â  We disagree. \r\nDue process does not require that any particular type of words be used to advise the jury of the governmentâ€™s burden of proof, provided the trial court properly instructs the jury that the defendantâ€™s guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1,5 (1994).Â  Jury instructions are required to correctly communicate the concept of reasonable doubt and nothing more.Â  Id.Â  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required in criminal cases by due process; however, trial courts are not required to define reasonable doubt.Â  Victor, 511 U.S. 1,5; see also State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996) (trial judge has the discretion to refuse to define reasonable doubt). \r\nJury charges should be examined in their entirety when analyzing whether a defendantâ€™s due process rights have been violated.Â  Todd v. State, 355 S.C 396, 585 S.E.2d 305, 308 (2003).Â  When read as a whole, a jury charge must be substantially correct and cover the law.Â  Adkins, 577 S.E.2d at 463.Â  The substance of the law must be covered in the jury charge.Â  Id.Â  The court instructed the jury:\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Now in a criminal prosecution of this type as I have said several times, the state, the prosecution fully has the burden of proof. The defense has no burden of proof in these cases.Â  In this state, according to our laws, the prosecution must prove its case to the standard of proof we call â€œbeyond a reasonable doubtâ€ before a finding of guilt may occur.Â  If the state fails to meet this high burden, and it is a high burden, the defendant is entitled to acquittal. \r\nSo to that you say, â€œwell, then what is a reasonable doubt?â€ It is not an imaginary, or a fanciful doubt, or a weak doubt.Â  It is a substantial doubt.Â  It is a doubt which the words imply, a doubt for which you can give or assign a reason based on the testimony and the evidence in the case.Â  A reasonable doubt is not any sort of a doubt you and I know from everyday life experiences. We may have a doubt about any sort of matter no matter how trivial it may be, what tie to wear, what clothes to wear on any occasion. What would I sayâ€”thatâ€™s not a reasonable doubt. \r\nWhat a reasonable doubt is is [sic] a doubt which makes an honest sincere, conscientious juror in search of the truth hesitate to act.Â Â  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the defendantâ€™s guilt.Â  If you have a doubt for which you can give or assign a reason as to the guilt of the defendant then he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty.â€ \r\n\r\n(R. 142-143). \r\nThe language from the jury charge, â€œa doubt which makes an honest, sincere, conscientious juror in search of the truth hesitate to act,â€ and â€œa doubt for which you can give or assign a reason,â€ has been upheld as Constitutional by this appellate court.Â  State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 508 S.E.2d 857, 866-67 (1998).Â Â  The judge repeatedly informed the jury that the state, not the defense, bore the burden of proof.Â  The court properly instructed the jury regarding the reasonable doubt standard by informing the jury that the state had to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  The circuit court did not err in its jury instruction.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, Cordlesâ€™ conviction and sentence are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concurÂ  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-545","title":"State v.

Cisa, of Mt. Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\nDonna E. Lewis, Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This is an appeal from a post-divorce action in which the trial court denied Husbandâ€™s request to reduce his child support obligation, to require Wife to maintain health insurance for the two minor children, and to award him costs and attorneyâ€™s fees, based on a substantial change in his financial condition.[1]Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and modify in part.[2]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nDonna E. Lewis (Wife) and Michael E. Landry, Sr. (Husband) were married on July 18, 1994.Â  On June 26, 2001, the trial court granted Wife a divorce on the grounds of â€œhabitual drunkenness caused by the use of illicit drugs.â€Â  In addition, the trial court adopted the partiesâ€™ separation and property settlement agreement, which, among other things, granted custody of the coupleâ€™s two children to Wife and provided Husband would pay $1,300 per month in child support to Wife, based on his imputed income of $80,000.Â  In February 2003, Husband requested a reduction in child support, maintenance of health insurance for the partiesâ€™ children by Wife, and award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to Husband, based upon the loss of his business â€œdue to serious and significant financial difficulties.â€Â  In an amended complaint, Husband also requested â€œspecific rights of visitation with his minor children.â€Â  \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s temporary order, issued in December 2003, temporarily denied Husbandâ€™s request for a reduction in child support.Â  However, the trial court ordered Husband to â€œpay the sum of $1,000 per month of his child support obligation with the remaining amount of $300 per month to accrue.â€Â  \r\nAt the final hearing, Husband claimed his construction business closed as a result of losing Wifeâ€™s contributions to the operation of the business upon the partiesâ€™ divorce, his extended gall-bladder illness, and his on-going cocaine addition.Â  Husband further presented evidence that since he closed his business in 2002, he has not made more that $910 per week, averaging a gross monthly income of $3,943.Â  Husband also received workersâ€™ compensation from a recent work-related injury, but expected to be back to work in ten to twelve weeks from the date of the hearing.Â  \r\nThe trial court found Husbandâ€™s â€œbusiness, closed as a result of the loss of the partnership responsibilities he shared with [Wife] who worked with him during the marriage, and the fact that [Wife] had contributed to the business prior to the partiesâ€™ separation.â€Â  The trial court also attributed blame to Husbandâ€™s drug abuse and gall-bladder disease, which occurred approximately 18 months prior to the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  Nevertheless, the trial court concluded Husband did not show a substantial change of circumstances justifying a reduction in his ongoing child support on a permanent basis because â€œ[c]hanges in financial status as a result of the property division from the divorce are generally in the contemplation of the parties at the time of the divorce and do not qualify as a substantial change.â€Â  The trial court ordered reinstatement of the original child support order on November 1, 2004, less than five months from the hearing date (giving Husband sufficient time to recuperate physically), and required Husband to pay â€œan additional twenty (20%) percent of the on-going child support towards the accumulated child support arrearage.â€Â  It also ordered Husband to provide health insurance for the minor children and pay half of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees, which amounted to $1,930.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard the findings of the trial court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the trial court, who saw and heard the witnesses,\r\nwas in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nHusband claims the trial court erred in failing to reduce his child support obligation because his business failed as a result of the loss of the partnership responsibilities with Wife during the marriage, his gall-bladder disease, and his drug addiction.Â  Further, Husband argues he never made $80,000 annually despite a statement to the contrary in the settlement agreement.Â  We disagree.\r\nChild support awards are within the sound discretion of the trial court and, absent an abuse of discretion, will not be disturbed on appeal.Â \r\nStevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  In determining child support, the trial court must consider both partiesâ€™ incomes, abilities to pay, education, expenses, assets and the facts and circumstances of each case.Â Â  Id.  \r\nThe issue of child support is subject to the continuing review of the family court.Â  Id.Â  Child support may be modified upon a proper showing of a change in either the childâ€™s needs or the supporting parentâ€™s financial ability.Â  Calvert v. Calvert, 287 S.C. 130, 137, 336 S.E.2d 884, 888 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  It is necessary to show a sufficient change in conditions or circumstances of one or more of the parties or principals.Â  Id.Â  â€œA downward modification of child support based upon a decrease in the noncustodial parentâ€™s income is not warranted absent a strong showing by the party seeking the change that he is no longer in a condition to make the support payments prescribed by an earlier Family Court order.â€Â  Miller v. Miller, 299 S.C. 307, 310-11, 384 S.E.2d 715, 717 (1989).Â  Changes in financial status as a result of the property division from the divorce are generally in the contemplation of the parties at the time of the divorce and do not qualify as a substantial change.Â  Kielar v. Kielar, 311 S.C. 466, 470, 429 S.E.2d 851, 853 (Ct. App. 1993); Kneece v. Kneece, 296 S.C. 28, 35-36, 370 S.E.2d 288, 292-93 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nHusband suffered from a gall bladder condition in the eighteen months prior to the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  In addition, Husbandâ€™s drug addiction can be traced as far back as 1982. Â In fact, Wife testified Husbandâ€™s drug addiction contributed significantly to the failure of their marriage.Â  Lastly, Husband knew before he signed the settlement agreement that Wife would no longer assist him in the business.Â  Therefore, the changes in his financial status from the illnesses and as a result of the separation were well-within Husbandâ€™s contemplation at the time of the divorce when he signed the settlement agreement stating he made $80,000 annually.Â  Furthermore, Husbandâ€™s financial difficulties are a direct result of many of his own actions.Â  Wife, on the other hand, through no fault of her own, should not be required to lower her and the childrenâ€™s standard of living. \r\nHusband testified he has made substantial efforts to recover from his drug addiction and, in fact, has been drug free since November 2003.Â  His gall bladder disease is no longer an issue.Â  Furthermore, though he suffered an elbow injury, he expected to return to work soon after the final hearing.Â  We acknowledge Husbandâ€™s efforts to remain drug free and get back to work so that he may provide for his children.Â  Therefore, we modify the trial courtâ€™s final order and forgive Husbandâ€™s arrearages that accrued subsequent to the filing of the pleadings up and until November 1, 2004.Â  We also modify the trial courtâ€™s order, relating to the additional sum Husband is required to pay to reduce any remaining arrearage, from 20% of the ordered amount ($1,300 per month) to $100 per month.Â  However, Husband failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffered a sufficient change in his financial condition to warrant a downward modification of child support.Â  Therefore, as of November 1, 2004, Husband is ordered to pay the $1,300 per month in child support as awarded to Wife in the original action plus $100 per month toward the arrearage.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s order is hereby \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND MODIFIED IN PART.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] Wife did not file a Respondentâ€™s brief.Â  Thus, she is bound by the matters stated in Appellantâ€™s statement of the case.Â  See Rule 208(b)(2), SCACR.Â  Moreover, under Rule 208, SCACR, we may take such action as we deem proper.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-549","title":"Jacobs v.

Jackson.Â  We affirm.Â  1\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 6, 1999, Jacobs and Jackson were involved in an automobile accident at an intersection controlled by a traffic light.Â  Both parties contended they had the right of way through the intersection.Â  According to the investigating officer, Brad Sawyer, Jacobs told him that she had stopped at the red light and then proceeded through the intersection when the light turned green.Â  Sawyer testified that Jackson stated the light had turned yellow, but â€œshe thought she had it and could beat it.â€Â  In his accident report, Sawyer noted that Jackson failed to yield the right of way at the traffic light and struck Jacobsâ€™ vehicle.Â  During his testimony, Sawyer opined that Jackson was at fault.Â  The court ruled that Sawyer was not allowed to give his opinion and instructed the jury that the determination of who was at fault was left to them.Â  \r\nDuring the trial, Jackson testified that the light was green when she entered the intersection.Â  At the time of the trial, Jackson was 82 years old.Â  \r\nThe jury found in favor of Jackson.Â  They answered â€œnoâ€ to the following question: â€œDo you find that the defendant was negligent and that such negligence proximately caused the plaintiffâ€™s injuries.â€Â  The trial court denied Jacobsâ€™ post-trial motions.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn her statement of the issues on appeal, Jacobs sets forth 3 issues:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Whether defendant-respondent is immune from all liability due to her age based on the grounds of negligence that led to an auto accident.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2.&nbsp;\r\n         Whether Judge erred in not allowing Officer for Appellant to convey all facts during trial that disallowed due process.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        3.&nbsp;\r\n         Whether ruling in case against appellant was based on lack of evidence or did the arms of justice elude appellant based on fact respondent was elderly, the jurors knew respondent and exhibited sympathy based on her location and age.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHowever, Jacobsâ€™ entire argument section is only one page long and fails to cite to any relevant authority.Â  Accordingly, her argument may be deemed conclusory and abandoned. See Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œSouth Carolina law clearly states that short, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for review.â€); State v. Colf, 332 S.C. 313, 504 S.E.2d 360 (Ct. App. 1998) (deeming abandoned a conclusory, two-paragraph argument that cited no authority other than an evidentiary rule).Â  The fact that Jacobs is proceeding pro se does not relieve her of the responsibility of complying with all procedural and substantive requirements.Â  See State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, 589 S.E.2d 6, 9 n.5 (2003) (â€œA pro se litigant who knowingly elects to represent himself assumes full responsibility for complying with substantive and procedural requirements of the law.â€).\r\nAlthough we recommend affirming with a Rule 220, SCACR, opinion we will briefly address Jacobsâ€™ issues.Â  \r\nJacobs argues the trial court erred in not allowing the investigating officer to convey all of the facts.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nOfficer Sawyer testified that because of Jacksonâ€™s age, he did not issue a citation to her, even though she was at fault.Â  Jacksonâ€™s attorney objected to Sawyer testifying as to fault.Â  The trial court instructed the jury that the determination of who was at fault was for them to make.Â  Sawyer attempted to argue against this ruling, but the court affirmed that it would not permit him to give his opinion as to who caused the accident.Â  Jacobs did not make any argument against this ruling nor did she proffer any testimony further on the issue.Â  She never attempted to have Sawyer designated an expert witness.Â  \r\nA trial judgeâ€™s decision to admit or exclude evidence is within his discretion and will not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion occurs. Â Â Pike v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 343 S.C. 224, 234, 540 S.E.2d 87, 92 (2000).Â  Rule 701, SCRE provides:Â  â€œIf the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witnessâ€™s testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which (a) are rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) are helpful to a clear understanding of the witnessâ€™s testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) do not require special knowledge, skill, experience or training.â€Â  â€œA long line of South Carolina decisions has excluded the opinions of investigating police officers in automobile accident cases.â€Â  Gulledge v. McLaughlin, 328 S.C. 504, 508, 492 S.E.2d 816, 818Â  (Ct. App. 1997); see State v. Kelly, 285 S.C. 373, 374, 329 S.E.2d 442, 443 (1985) (â€œA police officer may not give his opinions as to the cause of an accident.Â  He may only testify regarding his direct observations unless he is qualified as an expert.â€).Â Â  \r\nSawyer acknowledged that he did not see the accident occur, nor did he speak to any witnesses to the accident, or view any pictures or videotape of the accident.Â  His conclusion was based solely on the partiesâ€™ statements to him.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s exclusion of his opinion.Â  \r\nJacobs also contends that Jackson was at fault for the accident.Â  We find no reversible error.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of this Court extends merely to the correction of errors of law, and a factual finding of the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses that there is no evidence which reasonably supports the juryâ€™s findings.â€Â Â  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\n\r\n[I]t is not unusual for a case to have contradictory evidence and inconsistent testimony from a witness.Â  In a law case tried before a jury, it is the jury that must decide what part of the witnessâ€™s testimony it wants to believe and what part it wants to disbelieve.Â  Under such circumstances, it is not the function of this Court to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of the witnesses.Â  \r\n\r\nSmall v. Pioneer Machinery, Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 465, 494 S.E.2d 835, 843-44 (Ct. App.1997).\r\nIn the present case, both parties claimed to have the right-of-way.Â  Although there is contrary evidence, Jacksonâ€™s testimony that she had the green light supports the juryâ€™s verdict in her favor.Â  Accordingly, we must affirm the verdict.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-550","title":"Clayton v.

Â \r\nOn June 17, 2002, the trial court granted Wife a divorce based on one yearâ€™s separation and reserved jurisdiction to determine equitable division.Â  Upon completion of court-ordered appraisals of the real property and farm equipment, the family court issued a final order as to the division of marital property, providing â€œthat all marital assets should be divided on a 50/50 basis,â€ excepting â€œsome slight differences in the values of the direct retirement accounts of the parties.â€Â  The trial court specifically found â€œTract #1,â€ a 97-acre parcel of land with a residence and several farm buildings valued at $147,000, â€œto be marital property and is to be included in the marital estate.â€Â  The 97-acre parcel designated â€œTract #1â€ in the family court order consisted of the 25-acre tract acquired in 1955 and the 72-acre tract acquired by inheritance in 1967.Â  \r\nBoth parties filed motions for reconsideration.Â  The family court issued an order clarifying the original distribution of both partiesâ€™ deferred compensation accounts, valuing the Husbandâ€™s accounts at $298,217, as listed in his financial declaration, and Wifeâ€™s account at $51,600.Â  In all other regards, the order reiterated the family courtâ€™s prior order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We remain mindful that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Transmutation\r\nHusband claims the trial court erred in finding the 72-acre parcel he inherited from his father was transmuted into marital property.Â  We agree.\r\nMarital property is generally defined as all real and personal property acquired by the parties during the marriage that is owned on the date of filing or commencement of the marital litigation, regardless of how legal title is held.Â Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004).Â  Exempted from the above definition, however, is â€œproperty acquired by either party by inheritance, devise, bequest, or gift from a party other than the spouse.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(1) (Supp. 2004).Â  Upon dissolution of the marriage, marital property should be divided and distributed in a manner that fairly reflects each spouseâ€™s contribution to its acquisition.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 293, 372 S.E.2d 107, 109 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The family court, however, has no jurisdiction to divide nonmarital property.Â  Skipper v. Skipper, 290 S.C. 412, 413. 351 S.E.2d 153, 154 (1986).Â  \r\nIn certain circumstances, nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property if:Â  (1) it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable;Â  (2) it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property.Â Â  Johnson, 296 S.C. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110.Â  Whether or not nonmarital property has been transmuted is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIt is well settled that â€œthe spouse claiming an equitable interest in property upon dissolution of the marriage has the burden of proving the property is part of the marital estate.â€Â  Id. at 294, 372 S.E.2d at 110Â  (citing Roberts v. Roberts, 296 S.C. 93, 370 S.E.2d 881 (Ct. App. 1988)).Â  Thus, a spouse\r\nclaiming transmutation must produce objective evidence showing that, during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.Â  Id. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110-111.Â  \r\nIn the present case, Wifeâ€™s sole basis for proving transmutation was some nonspecific testimony by the parties that Husband sporadically used some marital income in support of the farming business, which he operated on the land in question, as well as proceeds from the business in support of the marriage.Â  â€œThe mere use of separate property to support the marriage, without some additional evidence of intent to treat it as property of the marriage, is not sufficient to establish transmutation.â€Â  Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 88, 467 S.E.2d 753, 756 (Ct. App. 1996), affâ€™d as modified, 329 S.C. 324, 494 S.E.2d 820 (1998); see also Murray v. Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 157, 439 S.E.2d 312, 315 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Wife presented no additional evidence that the couple regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.Â  Accordingly, the family court erred in finding the inherited 72-acre parcel was transmuted into marital property.\r\nII. Valuation of deferred compensation accounts\r\nHusband claims the trial court erred in computing and allocating the total value of the deferred compensation accounts of the parties.Â  We agree and remand the case for a reevaluation of this issue.Â  \r\nIn order to equitably divide the partiesâ€™ deferred compensation accounts, the family court valued the accounts of each spouse, added both together, and granted each spouse 50% of the total.Â  In valuing Husbandâ€™s accounts, the family court relied on the value presented by Husband in his financial declaration, $298,217.Â  Our concern, however, lies with the valuation of Wifeâ€™s accounts.Â  Documents provided in the record on appeal vaguely reflect three differing values attributed to Wifeâ€™s accounts - $75,609.05, $126,858.08, and $70, 047.77.Â  Addressing this issue, the family courtâ€™s final order simply states, â€œ[Wife] also had a deferred compensation account that had a present value of $51,600.00 at the time of filing.â€Â  We find, as Wifeâ€™s counsel conceded in oral argument, nothing whatsoever in the record supporting this valuation.Â  Because the family courtâ€™s order and record on appeal provide no guidance as to how this figure was determined, we remand this issue for reconsideration.\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the family courtâ€™s decision is hereby\r\n REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-552","title":"State Capital Insurance Company v.

Smith also appeals a portion of the order.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn July 18, 1997, Jill and Scott Forrest set out by boat with two other couples from their home on Lake Murray for a restaurant and bar on the lakeâ€™s opposite shore.Â  On board were at least two cases of beer.Â  The entire party consumed alcohol throughout the trip and subsequent dinner with the exception of Scott Forrest, who stopped drinking at the restaurant in anticipation of operating the boat on the trip home.Â  The party did not decide to head for home until the early morning hours of July 19.Â  Before leaving the bar and restaurant, the group became aware that the stern light, required for nighttime navigation, was inoperable, but decided to make the return trip anyway.Â  Despite the fact that Scott was the most sober of the group, Jill Forrest captained the boat on the way home.\r\nThat same evening, Randall Smith and his eleven-year-old son, Drew, were night fishing on the lake on a small fishing boat.Â  Shortly after leaving the restaurant, the Forrestsâ€™ boat collided with Mr. Smithâ€™s boat, killing his young son and sinking the smaller vessel.Â  Several of the Forrestsâ€™ passengers were thrown from their boat.Â  Following the collision, Mr. Forrest took control of their boat and began to pick up his passengers.Â  Deception on the part of the Forrests and their passengers regarding the circumstances of the accident began almost immediately. \r\nAs Mr. Smith floated in the lake, cradling the lifeless body of his son, Mrs. Forrest told her husband that he should tell the authorities he was operating the boat so that assets in her name would not be subject to liability.Â  The Forrests persuaded the other passengers to go along with this version of the events, and several members of the group promptly began sinking beer cans in the lake to conceal evidence of their earlier drinking.Â  Due to their deception, it was Mr. Forrest, and not Mrs. Forrest, who was administered a field sobriety test upon the authoritiesâ€™ arrival. Most significant to the present appeal, Mr. Forrest claimed during the investigation that Mr. Smith was operating his boat at night without proper lighting, effectively accusing him of unlawful conduct.Â  So clear was the inference of Mr. Smithâ€™s fault, he was given Miranda warnings prior to questioning by the investigating officers. The Forrests also told investigators that their boat had a functioning stern light at the time of the collision, which was another intentional falsehood.\r\nThe Forrestsâ€™ ruse was maintained for a few weeks, as much of the investigation focused on Mr. Smith and whether he maintained proper lighting on his fishing boat.Â  Due to some inconsistencies in the passengersâ€™ stories, however, the focus of the investigation began to shift to the Forrests.Â  Weeks after the collision, two of the Forrestsâ€™ passengers confessed to law enforcement regarding the operator of the watercraft at the time of the accident, the status of its stern light, and the concealment of evidence.[1] Â \r\nMr. Smith brought an action against the Forrests, asserting claims based on their negligence in operating the boat as well as their deceitful actions following the accident.Â  Karen Smith, Drewâ€™s mother, brought a wrongful death action based on her capacity as personal representative of Drewâ€™s estate.Â  Based on a homeownerâ€™s insurance policy in effect at the time of the accident, State Capital agreed to defend the Forrests under a reservation of rights in these cases.Â  However, State Capital promptly filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to deny coverage to the Forrests based on two issues relating to ownership of the boat and the residence of Jill Forrestâ€™s mother, record owner of the boat they were using on the night of the accident.Â  Due to their interest in the outcome of the declaratory judgment action, the Smiths were also named as party defendants.\r\nOn February 19, 2003, a non-jury trial was held on State Capitalâ€™s action.Â  The primary focus of the trial was the factual determinations relating to the ownership of the boat and the residence of Mrs. Forrestâ€™s mother.Â  Near the close of trial, however, the attorney for the Smiths, heretofore silent as to the initial two issues, addressed the court.Â  At this time, he raised the issue of the accident and the Forrestsâ€™ behavior that followed as possibly giving rise to two separate â€œoccurrencesâ€ under the terms of the insurance policy.Â  The insurance policy in question limits recovery to $300,000 per â€œoccurrence.â€Â  It was the Smithsâ€™ position that, under the present facts, State Capital faced potential liability of $600,000.\r\nThe circuit court requested and received memoranda from State Capital and Mr. Smith on this issue. On May 29, 2003, the circuit issued its final order.Â  The court rejected State Capitalâ€™s position on the issues relating to ownership of the boat and the residency of Mrs. Forrestâ€™s mother.Â  The order further held that the policy provided insurance for both the first â€œoccurrenceâ€ of the boating accident and the second â€œoccurrenceâ€ of the alleged defamation, for which State capital was also required to defend and indemnify up to a separate policy limit.Â  State Capital promptly moved for reconsideration of the portion of the order finding that there was a second occurrence under the policy.Â  Mr. Smith also moved to conform his pleadings to the evidence in order to better articulate his defamation claim and how it relates to the Forrestsâ€™ specific insurance policy.\r\nBefore the post-trial motions were argued, both Mrs. Smithâ€™s wrongful death action and Mr. Smithâ€™s property damage and emotional distress claims were settled.Â  Only Mr. Smithâ€™s defamation claim, arising from the conspiracy which placed suspicion for causing the accident on him, remained.Â  Following a hearing on the post-trial motions presently on appeal, the conspiracy trial went forward.Â  Before its conclusion, a settlement was reached, valuing Mr. Smithâ€™s defamation claim at $250,000 to be deposited with the Lexington County Clerk of Court and paid out pursuant to further direction by the court following resolution of the post-trial motions and the present appeal.\r\nThe circuit court denied State Capitalâ€™s motion for reconsideration, upholding the portion of its order finding two â€œoccurrencesâ€ under the policy.Â  The court likewise denied Mr. Smithâ€™s motion to amend his pleadings, concluding that the motion was rendered moot by the caseâ€™s favorable conclusion.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA declaratory judgment action to determine coverage under an insurance contract is an action at law.Â  Travelers Indem. Co. v. Auto World of Orangeburg, Inc., 334 S.C. 137, 140, 511 S.E.2d 692, 694 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, the appellate court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact unless there is no reasonable evidence supporting them.Â  Townes Assocs. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  The scope of our review of this case is therefore limited to the correction of errors of law.Â  Id.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nState Capital argues the trial court erred in finding a second occurrence under the policy and extending coverage under a separate policy limit to the defamation claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe general guidelines for interpreting insurance policies were recently outlined by this court as follows:\r\n\r\nInsurance policies are subject to general rules of contract construction.Â  This Court must enforce, not write, contracts of insurance and we must give policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.Â  All of the policy provisions should be considered, and one may not, by pointing out a single sentence or clause, create an ambiguity.Â  The meaning of a particular word or phrase is not determined by considering the word or phrase by itself, but by reading the policy as a whole and considering the context and subject matter of the insurance contract.\r\nAn insurerâ€™s obligation under a policy of insurance is defined by the terms of the policy itself, and cannot be enlarged by judicial construction.Â  Ambiguous or conflicting terms in an insurance policy must be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer.Â  However, if the intention of the parties is clear, courts have no authority to torture the meaning of policy language to extend or defeat coverage that was never intended by the parties.\r\nThe rule of strict construction does not authorize a perversion of language or the exercise of inventive powers for the purpose of creating an ambiguity where none exists.Â  When a contract is unambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used.Â  The judicial function of a court of law is to enforce an insurance contract as made by the parties, and not to rewrite or to distort, under the guise of judicial construction, contracts, the terms of which are plain and unambiguous.\r\n\r\nStewart v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 341 S.C. 143, 150-151, 533 S.E.2d 597, 601 (Ct. App. 2000) (internal citations omitted).\r\nThe homeownerâ€™s policy at issue in the present case expressly provides coverage for â€œbodily injuryâ€ and â€œproperty damageâ€ caused by an â€œoccurrence.â€ The policyâ€™s definitions clause defines â€œoccurrenceâ€ as â€œan accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, which results, during the policy period, in:Â  a. â€˜bodily injury;â€™ or b. â€˜property damage.â€™â€Â  The policy includes a â€œspecial coverage extension,â€ which expands the definition of â€œbodily injuryâ€ to include â€œpersonal injury.â€Â  â€œPersonal Injuryâ€ is defined as â€œinjury arising out of one or more of the following offenses:Â  2. libel, slander or defamation of character.â€\r\nInitially, we must settle an apparent ambiguity in the policy.Â  Although the policy defines â€œoccurrenceâ€ as â€œan accident,â€ the policyâ€™s definition of covered personal injuries specifically includes defamation, an intentional tort.Â  â€œThus, the policy purports to provide coverage for certain intentional torts under [its] definition of covered personal injuries, yet it attempts to deny coverage for injuries expected or intended under the definition of an occurrence.â€Â  South Carolina State Budget &amp; Control Bd. v. Prince, 304 S.C. 241, 248, 403 S.E.2d 643, 647 (1991).Â  When a policy is, such as this one, â€œsusceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, one of which would provide coverage, [an appellate court] must hold as a matter of law in favor of coverage.â€Â  Gaskins v. Blue Cross-Blue Shield of South Carolina, 271 S.C. 101, 108, 245 S.E.2d 598, 602 (1978).Â  Thus, when faced with a similar policy and the issue of whether damages caused by defamation were covered, our supreme court found that the defamation was an â€œoccurrenceâ€ under the policy, stating â€œ[i]t would be unreasonable to interpret this policy to exclude coverage for defamation when the policy specifically includes defamation as a covered personal injury.â€Â  Prince, 304 S.C. at 248, 403 S.E.2d at 647. \r\nWe similarly conclude that the defamation of Mr. Smith constitutes a second â€œoccurrenceâ€ under the policy.Â  â€œThe majority of courts have adopted the general view that to determine whether there is a single or multiple occurrence or accident within the meaning of the policy limits clause of a liability policy one must look to the cause or causes of the accident or occurrence.â€Â  Michael P. Sullivan, Annotation, What Constitutes Single Accident or Occurrence Within Liability Policy Limiting Insurerâ€™s Liability To A Specified Amount Per Accident Or Occurrence, 64 A.L.R. 4th 668 (2005).Â  Applying this analysis to a â€œper personâ€ liability cap, this court held that injuries to a second person are not recoverable under a separate policy limit when they are â€œconsequential damages,â€ flowing from the same cause as the injuries to the initially injured party.Â  See Stewart, 341 S.C. at 159,Â  533 S.E.2d at 605.Â  Mr. Smithâ€™s defamation claim, however, is in no way â€œconsequentialâ€ to the boating accident.Â  \r\nThe actions of the insureds giving rise to the defamation claim did not occur during the accident.Â  They began during the investigation following the collision and continued for several subsequent weeks.Â  Although the conspiracy placing blame for the accident on Mr. Smith certainly relates to the boating accident, the cause of the defamatory injuries is solely the intentional deceptive behavior of the Forrests and their guests in the weeks following the accident.Â  This is a wholly different cause than that of the accident itself, which was caused by the negligent behavior of Mrs. Forrest before and during the collision.Â  Because the behavior giving rise to Mr. Smithâ€™s defamatory injuries began considerably after the accident and continued for weeks following the death of his son, it would be unreasonable to construe the Forrestsâ€™ deplorable behavior as a mere natural â€œconsequenceâ€ of the collision.\r\nIn support of their contention, State Capitalâ€™s brief focuses on case law interpreting the phrase â€œarising out ofâ€ and its proper construction in an insurance contract to conclude there was only one â€œoccurrence.â€Â  These cases, however, deal solely with insurance policy clauses outlining what kind of damages are and are not covered by the policies, i.e. clauses of inclusion (stating what kind of damages are covered by the policy) and clauses of exclusion (outlining which damages are not covered).Â  See, e.g., Howard v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 316 S.C. 445, 450, 450 S.E.2d 582, 585 (1994) (holding an appellate court must construe the phrase â€œarising out ofâ€ broadly in a clause of inclusion); McPherson v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co., 310 S.C. 316, 319-320, 426 S.E.2d 770, 771 (1993) (holding an appellate court must construe the phrase â€œarising out ofâ€ narrowly in a clause of exclusion).Â  State Capital would have us ask, â€œdid the defamation â€˜arise out ofâ€™ the boat collision?â€Â  Applying a broad interpretation of the phrase â€œarising out of,â€ the answer is clearly â€œyes.â€Â  Thus, argues State Capital, there is only one â€œoccurrence.â€Â  However, at issue in the present case is not what kind of damages are included or excluded under the policyâ€™s coverage.Â  It is undisputed that damages â€œarising out ofâ€ defamation are covered;[2] thus, the phrase, which appears only in the context of defining what constitutes a â€œpersonal injury,â€ has little relevance to the matter presently before us.Â  State Capital asks us to apply the broad interpretation of the phrase â€œarising out ofâ€ to the definition of â€œoccurrence,â€ even though the phrase â€œarising out ofâ€ appears nowhere in that definition.Â  As stated above, the proper test to determine if there was more than one â€œoccurrenceâ€ is not whether some damages â€œarise out ofâ€ others, but whether the damages can be attributed to the same cause.Â  Because we find, under the unique factual circumstances of the present case, the defamatory injuries suffered by Mr. Smith had a separate cause than those resulting from the accident itself, we conclude there were two separate â€œoccurrencesâ€ under the policy.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s decision is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] On August 11, 1999, Mrs. Forrest pled guilty to 1) reckless homicide by operation of a boat, 2) obstruction of justice, 3) criminal conspiracy, 4) violation of duties of a vessel operator involved in a collision, and 5) violation of U.S. Coast Guard Navigational Rules.Â  Mr. Forrest pled guilty toÂ  1) obstruction of justice and 2) criminal conspiracy. \r\n[2] As previously stated, State Capital has acknowledged the damages resulting from the defamation in this case and the fact that they are covered under the policy, disputing only the issue of whether the damages constitute a second â€œoccurrence.â€\r\n[3]Â  Because this issue is decided in Mr. Smithâ€™s favor, we also affirm the circuit courtâ€™s denial of Mr. Smithâ€™s request to amend his pleadings in order to better argue the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-553","title":"Sargent v.

Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation action, Carolyn Sargent appeals the trial courtâ€™s order affirming the order of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Commission) denying benefits to Carolyn for the death of her husband, Willie Sargent.Â  We affirm.1\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis case involves the unfortunate and untimely death of a conscientious, long-time employee of International Paper.Â  Carolyn Sargent filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim against International Paper asserting her husband sustained an injury by accident to his lungs resulting in his death.Â  At the hearing before the Single Commissioner, Carolyn took the position that Willieâ€™s death resulted from his accidental exposure to chlorine dioxide (ClO2).Â  Specifically, Carolyn maintained Willie was working as a mechanic when he went to repair a pump that contained ClO2 and, as he was working on the machine, he â€œcaught a pretty good dose of it.â€Â  Her position was that Willie died from pneumonia that was induced, at least in part, by exposure to the chemical.Â  \r\nThe record shows Willie Sargent was employed at International Paper as a Service Operator I.Â  His duties were testing and trouble shooting, which involved checking on jobs to see if there were any problems.Â  Luther Davis testified that he worked with Willie and held the same job at International Paper.Â  According to Davis, he worked with Willie on the Friday before Willie was admitted to the hospital, which would have been August 18, 2000.Â  The first time he saw Willie that day was around 6:30 a.m. in the lab, and Willie was â€œdoing pretty goodâ€ at that time.Â  The two men parted company, and Davis thereafter saw Willie in the lab again.Â  Davis described Willieâ€™s physical condition at that time as â€œpretty good.â€Â  Willie was called to check on a pump at the â€œKMYR digester,â€ and Davis was called to assist him.Â  After the two opened a valve, Willie was again called away, this time to go to a job on the â€œpine decker.â€Â  Thereafter when Davis saw Willie, Willie was â€œcoughing pretty forcefully.â€Â  Davis had worked on the C line that day where there was â€œ a little, small ClO2 leak.â€Â  When he last saw Willie before he observed him coughing, Willie was â€œheaded in the direction of the C lineâ€ of the plant.Â  However, the place that Willie was ultimately going to was not the C line, but was the pine decker.Â  Davis testified that if there were any problems on the jobs they checked, they normally would not fix anything, but would just report the problem.Â  Davis specifically testified Willie would not have been performing any repairs on a leak on the C line when he was called away.Â  Although he was not sure, Davis thought he told Willie about the leak he had discovered on the C line that morning.Â  However, he stated that people would still walk through the area knowing of a leak because the C line is outside, in the open air.Â  \r\nThomas Carucci, International Paperâ€™s safety manager, testified regarding the plantâ€™s protocol following an employeeâ€™s exposure to ClO2.Â  Carucci stated that after an employee reports an exposure, a green slip is used to document the occurrence and an investigation is immediately triggered.Â  If an exposure were reported, maintenance would be notified there was a leak, an analysis would be performed, and â€œimmediately things would be shut down and it would be taped off or roped off so no one could go into the area.â€Â  Carucci stated International Paper had no record of Willie reporting any problems due to exposure prior to his hospitalization and death.Â  Carucci further testified, if Willie had reported an exposure when he went to first aid on August 22, a green slip would have been filled out immediately and the area would have been tested and roped off.Â  Because it was not reported, no green form was filled out for Willie.Â  Carruci also testified that the C line was in a big, open area and was completely outside.Â  \r\nJacob Smith, the manufacturing manager at International Paper, testified regarding Willieâ€™s position and his employment with the company.Â  Willie worked for a foreman who worked for Smith.Â  Willieâ€™s responsibility was to walk a route throughout the manufacturing process to observe any kind of malfunction with the equipment in that area.Â  Willie would report any mechanical problems.Â  Smith testified Willie never performed any major repairs and if there were a mechanical malfunction that required repair work, maintenance would perform the work, as it was not a part of Willieâ€™s job.Â  Smith had known Willie for twenty-nine years and stated Willie smoked â€œquite a bitâ€ and had complained about breathing problems.Â  Willie was a â€œvery conscientiousâ€ employee who was well trained and aware of the proper procedure to follow in the case of exposure to ClO2.Â  Prior to his death, Willie did not report he had been acutely exposed to ClO2.Â  Neither was there any record Willie reported any sort of mechanical problems between August 17 and Willieâ€™s death on August 30.Â  According to Smith, if Willie had â€œgotten a whiff of any significant amountâ€ of ClO2,â€ he would have reported it.Â  \r\nWillie did not work on Saturday, August 19 or Sunday, August 20, but did work a 3:00 to 11:00 shift on Monday, August 21.Â  On August 22, 2000, Willie went to see one of the companyâ€™s occupational health nurses, Mary Ann Sutton.Â  At that time, Willie complained of not feeling well for two days and experiencing shortness of breath upon exertion.Â  He further complained of nausea and having a productive cough.Â  He had a temperature of 100 degrees.Â  Sutton found Willieâ€™s chest sounded clear, she heard no wheezes, and there was no complaint of chest pain.Â  Sutton noted it appeared Willie had a flu-like illness.Â  She encouraged Willie to go home, but he indicated he had one and a half hours left on his shift that he wanted to finish.Â  Willie agreed he would call his doctor the next morning or visit the emergency room if his symptoms continued to increase.Â  \r\nSutton testified the company had policies and procedures in place whenever someone reported any inhalation of gas.Â  She stated an incident report and respiratory forms would be filled out, and management and the safety department would be notified.Â  Had Willie reported an exposure to ClO2 at that time, she would have filled out another document as well as her regular nurseâ€™s notes.Â  This document is an occupational health nurse note that is on a green form.Â  Sutton testified that with an acute exposure to ClO2, the person would be aware of the exposure right away because it has a bad smell and is irritating.Â  The person would complain of a lot of burning in the throat.Â  She stated ClO2 is a strong respiratory irritant and that if a person could not get away from the area and inhaled a large amount, it would result in wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, vomiting, and several hours later the person may develop pulmonary edema.Â  It is clear from Suttonâ€™s notes and her testimony that Willie did not report any ClO2 exposure to her when he saw her on August 22.Â  \r\nCarolyn Sargent testified before the Commission that she first became aware her husband was having problems with his health on Sunday, when â€œ[h]e was coughing and he was aching all over.â€Â  He had been off that day and the day before, but worked the day prior to that, and when he came home from work that day, he was not having any difficulty.Â  Willie went to see his doctor on Wednesday morning.Â  While there, the doctor called an ambulance to transport Willie to the hospital.Â  Willie died the following Wednesday morning.Â  Carolyn acknowledged she stated in her deposition that the first time Willie complained to her was on Tuesday night, August 22, but clarified that was the first time Willie complained about â€œinhaling the ClO2 gas.â€Â  Carolyn agreed Willie had a history of smoking, at least for the twenty-six years she was married to him.Â  \r\nThe record further shows Willie was admitted to Georgetown Memorial Hospital on August 23, 2000.Â  Nursing notes reflect Willie stated â€œClO2 â€“ bleaching agent â€“ was released into air last [Thursday]â€ and Willie â€œwent [through] area 3 times in 10 [minutes].â€Â  One of the consulting physicians, Dr. Phillips, documented the following:Â  â€œThe patient states approximately a week or so ago he was exposed to a chemical spill at the plant.Â  He describes this being a chloride-based bleach spill.â€Â  Another consulting physician, Dr. Felzien, also noted, â€œThe patient was initially involved in a chemical spill felt to be some type of chloride-based chemical approximately one week prior to admission.â€Â  On evaluation, it was determined Willie had pneumonia and he was treated with multiple antibiotics.Â  While his condition initially improved, Willie died unexpectedly on August 30, 2000.Â  At the time of his death, Willie was forty-nine years old.Â  \r\nAn autopsy was performed on August 31, the day after Willieâ€™s death.Â  The autopsy, performed by Dr. Proctor, included in the case summary that microscopic evaluation of the lungs â€œrevealed a prominent interstitial fibrosis with superimposed bronchopneumonia and aspergillus.â€Â  The case summary further provided as follows:Â  â€œThese findings are consistent with a longstanding interstitial fibrosis with superimposed broncopneumonia and subsequent abscess formation.Â  The possibility that this superimposed pneumonia was chemical related cannot be excluded.â€Â  In the death summary dictated in October 2000, Willieâ€™s attending physician, Dr. Archambeau, stated cultures taken from Willie following his death â€œgrew out Aspergillusâ€ and he found Willieâ€™s cause of death was â€œ[l]ikely overwhelming sepsis from Aspergillus pneumonia.â€Â  He noted, however, the final cause of death would be determined by the autopsy.Â  \r\nCarolyn presented the medical report of Dr. Harley to support her position that the ClO2 exposure induced the pneumonia that led to Willieâ€™s death.Â  Dr. Harley prepared an autopsy report in November 2000 finding the cause of Willieâ€™s death to be â€œ[s]epsis complicating pneumonia, lung abscess, and empyema, superimposed on severe chronic interstitial fibrosis of lungs.â€Â  He noted in his report, â€œIn putting this altogether, it would appear that Mr. Sargent had a chronic interstitial fibrosis. . . . This had probably been present for years.Â  Superimposed on this, he developed an acute bronchopneumonia which may have been related to chemical exposure.â€Â  Thereafter, on January 3, 2003, Dr. Harley submitted a medical report and opinion.Â  Dr. Harley noted that Willie had more longstanding lung disease than was appreciated before his death, and while the ClO2 exposure did not cause the fibrosis, it did â€œaggravate the already existing conditions.â€Â  He found the acute, probably bacterial pneumonia seen at autopsy, was most likely a superinfection secondary to an acute lung injury, and that lung injury was most probably from the ClO2 exposure.Â  He thus concluded, â€œit is my opinion that the record supports the conclusion that the ClO2 exposure was a cause for initiating the acute infectious process in this case, resulting in Mr. Sargentâ€™s death.â€Â  \r\nInternational Paper countered with the opinions of Doctors Sahn, Proctor, Archambeau, and Russell, who all determined Willieâ€™s death was most likely unrelated to his exposure to the chemical.Â  Dr. Sahn noted Willieâ€™s history that he walked through an area three times in a ten minute period where ClO2 had been released into the air.Â  He observed that after Willie was admitted to the hospital, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and empyema, and eventually died with sepsis.Â  Dr. Sahn concluded, â€œ[A]fter review of the records and literature concerning chlorine inhalation, it is my opinion that the minimal and brief exposure to chlorine was unrelated to the development of a bacterial pneumonia and empyema several days later.â€Â  \r\nDr. Proctor indicated his autopsy evaluation revealed Willie had a severe underlying pulmonary fibrosis and he was at risk of developing pneumonia regardless of any chlorine exposure.Â  He noted the degree of fibrosis in Willieâ€™s lungs developed over a long period of time and led to â€œa serious compromise of his lung capacity and ability to clear his lungs.â€Â  Dr. Proctor concluded Willie had longstanding pulmonary fibrosis, he was at risk of developing infection without chemical exposure, and the â€œpneumonia most likely occurred as the result of his compromised pulmonary status rather than as a chemical induced pneumonia.â€Â  \r\nDr. Archambeau, Willieâ€™s attending physician, stated he was â€œin agreement with Dr. Sahnâ€™s report that [Willieâ€™s] problems leading to his death were probably not related to his alleged exposure to chlorine.â€Â  He opined that Willieâ€™s â€œprevious history of bullous emphysema and his diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia on admission led to the cause of his death.â€Â Â  \r\nFinally, in November 2002, Dr. Roger Russell performed an extensive evaluation to determine whether the acute illness that led to Willieâ€™s death was an occupational disease or whether Willieâ€™s alleged chemical exposure exacerbated a preexisting condition, contributing to his demise.Â  In preparing his evaluation, Dr. Russell reviewed, among other things, Willieâ€™s hospital medical records, Dr. Proctorâ€™s autopsy report, Dr. Harleyâ€™s report, Willieâ€™s health records from International Paper, Willieâ€™s Pulmonary Function Test Results from 1989 to 1997, Dr. Sahnâ€™s report, and the various depositions of Carolyn Sargent and International Paper employees.Â  Dr. Russell noted the history given by Willie in the emergency room that he became short of breath approximately a week before, after passing through an area at work three times where there were ClO2 fumes.Â  Dr. Russell found the symptoms Willie complained of to the plant nurse clearly indicated â€œhe had a pneumonia caused by microorganisms as opposed to a chemical pneumontis.â€Â  He also observed the autopsy findings showed conclusively that Willie had extensive, chronic pulmonary fibrosis that predated the alleged chemical exposure and the fungal pneumonia of which Willie died.Â  Dr. Russell concluded as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. Willie Sargent had a severely compromised respiratory system, both from pulmonary fibrosis and from cigarette smoking.Â  He developed a mixed bacterial and fungal pneumonia, lung abscess, and empyema which responded in part to the removal of 600 cc of purulent fluid from the pleural space of his left lung and antibiotic therapy (antibiotics kill bacteria but not fungi).Â  He ultimately died from respiratory failure.Â  Fungi were first noted at autopsy and only identified weeks after his demise.Â  The pneumonia of which he died was caused by the introduction of microorganisms into his respiratory tract that his chronically diseased lungs were unable to clear.Â  Further, Mr. Sargent had a very shortened life expectancy due to the pulmonary fibrosis that was relentlessly converting his lungs into scar tissue.Â  He outlived the life expectancy of the average patient with pulmonary fibrosis.\r\nIn summary, it is my opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that brief exposures to ClO2 fumes on or about August 17, 2000 would not have caused, aggravated, or accelerated the development of Mr. Sargentâ€™s pneumonia, lung abscess, and empyema since his natural lung defense mechanisms against microorganisms were completely destroyed long ago by cigarette smoke and pulmonary fibrosis.\r\n\r\nDr. Russellâ€™s opinion was unchanged after reading Dr. Harleyâ€™s January 3, 2003 report.Â  \r\nThe Single Commissioner made, inter alia, the following findings of fact:Â  (1) Willie was not exposed to any significant concentration of ClO2 as asserted by Carolyn, (2) at no time did Willie report any work related injury or accident to his employer, (3) Dr. Harleyâ€™s opinion carried little weight as it was based upon an inaccurate hypothetical set of facts, (4) the greater weight of the evidence in the record indicates Willieâ€™s death was not causally related to his employment or any alleged exposure to ClO2 and (5) Willie did not sustain an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment.Â  Accordingly, the Commissioner determined Carolyn was not entitled to benefits.Â  \r\nThe Full Commission affirmed the Single Commissioner, adopting the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings in full.Â  Following a hearing on the matter, the circuit court found the decision of the Full Commission was supported by substantial evidence in the record and affirmed that decision.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;\r\n       Was the exclusion of evidence of an excited utterance by the employee conveying a present sense impression of why he was suffering from respiratory distress a clearly unwarranted abuse of discretion?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.&nbsp;\r\n       Was the exclusion of the opinion of the pathologist who performed the final autopsy in this case a clearly unwarranted abuse of discretion and the product of an error of law?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;Was the finding below that there was no evidence of chemical exposure, reports of the exposure, or complaints about it the result of an error of law?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Is the decision below clearly contrary to the substantial, reliable and probative evidence in the record when taken as a whole?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981); Adkins v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 350 S.C. 34, 36-37, 564 S.E.2d 339, 340 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder and the final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is specifically reserved to the Full Commission.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  It is not the task of this Court to weigh the evidence as found by the Full Commission.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn an appeal from the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, this court may reverse or modify a decision if the findings or conclusions of the commission are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  Neither this court nor the circuit court can substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  Id.Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Exclusion of statement by employee\r\nCarolyn first asserts error in the exclusion of a statement made by Willie to Davis on the last day the two men worked together.Â  The record shows that during the hearing before the Single Commissioner, counsel for Carolyn asked about the occasion Davis observed Willie â€œcoughing hard.â€Â  When counsel asked what Davis had said to Willie, Davis replied, â€œI asked him, I said, man, Willie, you are looking sort of bad.Â  Youâ€™re looking bad right now.Â  He said, man --.â€Â  At this point, counsel for International Paper objected.Â  Carolyn maintained the statement made at that time by Willie to Davis was a spontaneous utterance made in direct response to an inquiry and, as such, was an exception to the hearsay rule.Â  Unable to understand from the testimony â€œwhere [Willie] had just beenâ€ prior to the statement, the Commissioner sustained the objection.Â  During his deposition, Davis testified that Willieâ€™s response to Davisâ€™ expression of concern was, â€œI got gassed.â€Â  \r\nOn appeal, Carolyn argues the exclusion of the statement by Willie that he â€œgot gassedâ€ was an abuse of discretion in that the statement qualified as an exception to the hearsay rule under both the old rules, as a spontaneous utterance and thereby qualifying for admission under the res gestae exception, and the new rules as a present sense impression or excited utterance.Â  We do not need to determine whether the Commissioner erred in excluding this statement, however, as this statement was merely cumulative to other evidence that Willie may have sustained some exposure to ClO2.\r\nFirst, Carolynâ€™s testimony before the Commissioner included that Willie had complained to her on Tuesday night about â€œinhaling the ClO2 gas.â€Â  Next, the record shows the nursing notes from Willieâ€™s admission to the hospital reflect Willie stated â€œClO2 â€“ bleaching agent â€“ was released into air last [Thursday]â€ and Willie â€œwent [through] area 3 times in 10 [minutes].â€Â  Further, consulting physician, Dr. Phillips, documented Willie informed him that â€œapproximately a week or so ago he was exposed to a chemical spill at the plant.Â  He describes this being a chloride-based bleach spill.â€Â  Finally, consulting physician, Dr. Felzien, also noted, â€œThe patient was initially involved in a chemical spill felt to be some type of chloride-based chemical approximately one week prior to admission.â€Â  \r\nWhen evidence is erroneously excluded by the trial court, the appellate court first considers, among other things, whether the error may be deemed harmless because equivalent or cumulative evidence or testimony was offered.Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 31, 609 S.E.2d 506, 512 (2005).Â  The court also considers whether the aggrieved party managed to accomplish her primary objective, such as eliciting testimony about an issue or effectively cross-examining a witness.Â  Id. at 31-32, 609 S.E.2d at 512.Â  Additionally, the court considers whether, viewing the case as a whole, the excluded evidence or testimony was so crucial and important in proving the aggrieved partyâ€™s claim or defense that its exclusion constitutes prejudicial error.Â  Id.Â  at 32-33, 609 S.E.2d at 513.Â  Considering the evidence of record that Willie complained to his wife and to medical personnel of his exposure to ClO2, the statement by Willie to Davis that he had been â€œgassedâ€ was cumulative to the other evidence submitted on exposure to the chemical.Â  Further, Carolyn accomplished her primary objective of showing that Willie had complained of ClO2 exposure.Â  Finally, viewing the evidence as a whole, we are unpersuaded that this statement was so crucial to Carolynâ€™s claim that its exclusion constitutes reversible error.Â  The statement by Willie to Davis that he had been â€œgassedâ€ added nothing to the other evidence on exposure.Â  In his deposition testimony, Davis stated Willie did not give him any further information beyond the statement that he was â€œgassed.â€Â  Davis further testified in his deposition that, â€œwe all at one time or another have gotten gassedâ€ and â€œsome is worse than others.â€Â  This statement in no way elucidates the severity of the exposure.Â  Accordingly, we hold any error in the exclusion of this statement would be harmless and Carolyn suffered no prejudice by its exclusion.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Exclusion of opinion of pathologist\r\nCarolyn next argues the exclusion of the opinion of Dr. Harley, who prepared the final autopsy in this case, was an abuse of discretion and based on an error of law.2Â  She asserts his opinion was excluded from consideration because it was allegedly based on a flawed hypothetical, and because Dr. Harleyâ€™s report was not based on a hypothetical but was based on the actual record in this case, his opinion should not have been disallowed.\r\nIn his findings of fact, the Single Commissioner found Willie was not exposed to â€œany significant concentration of ClO2â€ at the time in question.Â  The Commissioner concluded Dr. Harleyâ€™s opinion regarding causation necessarily assumed Willie was exposed to ClO2 and this assumption was not supported by the greater weight of the evidence.Â  Accordingly, the Commissioner determined Dr. Harleyâ€™s opinion regarding causation had little probative value and it was given little weight.Â  \r\nFirst, it is clear the Commissioner did not exclude Dr. Harleyâ€™s opinion from evidence.Â  Rather, the Commissioner determined Dr. Harleyâ€™s opinion should be afforded little weight as Dr. Harley relied on the assumption Willie was in fact exposed to ClO2 on the date in question.Â  \r\nWe also note, reading the Commissionerâ€™s decision as a whole, it is clear the Commissioner found Carolyn failed to prove Willie was exposed to ClO2 as alleged on the date in question, and that if he was in fact exposed, â€œany exposure was fleetingâ€ and Willie â€œwas not exposed to any significant concentration of ClO2.â€Â  There is evidence of record that Willie failed to report any exposure to his employer at the time of the alleged incident and failed to report any exposure to the plant nurse a few days later when he went to first aid to complain of illness, in spite of the fact that Willie was a conscientious employee who knew protocol dictated he report an exposure.Â  Further, International Paper submitted evidence that Willie would not have been performing any major repairs on a mechanical problem, but was responsible only for reporting any such problems, and Willie specifically would not have been performing any repairs on a leak on the C line just prior to his coughing incident.Â  More importantly, Carolyn presented no evidence Willie â€œcaught a pretty good dose ofâ€ ClO2 while repairing a pump on the C line, as she maintained before the Commission.Â  \r\nNeither this court nor the circuit court can substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  Further, the Full Commission adopted and incorporated the findings of the Single Commissioner.Â  The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is specifically reserved to the Full Commission.Â  Considering the record as a whole, we find there is substantial evidence that would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached on the issue of Willieâ€™s exposure.Â  Even if the evidence were undisputed that Willie was in fact exposed to ClO2 on the date in question, there is substantial evidence of record that any exposure was minimal or â€œfleeting,â€ as Willie did not report the exposure to his employer at the time of exposure and also failed to report the exposure to the plant nurse several days later when complaining of illness.Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Error of law in certain findings below \r\nCarolyn next asserts error in findings below that â€œthere was (a) no evidence of chemical exposure, (b) reports of that exposure or (c) complaints about it.â€Â  She argues, based on the record, these findings were an error of law.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe first note that Carolyn points to the following findings:\r\n\r\nThere is no competent evidence that [Willie] was exposed to ClO2, that he reported any exposure to ClO2, or that he complained of any work-related injury on or about August 19, 2000.Â  In fact, the substantial medical evidence in the record suggests [Willieâ€™s] death was not related to any alleged exposure to ClO2.\r\n\r\nThe findings of which Carolyn complains are findings made by the circuit court, not the Commission.Â  In an appeal from the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission, this court reviews the decision of the Commission to determine whether the claimantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Thus, the findings of the circuit court do not impact whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s decision.Â  The Commission found that the assumption Willie was exposed to ClO2 was not supported by the greater weight of the evidence, that Willie was not exposed to any significant concentration of ClO2 as asserted by Carolyn and, if he was in fact exposed, â€œany exposure was fleeting.â€Â  These findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  \r\nAt any rate, considering the record as a whole, there is substantial evidence to support the findings of which Carolyn complains.Â  The record contains evidence that, had Willie been exposed as asserted by Carolyn, he was a conscientious employee who would have reported the exposure, and such exposure would have been well documented.Â  Thus, considering the record as a whole, there is evidence from which reasonable minds could have reached this conclusion.Â  Further, there is evidence of record that Willie did not report any exposure or complain of any exposure to his employer on the date in question, and these findings are likewise supported by substantial evidence.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Decisions below contrary to substantial, reliable, probative evidence\r\nLastly, Carolyn argues, because of specific erroneous findings, the findings of the Commission are not supported by substantial evidence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nCarolyn asserts error in the Commissionâ€™s finding that Willie â€œhad not mentioned anything about any alleged exposure to ClO2 to his wife and did not complain of any unusual symptoms until Tuesday night, August 22, 2000.â€Â  Carolyn testified before the Commission that she first became aware Willie was having problems with his health on Sunday, when â€œ[h]e was coughing and he was aching all over.â€ Â However, she acknowledged she had stated in her deposition that the first time Willie complained to her was on Tuesday night, August 22, clarifying that was the first time Willie complained about â€œinhaling the ClO2 gas.â€Â  Accordingly, there is substantial evidence of record to support this finding.\r\nCarolyn next complains of the Commissionâ€™s finding that while Davis testified he saw Willie coughing on the day in question, he â€œalways coughed a little.â€Â  She asserts this finding trivializes Davisâ€™ observation that he observed Willie coughing â€œhardâ€ on the day in question.Â  The Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Full Commission.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  The record shows, when asked whether he had ever seen him cough before in all the years he had known him, Davis testified Willie â€œalways coughed a little.â€Â  Thus, this finding is supported by substantial evidence of record.Â  Further, the Commission noted in its order that Davis also denied Willie coughed frequently or had shortness of breath.Â  Accordingly, the findings of the Commissioner do not support Carolynâ€™s argument that the Commissioner trivialized the evidence concerning Davisâ€™ observation of Willie coughing on the date in question.\r\nCarolyn also asserts the Commissionâ€™s finding that Willieâ€™s job â€œinvolved reporting problems, but not fixing them,â€ is contrary to the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence of the record as a whole.Â  We disagree.Â  Carolyn is apparently referring to the Commissionâ€™s findings that â€œSmith testified [Willie] did not ever do any major repairs because [Willie] was a production worker and repairs were not part of his job function,â€ and that â€œ[a]pparently, [Willie] had no duties in connection with the in-line mixers on the C line.â€Â  Carolyn points to testimony from Smith that, when asked if Willie would perform minor repairs, he stated, â€œIf thereâ€™s something like a packing on a valve or something like that they do have a (sic) pliers where they can like pull up on a packing.â€Â  However, the evidence of record supports both of the findings by the Commission.Â  First, Smith did testify that in Willieâ€™s capacity as a Service Operator I, he never performed any major repairs, as it was not part of his job function.Â  Further, when discussing the in-line mixer on the C Line, Smith was asked if it was correct that if a problem were reported on the mixer, a mechanic would have performed all of the repair work.Â  Smith stated, â€œRight, and the repair work for a mixer leak would be to change out the mixer.Â  And not to go do something, you know, to temporarily fix it.Â  Itâ€™s just not a temporary fix.â€Â  Additionally, Davis testified that if there were any problems on the jobs they checked, they normally would not fix anything, but would just report the problem, and stated Willie would not have been performing any repairs on a leak on the C Line when he was called away.Â  Accordingly, considering the record as a whole, there is substantial evidence supporting the Commissionâ€™s findings.\r\nCarolyn next argues the Commissionâ€™s finding that no chemical exposure occurred since there was â€œno particular incident reportâ€ in the file detailing a chemical exposure was improper.Â  She contends the absence of a company-generated report is â€œentirely neutralâ€ and therefore neither supports nor refutes an inference that a chemical exposure occurred.Â  We disagree.Â  The record contains evidence that Willie failed to report any exposure to either his employer at the time of the alleged exposure or to the plant nurse days after the alleged exposure when he sought treatment for his illness.Â  Further, there is evidence of record that Willie was a conscientious employee who would have reported an exposure to a chemical.Â  The weight to be attributed to this evidence in determining whether Willie was exposed to ClO2 as claimed by Carolyn is reserved for the Commission and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.\r\nCarolyn next contends the Commission erroneously found an employee, Mr. Lance, performed regularly scheduled maintenance on the C Line mixer on August 25, 2000 and found no problems with the valves and he did not have to perform or schedule any repairs because â€œeverything worked.â€Â  She argues this finding distorts reality by suggesting there could not have been any ClO2 leaks from the C Line mixer on August 18, 2000, when there was evidence the mixer had been replaced on August 24, 2000.Â  We first note the Commissionâ€™s order in this respect appears to merely summarize the testimony of employee John Lance, and therefrom finds, â€œMr. Lanceâ€™s testimony does not support the Claimantâ€™s allegations that [Willie] was exposed to ClO2 on August 19, 2000 or at any other time.â€Â  It does not find there could not have been a ClO2 leak from the C Line on August 18, 2000.Â  At any rate, Carolyn failed to include any testimony from Mr. Lance in the record on appeal.Â  Therefore this court has no way of reviewing the matter to determine whether there was any error in the Commissionâ€™s order with respect to Mr. Lanceâ€™s testimony.Â  See Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C. 201, 215, 493 S.E.2d 826, 834 (1997)Â  (noting the appealing party has the burden of providing a sufficient record to allow consideration of an issue).\r\nFinally, Carolyn contends the Commission erroneously relied on the opinions of International Paperâ€™s medical experts in finding that Willieâ€™s death was the result of his compromised pulmonary status.Â  She argues the fact that Willieâ€™s pulmonary condition was compromised did not necessarily lead to the conclusion that his death was not compensable, and that the opinions of the companyâ€™s medical experts should have been discounted because they erroneously relied on a flawed hypothetical that assumed Willie had not inhaled any ClO2 at all.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to be entitled to compensation for an injury under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, a claimant must show he suffered an â€œinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2004). Â The term â€œarising out ofâ€ refers to the origin of the cause of the accident.Â  Harrell v. Pineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 323, 523 S.E.2d 766, 771 (1999).Â  An accidental injury is considered to arise out of oneâ€™s employment when there is a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.Â  Id. at 324, 523 S.E.2d at 771.\r\nFirst, we have already found there is substantial evidence that would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Commission reached that Carolyn failed to prove Willie was exposed to ClO2 as alleged.Â  There is also substantial evidence of record that, even if the evidence were undisputed that Willie was in fact exposed to ClO2 on the date in question, any exposure was minimal or fleeting.Â  At any rate, a review of the record fails to show these doctors â€œsimply assume[d] that [Willie] had not inhaled any ClO2 at allâ€ as asserted by Carolyn.Â  To the contrary, these doctors all agreed that it was unlikely Willieâ€™s death was related to the alleged chemical exposure, and clearly took into account Willieâ€™s possible exposure to ClO2.Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 Carolyn refers to Dr. Harleyâ€™s report as the â€œfinal autopsy.â€Â  The record shows Dr. Proctor performed an autopsy on Willie on August 31, 2000, and that Dr. Harley subsequently prepared an autopsy report after receiving certain body tissue from Dr. Proctor and apparently reviewing Dr. Proctorâ€™s report.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-554","title":"State v.

Murray (Husband) appeals the family courtâ€™s order denying his motion to vacate the partiesâ€™ final decree of divorce and for a new trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Carolyn M. Lewis-Murray (Wife) were married on October 19, 1997.Â  Prior to the marriage, Husband experienced health problems resulting from heart disease.Â  On October 22, 1997, Husband underwent heart surgery and was subsequently prescribed medication to treat this condition as well as depression.Â  Following his surgery, Husband moved into Wifeâ€™s home in order to recover.Â  After several weeks, Husband moved out of Wifeâ€™s home and into a garage apartment that was attached to a house that Husband was building.Â  The circumstances surrounding Husbandâ€™s decision to move are disputed by the parties.Â  Husband claimed that Wife had no interest in caring for him and made his life intolerable.Â  In contrast, Wife asserted Husband had been unfaithful to her during the marriage.\r\nAs an apparent result of this marital discord, the parties entered into a separation and property settlement agreement (Agreement) on October 21, 1998.Â  Husband asserted he signed it under duress because Wife threatened him regarding his alleged extra-marital affair.Â  He further contended he was also under the influence of medication when he signed the Agreement.Â  Pursuant to the Agreement, the parties equitably divided the marital debts and property.Â  Significantly, Wife was granted the house that Husband claimed he built for his retirement and to provide for his extended family.Â  As part of the Agreement, Husband was permitted to reside in the garage apartment for six months after the parties executed the Agreement.Â  According to Husband, Wife and members of her family had at this point moved into the residence.\r\nOn February 8, 1999, Wife filed a summons and complaint, seeking a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation and requesting the family court approve the Agreement and incorporate it into the final decree of divorce.Â  Although Husband contends he has no recollection of responding to Wifeâ€™s pleadings, a pro se Answer was filed on February 19, 1999.\r\nAt the hearing before the family court on March 12, 1999, Wife was present and represented by counsel.Â  Husband, who later claimed he had no notice of the hearing, was not present nor did counsel represent him.Â  By order dated March 18, 1999, the family court granted Wife a divorce and approved the Agreement.Â  A written acknowledgment of service dated March 31, 1999, and filed April 7, 1999, indicated Husband received a copy of the family courtâ€™s order. \r\nOn May 5, 2003, Husband moved to have the divorce decree vacated and to be granted a new trial.Â  Although Husband generally moved for relief from judgment, he specifically claimed:Â  (1) he did not receive notice of the divorce hearing nor did he receive notice of the issuance of the final order; (2) he was mentally and physically incapacitated prior to and at the time of the hearing; (3) he signed the Agreement under duress; and (4) the family court approved the Agreement despite the courtâ€™s failure to question him regarding whether the Agreement was fair and entered into voluntarily.Â  In support of his motion, Husband submitted an affidavit, a letter from a treating physician, and a memorandum of law.Â  Additionally, Husband explained he had delayed in filing the motion because he only recently became aware of the existence of the final divorce decree when he attempted to use a credit line that was secured by the house that he had built.\r\nAfter Wife filed a return to the motion in which she disputed Husbandâ€™s allegations, the family court held a hearing.Â  By order dated November 5, 2003, the family court denied Husbandâ€™s motion, finding it was untimely given Husband had â€œwaited more than four years after the service of the Final Decree of Divorce before he . . . raised any issue as to the validity of the Decree.â€Â  However, despite this holding, the court noted that the absence of a receipt of notice of the final hearing and Husbandâ€™s alleged competency issues may have served as a basis to challenge the decree of divorce.Â  Husband appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in denying his motion to set aside the final divorce decree.Â  In support of this argument, Husband raises two grounds.Â  First, he claims the final order was procured through fraud given he was physically and mentally incapacitated prior to and at the time of the final hearing.Â  Secondly, he asserts the order was void because he was never served with Wifeâ€™s summons and complaint or with the family courtâ€™s final decree of divorce.Â  \r\nRule 60 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure governs this case.Â  Subsection (b), the pertinent provision, provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (b)&nbsp;\r\n         Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc.Â  On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (1)&nbsp;\r\n         mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (2)&nbsp;\r\n         newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (3)&nbsp;\r\n         fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         the judgment is void;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (5)\r\n         the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\nThe motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.Â  A motion under this subdivision (b) does not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation.Â  This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment, order, or proceeding, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.\r\n\r\nRule 60(b), SCRCP.\r\nâ€œA party seeking to set aside a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) has the burden of presenting evidence entitling him to the requested relief.â€ Lanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 215, 612 S.E.2d 456, 458 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Whether to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Raby Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 17, 594 S.E.2d 478, 482 (2004).Â  Therefore, our review is confined to determining whether the family court abused its discretion in granting or denying the motion.Â  Lanier, 364 S.C. at 216, 612 S.E.2d at 458.\r\nAs a threshold matter, we note neither Husband nor the court identified which subsections of Rule 60 formed the basis of the motion and the subsequent ruling.Â  Given this procedural posture, it is difficult to discern the exact grounds for the courtâ€™s decision.Â  However, even assuming Husbandâ€™s claims of intrinsic fraud and the invalidity of the order were meritorious,[1] we agree with the family court that any motion to set aside the final order was untimely under either the one-year Rule 60(b)(3) subsection or the (4) and (5) â€œreasonable timeâ€ subsections.Â  \r\nClearly, Husbandâ€™s claim filed approximately four and a half years after the final order could only be conceivably argued under the â€œreasonable timeâ€ subsections (4) and (5).Â  Based on the specific facts of this case, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in finding the motion was untimely, i.e., the delay could not be construed as â€œreasonable.â€ See Smith Cos. of Greenville v. Hayes, 311 S.C. 358, 359, 428 S.E.2d 900, 902 (Ct. App. 1993) (â€œUnder Rule 60(b)(4) and (5), the court may grant a party relief from judgment if the party makes a motion seeking relief within a reasonable time.â€).\r\nAlthough Husband contends he did not receive notice of the final divorce decree, there is evidence in the record in the form of an acknowledgment of service that Husband received a copy of the final decree of divorce on March 31, 1999.Â  As to allegations that Husband was physically and mentally incapacitated for a period of time due to his health problems, we find no evidence in the record that these problems would have prevented him from filing a timely motion to be relieved from judgment.Â  Significantly, Husband retained his position as Chief Magistrate for Berkeley County despite his health problems.Â  Moreover, we cannot glean from the record that Husbandâ€™s health problems extended far beyond the time period prior to and at the time of the divorce hearing.[2]Â  In fact, Husbandâ€™s motion to set aside the judgment, which included his affidavit, does not address any time period after the decree was issued. See Perry v. Heirs at Law of Gadsden, 357 S.C. 42, 48, 590 S.E.2d 502, 505 (Ct. App. 2003)(citations omitted) (â€œ[A]lthough motions under Rule 60(b)(5) are not subject to the requirement that they be filed within one year of the judgment, they still must be filed within a reasonable time.Â  While we are reluctant to proclaim that four years is a per se unreasonable period of time, [defendant], who bore the burden of showing the propriety of his motion, has failed to proffer an argument as to why we should find the four-year delay is reasonable in this case.â€); McDaniel v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 324 S.C. 639, 644, 478 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding trial court properly denied partyâ€™s motion to set aside judgment as void pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP where motion was not filed within a reasonable time given motion was filed after nearly four years and party participated in the settlement and received substantial benefits from it).\r\nFinally, to the extent Husband argues the Agreement was procured and approved through extrinsic fraud, and thus infinitely extended his time to file a Rule 60(b) motion, we find this issue not properly before this court. See Raby Constr., L.L.P., 358 S.C. at 19, 594 S.E.2d at 483 (â€œExtrinsic fraud is â€˜fraud that induces a person not to present a case or deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.â€™â€ (quoting Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 81, 579 S.E.2d 605, 610 (2003)); Chewning, 354 S.C. at 80, 579 S.E.2d at 609-10 (â€œThere is no statute of limitations when a party seeks to set aside a judgment due to fraud upon the court.â€).Â  \r\nFirst, the family court did not make a determination whether extrinsic fraud was involved, but instead denied Husbandâ€™s motion on the sole ground that it was untimely.Â  Secondly, Husband failed to file a motion to reconsider in order to obtain a specific ruling on the allegation of extrinsic fraud. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 43, 492 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1997) (stating where a trial court did not rule on issue at trial and party did not make a motion pursuant to Rule 59 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, issue was not preserved for appellate review); see also Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (stating that when a trial court makes a general ruling on an issue, but a party does not make a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to obtain a ruling on the argument, the appellate court cannot consider the argument on appeal). \r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit courtâ€™s denial of Husbandâ€™s motion for relief from judgment is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  â€œIntrinsic fraud refers to fraud presented and considered in the judgment assailed, including perjury and forged documents presented at trial.â€Â  Evans v. Gunter, 294 S.C. 525, 529, 366 S.E.2d 44, 46 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œA void judgment is one that, from its inception, is a complete nullity and is without legal effect.Â  The definition of void under the rule only encompasses judgments from courts which failed to provide proper due process, or judgments from courts which lacked subject matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction.â€ Universal Benefits, Inc. v. McKinney, 349 S.C. 179, 183, 561 S.E.2d 659, 661 (Ct. App. 2002)(citations omitted).\r\n[2]Â  Husband does assert in his brief that his medical condition â€œcaused him to be unable to reason effectively or to defend himself throughout the period his domestic action was pending and for an extended period thereafter.â€Â  However, this assertion is not supported by any documentation and is vague at best. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-556","title":"Russell Corporation v.

Johnson, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nHarry A. Swagart, III, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Russell Corporation appeals a trial courtâ€™s decision granting summary judgment to William M. Gregg, II, and finding Gregg was released from his liability for South Carolina Teesâ€™ debts by rescinding his personal guaranty.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn July 1985, William Gregg signed a continuing guaranty on behalf of South Carolina Tees, Incorporated, in order for his company to secure merchandise from Russell Corporation.Â  The guaranty was subject to interpretation under the laws of the State of Alabama, and was â€œa continuing guaranty and shall continue in full force and effect . . . until the full performance, payment, and discharge of all said Customer Obligations, and thereafter until actual receipt by [Russell] from [Gregg] of written notice of cancellation.â€Â  (Emphasis added).\r\nIn May 1998, Michael Thaxton, Russellâ€™s Manager of Credit and Accounts Receivable, wrote to Gregg to inform him that the continuing guaranty was not affected by South Carolina Teesâ€™ change of address.Â  On May 8, 1998, Gregg responded in a letter, which states:Â  â€œIn response to your letter dated May 2, 1998, the guaranty you quote was revoked at least five years ago.â€Â  Thaxton responded by inclosing a copy of the guaranty with a letter stating:Â  â€œYou will note that revocation of this guarantee can only be accomplished through written notice to our offices.Â  We have no such written notice therefore the guarantee is enforceable.â€Â  \r\nOn December 27, 2002, Russell filed a complaint against Gregg seeking to enforce the continuing guaranty and collect amounts owed on behalf of South Carolina Tees.Â  Gregg denied the guaranty was still in effect.Â  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.Â  Gregg maintained Russell â€œdispensed with the requirement of a personal guaranty after 1992â€ or â€œthat [Gregg] cancelled his guaranty in accordance with the terms thereof.â€Â  \r\nEach party provided affidavit and deposition testimony in support of the motions for summary judgment.Â  Gregg presented his affidavit as well as that of David Young to support the claim that he was released by Russell in 1992.Â  In Greggâ€™s affidavit, he states that in 1992 he contacted Young regarding the guaranty and was subsequently released from any further guaranties.Â  Gregg also stated that Young called Sally Lambeth (now Hornsby) and she verified that the guaranty was in Russellâ€™s cancelled guaranty file.Â  Youngâ€™s affidavit also indicates that in 1992 the guaranty was orally cancelled at the request of Gregg.Â  \r\nRussell put forth the affidavits of Sally Lambeth Hornsby and Michael Thaxton, who replaced Young at Russell when Young went to work for Gregg, as well as Thaxtonâ€™s deposition.Â  In his deposition, Thaxton indicated he never found any written notice of the revocation of the guaranty in Russellâ€™s files.Â  He also stated Russellâ€™s position was that the guaranty was still in effect.Â  \r\nIn his affidavit, Thaxton described Russellâ€™s policy when a guaranty is cancelled.Â  He stated the guaranty would have been returned to Gregg and that there is no canceled guaranty file as indicated in Greggâ€™s affidavit.Â  Additionally, he stated that Russell would have completed additional evaluation of the credit position of South Carolina Tees when Gregg was released.Â  He indicated there was no evidence in Russellâ€™s files of the evaluation.Â  Finally, he stated that the policies of Russell are the same ones that were in effect when Young was employed by Russell and have not changed.Â  \r\nSally Hornsby indicated in her affidavit that from 1993 through 2000, Greggâ€™s guaranty remained in full effect.Â  She stated that she never informed Young or anyone else that the guaranty was revoked or canceled.Â  Finally, she stated the policy of Russell was to return the original guaranty to the guarantor and place a copy in the credit file indicating it had been revoked.Â  \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Gregg, finding the affidavits and testimony by Thaxton and Hornsby were insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the guaranty was revoked.Â  The court held that testimony regarding Russellâ€™s procedures and the fact the procedures were not followed was insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact.Â  The court further concluded that even if the guaranty was not revoked in 1992, the letter by Gregg indicating his belief the guaranty was revoked was sufficient notice to Russell to cancel the guaranty.Â  As all obligations sought to be collected by Russell occurred after 1998, the court concluded Gregg was not liable on his guaranty and was entitled to summary judgment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court:Â  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-15, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRussell maintains the court erred in granting summary judgment to Gregg because there was a genuine issue of material fact with regards to whether the guaranty was canceled in 1992.Â  Additionally, Russell contends the court erred in finding Greggâ€™s 1998 letter sufficient to constitute written notice of the revocation of the guaranty under Alabama law.Â  We agree.\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  1992 Revocation\r\nRussell asserts Thaxtonâ€™s deposition as well as the affidavits by Thaxton and Hornsby create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Gregg properly revoked his guaranty in 1992.Â Â  We agree and find summary judgment was inappropriate.Â  \r\nIf triable issues exist, those issues must be submitted to the jury.Â  Young v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 718, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Even where no dispute as to evidentiary facts exists, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary judgment should not be granted.Â  Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 173-74, 561 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Moreover, summary judgment is a drastic remedy that should be cautiously invoked to ensure no person is improperly deprived of a trial of disputed factual issues.Â  Lanham v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of S.C., 349 S.C. 356, 363, 563 S.E.2d 331, 334 (2002).\r\nIn the current case, the guaranty specifically provided it â€œshall continue in full force and effect . . . until the full performance, payment, and discharge of all said Customer Obligations, and thereafter until actual receipt by [Russell] from [Gregg] of written notice of cancellation.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  Neither Youngâ€™s nor Greggâ€™s affidavit indicated Gregg supplied written notice of his intention to cancel the guaranty.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Thaxtonâ€™s affidavit creates a genuine issue of material fact because he indicates Russellâ€™s files did not show a cancellation.Â  Thaxton indicated Young established the procedures to be followed when a guaranty is cancelled.Â  He testified that none of the procedures, including sending the guaranty back to the guarantor or performing a follow-up credit review, were noted in Russellâ€™s file.Â  Finally, Hornsby indicated the guaranty was still in effect as it was the entire time she was in her position, which was from 1993 until 2000.Â  She also testified regarding the proper procedures when a guaranty is revoked and noted that none of these were followed for Gregg. \r\nAccordingly, we believe Russell submitted sufficient evidence to indicate the cancellation provision of the guaranty was not complied with in 1992.Â  In addition, there was evidence from which a jury could determine the guaranty was not revoked but was still in effect.Â  Therefore, the court erred in granting summary judgment to Gregg based on his alleged revocation in 1992.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  1998 Revocation\r\nRussell contends the trial court erred in finding Greggâ€™s 1998 letter constituted sufficient notice to cancel the guaranty.Â  We agree and find that under Alabama law, whether the letter was sufficient was a question of fact for a jury to determine.\r\nIn Livingston v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, 176 S.C. 385, 180 S.E. 343 (1935), our Supreme Court discussed the traditional choice of law provision for contracts:\r\n\r\nIt is fundamental that unless there be something intrinsic in, or extrinsic of, the contract that another place of enforcement was intended, the lex loci contractu governs.Â  If the contract be silent thereabout, the presumption is that the law governing the enforcement is the law of the place where the contract is made.\r\n\r\nLivingston, 180 S.E. at 345.\r\nIn the instant case, the guaranty specifically states it â€œshall be interpreted according to the laws of the State of Alabama.â€Â  Accordingly, we look to Alabama law to determine whether Greggâ€™s 1998 letter satisfies the written notification requirement of the guarantee.\r\nIn Sharer v. Bend Millwork Systems, Inc., 600 So.2d 223 (Ala. 1992), the Alabama Supreme Court held a written notice requirement was not satisfied where the creditor had actual notice that the guarantor was no longer affiliated with the borrower.Â  However, in that case, there was no allegation of any writing.Â  Sharer simply alleged the creditor had notice of his intentions to be relieved and that he no longer was involved in the company for which he had executed the guaranty.Â  Id. at 226-227.\r\nHowever, in Lightsey v. Orgill Brothers and Company, Inc., 454 So.2d 1002 (Ala. Civ. App. 1984), the court found:\r\n\r\nIt is settled law that â€œ[a] promise of guaranty Â·Â·Â· is revocable like other offers.â€ 1 A. Corbin, Corbin on Contracts Â§ 38 (1963). â€œThe method of exercising this power [of revocation] varies; usually it is by giving notice to the offeree.â€ 1 A.Corbin, Corbin on Contracts Â§ 38 (1963).\r\nIt is settled law in Alabama that â€œ[c]ontracting parties are free to modify their contract by mutual assent.â€ Kinmon v. J.P. King Auction Co., 290 Ala. 323, 276 So.2d 569 (1973). And, since mutual assent is a factual issue, it must be determined by the jury. Cook v. Sweatt, 282 Ala. 177, 209 So.2d 891 (1965).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nLightsey, 454 So.2d at 1005.\r\nIn Lightsey, the guarantor notified the creditor that they no longer owned the company for which they executed the guaranty.Â  The creditor required them to write a letter advising it of the sale.Â  The letter was written advising of the sale, but did not specifically revoke the personal guaranty.Â  The Alabama court found there was evidence from which the jury could determine whether the letter was sufficient to revoke the personal guaranty.Â  Id. at 1005-06.\r\nThe writing in the case sub judice does not specifically revoke the guaranty, nor does it expressly notify Russell that Greggâ€™s intention was to revoke the guaranty.Â  In addition, Thaxton explained that a written revocation was necessary to comply with guarantyâ€™s provisions.Â  It is undisputed that Gregg never offered additional written notice of his revocation.Â  Accordingly, the issue of whether the letter was sufficient notice of Greggâ€™s intent to revoke the guaranty should have been submitted to the jury for consideration.Â  Therefore, the court erred in granting summary judgment to Gregg.[1]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find there was evidence presented from which a jury could determine Gregg did not properly cancel his personal guaranty in 1992.Â  Additionally, under Alabama law, whether the 1998 letter was sufficient notice to cancel the guaranty is a question for the jury.Â  Therefore, we find the court improperly granted summary judgment to Gregg.Â  The decision of the court is \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.  [2]\r\nANDERSON, J., HUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Russell also argues the court erred to the extent the order can be read to find Russell was estopped from enforcing the guaranty.Â  We agree.Â  Estoppel is an affirmative defense.Â  Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horiz. Prop. Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 345, 415 S.E.2d 384, 388 (1992).Â Â  It was not pled in this case, and was therefore waived.Â  See Howard v. S.C.

Hoisington, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Alexander Mickle appeals a conviction for first-degree burglary arguing the trial court erred in admitting evidence of twelve prior burglary convictions in the Stateâ€™s case in chief.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 22, 2003, Ramzi Ahmed and his roommate, Hafez Muharad, decided to relax after work by shooting pool at a local bar.Â  After spending a couple of hours so occupied, they returned to their Meeting Street apartment in Charleston sometime around 2:00 a.m.Â  As they approached the residence, they noticed a car parked across the street and a man standing by the car closing the trunk.Â  About the same time, the roommates noticed that the front door to their apartment was open.Â  \r\nSuspecting foul play, they walked over to the car and noticed several of their belongings were inside.Â  After being confronted, the driver of the car, who was later identified as Alexander Mickle, quickly jumped in the car and attempted to leave the scene. Â Before he could do so, however, Ramzi Ahmed reached into the car and took the keys out of the ignition.Â  Having prevented Mickle from leaving, Ramzi and Hafez called 911.Â  When Mickle noticed the police were being called, he began to take their belongings out of the car and return them to the apartment.[1]Â  \r\nRamzi Ahmed testified that after Mickle returned the items to the home, he tried to get the roommates to let him leave, stating that since they once again had their belongings no harm was done.Â  When the police arrived a short time later, Mickle was still at the residence.Â  After talking to the roommates, the officer attempted to talk to Mickle alone near his patrol car.Â  Because Mickle was acting â€œagitated and nervousâ€ the officer decided to conduct a protective pat-down search to ensure Mickle was not carrying a weapon.Â  \r\nWhen the officer attempted to search Mickleâ€™s waist area, Mickle reached into his waistband and produced a tire iron.Â  As he raised the tire iron, the officer grabbed Mickle in a bear hug and the two struggled until the tire iron was dropped.Â  The officer told Mickle to stop resisting or he would release his canine.Â  Mickle, however, broke free and began to flee the scene.Â  The officer then released his canine and a short time later Mickle was subdued.Â  On Mickleâ€™s person, the officer found a copy of the Holy Koran, which belonged to Hafez\r\nMuharad.&nbsp; \r\nHaving secured Mickle, the officer did a survey of the house and noticed that the apartment was in a state of disarray, and that the victimsâ€™ property was strewn all over.Â  He further observed pry marks between the door and the doorframe where the house was broken into.Â  When the crime scene was processed a short time later, a number of fingerprints were lifted from various items in the house and molds were taken of the pry marks on the doorframe.Â  \r\nAt trial, an officer testified that Mickleâ€™s fingerprint was found on a cigar box, which allegedly was one of the items that Mickle returned to the house after the victims returned home.Â  Another officer testified that the pry marks were consistent with the tire iron found on Mickleâ€™s person that evening. \r\nMickleâ€™s defense consisted of his testimony that earlier in the evening on the night in question, he met a man at a local bar whom he called â€œBrother Man,â€ until he later found out his name was either â€œNookieâ€ or â€œRookie.â€Â  Mickle stated that he talked to this man for a while at the bar about working for him in his contracting business.Â  They left the bar around 1:30 a.m. at which time Mickle decided he would help this man pick up some of his belongings.Â  They went to what Mickle thought was the manâ€™s home and Mickle testified that he sat in the car while the man made trips to and from the house loading the car with various items.Â  Mickle stated that he became suspicious of him after he began slamming the trunk and asking whether Mickle was interested in purchasing some of the items.Â  Sensing that Mickle was suspicious, he walked away shortly before the homeâ€™s actual residents arrived.Â  \r\nFollowing trial, the jury convicted Mickle of burglary in the first degree, assault of a high and aggravated nature, grand larceny and assault while resisting arrest.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nMickle argues the trial court erred in allowing the state to introduce evidence of twelve prior burglary convictions in its case in chief to support the charge of burglary in the first degree. \r\nBurglary in the first degree is defined by statute as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (A)&nbsp;\r\n         A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in the dwelling, and either:\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        (1)&nbsp;\r\n         when, in effecting entry or while in the dwelling or in immediate flight, he or another participant in the crime:\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              (a)&nbsp;\r\n               is armed with a deadly weapon or explosive; or\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              (b)&nbsp;\r\n               causes physical injury to a person who is not a participant in the crime; or\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              (c)\r\n              uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              (d)&nbsp;\r\n               displays what is or appears to be a knife, pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or other firearm; or\r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        (2)&nbsp;\r\n         the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a combination of both; or\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        (3)&nbsp;\r\n         the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n. . . .\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (2003).\r\nTo support the first-degree burglary charge, the State relied on both the fact that entry occurred in the nighttime and that Mickle had a record of two or more burglary convictions.Â  In fact, Mickle had twelve prior burglary convictions, four for grand larceny, five for receiving stolen goods, and one conviction for breaking and entering of a motor vehicle.Â  \r\nIn a pre-trial conference, Mickle objected to the use of all twelve burglary convictions.Â  Specifically, defense counsel asked that all of the burglary convictions be excluded based on State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923), Rules 609 and 404(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence, and fundamental fairness concerns.Â  In the alternative, counsel asked that the number of convictions admitted be limited to two.\r\nAfter hearing arguments from both sides, the trial court ruled that based on State v. Cheatham, 349 S.C. 101, 561 S.E.2d 618 (Ct. App. 2002) and State v. James, 346 S.C. 303, 551 S.E.2d 591 (Ct. App. 2002), the State could not be required to limit the number of burglary convictions used because the statute does not contain such a restriction.Â  The court further held that because it would issue a curative instruction informing the jury of the limited purpose of the convictions, Mickle would not be prejudiced by their admission.Â  \r\nPrior to this ruling, Mickle informed the court that should it rule against him, he would enter into a stipulation with the State as to the existence of all 12 burglaries.Â  Accordingly, during the Stateâ€™s case in chief, a stipulation was read into evidence outlining Mickleâ€™s prior convictions for burglary.Â  As such, Mickle did not object at the time the convictions were entered into the record.Â  \r\nAlthough Mickleâ€™s position is supported by our supreme courtâ€™s ruling in State v. James, 355 S.C. 25, 583 S.E.2d 745 (2003) (overruling this courtâ€™s decision in State v. James, 346 S.C. 303, 551 S.E.2d 591 (Ct. App. 2002) and holding admission of seven prior burglary convictions was error where the trial court did not conduct an analysis to determine whether the probative value of said convictions outweighed their prejudicial effect), he failed to preserve the issue for our review.Â  It is well settled that a motion in limine to exclude evidence at the start of trial does not preserve an issue for review unless the moving party makes a contemporaneous objection when the evidence is introduced.Â  See e.g., State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 526, 608 S.E.2d 435, 438 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Rather than object when the convictions were offered, Mickle stipulated to their existence; as such, we find the issue to be unpreserved.\r\nEven if the issue was correctly preserved, it would fail on the merits.Â  Although the trial court in the current case failed to conduct an analysis as required by our supreme courtâ€™s decision in James, considering the significant amount of evidence against Mickle, we find any error by the trial court was harmless.Â  See State v. Keenon, 356 S.C. 457, 459, 590 S.E.2d 34-5 (2003) (finding that â€œbecause of the overwhelming evidence of petitionerâ€™s guilt . . . the admission of more than two prior convictions was harmless error.â€).\r\nMickle also argues the trial court erred in failing to conduct an analysis to determine if admission of Mickleâ€™s prior crimes would be more prejudicial than probative before admitting them under 609(a)(2), SCRE.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 609, SCRE reads as follows: \r\n\r\n(a) General Rule.Â  For the purposes of attacking the credibility of a witness, \r\n(1) evidence that a witness other than an accused has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403, if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which the witness was convicted, and evidence that an accused has been convicted of such a crime shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused; and\r\n(2) evidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if it involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.\r\n\r\nSignificantly, Mickle does not dispute whether the convictions admitted were crimes of dishonesty.Â  Mickleâ€™s sole argument is that the trial court should have conducted a prejudicial analysis before admitting the convictions for impeachment purposes. \r\nIn State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d 32 (Ct. App. 2003) we addressed this precise issue.Â  After deciding in that case that armed robbery was a crime of dishonesty under Rule 609(a)(2), we articulated the following holding:\r\n\r\nRule 609(a)(2) provides for automatic admission of evidence of a prior crime of dishonesty without the balancing of probative value against prejudicial effect.Â  This conclusion is supported by the juxtaposition of Rule 609(a)(1) and Rule 609(a)(2).Â  There is absolutely no language in Rule 609(a)(2) compelling a balancing test for admission in regard to a crime of dishonesty.\r\n\r\nAl-Amin at 426, 578 S.E.2d at 43.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in allowing admission of Mickleâ€™s prior crimes of dishonesty.\r\n AFFIRMED.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Roger Lee Arbogast was convicted of trafficking in opium and distribution of Tylenol Four with codeine and sentenced to an aggregate term of 25 years in prison.Â  Arbogast appeals, arguing the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict for him, violating his due process rights, and charging the jury incorrectly.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAn informant for the Spartanburg County Sheriffâ€™s Department contacted Arbogast requesting to purchase from him opium and Tylenol Four with codeine and sell him marijuana.Â  On March 26, 2002, Arbogast sold an undercover officer, who was accompanying the informant, a half full bottle of opium and a bottle of 101 Tylenol Four pills for $225.Â  Arbogast also handed the officer the title to his car and a promissory note in exchange for a half-pound bag of marijuana.Â  The sheriffâ€™s department recorded the entire exchange on video and audio equipment.Â  Upon Arbogastâ€™s immediate arrest, officers discovered another bottle of opium and several more pill bottles in Arbogastâ€™s car, as well as the half-pound bag of marijuana sold to him by the undercover officer.Â  \r\nArbogast was indicted for trafficking in opium, distribution of Tylenol Four with codeine, and distribution of marijuana.Â  At trial, Arbogast presented evidence that he legally obtained the opium and Tylenol through prescriptions for a serious health condition.Â  Though Arbogast admitted he sold the drugs to the undercover officer on March 26, 2002, he testified to numerous occasions when the informant requested drugs, but he would not provide them.Â  Arbogast also claimed he â€œsure didnâ€™t think [he] was selling as much [opium] as he didâ€ that day.Â  He â€œthought [he] was selling maybe 10 millimeters of opium.â€Â  At the close of the Stateâ€™s case, the trial court granted Arbogastâ€™s motion to dismiss the indictment on distribution of marijuana.Â  Arbogast made no other motions at that time.Â  Following the close of the defenseâ€™s case, Arbogast requested a charge on entrapment, which was granted.Â  Arbogast made no other motions prior to the trial courtâ€™s charge to the jury.Â  Following the jury charge, Arbogast made a motion for a directed verdict because the indictment incorrectly referred to opium as a schedule one controlled substance, instead of a schedule two, as required by section 44-53-210(b)(1) of the South Carolina Code (2002).Â  The State then made a motion to amend the indictment to reflect opium as a scheduled two controlled substance.Â  The trial court denied both motions and submitted all evidence to the jury.Â  \r\nThe jury found Arbogast guilty of both charges, and the trial court sentenced him to twenty-five years for trafficking in opium and five years concurrent for distribution of Tylenol Four with codeine.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by factual findings of the trial court unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  A trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The appellate court should examine the record to determine whether there is any evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  If there is any evidence in the record, the appellate court should affirm.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nArbogast claims the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because the indictment incorrectly cited opium as a schedule one controlled substance.Â  We disagree. \r\nWe find the motion regarding sufficiency of the indictment to be improperly raised, particularly because Arbogast failed to raise an objection before the jury was sworn as required by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 103, 610 S.E.2d 494, 500 (2005) (â€œBecause Appellant did not raise the sufficiency of the indictments before the jury was sworn, he cannot now raise this issue on appeal.â€).Â  Furthermore, Arbogast failed to move for a directed verdict at the end of the Stateâ€™s case or his own.Â  See State v. Rosemond, 348 S.C. 621, 627, 560 S.E.2d 636, 639-40 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Therefore, this issue was not preserved for our review.Â  However, we will address this issue on its merits. \r\nIn ruling on motions for a directed verdict, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions and to deny the motions when either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Jinks v. Richland County, 355 S.C. 341, 345, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283 (2003).Â  When considering directed verdict motions, neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 308, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002).Â  â€œIn essence, we must determine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.â€ Bultman v. Barber, 277 S.C. 5, 7, 281 S.E.2d 791, 792 (1981).Â  â€œIf the evidence is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the jury.â€Â  Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 594, 503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998).\r\nA defendant must be convicted of the particular offense charged in the indictment.Â  State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d 75, 79 (1993).Â  A material variance between the charge and the proof entitles the defendant to a directed verdict.Â  Id.Â  However, a variance is not material â€œwhere the matter alleged is not an element of the offense.â€Â  State v. Hiott, 276 S.C. 72, 81, 276 S.E.2d 163, 167 (1981).Â  Moreover, when an indictment contains matters unnecessary to the description of the offense, the unnecessary language may be disregarded as surplusage, and no proof thereof is required.Â  State v. Thompson, 305 S.C. 496, 501 n.1, 409 S.E.2d 420, 423 n.1 (Ct. App. 1991).Â Â Â  \r\nFollowing the trial courtâ€™s jury charge, Arbogast made a motion for a directed verdict because the indictment charged Arbogast with â€œknowingly sell[ing] . . . more than (28) twenty-eight grams of Opium, a scheduled I controlled substance.â€ (emphasis added).Â  According to section 44-53-210(b)(1) of the South Carolina Code (2002), opium is a scheduled II controlled substance.Â  This, however, is not an essential element of the offense of trafficking in opium.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(3)(c) (2002 and Supp. 2004).Â  Section 44-53-370(e)(3)(c) states the following:\r\n\r\n  Any person who knowingly sells, manufactures, cultivates, delivers, purchases, or brings into this State, \r\n  . . .\r\n  (3) four grams or more of any morphine, opium, salt, isomer, or salt of an isomer thereof, including heroin, . . . or four grams or more of any mixture containing any of these substances, is guilty of a felony which is known as â€œtrafficking in illegal drugsâ€ and, upon conviction, must beÂ  punished as follows if the quantity involved is: \r\n  . . .\r\n  (c) twenty-eight grams or more, a mandatory term of imprisonment of not less than twenty-five years nor more than forty years, no part of which may be suspended nor probation granted, and a fine of two hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the language in the indictment regarding the schedule of narcotic involved was mere surplusage.Â  Thompson, 305 S.C. at 501 n.1, 409 S.E.2d at 423 n.1.Â  Designation of the schedule in which opium was listed in the statute was not necessary for the indictment to fully apprise Arbogast of the charges against him.Â  See State v. Lawrence, 264 S.C. 3, 12, 212 S.E.2d 52, 56 (1975) (â€œIt was unnecessary for the indictment to designate the schedule on which amphetamine was listed in order to fully apprise appellants of the charge against them.â€).Â Â Â  \r\nArbogast also asserts the following issues: (1) the trial court violated his due process rights by charging him with trafficking in opium, an illegal activity, even though he obtained the opium through legal prescriptions; (2) the trial court erred in charging the jury on the lesser-included offense of distribution of opium, but failed to provide the lesser-included offense as an optional sentence on the verdict form; and (3) the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that conviction of the offense of trafficking in cocaine required Arbogast to knowingly sell more than four grams of opium.Â  \r\nâ€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilkie, 330 S.C. 71, 75, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  Contemporaneous objection is required to properly preserve error for appellate review.Â  State v.

Green appeals the denial of her request for workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  The single commissioner and appellate panel of the commission (the Commission) found Green failed to sustain her burden of proving her claimed injury was causally related to her employment.Â  The decision was affirmed by the circuit court.Â  We also affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nClaimant Donna A. Green was employed by Respondent GKN Automotive as an assembly line worker in the companyâ€™s Columbia automotive parts factory.Â  Green had worked for GKN for approximately two years when, on February 7, 2002, she claims she was injured on the job.Â  In her testimony before the single commissioner, Green described what she was doing on February 7 and how she was purportedly injured.Â  She testified that she had been given a new job assignment that day working on a â€œGMX 320â€ machine performing â€œoperations 30 and 40,â€ tasks Green asserted were not her regularly assigned work.Â  These â€œoperationsâ€ required Green to assemble steel automobile prop shafts.Â  When assembled, these prop shafts were roughly seven feet in length and each weighed about 20 pounds.Â  Green was then required to hang each of the finished shafts on a rack approximately seven feet tall.Â  Green claimed that, because of her height (about five feet, two inches tall), she had to lift the assembled prop shafts above her head and shoulders, stretch, and stand on the tips of her toes in order to place shafts on the rack.Â  Green claimed this exertion caused her great strain, resulting in â€œmuscle spasmsâ€ down her left and right side.Â  She testified that she also began to feel pain and numbness in her arms during her hour-long drive home on the evening of February 7.Â  \r\nWhen Green returned to the factory the next morning, she claimed the pain and numbness she experienced the night before continued and became more severe as she began her dayâ€™s work.Â  She reported the problem to her supervisor and the safety officer at the factory who sent her to Providence Occupational Health Services for examination.Â  Green was examined by Dr. Richard Boyer, who determined she was suffering from Paresthesia, or a tingling sensation, in her left arm.Â  He prescribed heat and ibuprofen to reduce the discomfort, and found she was fit to return to work without any restrictions on her activities.Â  \r\nGreen continued working normal hours until February 25, 2002, when she visited her personal physician complaining of continued upper body pain and numbness.Â  Greenâ€™s doctor examined her and determined she should be excused from work and that she should be treated with a regimen of physical therapy.Â  Green followed her doctorâ€™s adviceâ€”leaving work and attending regular therapy.Â  After several months of treatment, Green returned to work in May 2002, but she was only able to work one week.Â  Shortly thereafter, Green filed a Form 50 seeking temporary total disability benefits. \r\nAt the hearing before the single commissioner, it was brought to light that Green had offered vague and contradictory reports to her employer concerning how she was injured.Â  A critical inconsistency was discovered in a â€œPersonal Injury Reportâ€ Green had filled out and submitted to GKN on February 8, 2002, the day after her alleged injury at the factory.Â  In this report, Green indicated that she was injured while performing â€œoperation 50â€ which she further indicated was her â€œregularly assigned workâ€â€”not the new, unfamiliar work of â€œoperations 30 and 40â€ on the â€œGMX 320â€ machine as she testified to before the single commissioner.Â  Green also wrote in this report that the injury occurred because the â€œpedestal wheel [was] too tightâ€â€”again, contrary to her testimony that she was injured while attempting to lift the steel prop shafts onto a rack.Â  Green also acknowledged that when she initially reported her injury to the factory safety officer and her supervisor, she was unable to tell either person exactly how she was injured.Â  \r\nAnother inconsistency was discovered in a form requesting short-term disability benefits Green had filled out and submitted to GKNâ€™s insurance carrier in March 2002.Â  This form required Green to describe the physical ailment that was preventing her from working, and specifically asked: â€œIs this condition work related?â€ and â€œIf Yes, do you intend to file a Workersâ€™ Compensation claim?â€Â  Green did not answer either of these two questions, leaving that portion of the form blank.Â  \r\nFurther questions were raised concerning similar inconsistencies reflected in the medical reports prepared by Greenâ€™s treating physicians.Â  For example, Dr. Boyer, the first doctor Green visited the day after her claimed injury, reported that Green complained of pain in her left arm, with no mention made of any other part of her body.Â  However, the report prepared by Greenâ€™s personal physician after her examination two weeks later indicates that her pain started in her right arm.Â Â  \r\nAfter the hearing, the single commissioner entered an order denying Greenâ€™s request for workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  In reaching this decision, the single commissioner noted the material inconsistencies in how Green reported her alleged injury to her employer and treating physicians.Â  The commissioner found that Green was unable to recall any specific incident that resulted in her injury, noting that she could not tell her GKN supervisor or the safety specialist how she was injured, nor could she provide this basic information to Dr. Boyer.Â  The commissioner also found that Green failed to indicate that her injuries were work-related when she applied for short-term disability benefits.Â  Based on these findings, the commissioner concluded Green had not met her burden of proving she had suffered an â€œaccidentâ€ or â€œinjuryâ€ as those terms are defined under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act or that the physical ailments she claimed to have suffered were causally related to her employment.Â Â  \r\nGreen appealed the single commissionerâ€™s order to the Commission, arguing the single commissioner erred in failing to find she had suffered a â€œrepetitive trauma injury.â€Â  The Commission denied the appeal and adopted the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  Subsequent appeal was taken to the circuit court which was also denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 133-34, 276 S.E.2d 304, 305-06 (1981).Â  Under the APA, our scope of review is limited to deciding whether the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Rodriguez v. Romero, 363 S.C. 80, 84, 610 S.E.2d 488, 490 (2005); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).\r\nThe findings of the Commission will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 492, 541 S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001).Â  As our courts have repeatedly held, substantial evidence is not a â€œmere scintilla of evidence,â€ nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 622, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004).Â  The Commission is the ultimate fact finder and the final arbiter of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence.Â  See Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 67, 456 S.E.2d 366, 368 (1995).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn this appeal, Green asserts both legal and factual error with regard to the Commissionâ€™s ruling that she failed to prove a compensable injury occurred.Â  Specifically, she argues the Commission applied the wrong legal standard for determining causation in this case and that, in any event, the Commissionâ€™s ruling is unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  We disagree, finding the Commission applied the proper legal standard and that its ruling is amply supported by substantial evidence.\r\nFor an injury to be compensable under our workersâ€™ compensation laws, an employee must show that her injury arose â€œout ofâ€ and â€œin the course of employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2003).Â  â€œAn injury arises out of employment when there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal relationship between the conditions under which the work is to be performed and the resulting injury.â€Â  Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 518, 466 S.E.2d 357, 358 (1996) (quoting Owings v. Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Depâ€™t, 315 S.C. 297, 299, 433 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1993)).Â  \r\nGreen correctly points out that our supreme court has ruled that repetitive events causing trauma to a worker in the course of employment may be found compensable as â€œaccidentsâ€ or â€œinjuriesâ€ under the Act.Â  See Pee v. AVM, Inc., 352 S.C. 167, 174, 573 S.E.2d 785, 789 (2002) (holding that a repetitive trauma injury meets the definition of â€œinjury by accidentâ€ under the Act in that it is an unforeseen injury caused by trauma).Â  â€œRepetitive trauma injuries . . . have a gradual onset caused by the cumulative effect of repetitive traumatic events or â€˜mini-accidents.â€™â€Â  Schulknight v. City of North Charleston, 352 S.C. 175, 178, 574 S.E.2d 194, 195 (2002).\r\nAs the claimant in this case, Green bore the burden of proving such facts as to render her injury compensable under the Act, and we recognize the Commission was under a concomitant obligation to enter specific findings based on its review of the record.Â  Shealy v. Algernon Blair, Inc., 250 S.C. 106, 109-10, 156 S.E.2d 646, 648 (1967).\r\nIn the present case, the Commissionâ€”in adopting the order of the single commissionerâ€”did not enter any specific findings or otherwise opine on the question of whether Green suffered a compensable â€œrepetitive traumaâ€ injury, and there was no reason for the Commission to do so.Â  Green proceeded on the basis that her claimed injury occurred as a result of one distinct incidentâ€”a single dayâ€™s work assembling the steel prop shafts on February 7, 2002, away from her regularly assigned duties.[2]Â  The claim was not presented as one involving a repetitive trauma.Â  We find Greenâ€™s suggestion that this is a repetitive trauma case to be incongruous with the facts in the record before us.Â  In any event, in light of the critical inconsistencies in Greenâ€™s case and the Commissionâ€™s role in assessing credibility, there is substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s determination that Green failed to establish a work related injury, be it a repetitive trauma injury or otherwise.[3]  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission applied the correct legal standard and that its determination finds substantial evidentiary support in the record.Â  The order of the Commission finding Donna Green was not entitled to workersâ€™ compensation benefits is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, and KITTREDGE, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n [2]&nbsp; Indeed, both parties stipulated in proceedings before the single commissioner that â€œ[t]he date of Claimantâ€™s alleged injury is February 7, 2002.â€ \r\n[3]Â Â  Green maintains that all of the inconsistencies in her various accounts can be attributed to faulty recollection or mistake by herself or others.Â  To be sure, Greenâ€™s attempts to explain these evidentiary problems may be credible.Â  However, such determinations go to the heart of assessing witness credibility and the weight to be assigned to the testimonyâ€”matters exclusively within the province of the Commission.Â  See Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 67, 456 S.E.2d 366, 368 (1995) (noting that the final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Commission); see also Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 160, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999) (noting that â€œ[t]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent the Commissionâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidenceâ€).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-567","title":"State v.

App. 2004).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSection 17-202(e) of the City of Columbia Code of\r\nOrdinances provides that â€œ[a] non-conforming use or characteristic of use\r\nshall not be reestablished after vacancy, abandonment, or discontinuance for any\r\nperiod of 12 consecutive months.â€&nbsp; \r\n\r\nColumbia\r\n, \r\nS.C.\r\n\r\n, Code Â§ 17-202(e) (1998).&nbsp; The\r\nDowlings contend they never discontinued operating a boarding house, and they\r\ncould not, therefore, have forfeited their right to operate a boarding house\r\npursuant to the 1981 certificate of non-compliance.&nbsp;\r\nThey contend that a residential care facility is simply a specialized\r\ntype of boarding house, and the Board erred in finding otherwise.&nbsp;\r\nWe disagree.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Dowlings argue that a â€œcommunity residential care facilityâ€ is included within the definition of â€œboarding houseâ€ as found in the Cityâ€™s Code.[2]Â  However, the record shows that â€œcommunity residential care facilityâ€ is separately defined in the code and emphasizes that its residents, unlike residents of a boarding house, require a degree of â€œpersonal assistance.â€[3]Â  The record further shows that boarding houses are specifically excluded from RG-1 zoning while a facility such as the one operated by the Dowlings pursuant to their DHEC license is exempt from zoning under State law.[4]Â  Finally, boarding house and community care facilities have separate classifications in the SIC, a standardized industrial coding system adopted by the City for use in zoning.Â  Consequently, there is ample evidence in the record to support the Boardâ€™s conclusion that a boarding house and a residential care facility are two distinct types of uses for property.Â  \r\n  The Dowlings further argue that the City is estopped from claiming that the residential care facility was not concurrently a boarding house, because the City issued business licenses to the Dowlings for the operation of a boarding house from 1976 through 2001.Â  However, according to the Cityâ€™s Zoning Administrator, classifications within the licensing division are fee-based and involve more generalized categories.Â  Furthermore, the only time the zoning department approves of the license is upon the initial issuance.Â  After that, the renewal of a license is more or less a routine matter of paperwork and the payment of fees.Â  There is no evidence in the record to suggest the City considered the residential care facility to constitute a boarding house for zoning purposes.\r\n  Finally, the Dowlings argue that the character of their property never changed, and the board erred in holding that they failed to produce any evidence to support such a contention.Â  Again, we disagree.Â  It was incumbent upon the Dowlings to present evidence showing that the character of their property did not change.Â  However, there was no testimony or other evidence presented to that effect.Â  The Dowlings relied on the Cityâ€™s awarding of the business licenses and the definitions in the code to make their case.Â  Those items do nothing to elucidate how the property was used by the Dowlings and therefore cannot support an argument that the character of the property remained unchanged.Â  \r\n  For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude the decision of the board was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.Â  Therefore, the decision of the circuit court is\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  HEARN, C.J., STILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  A â€œrooming houseâ€ or â€œboarding houseâ€ is â€œany dwelling, other than a hotel or motel, in which more than three persons who are not members of the ownerâ€™s or operatorâ€™s family are housed or lodged in rooms used or intended to be used for living and sleeping but not for cooking or eating purposes, for compensation . . . .â€Â  Columbia, S.C., Code Â§ 17-55 (1998).\r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  â€œCommunity residential care facility includes any institution, place, building or agency providing for a period exceeding 24 consecutive hours accommodation, board, and a degree of personal assistance in feeding, dressing or other essential daily living activities to two or more individuals not related to the administrator or owner . . . .â€Â  Columbia, S.C., Code Â§ 17-55 (1998).\r\n[4] Â Â Â Â Â Â  S.C.

Breeden, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-572\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2005 â€“ Filed October 27, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nO. Shayne Williams, of Charleston, for Appellants. \r\nWilliam I. Diggs, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Geraldine Daniels applied for workersâ€™ compensation benefits alleging a change in physical condition.Â  The single commissioner, commission, and circuit court found Daniels sustained a change in condition for the worse, entitling her to payment of medical expenses and temporary total disability benefits.Â  Bi-Lo, as Danielsâ€™ former employer, and its carrier (collectively â€œBi-Loâ€) appeal.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn April of 2001, Daniels sustained an injury while working for Bi-Lo.Â  By order dated December 13, 2002, the single commissioner found the injury compensable.Â  Bi-Lo appealed the commissionerâ€™s order to the full commission.Â  While the appeal was pending, Daniels applied for additional benefits, alleging she sustained a compensable change in condition.Â  \r\nFor her initial injury, Daniels received medical care from Drs. Young and Poletti.Â  At that time, based on a 2001 MRI performed on Daniels, Dr. Young concluded that Daniels suffered â€œ[m]oderate to moderately severe degenerative disc/osteophyte disease . . . .â€ Â Dr. Poletti likewise examined the 2001 MRI and found Daniels would be a candidate for surgery but recommended against it because Daniels was experiencing unusual symptoms including blurred vision and ringing in her ears.Â  \r\nIn 2003, Daniels allegedly suffered a change in condition for the worse and sought treatment from Dr. Giddens.Â  Dr. Giddens ordered another MRI.Â  Dr. Giddens â€œdiscussed performing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion . . . based upon an MRI scan demonstrating significant disc herniation . . . [and] also noted . . . that [Danielsâ€™] disc herniation was the likely culprit for her . . . symptoms.â€[2]Â  By letter dated January 20, 2004, Dr. Giddens conceded he could not â€œanswer . . . questions regarding whether or not [Danielsâ€™] condition was worsened . . . .â€Â  He stated, however, that Daniels reported increased pain and a worsened condition, and he recommended surgery.Â  \r\nDr. Young reviewed the 2003 MRI and found no change in condition.Â  Dr. Poletti also found no change in condition.Â  However, he agreed with Dr. Giddens that Daniels was now a surgical candidate and further opined that surgery could relieve some of Danielsâ€™ pain.Â  \r\nAt the hearing before the single commissioner, Daniels testified that her pain had worsened since the initial award.Â  She explained:Â  â€œThe pain is longer, the pain is more, it comes on me more than it did.â€ Â Daniels also relied on the opinion of Dr. Giddens.Â  Bi-Lo relied on the opinions of Drs. Young and Poletti.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner concluded Daniels sustained a change in physical condition for the worse and ordered Bi-Lo to compensate Daniels for medical expenses and temporary total disability.Â  Both an appellate panel of the commission and the circuit court affirmed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of whether a claimant experiences a change in condition\r\nis a question for the fact finder.Â  Krell v. South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t, 237 S.C. 584, 588, 118 S.E.2d 322, 323-24 (1961).Â  The Administrative Procedures Act establishes the substantial evidence standard of review for factual findings made by the commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 133, 276 S.E.2d 304, 305 (1981).Â  Under the substantial evidence standard of review, this court may reverse the commissionâ€™s findings only when they are unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  â€œâ€˜Substantial evidenceâ€™ is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its action.â€Â  Lark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n    Bi-Lo argues there was neither medical evidence nor claimant testimony supporting the finding that Daniels sustained a change in condition for the worse.[3]Â  We disagree.Â  A change in condition occurs when the claimant experiences a change in physical condition as a result of the original injury, after the initial award.Â  Gattis v. Murrells Inlet VFW #10420, 353 S.C. 100, 109, 576 S.E.2d 191, 196 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The commission may consider lay testimony and medical evidence in determining if a claimant has suffered a change in condition.Â  Lloyd v. AT&amp;T Nassau Metals Corp., 299 S.C. 207, 208, 383 S.E.2d 257, 258 (Ct. App. 1989). \r\n    The commissioner found Dr. Giddens more credible than Dr. Poletti in part because Dr. Poletti expressed an opinion that there was no change in condition but conceded that surgery could now relieve some of Danielsâ€™ pain.Â  The commissioner further found Daniels to be credible.Â  The commission adopted these findings, and the circuit court affirmed.Â  Applying the substantial evidence rule of appellate review, as we must, we find evidence to support these findings.Â  \r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    For the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is\r\n     AFFIRMED.\r\n    HEARN, C.J., STILWELL and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n    \r\n    [1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n    [2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Although Dr. Giddensâ€™ records are not included in the record on appeal, his findings are summarized by the commissioner.Â  Bi-Lo does not challenge the commissionerâ€™s summarization.Â  \r\n    [3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Although Bi-Lo lists three issues on appeal, it essentially raises only one issue:Â  whether there is error in the finding of a change in condition.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-573","title":"State v.

Spencer, of Columbia; and Solicitor David Michael Pascoe, Jr., of St. Matthews, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Timothy Phillips appeals his convictions for assault and battery with intent to kill, possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, and injuring or disabling a police dog.Â  We affirm.\r\nOn the evening of April 6, 2003, an altercation erupted between Timothy Phillips and his 14-year-old stepson Jeffrey, resulting in Jeffrey calling 911. Â Ashley, Phillipsâ€™s wife, intervened in the conflict, and the couple began fighting. Â Jeffrey left the house during the fight. Â \r\nAshley missed Jeffrey once the fight ended and ran outside to look for him.Â  Phillips followed after to help look for Jeffrey and brought a shotgun.[1]Â  Ashley encountered Deputy Michael Deese, who had been dispatched to answer the 911 call. Â Ashley told Deese her son was missing, Phillips was armed, the situation was serious, and Phillips was going to kill her. Â While they talked, Phillips approached and pointed his shotgun in the direction of Deese, who had remained in his vehicle. Â \r\nDeese ordered Phillips to drop the shotgun several times and drew his own weapon. Â A firefight ensued, resulting in Phillips wounding Deese and the police dog in his vehicle.[2] Â Ashley ran to the nearby home of Jennifer Johnson[3] when the shooting began.Â  Phillips was arrested at his home and subsequently convicted of the charges noted above. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â Â Phillips argues the trial judge erred by refusing to give specific answers requested by the defense in response to the juryâ€™s questions. Â We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the courtâ€™s jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.â€Â  State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 318, 577 S.E.2d 460, 463&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003). Â â€œJury instructions should be considered as a whole, and if as a whole they are free from error, any isolated portions which may be misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€Â  State v. Buckner, 341 S.C. 241, 246-47, 534 S.E.2d 15, 18&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œTo warrant reversal, a trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.â€Â  State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 106, 610 S.E.2d 859, 865 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nIn a note, the jury asked the trial judge two questions regarding the jury instructions on assault and battery with intent to kill.Â  The first asked, â€œIf the defendant is found guilty of assault and battery with a shotgun, is that automatic intent to kill?â€Â  The second question was, â€œDoes assault and battery with a deadly weapon constitute intent to kill?â€Â  The defense asked the judge to specifically answer the questions.Â  \r\nThe trial judge declined to do so, reasoning it would be a charge on the facts and an invasion of the juryâ€™s role to make factual determinations in the case.Â  See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 21 (â€œJudges shall not charge juries in respect to matters of fact, but shall declare the law.â€); State v. Bagwell, 201 S.C. 387, 399,&nbsp;23 S.E.2d 244, 249 (1942) (â€œA [j]udge cannot express in his charge, or intimate any opinion as to the weight or the sufficiency of testimony . . . without violating the prohibition of the Constitution as to charging upon the facts.â€).\r\nThe trial judge also felt the questions too complex to be answered either â€œyesâ€ or â€œno.â€ Â He reiterated large portions of his original instructions to the jury with the expectation it would answer the juryâ€™s questions.[4] Â See Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 53, 557 S.E.2d 676, 686 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œIt is not error to refuse a request to charge when the substance of the request is included in the general instructions.â€); State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 303&nbsp;(2002) (â€œThe substance of the law must be charged to the jury, not particular verbiage.â€).\r\nAfter reviewing the record, we find the charge contained all of the applicable legal principles for the jury to make its determination.Â  The trial judge adequately addressed the juryâ€™s questions without intruding upon the juryâ€™s role as the ultimate finder of fact.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s charge, considered as a whole, was appropriate and does not constitute error.Â  \r\n2.Â Phillips next argues the trial judge erred in limiting the defenseâ€™s cross-examination of Jennifer Johnson concerning statements allegedly made by Phillipsâ€™s wife, Ashley.Â  \r\nâ€œOur courts have consistently held that the scope and extent of cross-examination is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial judge.â€ Â State v. Sierra, 337 S.C. 368, 373, 523 S.E.2d 187, 189 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œThis court will not disturb the trial judgeâ€™s decision unless appellant shows both prejudice and an abuse of discretion.â€ Â Id. Â \r\nJohnson testified she heard gunshots and then saw Ashley come into her yard within minutes of the shooting.Â  Johnson, who did not know Ashley at the time of the incident, testified Ashley â€œsaid that her husband just shot a cop, she thought he killed him, and that he was now after her and she [was] just looking for a place to hide and she just wanted to hide there.â€Â  The trial judge allowed this into evidence under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. Â \r\nOn cross-examination, Phillips sought to ask Johnson if in her written statement to the police she said Ashley told her:Â  (1) Ashley had called the police, (2) the police came to the Phillipsesâ€™ home, and (3) Phillips appeared from the side of the Phillipsesâ€™ home and shot at the police vehicle. Â The State objected on the ground that Johnsonâ€™s prior statement was inadmissible unless inconsistent with her testimony in court.Â  \r\nPhillipsâ€™s goal was to undermine Ashleyâ€™s credibility or show Johnsonâ€™s memory to be unreliable.Â  Even assuming it was error for the trial court to prevent Phillips from questioning Johnson on the prior statement, the courtâ€™s ruling was not prejudicial.Â  See State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 194, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243&nbsp;(1990) (â€œError is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€).Â  Here, Ashley admitted during her testimony that what she told police was not an honest account and that she may have embellished things out of anger.Â  \r\n3.Â Phillips contends the trial judge erred by admitting testimony concerning the permanent scarring Deputy Deese received from injuries in the shooting. Â We disagree. Â \r\nâ€œThe relevance, materiality, and admissibility of evidence are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court and a ruling will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 184, 577 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2003). Â â€œA trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances.â€ Â State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct. App. 2003). \r\nPhillips objected to a plastic surgeonâ€™s testimony that Deese will have permanent scarring from his wound. Â Â Â \r\nâ€œAssault and battery with intent to kill is an unlawful act of violent nature to the person of another with malice aforethought . . . .â€ Â State v. Hinson, 253 S.C. 607, 611, 172 S.E.2d 548, 550 (1970). Â â€œ[I]ntent [for purposes of malice] may be shown by acts and conduct of [the] accused and other circumstances from which the jury may naturally and reasonably infer intent; evidence of . . . resulting wounds or injuries, etc., are admissible to show the intent with which the assault was committed.â€ Â State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 16 n.4, 479 S.E.2d 50, 52 n.4 (1996) (citing 41 C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 195).Â  \r\nâ€œ[Assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature] is the unlawful act of violent injury to another accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.â€ Â Tate v. State, 351 S.C. 418, 427, 570 S.E.2d 522, 527 (2002). Â â€œCircumstances of aggravation include . . . infliction of serious bodily injury Â . . . .â€ Â Id. \r\nPermanent scarring provides evidence of wounds or injuries and evidence of the infliction of a serious bodily injury. Â The trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding the probative nature of the evidence was, we conclude, correct.\r\n4.Â Phillips asserts the trial judge erred by limiting presentations at sentencing to one person per side. Â Only Phillips spoke on his behalf. Â \r\nâ€œThe general rule in this State is that the conduct of a criminal trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the presiding judge and this Court will not interfere unless it clearly appears that the rights of the complaining party were abused or prejudiced in some way.â€Â  State v. Bridges,&nbsp;278 S.C. 447, 448, 298 S.E.2d 212, 212 (1982).\r\nInsomuch as an â€œomission [of allocution] is not fatal to affirmance of sentence for any offense less than capital,â€ [State v. Phillips, 215 S.C. 314, 318-19 54, S.E.2d 901, 903 (1949)], a limitation upon allocution is likewise not fatal.Â  Furthermore, Phillipsâ€™s exchange with the judge satisfied the requirement for allocution.Â  See id. (noting that a lengthy conversation after plea and before sentence between the court and a defendant would meet the requirement for allocution).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Phillips explained on the stand that he brought a shotgun to go to a hunting club, but changed his plans when he realized Jeffrey was missing.Â  \r\n[2] The record is not clear regarding who fired first.Â  \r\n[3] At the time of the incident, she was named Jennifer Barnes. \r\n[4] The trial judge instructed the jury that the use of a weapon may be considered in determining the intent of the defendant: â€œEvidence of the character of the assault, the character of the instrument used, the manner in which it was used, the purpose to be accomplished and the resulting wounds or injuries may be considered in determining the intent with which the assault was committed.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
