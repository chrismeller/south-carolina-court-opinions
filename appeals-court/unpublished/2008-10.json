Driggers, Sr., of Hartsville; William O. Sweeny, III, and\r\n  William R. Calhoun, both of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tKenneth L. Childs, Allen D. Smith, and Allison Aiken Hanna of Columbia; Michael A. Nunn and Benjamin A. Baroody, both of Florence; for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  Betty and Amy Quick[1] appeal the trial judgeâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Markel Insurance Company\r\n  (Markel) and the Chesterfield County School District (District).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMarkel issued to the District a blanket accident and\r\n  health insurance policy.Â  Under this policy, students could obtain insurance\r\n  coverage.Â  One insurance plan provided coverage for a student during school\r\n  hours during the school year while another plan covered a student 24 hours a\r\n  day for an entire year.Â  The District collected and transmitted the studentsâ€™\r\n  insurance payments to Markel.Â  At the beginning of the 2000-2001 school year, Ms.\r\n  Quick purchased the 24-hour insurance for Amy for a one-time premium of $39\r\n  while paying for other fees and expenses during the pre-registration process at\r\n  Cheraw High School, a school located within the District.Â  \r\nMarkel\r\n  provided the school with brochures that explained the 24-hour policyâ€™s terms\r\n  and exclusions.Â  According to Markel and the District, these brochures were\r\n  made available to people purchasing insurance during the pre-registration\r\n  process and were given to students during homeroom to take home with them.Â  The\r\n  Quicks claim they never received any information on the policy from Markel and\r\n  were not provided a brochure explaining the coverage.Â  Ms. Quick did not ask\r\n  any questions about the 24-hour insurance policy. Â At the time she purchased insurance\r\n  for her daughter, Ms. Quick only knew the Markel policy would cover Amy during\r\n  the 2000-2001 school year, the policy provided â€œ24-hourâ€ coverage, and the\r\n  policy was â€œcomprehensive.â€[2]Â  \r\nOn November\r\n  23, 2000, Amy was in an automobile accident while riding as a passenger in a\r\n  vehicle driven by her boyfriend.Â  She suffered significant injuries, including the\r\n  loss of one eye and a broken femur.Â  Amy incurred medical bills from the\r\n  accident amounting to approximately $55,000.Â  The 24-hour policy provided\r\n  compensation of $2,500 for medical bills incurred as a result of the automobile\r\n  accident and $5,000 for the loss of the eye.Â  Markel paid the policyâ€™s limit of\r\n  $7,500 to the Quicks.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Quicks filed a lawsuit against Markel and the District, as Markelâ€™s agent, for breach\r\n  of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and waiver and estoppel.Â  In\r\n  addition, the Quicks asserted a claim against Markel for insurance bad faith.Â  They\r\n  sought $75,000 in damages and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  All of the parties filed motions\r\n  for summary judgment.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to Markel and\r\n  the District on the Quicksâ€™ claim for waiver and estoppel and to Markel on the\r\n  bad faith claim.Â  It denied summary judgment as to the causes of action for\r\n  breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation against Markel and the\r\n  District. Â \r\nThe\r\n  Quicks filed their second amended complaint against Markel and the District\r\n  asserting causes of action for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation,\r\n  and negligence.Â  The parties again filed motions for summary judgment.Â  The\r\n  trial court granted summary judgment to Markel and the District on all three\r\n  causes of action.Â  It subsequently denied the Quicksâ€™ motion for\r\n  reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the\r\n  disposition of cases that do not require the services of a fact finder.Â  Dawkins\r\n    v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438 (2003).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine\r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321\r\n  (2001).Â  The evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in\r\n  the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  â€œIt is well\r\n  established that summary judgment should be granted â€˜. . . in cases in which\r\n  plain, palpable and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot\r\n  differ.â€™â€Â  Anders v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 307 S.C. 371, 373,\r\n  415 S.E.2d 406, 407 (Ct. App. 1992) (quoting Main v. Corley, 281 S.C.\r\n  525, 526, 316 S.E.2d 406, 407 (1984)); see Bloom v. Ravoira, 339\r\n  S.C. 417, 425, 529 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2000) (finding where a verdict is not\r\n  reasonably possible under the facts presented, summary judgment is proper).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  Quicks argue the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of\r\n  Markel and the District on their claim for negligence. Â We disagree.\r\nIn order to prove negligence, the Quicks must show:Â  â€œ(1)\r\n  the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant breached\r\n  the duty by a negligent act or omission; (3) the defendantâ€™s breach was the\r\n  actual and proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury; and (4) the plaintiff\r\n  suffered an injury or damages.â€Â  Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 400, 645\r\n  S.E.2d 245, 250 (2007).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court assumed for the purpose of summary judgment that the appellants did\r\n  not actually receive Markelâ€™s brochure outlining the terms, conditions, and\r\n  limitations of the blanket accident and health policy issued by it to the\r\n  District.Â  Instead, the trial court held Markel and the District did not have a\r\n  duty to explain all of the risks and coverages to the Quicks.Â  We agree with\r\n  this holding.Â  \r\nIt\r\n  is important to note that this is a blanket accident and health policy, not an\r\n  individual policy. Â Thus, according to statute, the District is the\r\n  policyholder. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-71-1020.Â  Section 38-71-1020 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code incorporates the provisions for individual accident and health\r\n  policies found in Article 3 of Chapter 71 into the provisions for blanket\r\n  policies found in Article 9.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-71-1020 (2002) (â€œAll blanket\r\n  accident and health insurance policies are subject to the provision of Articles\r\n  1 and 3 of this chapter.â€). Â Section 38-71-550 of Article 3 requires an outline\r\n  of coverage for an individual accident and health insurance policy to be â€œdelivered\r\n  to the applicant at the time application is made and an acknowledgment\r\n  of receipt or certificate of delivery of the outline is provided the insured\r\n  with the application.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-71-550(a) (2002) (emphasis added).[3]Â \r\n  However, â€œ[a]n individual application is not required from each individual\r\n  covered under a blanket accident and health policy or contract nor is it\r\n  necessary for the insurer to furnish each individual a certificate.â€ S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 1030 (2002). \r\nThe\r\n  proper interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court. Univ. ofÂ  S. Cal. v. Moran, 365 S.C. 270, 274, 617 S.E. 2d 135, 137\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005). Â â€œThe primary rule of statutory construction is to ascertain\r\n  and give effect to the intent of the legislature.â€Â  Mid-State Auto Auction\r\n    of Lexington v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996). Â â€œ[T]he\r\n  words of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without\r\n  resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the statuteâ€™s\r\n  operation.â€ Â Mun. Assâ€™n of S.C. v. AT &amp; T Communications of S. States,\r\n  361 S.C. 576, 580, 606 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2004).Â  â€œStatutes, as a whole, must\r\n  receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the\r\n  purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.â€Â  TNS Mills v. S.C. Depâ€™t of\r\n    Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 624, 503 S.E.2d 471, 478 (1998).Â  Where a statute is\r\n  ambiguous, the court must construe the terms of the statute and the ambiguity\r\n  should be resolved in favor of a just, beneficial and equitable operation of\r\n  the law. Â City of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 561, 486 S.E.2d 492,\r\n  495 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nClearly,\r\n  the legislature did not intend the disclosure requirement of Section 38-71-550\r\n  to apply to an insured under a blanket policy when the requirement relates to\r\n  disclosure at the time an application is made for insurance coverage or a policy\r\n  of insurance is delivered and section 38-71-1030 specifically exempts individuals\r\n  covered under a blanket policies from the application process or the\r\n  requirement of delivery to each insured a certificate of insurance.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  we understand the policy at issue, the District may add insured students to the\r\n  policy by collecting and paying over to Markel the required premiums and\r\n  furnishing Markel the names of the students to be covered. Â No further acts\r\n  were necessary to be done by Markel or the district to effect coverage of Amy\r\n  Quick. Â We hold neither Markel nor the district violated any provision of\r\n  Chapter 71 of Title 38 of the Code by not delivering a brochure to the Quicks\r\n  at the time the premium was paid or at any other time.[4]\r\nThe\r\n  Quicks assert that under the common law, Markel and the District had a duty to\r\n  provide them with the terms of the policy.Â  As this case involves a blanket\r\n  policy and the District is the policy holder, Markel fulfilled any duty it\r\n  might have by providing a copy of the blanket policy to the District.Â  We hold\r\n  the Quicks failed to prove the District or Markel owed any duty to them to\r\n  directly provide them the terms of the insurance policy.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  the Quicks have failed to establish a duty owed to them, their claim for\r\n  negligence must fail.Â  \r\nThe Quicks assert the trial court erred in granting\r\n  summary judgment on their negligent misrepresentation claim.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nTo establish a claim for negligent misrepresentation,\r\n  the Quicks must be able to prove the following elements:\r\n\r\n\t(1) the\r\n  defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant had a\r\n  pecuniary interest in making the statement; (3) the defendant owed a duty of\r\n  care to see that he communicated truthful information to the plaintiff; (4) the\r\n  defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise due care; (5) the plaintiff\r\n  justifiably relied on the representation; and (6) the plaintiff suffered a\r\n  pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his reliance upon the representation. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nAMA\r\n  Mgmt. Corp. v. Strasburger, 309 S.C.\r\n  213, 222, 420 S.E.2d 868, 874 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Quicks claim Markel and the District made false representations in the letter from\r\n  the District describing the policy as providing â€œcomprehensive accident\r\n  insurance at a nominal costâ€ and stating that it â€œensured coverage for . . .\r\n  normal day-to-day activities.â€Â  The Quicks also take issue with the term\r\n  â€œ24-hour insuranceâ€ asserting the term has a connotation of completeness.Â  Based\r\n  on these statements, the Quicks assert there should be no limits on the\r\n  coverage available under the policy.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  none of these statements make any representations as to the amount of coverage\r\n  available under the policy.Â  They do not support the Quicksâ€™ assertion that\r\n  they are entitled to limitless coverage.Â  In fact, when asked what her\r\n  understanding was of the level of coverage, Ms. Quick responded: Â â€œActually, I\r\n  didnâ€™t.Â  I didnâ€™t know basically what it was going to cover or wasnâ€™t going to\r\n  cover.Â  I just â€“ I know the word assume, but I assumed that was a good policy\r\n  because the school was promoting it, so I didnâ€™t â€“and I had always taken out\r\n  the 24-hour.â€Â  Even if the Districtsâ€™ statements could be construed as\r\n  representing that this was a â€œgood policy,â€ the representations would not be\r\n  actionable.Â  â€œA mere statement of opinion, commendation of goods or services,\r\n  or expression of confidence that a bargain will be satisfactory does not give\r\n  rise to liability in tort.â€Â  AMA Mgmt. Corp., 309 S.C. at 222, 420\r\n  S.E.2d at 874; see Winburn v. Ins. Co. of N. America, 287 S.C.\r\n  435, 440, 339 S.E.2d 142, 146 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding statement that a person\r\n  was a â€œgood mechanicâ€ did not support a claim for fraud).Â  \r\nThere\r\n  is no evidence in the record of any misrepresentation as to the amount of\r\n  coverage available in the policy.Â  We therefore find no error in the trial\r\n  court granting summary judgment in favor of Markel and the District on the\r\n  Quicksâ€™ claim for negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Quicks argue the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on their claim\r\n  for breach of contract.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nTo\r\n  recover for a claim for breach of contract, the Quicks must establish the\r\n  contract, its breach, and the damages caused by such breach.Â  Fuller v. E.\r\n    Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 240 S.C. 75, 89, 124 S.E.2d 602, 610 (1962).Â  â€œInsurance\r\n  policies are subject to the general rules of contract construction.â€ Century\r\n    Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, 348 S.C. 559, 565, 561 S.E.2d 355, 358\r\n  (2002). Â We must give the policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular\r\n  meaning. Â Id.Â  It is undisputed that under the terms of the policy, Amy\r\n  was entitled to $7500.00 for her accident.Â  It is also undisputed Markel paid\r\n  Amy $7500.00, the full amount to which she was entitled under the terms of the\r\n  policy.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Quicks, however, assert the contract was in fact based on the only material she\r\n  received, the letter stating the insurance provided â€œcomprehensiveâ€ and\r\n  â€œ24-hourâ€ coverage.Â  Thus, they claim since their contract contained no\r\n  limitation of coverage, there are no limits.Â  The issue of reformation of the\r\n  contract was never raised nor ruled on by the trial court.Â  See Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is\r\n  axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.â€).Â  The court viewed the insurance policy as written and\r\n  found no breach of contract.Â  We find no error in this ruling.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order of the trial court granting summary judgment\r\n  to Markel and the District is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Amy, whose date of birth is April 26, 1983, was no\r\n  longer a minor at the of the filing of this action. \r\n[2]Â  A letter from the school district briefly explaining\r\n  the insurance plans available for students mentioned the coverage was â€œcomprehensive.â€Â  \r\n[3] The outline of coverage must include â€œa description\r\n  of the principal benefits and coverage provided in the policy or contractâ€ as\r\n  well as â€œa statement of the exceptions, reductions, and limitations contained\r\n  in the policy or contract.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-71-550(b) (2) &amp; (3) (2002).\r\n[4] Although the trial court did not address these\r\n  statutes, we find a discussion of the statutes emphasizes the difference\r\n  between a blanket policy and an individual policy and supports our conclusion\r\n  no duty existed to provide the Quicks with the policy.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v.

Abstance, of Barnwell, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Katrina\r\n  P. (Mother) appeals from the family courtâ€™s order terminating her parental\r\n  rights (TPR) to two minor children. Â Mother argues the family court erred in\r\n  finding TPR was in her childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  We disagree.\r\n1.&nbsp; We\r\n  affirm the family courtâ€™s finding the children resided in foster care, under\r\n  the responsibility of the state, for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two\r\n  months.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-1572 (Supp. 2007)[1] (stating the family court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven\r\n  statutory grounds is satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best interest of\r\n  the child); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2007) (explaining one\r\n  statutory ground for TPR is met when â€œ[t]he child has been in foster care under\r\n  the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two\r\n  monthsâ€); Charleston County Depâ€™t of\r\n    Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87,\r\n  101-02, 627 S.E.2d 765, 773 (Ct. App. 2006) (noting the purpose of this\r\n  statutory ground â€œis to ensure children do not languish in foster care when\r\n  termination of parental rights would be in their best interestsâ€). Â \r\n2.&nbsp; Furthermore, despite Motherâ€™s arguments to\r\n  the contrary, we find the family court\r\n  did not err in finding clear and convincing evidence supported a finding that termination\r\n  of Motherâ€™s parental rights is in the best interests of her children. Â S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2007) (explaining if the parentâ€™s and childrenâ€™s\r\n  interests conflict, the childrenâ€™s interests prevail); Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. King, 369 S.C. 96, 105, 631 S.E.2d 239, 244 (2006) (â€œWhen\r\n  reviewing the family court decision, appellate courts may make their own\r\n  conclusions of whether DSS proved by clear and convincing evidence that\r\n  parental rights should be terminated.â€); Jackson, 368\r\n  S.C. at 95, 627 S.E.2d at 770 (stating despite the appellate courtâ€™s broad\r\n  scope of review, it should not necessarily disregard the findings of the family\r\n  court, which was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the\r\n  witnesses and to assign weight to their testimony); S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n  (declaring the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration\r\n  in a TPR case). \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the family court order terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights isÂ Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and HUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The General Assembly amended the Code of Laws of\r\n  South Carolina, effective June 16, 2008, to add Title 63, the South Carolina\r\n  Childrenâ€™s Code, and to transfer all provisions of Title 20, Chapter 7 to Title\r\n  63. &nbsp;See Act No. 361, 2008 S.C. Acts 3623 (stating â€œthe transfer\r\n  and reorganization of the code provisions in this act are technical . . . and\r\n  are not intended to be substantiveâ€). &nbsp;Because Title 63 has not yet been\r\n  bound, all citations to the statute refer to Title 20.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-560","title":"State v.

Rucker, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-567\r\n  Heard September 18, 2008 â€“ Filed October\r\n13, 2008Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRM\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Kenneth Philip Shabel, of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\n      Alexandria Marie Wolf and David Michael Collins, Jr., both of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this divorce action, Richard K. Beach appeals the family courtâ€™s apportionment\r\n  of marital property.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBeach\r\n  and Evelyn Denise Sherbert were married approximately seven years before they\r\n  separated in 2005.Â  Sherbert subsequently filed this action requesting a\r\n  divorce, equitable distribution of marital property, and resumption of the use\r\n  of her maiden name.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court held a final hearing in March 2007.Â  The testimony at the hearing\r\n  focused on the distribution of the coupleâ€™s mobile home and surrounding land.Â \r\n  Sherbert testified both the home and the land were marital property.Â  Beach\r\n  testified the home was nonmarital because it was owned by a third party.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Beach testified the land was nonmarital because he purchased it\r\n  prior to the marriage.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court issued a decree of divorce on March 9, 2007. Â In the\r\n  decree, the family court found the home and land were marital property, with a\r\n  combined value of $16,000. Â The family court awarded Sherbert the mobile\r\n  home and land and ordered Sherbert to pay Beach for his interest, valued at\r\n  $10,000, minus $1,994 to equalize the distribution of personal property. Â \r\nThis\r\n  appeal followed. \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI. Beach first argues the land was nonmarital property\r\n  because he purchased the land prior to the marriage.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  20-7-473 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007)[1] defines marital property as â€œall real and personal property which\r\n  has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of\r\n  the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation.â€Â  The statute,\r\n  however, specifically excludes from marital property, â€œproperty acquired by\r\n  either party before the marriage.â€ It states: â€œThe court does not have jurisdiction or authority to apportion nonmarital property.â€ Â Id.\r\nâ€œFamily court judges have wide discretion in\r\n  determining how marital property is to be distributed.Â  They may use any\r\n  reasonable means to divide the property equitably, and their judgment will not\r\n  be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€ Â Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39, 41-42 (1995). Â Nonmarital property may be transmuted\r\n  into marital property: â€œ(1) if it becomes so commingled with marital property\r\n  as to be untraceable; (2) if it is titled jointly; or (3) if it is utilized by\r\n  the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to\r\n  evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property.â€ Â Johnson v.\r\n    Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Whether transmutation of separate\r\n  property into marital property has occurred â€œis a matter of intent to be\r\n  gleaned from the facts of each case.â€ Â Id. Â \r\nAt the hearing,\r\n  Sherbert testified she helped Beach pay for the land and the roll-back taxes.Â \r\n  In addition, Sherbert and her children helped Beach maintain the yard. Â Sherbert\r\n  and Beach also placed a mobile home on the land after Beachâ€™s mobile home was\r\n  destroyed by fire.Â  They made extensive improvements to the mobile home, and\r\n  affixed the mobile home to the land.Â  They added two bedrooms, a bathroom, a\r\n  living room, and a pitched roof to the mobile home.Â  They also installed a new floor,\r\n  windows, a heating and air conditioning unit, vinyl siding, shutters, and a\r\n  front-door. \r\nAs demonstrated by\r\n  Sherbertâ€™s testimony, the land was transmuted into marital property because it\r\n  was utilized by the parties in support of the marriage in such a manner as to\r\n  evidence an intent to make the land marital property.Â  Both parties\r\n  participated in the purchase of the land, and both parties labored to maintain\r\n  and improve the land.Â  Accordingly, Sherbert met her burden of proof in showing\r\n  the land surrounding the mobile home was transmuted into marital property.Â  \r\nII. Beach argues the mobile home was not â€œoutrightâ€\r\n  maritial property subject to equitable division because the mobile home was\r\n  titled in the name of a third party.Â  Specifically, Beach asserts Jeffrey\r\n  Killian loaned the parties the mobile home after a fire destroyed Beachâ€™s\r\n  mobile home in 2004. Â Â \r\nSection\r\n  20-7-420(A)(19) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007), which was in effect at\r\n  the time of this action,[2] provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    family court has exclusive jurisdiction to . . . bring in and make parties to\r\n    any proceedings pending in the court any person or persons\r\n    . . . whose presence to the proceedings may be found necessary to a complete\r\n    determination of the issues therein, or the relief to which the parties\r\n    thereto, or any of them, may be entitled.\r\n\r\nId.Â  Our supreme court has held â€œwhen property is alleged\r\n  to be marital property, but is owned by a third\r\n  party, the family court has the subject matter jurisdiction to join all persons\r\n  with a possible interest in the property as parties to the action and to\r\n  determine if the property constitutes marital property.â€Â  Sexton v. Sexton,\r\n  298 S.C. 359, 362, 380 S.E.2d 832, 834&nbsp;(1989).\r\nHere, Beach made no attempt to join Killian in the family court\r\n  action; thus, the family court was required to make a determination as to the\r\n  ownership of the mobile home based on the credibility of the parties.Â \r\n  â€œParticularly where evidence is disputed, we normally adhere to findings of the\r\n  trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a superior position to\r\n  judge their credibility.â€Â  Hough v. Hough,&nbsp; 312 S.C. 344, 351, 440\r\n  S.E.2d 387, 391&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994).Â Â Â  \r\nSherbert\r\n  testified she and Beach owned the property, as evidenced by a bill of sale,\r\n  signed by Killian, transferring title of the mobile home to Sherbert and Beach.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the family courtâ€™s finding the mobile home was\r\n  marital property subject to division between the parties.\r\nIII. Finally, Beach argues the family courtâ€™s division of\r\n  marital property was not supported by required statutory considerations.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  issue is not preserved for review because Beach is raising this issue for the\r\n  first time on appeal.Â  Generally, an issue may not be raised for the first time\r\n  on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the court below to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review.

Ismail, 304 S.C. 56,\r\n  58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding an issue not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant\r\n  fails to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the judgment on that\r\n  ground). \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This section was repealed\r\n  and renumbered as section 20-3-630.

Rochelle Y. Williamson, Family Court\r\n  Judge\r\nOpinion No. 2008-UP-581\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2008 â€“ Filed October\r\n  15, 2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDavid Michael Collins, Jr., and John C. Williams, Jr., both of Spartanburg, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tRichard H. Rhodes, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This\r\n  appeal arises after the family court required Randy Smith (Husband) pay\r\n  fourteen percent of his military retirement pension to his ex-wife, Lucinda\r\n  Smith (Wife).Â  Husband argues the family court erred 1) by modifying its prior\r\n  order which equitably divided the partiesâ€™ marital assets and debts including a\r\n  portion of his military retirement; 2) in modifying its prior order without\r\n  taking testimony or receiving any evidence from the parties; 3) in awarding Wife\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees without taking any testimony or receiving any evidence on the\r\n  issue or making any findings of fact or conclusions of law.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.Â  The family court did not\r\n  err in requiring Husband to pay Wife fourteen percent of his military\r\n  retirement.Â  Specifically, we find the family court retained jurisdiction over the\r\n  case for the purpose of signing and filing aÂ  Qualified Domestic Relations\r\n  Order (QDRO), and in ordering Husband to pay fourteen percent of his military\r\n  retirement, the family court was merely enforcing, not modifying, its prior\r\n  order.Â  See Cannon v. Cannon, 275 S.C. 424, 425, 272 S.E.2d 179,\r\n  179-80 (1980) (holding the family court had authority to enforce its previous order,\r\n  and the petition from which the new order arose was â€œmerely a means of\r\n  obtaining enforcement, rather than modification, of the original\r\n  decree.â€) (emphasis added); Dale v. Dale, 341 S.C. 516, 521, 534 S.E.2d\r\n  705, 707 (Ct. App. 2000) (affirming family courtâ€™s finding husband in contempt\r\n  where husband clearly violated an equitable apportionment decree); Burns v.\r\n    Burns, 323 S.C. 45, 48-49, 448 S.E.2d 571, 573 (Ct. App. 1994), affâ€™d, 314\r\n  S.C. 445, 445 S.E.2d 449 (1994) Â (finding the family court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in holding husband in contempt of court for failure to honor\r\n  settlement agreement provisions to pay credit card indebtedness of parties and\r\n  second mortgage).Â  We further find no testimony or additional evidence beyond\r\n  the pleading was required because in Husbandâ€™s answer and counterclaim, he\r\n  admitted retiring from military service on December 31, 2004, and thereafter\r\n  receiving $1,708.00 in monthly retirement.Â  See Ball v. Ball, 312\r\n  S.C. 31, 430 S.E.2d 533 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding non-vested, unvalued military\r\n  pensions are marital property).Â Â Â  \r\n2.Â  We find no error in the\r\n  family courtâ€™s order requiring Husband pay $500 of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees where\r\n  Husband failed to comply with\r\n  the family courtâ€™s initial order\r\n  requiring he file a QDRO and did not pay Wife any portion of his retirement\r\n  pension beginning in January of 2005.Â  In order to receive her portion of\r\n  Husbandâ€™s retirement, Wife was forced to bring an action and received\r\n  beneficial results.Â  Furthermore, Husbandâ€™s current financial situation allows\r\n  him to pay $500 in Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees given he receives $1,708.00 in\r\n  monthly retirement.Â  Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646-47, 506\r\n  S.E.2d 526, 535 (Ct.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka,\r\n  Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy,\r\n  III, Â of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â A\r\n  jury convicted Joshua Jeter of murder, attempted burglary in the first degree,\r\n  armed robbery, and possession of a pistol by a person under the age of twenty-one.Â \r\n  The charges against Jeter arose from a shooting death on December 8, 2004.Â  Lance\r\n  Lyles, Jeterâ€™s co-defendant, was tried with Jeter and convicted of similar\r\n  offenses.[1]Â \r\n  Jeter appeals, arguing the trial judge erred in (1) refusing to allow him to\r\n  present corroborating evidence of drug activity in which the victims were\r\n  allegedly involved, and (2) failing to direct a verdict in his favor on the\r\n  murder charge.Â  We affirm.\r\n1.Â  Jeter first\r\n  argues the trial judge committed reversible error in granting the Stateâ€™s\r\n  motion in limine to prevent him from presenting evidence other\r\n  than his own testimony suggesting the victims were engaged in drug activity and\r\n  from mentioning such evidence during his opening argument.Â  The disputed\r\n  evidence included (1) testimony from a former neighbor of the victims that several\r\n  months before the incident someone coming from the apartment where the shooting\r\n  took place approached him about buying drugs, and (2) testimony that material\r\n  in a partially smoked cigarette found near the murder victimâ€™s body tested\r\n  positive for marijuana.Â  Jeter argues on appeal that these witnessesâ€™\r\n  statements were essential to his defense in that they corroborated his own testimony\r\n  that he went to the victimsâ€™ apartment complex on the day of the incident to\r\n  purchase drugs from the victims. Â The trial judge, however, refused to admit\r\n  either statement, noting that the witness who allegedly had been offered a\r\n  chance to buy drugs could not identify the individual who approached him and\r\n  also that neither statement was relevant to the issues in the case. Â We agree.Â  See State v. Lyles, ___ S.C. ___, 665 S.E.2d 201, 207 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008) (affirming the appeal of Jeterâ€™s co-defendant and noting that the\r\n  disputed testimony, even if factually correct, â€œdoes not serve as a defense to\r\n  any of the offenses charged in this case nor does it excuse or mitigate Lylesâ€™\r\n  actionsâ€). Â We further uphold the trial judgeâ€™s exclusion of the disputed\r\n  statements on the ground that they would have been unduly prejudicial to the\r\n  State. Â See Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.S. 319, 326 (2006)\r\n  (holding that although a defendant has a constitutional right to present a\r\n  complete defense, â€œwell-established rules of evidence permit trial judges to\r\n  exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by other factors, such as\r\n  unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the juryâ€); State\r\n    v. Frazier, 357 S.C. 161, 165, 592 S.E.2d 621, 623 (2004) (stating a trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s admission or rejection of evidence is generally reviewed for an abuse\r\n  of discretion); Lyles, ___ S.C. at ___, 665 S.E.2d at 207 (â€œBy\r\n  potentially insinuating a key witness for the State is a drug dealer and drugs\r\n  were present next to the victim, the testimony could impugn the character of\r\n  [the victims] and cloud the issues.â€).\r\n2.Â  Jeter also\r\n  argues he was entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal on the murder charge,\r\n  arguing (1) there was no evidence that he acted with malice aforethought; and (2)\r\n  testimony form his co-defendant implicating him as the more culpable of the two\r\n  was not substantial circumstantial evidence of his guilt.Â  We reject these\r\n  arguments.Â  At trial, Jeter did not dispute that he had accompanied Lyles to\r\n  the apartment where the shooting took place, and the Stateâ€™s chief eyewitness\r\n  testified at length about Jeterâ€™s participation at the scene.Â  We therefore\r\n  hold the State presented both direct as well as substantial circumstantial\r\n  evidence on which the jury could convict Jeter of murder.Â  See State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292-93, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006)\r\n  (stating that when reviewing the denial of a directed verdict motion, the\r\n  appellate court views the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light\r\n  most favorable to the State, and, if there is any direct or substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused,\r\n  the court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury); State v.\r\n    Crowe, 258 S.C. 258, 265, 188 S.E.2d 379, 382 (1972) (â€œ[I]f two or more combine together to commit an unlawful\r\n  act, such as robbery, and, in the execution of that criminal act, a homicide is\r\n  committed by one of the actors, as a probable or natural consequence of the\r\n  acts done in pursuance of the common design, all present participating in the\r\n  unlawful undertaking are as guilty as the one who committed the fatal act.â€).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, THOMAS,\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  This Court recently affirmed Lylesâ€™s convictions,\r\n  rejecting similar arguments concerning evidence of drug activity at the\r\n  location of the incident.Â  State v.

Robin Alley, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Philip E. Wright, of Lancaster, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Following separate hearings on liability and damages,\r\n  the family court held Clara M. Steele (Wife) in contempt for killing the plants surrounding the marital\r\n  home following the partiesâ€™ divorce.Â  Wife now appeals the family courtâ€™s order requiring her to pay David E. Steele (Husband) $45,759.90 in\r\n  damages and an additional $1,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.Â  Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were divorced on April 3, 2003.Â  They later\r\n  entered into a property settlement agreement in which Husband agreed pay Wife\r\n  $5,000 for moving expenses, $45,000 by May 15, 2003, and an additional $40,000\r\n  by April 1, 2007.Â  Wife agreed to vacate the marital home by April 15, 2003.Â  Under\r\n  this settlement agreement, each party promised not to â€œdestroy or damage any\r\n  real or personal property of the other party.â€Â  The family court adopted and\r\n  incorporated this agreement into its order dated March 28, 2003, concerning\r\n  property division.Â  Wife held exclusive physical possession of the marital home\r\n  until she vacated the home on April 15, 2003.Â  Shortly after Husband moved into\r\n  the home on April 16, 2003, he observed signs of damage or disease in the\r\n  plants and trees near the house.[1]Â \r\n  Within thirteen days, many of the plants around the house were dead or dying.Â  Â Â \r\nHusband brought a contempt action against Wife, alleging she had\r\n  damaged and destroyed plants, shrubs, and trees around the marital home, and\r\n  requesting the family court permit him to withhold the $45,000 payment until\r\n  the contempt action had been heard.Â  The family court granted his request to\r\n  withhold payment and heard the contempt action on June 9, 2003.Â  Husband\r\n  testified he believed Wife had applied an unknown biological agent to the\r\n  soil.Â  To test this theory, Husband planted new plants in the contaminated soil\r\n  to see if they would survive.Â  The new plants died almost immediately.Â  Husband\r\n  also engaged other landscapers to help him document the damage and estimate the\r\n  cost of repair. Â Â Â Â \r\nAfter a hearing, the family court held Wife in contempt, awarded\r\n  Husband $1,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees incurred in prosecuting the contempt action,\r\n  and ordered Husband to engage the services of a licensed contractor to return\r\n  the property as close as possible to its previous condition.Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  family court ordered Wife to bear the cost of removing any contaminated soil\r\n  and replacing all the plants that were destroyed.Â  Both the cost of restoring\r\n  the property and the attorneyâ€™s fees were to be deducted from the $45,000\r\n  Husband owed Wife.Â  Â Â \r\nWife subsequently moved for reconsideration.Â  The family court amended\r\n  the damages provision of the contempt order to require each party to obtain an\r\n  estimate for removing the soil and replacing the plants and to attempt to come\r\n  to an agreement on the cost of restoring the property.[2]Â  Both parties obtained estimates, but\r\n  they were unable to agree upon cost. \r\nOn February 26, 2007, the family court heard testimony to determine\r\n  the measure of damages.Â  Wife presented an estimate of approximately $6,000,\r\n  which reflected only the cost of planting new plants and trees.Â  Husband\r\n  presented two estimates and an expert.Â  One estimate, for $18,505, covered\r\n  replacing only the plants.Â  The other estimate, for approximately $78,000,\r\n  reflected the costs of excavating, removing, disposing of, and replacing the\r\n  contaminated soil; removing the dead plants and trees; and installing mature\r\n  plants and trees the approximate sizes of those that died.Â  Husband also sought\r\n  an additional $1,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees incurred since the first hearing.Â  The\r\n  family court awarded Husband $45,759.90 in damages and the additional $1,500 in\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees, all to be deducted from the monies Husband owed Wife.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Measure of\r\n  Damages\r\nWife\r\n  asserts the family court erred in using the cost of restoring the land as close\r\n  as possible to its original condition to determine the amount of damages, when\r\n  that cost was disproportionate to the diminution in value of the land.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find\r\n  the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Ex Parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649,\r\n  652&nbsp;(2006).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require the\r\n  appellate court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Wooten v.\r\n    Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102&nbsp;(2005).Â  Neither is the\r\n  appellate court required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\n  assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Latimer v. Farmer, 360\r\n  S.C. 375, 380, 602 S.E.2d 32, 34&nbsp;(2004).Â  â€œ[B]ecause the family court is\r\n  in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its\r\n  findings should be given broad discretion.â€Â  Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206,\r\n  211-12, 634 S.E.2d 51, 54&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).\r\nGenerally,\r\n  a court may measure damages to property by determining the cost of restoring\r\n  damaged or destroyed trees, shrubs, and other vegetation.Â  Restatement (Second)\r\n  of Torts Â§ 929(1)(a) (1979).Â  If the restoration cost is disproportionate to\r\n  the diminution in value of the land, the proper measure of damages is the lost\r\n  value of the land, unless the owner has a personal reason for restoration.Â  Id. at cmt. b.Â  Â \r\nOur\r\n  supreme court has found the Restatementâ€™s reasoning persuasive in measuring\r\n  damages when noncommercial trees, shrubs, and related vegetation have been\r\n  destroyed:Â  \r\n\r\n\tWe\r\n  adopt the following as the measure of damages: Â The general measure of damages\r\n  for damaged/destroyed noncommercial trees, shrubs, and related vegetation is\r\n  the difference in the value of the entire parcel of land-damaged and undamaged\r\n  portions-immediately before and after the loss. Â When the property is\r\n  restorable to its former condition at a cost less than the diminution in value,\r\n  then the cost of restoration that has been or may be reasonably incurred or the\r\n  diminution in value may be the proper measure of damages. Â When\r\n    the cost of restoration exceeds the diminution in value, then the greater cost\r\n    of restoration will be allowed when the landowner has a personal reason\r\n    relating to the land for restoring the land to its original condition and when\r\n    the cost of restoration is reasonable in relation to the damage inflicted.Â \r\n    However, the landowner may not recover restoration costs which exceed the\r\n    market value of the entire parcel prior to the loss. Â Further, the jury may\r\n  consider factors in determining the diminution in value, including but not\r\n  limited to: the types and sizes of the damaged or destroyed trees and shrubs,\r\n  the purpose for which the destroyed or damaged trees and shrubs were grown or\r\n  maintained, the reasonable and practicable replacement costs, and the use of\r\n  the particular land, including any aesthetic value to the landowners of such\r\n  trees and shrubs. \r\n\r\nVaught v. A.O. Hardee\r\n  &amp; Sons, Inc., 366 S.C. 475, 484, 623\r\n  S.E.2d 373, 377-78 (2005) (emphasis added) (internal cites omitted).Â  \r\nHusband,\r\n  a landscaper by trade, testified he and Wife had planted numerous plants around\r\n  the marital home in an effort â€œto make it look nice.â€Â  Some of the trees around\r\n  the home were mature, providing shade and measuring twelve inches in diameter\r\n  when they were killed.Â  Husband testified he â€œdid all the major plantingâ€\r\n  because Wifeâ€™s medical conditions prevented her from doing it.Â  The family\r\n  court observed Wifeâ€™s sister and cousin testified at trial Wife stated if\r\n  Husband received the house in the divorce, she would kill these landscaping\r\n  improvements so Husband and his girlfriend â€œwould not be able to enjoy the\r\n  house.â€Â  The family court found these witnesses more credible than Wifeâ€™s\r\n  witnesses, who testified they had not heard these statements and Wife would not\r\n  have confided in Husbandâ€™s witnesses.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the family court the destruction of these plants and trees was\r\n  â€œvicious, vindictive, and designed to deny [Husband] and his intended wife\r\n  quiet enjoyment of the house.â€Â  Furthermore, Husbandâ€™s desire to restore the\r\n  landscaping he personally labored to create around his home constitutes â€œa personal\r\n  reason relating to the land for restoring the land to its original condition.â€Â  See Vaught, 366 S.C. at 484, 623 S.E.2d at 378.Â  Husband\r\n  testified the house and surrounding two acres where the landscaping was located\r\n  were worth approximately $160,000.Â  Under Vaught, Husband is entitled to\r\n  a reasonable damages award of less than $160,000.Â  The family courtâ€™s award of\r\n  $45,759.90 does not exceed this amount and reflects the reasonable cost of\r\n  returning the land to its pre-injury condition.Â  Therefore, the family court\r\n  did not err in awarding Husband damages based on the cost of restoring the lost\r\n  plants and trees.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Speculative\r\n  Damages\r\nWife asserts the\r\n  family court erred in awarding damages\r\n  that were speculative in nature.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  trial court is vested with considerable discretion over the amount of a damages\r\n  award, and our review of the amount of damages is limited to the correction of\r\n  errors of law. Â In reviewing a damages award, we do not weigh the evidence, but\r\n  determine if any evidence supports the award.\r\n\r\nVortex Sports &amp;\r\n  Entertainment, Inc. v. Ware, 378 S.C.\r\n  197, 208, 662 S.E.2d 444, 450 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  \r\nAt the family\r\n  courtâ€™s behest, both Husband and Wife obtained professional estimates of the\r\n  cost to repair the landscaping damage.Â  Because each party interpreted the degree of damage to its own\r\n  advantage, the estimated repair costs differed considerably.Â  Wife contemplated\r\n  replacing only the plants and presented an estimate of approximately $6,000.Â \r\n  Conversely, Husband sought to return the landscaped area to its pre-injury\r\n  state and presented both expert testimony and two estimates.Â  His expertâ€™s\r\n  estimate, which included removing, disposing of, and replacing the contaminated\r\n  soil, was approximately $78,000.[3]Â \r\n  His written estimate for plant replacement, only, totaled $18,505.Â  The family\r\n  court ultimately awarded Husband $45,759.90 in damages, which is well within\r\n  the range of costs established by the written and testimonial evidence.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the family court itemized the components of this award in its\r\n  final order, and the estimates and testimony support the individual amounts.Â \r\n  Because the evidence supports the family courtâ€™s award of damages, the award is\r\n  not based upon speculative evidence, and the family court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife\r\n  asserts the family court erred in awarding Husband an additional $1,500 in\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court has jurisdiction to award reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees where a claim\r\n  for attorneyâ€™s fees is well-founded.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-3-120 through -140,\r\n  Â§ 20-7-420(38) (Supp. 2007).Â  In a family court matter, â€œ[t]he award of\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees . . . will only be disturbed upon a showing of abuse of\r\n  discretion.â€Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648\r\n  (2006).Â  â€œA decision lacking a discernible reason is arbitrary and constitutes\r\n  an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 304, 372\r\n  S.E.2d 107, 115 (Ct. App. 1988).Â \r\nWife\r\n  asserts the family court erred solely because it had already awarded Husband\r\n  $1,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and any further award is barred by the doctrine of\r\n  res judicata.Â  A party asserting res judicata must show: â€œ(1) identity of the\r\n  parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication of the issue\r\n  on the merits in the former suit by a court of competent jurisdiction.â€Â  Duckett\r\n    v. Goforth, 374 S.C. 446, 465, 649 S.E.2d 72, 82 (Ct App. 2007) (emphasis omitted).Â \r\n  Although the parties to this award of attorneyâ€™s fees are the same, the subject\r\n  matter is not.Â  On June 16, 2003, the family court awarded Husband $1,000 in\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees incurred in his action to determine Wifeâ€™s liability for the\r\n  loss of the plants and trees.Â  The attorneyâ€™s fees now at issue were awarded on\r\n  March 31, 2007, nearly four years later.Â  By this time, Husband had incurred\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees for the damages portion of his action, which included a lengthy\r\n  hearing at which Husbandâ€™s counsel examined or cross-examined Husband, Wife, an\r\n  expert, and a witness.Â  Because the family courtâ€™s second award of attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees occurred after Husband incurred additional expense to prosecute a\r\n  different aspect of his claim, res judicata does not apply.Â  Therefore, no\r\n  double recovery occurred, and the family court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  awarding Husband an additional $1,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs\r\n  to the issue of the proper measure of damages, we find the years of care and\r\n  personal labor Husband invested in the landscaping surrounding the marital home\r\n  constitute a personal reason for restoring the landscaping to its pre-injury\r\n  condition.Â  We further find the amount of damages ordered by the family court\r\n  was reasonable and did not exceed the value of the land.Â  Therefore, the family\r\n  court did not err in measuring damages using the actual cost of restoration\r\n  rather than the diminution in overall value of the land.[4]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm the order of the family court on this issue.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the issue of speculative damages, we find the professional estimates\r\n  submitted into evidence by the parties support the family courtâ€™s determination\r\n  of damages.Â  The damages are not speculative.Â  Therefore, we affirm the order\r\n  of the family court on this issue.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  as to the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees, we find the doctrine of res judicata does\r\n  not bar a supplemental award of attorneyâ€™s fees because the supplemental award\r\n  was based on additional work completed and additional fees incurred after the\r\n  initial award.Â  Consequently, we affirm the order of the family court on this\r\n  issue.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nHUFF and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Husband\r\n  was a landscaper with a degree in horticulture and a South Carolina pesticide\r\nlicense.Â  Wife was a master gardener with expertise in horticulture.\r\n[2] Wife appealed from this order, and this court\r\n  affirmed the family courtâ€™s determination of liability but remanded for\r\n  determination of damages. Â See Steele v. Steele, 2004-UP-578\r\n(Nov. 17, 2004).Â  \r\n[3] This written estimate does not appear in the record,\r\nbut his expert testified in support of it.Â  \r\n[4] There is no evidence of the difference in value of\r\nthe land before and after the injury to it.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-591","title":"Mungin v.

Darr, Jr., and Carlos C. Johnson, both of Spartanburg, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        Gary W. Poliakoff, of Â Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Spartanburg County School District 7 (the School District) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s grant of Patricia Johnsonâ€™s motion for a\r\n  temporary injunction and the relief sought in her equitable bill of discovery.Â \r\n  We affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order granting the temporary injunction, reverse\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order granting the relief requested in Johnsonâ€™s equitable\r\n  bill of discovery, and remand the matter for a full hearing on the merits.Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nFACTS\r\nJohnson\r\n  is the guardian ad litem for Child,[1] a minor who was allegedly the victim of a sexual assault on a school bus in\r\n  September 2006.Â  On April 16, 2007, Johnson filed a summons and complaint\r\n  seeking an equitable bill of discovery and a temporary injunction.Â  Johnson\r\n  asked the circuit court to order the School District to maintain, preserve, and\r\n  produce certain items and information relating to the incident and to refrain\r\n  from moving, removing, or modifying any such items and information.Â  Johnson\r\n  contended the School District had conducted an investigation, including taking\r\n  witness statements and gathering other information, following the incident.Â \r\n  Johnson, therefore, wanted any information or evidence the School District had\r\n  gathered to be preserved so she could determine whether any potential civil\r\n  causes of action existed, identify all potential defendants, and potentially\r\n  proceed with any civil matters related to the incident.Â  The summons stated the\r\n  School District had thirty days to file its answer.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  April 19, 2007, the circuit court issued an Order and Rule to Show Cause, directing\r\n  the School District to appear on May 9, 2007, and show cause as to why the\r\n  relief requested should not be granted.Â  The circuit court stated:Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  [I]t\r\n    would be prudent and proper to [o]rder [the School District] to maintain the\r\n    evidence referenced in [Johnsonâ€™s] [c]omplaint ([f]or [e]quitable [b]ill [of]\r\n    [d]iscovery), in a safe place and to refrain and restrain from moving it,\r\n    removing it and/or making any modifications to this evidence, along with any\r\n    other items or materials that might potentially be considered as evidence in\r\n    any possible civil litigation, until the hearing in this matter . . . .\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  School District appeared at the hearing but argued the circuit court lacked\r\n  personal jurisdiction to rule in the matter because the thirty days in which\r\n  the School District could respond to either the summons and complaint or the\r\n  Rule to Show Cause had yet to expire.Â  The circuit court disagreed with the School Districtâ€™s argument and proceeded with the hearing.[2]Â Â Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the close of the hearing, the circuit court stated it would allow Johnson to\r\n  proceed with discovery.Â  The circuit court finalized this decision by order on\r\n  July 17, 2007.Â  This order specified the discovery Johnson could move\r\n  forward with and granted Johnsonâ€™s request for an injunction.Â  Specifically,\r\n  the circuit court ordered the School District to preserve and maintain the\r\n  evidence referenced in Johnsonâ€™s complaint for equitable bill of discovery,\r\n  along with any other items or materials that might be potentially considered as\r\n  evidence in the possible civil litigation.Â  The circuit court acknowledged\r\n  Johnson was requesting evidence before any suit had been filed and that Johnson\r\n  was not asking the circuit court to bind any defendant to any judgment.Â  The\r\n  circuit court concluded the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and\r\n  relevant case law provided for reasonable pre-suit discovery and for\r\n  preservation of evidence.Â  The circuit court noted, if a party were to sue\r\n  without grounds, that party could face court-imposed penalties as well as\r\n  liability for a groundless action.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn\r\n  July 20, 2007, the School District filed a Motion to Reconsider and Amend,\r\n  which the circuit court denied.Â  This appeal follows.Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œActions\r\n  for injunctive relief are equitable in nature.â€Â  Shaw v. Coleman, 373\r\n  S.C. 485, 492, 645 S.E.2d 252, 256 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  When reviewing actions in\r\n  equity, this Court may â€œcorrect errors of law and may find facts in accordance\r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Blackmon v. Weaver,\r\n  366 S.C. 245, 249, 621 S.E.2d 42, 44 (Ct. App. 2005).Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe School District argues the circuit court erroneously granted Johnsonâ€™s request for a\r\n  temporary injunction because she failed to demonstrate two of the requirements\r\n  for a temporary injunction: (1) the likelihood of success on the merits and (2)\r\n  an inadequate remedy at law.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  granting of a temporary injunction rests in the discretion of the trial court.Â  Powell v. Immanuel Baptist Church, 261 S.C. 219, 221, 199 S.E.2d 60, 61\r\n  (1973).Â  The sole purpose for granting a temporary injunction is to preserve\r\n  status quo in order to avoid possible irreparable injury to a party.Â  Id.Â  To establish a cause of action for a temporary injunction, a party must\r\n  demonstrate (1) irreparable harm will be suffered if the injunction is not\r\n  granted, (2) success on the merits is likely, and (3) the remedy at law is\r\n  inadequate.Â  Peek v. Spartanburg Regâ€™l Healthcare Sys., 367 S.C. 450,\r\n  454-55, 626 S.E.2d 34, 36 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the hearing, Johnson argued she would likely succeed on the merits of the case\r\n  because the South Carolina Supreme Court has stated an equitable bill of\r\n  discovery is an independent civil action used to proceed with the discovery\r\n  process when the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provide no other\r\n  mechanism for doing so.Â  Wofford v. Ethyl Corp., 316 S.C. 75, 77, 447\r\n  S.E.2d 187, 189 (1994).Â  Further, Johnson argued if the evidence gathered for\r\n  this case was not preserved, she would suffer immediate and irreparable injury\r\n  by not being able to examine the evidence or pursue a valid civil action,\r\n  leaving her with no legal remedy.Â  We find there to be a sufficient showing to\r\n  support the circuit courtâ€™s decision to grant the temporary injunction and,\r\n  consequently, no abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nThe School District also argues the circuit court erroneously determined the merits of the case\r\n  at the hearing on May 9, 2007, because the Rule to Show Cause did not contain\r\n  the essential elements of a summons, and thus, the circuit court did not have\r\n  proper personal jurisdiction to grant the relief requested by Johnson.Â  While\r\n  we find the circuit court had personal jurisdiction to hear the matter because\r\n  the motion for a temporary injunction was before it, we agree that the circuit\r\n  court erroneously decided the merits of the case.\r\nAlthough\r\n  a court may consider the merits of a case to the extent necessary to determine\r\n  whether a temporary injunction should be issued, it is improper for a court to\r\n  make a final determination on the merits of a case at the hearing for a\r\n  temporary injunction.Â  Roberts v. Union County Bd. of Sch. Trs., 284\r\n  S.C. 299, 301, 326 S.E.2d 163, 164 (Ct. App. 1985); see also Helsel\r\n    v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C. 29, 32, 413 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1992) (â€œWhen\r\n  a court is requested to issue a temporary injunction it may consider the merits\r\n  of a case to the extent necessary to determine whether a temporary injunction\r\n  is appropriate.â€).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  the current case, the circuit court scheduled a hearing on May 9, 2007,\r\n  ordering the School District to appear and show cause as to why Johnsonâ€™s\r\n  request for temporary relief should not be granted pending a hearing on the\r\n  merits.Â  At the hearing, the circuit court granted Johnsonâ€™s motion for a temporary\r\n  injunction and allowed her to proceed with discovery.Â  By allowing discovery to\r\n  move forward, the circuit court granted Johnson the relief requested in her equitable\r\n  bill of discovery and, thus, decided the merits of the case.Â  As stated, it is\r\n  improper for a court to make a final determination on the merits of a case upon\r\n  a hearing to determine whether a party is entitled to a temporary injunction,\r\n  and therefore, the circuit court erred in deciding whether Johnson was entitled\r\n  to the relief requested in her equitable bill of discovery.Â  See Roberts,\r\n  284 S.C. at 301, 326 S.E.2d at 164 (finding the circuit court should not decide\r\n  the merits of a case at a hearing regarding entitlement to a temporary\r\n  injunction).Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order is reversed and the matter\r\n  is remanded for a full hearing on the merits.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  light of our decision on these issues, we need not address the remaining\r\n  arguments on appeal.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (finding when a\r\n  decision of one issue is dispositive, it is not necessary to decide remaining\r\n  issues on appeal).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\nWILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â The name of the minor child has been changed to\r\nprotect the minor childâ€™s identity.Â  \r\n[2] On May 21, 2007, the School District filed its answer\r\nto Johnsonâ€™s summons and complaint.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-601","title":"State v.
