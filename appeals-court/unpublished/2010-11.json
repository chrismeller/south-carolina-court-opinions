Hudgins, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott,\r\n  and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Christina J. Catoe, all of Columbia; and\r\n  Solicitor Scarlett Anne Wilson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Geronimo\r\n  Morisset appeals his conviction for possession\r\n  with intent to distribute cocaine base crack, trafficking cocaine in excess of\r\n  ten grams but less than twenty-eight grams, and possession of a firearm during\r\n  the commission of a violent crime. Â On appeal, Morisset contends the trial\r\n  court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because the State\r\n  failed to prove Morisset exercised dominion and control over the area where the\r\n  drugs were found.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina courts have &quot;repeatedly recognized that a\r\n  conviction for possession of contraband drugs requires proof of actual or\r\n  constructive possession, coupled with knowledge of the presence of the drugs.&quot;Â  State v. Halyard, 274 S.C. 397, 400,\r\n  264 S.E.2d 841, 842 (1980).Â  &quot;Constructive\r\n  possession occurs when the person charged with possession has dominion and\r\n  control over either the drugs or the premises upon which the drugs were found.&quot;Â  State v. Mollison, 319 S.C. 41, 45, 459 S.E.2d 88, 91 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  &quot;Such\r\n  possession may be established by circumstantial as well as direct evidence.&quot;\r\n  Â Halyard, 274 S.C. at 400, 264 S.E.2d at 842.Â  &quot;When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial\r\n  court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its\r\n  weight.&quot; Â State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648\r\n  (2006).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State produced evidence of Morisset's dominion and control over the entire\r\n  residence where the drugs and gun were found: Morisset was the only resident present\r\n  at the time of the search, police found paperwork associating Morisset to the\r\n  residence in the living room and bedroom, and police found Morisset's GED\r\n  certificate displayed on the living room wall.Â  The Record also revealed drugs as\r\n  well as drug manufacturing and distribution materials in the residence.Â  Thus,\r\n  viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence\r\n  supported submitting the case to the jury.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-477","title":"State v.

Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  Brian Amburgey appeals the revocation of thirty days of his probationary\r\n  sentence, arguing the circuit court erred in finding he had impermissible\r\n  contact with a child under the age of eighteen.Â  We reverse[1] because the evidence adduced at the hearing does not support a\r\n  finding that Amburgey violated a condition of his probation.Â  \r\n&quot;This\r\n  court will not disturb the circuit court's decision to revoke probation unless\r\n  the decision was influenced by an error of law, was without evidentiary\r\n  support, or constituted an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State v. Archie, 322\r\n  S.C. 135, 136-37, 470 S.E.2d 380, 381 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In a probation\r\n  revocation matter, the circuit court may abuse its discretion by entering an\r\n  arbitrary judgment, allowing its decision to be controlled by an error of law,\r\n  or failing to consider the particular circumstances of the case and whether the\r\n  evidence supports its decision.Â  State v. White, 218 S.C. 130, 135-37,\r\n  61 S.E.2d 754, 756-59 (1950).Â  Appellate courts are bound by the circuit\r\n  court's factual findings unless the findings are clearly erroneous. Â State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  \r\nAmburgey's\r\n  probation was conditioned upon his &quot;not hav[ing] contact with a person\r\n  under the age of 18&quot; who was not a male blood-relative.Â  This condition specifically\r\n  addressed incidental contact: &quot;If I have incidental contact with any\r\n  child, I will be civil and courteous and immediately remove myself from the\r\n  situation.Â  I will discuss the contact at my next treatment session and will\r\n  immediately report this contact to my agent.&quot;Â  The record supports\r\n  Amburgey's contention that he was unaware the child was in his home and\r\n  therefore was unable to exercise control over his proximity to the child.Â  The\r\n  child's mother testified her visit with her sister lasted approximately ten\r\n  minutes.Â  Both the child's mother and the probation agent testified Amburgey\r\n  entered the room where the child stood only after the probation agent arrived.Â \r\n  Until that time, the child's mother stated, Amburgey remained in his bedroom,\r\n  and she and her child remained in the living room.Â  Accordingly, we find no\r\n  evidence supports the circuit court's finding that Amburgey violated the terms\r\n  of his probation.Â  No evidence indicates Amburgey invited the child or his\r\n  mother to his residence or even knew they were coming.Â  No evidence indicated\r\n  Amburgey's girlfriend was aware her sister and the child would come to the home.Â \r\n  No evidence indicated the child's mother was aware of Amburgey's restriction\r\n  before his probation agent informed her.Â  Furthermore, the child's presence in\r\n  Amburgey's residence was &quot;really the only violation&quot; the probation\r\n  agent found.Â  Consequently, we find the circuit court erred in revoking thirty\r\n  days of Amburgey's probation.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-497","title":"Outlaw v.

Barkley approached the vehicle, and\r\n  it appeared something was exchanged between the men.Â Â Â  When the officers ran\r\n  the tag on the Nissan, it came back as belonging to a Volvo.Â  After\r\n  Barno pulled away, the officers followed behind and initiated a traffic stop.Â \r\n  When asked for his driver's license, appellant indicated he did not have one.Â  Barno\r\n  was then detained and read his Miranda[2] rights.Â  The officers then noticed a white rock substance in plain view in the\r\n  front seat of the car that tested positive for crack cocaine.Â  When one of the\r\n  officers asked whose crack it was, appellant stated it was his.Â  Later, while\r\n  being booked into the detention center, a small baggy of marijuana was found in\r\n  Barno's pants pocket. \r\nAt the close of the evidence,\r\n  the trial judge indicated his intent to charge that possession may be inferred\r\n  when a substance is found on property under the control of the defendant, and\r\n  that such inference is simply an evidentiary fact to be considered by the\r\n  jury.Â  Barno objected to the proposed charge, arguing an instruction including\r\n  the word &quot;inferred or inference&quot; would be burden shifting, would\r\n  create a comment on the facts, and would deny him due process.Â  Specifically, trial\r\n  counsel argued as follows:\r\n\r\n  - - if it's the court's intention to use the\r\n    word inferred or inference at any place in your charge, I'm going to\r\n    respectfully object and ask that you do not do that feeling that any time\r\n      the Court gives the jury an instruction as to inference, that that we would\r\n    argue is respectfullyÂ  - - I know it's often done generally done in some cases,\r\n    but we would respectfully urge the Court to find that that is burden\r\n      shifting, that that is creating a comment on the facts by the bench which\r\n    is not permitted under the rules, and that ultimately it's a denial of due\r\n    process and that it's violative of the constitutional right to a fundamentally\r\n    fair trial.\r\n  In that, Your Honor, if they're told that they\r\n    may infer something by anything, then why is that not a comment on the facts?Â \r\n    I mean, the general nature of the violation of the contraband statute, they\r\n    have got that.\r\n  Why is it we're telling them that they can\r\n    find something if they find something else or that - - that we feel - - any\r\n      time the word inference is used but may be inferred, that phrase, we feel\r\n    that that's burden shifting and improper comment on the facts and denial\r\n    of due process.Â  \r\n  And we urge the Court not to do that and let\r\n    you know that it would be our intention to respectfully except should the Court\r\n    choose to do that.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  The trial judge then replied:\r\n\r\n  And it's under State v. Adams, 291 SC\r\n    130, it is exactly where that language comes from.Â  It is in every charge book\r\n    in every Judge in the State of South Carolina dealing with possession of crack\r\n    cocaine as well as possession of marijuana.\r\n  But it - - it does not comment on the facts in\r\n    my opinion.Â  It simply it is the law in this State.Â  And it simply says that a\r\n    knowledge - - and possession may be inferred when the substance is found on the\r\n    property under the defendant's control.Â  However, this inference is simply an\r\n    evidentiary fact to be taken by you.\r\n  I think that is the law.Â  And I'm going to\r\n    charge it formally, but I note your objection.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge then charged as he indicated, stating as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    defendant's knowledge and possession may be inferred when . . . a substance is\r\n    found on the property under the defendant's control.\r\n  However,\r\n    this inference is simply an evidentiary fact to be taken into consideration by\r\n    you along with the other evidence in this case and to give the weight you\r\n    decide it should have.\r\n\r\nTrail counsel excepted to this instruction as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  The third exception, Your Honor, would be inference.Â  You did use the word.Â  I think it was in the context of something to be\r\n    inferred from control of the premises on which the drugs were found.Â  So I\r\n    respectfully except to that as being burden shifting for those reasons I told\r\n    you before the break.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  The trial\r\n  judge declined to recharge on the matter, determining the inference instruction\r\n  was the law of this state.Â  After deliberations began, the jury sent a note\r\n  asking whether the defendant had &quot;to know that the drugs were in the car\r\n  to be guilty&quot; and what the court meant &quot;by possession.&quot;Â  The\r\n  trial judge recharged the jury that the State was required to prove beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly and intelligently possessed the\r\n  drugs, that to prove possession, the State was required to prove beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt that the defendant had the power and intent to control the\r\n  disposition of the drugs, and that &quot;defendant's knowledge and possession\r\n  may be inferred when a substance is found on the property under the defendant's\r\n  control&quot; but this inference was simply an evidentiary fact to be\r\n  considered along with the other evidence and &quot;to be given whatever weight\r\n  [the jury] decide[d] it should have.&quot;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Barno contends\r\n  that the law provides, in order for an inference to be considered permissive,\r\n  the jury must be instructed they are free to accept or reject the inference.Â  Barno\r\n  asserts, because the trial court failed to specifically instruct the jury they\r\n  could reject the inference, the charge was burden shifting, in violation of his\r\n  due process rights.\r\nWe find the issue as argued\r\n  on appeal is not preserved for our review.Â  Although defense counsel objected\r\n  to the proposed charge and took exception to the instruction given by the\r\n  court, the basis for this objection was not the trial court's failure to\r\n  specifically include language that the jury was free to accept or reject this\r\n  permissive inference of knowledge and possession.Â  Rather, counsel's sole\r\n  argument was that any instruction including the word &quot;inferred&quot; or &quot;inference&quot;\r\n  would be burden shifting, would be a comment on the facts, and would deny him\r\n  due process.Â  Counsel never requested the trial judge include language that the\r\n  jury was free to accept or reject the permissive inference.Â  Further, appellant\r\n  does not challenge on appeal the language of the charge as being improper\r\n  because of the inclusion of the word &quot;inferred&quot; or the word &quot;inference&quot;\r\n  as he argued at trial.On appeal, Barno\r\n  appears to agree that a charge including the word &quot;inference&quot; may be\r\n  proper.Â  He never argued at trial, as he does on appeal, that the charge was\r\n  burden shifting because it failed to instruct the jury that they could reject\r\n  the inference.Â  Further, Barno never asked the trial judge to include an\r\n  instruction that the jury could accept or reject the inference.Â  In essence,\r\n  Barno argued to the trial judge that the charge was improper based upon the use\r\n  of the word &quot;inference,&quot; thus contending it was an incorrect\r\n  statement of the law. Â However, the law as charged by the trial judge, in and\r\n  of itself, was not an incorrect statement of the law and Barno does not, on\r\n  appeal, challenge the law as charged by the trial judge as an incorrect\r\n  statement.Â  SeeÂ  State v. Adams, 291 S.C. 132, 135, 352 S.E.2d\r\n  483, 486 (1987) (stating the proper charge on constructive possession is to\r\n  instruct the jury that the defendant's knowledge and possession may be inferred\r\n  if the substance was found on premises under his control); see also State v. Tindall, 379 S.C. 304, 313-14, 665 S.E.2d 188, 193-94 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008), rev'd on other grounds, 388 S.C. 518, 698 S.E.2d 203 (2010)\r\n  (quoting with approval a charge substantially identical to the case at hand\r\n  which stated, &quot;The defendants knowledge and possession may be inferred\r\n  when a substance is found on the property under the defendants control.Â \r\n  However, the inference is simply an evidentiary fact to be taken into\r\n  consideration by you along with other evidence in the case and to be given the\r\n  weight you decide it should have,&quot; finding the language adequately charged\r\n  the law as determined from the evidence and provided the proper law for the\r\n  jury to consider).Â  Rather, Barno essentially asserts that the charge was\r\n  incomplete in that it did not include an instruction that the jury could accept\r\n  or reject the inference.Â  Barno never requested the trial judge include such an\r\n  instruction with his charge.Â  Because he is attempting to raise an argument on\r\n  appeal not brought to the trial court's attention, and additionally failed to\r\n  ask the court to include the portion of the charge he is now maintaining should\r\n  have been included, the issue argued on appeal is not properly preserved.Â  See Madison\r\n    v. Babcock Ctr., Inc., 371 S.C. 123, 144,\r\n  638 S.E.2d 650, 661 (2006) (holding arguments not presented to nor ruled upon\r\n  by trial court are not preserved for appellate review); State v.

Shropshier appeals the judgment entered against him in favor\r\n  of Respondent Associated Receivables Funding, Inc. (A/R Funding).Â  Shropshier\r\n  argues A/R Funding failed to:Â  (1) prove Shropshier breached the contract; (2)\r\n  put forth evidence to support the award of damages; and (3) prove that it was\r\n  entitled to attorney's fees.Â  We affirm[1] the judgment in part as modified and remand, pursuant to Rule 220(b) and the\r\n  following authorities:Â  \r\n1.Â  As to whether\r\n  there is any evidence that Shropshier breached the contract, we find this issue\r\n  abandoned on appeal. Â See Transp. Ins. Co. &amp; Flagstar Corp. v.\r\n    S.C. Second Injury Fund, 389 S.C. 422, __, 699 S.E.2d 687, 692 (2010)\r\n  (&quot;Short, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are\r\n  deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not preserved for our review.&quot;)\r\n  (internal quotation and citation omitted).Â  As to whether there was a novation\r\n  of the parties' agreement, we find Shropshier failed to show the parties\r\n  intended the promissory note to be a substitution of the original agreement. Â See Superior Auto. Ins. Co. v. Maners, 261 S.C. 257, 262, 199 S.E.2d 719,\r\n  722 (1973) (holding there must be an intention to create a novation, which can\r\n  be ascertained from the circumstances surrounding the transaction); Wellman,\r\n    Inc. v. Square D. Co., 366 S.C. 61, 72, 620 S.E.2d 86, 92 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding\r\n  a novation is &quot;an agreement between all parties concerned for the\r\n  substitution of a new obligation between the parties with the intent to\r\n  extinguish the old obligation,&quot; and the party asserting a novation has the\r\n  burden of proving it) (internal quotation and citation omitted).\r\n2.Â  As to whether\r\n  the $46,760.83 judgment is supported by the evidence, we find the award of\r\n  $6,583.62 in contractual fees is wholly unsupported by the record.Â  Thus, we\r\n  reduce the award by that amount.Â  We affirm the rest of the award, subtract the\r\n  contractual fees, and modify the judgment to $40,177.21.Â  See Coakley\r\n    v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 376 S.C. 2, 6, 656 S.E.2d 17, 19 (2007) (&quot;[O]n\r\n  appeal of a case tried without a jury, we may not disturb the trial judge's\r\n  findings of fact unless those findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence\r\n  or unless it clearly appears the findings are controlled by an error of\r\n  law.&quot;) (internal quotation and citation omitted).\r\n3.Â  As to whether\r\n  the court erred in awarding attorney's fees, we find A/R Funding is\r\n  contractually entitled to attorney's fees; however, we remand the issue of the\r\n  amount of attorney's fees for consideration of the appropriate factors, as we\r\n  are unable to make this determination from the record. Â See Baron\r\n    Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 383, 377 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1989)\r\n  (noting attorney's fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or\r\n  statute); id. at 384-85, 377 S.E.2d at 297 (stating that although no one\r\n  factor is controlling, the trial court must consider the following six\r\n  factors:Â  (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services\r\n  rendered; (2) the time and labor necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the\r\n  professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the\r\n  fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; and (6) the\r\n  beneficial results obtained) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  judgment herein is\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART AS MODIFIED and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-502","title":"State v.

Morant, of Georgetown, for\r\n          Guardian ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Linda D. W. (Mother) appeals from the family court's order terminating her\r\n  parental rights to her minor children (Children).Â  Mother argues the family court erred in terminating her parental rights pursuant to sections\r\n  63-7-2570(1) (based on the severity of abuse the home cannot be made safe\r\n  within twelve months) and 63-7-2570(9) (the physical abuse of a child by a\r\n  parent resulted in the death of the child and the parent was convicted of\r\n  murder) of the South Carolina Code (2010).Â  Mother also appeals the family\r\n  court's finding termination\r\n  of parental rights (TPR) was in Children's best interests.Â  We disagree.[1]Â  \r\n1.Â  We affirm the\r\n  family court's finding that based on the severity of the abuse Mother inflicted\r\n  on her oldest child, it is not reasonably likely Mother's home can be made safe\r\n  within twelve months.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2010) (stating the family\r\n  court may order TPR upon finding one or more of eleven statutory grounds is\r\n  satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best interest of the child); Â§\r\n  63-7-2570(1) (&quot;The child . . . in the home has been harmed as defined in [s]ection\r\n  63-7-20, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it\r\n  is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.Â  In\r\n  determining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the parent's\r\n  previous abuse or neglect of the child or another child in the home may be\r\n  considered.&quot;); S.C Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-20(4) (2010) (stating &quot;child\r\n  abuse or neglect&quot; occurs when the parent &quot;inflicts or allows to be\r\n  inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or engages in acts or\r\n  omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or mental injury to the\r\n  child&quot;). \r\n2.Â  We affirm the family\r\n  court's finding that Mother's physical abuse of her oldest child resulted in\r\n  the death of that child and Mother pled guilty to second-degree murder in North\r\n  Carolina.Â  See Â§ 63-7-2570(9) (&quot;The physical abuse of a child of\r\n  the parent resulted in the death . . . of that child and the abuse is the act\r\n  for which the parent has been convicted of or pled guilty . . . to committing,\r\n  aiding, abetting, conspiring to commit, or soliciting an offense against the\r\n  person as provided for in Title 16, Chapter 3, criminal domestic violence as\r\n  defined in Section 16-25-20, criminal domestic violence of a high and\r\n  aggravated nature as defined in Section 16-25-65, or the common law offense of\r\n  assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.&quot;).\r\nÂ 3.Â  Despite Mother's arguments to the\r\n  contrary, we find clear and convincing evidence supports the finding that\r\n  termination of Mother's parental rights was in the best interests of Children.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620 (2010) (explaining when the child's\r\n  interests and the parental rights conflict, the child's interests shall\r\n  prevail); Charleston County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.

Jackson,\r\n  368 S.C. 87, 95, 627 S.E.2d 765, 770 (stating despite the appellate court's\r\n  broad scope of review, it should not necessarily disregard the findings of the\r\n  family court, which was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the\r\n  witnesses and to assign weight to their testimony); Id. at 102, 627\r\n  S.E.2d at 774&nbsp;(declaring the best interests of the children are the\r\n  paramount consideration in a TPR case).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., KONDUROS,\r\n  J., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-507","title":"Cue-NcNei v.

(Daughter),\r\n  against George W. Watt, M.D., Medical Park OB/GYN, P.A., and Palmetto Health\r\n  Alliance d/b/a Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital (collectively Respondents)\r\n  to recover damages for allegedly negligent medical care during Daughter's\r\n  birth.Â  The circuit court granted partial summary judgment to Respondents,\r\n  concluding that only a minor's parents, not the minor\r\n  herself, have a cause of action for the recovery of medical expenses resulting\r\n  from the minor's injury.Â  Mother appeals.Â  \r\nIn its order\r\n  granting partial summary judgment, the circuit court concluded that summary judgment is proper for an action by a minor\r\n  attempting to collect medical expenses during minority &quot;because she does\r\n  not have the capacity to sue.&quot;Â \r\n  We agree that a minor may not recover medical expenses incurred during minority\r\n  from a tortfeasor in her own personal injury action, and we affirm this part of\r\n  the circuit court's order.[1]Â \r\n  However, it is possible to infer from the circuit court's conclusion that the\r\n  entirety of Daughter's personal injury action against Respondent is invalid\r\n  because she does not have the legal capacity to bring this action.Â  To the\r\n  extent that the trial court implied that Daughter did not properly bring her\r\n  action through a guardian ad litem and therefore may not pursue damages other\r\n  than medical expenses, the statement is erroneous and is therefore vacated.Â \r\n  Daughter properly brought this action against Respondents through her guardian\r\n  ad litem pursuant to Rule\r\n  17(c), SCRCP, which states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  If a minor or incompetent person does not have a duly appointed\r\n    representative he may sue by his next friend or by guardian ad litem.\r\n    The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for a minor or incompetent person\r\n    not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such order as it deems\r\n    proper for the protection of the minor or incompetent person.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nHere, the circuit\r\n  court had issued an order appointing Mother to serve as guardian ad litem for\r\n  Daughter well before Respondents sought partial summary judgment.Â  Therefore, Daughter\r\n  may pursue this action against Respondents except to the extent that she claims\r\n  medical expenses incurred during minority.Â Â Â  Â \r\nIn view of our disposition of\r\n  the foregoing issues, we need not address Mother's remaining arguments.Â  See Webb v.

As to whether the circuit\r\n  court erred in determining the statute of limitations barred Paul's claim for\r\n  civil conspiracy: S.C. Code Ann.

As to\r\n  whether the circuit court erred in\r\n  finding that the Rule 60(b)(5) motion was not timely filed:Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP (requiring a motion\r\n  for relief from a judgment to be made within a reasonable time); Evans v.\r\n    Gunter, 294 S.C. 525, 529, 366 S.E.2d\r\n  44, 46 (Ct.

Michael Baxley, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2010-UP-511\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2010 â€“ Filed November\r\n  23, 2010Â Â Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tCharles Owen Nation, II, of Georgetown, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn W. Davidson, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this debt collection action, S. Joseph Kozlowski\r\n  appeals the circuit court's denial of his motion for relief from default\r\n  judgment.Â  On appeal, Kozlowski maintains the circuit court abused its\r\n  discretion in failing to grant relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1) and (4), SCRCP,\r\n  arguing the default was the result of excusable neglect or, in the alternative,\r\n  the judgment was void because service of process was not perfected.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nRule\r\n  60(b)(4) provides for relief from default when the judgment is void. Â Rule\r\n  60(b)(4), SCRCP (&quot;On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may\r\n  relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding [because] . .\r\n  . the judgment is void.&quot;). Â &quot;A judgment is void if a court acts\r\n  without personal jurisdiction.&quot;Â  BB &amp; T v. Taylor, 369 S.C.\r\n  548, 551, 633 S.E.2d 501, 503 (2006).Â  A court usually obtains personal\r\n  jurisdiction by the service of the summons, which, pursuant to Rule 4, SCRCP,\r\n  is typically effected by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to the\r\n  individual personally or by leaving copies thereof at the individual's\r\n  residence, or by delivering a copy to an agent authorized by law to receive\r\n  service of process.Â  Rule 4(d)(1), SCRCP.Â  When the defendant is a resident of\r\n  this state, but after a diligent search cannot be found, service by publication\r\n  may be appropriate. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-710(3) (2005); Montgomery v.\r\n    Mullins, 325 S.C. 500, 505, 480 S.E.2d 467, 470 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  South Carolina, service by publication is authorized by statute.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-9-710 to -750 (2005 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  Specifically, pursuant\r\n  to section 15-9-710, an order for service by publication may be issued &quot;when\r\n  an affidavit, satisfactory to the issuing officer, is made stating that the\r\n  defendant, a resident of the state, cannot, after the exercise of due diligence,\r\n  be found and that a cause of action exists against him.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-9-710 (2005); Wachovia Bank of S.C., N.A. v. Player, 341 S.C. 424,\r\n  428-29, 535 S.E.2d 128, 130 (2000).Â  When publication is deemed appropriate\r\n  under the framework outlined above, section 15-9-740 (Supp. 2009) sets forth\r\n  specific statutory requirements for the order of publication.Â  In particular,\r\n  section 15-9-740 provides:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  order of publication shall direct the publication to be made in one newspaper .\r\n  . . for such length of time as may be deemed reasonable not less than once a\r\n  week for three weeks.Â  The court . . . shall also direct that a copy of the\r\n  summons be forthwith deposited in the post office directed to the person to be\r\n  served at his place of residence, unless it appears that such residence is\r\n  neither known to the party making the application nor can, with reasonable\r\n  diligence, be ascertained by him.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-740. \r\nHere,\r\n  following several unsuccessful attempts at serving Kozlowski personally, Trico\r\n  Engineering Consultants (Trico) sought an order for service by publication from\r\n  the circuit court.Â  While Kozlowski's specific residence was unknown, Trico\r\n  averred Kozlowski's last known address was the Nation Law Firm, 317 Screven\r\n  Street, Georgetown, S.C.Â  Consequently, in accordance with section 15-9-740,\r\n  the circuit court's order for service by publication directed Trico to (1)\r\n  publish the summons and complaint in The Georgetown Times once a week for three\r\n  successive weeks and (2) mail a copy of the pleadings by certified mail to\r\n  Kozlowski at his last known address on or before the first date of publication.Â \r\n  Significantly, the order expressly cited 317 Screven Street, Georgetown, S.C.,\r\n  as Kozlowski's last known address where the summons was to be mailed. Â Despite\r\n  this specific mailing requirement, however, Trico mailed the pleadings to a\r\n  Post Office Box address neither mentioned in the order nor disclosed to the\r\n  parties to be a more appropriate address for Kozlowski.Â  Kozlowski asserts this\r\n  noncompliance with the order's specific mailing requirement renders the service\r\n  by publication invalid.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  actual notice,[2] we are constrained to find service\r\n  was not proper when Trico failed to comply with the specific mailing\r\n  requirement of the circuit court's order. Â Consequently, after a thorough\r\n  review of the record, we find the circuit court erred in failing to grant\r\n  relief under Rule 60(b)(4),[3] and we reverse the order of the circuit court pursuant to the following\r\n  authorities:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-740\r\n  (establishing the requirements for service by publication); Tenney v. Am.\r\n    Pipe Mfg. Co., 96 F. 919, 919 (D.S.C. 1899) (service by publication is in\r\n  derogation of the common law, and the statute must be strictly construed); see,\r\n    e.g., Brown v. Malloy, 345 S.C. 113, 126-27, 546 S.E.2d 195, 201-02\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (finding notice would be insufficient for due process purposes when\r\n  order of publication erroneously designated county where defendant did not\r\n  reside as the proper county for publication and when notice was published in a newspaper\r\n  of general circulation in the improper county); McGloon v. Gwynn, 100\r\n  P.3d 621, 625 (Idaho 2004) (finding failure to comply with mailing requirement\r\n  of rules of civil procedure in effecting service by publication required\r\n  default judgment be set aside as service was invalid); In re Marriage of\r\n    Wilson, 502 N.E.2d 447, 449 (Ill. App. 1986) (holding failure to mail a\r\n  copy of the publication to respondent's last known address as stated in the\r\n  affidavit and required by relevant statute rendered service by publication\r\n  invalid when strict compliance with the statute mandated mailing of the notice\r\n  as a relevant part of the publication process); Sink v. Easter, 202\r\n  S.E.2d 138, 141 (N.C. App. 1974) (finding plaintiff's failure to mail defendant\r\n  a copy of the notice of divorce when the service was by publication, as\r\n  required by the statute, rendered service of process by publication invalid); Sanders\r\n    v. Sanders, 278 A.2d 615, 618&nbsp;(Md. App. 1971) (stating in divorce\r\n  proceeding &quot;[w]here a statute requires not only a publication but also\r\n  that a copy of the petition be mailed by registered mail to the defendant at\r\n  his or her last known address, the mailing is as much a part of the service as\r\n  the publication, and where there is a publication but there is no mailing, or\r\n  the plaintiff causes a notice to be mailed to a false address, the service is\r\n  void. The mere fact that the\r\n  defendant has actual notice of the institution of the proceedings against him\r\n  is not sufficient to give the court jurisdiction where the plaintiff has not\r\n  complied substantially with the statutes on constructive service.&quot;)\r\n  (quoting 24 Am. Jur. 2d, Divorce and Separation Â§ 286); Anderson v.\r\n    Anderson, 82 N.E. 311, 311 (Ill. 1907) (finding failure to mail notice of\r\n  publication to the last known residence when notice mailed to 5857 State\r\n  Street, Chicago, IL, rather than 5559 State Street, as stated in the affidavit,\r\n  was insufficient to confer jurisdiction).[4]\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  PIEPER, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] At the hearing, counsel indicated Kozlowski came to\r\n  his office after reading the publication in The Georgetown Times.\r\n[3] We note the following factors, while relevant to a\r\n  motion under Rule 60(b)(1), do not apply to a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4):\r\n  (1) the promptness with which relief is sought, (2) the reasons for the failure\r\n  to act promptly, (3) the existence of a meritorious defense, and (4) the\r\n  prejudice to the other parties.Â  See BB&amp;T, 369 S.C. at 553\r\n  n.1, 633 S.E.2d at 503 n.1.\r\n[4] Based on our disposition herein, we need not reach Kozlowski's\r\n  remaining argument as to excusable neglect under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  See Futch v.
