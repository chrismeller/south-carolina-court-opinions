Barron Grier, III, and Joseph Henry, both of Columbia, for Appellant. \r\nE. Dale Lang, Jr., James B. Lybrand, Jr., Paul T. Collins, and Larry Cornell \r\n  Smith, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty \r\n  Insurance Company sought a declaratory judgment that policy exclusions absolved \r\n  it of the duty to provide a defense for or indemnify Pearsonâ€™s Funeral Home \r\n  for injuries sustained by Pearsonâ€™s employee.Â  The circuit court held policy \r\n  exclusions did not apply.Â  We dismiss Pennsylvania Nationalâ€™s appeal as moot.\r\nFACTS\r\nLarry Corley was injured in a collision involving \r\n  a hearse and another limousine while chauffeuring for Pearsonâ€™s.Â  Pearsonâ€™s \r\n  insured all three vehicles under a commercial automobile insurance policy issued \r\n  by Pennsylvania National.Â  \r\nCorley and his wife brought an action against Pearsonâ€™s \r\n  and Warren Robinson, the other limousine driver, alleging negligence and loss \r\n  of consortium.Â  Pennsylvania National denied liability coverage.Â  Before Pennsylvania \r\n  Nationalâ€™s denial of benefits could be adjudicated, the Corleysâ€™ suit was removed \r\n  from the active roster.Â  The Corleys later refiled their suit specifically seeking \r\n  recovery under the uninsured motorist provisions of Pearsonâ€™s policy.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBefore the Corleysâ€™ suit was restored to the active roster, \r\n  Pennsylvania National brought a declaratory judgment action arguing policy exclusions \r\n  disallowed both liability and uninsured motorist coverage and, consequently, \r\n  it had no duty to defend or indemnify the funeral home in the Corleysâ€™ underlying \r\n  tort suit. Â Pennsylvania National added State Farm, the Corleysâ€™ automobile \r\n  insurer, as a defendant in an amended complaint, but requested no specific relief \r\n  from the insurer.Â  Following a hearing, the circuit court determined policy \r\n  exclusions were inapplicable.Â  Pennsylvania National appealed.\r\nWhile the appeal was pending, Pennsylvania National entered \r\n  into a written agreement and release with the Corleys settling their tort claim \r\n  for $50,000.Â  The agreement released all parties from liability for injuries \r\n  arising from the automobile accident, and Pennsylvania National purported to \r\n  reserve the right to seek recovery against State Farm for the sum paid to the \r\n  Corleys.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA declaratory judgment action to determine insurance coverage \r\n  is an action at law.Â  Pennell v. Foster, 338 S.C. 9, 14, 524 S.E.2d 630, \r\n  633 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  In an action at law, the appellate court may only correct \r\n  errors of law and will uphold the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings if any evidence \r\n  supports them.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. \r\n  81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPennsylvania National contends the trial court erred in determining \r\n  the exclusions of liability and uninsured motorist coverage did not apply to \r\n  the Corleysâ€™ claims.Â  We dismiss Pennsylvania Nationalâ€™s appeal as moot.\r\nPennsylvania National claims it reserved its claims denying \r\n  coverage and retained a subrogation right against State Farm by including the \r\n  following clause in the agreement it entered into with the Corleys:\r\n\r\nFurther, the undersigned in settling this action acknowledge \r\n  that the named plaintiff Larry Corley will no longer have an interest in the \r\n  declaratory judgment action currently on appeal but that Pennsylvania National \r\n  Mutual Casualty Insurance Company will maintain its rights to assert that it \r\n  is not the provider of coverage and will seek repayment of the amounts paid \r\n  in settlement from State Farm Insurance Company.Â  Nothing in this Release is \r\n  intended nor should be interpreted as barring that claim. \r\n\r\nPennsylvania National reasons if this court accepts the reservation \r\n  clause as valid and determines the circuit court erred in finding the policy \r\n  exclusions inapplicable, it would then be able to seek reimbursement of the \r\n  settlement money from State Farm pursuant to State Farmâ€™s uninsured coverage \r\n  policy on the Corleys.Â  \r\nPennsylvania Nationalâ€™s amended complaint merely added State \r\n  Farm as a defendant in its declaratory judgment action.Â  The complaint demanded \r\n  no relief from State Farm and failed to provide any additional facts that would \r\n  support a finding State Farm was primarily or secondarily liable for Corleyâ€™s \r\n  injuries.Â  Therefore, the extent of State Farmâ€™s liability was never presented \r\n  to the circuit court for its determination and may not be addressed by this \r\n  court for the first time on appeal.Â  United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 356 S.C. 266, 273, 588 S.E.2d \r\n  599, 602 (2003) (An issue neither raised to nor ruled upon by trial court is \r\n  unpreserved for appellate review.); Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 152, \r\n  543 S.E.2d 224, 227 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œ[O]rdinarily a party may not receive relief \r\n  not contemplated in his pleadings.â€); Cf. Rushing v. Intex Prods., \r\n  Inc., 285 S.C. 595, 599, 330 S.E.2d 555, 557 (Ct. App. 1985) (In a declaratory \r\n  judgment action, the court may grant affirmative relief not requested if party \r\n  has pleaded facts upon which such relief may be granted.).Â  \r\nThe only issue Pennsylvania National presented for \r\n  determination in its pleadings was whether it was liable for the Corleysâ€™ injuries \r\n  under the liability and uninsured motorist coverage provisions of its own policy.Â  \r\n  Pennsylvania National settled the question of its own liability when it voluntarily \r\n  settled with the Corleys and had the Corleys relieve all concerned parties from \r\n  liability.Â  As a result, there is no remaining claim upon which this court may \r\n  grant effective relief.Â  When some event occurs making it impossible for the \r\n  reviewing court to grant effective relief, the case is moot and may be properly \r\n  dismissed.Â  Curtis v.

Savitz, III, of Columbia, for \r\n  Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelanka \r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General William E. Salter, III, all of Columbia; \r\n  and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Gary Wayne Bennett \r\n  appeals his convictions for armed robbery and murder in connection with the \r\n  death of Eva Marie Martin, arguing the trial court erred in limiting his cross-examination \r\n  of the Stateâ€™s key witness, Andrew Lindsay, on Lindsayâ€™s prior conviction for \r\n  second-degree murder.Â  Bennett argues he should have been able to impeach Lindsay \r\n  by revealing the specific nature of Lindsayâ€™s prior murder conviction, rather \r\n  than being limited to a general characterization of the conviction as an unspecified \r\n  felony.Â  We agree, but find the error harmless and affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMartin was discovered murdered in her home on May \r\n  23, 2000.Â  Earlier that month, Bennett and Lindsay had plotted to rob a Horry \r\n  County Taco Bell restaurant managed by Martin.Â  Martin was an acquaintance and \r\n  a coworker of Bennettâ€™s common-law wife.Â  Although Bennett and Lindsay obtained \r\n  a key to the restaurant, they were unable to open its safe because they did \r\n  not have the safeâ€™s combination \r\nApproximately two months later, police questioned \r\n  Lindsay regarding Martinâ€™s murder. [1] Â  Lindsay initially provided police at least two statements \r\n  denying knowledge of or involvement in Martinâ€™s murder.Â  He later recanted his \r\n  statement, admitted involvement in Martinâ€™s murder, but implicated Bennett as \r\n  the murderer.Â  Lindsay was later charged with Martinâ€™s murder, but entered a \r\n  plea bargain with the State.Â  Pursuant to the agreement, Lindsay pled guilty \r\n  to being an accessory after the fact, in exchange for which he would testify \r\n  that Bennett killed Martin.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBennett was subsequently charged with and tried \r\n  for murder and armed robbery in connection with Martinâ€™s death.Â  The State moved \r\n  in imine to limit Bennettâ€™s impeachment of Lindsay by prohibiting testimony \r\n  regarding Lindsayâ€™s 1991 second-degree murder conviction from Illinois.Â  Conversely, \r\n  Bennett wanted to impeach Lindsay on cross-examination by revealing the fact \r\n  that he had previously been convicted of murder.Â  It is unchallenged that Lindsayâ€™s \r\n  murder conviction falls squarely within the admissibility parameters of Rule \r\n  609, SCRE. [2] Â  Rule 609(a)(1), \r\n  SCRE, provides in relevant part that impeachment of a non-defendant witnessâ€™s \r\n  credibility with evidence of the non-defendant witnessâ€™s past criminal convictions \r\n  is permissible â€œif the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess \r\n  of one year under the law under which the witness was convictedâ€ and if under \r\n  Rule 403, SCRE, the court determines that the evidenceâ€™s probative value is \r\n  not â€œsubstantially outweighedâ€ by the danger of unfair prejudice. Here, the \r\n  trial judge indicated his intent to limit Bennett â€œto making inquiries without \r\n  identifying [Lindsayâ€™s 1991 second-degree murder conviction] as a second-degree \r\n  murder chargeâ€ ostensibly out of concern that testimony regarding the specific \r\n  nature of Lindsayâ€™s second-degree murder conviction would prejudice Bennett.Â  \r\n  We are unable to discern from the record the rule of evidence or legal principle \r\n  relied upon by the trial judge in countermanding defense counselâ€™s intended \r\n  strategic use of relevant and admissible evidence.Â  In this regard, Bennettâ€™s \r\n  counsel insisted that he, not the court, assess potential prejudice arising \r\n  from the use of relevant and admissible evidence.Â  Bennettâ€™s stated strategy \r\n  was to confront and impeach Lindsay with every available weapon, including Lindsayâ€™s \r\n  murder conviction.Â  The trial judge, nevertheless, persisted with the limitation \r\n  on Bennettâ€™s desired impeachment of Lindsay.\r\nBennett later vigorously cross-examined Lindsay \r\n  regarding, among other things, the details of his plea bargain, the fact that \r\n  he lied to police in two sworn statements before admitting involvement in Martinâ€™s \r\n  murder, the fact that police found the Taco Bellâ€™s safe combination on a piece \r\n  of paper in Lindsayâ€™s wallet at the time of his arrest, and the fact that he \r\n  was currently serving a ten-year prison sentence for seven counts of second-degree \r\n  burglary, to which he pled guilty in 2001.Â  Regarding Lindsayâ€™s 1991 murder \r\n  conviction, Bennett asked â€œYouâ€™re a convicted felon, received a sentence of \r\n  fifteen years â€¦ to a charge that has nothing to do with the burglary charges \r\n  youâ€™re serving your time for now, isnâ€™t that right?â€Â  Lindsay replied, â€œYes.â€\r\nIn closing arguments, Bennett focused on the impact \r\n  of these issues on Lindsayâ€™s credibility, ultimately building a case implicating \r\n  Lindsay as Martinâ€™s murderer.Â  Among other things, he suggested Lindsay more \r\n  likely the perpetrator because while Bennett and his wife were close friends \r\n  with Martin, Lindsay was a mere social acquaintance less likely to care about \r\n  Martinâ€™s welfare.Â  He further noted that Lindsay, not Bennett, was found in \r\n  possession of the safeâ€™s combination, and that Lindsayâ€™s plea bargain with the \r\n  State motivated him to falsely implicate Bennett as the murderer. \r\nThe trial judge instructed the jury regarding witness \r\n  credibility and impeachment, noting that its consideration of a witnessâ€™s criminal \r\n  record was limited to its assessment of the witnessâ€™s credibility.Â  Bennett \r\n  was subsequently convicted for murder and armed robbery.Â  Because he had previously \r\n  been convicted of first-degree burglary, Bennett was sentenced to concurrent \r\n  life terms without parole under the recidivist statute. \r\n  [3] Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAs a general rule, a trial courtâ€™s ruling on the \r\n  proper scope of cross-examination will not be disturbed absent a manifest abuse \r\n  of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. \r\n  189, 196, 498 S.E.2d 642, 645 (1998);Â  State v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, \r\n  621, 582 S.E.2d 426, 429&nbsp;(2003).Â  This rule is subject to the Sixth Amendmentâ€™s \r\n  guarantee of a defendantâ€™s right to a â€œmeaningfulâ€ cross-examination of a witness.Â  \r\n  State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. at 196, 498 S.E.2d at 645.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBennett argues the trial court improperly \r\n  limited his cross-examination of Lindsay regarding Lindsayâ€™s past conviction \r\n  for second-degree murder. [4]  According to Bennett, he should \r\n  have been able to confront and impeach Lindsay with the murder conviction, rather \r\n  than the court-imposed restriction on Lindsayâ€™s cross-examination.Â  We agree, \r\n  but find the error harmless.Â  As noted, Rule 609 permits impeachment of a non-defendant \r\n  witness with the witnessâ€™s criminal conviction â€œif the crime was punishable \r\n  by â€¦ imprisonment in excess of one year.â€Â  This rule comports with the Sixth \r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitutionâ€™s â€œConfrontation Clause,â€ through \r\n  which a defendant has the right to cross-examine a witness concerning bias or \r\n  partiality.Â  State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 331, 563 S.E.2d 315, 319 \r\n  (2002).Â  On cross-examination, any fact may be elicited which tends to show \r\n  the witnessâ€™s interest, bias, or partiality.Â  Id.Â  â€œBefore a trial judge \r\n  may limit a criminal defendantâ€™s right to engage in cross-examination to show \r\n  bias on the part of the witness, the record must clearly show the cross-examination \r\n  is inappropriate.â€Â  Id.Â  In this case, Lindsay was a â€œwitnessâ€ previously \r\n  convicted of a crime, second-degree murder, which resulted in a sentence of \r\n  fifteen years.Â  Thus, we find that the trial judge properly concluded that the \r\n  evidence of Lindsayâ€™s murder conviction was admissible under Rule 609(a)(1) \r\n  of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence.Â Â  \r\nHere, the trial judgeâ€™s basis for finding the cross-examination \r\n  â€œinappropriateâ€ arose from his concern regarding the potential prejudice to \r\n  Bennett, who advocated admitting the evidence.Â  The court expressed concern \r\n  that a jury might determine Bennett had committed the murder because Lindsay, \r\n  his friend and co-defendant, had a previous murder conviction.Â  We find this \r\n  rationale not only erroneous, but also an unwarranted intrusion into strategy \r\n  determinations vested solely in the accused and his counsel. \r\nâ€œThe authority to decide the objectives and means \r\n  of litigation is divided between the client and the attorney.â€Â  Alex Sanders \r\n  &amp; John S. Nichols, Trial Handbook for South Carolina Lawyers Â§ 1:4, \r\n  23 (2d ed. 2002); see Rule 407, SCAR, Rules of Prof. Conduct, 1.2(a) \r\n  (a lawyer shall abide by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation \r\n  and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued);Â  \r\n  cf. Whitehead v. State, 308 S.C. 119, 122, 417 S.E.2d 529, 531 \r\n  (1992) (Stating that in the context of post-conviction relief that â€œ[c]ourts \r\n  must be wary of second-guessing counselâ€™s trial tactics; and where counsel articulates \r\n  a valid reason for employing certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed \r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel.â€).Â  â€œSubject to a few exceptions, the client \r\n  makes all decisions regarding the objectives of litigation and representation.â€Â  \r\n  Sanders &amp; Nichols, Trial Handbook for South Carolina Lawyers, Â§ 1:4 \r\n  at 23.Â  However, â€œ[t]he lawyer generally decides the means to be used to achieve \r\n  the clientâ€™s legitimate objectives, especially legal and tactical questions.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 24.Â  Where, as here, proposed evidence is relevant and admissible, \r\n  and its use is merely a function of defense strategy involving the weighing \r\n  of potential benefits and risks of prejudice, the decision of the defendant \r\n  and his counsel controls.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s decision here directly contravened \r\n  the strategic tactics of Bennettâ€™s counsel and had the effect of limiting Bennettâ€™s \r\n  confrontation and impeachment of Lindsay.Â  We find this an improper limitation \r\n  of Bennettâ€™s right to confront a witness, amounting to legal error.\r\nHowever, an improper \r\n  limitation of the defendantâ€™s right to confront a witness is not per se \r\n  reversible if the error was â€œharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 333, 563 S.E.2d at 318.Â  An error is harmless beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt where, in view of the entire record, the error did not contribute \r\n  to the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  See Id., 349 at 334, \r\n  563 S.E.2d at 319.Â  While we recognize the importance of Lindsayâ€™s testimony \r\n  to the Stateâ€™s case, we are persuaded that the error is harmless in light of \r\n  the overwhelming level of impeachment otherwise permitted during Bennettâ€™s cross-examination \r\n  of Lindsay, including the details of his plea bargain, the fact that he was \r\n  in prison for multiple counts of burglary, and the fact that he had lied to \r\n  police in multiple statements before admitting his involvement in the crime.Â  \r\n  We further note that some impeachment value was derived from the reference to \r\n  the Lindsayâ€™s murder conviction as a â€œfelonyâ€ for which he received a â€œfifteen \r\n  year sentence.â€Â  Moreover, Bennett was allowed to argue, without objection, \r\n  the issue of Lindsayâ€™s third-party guilt during his closing argument.Â  In light \r\n  of the totality of these circumstances, we find the error harmless beyond a \r\n  reasonable doubt.Â  This conclusion is consistent with decisions in other jurisdictions.Â  \r\n  Where a trial court errs in limiting a defendantâ€™s ability on cross-examination \r\n  to confront and impeach a witness, such error is generally harmless when the \r\n  cross-examiner is allowed to otherwise pursue a thorough and meaningful cross-examination.Â  \r\n  See Artis v. U.S., 505 A.2d 52 (D.C.App. 1986) (In a prosecution \r\n  for burglary and larceny it was error to curtail appropriate line of cross-examination \r\n  of prosecution witness concerning juvenile charges pending against him, but \r\n  such error was harmless where cross-examination otherwise highlighted witnessâ€™s \r\n  motives to curry favor with the government to escape prosecution for burglaries \r\n  and other offenses and to avoid possible revocation of his probation);Â  Morris \r\n  v. State, 166 Ga.App. 137, 303 S.E.2d 492 (1983) (Error occurred in burglary \r\n  prosecution where defendant was precluded from cross-examining accomplice who \r\n  testified for prosecution regarding existence of any pending charges and promises \r\n  of immunity, but error was harmless where defendant was able to question defendant \r\n  regarding his motives through another line of questioning);Â  State v.

State, 338 S.C. 428, 433-34, \r\n    527 S.E2d. 98, 101 (2000) (Declining to hold past convictions of the accused \r\n    inadmissible in all cases, but instead finding that a trial court should weigh \r\n    the probative value of the prior convictions against their prejudicial effect \r\n    to the accused and determine, in its discretion, whether to admit the evidence.Â  \r\n    In doing so, the factors a trial court should consider are (1) the impeachment \r\n    value of the prior crime; (2) the point in time of the conviction and the \r\n    witnessâ€™ subsequent history; (3) the similarity between the past crime and \r\n    the charged crime; and (5) the centrality of the credibility issue.).Â  The \r\n    Green factors are not implicated by the testimony of a witness who \r\n    is not the accused, such as Lindsay.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  South Carolinaâ€™s recidivist \r\n    statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-25-45 (Supp. 2000), mandates, among other things, \r\n    an automatic life without parole sentence when a person has been convicted \r\n    of more than one â€œmost seriousâ€ offense.Â  Such â€œmost seriousâ€ offenses, as \r\n    defined by the statute, include first-degree burglary, murder, and armed robbery.Â  \r\n    Here, the State notified Bennett and his counsel that because Bennett had \r\n    a prior first-degree burglary conviction, he would be subject to a sentence \r\n    of life in prison without parole if convicted on either the murder or armed \r\n    robbery charge.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Bennett objected to the \r\n    courtâ€™s limitation of his cross-examination of Lindsay in the in limine \r\n    hearing, but he did not renew his objection when Lindsay testified.Â  Generally, \r\n    an in limine ruling does not preserve an issue for review because a \r\n    motion in limine is not a final determination.Â  State v. Forrester, \r\n    343 S.C. 637, 642, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001).Â  An issue ruled upon in an \r\n    in limine hearing is therefore not preserved for appellate review unless \r\n    the moving party makes a contemporaneous objection when the evidence is introduced, \r\n    except where the judgeâ€™s ruling is, in effect, a final ruling.Â  Id.Â  \r\n    Here, due to the circumstances surrounding the trial judgeâ€™s ruling in the \r\n    present case, the State conceded at oral argument that the issue is preserved \r\n    for review.Â  We accept the Stateâ€™s stipulation and address the issue on its \r\n    merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-354","title":"Weldon v.

Siachos, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this consumer litigation \r\n  action over the purchase of a boat, Harmon Weldon appeals the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  grant of summary judgment to Tiger Town RV and Marine Center, Inc., Tracker \r\n  Marine, L.P., and Brunswick Corporation, Inc. on claims for breach of warranty \r\n  and revocation of acceptance.Â  We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 28, 2001, Weldon purchased \r\n  a 2000 Procraft 190 SuperPro boat with a 175 horsepower Mercury engine from \r\n  Tiger Town RV and Marine Center.Â  Weldon signed the contract and made a down \r\n  payment of $2,500.00 that day.Â  He returned the following day to retrieve the \r\n  boat.Â  At that time, he was given an In Service Checklist and a Brunswick Outboard \r\n  Operation, Maintenance &amp; Warranty Manual.Â  In the manual, Brunswick limited \r\n  its obligation under the warranty to repairing a defective part, or at its option, \r\n  refunding the purchase price or replacing the part. It also disclaimed the implied \r\n  warranties of merchantability and fitness and excluded all incidental and consequential \r\n  damages.Â  Weldon asserted he never received a manual or warranty booklet from \r\n  Tracker Marine.Â  However, he acknowledges that if such a warranty is in effect, \r\n  it is the same as that provided by Brunswick.Â Â  \r\n Weldon has experienced numerous problems \r\n  with the boat.Â  Even before he picked it up, the boat had a blown fuse.Â  On \r\n  March 2, 2001, before Weldon had even put the boat in the water, he discovered \r\n  a fuel leak.Â  The boat also needed work on the live well and ignition at this \r\n  time.Â  On March 8, Weldon again had problems related to the motor.Â  The engine \r\n  would cut off when engaging the trim and the trim gauge did not work properly.Â  \r\n  The boat would also lose power and fail to accelerate.Â  Tiger Town placed a \r\n  call to Brunswick regarding a blown fuse and voltage regulator problem during \r\n  this service visit.Â  Around March 14, 2001, Weldon brought the boat back to \r\n  Tiger Town after experiencing problems with the boatâ€™s alarm system sounding \r\n  when the boat hit waves.Â  There was also a problem with the storage compartment \r\n  lid.Â  Around April 21, 2001, Weldon again had problems with the boat losing \r\n  power and had difficulty starting it.Â  The cranking battery died and the boat \r\n  would not plane off.Â Â  Through May and June of 2001, Weldon continued to have \r\n  problems with the boat planning off, the tilt/trim gauge, the starting battery, \r\n  and the trolling motor.Â  He also had a problem with the boatâ€™s fabric cover \r\n  and compartment covers.Â Â  Weldon again returned the boat to Tiger Town with \r\n  an enumerated list of problems and instructions to keep the boat until all the \r\n  problems were fixed.Â  The boat stayed at Tiger Town for six to seven weeks.Â  \r\n  When Weldon discovered that all of the problems had not been addressed, his \r\n  attorney delivered a letter to Tiger Town dated August 15, 2001, explaining \r\n  that Weldon revoked his acceptance of the boat.Â  Around this same time, Weldon \r\n  took the boat to test it on the lake, but it would not start.Â  \r\nOn October 24, 2001, Weldon brought suit \r\n  alleging causes of action for breach of warranty and revocation of acceptance \r\n  against Brunswick, Tracker, and Tiger Town.Â  Subsequent to Weldon bringing this \r\n  action, another wiring problem with the boat was discovered and repaired.Â  After \r\n  this repair, Tim Marlowe, a Technical Account Manager for Brunswick, inspected \r\n  the boat and took the boat out on the water.Â  He stated in his affidavit that \r\n  there was no nonconformity or defect regarding the motor.Â  However, he acknowledged \r\n  Weldon had alleged that the tilt/trim gauge on the boatâ€™s console was not properly \r\n  calibrated.Â Â Â  \r\nTiger Town, Brunswick, and Tracker moved \r\n  for summary judgment. Â The trial court granted the motions of Brunswick and \r\n  Tracker as to all causes of action.Â  The court also granted Tiger Townâ€™s motion \r\n  on the revocation of acceptance claim.Â  However, it denied Tiger Townâ€™s motion \r\n  on the breach of warranty claim, determining an issue of fact existed as to \r\n  whether certain oral statements were permissible puffing or created an express \r\n  warranty.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nTo obtain summary judgment, the moving \r\n  party must demonstrate there is â€œno genuine issue of material fact and the moving \r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Wilson v. Moseley, \r\n  327 S.C. 144, 146, 488 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1997).Â  In deciding a motion for summary \r\n  judgment, the court must view the evidence and the inferences that can be drawn \r\n  therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Id. â€œSummary \r\n  judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to the evidentiary \r\n  facts, if there is a dispute as to the conclusions to be drawn therefrom.â€Â  \r\n  Laurens Emergency Med. Specialists, P.A. v. M.S. Bailey &amp; Sons Bankers, \r\n  355 S.C. 104, 108-09, 584 S.E.2d 375, 377 (2003). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRevocation of Acceptance\r\nWeldon argues the trial court erred in \r\n  granting summary judgment to all defendants on the revocation of acceptance \r\n  cause of action.Â  We agree in part.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Uniform Commercial \r\n  Code (UCC) sets forth theÂ  elements for revocation of acceptance as follows:\r\n\r\n(1)Â  The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial \r\n  unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted \r\n  it \r\n  \r\n(a)Â  on the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would \r\n  be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or \r\n(b)Â  without discovery of such nonconformity if his acceptance \r\n  was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance \r\n  or by the sellerâ€™s assurances. \r\n  \r\n(2)Â  Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable \r\n  time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and \r\n  before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused \r\n  by their own defects. It is not effective until the buyer notifies the seller \r\n  of it. \r\n(3)Â  A buyer who so revokes has the same rights and duties \r\n  with regard to the goods involved as if he had rejected them.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-608 (2003).\r\nAs a ground for granting Brunswick and \r\n  Tracker Marine summary judgment on Weldonâ€™s claim for revocation, the trial \r\n  court held, â€œBecause Brunswick and Tracker did not sell the boat to [Weldon], \r\n  [Weldon] can neither reject nor revoke acceptance of the goods as to these parties.â€Â  \r\n  Weldon failed to specifically appeal this holding.Â  Accordingly, it is the law \r\n  of the case. Â See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; \r\n  Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (stating an unappealed \r\n  ruling is law of the case).Â  We must therefore affirm the trial courtâ€™s grant \r\n  of summary judgment on this issue as to Brunswick and Tracker Marine. \r\nAs to Weldonâ€™s claim for revocation against \r\n  Tiger Town, we hold the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.Â  \r\nIn granting Tiger Townâ€™s motion, the trial \r\n  court stated that Weldonâ€™s continued use of the boat operated as an acceptance \r\n  and that his revocation was not timely made.Â  This was error. \r\nIn Mockabee v. Wakefield Buick, Inc., \r\n  298 S.C. 386, 380 S.E.2d 848 (Ct. App. 1989), a case cited by the trial court, \r\n  this court ruled a car buyerâ€™s attempted revocation almost 22 months after the \r\n  date of purchase was not timely made.Â  However, the court cautioned that â€œ[t]wenty-two \r\n  months is not per se untimely in all situations.â€ Id. at. 388, \r\n  380 S.E.2d at 849.Â  The court in Mockabee noted there was some evidence \r\n  the buyer brought the car to the dealership shortly after purchase for an oil \r\n  leak and starting problem and then brought it back three or four times sometime \r\n  during the first year of ownership to complain about problems unspecified in \r\n  the record, but there was no evidence he returned it to the dealership in the \r\n  ten months preceding his attempted revocation. Id.Â  Furthermore, the \r\n  buyer never took the car to the service department but took it to the used car \r\n  salesman instead.Â  The court found the evidence failed to establish the dealership \r\n  made reasonable assurances to the buyer the carâ€™s defects would be cured thus \r\n  delaying the buyerâ€™s decision to revoke his acceptance.Â  Id.Â  Instead \r\n  it showed the buyer ignored the problems.Â  Id. Thus, the court concluded \r\n  that based on this evidence and considering the time lapse before notice of \r\n  revocation was given, the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence \r\n  is that the attempted revocation was not timely given in accordance with Section \r\n  36-2-608(2).Â  Mockabee, 298 S.C. 388-89, 380 S.E.2d at 849.\r\nUnlike the situation in Mockabee, throughout \r\n  the less than six months between his purchase of the boat and his letter notifying \r\n  Tiger Town that he was revoking his acceptance of it, Weldon continually delivered \r\n  the boat to Tiger Town for repairs.Â  According to Weldon, every time he tried \r\n  to put the boat in the water, a new problem developed and he has not even used \r\n  a full tank of gas in the boat yet.Â  The only evidence of a change in condition \r\n  of the boat is that it has a few scratches on the hull.Â  We hold a jury could \r\n  find Weldon revoked his acceptance within a reasonable time after he discovered \r\n  or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change \r\n  in condition of the boat that was not caused by its own defects. \r\nThe trial court also found as a matter \r\n  of law Weldon did not effectively revoke acceptance because he continued to \r\n  exert an ownership interest over the boat.Â  We disagree with this finding.Â  \r\n\r\nWhen Weldon left the boat at Tiger Town \r\n  for several weeks during the summer of 2001, Tiger Town threatened to charge \r\n  him rent for storing the boat if he did not collect it.Â  In his letter revoking \r\n  acceptance dated August 15, 2001, Weldon notified Tiger that he would maintain \r\n  possession of the boat pending a full refund.Â  There is no evidence in the record \r\n  Weldon continued to use the boat except for testing it for additional problems.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find a jury could reasonably conclude Weldon had effectively \r\n  tendered the boat to Tiger Town.Â  \r\nWe furthermore find Weldon presented evidence \r\n  sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the alleged \r\n  nonconformity of the boat substantially impaired its value to Weldon.Â  Whether \r\n  the goods have a nonconformity that substantially impairs the value of the goods \r\n  to the buyer is a subjective test.Â  Herring v. Home Depot, 350 S.C. 373, \r\n  380, 565 S.E.2d 773, 776 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In addition, this is a question of \r\n  law rather than of fact.Â  Burris v. Lake Wylie Marina, Inc., 285 S.C. \r\n  614, 615, 330 S.E.2d 559, 560 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  As listed above, Weldon has \r\n  experienced numerous problems with the boat.Â  He stated in an affidavit, â€œThe \r\n  repetitive nature of the electrical problems makes me [wary] about whether or \r\n  not these problems have been or could be fixed.Â  The unrepaired problems and \r\n  the multiple continuing problems substantially impair the value of the boat \r\n  to me.â€Â Â  We find a jury issue exists as to whether Weldon has met the subjective \r\n  test to support a cause of action for revocation of acceptance.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold the trial court erred in granting \r\n  Tiger Town summary judgment on Weldonâ€™s claim for revocation of acceptance.Â  \r\n\r\nBreach of Warranty\r\nWeldon contends the trial court erred \r\n  in granting the summary judgment motions of Brunswick and Tracker as to the \r\n  breach of warranty claims.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nUnder the UCC, the parties to a contract for the \r\n  sale of goods may establish exclusive, limited written warranties and limitation \r\n  of damages as a remedy for breach thereof.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-719 (2003).Â  \r\n  The agreement may limit the buyerâ€™s remedies to repair or replacement of nonconforming \r\n  goods or parts, and if such remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, it is \r\n  the sole remedy.Â  Id.Â  In addition, the agreement may limit or exclude \r\n  consequential damages unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nWeldon contends there are genuine issues of material \r\n  fact as to whether Brunswick and Tracker created limited warranties.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œAccording to the prevailing interpretation of \r\n  the Uniform Commercial Code, a disclaimer printed on a label or other document \r\n  and given to the buyer at the time of delivery of the goods is ineffective if \r\n  a bargain has already arisen.â€Â  Gold Kist, Inc. v. Citizens &amp; Southern \r\n  Natâ€™l Bank of S.C., 286 S.C. 272, 277, 333 S.E.2d 67, 70 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  \r\n  However, a disclaimer made after the closing of the sale can be made a binding \r\n  part of the contract if the parties agree to the modification.Â  Id. atÂ  \r\n  277-78, 333 S.E.2d at 71.Â  In order to support an agreement to modify, the evidence \r\n  must reveal that the buyer acquired knowledge of the offered modification and \r\n  had an opportunity to object to it.Â  Id. at 278,Â  333 S.E.2d at 71.\r\nAlthough Weldon signed the bill of sale on February \r\n  28, 2001, he was not given Brunswickâ€™s warranty manual until he picked up the \r\n  boat the next day.Â  Weldon asserts he never received any warranty information \r\n  from Tracker.Â  In Brunswickâ€™s manual, the limited warranty, disclaimer of implied \r\n  warranties, and exclusion of consequential damages appear on page nine, with \r\n  additional information on pages eight, fourteen, and fifteen.Â  Weldon asserted \r\n  in his affidavit, â€œThe warranty was not pointed out to me or discussed with \r\n  me, and it was not until I subsequently looked through these materials that \r\n  I discovered the limited warranty.â€Â  Weldon did return the boat to Tiger Town \r\n  numerous times for repairs, which were made under Brunswickâ€™s and Trackerâ€™s \r\n  warranties.Â  However, a jury could reasonably find that Weldon never agreed \r\n  to be limited to the exclusive remedy of repairing a replacement part.Â  \r\nFurthermore, even if the limited warranties \r\n  of both Brunswick and Tracker are in effect, a genuine issue of material fact \r\n  exists as to whether Weldon may still be entitled to the general remedies provided \r\n  in the UCC.Â  â€œWhere circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail \r\n  of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this act.&quot;Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-719(2) (2003).Â  The official comments to this section \r\n  explain, â€œ[W]here an apparently fair and reasonable clause because of circumstances \r\n  fails in its purpose or operates to deprive either party of the substantial \r\n  value of the bargain, it must give way to the general remedy provisions of this \r\n  Article.â€\r\nâ€œWhere a seller is given a reasonable \r\n  chance to correct defects and the equipment still fails to function properly, \r\n  the buyer is deprived of the benefits of the limited remedy, and it therefore \r\n  fails of its essential purpose.â€Â  Bishop Logging Co. v. John Deere Indus. \r\n  Equip. Co., 317 S.C. 520, 533, 455 S.E.2d 183, 191 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  A jury \r\n  may justifiably find that the warranty operated to deprive the purchaser of \r\n  the substantial value of the bargain where the seller was unable to remedy numerous \r\n  major and minor defects within a reasonable time.Â  Id. at 533-34, 455 \r\n  S.E.2d at 191 (citing Riley v. Ford Motor Co., 442 F.2d 670 (5th Cir. \r\n  1971)).Â  Similarly, the cumulative effect of numerous defects may substantially \r\n  impair the value of the goods to the buyer; thus, the limited warranty fails \r\n  of its essential purpose.Â  Id. at 534, 455 S.E.2d at 191 (citing Murray \r\n  v. Holiday Rambler, Inc., 265 N.W.2d 513 (1978)). \r\nBrunswick and Tracker assert that they have repaired \r\n  every defect in the boat pursuant to the warranties.Â  However, the evidence \r\n  demonstrates that as each repair was made, other defects appeared.Â  Even after \r\n  Weldon brought this action, a problem with the wiring harness was discovered.Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the tilt-trim gauge remains defective.Â  There is evidence in the \r\n  record that responsibility for this defect is shared by Brunswick and Tracker.Â  \r\n  We hold a jury could reasonably find Brunswick and Tracker were unable to remedy \r\n  all of the defects in the boat within a reasonable time and that cumulative \r\n  effect of these numerous defects substantially impaired the value of the boat \r\n  to Weldon.Â  Thus, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the \r\n  limited warranty has failed of its essential purpose.Â  \r\n Finally, Weldon asserts it was premature \r\n  for the trial court to grant summary judgment as to incidental and consequential \r\n  damages.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-719(3) (2003), provides, \r\n  â€œConsequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion \r\n  is unconscionable.â€Â  In Bishop Logging, this court held the exclusion \r\n  of consequential damages must be interpreted in light of the premise of â€œcertainty \r\n  of repairâ€ which underlay the entire contract.Â  317 S.C at 536, 455 S.E.2d at \r\n  192.Â  It noted that while the parties obviously agreed to exclude consequential \r\n  damages in the event that the seller performed its obligation to repair or replace \r\n  defect, the buyer could reasonably have expected to recover consequential damages \r\n  when the defects were never adequately corrected and the limited remedy proved \r\n  ineffectual.Â  Id.Â  The court found â€œthe failure of the limited remedy \r\n  in this case materially altered the balance of risk set by the parties in the \r\n  agreement.â€Â  Id. at 536, 455 S.E.2d at 193.Â Â  Thus, this court concluded \r\n  the trial court was correct in allowing the full array of remedies provided \r\n  by the UCC, including recovery of consequential damages and incidental losses. \r\n  Id. at 536-37, 455 S.E.2d at 193.Â  \r\nIn the present case, we find the issue \r\n  of the validity of the limitation on damages should be remanded with the above \r\n  issues.Â  Depending on the findings of the jury in the above issues, the court \r\n  may find that the â€œcertainty of repairâ€ underlies the limited warranty agreement \r\n  and that the failure of the limited remedy has materially altered the balance \r\n  of risk set by the parties in the agreement, rendering the limitation unconscionable \r\n  and thus unenforceable pursuant to Section 36-2-719(3).\r\nAs we find genuine issues of material \r\n  fact exist as to whether the limited warranties were created, whether such warranties, \r\n  if in existence, have failed as to their essential purpose, and whether the \r\n  limitation of damages is unconscionable, we hold the trial court erred in granting \r\n  Brunswick and Tracker summary judgment on Weldonâ€™s claims for breach of warranty.Â  \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment \r\n  to Brunswick and Tracker on Weldonâ€™s cause of action for revocation is affirmed.Â  \r\n  The grant of summary to Tiger Town on the revocation cause of action is reversed.Â  \r\n  The trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Brunswick and Tracker on Weldonâ€™s \r\n  cause of action for breach of warranty is reversed.Â  The case is remanded to \r\n  the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED AND REMANDED \r\n  IN PART.\r\n ANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-440","title":"In The Interest of: Coby P.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2004-UP-440","description":null,"date":"2004-08-23","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED \r\n  ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n  In The Court of Appeals\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      \r\n        In The Interest of: Coby P., a minor under the age of seventeen, Appellant. \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Greenville County\r\n  Â R.

McCants, III, of Aiken, for Appellants. \r\n        Eric K. Englebardt, of Greenville, for Respondents. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  J. C. and Nancy Lindsey brought actions for negligence, \r\n  trespass, and conversion against their next-door neighbors, Eley and Lisa Vann, \r\n  alleging the Vanns improperly erected a fence on their property. \r\n  [1] Â  The master in equity determined the original boundary between the \r\n  two properties placed the fence on the Vannsâ€™ side of the line, but modified \r\n  the line in favor of the Lindseys based on a finding of acquiescence by the \r\n  Vannsâ€™ predecessors in title.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS \r\nThe Lindseys and Vanns are adjoining property owners in a residential subdivision.Â  \r\n  Both properties front a cul-de-sac with the common boundary running from an \r\n  undisputed northern terminus at the joint rear corner southward to the edge \r\n  of the cul-de-sac.Â  The location of the southern terminus of the boundaryâ€”the \r\n  point on the cul-de-sacâ€”is the point in dispute.Â  \r\n The Vanns constructed a fence along a line southward from the undisputed northern \r\n  terminus to a point on the cul-de-sac that the Lindseys contend is within their \r\n  property line.Â  When the Lindseys brought their action, the Vanns counterclaimed \r\n  for declaratory judgment to determine the true boundary between the properties.Â  \r\n  At trial, the Vannsâ€™ surveyor testified he discovered an older pin buried at \r\n  a different point on the cul-de-sac that he believed was the true southern terminus. \r\n  [2] Â  The Lindseysâ€™ surveyor claimed the southern terminus was at another \r\n  point, 21.34 feet west of the Vannsâ€™ fence, thereby placing the fence well within \r\n  the Lindseysâ€™ property.Â  On cross-examination, the Lindseysâ€™ surveyor admitted \r\n  he did not find any artificial marker similar to the buried pin discovered by \r\n  the Vannsâ€™ surveyor to support his suggested location of the southern terminus.Â  \r\n\r\nThe master determined and held the true southern terminus of the boundary to \r\n  be as testified to by the Vannsâ€™ surveyor and as shown as pin 1 on the Vannsâ€™ \r\n  Exhibit No. 2.Â  The master therefore concluded the original and lawful boundary \r\n  was the line from the undisputed northern terminus to pin 1 on the cul-de-sac, \r\n  resulting in a finding that the fence is located on the Vannsâ€™ property.Â  However, \r\n  the master then concluded that the Vannsâ€™ predecessors in title had acquiesced \r\n  in the Lindseysâ€™ use of at least a portion of the disputed land.Â  Based on this \r\n  finding, the master ordered the boundary line be redrawn so that its southern \r\n  terminus is halfway between the points testified to by the two contending surveyors, \r\n  thereby giving each landowner one-half of the disputed property.Â  This division \r\n  required the Vanns to remove their fence.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nThe Lindseysâ€™ complaint alleged the Vanns trespassed on their land and interfered \r\n  with their peaceable possession, but did not assert a claim of legal title.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the Lindseysâ€™ cause of action is trespass quare clausum fregit.Â  \r\n  Gunterâ€™s Island Hunting Club v. Hucks, 282 S.C. 124, 126, 317 S.E.2d \r\n  470, 472 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œAn action for â€˜trespass quare clausum fregitâ€™ may \r\n  be based upon possession only and not necessarily upon legal title.â€).Â  However, \r\n  the Vanns answered and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment to determine \r\n  the true boundary between the properties.Â  The masterâ€™s order treated the partiesâ€™ \r\n  claims as a boundary dispute, and the Lindseys have not appealed the courtâ€™s \r\n  characterization or treatment of their action.Â  Accordingly, we review this \r\n  case as an equitable matter involving the location of a boundary.Â  Knox v. \r\n  Bogan, 322 S.C. 64, 67, 472 S.E.2d 43, 45 (Ct. App. 1996) (An action to \r\n  settle or fix a boundary may be treated as an equitable matter.); Uxbridge \r\n  Co. v. Poppenheim, 135 S.C. 26, 30-31, 133 S.E. 461, 462 (1926) (holding \r\n  when the plaintiff cannot prove with certainty where a boundary line is to show \r\n  the defendant has overstepped it, ordinary remedies at law are inadequate and \r\n  such a circumstance requires the interposition of equity).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Vanns contend the master erred by modifying the lawful boundary based on \r\n  a finding of acquiescence by their predecessors in title.Â  We agree. \r\nThe master determined pin \r\n  1, unearthed by the Vannsâ€™ surveyor, was the accurate southern terminus of the \r\n  boundary and, as a result, the lawful boundary ran from pin 1 to the undisputed \r\n  northern terminus as shown on the Vannsâ€™ Exhibit No. 2.Â  This finding has not \r\n  been appealed and is, therefore, the law of the case.Â  Lucas v. Rawl Family \r\n  Ltd. Pâ€™ship, Op. No. 25817 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 3, 2004) (Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 18 at 36) (holding the trial judgeâ€™s unappealed ruling is the law \r\n  of the case).Â  \r\nAccordingly, any variation or modification of the true boundary must be based \r\n  on proof of acquiescence by the parties.Â  The master found modification was \r\n  appropriate â€œto reflect the acquiescence of the Vannsâ€™ predecessor in title[.]â€Â  \r\n  He cited the Lindseysâ€™ testimony they had maintained a portion of the disputed \r\n  area since 1977 without any objection from their then neighbors, the Alewines, \r\n  from whom the Vanns purchased their property in 1995. Â The master also \r\n  relied on the Lindseysâ€™ testimony that they planted grass and plants in the \r\n  area where the fence was constructed and Lisa Vannâ€™s testimony that she observed \r\n  the Lindseys mowing and tending the disputed area after they purchased the property \r\n  from the Alewines.Â  However, the court noted the Vanns testified they had also \r\n  performed work in the disputed area.Â  \r\nTo support a finding of acquiescence in this case, all parties, including the \r\n  Lindseys and the Vanns or the Vannsâ€™ predecessors in title, must have recognized \r\n  and accepted the modified boundary line as the true line.Â  See Knox, \r\n  322 S.C. at 71-73, 472 S.E.2d at 48-49 (holding adjoining property ownersâ€™ mutual \r\n  acquiescence in and recognition of a clearly defined boundary line for a long \r\n  period of time is proof of title by acquiescence); see also Klapman \r\n  v. Hook, 206 S.C. 51, 57, 32 S.E.2d 882, 884 (1945) (holding there is a \r\n  conclusive presumption that a certain line recognized and acquiesced in by adjoining \r\n  landowners for a sufficient length of time is the true boundary line).Â  However, \r\n  in this case, the parties have not recognized any clearly defined line and there \r\n  is no evidence in the record to support a finding they mutually recognized and \r\n  acquiesced in the modified boundary line created by the masterâ€™s final order.Â  \r\n  The Lindseys testified at trial and conceded in their brief that they did not \r\n  know the location of the boundary.Â  The Alewines are deceased, and there is \r\n  no testimony that they recognized a clearly defined boundary either.Â  Contrary \r\n  to recognizing the modified boundary drawn by the master, the Vanns testified \r\n  they tended the disputed area and ultimately built the fence within the disputed \r\n  area.Â  Absent evidence of the partiesâ€™ acknowledgment of a clearly defined boundary, \r\n  there can be no acquiescence.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we conclude modification of the lawful boundary line was error, \r\n  and the unappealed finding of the master establishing the boundary line running \r\n  from the undisputed northern terminus southward to the point on the cul-de-sac \r\n  identified as pin 1 on the Vannsâ€™ Exhibit No. 2 is the law of the case.Â  We \r\n  reverse so much of the masterâ€™s order as creates a new boundary and requires \r\n  the Vanns to dismantle their fence.Â  \r\nREVERSED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Â The Lindseys also sued \r\n    the Vannsâ€™ original surveyor, I.

Code Ann. section 57-9-10 \r\n  (1991), seeking to close a highway that adjoined property in the Cliffs at Keowee \r\n  Vineyards subdivision.Â  The trial court found closing the road was in the best \r\n  interest of all concerned, determined the Developer and the Association should \r\n  have title to the road, and required access must remain open to all interested \r\n  in visiting McKinney Chapel.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nDeveloper owned 1,200 acres of land in Pickens County that it developed into \r\n  the Cliffs at Keowee Vineyard subdivision.Â  The Association is an association \r\n  of the property owners within the subdivision, and it owns and maintains all \r\n  the roads and common areas within the subdivision.Â  The subdivision abuts a \r\n  portion of a public road known as Cleo Chapman Highway (the highway).Â  McKinney \r\n  Chapel and cemetery is at the end of the highway.Â  McKinney Chapel is at least \r\n  one hundred years old, and the historic church is maintained by Grace United \r\n  Methodist Church (Grace UMC).Â  Services are held at McKinney Chapel on a monthly \r\n  basis and for special events.Â Â Â  \r\nConcerned about security, Developer and the Association \r\n  (collectively, Respondents) sought to close 14,000 feet of the highway that \r\n  is located within the boundaries of the subdivision.Â  They brought this action \r\n  to close the highway against Pickens County, the South Carolina Department of \r\n  Transportation, and a class of unknown persons who may claim some interest in \r\n  the highway, pursuant to section 57-9-10.Â  The private roads of the subdivision \r\n  connect to the highway within the portion they sought to close.Â  Several other \r\n  landowners, who owned property adjacent to the highway but were not within the \r\n  subdivision, also supported the privatization of the highway.Â  \r\nDot Robertson, Roger D. Gravely and Will Gravely \r\n  (collectively referred to as Appellants) intervened as members of the class \r\n  of persons designated as John Doe or Richard Roe in order to keep the highway \r\n  open to the public for access to the historic chapel and cemetery.Â Â  \r\nShortly after petitioning to close the highway, \r\n  Developer and Grace UMC reached an agreement regarding public access to the \r\n  chapel and cemetery if the highway were closed.Â  The agreement: granted Respondents \r\n  the right to construct a security gate to control access to the highway; granted \r\n  visitors and guests to the chapel and cemetery a nonexclusive perpetual easement \r\n  over the highway; and provided that Developer would maintain the chapel and \r\n  cemetery grounds.Â  The agreement also provided that visitors could access the \r\n  chapel and cemetery at any time and on any day by informing the guard at the \r\n  security gate of their destination; there would be no registration requirement.Â  \r\n\r\nJust prior to the filing of the petition, Pickens County passed a resolution \r\n  calling for access to the chapel.Â  It provided:\r\n \r\n  NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT Pickens County is opposed to the gating \r\n    for private development of all state roads and of county arterial and collector \r\n    roads.Â  Where public roads are closed, provision must be made to allow public \r\n    access to significant cultural and natural resources that have traditionally \r\n    been provided to residents of Pickens County.\r\n  BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Pickens County requests that any access agreement \r\n    for Cleo Chapman Highway be irreversible and subject to periodic review to \r\n    assure that access provisions are maintained in good faith.Â  \r\n\r\nPickens County Res. No. 01-15.Â Â Â  \r\nAt trial, Respondents provided evidence of vandalism \r\n  and other crimes that have occurred along the portion of the highway they sought \r\n  to close.Â  They detailed the litter problems resulting from people traveling \r\n  the highway.Â  Respondents provided evidence of another development in which \r\n  they were successfully allowing access to an active church down a closed road \r\n  behind the developmentâ€™s security gate.Â  \r\nMany of the other landowners who own property adjacent \r\n  to the closed portion of the highway testified regarding the impact on their \r\n  property.Â  Several echoed the sentiment that the gate would decrease vandalism, \r\n  crime, and litter.Â  They further testified that their property values would \r\n  be enhanced by the addition of the gate.Â  \r\nAppellants appeared pro se at the \r\n  hearing.Â  They testified that closing the highway would unnecessarily restrict \r\n  access to the chapel.Â  They provided testimony from individuals who would feel \r\n  uneasy having to go through the gate in order to access the chapel.Â  Appellants \r\n  presented a petition signed by 4,000 individuals opposed to closing the highway \r\n  because it might inhibit public access to the chapel.Â  \r\nThe trial court recognized the importance of maintaining \r\n  public access to the chapel and cemetery.Â  The court found the agreement allowed \r\n  access to the chapel, did not unnecessarily restrict the movements of those \r\n  seeking to visit, and was not contrary to the Pickens County resolution.Â  The \r\n  agreement was incorporated into the final order such that if Respondents violated \r\n  the terms, it would be a violation of the order.Â  \r\nIn determining whether to close the highway, the \r\n  trial court considered the petition opposing the closing signed by 4,000 local \r\n  residents.Â  However, the court found the residents signing the petition were \r\n  not aware that they would be given permanent access to the chapel.Â  The court \r\n  also found the closing of the highway pursuant to the terms of the agreement \r\n  would be in the best interest of all concerned.Â  The court determined the security \r\n  of the area would be enhanced and the property owners in the area would not \r\n  be adversely affected.Â  Finally, the court found that title to the highway would \r\n  be vested in Respondents.Â  \r\nAppellants filed a pro se post-trial petition for reconsideration.Â  \r\n  The trial court held the petition was â€œfatally flawedâ€ because it was not served \r\n  upon the DOT and affirmed its prior findings on the merits.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe parties dispute whether a legal or equitable standard of review should \r\n  be applied.Â  Our supreme court has analyzed a trial courtâ€™s decision to close \r\n  a road pursuant to statute under an abuse of discretion standard.Â  First \r\n  Baptist Church of Mauldin v. City of Mauldin, 308 S.C. 226, 229, 417 S.E.2d \r\n  592, 594 (1992) (finding that in light of the evidence in the record supporting \r\n  the road closing, the trial court properly considered the publicâ€™s interest \r\n  as required by statute and no abuse of discretion occurred).Â  An abuse of discretion \r\n  occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled \r\n  by an error of law.Â  Ledford v. Pa. Life Ins. Co., 267 S.C. 671, 675, \r\n  230 S.E.2d 900, 902 (1976).Â  Accordingly, we will reverse the courtâ€™s decision \r\n  to close the highway only if the decision is unsupported by the evidence.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n \r\nI.Â  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred in: (1) ruling that their post-trial \r\n  motion for reconsideration was fatally flawed because it was not served upon \r\n  the DOT; and (2) making this ruling sua sponte.Â  Respondents assert that \r\n  because Appellants failed to serve the DOT, their post-trial motion did not \r\n  toll the time period for filing their notice of appeal, and, thus, this court \r\n  does not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.Â  \r\nIn order to perfect an appeal to this court, a party must serve the notice \r\n  of appeal on all parties within thirty days of receipt of the written notice \r\n  of final order or judgment.Â  Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR.Â  When a party files a timely \r\n  post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (j.n.o.v.) pursuant \r\n  to Rule 50(b), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rules 52 and \r\n  59, SCRCP, or for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, the time period for \r\n  filing the notice of appeal is tolled until receipt of written notice of the \r\n  order granting or denying the post-trial motion.Â  Id.Â  The timely service \r\n  of the notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement, and the appellate courts \r\n  have no authority to â€œextend or expand the time in which the notice of appeal \r\n  must be served.â€Â  Mears v. Mears, 287 S.C. 168, 169, 337 S.E.2d 206, \r\n  207 (1985) (interpreting former Supreme Court Rule 1, Â§Â§ 1 A and 1 C).Â  The \r\n  failure to timely serve the notice of appeal â€œdivests this court of subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction and results in dismissal of the appeal.â€Â  Canal Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Caldwell, 338 S.C. 1, 5, 524 S.E.2d 416, 418 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nIn the present case, Appellants intervened as defendants in Respondentsâ€™ suit \r\n  against Pickens County, the DOT, and other unknown persons claiming some right \r\n  or interest in the particular section of the highway they sought to close.Â  \r\n  Although named as a defendant in the action, the DOT filed an answer expressing \r\n  that it had no objection to the closing of that section of the highway.Â  After \r\n  answering the complaint, the DOT notified Respondentsâ€™ counsel that it would \r\n  not appear at the hearing, and DOT did not appear further in the action.Â  Appellants \r\n  timely filed their pro se motion for reconsideration pursuant \r\n  to Rules 52(b) and 59(a) and (e), SCRCP.Â Â  However, Appellants failed to serve \r\n  their co-defendant, the DOT, with the motion. \r\nIn ruling on the post-trial motion, the trial court \r\n  noted that Rule 5, SCRCP, requires that every written motion must be served \r\n  on all parties not in default.Â  Rule 5, SCRCP (â€œEvery . . . written motion . \r\n  . . shall be served upon each of the parties; but no service need be made on \r\n  parties in default for failure to appear. . . .â€).Â  The court found, sua \r\n  sponte, that Appellantsâ€™ failure to serve the DOT with the post-trial motion \r\n  pursuant to Rule 5 was a â€œfatal errorâ€ that rendered Appellantsâ€™ post-trial \r\n  motion untimely and of â€œno effect.â€Â  The court alternatively denied Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  post-trial motion on the merits.Â  Appellants filed their notice of appeal within \r\n  thirty days after receiving written notice of the order denying their motion \r\n  for reconsideration.Â Â  \r\nRegardless of whether the trial court erred in ruling on this issue sua \r\n  sponte, we find the court erred in its interpretation of the effect of Rule \r\n  5, SCRCP.Â  Although Rule 5 does require service of motions on all parties to \r\n  an action, nothing in the rule indicates that failure to serve all parties is \r\n  a jurisdictional requirement, rendering the motion of â€œno effect,â€ or as if \r\n  it had never been filed.Â  The trial court still had jurisdiction to hear post-trial \r\n  motions timely filed in the case.Â  See Farmer v. Monsanto Corp., \r\n  353 S.C. 553, 557, 579 S.E.2d 325, 327 (2003) (â€œSubject matter jurisdiction \r\n  is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings \r\n  in question belong.â€) (citing Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, \r\n  237-238, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994)); see also State v. Brown, \r\n  358 S.C. 382, 387, 596 S.E.2d 39, 41 (2004) (holding that where a defendant \r\n  failed to file his notice of appeal within ten days of his magistrate court \r\n  conviction, the failure to comply with the procedural requirements divested \r\n  the circuit court of appellate jurisdiction, not the subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to hear and determine that class of appeal).Â  \r\nClearly, failure to serve a particular party with \r\n  a motion or order adverse to that partyâ€™s rights would render it ineffective \r\n  against that party.Â  See, e.g., Connor v. City of Forest Acres, \r\n  348 S.C. 454, 461-62, 560 S.E.2d 606, 609-10 (2002) (noting that service of \r\n  the notice of intent to appeal is a jurisdictional requirement, and the failure \r\n  to serve particular parties meant they were not part of the appeal); Universal \r\n  Benefits, Inc. v. McKinney, 349 S.C. 179, 183, 561 S.E.2d 659, 661 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2002) (noting that judgments should not be issued without notice to a party \r\n  whose rights are affected, the court stated that â€œa person against whom a judgment \r\n  or order is taken without notice may rightly ignore it and may assume that no \r\n  court will enforce itâ€ against him).Â  However, the rules do not indicate that \r\n  failure to serve one party renders the motion untimely or completely ineffective \r\n  against the other parties served.Â  \r\nWe see no prejudice where, as in the present case, \r\n  the party not served with a post-trial motion was disinterested in the action.Â  \r\n  The DOT did not contest Respondentsâ€™ petition and did not appear at the hearing \r\n  to voice opposition to Appellantsâ€™ position.Â  Because the DOT was not interested \r\n  in asserting any rights in the matter, its substantial rights were not prejudiced \r\n  by the lack of its presence at the post-trial hearing. [1] Â  Brown v. Mickens, 256 S.C. 346, 348, \r\n  182 S.E.2d 417, 417-18 (1971) (â€œGenerally, a party interested in resisting \r\n  the relief sought by a motion has a right to notice sufficient to give him an \r\n  opportunity to be heard.â€) (emphasis added); see Nishitani v. Baker, \r\n  921 P.2d 1182, 1192-93 (Haw. Ct. App. 1996) (noting that although plaintiffs \r\n  violated Hawaii Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 5(a) by failing to serve the defendants \r\n  with notice of substitution, the court concluded that â€œsuch failure did not \r\n  affect Defendantsâ€™ substantial rights and was, thus, harmless errorâ€).Â  \r\nAlthough Appellants violated Rule 5 by failing to serve \r\n  the DOT with notice of the post-trial motion, there is no evidence that the \r\n  DOTâ€™s substantial rights were prejudiced.Â  Thus, the motion was timely filed \r\n  and served upon the interested parties in the action.Â  Accordingly, the trial \r\n  court erred in finding the failure to serve the DOT rendered the post-trial \r\n  motion ineffective.Â  \r\nWe now turn to the question of whether Appellantsâ€™ appeal was timely.Â  Because \r\n  we have already determined that Appellantsâ€™ post-trial motion was timely, the \r\n  motion tolled the time period for filing their notice of appeal until after \r\n  receipt of the order denying the motion.Â  Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR.Â  Appellants \r\n  served their notice of appeal within thirty days of receipt of the order denying \r\n  the motion.Â  Accordingly, their notice of appeal was timely and this court has \r\n  jurisdiction to hear the appeal. \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Closing of the Highway\r\nAppellants argue the trial court misconstrued the facts and erred in closing \r\n  the highway.Â  We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion because there \r\n  is sufficient evidence in the record to support the courtâ€™s decision.\r\nSection 57-9-10 provides: â€œAny interested person, the State or any of its political \r\n  subdivisions or agencies may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to abandon \r\n  or close any street, road or highway whether opened or not.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 57-9-10 (1991).Â  The determination is controlled by a best interest standard: \r\n  â€œIf the court shall determine that it is to be the best interest of all concerned \r\n  that such street, road or highway be abandoned or closed, the court shall then \r\n  determine in whom the title thereto shall be vested and issue an appropriate \r\n  order.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-9-20 (1991).\r\n The South Carolina Supreme Court addressed the appropriate interest to be \r\n  considered in closing a road: \r\n\r\n  A public street may not be vacated for the sole purpose of benefiting an \r\n    abutting owner.Â  However, the mere fact that the vacation was at the instigation \r\n    of an individual who owns abutting property does not invalidate the vacation \r\n    or constitute abuse of discretion, nor does the fact that some private interest \r\n    may be served incidentally.Â  On the other hand, it must appear clearly that \r\n    no consideration other than that of public interest could have prompted the \r\n    action.Â Â  \r\n\r\nFirst Baptist Church of Mauldin, 308 S.C. \r\n  at 229, 417 S.E.2d at 594 (citations omitted).\r\nThe reasons proposed by Respondents for closing the portion of the highway \r\n  included: safety of residents of the development and other landowners; a need \r\n  to decrease vandalism in the area; and a need to reduce other crimes occurring \r\n  along the highway.Â  Respondents also noted that McKinney Chapel would be protected \r\n  from vandalism by closing the highway.Â  \r\nSeveral landowners and other individuals testified \r\n  regarding the vandalism of property along the highway.Â  Deputy Dewey Smith of \r\n  the Pickens County Sheriffâ€™s Department testified that the Sheriffâ€™s Department \r\n  would not be able to provide adequate security for the residents of the development \r\n  because of its location and distance from the Sheriffâ€™s Office. While many landowners \r\n  abutting the highway testified that their property values would increase after \r\n  the closing, they also explained one of the main reasons for closing the highway \r\n  would be to provide better security to landowners and the chapel.Â Â  \r\nJim Anthony, president of the Developer, testified \r\n  that reports of vandalism and other serious crimes had decreased as a result \r\n  of hiring security personnel, but he and landowners in the development sought \r\n  to close the highway to increase security.Â  Anthony admitted that closing the \r\n  highway and increasing security would increase the value of the property within \r\n  the development and along the closed portion of the highway.Â  Anthony also detailed \r\n  his experience in operating another gated road, which provided access to an \r\n  active church under an agreement with the church for ten years without a problem. \r\n\r\nBoth Anthony and Joe Durham, Chairman of the Board \r\n  of Trustees of Grace UMC, testified regarding the agreement to allow access \r\n  to McKinney Chapel and cemetery.Â  Both believed the gate would increase security \r\n  for the chapel and help preserve it as a historical or tourist location. \r\nSeveral individuals with ties to the chapel or \r\n  cemetery expressed concerns that a gate would restrict access or intimidate \r\n  people wishing to visit McKinney Chapel or cemetery.Â  Thomas Watson testified \r\n  that he was followed to the chapel by a man in an unmarked car who observed \r\n  him for an extended period of time.Â  He feared that if the gate is erected and \r\n  visitors to the chapel are monitored, it would be very intimidating.Â  Finally, \r\n  Dot Robertson testified regarding the history of McKinney Chapel, expressed \r\n  concerns regarding the publicâ€™s access to the historical site, and presented \r\n  a statement from the Sierra Club expressing their concern over the possible \r\n  loss of public access to the church.Â  \r\nPatrick Bryant presented the court with a petition \r\n  signed by 4,000 people in both Pickens and Oconee counties opposing the closing \r\n  of the highway.Â  It is not clear whether the individuals signing the petition \r\n  knew of the agreement between Developer and Grace UMC to provide access to McKinney \r\n  Chapel.Â  However, Bryant testified he still believed persons wanting to visit \r\n  the chapel through the gate would be prevented from doing so, notwithstanding \r\n  the agreement.Â  \r\nIt is clear that the trial court was concerned \r\n  about restricting access to the chapel.Â  However, we find, based upon the evidence \r\n  presented at trial, the court appropriately considered the benefits and detriments \r\n  to everyone involved.Â  The agreement between Developer and Grace UMC provides \r\n  substantial access to anyone wishing to visit the chapel or cemetery.Â  Although \r\n  the court expressed some concern regarding how the agreement would be enforced, \r\n  the agreement was ultimately incorporated in the court order so that any violation \r\n  of the agreement could be considered contempt of the court order and appropriate \r\n  sanctions would apply.Â Â  \r\nNevertheless, Appellants argue that the trial court \r\n  erred in finding the agreement did not violate the Pickens County resolution \r\n  because bringing a contempt action would be burdensome.Â  The evidence supports \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s finding that the agreement allows unfettered access, complies \r\n  with the resolution, and provides an appropriate remedy in the nature of a contempt \r\n  action.Â  \r\nThe evidence also supports a finding that security \r\n  in the development and at the chapel would be increased by closing the highway \r\n  and installing the security gate.Â  There was uncontested testimony that the \r\n  Developer had successfully operated a security gate in another development that \r\n  still allowed unfettered access for members of an existing church inside the \r\n  gate.Â  The trial court properly considered the interests of all persons concerned, \r\n  and more importantly the public at large, in rendering its decision.Â  \r\nFinally, Appellants argue the trial court erred in discounting the petition \r\n  signed by 4,000 residents opposing the highway closing.Â  The trial court specifically \r\n  held that it believed the persons signing the petition were unaware they would \r\n  be given permanent access to the chapel.Â  It does appear that the petition was \r\n  circulated prior to execution of the agreement providing access between the \r\n  Developer and Grace UMC.Â  Thus, the trial court did not err in this finding.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court rendered its decision to close \r\n  the Highway after carefully considering the interests of the public.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find no abuse of discretion in the courtâ€™s decision to close the portion \r\n  of the highway at issue.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Title to the Closed Highway\r\nAppellants maintain the trial court erred in vesting title in Respondents once \r\n  it determined the highway should be closed.Â  We disagree.\r\nFirst, Appellants lack standing to assert the trial \r\n  court improperly transferred title to Respondents.Â  Appellants contend the rightful \r\n  owner is the DOT.Â  However, Appellants have not asserted any right to the property \r\n  or claim title should have been vested in them.Â  â€œA party cannot appeal from \r\n  a decision which does not affect his or her interest, however erroneous and \r\n  prejudicial it may be to some other personâ€™s rights and interests.â€Â  Beaufort \r\n  Realty Co. v. Beaufort County, 346 S.C. 298, 301, 551 S.E.2d 588, 589-90 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  DOT, and not Appellants, would be the appropriate party to \r\n  appeal this determination.\r\nEven if Appellants had standing to raise the issue, \r\n  the trial court properly transferred title to Respondents.Â  The road closing \r\n  statute provides that once a court determines that closing a road is in the \r\n  public interest, it may determine in whom title should be vested.Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 57-9-20 (1991).Â  The power to declare ownership of the closed road does \r\n  not grant the court the power to create or destroy a fee simple interest in \r\n  the property.Â  The court may only declare who owns legal title.Â  Hoogenboom \r\n  v. City of Beaufort, 315 S.C. 306, 318-19, 433 S.E.2d 875, 884 (Ct. App. \r\n  1992).Â  Further, â€œin the absence of some statutory disposition, abandonment \r\n  or vacation of a public street vests absolute possession and title in the abutting \r\n  property owners. . . .â€Â  City of Greenville v. Bozeman, 254 S.C. 306, \r\n  317-18, 175 S.E.2d 211, 216 (1970).Â Â  \r\nIn its answer, Pickens County stated that it had never owned or maintained \r\n  any portion of the highway.Â  DOT noted in its answer that the land which later \r\n  became the highway came within the state highway system in approximately 1940.Â  \r\n  Appellants presented DOT documents at trial dating back to 1939.Â  The documents \r\n  all indicated that DOT had a right-of-way over the highway, not fee simple title.Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn its order, the trial court referred to DOT as the \r\n  â€œownerâ€ of the highway.Â  Nevertheless, after determining that closing the highway \r\n  would benefit the public, the court vested title in the highway to Respondents.Â  \r\n  In their post-trial motion, Appellants alleged the trial court erred in vesting \r\n  ownership in Respondents after finding the DOT was title owner of the highway.Â  \r\n  In the order denying the post-trial motion, the trial court clarified its prior \r\n  order stating that the evidence supported a finding that the DOT owned only \r\n  a right-of-way over the property, and thus, the title to the property was correctly \r\n  vested in the abutting landowners. \r\nThe evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s determination.Â  Although the initial \r\n  order closing the highway mistakenly refers to DOT as the â€œowner,â€ all the evidence \r\n  supports the trial courtâ€™s subsequent order that the DOT owned only a right-of-way.Â  \r\n  Therefore, title to the property upon closing the highway was correctly vested \r\n  in Respondents as abutting landowners.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court \r\n  did not abuse its discretion in transferring title in the closed portion of \r\n  the highway to Respondents.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in closing a portion of \r\n  the highway.Â  The evidence in the record supports the finding that, while it \r\n  did benefit adjoining landowners, it would also be in the best interest of the \r\n  public.Â  Additionally, we hold the court properly transferred title in the closed \r\n  portion of the highway to Respondents.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial \r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Interestingly, the DOT has not filed a brief in this appeal to complain \r\n    about its lack of notice of the post-trial hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-460","title":"State v.

Richardson, \r\n          and Assistant Attorney General David Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n          Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jimmy Donald Meggs, Jr., was \r\n  convicted of two counts of engaging a child for sexual performance and two counts \r\n  of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.Â  Meggs appeals, arguing the trial \r\n  court erred in: (1) allowing testimony regarding prior bad acts; and (2) excluding \r\n  evidence.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nMeggs was the organizer and leader of a paintball league in Pamplico, South \r\n  Carolina.Â  In order to get the paintball league established, Meggs claimed he \r\n  was a captain in the National Guard and the league was associated with the military.Â  \r\n  The organization was named the â€œVanguard Knights,â€ though it had no affiliation \r\n  with the actual organization by that name.Â  Meggs portrayed the league to parents \r\n  as a way to instill discipline in boys.Â  The boys were given paintball guns, \r\n  wore military fatigues, had ranks, were responsible for chores, and would participate \r\n  in military drills including marching.Â  According to several children, any child \r\n  not obeying orders was shot at close range with a paintball gun.Â  The paintball \r\n  games were held on weekends, and some of the participants would camp overnight \r\n  in tents in the field. \r\nThe victims, nine-year-old twins A.B. and B.B. \r\n  [2] , participated in the league and spent several nights in the field.Â  \r\n  Merline Buntin, an employee of the cafeteria where the victims attended school, \r\n  took A.B. and B.B. to school and church.Â  On one occasion, A.B. told her that \r\n  he was subjected to sexual misconduct.Â  Buntin informed the victimsâ€™ mother.Â  \r\n  Meggs was subsequently arrested and charged with two counts of engaging a child \r\n  for sexual performance and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of \r\n  a minor. \r\nPrior to trial, the parties disagreed over whether the State could present \r\n  the testimony of four additional children.Â  The trial court held an in \r\n  camera hearing.Â  The defense objected to the testimony because it included \r\n  evidence of bad acts not substantially similar to the charges.Â  After hearing \r\n  the testimony, the court excluded two of the four boysâ€™ testimonies, but the \r\n  court determined the two other boys, D.C. and his brother E.C., could testify.Â  \r\n\r\nDuring the trial, the State offered the testimonies of victims A.B. and B.B.Â  \r\n  A.B. testified Meggs picked them up, and they would spend the whole weekend \r\n  in the field and camp overnight in tents.Â  Both boys testified that, at the \r\n  direction of Meggs, they were required to engage in oral sex with each other \r\n  and with at least one of the other boys in the paintball league.Â  Both A.B. \r\n  and B.B. described how Meggs forced them to simulate a sex act by having one \r\n  boy lie down and place a paintball on his genitals while the other boy would \r\n  be forced to retrieve the paintball with his mouth while doing push-ups over \r\n  the other boy.Â  A.B. and B.B. each separately testified that they would have \r\n  been shot with paintballs for refusing to do as Meggs instructed.Â  According \r\n  to both boys, Meggs would watch as they performed the acts he demanded, but \r\n  he would later tell them he had just been joking.Â  The boys denied that Meggs \r\n  was their motherâ€™s boyfriend and that he ever spent the night at their home.Â  \r\n  Finally, both A.B. and B.B. testified they did not report the incident because \r\n  they were afraid of Meggs.Â Â  \r\nBrothers D.C. and E.C. also testified regarding the incidents at the paintball \r\n  field.Â  Both testified that they witnessed Meggs force A.B. and B.B. to perform \r\n  oral sex and to simulate sex with push-ups.Â  D.C. and E.C. both testified that \r\n  Meggs also made them perform the sex simulation push-ups.Â  Both D.C. and E.C. \r\n  testified that they would be shot if they ever disobeyed an order from Meggs.Â  \r\n\r\n In addition to testifying about the acts Meggs forced D.C., E.C., and victims \r\n  A.B. and B.B. to perform, D.C. testified regarding an incident where Meggs attempted \r\n  to have oral sex with him when he spent one night alone in a tent with Meggs.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nA.B. and B.B.â€™s mother testified she was told of the alleged abuse by Buntin.Â  \r\n  She testified she contacted law enforcement.Â  She stated she had several conversations \r\n  with her sons regarding the incidents, and they said it happened on the weekends \r\n  they were at the paintball field.Â  On cross-examination, the victimsâ€™ mother \r\n  testified Meggs never stayed overnight in her home, never bought groceries for \r\n  her, and never gave her money.Â  She testified she never asked him for money \r\n  and she was not in a relationship with Meggs. \r\nMeggs testified at trial, denying that he ever forced any of the boys to do \r\n  anything sexual or that he ever shot a child with a paintball at close range.Â  \r\n  He admitted lying about his credentials.Â  Meggs sought to show that the victimsâ€™ \r\n  mother was motivated by money, testifying that he had a relationship with her \r\n  and gave her money.Â Â Â  \r\nThe jury found Meggs guilty on all counts.Â  He \r\n  was sentenced to two twenty-year terms of imprisonment on the charges of engaging \r\n  a child in sexual performance.Â  The second twenty-year sentence was suspended \r\n  with five years probation.Â  Meggs was also sentenced to imprisonment for three \r\n  years on each of the counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, to \r\n  be served concurrently with the first twenty-year sentence.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n â€œThe admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of \r\n  the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion.â€Â  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 121, 551 S.E.2d 240, 244 \r\n  (2001).Â  This court recently held that for purposes of admission of evidence \r\n  of prior crimes or misconduct to establish a common scheme or plan, the determination \r\n  of whether the facts surrounding the prior crime or misconduct evidence a common \r\n  scheme or plan is a question of law.Â  State v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, \r\n  326-27, 580 S.E.2d 186, 190 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Prior Bad Acts\r\nMeggs contends the trial court erred by allowing a portion of D.C.â€™s testimony \r\n  into the record because it was unfairly prejudicial and should have been excluded \r\n  as a prior bad act under State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nIn addition to describing the acts Meggs forced victims A.B. and B.B. to perform \r\n  and the â€œpush-upsâ€ he ordered D.C. and E.C. to perform, D.C. testified during \r\n  his in camera testimony that when he was alone with Meggs one \r\n  night, Meggs unzipped his pants, asked him if he was scared, and inched his \r\n  head closer to D.C.â€™s genitals.Â  D.C. stated Meggs later asked him if he could \r\n  perform oral sex on him.Â  At the end of all the in camera testimony, \r\n  Meggs moved to exclude D.C.â€™s testimony, arguing that it did not meet the clear \r\n  and convincing standard in that it did not have a â€œclose similarityâ€ to the \r\n  other acts.Â  The trial court ruled D.C.â€™s testimony could be admitted at trial \r\n  because there was a logical connection between the charged offenses and the \r\n  acts described by D.C.Â  D.C. repeated his testimony regarding the tent incident \r\n  during the trial, without objection.Â Â Â  \r\nThis issue is not preserved for our review on appeal.Â  â€œGenerally, a motion \r\n  in limine seeks a pretrial evidentiary ruling to prevent the disclosure \r\n  of potentially prejudicial matter to the jury.â€Â  State v. Owens, 346 \r\n  S.C. 637, 651, 552 S.E.2d 745, 752 (2001).Â  â€œA pretrial ruling on the admissibility \r\n  of evidence is preliminary and is subject to change based on developments at \r\n  trial.â€Â  Id. at 651, 552 S.E.2d at 752-53.Â  A ruling on a motion in \r\n  limine is usually not final and the losing party must renew his or her \r\n  objection when the evidence is presented.Â  State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. \r\n  502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993); State v. Gagum, 328 S.C. 560, 564-65, \r\n  492 S.E.2d 822, 824 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œUnless an objection is made at the time \r\n  the evidence is offered and a final ruling made, the issue is not preserved \r\n  for review.â€Â  Schumpert, 312 S.C. at 507, 435 S.E.2d at 862.Â  However, \r\n  where the motion is ruled on immediately prior to the introduction of the evidence \r\n  in question and no other testimony is presented to provide a basis for the trial \r\n  court to change its ruling, the ruling is final and no further objection is \r\n  necessary.Â  State v. Tufts, 355 S.C. 493, 497, 585 S.E.2d 523, 525 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003), cert. denied (June 24, 2004); Samples v. Mitchell, \r\n  329 S.C. 105, 109, 495 S.E.2d 213, 215 (Ct. App. 1997); State v. Mueller, \r\n  319 S.C. 266, 268-69, 460 S.E.2d 409, 410-11 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nAlthough Meggs objected to all of D.C.â€™s testimony \r\n  during the in camera hearing, he did not renew his objection during \r\n  D.C.â€™s trial testimony.Â  Five witnesses, including victims A.B. and B.B., testified \r\n  at trial prior to D.C., potentially providing a basis for Meggs to approach \r\n  the trial court again about excluding D.C.â€™s testimony.Â  As Meggs failed to \r\n  object during trial, the issue is not preserved for review on appeal.Â  Schumpert, \r\n  312 S.C. at 507, 435 S.E.2d at 862.\r\nFurther, even assuming the issue was preserved \r\n  and the evidence was improperly admitted, any error was harmless.Â  Whether an \r\n  error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case.Â  In \r\n  re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 62-63, 584 S.E.2d 893, 897 (2003).Â  â€œNo definite \r\n  rule of law governs this finding; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character \r\n  of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985).Â  An \r\n  error is harmless where it could not have reasonably affected the result of \r\n  the trial.Â  Harvey, 355 S.C. at 63, 584 S.E.2d at 897.Â  Thus, an insubstantial \r\n  error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been \r\n  conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion \r\n  can be reached.Â  State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 179, 460 S.E.2d 368, \r\n  371 (1995).\r\nThere was overwhelming evidence to conclusively \r\n  prove Meggsâ€™ guilt.Â  Eyewitnesses testified to the sexual acts directed by Meggs.Â  \r\n  Other witnesses confirmed that the boys had described the various sexual acts.Â  \r\n  Finally, Meggsâ€™ credibility was seriously called into question by his claim \r\n  of being a captain in the National Guard and the deceptive nature of the paintball \r\n  league.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial court to allow D.C.â€™s testimony \r\n  is affirmed.\r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Other Testimony\r\nMeggs contends the trial court erred in refusing to allow his father to testify \r\n  regarding the content of two telephone conversations.Â  He also asserts the court \r\n  erred in refusing to allow him to testify to statements made by the victimsâ€™ \r\n  mother regarding her need for money.Â  We disagree, and find even if the statements \r\n  were improperly excluded, it was harmless error.\r\nA.\r\nMeggs argues the trial court erred in finding his fatherâ€™s testimony regarding \r\n  two telephone conversations was hearsay because they were offered to show a \r\n  relationship between Meggs and the victimsâ€™ mother.Â  \r\nAt trial, Meggsâ€™ father testified that on one occasion, he \r\n  answered a telephone call from the victimsâ€™ mother.Â  He stated that the victimsâ€™ \r\n  mother believed she was talking to Meggs.Â  The State raised hearsay objections \r\n  to the testimony regarding what the victimsâ€™ mother asked Meggsâ€™ father while \r\n  on the phone.Â  After sustaining the hearsay objections, the court held an in \r\n  camera hearing to determine the admissibility of the testimony.Â  \r\nDuring the in camera hearing, Meggsâ€™ counsel argued the purpose \r\n  of the testimony regarding the telephone conversation was to show that the victimsâ€™ \r\n  mother called looking for Meggs.Â  The court allowed Meggs to proffer his fatherâ€™s \r\n  testimony.Â  Meggsâ€™ father testified the victimsâ€™ mother called for Meggs to \r\n  come over to her house.Â  He also testified regarding a second telephone conversation \r\n  in which he â€œpicked up the phone and they [the victimsâ€™ mother and Meggs] were \r\n  arguing.â€Â  Meggsâ€™ father testified the subject of that conversation was â€œ[a]bout \r\n  money.â€Â  The trial court again sustained the objection, finding that the testimony \r\n  regarding both telephone calls was hearsay and that no foundation was properly \r\n  laid for the testimony.Â  The court limited Meggsâ€™ fatherâ€™s testimony before \r\n  the jury to the fact that he heard the victimsâ€™ motherâ€™s voice on the telephone \r\n  two times during the same time period that the victims allege the abuse occurred.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nMeggs testified at trial that he had a sexual relationship with the victimsâ€™ \r\n  mother at the time of the allegations and that he spent the night at her house.Â  \r\n  Meggs stated that when he learned of the victimsâ€™ allegations, he went to the \r\n  motherâ€™s house to find out more information.Â  When asked if the victimsâ€™ mother \r\n  discussed the allegations with him, Meggs stated that the only thing the mother \r\n  wanted to discuss was money, and she told Meggs she needed money.Â  Although \r\n  the court sustained the Stateâ€™s hearsay objection to this testimony, the State \r\n  did not move to strike and the jury was not instructed to disregard it.Â  Meggs \r\n  went on to testify that he provided between $2,000 and $3,000 in financial support \r\n  to the victimsâ€™ mother for bills and groceries. \r\nAlthough Meggs argues his fatherâ€™s excluded statements \r\n  were not hearsay because they were asserted to show a relationship between Meggs \r\n  and the victimsâ€™ mother, the record does not reflect that he advanced that reason \r\n  for admission at trial.Â  See State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, \r\n  646, 576 S.E.2d 168, 174 (2003) (holding that an argument not raised before \r\n  the trial court was not preserved for appellate review).Â  Moreover, we find \r\n  that even assuming the statements were improperly excluded, it constituted harmless \r\n  error.Â  The improper exclusion of evidence is harmless where the evidence is \r\n  merely cumulative to other evidence properly admitted.Â  State v. Ferguson, \r\n  300 S.C. 408, 411, 388 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1990) (finding the trial judgeâ€™s refusal \r\n  to admit a statement was harmless error where it was cumulative to other testimony).Â  \r\n  Meggs testified he had a relationship with the victimsâ€™ mother and that he spent \r\n  the night at her house.Â  Thus, exclusion of the fatherâ€™s testimony was not error \r\n  under the particular facts of this case.\r\nB.\r\nMeggs also asserts the trial court erred in excluding \r\n  his fatherâ€™s testimony and his testimony regarding the motherâ€™s demand for money \r\n  because it showed the victimsâ€™ mother made a prior inconsistent statement and \r\n  had a motive to encourage her children to lie.Â  Although the victimsâ€™ mother \r\n  denied having a relationship with Meggs and ever receiving money from him, Meggs \r\n  testified he gave her money and that it was not in the form of a loan.Â  Thus, \r\n  evidence was admitted that Meggs provided money to the victimsâ€™ mother.Â  Further, \r\n  the evidence of Meggsâ€™ guilt was overwhelming.Â  Several eyewitnesses testified \r\n  regarding the acts the victims were required to perform.Â  Other witnesses testified \r\n  that the boys told them of the acts and the stories were consistent.Â  Additionally, \r\n  as argued by the State, Meggs never laid a proper foundation under Rule 613(b), \r\n  SCRE, for admission of the fatherâ€™s testimony because the victimsâ€™ mother was \r\n  never given details of the statement or the opportunity to admit or deny the \r\n  statement. [3] Â  Finally, Meggsâ€™ \r\n  credibility was suspect as he admitted lying regarding his service in the National \r\n  Guard and in his credentials.Â  \r\nThe excluded testimony was cumulative to other \r\n  testimony in the record, and, in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt, \r\n  it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the decision of the trial court to exclude the testimony is affirmed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe evidence supporting Meggsâ€™ guilt was overwhelming.Â  Thus, any error in \r\n  excluding Meggsâ€™ and his fatherâ€™s testimony regarding the victimsâ€™ mother was \r\n  harmless.Â  Because Meggs did not renew his objection to D.C.â€™s testimony at \r\n  the time it was offered, Meggs failed to preserve the prior bad act issue for \r\n  appeal.Â  Accordingly, Meggsâ€™ convictions and sentences are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Because oral argument would not assist the court in deciding this \r\n    case, we decide it without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Due to the sensitive nature of this case, we assign alternate initials \r\n    to protect the minor victims.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  Rule 613(b), SCRE, provides \r\n    as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness \r\n    is not admissible unless the witness is advised of the substance of the statement, \r\n    the time and place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom it was made, \r\n    and is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement.Â  If a witness \r\n    does not admit that he has made the prior inconsistent statement, extrinsic \r\n    evidence of such statement is admissible.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
