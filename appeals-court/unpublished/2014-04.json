Bowman appeals his convictions for first-degree\r\nburglary, armed robbery, kidnapping, common law assault and battery of a high\r\n\nand aggravated nature, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a\r\nviolent crime, arguing the circuit court erred in (1) closing the courtroom for the\r\ntestimony of certain State witnesses and (2) admitting two photographic lineup\r\nidentifications. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities:\r\n\r\n1. As to Bowman's argument regarding closing of the courtroom: State v. Carlson,\r\n363 S.C. 586, 595, 611 S.E.2d 283, 287 (Ct. App. 2005) (\"An issue may not be\r\nraised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to the [circuit court]\r\nto be preserved for appellate review.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); State v.\r\nPrioleau, 345 S.C. 404, 411, 548 S.E.2d 213, 216 (2001) (\"In order to preserve for\r\nreview an alleged error[,] an objection should be sufficiently specific to bring into\r\nfocus the precise nature of the alleged error so it can be reasonably understood by\r\nthe [circuit court].\"); In the Matter of Care & Treatment of Corley, 365 S.C. 252,\r\n258, 616 S.E.2d 441, 444 (Ct. App. 2005) (\"Constitutional issues, like most others,\r\nmust be raised to and ruled on by the [circuit] court to be preserved for appeal.\").\r\n\r\n2. As to Bowman's argument regarding the photographic lineups:\r\nState v. Traylor, 360 S.C. 74, 81, 600 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2004) (\"A criminal\r\ndefendant may be deprived of due process of law by an identification procedure\r\nwhich is unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken\r\nidentification.\"); State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 287, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447 (2000)\r\n(noting the two-prong inquiry requiring the circuit court to determine (1) whether\r\nthe identification process was unduly suggestive and if so, (2) whether the out-of-\r\ncourt identification process was nevertheless so reliable that no substantial\r\nlikelihood of misidentification existed); State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 326, 339, 422\r\nS.E.2d 133, 141 (1992), overruled on other grounds by Brightman v. State, 336\r\nS.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d 614 (1999) (finding that a police officer's instruction to a\r\nwitness to \"see if she recognized anyone\" did not render the lineup unduly\r\nsuggestive because there was no suggestion the \"officer in any manner insinuated\r\nwhich photograph belonged to [the defendant]\" and \"the [witness] was [clearly]\r\naware that the reason she was requested to view the photographic lineup was\r\nbecause the police had a suspect\"); Clark v. State, 515 S.E.2d 155, 162 (Ga. 1999)\r\n(finding that, while a police officer displaying a lineup to a victim or witness\r\nshould avoid telling the person that the lineup contains the suspect, \"such a\r\nstatement does not make a lineup impermissibly suggestive since the very fact that\r\na lineup is being conducted suggests that a suspect is contained therein\"); Rimmer\r\nv. State, 825 So. 2d 304, 317 (Fla. 2002) (noting that \"the fact that the police told\r\n\n[the witness] prior to his viewing the physical lineup that they had included a\r\nsuspect in the lineup does not taint [the witness]'s identification\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-133","title":"State v.

Barnette appeals the decision of the circuit court\r\naffirming his conviction in absentia in magistrates court for criminal domestic\r\nviolence (CDV), arguing (1) the circuit court erred in allowing the State to\r\n\nintroduce new evidence during the appeal hearing and (2) the circuit court erred in\r\naffirming the magistrates court's denial of Barnette's motion for a new trial because\r\nthe State offered no evidence that Barnette had notice of the trial date. Initially, we\r\nfind the circuit court erred in admitting evidence not contained in the record and\r\nbasing its decision on that evidence;1 however, we affirm2 because Barnette has not\r\nshown the magistrates court's finding that Barnette received notice is without\r\nevidentiary support and therefore clearly erroneous.\r\n\r\n        The magistrates court made statements prior to trial that Barnette had notice\r\nand was aware the trial could proceed without him and later made written findings\r\nof fact in its return stating specifically that Barnette was notified of the date, time,\r\nand place of his trial and that the trial would proceed in his absence. See City of\r\nAiken v. Koontz, 368 S.C. 542, 547, 629 S.E.2d 686, 689 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"[T]he\r\ntrial [court] must make findings of fact on the record that the defendant (1)\r\nreceived notice of his right to be present; and (2) was warned that the trial would\r\nproceed in his absence should he fail to attend.\"). Additionally, as in Koontz,\r\nBarnette initialed an order specifying the methods and conditions of his release,\r\nwhich informed him of his obligation to appear \"at such other times and places\r\nordered by the court\"; the magistrates court adjudicating Barnette's bail signed a\r\n\"Checklist for Magistrate and Municipal Judges\" stating that it informed Barnette\r\nof his right and obligation to appear for trial and that a waiver of his right to be\r\npresent would result if he failed to attend; the State informed the magistrates court\r\non the record that it sent notices to Barnette at two addresses but the mailings were\r\nreturned with no forwarding address; and Barnette failed to alert the magistrates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 See State v. Hoyle, 397 S.C. 622, 625, 725 S.E.2d 720, 721-22 (Ct. App. 2012)\r\n(\"In a criminal appeal from the magistrate[s] court, the circuit court does not\r\nreview the matter de novo; rather, the court reviews the case for preserved errors\r\nraised by appropriate exception.\"); Rogers v. State, 358 S.C. 266, 270, 594 S.E.2d\r\n278, 280 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"[T]he circuit court, sitting in its appellate capacity, may\r\nnot engage in fact finding.\"); State v. Brown, 358 S.C. 382, 387-88, 596 S.E.2d 39,\r\n41 (2004) (finding error when an appellate court considered facts not included in\r\nthe magistrate's return); id. at 388, 596 S.E.2d at 41 (stating the \"magistrate's\r\nreturn is the official record of trial proceedings\" (citing State v. Barbee, 280 S.C.\r\n328, 313 S.E.2d 297 (1984))).\r\n2 See Rule 220, SCACR (\"The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order,\r\ndecision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.\").\r\n\ncourt or the State to his change of address. See id. at 547-49, 629 S.E.2d at 689-90\r\n(considering similar factors in upholding a conviction in absentia). Finally,\r\nBarnette signed a bond form that warned his trial would proceed despite his\r\nabsence if he failed to appear. See State v. Ravenell, 387 S.C. 449, 456, 692 S.E.2d\r\n554, 558 (Ct. App. 2010) (\"[A] bond form that provides notice that a defendant can\r\nbe tried in absentia may serve as the requisite warning that he may be tried in his\r\nabsence should he fail to appear.\"). Thus, there is evidence to support the\r\nmagistrates court's finding that Barnette received proper notice of his trial. See\r\nState v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 101, 606 S.E.2d 503, 505 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"In\r\ncriminal cases, [this court] sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the\r\nfactual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.\").

Employer argues the\r\nAdministrative Law Court (ALC) erred because: (1) Claimant was an independent\r\ncontractor; and (2) the ALC's decision regarding other sales representatives was an\r\nadvisory opinion, and the evidence in the record proves other sales representatives'\r\nrelationships with Employer were different from Claimant's.

As to whether the family court erred in finding Mother in contempt for failing to\r\npay the GAL's fees: Abate v. Abate, 377 S.C. 548, 553, 660 S.E.2d 515, 518 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2008) (\"Contempt results from a willful disobedience of a court order.\r\nWillful disobedience requires an act to be done voluntarily and intentionally with\r\nthe specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail\r\nto do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either\r\nto disobey or disregard the law. A party seeking a contempt finding for violation\r\nof a court order must show the order's existence and facts establishing the other\r\nparty did not comply with the order.\" (citations and internal quotation marks\r\nomitted)).2\r\n\r\n2. As to whether the family court erred in considering whether to award Father sole\r\ncustody of Child when he did not file an amended complaint: Rule 15(b), SCRCP\r\n(\"When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent\r\nof the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the\r\npleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to\r\nconform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any\r\nparty at any time, even after judgment; but failure so to amend does not affect the\r\nresult of the trial of these issues.\"); Hudson v. Hudson, 340 S.C. 198, 201, 530\r\nS.E.2d 400, 401 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding the mother failed to preserve an issue\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Although Father did not file a brief, we address the merits of the appeal as\r\npresented to this court in Mother's brief. See Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR (providing\r\n\"the appellate court may take such action as it deems proper\" if the respondent fails\r\nto file a brief).\r\n2 Any argument the family court erred in finding Mother in contempt before it\r\nbegan the final hearing is abandoned because Mother does not cite to any\r\nsupporting authority. See Broom v. Jennifer J., 403 S.C. 96, 115, 742 S.E.2d 382,\r\n391 (2013) (\"Issues raised in a brief but not supported by authority may be deemed\r\nabandoned and not considered on appeal.\"). Additionally, Mother claims the\r\nfamily court was biased towards Mother because it found her in contempt.\r\nHowever, this issue is not preserved for our review because Mother never raised\r\nthis issue at trial. See Gaddy v. Douglass, 359 S.C. 329, 350, 597 S.E.2d 12, 23\r\n(Ct. App. 2004) (holding the issue of a trial judge's impartiality cannot be raised\r\nfor the first time on appeal).\r\n\nwhen the record clearly reflected the issue was tried by consent before the family\r\ncourt without objection).\r\n\r\n3. As to whether the family court erred in awarding Father sole custody of Child:\r\nCook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614 (1978) (noting the child's\r\nwelfare and best interest are paramount in determining child custody); Woodall v.\r\nWoodall, 322 S.C. 7, 11, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996) (providing in determining\r\ncustody, \"[t]he family court must consider the character, fitness, attitude, and\r\ninclinations on the part of each parent as they impact the child\"); Parris v.

Harrelson argues (1) lifetime GPS monitoring\r\n\npursuant to section 23-3-540 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2013) is\r\nunconstitutional as a violation of the prohibition against cruel and unusual\r\npunishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and\r\nSouth Carolina Constitution and (2) the plea court violated his procedural due\r\nprocess rights when it failed to hold a hearing before imposing lifetime GPS\r\nmonitoring.

The car failed to stop after the officers activated their blue\r\nlights. Instead, it proceeded at a high speed and ran off the road when it reached\r\nthe corner of a dead-end street. After the car came to a stop, the driver and Wilson\r\nquickly exited on foot. When Wilson jumped from the vehicle, the officers noticed\r\nhe was carrying an object that appeared to be a radio.\r\n\r\nThe driver fled in a different direction and was never caught or identified. Wilson,\r\nhowever, was eventually subdued with the aid of a taser after officers chased him\r\nthrough a wooded path and over several fences.\r\n\r\nAfter placing Wilson under arrest, the officers discovered a plastic box near one of\r\nthe fences that Wilson jumped during the chase. The box contained small pieces of\r\ncrack cocaine. Because the ground underneath the box was muddy but the box\r\nitself was completely dry, the officers surmised the box had been deposited in that\r\nlocation only recently. About twenty feet from the abandoned vehicle, the officers\r\nfound the radio Wilson was carrying. It had wires hanging from the back and was\r\ndry even though it lay atop wet ground. The officers were able to insert the\r\nabandoned radio into an empty space in the vehicle from which the car radio had\r\nbeen removed.\r\n\r\nThe grand jury indicted Wilson for third offense possession of cocaine base. The\r\ncase was called for trial about a year later; however, Wilson did not appear, so he\r\nwas tried in his absence. The jury found Wilson guilty as charged.\r\n\r\nAt issue in this appeal is whether Wilson is entitled to a reversal of his conviction\r\nand a new trial because of the trial court's admission of testimony presented by the\r\nState that he did not give a statement after receiving Miranda warnings. The trial\r\ncourt decided to allow this testimony after hearing the State's proffer and\r\narguments of counsel in the jury's absence. The State has not argued the admission\r\nof this testimony was proper; rather, the focus of the State's response is that\r\nadmission of testimony about Wilson's post-arrest silence was not prejudicial and\r\ntherefore does not amount to reversible error. We agree with the State's position.\r\n\r\n\r\n1   See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n\n\"Disclosure to the jury of an accused's silence at any stage of an interrogation\r\nviolates his constitutional protection against self-incrimination.\" State v. Arther,\r\n290 S.C. 291, 296, 350 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1986) (citing Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S.\r\n610, 619-20 (1976)). \"This violation, however, does not require reversal of a\r\nconviction if a review of the entire record establishes that any error was harmless\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. An error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if\r\nit did not contribute to the verdict obtained. Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 165,\r\n420 S.E.2d 834, 838 (1992) (cited in State v. Kromah, 401 S.C. 340, 360-61, 737\r\nS.E.2d 490, 501 (2013)); see also State v. Henson, Op. No. 27354 (S.C. Sup. Ct.\r\nfiled Jan. 22, 2014) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 3 at 15, 25) (applying the harmless\r\nerror analysis to Confrontation Clause violations and stating that a finding that\r\nsuch an error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt \"requires a court to determine\r\n'whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might\r\nhave contributed to the conviction'\" (quoting Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 86\r\n(1963))).\r\n\r\nIn State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 187-88, 577 S.E.2d 438, 444 (2003), the Supreme\r\nCourt of South Carolina, in affirming the defendant's conviction and rejecting his\r\nargument that a comment by the solicitor implicitly referred to his decision not to\r\ntestify, noted: (1) \"[t]he trial court's instruction to the jury that it could not consider\r\nappellant's failure to testify in any way and could not use it against him cured any\r\npotential error\" and (2) the \"lone remark\" did not taint the trial with unfairness so\r\nas to make Shuler's conviction a denial of due process. Similarly, in the present\r\ncase, the testimony that Wilson did not give a statement after receiving Miranda\r\nwarnings was one isolated remark that was not referred to at any other point in the\r\ntrial. Furthermore, the trial court, when charging the jury, cautioned the jurors not\r\nto consider Wilson's exercise of his right to remain silent during their deliberations.\r\nApplying the analysis in Shuler to the present appeal, we find there was no\r\nreasonable possibility that the reference to Wilson's failure to give a statement after\r\nhe was advised of his Miranda rights might have contributed to his conviction. See\r\nState v. Gates, 269 S.C. 557, 561, 238 S.E.2d 680, 682 (1977) (\"While it is true\r\nthat silence on the part of an accused person may not be used as an inference of\r\nguilt, we are of the opinion that when the evidence introduced by the State is\r\nbalanced against the brief references that appellant remained silent, it is apparent\r\nthat such evidence did not contribute to the verdict in any way.\" (footnote\r\nomitted)).\r\n\nWilson also argues he was prejudiced by the reference to his failure to give a\r\nstatement because it was offered to explain why the police failed to apprehend a\r\ndifferent person who could have been the true dealer of drugs from the abandoned\r\nvehicle. Based on the record before us, however, we found nothing to suggest a\r\nreasonable possibility that apprehension of the driver would have resulted in\r\nWilson's exoneration.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we hold that although the trial court should not have allowed the State\r\nto present testimony that Wilson did not give a statement to law enforcement after\r\nthe police read him his Miranda rights, the admission of this testimony was\r\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, we affirm Wilson's conviction.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-163","title":"Medlin v.

Smalls, of Darryl D. Smalls, Attorney at Law,\r\n            of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n            Andrew Wade Creech, of Elrod Pope Law Firm, of Rock\r\n            Hill, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this workers' compensation matter, Appellant Dan Duly\r\nappeals the decision of the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation\r\n\nCommission awarding Claimant Darrell Leggette workers' compensation benefits\r\nfor an injury he sustained while working for Duly's company, Double D Docks,\r\nLLC (the Company). Duly argues the Appellate Panel erred in (1) determining the\r\nCompany regularly employed four or more employees and, therefore, was subject\r\nto the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act (Act)1; (2) failing to review all\r\nthe relevant evidence; and (3) finding Duly committed fraud. We affirm.\r\n\r\nI.    Four or More Employees\r\nOn April 24, 2010, Leggette suffered an injury while repairing a dock at the\r\nrequest of Dan Duly, owner of the Company. Leggette and his co-worker, James\r\nDay, were using a hydraulic \"thumper\"2 to replace wooden dock poles when Day\r\naccidentally dropped the \"thumper\" on Leggette's right hand, injuring his middle\r\nand index fingers. At issue is whether the Company regularly employed four or\r\nmore employees during the time period relevant to Leggette's injury.\r\n\r\nAn employer subject to the Act is required to pay for medical care and treatment\r\nfor \"employees\" injured \"by accident[s] arising out of and in the course of\r\nemployment.\" S.C. Code Ann. §§ 42-1-160(A), -310 (Supp. 2013). However, the\r\nAct specifically exempts certain employers \"who [have] regularly employed in\r\nservice less than four employees in the same business within the State.\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 42-1-360(2) (Supp. 2013) (emphases added).\r\n\r\nThe determination of whether an employer regularly employs the requisite number\r\nof employees to be subject to the Act is a jurisdictional question. Hernandez-\r\nZuniga v. Tickle, 374 S.C. 235, 244, 647 S.E.2d 691, 695 (Ct. App. 2007); Harding\r\nv. Plumley, 329 S.C. 580, 584, 496 S.E.2d 29, 31 (Ct. App. 1998). This court's\r\nreview of a jurisdictional question is governed by the preponderance of the\r\nevidence standard. Hernandez-Zuniga, 374 S.C. at 242, 647 S.E.2d at 694.\r\n\r\nHere, the preponderance of the evidence reveals that during the relevant time \n\r\nperiod, from mid-March until May 2010, the Company regularly employed four \n\r\nemployees, who worked on various jobs and were paid weekly by Dan Duly. \n\r\nDuring this time, the Company's mode of operation reflected a project-to-project \n\r\nschedule where four employees were paid consistent hourly wages at the end of \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1S.C. Code Ann. §§ 42-1-10 to -19-50 (1985 & Supp. 2013).\n\r\n2A \"thumper\" is a type of hydraulic post-driving machine mounted on a barge that \n\r\nuses a weight-driven system to beat a dock pole into the ground. \n\r\n\neach week after working on assigned projects, including projects such as the \"Lee\"\r\ndock, the \"Jones\" dock, the \"Ziegler\" dock, the \"Colbert job,\" the \"Noble job,\" and\r\nthe \"Lake Rhodiss job.\" See Hernandez-Zuniga, 374 S.C. at 248-51, 647 S.E.2d at\r\n697-99 (recognizing the employer's established mode or plan of operation dictates,\r\nto a large extent, the relevant time period, and both duration and regularity of\r\noccurrence are important factors); see also Hartzell v. Palmetto Collision, LLC,\r\n406 S.C. 233, 242-43, 750 S.E.2d 97, 102 (Ct. App. 2013) (applying five-factor\r\ntest for regularity of employment); Durham v. McLamb, 296 S.E.2d 3, 7 (N.C. Ct.\r\nApp. 1982) (finding the employer regularly employed four employees because,\r\nalthough employees \"worked irregular days and hours, their employment extended\r\nover a period of some four weeks, during which they worked, not by chance or for\r\na particular occasion, but according to a definite employment at hourly wages that\r\nwere paid at the end of each week worked\").\r\n\r\nTherefore, we affirm the decision of the Appellate Panel finding Duly and the\r\nCompany are subject to the Act's jurisdiction because the Company regularly\r\nemployed four employees with some constancy during the relevant time period.\r\n\r\nII.    Failure to Review all of the Relevant Evidence\r\nDuly also argues the Appellate Panel erred because it did not visually inspect\r\nLeggette's fingers before making its decision to award Leggette permanent partial\r\ndisability.\r\n\r\nIt was unnecessary for the Commissioner to examine Leggette's partially-\r\namputated fingers. Because the overwhelming evidence showed Leggette's two\r\nfingers were amputated at the first knuckle, the Appellate Panel's decision was\r\nsupported by substantial evidence. See S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-380(5) (Supp.\r\n2013); cf. Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981)\r\n(\"[T]he award . . . can be set aside only if unsupported by 'substantial evidence.'\").\r\n\r\nIII.   Finding of Fraud\r\nDuly argues the Appellate Panel erred in \"finding\" he committed fraud because\r\nthere is no evidence he committed fraud. The Commissioner did not find Duly\r\ncommitted fraud. Rather, the Commissioner stated it would submit the names of\r\nDuly and the Company to the Attorney General and the Department of Revenue\r\n\"for investigation of fraud and other wrongdoing.\" Therefore, Duly's third claim is\r\nwithout merit.\r\n\nAccordingly, the findings and decision of Appellate Panel are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., SHORT and GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-166","title":"Wider v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy\r\n        Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant\r\n        Attorney General Melody Jane Brown, all of Columbia;\r\n        and Solicitor E.L. Clements, III, of Florence, for\r\n        Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: David Gerrard Johnson appeals his convictions for murder, first-\r\ndegree burglary, armed robbery, possession of a weapon during the commission of\r\na violent crime, and conspiracy, arguing the trial court erred in (1) admitting a\r\nstatement Johnson made to the police and evidence that was the product of this\r\nstatement, (2) finding Johnson knowingly and voluntarily consented to providing\r\nDNA and fingerprint evidence, (3) excusing a juror, and (4) admitting graphic\r\nphotographs of the deceased victim's body. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFamily members of the victim initially became concerned after receiving a call\r\ninforming them the victim failed to show up for work. They went to her home,\r\nwhere they noticed signs of suspicious activity. The police later found the victim's\r\ncar away from her home. Nearby, they found a bag of pillows that tested\r\npresumptive positive for blood.\r\n\r\nAfter additional investigation, police notified Johnson through Johnson's father and\r\n\"word on the street\" that they wanted to speak with him about the victim's\r\ndisappearance. Johnson voluntarily went to the police station and, after waiting\r\nseveral hours, agreed to talk with one of the officers. The officer then read\r\nJohnson his Miranda rights.1 Johnson then proceeded to give several different\r\naccounts about what had happened, but eventually led the police to the victim's\r\nbody. When the officers returned to the police station with Johnson, Johnson again\r\nreceived Miranda warnings, after which he gave a formal statement in which he\r\nadmitted to being in the victim's home when she died and witnessing her death at\r\nthe hand of another individual. He also told police he accompanied other\r\nparticipants in the crime when they removed the victim's body, which they\r\naccomplished by using her car to drive it to a remote location. Johnson also\r\nrevealed that after he and other participants drove the victim's car back to her\r\nhome, he remained inside the car while the others stole items from inside the\r\nresidence. Johnson also showed the police various electronic items that had been\r\ntaken from the victim's home and were being stored at his father's house.\r\n\r\nJohnson later signed a release form authorizing law enforcement to obtain his\r\nfingerprints and a sample of his saliva. Forensics testing showed the victim's blood\r\non the mattress, bed clothes, and furniture in her bedroom. Additional tests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n\nrevealed Johnson's DNA on the steering wheel of the victim's car and his\r\nfingerprints on the driver's side area.\r\n\r\nJohnson was subsequently indicted for murder, first-degree burglary, armed\r\nrobbery, possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, and\r\nconspiracy. A jury found him guilty on all charges.\r\n\r\n1.      Johnson first argues that because of the evidence demonstrating his lack of\r\nmental capacity to make a knowing and voluntary waiver of his constitutional\r\nrights, the trial court should not have admitted the statement he made to the police.\r\nWe hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statement;\r\ntherefore, we affirm the court's ruling. See State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 243,\r\n471 S.E.2d 689, 695 (1996) (\"On appeal, the conclusion of the trial judge as to the\r\nvoluntariness of a confession will not be reviewed unless so erroneous as to show\r\nan abuse of discretion.\"). Here, the trial court, though acknowledging the\r\nprolonged time that Johnson was at the police department before giving his\r\nstatement, noted: (1) there was no undue coercion, threats, or force on the part of\r\nlaw enforcement in procuring the statement; (2) Johnson had come to the police\r\nstation voluntarily; (3) before making his statement, Johnson had been provided\r\nfood, drink, and the opportunity to rest; (4) Johnson had been read his Miranda\r\nrights twice and signed a waiver form; (5) Johnson had previously been through\r\nthe criminal justice system, having entered into guilty pleas in the past; (6) none of\r\nthe officers had reason to believe that Johnson did not understand his rights as read\r\nand explained to him; and (7) Johnson's responses throughout the transcript of his\r\nstatement indicated he understood the questions that the officers asked him.\r\nFurthermore, a clinical psychologist who evaluated Johnson a few months before\r\nhis trial testified that Johnson understood that he should not talk to the solicitor\r\nwithout his attorney being present and could not be forced to talk in court. Even\r\nwith the acknowledgment that Johnson may have had cognitive deficits, there is\r\nevidence to support the trial court's admission of his statement. See State v. Myers,\r\n359 S.C. 40, 47, 596 S.E.2d 488, 492 (2004) (\"A determination whether a\r\nconfession was 'given voluntarily requires an examination of the totality of the\r\ncircumstances.'\" (quoting Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. at 243, 471 S.E.2d at 694-95));\r\nState v.

App. 2007) (\"When\r\nreviewing a trial judge's ruling concerning voluntariness, the appellate court does\r\nnot re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the\r\nevidence, but simply determines whether the trial judge's ruling is supported by\r\nany evidence.\" (citing State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 136, 551 S.E.2d 240, 252\r\n(2001))).\r\n\n2.     Johnson also argues the trial court erred in admitting evidence that was the\r\nproduct of his statement because that evidence was the fruit of the poisonous tree.\r\nBecause, however, Johnson's statement was obtained legally, the admission of any\r\nevidence resulting from the information he provided is not barred by the doctrine\r\nof the fruit of the poisonous tree. See State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 323, 468\r\nS.E.2d 620, 624 (1996) (\"The 'fruit of the poisonous tree' doctrine provides that\r\nevidence must be excluded if it would not have come to light but for the illegal\r\nactions of the police, and the evidence has been obtained by the exploitation of that\r\nillegality.\").\r\n\r\n3.      Johnson also argues the trial court erroneously found he knowingly and\r\nvoluntarily consented to providing the police a DNA sample and fingerprint\r\nstandard, again relying primarily on evidence that he lacked the mental capacity to\r\nmake a knowing and voluntary waiver of this right. Intellectual disability alone,\r\nhowever, does not amount to an inability to give consent, which, like knowledge in\r\na waiver situation, requires a determination based on the totality of the\r\ncircumstances. See State v. Wallace, 269 S.C. 547, 550, 238 S.E.2d 675, 676\r\n(1977) (\"Whether a consent to search was voluntary or the product of duress or\r\ncoercion, express or implied, is a question of fact to be determined from the\r\n'totality of the circumstances.'\"). Here, the trial court, when determining whether\r\nJohnson signed the consent form voluntarily, noted Johnson had held a job and\r\nreceived wages, thus evidencing some ability to understand a request for\r\nfingerprint and DNA evidence. Furthermore, \"our state standard does not require a\r\nlaw enforcement officer conducting a search to inform the defendant of his right to\r\nrefuse consent.\" State v. Forrester, 343 S.C. 637, 645, 541 S.E.2d 837, 841\r\n(2001).\r\n\r\n4.     Johnson next contends he did not receive a fair trial because the trial court\r\nerroneously excused a juror who stated she could be fair and impartial even though\r\nshe knew members of Johnson's family. We find no error in the trial court's\r\ndecision to excuse the juror. By statute, the trial court must make its own\r\ndetermination as to whether a prospective juror should be excused from serving on\r\na particular case and \"[i]f it appears to the court that the juror is not indifferent in\r\nthe cause, he must be placed aside as to the trial of that cause and another must be\r\ncalled.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 14-7-1020 (Supp. 2013); see also State v. Franklin, 267\r\nS.C. 240, 248, 226 S.E.2d 896, 899 (1976) (stating the words \"if it appears to the\r\ncourt,\" as used in a prior version of section 14-7-1020, \"are evidence of discretion\r\nvested in the trial judge\" (citing State v. Faries, 125 S.C. 281, 287, 118 S.E. 620,\r\n\n622 (1923))). Here, even though the juror stated she could be fair, she also\r\nexpressed discomfort about the prospect of having to face Johnson's family if she\r\nwere to sit on a jury that eventually convicted him. Given the juror's hesitation, we\r\nhold the trial court, as required by statute, made an independent finding as to\r\nwhether the juror was genuinely \"indifferent in the cause\" and properly exercised\r\nits discretion in excusing her. See State v. Rogers, 263 S.C. 373, 381, 210 S.E.2d\r\n604, 608 (1974) (stating the \"applicable general rule\" that the \"matter of excusing\r\njurors is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, the exercise of which\r\nwill not be interfered with unless it is clearly shown to have been abused to the\r\nactual prejudice of the complaining party\" (quoting 50 C.J.S. Juries § 205 (1947)));\r\nState v. Faries, 125 S.C. 281, 288, 118 S.E. 620, 622 (1923) (\"The manner and\r\nbearing of the juror, nature's stamp of character on form and countenance, are\r\nevidential exhibits for the consideration of the circuit judge, which may be more\r\nindicative of the juror's real attitude than his words. Those things cannot\r\nadequately be spread upon the record.\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n5.     Finally, Johnson takes issue with the trial court's decision to admit three\r\nphotographs of the deceased victim's body. We find no error. The photographs\r\nwere relevant, as required by Rule 401, SCRE, in that they had a tendency to\r\nenhance the probability of the existence of certain facts, including information in\r\nJohnson's statement about the manner of the victim's death and the concealment\r\nand removal of her remains. Furthermore, the photographs, in addition to being\r\nrelevant, were not \"calculated to arouse the sympathy or prejudice of the jury\" so\r\nas to justify their exclusion. State v. Torres, 390 S.C. 618, 623, 703 S.E.2d 226,\r\n228 (2010). To the contrary, the trial court was presented with other photographs,\r\nwhich it excluded as overly gruesome and graphic.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-168","title":"Pinepoint Associates v.

Pittman appeal the master-in-\r\nequity's order ruling on a boundary line dispute. On appeal, Green and Pittman\r\nargue the master erred in (1) failing to find the 1991 plat controlled the boundary\r\n\nline between Green's and Samuel D. Humphries and Veronica L.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. As to whether the master erred in failing to find the 1991 plat controlled the\r\nboundary between Green's and the Humphries' properties and whether the master's\r\nruling setting the boundary line was inequitable: Knox v. Bogan, 322 S.C. 64, 66,\r\n472 S.E.2d 43, 45 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"A boundary dispute, if it encompasses an\r\nissue of title, is an action at law.\"); Uxbridge Co. v.

Wife argues the family court erred\r\nin (1) awarding her an insufficient amount of permanent periodic alimony and (2)\r\n\ngranting her an insufficient amount of attorney's fees, as well as denying her\r\nrequest for investigator and expert fees. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n1.      We find the family court erred in awarding Wife $300 per month in\r\npermanent periodic alimony. Prior to the merits hearing, the parties submitted\r\nfinancial declarations to the family court. In Husband's financial declaration, he\r\nreported his monthly income as $2,016 and his total monthly expenses as $1,572.\r\nIn Wife's financial declaration, she reported her monthly income as $965 and her\r\nmonthly expenses as $1,820.50. At the merits hearing, the parties testified\r\nconcerning their respective incomes and expenses. The family court's order\r\nawarded Wife $300 per month in permanent periodic alimony. The order stated\r\nthis alimony award would result in Wife receiving monthly income of $1,355 and\r\nHusband receiving monthly income of $1,426. We are unable to reconcile the\r\nmonthly incomes of Husband and Wife after alimony has been paid with the\r\nincomes and expenses reported in the record. Accordingly, we remand the award\r\nof alimony to the family court for clarification and recalculation. See Butler v.\r\nButler, 385 S.C. 328, 342-43, 684 S.E.2d 191, 198 (Ct. App. 2009) (remanding the\r\nissue of Husband's entitlement to reimbursement for alimony overpayments for\r\nclarification and recalculation because the dates in the order were unclear and in\r\nconflict).\r\n\r\n2.     Additionally, we remand the issue of attorney's fees as well as investigator\r\nand expert fees because the outcome of the potential alimony modification may\r\nimpact the family court's award of attorney's fees. See Roof v. Steele, 396 S.C.\r\n373, 390, 720 S.E.2d 910, 919 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"Because we have remanded the\r\nissue of modification of alimony to the family court, we remand the issue of\r\nattorney's fees as well. The outcome of the alimony modification may impact the\r\nfamily court's award of attorney's fees.\").\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, KONDUROS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2014-UP-177","title":"State v.

Client argues (1) the circuit court erred in concluding that\r\nClient failed to present a scintilla of evidence on the damages element of her\r\nmalpractice claim; (2) the circuit court erred in overlooking the evidence of\r\ndamages on Client's breach of fiduciary duty claim; (3) Client's failure to complete\r\ndiscovery precluded summary judgment; and (4) the circuit court misstated or\r\nmisapprehended critical factual allegations. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\n1. As to Client's assertion that her failure to complete discovery precluded\r\nsummary judgment, we disagree.\r\n\r\n\"A party claiming summary judgment is premature because they have not been\r\nprovided a full and fair opportunity to conduct discovery must advance a good\r\nreason why the time was insufficient under the facts of the case, and why further\r\ndiscovery would uncover additional relevant evidence and create a genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact.\" Guinan v. Tenet Healthsystems of Hilton Head, Inc., 383 S.C. 48,\r\n54-55, 677 S.E.2d 32, 36 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\n\r\nAs early as January 2007, Client had chosen a forensic accountant to help identify\r\nany hidden assets of Husband. However, rather than complete the hiring process to\r\nretain this expert, Client entered into the settlement agreement that she now\r\nchallenges as inadequate.        Further, the settlement agreement provided\r\nindemnification for Client for any financial detriment resulting from Husband's\r\nnondisclosure or inaccurate disclosure of his income, assets, or obligations.\r\nTherefore, any evidence of such nondisclosure or inaccurate disclosure was not\r\nmaterial to the damages element of her malpractice claim.\r\n\nMoreover, as of the date of the summary judgment hearing, March 16, 2012, the\r\ncase had been pending in circuit court since December 11, 2009, over two years.\r\nDuring that time period, the parties engaged in extensive discovery. Nonetheless,\r\nClient failed to present any concrete information indicating that further discovery\r\nwould uncover evidence showing she could have obtained a larger settlement than\r\nthe one she received.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, summary judgment was not premature.\r\n\r\n2. As to the damages element of Client's malpractice claim, we affirm in part and\r\nreverse in part.\r\n\r\n\"A plaintiff in a legal malpractice action must establish four elements: (1) the\r\nexistence of an attorney-client relationship, (2) a breach of duty by the attorney, (3)\r\ndamage to the client, and (4) proximate causation of the client's damages by the\r\nbreach.\" RFT Mgmt. Co., L.L.C. v. Tinsley & Adams L.L.P., 399 S.C. 322, 331,\r\n732 S.E.2d 166, 170 (2012) (citations omitted). \"As to damages, the plaintiff must\r\nshow he or she 'most probably would have been successful in the underlying suit if\r\nthe attorney had not committed the alleged malpractice.'\" Doe v. Howe, 367 S.C.\r\n432, 442, 626 S.E.2d 25, 30 (Ct. App. 2005).1 To satisfy the \"most probably\"\r\nstandard, a legal malpractice claimant may show either that he most probably\r\nwould have prevailed in court in the underlying action or that he most probably\r\nwould have received a larger settlement than the settlement he actually received in\r\nthe underlying action. See Hall v. Fedor, 349 S.C. 169, 175, 561 S.E.2d 654, 657\r\n(Ct. App. 2002) (\"In the case sub judice, [the plaintiff] could satisfy the 'most\r\nprobably' requirement and defeat [the defendant's] summary judgment motion by\r\nestablishing he 'most probably' would have received a larger settlement than\r\n$30,000 or that he 'most probably' would have prevailed on the underlying claim at\r\ntrial.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n1 This standard has also been referenced as applying to the causation element of a\r\nmalpractice claim. See Harris Teeter, Inc. v. Moore & Van Allen, PLLC, 390 S.C.\r\n275, 289-90, 701 S.E.2d 742, 749 (2010) (holding that the plaintiff's second expert\r\nfailed to satisfy the \"most probably\" standard and thereby failed to establish that\r\nthe defendants' alleged acts of professional negligence were the \"but for\" cause of\r\nthe plaintiff's loss).\r\n\nThe \"most probably\" standard is not compromised by the \"scintilla of evidence\"\r\nstandard for surviving a summary judgment motion.2 In other words, the scintilla\r\nstandard speaks to the quantity of evidence needed to survive a summary judgment\r\nmotion, but the evidence must still possess the quality of meeting the legal\r\nstandard applying to the element in question. For example, in Harris Teeter, Inc.\r\nv. Moore & Van Allen, PLLC, our supreme court concluded that a legal\r\nmalpractice plaintiff's presentation of deposition testimony of two experts failed to\r\npresent a scintilla of evidence of either a breach of the standard of care or\r\nproximate cause. 390 S.C. at 289, 701 S.E.2d at 749.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the court cited (1) the first expert's \"circular opinion\" regarding the\r\nstandard of care; (2) the first expert's speaking \"only in generalities\" when he gave\r\nhis opinion that the underlying case was not properly presented; (3) the second\r\nexpert's failure to establish the standard of care; and (4) the second expert's failure\r\nto satisfy the \"most probably\" standard, thereby failing to establish that the\r\ndefendants' alleged acts of professional negligence were the \"but for\" cause of\r\nplaintiff's loss. Id. at 289-91, 701 S.E.2d at 749-50. As to the \"most probably\"\r\nstandard, the court explained:\r\n\r\n                             Instead of stating that the [defendants'] conduct most\r\n                             probably caused the outcome, [the second expert] said,\r\n                             'had [Respondents] done these things, the percentage of\r\n                             success would have been greater.' Thus, [the second\r\n                             expert's] deposition did not establish that the\r\n                             [defendants'] actions were the \"but for\" cause of [the\r\n                             plaintiff's] loss.\r\n\r\nId. at 290, 701 S.E.2d at 749. Because the evidence presented did not meet the\r\napplicable legal standards, it did not qualify as even a scintilla of evidence. Id. at\r\n289, 701 S.E.2d at 749.\r\n\r\nHere, in its order granting summary judgment, the circuit court concluded that\r\nneither of Client's experts stated an opinion that met the requirements of Hall and\r\nDoe. Likewise, in its order denying reconsideration, the circuit court again stated\r\nthat Client presented no expert testimony indicating that Client most probably\r\n                                                            \r\n2 See Hancock v. Mid-S. Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803\r\n(2009) (\"[I]n cases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof,\r\nthe non-moving party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in\r\norder to withstand a motion for summary judgment.\").\r\n\nwould have received more than what she actually received had Attorneys exercised\r\nreasonable care. In response to this statement, Client asserts that the law does not\r\nrequire a plaintiff to provide expert evidence on the damages element of a legal\r\nmalpractice claim, and, thus, the circuit court erred in imposing such a\r\nrequirement. Client argues that no expert is needed to show those damages that\r\nexist as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nThere is no South Carolina precedent setting forth a per se requirement for expert\r\nevidence on the elements of causation or damages. In fact, in Manning v. Quinn,\r\nthe question of the success of the underlying claim was a question of law. 294 S.C.\r\n383, 386, 365 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988). By simply referencing its prior precedent, our\r\nsupreme court could readily determine that the plaintiff would not be successful in\r\nthe underlying action even if the defendant had presented the argument suggested\r\nby plaintiffs. Id. (\"In effect, appellants assert that respondent should have been\r\nable to somehow convince a circuit court that the Department's time for appeal\r\nstarted to run on June 12, 1979. That time-for-appeal argument has been expressly\r\nrejected by this Court.\").3\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the burden of showing causation and damages remains the same\r\nwhether the evidence is generated by an expert or not. Regardless of the type of\r\nevidence used, it must show that had Attorneys exercised reasonable care, the\r\nplaintiff (1) most probably would have prevailed on the underlying claim in court,\r\nor (2) most probably would have received a more valuable settlement than the\r\nsettlement she actually received. Such a determination would be based on an\r\nobjective standard, i.e., what the outcome should have been. See Doe, 367 S.C. at\r\n444 n.18, 626 S.E.2d at 31 n.18 (quoting Wilburn Brewer, Jr., Expert Testimony in\r\nLegal Malpractice Cases, 45 S.C. L. Rev. 727, 766 (1994)) (\"Under the case-within-\r\na-case concept, the test is objective. Therefore, the test is not what the outcome\r\nwould have been, but rather what [it] should have been.\").\r\n\r\nHere, Client asserts that she would have received a more valuable divorce\r\nsettlement, or a better result in court, than the settlement package she actually\r\nreceived had Attorneys exercised reasonable care. Client's expert, Dr. Gregory B.\r\n                                                            \r\n3See also Doe, 367 S.C. at 443, 626 S.E.2d at 30 (\"Because nothing in the record\r\nsuggests that a dispute exists regarding any of the factual issues regarding the\r\napplicability of the statute of limitations in the underlying case, such as estoppel or\r\nsome discrepancy as to the operative dates, we hold Doe's claim against Porter-\r\nGaud as a matter of law, had lapsed long before [defendant] undertook to represent\r\nhim.\").\r\n\nAdams, stated that Client sustained \"loss of substantial value of the marital estate\r\nand her share of it due to the dissipation, transfer, and secreting of much of it by\r\nher husband during the pendency of the divorce litigation.\" However, Client has\r\nnot presented evidence indicating the existence of any income or assets controlled\r\nby Husband that she was not already aware of when she signed the settlement\r\nagreement. Further, the settlement Client actually received includes the contractual\r\nright to indemnification from Husband for any financial detriment due to any non-\r\ndisclosure or inaccurate disclosure of Husband's income, assets, or obligations.\r\nBecause she is protected by this valuable right, Client cannot claim that Attorneys'\r\nfailure to perform a more extensive investigation of Husband's income, assets, and\r\nobligations caused her any permanent loss.  \r\n\r\nClient also asserts that she most probably would have obtained permanent alimony\r\nhad Attorneys properly counseled her concerning dating.4 As to permanent\r\nalimony, such an award is within the family court's discretion after considering the\r\nfollowing factors: (1) the duration of the marriage together with the ages of the\r\nparties at the time of the marriage and at the time of the marital litigation; (2) the\r\nphysical and emotional condition of each spouse; (3) the educational background\r\nof each spouse; (4) the employment history and earning potential of each spouse;\r\n(5) the standard of living established during the marriage; (6) the current and\r\nreasonably anticipated earnings of both spouses; (7) the current and reasonably\r\nanticipated expenses and needs of both spouses; (8) the marital and nonmarital\r\nproperties of the parties, including those apportioned to him or her in the divorce or\r\nseparate maintenance action; (9) custody of the children; (10) marital misconduct\r\nor fault of either or both parties; (11) the tax consequences to each party as a result\r\nof the particular form of support awarded; (12) the existence and extent of any\r\nsupport obligation from a prior marriage or for any other reason of either party;\r\nand (13) such other factors the court considers relevant. S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-\r\n130(C) (Supp. 2013).\r\n\r\nIn light of these numerous factors and the discretionary nature of an alimony\r\naward, Client has not carried her burden of convincing this court that she most\r\nprobably would have obtained permanent alimony had Attorneys properly\r\ncounseled her. See Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 385, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011)\r\n                                                            \r\n4 Prior to the execution of the settlement agreement, Husband filed with the family\r\ncourt an affidavit stating that by her own admission, Client had committed\r\nadultery. Husband attached to his affidavit an excerpt from a deposition of Client\r\nthat was taken during the pendency of the divorce litigation. In this deposition,\r\nClient identified an individual with whom she had intimate relations.\r\n\n(holding that the burden is upon the appellant to convince this court that the trial\r\ncourt erred in its findings). By the time Client signed the settlement agreement,\r\nshe had already received at least $679,000.00 in lump sum payments from\r\nHusband, most of these funds serving as advances on property distribution. She\r\nalso received from the property distribution real estate for which Husband paid\r\n$682,500.00 in 2001, along with $20,000 for \"renovations/repairs\" to this property;\r\nHusband's payment of monthly child support in the amount of $5,000.00, of which\r\n$3,751.00 was to be attributed to property distribution;5 and Husband's payment for\r\nClient's medical insurance for up to 8 months. In light of these resources and her\r\nability to earn income as a professional designer, we are reluctant to conclude that\r\nClient most probably would have received an award of permanent alimony had\r\nAttorneys exercised reasonable care.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm summary judgment on Client's malpractice\r\nclaim as it pertains to property division and permanent alimony. See Rule 220(c),\r\nSCACR (\"The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment\r\nupon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.\").\r\n\r\nAs to Client's assertion that she would have received separate maintenance and\r\nsupport during the pendency of the divorce litigation had Attorneys sought this\r\nrelief, we agree. As with permanent alimony, an award of separate maintenance\r\nand support is within the family court's discretion after considering the factors\r\nlisted in section 20-3-130(C). However, at the beginning of her separation from\r\nHusband, Client did not have access to the funds she later received as advances on\r\nproperty distribution. Further, while Husband eventually provided ample funds for\r\nmany, if not most, of Client's expenses, this primary source of her income did not\r\npossess the stability that court-ordered separate maintenance and support would\r\nhave possessed. When we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Client,\r\nit shows that she most probably would have received court-ordered separate\r\nmaintenance and support, along with the stability that comes with a court award\r\nenforceable by contempt, had Potterfield obtained a temporary hearing to pursue\r\nthis relief soon after Husband left the marital home. Therefore, we reverse\r\nsummary judgment on Client's malpractice claim as it pertains to her loss of court-\r\nordered separate maintenance and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n5 After twelve months, the child support/property distribution payment was to\r\ndecline to $1,500.00 until the youngest child of the marriage graduated from high\r\nschool.\r\n\n3. As to Client's breach of fiduciary duty claim, a review of Client's Complaint\r\nshows that this claim arose out of the duty created by the attorney-client\r\nrelationship. Further, paragraphs 70 and 84 of the Complaint show that the breach\r\nof fiduciary duty claim was based on the same material facts on which the\r\nmalpractice claim was based. Therefore, Client's breach of fiduciary duty claim is\r\nduplicative of the legal malpractice claim. See RFT Mgmt., 399 S.C. at 336-37,\r\n732 S.E.2d at 173 (holding that the plaintiff's breach of fiduciary duty claim was\r\nduplicative of its legal malpractice claim and, hence, the trial court did not err in\r\nmerging the two claims, because the plaintiff did not set forth any specific facts\r\nshowing that the fiduciary duty claim arose out of a duty other than one created by\r\nthe attorney-client relationship or was based on different material facts).\r\n\r\n       As to the remedy of disgorgement, Client did not seek this remedy in either\r\nher Complaint or her Rule 59(e) motion. Therefore, Client did not squarely present\r\nthis precise issue to the circuit court despite two opportunities to do so. Because\r\nthe circuit court was not given the opportunity to determine whether this remedy\r\nwould preclude summary judgment, this court may not now reach the issue. See\r\nElam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772, 779-80 (2004)\r\n(\"Issues and arguments are preserved for appellate review only when they are\r\nraised to and ruled on by the lower court.\").\r\n\r\n4. As to Client's remaining arguments, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b) and the\r\nfollowing authorities: Rule 220(c), SCACR (\"The appellate court may affirm any\r\nruling, order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on\r\nAppeal.\"); Hansson v.

Johnson (Husband) appeals a divorce decree, arguing\r\nthe family court erred in: (1) finding the goodwill of his business was subject to\r\nequitable division; (2) awarding Respondent Allison J. Johnson (Wife) a share in\r\n\nthe value of the business based on her direct and indirect contributions; (3)\r\nrejecting Husband's claim that he had a fifty percent interest in the business before\r\nthe parties' marriage; and (4) awarding Wife $36,500.00 in attorney's fees,\r\n$3,661.00 in costs, and $7,502.22 in expert fees. After hearing oral argument in\r\nthe matter,1 we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities:\r\n\r\n1.      As to the inclusion of the goodwill of Beltone Hearing Care Group, LLC, in\r\nthe marital estate: Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 389, 709 S.E.2d 650, 654 (2011)\r\n(\"[D]e novo review [in appeals from the family court] neither relieves an appellant\r\nof demonstrating error nor requires us to ignore the findings of the family court.\");\r\nPinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387-88, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001) (stating the\r\nbroad scope of review in an appeal from an action in equity does not relieve the\r\nappellant of the burden of convincing the appellate court that the trial court erred in\r\nits findings); RGM v.

(holding the family court erred in finding an expert witness properly excluded\r\ngoodwill in computing the value of a business); Casey v. Casey, 293 S.C. 503, 504,\r\n362 S.E.2d 6, 7 (1987) (\"When the goodwill in a business is dependent upon the\r\nowner's future earnings, it is too speculative for inclusion in the marital estate.\"\r\n(emphasis added)); id.

As to the award of thirty percent of the value of Beltone Hearing Care\r\nGroup, LLC, to Wife based on her direct and indirect contributions: Epperly v.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 During the hearing, counsel for Husband moved to bar opposing counsel from\r\npresenting oral argument pursuant to Rule 217, SCACR, noting that Wife's brief\r\nincluded a suggestion that this court overrule Casey v. Casey. After receiving\r\nassurances from Wife's attorney that he did not intend to present oral argument\r\nagainst precedent, we denied the motion and allowed counsel to proceed. See Rule\r\n217, SCACR (requiring a formal motion only for \"[o]ral argument against\r\nprecedent\" and expressly providing that \"[p]ermission of the appellate court shall\r\nnot be required to argue against precedent in the brief\").\r\n\nEpperly, 312 S.C. 411, 414, 440 S.E.2d 884, 885-86 (1994) (adopting the family\r\ncourt's findings of fact on an issue in which divergent testimony was presented\r\nbecause \"the sitting judge was in the best position to determine the credibility of\r\nthe witnesses\").\r\n\r\n3.    As to Husband's argument that he had acquired a fifty percent interest in\r\nBeltone Hearing Care Group, LLC, prior to the parties' marriage: Wilburn v.\r\nWilburn, 403 S.C. 372, 382, 743 S.E.2d 734, 740 (2013) (\"If [a spouse] presents\r\nevidence to show the property is marital, the burden shifts to the other spouse to\r\npresent evidence to establish the property's nonmarital character.\").\r\n\r\n4.     As to the award of attorney's fees, costs, and expert witness fees: Patel v.\r\nPatel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004) (noting assessment of\r\nattorney's fees against a party in a family court action is authorized by statute); id.\r\n(\"An award of attorney's fees rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge\r\nand should not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion.\");\r\nSusan R. v.
