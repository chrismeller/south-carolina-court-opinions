Hayes, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2011-UP-136\r\n  Submitted January 11, 2011 â€“ Filed April\r\n5, 2011Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        John Robert Murphy, of Columbia, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        John S. Nichols, of Columbia; and Robert\r\n          Verner Phillips, of Rock Hill; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: Â Sandra\r\n  and Ronnie Jenkins had three auto insurance policies with Farm Bureau that each\r\n  carried liability limits of $25,000.00 per person, $50,000.00 per accident, and\r\n  $25,000.00 for property damage.Â  For each policy, the Jenkins also chose to\r\n  carry equivalent UM and UIM coverage.Â  \r\nOn May 30, 2003, the Jenkins\r\n  went to the Farm Bureau office to increase their policy limits and met with\r\n  Agent Joe Lee.Â  Lee testified that another agent, Crystal Martin, made initial\r\n  changes to the Jenkins's coverage in Farm Bureau's computer system and these\r\n  changes were reflected on pre-printed forms before Agent Lee met with the\r\n  Jenkins.Â  \r\nLee filled in additional\r\n  information on the forms and presented them to Ronnie Jenkins for signature.Â \r\n  Ronnie Jenkins concedes he signed the documents.Â  At the conclusion of the\r\n  meeting, the Jenkins modified their policies to provide $250,000.00 per person,\r\n  $500,000.00 per accident, and $100,000.00 for property damage in liability\r\n  coverage. Â Ronnie Jenkins testified that neither Lee nor any other Farm Bureau\r\n  agent provided him with an explanation of UM and UIM coverage.Â  \r\nAfter a car accident on July\r\n  15, 2006, Sandra Jenkins filed a claim with Farm Bureau for UM coverage for\r\n  bodily injuries she sustained.Â  At the time of the accident, the Jenkins\r\n  learned that their policy provided UM and UIM coverage only in the amounts of $25,000.00\r\n  per person, $50,000.00 per accident, and $25,000.00 for property damage.Â  \r\nFarm Bureau filed a\r\n  declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that it made a meaningful offer of\r\n  additional UM coverage to the Jenkins.Â  After a hearing, the trial court found\r\n  that Farm Bureau did not make a meaningful offer of UM and UIM coverage and\r\n  ordered that the policy be reformed to provide Jenkins with UM and UIM coverage\r\n  equal to their liability coverage.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFarm Bureau contends the\r\n  trial court erred in ruling that it failed to meet its burden of proving it\r\n  made a meaningful offer of UM and UIM coverage to Ronnie and Sandra Jenkins.Â  See Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Leachman, 362 S.C. 344, 348, 608 S.E.2d\r\n  569, 571 (2005) (holding that insurer bears the burden of establishing that it\r\n  made a meaningful offer).\r\nThe issues here involve\r\n  making a &quot;determination of coverage under an insurance policy, and\r\n  therefore, [this] is an action at law.&quot;Â  Atkins v. Horace Mann Ins. Co.,\r\n  376 S.C. 625, 630, 658 S.E.2d 106, 109 (Ct. App. 2008); accord Nationwide\r\n  Mut. Ins. Co. v. Prioleau, 359 S.C. 238, 241, 597 S.E.2d 165, 167 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, the trial court's factual\r\n  findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless a review of the record reveals that\r\n  there is no evidence to reasonably support the trial court's findings.Â  Atkins,\r\n  376 S.C. at 630, 658 S.E.2d at 109.\r\nTo meet the burden of proving\r\n  a meaningful offer was made, an insurer must demonstrate compliance either with\r\n  section 38-77-350 of the South Carolina Code or with\r\n  the Wannamaker requirements.[1]Â \r\n  Farm Bureau concedes the trial court correctly ruled that it is not entitled to\r\n  the conclusive presumption of statutory compliance under section 38-77-350(B).Â \r\n  Instead, Farm Bureau contends that the trial court erred in ruling that it\r\n  failed to make a meaningful offer under Wannamaker.[2]Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn Wannamaker, the\r\n  supreme court held that insurers must make a &quot;meaningful offer&quot; of UM\r\n  coverage.Â  291 S.C. at 522, 354 S.E.2d at 557.Â  To\r\n  satisfy this requirement: \r\n\r\n  (1) the insurer's notification process must be commercially\r\n    reasonable, whether oral or in writing; (2) the insurer must specify the limits\r\n    of optional coverage and not merely offer additional coverage in general terms;\r\n    (3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the insured of the nature of the\r\n    optional coverage; and (4) the insured must be told that optional coverages are\r\n    available for an additional premium. \r\n\r\n291 S.C. at 521,\r\n  354 S.E.2d at 556.Â  \r\nAfter the trial court ruled\r\n  that Farm Bureau was not entitled to a conclusive statutory presumption, the\r\n  judge properly turned to the factual question of whether Farm Bureau made a\r\n  meaningful under the Wannamaker criteria.[3]Â  See Grinnell Corp. v. Wood, 389 S.C. 350, 357, 357 S.E.2d 796,\r\n  799-800 (2010) (holding that even when an insurer is not entitled to the\r\n  statutory presumption, the insurer may prove a meaningful offer by\r\n  demonstrating compliance with Wannamaker).Â  The trial court reviewed the\r\n  evidence and concluded that the testimony relating to whether Farm Bureau intelligibly advised the Jenkins of the nature of the UM\r\n  and UIM coverage and whether Farm Bureau told the Jenkins that optional\r\n  coverages are available for an additional premium was &quot;dramatically\r\n  opposed.&quot;Â  The trial court determined that Farm Bureau &quot;failed to\r\n  carry its burden of proof and therefore failed to prove by a preponderance of\r\n  the evidence that it made a meaningful offer of UM and UIM coverage to the\r\n  Jenkins.&quot;Â  \r\nEvidence in the record\r\n  supports the trial court's finding that no meaningful offer was made. Â Agent\r\n  Lee testified that an insured who requests &quot;maximum coverage&quot; would\r\n  not have received what he asked for if he only had $25,000 in UIM coverage.Â  He\r\n  also testified about the normal procedure he follows in explaining coverage\r\n  options and forms to insureds, but conceded that his only proof is the\r\n  selections made on the form.Â  Mr. Jenkins testified that Agent Lee &quot;did\r\n  not explain to him anything regarding UIM or UM coverage.Â  He testified that he\r\n  had never heard of uninsured or underinsured coverage until it was explained to\r\n  him by his current counsel . . . .&quot;Â  The trial judge's decision turns on\r\n  this factual finding.Â  Because there is evidence in the record to support the\r\n  finding, we must affirm.Â Â Â  \r\nFarm Bureau relies on Atkins\r\n  v. Horace Mann Insurance Co. in support of its position, but we find the\r\n  case distinguishable.Â  376 S.C. 625, 630, 658 S.E.2d 106, 109 (Ct. App. 2008).Â \r\n  First, Atkins addressed an appeal from a ruling that a meaningful offer\r\n  was made, while here the trial court ruled that the facts supported an opposite\r\n  ruling.Â  376 S.C. at 629, 658 S.E.2d at 108-09.Â  The court concluded that the\r\n  written offer present in Atkins is commercially reasonable under Wannamaker,\r\n  376 S.C. at 631, 658 S.E.2d at 109, while the issues present here concern\r\n  different prongs of Wannamaker.Â  Second, Farm Bureau emphasizes that the\r\n  court affirmed solely on the form in Atkins.Â  However, the entire transaction\r\n  in Atkins occurred through use of the mail, whereas here, the Jenkins\r\n  initially made a phone call to Farm Bureau to discuss changing their policies\r\n  and then decided to go to Farm Bureau's office to discuss their options and\r\n  sign the forms.Â  \r\nFarm Bureau also argues that\r\n  Agent Lee's testimony demonstrates that a meaningful offer was given.Â  As\r\n  discussed above, after hearing and weighing Agent Lee's testimony, the trial\r\n  court concluded that, in combination with the other evidence in the record,\r\n  Farm Bureau did not satisfy its burden to prove it made a meaningful offer.Â  See Leachman, 362 S.C. at 348, 608 S.E.2d at 571.Â  This was within the trial\r\n  court's discretion.Â  See S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. M &amp; T Enters.\r\n  of Mt. Pleasant, LLC, 379 S.C. 645, 668, n.12, 667 S.E.2d 7, 20, n.12 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008) (noting that the trier of fact is &quot;free to accept or reject any\r\n  or all of a witness's testimony&quot;). \r\nFarm Bureau argues that the\r\n  Jenkins should be bound by the documents they signed.Â  The trial court properly\r\n  ruled that the fact that the Jenkins signed the forms is not dispositive of the\r\n  case.Â  Although it seems contrary to basic contract principles, the law\r\n  requiring meaningful offers of UM and UIM coverage has developed to protect\r\n  insureds.[4]Â \r\n  Without a meaningful offer, there can be no operative acceptance.Â  As the trial\r\n  court explained: \r\n\r\n  [O]ur\r\n    courts have carved out a rule to the effect that a detailed acknowledgment that\r\n    reflects detailed information, crucial to a fair contractual relation between\r\n    the insured and the insurer, is valueless. . . . [T]he law in this instance\r\n    diminishes the value of one's signature and places absolutely no responsibility\r\n    on one to watch out for their own interest and be held to their written\r\n    statements . . . . \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C.

Avery appeals her conviction for\r\n  homicide by child abuse. Â On appeal, Avery\r\n  contends the trial court erred in denying her motion for a directed verdict\r\n  because the State failed to prove her\r\n  conduct rose to the level of extreme indifference as required by the homicide\r\n  by child abuse statute.Â  We disagree.[1]\r\nAn individual is guilty of\r\n  homicide by child abuse if that individual &quot;causes the death of a child\r\n  under the age of eleven while committing child abuse or neglect, and the death\r\n  occurs under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human\r\n  life.&quot;Â  S.C.

Farthing, all of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Kevin Paschal appeals his commitment to\r\n  the South Carolina Department of Mental Health as a sexually violent predator.Â \r\n  On appeal, Paschal contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a\r\n  directed verdict because the State failed to prove his diagnosis of pedophilia.\r\n  Â We affirm.[1]\r\nA sexually\r\n  violent predator is defined in the Sexually Violent Predator Act (the Act) as &quot;a\r\n  person who: (a) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense; and (b)\r\n  suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person\r\n  likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure\r\n  facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1)\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  &quot;Mental abnormality&quot; is defined as &quot;a mental\r\n  condition affecting a person's emotional or volitional capacity that\r\n  predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(3) (2010).Â  The phrase &quot;likely to engage in acts of sexual\r\n  violence&quot; is defined as a &quot;propensity to commit acts of sexual\r\n  violence . . . of such a degree as to pose a menace to the health and safety of\r\n  others.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(9) (2010).\r\n&quot;When ruling on a motion\r\n  for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence\r\n  of evidence, not its weight.&quot; State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292,\r\n  625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â  &quot;When reviewing a denial of a directed\r\n  verdict, [an appellate court] views the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\n  in the light most favorable to the [S]tate.&quot;Â  Id. Â A mental health\r\n  expert's clinical opinion is sufficient, absent any other evidence, to support\r\n  the trial court's denial of a motion for a directed verdict. Â See In\r\n  re Care &amp; Treatment of Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 646-48, 550 S.E.2d 311,\r\n  315 (2001) (holding a mental health expert's clinical opinion of whether or not\r\n  the accused should undergo in-patient treatment was sufficient by itself to\r\n  affirm a denial of directed verdict).\r\nHere, the State produced\r\n  evidence that Paschal met both elements of sexually violent predator as defined\r\n  in the Act.Â  A forensic psychiatrist testified Paschal's conviction of criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree was a sexually violent\r\n  offense.Â  Additionally, the forensic psychiatrist testified Paschal suffered\r\n  from paraphilia not otherwise specified, which made him likely to engage in\r\n  acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term\r\n  care, control, and treatment. Â Thus,\r\n  viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence\r\n  supported submitting the case to the jury. Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and THOMAS and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-143","title":"Booker v.

Booker for being &quot;Out of Place,&quot;\r\n  offense 828 of the Department's policy manual. Â The Department argues substantial\r\n  evidence supported its finding that Booker was in library prison facilities\r\n  without authorization even though a library schedule indicated Booker's unit\r\n  was scheduled for access to the library at the time of the incident.Â  We agree.[1]\r\nThis court may reverse a\r\n  decision of the ALC only if it is affected by an error of law or &quot;clearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. substantial evidence on the whole\r\n  record .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Hendricks v.

Â§\r\n  1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2010)).Â  Under the Department's policy manual, an inmate\r\n  commits offense 828, &quot;Out of Place,&quot; if the inmate &quot;without\r\n  authority either fails to report to his/her appointed place of duty or\r\n  assignment or any other place to which he/she was ordered;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n  is found to be in an unauthorized area; or does not have specific approval to\r\n  be in an unauthorized area.&quot;\r\nHere, the ALC held\r\n  substantial evidence did not support the Department's finding Booker was in the\r\n  prison library without authorization.Â  However, the record included an incident\r\n  report indicating inmates were not allowed access to the library at the time of\r\n  the incident because the library was scheduled to open late.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  substantial evidence supported the Department's finding, and the ALC's holding\r\n  was clearly erroneous in light of the substantial evidence in the record.Â Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nFEW, C.J., THOMAS and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-144","title":"PHH Mortgage Corp v.

Â In May 2002, Mullen\r\n  developed a cough, sinus problems, headaches, and fatigue. She was subsequently\r\n  treated by a doctor in June 2002 for bronchitis and a sinus infection. According\r\n  to Mullen, her symptoms improved over the summer, but returned when school\r\n  began in the fall. Â In October 2002, Dr. Randall Evans examined Mullen and determined\r\n  she suffered from an &quot;environment sensitivity&quot; and &quot;[g]iven her\r\n  reactive airway disease, she would officially meet the criteria for a reactive\r\n  airways dysfunction syndrome.&quot;Â  In November 2002, AAA Environmental (AAA) conducted\r\n  an &quot;Indoor Environmental Quality Investigation&quot; at Hilton Head\r\n  Elementary and discovered several types of fungi growing in the school,\r\n  including Aspergillus mold. Â AAA recommended Mullen vacate her classroom and\r\n  the carpet, ceiling tiles, and HVAC system be treated.Â  Mullen's classroom\r\n  was gutted, and she returned to teaching in the room in January 2003.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn April 2003, Mullen filed a Form 50 with\r\n  the Commission reporting an accidental injury to her sinuses and lungs. Â In her\r\n  pre-hearing brief, Mullen alleged she suffered from &quot;Restrictive Airway\r\n  Disease resulting from chronic exposure to Aspergillus mold in [her] classroom,\r\n  affecting [her] sinuses and lungs.&quot; Â Mullen reported the date of\r\n  her accident as &quot;chronic exposure up to 11/02.&quot;Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn August and September 2003, Mullen was\r\n  evaluated by Dr. Charles Banov to determine whether she had any injury that\r\n  could be attributed to mold exposure.Â  According to Dr. Banov's report, the CT\r\n  scans of Mullen's sinuses were &quot;not remarkable,&quot; and her pulmonary\r\n  function and bronchoprovocation tests were normal.[1] Because Mullen's bronchoprovocation test was &quot;[c]ompletely within normal\r\n  limits,&quot; Dr. Banov opined that her &quot;respiratory status was excellent\r\n  and met all the criteria for what we consider normalcy.&quot; When asked\r\n  whether Mullen had reactive airway disease, Dr. Banov testified &quot;[s]he did\r\n  not . . . because the bronchoprovocation would have brought it out . . . this is\r\n  the gold standard to diagnosing reactive airway disease.&quot; Dr. Banov also\r\n  performed a thermophilic battery test to check Mullen's blood for the presence\r\n  of certain fungi, including Aspergillus mold. The test revealed Mullen's blood\r\n  was &quot;absolutely negative&quot; for the presence of Aspergillus mold.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMullen was also evaluated by Dr. Cary\r\n  Fechter in September 2003. Â Dr. Fechter performed pulmonary function tests as\r\n  well as chest x-rays and a CT scan of Mullen's sinuses. Â He determined\r\n  Mullen's pulmonary function was normal and her sinuses did &quot;not show\r\n  evidence of mucosal thickening or air fluid levels.&quot; Â Dr. Fechter found\r\n  Mullen's condition had improved, but noted she continued to have symptoms\r\n  related to her sinuses. Dr. Fechter also performed a cardiopulmonary stress\r\n  test, which revealed Mullen had &quot;poor conditioning&quot; with no ischemic\r\n  changes and no oxygen desaturations. Â In his report, Dr. Fechter stated:\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      All major pulmonary studies including\r\n      methacholine test are normal except for her cardiopulmonary stress test.Â  The\r\n      stress test performed under strict criteria and using sophisticated carbon\r\n      dioxide/oxygen monitoring system showed a maximum oxygen consumption which was\r\n      clearly lower than normal.Â  According to the Guide of the Evaluation Permanent\r\n      Impairment, her oxygen consumption of 17.1 ml per kg per minute would place her\r\n      in the 26-50% impairment of the whole person.Â \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nDr. Fechter opined Mullen &quot;had a verified\r\n  exposure to Aspergillus molds in an enclosed area of high intensity and of long\r\n  term duration&quot; and those factors &quot;would lead to a [sic] expected\r\n  hypersensitivity reaction.&quot;Â  Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDr. Banov reviewed the results of Dr.\r\n  Fechter's cardiopulmonary stress test and testified Mullen's &quot;poor\r\n  conditioning&quot; did not affect his opinion as to permanent impairment, but\r\n  could provide &quot;some explanation for her subjective complaints of pulmonary\r\n  problems.&quot; Â Dr. Banov testified the tests he performed indicated Mullen\r\n  &quot;did not have infection with Aspergillus&quot; or &quot;an allergic\r\n  reaction to Aspergillus,&quot; and that she did not have any permanent\r\n  impairment. When asked whether there was any objective evidence that Mullen\r\n  sustained any permanent, physical injury as a result of exposure to Aspergillus\r\n  mold, Dr. Banov answered, &quot;Absolutely none.&quot;Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn October 2005, the single commissioner determined,\r\n  based on Dr. Fechter's report, the AAA report, and medical reports, Mullen\r\n  &quot;suffered a compensable injury by accident and/or occupational disease to\r\n  the lungs and sinuses as a result of exposure to the [A]spergillus mold in her\r\n  classroom and her hyper-reactivity to the mold.&quot;Â  The single commissioner\r\n  also found Mullen suffered permanent injury to her sinuses and was entitled to forty\r\n  weeks of compensation, totaling $21,976.80.Â  The single commissioner determined\r\n  Mullen did not sustain a permanent injury to her lungs. Â Beaufort County School District and the South Carolina\r\n  School Boards Insurance Trust (collectively\r\n  Respondents) appealed the single commissioner's order to the Appellate Panel. Â The\r\n  Appellate Panel reversed the single commissioner, finding the record contained\r\n  no evidence Mullen sustained a compensable injury or suffered an occupational\r\n  disease arising out of and in the course and scope of her employment. Â The\r\n  Appellate Panel also noted &quot;[n]o physician ever assigned an impairment\r\n  rating or even indicated [Mullen] sustained a permanent impairment to her\r\n  sinuses.&quot;Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMullen appealed the Appellate Panel's\r\n  order to the circuit court. Â The circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel,\r\n  holding substantial evidence supported the Appellate Panel's finding Mullen presented\r\n  no evidence she sustained any injury or occupational disease arising out of her\r\n  employment.Â  The circuit court also affirmed the Appellate Panel's\r\n  determination that Mullen did not sustain any permanent impairment or loss of\r\n  use as a result of any alleged mold exposure at work. Â This appeal followed.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  STANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe substantial evidence\r\n  rule of the Administrative Procedures Act governs the standard of review in a\r\n  workers' compensation decision. Â Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury\r\n  Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 619, 611 S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;In an\r\n  appeal from the Commission, neither this court nor the circuit court may\r\n  substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the\r\n  evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected\r\n  by an error of law.&quot;Â  Stone v. Traylor Bros., 360 S.C. 271, 274,\r\n  600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004).Â &quot;Any\r\n  review of the [C]ommission's factual findings is governed by the substantial\r\n  evidence standard.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Substantial evidence is not a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the\r\n  case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in\r\n  order to justify its action.&quot;Â  Liberty Mut. Ins., 363 S.C. at 620,\r\n  611 S.E.2d at 300.Â  &quot;The possibility\r\n  of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\r\n  administrative agency's findings from being supported by substantial evidence.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n  \r\nMullen argues the circuit court erred in finding\r\n  substantial evidence supported the Appellate Panel's determination that she did\r\n  not sustain a compensable injury by accident[2] or an occupational disease[3] arising out of and in the course of her employment. Â We agree.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe circuit court found the\r\n  record contained no evidence Mullen sustained an injury or occupational disease\r\n  arising out of her employment. The circuit court noted Mullen's laboratory\r\n  tests revealed her blood had no mold in it and her lung function and bronchoprovocation\r\n  tests were normal.Â  The circuit court also concluded that Mullen failed to\r\n  prove any of the statutory requirements of the Occupational Disease Statute,\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-10 to -200 (Supp. 2010).Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMullen argues her chronic\r\n  sinus problems, cough, headaches, and fatigue, as well as Dr. Fechter's\r\n  determination that she has a hypersensitivity reaction to mold, all support a\r\n  finding that she suffered a compensable injury.Â  The Respondents maintain the\r\n  record contains no evidence of injury to Mullen's lungs or sinuses and no\r\n  evidence any of Mullen's symptoms were causally related to any alleged mold\r\n  exposure.Â  The Respondents also contend Mullen failed to prove the existence of\r\n  a disease caused by any mold exposure in her employment.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe find the circuit court erred in\r\n  affirming the Appellate Panel's determination the record contained no evidence\r\n  Mullen sustained an injury or occupational disease arising out of the course\r\n  and scope of her employment. Â The record contains some evidence Mullen\r\n  sustained an injury or disease. Â In addition to Dr. Fechter's determination\r\n  that Mullen had a hypersensitivity reaction to mold, Dr. Randall Evans examined\r\n  Mullen and determined she suffered from an &quot;environment sensitivity&quot;\r\n  and &quot;[g]iven her reactive airway disease, she would officially meet the\r\n  criteria for a reactive airways dysfunction syndrome.&quot; Accordingly, we\r\n  reverse the circuit court's affirmation of the Appellate Panel's finding the\r\n  record contained no evidence Mullen sustained an injury or occupational disease\r\n  arising out of her employment.Â  We remand the issue of whether Mullen sustained\r\n  an injury or occupational disease and whether she suffered any permanent\r\n  impairment to the Appellate Panel for reconsideration.Â  We caution that our\r\n  opinion is not to be confused as a finding of no substantial evidence to\r\n  support the Appellate Panel's determination of lack of compensability. Â Given\r\n  the Appellate Panel's erroneous conclusion no evidence supported a\r\n  finding of injury or occupational disease, we are simply remanding for the\r\n  Appellate Panel to consider all of the evidence in making its determination\r\n  regarding compensability.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  \r\n  We reverse the circuit court's affirmation of the\r\n    Appellate Panel's determination the record contained no evidence Mullen sustained\r\n    an injury or occupational disease arising out of and in the course of her\r\n    employment.Â  Further, we remand to the Appellate Panel for reconsideration of\r\n    all the evidence to determine whether Mullen sustained an injury or\r\n    occupational disease, and whether she suffered any permanent impairment.

Jefferson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n__________\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2011-UP-151\r\nHeard March 9, 2011 â€“ Filed April 12, 2011Â Â Â  \r\n__________\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n__________\r\nRobert L. Jackson, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJames Ross Snell, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  This case involves a\r\n  restrictive covenant in a deed from Marjorie Smith,[1] the original grantor, to\r\n  SGM Moonglo, Inc., the fourth grantee.Â  The deed prohibited the sale of alcohol\r\n  on the land.Â  When SGM began selling alcohol on the land, Smith sought an\r\n  injunction enforcing the covenant.Â  SGM appeals the circuit court's order enjoining\r\n  it from selling alcohol.Â  It argues (1) the prohibition on selling alcohol is a\r\n  condition of sale rather than a restrictive covenant, (2) Smith did not have\r\n  standing to enforce the covenant, (3) the language of the covenant was\r\n  ambiguous, and (4) Smith was unqualified to testify to diminution in her\r\n  property value.Â  SGM also alleges error in various factual findings by the\r\n  circuit court.Â  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following\r\n  authorities:\r\n1. As to whether the prohibition is a condition of sale or a restrictive\r\n  covenant: Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578, 599, 635\r\n  S.E.2d 649, 660 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding appellants abandoned an issue on\r\n  appeal when they failed to cite any case law for a proposition and made only conclusory\r\n  arguments in support); Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (stating that each\r\n  &quot;particular issue to be addressed shall be set forth in distinctive type,\r\n  followed by discussion and citations of authority&quot;) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\n2. As to whether Smith had standing to enforce the restrictive covenant: McLeod\r\n  v. Baptiste, 315 S.C. 246, 247, 433 S.E.2d 834, 835 (1993) (&quot;[T]he\r\n  grantor lacks standing to enforce a covenant against a remote grantee when the\r\n  grantor no longer owns real property which would benefit from the enforcement\r\n  of that restrictive covenant.&quot;).Â  \r\n3. As to whether the deed language was ambiguous: Taylor v. Lindsey,\r\n  332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 863-64 (1998) (&quot;Words of a restrictive\r\n  covenant will be given the common, ordinary meaning attributed to them at the\r\n  time of their execution. Â Restrictive covenants are contractual in nature, so\r\n  that the paramount rule of construction is to ascertain and give effect to the\r\n  intent of the parties as determined from the whole\r\n  document.&quot;) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\r\n4. As to Smith's qualification to testify about property value diminution: AJG\r\n  Holdings, LLC v. Dunn, 382 S.C. 43, 51, 674 S.E.2d 505, 509 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n  (&quot;Generally, a restrictive covenant will be enforced regardless of the\r\n  amount of damage that will result from the breach and even though there is no\r\n  substantial monetary damage to the complainant by reason of the violation . . .\r\n  .Â  The mere breach alone is grounds for injunctive relief.&quot;).\r\n5. As to the alleged error in factual findings: Eaddy v. Smurfit-Stone\r\n  Container Corp., 355 S.C. 154, 164, 584 S.E.2d 390, 396 (Ct.

S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Motor Vehicles,&nbsp;380 S.C. 600,\r\n  604, 670 S.E.2d 674, 676&nbsp;(Ct.

Â§ 44-2-20(10) (2002) (defining an operator as &quot;any person in control of, or having responsibility for\r\n  the daily operation of [a tank]&quot;).Â  Here, Timothy Glen Roper (Son) testified that Roper 66\r\n  operated as a convenience store and gas station from 1973 until 1998. Â Wife and\r\n  Son explained the gas pumps were located outside of the front of the store, and\r\n  the customers paid for the gasoline at Roper 66.Â  He admitted Husband was\r\n  responsible for notifying Bush Oil if the gas pumps had problems.Â  Additionally,\r\n  DHEC provided several documents from Wife in which Wife indicated she was the\r\n  owner and/or operator of the tanks.Â  Furthermore, even though the lease\r\n  agreements stated that Bush Oil maintained legal control of the equipment, the\r\n  agreements designated responsibility to Husband to maintain the equipment.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the record contains substantial evidence to support the ALC's finding.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT, and PIEPER,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-155","title":"Barnes v.

(Stations) for cause.&nbsp; The circuit court held the Commission erred in not making\r\n  sufficiently specific findings and submitting an incomplete record to the circuit court.&nbsp; Moreover, the circuit court held the Commission's decision was\r\nnot supported by substantial evidence. &nbsp;We reverse and reinstate the opinion of the Commission.[1]\r\nI.&nbsp; Substantial Evidence\r\nThe circuit court held the Commission's decision was not supported by substantial evidence because the Commission's finding that McDonald violated Stations's\r\nloan policy was based upon a written loan policy not admitted before the Commission's Appeal Tribunal. &nbsp;The Commission contends its decision did not\r\nnecessitate considering evidence outside the record because the record contained uncontradicted testimony that its loan policy prohibited all loans without\r\nsupervisor or ownership approval.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;Substantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative\r\nagency reached.&quot;&nbsp; McEachern v. S.C. Emp't Sec. Comm'n, 370 S.C. 553, 557, 635 S.E.2d 644, 647\r\n(Ct. App. 2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).&nbsp; An employee is ineligible for unemployment benefits if the employee was &quot;discharge[d]\r\nfor cause connected with the employment.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-35-120(2) (Supp. 2010).&nbsp; The phrase discharge for cause &quot;include[s] the\r\ndisregard of the standard of behavior which an employer can [rightfully expect] from an employee.&quot;&nbsp; Mickens v. Southland Exch.-Joint Venture,\r\n305 S.C. 127, 130, 406 S.E.2d 363, 365 (1991) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).&nbsp;\r\nHere, McDonald made a loan without prior approval, and Stations's witnesses testified it prohibited all unauthorized loans when McDonald made the loan.&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court erred in finding substantial evidence did not support the Commission's finding McDonald was fired for cause.&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp; Sufficiency of the Commission's Findings\r\nThe circuit court held the Commission's findings were insufficient because the Commission (1) reversed the appeal tribunal's findings as to McDonald's\r\ncredibility without making specific findings of its own and (2) referred to a loan policy held by Stations and violated by McDonald without making a finding\r\nregarding what the policy prohibited.&nbsp; The Commission argues its findings were sufficient.&nbsp; We agree.\r\nThis court typically &quot;defer[s] to the judgment of the&quot; Commission &quot;on questions of witness credibility.&quot;&nbsp; Milliken &amp; Co. v.\r\nS.C. Emp't Sec. Comm'n, 321 S.C. 349, 350, 468 S.E.2d 638, 639 (1996).&nbsp; Generally, an administrative body's &quot;'findings of fact .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\nmust be sufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court to determine whether the findings are supported by the evidence and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. law\r\n.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.'&quot;&nbsp; Porter v. Labor Depot, 372 S.C. 560, 568-69, 643 S.E.2d 96, 100-01 (Ct.

Pub.\r\nServ. Comm'n of S.C., 338 S.C. 92, 96, 525 S.E.2d 863, 865 (1999).&nbsp; However, a reviewing court need not remand the case if the written order's\r\nfindings, credibility determinations, and legal analysis make those unexpressed findings &quot;manifest.&quot;&nbsp; See Spartanburg Reg'l Med. Ctr.\r\nv. Oncology &amp; Hematology Assocs. of S.C., LLC, 387 S.C. 79, 92, 690 S.E.2d 783, 790 (2010) (citation omitted).&nbsp;\r\nHere, the Commission provided sufficient findings about McDonald's credibility.&nbsp; The Commission recited the testimony of McDonald and Stations's\r\nwitnesses, and it subsequently outlined reasons for why McDonald's testimony was not credible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the Commission provided sufficient findings\r\nabout the substance of Stations's loan policy.&nbsp; Although the Commission did not make an express finding about what the policy specifically prohibited, the\r\nCommission's factual findings, credibility determinations, and legal analysis clearly reflected it found Stations's policy prohibited all loans made without\r\nprior authorization.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Commission's order was sufficient to enable review.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Incomplete Record\r\nThe circuit court also held the Commission submitted an incomplete record because the Commission failed to include in its record a brief and motion made by\r\nStations relating to the introduction of Stations's written loan policy.&nbsp; In response, the Commission argues it was not required to include the motion and\r\nbrief in the record on appeal to the circuit court.\r\nGenerally, the Commission must file with the circuit court &quot;all documents .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. taken in the matter,&quot; and the circuit court's review is\r\nconfined to that record.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-23-380(5) &amp; 41-35-750 (Supp. 2010).&nbsp; Yet even if the Commission failed to comply with a\r\nduty to include the brief and motion, the alleged failure did not make the record insufficient to review whether the Commission's decision was supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence.&nbsp; See Wilson v. Am. Cas. Ins., 252 S.C. 393, 397, 166 S.E.2d 797, 798 (1969) (providing that the purpose of requiring a\r\nparty to provide a record on appeal is to give the reviewing court the ability to decide whether the lower court erred in the respects alleged).&nbsp; The\r\nprovided record included sufficient testimony about Stations's loan policy and McDonald's actions to review the decision.&nbsp; Accordingly, the circuit court\r\nerred in reversing the Commission's decision for failure to include the motion and brief in its record.&nbsp;\r\nREVERSED.\r\nFEW, C.J., THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-159","title":"State v.

McCulloch, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; The State appeals the circuit court's order affirming the dismissal of Ryan Hercheck's driving under the influence (DUI) charge,\r\narguing the circuit court erred in finding section 56-5-2953 of the South Carolina Code (2006)[1] requires law\r\nenforcement to videotape an individual for the entire twenty-minute pre-test waiting period after the individual indicates he or she will not submit to the\r\nbreath test.&nbsp; In the alternative, the State asserts the circuit court erred in failing to find, under the totality of the circumstances, valid reason\r\nexisted for failing to produce a statutorily compliant videotape.&nbsp; We affirm.[2]&nbsp;\r\n1.&nbsp; With regard to the circuit court's interpretation of section 56-5-2953, the plain language[3] of\r\nsubsection 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) mandates a twenty minute video-recording of the arrested individual's conduct during the breath test waiting period and no\r\nexception exists permitting premature termination of the videotaping in the event the arrested individual indicates he or she will not submit to the breath\r\ntest.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) (2006) (stating the videotaping at the breath site &quot;must also include the person's conduct\r\nduring the required twenty-minute pre-test waiting period, unless the officer submits a sworn affidavit certifying that it was physically impossible to\r\nvideotape this waiting period. However, if the arresting officer administers the breath test, the person's conduct during the twenty-minute pre-test waiting\r\nperiod must be videotaped.&quot;).\r\n2.&nbsp; With regard to whether the circuit court erred in failing to find the videotape complied with section 56-5-2953(A) under the totality of the\r\ncircumstances provision of subsection (B), we find the circuit court's refusal to reverse the magistrate court's determination that the exceptions of subsection\r\n(B) were inapplicable in this case was not an error of law.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(B) (2006) (stating noncompliance with subsection (A)(1)\r\ndoes not automatically require the dismissal of a DUI if the officer submits a sworn affidavit certifying: (1) the video recording equipment was\r\ninoperable and reasonable efforts were made to maintain the equipment; or (2) &quot;it was physically impossible to produce the video recording\r\nbecause the person needed emergency medical treatment&quot;; or (3) &quot;exigent circumstances existed,&quot; and providing &quot;[n]othing in this\r\nsection prohibits the court from considering any other valid reason for the failure to produce the videotape based upon the totality of the circumstances; nor\r\ndo the provisions of this section prohibit the person from offering evidence relating to the arresting law enforcement officer's failure to produce the\r\nvideotape.&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-25-105 (Supp. 2010) (stating in criminal appeals from the magistrate court, the circuit court does not conduct a de novo\r\nreview); City of Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 374 S.C. 12, 15, 646 S.E.2d 879, 880&nbsp;(2007) (stating in criminal cases, the appellate court reviews errors\r\nof law only; therefore, this court's scope of review is limited to correcting the circuit court's errors of law).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[1] This section was amended by 2008 Act Number 201, section 11, with an effective date of February 10,\r\n2009.&nbsp; S.C.

Chase, and E.\r\n          Courtney Gruber, all of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Francis J. Bolds, Jr. appeals the single scheduled\r\n  benefits award for a twenty percent permanent partial disability to his back by\r\n  the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (the\r\n  Appellate Panel).Â  On appeal, Bolds argues the Appellate Panel erred in denying\r\n  him a general disability award because his back injury affected other parts of\r\n  his body.Â  We affirm.[1] Â \r\nThree types of disability\r\n  exist under the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act (the Act): total disability, partial\r\n  disability, and scheduled disability.Â  Wigfall v. Tideland Utils., Inc.,&nbsp; 354 S.C. 100, 105, 580 S.E.2d 100,\r\n  102&nbsp;(2003).Â  &quot;A claimant may obtain total disability in one of three\r\n  ways under [section] 42-9-10.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;First, a claimant may be presumptively totally\r\n  disabled&quot; by showing &quot;a physical injury enumerated\r\n  in [section] 42-9-10.&quot;Â Â  Id.Â  &quot;Second, a claimant may establish total disability under [section]\r\n  42-9-10 by showing an injury, which is not a [section] 42-9-30 scheduled injury,\r\n  caused sufficient loss of earning capacity to render him totally disabled.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Third, a claimant may establish total disability through\r\n  multiple physical injuries.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  106, 580 S.E.2d at 103.Â  \r\nA claimant is precluded from general disability and\r\n  limited to compensation for a scheduled disability &quot;[w]here\r\n  the injury is confined to the scheduled member, and there is no impairment of\r\n  any other part of the body because of such injury . . .Â  even though other\r\n  considerations such as age, lack of training, or other conditions peculiar to\r\n  the individual, effect a total or partial industrial incapacity.&quot;Â  Singleton\r\n    v. Young LumberÂ  Co.,&nbsp; 236 S.C. 454, 471, 114 S.E.2d 837,\r\n  845&nbsp;(1960).Â  However, an exception permits compensation for a general\r\n  disability when a claimant can &quot;show that some other part of his body is affected&quot; by the\r\n  scheduled injury.Â  Id.Â  For the purposes of the Act, impairment encompasses a physical deficiency.Â  Wigfall,&nbsp;\r\n  354 S.C. at 104, 580 S.E.2d at 102.Â  In South Carolina, the &quot;situs of injury&quot; test governs the determination of scheduled recovery benefits.Â  Therrell v. Jerry's Inc., 370 S.C. 22, 28, 633 S.E.2d 893, 896 (2006).Â  &quot;[T]he 'situs of the injury' approach focuses on the\r\n  injured body part in determining how the injury is properly compensated.&quot;Â  Id. at 27, 633 S.E.2d at 896. \r\n  Here, the Appellate Panel did not\r\n  err in denying Bolds's claim for general disability and finding Bolds's back\r\n  injury was confined to a single scheduled member.Â  Although evidence was\r\n  presented showing that Bolds's back injury affected other parts of his body, evidence\r\n  also existed showing that Bolds's back injury did not result in additional\r\n  physical deficiencies.Â  See Singleton,&nbsp; 236 S.C. at 471, 114\r\n  S.E.2d at 845 (finding an injury will be confined to a scheduled member award unless\r\n  an impairment of another part of the body exists); see also Wigfall,&nbsp;354\r\n  S.C. at 104, 580 S.E.2d at 102 (noting for the purposes of the Act, impairment encompasses a physical deficiency). Â Dr. Patel, Dr. Ahearn, and Dr. Stovall agreed that\r\n  Bolds's back injury caused radiculopathy[2] in his left arm and right leg.Â  However, Dr. Patel, Dr. Ahearn, and Dr. Stovall\r\n  noted Bolds did not suffer from any additional physical deficiencies from this\r\n  injury.Â  Their reports indicated Bolds's arms and legs had normal muscle\r\n  strength and tone. They also found Bolds had a good range of motion in his arms\r\n  and legs as well as a normal gait.Â  Accordingly, we find substantial evidence\r\n  supports the Appellate Panel decision to award a scheduled member award.[3] Â Â \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Appellate Panel is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] &quot;Radiculopathy refers to any disease that\r\n  affects the spinal nerve roots.&quot;Â  Medline Plus, http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000442.htm\r\n  (last visited May 18, 2011).Â  \r\n[3] Additionally, Bolds's argument regarding the\r\n  Appellate Panel's application of Therrell is without merit.Â  The\r\n  Appellate Panel did not improperly apply Therrell's situs of injury test\r\n  as the reason for declining to award general disability. Instead, in making its\r\n  ruling, the Appellate Panel found Bolds's back injury was the only permanent\r\n  injury for which he suffered.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-163","title":"Samonsky v.

Chase, all of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: &nbsp;Steven R. Samonsky appeals a circuit court order that affirmed a denial of temporary benefits and medical expenses by the Appellate\r\nPanel of the Workers' Compensation Commission (the Appellate Panel).&nbsp; The Appellate Panel adopted a single commissioner's holding that the evidence\r\nSamonsky's hernias, vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus arose out of his employment at BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc. (BellSouth) was speculative.&nbsp; We\r\naffirm.[1]\r\nI.&nbsp; Samonsky's Injuries\r\nSamonsky contends the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panel's denial of temporary benefits and medical expenses for his claims for hearing\r\nloss, tinnitus, vertigo, and hernias.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nIn a workers' compensation case, &quot;[a]n appellate court can reverse or modify the [Appellate Panel]'s decision if it is affected by an error of law\r\nor&quot; not supported by &quot;substantial evidence.&quot;&nbsp; Pierre v. Seaside Farms, Inc., 386 S.C. 534, 540, 689 S.E.2d 615, 618 (2010).&nbsp;\r\n&quot;Substantial evidence is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency\r\nreached.&quot;&nbsp; Tennant v. Beaufort Cnty. Sch. Dist., 381 S.C. 617, 620, 674 S.E.2d 488, 490 (2009).&nbsp; &quot;The burden is on the claimant to\r\nprove such facts as will render the injury compensable, and such an award must not be based on surmise, conjecture or speculation.&quot;&nbsp; Crosby v.\r\nWal-Mart Store, Inc., 330 S.C. 489, 496, 499 S.E.2d 253, 257 (Ct. App. 1998).&nbsp; Moreover, &quot;[t]he final determination of witness credibility and the\r\nweight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.&quot;&nbsp; Watt v. Piedmont Auto., 384 S.C. 203, 207, 681 S.E.2d 615, 617 (Ct. App.\r\n2009)\r\n&quot;A claimant may recover workers' compensation benefits if he sustains an 'injury by accident arising out of and in the course of\r\nemployment.'&quot;&nbsp; Pierre, 386 S.C. at 541, 689 S.E.2d at 618 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160(A) (Supp. 2010)).&nbsp; To arise out of\r\nemployment, the injury must have a &quot;causal connection&quot; to the claimant's work. Ervin v. Richland Mem'l Hosp., 386 S.C. 245, 249, 687 S.E.2d\r\n337, 339 (Ct. App. 2009) (citation omitted).&nbsp;\r\nHere, substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panel's finding the claims for vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus were speculative.&nbsp; Samonsky's\r\ndoctor would not testify Samonsky's employment caused the vertigo, and the Appellate Panel found Samonsky's testimony was not credible.&nbsp; Moreover, the\r\ndoctor's testimony that the hearing loss and tinnitus were caused by noise from the van Samonsky drove for BellSouth was based solely upon Samonsky's statements\r\nto the doctor that the van was loud.&nbsp; Most importantly, independent testing of the noise emitted by the van indicated the noise was at safe levels.&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, the Appellate Panel properly denied the claims for vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus.\r\nSubstantial evidence also supports the Appellate Panel's finding the hernia claims were speculative.&nbsp; The Appellate Panel found Samonsky's testimony as\r\nto the date and cause of his hernias was not credible, and the surgeon who treated the hernias sent a letter to Samonsky stating the surgeon was not qualified\r\nto establish the cause of those injuries.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Appellate Panel properly denied the hernia claims.\r\nII.&nbsp; Perjury, Fraud, and Fraud Upon the Court\r\nSamonsky argues the circuit court erred in declining to set aside the Appellate Panel's decision because BellSouth, its witnesses, and its counsel committed\r\nperjury, fraud, and fraud upon the court.&nbsp; According to Samonsky, they concealed noise problems in the van he drove during the course of his employment to\r\nprevent him from recovering for his vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus claims.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nTo set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court, the conduct alleged must constitute &quot;extrinsic fraud&quot; rather than &quot;intrinsic\r\nfraud.&quot;&nbsp; Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 80-81, 579 S.E.2d 605, 610 (2003).&nbsp; &quot;Extrinsic fraud is fraud that induces a person\r\nnot to present a case or deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).&nbsp; &quot;Intrinsic fraud is fraud which was presented and considered in the trial.&nbsp; It is fraud which misleads a court in determining issues\r\n.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;&nbsp; Id. (citation omitted).&nbsp; &quot;The subornation of perjury by an attorney and/or the intentional concealment of\r\ndocuments by an attorney are actions which constitute extrinsic fraud.&quot;&nbsp; Id. at 82, 579 S.E.2d at 610.&nbsp;\r\nHere, Samonsky's assertion of mere perjury and use of a fraudulent document is insufficient to set aside the Appellate Panel's decision because that conduct\r\nconstitutes intrinsic fraud.&nbsp; See id. at 81 n.4, 579 S.E.2d at 610 n.4 (stating that without more, &quot;perjury or use of a fraudulent\r\ndocument&quot; is merely intrinsic fraud) (citations omitted).&nbsp; Moreover, Samonsky failed to introduce any evidence BellSouth's counsel knew or was\r\ninvolved in any fraudulent or perjurious conduct relating to the van's noise problems.&nbsp; Consequently, Samonsky failed to introduce evidence of extrinsic\r\nfraud and fraud upon the court, and the Appellate Panel properly declined to set aside the single commissioner's decision.&nbsp;\r\nIII.&nbsp; Remaining Arguments\r\nWith regard to Samonsky's remaining arguments, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: Clark v. Aiken Cnty. Gov't,\r\n366 S.C. 102, 108, 620 S.E.2d 99, 102 (Ct.

Thayer Rivers, Jr., of Ridgeland, for Appellant.\r\n        Terry A. Finger, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Rock Hill Investment Group, LLC (Rock Hill) appeals\r\n  the order of Special Referee Thomas Kemmerlin, Jr. dismissing its action\r\n  against Respondent Brenda Horton to collect a deficiency judgment and ordering\r\n  that Horton's five percent deposit on the property she initially bid on at a\r\n  judicial sale be forfeited.Â  On appeal, Rock Hill argues that a prior\r\n  unappealed order from Special Referee Curtis Coltrane denying Horton's motion\r\n  to set aside the judicial sale is controlling on all issues presented in Judge\r\n  Kemmerlin's order.Â  In its second issue, Rock Hill argues that Judge\r\n  Kemmerlin's order is not correct.Â  We affirm[1] pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: \r\n1.&nbsp; As to the first issue on appeal,\r\n  we find that Judge Coltrane's order is not controlling on all issues presented\r\n  in Judge Kemmerlin's order.Â  At the time of the hearing, Horton was not yet a\r\n  party to an action between herself and Rock Hill because a deficiency did not\r\n  exist at that time, nor would Horton have been aware that an action for\r\n  deficiency would be brought against her. Â As no action for deficiency would\r\n  have been brought against her until the actual deficiency existed, a dispute\r\n  concerning the &quot;risk&quot; to the noncomplying bidder would not be ripe\r\n  for adjudication at the time of Judge Coltrane's hearing.Â  Furthermore, Judge\r\n  Coltrane's order resulting from Horton's motion to set aside the judicial sale did\r\n  not involve the same issues covered in Judge Kemmerlin's order. Â See Colleton\r\n    Cnty. Taxpayers Ass'n v. Sch. Dist. of Colleton Cnty.,&nbsp;371 S.C. 224,\r\n  242, 638 S.E.2d 685, 694&nbsp;(2006) (&quot;[A] justiciable controversy is a\r\n  real and substantial controversy which is ripe and appropriate for judicial\r\n  determination, as distinguished from a contingent, hypothetical or abstract\r\n  dispute.&quot;); Matheson v.

Kouten, of Johns Island, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this probate matter, Betty Fisher and\r\n  Lisa Fisher appeal (1) the appointment of Bessie Huckabee as personal\r\n  representative of the estate of Alice Shaw-Baker and (2) an order modifying a prior\r\n  temporary order that had restrained Huckabee, in her capacity as personal\r\n  representative of Shaw-Baker's estate, from taking any action regarding the\r\n  estate.Â  Under the modified order, Huckabee could continue to administer and\r\n  preserve the estate, but could not disburse or distribute any estate assets\r\n  pending a trial on the merits.Â  We affirm on all issues raised by the Fishers\r\n  in this appeal concerning the modification order and dismiss those issues concerning\r\n  Huckabee's appointment.[1]\r\nAs to the\r\n  modification order, the Fishers argue (1) the order was void because Huckabee's\r\n  attorney failed to copy it to opposing counsel before submitting it to the\r\n  presiding judge, (2) the order lacked the required finding of a change of\r\n  circumstances to warrant modifying the prior order, (3) the circuit court\r\n  should have applied the standard in the South Carolina Probate Code instead of\r\n  that in the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure in determining whether or\r\n  not modification of the prior order was warranted, (4) the provision in the\r\n  modification order requiring the Fishers to post a bond was improper, and (5)\r\n  the modification order was based on the incorrect assumption that Huckabee had\r\n  possession of the estate assets.Â  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR,\r\n  and the following authorities: Rule 81, SCRCP (stating the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Civil Procedure &quot;shall apply insofar as practicable in magistrate's\r\n  courts, probate courts, and family courts to the extent they are not\r\n  inconsistent with the statutes and rules governing those courts&quot;); Mims\r\n    v. Alston, 312 S.C. 311, 314 n.1, 440 S.E.2d 357, 359 n.1 (1994) (refusing\r\n  to address an issue because &quot;it was not raised or ruled upon below&quot;); In re Timmerman, 331 S.C. 455, 460, 502 S.E.2d 920, 922 (Ct. App. 1998)\r\n  (&quot;When a party receives an order that grants certain relief not previously\r\n  contemplated or presented to the trial court, the aggrieved party must move,\r\n  pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment in order to\r\n  preserve the issue for appeal.&quot;).Â  Furthermore, as to issue (5), we hold\r\n  that if the finding that Huckabee had possession of the estate assets is\r\n  premature or otherwise incorrect, the error does not prejudice the Fishers in\r\n  that under Huckabee, in her capacity as personal representative, has been\r\n  restrained from making disbursements or distributions from the estate and\r\n  counsel for the Fishers, on page 13 of the Appendix to the Record on Appeal,\r\n  has implicitly acknowledged that Lisa Fisher has been ordered by the probate\r\n  court to turn over the estate assets in her possession.\r\nAs to the order\r\n  appointing Huckabee personal representative of the estate, the Fishers contend\r\n  (1) the order is void because they were not given proper notice of Huckabee's\r\n  intent to seek the appointment, (2) the order lacks the requisite findings of\r\n  fact, (3) Huckabee is not qualified to serve as personal representative because\r\n  her interests are adverse to those of the estate, and (4) they should not have\r\n  to wait until a merits hearing in the probate court for a review of the\r\n  appointment.Â  On page 19 of the Appendix to the Record on Appeal, counsel for\r\n  the Fishers advised the circuit court that he had &quot;a pending motion to\r\n  replace the PR and to appoint a special administrator.&quot;Â  We, therefore, hold\r\n  the issues raised by the Fishers to this court regarding the propriety of the\r\n  appointment are interlocutory and decline to address them at this time.Â  See Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hosp.

As to whether the trial court erred in allowing the exclusion despite the Carters' contention it is inconsistent with statutory portions: Nakatsu v.\r\nEncompass Indemnity Co., 390 S.C. 172, 178, 700 S.E.2d 283, 287 (Ct.

Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1700(C) (Supp. 2010).Â  \r\nHere, no compelling reason\r\n  supports the family court's approval of a permanent plan other than TPR. Â Father's\r\n  incarceration prevented reunification prior to the child's spending over\r\n  eighteen months in foster care, and no viable relatives were available to care\r\n  for the child.Â  Additionally, evidence supported the family court's finding TPR\r\n  would be in the child's best interest.Â  At the time of the trial, the child\r\n  would have had to remain in foster care for at least another sixteen months\r\n  awaiting Father's release from prison, even though child does not know Father.Â \r\n  In comparison, Child's foster parents are interested in adoption now and\r\n  Child's assessment revealed he is a good candidate for adoption.Â  The child's\r\n  therapist testified waiting for Father's release from prison would place child\r\n  at a greater risk for social and emotional problems and attachment disorder.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the family court\r\n  did not err in adopting the permanency planning order of TPR.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J.,\r\n  KONDUROS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-177","title":"SCDMV v.

Valenta, Jr., Philip S. Porter, and\r\n  Linda A. Grice, all of Blythewood, for Appellant.\r\nSharon Westfall, pro se, of Camden, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\nPER CURIAM: Â The\r\n  South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (the DMV) appeals the reinstatement\r\n  of Sharon Westfall's driver's license by the Department of Motor Vehicle\r\n  Hearings (the DMVH).Â  The DMV argues the administrative law court (the ALC)\r\n  erred in (1) dismissing the DMV's appeal for failure to provide a sufficient\r\n  record and (2) adopting the DMVH's order that allegedly misconstrued statutory\r\n  law in reinstating the license.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nThe\r\n  legislature has established &quot;the standard of review when the court of\r\n  appeals is sitting in review of a decision by the ALC on an appeal from an\r\n  administrative agency.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Motor\r\n    Vehicles v. Holtzclaw, 382 S.C. 344, 347, 675 S.E.2d 756, 758 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009).Â  &quot;The court of appeals may affirm the decision or remand the case for\r\n  further proceedings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  Moreover, it &quot;may reverse or modify the decision .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n  if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the decision is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. characterized by an abuse of\r\n  discretion .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Holtzclaw, 382 S.C. at 347, 675\r\n  S.E.2d at 758.\r\nI.Â  Insufficient\r\n  Record\r\nThe ALC dismissed the DMV's appeal\r\n  for failure to provide a sufficient record, reasoning a fair review of the case\r\n  was impossible because the record did not include a transcript of the testimony\r\n  and the tape of the testimony in the administrative hearing was blank.Â  The DMV\r\n  argues the ALC overlooked the duty of the DMVH to produce the record for the\r\n  ALC's review.Â  We agree.\r\n&quot;An abuse of discretion occurs where the\r\n  trial judge['s decision] was controlled by an error of law .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corrs., 368 S.C. 424, 438, 629 S.E.2d 642, 650\r\n  (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).Â  In proceedings before the DMVH,\r\n  &quot;[t]ape recordings of all hearings will be made part of the record on\r\n  appeal,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and copies will be provided to parties to those\r\n  appeals at no charge.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-660 (Supp. 2007).Â  &quot;Appeals from decisions\r\n  of the [DMVH] must be taken to the [ALC] pursuant to the [ALC]'s appellate\r\n  rules of procedure.&quot;Â  Id.Â  And &quot;on its own motion, [the ALC]\r\n  may dismiss an appeal for failure to comply with any of the rules of procedure\r\n  for appeals .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  Rule 38, SCALCR.Â  Under the ALC's\r\n  procedural rules, the agency with possession of the record of the proceedings\r\n  must file the record with the ALC and serve a copy on each party to the appeal.Â  Rule 35, SCALCR; Rule 36(A), SCALCR.Â  The record must\r\n  include a transcript of the testimony.Â  Rule 36(B), SCALCR.Â  \r\nHere, the ALC abused its discretion in dismissing the appeal\r\n  with prejudice.Â  Although the ALC's procedural rules give the ALC broad\r\n  discretion in dismissing appeals for failure to follow the rules, the ALC's\r\n  dismissal of this appeal (1) was inconsistent with policy underlying the burden\r\n  of providing sufficient records and (2) misconstrued the duties upon the\r\n  parties.Â  Dismissals of appeals for failure to provide a sufficient record\r\n  reflect the general policy that appellants have the duty to provide the record\r\n  to the reviewing court.Â  Helms Realty,\r\n    Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 339, 611 S.E.2d\r\n  485, 488-89 (2005).Â  However, in appeals from the DMVH, the DMV has neither a duty to\r\n  tape the proceedings nor a duty to file a transcript with the ALC.Â  Both of those\r\n  duties fall upon the DMVH, and in this case, the DMVH breached those duties.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the ALC's dismissal of this case for failure to comply with a duty placed upon\r\n  a nonparty is an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we remand the case to\r\n  the ALC to reconstruct the record and address the merits. \r\nII.Â Â  Construction\r\n  of Statutory Law\r\nThe DMV argues the ALC's\r\n  decision to uphold and adopt the DMVH's order should be reversed because the DMVH\r\n  erroneously considered whether Westfall was notified that her insurance had\r\n  lapsed before the accident and whether she was at fault in the accident.Â  Because\r\n  we reverse and remand the case on the first issue, we need not address this argument.\r\n  Â See Bailey\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 388 S.C. 1, 8, 693 S.E.2d\r\n  426, 430 (Ct.

Frederic\r\n          Marcinak, both of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Donnie\r\n  Merck appeals a decision by the Appellate Panel of the Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission (the Appellate Panel) denying him total and temporary disability\r\n  benefits and medical expenses for failing to sufficiently notify J. D.\r\n  Hollingsworth on Wheels, Inc. (Employer) of injuries to his shoulder and knee within\r\n  ninety days of when he discovered the injuries were work-related.Â  Merck argues\r\n  the Appellate Panel erred in (1) applying the ninety-day notice requirement to\r\n  his repetitive trauma claims; (2) barring his claims for failure to comply with\r\n  that requirement; and (3) failing to grant an upward adjustment to his average\r\n  weekly wage.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n&quot;[T]his court can reverse or modify the Appellate\r\n  Panel's decision only if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the decision is affected by an error\r\n  of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and\r\n  substantial evidence on the whole record.&quot;Â  Watt v. Piedmont Auto.,\r\n  384 S.C. 203, 207, 681 S.E.2d 615, 617 (Ct. App. 2009) (citations omitted).Â  &quot;Substantial\r\n  evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering\r\n  the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the\r\n  agency reached.&quot; Â Id. (citation and internal quotation marks\r\n  omitted).\r\n1. Merck first claims the ninety-day notice requirement does\r\n  not apply to his claims because the 2007 amendments to the Workers'\r\n  Compensation Act (the Act) impliedly remove the notice requirement in\r\n  repetitive trauma cases.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder the Act, an\r\n  employee must give notice to an employer &quot;within ninety days of the date\r\n  the employee discovered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. his condition is\r\n  compensable&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20(C)\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  The 2007 amendments to the\r\n  Act provide that a claimant's testimony cannot establish &quot;cause&quot; in a\r\n  legal hearing, but those amendments do not directly state nor imply they affect\r\n  the notice requirement. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  42-1-172(B) (Supp. 2010) (providing that a repetitive trauma\r\n  injury is not compensable &quot;unless a commissioner makes a specific finding\r\n  of fact .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of a causal connection that is established by medical\r\n  evidence between the repetitive activities that occurred while the employee was\r\n  engaged in the regular duties of his employment and the injury&quot;); id. Â§ 42-1-172(C) (&quot;'[M]edical evidence' means expert opinion or testimony\r\n  stated to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, documents, records, or\r\n  other material that is offered by a licensed and qualified medical physician.&quot;).Â  Notice requires only the employer's knowledge of facts that connect the\r\n  injury with the employment, and it can be established\r\n  by knowledge the injury occurred and of the claimant's work responsibilities.Â  Etheredge\r\n    v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 459, 562 S.E.2d 679, 683 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n2. As to whether the Appellate Panel erred in barring\r\n  Merck's claims for failure to comply with the ninety-day notice requirement, we\r\n  affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: S.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;42-15-20(C) (Supp. 2010) (stating a\r\n  claimant cannot receive compensation for a repetitive trauma injury unless the\r\n  claimant gives notice to the employer &quot;within ninety days of the date the\r\n  employee discovered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that his condition is compensable&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&quot;); Etheredge, 349 S.C. at 459, 562 S.E.2d at 683 (&quot;[N]otice is\r\n  adequate, when there is some knowledge of accompanying facts connecting the injury or illness with the employment, and signifying to a\r\n  reasonably conscientious supervisor that the case might involve a potential\r\n  compensation claim.&quot;); see also Watt, 384 S.C. at 207, 681\r\n  S.E.2d at 617 (&quot;The possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions\r\n  does not prevent the Appellate Panel's conclusions from being supported by\r\n  substantial evidence.&quot;); Bass v.

As to whether the\r\n  Appellate Panel erred in failing to grant an upward adjustment to his average\r\n  weekly wage, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following\r\n  authority: Bailey v.

Bond, both of John's Island; and G.\r\n          Thomas Hill, of Ravenel, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Respondents, James\r\n  and Virginia Meyer (collectively &quot;Taxpayers&quot;), brought this quiet\r\n  title action to recover their John's Island home after Appellants, Larry and\r\n  Frances Goodwin (&quot;Purchasers&quot;), purchased the home at a tax sale.Â \r\n  The Master-in-Equity granted the requested relief, and Purchasers appealed.Â \r\n  Purchasers argue that the master erred in concluding the Charleston County Tax\r\n  Collector (&quot;the County&quot;) failed to comply with the notice\r\n  requirements of sections 12-51-40 &amp; -120 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2010) in collecting taxes on the John's Island home.[1]Â \r\n  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nMorris Brooke\r\n  (Mortgagee) hired Virginia Meyer to provide caregiving services to his wife,\r\n  Peg Brooke, after she suffered from a brain aneurism that left her physically\r\n  and cognitively handicapped.Â  Mortgagee determined that to best meet his\r\n  family's needs, he would assist Taxpayers in building a house large enough so\r\n  that he, Mrs. Brooke, and Taxpayers could live together.Â  Mortgagee loaned\r\n  Taxpayers the funds necessary to buy a lot on John's Island and to build a\r\n  house on it.Â  Mortgagee also agreed to pay the expenses for an elevator and a\r\n  handicapped bathroom in the house.Â  \r\nOn April 7,\r\n  2003, Taxpayers purchased the lot at 1367 River Road on John's Island from developer\r\n  Macarena Keating for $140,000.[2]Â \r\n  Taxpayers were under the mistaken impression that the 2004 taxes on the lot\r\n  were paid out of the proceeds from the closing of the sale. Â On April 9, 2003, Taxpayers\r\n  granted a first mortgage on the property to Mortgagee in the amount of $165,000.Â \r\n  As construction expenses increased, Mortgagee loaned an additional $235,000 to\r\n  Taxpayers in return for a second mortgage on the premises.Â  Â Â \r\nIn March of\r\n  2004, Taxpayers conveyed back to Mrs. Keating a portion of their lot, 0.412 of\r\n  an acre, for the sum of $35,000.Â  Taxpayers used this sum to fund ongoing\r\n  construction on their remaining property, and Mrs. Keating sold the new\r\n  .412-acre lot to Linda Bond, a cross-defendant in this action.[3]\r\nOn April 15,\r\n  2005, Taxpayers sold their residence at 1 South Held Circle on James Island in\r\n  anticipation of moving into their new home on John's Island.Â  During the\r\n  completion of construction on the new home, Taxpayers lived in an apartment on\r\n  James Island until August 1, 2005, when the apartment lease expired.Â  They then\r\n  stayed with various friends and relatives until they received a certificate of\r\n  occupancy for the John's Island home on November 22, 2005.Â  \r\nIn the meantime,\r\n  the County began the process of collecting the delinquent 2004 taxes on\r\n  Taxpayers' lot by mailing an Execution Notice dated April 11, 2005, to\r\n  Taxpayers at the South Held Circle address.[4]Â \r\n  The exact date that the notice was actually mailed is unknown.Â  Notably, all\r\n  envelopes used by the County had the notation &quot;Return Service\r\n  Requested,&quot; which required the postal service to return undeliverable mail\r\n  sent by the County back to the County rather than forwarding the mail.Â  Due to\r\n  the Taxpayers' April 15th move date, and due to the delay between dates on\r\n  County letters and their actual mailing dates, the master found credible Taxpayers'\r\n  assertion that they did not receive the Execution Notice.Â  \r\nIn a continued\r\n  attempt to collect the 2004 taxes, the County sent a Notice of Levy to\r\n  Taxpayers at the South Held Circle address by certified mail, return receipt\r\n  requested, restricted delivery.Â  The letter was returned to the County on June\r\n  20, 2005, stamped &quot;Unclaimed.&quot;Â  Virginia Meyer had signed the return\r\n  receipt; however, the signature of both Taxpayers was required before the\r\n  postal service would release the letter.Â  James Meyer went to the post office\r\n  to sign for the letter, but he was informed that the letter had already been\r\n  returned to the County.Â  \r\nThe County later\r\n  attempted to post a notice on the property at 1367 River Road informing\r\n  Taxpayers that the property was officially &quot;seized&quot; and would be sold\r\n  on October 3, 2005, to satisfy delinquent taxes.Â  However, Taxpayers testified\r\n  that they never saw such a notice.Â  A tax sale was conducted on October 3, 2005,\r\n  and Purchasers submitted a successful bid.Â  \r\nStill unaware of\r\n  the delinquency for the 2004 tax year, Taxpayers filed with the County\r\n  Assessor's Office an application for an adjustment of the 2005 taxes for the 4%\r\n  qualified residential rate.Â  On July 24, 2006, Mr. Meyer spoke with various\r\n  County employees by telephone concerning the 2005 taxes.Â  He was informed that\r\n  the application for the 4% rate had been approved, and he was directed to the Delinquent\r\n  Tax Department to obtain the exact amount due.Â  Martine McPherson, an\r\n  Accounting Technician in the Delinquent Tax Department, informed Mr. Meyer that\r\n  the property had been sold at a tax sale in 2005. Â Mrs. McPherson noted that\r\n  Mr. Meyer seemed &quot;shocked.&quot;Â  \r\nOn September 12,\r\n  2006, the County mailed correspondence to Taxpayers advising them that the one-year\r\n  period in which they were allowed to redeem the property would expire on\r\n  October 4, 2006.[5]Â \r\n  The County sent a similar notice to Mortgagee.Â  All of the notices were\r\n  returned to the County as undelivered.Â  Mortgagee was out of the state for his\r\n  son's wedding in Pennsylvania when the notice of redemption was mailed to him,\r\n  and he did not return to South Carolina until October 2, 2006.Â  He never found\r\n  the notice of redemption in his mailbox or in the mail he retrieved from the\r\n  post office.Â  \r\nOn October 27,\r\n  2006, Taxpayers filed an action to quiet title to their John's Island property.[6]Â \r\n  The parties signed a Consent Order prohibiting the County from issuing a tax\r\n  deed to Purchasers.Â  Therefore, Taxpayers continued to live in their John's\r\n  Island home and to complete the construction of their home.Â  \r\nAt the hearing\r\n  before the master, Taxpayers testified and presented the testimony of Mortgagee\r\n  and Joseph Keating.Â  The County presented the testimony of Dionne Brown, a\r\n  Revenue Specialist in the County's Delinquent Tax Department, and Martine\r\n  McPherson, the Accounting Technician in the Delinquent Tax Department.Â  Mrs.\r\n  Brown testified that she mailed the Execution Notice and the Notice of Levy to\r\n  Taxpayers and that she later posted a delinquent tax notice to their home.Â  However,\r\n  Mr. Keating, who owned the adjacent lot, testified that during the summer of\r\n  2005, he saw the notice of tax sale for Taxpayers' home posted on the stairway\r\n  entrance to his own home.Â  He stated that he did not say anything to Taxpayers\r\n  about the notice and threw it away because he thought that Taxpayers would also\r\n  receive notice of the delinquent taxes in the mail and he did not want to\r\n  embarrass them.Â  He further testified about other mistaken postings in his\r\n  neighborhood due to confusion over addresses.Â  \r\nThe master issued an order\r\n  quieting title in the names of Taxpayers.Â  In his order, he found that at no\r\n  time prior to the tax sale did the County notify Mortgagee of the tax\r\n  delinquency.Â  He also found that Taxpayers would have moved out of the house at\r\n  1 South Held Circle by the time that any Execution Notice would have arrived\r\n  and that Mrs. Brown posted the tax sale notice on the wrong house.Â  The master\r\n  further found that Taxpayers did not receive any of the mailed notices of\r\n  delinquent taxes or the tax sale notice posted on Mr. Keating's house.Â \r\n  Finally, the master found that neither Taxpayers nor Mortgagee received any of\r\n  the notices of redemption mailed by the County.Â  The master concluded that the\r\n  County failed to meet the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-51-40 &amp; -120\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  The master denied Purchasers' motion to alter or amend.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed. Â \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n1. Did\r\n  the master err in concluding that the County violated section 12-51-40(c) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) when it posted the notice of tax sale on\r\n  the wrong house?\r\n2.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the master err in concluding that the County violated section 12-51-40(b) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) by failing to send notice of delinquent\r\n  taxes to Mortgagee prior to the tax sale?\r\n3.&nbsp; Did\r\n  the master err in concluding that the County violated section 12-51-120 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) by not following up on the notices of\r\n  redemption?\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;An\r\n  action to quiet title resides in equity.&quot;Â  Osterneck\r\n    v. Osterneck, 374 S.C. 573, 577, 649 S.E.2d 127, 129&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2007). Â &quot;When\r\n  reviewing an equitable action heard first by a master-in-equity and appealed\r\n  directly to an appellate court, the court should review the facts in accordance\r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of evidence in the record.&quot; Â Id.Â \r\n  However, &quot;[t]his broad scope of review does not require the appellate\r\n  court to ignore the fact that the master was in a better position to\r\n  assess the credibility of witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.&quot;\r\n  Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIntroduction\r\n&quot;In\r\n  South Carolina, 'all requirements of the law leading up to tax sales [that] are\r\n  intended for the protection of the taxpayer against surprise or the sacrifice\r\n  of his property are to be regarded mandatory and are to be strictly enforced.'&quot;Â  Smith v. Barr, 375 S.C. 157, 164, 650 S.E.2d 486, 490&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2007)\r\n  (quoting Donohue\r\n    v. Ward, 298 S.C. 75,\r\n  83, 378 S.E.2d 261, 265 (Ct. App. 1989)). Â &quot;Additionally,\r\n  the failure to give the required statutory notice renders the tax sale invalid.&quot;Â  Smith, 375 S.C. at 164, 650 S.E.2d at 490.Â  &quot;Even\r\n  actual notice is insufficient to uphold a tax sale absent strict compliance\r\n  with statutory requirements.&quot; Â In re Ryan Inv. Co., 335 S.C. 392,\r\n  395, 517 S.E.2d 692, 693 (1999). Â \r\nSection 12-51-40\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) sets forth the alternate procedure for\r\n  notifying a taxpayer of delinquent taxes prior to conducting a tax sale.[7]Â  Section\r\n  12-51-40(a) requires counties to send a notice of delinquent\r\n  property taxes to &quot;the defaulting taxpayer and to a grantee of record of\r\n  the property, whose value generated all or part of the tax.&quot; Â The notice\r\n  must be mailed to the best address available.Â  Â§ 12-51-40(a).Â  Â Â \r\nSubsection\r\n  (b) of section 12-51-40 provides that if the taxes remain unpaid after thirty\r\n  days from the date of mailing of the delinquent notice, a county must mail a\r\n  notice of delinquent property taxes to the defaulting taxpayer and &quot;any\r\n  grantee of record of the property&quot; by certified mail, return receipt\r\n  requested, with delivery restricted to the addressee.Â  Â§ 12-51-40(b).Â  If\r\n  this notice is returned, a\r\n  county must then take exclusive physical possession of the taxpayer's property by\r\n  posting a notice of\r\n  an impending tax sale &quot;at one or more conspicuous places on the premises&quot; pursuant to\r\n  subsection (c) of the statute.Â  Â§ 12-51-40(c).\r\nAfter\r\n  the tax sale, the defaulting taxpayer, a grantee, a mortgagee, or judgment\r\n  creditor may redeem the real property within the following twelve months.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-51-90 (Supp. 2010).Â  A county must send to these persons a notice of the approaching end\r\n  of the redemption period pursuant to section 12-51-120.Â  If the property is not\r\n  redeemed within the allotted time, a county must deliver a tax title to the\r\n  purchaser.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-130 (Supp. 2010).Â  \r\nPosting\r\nPurchasers assert\r\n  that the master erred in concluding\r\n  the County violated section 12-51-40(c) because the evidence shows that the\r\n  County posted the notice of tax sale on the correct house.Â  Purchasers request\r\n  the court to find facts in accordance with the testimony of Dionne Brown, the\r\n  County employee who attempted to post the property.Â  They argue that her\r\n  testimony regarding the location of the posting was more credible than the\r\n  testimony of the Taxpayers' neighbor, Joseph Keating, who indicated that the\r\n  posting was on his own house rather than Taxpayers' house.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAlthough this\r\n  court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence, prudence dictates that we defer to the trier of fact on matters of\r\n  witness credibility.Â  See, e.g., Tiger,\r\n    Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543&nbsp;(1989)\r\n  (holding that while the court could review the evidence to determine facts in\r\n  accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, it would not\r\n  disregard the findings of the master, who saw and heard the witnesses and was\r\n  in a better position to evaluate their credibility); Bishop v. Tolbert,\r\n  249 S.C. 289, 298, 153 S.E.2d 912, 917&nbsp;(1967) (&quot;The issues in the\r\n  trial of this case were essentially factual and since the testimony was in\r\n  sharp conflict, the credibility of the witnesses and the resolution of the\r\n  testimony was a matter peculiarly within the province of the Master.&quot;); Osterneck,\r\n  374 S.C. at 577, 649 S.E.2d at 129 (&quot;This broad scope of\r\n  review does not require the appellate court to ignore the fact that the master\r\n  was in a better position to assess the credibility of witnesses and assign\r\n  weight to their testimony.&quot;).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  see no compelling reason to deviate from the master's credibility assessment\r\n  in the present case.Â  Therefore, we affirm his\r\n  finding that the County failed to post the Taxpayers' property as required by\r\n  section 12-51-40(c).Â  In view of our disposition of this issue, we need not address Purchasers'\r\n  remaining issues. Â See Futch v. McAllister\r\n    Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating that the appellate court need not review\r\n  remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the\r\n  appeal).\r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the master's voiding of the tax sale is AFFIRMED.Â  \r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The relevant\r\n  language in both section 12-51-40 and section 12-51-120 has remained the same since\r\n  January 1, 2001.Â  The tax year in dispute in this case is 2004.Â  Section\r\n  12-51-40 sets forth the requirements for sending notice of delinquent taxes to\r\n  taxpayers and posting a tax sale notice on the property.Â  Section 12-51-120\r\n  sets forth the requirements for sending the notice of redemption to taxpayers\r\n  and other interested persons, such as mortgagees.Â  The requirements of section\r\n  12-51-40(a)-(c) and section 12-51-120 are discussed in greater detail in the\r\n  analysis section of this opinion.Â  \r\n[2] Mrs. Keating\r\n  and her husband, Joseph Keating, owned the adjacent lot, and Mr. Keating\r\n  performed the grading on Taxpayers' lot.Â  Mr. Keating is a cross-defendant in\r\n  this action due to his filing of a mechanics lien on Taxpayers' lot on October\r\n  25, 2006, just days before Taxpayers filed this quiet title action. \r\n[3] Taxpayers granted an easement across their property to Linda Bond.Â  Purchasers\r\n  filed a counterclaim and cross-claim seeking judgment quieting title to the\r\n  John's Island property in their name and also extinguishing Linda Bond's\r\n  easement.Â  \r\n[4] The 2004 taxes\r\n  were assessed on the lot before Taxpayers made any improvements to the lot.Â  \r\n[5] The\r\n  County mailed two notices to Mrs. Meyer individuallyâ€”one at the South Held\r\n  Circle address and the other to the John's Island address.Â  The notice mailed\r\n  to the John's Island address bore an incorrect zip code. Â In a similar fashion,\r\n  the County mailed two notices to Mr. Meyer.Â  Â Â The County also mailed a notice\r\n  to the Taxpayers jointly at the John's Island address with the correct zip\r\n  code.Â  \r\n[6] Taxpayers\r\n  later amended their complaint to add a cause of action for unjust enrichment\r\n  and a cause of action under the South Carolina Betterment Statute, S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 27-27-10 to -100 (2007). \r\n[7] The primary\r\n  procedure for counties to follow in enforcing the payment of property taxes is\r\n  set forth in Title 12, Chapter 49 of the South Carolina Code.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-49-10 to\r\n  -1290 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2010).Â  The provisions in Chapter 51 set forth an\r\n  alternate procedure for counties to use for enforcing the payment of property\r\n  taxes.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-51-40 to -170 (2000 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 2010).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-180","title":"Sanders v.

Barber, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2011-UP-180\r\n  Submitted April 1, 2011 â€“ Filed April 19,\r\n2011Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Cleveland Sanders, pro se, for Appellant.\r\n        Heath McAlvin Stewart, III, of Columbia,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Cleveland Sanders appeals the trial court's order\r\n  dismissing his civil action against the South Carolina Department of CorrectionsÂ­Â­Â­\r\n  (the Department).Â  On appeal, Sanders argues the trial court erred in: (1)\r\n  finding the action under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (the Act) was\r\n  barred because the two-year statute of limitations had run; (2) granting the\r\n  Department's motion for summary judgment on his gross negligence claim under\r\n  the Act; (3) dismissing his claim regarding access to outside dental care; and\r\n  (4) denying his motion for a declaratory judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; As to whether the\r\n  trial court erred in finding Sanders's\r\n  action was barred under the Act because the two-year statute of limitations had\r\n  run: Â The trial court properly held\r\n  Sanders's action was barred by the statute of limitations because Sanders's\r\n  second complaint was not filed within two years after the date of loss. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-78-110 (2005).Â  Â Although the\r\n  exact date of loss is not established in the record, we know Sanders's alleged\r\n  date of loss occurred between November 11, 2001, and August 23, 2002, the time\r\n  he was placed in administrative segregation.Â  The statute of limitations, therefore, tolled no later\r\n  than August 23, 2004.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  evidence in the record suggests Sanders knew of the alleged loss by February\r\n  21, 2003, because he filed his initial\r\n  complaint in state court that day.Â \r\n  Additionally, Sanders failed to timely file after the District Court dismissed\r\n  his initial complaint on February 11,\r\n  2004.Â  In fact, he did not file his\r\n  second state complaint until almost eighteen months after the District Court\r\n  dismissed his complaint.Â  See 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1367(d) (1990) (noting the statute of\r\n  limitations for a claim asserted under this section is tolled for thirty days\r\n  after it is dismissed by the federal courts unless state law provides for a\r\n  longer tolling period).Â Â  Accordingly,\r\n  Sanders's action under the Act was barred by the statute of limitations.[2]\r\n2.&nbsp; As to whether\r\n  the trial court erred in dismissing his\r\n  claim regarding access to a private dentist: We affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment on Sanders's\r\n  access to outside dental care claim.Â  Government has an &quot;obligation to\r\n  provide medical care for those whom it is punishing by incarceration.&quot;Â  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103 (1976). &quot;An inmate must\r\n  rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail\r\n  to do so, those needs will not be met.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;In the worst cases, such a failure may\r\n  actually produce physical 'torture or a lingering death,' â€¦ In less serious\r\n  cases, denial of medical care may result in pain and suffering Â Â . . . .&quot;Â  Id. Â (internal citation omitted).Â  &quot;The infliction of such\r\n  unnecessary suffering is inconsistent with contemporary standards of decency as\r\n  manifested in modern legislation codifying the common-law view\r\n  that it is but just that the public be required to care for the prisoner, who\r\n  cannot by reason of the deprivation of his liberty, care for himself.&quot;Â  Id. at 104. (quotation marks and citations omitted). The Eighth Amendment prohibits\r\n  a &quot;deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners.&quot;Â  Id. This\r\n  deliberate indifference &quot;constitutes the 'unnecessary and wanton\r\n  infliction of pain,' proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.&quot;Â  Id.Â  (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;In order to state a cognizable\r\n  claim, a prisoner must allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence\r\n  deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.&quot;Â  Id. at 106.Â  \r\nHere, Sanders failed to make any allegations\r\n  of deliberate indifference.Â  In his complaint, Sanders\r\n  sought injunctive relief for the Department's denial of his request to visit a private\r\n  dentist.Â  However, this allegation alone fails to demonstrate acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence\r\n  deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.Â  Furthermore, Sanders is not\r\n  guaranteed the right to medical treatment of his choice.Â  See Leatherwood\r\n    v. Ozmint, No. 2:10-cv-00048-RBH, 2010 WL 4751398, at *2 (D.S.C. November 16, 2010) (&quot;The\r\n  United States Constitution requires that prisoners be provided with a certain\r\n  minimum level of medical treatment, but it does not guarantee to a prisoner the\r\n  treatment of his choice.&quot;).\r\n3. As to whether the\r\n  trial court erred in denying his motion\r\n  for a declaratory judgment: Â We find the\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Sanders's request for a\r\n  declaratory judgment. &quot;[T]he granting of a declaratory judgment [is] a\r\n  matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial court to be reasonably\r\n  exercised in furtherance of the purposes of the\r\n  statute; and the fact that other remedies are available does not preclude the\r\n  granting of a declaratory judgment, but are factors to be considered by the\r\n  court in the exercise of its discretion.&quot;Â  Bank of Augusta v. Satcher\r\n    Motor Co., 249 S.C. 53, 58, 152 S.E.2d 676,\r\n  678-79 (1967).Â  &quot;Declaratory relief will however ordinarily be\r\n  refused where a special statutory remedy\r\n  has been provided, or where another remedy will be more effective or\r\n  appropriate under the circumstances.&quot;Â  Id. at 58-59, 152 S.E.2d at 679 (quotation marks and\r\n  citation omitted). Â Â Here, the trial court properly found declaratory\r\n  judgment improper because more appropriate avenues of relief existed for\r\n  Sanders's claims.Â  For his escape charge, Sanders had access to the prison grievance\r\n  system as well as the administrative law court.Â  Additionally, Sanders had the\r\n  opportunity to seek relief in federal and state courts regarding his\r\n  constitutional claims.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons,\r\n  the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Because the statute of limitations barred any claims\r\n  under the Act, we decline to address Sanders's issues regarding the trial court's\r\n  grant of summary judgment for the gross negligence claim and the dismissal of the\r\n  private dental claim.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598&nbsp;(1999) (noting an\r\n  appellate court does not have to address issues when the disposition of a prior\r\n  issue is dispositive).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-181","title":"Marshall v.

Marshall (Husband) appeals the family court's denial of his Rule 60(b),\r\n  SCRCP, motion.Â  Husband argues the family court erred in (1) denying his motion\r\n  to set aside a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) on the ground the\r\n  judgment was satisfied and (2) failing to address the merits of his motion\r\n  because the issue warranted equitable relief.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nRule 60(b)(5), SCRCP, states: \r\n\r\n  On\r\n    motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his\r\n    legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding [if] the\r\n    judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon\r\n    which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer\r\n    equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.Â  \r\n\r\nWe hold the family court erred\r\n  in dismissing Husband's motion on the basis it was an improper procedural\r\n  vehicle to address Husband's concerns.Â  Rule 60(b)(5) expressly allows a party\r\n  to petition the court to set aside compliance with an order if a judgment has\r\n  been satisfied.Â  Here, Husband filed his Rule 60(b)(5) motion to seek relief\r\n  from enforcement of the QDRO because he alleged he previously complied with the\r\n  May 8, 2007 consent order by transferring $273,975 to Carrie C. Marshall\r\n  through an individual retirement account.Â  Therefore, an open legal question\r\n  exists as to whether Husband has fully satisfied the terms of the consent\r\n  order, an issue that is directly addressed by Rule 60(b)(5).Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  reverse the family court's ruling and remand the case to the family court for a\r\n  hearing on the merits of Husband's Rule 60(b)(5) motion.Â  Â \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J., THOMAS and KONDUROS,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-182","title":"Glenn v.

Brannon, 388 S.C. 498, 501, 697 S.E.2d 593, 595 (2010) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;To survive a motion for directed verdict, the [S]tate must\r\n  present any direct evidence or substantial circumstantial evidence\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from which the defendant's guilt can be fairly and logically\r\n  deduced.&quot;Â  State v.

Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B) (Supp. 2010).Â  The\r\n  South Carolina Code &quot;creates a permissive inference that possession of\r\n  more than one gram of crack cocaine constitutes possession with intent to\r\n  distribute.&quot;Â  State v.

Ezell, 321 S.C. 421,\r\n  424, 468 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nWe hold the State introduced\r\n  sufficient evidence to create a jury question on constructive possession.Â  The\r\n  record included evidence Jenkins had dominion and control over the crack cocaine\r\n  in question because he was driving the car in which the crack cocaine was found,\r\n  and the crack cocaine was in a sandwich bag on the driver's-side floorboard.Â  \r\nMoreover, the State provided\r\n  sufficient evidence to create a jury question of whether Jenkins knew the crack\r\n  cocaine was in the car and intended to distribute the drugs.Â  In addition to\r\n  the crack cocaine's location in the bag on the floorboard, the record\r\n  established that the amount of crack recovered was nearly seven times greater\r\n  than the minimum amount sufficient to allow the jury to infer intent to\r\n  distribute.Â  Jenkins also continued to flee the police even after an\r\n  acquaintance who was allegedly forcing Jenkins to flee jumped from the car.Â  See Ballenger, 322 S.C. at 200, 470 S.E.2d at 854 (noting that &quot;flight\r\n  .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is at least some evidence of guilt&quot; for the charge of\r\n  possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine).Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court properly denied the motions for a directed verdict.\r\nJenkins's remaining arguments\r\n  are not preserved.Â  See State v.

French, of Mount Pleasant, for Appellants.\r\n        W. Keith Martens, of Rock Hill, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: We affirm the circuit court's order\r\n  striking Appellants' answer for failure to comply with Rule 11, SCRCP, entering\r\n  default judgment against Appellants, and denying Appellants' motion to dismiss\r\n  for lack of personal jurisdiction.[1]\r\nHouston Enterprises, Inc., filed this action on\r\n  February 18, 2009, and served the summons and complaint on all Appellants by\r\n  March 3, 2009.Â  Appellants retained Joel S. Wadsworth, a lawyer who is not\r\n  licensed to practice law in South Carolina.Â  On March 27, 2009, Wadsworth requested\r\n  an extension of time for Appellants to answer the complaint, citing Appellants'\r\n  need to retain a South Carolina licensed attorney.Â  Houston's counsel consented to an extension of time through May 1, 2009.Â \r\n  On April 30, 2009, Wadsworth requested a second extension of time for\r\n  Appellants to answer.Â  At the time of the second request, Wadsworth indicated\r\n  that Appellants had retained a South Carolina licensed attorney in Horry\r\n  County, but the South Carolina attorney was affected by recent wildfires in the\r\n  area and needed another extension.Â  Houston consented\r\n  to a second extension of time through May 8, 2009.Â  \r\nOn May 7, 2009,\r\n  Wadsworth requested a third extension of time; however, Houston's counsel refused to consent to the third extension.Â  On May 8,\r\n  2009, Wadsworth filed an answer on behalf of Appellants.Â  The answer was signed\r\n  by Wadsworth, but was not signed by any attorney licensed to practice in South\r\n  Carolina.Â  On May 21, 2009, Houston's counsel notified Appellants that he\r\n  intended to move to strike the answer and affirmative defenses because the\r\n  answer was not signed by South Carolina counsel.Â  Ten days later, on June 1,\r\n  2009, counsel for Houston filed a motion to strike the answer and\r\n  for default judgment against Appellants.Â  On June 11, 2009, ten days after\r\n  Houston filed its motion to strike and more than thirty days after Appellants'\r\n  last extension of time to answer had expired, Appellants filed a motion to\r\n  dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing\r\n  on July 30, 2009, the circuit court granted Houston's motion to strike because\r\n  Appellants' answer was not signed by an attorney licensed in South Carolina and\r\n  violated Rule 11(a), SCRCP.[2]Â  Accordingly, the circuit court found\r\n  that Appellants were in default because they &quot;did not serve a proper\r\n  answer or other responsive pleading within the time required by the South Carolina\r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure,&quot; and entered a default judgment against\r\n  Appellants.Â  The circuit court also denied Appellants' motion to dismiss for\r\n  lack of personal jurisdiction because the motion was not timely filed.Â  The\r\n  circuit court later denied Appellants' motion to reconsider.Â  \r\nThe standard of review for an\r\n  appellate court reviewing an order that strikes a party's pleading is whether\r\n  the circuit court abused its discretion.Â  Robinson v. Code, 384 S.C.\r\n  582, 585, 682 S.E.2d 495, 496 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  The circuit court abuses its\r\n  discretion only when the court's conclusion is controlled by an error of law or\r\n  is without evidentiary support and results in prejudice to appellant's rights.Â  QZO, Inc. v. Moyer, 358 S.C. 246, 256, 594 S.E.2d 541, 546-47 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).\r\nI. Rule 11(a), SCRCP\r\nThe circuit court properly\r\n  struck Appellants' answer because the answer was not signed by a licensed South\r\n  Carolina attorney in violation of Rule 11(a), SCRCP, and Appellants did not promptly remedy the omission.Â  \r\nRule 11(a) provides, \r\n\r\n  Every\r\n    pleading, motion or other paper of a party represented by an attorney shall\r\n      be signed in his individual name by at least one attorney of record who is\r\n    an active member of the South Carolina BarÂ Â  Â . . . .Â  A party who is not\r\n    represented by an attorney shall sign his pleading, motion or other paper and\r\n    state his address. . . .Â  If a pleading, motion or other paper is not signed or\r\n    does not comply with this Rule, it shall be stricken unless it is signed\r\n      promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the pleader or\r\n    movant.\r\n\r\nRule 11(a), SCRCP (emphasis added).Â  \r\nAppellants' answer was signed\r\n  only by Wadsworth, who was not licensed to practice law in South Carolina.Â \r\n  Consequently, the answer violated Rule 11(a), SCRCP.Â  Houston brought this omission to Appellants' attention by\r\n  email correspondence to Wadsworth on May 21, 2009, and again by filing a motion\r\n  to strike on June 1, 2009.Â  At the time of the hearing on July 30, 2009, Appellants\r\n  had not taken any action to remedy this defect.Â  Moreover, Appellants' reasons\r\n  given for requesting extensions of time to file an answer demonstrate they were\r\n  aware of the requirement for South Carolina counsel.Â  Therefore, the circuit\r\n  judge properly struck Appellants' answer as required by Rule 11(a), SCRCP.\r\nII. Default\r\n  Judgment\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend that the circuit court erred in entering default judgment after\r\n  striking their answer, citing Rules 55(c) and 60(b), SCRCP.Â  However,\r\n  Appellants never made a motion to the circuit court under either rule.Â \r\n  Therefore, the issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Hardaway Concrete Co.\r\n    v. Hall Contracting Corp., 374 S.C. 216, 224, 647 S.E.2d 488, 492 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007) (noting an issue must be raised to and ruled on by the trial court in\r\n  order to be preserved for appellate review). Â Â \r\nAppellants also\r\n  contend the circuit court erred in not granting their motion to dismiss for\r\n  lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  Rule 12(b), SCRCP, requires such a defense to be\r\n  asserted in the responsive pleading or by motion &quot;before pleading if a\r\n  further pleading is permitted.&quot;Â  Appellants did not file their motion to\r\n  dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction until June 11, 2009, ten days after\r\n  Houston filed its motion to strike and more than thirty days after Appellants'\r\n  last extension of time to answer had expired.Â  Therefore, the circuit court\r\n  properly held that the motion to dismiss was untimely and refused to consider\r\n  it.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The circuit court noted that &quot;the second extension was technically not\r\n  permitted by the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.&quot;Â  See Rules 12 and 6(b), SCRCP.Â  However, he accepted\r\n  the answer in terms of timeliness stating, &quot;the court will accept that May\r\n  8, 2009 was the extended deadline for the defendants to answer or otherwise\r\n  plead in response to Houston's complaint.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-185","title":"State v.

(Father) appeals from the family court's final order terminating his\r\n  parental rights to his two minor children (Children).Â  Father argues the family\r\n  court erred in (1) denying his motion for involuntary dismissal and (2)\r\n  terminating his parental rights.Â  We\r\n  affirm. \r\nI.Â  Motion\r\n  for involuntary dismissal\r\nThis issue is not preserved\r\n  for appellate review.Â  After Father moved for involuntary dismissal at the\r\n  close of the Department of Social Services' (DSS) case, he presented testimony\r\n  from six witnesses but did not renew his motion for involuntary dismissal at\r\n  the close of his case.Â  See Wallace v. Milliken &amp; Co., 300\r\n  S.C. 553, 559, 389 S.E.2d 448, 451 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding an appellant waives\r\n  the right to question on appeal the trial court's denial of Rule 41, SCRCP,\r\n  motion when the appellant presents evidence after the initial denial of the\r\n  motion and fails to renew the motion at the close of the case).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII. Termination\r\n  of parental rights (TPR)Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe grounds for TPR must be\r\n  proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;Upon\r\n  review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the record as to whether\r\n  clear and convincing evidence supports the termination [of parental\r\n  rights].&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 609,\r\n  582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â  However, despite our broad scope of review, we are\r\n  not required to disregard the findings of &quot;the family court, who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses, [and] was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The family court may order TPR upon\r\n  finding one or more of eleven statutory grounds is satisfied and also finding\r\n  TPR is in the best interest of the child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (2010).Â  \r\nSection 63-7-2570(7) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2010) states a statutory ground for TPR is met when\r\n  &quot;[t]he child has been abandoned as defined in section 63-7-20.&quot;Â \r\n  Section 63-7-20(1) of the South Carolina Code (2010) states abandonment of a\r\n  child occurs when:\r\n[A]\r\n  parent or guardian wil[l]fully deserts a child or wil[l]fully surrenders\r\n  physical possession of a child without making adequate arrangements for the\r\n  child's needs or the continuing care of the child.\r\nFather argues he did not\r\n  abandon Children because he presented evidence proving he continually provided\r\n  for Children's care before and after he was imprisoned.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;Conduct of the\r\n  parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties may fairly be\r\n  characterized as 'willful' because it manifests a conscious indifference to the\r\n  rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1992).Â \r\n  The determination of whether a parent acts willfully &quot;within the meaning\r\n  of the statute is a question of intent to be determined in each case from all\r\n  the facts and circumstances.&quot;Â  Id. at 47, 413 S.E.2d at 838.Â \r\n  Additionally, in order to ascertain whether a parent evinces a settled purpose\r\n  to forego parental duties requires &quot;consideration of all of the\r\n  surrounding circumstances reflected in the record, including the nature of the\r\n  parent-child relationship during times when the father was not incarcerated.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 337, 543 S.E.2d 580,\r\n  583 (Ct. App. 2001).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn the facts presented\r\n  by this case, we find clear and convincing evidence supports the family court's\r\n  finding that Father abandoned Children.[1]Â \r\n  Here, in reviewing the surrounding circumstances reflected in the record on\r\n  appeal, Father evinced a settled purpose to forgo his parental duties before\r\n  and after he was imprisoned.Â  DSS presented multiple witnesses who testified\r\n  Father failed to consistently support or visit Children during the intervening\r\n  period when he was not incarcerated, and the family court made extensive\r\n  factual and credibility findings in favor of these witnesses' testimony in its\r\n  final order.Â  Additionally, after Father was imprisoned, he delayed in taking\r\n  any affirmative steps to set up visitation with Children for more than a year.Â \r\n  Furthermore, Father demonstrated a deliberate and willful indifference to caring\r\n  for Children through his decision to continue to engage in criminal activity during\r\n  his intervening period of freedom.Â  See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Truitt, 361 S.C. 272, 603 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding the statutory\r\n  ground of abandonment was satisfied because of &quot;the parent's voluntary\r\n  pursuit of a course of lawlessness&quot; that resulted in imprisonment and the\r\n  parent's &quot;flagrant indifference towards the children during intervening\r\n  periods of freedom.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the family court correctly found\r\n  sufficient statutory grounds for TPR.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIn a TPR case, the best\r\n  interests of the child are the paramount consideration.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\n  &quot;The interests of the child shall prevail if the\r\n  child's interest and the parental rights conflict.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 63-7-2620 (2010).Â  \r\nWe find clear and convincing\r\n  evidence in the record supports the family court's finding that termination of Father's\r\n  parental rights was in Children's best interests.[2] Father will not be able to adequately support or\r\n  otherwise provide for Children's continued care until 2024, when his max-out\r\n  date for imprisonment occurs.Â  Even assuming Father is released from prison\r\n  early, Father has displayed a history of abusing drugs and unstable housing,\r\n  which indicates he would not be able to raise Children in a safe environment.Â \r\n  Lastly, Children's current foster care family expressed interest in\r\n  adopting Children and terminating Father's parental rights would give Children\r\n  permanence by allowing the adoption process to proceed.Â  Â Â See Doe v.\r\n    Roe, 386 S.C. 624, 634, 690 S.E.2d 573, 579 (2010) (quoting S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 63-7-2510 (2010)) (&quot;Overturning the family court's decision to terminate\r\n  [parent's] rights clearly conflicts with the TPR statute's purpose to make a\r\n  child eligible for adoption by someone 'who will provide a suitable home\r\n  environment and the love and care necessary for a happy, healthful, and\r\n  productive life.'&quot;).Â  Accordingly, the family court correctly determined\r\n  TPR was in Children's best interests.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS and\r\n  KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because we find Father abandoned Children, we need\r\n  not address the remaining statutory grounds for TPR.Â  See Stinecipher\r\n    v. Ballington, 366 S.C. 92, 100 n.6, 620 S.E.2d 93, 98 n.6 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (stating once one statutory ground is met, this court need not address whether\r\n  any other ground for TPR has been proved).Â  Additionally, we note while DSS did\r\n  not allege the statutory grounds of either failure to support or failure to\r\n  visit in its TPR complaint against Father, both grounds would have been equally\r\n  applicable to the case at bar.Â Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  Although the guardian ad\r\n  litem (GAL) recommended TPR, we decline to rely on the GAL's testimony in this\r\n  case.Â  A review of the GAL's report and the testimony of the GAL at the\r\n  TPR hearing indicates the GAL declined to interview Father.Â  We note while\r\n  Father was imprisoned, he remained one of the principal parties involved in\r\n  this case and the GAL is authorized by statute to &quot;conduct an independent\r\n  assessment of the facts&quot; and &quot;interview persons involved in the\r\n  case&quot; on behalf of the family court.Â  S.C.
