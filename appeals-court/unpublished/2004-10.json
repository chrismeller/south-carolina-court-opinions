Hayes, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 20040UP-498\r\nSubmitted September 19, 2004 â€“ Filed \r\n  October 5, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDaniel D. Dâ€™Agostino, of York, for Appellant. \r\nFrank L. Valenta, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Department of Public Safety suspended Raymond G. Gelinasâ€™ \r\n  driverâ€™s license after he refused to take an alcohol breath test.Â  The circuit \r\n  court affirmed the Departmentâ€™s administrative hearing officerâ€™s decision sustaining \r\n  the suspension.Â  Gelinas appeals and we affirm. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOfficer Gilstrap arrested \r\n  Gelinas for DUI during a traffic stop after he smelled the odor of alcohol on \r\n  him and Gelinas failed a sobriety test.Â  At the law enforcement center, Officer \r\n  Gilstrap advised Gelinas of his implied consent rights and requested he take \r\n  the Datamaster test. Â The officer began setting up the Datamaster when \r\n  Gelinas told the officer he was not going to take the test.Â  The test was never \r\n  administered. [2]  Â Because of Gelinasâ€™ refusal and pursuant \r\n  to applicable law, Officer Gilstrap issued a Notice of Suspension suspending \r\n  Gelinasâ€™ driving privileges.Â  \r\nOn appeal to the circuit court, \r\n  Gelinas argued the implied consent law permits only a qualified Datamaster operator \r\n  to offer an alcohol breath test. Â He claimed that because Officer Gilstrap \r\n  was the arresting officer, he could not be qualified as the Datamaster operator \r\n  until after he videotaped Gelinasâ€™ conduct pursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. \r\n  sections 56-5-2950(a) and 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d) (Supp. 2003).Â  All parties agreed \r\n  no videotaping occurred. Â Gelinas therefore contended the officer could \r\n  not offer him a valid test to refuse, thus invalidating his suspension.Â  \r\nThe circuit court disagreed and \r\n  upheld Gelinasâ€™ suspension finding â€œthe arresting officer, if certified, is \r\n  qualified to administer all pre-test processes and procedures including accepting \r\n  a refusal, right from the start.â€ Â Moreover, the court concluded the question \r\n  of whether Gelinas was offered a valid test was irrelevant because the precautionary \r\n  rules governing test procedures are inapplicable if the test is refused.Â  To \r\n  support its conclusion, the court relied on State v. Jansen, 305 S.C. \r\n  320, 408 S.E.2d 235 (1991), wherein our supreme court held the validity of test \r\n  methods will not be considered when no test is administered and no test results \r\n  are offered into evidence. Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appeal from a decision of \r\n  the department of public safety is governed by the Administrative Procedures \r\n  Act.Â  Byerly Hosp. v. South Carolina State Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. \r\n  Commâ€™n, 319 S.C. 225, 229, 460 S.E.2d 383, 385 (1995).Â  Therefore, when \r\n  reviewing a final decision of the department, the circuit court, sitting as \r\n  an appellate court, may not substitute its judgment for that of the department \r\n  as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  The departmentâ€™s decision will be affirmed unless it is controlled \r\n  by an error of law or is without evidentiary support.Â  Mictronics, Inc. v. \r\n  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 510, 548 S.E.2d 223, 225 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nGelinas contends the circuit \r\n  court erred in determining he was offered a valid test because the Datamaster \r\n  operator, who was also the arresting officer, did not observe or videotape him \r\n  during a twenty-minute pre-test waiting period before offering the test.Â  He \r\n  therefore claims his refusal was void for lack of a valid test offer requiring \r\n  the circuit court to reverse his suspension and reinstate his driving privileges.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. section \r\n  56-5-2950(a) (Supp. 2003) states â€œ[t]he arresting officer may administer \r\n  the tests if the [arrested] personâ€™s conduct during the twenty-minute pre-test \r\n  waiting period is videotaped pursuant to Section 56-2-2953(A)(2)(d).â€Â  (Emphasis \r\n  added.)Â  Section 56-2-2953(A)(2)(d) also states â€œif the arresting officer \r\n  administers the breath test, the personâ€™s conduct during the twenty-minute \r\n  pre-test waiting period must be videotaped.â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  \r\nThe statutes require an arresting \r\n  officer to videotape a personâ€™s conduct if he administers the Datamaster test, \r\n  not offers it.Â  Therefore, Officer Gilstrap did not have to videotape Gelinas \r\n  or observe the twenty-minute waiting period prior to offering the test and accepting \r\n  the refusal.Â  Moreover, the purpose of the videotaping is â€œto insure that the \r\n  results of the breathalyzer test if given are accurate and reliable as evidence \r\n  at trial.â€Â  State v. Jansen, 305 S.C. 320, 322, 408 S.E.2d 235, 237 (1991).Â  \r\n  Because Gelinasâ€™ suspension did not depend on the reliability of the test results, \r\n  he may not challenge Officer Gilstrapâ€™s pre-test qualifications or methods.Â  \r\n  See Jansen, 305 S.C. at 322-23, 408 S.E.2d at 237 (holding testing \r\n  precautions â€œdo not apply to the offer and refusal of a breathalyzer testâ€ and \r\n  a defendant may not question the validity of test methods when â€œno test was \r\n  given, and there were no results offered as evidence by the Stateâ€); see \r\n  also Ex parte Horne, 303 S.C. 30, 32, 397 S.E.2d 788, 789 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1990) (â€œThe question of the validity of test methods employed by a breath \r\n  test operator does not arise until a test is given and its results are offered \r\n  as evidence.â€). Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n STILWELL, BEATTY, \r\n  and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  At the hearing before the circuit court, Gelinasâ€™ counsel \r\n    stated Officer Gilstrap entered the time, date â€œand everything elseâ€ into \r\n    the Datamaster before Gelinas refused to take the test.Â  Counsel therefore \r\n    argued testing had already begun and was terminated on Gelinasâ€™ refusal.Â  \r\n    However, we find Officer Gilstrap was merely preparing the Datamaster for \r\n    an anticipated breath test that never occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-499","title":"State v.

Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, \r\n  Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Ralph E. Hoisington, of Charleston, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tyrese R. Chisolm appeals his \r\n  second-degree burglary conviction, arguing the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to allow rehabilitative evidence of his alibi witnessâ€™ truthful character.Â  \r\n  We reverse and remand for a new trial. \r\n  [1]   \r\nFACTS\r\nDoug Sweeney and his friend, Jackson Goss, stopped \r\n  by Sweeneyâ€™s apartment building and were almost to the front door when a man \r\n  they did not recognize came out of the doorway with a green bicycle.Â  The men \r\n  exchanged hellos and Sweeney and Goss went inside.Â  When Sweeney thought to \r\n  himself that the man did not look like someone who would be visiting his downstairs \r\n  neighbors, he asked his roommate whether the neighbors had a green bicycle.Â  \r\n  She said they did and told him one of her own bicycles had been stolen only \r\n  two hours earlier.Â  Sweeney called 911 and with Gossâ€™ help, provided a description \r\n  of the man.Â  \r\nSarah Samuel, Sweeneyâ€™s neighbor, testified \r\n  her green bicycle was taken from the apartment building.Â  She had left the bicycle \r\n  under a stairwell inside the building.Â  When she returned, the police were there \r\n  and she learned of the theft. Â \r\nAn officer patrolling the area where \r\n  the burglary occurred noticed Chisolm, who matched the burglarâ€™s description \r\n  and was on a green bicycle.Â  Chisolm attempted to escape when the officer asked \r\n  him to stop, eventually leaving the bicycle and fleeing on foot.Â  However, the \r\n  officer caught up with him. Â Chisolm was taken into custody at approximately \r\n  4:15, about an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes after Sweeney and Goss first \r\n  saw the burglar.Â  \r\nChisolm presented an alibi defense.Â  \r\n  He testified he was at the Steinberg Law Firm at the time of the crime, waiting \r\n  to see Steven Goldberg regarding a workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  He claimed \r\n  that after he left the office, he purchased the bicycle and a cell phone from \r\n  a man fitting the burglarâ€™s description.Â  \r\nCritical to Chisolmâ€™s defense was the \r\n  testimony of Walter Bilbro, an attorney who had associated members of the Steinberg \r\n  firm on Chisolmâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation case.Â  Bilbro testified he had reminded \r\n  Chisolm of his 1:00 p.m. appointment with Goldberg and that at approximately \r\n  3:50 p.m. Chisolm called him from the firm to tell him he had been waiting for \r\n  Goldberg but Goldberg failed to meet him.Â  Bilbro testified Chisolm put a receptionist \r\n  on the phone at Bilbroâ€™s request and she confirmed that Chisolm had been waiting \r\n  and that Goldberg was not in the office.Â  Other witnesses placed Chisolm \r\n  at the firm that afternoon, and testified he waited a considerable time for \r\n  Goldberg, but they were not able to confirm precisely when Chisolm was there.Â  \r\n\r\nDuring Bilbroâ€™s direct testimony, he \r\n  admitted the Supreme Court had publicly reprimanded him.Â  During the Stateâ€™s \r\n  cross-examination, Bilbro revealed he was reprimanded for violating the rule \r\n  requiring attorneys to refrain from conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, \r\n  or misrepresentation and for violating the rule that prohibits an attorney from \r\n  engaging in conduct tending to bring the legal profession into disrepute.Â  In \r\n  response, the defense asked to submit the testimony of another attorney in the \r\n  community who would speak positively regarding Bilbroâ€™s reputation for honesty.Â  \r\n  The court refused to admit the testimony, citing the possibility of several \r\n  witnesses for each side on the issue.Â  The court reasoned the dueling testimony \r\n  could distract everyone from the â€œtrue purposeâ€ of the trialâ€”Chisolmâ€™s â€œguilt \r\n  or innocence.â€Â  The prosecution and defense stipulated that if allowed, \r\n  the defense would have called attorney Stephen Booker, who would have testified \r\n  he had dealt with Bilbro on many cases, working both with him and against him; \r\n  that he knew his reputation for truthfulness in the community; and that his \r\n  reputation in the legal community is that he is truthful.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe admission of evidence is within the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s sound discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent an \r\n  abuse of that discretion.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, \r\n  325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).Â  Evidence of a witnessâ€™ truthful character \r\n  is only admissible after the witnessâ€™ character for truthfulness â€œhas been attacked \r\n  by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.â€Â  Rule 608(a)(2), SCRE.Â  â€œImpeachment \r\n  is not a dispassionate study of the witnessâ€™s capacities and character, but \r\n  rather is regarded in our tradition as an attack upon his credibility.Â  \r\n  Under our adversary system of trials, the witnessâ€™s proponent must be given \r\n  an opportunity to meet this attack by evidence rehabilitating the witness.â€Â  \r\n  1&nbsp;McCormick on Evidence Â§ 47 (5th ed. 1999).\r\nHere, the State attacked Bilbroâ€™s character for \r\n  truthfulness by inquiring about the details of his public reprimand.Â  The Stateâ€™s \r\n  examination revealed Bilbro had been reprimanded for violating Rule 407, which \r\n  prohibits attorneys from engaging in â€œdishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.â€Â  \r\n  The prosecutor had Bilbro read the rule into the record.Â  The Stateâ€™s cross-examination \r\n  clearly was intended to damage Bilbroâ€™s credibility as a truthful witness.Â  \r\n  Evidence of his truthful character, such as Bookerâ€™s testimony, was thereby \r\n  rendered admissible under Rule 608(a)(2).Â  The trial courtâ€™s refusal to admit \r\n  the proffered evidence was thus governed by an error of law.Â  Further, because \r\n  Bilbroâ€™s testimony was central to Chisolmâ€™s defense, the exclusion of evidence \r\n  of his truthful reputation cannot be considered harmless.Â  See State \r\n  v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 27, 393 S.E.2d 364, 369 (1990) (holding exclusion \r\n  of evidence is reversible only where error and prejudice are shown); State \r\n  v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (holding whether \r\n  an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the case, but it is harmless \r\n  where it could not reasonably have changed the outcome of the trial).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  This appeal was originally submitted pursuant to Anders \r\n    v.

Lanier, of Orangeburg, for Appellant.\r\nMark B. Tinsley, of Allendale and Robert N. Hill, of Newberry, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Sylvia Dunbar brought this \r\n  action as Guardian ad Litem for Akeya Johnson, a minor under the age of eighteen, \r\n  to recover damages as a result of an automobile accident in which Akeya Johnson \r\n  was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Willette L. Johnson.Â  The jury returned \r\n  a verdict in favor of Akeya in the amount of $62,000 and a judgment was entered \r\n  in this amount.Â  Willette Johnson appeals, claiming the trial court erred in \r\n  denying her motion for a new trial because the verdict was excessive and the \r\n  trial court failed to issue a jury charge on sudden emergency.Â  She also argues \r\n  a new trial should have been granted because the circuit court improperly admitted \r\n  some testimony from the investigating officer while improperly excluding other \r\n  testimony. We affirm.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nBecause Appellant failed to address \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s initial ground for denying her post-trial motion, we need \r\n  not address the issues raised on appeal.Â  We affirm the circuit courtâ€™s denial \r\n  based solely on the fact that Appellantâ€™s motion for a new trial was untimely \r\n  filed.\r\nRule 59(b), SCRCP, states â€œ[t]he motion \r\n  for a new trial shall be made promptly after the jury is discharged, or in the \r\n  discretion of the court not later than 10 days thereafter.â€Â  Following discharge \r\n  of the jury, the trial court granted Appellant the maximum ten days to file \r\n  her post-trial motions.Â  Documents received by this court from the Allendale \r\n  County courthouse reveal that Appellantâ€™s motion was filed beyond the ten-day \r\n  period.\r\nInitially, the trial court found Appellant \r\n  improperly made her motion pursuant to a repealed statute.Â  The court expanded \r\n  on this ground for denial as follows:\r\n\r\nThis fact alone provides a sufficient basis for the denial \r\n  of Defendantâ€™s motion.Â  Nonetheless, the motion also would be denied if it had \r\n  been made pursuant to Rule 59(a), SCRCP. [the current rule for post-trial motions]\r\n\r\nIn a footnote to the above quotation, the court \r\n  continued:\r\n\r\nThe Court notes that the time limit for filing a Rule 59(a) \r\n  motion has expired, but because its ruling would be the same if the proper motion \r\n  had been timely filed, it discusses the validity of the request for a new trial.\r\n\r\nThe trial court went on to discuss the merits of \r\n  Appellantâ€™s motion for a new trial based on the issues now raised on appeal.Â  \r\n  The motion was ultimately denied.\r\nAppellant \r\n  argues several errors in the trial courtâ€™s order, but does not raise an exception \r\n  to the trial courtâ€™s denial of the motion on the basis of timeliness.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision based solely on the untimeliness of Appellantâ€™s \r\n  motion for a new trial.Â Â Â  See Dwyer v. Jenkins, 289 S.C. 118, \r\n  120-121, 344 S.E.2d 886, 888 (Ct. App. 1986) (affirming the circuit court when \r\n  unchallenged alternative findings support the judgment); 5 Am.

Outten and Laurel R.S. Blair, both of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is a slip and fall case.Â  \r\n  Nancy Browning appeals from the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment \r\n  to Bi-Lo, Inc.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 21, 1998, Browning slipped and fell on \r\n  a substance in a Bi-Lo grocery store.Â  As a result of the fall, Browning sustained \r\n  an injury to her right shoulder.Â  She subsequently filed suit against Bi-Lo.Â  \r\n  Bi-Lo answered, denying liability and averring that Browning was comparatively \r\n  negligent.Â  Bi-Lo then moved for summary judgment, which the circuit judge granted.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, \r\n  the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant \r\n  to Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 \r\n  (2002).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material \r\n  fact such that the moving party must prevail as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997).\r\nLAW\r\nI.\r\nBrowning argues the \r\n  circuit judge erred in granting Bi-Loâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo recover damages for \r\n  injuries caused by a dangerous or defective condition on a storekeeperâ€™s premises, \r\n  the plaintiff must show either (1) that the injury was caused by a specific \r\n  act of the defendant which created the dangerous condition; or (2) that the \r\n  defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition and \r\n  failed to remedy it.Â  Wintersteen v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, 542 \r\n  S.E.2d 728 (2001).Â  In the case of a foreign substance, the plaintiff must demonstrate \r\n  either that the substance was placed there by the defendant or its agents, or \r\n  that the defendant had actual or constructive notice the substance was on the \r\n  floor at the time of the slip and fall.Â  Id. at 35, 542 S.E.2d at 729-30.Â  \r\n  The mere fact the substance was on the floor is insufficient standing alone \r\n  to charge the storekeeper with negligence.Â  Calvert v. House Beautiful Paint \r\n  &amp; Decorating Ctr., Inc., 313 S.C. 494, 443 S.E.2d 398 (1994).\r\nHere, the record reveals no evidence \r\n  that Bi-Lo either placed the foreign substance on the floor or had actual or \r\n  constructive notice that the substance was on the floor before Browningâ€™s fall.Â  \r\n  In her deposition, Browning testified that she did not see the alleged foreign \r\n  substance before she fell because she was not looking at the floor and she had \r\n  no idea who placed the substance on the floor.Â  When asked what evidence she \r\n  had that Bi-Lo was on notice of the substance on the floor prior to her fall, \r\n  Browning stated there was a video camera operating â€œ[r]ight aboveâ€ the place \r\n  where she fell.Â  Browning asserts Bi-Lo had constructive notice by virtue of \r\n  a camera directed at the location where the fall occurred and the presence of \r\n  a monitor fed by the camera in an area allegedly observable by Bi-Lo employees \r\n  at the time of the fall.Â  There is no evidence the mere presence of a camera \r\n  constituted constructive notice to Bi-Lo.Â  Additionally, the presence or absence \r\n  of an incident report completed after Browningâ€™s fall has no bearing on Bi-Loâ€™s \r\n  notice of the foreign substance before the fall.\r\nBecause Browning failed to meet \r\n  her burden as to the two Wintersteen elements, we find the trial court \r\n  did not err in granting summary judgment to Bi-Lo.Â  It is clear that Browning \r\n  has failed to present any evidence establishing a genuine issue of fact for \r\n  trial.\r\nII.\r\nBrowning contends that \r\n  her attorney â€œdid not represent same in as much as he did not disagree with \r\n  counsel for Bi-Lo.â€Â  She further maintains that Bi-Loâ€™s attorney â€œ[m]ade inaccurate \r\n  statements toâ€ the judge when the attorney â€œstated that there was no incident \r\n  report filed.â€\r\nThese issues on appeal \r\n  were abandoned due to their conclusory nature and lack of supporting authority.Â  \r\n  See Glasscock, Inc. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., \r\n  348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œSouth Carolina law clearly \r\n  states that short, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are \r\n  deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for review.â€).Â  Moreover, \r\n  because these issues were not raised to and ruled upon by the circuit judge, \r\n  they are not preserved for our review.Â  See Widman v. Widman, \r\n  348 S.C. 97, 557 S.E.2d 693 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding issue cannot be raised \r\n  for first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial \r\n  judge to be preserved for appellate review).\r\nIII.\r\nBrowningâ€™s â€œStatement of Issues \r\n  on Appealâ€ includes the bare assertion that â€œMs. Jennifer Eubanks fell on a \r\n  green substance in the store approximately thirty minutes before Plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  accident.â€Â  This conclusory statement is insufficient to preserve this issue \r\n  for appellate review.Â  See Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 312 \r\n  S.C. 102, 439 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding an issue is deemed abandoned \r\n  and thus not presented for appellate review if argued in a short, conclusory \r\n  statement).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, \r\n  based on the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit judge is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and WILLIAMS, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-505","title":"Calhoun v.

Childs, \r\n  all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Dr. Edna L. Calhoun appeals \r\n  the order of the circuit court affirming the decision of the Marlboro County \r\n  School District Board (Board) not to renew her teaching contract.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nCalhoun taught in various Marlboro County schools \r\n  for nearly fifty years.Â  Her most recent tenure was as a social studies teacher \r\n  at Marlboro County High School (MCHS), which was located in the Marlboro County \r\n  School District (District).\r\nRocky E. Peterkin became principal of \r\n  MCHS in 1999.Â  During the course of the 1999-2000 school year, he observed the \r\n  teaching performance of the MCHS faculty members.Â  While observing Calhounâ€™s \r\n  teaching performance in the Fall of 1999, Peterkin developed â€œsignificant concernsâ€ \r\n  about the quality of Calhounâ€™s teaching performance, including â€œthe method by \r\n  which [her] lesson plans were planned and implemented â€¦ how objectives did not \r\n  always mesh with the lessons being taught, and â€¦ about the lack of a verified \r\n  teacherâ€™s strategies (sic) to meet the needs of all students.â€ \r\nConsequently, he met with Calhoun in December 1999 \r\n  to advise her of his concerns and make her aware that in the spring 2000 semester \r\n  he intended to â€œput her on a professional development plan with [the] full intent \r\n  that the plan support and strengthen her abilities to teach.â€Â  Peterkin wrote \r\n  Calhoun in January 2000 to reiterate that a â€œprofessional development planâ€ \r\n  would be devised for her â€œimplementation during the second semester of the 1999-2000 \r\n  school yearâ€ and that â€œthe purpose of this plan is to provide additional administrative \r\n  support for [her] classroom instruction.â€Â  \r\nThe three-page development plan provided focus \r\n  on the dual goals of improving Calhounâ€™s â€œInstruction Presentationâ€ and â€œFacilitating \r\n  Instructionâ€ skills.Â  Within each goal, the plan included specific objectives \r\n  and activities designed to achieve the objectives.Â  Descriptions of appropriate \r\n  evidence that Calhoun had completed the activities were provided, as well as \r\n  descriptions of relevant resources available to help Calhoun complete the activities, \r\n  and â€œcompletion datesâ€ for each activity.Â  Additionally, Calhoun was assigned \r\n  to participate in â€œCooperative Learning Sessionsâ€ to help improve her teaching \r\n  skills. \r\nThroughout the spring 2000 semester, a team of \r\n  District and MCHS administrators observed Calhounâ€™s teaching performance and \r\n  efforts to comply with the development plan.Â  Based on those observations, Peterkin \r\n  determined Calhoun had not satisfactorily improved her teaching performance, \r\n  and notified District superintendent Dr. Ray Brayboy of his concerns.Â Â  \r\nIn an April 3, 2000 letter, Brayboy informed Calhoun \r\n  that Peterkin and she were to meet and develop an improvement plan for Calhoun \r\n  to pursue in the 2000-2001 school year.Â  Brayboy further informed Calhoun that \r\n  Peterkin would â€œalso be monitoring and evaluating [her] performance to see that \r\n  the necessary improvements are made.â€Â  He added, â€œYour failure to address these \r\n  concerns could place your continued employment with this District in jeopardy.â€ \r\n\r\nPeterkin met with Calhoun on April 6, 2000, after which \r\n  he summarized their meeting in a written letter to Calhoun.Â  In the letter, \r\n  Peterkin wrote:\r\n\r\nThis letter is a follow-up to our conference on April 6, \r\n  2000, in which I shared with you my serious concerns with your overall teaching \r\n  performance.Â  In particular, we discussed my continued reservations regarding \r\n  your long- and short-range planning, delivery of instruction in accordance with \r\n  District expectations, treatment of and communications with students, classroom \r\n  environment, and classroom management skills.\r\n\r\nPeterkin added that, based on observations of Calhounâ€™s \r\n  teaching performance, he saw a â€œcontinued need for improvement,â€ and that she \r\n  â€œwould be provided with an Improvement Plan to assistâ€ her.Â  He added that â€œ[s]hould \r\n  [she] fail in the upcoming year to complete successfully the S.T.E.P. process \r\n  [1]  or to demonstrate significant improvement in [her] teaching performance, \r\n  [her] continued employment with this District may be in jeopardy.â€ \r\nPeterkin later provided Calhoun with a detailed \r\n  improvement plan for the 2000-2001 school year, which was designed to strengthen \r\n  identified teaching deficiencies.Â  In a May 25, 2000 letter from Peterkin to \r\n  Calhoun, he noted that she was given the plan because of â€œconcerns about [her] \r\n  overall teaching performance in the areas of accommodating the needs of special \r\n  education students enrolled in [her] classes, delivery of instruction, time \r\n  on task by [her] students, and classroom management.â€Â  Peterkin sought to meet \r\n  with Calhoun to discuss the plan and â€œany revisionsâ€ she wanted to make to the \r\n  plan.Â  He reiterated his earlier warning that â€œif significant improvement in \r\n  your job performance is not noted, your continued employment with this District \r\n  will be in jeopardy.â€\r\nDuring the 2000-2001 school year, Calhounâ€™s teaching \r\n  performance was evaluated under the S.T.E.P. plan by Peterkin and Assistant \r\n  Principal Sequal Black.Â  Among other things, they observed that Calhoun was \r\n  not following lesson plans, students were allowed to copy answers from their \r\n  textbooks during tests, and that students were permitted to chose whether to \r\n  even take social studies tests.Â  Of particular concern to Black were observations \r\n  that the needs of special education students were not being met as required \r\n  by federal law.Â  Calhounâ€™s preliminary S.T.E.P. evaluation results for the 2000-2001 \r\n  school year were â€œunsatisfactoryâ€ with nine subsections rated â€œprofessionalâ€ \r\n  and six rated as â€œneeds improvement.â€Â  Peterkin provided a formal, written remediation \r\n  plan to address Calhounâ€™s teaching areas deemed unsatisfactory.Â  The plan included \r\n  suggested professional readings, staff development training, and other specific \r\n  ideas for improvement.\r\nIn spite of Calhounâ€™s â€œunsatisfactoryâ€ results \r\n  on the S.T.E.P. evaluations, Peterkin recommended to Superintendent Brayboy \r\n  that for the 2001-2002 school year Calhoun receive a third opportunity to improve \r\n  her â€œoverall teaching performance.â€Â  Peterkin recommended continued assistance \r\n  and a second formal S.T.E.P. evaluation for the 2001-2002 school year.Â  \r\nBrayboy accepted Peterkinâ€™s recommendations.Â  He \r\n  advised Calhoun by letter dated April 5, 2001 that the District would renew \r\n  her contract for the 2001-2002 school year, but that ongoing, serious concerns \r\n  about her teaching performance motivated the District to continue formal evaluation \r\n  of her teaching performance during the year.Â  He again noted that the District \r\n  expected â€œsignificant and consistent progress in improving [her] overall teaching \r\n  performance,â€ and that failure to do so satisfactorily would put her â€œcontinued \r\n  employment with the District in jeopardy.â€\r\nFor the 2001-2002 school year, Calhounâ€™s S.T.E.P. \r\n  evaluation team consisted of District administrators Mildred Baker and Herbert \r\n  Gould, a former MCHS principal.Â  Throughout the year, Calhoun was observed and \r\n  provided written and oral assistance.Â  However, in the December 2001 initial \r\n  review of her S.T.E.P. evaluation, she again received an unsatisfactory evaluation \r\n  of her performance including â€œprofessionalâ€ ratings on ten S.T.E.P. subsections \r\n  and â€œneeds improvementâ€ ratings on five subsections.Â  \r\nConsequently, Baker, Gould, and Peterkin met with \r\n  Calhoun for approximately three hours in December 2001 to review her results \r\n  and provide Calhoun a written remediation plan with specific objectives, strategies, \r\n  and deadlines.Â  The District gave Calhoun a â€œresource notebookâ€ with materials \r\n  â€œprepared to help her with her classroom teaching.â€Â  However, Calhoun returned \r\n  the binder to Bakerâ€™s office, stating she was not going to read the â€œstuffâ€ \r\n  in the binder.Â  In a written letter from Baker to Calhoun on February 4, 2002, \r\n  Baker expressed her disappointment in Calhounâ€™s disregard of the resource notebook, \r\n  and detailed examples of Calhounâ€™s noncompliance with several requirements of \r\n  the remediation plan.Â  Ultimately, Calhoun failed to complete the majority of \r\n  the remediation plan recommendations. \r\nOn March 8, 2002, Gould and Baker again \r\n  met with Calhoun to review their final 2001-2002 S.T.E.P. evaluation results.Â  \r\n  Calhoun received an overall rating of â€œunsatisfactoryâ€ with six subsections \r\n  rated â€œprofessionalâ€ and nine subsections rated â€œneeds improvement.â€Â  During \r\n  the conference, Gould reviewed each category of evaluation.Â  They asked Calhoun \r\n  if there was anything she wanted Baker or him to address, and whether they could \r\n  do anything further to assist her.Â  She responded that she thought she was doing \r\n  what was expected of her.\r\nBased on Calhounâ€™s two final â€œunsatisfactoryâ€ \r\n  S.T.E.P. evaluations andÂ  his personal evaluation of Calhoun, Peterkin recommended \r\n  to Superintendent Brayboy that Calhoun not be given a teaching employment contract \r\n  for the 2002-2003 school year.Â  Brayboy agreed, and notified Calhoun in an April \r\n  1, 2000 letter that he had recommended to the Board that her contract not be \r\n  renewed.\r\nIn response to Brayboyâ€™s recommendation, \r\n  the Board conducted a review and held a hearing to review whether Calhounâ€™s \r\n  contract should be renewed.Â  At the hearing, all parties were represented by \r\n  counsel.\r\nPeterkin, Gould, Baker, and Black each detailed \r\n  numerous examples of how over a two-and-a-half year period Calhoun received \r\n  repeated written notices concerning alleged deficiencies about her teaching \r\n  performance.Â  This testimony further indicated the following: (1) Calhoun was \r\n  given remedial programs that she largely ignored or failed to complete; and \r\n  (2) Calhoun was subject to comprehensive informal and formal evaluations that \r\n  consistently indicated her teaching performance was generally unsatisfactory \r\n  with little signs of improving.Â  \r\nDuring the hearing, Calhoun testified \r\n  that prior to Peterkinâ€™s initial expression of concern about her teaching performance \r\n  in the fall of 1999, at least one other principal had expressed â€œmajor concernsâ€ \r\n  about her teaching.Â  When asked if she had communication problems with Peterkin, \r\n  she only replied, â€œWell, heâ€™s a friendly person, but he seems to be busy.â€Â  \r\n  When asked, â€œisnâ€™t it true that over the past two-and-a-half years Mr. Peterkin \r\n  and others have provided you with either remediation plans or improvement plans \r\n  designed to help you improve your teaching,â€ Calhoun responded â€œYes. But the \r\n  suggestions that they were making that I should attend to, I felt I was doing \r\n  that thoroughly.â€Â  The thrust of the evidence offered by Calhoun was that she \r\n  was properly responding to the remediation efforts.\r\nThe Board decided not to renew Calhounâ€™s \r\n  teaching contract for the 2002-2003 school year, thereby adopting the superintendentâ€™s \r\n  recommendation.Â  She appealed the decision of the Board to the circuit court, \r\n  which affirmed.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe scope of review that applies to cases brought \r\n  under the Teacher Employment and Dismissal Act is limited to whether the grounds \r\n  given for termination of employment are supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  \r\n  Hendrickson v. Spartanburg County Sch. Dist., 307 S.C. 108, 110, 413 \r\n  S.E.2d 871, 872-73 (Ct. App. 1992).Â Â Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla \r\n  of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is \r\n  evidence which, considering the record as a whole would allow reasonable minds \r\n  to reach the conclusion the administrative agency must have reached in order \r\n  to justify its action.â€Â  Â Id., 307 S.C. at 110-11, 413 S.E.2d at 873.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nCalhoun first argues that the Board failed to enforce \r\n  her legal right to receive written notice of perceived deficiencies and an opportunity \r\n  to improve.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Teacher Employment and Dismissal Act \r\n  (the Act) governs the employment and dismissal of all continuing contract teachers \r\n  in the South Carolina public school system.Â  Among other things, it empowers \r\n  school boards to employ teachers and to discharge them â€œwhen good and sufficient \r\n  reasons for doing so present themselves.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-19-90(2) (1976).Â  \r\n  Here, Calhoun was terminated pursuant to two portions of the Act.Â  The first \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n[a]ny teacher may be dismissed at any time who shall \r\n  fail, or who may be incompetent, to give instruction in accordance with the \r\n  directions of the superintendent, or who shall otherwise manifest an evident \r\n  unfitness for teaching; provided, however, that notice and an opportunity \r\n  shall be afforded for a hearing prior to any dismissal. Evident unfitness for \r\n  teaching is manifested by conduct such as, but not limited to, the following: \r\n  persistent neglect of duty, willful violation of rules and regulations of district \r\n  board of trustees â€¦.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-25-430 (1976) (emphasis removed).Â  \r\n  The second part of the Act upon which the Board based its termination provides:\r\n\r\n[w]henever a superior, principal,Â  or supervisor charged with \r\n  the supervision of a teacher finds it necessary to admonish a teacher for a \r\n  reason that he believes may lead to, or be cited as a reason for, dismissal \r\n  or cause the teacher not to be reemployed he shall: (1) bring the matter in \r\n  writing to the attention of the teacher involved and make a reasonable effort \r\n  to assist the teacher to correct whatever appears to be the cause of potential \r\n  dismissal or failure to be reemployed and, (2) except as provided in \r\n  Â§ 59-25-450 [2] , allow reasonable \r\n  time for improvement.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-25-440 (1976) (emphasis added).\r\nIn the present case, Calhoun received numerous written \r\n  and oral warnings over nearly a three-year period, beginning in the fall of \r\n  1999.Â  By her own admission, Peterkin provided Calhoun a written notice of his \r\n  concerns about her teaching performance and parent complaints as early as January \r\n  2000. Â Furthermore, Calhoun does not dispute that for a two-and-one-half \r\n  year period preceding the Boardâ€™s decision not to renew her contract, Peterkin \r\n  and others provided her â€œwith either remediation plans or improvement plans \r\n  designed to help â€¦ improve [her] teaching.â€ Rather, she expressed a belief that \r\n  she was â€œthoroughlyâ€ addressing their suggestions.Â  In essence, she offers no \r\n  indication that, given more time to improve, she would alter her performance \r\n  in any way.Â  We find that sufficient evidence exists to establish that Calhoun \r\n  received sufficient written notice of alleged deficiencies with her performance, \r\n  more than reasonable assistance by MCHS to help her correct the alleged deficiencies, \r\n  and a reasonable amount of time to demonstrate improvement in the areas of alleged \r\n  deficiencies. \r\nII.\r\nCalhoun next argues that the Act gives rise to a fiduciary \r\n  duty that the Board breached by allowing her to be evaluated by an allegedly \r\n  â€œflawed process.â€Â  We acknowledge â€“ as does the District â€“ that a school board \r\n  owes a general duty of good faith and fair dealing consistent with the procedures \r\n  and mandates of the Act.Â  We, however, need not reach the question of whether \r\n  the Act creates a separate and independent fiduciary duty, for Calhoun has failed \r\n  in any event to establish a breach of any such duty. \r\n  [3] \r\nOne alleged flaw in the evaluation process, according \r\n  to Calhoun, is that past comments allegedly made by S.T.E.P. evaluator Baker \r\n  suggested her â€œbiasâ€ against Calhoun.Â  However, Calhoun offers no evidence of \r\n  actual bias on Bakerâ€™s part.Â  We thus find no merit to this argument.Â  See \r\n  Green v. Clarendon County School Dist. Three, 923 F.Supp. 829, 846 (D.S.C. \r\n  1996)(stating that the â€œnebulous concept of a â€˜probabilityâ€™ of unfairness[] \r\n  is not sufficient proof of actual biasâ€). \r\nThe second alleged flaw stems from evaluator Blackâ€™s \r\n  testimony that she had â€œsecretâ€ concerns about Calhounâ€™s performance that were \r\n  not reflected on Calhounâ€™s 2000-2001 evaluation.Â  Calhoun contends this violated \r\n  the Actâ€™s requirement that she receive written notice and remediation.Â  We have, \r\n  however, determined, as noted above, that Calhoun otherwise received sufficient \r\n  notice, remediation guidance, and time to demonstrate improvement over a two-and-one-half \r\n  year period prior to the decision of the Board not to renew her contract.Â  A \r\n  review of the record demonstrates that the ultimate decision of the Board was \r\n  based on the cumulative effect of all facts and circumstances surrounding Calhounâ€™s \r\n  persistent pattern of noncompliance with the remediation plans.Â  There was no \r\n  substantial reliance on the so-called â€œsecretâ€ concerns of Black.Â  We find no \r\n  â€œbreachâ€ of the Act or purported fiduciary duty.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nCalhoun contends the District \r\n  failed to prove its case before the Board because the District relied, in part, \r\n  on hearsay evidence of parent and student complaints regarding her teaching \r\n  performance.Â  In doing so, Calhoun argues the Board, in allowing such testimony, \r\n  violated her Constitutional rights.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is well established \r\n  that school board hearings under the Act are â€œquasi-judicialâ€ administrative \r\n  hearings.Â  See e.g., Laws v. Richland County School Dist. No. \r\n  1, 270 S.C. 492, 243 S.E.2d 192 (1978).Â  The rules of evidence do not strictly \r\n  apply to teacher dismissal hearings.Â  Richards v. City of Columbia, 227 \r\n  S.C. 538, 552, 88 S.E.2d 683, 689 (1955) (â€œ[E]ven without the aid of statute \r\n  it is held that an administrative or quasi-judicial body is not governed by \r\n  the ordinary legal rules of evidenceâ€);Â  Jacoby v. S.C. State Bd. Of Naturopathic \r\n  Examiners, 219 S.C. 66, 90, 64 S.E.2d 138, 149 (1951) (â€œAn administrative \r\n  or quasi judicial body is allowed a wide latitude of procedure and not restricted \r\n  to the strict rule of evidence adhered to in a judicial court.â€).Â  Thus, we \r\n  find no error in the admission of hearsay evidence regarding parent and teacher \r\n  complaints. [4] Â  \r\nIV.\r\nFinally, Calhoun argues that the Board failed to \r\n  objectively determine if â€œgood and just causeâ€ had been proven to support the \r\n  Boardâ€™s decision not to renew her employment contract.Â  Calhoun maintains that \r\n  the Board refused â€œto view the record in its entiretyâ€ and disregarded testimony \r\n  favorable to Calhoun provided by one of Calhounâ€™s fellow faculty members, two \r\n  of Calhounâ€™s former students, and Calhounâ€™s sister.Â  Calhoun essentially urges \r\n  us to discredit the evidence relied upon by the Board. \r\nThe ultimate inquiry is whether substantial evidence \r\n  supports the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  We find substantial evidence in the record to \r\n  support the Boardâ€™s decision to terminate Calhoun.Â  We emphasize that our limited \r\n  standard of review precludes fact-finding on our part.Â  Having concluded that \r\n  the Boardâ€™s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we are constrained \r\n  to affirm.Â Â  In so holding, we in no way diminish Dr. Calhounâ€™s lengthy and \r\n  laudable career in public education.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] &nbsp;&nbsp; S.T.E.P. was a formal teacher evaluation process used \r\n    by District at the time.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] &nbsp;&nbsp; Section 59-25-450 provides for the â€œimmediate suspensionâ€ \r\n    of teachers in limited circumstances.Â  S.C.

Pape, Jr., of Atlanta, for Appellants.\r\nJames Arthur Brown, Jr., of Beaufort, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  In early 1999, Bill \r\n  and Susie Passaloukas (â€œAppellantsâ€) approached Gary and Cynthia Bensch (â€œRespondentsâ€) \r\n  and initiated discussion concerning the possible leasing of commercial real \r\n  estate owned by Respondents for the purpose of opening a restaurant.Â  Following \r\n  these discussions, the parties incorporated Zorbaâ€™s Inc., a statutory close \r\n  corporation, to operate the restaurant.Â  Appellants and Respondents were each \r\n  fifty-percent owners of this corporation, which was funded by contributions \r\n  in various forms from both parties.Â  Zorbaâ€™s Inc. then entered into a commercial \r\n  lease agreement with Respondents to rent retail space for the restaurant.Â  This \r\n  agreement essentially placed Respondents in the dual role of sole landlord and \r\n  half owner of the leasing entity.Â  \r\nZorbaâ€™s lease with Respondents provided \r\n  for default in the event rent was not paid, and clearly stated eviction could \r\n  occur if default was not cured within ten days of notice.Â  Just months into \r\n  the restaurantâ€™s operation, Zorbaâ€™s had yet to turn a profit and various disagreements \r\n  arose between Appellants and Respondents.Â  In November 1999, Appellants withheld \r\n  the rent money due to a disagreement over Respondentsâ€™ alleged responsibility \r\n  to correct some problems with the property.Â  The rent was put in an attorneyâ€™s \r\n  escrow account and eventually paid to Respondents.Â  In December, however, the \r\n  rent was again withheld due to disagreements between the parties and financial \r\n  woes. \r\nIn response to the non-payment of rent, \r\n  Respondents evicted Zorbaâ€™s, Inc. from the premises by changing the locks on \r\n  the restaurant and threatening Appellants with criminal prosecution if they \r\n  attempted entry.Â  After a short and ill-fated attempt by Respondents to operate \r\n  their own restaurant on the premises, the restaurant, its good-will, and all \r\n  its equipment was sold to another restaurant for $75,000.Â  The purchasing restaurant \r\n  also entered into a five-year lease with Respondents for the retail space.\r\nAppellants brought an action individually and as \r\n  a derivative suit on behalf of Zorbas, Inc. against Respondents and Zorbaâ€™s.Â  \r\n  Appellants set forth several causes of action relating to actions of Respondents, \r\n  including breach of fiduciary duty, unfair trade practices, and misappropriation \r\n  of corporate assets.Â  Additionally, they brought individual and derivative claims \r\n  for damages resulting from the alleged conversion of corporate and personal \r\n  property which was in the restaurant on the date of eviction.Â  Respondents counterclaimed \r\n  for damages.Â  After hearing exhaustive and often conflicting testimony from \r\n  the parties, the circuit court ordered any remaining assets of Zorbas be used \r\n  to pay creditors and then split evenly between Appellants and Respondents. He \r\n  denied all other claims of both parties.Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nDespite the daunting amount of testimony and evidence \r\n  presented in the record on appeal, we conclude a strict accounting is necessary \r\n  to properly answer the questions before this court.Â  While the trial court attempted \r\n  to allow as much into the record as possible in an effort to preclude remanding \r\n  the action, there is scant evidence from either party as to the identity and \r\n  value of the property owned by Zorbaâ€™s, the specific amounts of debt owed, or \r\n  how the proceeds from the sale of Zorbaâ€™s, its corporate assets, or Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  personal property were applied to this alleged debt.Â  Although both parties \r\n  introduced several vague and unspecific valuations, the recordâ€™s lack of particularity \r\n  leaves this court without the means to determine whether the circuit erred in \r\n  simply splitting Zorbaâ€™s meager remaining corporate assets.\r\nWe deem an accounting necessary to properly \r\n  determine whether Respondents converted corporate assets to their personal use \r\n  and whether there is any indication of oppressive or unfairly prejudicial behavior \r\n  on the part of Respondents.Â  The accounting should detail the contributions \r\n  by the parties; the identity and value of equipment, furnishings, and other \r\n  items in Zorbaâ€™s at the time of eviction; the disposal of any property belonging \r\n  to Zorbaâ€™s; any revenues from the disposal of Zorbaâ€™s property; and Zorbaâ€™s \r\n  debts, both paid and currently outstanding.Â  As all remaining issues raised \r\n  on appeal are to some degree intertwined with the factual conclusions to be \r\n  determined by the strict accounting, we do not address them at this time.Â  Instead, \r\n  we remand for a strict accounting followed by a full de novo review \r\n  of all legal and equitable issues.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and WILLIAMS, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-507","title":"State v Kelsey","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2004-UP-507","description":null,"date":"2004-10-13","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoTitle\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:18.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.MsoSubtitle\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:Arial;\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.MsoBlockText\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT\r\nBE CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING\r\nEXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), \r\n  SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nThe State,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent,\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nKathryn Nicole Kelsey,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAppellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Charleston County\r\nDaniel&nbsp; F.Â  Pieper, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-507\r\nSubmitted October 1, 2004 â€“ Filed October \r\n  13, 2004\r\n\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Aileen P.

Goodwin, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Mervin Wilber Hall appeals a \r\n  circuit court order that affirms the denial of workersâ€™ compensation benefits \r\n  by his employer US Food Services.Â  We affirm. [1]  \r\nHall contends he suffered a back injury while on \r\n  the job.Â  Food Services disputes that.Â  The single commissioner denied Hallâ€™s \r\n  claim, pointing to his lack of credibility, his failure to carry the burden \r\n  of proof, and the believability of Food Servicesâ€™ witnesses. Â An appellate \r\n  panel affirmed the single commissioner. Â The circuit court, in turn, \r\n  affirmed the appellate panel.\r\nHall claims he injured his back when he \r\n  adjusted his seat while driving a company truck. Â An investigation conducted \r\n  by Food Services, however, showed the seat could not be moved either forward \r\n  or backward because of a broken handle used to adjust the seat.Â  \r\n At the hearing before the single commissioner, \r\n  Hall acknowledged he had sustained a prior back injury when he adjusted a seat \r\n  on a company bus while employed elsewhere.Â  Hall admitted to having suffered \r\n  other prior back injuries as well, but only after Food Services confronted him \r\n  at the hearing before the single commissioner with medical records. Â Hall \r\n  failed to report these injuries to the doctors who treated him for the alleged \r\n  injury that led to the present claim because he â€œdidnâ€™t think [the information] \r\n  was relevant.â€ \r\nI.\r\nHall first argues the circuit court erred in affirming \r\n  the order of the workersâ€™ compensation commission because the commission failed \r\n  to make specific and detailed findings of fact.\r\nFindings of fact in a final decision of an administrative \r\n  body, such as the workersâ€™ compensation commission, must contain â€œa concise \r\n  and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings.â€Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (2002).Â  The commission satisfied this requirement here.Â Â  \r\n  See Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 159-160, 519 S.E.2d \r\n  102, 105 (1999) (holding the findings of the workersâ€™ compensation commission \r\n  that a claimant did not suffer a work-related injury were sufficient where the \r\n  commission based its decision on the lack of credibility of the claimant and \r\n  on the credibility of the employerâ€™s witnesses)\r\nThe commission found as a fact that Hall did not \r\n  sustain any injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment.Â  \r\n  Â The â€œconcise and explicit statementâ€ of the underlying facts that support \r\n  this finding are the following: (1) Hall â€œwas not credible due to inconsistencies, \r\n  vague answers, and misstatements,â€ and failed â€œto disclose material information \r\n  until confronted with documentationâ€; (2) Hall gave â€œinconsistent answers in \r\n  regards to prior injuries,â€ concealed the existence â€œof prior injuries until \r\n  confronted with . . . medical documentationâ€ reflecting those injuries; and \r\n  (3) the commission viewed the employerâ€™s witnesses as being â€œcredibleâ€ when \r\n  they testified Hall said he was going to sue the company â€œif he did not get \r\n  a new seat in his truck.â€ \r\nII.\r\nHall next questions the commissionâ€™s finding that \r\n  Hall â€œfailed to prove his case.â€Â  He says there is â€œone reasonâ€ for this finding: \r\n  the commission found Hall â€œwas not a credible witness.â€Â  This statement is not \r\n  quite correct.Â  The commission also found the employerâ€™s witnesses were credible. \r\n  As we noted above, these findings are sufficient to support the commissionâ€™s \r\n  decision.Â  Sharpe, 336 S.C. at 159-160, 519 S.E.2d at 105.Â  Determinations \r\n  regarding the credibility of witnesses in a workersâ€™ compensation case are singularly \r\n  for the commission.Â  Shealy v.

Taylor, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJohn William Ray, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Carolyn M. Taylor, a/k/a Carolyn \r\n  Younns Murphy Taylor, appeals the trial courtâ€™s order denying her motion to \r\n  set aside a default judgment in favor of BB&amp;T, f/k/a Southern National Bank, \r\n  asserting the judgment is void for lack of sufficient service of process.Â  We \r\n  affirm.1\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBB&amp;T filed this action for collection \r\n  of a consumer debt on May 29, 1998.Â  A process server purported to serve Taylor \r\n  on June 17, 1998, stating in his affidavit of service that the â€œ[d]ocuments \r\n  [were] posted on front door after person(s) inside refused to answer door.â€Â  \r\n  On July 17, 1998, BB&amp;T filed an affidavit of default.Â  The Honorable L. \r\n  Henry McKellar granted BB&amp;T a default judgment on the liquidated debt, costs, \r\n  and attorneyâ€™s fees totaling $8,926.10 by order filed August 3, 1998.Â  \r\nOn July 16, 2004, Taylor filed a motion \r\n  to vacate the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, claiming the court \r\n  lacked personal jurisdiction in this matter due to insufficiency of service \r\n  of the summons and complaint.Â  The Honorable Alison R. Lee denied the motion.2 \r\n  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nQuestions of fact arising on a motion \r\n  to quash service of process for lack of jurisdiction over the defendant are \r\n  to be determined by the circuit court.Â  Brown v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, \r\n  P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 583, 560 S.E.2d 624, 631 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œThe findings \r\n  of the circuit court on such issues are binding on the appellate court unless \r\n  wholly unsupported by the evidence or manifestly influenced or controlled by \r\n  error of law.â€Â  Id.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTaylor argues the circuit court erred \r\n  in finding she was properly served with the summons and complaint.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 4(d)(1), SCRCP, provides service may be made \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\nUpon an individual other than a minor under the age of 14 \r\n  years or an incompetent person, by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint \r\n  to him personally or by leaving copies thereof at his dwelling house or usual \r\n  place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing \r\n  therein, or by delivering a copy to an agent authorized by appointment or by \r\n  law to receive service of process. \r\n\r\nRule 4, SCRCP, serves the dual purposes \r\n  of conferring personal jurisdiction on the court and assuring the defendant \r\n  of reasonable notice of the action.Â  Roche v. Young Bros., Inc., 318 \r\n  S.C. 207, 209, 456 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1995).Â  Exacting compliance with the rules \r\n  is not required to effect service of process.Â  Id. at 209-10, 456 S.E.2d \r\n  at 899.Â  Rather, inquiry must be made as to whether the plaintiff has sufficiently \r\n  complied with the rules such that the court has personal jurisdiction of the \r\n  defendant and the defendant has notice of the proceedings.Â  Id. at 210, \r\n  456 S.E.2d at 899.Â  The plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the court \r\n  has personal jurisdiction over the defendant.Â  Moore v. Simpson, 322 \r\n  S.C. 518, 523, 473 S.E.2d 64, 66 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  However, service of process \r\n  â€œshould not become a game of wiles and tricks and a defendant should not be \r\n  able to defeat service simply by refusing to accept the papers or by instructing \r\n  others to reject service.â€ 62B Am.Jur. 2d Process Â§ 204 (1990).\r\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals found service \r\n  was effective when, after the defendantâ€™s wife ordered the process server to \r\n  leave and closed the door, the process server declared in a voice sufficiently \r\n  loud enough to be heard that he was leaving the papers at the front door and \r\n  left after doing so.Â  Jacobson v. Garland, 487 S.E.2d 640 (Ga. Ct. App. \r\n  1997).Â  The court explained:Â  â€œIt is the duty of a defendant to accept and submit \r\n  to the service of process when he is aware of the process serverâ€™s purpose.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 642.Â  \r\nSimilarly, the New York Court of Appeals held â€œif \r\n  the person to be served interposes a door between himself and the process server, \r\n  the latter may leave the summons outside the door, provided the person to be \r\n  served is made aware he is doing so.â€Â  Bossuk v. Steinberg, 447 N.E.2d \r\n  56, 58 (N.Y. 1983).Â  It extended this holding to leaving a copy of the summons \r\n  outside the door of the person to be served upon the refusal of â€œa person of \r\n  suitable age and discretionâ€ to open the door to accept it, provided the process \r\n  server informs the person to whom delivery is being made that this is being \r\n  done.Â  Id.Â  The court in Bossuk noted that no question had been \r\n  raised concerning the fact that the children who received service, one 14 and \r\n  the other 15, were of â€œsuitable age and discretion.â€Â  Id.Â  See also \r\n  Wood v. Weenig, 736 P.2d 1053, 1055 (Utah Ct. App. 1987) (finding service \r\n  valid where process server left the summons and complaint on the defendantâ€™s \r\n  doorstep after a fruitless conversation with a faceless individual inside the \r\n  residence who had identified herself as the defendantâ€™s daughter and as being \r\n  of suitable age even though both of the defendantâ€™s daughters denied having \r\n  spoken to the process server); CRB v. Wyoming, 974 P.2d 931, 935 (Wyo. \r\n  1999) (finding service of process was proper where after the defendant refused \r\n  to open his apartment door to accept service, the process server called him \r\n  while still outside of the apartment and informed him that he had papers to \r\n  serve on him, and then told him that the process server would leave the papers \r\n  in the defendantâ€™s mailbox).\r\nIn the present case, BB&amp;Tâ€™s process server \r\n  stated in an affidavit that he made nine visits to Taylorâ€™s residence in his \r\n  attempt to serve her.Â  On several occasions, he confirmed someone was in the \r\n  residence, but no one would answer the door.Â  He checked the public records \r\n  to confirm Taylorâ€™s address and discover what type of vehicle she owned and \r\n  the vehicleâ€™s license tag number.Â  He returned to Taylorâ€™s residence on June \r\n  17, 1998 at approximately 4:30 p.m.Â  He noted that Taylorâ€™s vehicle and another \r\n  vehicle were in the driveway.Â  Once again, although someone was definitely present \r\n  in the residence, the occupant refused to come to the door.Â  The process server \r\n  called out his intent to leave the papers and secured the papers to the front \r\n  door.Â  He averred, â€œI left copies [of the papers] at [Taylorâ€™s] dwelling house \r\n  and usual place of abode with some person, I believe the Defendant, of suitable \r\n  age and discretion occupying the premises at that time.â€Â  \r\nBB&amp;Tâ€™s attorney stated in an affidavit \r\n  that he wrote to Taylor at both addresses for her residence confirming the service \r\n  and asking her to contact him after the process server left the papers at Taylorâ€™s \r\n  residence.Â  After the judgment was served on Taylor, he wrote her again at both \r\n  addresses.Â  He subsequently sought and received an execution against her property.Â  \r\n  The attorney averred that none of the correspondence he sent Taylor was ever \r\n  returned as improperly addressed or undeliverable.Â  \r\nIn her affidavit, Taylor acknowledged that she \r\n  resided at the residence where the process server left the papers and that the \r\n  addresses BB&amp;Tâ€™s attorney used were valid addresses for her property.Â  However, \r\n  she asserted she never received the summons and complaint the process server \r\n  left at her house on June 17, 1998.Â  She also claimed she never received any \r\n  of the correspondence from BB&amp;Tâ€™s attorney.Â  Taylor averred the first time \r\n  she knew of the existence of BB&amp;Tâ€™s action was when she discovered the judgment \r\n  against her while checking the records in the clerk of courtâ€™s office.Â  \r\nThe circuit court held, â€œ[u]nder the circumstances, \r\n  it cannot be argued that one may avoid service merely by refusing to answer \r\n  the door, and such avoidance should not be allowed.â€Â  The process server stated \r\n  he left the summons and complaint at Taylorâ€™s residence with a person of suitable \r\n  age and discretion, whom he believed to be Taylor.Â  Although Taylor denied receiving \r\n  the documents, there is evidence in the record to support the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  conclusion that Taylor was properly served.Â  Accordingly, under our limited \r\n  standard of review, we hold the trial court did not err in denying Taylorâ€™s \r\n  motion to set aside the default judgment.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., and CURETON, \r\n  A.J. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n  1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n  2 Judge McKellar retired July 31, 2002.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-514","title":"State v.

[1] Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis case arises from a lengthy and complex procedural \r\n  history.  [2] Â  Babb filed a breach of contract action against \r\n  Thompson regarding their business relationship.Â  A default judgment was entered \r\n  against Thompson in the amount of $63,000, plus prejudgment interest.Â  Babb \r\n  filed this action seeking to collect his judgment.Â  The action was designated \r\n  a complex case over which Judge J. Michael Baxley presided.Â  During the course \r\n  of this litigation, Thompson assumed sole ownership of Waterway.Â  Subsequently, \r\n  and also during the course of litigation, Thompson died in the state of California.Â  \r\n  Thompson and Waterway have insufficient assets to satisfy Babbâ€™s judgment.Â  \r\n\r\nBabb filed a \r\n  petition, as a judgment creditor, to open an estate for Thompson in South Carolina \r\n  and to be appointed personal representative.Â  The probate court issued an order \r\n  dismissing Babbâ€™s case due to inactivity and removed the file from the active \r\n  docket with leave to restore upon good cause shown. Â A letter attached to the \r\n  order of the probate court stated the reason the file was being closed was because \r\n  it â€œappears to be defunct in fact and not susceptible to ending by Letters Dismissory.â€Â  \r\n\r\n By a prior order of the circuit judge, Waterwayâ€™s corporate income \r\n  and accounts, excluding its operating account, were impounded.Â  Additionally, \r\n  another prior order of the circuit judge released $10,000 from the impounded \r\n  funds into Waterwayâ€™s operating account.Â  At the time of the final hearing, \r\n  the impounded funds totaled $71,975.38.Â  Waterwayâ€™s previous attorney, Michael \r\n  Henthorne, held a sum of money, presumably paid from Waterwayâ€™s operating account, \r\n  [3]  in his escrow account.Â  \r\nAt the final hearing in this action, Babb sought partial satisfaction \r\n  of his judgment through payment of the impounded funds.Â  Babb also sought a \r\n  writ of assistance assigning to him all of the stock of Waterway.Â  Further, \r\n  Babb requested the trial court hold Thompson and Waterway in contempt and asked \r\n  for sanctions arising from alleged violations \r\n  [4]  of the courtâ€™s previous orders. Â Babb also requested punitive \r\n  damages. Â Finally, Babb appealed to the circuit court the probate courtâ€™s \r\n  dismissal of his petition to open an estate for Thompson.Â  \r\nThe circuit judge \r\n  ordered $2,377 of impounded funds be paid to accountant Harold R. Cooper, for \r\n  his services as ordered by the court and necessitated by the litigation.Â  As \r\n  for the remainder of the impounded funds, the judge ordered they be paid to \r\n  Babb in partial satisfaction of his judgment.Â  The judge also authorized Henthorne \r\n  to withdraw $4,488 of his outstanding and past due legal fees from his escrow \r\n  account, finding Henthorneâ€™s work greatly beneficial to the court and to Babb.Â  \r\n  The order denied Babbâ€™s request for a writ of assistance, finding it would not \r\n  be beneficial and would only generate further litigation.Â  The judge denied \r\n  Babbâ€™s motion for contempt, stating that he found Thomson and Waterway had substantially \r\n  complied with the previous orders. The judge also denied Babbâ€™s request for \r\n  punitive damages.Â  Finally, the judge declined to reverse the probate courtâ€™s \r\n  order dismissing Babbâ€™s petition to open an estate for Thompson, ultimately \r\n  concurring with the probate courtâ€™s decision to dismiss the initial filing as \r\n  inadequate, but noting that Babb had failed to request a rehearing or move to \r\n  restore the case to the probate court.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Whether the trial court erred in providing for payment of Henthorneâ€™s fees;\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Whether the trial court erred in providing for payment of accountant Cooper \r\n  from the impounded funds;\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Whether the trial court erred in denying Babbâ€™s motion for writ of assistance;\r\n  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Whether the trial court had jurisdiction to deny Babbâ€™s motion for punitive \r\n  damages; and\r\n  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Whether the trial court erred in failing to remand to the probate court the \r\n  issue of the dismissal of Babbâ€™s petition to open an estate for Thompson.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAs an initial matter, we note that Babb has provided us with an incomplete \r\n  record on appeal.Â  For a case with a substantial procedural history, the record \r\n  in this case is sparse.Â  Significantly, Babb has failed to include in his record \r\n  a copy of his complaint in this matter.Â  Without this, we can only speculate \r\n  as to the causes of action under which Babb requested payment of the impounded \r\n  funds.Â  See Harkins v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. 606, 616, 533 \r\n  S.E.2d 886, 891 (2000) (stating the appellant has the burden of presenting a \r\n  sufficient record to allow review).Â  â€œExcept as provided by Rule 212 and Rule \r\n  208(b)(1)(C) and (2), the appellate court will not consider any fact which does \r\n  not appear in the Record on Appeal.â€Â  Rule 210(h), SCACR.Â  Only matters the \r\n  parties deem not to be relevant to the appeal are properly excluded from the \r\n  record.Â  See Former v. Butler, 319 S.C. 275, 277 n.1, 460 S.E.2d \r\n  425, 427 n.1 (Ct. App. 1995). â€œ[T]he South Carolina Appellate Court Rules are \r\n  not mere technicalities but provide the parties and this Court with an orderly \r\n  mechanism through which to guide appeals in this State.Â  It is incumbent upon \r\n  counsel to provide material that complies with the Rules and facilitates appellate \r\n  review.â€Â  Henning v. Kaye, 307 S.C. 436, 437, 415 S.E.2d 794, 794 (1992).Â  \r\n  See also State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, 265, n.5, 589 S.E.2d \r\n  6, 9 n.5 (2003) (â€œA pro se litigant who knowingly elects to represent \r\n  himself assumes full responsibility for complying with substantive and procedural \r\n  requirements of the law.â€);Â  State v. Hollman, 232 S.C. 489, 498, 102 \r\n  S.E.2d 873, 877 (1958) (stating that established rules of procedure are not \r\n  to be discarded on appeal merely because a party appeared pro se), \r\n  overruled on other grounds by Stevenson v. State, 335 S.C. 193, \r\n  516 S.E.2d 434 (1999).Â  In this case, without knowing the causes of action Babb \r\n  proceeded under to collect the impounded funds, we are unable to determine and \r\n  apply the proper standard of review.Â Â Â Â Â \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Payment of attorney's fees\r\nBabb claims the judge erred in providing for payment of attorney \r\n  Henthorneâ€™s legal fees.Â  Babb asserts Henthorne waived his right to request \r\n  fees because he failed to appear at the final hearing.Â Â  This issue is not preserved \r\n  for our review because Babb did not raise it to the circuit judge at the final \r\n  hearing.Â  Rather, Babb raised this issue for the first time in a Rule 59(e) \r\n  motion. â€œA party cannot use Rule 59(e) to present to the court an issue the \r\n  party could have raised prior to judgment but did not.â€Â  Hickman v. Hickman,Â  \r\n  301 S.C. 455, 456, 392 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct. App. 1990) (citations omitted). \r\n\r\nTo the extent that Babb argues the judge erred in allowing Henthorneâ€™s \r\n  fees to be paid out of â€œmonies used in the winding up of Waterwayâ€™s affairs,â€ \r\n  we find this issue not properly before us.Â  Henthorneâ€™s affidavit stated that \r\n  he accrued his fees in complying with the courtâ€™s order for an accounting and \r\n  in winding up Waterwayâ€™s corporate affairs.Â  In an unappealed order, the circuit \r\n  judge found Henthorneâ€™s firm to be a claimant and â€œaccorded [the firm] claimant \r\n  status to the extent of its unpaid legal and professional fees,â€ amounting to \r\n  $11,170.68.Â  The order specifically stated that â€œthis court shall consider at \r\n  a subsequent dispositional hearing whether all or a portion of the [firmâ€™s] \r\n  fees should be paid from the remaining assets of the corporation over which \r\n  this court has jurisdiction.â€Â  By another unappealed order of the circuit judge, \r\n  $10,000 of impounded funds were released to Waterwayâ€™s operating account, which \r\n  was not impounded, to be used as â€œnecessary for the winding up of Defendant \r\n  Waterwayâ€™s corporate affairs.â€Â  Babb did not appeal the prior order treating \r\n  the firm as a claimant or the prior order allowing the operating account to \r\n  be used for the winding up of Waterwayâ€™s affairs.Â  Thus, these orders became \r\n  the law of the case.Â  See Brading v. County of Georgetown, 327 \r\n  S.C. 107, 113, 490 S.E.2d 4, 7 (1997).Â  Furthermore, Babb does not contest the \r\n  fact that Henthorne accrued the fees in winding up Waterwayâ€™s affairs. Therefore, \r\n  the actions of the circuit judge in allowing Henthorne to treat fees accrued \r\n  in the winding up of Waterwayâ€™s affairs as earned and permitting Henthorne to \r\n  withdraw the balance of the escrow account ($4,480.00) are not subject to our \r\n  review.Â  \r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Payment of accountant Cooperâ€™s fees\r\nBabb argues the circuit judge erred in awarding accountant Cooper \r\n  fees from the impounded funds.Â  Babb does not cite to any authority in support \r\n  of his proposition.Â  As a result, we deem this issue abandoned on appeal.Â  See \r\n  First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994).Â  \r\n  However, even if we were to address the merits and apply the broad standard \r\n  of review for actions in equity, we find Babbâ€™s argument to be without merit.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn an appeal from an action in equity, this Court has jurisdiction \r\n  to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  However, this broad scope of review does not require an appellate court to disregard \r\n  the findings below or ignore the fact that the trial judge is in the better \r\n  position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Moreover, the appellant \r\n  is not relieved of his burden of convincing the appellate court the trial judge \r\n  committed error in his findings.Â  \r\n\r\nPinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387-88, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001) \r\n  (citations omitted). \r\nWe are satisfied and the record demonstrates \r\n  that Cooperâ€™s work was court ordered and necessitated by this litigation.Â  The \r\n  following dialogue took place between Babb and the circuit judge:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      The Court:Â \r\n       All right, is it within you â€“ itâ€™s your position that no other \r\n  claimant then should receive any [impounded] funds other than you?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Mr.\r\n        Babb:&nbsp;\r\n       Should not be senior, yes, sir.Â  I would think probably based on \r\n  one of your Orders that Mr. Cooper should be paid.Â  I believe his bill is $3000.00.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      The Court:Â \r\n       All right, sir, than other than Mr. Cooper you donâ€™t believe itâ€™s \r\n  your position that no other claimant should be paid in part and certainly not \r\n  in whole?Â  In other words, nobody [sic] but the remaining funds go to you other \r\n  than Accountant Cooper?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Mr.\r\n        Babb:\r\n       Thatâ€™s correct . . . .\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nBabb asserts that he consented to Cooper being paid, but contends \r\n  that payment should have been made out of the monies in the operating account. [5] Â  The record does not demonstrate \r\n  that any funds in the operating account were available to pay Cooper.Â  The record \r\n  does not show the balance of the operating account, nor does the record itemize \r\n  how the operating account was used in winding up Waterway's affairs.Â  Thus, \r\n  the equities favor providing payment for Cooperâ€™s services by means of the impounded \r\n  funds.\r\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Writ of assistance\r\nBabb argues the circuit judge erred in denying \r\n  his motion for a writ of assistance which would assign to him all of the stock \r\n  of Waterway.Â  Babb does not cite to any authority in support of his proposition.Â  \r\n  As a result, we deem this issue abandoned on appeal.Â  See First Sav. \r\n  Bank, 314 S.C. at 363, 444 S.E.2d at 514.Â Â  Nonetheless, we also disagree \r\n  with Babb on the merits of this argument.Â  \r\n The issuance of a writ of assistance rests \r\n  in the sound discretion of the trial court.Â Â  See Griggs v. Griggs, \r\n  205 S.C. 272, Â­Â­Â­274, 31 S.E.2d 505, 505 (1944).Â  The object of a writ of assistance \r\n  is to take â€œpossession [of property] from a party whose rights have been determined \r\n  by the suit in which the sale [of property] was ordered.â€Â  Id. at 275, \r\n  31 S.E.2d at 506 (citation omitted).Â  A writ of assistance is â€œâ€˜issued only \r\n  when the right is clear and free from doubt â€“ when there is no equity or appearance \r\n  of equity in defendant, and when the decree, and the sale and proceedings thereunder, \r\n  are beyond suspicion . . . .â€™â€Â  Id. at 274-75, 31 S.E.2d at 505-06 (quoting \r\n  5 C.J., Â§4 at 1317).Â  \r\nIn this case, the court found that Waterway \r\n  operated a mobile home park on real property that it did not own.Â  The order \r\n  stated that Waterway ceased operations and noted that the court had already \r\n  seized its bank accounts.Â  The order referred to Waterway as an insolvent non-entity.Â  \r\n  In fact, Waterway was dissolved prior to the final hearing on the merits.Â  Because \r\n  we find support in the record for the circuit judgeâ€™s findings, we hold the \r\n  circuit judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to issue Babb a writ \r\n  of assistance.Â  \r\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Punitive damages\r\nBabb argues the circuit judge erred in denying him punitive damages \r\n  because the judge did not have subject matter jurisdiction over that issue.Â  \r\n  Babb asserts that a prior order of the court, through an agreement of the parties, \r\n  provided for the issue of punitive damages to be heard by a master-in-equity.Â  \r\n  Babbâ€™s argument to this effect is conclusory and not supported by any authority.Â  \r\n  As a result, this issue is abandoned on appeal.Â  See First Sav. Bank, \r\n  314 S.C. at 363, 444 S.E.2d at 514.Â  \r\nMoreover, as previously noted, the record in this case is sparse. \r\n  The record contains the reference of the issue of punitive damages to a master-in-equity, \r\n  dated March 25, 1998.Â  Despite this order of reference, the issue of punitive \r\n  damages was raised to the circuit judge at the final hearing.Â  Nothing in the \r\n  record indicates why this issue was raised at that time.Â  The issue of punitive \r\n  damages was addressed at the hearing as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Mr.\r\n        Babb:&nbsp;\r\n       All right, the last thing is the punitive damages that [sic] Judge \r\n  Lockemyâ€™s Order of March of 1998 and Iâ€™m not prepared for that today.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      The\r\n        Court:&nbsp;\r\n      Well my recollection is is [sic] that issue â€“ well, let me ask \r\n  you to publish for the record what is the status of that issue.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Mr.\r\n        Babb:\r\n       Itâ€™s never been heard.Â  He ruled â€“ it seemed like to me, Iâ€™m going \r\n  from memory now that you asked that straight question, that itâ€™s to be heard \r\n  by Judge Cross but youâ€™ve taken jurisdiction.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      The Court:Â \r\n       All right, sir, then Iâ€™m going to take that under advisement, too, \r\n  and weâ€™ll look back in the Orders and again, just as it is somewhat confusing \r\n  for you, there has been a lot of litigation in this action just while Iâ€™ve been \r\n  in charge of the complex case and Iâ€™ll have to look back and see just exactly \r\n  how that issueâ€™s framed and weâ€™ll make a ruling.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n Because this case has an abundant procedural history with which the \r\n  circuit judge was very familiar, we are reluctant to find a lack of subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction based on the record before us.Â  As stated above, the record \r\n  is incomplete, and thus, we are unable to determine why the issue of punitive \r\n  damages was raised to the circuit judge at the final hearing.Â  Further, we are \r\n  unable to determine on what grounds the circuit judge would have â€œtaken jurisdiction.â€Â  \r\n  The circuit judge had all the prior orders in the case available to review and \r\n  determine how the issue of punitive damages was framed.Â  We are not afforded \r\n  the same luxury and are left only to speculate whether the court had subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction.Â  The appellant has the burden of presenting a sufficient \r\n  record to allow review.Â  SeeÂ  Harkins, 340 S.C. at 616, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  at 891.Â  Because we find Babb has not met this burden, we decline to address \r\n  this issue on appeal.\r\n5.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Appeal from probate court\r\nFinally, Babb argues that because the \r\n  circuit court applied inadequate grounds to affirm the dismissal of his probate \r\n  petition, his appeal should have been remanded to probate court for further \r\n  determinations. [6]  â€œâ€˜If the proceeding in the probate court is in the nature of \r\n  an action at law, the [appellate] court may not disturb the probate courtâ€™s \r\n  findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses there is no evidence \r\n  to support them.â€™â€Â  Macaulay v. Wachovia Bank of South Carolina, N.A., \r\n  351 S.C. 287, 293, 569 S.E.2d 371, 375, (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Howard v. \r\n  Mutz, 315 S.C. 356, 361, 434 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1993)). Rule 4 of the South \r\n  Carolina Rules of Probate Court allow the court to strike a case from the active \r\n  file with leave to restore upon good cause shown when it appears that the file \r\n  is â€œdefunct in fact and not susceptible to ending by letters dismissory . . \r\n  . .â€Â  \r\nIn this case, the order states that the \r\n  reason for dismissal was inactivity in the file, but a letter accompanying the \r\n  dismissal states the reason based on Rule 4.Â  The circuit court affirmed on \r\n  the grounds of Rule 4, finding Babbâ€™s initial filing inadequate.Â  The record \r\n  reveals that Babbâ€™s petition to open an estate for Thompson contained several \r\n  omissions.Â  Thus, we decline to overturn the circuit judgeâ€™s decision to affirm \r\n  the probate courtâ€™s dismissal of his petition.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR \r\n  (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) \r\n  appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).Â  Further, because we affirm the dismissal \r\n  of Babbâ€™s petition, there is no reason to remand the issue.Â  However, nothing \r\n  in this opinion affects Babbâ€™s right to move to restore the petition to the \r\n  active docket for good cause shown, as provided for in Rule 4 of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Probate Court.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe find Babbâ€™s argument that the circuit judge erred in awarding Henthorne legal \r\n  fees not preserved for our review and, therefore, decline to address the issue \r\n  on appeal.Â  We deem Babbâ€™s issues concerning the payment of accountant Cooperâ€™s \r\n  fees and concerning the writ of assistance abandoned on appeal.Â  Nonetheless, \r\n  these issues also fail on the merits.Â  Furthermore, Babb has failed to provide \r\n  to us a sufficient record on appeal to address whether the trial court had subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to decide the issue of punitive damages, and thus we decline \r\n  to address the issue.Â  Finally, we do not find the circuit judge abused his \r\n  discretion in affirming the decision to dismiss Babbâ€™s petition to open an estate \r\n  for Thompson in probate court.Â  Therefore, the order of the circuit judge is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Our court has twice before examined this case.Â  \r\n    A more detailed procedural history can be found in the two previous unpublished \r\n    opinions.Â  Babb v. Thompson, Op. No. 2002-UP-026 (Ct. App. filed Jan. \r\n    16, 2002) (affirming the default judgment against Thompson, but reversing \r\n    the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Babb), and 95-UP-195 (Ct. App. filed June \r\n    28, 1995) (reversing the trial judgeâ€™s denial of Babbâ€™s motions for new trial \r\n    nisi additur and new trial absolute, finding the juryâ€™s award \r\n    of $5.00 for his breach of contract claims not supported by the evidence).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Although not explicitly set forth in the record, \r\n    this is a logical presumption because the judge ordered this account be used \r\n    to wind up Waterwayâ€™s corporate affairs and Henthorneâ€™s services were utilized \r\n    for the purpose of winding up Waterwayâ€™s affairs.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Neither Babbâ€™s complaint nor his motion to hold \r\n    Thomson and Waterway in contempt appear in the record on appeal. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  Arguably, this issue is not preserved for our \r\n    review.Â  Babb did not make this specific argument at the final hearing.Â  The \r\n    argument is made for the first time in his Rule 59(e) motion.Â  See \r\n    Hickman, 301 S.C. at 456, 392 S.E.2d at 482 (â€œA party cannot use Rule \r\n    59(e) to present to the court an issue the party could have raised prior to \r\n    judgment but did not.â€).Â  However, in light of the confusing manner in which \r\n    this issue was addressed at the final hearing, Babbâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion may \r\n    have presented him with the first opportunity to raise this argument.Â  We, \r\n    therefore, address the equities presented by this issue.Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  The order dismissing Babbâ€™s petition to open an \r\n    estate for Thompson provided for â€œleave to restore [the petition] for good \r\n    cause being shown why the case should be continued as a pending case.â€Â  Instead \r\n    of moving to restore the case for good cause shown, Babb directly appealed \r\n    the probate courtâ€™s order to the circuit court.Â  Therefore, his appeal to \r\n    circuit court was, at best, premature.Â  However, because the judge decided \r\n    this issue on the merits, we also address the merits of Babbâ€™s argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-521","title":"Davis v.

Mitchell Griffith, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this declaratory \r\n  judgment action, Charlotte and Roy Davis appeal from the trial courtâ€™s grant \r\n  of summary judgment in favor of Barbara Jean Dacus.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nBoth parties stipulate to the following \r\n  facts of this case.Â  On November 23, 1998, Dacus was driving the Davises to \r\n  an appointment in Savannah, Georgia when they were involved in an automobile \r\n  accident. Dacus, an employee of the South Carolina Department of Social Services, \r\n  was driving a DSS vehicle and was acting within the course and scope of her \r\n  employment at the time of the accident.Â  \r\nAfter the accident, the Davises filed suit \r\n  against Dacus and DSS, seeking recovery for injuries they sustained.Â  Dacus \r\n  moved to dismiss the case, arguing the complaint failed to state a cause of \r\n  action against her because she had immunity under the South Carolina Tort Claims \r\n  Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 to -200 (Supp. 2003).Â  The trial court agreed, \r\n  stating: â€œThe Defendant Dacus cannot be joined in this action.Â  If there is \r\n  some possibility of insurance coverage it must be established other than in \r\n  this law suit [sic].â€ \r\nSubsequent to that order, the Davises brought \r\n  this declaratory judgment action, asking the court to declare that Dacusâ€™s liability \r\n  and underinsured motorist coverage, provided by Unisun, is â€œvalid and binding \r\n  upon the insurance company and the insured, and requiring the insurance company \r\n  to pay amounts under the liability provision of the policy or the underinsured \r\n  motorist provisions of the policy.â€Â  Dacus and Unisun filed a motion for summary \r\n  judgment, arguing that because Dacus is immune from liability pursuant to the \r\n  Tort Claims Act, there could be no direct suit against her insurance company.Â  \r\n  The trial court granted the motion.Â  The Davises filed a motion to reconsider, \r\n  which the trial court denied. This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary \r\n  judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs \r\n  the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. \r\n  Co., 306 S.C. 101, 114-115, 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).Â  Pursuant to Rule \r\n  56, SCRCP, summary judgment is proper when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to \r\n  any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a \r\n  matter of law.â€Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the \r\n  evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence \r\n  must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Strother \r\n  v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, \r\n  121 (1998) (citation omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n The Davises argue the trial \r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Dacus and her insurance \r\n  company.Â  Specifically, the Davises claim that the Tort Claims Act does not \r\n  prevent them from recovering under Dacusâ€™s automobile policy because the insurance \r\n  coverage is based in contract, and contractual liability is expressly excluded \r\n  from the Act.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhile section \r\n  15-78-20(d) of the Tort Claims Act does expressly exclude contractual liability \r\n  from immunity, there is no contractual relationship between the Davises and \r\n  Dacus or Unisun.Â  Rather, Dacusâ€™s liability to the Davises, if such liability \r\n  exists, would sound in tort.Â  However, we agree with the trial court that pursuant \r\n  to the Tort Claims Act, Dacus cannot be held personally liable for the Davisesâ€™ \r\n  injuries.Â  \r\nThe Tort \r\n  Claims Act bars civil suits against any employee of the State who is acting \r\n  within the scope of his or her employment at the time the tort occurs, unless \r\n  the employeeâ€™s actions constitute actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, \r\n  or a crime involving moral turpitude.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(a)-(b).Â  Here, \r\n  there is no question that Dacus was acting within the scope of her employment \r\n  when the accident occurred, and there is no assertion that her actions constituted \r\n  actual fraud, malice, or intent to harm.Â  Thus, Dacus cannot be held personally \r\n  liable for the injuries the Davises suffered.Â  \r\nFurthermore, as is \r\n  typical with personal automobile policies, Dacusâ€™s policy with Unisun only covers \r\n  injuries and property damage for which Dacus is legally responsible. Â Because \r\n  Dacus cannot be held either personally liable to the Davises or legally responsible \r\n  for the Davisesâ€™ injuries or property damage, Unisun likewise has no responsibility \r\n  to the Davises.Â  We therefore find the trial court did not err in granting summary \r\n  judgment in favor of Dacus and Unisun. \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-522","title":"Crockett v.

Johnson, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-522\r\nSubmitted September 15, 2004 â€“ Filed October 14, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nSamuel M. Price, Jr., of Newberry, for Appellant.\r\nEdward M. Woodward, Jr., of Columbia and Wallace K. Lightsey \r\n  and William P. Crawford, both of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: David B. Crockett brought suit \r\n  against Carolina First Bank seeking a finding that his signature on stock certificates \r\n  was a forgery and directing the bank to redeem his shares of stock.Â  The trial \r\n  court dismissed the case pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, finding the complaint \r\n  failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn his complaint, Crockett alleged he \r\n  was the owner of 1,000 shares of stock in Midlands National Bank, which merged \r\n  in 1995 with Carolina First.Â  He maintained his brother â€œabsconded with [his] \r\n  legal papers including, but not limited to, the aforementioned shares.â€Â  In \r\n  July of 1999, Crockett discovered his shares had been redeemed by the bank.Â  \r\n  Crockett claims his brother forged his signature to endorse the shares.Â  Crockettâ€™s \r\n  complaint states the forged signature was guaranteed by David Bowers, the former \r\n  President and CEO of Midlands National Bank.Â  The complaint further indicates \r\n  that Crockett is currently in possession of the original shares and has asked \r\n  Carolina First to redeem them, but that Carolina First refused. Accordingly, \r\n  Crockett asks the court to declare that his signature was forged and to require \r\n  Carolina First â€œto honor the original certificates of stock and redeem the original \r\n  certificates of stock and pay to [Crockett] the amount wrongfully paid to [Crockettâ€™s \r\n  brother], his successors or assigns.â€Â  \r\nAfter answering and filing a third-party \r\n  complaint, Carolina First moved to dismiss the appeal based on Rule 12(b)(6), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  Carolina First asserted the complaint failed to set forth a viable claim \r\n  against the bank because it was not involved in any of the alleged wrongdoing, \r\n  the claim was barred by the statute of limitations, and Crockett lacked standing \r\n  to assert liability based on the guaranty pursuant to section 36-8-306 of the \r\n  South Carolina Code (2003).Â  \r\nThe trial court granted the motion to dismiss, \r\n  finding:Â  (1) the allegations in the complaint did not set forth a legally viable \r\n  claim; (2) Carolina First was not liable to Crockett under the guaranty; (3) \r\n  Crockett failed to follow the statutory procedure for dealing with lost or stolen \r\n  stock certificates under section 36-8-405 of the South Carolina Code (2002); \r\n  and (4) Crockett was prohibited from bringing a claim against the bank under \r\n  section 36-8-406 of the South Carolina Code (2002).Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe trial court may dismiss a claim when \r\n  the defendant demonstrates the plaintiffâ€™s â€œfailure to state facts sufficient \r\n  to constitute a cause of actionâ€ in the pleadings filed with the court.Â  Rule \r\n  12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  â€œThe trial court must dispose of a motion for failure to state \r\n  a cause of action based solely upon the allegations set forth on the face of \r\n  the complaint.â€Â  Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, 366, 353 S.E.2d 697, \r\n  698 (1987).Â  â€œThe motion cannot be sustained if facts alleged in the complaint \r\n  and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle plaintiff to any \r\n  relief on any theory of the case.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œAll properly pleaded factual \r\n  allegations are deemed admittedâ€ for the purpose of considering a motion for \r\n  judgment on the pleadings.Â  Russell v. Columbia, 305 S.C. 86, 89, 406 \r\n  S.E.2d 338, 339 (1991).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCrockett contends the trial court erred \r\n  in dismissing his case.Â  We disagree.\r\nArguably, Crockettâ€™s assertion of liability \r\n  in his complaint could be characterized as the following three possible causes \r\n  of action: negligence, conversion, or liability based on David Bowersâ€™ signature \r\n  guaranty.Â  However, Crockettâ€™s complaint fails to state facts sufficient to \r\n  constitute any of these causes of action.\r\nTo make a claim for negligence, Crockett \r\n  would need to allege in the complaint that (1) Carolina First owed a duty of \r\n  care to him, (2) Carolina First breached the duty by a negligent act or omission, \r\n  (3) Carolina Firstâ€™s breach was the actual and proximate cause of Crockettâ€™s \r\n  injury, and (4) Crockett suffered an injury or damages.Â  Steinke v. South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520 \r\n  S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999).Â  As the trial court found, Crockettâ€™s complaint fails \r\n  to allege a duty of care Carolina First breached when it redeemed the shares \r\n  based on an endorsement that was allegedly forged. [2] Â  Accordingly, the complaint does \r\n  not set forth a claim of negligence.\r\nThe complaint also fails to \r\n  establish a viable claim of conversion against the bank.Â  â€œConversion is the \r\n  unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods or \r\n  personal chattels belonging to another.â€Â  Jones v. Equicredit Corp. of S.C., \r\n  347 S.C. 535, 544-545, 556 S.E.2d 713, 718 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Crane \r\n  v. Citicorp Natâ€™l Servs., Inc., 313 S.C. 70, 73, 437 S.E.2d 50, 52 (1993)).Â  \r\n  While Crockett may have a claim of conversion against his brother, he has failed \r\n  to allege how Carolina First has exercised the right of ownership over his certificates.Â  \r\n  Therefore, Crockett has failed to state a viable claim of conversion.\r\nFinally, the complaint seems to allege \r\n  Carolina First is liable on the signature guaranty of David Bowers.Â  However, \r\n  as the trial court noted, section 36-8-306(h) states:Â  \r\n\r\nThe warranties under this section are made to a person \r\n  taking or dealing with the security in reliance on the guaranty, and the \r\n  guarantor is liable to the person for loss resulting from their breach. An indorser \r\n  or originator of an instruction whose signature, indorsement, or instruction \r\n  has been guaranteed is liable to a guarantor for any loss suffered by the guarantor \r\n  as a result of breach of the warranties of the guarantor.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-306(h) (2003) (emphasis added).Â  \r\n  Crockett cannot state a claim under this section against Carolina First because \r\n  the benefit of the guaranty does not run to him.Â Â  \r\nAs we cannot deduce a viable \r\n  legal claim stated in the complaint, we find the trial court properly dismissed \r\n  the action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. \r\n  [3] Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s dismissal is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  In his brief, Crockett contends that the trial court found no duty \r\n    of care solely because Midlands National Bank had merged into Carolina First.Â  \r\n    He therefore argues that Carolina First assumed all of Midlands National Bankâ€™s \r\n    liabilities.Â  However, Crockettâ€™s complaint fails to allege any legal duty \r\n    running between him and either Carolina First or Midlands National \r\n    Bank.Â  Thus, despite the merger, Crockettâ€™s complaint fails to allege a viable \r\n    cause of action.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  As we affirm based on the failure of the complaint to state a claim \r\n    under Rule 12(b)(6), we need not address the remaining grounds for dismissal \r\n    offered by the trial court in the order of dismissal.Â  See Futch \r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d \r\n    591, 598 (1999) (ruling that an appellate court need not review remaining \r\n    issues when disposition of prior issues is dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-523","title":"State v.

Ferguson, of Laurens, for Appellant.\r\nJohn J. Sherrill, of Surfside Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Wife appeals the family courtâ€™s \r\n  order of equitable distribution, arguing the court erred in the identification, \r\n  valuation, and division of marital property and in failing to award her attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties married in 1969.Â  After separating \r\n  in 1987, they divided their assets by agreement.Â  Under the agreement, Wife \r\n  received the partiesâ€™ home in Florida and Husband received a farm they owned \r\n  in Kentucky.Â  \r\nThe parties reconciled several years later.Â  After resuming \r\n  their relationship, Husband created a trust for the purpose of avoiding probate.Â  \r\n  The trust named Husband and Wife as the beneficiaries and designated Husband \r\n  the trustee with extensive powers over the trust assets.Â  The parties placed \r\n  vehicles, savings accounts, and other property in the trust.Â  The parties also \r\n  signed a deed placing the Kentucky farm Husband received in the separation agreement \r\n  into the trust.Â  However, as to the Florida home Wife received in the separation \r\n  agreement, Husband twice prevented Wife from placing proceeds traceable from \r\n  the sale of that property into the trust.Â  \r\nThe parties separated again in 2001.Â  Wife filed \r\n  for separate maintenance and support and Husband counterclaimed for the same.Â  \r\n  Neither party filed for a divorce.Â  At the hearing, the main issues were the \r\n  Kentucky farm, the incomes of the parties, and whether Husband should continue \r\n  health insurance coverage for Wife.Â  At the end of the hearing, the family court \r\n  granted each party two weeks to submit proposed orders.Â  Husband sent his order \r\n  to the court without sending a copy to Wife, and the court signed the order \r\n  before the end of the two weeks and before receiving Wifeâ€™s proposed order.Â  \r\n\r\nAmong other things, the court found the Kentucky \r\n  farm was not marital property and divided the marital property equally, though \r\n  it used Husbandâ€™s date of hearing valuations for some of his assets rather than \r\n  his date of separation valuations.Â  The court also denied Wifeâ€™s request for \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wife moved for reconsideration, which the court denied.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find \r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. \r\n  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  \r\n  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family \r\n  courtâ€™s findings.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d \r\n  616, 617 (1981).Â  Nor does it require us to ignore the fact that the trial judge, \r\n  who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their \r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Miles v. Miles, \r\n  355 S.C. 511, 516, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied \r\n  (June 14, 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Issuance of Final Order\r\n Wife contends the final order should be \r\n  vacated because the trial court signed Husbandâ€™s proposed order prior to receiving \r\n  and reviewing Wifeâ€™s proposed order and because its submission constituted an \r\n  ex parte communication.Â  We disagree.\r\nWife cites several cases for the proposition \r\n  that a ruling cannot be issued without a party being given the opportunity to \r\n  be heard by the court in a meaningful way.Â  See, eg., Universal Benefits, \r\n  Inc. v. McKinney, 349 S.C. 179, 561 S.E.2d 659 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Even though \r\n  the court ruled without reviewing her proposed order, Wife nevertheless had \r\n  a meaningful opportunity to be heard.Â  She had a full hearing to address her \r\n  claims and offer any evidence she wished to have considered.Â  \r\nWife also asserts the ex parte nature \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s proposed order violated Rule 3.5 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR.Â  Rule 3.5 states:Â  â€œA lawyer shall not . . . [c]ommunicate \r\n  ex parte with [a judge] except as permitted by law.â€Â  Rule 3.5 was established \r\n  to prevent any improper influence of judges, jurors or other officials.Â  Although \r\n  we do not condone ex parte communication, the transmittal letter and the requested \r\n  proposed order certainly did not improperly influence the court.Â  \r\nMoreover, Wife raised these and other arguments \r\n  in her motion to reconsider, which the court denied after review.Â  For the reasons \r\n  discussed, we find no basis for vacating the family courtâ€™s final order.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Kentucky Property\r\nWife contends the trial court erred in \r\n  failing to include the Kentucky property in the marital estate.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina Code defines marital property, \r\n  which is subject to equitable distribution, as â€œall real and personal property \r\n  which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned \r\n  as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2003).Â  The statute also provides certain exceptions, \r\n  including â€œproperty excluded by written contract of the parties.â€Â  Â§ 20-7-473(4).Â  \r\n\r\nNonmarital property may be transmuted into marital \r\n  property if it (1) becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable, \r\n  (2) is jointly titled, or (3) is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage \r\n  or in some other manner so as to evidence the partiesâ€™ intent to make it marital \r\n  property.Â  Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 88, 467 S.E.2d 753, 756 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996), affâ€™d as modified, 329 S.C. 324, 494 S.E.2d 820 (1998).Â  â€œTransmutation \r\n  is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  The spouse claiming transmutation must produce objective evidence showing that \r\n  during the marriage the parties themselves regarded the property as the common \r\n  property of the marriage.Â  Id.\r\nHusband became the sole owner of the Kentucky \r\n  property by way of the 1987 separation agreement.Â  Wife does not dispute this, \r\n  but contends their subsequent reconciliation abrogated the agreement or that \r\n  the property was transmuted when it was placed into the family trust.\r\nThe partiesâ€™ reconciliation did not abrogate \r\n  the property settlement the parties reached in their 1987 separation.Â  An inherently \r\n  executory provision of a separation agreement, such as one for future support, \r\n  is abrogated by a reconciliation.Â  Bourne v. Bourne, 336 S.C. 642, 645-46, \r\n  521 S.E.2d 519, 521 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, any executed property settlement \r\n  provisions are unaffected by a subsequent reconciliation, except to the extent \r\n  the property has increased in value because of the partiesâ€™ joint efforts.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Because the parties executed the property division provided for \r\n  in the 1987 separation agreement, the property settlement was not affected by \r\n  their reconciliation.\r\nAdditionally, the evidence does not support Wifeâ€™s \r\n  claim of transmutation.Â  Although the Kentucky property was placed in the trust \r\n  with marital property, it never became untraceable.Â  Furthermore, the property \r\n  never generated any real income used to support the family or to pay debts of \r\n  the parties.Â  Although the trust gave Wife the authority to control the property, \r\n  she admitted Husband controlled the trustâ€™s assets.Â  Both parties testified \r\n  it was Husbandâ€™s idea to create the trust, and he testified the main purpose \r\n  was to avoid probate in the event of his death.Â  Finally, even though Husband \r\n  had Wife sign a deed to transfer the Kentucky property to the trust, that deed \r\n  was ineffective because Wife had executed a quitclaim deed as a result of the \r\n  1987 separation agreement.Â  See Graniteville Co. v. Williams, \r\n  209 S.C. 112, 120, 39 S.E.2d 202, 206 (1946) (finding deed signed by party without \r\n  claim to title of property was ineffective). Â Because we find Wife failed to \r\n  produce objective evidence the parties treated the farm as their common property, \r\n  we find the family court properly excluded it from the marital estate.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Inclusion or Exclusion of Other Property\r\nWife contends the family court improperly \r\n  included her income, clothing, and jewelry without also including the full amount \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s income, clothing, and jewelry.Â  Wife also contends Husband improperly \r\n  sold bonds despite being enjoined from disposing of assets.Â  We disagree.\r\nHusband testified the value he listed \r\n  for his furnishings also included his clothing and jewelry.Â  Although he was \r\n  only awarded $1,000 in furnishings, and Wifeâ€™s valuation of Husbandâ€™s clothing \r\n  and jewelry totaled $1,500, we cannot say the court abused its discretion, nor \r\n  did the failure to specifically delineate the clothes and jewelry lead to an \r\n  unfair award.Â  \r\nWife contends the trial court erred in \r\n  failing to properly include income earned by Husband or in including her income \r\n  at a gross value and his at its net value.Â  Additionally, she asserts his gambling \r\n  winnings should be added to the equitable distribution.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe partiesâ€™ incomes post-filing should \r\n  not have been included for purposes of equitable distribution.Â  See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2003) (providing â€œterm â€˜marital propertyâ€™ as used \r\n  in this article means all real and personal property which has been acquired \r\n  by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing \r\n  or commencement of marital litigationâ€).Â  Although Wife is correct that her \r\n  income was improperly included in the marital estate, Husbandâ€™s income from \r\n  the date of filing until the date of the order was also improperly included.Â  \r\n  As Wifeâ€™s income was included at approximately $11,000 and Husbandâ€™s was included \r\n  at approximately $65,000, any error benefited Wife and she is thus entitled \r\n  to no relief. Â \r\nThe evidence in the record is inconclusive as to \r\n  when the gambling winnings occurred.Â  However, there is no evidence in the record \r\n  that any sum existed at the time of filing.Â  If the winnings occurred after \r\n  filing, they constitute earnings and are not subject to equitable distribution.Â  \r\n  For either reason, the trial court properly excluded gambling proceeds from \r\n  equitable distribution.\r\nAs for the bonds, they were redeemed by the issuer \r\n  and Husband had no way to prevent their redemption.Â  Additionally, Wife did \r\n  not establish that either the bonds or their proceeds were marital property \r\n  subject to division.Â  \r\nIV.Â Â Â  Valuation of Marital Estate\r\nWife asserts the family court improperly valued \r\n  the property in the marital estate.Â  She maintains Husbandâ€™s IRA and investment \r\n  accounts were valued at the time of the hearing and not at the time of separation \r\n  as required.Â  She asserts it was error for the trial court to value his property \r\n  at the time of the hearing and her property at the time of separation.Â  We affirm \r\n  the value assigned by the family court.\r\nAs stated above, â€œmarital propertyâ€ includes â€œall \r\n  real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the \r\n  marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital \r\n  litigation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473.Â  Thus, for purposes of equitable distribution, \r\n  the value of marital property is the value of the property at the time of the \r\n  commencement of the marital litigation.Â  See Mallett v. Mallett, \r\n  323 S.C. 141, 151, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œMarital property is \r\n  valued as of the date of the filing of the complaint.â€).Â  However, where necessary \r\n  to avoid an unfair apportionment caused by significant changes in the valuation \r\n  of marital property during marital litigation, the court may â€œconsider the post-filing \r\n  appreciation or depreciation when valuing and apportioning the marital estate.â€Â  \r\n  Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 228, 512 S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nHere, Husband provided the court with \r\n  updated values of his investment accounts due to the recent market decline.Â  \r\n  The reduction in value was not caused by an intentional depletion of assets \r\n  or any fault of Husband.Â  The accounts declined along with the market, and Husband \r\n  should not be penalized for the measurable decline.Â  Accordingly, the court \r\n  did not err in using the updated values of Husbandâ€™s accounts.Â  Because Wife \r\n  failed to provide updated values of her accounts, it is impossible to determine \r\n  whether any change in her accounts occurred.Â  \r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Apportionment of Marital Estate\r\nWife also challenges the courtâ€™s division \r\n  of the marital estate.Â  She asserts the equitable distribution should be adjusted \r\n  because Husband retained the Kentucky farm as non-marital property.Â  She also \r\n  asserts Husband improperly elected to receive higher pension payments during \r\n  his life rather than lower lifetime payments that would continue after his death.Â  \r\n  We find the courtâ€™s apportionment fair and proper.\r\nThe apportionment of marital property \r\n  is within the family courtâ€™s sound discretion.Â  Morris v. Morris, 295 \r\n  S.C. 37, 39, 367 S.E.2d 24, 25 (1988).Â  Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code enumerates fifteen factors applicable to a determination of equitable distribution.Â  \r\n  The statute vests the family court with discretion to decide what weight should \r\n  be assigned to the various factors.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  On review, this court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and \r\n  if the end result is equitable, the fact this court might have weighed specific \r\n  factors differently than the family court is irrelevant.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, \r\n  296 S.C. 289, 300-01, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  This court will \r\n  affirm the family courtâ€™s apportionment of marital property where the court \r\n  addressed the factors with enough sufficiency for us to conclude the family \r\n  court was cognizant of the statutory factors.Â  Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, \r\n  502, 478 S.E.2d 854, 859 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n Both parties sought an equal division \r\n  of the marital property.Â  Wife knew the status of the Kentucky property was \r\n  an issue before the court and still argued for an equal division of the marital \r\n  assets.Â  The court stated that after â€œreflecting upon all the factors set forth \r\n  within Section 20-7-472 . . . that the intention, and thus agreement, of both \r\n  parties to divide all marital property on a 50/50 basis should be accepted.â€Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court properly considered the factors and the \r\n  testimony of the parties.Â  We find the equal division of the marital assets \r\n  a fair result and thus not an abuse of discretion.Â  Nor do we find Husbandâ€™s \r\n  pension electionâ€”a joint decision made by the parties while they were married \r\n  and before commencement of this actionâ€”a basis for adjusting the overall award.Â  \r\n\r\nVI.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nWife asserts the family court erred in failing \r\n  to award her attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We do not agree.\r\nThe decision whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees is \r\n  a matter within the family courtâ€™s sound discretion.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).Â  In determining whether to award \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their \r\n  own fees, the beneficial results obtained by the attorney, the partiesâ€™ respective \r\n  financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of \r\n  living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 \r\n  (1992).\r\nThe family court properly considered the appropriate \r\n  factors and concluded neither party was entitled to recover attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n  Although the family court may have improperly imputed the ability to continue \r\n  to earn income to the Wife, it is undisputed her income will be similar to Husbandâ€™s, \r\n  as they will divide his pension equally.Â  Additionally, the results obtained \r\n  were not more beneficial to one party than the other, and both parties received \r\n  the same amount of marital assets from which to pay their fees.Â  Finally, the \r\n  award of attorneyâ€™s fees will impact each partyâ€™s standard of living in roughly \r\n  the same manner.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in denying attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-527","title":"State v.

Felder and Bates N. Felder, both of St. Matthews, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\nSean Paul Thornton, of Walterboro, for Guardian ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The family court granted Miriam \r\n  Vallentine a divorce from Jack Vallentine on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous \r\n  separation and equitably apportioned the partiesâ€™ marital assets.Â  As part of \r\n  the apportionment, the court granted Mr. Vallentine sole ownership and possession \r\n  of the home the parties resided in and three surrounding acres, as well as a \r\n  fifteen-acre tract and a twenty-two-acre tract, but ordered him to pay Mrs. \r\n  Vallentine $58,330.00 for her interest in these assets.Â  Mr. Vallentine appeals, \r\n  arguing the court erred in finding the home and three acres, which he had inherited, \r\n  had been transmuted into marital property that was subject to equitable apportionment.Â  \r\n  We affirm.  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Vallentines were married on August 2, 1971.Â  \r\n  Both parties are in good health.Â  Mr. Vallentine has a reliable job that has \r\n  contributed to the accumulation of marital assets.Â  His income is more than \r\n  four times that of Mrs. Vallentine.Â Â Â  \r\nMrs. Vallentine performed most of the household \r\n  duties and childcare throughout the marriage.Â  The partiesâ€™ youngest child, \r\n  Jeffery, was born with Downâ€™s syndrome on July 10, 1985.Â  Mrs. Vallentine spent \r\n  the majority of her time at home caring for their special-needs child since \r\n  his birth.Â  The court noted this was a marital decision by the parties.Â Â Â  \r\nFor the majority of their marriage, the \r\n  Vallentines lived in a home owned by Mr. Vallentineâ€™s grandmother and for which \r\n  they paid her rent when she moved to a nursing home.Â  The Vallentines raised \r\n  their three children there.Â  Mr. Vallentine inherited the house and the three \r\n  surrounding acres when his grandmother died.Â  \r\nWhile living at the home, in addition to providing \r\n  continuous care to their special-needs child, Mrs. Vallentine worked to improve \r\n  the appearance of the property.Â  She planted a variety of flowers in the yard \r\n  and was primarily responsible for the general care and maintenance of the property.Â  \r\n  Mr. Vallentine also worked to improve the house by painting the interior and \r\n  doing work on the exterior of the home.Â  \r\nThe family court found the home where \r\n  the parties resided and the three surrounding acres had been transmuted into \r\n  marital property that was subject to equitable apportionment.Â  The court awarded \r\n  this property to Mr. Vallentine, but ordered him to pay Mrs. Vallentine $58,330.00 \r\n  for her interest in these assets and two other tracts. [2] Â  Mr. Vallentine retained all \r\n  other real estate held in his name.Â  On appeal, Mr. Vallentine argues the family \r\n  court erred in finding that the home and three acres was marital property subject \r\n  to equitable apportionment.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe family court has wide discretion \r\n  in equitably apportioning marital property, and its decision will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. \r\n  324, 461 S.E.2d 39 (1995).\r\nâ€œAn abuse of discretion occurs \r\n  when the judge is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based \r\n  upon findings of fact, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, \r\n  351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002); see also Stewart v. \r\n  Floyd, 274 S.C. 437, 265 S.E.2d 254 (1980).\r\nIn appeals involving equity actions, including \r\n  those tried in the family court, an appellate court has authority to find facts \r\n  in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford \r\n  v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992).Â  Nevertheless, this \r\n  broad scope of review does not require an appellate court to disregard the findings \r\n  of the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate their credibility.Â  Strout v. Strout, 284 S.C. 429, 327 S.E.2d \r\n  74 (1985).\r\nAlthough inherited property \r\n  is generally considered a nonmarital asset, it can be transmuted into marital \r\n  property under certain conditions:\r\n\r\n[W]hile property acquired by either \r\n  party by inheritance from a party other than the spouse is generally considered \r\n  nonmarital property, nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property \r\n  if:Â  (1) it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable; \r\n  (2) it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of \r\n  the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties \r\n  to make it marital property.\r\n\r\nWidman v. Widman, 348 S.C. \r\n  97, 117, 557 S.E.2d 693, 703 (Ct. App. 2001);Â  see also Hussey v. \r\n  Hussey, 280 S.C. 418, 312 S.E.2d 267 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Transmutation is \r\n  a matter of intent, which must be gleaned from the facts of each case.Â  Widman, \r\n  348 S.C. at 117, 557 S.E.2d at 703-04. \r\nIn this case, the evidence suggests \r\n  the parties utilized the property in support of the marriage and intended to \r\n  make the house and three acres marital property.Â  The parties lived in the house \r\n  during most of their marriage, raised their children in the home, and worked \r\n  together to maintain and improve the property. \r\nThe parties originally \r\n  rented a house; however, when Mr. Vallentine inherited the property in question, \r\n  he proposed that the parties make the inherited property their home.Â  According \r\n  to Mrs. Vallentine, ever since they were engaged, Mr. Vallentine told her that \r\n  one day they would live in the house and raise their children there.Â  \r\nFurther, Mr. Vallentine testified \r\n  that Mrs. Vallentine often complained that she did not feel like the inherited \r\n  property was her own house.Â  He testified, however, that he reassured her that \r\n  it was her home.Â  \r\nConsidering all of the evidence, \r\n  we find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s decision to treat the home \r\n  the parties resided in and the three surrounding acres as marital property and \r\n  to require Mr. Vallentine to pay his wife a sum for her interest.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOSLBY, ANDERSON, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  This case is decided without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  As noted above, we construe the family courtâ€™s order as requiring \r\n    the sum to be paid to Mrs. Vallentine for her interest in not only the home \r\n    and three acres, but for two other tracts of fifteen acres and twenty-two \r\n    acres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-530","title":"State v.

Barnes, of Goose Creek, pro se Appellant.\r\nWalter Bilbro, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Thomas J. Barnes appeals from \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order that affirmed the magistrateâ€™s sale of Barnesâ€™s vehicle \r\n  to satisfy a mechanicâ€™s lien held by Auto Pro of Goose Creek.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nBarnes experienced mechanical problems with his \r\n  1995 Cadillac and took it to Auto Pro.Â  Auto Proâ€™s invoice dated January 8, \r\n  2001 lists various items needing repair at a total cost of $3,747.65.Â  The invoice \r\n  states a fee of $15 per day would be charged if the vehicle was not picked up \r\n  within five days of notice of completion.Â  Barnesâ€™s signature appears underneath \r\n  a preprinted statement on the form indicating that he authorized the repairs.Â  \r\n\r\nAfter Barnes did not pay the repair bill, Auto \r\n  Pro sent Barnes a Notice of Unclaimed Vehicle [2]  advising him that it would apply for a magistrateâ€™s \r\n  sale if he did not pay the amount of repair and storage costs due within thirty \r\n  days.Â  The notice also advised Barnes of his right to seek a hearing within \r\n  thirty days if he wished to contest the matter.Â  \r\nWhen Barnes made no request for a hearing, Auto \r\n  Pro applied to the magistrate for a public sale of the vehicle to satisfy its \r\n  lien for repair and storage costs pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-15-10 (1991). \r\n  [3] Â  \r\nThe magistrate ordered the vehicle to be sold at \r\n  a public auction to satisfy the lien.Â  The public sale took place on June 26, \r\n  2001, but no one appeared on behalf of Barnes.Â  The magistrate ordered the sale \r\n  of the vehicle to Auto Pro for a stated sales price of $25 in satisfaction of \r\n  the lien.Â  \r\nBarnes appealed to the circuit \r\n  court, enumerating eleven issues in his notice of appeal.Â  At the hearing on \r\n  the appeal, Barnesâ€™s attorney argued two issues:Â  (1) whether the magistrateâ€™s \r\n  return was defective, and (2) whether Barnes was entitled to a remand to the \r\n  magistrate because his alleged prior attorney did not receive notice of the \r\n  proceedings in the magistrateâ€™s court and failed to appear.Â  At the end of the \r\n  hearing, the circuit court concluded the return was sufficient and Barnes had \r\n  proper notice of the magistrateâ€™s court proceedings.Â  The circuit court subsequently \r\n  filed a form order affirming the appeal.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBarnes has filed a pro se \r\n  brief listing twenty-three alleged errors in his Statement of Issues for this \r\n  Courtâ€™s consideration.Â  The argument on these issues has been grouped under \r\n  several headings in the body of his brief.\r\nInitially, we note that, as a reviewing \r\n  court sitting in an appellate capacity, we may properly consider only those \r\n  issues that were raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court.Â  See, e.g., \r\n  Harris v. Bennett, 332 S.C. 238, 245, 503 S.E.2d 782, 786 (Ct. App. 1998) \r\n  (â€œAs a general rule, an issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal, \r\n  but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the court below to be preserved \r\n  for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\nI.\r\nBarnesâ€™s first argument to the circuit \r\n  court was that the magistrateâ€™s return was defective.Â  Although Barnes does \r\n  not separately articulate this issue in his brief, we construe his arguments \r\n  broadly because he is pro se and Auto Pro specifically addresses \r\n  the issue in its Respondentâ€™s Brief.Â  Cf. Greer v. McFadden, 295 \r\n  S.C. 14, 366 S.E.2d 263 (Ct. App. 1988) (stating a point raised by a pro \r\n  se appellant would be considered, even though it was not a properly framed \r\n  exception, where it was reasonably clear to the court and the issue was addressed \r\n  by the adverse party).\r\nDuring the circuit court hearing, Barnes \r\n  contended the magistrateâ€™s return was defective because the magistrate did not \r\n  specify all of the evidence that was considered and he did not know what the \r\n  magistrate had reviewed in reaching a decision.Â  \r\nThe circuit court ruled the return was adequate \r\n  in conjunction with the other documentation provided by the magistrate as contained \r\n  in the magistrateâ€™s file that was before it on appeal.Â Â Â  \r\nSection 18-7-60 of the South Carolina Code provides \r\n  a magistrate â€œshall . . . make a return to the appellate court of the testimony, \r\n  proceedings and judgment and file it in the appellate court.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 18-7-60 (1985).Â  If the circuit court believes the return is defective, it \r\n  can direct the magistrate to file an amended return.Â  Id. Â§ 18-7-80.Â  \r\n  When the magistrate has submitted a return, it is left to the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  discretion whether or not to order an amended return.Â  Lynch v. Heyward, \r\n  56 S.C. 562, 35 S.E. 220 (1900) (citing predecessor statutes to section 18-7-80). \r\n\r\nIn this case, the magistrateâ€™s return \r\n  stated in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nAuto Pro of Goose Creek filed a Public Sale on June 11, 2001 \r\n  for storage and repair for the amount of 6382.65.Â  All appropriate steps in \r\n  the documentation submitted to [the] court on behalf of Auto Pro was correct, \r\n  and all procedures were followed legally in obtaining the Magistrateâ€™s Bill \r\n  of Sale.\r\nThe public sale took place on June 26, 2001, and no one appeared \r\n  for or on the behalf of Thomas Barnes.Â  This court received no letter of representation \r\n  from any attorneys representing the defendant, nor was any attached to Auto \r\n  Pro of Goose Creekâ€™s paperwork.\r\nTherefore, considering that all of the procedures were followed \r\n  correctly and by the statute, this court issued a Bill of Sale on 07-03-2001 \r\n  giving title of the 1995 Cadillac, serial number 1G6KF52Y9SU264548, to Auto \r\n  Pro of Goose Creek[.]\r\nThis court handled everything in the utmost judicial manner.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe agree with the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that the \r\n  magistrateâ€™s return was sufficient when considered with all of the documents \r\n  submitted by the magistrate as part of that courtâ€™s file.Â  Among the documents \r\n  constituting the magistrateâ€™s file was a copy of Auto Proâ€™s invoice, a Notice \r\n  of Unclaimed Vehicle, a certified return receipt, the magistrateâ€™s notice of \r\n  sale, and the magistrateâ€™s order of sale.Â  We note this was not a full-blown \r\n  trial in the magistrateâ€™s court; rather, it was a summary proceeding on a mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien under section 29-15-10.Â  Under these circumstances, we find the return \r\n  was adequate.\r\nII.\r\nThe second issue Barnes raised on appeal to the \r\n  circuit court was his contention that he was entitled to a remand to the magistrate \r\n  for a new proceeding with an attorney present.Â  Barnesâ€™s appellate counsel advised \r\n  the circuit court, â€œ[W]eâ€™d ask this Court to remand this back so that Mr. Barnes \r\n  can be represented by counsel . . . on the grounds that, you know, he did think \r\n  he had an attorney present but who didnâ€™t show up.Â  Thatâ€™s being taken care \r\n  of, I believe, in another forum by Mr. Barnes.â€Â  \r\nCounsel for Auto Pro advised the circuit court \r\n  that, after Auto Pro sent a certified letter to Barnes requesting payment and \r\n  informing him that storage charges would be incurred, Auto Proâ€™s owner received \r\n  a telephone call in mid-March 2001 from Kevin Kearse, an attorney, who said \r\n  he was calling just as a friend of Barnes to see what could be done to resolve \r\n  the matter.Â  Auto Proâ€™s owner told Kearse that Barnes could just come down and \r\n  pay the amount due.Â  After Barnes made no payment, Auto Pro sent Barnes a Notice \r\n  of Unclaimed Vehicle on April 13, 2001, informing him that if payment was not \r\n  made, it would request that the vehicle be sold in a magistrateâ€™s sale, but \r\n  that he had thirty days to request a hearing on the matter.Â  Counsel for Auto \r\n  Pro noted a certified receipt signed by Barnes on April 17, 2001 indicated Barnes \r\n  had received this notice.Â  Auto Pro thereafter served notice on Barnes of this \r\n  litigation.Â  Auto Proâ€™s counsel stated he â€œnever received any notice of representation \r\n  from Mr. Kearse.â€Â  Further, no request for a hearing was ever made by Barnes \r\n  or any attorney on behalf of Barnes.Â  \r\nIn response, Barnesâ€™s appellate counsel argued, \r\n  â€œWhether he said he was just calling as a friend or not, Mr. Barnes, I think, \r\n  was justified in relying on -- itâ€™s evident that he had an attorney to speak \r\n  on his behalf.Â  That attorney failed to show up, and thatâ€™s one of the reasons \r\n  we ask that this be remanded.â€Â  \r\nAfter considering the foregoing, the circuit court \r\n  ruled as follows:Â  â€œI understand the problem and the fact that you [Barnes] \r\n  werenâ€™t present.Â  However, there is nothing to suggest that notice wasnâ€™t properly \r\n  given of it, and that you had an opportunity to be present but for whatever \r\n  reason were not.â€Â  \r\nWe find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s ruling \r\n  in this regard.Â  The magistrate stated in his return that the â€œcourt [had] received \r\n  no letter of representation from any attorneys representing [Barnes], nor was \r\n  any attached to Auto Pro of Goose Creekâ€™s paperwork.â€Â  Further, Kearse apparently \r\n  never represented himself to be Barnesâ€™s attorney and did not put in an appearance \r\n  on his behalf, and Barnes presented no documentation to the circuit court that \r\n  Kearse was, in fact, ever his attorney of record.Â  Accordingly, we conclude \r\n  Auto Pro was not required to serve Kearse with notice and Barnes is not entitled \r\n  to a remand for new proceedings.Â  See generally Culbertson v. Clemens, \r\n  322 S.C. 20, 471 S.E.2d 163 (1996) (noting it is important to the parties and \r\n  the court that the correct attorneys are listed as the attorneys of record and \r\n  stating any changes should be noticed to the court under Rule 11(b), SCRCP).Â  \r\n  Moreover, the fact that Barnes believed an attorney would be present does not \r\n  invalidate any notice that was sent to him.Â Â Â  \r\nTo the extent Barnes further argues to this Court \r\n  that he personally was never given notice of the magistrateâ€™s court proceedings, \r\n  we find this issue is not preserved as he did not argue this point to the circuit \r\n  court.Â  Barnes did not dispute at the circuit court hearing that he had received \r\n  notice; rather, he only argued that he was not present at the magistrateâ€™s court \r\n  proceedings because he thought he had an attorney who would be present to represent \r\n  him.Â  See Harris, 322 S.C. at 245, 503 S.E.2d at 786 (stating \r\n  an issue must be raised to and ruled on by the court below to be preserved for \r\n  further review).Â  \r\nIII.\r\nLastly, Barnes raises several arguments concerning \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s conduct in holding a hearing to determine which documents \r\n  it considered in making its ruling.Â Â  \r\nDuring the docketing of the appeal with this Court, \r\n  a dispute arose between the parties regarding which documents could be designated \r\n  for inclusion in the record on appeal.Â  We ordered a remand to the circuit court \r\n  for it to identify which documents it considered because only documents that \r\n  were presented to the circuit court could properly be included in the record \r\n  on appeal under the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules.Â  See Rule 210(c), \r\n  SCACR.\r\nThe circuit court thereafter held a hearing to \r\n  reconstruct which documents were submitted to it for the appeal, during which \r\n  it relied on a transcript of the proceedings, as well as input from the parties.Â  \r\n\r\nAlthough Barnes now contends the circuit court \r\n  erred in conducting a hearing, we find no error in this regard.Â  The court merely \r\n  reconstructed the record since it did not have the original magistrateâ€™s court \r\n  file.Â  The court explained that the original magistrateâ€™s court file could not \r\n  be located, but it had the clerkâ€™s file containing copies of the documents that \r\n  were presented at the appeal.Â  The court stated the magistrateâ€™s court apparently \r\n  had retained the original file and sent the circuit court a copy of its file \r\n  for the appeal.Â  \r\nWhile Barnes stated at the hearing that he objected \r\n  â€œto all of the records that are being spoke about today,â€ he participated in \r\n  the document review without contemporaneously objecting to the manner of the \r\n  proceedings.Â  Further, most of his arguments to the circuit court concerned \r\n  the allegation that his attorney had been ineffective in failing to object to \r\n  the documents at the original hearing before the circuit court.Â  To the extent \r\n  Barnes additionally contends the documents were inappropriately considered by \r\n  the circuit court because they were submitted by counsel for Auto Pro, we find \r\n  the transcript refutes this assertion as the circuit court indicated the documents \r\n  it possessed did not come from the parties, but instead were previously supplied \r\n  by the magistrateâ€™s court.Â  Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.Â  We note the case caption has been amended to name Auto Pro of Goose \r\n    Creek as the first party since it instituted the original action as plaintiff \r\n    against the defendant Barnes.Â  This also corresponds to the caption on the \r\n    notice of appeal to the circuit court.Â  It appears the caption was inadvertently \r\n    reversed during the appeal to the circuit court.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  The typewritten date at the top of the Notice is May 4, 2001, but \r\n    during a hearing in this matter counsel for Auto Pro stated, without contradiction, \r\n    that the Notice was sent on April 13, 2001 and a certified return receipt \r\n    showed Barnes received it on April 17, 2001.Â  There is a certified return \r\n    receipt in the record with a date of either April 11 or April 17 (part of \r\n    the number overlaps a preprinted portion of the form).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  Section 29-15-10 was amended after this case arose in 2001.Â  See \r\n    S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-15-10 (Supp. 2003).Â  The amendment does not affect this \r\n    appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-533","title":"Harrington v.

Goodwin, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  case, Sylvia Harrington appeals the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s \r\n  denial of her Form 15 request for a hearing to determine whether she was entitled \r\n  to further temporary compensation payments.Â  We reverse and remand. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nHarrington worked as a nursing assistant \r\n  to the Hopewell Health Care Center.Â  On November 11, 2001, she sustained a compensable \r\n  injury to her left hand while turning a patient.Â  Although Hopewell accepted \r\n  her claim and paid medical benefits, Harrington missed no time from work as \r\n  a result of this injury.\r\nHarrington re-injured her left hand on \r\n  April 4, 2002, when a patient sat on her hand while she was placing the patient \r\n  into a wheelchair.Â  In addition to medical treatment for this injury, \r\n  Hopewell paid Harrington temporary total disability compensation.Â  It \r\n  appears undisputed that (1) Harrington began receiving temporary total disability \r\n  compensation on April 11, 2002; (2) Harrington was released by her treating \r\n  physician on September 9, 2002, to return to work in a regular and full duty \r\n  capacity; and (3) Hopewell paid no temporary total disability compensation \r\n  after September 25, 2002.\r\nOn January 9, 2003, Harrington, \r\n  through her attorney, filed a Form 15 with the Commission contesting the termination \r\n  of her total disability compensation and requesting a hearing to determine whether \r\n  she was entitled to have these benefits continue.Â  On January 14, 2003, \r\n  the Commission advised Harringtonâ€™s attorney in writing that Harrington was \r\n  not entitled to a hearing.Â  The Commission stated it was denying the request \r\n  because the date Hopewell terminated benefits was â€œoutside the 150 day rule.â€Â  \r\n\r\nOn February 13, 2003, Harrington appealed \r\n  the denial of her hearing request to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court heard \r\n  arguments in the matter on March 11, 2003.Â  On July 14, 2003, the circuit \r\n  court filed an order dismissing Harringtonâ€™s appeal.Â  In support of the dismissal, \r\n  the circuit court determined (1) the Commissionâ€™s letter of January 14, 2003, \r\n  denying Harringtonâ€™s request for a hearing was not a final decision; (2) the \r\n  Commissionâ€™s refusal to schedule a Form 15 hearing did not amount to a deprivation \r\n  of Harringtonâ€™s due process rights; and (3) Harrington failed to exhaust her \r\n  administrative remedies.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Harrington first contends \r\n  the circuit court erred in finding she failed to exhaust her administrative \r\n  remedies.Â  In support of this position, she argues that her use of Form 15 to \r\n  contest the termination of her benefits was proper and therefore an exhaustion \r\n  of her administrative remedies.Â  We agree.\r\nUnder administrative regulation \r\n  67-207, a claimant may request a hearing by filing â€œa Form 15, Form 50, or \r\n  Form 52 with the Commissionâ€™s Judicial Department.â€ \r\n  [2] Â  Here, Harrington had filed a Form 15 with the Commission and indicated, \r\n  through the signature of her attorney in the appropriate space on the form, \r\n  that she did not agree with the termination of temporary compensation and was \r\n  requesting a hearing on the matter.Â  Even though, as the circuit court noted, \r\n  there may have been other means, such as a motion or petition or another form, \r\n  to request a hearing, the applicable administrative regulation requires that \r\n  she avail herself of only one of several enumerated methods.Â  It does not require \r\n  that she resort to the other methods if the first method does not yield the \r\n  desired result. [3] \r\n2.Â  We further agree with \r\n  Harrington that the Commissionâ€™s denial of her Form 15 request violated the \r\n  procedural provisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina Code section \r\n  42-9-260 governs the procedure for suspending or terminating temporary disability \r\n  payments. [4] Â  Under paragraph (A) of this statute, an employer \r\n  may continue temporary disability payments â€œfor up to one hundred fifty days \r\n  from the date the injury . . . is reported without waiver of any grounds for \r\n  good faith denial.â€ [5] Â  Within this one-hundred-fifty-day period, \r\n  the payments may be terminated or suspended immediately under certain conditions. [6] \r\nPursuant to paragraph (F) \r\n  of section 42-9-260, [7]  the Commission has adopted administrative regulation \r\n  67-505, which governs the procedure for terminating or suspending temporary \r\n  disability payments after the one-hundred-fifty-day period has expired.Â  If \r\n  an employer wants to suspend or terminate temporary total disability after one \r\n  hundred fifty days without the claimantâ€™s consent, it must file a Form 21 to \r\n  request a hearing on the matter. [8] \r\nUnder section 42-9-260(C), \r\n  a claimant whose disability payments have been terminated may request a hearing \r\n  within sixty days for reinstatement of these benefits. \r\n  [9] Â Â  This remedy is available whenever the â€œdisability payments have been \r\n  terminated or suspended pursuant to this section.â€ [10] Â  It does not matter whether the employer ceased making payments \r\n  within the first one hundred fifty days after the injury or after that period \r\n  of time has elapsed.Â  \r\nIt appears that the Commission, \r\n  in denying Harringtonâ€™s hearing request, placed undue emphasis on section II \r\n  of Form 15.Â  This section is used solely by the employer to unilaterally terminate \r\n  temporary disability compensation within the first one hundred fifty days after \r\n  receiving notice of the injury.Â  Consistent with section 42-9-260, the time \r\n  limit plainly refers only to the use of section II. \r\n  [11] Â  \r\nHarrington, however, used \r\n  section III of Form 15 and, as expressly stated in this part of the form, the \r\n  signature of her attorney in this section indicated that she did not agree with \r\n  the termination of temporary compensation and was requesting a hearing to determinate \r\n  whether she was entitled to further temporary compensation payments.Â  Nowhere \r\n  on Form 15 is there any prohibition against using section III after one hundred \r\n  fifty days following notice to the employer of a work-related injury. \r\n  [12] Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe letter from the Commission \r\n  denying Harringtonâ€™s request for a hearing was a final order and subject to \r\n  judicial review.Â  We further hold the Commissionâ€™s denial of Harringtonâ€™s Form \r\n  15 request for a hearing on her entitlement to continuation of her temporary \r\n  disability compensation violated the procedures mandated by section 42-9-260. \r\n  [13] Â  We therefore reverse the circuit court and remand this case to the \r\n  Commission for a Form 15 hearing.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and \r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues \r\n    on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  25A S.C.

Tupper, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Richard Fleisig (Husband) \r\n  appeals a ruling of the family court ordering him to pay $57,600 in unpaid alimony \r\n  to Helen Fleisig (Wife).Â  We reverse. \r\n  [1] \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nHusband and Wife married in New Jersey in 1963 and were granted a divorce in \r\n  South Carolina in 1990.Â  The family court granted Wife child support and $400 \r\n  per month rehabilitative alimony for a period of sixty months.Â  Wife appealed, \r\n  and this court modified the alimony to permanent periodic payments of $600 per \r\n  month.Â  Fleisig v. Fleisig, 93-UP-0061 (S.C. Ct. App. Mar. 8, 1993).Â  \r\n\r\nAccording to Wifeâ€™s testimony, Husband moved around a lot after the divorce, \r\n  never paid the ordered alimony, and later quit paying the child support. Â Husband \r\n  claims no notice or knowledge of this courtâ€™s opinion modifying his alimony \r\n  obligation, but asserts he timely paid all of the rehabilitative alimony ordered \r\n  by the family court. Â \r\nShortly after this courtâ€™s opinion, Wife moved to her family home in Mississippi. \r\n  Â She was diagnosed with cancer in 1997 and spent a large portion of the \r\n  next three years hospitalized and in a physically and financially disadvantaged \r\n  condition.Â  Nevertheless, Wife claimed that before, during, and after this ordeal, \r\n  efforts were made to secure payment of the alimony and child support.Â  She contacted \r\n  several attorneys, one of whom agreed to take her case only to later refuse \r\n  it. [2] Â  She contacted legal aid and \r\n  the police several times in both South Carolina and Mississippi. Â When \r\n  Wife learned Husband was residing in Atlanta, she contacted the courthouse there \r\n  only to learn he had moved to New Jersey. Â By this point, her illness \r\n  and financial situation began to hinder her efforts. Â At no time was \r\n  Husband contacted or any claim filed in relation to the non-payment of alimony.Â  \r\n\r\nIn 1999, the South Carolina Department of Social Services (SCDSS), acting on \r\n  behalf of Wife, sought a rule to show cause resulting in the issuance of a bench \r\n  warrant for Husbandâ€™s arrest for a support arrearage of $19,364. Â However, \r\n  pursuant to a 1995 order, SCDSS asserted and the court held the child was emancipated \r\n  and Husband was $7,107 in arrears on child support at the time of emancipation.Â  \r\n  In October 2001, Husband paid this amount in full to the New Jersey family court. \r\n  Â The money eventually went to SCDSS and some payments were made to Wife.Â  \r\n  Neither the New Jersey court nor Wife ever communicated to the issuing South \r\n  Carolina court that the amount had been satisfied. Â In June 2002, Wife \r\n  learned Husband was in Beaufort visiting their son.Â  She contacted the police \r\n  and Husband was arrested on the bench warrant issued for the child support arrearage.Â  \r\n  He was incarcerated for nine days before being granted a hearing on the matter.Â  \r\n\r\nAt the hearing, Husband submitted evidence he had paid his child support arrearage, \r\n  obviously believing child support was the subject of the action.Â  The court \r\n  quickly acknowledged the child support had been paid and was no longer at issue. \r\n  Â Wife, however, wanted to proceed on a claim for unpaid alimony, expressing \r\n  her fear that Husband would never again appear in South Carolina.Â  She claimed \r\n  the contempt order (entered to support the original bench warrant) contained \r\n  language broad enough to cover the alimony as well as child support. [3] Â  Husband contended the case should \r\n  be dismissed and he should be served a separate summons and complaint on the \r\n  issue of alimony. Â Attempting to balance the due process concerns of \r\n  Husband and the significant travel burdens on Wife, the court allowed Wife to \r\n  testify on the non-payment of the alimony at this hearing.Â  The court then gave \r\n  Husband official personal notice of the suit and granted him ten days to respond \r\n  in person or by affidavit. Â Husband submitted an affidavit. \r\nIn its final order, the court found Husbandâ€™s claim that he did not receive \r\n  notice of this courtâ€™s unpublished opinion lacking in credibility and awarded \r\n  Wife $57,600 in unpaid alimony (the total accrued less the $24,000 Husband claimed \r\n  to have paid). Â Husband appeals on the ground that this procedure violated \r\n  certain constitutional rights. \r\nDISCUSSION \r\nHusband claims the procedure followed by the family court \r\n  constitutes a violation of his constitutional right to procedural due process.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nThe Due Process Clause requires â€œnotice reasonably calculated \r\n  under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of \r\n  the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.â€Â  Mullane&nbsp;v. \r\n  Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950); Murdock \r\n  v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 334, 526 S.E.2d 241, 248 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Although \r\n  procedural due process is a flexible doctrine, it mandates that a litigant be \r\n  placed on notice of the issues the court is to consider.Â  Murdock, 338 \r\n  S.C. at 333, 526 S.E.2d at 248.Â  The fundamental purpose of pleadings is to \r\n  fulfill this requirement.Â  See South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank v. Joyner, \r\n  289 S.C. 382, 387, 346 S.E.2d 329, 332 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œIt is elementary that \r\n  the principal purpose of pleadings is to inform the pleaderâ€™s adversary of legal \r\n  and factual positions which he will be required to meet on trial.â€). \r\nHere, Husband was arrested on a bench warrant issued pursuant \r\n  to a civil contempt order.Â  The order was issued following a rule to show cause \r\n  brought on Wifeâ€™s behalf by SCDSS.Â  Both the order and the bench warrant list \r\n  SCDSS as a plaintiff.Â  SCDSS, though granted authority to pursue unpaid child \r\n  support by way of a limited power of attorney, has no authority to pursue unpaid \r\n  alimony.Â  These pleadings were wholly insufficient to give Husband notice he \r\n  would be required to address the issue of unpaid alimony at the hearing.Â  The \r\n  court even acknowledged Husband â€œhad reason to believe what he was here today \r\n  to defend on was on child support.â€Â  \r\nWife argued the language â€œfailure to pay as orderedâ€ contained \r\n  in the civil contempt order broadly covered any support amount Husband might \r\n  have owed.Â  We disagree.Â  The family court is limited by the scope of due process, \r\n  and the rule that its pleadings are to be liberally construed may not be stretched \r\n  so as to permit the court to award relief not contemplated by the pleadings.Â  \r\n  Henry v. Henry, 296 S.C. 285, 287, 372 S.E.2d 104, 106 (Ct. App. 1988); \r\n  see also Murdock, 338 S.C. at 334, 526 S.E.2d at 248.Â  The inclusion \r\n  of SCDSS as a party clearly indicated the action concerned only unpaid child \r\n  support.Â  Wife could have easily prepared a summons, complaint, and rule to \r\n  show cause for unpaid alimony and served Husband while he was in the Beaufort \r\n  County jail.\r\nWe also disagree with the contention that the courtâ€™s grant \r\n  of ten days to Husband to respond via affidavit or appearance cured this due \r\n  process violation.Â  A fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity \r\n  to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.Â  Blanton v. \r\n  Stathos, 351 S.C. 534, 542, 570 S.E.2d 565, 569 (Ct.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Williams was convicted of \r\n  first-degree burglary and simple assault and battery.Â  He argues on appeal that \r\n  the trial judge abused his discretion by (1) not allowing him access to the \r\n  attorney of his choice and (2) admitting portions of a 9-1-1 tape into evidence.Â  \r\n  We affirm. \r\nFACTS  \r\nOn August 25, 2002, Rufus Junior Williams made threatening phone calls to his \r\n  ex-girlfriendâ€”Smith.Â  Later the same night, Smith heard a noise in the bathroom \r\n  of her apartment.Â  After discovering that the screen in her bathroom window \r\n  had been cut open, she called 9-1-1.Â  While on the phone with the 9-1-1 operator, \r\n  Smith heard another noise in the bathroom and observed Williams walking down \r\n  the hallway towards her.Â  Smith dropped the phone and ran outside.Â  Williams \r\n  followed her out of the apartment and hit her on the back of her head, causing \r\n  her to fall to the ground.Â  Once on the ground, Williams repeatedly hit and \r\n  kicked Smith until a crowd drew near.Â  Williams then fled the scene and \r\n  was later arrested. \r\nWilliams was charged with first-degree burglary and assault and battery. A \r\n  public defender was appointed to represent him at trial.Â  After Williams refused \r\n  to cooperate with the public defender, she filed a motion to be relieved.Â  The \r\n  trial court denied the motion, requiring Williams to proceed with the public \r\n  defender. \r\nDuring trial, the State offered the 9-1-1 tape into evidence.Â  Williams objected \r\n  to the tape on grounds that it was hearsay, cumulative, and prejudicial.Â  The \r\n  trial court overruled the objection and allowed portions of the 9-1-1 tape to \r\n  be admitted into evidence. \r\nThe jury found Williams guilty of first-degree \r\n  burglary and assault and battery.Â  Williams was sentenced to twenty years on \r\n  the burglary charge and thirty days on the assault and battery charge. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nÂ I. Â Â Â Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of defense counselâ€™s \r\n  motion to be relieved.Â  â€œA motion to relieve counsel is addressed to the discretion \r\n  of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 385, 548 S.E.2d 210, 211 (2001) (citation \r\n  omitted). \r\nThe Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants a right to counsel.Â  U.S. \r\n  Const. Amend. VI; Stevenson v. State, 337 S.C. 23, 26, 522 S.E.2d 343, \r\n  344 (1999).Â  Defendants also have the right to secure counsel of their own choice.Â  \r\n  Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 (1932).Â  However, the right to counsel \r\n  may be waived.Â  In State v. Jacobs, 271 S.C. 126, 245 S.E.2d 606 (1978), \r\n  our supreme court held that a defendant could waive the right to counsel through \r\n  his conduct.Â  The court noted that:Â \r\n\r\n[W]here a defendant able \r\n  to retain counsel has been advised by the court that he must retain counsel \r\n  by a certain reasonable time, and where there is no showing why he has not retained \r\n  counsel within that time, the court may treat his failure to provide for his \r\n  own defense as a waiver of his right to counsel and require such defendant to \r\n  proceed to trial without an attorney. \r\n\r\nId. at 128, 245 S.E.2d \r\n  at 607-608 (quoting United States v. Arlen, 252 F.2d 491 (2d Cir. 1958)).Â  \r\n  In State v. Jacobs, the Appellant never expressly waived his right to \r\n  counsel.Â  However, the trial court found that the Appellant was on several occasions \r\n  urged to retain counsel, a phone was made available to him, and additional time \r\n  had been given him to make arrangements.Â  Id. at 128, 245 S.E.2d at 608.Â  \r\n  On the day of trial, counsel was not present and Appellant did not name an attorney \r\n  or indicate when counsel would be available.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, the court \r\n  held that Appellant had waived his right to counsel by his conduct. Id. \r\n \r\n\r\nIn this case, also through his conduct, Williams waived the right to counsel \r\n  of his choice.Â  A public defender was appointed on August 29, 2002 to represent \r\n  him at trial; however, Williams was uncooperative with the public defender. \r\n  He failed to show up for office appointments and refused to discuss his case \r\n  or offer any defense.Â  One month before trial was to begin, Judge Kittredge \r\n  warned Williams that his case would soon be called for trial and that if he \r\n  wanted to hire a private attorney, he should do so quickly.Â  On the day of trial, \r\n  Williams alleged he had followed this advice and hired a private attorney.Â  \r\n  However, Williams first talked to the attorney earlier that same morning and \r\n  failed to inform the attorney his case was on the trial docket for that day. \r\n\r\nBecause Williams refused to cooperate with the public defender and failed to \r\n  hire a private attorney after the court urged him to do so, he waived the right \r\n  to have the counsel of his choice. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse \r\n  its discretion by requiring Williams to proceed to trial with the public defender. \r\n\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  The trial court did not err in allowing a portion of the Smithâ€™s \r\n  9-1-1 tape to be admitted into evidence.Â  â€œThe admissibility of evidence is \r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial judge.â€Â  State v. Mansfield, \r\n  343 S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing State v. Patterson, \r\n  337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  â€œAccordingly, evidentiary rulings \r\n  of the trial court will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion \r\n  or the commission of legal error which results in prejudice to the defendant.â€Â  \r\n  Id.  \r\nThe 9-1-1 tape contained Smithâ€™s conversation with 9-1-1 dispatchers as the \r\n  incident was occurring.Â  Williams argues the tape was highly prejudicial and \r\n  should not have been admitted into evidence.Â  The trial court found that the \r\n  tapeâ€™s probative value outweighed any danger of unfair prejudice.Â  It noted \r\n  that the tape had significant probative value for two reasons.Â  First, the tape \r\n  provided a real-time account of the entering and was relevant to the issue of \r\n  whether or not Williams had the intent to commit a crime at the time of entering.Â  \r\n  Secondly, the trial court noted that the State was trying to prove assault and \r\n  battery. An important element of assault is that the victim is placed in fear \r\n  by the attacker. Thus, screaming on the tape was relevant to show the victimâ€™s \r\n  fear.Â  Therefore, the trial court found the tape had significant probative value. \r\n\r\nBecause we feel the trial court clearly set forth the probative value of the \r\n  tape and made a conscious effort to minimize any prejudicial effect of the tape \r\n  might have, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting \r\n  the tape into evidence. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing reasons, Williamsâ€™ convictions \r\n  and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\nÂ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-537","title":"Reliford v.

Lindemann, of Columbia; and David Austin Brown, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Ephrain Reliford, Jr. appeals a circuit court order granting \r\n  summary judgment to Mitsubishi Motors Credit of America, Inc.Â  On appeal, Reliford \r\n  argues the circuit court erred in denying his Constitutional right to a jury \r\n  trial by granting summary judgment to Mitsubishi and erred in ruling that his \r\n  claims were barred by the statute of limitations.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn May 1993, Reliford purchased an automobile financed by Mitsubishi.Â  He was \r\n  arrested for murder on January 7, 1994 and the Aiken County Sheriffâ€™s Department \r\n  seized the car as evidence a few days later.\r\nReliford failed to make loan payments to Mitsubishi.Â  Consequently, Mitsubishi \r\n  instituted a claim and delivery action against Reliford.Â  On May 13, 1994, Mitsubishi \r\n  served him with the summons and complaint.Â  Reliford was incarcerated at that \r\n  time.Â  He did not respond to the claim and delivery action.Â  The Sheriffâ€™s Department \r\n  released the car to Mitsubishi on May 25, 1994.Â  Mitsubishi and the Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Department entered a written stipulation through which they agreed to dismiss \r\n  the claim and delivery action against Reliford without prejudice.\r\nIn November 2002, Reliford brought the present action alleging \r\n  â€œstatute of negligence, bailment, wrongful taking, nuisance, and trover and \r\n  conversionâ€ against Mitsubishi.Â  Mitsubishi answered, asserting defenses including \r\n  the statute of limitations.\r\nReliford made a motion for summary judgment in \r\n  January 2003.Â  A hearing was held on the motion, during which the circuit court \r\n  denied Relifordâ€™s motion but sua sponte granted summary judgment to Mitsubishi.Â  \r\n\r\nReliford made a â€œMotion to Alter or Amendâ€ pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP. Before \r\n  the circuit court ruled on his order, Reliford filed a notice of appeal.Â  In \r\n  June 2003, the circuit court subsequently issued an order partially granting \r\n  and denying Relifordâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion.Â  This court later found that the circuit \r\n  court order was entered â€œwithout jurisdiction.â€\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS  \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Statute of Limitations\r\nThe gravamen of Relifordâ€™s appeal is his contention that the circuit court \r\n  erred in finding that his action was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nReliford concedes that the underlying cause of action in the present case is \r\n  subject to a three-year statute of limitations.Â  At the time this cause of action \r\n  arose, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-40 (1976) tolled the three-year statute of limitations \r\n  for â€œpersons under disability.â€Â  Subsection (3) of this statute provided that \r\n  such â€œpersons under disabilityâ€ included those â€œ[i]mprisoned on a criminal or \r\n  civil charge or in execution under the sentence of a sentence of a criminal \r\n  court for a less term than his natural life â€¦.â€ \r\n  [1] Â  Id.Â  However, â€œ[t]he time of such disability is not part of \r\n  the time limited for the commencement of the action, except the period within \r\n  which the action must be brought cannot be extended by: (1) [m]ore than five \r\n  years by any such disability, except infancy; nor (2) [i]n any case longer than \r\n  one year after the disability ceases.â€Â  Id.\r\nHere, Relifordâ€™s causes of action undisputedly arose \r\n  in May of 1994 when he was served with Mitsubishiâ€™s claim and delivery action. \r\n  [2] Â  However, Reliford maintains pursuant to the â€œdiscovery ruleâ€ that \r\n  the statute of limitations did not begin running until well after May 1994, \r\n  such that this action would be timely.Â  We find this argument unavailing.Â  Reliford \r\n  was clearly on notice not later than May of 1994 when he admittedly received \r\n  the summons and complaint in the claim and delivery action in which Mitsubishi \r\n  sought â€œimmediate seizure and permanent possession ofâ€ Relifordâ€™s car.Â  This \r\n  knowledge clearly provided reasonable notice to Reliford that possession of \r\n  his car, and possibly its contents, would be transferred to Mitsubishi.Â  From \r\n  an objective standpoint, if Mitsubishiâ€™s possession of the car were wrongful, \r\n  a reasonable person would have been on notice of a potential claim in May of \r\n  1994.Â  Thus, we find that, at the latest, Relifordâ€™s statute of limitations \r\n  began running in May of 1994.Â  See Young v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 719, 511 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1999) (Finding that \r\n  under the discovery rule, whether the particular plaintiff actually knew he \r\n  had a claim is not the test; rather, courts must objectively determine whether \r\n  the circumstances of the case would put a person of common knowledge and experience \r\n  on notice that some right of his has been invaded, or that some claim against \r\n  another party might exist).Â  Even allowing the maximum five-year period of tolling \r\n  allowed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-40 (1976), followed by the three-year statute \r\n  of limitations, we find that the time Reliford had to bring the present action \r\n  expired on May 13, 2002.Â  Because he did not bring the present action until \r\n  November 2002, we find as a matter of law that the applicable statute of limitations \r\n  barred his action.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Constitutional Violation\r\nReliford next argues that the circuit court erred in denying his Constitutional \r\n  right to a jury trial by sua sponte granting summary judgment to Mitsubishi.Â  \r\n  However, the issue of Relifordâ€™s Constitutional rights was not raised to the \r\n  circuit court in the summary judgment hearing nor was it later raised in Relifordâ€™s \r\n  â€œMotion to Alter or Amendâ€ made pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP. \r\n  [3] Â  Thus, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See \r\n  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 380, 580 S.E.2d 785, 795 (Ct. App. 2003) \r\n  (â€œArguments not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved \r\n  for appellate reviewâ€);Â  State v. Varvil, 338 S.C. 335, 339, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  248, 250 (Ct. App. 2000) (â€œConstitutional arguments are no exception to the \r\n  rule, and if not raised to the trial court are deemed waived on appealâ€).Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Denial of Motion for Summary Judgment\r\nLast, Reliford argues that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for \r\n  summary judgment.Â  However, it is well settled law in South Carolina that â€œthe \r\n  denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable, even after final \r\n  judgment.â€Â  Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 168, \r\n  580 S.E.2d 440, 444 (2003).Â  Accordingly, we find the issue of the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  alleged error in denying Relifordâ€™s summary judgment motion is not appealable.Â  \r\n  In any event, Mitsubishiâ€™s entitlement to summary judgment renders moot the \r\n  challenge to the denial of Relifordâ€™s motion for summary judgment.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Â Â Â Â Â Â  A 1996 amendment \r\n    removed subsection (3) from S.C.

Murrell Smith, Jr., both of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this domestic action brought \r\n  by Larry Hathcock (Husband) against ex-wife Betty Hathcock (Wife), Husband argues \r\n  the family court erred by declining to terminate alimony and refusing to award \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFacts  \r\nIn September 1996, a York County family court awarded Betty Hathcock a divorce \r\n  from her husband of twenty-eight years, Larry Hathcock, on the ground of adultery.Â  \r\n  The divorce decree required Husband to pay Wife $400.00 per month in alimony.Â Â  \r\n  In 1998, approximately two years after the divorce, Wife began a romantic relationship \r\n  with Mancer Flatten that included cohabitation.Â  Flatten resided in Wifeâ€™s house, \r\n  yet his employment as a contractor frequently required him to work out of town \r\n  and often he would stay in the home only on weekends.Â  The romantic relationship \r\n  lasted for two years.Â  Thereafter, including the two years leading up to the \r\n  commencement of this trial, Flatten lived in the house in a platonic capacity, \r\n  sleeping sometimes on the couch and sometimes in the bedroom with Wife.Â  \r\nFlatten contributed to the economic state of the household.Â  He paid Wife a \r\n  monthly rent of $250.00.Â  He occasionally bought groceries and sometimes paid \r\n  for dinner when the two dined together.Â  He also finished building a screened-in \r\n  porch that he began before he lived with Wife and provided materials and worked \r\n  on constructing a swimming pool deck at the home.Â  In 2001, Flatten bought land \r\n  and planned to buy a trailer to live in on the property.Â  Flatten moved out \r\n  of Wifeâ€™s home in July 2002; however, his driverâ€™s license lists his address \r\n  as Wifeâ€™s residence and he continues to receive mail at the location.\r\nHusband brought an action seeking to modify the 1996 divorce order requesting \r\n  termination of alimony and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wife asserted a general denial \r\n  defense and counterclaimed for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family court concluded \r\n  applicable law did not afford Husband modification of the prior divorce order \r\n  and denied both partiesâ€™ attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nQuestions concerning alimony \r\n  rest within the sound discretion of the family court judge whose conclusion \r\n  will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion.Â  Bryson v. \r\n  Bryson, 347 S.C. 221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAn abuse \r\n  of discretion occurs when the decision is controlled by some error of law or \r\n  is based on findings of fact that are without evidentiary support.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 224, 553 S.E.2d at 495.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSISÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTermination of Alimony \r\n   \r\nHusband argues the trial court \r\n  erred in finding Wifeâ€™s relationship with Flatten was not â€œtantamount to marriage,â€ \r\n  which would entitle him to termination of alimony responsibility.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina common law in \r\n  effect at the time of the filing of this action governs this case. \r\n  [2] Â  Changed conditions may warrant modification or termination of alimony.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1985).Â  A court may terminate alimony when a supported \r\n  ex-spouse is involved in a relationship tantamount to marriage.Â  Bryson, \r\n  347 S.C. at 226, 553 S.E.2d at 496.Â  Husband contends that Wife had a relationship \r\n  with Flatten tantamount to marriage, evidenced by the initial sexual relationship, \r\n  the fact that Flatten resided at the house for four years, and his assistance \r\n  with various household improvements.Â  \r\nWhen our courts have found changed \r\n  circumstances based on a relationship tantamount to marriage, the supported \r\n  ex-spouse has been involved in a relationship in which the parties have economically \r\n  relied upon one another.Â  Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 517, 586 S.E.2d \r\n  136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003);Â  See Bryson, 347 S.C at 225, 553 S.E.2d \r\n  at 496 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding that relationship was tantamount to marriage \r\n  where supported ex-spouse had lived together for twelve years, had moved to \r\n  Florida together, and continued to engage in sexual relations throughout their \r\n  involvement).Â  No evidence exists from the record indicating that such reliance \r\n  existed in this case.Â  Flattenâ€™s economic contributions to the household were \r\n  minimal and there is no evidence that Wife used her alimony to support Flatten \r\n  in any way.Â  Flatten paid Wife rent for the privilege of residing on the premises, \r\n  and even through the duration of the sexual relationship, Flatten retained the \r\n  status of tenant.Â  Moreover, the evidence suggests that Flatten spent a majority \r\n  of nights out of town tending to his business duties.\r\nHusband argues on appeal that \r\n  the lower court erred in its analysis and that this error affords him a reduction \r\n  or termination of alimony.Â  Husbandâ€™s exclusive argument on appeal is that the \r\n  relationship was tantamount to marriage.Â  When a court determines such a relationship \r\n  exists, the only result can be termination rather than reduction of alimony.Â  \r\n  In Bryson, this court overruled the family courtâ€™s decision reducing \r\n  alimony rather than terminating it where the court found a relationship tantamount \r\n  to marriage.Â  Bryson, 347 S.C. 221, 553 S.E.2d 493.Â  Husbandâ€™s complaint \r\n  and the testimony reveal that Husband specifically requested termination of \r\n  alimony at trial, and the only mention of modification lies in the court order, \r\n  which concluded the law did not require it to modify or terminate Husbandâ€™s \r\n  obligation.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court \r\n  correctly found the relationship between Wife and Flatten was not tantamount \r\n  to marriage, and therefore correctly denied Husband termination of alimony. \r\n  Â \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAttorneyâ€™s Fees \r\n   \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in denying \r\n  his request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family courtâ€™s decision whether to award attorney \r\n  fees is a discretionary matter and will not be overturned absent an abuse of \r\n  discretion. Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, \r\n  903 (1988).Â  We find no abuse of that discretion in the family courtâ€™s refusal \r\n  to grant attorney fees to Husband. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  In 2002, the South Carolina General \r\n    Assembly amended Section 20-3-150 of the South Carolina Code, changing the \r\n    conditions under which the court may modify or terminate alimony, including \r\n    cohabitation.Â  The 2002 amendments became effective in June 18, 2002 after \r\n    the filing of this action, thus the family court correctly disregarded the \r\n    2002 amendments in its analysis. \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-539","title":"Murray v.

Reiter, II, of Sumter, for Appellant.\r\nG. Murrell Smith, Jr., of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this domestic action brought \r\n  by James Murray (Husband) against ex-wife Wanda Murray (Wife), Husband challenges \r\n  the family courtâ€™s refusal to terminate military retirement benefit payments \r\n  to Wife pursuant to a 1990 divorce degree.Â  Husband also challenges the award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFacts Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nJames and Wanda Murray divorced in 1990 after fourteen \r\n  years of marriage.Â  Both parties served in the military and the divorce decree \r\n  awarded each 30 percent of the otherâ€™s military retirement benefits based on \r\n  the partiesâ€™ rank and length of service at the time of the 1990 decree.Â  Applying \r\n  the 30 percent figure, the court concluded that Husband should pay Wife $318.33 \r\n  per month, plus all cost of living raises. The court also determined the funds \r\n  paid to Wife were to be deducted from Husbands gross, non-disability retirement \r\n  benefits.Â  Husband retired from the United States Air Force in 1999 and the \r\n  Veteranâ€™s Administration found Husband to be 60 percent disabled.Â  At the time \r\n  of this action, Husband received monthly payments of $1,682.00 for military \r\n  retirement and $864.00 in disability payments. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nAfter Husband retired, Wife requested payment in accordance \r\n  with the 1990 divorce decree and Husband directed her to seek payment from the \r\n  Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS).Â  DFAS declined to recognize \r\n  the divorce decree because it did not include a specific formula required by \r\n  DFAS to calculate the pay due to Wife.Â  Wife filed a complaint for payment and, \r\n  after a hearing, the family court found for the Wife.Â  Husband filed a motion \r\n  to reconsider, which the court denied.Â  This appeal follows.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn appeals from the \r\n  family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with \r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, \r\n  322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, \r\n  does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson \r\n  v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSISÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMilitary Retirement Benefits \r\n   \r\nHusband argues the family court \r\n  erred in finding Wife is still entitled to receive a portion of the Husbandâ€™s \r\n  military retirement benefits.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nCourts do not have the authority \r\n  to treat disability benefits as property divisible upon divorce.Â  Mansell \r\n  v. Mansell, 490 U.S. 581 (1989).Â  Husband contends that because his retirement \r\n  benefits were reduced when he waived his retirement pay to receive disability \r\n  benefits, Wife should bear the burden of the loss, or alternatively, that the \r\n  loss should be borne equally.Â  However, there is no evidence that at the time \r\n  of the divorce the court factored in whether Husband was entitled to receive \r\n  any disability benefits in lieu of retirement pay.Â  The court made its calculation \r\n  based solely on the amount Husband was then entitled to draw, which represented \r\n  what the Husband owed to Wife as a portion of the marital property.Â Â  \r\nMilitary retirement benefits \r\n  accrued during the marriage are subject to equitable division.Â  Tiffault \r\n  v. Tiffault, 303 S.C. 391, 401 S.E.2d 157 (1991).Â  Any retirement pay accrued \r\n  after the divorce, however, would constitute non-marital property.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the divorce decree determined the fixed sum that Husband owed Wife for the time \r\n  the two spent as husband and wife.Â  The percentage was to be taken from the \r\n  amount of retirement Husband had accrued to that point, leaving Wife with a \r\n  precise figure, explicitly excluding any disability pay from the total sum.Â  \r\n\r\nThe divorce decree clearly stated \r\n  that Wife was entitled to $1,061.00, plus cost of living increases, and further \r\n  indicated that if the militaryâ€™s retirement plan administrator failed to pay \r\n  Wife, the Husband should pay from his personal assets.Â  Husband voluntarily \r\n  waived his right to a portion of his earned retirement benefits to receive disability \r\n  pay and his action should not injure Wife, who had a right to the retirement \r\n  pay accrued during the marriage.Â  See Price v. Price, 325 S.C. \r\n  379, 480 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding husband may not subvert support \r\n  obligations to his former wife by waiving military retirement pay in favor of \r\n  disability benefits).Â  Thus, the trial court properly interpreted the divorce \r\n  decree awarding Wife a specific sum to be paid from Husbandâ€™s non-disability \r\n  retirement benefits.Â Â  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAttorneyâ€™s Fees \r\n   \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in awarding \r\n  Wife attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees will not be overturned \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 99, 561 \r\n  S.E.2d 610, 617 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When determining the amount of fees to award, \r\n  the court must consider several factors including the beneficial results obtained \r\n  and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, \r\n  304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  In this case, the family court \r\n  detailed the rationale for its award in its final order, addressing the applicable \r\n  Glasscock factors.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in its award of attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Veterans receiving retirement pay may also apply for disability benefits \r\n    for a disability obtained from military service.Â  However, â€œ[i]n order to \r\n    prevent double dipping, a military retiree may receive disability benefits \r\n    only to the extent that he waives a corresponding amount of his military retirement \r\n    pay.â€Â  Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U.S. 581, 583 (1989).Â  Military retirees \r\n    often prefer to waive retirement pay in favor of disability benefits because \r\n    disability benefits are exempt from taxation.Â  Id. at 583.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-540","title":"S.C.

Rauch Wise, both of Greenwood, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In April 2003 the family court \r\n  issued a civil contempt order against Michael Martin for failure to pay child \r\n  support under a November 18, 1986 California support order.Â  Martin filed a \r\n  motion for emergency temporary relief, claiming that an order issued in South \r\n  Carolina on May 8, 1990 modified the California order.Â  Upon reconsideration, \r\n  the judge vacated his 2003 order after determining the 1990 order terminated \r\n  Martinâ€™s obligations under the California order. We reverse and remand.  \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nFACTS \r\nDebra Little and Michael \r\n  Martinâ€™s marriage, which began in 1978, produced two children, Trenton and Lisa.Â  \r\n  After a period of separation, the couple divorced in 1986 in Siskiyou County, \r\n  California.Â  The court granted custody of Lisa to Little and custody of Trenton \r\n  to Martin.Â  On November 18, 1986, the Siskiyou County Family Support Division \r\n  ordered Martin to pay $303 per month in child support for Lisa.\r\nOn February 27, 1989, the \r\n  Siskiyou County District Attorney sent a request to the South Carolina Department \r\n  of Social Services (SCDSS) to enforce the November 18, 1986 order pursuant to \r\n  the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act \r\n  [2]  (URESA).Â  Siskiyou County and Little also sought $11,831.00 \r\n  for medical coverage and arrearage of past due support payments.Â  SCDSS served \r\n  Martin with the URESA request, which he answered on April 5, 1990.Â  \r\nPrior to a hearing on April \r\n  25, 1990, the county and Little entered into an agreement with Martin to reduce \r\n  Martinâ€™s child support payments. The agreement was then incorporated into an \r\n  order issued on May 8, 1990.Â  Per the order, Martin was to pay $30.00 per week \r\n  in child support and $10.00 per week toward the arrearage, which was to be determined \r\n  within 30 days of the date of the order.Â  The parties did not appeal the order \r\n  nor did the court determine the arrearage. \r\nAt some point after May \r\n  8, 1990, the Greenwood County Clerk of Court issued two rules to show cause \r\n  for failure to pay child support.Â  As a result, on April 23, 2003, nearly thirteen \r\n  years later, Martin appeared pro se to defend SCDSSâ€™s allegations \r\n  that he was in willful contempt of Californiaâ€™s 1986 child support order.Â  During \r\n  the hearing, the SCDSS attorney failed to bring the May 8, 1990 South Carolina \r\n  order to the courtâ€™s attention.Â  As a result, the judge issued an order enforcing \r\n  the November 18, 1986 California order.Â  \r\nMartin filed a motion for \r\n  emergency temporary relief and a hearing was held on June 25, 2003.Â  On October \r\n  17, 2003, the judge issued an order vacating his previous order and enforcing \r\n  the May 8, 1990 order, stating that the court would not have issued the April \r\n  23, 2003 order had it known about the May 8, 1990 order. [3] Â  The order also stated that the May 8, 1990 \r\n  order was the â€œfinal order in this matter determining [Martinâ€™s] child support \r\n  obligations, and [the May 8, 1990] final order ended [Martinâ€™s] prospective \r\n  California child support obligations.â€Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from a family court order, the appellate \r\n  court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with their own view of the \r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Roberson v. Roberson, 359 S.C. 384, 388, 597 S.E.2d 840, 842 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n  The appellate court should not, however, disregard the findings of the trial \r\n  judge who observed the witness and was better able to assess their credibility. \r\n  Â Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 523, 599 S.E.2d 114, 119 (2004).Â  Cases \r\n  involving child support are ordinarily left to the discretion of the family \r\n  court and will only be disturbed on appeal upon a showing of abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003).Â  Abuse of discretion arises when the court is controlled by an error \r\n  of law or the order lacks evidentiary support.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSCDSS argues that the trial \r\n  court erred in finding the May 8, 1990 South Carolina support order was final \r\n  and terminated Martinâ€™s prospective California child support obligations.Â  We \r\n  agree.Â Â  \r\nThe parties agree that the \r\n  applicable law governing this case is URESA, formerly found in sections 20-7-960 \r\n  to 1170 of South Carolina Code (1985). [4] Â  Section 20-7-933 of the South \r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2003) grants the family court authority to enforce orders \r\n  regarding child support, including cases in which the family court has jurisdiction \r\n  based on URESA.Â  Section 20-7-933 also provides that the family court has â€œthe \r\n  right to modify any such decree, judgment, or order for child support as the \r\n  court considers necessary upon a showing of changed circumstances.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-933 (Supp. 2003).Â  Therefore, the South Carolina family court had \r\n  authority to enforce and modify the 1986 California support order when SCDSS \r\n  sought to enforce the California order on behalf of Siskiyou County and Little.Â  \r\n\r\nSection 20-7-1110, however, \r\n  provides that â€œ[a] support order made by a court of this State . . . does not \r\n  nullify and is not nullified by a support order made by a court of this State \r\n  pursuant to any other law or by a support order made by a court of any other \r\n  state . . . unless otherwise specifically provided by the court.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-1110 (1985).Â  â€œSection 20-7-1110 clearly provides that a support \r\n  order made by a court of this State is not nullified by a support order made \r\n  by a court of another state unless specifically provided by the court.â€Â  South \r\n  Carolina Depâ€™t of Social Services v. Hamlett, 330 S.C. 321, 325, 498 S.E.2d \r\n  888, 890 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Thus, in Hamlett, we held that a South Carolina \r\n  child support order continued as an â€œindependently enforceable order regardless \r\n  of its registration and modification in a foreign state unless specifically \r\n  nullified by the court pursuant to section 20-7-1110.â€Â  Id. at 326, 498 \r\n  S.E.2d at 890-91.\r\nMore recently, in SCDSS/Child \r\n  Support Enforcement v. Carswell, 359 S.C. 424, 597 S.E.2d 859 (Ct. App. \r\n  2004), SCDSS sought registration and enforcement of a Washington child support \r\n  order in South Carolina under URESA. [5] Â  In Carswell, as in this \r\n  case, the parties had entered into an agreement to reduce the amount the obligor \r\n  was required to pay, which was then incorporated into one of three South Carolina \r\n  family court orders.Â  Id. at 427, 597 S.E.2d at 860. Upon examination \r\n  of the original order and the subsequent South Carolina orders, we held that \r\n  because the subsequent South Carolina orders merely recognized the Washington \r\n  order, the orders did not â€œrise to the level of a nullification of the Washington \r\n  order.â€Â  Id. at 430, 597 S.E.2d at 861.Â  Therefore, the original Washington \r\n  order remained valid and independently enforceable in South Carolina.Â  Id. \r\n \r\n\r\nIn this case, the May 8, \r\n  1990 order does not provide any indication that it was intended to nullify the \r\n  California order.Â  The 1990 order does not specifically mention the 1986 order, \r\n  nor does it specify it was intended to nullify the 1986 order.Â  Therefore, the \r\n  May 8, 1990 order did not nullify the 1986 California order and the California \r\n  order remains independently enforceable in South Carolina.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nSTILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Formerly found in S.C.

Hayes, III, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-541\r\nHeard October 12, 2004 â€“ Filed October \r\n  26, 2004\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Deborah R. J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  Thomas E. Pope, of York, for Appellant.\r\nChristopher A. Wellborn, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Jonathan Bass was arrested \r\n  for driving under the influence.Â  At a pre-trial hearing, the trial judge suppressed \r\n  the results of a breath analysis test administered to Bass following his arrest.Â  \r\n  The State appeals this evidentiary exclusion, arguing the trial judge erred \r\n  in finding the testâ€™s suppression was statutorily mandated.Â  We reverse and \r\n  remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts of this case are undisputed.Â  \r\n  In August 2001, Jonathan Bass was arrested for driving under the influence.Â  \r\n  Once at the police station, the arresting officer advised Bass of his implied \r\n  consent rights and offered him a breath test to gauge his breath alcohol concentration.Â  \r\n  During the statutorily mandated videotaped pre-test waiting period, Bass requested \r\n  to speak to his attorney.Â  Since there was no telephone in the breath analysis \r\n  room, the arresting officer escorted Bass out of the room and off camera to \r\n  make the phone call.Â  Bass and the officer returned to the testing room approximately \r\n  eleven minutes later.Â  The officer testified he remained in close proximity \r\n  to Bass the entire time they were off camera and at no time did Bass place a \r\n  foreign substance or object into his mouth.Â  At the conclusion of the twenty-minute \r\n  period (including the time both were absent from the room and off camera), the \r\n  breath analysis test was conducted on video by the arresting officer.Â Â  Bass \r\n  registered a .23 breath alcohol concentration.Â Â  \r\nAt a pre-trial hearing, Bass moved to \r\n  suppress the results of the breath analysis test.Â  Finding that the arresting \r\n  officer did not follow the statutory requirements applicable to administering \r\n  the test, specifically that the test subjectâ€™s conduct during the twenty-minute \r\n  waiting period be videotaped, the trial judge found the test results inadmissible.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe trial judge has considerable discretion \r\n  in ruling on the admissibility of evidence.Â  State v. Sheldon, 344 S.C. \r\n  340, 342, 543 S.E.2d 585, 585-86 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  On appeal, the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling will not be disturbed absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion amounting \r\n  to an error of law.Â  Id.; see alsoÂ  State v. Smicklevich, \r\n  268 S.C. 411, 415, 234 S.E.2d 230, 232 (1977).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nThe State contends South Carolina's \r\n  implied consent statute does not mandate automatic exclusion of a breath test's \r\n  results when the pre-test waiting period is not videotaped in its entirety.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nBy operating a motor vehicle in this state, \r\n  one automatically consents to searches of his breath, blood, and urine for the \r\n  presence of alcohol or drugs if arrested for an offense arising from the alleged \r\n  influence of such while driving.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  This â€œimplied consentâ€ to be searched is circumscribed by several restrictions \r\n  and safeguards incorporated into the framework of the implied consent statute.Â  \r\n  For instance, one may still refuse to take the tests at the sufferance of a \r\n  penalty (suspension of his driving privileges for at least ninety days), and \r\n  must be advised of this right of refusal before any test is given.Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a)(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  One may also request an additional independent \r\n  test performed by a person of his own choosing and has a right to â€œaffirmative \r\n  assistanceâ€ from the police in obtaining such a test.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  The authorities must also offer a person suspected of driving \r\n  under the influence the least intrusive of the three tests, a breath analysis \r\n  test, before further tests are ordered (unless a breath test is medically unfeasible \r\n  or there is reasonable grounds to suspect drug use other than alcohol).Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nIn addition to these statutory rights, \r\n  the implied consent statute requires that a twenty-minute pre-test waiting period \r\n  be videotaped â€œpursuant to Section 56-5-2953(A)(2)(d)â€ when the arresting officer \r\n  is administering a breath test.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  Section 56-5-2953(A)(2) reads: \r\n\r\n[t]he videotaping at the breath site: . . . (d) must . . . \r\n  include the personâ€™s conduct during the required twenty-minute pre-test waiting \r\n  period, unless the officer submits a sworn affidavit certifying that it was \r\n  physically impossible to videotape this waiting period.Â  However, if the \r\n  arresting officer administers the breath test, the personâ€™s conduct during the \r\n  twenty-minute pre-test waiting period must be videotaped.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(A)(2) (Supp. 2003) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  Because the arresting officer performed the breath test on Bass, the \r\n  videotaping of the pre-test waiting period was clearly required by the implied \r\n  consent statute in the case at bar.Â  By failing to videotape the entire twenty \r\n  minutes, the officer violated a mandate of the implied consent statute.Â Â Â  \r\nHaving concluded that the officerâ€™s administration \r\n  of the breath test violated section 56-5-2950, we next consider whether this \r\n  violation automatically renders the test results inadmissible.Â  We conclude \r\n  that it does not.\r\nThe failure of law enforcement to strictly \r\n  adhere to certain testing guidelines found in the implied consent statute often \r\n  results in the suppression of the test results at trial.Â  See e.g. \r\n  State v. Mullins, 331 S.C. 501, 503, 489 S.E.2d 923, 924 (1997); State \r\n  v. Pipkin, 294 S.C. 336, 338, 364 S.E.2d 464, 465 (1988); State v. Kimbrell, \r\n  326 S.C. 344, 349, 481 S.E.2d 456, 459 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  However, a violation \r\n  of the implied consent statute does not make suppression of the test results \r\n  a foregone conclusion.Â  See State v. Hunley, 349 S.C. 1, 6, 562 \r\n  S.E.2d 472, 474 (2002) (finding the trial court erred in automatically suppressing \r\n  a breath testâ€™s results when no prejudice to the defendant was shown as a result \r\n  of the implied consent statuteâ€™s violation).Â  It is well established that â€œexclusion \r\n  of evidence should be limited to violations of constitutional rights and not \r\n  to statutory violations, at least where the appellant cannot demonstrate prejudice \r\n  at trial resulting from the failure to follow statutory procedure.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Chandler, 267 S.C. 138, 143, 226 S.E.2d 553, 555 (1976).Â  \r\nIn the case before us, the trial court \r\n  found that the failure to videotape the entire twenty-minute waiting period \r\n  automatically mandated the suppression of the breath test.Â  The trial court \r\n  reached this conclusion without any findings on whether Bass was prejudiced \r\n  by the statutory violation.Â  When a trial court suppresses evidence based on \r\n  a statutory violation without making any findings on whether the violation prejudiced \r\n  the moving party, it has made an error of law. The proper action for this court, \r\n  therefore, is to reverse the suppression order and remand to the trial court \r\n  for the purpose of making such findings.Â  Sheldon, 344 S.C. at 343-44, \r\n  543 S.E.2d at 586.\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and WILLIAMS, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-542","title":"Geathers v. 3V, Inc.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2004-UP-542","description":null,"date":"2004-10-26","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPREHEARING REPORT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT\r\nBE CITED OR RELIED ON AS\r\nPRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      Martha Geathers, Claimant.\r\n      v.\r\n      3V, Inc., Employer and EBI Companies, Carrier/Defendants, \r\n        And, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Carrier/Defendant Of Whom Liberty \r\n        Mutual Insurance Company is the, Appellant,\r\n      and, Martha Geathers, 3V, Inc., and EBI Companies \r\n        are the, Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAppeal From Georgetown County\r\nBenjamin H.

Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  action, we consider whether substantial evidence exists to support a finding \r\n  that where claimant Martha Geathers sustained compensable injuries in two separate \r\n  accidents while working for the same employer, liability for the period following \r\n  the second injury must be partially borne by the insurer who provided coverage \r\n  when the first accident occurred.Â  Here, a single commissioner and appellate \r\n  panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Commission) concluded \r\n  such evidence exists, relying on their findings that Geathers had not reached \r\n  maximum medical improvement (MMI) for injuries sustained in the first accident, \r\n  her treating physician had not released her from treatment of injuries sustained \r\n  in the first accident, and that the injuries she sustained in the two accidents \r\n  were â€œintertwined, indistinguishable, and inseparable.â€Â  On appeal, the circuit \r\n  court made contradictory findings based on its own view of conflicting evidence \r\n  in the record.Â  Ultimately, the circuit court found that the insurer providing \r\n  coverage when the second accident occurred, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company \r\n  (â€œLiberty Mutualâ€), was exclusively liable for compensation for the period following \r\n  the second injury.Â  Deferring to the factual findings of the Commission as mandated \r\n  by the applicable standard of review, we reverse.\r\nFACTS  \r\nGeathers sustained compensable back and leg injuries \r\n  in two accidents while employed by 3V, Inc. (â€œ3Vâ€).Â  The first accident occurred \r\n  on July 20, 1999 when EBI, Inc., (â€œEBIâ€) provided workersâ€™ compensation coverage \r\n  to 3V.Â  The second accident occurred on May 11, 2000, when Liberty Mutual provided \r\n  3Vâ€™s coverage.Â  \r\nFollowing the first accident, Geathers was out \r\n  of work from July 21, 1999 to August 21, 1999.Â  She returned to work at 3V and \r\n  was placed on â€œlight dutyâ€ until October 28, 1999, after which she resumed the \r\n  duties she performed before the July 1999 accident.Â  In the interim, Geathers \r\n  sought treatment from Dr. Jeffery C. Wilkins, a physiatrist, [1]  for her back and leg injuries.Â  Dr. Wilkins ordered that Geathers \r\n  undergo therapy and prescribed pain medicine for her use.Â  He also ordered that \r\n  she not work for three weeks, and then return to light duty at work.Â  Geathers \r\n  discontinued office visits with Dr. Wilkins in January 2000, after about nine \r\n  visits.Â  However, he continued to prescribe pain medicine.Â  Although Dr. Wilkins \r\n  also recommended additional therapy, Geathers failed to comply. \r\nGeathers continued working and taking Dr. Wilkinsâ€™s \r\n  prescribed pain medication until the May 2000 accident.Â  She never returned \r\n  to work after the second accident.Â  When the second accident occurred, she again \r\n  sought treatment from Dr. Wilkins, who continued to prescribe pain medicine \r\n  and therapy.\r\nShortly after the second accident, Geathers filed \r\n  a claim seeking workersâ€™ compensation benefits for injuries she sustained in \r\n  the July 1999 accident.Â  3V and EBI, the insurer providing 3Vâ€™s coverage at \r\n  the time of the 1999 accident, admitted that Geathers sustained a back injury \r\n  in the 1999 accident, but denied that she needed medical care for the injury \r\n  because she had reached MMI. \r\nGeathers filed a second claim against 3V on August \r\n  14, 2000.Â  This claim sought compensation for injuries she sustained in the \r\n  second accident, which occurred in May 2000 when Liberty Mutual provided 3Vâ€™s \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation insurance coverage.Â  3V and Liberty Mutual denied this \r\n  second claim, taking the position that her injuries resulted from the first \r\n  accident.Â  \r\nIn March 2001, a single \r\n  commissioner conducted a hearing on Geathersâ€™s claims.Â  At the hearing, EBI \r\n  took the position that Geathersâ€™s injuries from the 1999 accident were no longer \r\n  compensable because she had reached MMI, she had been released from Dr. Wilkinsâ€™s \r\n  care in January 2000, and her injuries were not the same as those sustained \r\n  in the first accident.Â  Conversely, Liberty Mutual argued that Geathers never \r\n  reached MMI for injuries related to the first accident, and that at a minimum \r\n  EBI should share liability for compensating Geathers.Â  Conflicting testimony \r\n  from Dr. Wilkins arguably supports both positions.Â  \r\nFirst, Dr. Wilkinsâ€™s medical \r\n  records provide no clear indication that he ever made a finding that Geathers \r\n  reached MMI or released Geathers from his care following the 1999 accident.Â  \r\n  Instead, the records suggested that he continued to recommend therapy and prescribe \r\n  pain medicine to Geathers beyond the January 2000 point at which Geathers stopped \r\n  visiting him for treatment.Â  \r\nNext, in deposition testimony \r\n  Dr. Wilkins agreed that when he examined Geathers following the second accident, \r\n  she had the â€œexact same physical exam signs, had the same objective and subjective \r\n  complaints as she had the entire timeâ€ and that â€œ[t]his was the same problemâ€ \r\n  she had following the 1999 accident.Â  He further agreed â€œthe symptoms and the \r\n  problems that she was having [did] relate back to July 1999.â€Â  Dr. Wilkins added \r\n  that the first accident caused â€œwhatever condition she might be in todayâ€ following \r\n  the 2000 accident.Â  He also testified:\r\n\r\n[T]he problem that she had from the first and from the second \r\n  and today is all the same problem.Â  The, the ideology and cause of her pain \r\n  is the same.Â  The, the â€“ I would consider that the second injury, per say [sic], \r\n  is, was actually just an aggravation of her initial injury.Â  Thatâ€™s the â€“ if \r\n  you look at her, if you look at her pain diagrams and way [sic] she describes \r\n  it, itâ€™s identical both by my examination as well as by [Geathersâ€™s] report \r\n  on her pain diagrams as far as distribution.\r\n\r\nDr. Wilkins further agreed that Geathersâ€™s â€œcurrent \r\n  conditionâ€ flowed from the first accident, and that â€œif she hadnâ€™t had the original \r\n  injury â€¦ itâ€™d be reasonable that she probably would not have had the second \r\n  injury â€¦ which is actually aggravation.â€Â  Dr. Wilkinsâ€™s deposition testimony \r\n  stands in stark contrast to his testimony at the hearing.Â  For example, at the \r\n  hearing Dr. Wilkinsâ€™s opinions largely favored the position of EBI in terms \r\n  of MMI and the relationship between the two accidents.\r\nGeathers testified that she continued to receive \r\n  prescription pain medicine from Dr. Wilkins even after she voluntarily stopped \r\n  seeking treatment from him in January 2000.Â  Especially significant is \r\n  Geathersâ€™s testimony concerning the events on the day of the second accident, \r\n  particularly the continuing nature of the pain she experienced prior \r\n  to the second injury.Â  According to Geathers, on the day of the second \r\n  accident but before the second accident occurred, she experienced â€œa lotâ€ of \r\n  sharp pain in her leg and lower back, which were the â€œsame symptomsâ€ and â€œsame \r\n  painâ€ she had experienced since the first work-related accident in July 1999.Â  \r\n  Thus, Geathers was â€œstill in painâ€ and â€œstill having problemsâ€ from the first \r\n  accident at the time of the second accident.Â  She subsequently confirmed that \r\n  the â€œsevereâ€ back pain experienced at the time of the second accident was identical \r\n  to the pain she experienced as a result of the first accident.Â  This testimony, \r\n  deemed credible by the Commission, is consistent with those portions of Dr. \r\n  Wilkinsâ€™s testimony that the Commission adopted.\r\nFollowing the hearing, the \r\n  single commissioner issued an order finding that the 2000 accident resulted \r\n  in an injury that:\r\n\r\nwas a re-injury to the \r\n  same body parts for which [MMI] had not been established; that the [May 2000] \r\n  accident was intervening, but not totally independent of the [July 1999] accidental \r\n  injury and the [May 2000] accidental injury aggravated, exacerbated, and worsened \r\n  [Geathersâ€™s] condition; and the injuries from the two accidental injuries are \r\n  intertwined, indistinguishable, and inseparable beginning May 11, 2000 and[,] \r\n  and remain so as of the date of this hearing.\r\n\r\nBased on these findings, \r\n  the single commissioner ordered that EBI and Liberty Mutual â€œeach equally payâ€ \r\n  Geathers compensation and â€œall medical and related costs incurred by [Geathers] \r\n  as a result of her injuries by accident as provided and allowed under the South \r\n  Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act; and during the remainder of disability continuing \r\n  from [Geathersâ€™s] injuries by accident [EBI and Liberty Mutual] shall continue \r\n  to furnish free of charge all such medical and related costs incurred by [Geathers] \r\n  â€¦.â€Â  EBI appealed the order of the single commissioner to an appellate panel \r\n  of the Commission, which affirmed.\r\nEBI appealed to the circuit \r\n  court, which conducted a hearing in January 2002.Â  In March 2003, the circuit \r\n  court issued an order reversing the Commissionâ€™s order holding EBI liable for \r\n  Geathersâ€™s compensation following the 2000 accident, finding that there was \r\n  â€œsimply no evidence in the record to support the Commissionâ€™s finding that [Dr.] \r\n  Wilkins had not released [Geathers] in January 2000 at maximum medical improvement.â€Â  \r\n  It based this finding â€œupon [] Dr. Wilkinsâ€™s sworn testimony at the hearing, \r\n  the medical records in evidence, and [Geathersâ€™s] own admission â€¦.â€Â  The circuit \r\n  court also rejected the Commissionâ€™s finding that the two accidental injuries \r\n  were â€œintertwined, indistinguishable, and inseparable beginningâ€ on the date \r\n  of the 2000 accident.Â  In so doing, the circuit court stated:\r\n\r\nBased on upon the evidence \r\n  in the record, the [2000] accident is clearly distinguishable from the [1999] \r\n  accident because [Geathersâ€™s] need for medical and compensation benefits after \r\n  [the 2000 accident] was necessitated solely by the [2000] accident and that \r\n  accident caused physical injuries separate and distinct from any injuries related \r\n  to the [1999] accident.Â  The Commission cites no evidence in support of its \r\n  finding that the [1999] accident was distinguishable from the [2000] accident.Â  \r\n  Because this finding is otherwise not supported by substantial evidence in the \r\n  record, it must be reversed.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the circuit \r\n  court held Liberty Mutual solely responsible for the Geathersâ€™ benefits following \r\n  the 2000 accident.\r\nLiberty Mutual made a motion seeking the circuit court \r\n  to reconsider its order, which the circuit court denied.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLiberty Mutual argues there is \r\n  substantial evidence to support the findings of the Commission.Â  Liberty Mutual \r\n  further argues that the circuit court reached contrary conclusions by impermissibly \r\n  weighing the evidence and making its own findings of fact.Â  As a consequence, \r\n  Liberty Mutual argues the circuit court erred in finding it exclusively liable \r\n  for Geathersâ€™s compensation benefits for the period following the 2000 injury.Â  \r\n  We agree and reverse.\r\nIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, a court sitting \r\n  in an appellate capacity will not overturn a decision of the Commission unless \r\n  the decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or controlled by an error \r\n  of law.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 \r\n  (1981).Â  Substantial evidence is not merely a â€œscintilla of evidence nor the \r\n  evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering \r\n  the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion \r\n  that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify \r\n  its action.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe substantial evidence rule does not allow judicial \r\n  fact-finding, or the substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment.â€Â  \r\n  Toddâ€™s Ice Cream, Inc. v. South Carolina Employment Commâ€™n, 281 S.C. \r\n  254, 258, 315 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Rather, the Commission is the \r\n  ultimate fact-finder, and neither the circuit court sitting in an appellate \r\n  capacity nor this court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission \r\n  as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  Linnen v. Beaufort \r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Depâ€™t, 305 S.C. 341, 345, 408 S.E.2d 248, 250 (Ct. App. \r\n  1991).Â  \r\nHere, the record contains ample evidence from Geathers and Dr. Wilkins to support \r\n  the version of facts adopted by the Commission.Â  With respect to Geathersâ€™s \r\n  testimony, we note that she testified that she continued to suffer symptoms \r\n  of â€œsevereâ€ and â€œsharpâ€ back pain resulting from her 1999 accidental injuries \r\n  after she stopped seeking treatment, apart from prescription pain medicine, \r\n  from Dr. Wilkins in January 2000.Â  Significantly, she testified that she was \r\n  suffering these painful symptoms on the date of the 2000 accident, just prior \r\n  to the accident. Â \r\nRegarding Dr. Wilkinsâ€™s testimony, \r\n  his notes of Geathersâ€™s treatment do not indicate a finding of MMI or that he \r\n  released her from his treatment in January 2000.Â  The record further supports \r\n  the finding that Dr. Wilkins continued to prescribe pain medicine to Geathers, \r\n  at her request, even after she stopped visiting his office for treatments.Â  \r\n  Moreover, his deposition testimony provides substantial evidence for the findings \r\n  of the Commission concerning the nexus between the 1999 and 2000 accidental \r\n  work-related injuries. \r\nWe find the testimony of Geathers \r\n  and Dr. Wilkins provides substantial evidence to support the version of facts \r\n  adopted by the Commission.Â  See Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., \r\n  343 S.C. 487, 492-93, 541 S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001) (â€œWhere there is a conflict \r\n  in the evidence, either by different witnesses or in the testimony of the same \r\n  witness, the findings of fact of the Commission are conclusive.â€).Â Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find that the circuit court erred in adopting its own view of the facts in \r\n  reaching its conclusions regarding whether Geathers reached MMI, whether Geathers \r\n  had been released from care by Dr. Wilkins in January 2000, and whether the \r\n  injuries she sustained in the two accidents were indistinguishable so as to \r\n  require both insurance carriers to share liability for providing compensation \r\n  to Geathers.\r\nEBI nevertheless contends that Liberty \r\n  Mutual should have been held solely liable for compensation for the period following \r\n  the May 2000 accidental injury.Â  In support of its contention, EBI cites Gordon \r\n  v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours, 228 S.C. 67, 76, 88 S.E.2d 844, 848 (1955) for \r\n  the propositions that â€œwhere a latent or quiescent weakened, but not disabling, \r\n  condition resulting from disease is by accidental injury in the course and scope \r\n  of employment aggravated or accelerated or activated, with resulting disability, \r\n  such disability is compensableâ€ and if such â€œdisability is proximately caused \r\n  by the subsequent accidental injury, compensability is referable to that, and \r\n  not the earlier, one.â€Â  EBI argues that Gordon mandates a finding in \r\n  its favor as a matter of law.Â  We find this argument unavailing in light of \r\n  the factual-driven nature of the Gordon decision.Â  See id., \r\n  228 S.C. at 70, 88 S.E.2d at 845 (â€œThere is but one fundamental issue involved, \r\n  and that a factual one, namely: was appellantâ€™s compensable disability caused \r\n  by the accident of March 9, 1951, or by the accident of July 23, 1951.â€).Â  Here, \r\n  the Commission determined that Geathersâ€™s 1999 and 2000 injuries were not separate \r\n  and distinct injuries but instead were â€œintertwined, indistinguishable, and \r\n  inseparable.â€Â  In making this finding, we are constrained by the applicable \r\n  substantial evidence standard of review.Â  Similarly, the Gordon court \r\n  emphasized that its role was to affirm the Commissionâ€™s findings where supported \r\n  by substantial evidence.Â  Id.Â  (â€œThat issue having been decided by the \r\n  Commission as before stated, our review is limited to determination of whether \r\n  there was any competent testimony tending to support the Commissionâ€™s finding.â€).Â  \r\n  We reject EBIâ€™s efforts on appeal to recast the issue as one of law in an attempt \r\n  to avoid application of the substantial evidence test.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the circuit court order and reinstate the order of the Commission.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we do not reach the remaining grounds for reversal.Â  See \r\n  Futch v. McAllister Towing, 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) \r\n  (ruling that an appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution \r\n  of prior issue is dispositive of remaining issues). \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  A physiatrist is a â€œphysician who specializes in physical \r\n    medicine.â€Â  Merriam-Websterâ€™s Collegiate Dictionary 877 (10th ed. 1993).Â  \r\n    Physical medicine is â€œa branch of medicine concerned with the diagnosis and \r\n    treatment of disease and disability by physical meansâ€ such as radiation, \r\n    heat, and electricity.Â  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-543","title":"Ashley Engineering v.

Cisa, of Mt. Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\nAndrew David Grimes, of North Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: TKS Construction hired Ashley \r\n  Engineering to help develop a piece of property that it was seeking to purchase.Â  \r\n  Ashley Engineering filed a mechanicâ€™s lien against the property when TKS failed \r\n  to pay Ashley Engineering for its services.Â  TKS challenged the mechanicâ€™s lien \r\n  and sought to escape the full impact of the lien by submitting a cash bond in \r\n  compliance with the mechanicâ€™s lien statute.Â  The master-in-equity enforced \r\n  the mechanicâ€™s lien and refused to substitute the cash bond for the property.Â  \r\n  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nTKS is wholly owned and operated by Theo K. Soritoglou, \r\n  who is the corporationâ€™s registered agent for service of process.Â  TKSâ€™s registered \r\n  office for service of process, as of April 23, 2002, was 100 Crowfield Boulevard, \r\n  Goose Creek, South Carolina. \r\nTKS sought to buy a piece \r\n  of property from Westvaco Development Corporation; however, prior to purchasing \r\n  the land, Westvaco had to approve TKSâ€™s development plans.Â  Therefore, TKS hired \r\n  Ashley Engineering to determine the most cost effective way to develop the property.Â  \r\n  The work involved engineering a development design, obtaining permits, getting \r\n  approval for the project, and conducting boundary, topographical, and construction \r\n  surveys. \r\nTKS was initially interested \r\n  in buying an area defined as Lot 2.Â  Ashley Engineeringâ€™s work, however, revealed \r\n  that a section of Lot 2 did not need engineering work to obtain a building permit.Â  \r\n  This section would yield four lots ready for immediate construction because \r\n  an area that was in the process of being developed surrounded it.Â  As a result, \r\n  this subsection of Lot 2 was sold to TKS as Lot 2A.Â  TKS did not purchase the \r\n  rest of Lot 2 from Westvaco.\r\nTKS never paid Ashley Engineering \r\n  for the work they performed on Lot 2.Â  As a result, Ashley Engineering filed \r\n  a notice and certificate of mechanicâ€™s lien in the amount of $7,533.57 on Lot \r\n  2A.Â  Ashley Engineering subsequently initiated a suit against TKS by filing \r\n  a summons and complaint, as well as a lis pendens.Â  The complaint \r\n  requested damages totaling $7,663.20 and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  TKS failed to answer \r\n  the complaint and an order of default was entered.Â  \r\nAt a damages hearing, TKS \r\n  challenged the sufficiency of Ashley Engineeringâ€™s service of process through \r\n  a motion to set aside default, but the trial court found service was proper.Â  \r\n  Additionally, damages were set at $7,800.00 for labor, $675.00 for accrued interest, \r\n  and $4,494.00 for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  By consent of the parties, the amount of \r\n  damages was later amended to $7,573.57. \r\nPrior to the amendment of \r\n  the damages, TKS entered a bond in the amount of $10,098.08 and requested that \r\n  the court amend its order to substitute the cash bond entirely for the real \r\n  property pursuant to section 29-5-110 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  Ashley Engineering objected to the substitution because it would leave a portion \r\n  of its $12,969.00 judgment unsecured by either the bond or the real property.Â  \r\n  The trial court agreed and determined it would be inequitable to allow the bond \r\n  to be substituted entirely for the real property.Â  TKS appeals this decision.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nService of Process  \r\nTKS argues the trial court \r\n  erred by not setting aside the default judgment because the summons and complaint \r\n  regarding the mechanicâ€™s lien was not appropriately served.Â  We disagree. \r\nWhen the sufficiency of \r\n  the service of process is challenged, the findings of the trial court are binding \r\n  on the appellate court unless they are wholly unsupported by the evidence or \r\n  manifestly influenced or controlled by an error of law.Â  Brown v. Carolina \r\n  Emergency Physicians, P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 583, 560 S.E.2d 624, 631&nbsp;(Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).\r\nAshley Engineering served \r\n  TKS on April 23, 2002 by delivering the summons and complaint to TKSâ€™s registered \r\n  office for service of process, which at that time was 100 Crowfield Boulevard, \r\n  Goose Creek, South Carolina.Â  Agent Owned Realty, however, occupied this address.Â  \r\n  In the past, Agent Owned Realty had employed Soritoglou, TKSâ€™s president, sole-shareholder, \r\n  and registered agent of service; however, he had since left the agency.Â  Soritoglou \r\n  operated TKS out of Agent Owned Realtyâ€™s office until January 2002.Â  As late \r\n  as April 12, 2002, TKS sent a facsimile transmission to Ashley Engineering listing \r\n  100 Crowfield Boulevard as its address on its letterhead.Â  Furthermore, it was \r\n  not uncommon for Soritoglou to receive mail at Agent Owned Realty, even after \r\n  he quit working there.Â  In fact, the office had a procedure for handling ex-agentsâ€™ \r\n  mail whereby the mail was placed in an envelope for the agent to pick up, and \r\n  if after some time the agent had not come to get the envelope, it was mailed \r\n  to the agent.Â  Soritoglou admitted he still received mail at the Crowfield address \r\n  and occasionally retrieved his mail from there.Â  \r\nWhen the process server \r\n  arrived at 100 Crowfield Boulevard, Kelly Poston, Agent Owned Realtyâ€™s secretary, \r\n  told her that Soritoglou no longer worked at the office.Â  Poston then offered \r\n  to call Soritoglou for the process server.Â  Soritoglou admits that during the \r\n  telephone conversation he told the process server that she could leave the legal \r\n  papers at Agent Owned Realty.Â  After the telephone call, the process server \r\n  told Poston she had been instructed by Soritoglou to leave the legal papers \r\n  with her and Poston accepted them.Â  Soritoglou denies receiving the papers.\r\nRule 4(d)(3), SCRCP, allows \r\n  for service of a corporation â€œby delivering a copy of the summons and complaint \r\n  to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any other agent authorized \r\n  by appointment or by law to receive service of process . . . .â€Â  Ashley Engineering \r\n  served the summons and complaint at the registered address for service of process \r\n  after being told by Soritoglou, the registered agent for service of process, \r\n  that the legal papers could be left at that location. \r\nâ€œAccording to . . . state rules . . . , service \r\n  of process may be made upon an individual by delivering a copy of the summons \r\n  and of the complaint to an agent authorized by appointment to receive service \r\n  of process.Â  This provision was intended to cover the situation where an individual \r\n  actually appoints an agent for the purpose of receiving service.â€Â  Moore \r\n  v. Simpson, 322 S.C. 518, 523-24, 473 S.E.2d 64, 67&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) \r\n  (citation omitted).Â  Through his actions and words, Soritoglou authorized Poston \r\n  to be an agent for service of process.Â  Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP, allows for this \r\n  authorization of an agent for service of process.Â  Therefore, the trial court \r\n  did not commit error by refusing to set aside the default judgment. \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mechanicâ€™s Lien\r\nTKS argues the trial court erred in concluding \r\n  that Ashley Engineering was entitled to a mechanicâ€™s lien because Ashley Engineering \r\n  had not performed any work relative to Lot 2A within 90 days of filing the mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien as required by section 29-5-90 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe decision of whether to grant relief from an \r\n  entry of default is solely within the sound discretion of the trial court.â€Â  \r\n  Top Value Homes, Inc. v. Harden, 319 S.C. 302, 306, \r\n  460 S.E.2d 427, 429 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œAn order based on an exercise of that \r\n  discretion, however, will be set aside if it is controlled by some error of \r\n  law or lacks evidentiary support.â€Â  Id.\r\nRobert Locklair, the owner of Ashley Engineering, \r\n  testified that October 29, 2001 was the last date that Ashley Engineering did \r\n  any work for TKS.Â  Locklair testified that on that date Ashley Engineering obtained \r\n  approval from the Town of Summerville for their plat of the property that TKS \r\n  was contracting to purchase from Westvaco.Â  Ashley Engineering then filed its \r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien on November 8, 2001.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err \r\n  in its decision because there was evidence that Ashley Engineering had completed \r\n  its work for TKS within 90 days of filing its mechanicâ€™s lien. \r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cash Bond\r\nTKS argues the trial court \r\n  erred by refusing to release the subject property from the mechanicâ€™s lien because \r\n  they submitted a cash bond pursuant to section 29-5-110 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (Supp. 2003).Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  regarding a mechanicâ€™s lien will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  Keeneyâ€™s Metal Roofing, Inc. v. Palmieri,&nbsp;345 S.C. \r\n  550, 553, 548 S.E.2d 900, 901-02&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  An abuse of discretion \r\n  occurs when the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is based upon an error of law.Â  Id.\r\nAshley Engineering submitted \r\n  a statement of account for $7,533.57 in work performed and interest on the unpaid \r\n  balance.Â  Later, at the damages hearing, the trial court set damages at $7,800.00 \r\n  for labor, $675.00 for accrued interest, and $4,494.00 for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n  The amount of damages was later amended, by consent of the parties, to $7,573.57.\r\nAfter the court had set \r\n  damages and attorneyâ€™s fees, TKS submitted a bond for $10,098.08, one and one-third \r\n  times the amount the court awarded as damages.Â  Subsequently, TKS asked the \r\n  trial court to amend its order to substitute the cash bond for the subject real \r\n  property.Â  Ashley Engineering objected, arguing the substitution would leave \r\n  $2,870.92 of its judgment unsecured.Â  The court agreed and refused to substitute \r\n  the cash bond because it would leave a substantial portion of Ashley Engineeringâ€™s \r\n  judgment uncovered by either bond or property.Â  The court determined that it \r\n  would be â€œunjust and inequitableâ€ to find that a lienorâ€™s property is secured \r\n  by only a general lien on the property, after the lienor has complied strictly \r\n  with all the requirements of the statute and enforced its lien all the way through \r\n  suit to judgment.Â  \r\nSection 29-5-110 of the \r\n  South Carolina Code states that an owner may, at any time, secure the discharge \r\n  of the property from a mechanicâ€™s lien by filing an amount equal to one and \r\n  one-third times the amount claimed in the statement of account.Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 29-5-110 (Supp. 2003).Â  The use of the word â€œmayâ€ vests discretion in the \r\n  owner of the property to either submit a cash bond or suffer the lien.Â  TKS \r\n  availed itself of this statute by submitting an amount complying with the formula \r\n  in section 29-5-110.Â  \r\nâ€œWhen the terms of a statute \r\n  are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.â€Â  \r\n  Hinton v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services, \r\n  357 S.C. 327, 334, 592 S.E.2d 335, 339 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Section 29-5-110 does \r\n  not grant the courts discretion in discharging the property from the lien.Â  \r\n  While it may be inequitable to apply the statute in such a way that the lienorâ€™s \r\n  full judgment is no longer secured and where attorneyâ€™s fees are effectively \r\n  capped at an amount no greater than the one-third of the total value of labor \r\n  listed in the statement of account, it is the application required by the statuteâ€™s \r\n  clear language.\r\nBecause a plain reading \r\n  of section 29-5-110 allows discharge of the lien in return for a cash bond set \r\n  at one and one-third the amount claimed in the statement of account, and TKS \r\n  submitted such bond, the trial court erred by refusing to substitute the cash \r\n  bond for the subject property.\r\n  IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damages\r\nTKS argues the court erred \r\n  in awarding damages because Ashley Engineering was unable to specify what improvements \r\n  or work was performed on Lot 2A.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn a foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien, the judgeâ€™s findings will not be disturbed unless they are without evidentiary \r\n  support.Â  Zepsa Constr., Inc. v. Randazzo, 356 S.C. 39, 43, 586 S.E.2d \r\n  599, 601&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  The trial court found Ashley Engineering had \r\n  â€œconducted site and topographical surveysâ€ and â€œdeveloped designs for roads, \r\n  drainage, water sewer and grading for the propertyâ€ as to the entirety of Lot \r\n  2, from which Lot 2A was later carved.Â  Also, Ashley Engineeringâ€™s work revealed \r\n  that Lot 2A could be subdivided and built upon without additional infrastructure \r\n  such as roads, drainage, water, and sewer.Â  Furthermore, Ashley Engineering \r\n  determined where to separate Lot 2A from Lot 2 and where to divide the portion \r\n  into lots for building. \r\nAshley Engineering contracted \r\n  with TKS to provide engineering services related to all of Lot 2, from which \r\n  Lot 2A was eventually divided.Â  TKS tries to escape a portion of the mechanicâ€™s \r\n  lien by demanding that Ashley Engineering specify what percentage of the work \r\n  was performed on Lot 2A as opposed to Lot 2.Â  The work Ashley Engineering performed \r\n  on the entire area, however, led to the conclusion that Lot 2A could be separated \r\n  from Lot 2. \r\nTestimony from Locklair \r\n  established the interconnectedness of the work done on Lot 2 and Lot 2A.Â  Locklair \r\n  testified the work was of such a degree that it was impossible to apportion \r\n  amounts of work between the lots.Â  This supports the trial courtâ€™s conclusion \r\n  that a mechanicâ€™s lien in the full amount could attach to Lot 2A, thus there \r\n  is abundant support in the record to support the judgeâ€™s factual findings.\r\nAdditionally, because we \r\n  affirm the trial courtâ€™s findings and attorneyâ€™s fees are authorized under the \r\n  mechanicâ€™s lien statute, the trial court did not err by awarding Ashley Engineering \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\n STILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-544","title":"Green v.

Whitney, Jr., of Union, for Appellant.\r\nWesley Dickinson Peel, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  DK Construction Company (DK) \r\n  of North Carolina sought foreclosure of a valid mechanicâ€™s lien against First \r\n  Calvary Baptist Church (First Calvary).Â  First Calvary raised defenses related \r\n  to setoff and indefiniteness.Â  The master-in-equity rejected the defenses and \r\n  foreclosed the mechanicâ€™s lien in favor of DK Construction.Â  First Calvary argues \r\n  the trial court erred in foreclosing the mechanicâ€™s lien. Â We affirm. \r\n   &nbsp;FACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\nHISTORY  \r\n  This action arises out of the \r\n    construction of the First Calvary Baptist Church in Rock Hill, South Carolina.Â  \r\n    The parties settled all claims with the first party Plaintiff Curley Wilson \r\n    Green prior to trial.Â  \r\n  First Calvary contracted with R. Jones \r\n    Construction Company, Inc. a/k/a Quad-State Group (Jones) to design and build \r\n    a new church building for the parish.Â  Jones encountered difficulties in completing \r\n    the construction project due to financial problems.Â  The project was already \r\n    behind the original schedule by the time Jones, as general contractor, contracted \r\n    with subcontractor DK Construction to provide all labor and materials necessary \r\n    to finish the project under Jonesâ€™ supervision.Â  All the parties were aware \r\n    of the project delays at the time that DK began work on the project.Â  No evidence \r\n    indicated that First Calvary intended to assess delay damages against the \r\n    contractors at the time DK entered the project.Â  \r\n  DK contracted to complete the work for Jones \r\n    for the remaining contract balance, including the retainages held by First \r\n    Calvary.Â  Moreover, by agreement of DK, Jones, and First Calvary, DK would \r\n    be paid for additional work outside of the subcontract by change orders approved \r\n    by the project architect.Â  At the time DK subcontracted with Jones the only \r\n    work completed on the project was the foundation, slab, and plumbing work. \r\n  \r\n  DK satisfactorily performed its obligation under \r\n    the contract with Jones and the project architect approved DKâ€™s work on the \r\n    project.Â  DK presented its final bill to First Calvary through Jones in the \r\n    amount of $52,436.00.Â  The amount of the final bill consisted of $12,886.00 \r\n    in change orders and $39,550.00 in work related to the original contract.Â  \r\n    Moreover, the project architect approved DKâ€™s final request for payment in \r\n    the amount of $52,436.00.Â  Neither Jones nor DK received the final payment \r\n    due from First Calvary.Â  First Calvary concedes that it owes DK the $12,886.00 \r\n    from the final change order.Â  First Calvary also holds $39,550.00 related \r\n    to the original contract.Â  \r\n  First Calvary asserted at trial the defenses \r\n    of setoff and delay to DKâ€™s mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  The court found that based upon \r\n    the testimony, DK agreed to perform work for Jones for the remaining contract \r\n    balance including any retainages held by First Calvary and that the retainages \r\n    were owed to DK under that contract.Â  The trial court also concluded as a \r\n    matter of law that DK filed and perfected a mechanicâ€™s lien pursuant to section \r\n    29-5-20 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003) and is entitled to foreclose \r\n    on the lien in the amount of $52,436.00 plus interest, costs, and attorneyâ€™s \r\n    fees.Â  The court rejected the defenses of setoff and delay.Â  First Calvary \r\n    appeals only the amount foreclosed under the mechanicâ€™s lien [1] . Â We affirm.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  An action to foreclose a mechanicâ€™s \r\n    lien is an action at law in South Carolina.Â  Keeneyâ€™s Metal Roofing, Inc. \r\n    v. Palmieri, 345 S.C. 550, 553, 548 S.E.2d 900, 901 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n    In an action at law, tried without a jury, the judgeâ€™s findings will not be \r\n    disturbed by the appellate court unless they are without evidentiary support.Â  \r\n    King v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 317 S.C. 385, 388, 453 S.E.2d 885, \r\n    888 (1995).Â  The judgeâ€™s findings are equivalent to those of a jury in an \r\n    action at law.Â  Id. at 389, 453 S.E.2d at 888.Â  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  The issue before this court is whether \r\n    the trial court erred in foreclosing DKâ€™s mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  The South Carolina \r\n    Mechanicâ€™s Lien Statute provides that â€œ[e]very laborer, mechanic, subcontractor, \r\n    or person furnishing material for the improvement of real estate when the \r\n    improvement has been authorized by the owner has a lien thereon, subject . \r\n    . . to the value of the labor or material so furnished . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n    Ann. Â§ 29-5-20 (Supp. 2003).Â  Section 29-5-20 protects the mechanic or supplier \r\n    who deals with a general contractor or some person other than the owner or \r\n    his agent.Â  T.W. Morton Builders, Inc. v. von Buedingen, 316 S.C. 388, \r\n    400, 450 S.E.2d 87, 94 (Ct. App. 1994) (A manifest purpose of Section 29-5-20 \r\n    is â€œthe protection of one not a party to a contract with the owner, who furnishes \r\n    labor or material in the improvement of the ownerâ€™s property, by giving him \r\n    a lien for such labor or material.â€).Â  \r\n  First Calvaryâ€™s main argument is that \r\n    the trial court erred in foreclosing the mechanicâ€™s lien since the lien was \r\n    not related to work performed or materials provided by DK and, therefore, \r\n    outside the definition provided in Section 29-5-20.Â  We find this argument \r\n    to be without merit.Â  There is ample evidence in the record to support the \r\n    courtâ€™s decision that the amount of the lien related directly to DKâ€™s work \r\n    performed and materials furnished for the benefit of First Calvary.Â  \r\n  Jones brought DK into the project to furnish \r\n    all labor and materials necessary for the completion of the church.Â  DK performed \r\n    its obligation under the contract with Jones and the project architect approved \r\n    DKâ€™s work on the project.Â  First Calvary admits holding the contract balance \r\n    due to Jones, which, in turn, is owed to DK pursuant to DKâ€™s subcontract.Â  \r\n    We find that the master-in-equity correctly foreclosed the lien in the amount \r\n    of $52,436.00. [2]   \r\n  AFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â  \r\n   STILWELL, BEATTY, AND SHORT, JJ., \r\n    concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  First Calvary does not appeal any issues relating to their defenses \r\n    of setoff or the award of attorneyâ€™s fees, interest, and costs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  In the Appellantâ€™s Brief, First Calvary also contends that the trial \r\n    court erred in awarding damages on the basis of quantum meruit.Â  \r\n    Since we held that the trial court properly foreclosed the mechanicâ€™s lien \r\n    of DK for the full amount sought, we need not address this issue.Â  Moreover, \r\n    the trial court did not award damages based on quantum meruit; \r\n    the sole basis of recovery for DK was limited to foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s \r\n    lien.Â  Therefore, the issue is manifestly without merit.Â  Rule 220(b)(2), \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-545","title":"City of Greenwood v.

Watson, Jr., of Greenwood, for Appellant.Â  \r\nSolicitor William Townes Jones, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Philip W. Whiteside appeals \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order upholding his conviction for violating a city noise \r\n  ordinance.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nWhiteside served as president of his social \r\n  fraternity and lived in a house along with four of his fraternity brothers in \r\n  the City of Greenwood, South Carolina.Â  On the evening of February 12, 2003, \r\n  the brothers hosted a fraternity-sponsored house party and played music for \r\n  their guests on a stereo.Â  The stereo belonged to one of the four brothers who \r\n  shared the house with Whiteside, who was present at the party.Â  Police officers \r\n  testified they could hear music and loud voices coming from the house approximately \r\n  one and a half lots away.Â  \r\nAfter determining the music was too loud, two police \r\n  officers went to the house and asked some party guests to speak with the person \r\n  in charge.Â  They summoned Whiteside, who came onto the porch and spoke with \r\n  the officers.Â  When asked by the officers, Whiteside affirmed he was in charge \r\n  of the house.Â  He was then issued a citation for violation of the city noise \r\n  ordinance.Â  \r\nThe municipal court denied Whitesideâ€™s motion for \r\n  directed verdict and found him guilty of violating section 18-62 of the city \r\n  noise ordinance after determining there was â€œdirect and circumstantial evidence \r\n  that indicated that [Whiteside] was in charge of the property in which the music \r\n  was being emitted.â€Â  The court â€œadvised [Whiteside] that not only was the charge \r\n  proper against him, but could also be brought against the other three persons \r\n  who reside at this location and were present on this evening when this charge \r\n  was made.â€Â  \r\nWhiteside appealed to the circuit court, arguing the \r\n  judge erred in declining to grant a directed verdict because there was no evidence \r\n  he either maintained or operated the stereo and therefore the ordinance was \r\n  inapplicable to him as a matter of law.Â  The circuit court disagreed and upheld \r\n  the conviction, finding Whiteside â€œwas sufficiently in charge of the premises \r\n  at issue to be deemed criminally responsible for the violation of City Ordinance \r\n  18-62, even though there was no specific evidence admitted that [Whiteside] \r\n  personally operated the radio, or that the radio was his personal property.â€Â  \r\n  The court determined that as fraternity president, Whiteside was in â€œa position \r\n  of special responsibility over the premisesâ€ and was â€œresponsible for the consequence \r\n  of unreasonable noise arising from the music being played.â€Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWhiteside contends the circuit court erred by affirming the \r\n  denial of his directed verdict motion arguing there was no evidence he owned \r\n  or operated the stereo.Â  He claims the circuit court improperly held him responsible, \r\n  as fraternity president, for the acts of his unidentified fraternity brother \r\n  and housemate who also attended the party and owned and operated the stereo.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œIn criminal appeals from magistrate or municipal \r\n  court, the circuit court does not conduct a de novo review, but instead \r\n  reviews for preserved error raised to it by appropriate exception.Â  In reviewing \r\n  criminal cases, this court may review errors of law only.â€ Â State v. Henderson, \r\n  347 S.C. 455, 457, 556 S.E.2d 691, 692 (Ct. App. 2001) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\n  On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, an appellate court shall view \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Walker, \r\n  349 S.C. 49, 53, 562 S.E.2d 313, 315 (2002).Â  This court will affirm the denial \r\n  of a directed verdict motion if there is any direct evidence or substantial \r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused.Â  \r\n  State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, 572 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2002).Â  \r\nSection 18-62(a), Code of Ordinances for the City \r\n  of Greenwood, provides in relevant part,\r\n\r\nIt shall be unlawful for any person or persons to maintain \r\n  and operate . . . from any building, any public place or on any premises whatsoever \r\n  within the city, any radio or device of any kind which is designed to amplify, \r\n  or does in fact, amplify sound and/or music whereby the sound created therefrom \r\n  creates unreasonably loud excessive or disturbing noises[.]Â  \r\n\r\nAll parties acknowledge Whiteside neither \r\n  owned the stereo nor personally played the loud music heard by the officers.Â  \r\n  However, as the person who accepted responsibility over the house, Whiteside \r\n  co-hosted a party where the stereo located in the house living room was used \r\n  to play music for the entertainment of his guests.Â  When the officers arrived \r\n  to investigate the source of the loud noise and asked to speak with the person \r\n  in charge, guests summoned Whiteside to meet them.Â  Finally, in his conversation \r\n  with the officers, Whiteside acknowledged he was in charge of the house.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the \r\n  State, we conclude there was substantial circumstantial evidence that Whiteside \r\n  was responsible for the maintenance and operation of the stereo during the party.Â  \r\n  As a result, his motion for directed verdict was properly denied.Â  State \r\n  v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 332-33, 468 S.E.2d 626, 629 (1996) (â€œIn ruling \r\n  on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence \r\n  of evidence, not with its weight.Â  When [an appellate court] reviews the denial \r\n  of a motion for a directed verdict, it views the evidence in the light most \r\n  favorable to the non-moving party, and if there is any direct or substantial \r\n  circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, \r\n  refusal by the trial judge to direct a verdict is not error.â€) (internal citations \r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSTILWELL, BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-546","title":"Reaves v.

Fabri, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nRobert Wade Maring, of Georgetown, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Karen P. Smith (the mother) \r\n  appeals the order of the family court finding her in contempt for withholding \r\n  the partiesâ€™ children from a scheduled visitation with James R. Smith (the father).Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties were divorced on October 31, 2002.Â  \r\n  Pursuant to the terms of the decree, the mother was granted custody of the partiesâ€™ \r\n  two daughters with liberal visitation to the father.Â  The girls exercised visitation \r\n  with their father without incident until July of 2003.Â  \r\nAfter the girls returned from visitation with the \r\n  father from June 20, 2003 to July 4, 2003, the mother discovered the older daughter \r\n  had a bald spot at the top of her head caused by her pulling her own hair out.Â  \r\n  The mother called the father that night, July 7, 2003, and they discussed the \r\n  situation.Â  The younger girl had told the father about the older daughterâ€™s \r\n  actions during their visitation with him.Â  According to the mother, the father \r\n  told her that he â€œwasnâ€™t too concerned about itâ€ because he himself had developed \r\n  obsessive-type habits when he was a child.Â  The father, however, testified that \r\n  he planned on asking Patricia Carter, the girlâ€™s therapist about the condition \r\n  when they met for a scheduled family counseling session on Thursday, July 10, \r\n  2003.Â  On that Thursday, the mother instead took the girls to an appointment \r\n  with Michael Kollar, Ed.D., a licensed clinical psychologist that the girls \r\n  had been seeing for individual counseling, who made the diagnosis of trichotillomania. [2] Â  Without first calling the father, the mother cancelled the \r\n  family counseling session that was scheduled for that evening.Â  Later that evening, \r\n  the father called the motherâ€™s house and spoke to the older daughter.Â  The mother \r\n  testified that after the call, the older daughter began crying and pulling out \r\n  her hair for much of the night, saying she didnâ€™t want to go to visitation with \r\n  her father.Â  \r\nThe following day the mother left a note in the \r\n  fatherâ€™s mailbox stating that she was refusing to produce the children for the \r\n  visitation that was to start that day, July 11, 2003, and to end on July 25, \r\n  2003.Â  The father attempted to pick up the children that evening with the assistance \r\n  of a sheriffâ€™s deputy.Â  Although the older daughter was home, the younger daughter \r\n  was at a friendâ€™s house.Â  The father left without either girl.Â  As the mother \r\n  knew, the father had planned to take the children on a vacation to the Bahamas \r\n  during this visitation period.Â  The trip was to commence on July 15.Â  As a result \r\n  of not being able to start his visitation with the girls, the father had to \r\n  buy replacement airline tickets and also had to pay another veterinarian who \r\n  had contracted with him to cover for him at work during the vacation days missed.Â  \r\n\r\nThe father filed an Emergency Rule to Show Cause \r\n  on July 14, 2003.Â  The motherâ€™s attorney accepted service on her behalf by fax \r\n  on the same date.Â  Although the mother was never personally served, she appeared \r\n  at the hearing and agreed to go forward on the Rule.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, the mother introduced evidence \r\n  in the form of an affidavit prepared by Dr. Kollar advising that the older daughter \r\n  had begun suffering from trichotillomania.Â  In the affidavit, Dr. Kollar recommended \r\n  that the older daughter be evaluated by a pediatrician and also advised that \r\n  the mother should not â€œphysically forc[e]â€ the daughters to visit the father \r\n  if they did not want to go.Â  \r\nAfter hearing all the evidence, the trial judge found \r\n  that the mother had improperly denied visitation to the father and was in willful \r\n  contempt.Â  The judge stated that the mother had â€œeither manipulated [the] children \r\n  or allow[ed] them to manipulate her.â€Â  The court ordered the mother to be incarcerated \r\n  for a period of 60 days and to pay a fine of $1500.00.Â  However, the court allowed \r\n  the mother to purge these sanctions in the following manner: (1) by delivering \r\n  the children to the father for visitation on the following day; (2) by paying \r\n  $2,039.00 to the father for the cost of the replacement airline tickets; (3) \r\n  by paying $1050.00 to the father for the substitute veterinarian to cover his \r\n  practice during the time he would have been on the vacation; and (4) by paying \r\n  a $750 fine to the Georgetown County Clerk of Court.Â  Additionally, the mother \r\n  was ordered to pay attorney fees and costs in the amount of $2126.70.\r\nThis appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA finding of contempt rests within the family courtâ€™s \r\n  sound discretion.Â  Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 63, 552 S.E.2d \r\n  329, 337 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  This court will reverse the family courtâ€™s determination \r\n  regarding contempt only if it is without evidentiary support or is an abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Finding of Willful Contempt\r\nThe mother first argues that the family \r\n  court erred in finding her in willful contempt for withholding visitation.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nA party may be found in contempt of court for willfully \r\n  violating, neglecting, or refusing to obey or perform a lawful court order.Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. 2003).Â  An act is willful if it is â€œdone voluntarily \r\n  and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, \r\n  or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; \r\n  that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€ Spartanburg \r\n  County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, \r\n  874 (1988).Â  â€œBefore a court may find a person in contempt, the record must \r\n  clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€Â  Henderson v. \r\n  Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1994).Â  To show contempt \r\n  for violation of a court order, the moving party must prove the existence of \r\n  a court order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance with \r\n  the order.Â  Eaddy v. Oliver, 345 S.C. 39, 42, 545 S.E.2d 830, 832 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).Â  Once a prima facie showing has been made, â€œthe burden shifts to \r\n  the respondent to establish his defense and inability to comply.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nThe mother does not dispute the existence of the \r\n  court order or her noncompliance with the order.Â  Instead, she argues that the \r\n  family court failed to give proper weight to the evidence establishing her defense.Â  \r\n\r\nThe mother relies on Nash v. Byrd, 298 S.C. \r\n  530, 381 S.E.2d 913 (Ct. App. 1989), for the proposition that unilateral withholding \r\n  of visitation in violation of a court order does not constitute contempt of \r\n  court where a child is suffering from the ill effects of the conduct of the \r\n  opposing parent.Â  In Nash, this court found that the father had â€œengaged \r\n  in a course of conduct calculated to harass the mother and gain information \r\n  to support a change of custody.â€Â  Id. at 532, 381 S.E.2d at 914.Â  The \r\n  father and his family stalked the mother, made derogatory remarks toward or \r\n  about her in front of the child, and encouraged the child to make false allegations \r\n  of abuse and neglect against the mother.Â  The child developed gastrointestinal \r\n  problems as a result of anxiety caused by the fatherâ€™s actions.Â  He eventually \r\n  refused to go with his father for scheduled visitation.Â  Prior to the cessation \r\n  in visitation, the wife had brought two actions for modification of visitation \r\n  and restraining orders due to the father and his familyâ€™s conduct.Â  The family \r\n  court denied the fatherâ€™s action to have the mother held in contempt for refusing \r\n  visitation.Â  In affirming the family court, this court found the family court \r\n  did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the problems were caused by \r\n  the father and that the mother had taken all reasonable steps to resolve the \r\n  problems.Â  Id. at 534, 381 S.E.2d at 916.\r\nWe find Nash clearly distinguishable from \r\n  the present case.Â  Here, the mother waited until the day the father was to start \r\n  an extended visitation, which she knew included a vacation to the Bahamas, before \r\n  dropping the letter off to the father informing him that he would not have his \r\n  visitation with his daughters.Â  Furthermore, unlike in Nash, there is \r\n  no evidence of wrongful conduct by the father causing ill effects on the older \r\n  daughter.Â  According to Dr. Kollar, the older daughter was experiencing distress \r\n  thinking about going to her fatherâ€™s for visitation.Â  He stated that she related \r\n  feeling powerless because she has little to say in what she and her sister do \r\n  during visitation.Â  She also told him that she was distressed because her father \r\n  does not allow her to go to the barn where the girls take riding lessons and \r\n  she was afraid he would not allow her to participate in upcoming horse shows.Â  \r\n  Dr. Kollar did not advise that the father not be allowed to visit with his daughters.Â  \r\n  Rather, Dr. Kollar stated that the mother should not have to physically force \r\n  the daughters to go to their father.Â  He explained that it was up to the father \r\n  to work out these issues with the children in family therapy.Â  \r\nWe note the motherâ€™s interference with the fatherâ€™s \r\n  visitation was not unexpected.Â  In the divorce decree, the family court stated \r\n  that it shared the fatherâ€™s concern that the mother had attempted to alienate \r\n  the childrenâ€™s affections from him in order to receive custody.Â  The court found:\r\n\r\nThe Wife is a very bright and well-organized woman who can \r\n  be very indiscreet when she sets her mind on achieving a desired result.Â  She \r\n  will do almost anything to get what she wants.Â  There is also an indication \r\n  that the Wife has tried to interfere with the Husbandâ€™s visitation with his \r\n  daughters.Â  This Court is concerned that if the Wife is awarded custody, the \r\n  Husbandâ€™s relationship with his daughters and their relationship with him will \r\n  suffer, especially if the Husband were to remarry.Â  \r\n\r\nDespite these expressed reservations, the family \r\n  court awarded the mother custody, but granted the father more than standard \r\n  visitation to aid him in fostering a closer relationship with his daughters.Â  \r\n\r\nWe hold the family court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in determining the mother had willfully withheld visitation from the father.Â  \r\n  As the family court found, the mother had failed to introduce evidence to support \r\n  the allegation that the older child suffered harm as a result of visitation \r\n  with the father, and further found that she had offered no credible evidence \r\n  as to why she had denied visitation of the youngest child.Â  Moreover, as the \r\n  family court noted, the mother did not call the situation to the attention of \r\n  the court before taking action.Â  Instead, she acted unilaterally and in knowing \r\n  violation of the court order.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not \r\n  err in holding the mother in willful contempt.Â  \r\nII. Procedural Due Process Violation\r\nThe mother argues that she was denied procedural \r\n  due process in that she was never personally served with the Rule to Show Cause, \r\n  and that the hearing was held less than 24 hours after she received notice of \r\n  the hearing.Â  As the mother admits in her reply brief, she did not contest the \r\n  personal jurisdiction of the family court and did not make a formal motion for \r\n  a continuance.Â  While the mother did request and obtain a ruling as to whether \r\n  the affidavit of Dr. Kollar would be admitted into evidence in part on the grounds \r\n  that Dr. Kollar himself was unavailable on such short notice, the mother did \r\n  not object to the fairness of the hearing itself on due process grounds.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find the motherâ€™s argument is not preserved.Â  See Bakala v. Bakala, \r\n  352 S.C. 612, 625, 576 S.E.2d 156, 163 (2003) (â€œA due process claim raised for \r\n  the first time on appeal is not preserved.â€).\r\nIII. Excessive Fees, Costs, and Fines\r\nThe motherâ€™s final argument is that the fees, costs, \r\n  and fines imposed by the family court were excessive.Â  \r\nThe mother challenges the family courtâ€™s imposition \r\n  of a fine payable to the court contending the imposition of a criminal sanction \r\n  was inappropriate and excessive in a civil contempt proceeding.Â  There is no \r\n  indication in the record that the mother raised this issue to the family court \r\n  at the hearing or in a post-trial motion.Â  Accordingly, it is not preserved.Â  \r\n  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt \r\n  is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but \r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for \r\n  appellate review.â€); Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 60, \r\n  427 S.E.2d 673, 675 (1993) (stating that although the appellant learned for \r\n  the first time upon receiving the order on a post-trial motion that the respondent \r\n  would be granted certain additional relief, the appellant must move under Rule \r\n  59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment to â€œpreserve the record for appealâ€).\r\nThe mother next contends the family courtâ€™s award of \r\n  costs and attorneyâ€™s fees to the father was not supported by the record. This \r\n  issue is not properly before this court because the wife failed to present this \r\n  issue in her statement of the issues on appeal.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), \r\n  SCACR (â€œOrdinarily, no point will be considered which is not set forth in the \r\n  statement of the issues on appeal.â€).Â Â Â  \r\nFurthermore, the mother failed to raise several of \r\n  the points contained in this section of her brief to the family court.Â  The \r\n  mother complains on appeal that the father was not entitled to reimbursement \r\n  for the veterinary help he had hired because it was an expense he would have \r\n  incurred even if visitation had begun as scheduled.Â  The mother never argued \r\n  to the family court that the father was not entitled to this expense.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  it is not preserved.Â  See Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d \r\n  at 733.\r\nSimilarly, the mother never argued to the family court \r\n  that the father was not entitled to all of his attorneyâ€™s fees, nor did she \r\n  object to the admission of the fatherâ€™s affidavit of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Thus, \r\n  this issue is not preserved.Â  See Id. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733.Â  \r\n  Moreover, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees to \r\n  the father.Â  A contemnor may be required to reimburse a complainant for the \r\n  costs he or she incurred in enforcing the courtâ€™s prior order, including reasonable \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 114, 502 S.E.2d 86, \r\n  90 (1998).Â  â€œIt is well settled that an award of attorney fees is within the \r\n  sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse \r\n  of that discretion.â€Â  Smith v. Smith, 308 S.C. 492, 496, 419 S.E.2d 232, \r\n  234-35 (Ct. App. 1992).Â Â Â  \r\nFinally, the mother argues the family court erred in \r\n  awarding the father $2,039.00 for having to change his airline tickets to the \r\n  Bahamas.Â  She asserts there is no indication that the tickets were non-refundable.Â  \r\n  The father explained that he was not able to change the tickets because he did \r\n  not know when he was going to get the children and be able to leave for the \r\n  Bahamas.Â  The father presented into evidence the airline tickets and his testimony \r\n  of the expenses he had incurred due to the change of departure date.Â  \r\nâ€œCompensatory contempt is a money award for the \r\n  plaintiff when the defendant has injured the plaintiff by violating a previous \r\n  court order.â€Â  Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 386, 287 S.E.2d 915, 919 \r\n  (1982).Â  The goal of compensatory contempt awards is to restore the plaintiff \r\n  as nearly as possible to his or her original position.Â  Id.Â  We hold \r\n  the family court judge did not err in finding that these expenses were reasonable \r\n  and necessary to restore the father to his original position.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the above reasons, we hold the order of \r\n  the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  According to Dr. Kollar, trichotillomania is a \r\n    self-destructive behavior involving the recurrent pulling of oneâ€™s hair as \r\n    a means of relief from anxiety.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-548","title":"Stewart v.

Taggart, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General W. Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia, and Solicitor \r\n  Cecil Kelley Jackson, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Tyson Mack appeals his second-degree \r\n  burglary conviction, arguing the trial court erred in refusing to grant him \r\n  a directed verdict.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nOfficers Evans and Kearney of the Sumter \r\n  Police Department were dispatched to a sportswear store at 4:20 a.m.Â  When they \r\n  arrived at the store, they learned it had been broken into and clothing had \r\n  been removed.Â  They immediately began a search of the area and quickly located \r\n  Mack in a nearby vacant lot.Â  He was carrying a large trash bag, sweating, and \r\n  breathing heavily.Â  The officers stopped and as Evans approached, Mack dropped \r\n  the bag, which contained a large amount of clothes on hangers with the tags \r\n  still on them.Â  The officers then arrested Mack.Â  The police later showed the \r\n  clothes to the storeâ€™s owner, who identified them as his merchandise.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMack concedes the State presented evidence \r\n  he was guilty of receiving or possessing stolen goods and does not dispute the \r\n  sportswear store was burglarized.Â  However, he contends he was entitled to a \r\n  directed verdict on the burglary charge because the State failed to establish \r\n  he was the person who broke into the store.Â  We find the court properly denied \r\n  Mackâ€™s motion.\r\nIn ruling on a directed verdict motion, \r\n  the trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence, rather than with \r\n  its weight.Â  State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 \r\n  (2000).Â  â€œA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails \r\n  to produce any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence of the offense \r\n  charged.â€Â  State v. Rothschild, 351 S.C. 238, 243, 569 S.E.2d 346, 348 \r\n  (2002).Â  Where the evidence is circumstantial, the court must submit the case \r\n  to the jury if there is substantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove \r\n  the defendantâ€™s guilt or from which guilt can be logically deduced.Â  State \r\n  v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 332, 468 S.E.2d 626, 629 (1996).Â  On appeal from \r\n  the denial of a directed verdict, this court reviews the evidence in the light \r\n  most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  State v. Asbury, 328 S.C. 187, \r\n  194, 493 S.E.2d 349, 353 (1997).Â  \r\nIn State v. Shields, 217 S.C. 496, 61 S.E.2d \r\n  56 (1950), our supreme court affirmed the denial of a directed verdict on a \r\n  burglary charge where the defendant was found in possession of recently stolen \r\n  goods taken during an undisputed burglary.Â  \r\nHere, as in Shields, Mack was found in possession \r\n  of recently stolen goods taken during an undisputed burglary.Â  The incident \r\n  occurred in the very early hours of the morning, and the officers responding \r\n  to the complaint arrived at the scene quickly.Â  They spotted Mack approximately \r\n  a block away from the burglarized business and the record contains no evidence \r\n  any other individual was in the vicinity at that time.Â  When the officers approached \r\n  Mack, he dropped the large bag he was carrying, which contained the stolen clothes, \r\n  still on hangers and bearing the storeâ€™s tags.Â  Viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the State, this constitutes substantial evidence from which Mackâ€™s guilt \r\n  could be deduced.Â  Thus the trial court properly submitted the charge to the \r\n  jury.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nStilwell, Beatty, and Short, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule \r\n    215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-550","title":"Lee v.

Jennings and R. Hawthorne Barrett, both of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant-Respondent.\r\nStephen B. Samuels and Joseph R. Dasta, both of Lexington, \r\n  for Respondents-Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This action arises from a traffic \r\n  accident involving John David Lee (Lee) and Robert Allen Bunch.Â  Lee, his wife \r\n  Kathleen Newman Lee (Mrs. Lee), and Bunch appeal, challenging various rulings \r\n  of the trial court.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe traffic accident between Lee and Bunch \r\n  occurred on September 19, 1997, at approximately 10:30 p.m. While riding his \r\n  motorcycle on Old Dunbar Road, Lee collided with a Cadillac El Dorado driven \r\n  by Bunch.Â  Leeâ€™s motorcycle hit the driverâ€™s side of the Cadillac, which was \r\n  situated perpendicularly across the road.Â  Bunch was uninjured by the accident \r\n  and exited the vehicle through the passenger-side door.Â  Lee, however, was seriously \r\n  injured.\r\nAt trial, the parties presented contradictory accounts \r\n  of how the accident happened. Bunch testified that on the evening of the accident, \r\n  his then-fiancÃ©e, Joanne Hankinson, called him at his sisterâ€™s house and asked \r\n  him to bring her dinner and a tube of lip-stick to the bar where she worked, \r\n  Johnny Bâ€™s.Â  Bunch borrowed his sisterâ€™s Cadillac, purchased the lipstick at \r\n  a grocery store near the bar, and proceeded down Old Dunbar Road to the bar.Â  \r\n  He stated he was attempting to make a wide left turn into the parking lot of \r\n  Johnny Bâ€™s when Leeâ€™s motorcycle collided with the car.Â  In his deposition, \r\n  Bunch testified that it was still daylight when the accident occurred.Â  At trial, \r\n  he vacillated on the time from when he borrowed the Cadillac until the accident \r\n  occurred.Â  \r\nLee testified that he had left a family birthday \r\n  celebration at Murrayâ€™s, a bar and grill, shortly before the accident occurred.Â  \r\n  He stated that he remembered seeing a moving blur shortly before everything \r\n  went black but he did not remember the impact at all.Â  Gregory Jones and Chong \r\n  Abernathy, who witnessed the accident, testified about what they observed that \r\n  night.Â  Abernathy testified that when she and Jones left the bar Abernathy owned \r\n  between 7:00 and 7:30 that evening to go to dinner, Bunchâ€™s Cadillac was parked \r\n  on the shoulder of the road in front of a mailbox.Â  When they returned from \r\n  dinner several hours later, the Cadillac was still parked there.Â Â  Abernathy \r\n  and Jones testified the Cadillac slowly pulled into the road.Â  Abernathy stated \r\n  it appeared that the driver of the Cadillac was attempting a U-turn when the \r\n  accident happened.Â  \r\nAn ambulance arrived at approximately \r\n  10:45 p.m.Â  Though slightly disoriented, Mr. Lee was conscious and related pain \r\n  he felt as the emergency medical technicians (E.M.T.â€™s) splinted his arms and \r\n  legs.Â  While the E.M.T.â€™s were tending to Mr. Leeâ€™s injuries, Trooper Paul Allen \r\n  Nelson of the South Carolina Highway Patrol arrived on the scene and began investigating \r\n  the accident by observing the condition of the vehicles, their relative positions \r\n  on the road, and the debris caused by the impact.Â  Trooper Nelson later met \r\n  with Lee after he had been taken by ambulance to the emergency room.Â  During \r\n  their conversation at the hospital, Trooper Nelson smelled alcohol on Lee and \r\n  asked whether he had been drinking prior to the accident.Â  Lee responded in \r\n  the affirmative.Â  Trooper Nelson arranged for a sample of Leeâ€™s blood to be \r\n  taken by hospital personnel and tested by SLED for alcohol content.Â  The test \r\n  indicated Lee had a blood alcohol level of 0.036%.Â  \r\nLee had numerous broken bones, a head \r\n  injury, and severe injury to his groin area.Â  He spent ten days in the hospital \r\n  and several months recuperating while he and his family lived with his parents.Â  \r\n  Because of his injuries, he was not able to return to his job performing home \r\n  remodeling and interior repair work with his father.Â  Instead, he became a licensed \r\n  cosmetologist and works in his motherâ€™s salon.Â  \r\nOn March 28, 2000, Lee and his wife, Kathleen \r\n  Newman Lee, brought suit against Bunch \r\n  [1]  in the Orangeburg County Court of Common Pleas, alleging Bunch negligently \r\n  pulled out from a parking space into the roadway, thereby causing the accident \r\n  and Leeâ€™s resulting injuries.Â  Mrs. Lee sought to recover for loss of consortium.Â  \r\n  While Bunch denied all allegations of negligence in his answer, the pleading \r\n  contained no assertion of comparative negligence as an affirmative defense.Â  \r\n\r\nPrior to trial, the Lees moved to exclude \r\n  any evidence of Leeâ€™s consumption of alcohol before the accident.Â  The trial \r\n  court denied the motion, ruling testimony of alcohol consumption would be probative \r\n  as to the determination of liability.Â  At trial, after Lee testified, Bunch \r\n  moved to amend his answer to include the affirmative defense of comparative \r\n  negligence.Â  In support of the motion, Bunchâ€™s trial counsel noted that Lee \r\n  testified that he had consumed alcohol and testimony of other witnesses corroborated \r\n  the fact.Â  The trial court granted the motion.Â  \r\nAfter deliberating, the jury returned a verdict \r\n  of comparative negligence, assigning 70% of the fault to Lee and 30% to Bunch.Â  \r\n  Having found Lee more than 50% at fault, the jury awarded no damages to Lee.Â  \r\n  The jury also returned a defense verdict on Mrs. Leeâ€™s claim for loss of consortium.Â  \r\n  Counsel for the Lees argued the verdicts were inconsistent in that Mrs. Lee \r\n  was entitled to recover damages on account of the juryâ€™s finding that Bunch \r\n  was partially negligent on Leeâ€™s claim.Â  The judge agreed and ordered the jury \r\n  to resume deliberations with instructions to award some amount of damages to \r\n  Mrs. Lee.Â  After deliberating again, the jury returned with a verdict for Mrs. \r\n  Lee in the amount of $9,000.00.Â  \r\nIn a post-trial motions hearing, Lee moved for \r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial.Â  Mrs. Lee moved for \r\n  a new trial nisi additur or a new trial absolute.Â  Bunch moved for reinstatement \r\n  of the original defense verdict against Mrs. Lee.Â  By order filed September \r\n  24, 2002, the trial court denied each of the post-trial motions.Â  Bunch and \r\n  the Lees appealed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n The Lees argue the trial court erred in \r\n  denying their motion to exclude evidence of Mr. Leeâ€™s alcohol consumption before \r\n  the accident.Â  We agree.\r\nA trial courtâ€™s ruling on admission of evidence \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent abuse of discretion amounting to error \r\n  of law.Â  Hoeffner v. The Citadel, 311 S.C. 361, 365, 429 S.E.2d 190, \r\n  192 (1993).Â  â€œEvidence is relevant and admissible if it tends to establish or \r\n  make more or less probable some matter in issue.â€Â  Id. at 365, 429 S.E.2d \r\n  at 192.Â  â€œHowever, otherwise relevant evidence may be excluded where its probative \r\n  value is â€˜substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion \r\n  of the issues, or misleading the jury . . . .â€™â€Â  Kennedy v. Griffin, \r\n  358 S.C. 122, 127, 595 S.E.2d 248, 250 (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Rule 403, SCRE).Â Â  \r\n  â€œUnfair prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper \r\n  basis.â€Â  Id. (quoting State v. Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 666, 552 S.E.2d \r\n  745, 760 (2001).Â  \r\nIn Kennedy, this court held the trial court \r\n  had abused its discretion in allowing the admission into evidence of toxicology \r\n  results showing the presence of marijuana in the plaintiff motoristâ€™s system, \r\n  finding the unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of the evidence.Â  \r\n  The court found the plaintiffâ€™s mere delay in applying his brakes did not necessarily \r\n  suggest that he was driving under an impairment.Â  Thus the court concluded, \r\n  â€œUnder these circumstances, evidence of the mere presence of marijuana, without \r\n  further indication of impairment, could mislead the jury.Â  The admission of \r\n  this evidence was more prejudicial than probative because there was no correlation \r\n  between the marijuana and the accident.â€Â  Kennedy, 358 S.C. at 128, 595 \r\n  S.E.2d at 251.\r\nThe Lees argue that probative value of \r\n  the evidence of alcohol consumption was outweighed by its prejudicial effect \r\n  because under the driving under the influence statute, Lee, with blood alcohol \r\n  level of 0.036%, would be conclusively presumed to not be under the influence \r\n  of alcohol. [2] Â Even the higher \r\n  alcohol levels Bunchâ€™s expert witnesses calculated Lee may have had when the \r\n  accident occurred [3]  would not \r\n  have created an inference that Lee was under the influence of alcohol under \r\n  the statute in effect at the time of the accident. \r\n  [4] Â  \r\nThere is no evidence that Lee showed any signs of impairment.Â  \r\n  Leeâ€™s mother testified that when her son told her goodbye at Murrayâ€™s, he appeared \r\n  fine and did not appear intoxicated.Â  There is also no evidence in the record \r\n  that Lee was driving erratically before the accident.Â  Leeâ€™s sister testified \r\n  that when Lee was driving away from the restaurant, there was nothing unusual \r\n  in his driving.Â  Although there was some testimony the accident occurred slightly \r\n  left of the centerline, there is no evidence that Lee was driving across the \r\n  line before the accident.Â  \r\nBunchâ€™s expert witnesses both testified to the \r\n  general effects of the consumption of the amount of alcohol would have on a \r\n  person of Leeâ€™s size.Â  Dr. Eagerton testified that the amount of alcohol he \r\n  calculated Lee had consumed would have impaired a personâ€™s judgment and ability \r\n  to multi-task, making his ability to drive impaired.Â  Dr. Merlin testified that \r\n  a person who had consumed that much alcohol would have diminished functioning, \r\n  such as poor judgment, inability to do some fine motor skills, and the significantly \r\n  diminished ability to multi-task.Â  However, neither of Bunchâ€™s experts testified \r\n  to a connection between Leeâ€™s alcohol consumption and the cause of the accident.Â  \r\n  They did not testify that absent the alcohol consumption, Lee would have been \r\n  able to avoid the accident, which happened in â€œmaybe a couple of seconds, more \r\n  or less, a split secondâ€ according to Chong Abernathy, who witnessed the accident.Â  \r\n  As she explained, â€œI donâ€™t think the motorcycle had [any] time to avoid any \r\n  of the the â€“no matter which angle, he was going to hit the Cadillac.â€Â  \r\nOther than the expertsâ€™ generalizations, there is simply \r\n  no evidence that Lee was impaired.Â  Moreover, there is no evidence at all that \r\n  absent the consumption of alcohol, it was â€œless probableâ€ that the accident \r\n  would have occurred.Â  \r\nWhile the probative value of the alcohol consumption \r\n  is at best slight, the prejudicial effect of the admission of the evidence is \r\n  significant.Â  Bunchâ€™s attorney made Leeâ€™s alcohol consumption the theme of his \r\n  opening statement, emphasizing repeatedly that this was a case about drinking \r\n  and driving.Â  We find the prejudicial effect of the admission of the evidence \r\n  regarding Leeâ€™s alcohol consumption greatly outweighed its probative value.Â  \r\n  Thus, we hold the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the admission \r\n  of the evidence concerning Leeâ€™s alcohol consumption.Â  \r\nAs we hold the trial court erred in admitting the \r\n  evidence of Leeâ€™s alcohol consumption, we need not address the partiesâ€™ remaining \r\n  issues.Â  Accordingly, the juryâ€™s verdict is reversed and the case remanded for \r\n  a new trial on the Leesâ€™ claims.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The Lees also named Mr. Bunchâ€™s sister, Catherine Bunch Graham, who \r\n    owned the Cadillac, as a defendant.Â  She was dismissed from the suit prior \r\n    to trial and is not a party to this appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  South Carolina Code Annotated Section 56-5-2950(b)(1) (Supp. 2003), \r\n    provides:Â  If the alcohol concentration was at that time five one-hundredths \r\n    of one percent or less, it is conclusively presumed that the person was not \r\n    under the influence of alcohol.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] David Eagerton, the chief toxicologist for the South Carolina Law \r\n    Enforcement Division (SLED) testified that he calculated Lee had an approximate \r\n    alcohol level of 0.066% at the time of the accident because the sample was \r\n    taken at least two hours after the accident, assuming Lee was in the elimination \r\n    stage then.Â  Similarly, Dr. Stephen Merlin, the director of the chemical dependency \r\n    unit at Palmetto Richland Springs Hospital, testified that according to his \r\n    calculations, Leeâ€™s blood alcohol level ranged from 0.066% to 0.096% between \r\n    the time of the accident and the time the sample was taken.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The statute in effect at the time of the accident provided:Â  \r\n  \r\n  If the [alcohol] concentration \r\n    was at that time in excess of five one-hundredths of one percent, that fact \r\n    does not give rise to any inference that the person was or was not under the \r\n    influence of alcohol, but that fact may be considered with other evidence \r\n    in determining guilt or innocence of the person.Â  \r\n  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950 \r\n    (Supp. 2002).Â  This section was amended in 2003 to provide that an alcohol \r\n    level of eight one-hundredths or more gives rise to an inference of intoxication.Â  \r\n    Act No. 61, 2003 Acts 688.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-551","title":"Saverance v.

Marvin Mullis, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service and The \r\n  Hartford (collectively Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  affirmance of the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s \r\n  order setting the compensation rate for claimant Ricky Saverance and ask this \r\n  court to set-off any award by the amount in excess of the correct compensation \r\n  rate they have already paid.Â  We affirm. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nRicky Saverance owned and operated his own carpet installation \r\n  business, working as a subcontractor for Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service from 1996 \r\n  until 1998.Â  In 1998, Saverance was injured as he attempted to stretch carpet.Â  \r\n  He missed the knee kicker and knocked out a doorjamb with the top of his knee.Â  \r\n  Saverance has been out of work and had two knee surgeries since the accident.Â  \r\n  The knee injury has also resulted in an altered gait and, subsequently, a back \r\n  injury.Â  \r\nThough a subcontractor, Saverance is covered by Williamsâ€™ Carpet Serviceâ€™s \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation insurance.Â  On October 27, 1998, Saveranceâ€™s workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation claim was accepted and temporary total benefits at the maximum \r\n  weekly compensation rate for 1998, $465.18, were initiated.Â  This compensation \r\n  rate was based on the assumption that Saverance was an employee, and, therefore, \r\n  entitled to an average weekly wage and corresponding compensation rate based \r\n  on his gross income.Â  \r\nAfter Saverance reached maximum medical improvement, Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service \r\n  filed a form 21 request to terminate weekly benefits and enter a permanent disability \r\n  award.Â  Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service also requested reduction of Saveranceâ€™s compensation \r\n  rate on the basis that he was not actually an employee, but a subcontractor, \r\n  and, therefore, the compensation rate should have been based on his net as opposed \r\n  to gross income.Â  Finally, Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service requested a set-off based \r\n  on any difference between the actual past payments and any reduced compensation \r\n  rate.Â  \r\nA hearing was held before the workersâ€™ compensation commissioner on April 26, \r\n  2001, to determine the extent of Saveranceâ€™s permanent disability and to calculate \r\n  the average weekly wage and applicable compensation rate.Â  The commissioner \r\n  set the average weekly wage and compensation rate as $388.40 and $258.94 respectively.Â  \r\n  However, the commissioner declined to grant a set-off based on the difference \r\n  between the actual compensation rate and what was paid beginning in October \r\n  1998.Â  Instead, the commissioner did allow a set-off from the time Williamsâ€™ \r\n  Carpet Service filed the form 21.Â  Furthermore, the commissioner found Saverance \r\n  had a 35% loss of use of his right leg and 10% loss of use of his back.Â  \r\nThe commissionerâ€™s findings were appealed by both parties to the workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  commission appellate panel.Â  There, the commission affirmed and reversed in \r\n  part.Â  The commission determined that due to the injury and his total loss of \r\n  earning capacity, Saverance is permanently and totally disabled.Â  The commission \r\n  also reinstated the maximum compensation rate for 1998 of $465.18, noting payments \r\n  were made at that rate for over two years and â€œ[e]ven though the correct AWW \r\n  [average weekly wage] and CR [compensation rate] remain open until such time \r\n  as there is an order of the commission, this panel finds that the rate at which \r\n  benefits were paid is an equitable rate.â€Â  \r\nWilliamsâ€™ Carpet Service appealed to the circuit court the issues of permanent \r\n  and total disability as well as the commissionâ€™s determination regarding the \r\n  average weekly wage.Â  The circuit court affirmed the commissionâ€™s findings.Â  \r\n  Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service appeals part of this decision.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard \r\n  of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  \r\n  Lark v. Bi-Lo, 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  This court \r\n  can reverse or modify the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision only if the appellantâ€™s \r\n  substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by \r\n  an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, \r\n  and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, \r\n  341 S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor \r\n  evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, \r\n  as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the [Appellate Panel] \r\n  reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  The possibility \r\n  of drawing two inconsistent conclusions does not prevent the Appellate Panelâ€™s \r\n  conclusions from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l \r\n  Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999).\r\nThe Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder in \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation cases and is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings \r\n  of fact.Â  Ross v. American Red Cross, 298 S.C. 490, 492, 381 S.E.2d 728, \r\n  730 (1989).Â  â€œThe final determination of witness credibility and the weight \r\n  to be accorded evidence is reserved to the [Appellate Panel].Â  It is not the \r\n  task of this Court to weigh the evidence as found by the [Appellate Panel].â€Â  \r\n  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWilliamsâ€™ Carpet Service appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order on the basis that \r\n  the compensation rate is in error and it would be unjust to allow Saverance \r\n  to retain any difference created by a lowering of the compensation rate.Â  We \r\n  disagree and affirm the compensation rate as set by the workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  commission.Â  \r\n\r\n1.Â  The commissionâ€™s compensation rate was not error.\r\n\r\nWilliamsâ€™ Carpet Service argues the commissionâ€™s compensation \r\n  rate is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial \r\n  evidence of the whole record.Â  In contrast, we find a record with contradictory \r\n  evidence regarding Saveranceâ€™s average weekly wage; however, when viewed in \r\n  its totality, this evidence suggests an average weekly wage that supports the \r\n  maximum compensation rate.Â  Because there is substantial evidence supporting \r\n  the full commissionâ€™s decision, we affirm.\r\nThe goal of workersâ€™ compensation is to set an approximate \r\n  earnings capacity had claimant not been injured.Â  Sellers v. Pinedale Residential \r\n  Ctr., 350 S.C. 183, 191, 564 S.E.2d 694, 698 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  A subcontractorâ€™s \r\n  compensation rate should be based on net rather than gross earnings.Â  Stephen \r\n  v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 347, 478 S.E.2d 74, 81 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n\r\nThe difficulty caused by this case is that Williamsâ€™ Carpet \r\n  Services has challenged the compensation rate, and it is difficult to clearly \r\n  show what Saverance as a subcontractor â€œearned.â€Â  The average compensation rate \r\n  approved by the full commission was $465.18.Â  The rule for calculating the compensation \r\n  rate on form 20 requires multiplying the average weekly wage by the factor of \r\n  .6667 to reach the compensation rate.Â  Therefore, the average weekly wage would \r\n  have been a minimum of $697.74 for the average compensation rate to be $465.18.Â  \r\n\r\nSaveranceâ€™s average weekly wage can be calculated in several \r\n  ways according to his tax returns.Â  The net income on Saveranceâ€™s tax return \r\n  was $3,650.Â  The average weekly rate after expenses would be $86.90, $3,650 \r\n  divided by 42 weeks.Â  However, counsel for Williamsâ€™ Carpet admitted this argument \r\n  for a minimum compensation rate was made â€œtongue [in] cheekâ€.Â  The gross income \r\n  on the income tax return was $39,371, which would be $937.40 per week when divided \r\n  by 42 weeks.Â  However, the $937.40 gross pay does not take into account expenses \r\n  Saverance incurred.Â  It is not simply a case of looking at the total amount \r\n  paid to Saverance by Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service, because out of this money Saverance \r\n  had to pay helpers and purchase supplies.Â  \r\nOn top of contradictory results based on his tax returns, \r\n  Saverance testified 10% of his gross payments had been taken by Williamsâ€™ Carpet \r\n  Service to pay workersâ€™ compensation insurance premiums and he had paid approximately \r\n  $4,400 during the 42 weeks prior to his injury.Â  This would suggest that Saverance \r\n  earned $1,047.60 gross pay per week. [2] Â  Additionally, a vocational rehabilitation \r\n  expert for Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service presented evidence that the average hourly \r\n  wage for a carpet installer in South Carolina was $9.71.Â  This hourly wage would \r\n  support an average weekly wage of $388 and was entered into evidence pursuant \r\n  to section 42-1-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003).Â  The hourly wage \r\n  of a carpet installer would not, however, be that of a subcontractor with installers \r\n  working for him.\r\nMr. Williams of Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service also testified that \r\n  Saverance was among his top subcontractors, he could make more than ten dollars \r\n  an hour, and could gross more than four hundred dollars a week.Â  Later, before \r\n  the circuit court, defense counsel conceded that Saverance â€œwas grossing a substantial \r\n  amount of money per week, you know, 900, $800, a thousand dollars, $700 a week, \r\n  which would, you know, entitle him to the maximum compensation rate.â€Â  \r\nThe record is \r\n  replete with conflicting and contradictory evidence regarding the average weekly \r\n  wage.Â  However, there is evidence that Saveranceâ€™s gross weekly wage exceeded \r\n  $1,000.Â  Additionally, the record is devoid of any serious valuation of Saveranceâ€™s \r\n  work-related expenses.Â  By awarding Saverance the maximum weekly wage, the commission \r\n  must have determined his expenses did not exceed $300.Â  Decisions of fact are \r\n  beyond the purview of the appellate court as long as there is substantial evidence \r\n  supporting the commissionâ€™s decision.Â  We find the compensation rate was properly \r\n  and appropriately set.Â  As there is no difference in payments made, Williamsâ€™ \r\n  Carpet Service second argument is rendered moot.\r\nAdditionally, \r\n  Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service argues the circuit court erred in finding the average \r\n  weekly wage to be $465.18.Â  However, it is clear from a review of the record \r\n  and the entirety of the order that this was a scrivener error and in fact the \r\n  court supported the commissionâ€™s determination that the compensation rate \r\n  was $465.18.Â  See State v. George, 331 S.C. 342, 347, 503 S.E.2d \r\n  168, 171&nbsp;(1998) (â€œWe note that the circuit courtâ€™s order incorrectly refers \r\n  to Dr. Albiniakâ€™s testimony concerning African Americans making up more than \r\n  13% of the â€˜voting and driving population.â€™ This statement--that the percentage \r\n  was based on voting and driving population--is directly contradicted \r\n  by the record, so we assume this was a scrivenerâ€™s error.â€).\r\n\r\n2.Â  Unjust Enrichment\r\n\r\nWilliamsâ€™ Carpet Service argues if the compensation rate \r\n  was in error, the doctrine of unjust enrichment requires Williamsâ€™ Carpet Service \r\n  be given credit for payments made pursuant to the higher, erroneous compensation \r\n  rate.Â  Because of our decision that the higher compensation rate was supported \r\n  by substantial evidence, it is not necessary to reach this argument.Â  See \r\n  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, \r\n  613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining \r\n  issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the decision of the circuit \r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We \r\n    decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    $4,400 divided by 42 weeks equals $104.76.Â  $104.76 is ten percent of $1,047.60.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
