McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Lance S.

Pachak, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Roywickus Cade filed an application for post-conviction relief (â€œPCRâ€), seeking to vacate his conviction and fifteen-year sentence for armed robbery.[1]Â  While the PCR judge found Cadeâ€™s trial counsel was not ineffective, he found appellate defense counsel was so and granted Cade a new trial rather than another opportunity to seek appellate review.Â  The State appeals.Â  We granted certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s decision.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.[2]\r\nThe facts surrounding Cadeâ€™s conviction and sentence, which stem from the robbery of a convenience store, may be found in State v. Cade, Op. No. 02-UP-196 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 14, 2002).\r\n1.Â  We first address the issue of whether the PCR judge erred in allowing Cade, over the Stateâ€™s objection, to amend his claim during the post-conviction hearing to assert appellate counsel provided Cade â€œineffective assistance.â€\r\nThe PCR judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on November 15, 2004.Â  Near the start of the hearing, Cadeâ€™s PCR counsel indicated Cadeâ€™s application for PCR included an allegation that both his trial and appellate counsel gave Cade ineffective assistance.Â  When, during Cadeâ€™s testimony the issue of appellate counselâ€™s effectiveness resurfaced, counsel for the State objected, contending that the issue had not been raised in Cadeâ€™s application, that Cadeâ€™s accompanying memorandum referenced only the allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and that Cade had not filed any additional memorandums in the two-year period between the filing of his application and the date of the hearing that alleged ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.Â  Counsel underscored the Stateâ€™s objection, saying, â€œI feel like weâ€™re just getting this sprung on us today . . . .â€\r\nIn response, Cade argued that, because his application listed the name of his appellate counsel and included a citation to Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1977) and Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977),[3] it was sufficient to infer therefrom an allegation of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\r\nThe PCR judge, in effect, allowed Cade to go forward with his challenge to the representation afforded him by appellate counsel, effectively amending Cadeâ€™s application.\r\nThe Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act (Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-10 to 160 (2003), governs the procedure for PCR proceedings.Â  Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 363, 527 S.E.2d 742, 746 (2000).Â  The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure also apply to PCR proceedings, but only to the extent they are not inconsistent with the Act.Â  Rule 71.1, SCRCP.Â  Under the Act, an applicant must â€œspecifically set forth the grounds upon which the application is basedâ€ and include in his or her application those facts that are within the applicantâ€™s â€œpersonal knowledgeâ€ and set them out â€œseparately from other allegations of facts.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-50 (2003).Â  The Act also requires â€œ[a]ll grounds for relief available to an applicant . . . [to] be raised in his [or her] original, supplemental, or amended application.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-90 (2003).\r\nThe Act permits the PCR judge, â€œwhen appropriate,â€ to allow an â€œamendment of the application . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. 17-27-70(a) (2003).Â  By the same token, Rule 15(a), SCRCP, permits â€œ[a] party [to] amend his [or her] pleading once as a matter of course at any time before or within 30 days after a responsive pleading is served . . . .â€Â  Beyond that, however, whether a party may amend his or her application, as with any other pleading, rests within the sound discretion of the PCR judge. Â See Simpson v. Moore, 367 S.C. 587, 599, 627 S.E.2d 701, 708 (2006) (noting a PCR judge may allow a petitioner to amend pleadings pursuant to Rule 15(b), SCRCP). Â The trial courtâ€™s decision whether to allow an amendment will not be reversed on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. Â See Mylin v. Allen-White Pontiac, Inc., 281 S.C. 174, 180, 314 S.E.2d 354, 357 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œCourts have wide latitude in amending pleadings and, while this power should not be exercised indiscriminately or to surprise or prejudice an opposing party, the matter of allowing amendments is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. His decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion or unless manifest injustice has been done.â€).\r\nWe hold the PCR judge did not abuse that discretion in this instance by allowing Cade to attack his appellate counsel and, in effect, amending his application.Â  The State failed to demonstrate any legal prejudice.Â  Indeed, the State failed to ask for a continuance and chose not to subpoena the appellate counsel in question, choosing instead to take refuge behind the requirement that the burden of proof on the issue of the insufficiency of appellate counsel lay with the applicant.\r\n2.Â  We next address whether the PCR judge erred in holding Cade was entitled to a new trial because his appellate counsel provided him ineffective assistance.Â  The PCR judge grounded his holding on appellate counselâ€™s failure to appeal issues involving the identification of Cade as a participant in the robbery for which Cade was convicted and appellate counselâ€™s failure to raise an issue â€œright on appealâ€ that related to a common scheme and plan involving a carjacking.\r\nRegarding the identification issues, and notwithstanding the PCR judgeâ€™s view that â€œtrial counsel . . . did an outstanding job in preserving these issues,â€ we are of a different opinion. Â These issues were not preserved, and, because they were not, appellate counsel cannot be faulted for not having raised them before the court of appeals.[4]Â  Legge v. State, 349 S.C. 222, 225, 562 S.E.2d 618, 620 (2002); State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003) (â€œIn order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised and ruled upon by the trial judge.â€).\r\nAs to the common scheme or plan issue not being properly raised by appellate counsel before the court of appeals, that issue also affords Cade no basis for relief.Â  To show that counsel was deficient, an applicant for post-conviction relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel must establish that counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms and the deficient performance prejudiced the applicantâ€™s case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 117-18, 386 S.E.2d 624, 625 (1989).Â  Although appellate counsel argued, and lost, before the court of appeals the issue that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Cadeâ€™s participation in a carjacking before the robbery, he failed to challenge the denial of Cadeâ€™s motion for a directed verdict at trial on the ground, argued by trial counsel, that the State did not link the carjacking to the robbery.Â  His failure to do so, however, caused Cade no prejudice.Â  Even without that evidence, other, more direct, evidence tied Cade to the robbery and thus provided sufficient evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the state, on which to base a denial of Cadeâ€™s motion for directed verdict.Â  See State v. Prince, 316 S.C. 57, 64, 447 S.E.2d 177, 181 (1993) (holding a trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State when entertaining a defendantâ€™s motion for directed verdict).\r\n3.Â  Regarding the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the PCR judge held that Cade â€œfailed to establish that his trial counsel was ineffective.â€Â  Because Cade does not appeal this holding and it is now the law of the case, we are obliged to affirm it.Â  Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 72, 615 S.E.2d 465, 474 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nREVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.\r\nHEARN, C.J., STILWELL, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Daniel T. Stacey of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense perfected an appeal on Cadeâ€™s behalf.Â  The court of appeals affirmed Cadeâ€™s conviction and sentence.Â  State v. Cade, Op.

App. Filed March 14, 2002).\r\n[[2]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] Â Cade cited both cases as they relate to the factors a court must consider in determining the reliability of identification evidence.\r\n[4]Â  Although the trial court held an in camera hearing on the photo line-ups and the identifications of Cade, Cadeâ€™s counsel at trial did not attempt to suppress the identifications on the basis that the out-of-court identifications were unreliable under Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1977).Â  The memorandum that accompanied Cadeâ€™s application even complains that â€œsince [trial] counsel failed to file a suppression motion on the [S]tateâ€™s identification testimony/evidence, this failure constituted ineffective assistance of counsel that prejudice[d] applicantâ€™s right to a fair trial and due process of law.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-372","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â \r\n  Steve R. Bagwell (â€œBagwellâ€) and Daryl Lee Spain (â€œSpainâ€) were convicted by a\r\n  jury of first degree burglary.Â  The judge sentenced Bagwell to twenty years of\r\n  confinement and Spain to fifteen years.Â  Bagwell and Spain appeal their\r\n  convictions alleging the trial judge erred in ruling inadmissible a defense\r\n  witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFacts\r\nIn\r\n  September 2003, Jarrett Armstrong (â€œArmstrongâ€) and Chris Snoddy (â€œSnoddyâ€)\r\n  shared an apartment in Greenville County, and both worked at a local Applebeeâ€™s\r\n  restaurant.Â  Bagwell and Spain shared an apartment in the same complex.\r\nOn\r\n  September 13, 2003, the day of the burglary, Armstrong worked from 5 p.m. until\r\n  10 p.m.Â  Armstrong testified he went home at 10 p.m., showered, and watched\r\n  television until driving back to Applebeeâ€™s at 11:45 p.m. to pick Snoddy up\r\n  from work.Â  Armstrong waited approximately twenty minutes for Snoddy and left\r\n  with Snoddy around 12:15 a.m. or 12:20 a.m.Â  While en route back to their\r\n  apartment, Armstrong stated he received a call from a neighbor that caused them\r\n  to hurry home.Â  A few neighbors were gathered outside their apartment when\r\n  Armstrong and Snoddy arrived.Â  \r\nArmstrong\r\n  told Snoddy to go around to the rear of the apartment because it appeared\r\n  someone was inside.Â  Armstrong said he entered the apartmentâ€™s front door and\r\n  saw Bagwell, whom Armstrong has known since elementary school, leaving through\r\n  the back glass patio door which had been shattered.Â Â Â  As Bagwell was exiting,\r\n  Armstrong yelled to Snoddy that someone was running out.Â  Armstrong reported\r\n  finding a sandal on the apartment floor that he had seen worn previously by Spain.Â  After checking the upstairs and finding nothing missing, Armstrong went outside to\r\n  check on Snoddy.\r\nSnoddy\r\n  testified that when he arrived at the back of the apartment the glass patio\r\n  door was shattered.Â  Snoddy picked up a metal pole to protect himself.Â  He\r\n  observed Spain exiting the apartment through the shattered door, and he struck Spain with the pole.Â  The two fought until Spain submitted.Â  Spain was not wearing shoes\r\n  and had numerous cuts to his feet.Â  Spain passed out when Armstrong reached the\r\n  back of the apartment.Â  \r\nArmstrong\r\n  and Snoddy then went to Bagwellâ€™s apartment to confront Bagwell.Â  Upon their\r\n  arrival, Bagwell had blood running down his face.Â  Armstrong hit Bagwell one\r\n  time before neighbors intervened.Â  Armstrong called the police.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Spain did not take the stand, but Bagwell testified that he had consumed\r\n  too much alcohol and was home asleep at the time of the incident.Â  \r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Wood, 362 S.C.\r\n  520, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577,\r\n  575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  This court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in\r\n  criminal cases.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; State v.\r\n    Young, 364 S.C. 476, 613 S.E.2d 386 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The admission of\r\n  evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 207, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006); State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d\r\n  87, 93 (2002).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial\r\n  court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.Â  Pagan,\r\n  369 S.C. at 208, 631 S.E.2d at 265; State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540\r\n  S.E.2d 464 (2000); State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 623 S.E.2d 122 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  In order for an error of law to warrant reversal, the error must\r\n  result in prejudice to the appellant.Â  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 536\r\n  S.E.2d 679 (2000); State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, 453 S.E.2d 890 (1995); State\r\n    v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 625 S.E.2d 239 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nDiscussion\r\nBagwell\r\n  and Spain argue the trial judge erred in refusing to allow Spainâ€™s brother to testify that Armstrong was angry with Spain because Spain had revealed to a\r\n  mutual neighbor that Armstrong was selling marijuana from his apartment.Â \r\n  Specifically, Bagwell and Spain claim the statement was admissible under Rule\r\n  608(c), SCRE, to show Armstrongâ€™s bias and motive to fabricate testimony.Â \r\n  Therefore, Bagwell and Spain contend, the trial judge abused his discretion by\r\n  excluding the evidence under Rule 613, SCRE.Â  \r\nWhether\r\n  the statement was evidence of bias and admissible under Rule 608(c), SCRE, is\r\n  an issue not raised at trial and is thus not preserved for appeal.Â  Pye v.\r\n    Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 633 S.E.2d 505 (2006).Â  See also Staubes\r\n      v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt\r\n  is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal,\r\n  but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved\r\n  for appellate review.â€); Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 103, 594\r\n  S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting it is axiomatic that an issue cannot be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal).Â  â€œImposing this preservation requirement\r\n  on the appellant is meant to enable the lower court to rule properly after it\r\n  has considered all relevant facts, law and arguments.â€Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town\r\n    of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000).\r\nThe\r\n  State objected to the testimony based on Rule 613(b), SCRE, arguing the defense\r\n  counsel failed to lay a proper foundation for the admissibility of a prior\r\n  inconsistent statement.Â  Under South Carolina law, a proper foundation must be\r\n  laid before admitting a prior inconsistent statement.Â  State v.\r\n    McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 81, 606 S.E.2d 215, 219 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Rule 613(b),\r\n  SCRE, provides:\r\n\r\n  Extrinsic\r\n    evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible\r\n    unless the witness is advised of the substance of the statement, the time and\r\n    place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom it was made, and is given\r\n    the opportunity to explain or deny the statement.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Solicitor posited, â€œ[T]he appropriate way to [use this statement] would have\r\n  been to ask my victims during cross-examination whether [sic] not they made a\r\n  statement to this man.â€ In response to the Stateâ€™s challenge to the testimony, the\r\n  defense counsel opined to the trial judge, â€œ[T]he foundation is laid.Â  He\r\n  states in court one thing that happens and then he tells my client something\r\n  different that happens.â€Â  The trial judge sustained the Stateâ€™s objection.Â  At\r\n  no time during the trial did Bagwell and Spain assert the testimony would show bias,\r\n  prejudice, or motive for Armstrong and Snoddy to testify falsely.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the trial judge was never presented with the opportunity to rule whether the evidence\r\n  was admissible under Rule 608(c).\r\nThough\r\n  we find no abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s ruling, any error arising\r\n  from the exclusion of the evidence in the present case would be harmless. \r\nError is harmless where it could not\r\n  reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  In re Harvey, 355\r\n  S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003); State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d\r\n  646 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Generally, appellate courts will not set aside\r\n  convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  State v.\r\n    Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991); State v. Adams, 354\r\n  S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, an error is harmless where\r\n  guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other\r\n  rational conclusion can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377\r\n  S.E.2d 581 (1989); Adams, 354 S.C. at 381, 580 S.E.2d at 795.Â  The\r\n  conviction should not be reversed where a review of the entire record\r\n  establishes the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  State v.\r\n    Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 466 S.E.2d 364 (1996); State v. Fletcher, 363\r\n  S.C. 221, 609 S.E.2d 572 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. King, 349 S.C. 142,\r\n  561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nIn State v. Fossick, 333 S.C. 66,\r\n  70, 508 S.E.2d 32, 33-34 (1998), and State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 513\r\n  S.E.2d 606 (1999), the supreme court applied a harmless error analysis to the\r\n  failure to allow impeaching testimony.Â Â  In both cases, the court concluded the\r\n  judgeâ€™s error in excluding impeachment evidence was harmless.Â  In Fossick,\r\n  the court explained:\r\n\r\n  In determining harmless error regarding\r\n    any issues of witness credibility, we will consider the importance of the\r\n    witnessâ€™s testimony to the prosecutionâ€™s case, whether the witnessâ€™s testimony\r\n    was cumulative, whether other evidence corroborates or contradicts the\r\n    witnessâ€™s testimony, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and\r\n    the overall strength of the Stateâ€™s case.Â  State v. Holmes, 320 S.C.\r\n    259, 464 S.E.2d 334 (1995) (citing Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed2d 674 (1986)).\r\n\r\nId. at 70, 508\r\n  S.E.2d at 34.\r\nHere,\r\n  physical evidence corroborated the testimony of Armstrong and Snoddy and\r\n  provided the State with a strong case.Â  The back glass door of the victimsâ€™\r\n  apartment had been shattered.Â  Armstrong saw Bagwell, whom he had known for\r\n  years, leaving the apartment.Â  Snoddy testified he saw Spain exit the apartment through the broken door, and the two had a physical altercation at\r\n  the scene.Â  Additionally, Armstrong averred the shoe left in his apartment was\r\n  one he remembered Spain wearing.Â  Importantly, both of these statements indicate\r\n  the lacerations to Spainâ€™s feet were caused by the doorâ€™s broken glass. Finally,\r\n  counsel for Bagwell and Spain were permitted to cross-examine Armstrong and\r\n  Snoddy.Â  Accordingly, even if the trial judge had erred in excluding the testimony\r\n  of Spainâ€™s brother, such error was harmless as it could not reasonably have\r\n  affected the outcome of the trial.Â  Â Â Â \r\nConclusion\r\nThe\r\n  trial judge did not err in ruling inadmissible the defense witnessâ€™s testimony.Â \r\n  At trial, Bagwell and Spain never argued the evidence was admissible under Rule\r\n  608(c), SCRE.Â  Therefore, the issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â \r\n  Further, the trial judge properly found no foundation had been laid to admit\r\n  under Rule 613(b), SCRE.Â  Finally, any possible error in its exclusion was\r\n  harmless given the physical evidence and the opportunity for cross-examination\r\n  of Armstrong and Snoddy.Â  Accordingly, Bagwell and Spainâ€™s convictions and\r\n  sentences are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and THOMAS, JJ., and CURETON,\r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument\r\npursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-378","title":"State v.

Fuge, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  This is an appeal of certain provisions in a divorce decree.Â  Randy Findley\r\n  (Husband) alleges error in the family courtâ€™s decisions on child support,\r\n  equitable distribution, alimony, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe\r\n  parties married on May 5, 1995.Â  They have a daughter, who was born\r\n  December 26, 1995.Â  Debora Findley (Wife) has full custody of another daughter\r\n  from a previous marriage.  \r\nThe\r\n  parties initially lived in Wifeâ€™s house in Alabama.Â  They later purchased\r\n  property on which they built a home and rented Wifeâ€™s house to Wifeâ€™s brother.Â \r\n  While they were still in Alabama, Husband filed for divorce; however, the\r\n  parties later reconciled and moved to South Carolina.  \r\nHusband\r\n  and Wife began living separate and apart on or about February 2, 2003.Â  On May\r\n  16, 2003, Wife commenced this action by filing a summons and complaint for\r\n  separate maintenance and support, custody of the partiesâ€™ child, child support,\r\n  alimony, equitable distribution, attorneyâ€™s fees, and other relief.Â  On June\r\n  12, 2003, Husband filed an answer and counterclaim in which he requested, among\r\n  other relief, a divorce on the ground of habitual drunkenness, custody and\r\n  child support, equitable distribution, and attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nPursuant\r\n  to motions for temporary relief filed by both parties, the family court held a\r\n  hearing on July 21, 2003, and issued a temporary order on August 10, 2003,\r\n  granting Wife custody of the partiesâ€™ child with visitation to Husband and\r\n  directing Husband to pay alimony of $750.00 per month, child support of $830.00\r\n  per month, and $1,500.00 toward Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees. Â Husband\r\n  unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration of the temporary order. Â Following the\r\n  denial of his motion for reconsideration of the temporary order, Husband\r\n  retained his present counsel and unsuccessfully moved to reduce child support\r\n  and eliminate his alimony obligation.[2] \r\n \r\nThe final hearing took place on August 4,\r\n  2004.Â  On November 16, 2004, the family court filed a final order in the matter\r\n  (1) granting both parties a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous\r\n  separation, (2) granting Wife custody of the partiesâ€™ child with visitation to\r\n  Husband, (3) continuing the terms of the temporary order in full force and\r\n  effect until the sale of the former marital home, (4) directing Husband to pay\r\n  child support of $788.00 per month and alimony of $300.00 per month beginning\r\n  the first day of the month after the sale of the marital residence and\r\n  continuing on a monthly basis thereafter, (5) directing Wife and provide health\r\n  insurance on the partiesâ€™ child and instructing the parties as to how to divide\r\n  the childâ€™s uncovered medical expenses, (6) dividing the marital assets and\r\n  providing certain instructions as to how a division was to be effected, and (7)\r\n  directing Husband to pay $5,000.00 to Wifeâ€™s attorney.[3]\r\nOn or\r\n  about November 17, 2004, Husband moved for reconsideration.Â  On December 1,\r\n  2004, Husband filed an amended motion for reconsideration in which he\r\n  challenged (1) the grant of certain real property to Wife, (2) the inclusion of\r\n  certain allegedly non-marital items in his share of the marital property, (3)\r\n  the valuation of certain items awarded to Wife in the equitable distribution,\r\n  (4) the award of certain items to him for which he had no use and the valuation\r\n  of these items as determined by the family court, (5) certain provisions\r\n  concerning custody, visitation, and child support, (6) the attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  award, and (7) the alimony award.Â  On December 8, 2004, the family court held a\r\n  hearing on the motions.Â  On January 28, 2005, the family court signed an order\r\n  amending the divorce decree with regard to certain portions of the equitable\r\n  division, visitation, and child support and denying the remaining issues that\r\n  Husband raised in his motions.Â  The order was filed on February 10, 2005, and\r\n  Husband filed his notice of appeal on March 2, 2005.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from the family court, an\r\n  appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C.\r\n  532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005) (citing Rutherford v. Rutherford,\r\n  307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992) and Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543,\r\n  466 S.E.2d 373 (Ct. App. 1996)).Â  â€œThis broad scope of review does not,\r\n  however, require the appellate court to disregard the findings of the family\r\n  court.â€Â  Id. (citing Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 279\r\n  S.E.2d 616 (1981)).Â  â€œNeither is the appellate court required to ignore the\r\n  fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.â€Â  Id. (citing Cherry Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280\r\n  S.E.2d 541 (1981)).Â  Moreover, â€œwhen an\r\n  appellate court chooses to find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  evidence, the court must state distinctly its findings of fact and the reason\r\n  for its decision.â€Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278,\r\n  283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002) (citing Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp; Husband first\r\n  argues the family court, when computing child support, erred in finding medical\r\n  and dental insurance premiums paid by Wife that were attributable to coverage\r\n  of their child totaled $120.00.Â  We agree the family courtâ€™s initial\r\n  calculations were in error for this reason; however, it appears from the order\r\n  amending the decree the court made the appropriate adjustment.\r\nOn her\r\n  child support worksheet, Wife indicated the portion of her monthly health\r\n  insurance premium â€œcovering children onlyâ€ was $120.00.Â  At trial, however,\r\n  Wife admitted on cross examination this amount covered not only the partiesâ€™\r\n  minor child, but also Wifeâ€™s daughter from her prior marriage as well as Wife\r\n  herself.Â  Wife attempted to justify her right to claim the entire amount for\r\n  the partiesâ€™ child by stating (1) although her older child was on her medical\r\n  policy, that child had health insurance provided by her father; and (2)\r\n  â€œdifferent premiumsâ€ would be assessed depending on whether the insured was a\r\n  single person, a person with a spouse, or a person with a family.  \r\nUnder\r\n  the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines, the family court â€œshould consider\r\n  provisions for adequate health insurance coverage for children in every child\r\n  support order.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs.114-4720(E) (1992).Â  The guidelines\r\n  further provide â€œthe portion of the health insurance which covers the children\r\n  is the only expense that should be added.â€Â  Id.  \r\nAs\r\n  Husband noted in his brief, the family court appeared to dismiss his argument\r\n  that the amount Wife maintained she was paying actually covered, in addition to\r\n  the partiesâ€™ child, Wifeâ€™s older daughter and Wife herself.Â  Nevertheless, in\r\n  the order issued pursuant to his motion, the family court, after referencing\r\n  the previous final child support award of $788.00 per month, ruled that\r\n  â€œ[u]sing revised child support calculations, . . . [Husband] shall commence\r\n  child support payments in the amount of $733.00 per monthâ€ and further noted\r\n  that, regarding child support, the divorce decree was â€œamended to conform with\r\n  my findings of fact set forth hereinabove and [Husband] shall pay child support\r\n  on a monthly basis . . . of $733.00 per month.â€Â  This revised award reflects\r\n  the amount Husband claims should be allotted to insurance coverage for the\r\n  partiesâ€™ child.[4]Â \r\n  Although the family court appeared to reject Husbandâ€™s position during the\r\n  hearing on his post-trial motion, it is evident from the written order that the\r\n  court ultimately accepted his argument and was within its right to do so.Â  See Christy v. Christy, 354 S.C. 203, 206, 580 S.E.2d 44, 446 (2003) (â€œ â€˜Until the paper has been\r\n  delivered by the judge to the clerk of court, to be filed by him as an order in\r\n  the case, it is subject to the control of the judge, and may be withdrawn at\r\n  any time before such delivery.â€™ â€) (quoting Archer v. Long, 46 S.C. 292,\r\n  295, 24 S.E. 83, 84 (1896)).\r\n2.Â  Husband next\r\n  argues the family court abused its discretion in basing child support on Wifeâ€™s\r\n  claim that childcare costs for the partiesâ€™ child came to $370.00 per month.Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nWife noted\r\n  on her financial declaration that her gross monthly childcare costs were\r\n  $370.00 and used the same figure on her child support worksheet.Â  She\r\n  gave consistent testimony on direct examination about this matter.Â  On cross\r\n  examination, however, she acknowledged her childcare costs for the prior year,\r\n  as reflected on her most recent federal income tax return, averaged to only\r\n  $177.50 per month, suggesting a difference in excess of $1,500.00 per year\r\n  between her childcare costs for the year during which the divorce hearing took\r\n  place and those for the prior year.  \r\nIn his\r\n  brief, Husbandâ€™s sole argument is that â€œit defies common sense to believe the\r\n  childcare net of tax credit had increased $1,500 only one year for after school\r\n  and summer childcare.â€Â  In our view, however, the alleged discrepancy only goes\r\n  to the weight of the evidence and is insufficient reason for this Court to hold\r\n  the family court made an incorrect finding regarding work-related childcare\r\n  costs.Â  As Wife notes in her brief, the sole challenge at trial to her evidence\r\n  regarding childcare costs was a brief question from Husbandâ€™s attorney\r\n  regarding her 2003 tax return.Â  Neither party proffered any further testimony or\r\n  evidence concerning work-related childcare costs. Â We therefore hold the family\r\n  court based its decision on the evidence presented and acted within its\r\n  discretion in doing so.[5]Â \r\n  In so holding, we note Husband should have been able to procure pertinent evidence\r\n  from the childâ€™s caregivers if he considered Wifeâ€™s figures suspect and the\r\n  record does not suggest that he even attempted to do this.\r\n3.Â  Husband next\r\n  argues the family court â€œabused its discretion in adopting the lowest suggested\r\n  sales price in the comparative market analysis of the marital homeâ€ rather than\r\n  the median value suggested by the analysis.Â  In support of this argument,\r\n  Husband further notes the analysis was eight months old at the time of trial\r\n  and therefore artificially low in a rising real estate market.Â  We reject these\r\n  contentions.\r\nWife testified the\r\n  market analysis she submitted into evidence was the highest of three market\r\n  analyses conducted on the house.Â  Moreover, Husband had ample opportunity to\r\n  seek his own appraisal and, although he filed a motion to have another\r\n  appraisal, he never followed through with it.Â  Based on the evidence before us,\r\n  we find the family courtâ€™s determination of the value of the marital residence\r\n  was within its discretion.Â  See Noll v. Noll, 297 S.C. 190, 194,\r\n  375 S.E.2d 338, 340-41 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œIn the absence\r\n  of contrary evidence, the court should accept the value the\r\n  parties assign to a marital asset.â€).\r\n4.Â  Husband next\r\n  complains the family court should not have required him to continue paying\r\n  child support and alimony at the levels set by the temporary order for an\r\n  additional thirty days given to Wife to refinance the marital home and buy out\r\n  Husbandâ€™s equity.Â  In support of this argument, Husband argues Wife had ample\r\n  time before the hearing to arrange refinancing and admitted she had initially\r\n  received approval without relying on spousal support. Â In his reply brief,\r\n  Husband further argues the alleged error was compounded by the fact that Wifeâ€™s\r\n  attorney delayed submission of the final order for three months, thus enabling\r\n  her to receive four months of child and spousal support at the higher levels.[6]Â  We find no reversible error.Â  Husband\r\n  should have raised these concerns in his post-trial motion to enable the family\r\n  court to address them; however, this he failed to do.Â  Because, therefore, the\r\n  family court did not have the opportunity to rule on this issue, we hold it was\r\n  not preserved for our review.Â  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding the court of appeals improperly addressed an issue that the\r\n  â€œcircuit court did not explicitly rule onâ€ when the appellant did not raise the\r\n  issue in a motion to alter or amend).\r\n5.Â  Husband next\r\n  submits the alimony awarded to Wife should be reversed in view of (1) Wifeâ€™s\r\n  misconduct during the marriage, (2) Wifeâ€™s level of education, (3) the\r\n  equitable distribution Wife received in the divorce, (4) Wifeâ€™s contributions\r\n  to the marriage, (5) the length of the marriage, and (6) the allegation that,\r\n  when Wifeâ€™s child support was considered, Wifehad more income than did Husband.[7]Â  We find no abuse of discretion.Â  See Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 292, 617 S.E.2d 359, 362 (2005) (â€œAn award\r\n  of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the family court and will not\r\n  be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€).\r\nAlthough\r\n  Wife had completed more schooling than did Husband and was working as an\r\n  insurance agent at the time of the divorce hearing, it was undisputed that she\r\n  consistently earned less than he did throughout the marriage.Â  Moreover, we\r\n  agree with the family court that any support Wife was receiving for her older\r\n  child should not be considered as income belonging to her for purposes of\r\n  determining her eligibility for alimony because, as the family court noted,\r\n  â€œ[s]he has the obligation to contribute, as well as the father.â€Â  Similar logic\r\n  can be applied to the child support awarded for the child of the marriage. Â As\r\n  to Wifeâ€™s alleged misconduct, we find it significant that the family court\r\n  expressly found â€œthe fault allegations set forth in the partiesâ€™ pleadings was\r\n  not supported by sufficient evidenceâ€ and chose instead to grant the divorce to\r\n  both parties on the ground of a one-year separation.Â  Although there may reason\r\n  to differ with the weight the family court gave to each of the statutory\r\n  factors for alimony, the concerns Husband has raised in this appeal do not\r\n  warrant the reduction or setting aside of the alimony award.Â  See Doe\r\n    v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 504-05, 478 S.E.2d 854, 860 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting\r\n  â€œ[n]o one factor is considered dispositiveâ€ in determining an award of spousal\r\n  support).\r\n6.Â  Husband next argues the\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees award to Wife should be reduced or eliminated altogether,\r\n  citing among other reasons (1) fees assessed him after the temporary hearing, (2)\r\n  Wifeâ€™s ability to pay her own attorney as compared with his own financial\r\n  circumstances, (3) the fact that Husband did not pursue his counterclaim for\r\n  custody, (4) deficiencies in the representation provided by Wifeâ€™s attorney,\r\n  and (5) dilatory tactics allegedly used by Wifeâ€™s attorney to prolong the\r\n  period that Husband had to pay higher levels of child and spousal support.Â  We\r\n  find no abuse of discretion based on any of these grounds to justify reversing\r\n  or modifying the attorneyâ€™s fees awarded to Wife.Â  In our view, the family\r\n  court adequately considered the requisite factors under Glasscock v.\r\n    Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991), in determining\r\n  the amount to award Wife as attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In particular, we note the\r\n  difficulty of the case was exacerbated by numerous motions filed by Husband\r\n  while the lawsuit was pending, thus increasing the time Wifeâ€™s attorney had to\r\n  devote to the matter.Â  Moreover, Wife was the prevailing party on most, if not\r\n  all, matters at trial.Â Â   \r\n7.Â  We reject Husbandâ€™s\r\n  contention that the family court should have awarded him a special equity in\r\n  Wifeâ€™s pre-marital home.Â  Contrary to Husbandâ€™s argument that he presented\r\n  â€œuncontroverted testimonyâ€ that marital funds were used to pay the mortgage on\r\n  the home as well as for a new roof, a front porch, a carport, new carpeting,\r\n  and a heating system, Wife testified that she made the mortgage payments, no\r\n  new carpet was installed, no new porch was built, and the new heating was not a\r\n  â€œheating systemâ€ but simply propane models that hung on the wall.Â  As to the\r\n  roof, Wife testified her brother, who worked as a roofer, installed a partial\r\n  new roof after a hail storm.Â  Because there was conflicting testimony regarding\r\n  Husbandâ€™s entitlement to a special equity in Wifeâ€™s pre-marital residence, we\r\n  defer to the family courtâ€™s decision on this matter.Â  See Murdock v.\r\n    Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 245 (Ct. App. 1999) (noting\r\n  that, although the court of appeals has jurisdiction in family law cases to\r\n  find facts according to its own view of the evidence, it is not required to\r\n  disregard the family courtâ€™s findings or â€œto ignore the fact that the family\r\n  court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to\r\n  evaluate their testimonyâ€).\r\n8.Â  We reject Husbandâ€™s\r\n  argument that the family court abused its discretion in allegedly â€œadopting\r\n  wholesaleâ€ personal property valuations that Wife or her attorney allegedly â€œhurriedly\r\n  jotted on [Husbandâ€™s] marital assets addendum during a break at trial.â€ No\r\n  proof of value was offered by either party other than their opinions regarding\r\n  the worth of the various items.Â  Moreover, in support of his position, Husband\r\n  alleges on appeal that Wifeâ€™s valuations were â€œlow-balledâ€ without directing\r\n  our attention to any evidence showing how they were incorrect.Â  Without any\r\n  specific assignments of error, we see no reason to disturb the family courtâ€™s\r\n  assessments of worth for the various items at issue.Â   \r\n9.Â  Finally,\r\n  Husband alleges the family court erred in awarding him various personal effects\r\n  for which he allegedly had no use.Â  He further maintains the error is\r\n  compounded by Wifeâ€™s claim that she did not to know where the items were\r\n  located, the fact that he was presently living out-of-state in a rented room,\r\n  and his allegation that the family court gave the items artificially high\r\n  values.Â  We find no merit to these assertions.\r\nAccording\r\n  to Husbandâ€™s brief, the items at issue consisted of a rug, a plant, a\r\n  non-working computer, discs, a VHS player, an antique curio cabinet, a floral\r\n  picture, a telephone, carving knives, pots, pans, and corning ware.Â  The only\r\n  item of any significant worth or bulk was the curio cabinet, which the family\r\n  court assessed at $500.00.Â  The family court specifically found this item was a\r\n  non-marital asset and Husband does not appeal this finding; therefore, we\r\n  affirm the decision to award it in-kind to Husband.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2006) (â€œThe [family] court does not have jurisdiction or\r\n  authority to apportion nonmarital property.â€).\r\nSeveral of the items that Husband claims he received in the\r\n  equitable division but did not want were assigned no value at all; these\r\n  consisted of the rug, the computer and disks, the telephone and the pots and\r\n  pans. Â Because these items were assessed a zero value, Husbandâ€™s claim\r\n  that they resulted in Wifeâ€™s receiving a â€œmonetary offsetâ€ for them lacks merit.\r\n  Â \r\nThe total value assigned by the family court to the remaining\r\n  items in question was $87.50.Â  Ironically, however, in his post-trial motion,\r\n  Husband requested not only that these items be awarded in-kind to Wife, he\r\n  alleged they had been â€œgrossly undervaluedâ€ when they were included in the inventory\r\n  of property that the family court awarded to him.Â  Under these circumstances,\r\n  we are at a loss to see how Husband can now complain the family court assigned\r\n  inflated values to these items.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  ANDERSON and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The record contains a rule to show cause against\r\n  Husband issued April 19, 2004, after the denial of Husbandâ€™s motion to reduce\r\n  child support and eliminate alimony.Â  In Wifeâ€™s verified petition, she alleges\r\n  Husband had failed to pay these obligations in a timely manner and was in arrears.Â \r\n  Although the rule to show cause noted a hearing was scheduled for June 15,\r\n  2004, the record does not indicate the outcome of the hearing.\r\n[3]Â  The final order reproduced in the record appears to\r\n  stop in mid-sentence and the summary given above is based on the portion that\r\n  was made available.Â  The clerkâ€™s file has a complete copy of the order; all\r\n  that is missing is the final page, which has only about one-half page of text\r\n  and information that does not affect this appeal.\r\n[4]Â  In addition to the dispute regarding the cost of\r\n  medical insurance on the partiesâ€™ child, Husband alleged in his post-trial\r\n  motion that Wife underreported her income and presented a grossly inflated\r\n  figure for the cost of her work-related childcare.Â  From our reading of the\r\n  written order issued by the family court after it heard the motion, it appears\r\n  the family court accepted the figures that Husband suggested correctly\r\n  reflected Wifeâ€™s monthly gross income and health insurance premiums for the\r\n  partiesâ€™ child and rejected the figure he proposed for work-related childcare.Â \r\n  We calculated child support using the worksheet that Husband included as an\r\n  exhibit with his motion, which appears on page 93 of the record on appeal.Â  In\r\n  our calculations, we used the revised figure for Wifeâ€™s gross monthly income\r\n  and the figure Husband claimed reflected the correct cost of health insurance\r\n  premiums for the partiesâ€™ child; however, we used the figure for work-related\r\n  childcare that the family court had applied when initially setting child\r\n  support instead of the figure Husband suggested on the worksheet.Â  Using\r\n  the revised figures suggested by Husband for both Wifeâ€™s income and health\r\n  insurance premiums for the child, we computed child support under the\r\n  guidelines to be $732.09 per month, which deviates from the family courtâ€™s\r\n  calculation by less than $1.00 per month.  \r\n[5]Â  On her financial declaration, Wife notes the $370.00\r\n  per month she was claiming for childcare â€œincludes dance &amp; swim lessons.â€Â \r\n  The costs of these lessons could possibly account for the large discrepancy about\r\n  which Husband was complaining; however, we have found nothing in the record\r\n  indicating either party advanced this theory at trial.\r\n[6]Â  As noted in the facts, the temporary order set\r\n  alimony and child support at $750.00 per month and $830.00 per month,\r\n  respectively.Â  In the final order, the family court set alimony at $300.00 per\r\n  month and child support at $788.00 per month, but later reduced child support\r\n  to $733.00 per month.\r\n[7]Â  During trial, Husband alleged that Wife was unfaithful and extravagant.Â  He further maintained she abused alcohol and did not contribute financially\r\n  to the marriage in a level befitting her education and other circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-383","title":"Payne v.

Â In May 2000, the parties separated and reached a\r\n  comprehensive support and property settlement agreement.Â  That agreement was\r\n  incorporated into the family courtâ€™s order, issued in December 2000, regarding\r\n  the initial action for separate support and maintenance.Â  The final order of\r\n  divorce approved the settlement agreement and incorporated it into the divorce\r\n  decree in January 2003.Â   \r\nThe present action arises from Husbandâ€™s motion to terminate or\r\n  reduce his monthly alimony obligation.Â  Wife argued the settlement agreement\r\n  was not modifiable by the family court.Â  Wife filed a motion to dismiss\r\n  Husbandâ€™s action pursuant to the modification language in the settlement\r\n  agreement.Â  Â The family court granted Wifeâ€™s motion to dismiss, finding the\r\n  language of the settlement agreement divested the court of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to modify the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â   \r\nHusband filed a motion to reconsider, which the family court\r\n  denied. Â Â This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from\r\n  the family court, this Court may\r\n  find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence. Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369\r\n  (2002).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â \r\n  Our broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of his burden to\r\n  convince this Court the family court committed error.Â  Skinner\r\n    v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in holding it lacked subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction to modify the partiesâ€™ settlement agreement.Â  Husband also asserts\r\n  the family court erred in ignoring the doctrines of merger and law of the\r\n  case.Â  We disagree.\r\nI.Â  Alimony\r\n  Modification\r\nQuestions concerning alimony rest within the sound discretion of\r\n  the family court judge, whose conclusions will not be disturbed in the absence\r\n  of an abuse of that discretion.Â  Stoddard v. Riddle, 362 S.C. 266, 268,\r\n  607 S.E.2d 97, 98 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the family\r\n  courtâ€™s decision is controlled by an error of law or is based on findings of\r\n  fact having no evidentiary support.Â  Id.Â   \r\nThe family court has the authority to modify alimony agreements\r\n  â€œunless the agreement unambiguously denies the court jurisdictionâ€ to do so.Â  Moseley\r\n    v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 353, 306 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1983).Â  â€œ[O]nce an\r\n  alimony agreement that specifically disallows modification is approved by the court\r\n  and merged into a judicial order, it is binding on the parties and the court\r\n  and is not subject to modification.â€Â  Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C.\r\n  497, 500-01, 602 S.E.2d 96, 98 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The parties may specifically â€œagree\r\n  that the amount of alimony may not ever be modified by the court.â€Â  Croom v.\r\n    Croom, 305 S.C. 158, 161, 406 S.E.2d 381, 383 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\n\r\n\tThe partiesâ€™ agreement reads, in pertinent part:\r\n\tEFFECTS OF DIVORCE\r\n\t12.Â  . . .Â  This Agreement shall be offered in evidence in such\r\n  action and if acceptable to the [c]ourt, shall be incorporated by reference\r\n  into any Decree of Divorce that may be granted therein; provided, however, that\r\n  not withstanding such incorporation, this Agreement shall not be modified,\r\n  altered or amended by the [c]ourt, but shall be binding and conclusive as to\r\n  those matters covered herein on the parties forever.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tAPPROVAL\r\n\t16.Â  This Agreement shall be submitted to the [f]amily [c]ourt for\r\n  the State of South Carolina for the purpose of having the [c]ourt review,\r\n  approve and merge the terms and conditions of this Agreement and for the\r\n  issuance of an appropriate Order approving the terms and conditions hereof and\r\n  making the same the Order of the Court, and merging this Agreement with such\r\n  Order.Â  The parties agree and acknowledge that this is a fully integrated and\r\n  complete Separation Agreement with respect to all matters raised or those which\r\n  could have been raised in the controversies between them.\r\n\r\nIn Moseley,\r\n  our Supreme Court adopted a rule allowing parties to specifically agree that\r\n  the court may never modify the terms of their agreement.Â  This decision acknowledged\r\n  that the parties could contract out of the family courtâ€™s continuing\r\n  jurisdictional supervision of their relationship.Â  Moseley, 279 S.C. at\r\n  353, 306 S.E.2d at 627.Â   \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  in Degenhart, this Court honored a settlement agreement which did not\r\n  explicitly state the family court was devoid of jurisdiction to modify the\r\n  alimony agreement, but rather it said the only way to modify the agreement was\r\n  with the written consent of the parties.Â  We specifically stated there would be\r\n  no requirement of â€œâ€˜magic wordsâ€™ for an unambiguous agreement to gain\r\n  efficacy.â€ Degenhart 360 S.C. at 501, 602 S.E.2d at 98. Â Therefore, this\r\n  Court found the partiesâ€™ agreement non-modifiable.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  family court relied on Moseley and Degenhart in arriving at its\r\n  decision that the agreement in this case denied it jurisdiction to modify\r\n  alimony.Â  The family court found the language in the agreement was clear,\r\n  unequivocal, and unambiguous in denying it the ability to modify the terms of\r\n  the agreement.Â  Our review of the record and the applicable case law leads us\r\n  to the same conclusion.Â  Therefore, we find the family court did not err in\r\n  holding it lacked jurisdiction to modify the terms of the alimony agreement.\r\nII.Â  Merger\r\nHusband argues the concept of merger gives\r\n  the family court jurisdiction to modify the terms of the agreement, which was\r\n  adopted into the courtâ€™s order.Â  We disagree.\r\nMerger is\r\n  a word of art meaning â€œ1. The act or an instance of combining or uniting. 2. [Contracts]\r\n  The substitution of a superior form of contract for an inferior form, as when a\r\n  written contract supersedes all oral agreements and prior understandings.â€ Blackâ€™s law dictionary 1002 (7th ed. 1999).Â  When an agreement\r\n  is merged into a courtâ€™s decree, that decree â€œshould be construed to effect the\r\n  intent of both the judge and the parties.â€Â  Messer v. Messer, 359 S.C.\r\n  614, 628, 598 S.E.2d 310, 318 (Ct. App. 2004).Â   \r\nTraditionally,\r\n  the family court was devoid of jurisdiction to modify agreements which were not\r\n  merged into a court order.Â  Kelly v. Edwards, 276 S.C. 368, 369, 278\r\n  S.E.2d 773, 773-74 (1981).Â  However, the decision in Moseley â€œattempt[ed] to eliminate the words of art [such as merger] from domestic\r\n  law.â€Â  Moseley 279 S.C. at 353, 306 S.E.2d at 627.Â  Thus, the current\r\n  state of the law is that words of art will not govern jurisdiction, but rather\r\n  the intent of the parties and the clear, unambiguous language of the agreement\r\n  will be honored by the court.Â  Id. at 352-53, 306 S.E.2d at 627; see Maxwell v. Maxwell, Op. No. 4290, --- S.C. ----, --- S.E.2d ----, 2007\r\n  WL 2415733 (Ct. App. 2007) (â€œWhile the family court normally has the authority\r\n  to modify alimony, once an alimony agreement that specifically disallows\r\n  modification is approved by the court and merged into a judicial order, it is\r\n  binding on the parties and the court and is not subject to\r\n  modification.â€)(internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  Therefore, we hold\r\n  the family court did not err in finding it lacked jurisdiction to modify the\r\n  alimony provisions of the partiesâ€™ agreement even though the language called\r\n  for merger of that agreement into a court order.\r\nIII. Law of\r\n  the Case\r\nHusband\r\n  argues the agreement is modifiable pursuant to the law of the case.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nLaw of the case refers to the idea that the terms of orders which\r\n  are not appealed become the law of the case regardless of whether those terms\r\n  are legally correct. Â McAleese v. McAleese, 309 S.C. 548, 551, 424\r\n  S.E.2d 558, 559-60 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Husband cites to an October 2002 order\r\n  resulting from a rule to show cause. Â The family court approved an agreement of\r\n  the parties requiring Husband to pay alimony and child support arrearages in a\r\n  lump sum and to continue his regular payments.Â  Husband relies on part of the\r\n  October order which states, â€œ[Husband] will pay [Wife] $3500 per month pursuant\r\n  to the agreement until or unless the amount is modified by a court of competent\r\n  jurisdiction.â€Â  Neither the agreement nor the order of the court, however,\r\n  altered the terms of the monthly payments or the provision that disallowed the\r\n  court to modify the alimony.Â   \r\nSubsequent to the contempt order of October 2002, the parties\r\n  divorced in January 2003 and the prior order from December 2000, which prohibited\r\n  the modification of alimony, was incorporated in the Divorce Decree. Â Â \r\nPursuant to the original order, the family court had jurisdiction\r\n  to enforce the alimony and child support payments through its contempt powers.Â \r\n  The agreement in the December 2000 order, which was subsequently incorporated\r\n  in the January 2003 Divorce Decree, is clear and specific that the alimony is\r\n  not modifiable by the court.Â  The agreement states:\r\n\r\n\t12.Â  . . .Â  This Agreement shall be offered in evidence in such\r\n  action and if acceptable to the [c]ourt, shall be incorporated by reference\r\n  into any Decree of Divorce that may be granted therein; provided, however, that\r\n  not withstanding such incorporation, this Agreement shall not be modified,\r\n  altered or amended by the [c]ourt, but shall be binding and conclusive as to\r\n  those matters covered herein on the parties forever.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the absence of this agreement the family court would\r\n  have had jurisdiction to modify the alimony payments, â€œonce an alimony\r\n  agreement that specifically disallows modification is approved by the court and\r\n  merged into a judicial order, it is binding on the parties and the court and is\r\n  not subject to modification.â€Â  Degenhart, 360 S.C. at 500-01, 602 S.E.2d\r\n  at 98.Â  Therefore, once this agreement was merged into the Divorce Decree the\r\n  family court no longer had jurisdiction to modify it. The contempt order of\r\n  October 2002 did not attempt to modify the alimony agreement, it merely recited\r\n  the total past due amount of alimony and child support.Â  The order made no\r\n  reference that the prior agreement was being changed to allow future\r\n  modification of alimony by the court.Â   \r\nThe partiesâ€™ agreement is clear and unambiguous.Â  The terms of\r\n  that agreement deny the family court jurisdiction to modify Husbandâ€™s alimony\r\n  payments.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in holding it lacked\r\n  jurisdiction to alter Husbandâ€™s alimony payments.Â   \r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  family courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT,\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-384","title":"Miller v.

Smith, Trask &amp; Howell, LLC, of Mt.

Ins. Co. v. James, 337 S.C. \r\n86, 93, 522 S.E.2d 345, 348-49 (Ct. App. 1999) (In a suit to determine coverage \r\nunder an automobile liability policy, an appellate courtâ€™s standard of review is \r\nlimited to correcting errors of law.&nbsp; Factual findings of the trial court \r\nwill not be disturbed, unless found to be without evidence which reasonably \r\nsupports the judgeâ€™s findings.).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Interlocutory appeal\r\nUnity\r\n  Group initially argues this Court lacks jurisdiction to decide this case\r\n  because this appeal constitutes an interlocutory appeal.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally,\r\n  an appeal to this Court will be allowed only if the trial court has issued a\r\n  final judgment.Â  Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 194, 607 S.E.2d\r\n  707, 708 (2005).Â  However, the following four situations permit a party to appeal\r\n  absent a final judgment:  \r\n\r\n\t(1)\r\n  intermediate judgments, orders or decrees involving the merits, (2) orders\r\n  affecting substantial rights when such orders in effect determine the action\r\n  and prevent a judgment from which an appeal may be taken or when the orders\r\n  discontinue the action, (3) a final order in special proceedings, and (4)\r\n  interlocutory orders [relating to injunctions].\r\n\r\nÂ Walker v. Springs\r\n  Indus., Inc., 298 S.C. 249, 251, 379 S.E.2d 729, 730 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nÂ â€œAn order involves the merits if it\r\n  finally determines some substantial matter forming the whole or part of some\r\n  cause of action or defense in the case.â€Â  Green v. City of Columbia, 311\r\n  S.C. 78, 80, 427 S.E.2d 685, 687 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nThe determination\r\n  of whether Unity Group is a named insured involves the merits of the case.Â  If\r\n  Unity Group is not an insured, then Continental does not owe a duty to defend\r\n  Unity Group in the underlying action.Â  Conversely, if Unity Group is deemed a\r\n  named insured under MBAâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation policy, then Continental owes a\r\n  duty to defend Unity Group.Â  Thus, the determination of Unity Groupâ€™s status\r\n  with respect to Continental is dispositive of whether Continental owes a duty\r\n  to defend Unity Group.  \r\nHaving\r\n  determined this appeal is properly before us, we now turn our attention to\r\n  whether Unity Group is a named insured.\r\nB. Unity Group is a named\r\n  insured\r\nThe\r\n  terms of an insurance policy must be construed liberally in favor of the\r\n  insured.Â  Quinn v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 238 S.C. 301, 304,\r\n  120 S.E.2d 15, 16 (1961).Â  Insurance policies are subject to the common rules\r\n  of contract construction.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, in the absence of ambiguity,\r\n  the terms of the policy will be given their plain, ordinary, and popular\r\n  meaning.Â  Id.Â  However, when the terms of the policy are capable of two\r\n  reasonable interpretations, the ambiguity will be resolved in favor of the\r\n  insured.Â  Id. Â Â \r\nThe workersâ€™\r\n  compensation policy between Continental and MBA covers the dates August 1, 2001\r\n  thru August 1, 2002.Â  This policy contains an Alternate Employer Endorsement\r\n  (the Endorsement).Â  The Endorsement states that workersâ€™ compensation insurance\r\n  will apply if an employee of MBA is injured â€œin the course of special or\r\n  temporary employment by the alternate employer . . . .â€[1]Â  Thus, the question becomes whether Unity Group can be considered\r\n  an â€œalternate employer.â€\r\nNeither\r\n  the policy nor the Endorsement defines the term â€œalternate employer.â€Â  Unity\r\n  Group may or may not be an â€œalternate employer.â€Â  We hold that the Endorsement\r\n  creates an ambiguity of whether Unity Group qualifies as an â€œalternate\r\n  employer.â€Â  Under South Carolina law, the ambiguity will be resolved in favor\r\n  of the insured.Â  Id.Â  Thus, Unity Group is an insured under the workersâ€™ compensation policy between MBA and\r\n  Continental. Â This conclusion is supported by the Certificate presented to\r\n  Unity Group by Continentalâ€™s agent.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  April 26, 2002, an authorized representative for Continental presented the\r\n  Certificate to Unity Group.Â  Although the Certificate is not part of the insurance\r\n  policy between MBA and Continental, it clarifies the ambiguity created by the\r\n  Endorsement.Â  The Certificate references the workersâ€™ compensation policy\r\n  between MBA and Continental.Â  It states, â€œCoverage is provided for only those\r\n  employees leased to but not subcontractors of: The Unity Group, Inc.â€Â  Moreover,\r\n  Unity Group is listed as the certificate holder and an additional insured.Â  The\r\n  Certificate specifically references the Endorsement.Â  Thus, the Certificate\r\n  presented by Continentalâ€™s agent and the ambiguity created by the Endorsement support\r\n  the conclusion that Unity Group is an insured.  \r\nFinally,\r\n  we note the stated issue on appeal is not the real controversy involved in this\r\n  case.Â  Miller had two accidents,\r\n  one occurring in July 2002, during the time Continentalâ€™s policy was in full\r\n  force and effect, and one occurring in March 2002.Â  The crux of the issue is\r\n  not whether Continental provides coverage for Unity Group, but whether\r\n  Continental owes a duty to Unity Group with respect to Millerâ€™s March\r\n  accident.Â  In the proceedings below, it has so far been determined that the\r\n  injuries suffered by Miller are the result of the first accident.Â \r\n  Consequently, Unity Group is aggrieved because apparently through no fault of\r\n  its own, it had no workersâ€™ compensation coverage at that time.Â   \r\nThe discreet\r\n  question we are asked is stated as follows:Â  â€œDid the Circuit Court err as a\r\n  matter of law in finding that the Unity Group is an insured under Modern\r\n  Business Associatesâ€™ policy of insurance with Continental Casualty Insurance\r\n  Company, who is entitled to defense from Continental Casualty Insurance\r\n  Company?â€Â  This opinion correctly answers that question.Â  However, we have not\r\n  been asked to determine if Unity Â Group provides coverage for the injuries\r\n  suffered by Miller as a result of the first accident, and we are therefore\r\n  precluded from addressing that issue.Â  As former Chief Judge Sanders so aptly\r\n  observed, â€œappellate courts in this state, like well-behaved children, do not\r\n  speak unless spoken to and do not answer questions they are not asked.â€Â  Langley\r\n    v. Boyter, 284 S.C. 162, 182, 325 S.E.2d 550, 561 (Ct. App. 1984), quashed\r\n      on other grounds by 286 S.C. 85, 332 S.E.2d 100 (1985); see Gold\r\n        Kist, Inc. v. Citizens &amp; S. Natâ€™l Bank of S.C., 286 S.C. 272, 276, 333\r\n  S.E.2d 67, 70 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding issues not raised in the briefs are\r\n  deemed abandoned).Â Â Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Counsel for Continental argues the Endorsement is\r\n  inapplicable because it does not cover the period of August 1, 2001 to August\r\n  1, 2002.Â  We find this argument unpersuasive.Â  The policy between MBA and\r\n  Continental covers the period August 1, 2001 to August 1, 2002.Â  The\r\n  Endorsement lists the policy period as â€œ08/01/01 [to] 08/01/02.â€Â  Thus, the\r\n  Endorsement is part of the insurance policy.Â Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-385","title":"Crocker v.

Crum, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Petitioner seeks a writ of\r\n  certiorari from the partial grant and partial denial of his application for\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR).[1]\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nBecause there is\r\n  sufficient evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that petitioner did not\r\n  knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a direct appeal, we grant\r\n  certiorari on petitionerâ€™s request for belated review of the direct appeal and\r\n  proceed with a review of the direct appeal issue pursuant to Davis v. State,\r\n  288 S.C. 290, 342 S.E.2d 60 (1986).Â   \r\nOn appeal,\r\n  Crockerâ€™s counsel argues Crockerâ€™s guilty plea was not entered knowingly and\r\n  voluntarily when he did not demonstrate a knowledge of the law in relation to\r\n  the facts.Â  Crockerâ€™s counsel attached a petition to\r\n  be relieved, stating he reviewed the record and concluded this appeal lacks\r\n  merit.Â  Crocker also submitted a pro se response brief\r\n  reiterating counselâ€™s argument and making additional argumentsÂ  Pursuant to Anders\r\n    v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967) and State v. Williams, 305 S.C.\r\n  116, 406 S.E.2d 357 (1991), after a thorough review of the record, counselâ€™s\r\n  brief, and Crockerâ€™s pro se brief, we dismiss the appeal and\r\n  grant counselâ€™s motion to be relieved.[2]\r\nDISMISSED.  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Crocker argues his plea was not voluntarily made.Â \r\n  The PCR judge rejected this argument finding Crockerâ€™s testimony was not\r\n  credible.Â  Furthermore, the record from the guilty plea establishes that\r\n  Crocker entered a free, voluntary, and knowing plea.Â  Because there is evidence\r\n  in the record to support the PCR judgeâ€™s decision, we deny certiorari on Crockerâ€™s\r\n  allegation his plea was involuntarily made.Â  See Caprood v. State,\r\n  338 S.C. 103, 109-10, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000) (explaining that the existence\r\n  of any evidence is sufficient to uphold the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling).\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-386","title":"State v.

Snook, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this workersâ€™ compensation action, Dodson Brothers Exterminating Company and Birmingham Fire\r\n  Insurance Company (collectively Dodson) appeal the finding of the Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Commissionâ€™s Appellate Panel that Michael Collins was permanently\r\n  and totally disabled.Â  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nCollins worked at Dodson as a manager.Â  On October 16, 1996, Collinsâ€™s supervisor, Jim Vaughn, told Collins to\r\n  dispose of a pest control product called Phostoxin by dissolving it in a\r\n  bucket of water.Â  When Collins did this, a chemical reaction occurred,\r\n  converting the Phostoxin into a gas, which Collins accidentally inhaled.Â  Shortly\r\n  thereafter, Collins began to experience health problems.Â  Ultimately, following\r\n  a MRI, Dr. Jerry Schexnayder diagnosed Collins with avascular necrosis, a\r\n  disease where the bone experiences a loss of blood supply resulting in bone\r\n  tissue dying and eventually collapsing.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nIn 1998, Collins had his left hip replaced.Â  In a report dated\r\n  February 7, 2001, Dr. Schexnayder found Collins achieved maximum medical\r\n  improvement for his left hip and gave him a seventy-five percent impairment\r\n  rating for the lower left extremity.Â  On December 4, 2001, Dr. Schexnayder also\r\n  replaced Collinsâ€™s right hip.Â  In a report dated April 15, 2002, Dr. Schexnayer\r\n  determined Collins was at maximum medical improvement for his right hip and\r\n  gave him a seventy-five percent impairment rating for his lower right\r\n  extremity.Â   \r\nOn\r\n  August 24, 2000, Collins initially filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim alleging\r\n  he was totally and permanently disabled as a result of inhaling the Phostoxin\r\n  gas.Â  On December 9, 2003, the single commissioner held a hearing on the matter\r\n  and determined Collins was permanently and totally disabled.Â  Dodson appealed,\r\n  and the Appellate Panel affirmed the single commissioner and adopted the single\r\n  commissionerâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  Dodson appealed, and\r\n  the circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe South\r\n  Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for\r\n  judicial review of decisions by the Appellate Panel.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc.,\r\n  276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this court may not\r\n  substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the\r\n  evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected\r\n  by an error of law.Â  Stone v. Traylor Bros., Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 274,\r\n  600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule governs the standard of review in a workersâ€™\r\n  compensation decision.Â  Frame v.\r\n    Resort Servs. Inc.,357 S.C.\r\n  520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 494 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The Appellate Panelâ€™s decision must be affirmed if supported by\r\n  substantial evidence in the record.Â  Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C. 435, 440, 622 S.E.2d 569, 571 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005). Â An appellate court can reverse or modify the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s decision only if the appellantâ€™s substantial rights have been\r\n  prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is â€œclearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the\r\n  whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006); Bursey v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).  \r\n\r\n\tâ€œSubstantial evidenceâ€ is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the\r\n  evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which,\r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order\r\n  to justify its action.\r\n\r\n\r\nLark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306.\r\n\r\nâ€œ[T]he\r\n  possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\r\n  prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.â€Â  Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C.\r\n  430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984). Â In workersâ€™ compensation cases, the\r\n  Appellate Panel is the ultimate finder of fact.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  Where the evidence is conflicting over a factual issue, the\r\n  findings of the Appellate Panel are conclusive.Â  Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co.,360 S.C. 276, 290, 599 S.E.2d 604, 611 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nDodson argues\r\n  Collins failed to show by substantial evidence he is permanently and totally disabled\r\n  under section 42-9-10 of the South Carolina Code Â (Supp. 2006).[1]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nUnder section 42-9-10, a claimant has three ways to obtain\r\n  total disability.Â  First, a claimant can be presumptively disabled.Â Â   \r\n\r\n\tThe list of injuries included in the presumptive total\r\n  disability category include: â€œ[t]he loss of both hands, arms, feet, legs, or\r\n  vision in both eyes, or any two thereof, constitutes total and permanent\r\n  disability to be compensated according to the provisions of this sectionâ€ or\r\n  that claimant â€œis a paraplegic, a quadriplegic, or who has suffered physical\r\n  brain damage. . . .â€\r\n\r\nWigfall\r\n  v. Tideland Utils., Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 105 n.4, 580 S.E.2d 100, 102 n.4 (2003)\r\n  (quoting Â§ 42-9-10) (alteration and omission by court).Â  For these\r\n  injuries, a claimant need not show a loss of earning capacity because the loss\r\n  is conclusively presumed.Â  Id. at 105, 580 S.E.2d at 102. Â Second, a\r\n  claimant can show an injury that is not a scheduled injury under section\r\n  42-9-30 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) â€œcaused sufficient loss of\r\n  earning capacity to render him totally disabled.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThird, a\r\n  claimant may establish total disability through multiple physical injuries.â€ Â Id.\r\nFirst, although Collinsâ€™s doctor gave a seventy-five\r\n  percent impairment rating on each of his legs, Dodson contends Collins does not\r\n  qualify for permanent and total disability without demonstrating a loss of\r\n  earning capacity because Collinsâ€™s injuries were to his hips.[2]Â \r\n  Further, Dodson contends Collins did not demonstrate a loss of earning capacity.Â \r\n  We find the record contains substantial evidence Collins sustained a loss of\r\n  earning capacity. Â Accordingly, we need not address whether he was\r\n  presumptively disabled.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an\r\n  appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nThe hips are not a\r\n  part of the leg; they are part of the pelvis.Â  Gilliam v. Woodside Mills,\r\n  319 S.C. 385, 387, 461 S.E.2d 818, 819 (1996).Â  Thus, Collinsâ€™s injuries are\r\n  unscheduled under section 42-9-30.Â  South Carolina jurisprudence provides a\r\n  claimantâ€™s â€œbare statement that he is unable to work\r\n  is insufficient, in our opinion, to afford reasonable basis for the conclusion\r\n  that he is totally disabled,â€ where doctors testify to the contrary. Â Wynn v. Peoples Natural\r\n    Gas Co. of S.C., 238 S.C. 1, 13, 118\r\n  S.E.2d 812, 818 (1961). Â However, in deciding\r\n  whether substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s findings, we\r\n  consider both the lay and expert evidence. Â Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health\r\n    Care of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 341, 513 S.E.2d 843, 847 (1999).Â  Â While this court has\r\n  previously found reasonable efforts to obtain employment and the testimony of a\r\n  vocational expert are methods of demonstrating a loss of earning capacity, they\r\n  are not the exclusive ways to prove the loss.Â  See Nettles v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. # 7, 341 S.C. 580, 588, 535 S.E.2d 146, 150 (Ct. App. 2000); McCollum\r\n    v. Singer Co.,300 S.C. 103, 107,\r\n  386 S.E.2d 471, 474 (Ct. App. 1989), Floyd v. City of Charleston, 287 S.C. 474, 480, 339 S.E.2d 166, 169 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  In Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 S.C. 378, 384, 335 S.E.2d 91, 95 (Ct. App. 1985), although a doctor testified the claimant could perform jobs\r\n  requiring minimum physical activity such as bricklaying, the doctorâ€™s medical\r\n  report following examination of the claimant stated the claimant became out of\r\n  breath carrying out the garbage or taking a bath.Â  Further, the claimant\r\n  himself testified to continual shortness of breath and tightness in his chest.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, another doctor testified that in his opinion, Hanks\r\n  was permanently and totally disabled. Â Id.Â  This court found substantial evidence supported the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s determination that the claimant was totally disabled based on\r\n  the second doctorâ€™s testimony and the testimony of the claimant. Â Id.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Collins stopped working at Dodson in 1998 when he first had\r\n  hip replacement surgery, and according to him, he continues to be unable to\r\n  work.Â  He testified he could not get up after squatting and has difficulty\r\n  walking.Â  He testified the pain in his knees and legs prevented him from working.Â \r\n  Further, Collinsâ€™s doctor, Dr. Schexnayder, twice provided his opinion that\r\n  Collins could not work.Â  In 1999, Dr. Schexnayder stated â€œthis patient is\r\n  totally disabled from performing any occupation at this point.â€Â  In 2001, Dr. Schexnayder\r\n  again stated, â€œ[Collins] currently is unable to perform any gainful employment\r\n  and I am not optimistic that this will change in the future.â€Â  Dodson presented\r\n  no evidence Collins was able to work.Â   \r\nCollins\r\n  had a general equivalency degree and was fifty years old when he testified\r\n  before the single commissioner in 2003.Â  He received no special training after\r\n  school, and he had previously worked as a mechanic for thirteen years and prior\r\n  to that, as a manual laborer.Â  Even though Collinsâ€™s job titles at Dodson were\r\n  sales and then management, those jobs still entailed crawling under houses.Â \r\n  Collins also testified he was not a great reader and had difficulty balancing\r\n  his checkbook.Â  Given Collinsâ€™s background, the fact he had both hips replaced,\r\n  and his impairment of seventy-five percent to each leg, he does not seem a\r\n  likely candidate for anything that does not involve some physical activity, and\r\n  the record supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding of total and permanent\r\n  disability.Â  We note â€œthe final determination of\r\n  witness credibility and the weight to\r\n  be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.â€Â  Bass v. Kenco Group,366 S.C. 450, 458, 622 S.E.2d 577, 581 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  Therefore, we find the evidence sufficient to uphold the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s finding Collins permanently and totally disabled.\r\n\r\nFurther, Collins has\r\n  been found eligible for social security disability and Dodsonâ€™s disability\r\n  insurance program. Â While we are cognizant of the fact â€œawards and records of the Social Security Administration ordinarily cannot be relied upon to support or deny a workersâ€™ compensation claim,â€ in\r\n  conjunction with the other evidence Collins presented, we believe it can be\r\n  considered as further evidence supporting the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision.Â  Solomon v. W.B. Easton, Inc., 307 S.C. 518, 521, 415 S.E.2d 841, 843 (Ct. App. 1992)\r\n  (emphasis added). Â \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe record\r\n  contains substantial evidence Collins sustained a loss of earning capacity.Â  Accordingly, the Appellate Panel did not err in finding\r\n  Collins permanently and totally disabled.Â  Therefore, the circuit courtâ€™s order\r\n  is  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The South Carolina General Assembly recently\r\n  overhauled South Carolinaâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation laws.Â  These statutory changes\r\n  affect claims for injuries occurring on or after July 1, 2007.Â  See 2007\r\n  S.C. Acts 111, Part IV, Section 2 (â€œExcept as otherwise\r\n  provided for in this act, this act takes effect July 1, 2007, or, if ratified\r\n  after July 1, 2007, and except otherwise stated, upon approval by the Governor\r\n  and applies to injuries that occur on or after this date.â€)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The injury in this case occurred on October\r\n  16, 1996.Â  Of note, however, is that injuries to the hips have now been\r\n  scheduled.Â  \r\n[2] This case is best resolved under the loss of earning\r\n  capacity provision rather than the presumptively disabled provision due to a\r\n  recent South Carolina Supreme Court case.Â  In Therrell v. Jerryâ€™s Inc.,\r\n  370 S.C. 22, 24-25, 633 S.E.2d 893, 894 (2006), the claimant injured her\r\n  rotator cuff, which is defined as part of the shoulder, but the Appellate Panel\r\n  awarded her compensation under the scheduled injury of an arm.Â  The circuit\r\n  court and this court affirmed focusing on the claimantâ€™s description of her\r\n  injury as affecting her arm and on the fact that the medical evidence rated her\r\n  injury as an impairment of the upper right extremity.Â  Id. at 25, 633\r\n  S.E.2d at 894.Â  The Supreme Court found two general theories of recovery for\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation exist: (1) the â€œfunctional impairmentâ€ approach, where\r\n  the functional impairment that results from an injury is dispositive for\r\n  determining under what schedule an injury is paid; and (2) the â€œsitus of the\r\n  injuryâ€ approach, where the focus is on the actual injured body part to determine\r\n  how to compensate an injury.Â  Id. at 26-28, 633 S.E.2d at 895-96.Â  In\r\n  affirming this court as modified, the Supreme Court found South Carolina\r\n  follows the situs of the injury approach.Â  Id. at 28, 633 S.E.2d at\r\n  896.Â  The court cited Gilliam v. Woodside Mills, 319 S.C. 385, 461\r\n  S.E.2d 818 (1995), as standing â€œfor the proposition that our scheduled\r\n  compensation scheme focuses on the site of the injury and not the resulting\r\n  functional limitation.â€Â  Therrell, 370 S.C. at 29, 633 S.E.2d at 897.Â \r\n  Accordingly, because most of Collinsâ€™s evidence focuses on his hip\r\n  replacements, affirming based on an unscheduled injury and loss of earning\r\n  capacity seems more appropriate than finding he was presumptively disabled due\r\n  to a loss of both legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-389","title":"State v.

Â Inside, they discovered Morgan\r\n  and another man sleeping and a substance that appeared to be marijuana in a\r\n  nearby bowl. Â The two were placed under arrest, but as they were leaving the\r\n  scene, the arresting officer was distracted by a disturbance, and Morgan\r\n  â€œsnatched awayâ€ and ran.Â   \r\nLater, Morgan\r\n  was arrested by a different officer, Jeff Purdy, at a nearby home. Â He was\r\n  found hiding under the kitchen sink.Â  When apprehended, Morgan indicated the\r\n  police would never find the missing handcuffs. Â \r\nAt trial, Morgan\r\n  made a motion in limine seeking to suppress the introduction of any evidence\r\n  related to his subsequent arrest after his escape. He argued that the\r\n  circumstances of that arrest and any statements he made were irrelevant and prejudicial.\r\n  Â The trial court granted Morganâ€™s request in part.Â   \r\n\r\n\t[W]ith regard to\r\n  the circumstances surrounding the arrest, I think it is [of] very questionable\r\n  relevance.Â  But even if relevant . . . the prejudicial effect outweighs the\r\n  probative value and so I would not permit the testimony surrounding the\r\n  circumstances of his arrest other than to say that he was later located on such\r\n  and such a day at such and such a location and placed under arrest for escape.Â \r\n  That would be the extent of the testimony that would be allowed there, not with\r\n  regard to all the other circumstances. \r\n\r\nOn direct\r\n  examination, Officer Purdy testified that Morgan was discovered â€œhiding under\r\n  the kitchen sink.â€Â  Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, but the trial court\r\n  denied the motion reasoning that the literal interpretation of its ruling was\r\n  followed although the spirit of the ruling was violated.Â  The trial court gave\r\n  a curative instruction telling the jury to disregard any testimony concerning\r\n  Morgan hiding under the sink.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nThe decision to grant\r\n  or deny a motion for mistrial is in the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State\r\n    v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 310, 513 S.E.2d 606, 610 (1999). Â That decision\r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMorgan\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial.Â  He contends\r\n  the solicitorâ€™s intention to obey or disobey the courtâ€™s ruling is irrelevant.Â \r\n  Instead, the prejudice to the defendant is the paramount consideration.Â  We\r\n  agree, but conclude that there was no prejudice to Morgan.\r\nThe motion in\r\n  limine pointed to several things the defense wanted to exclude from testimony.Â \r\n  The trial courtâ€™s ruling restricted admission of the â€œcircumstancesâ€\r\n  surrounding Morganâ€™s second arrest, but approved testimony regarding the date\r\n  and location of his arrest.Â  Both the motion in limine and the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling are somewhat ambiguous and subject to misinterpretation.Â  The trial\r\n  court recognized as much in acknowledging that Officer Purdyâ€™s testimony was\r\n  technically proper because it was limited to the location.Â  Notably, Officer\r\n  Purdy did not testify regarding any statements made by Morgan upon his\r\n  apprehension.\r\nAfter\r\n  denying Morganâ€™s motion for mistrial, the court offered a curative instruction\r\n  telling the jury to â€œdisregard any testimony that the defendant was found,\r\n  quote, hiding under the sink.Â  That issue is not relevant to any issue in this\r\n  case and I instruct you to disregard and dismiss that from your mind, as I am\r\n  striking that testimony from the testimony in this case.â€ Â â€œGenerally, a trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s curative instruction is deemed to cure any error.â€Â  State v. Simmons,\r\n  352 S.C. 342, 354, 573 S.E.2d 856, 863 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  We see no special\r\n  circumstances in this case whereby the curative instruction was not effective\r\n  to remove any taint Officer Purdyâ€™s testimony may have caused.\r\nBased on\r\n  the foregoing, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion in\r\n  denying Morganâ€™s motion for mistrial.Â  Therefore the ruling of the trial court\r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  &nbsp;We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-397","title":"State v.

Brackett, of York; for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Christopher\r\n  Marquis Mobley appeals his conviction for attempting to purchase crack\r\n  cocaine.Â  He argues the circuit court erred in denying his motion for directed\r\n  verdict.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n\r\nFACTS \r\nOn October 2, 2003, the Union City Police\r\n  working in association with the Union County Sheriffâ€™s Office (collectively,\r\n  the Police) arrested Carlos Bailey.Â  Bailey was believed to be the head of a crack\r\n  cocaine drug ring operating in Union County.Â  Bailey was brought to the Police\r\n  station, and a cell phone in his possession was confiscated.Â Â Â   \r\nBaileyâ€™s\r\n  cell phone rang and was answered by one of the officers.Â  The officer said\r\n  â€œhelloâ€ and the caller responded by calling him â€œLoâ€ which was a known nickname\r\n  for Carlos Bailey.Â  The caller then stated that he needed a â€œhookupâ€ and told\r\n  the officer â€œI need a yard of hard.â€Â  After the caller stated that he was on\r\n  Hancock Street, the officer instructed the caller to walk up and meet him at\r\n  the â€œred light there at Monarch Highway and Highway 49 right in front of the\r\n  church there.â€Â  The caller agreed, and the officer, accompanied by a second\r\n  officer, drove to the site in an unmarked police car.Â Â Â   \r\nAs they\r\n  neared their destination, the two officers observed a man walking up Hancock Street towards the agreed upon meeting place.Â  Baileyâ€™s cell phone rang again, and\r\n  the same caller informed the officer that he was â€œon the way.â€Â  Once the Police\r\n  observed a man[2] closing in on the meeting place, one officer dialed the number from the previously\r\n  received call and observed the man answer his cell phone.Â  The officer then\r\n  asked the man if he was â€œat the red light,â€ the officer observed the man\r\n  talking into his cell phone and heard him respond through the phone that he was\r\n  at the light.Â  The Police then pulled their vehicle up to the man, identified\r\n  as Christopher Mobley, and placed him under arrest for attempting to purchase\r\n  crack cocaine.Â  The Police searched Mobley incident to arrest and found\r\n  one-hundred dollars in his left front pocket.Â  During the trial, three\r\n  different officers testified that in their experience, a â€œyard of hardâ€ was a\r\n  slang term used to delineate one-hundred dollars worth of crack cocaine.Â Â  \r\n \r\nAt the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Mobley motioned the court for a\r\n  directed verdict, and the court denied this motion.Â  The jury convicted Mobley\r\n  of attempting to purchase crack cocaine.Â  Mobley then moved for a judgment\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict, and the trial court denied this motion and\r\n  sentenced him to five years imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the\r\n  trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of\r\n    evidence, not its weight.â€Â  State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 593, 606\r\n    S.E.2d 475, 477-78 (2004).Â  When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this\r\n    Court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most\r\n    favorable to the state.Â  State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d\r\n    525, 531 (1999). Where there is any direct evidence or any substantial\r\n    circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused,\r\n    an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Cherry,\r\n  361 S.C. at 593-94, 606 S.E.2d at 478. See State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002) (on appeal from trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion for a\r\n  directed verdict, appellate court may only reverse the trial court if there is\r\n  no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  Directed Verdict\r\nMobley contends the\r\n  trial court erred in denying his motion for directed verdict.Â  Mobley maintains\r\n  that there was no direct or circumstantial evidence to support a finding that\r\n  he was guilty.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 44-53-375\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) states â€œ[a] person possessing or\r\n  attempting to possess less than one gram of methamphetamine or cocaine base, as\r\n  defined in Section 44-53-110,[3] is guilty . . . .â€Â  In this case, the State presented evidence that would allow\r\n  a reasonable jury to find Mobley attempted to possess crack cocaine.Â  In taking\r\n  the facts in the light most favorable to the State, we note the following.Â  The\r\n  Police officers testified that in their experience a â€œyard of hardâ€ meant one\r\n  hundred dollars worth of crack cocaine.Â  They further testified that when they\r\n  arrested a man believed to be the head of a drug ring, Mobley called this manâ€™s\r\n  cell phone, said he needed a hook-up, and asked for a â€œyard of hard.â€Â  In\r\n  furtherance of this request, Mobley agreed to meet at a specified place to attain\r\n  the â€œyard of hard.â€Â  The Police observed Mobley speaking to them on his cell\r\n  phone after they had called the number from the dealerâ€™s phone, and Mobley told\r\n  them he was at the agreed upon meeting place.Â  When Mobley was arrested, the\r\n  police found exactly one-hundred dollars in Mobleyâ€™s possession.Â  We find that\r\n  contrary to Mobleyâ€™s argument, he did make sufficient overt acts towards\r\n  purchasing the drugs by walking to the designated meeting place to make the\r\n  purchase.Â  We find there was sufficient evidence to support the denial of a\r\n  directed verdict motion.Â  Therefore, we find no error by the trial court.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of the directed\r\n  verdict motion.Â  Based on the foregoing, Mobleyâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] One of the officers recognized the man as Christopher\r\n  Mobley from previous interactions with him.\r\n[3] â€œâ€˜Crack cocaineâ€™ means an alkaloidal cocaine or\r\n  freebase form of cocaine, which is the end product of a chemical alteration\r\n  whereby the cocaine in salt form is converted to a form suitable for smoking.â€Â \r\n  S.C.

Johnson, of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  This is a workers compensation case.Â  The single commissioner awarded appellant\r\n  Bob J. Weatherford, the claimant, additional workersâ€™ compensation benefits,\r\n  finding he had suffered a change of condition for the worse as the result of an\r\n  earlier admitted workplace injury.Â  Respondents, Jordanâ€™s Scrap Metal Co.,\r\n  Inc., and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, appealed the single commissionerâ€™s\r\n  order to the full commission; however, the appellate panel dismissed the appeal\r\n  and assessed hearing costs against them when their counsel failed to appear for\r\n  oral argument.Â  Respondents\r\n  then appealed to the circuit court, which issued an order purporting to reverse\r\n  the appellate panelâ€™s order based on a lack of substantial evidence to support\r\n  the award of benefits to Weatherford. Â We vacate the order of the circuit court.[1]\r\n1.Â  Respondentsâ€™ complaints\r\n  about the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Weatherfordâ€™s claim concerned\r\n  the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  Any challenge to this order cannot, under the\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act, be the subject of judicial review by the circuit\r\n  court.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A) (Supp. 2006) (stating that one\r\n  â€œwho is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to\r\n  judicial review) (emphasis added); Ross v. American Red Cross, 298 S.C.\r\n  490, 492, 381 S.E.2d 728, 730 (1989) (referring to the full commission as the\r\n  â€œultimate fact finderâ€ in workersâ€™ compensation cases).\r\n2.Â  In the\r\n  appealed order, the circuit court appears to have assumed the appellate panel\r\n  adopted the findings of the single commissioner.[2]Â \r\n  To the contrary, however, the appellate panel made no direct or indirect\r\n  findings of fact concerning the merits of either Weatherfordâ€™s claim or the\r\n  single commissionerâ€™s order. Â Instead, the appellate panel limited its decision\r\n  to a dismissal of Respondentsâ€™ appeal with prejudice on procedural grounds and\r\n  a mandate that they were to pay the hearing costs. Â Respondents neither moved\r\n  to reinstate their appeal nor argued the appellate panel was incorrect in\r\n  finding that they failed to perfect it; therefore, the dismissal of\r\n  Respondentsâ€™ appeal of the single commissionerâ€™s order stands.Â  See Parker\r\n    v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 288 S.C. 304, 308, 342 S.E.2d 403, 405 (1986) (â€œNo objection can be made to an appealable order from which no\r\n  appeal has been taken.â€); Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins.

Respondent D&amp;N Realty has sold three of the\r\n  subdivided lots and currently owns Lot 2(B).Â  By deed dated July 29, 2002,\r\n  Respondent HHI Corporation purchased Lot 2(D), one of the lots subdivided from Lot 2, from Respondent D&amp;N Realty.Â  Each of the lots involved in this action was once\r\n  owned by Josephine Driessen.Â  On August 30, 1972, Driessen sold Lots 3 and 4 to\r\n  Roscoe and Clara Mae Robinson.Â  The deed for the transaction contained the\r\n  following restrictions:\r\n\r\n\tThis conveyance is made by the Grantor and accepted by the\r\n  Grantees subject to the restriction that that area shown on said plat as lying\r\n  between the drainage ditch and the mean high water mark of the waters of the\r\n  Atlantic Ocean shall be left unimproved and no structure of any nature\r\n  whatsoever erected thereon without express written consent of the Grantor which\r\n  may be arbitrarily withheld.Â  With regard to the remainder of the premises\r\n  located west of the above-mentioned drainage ditch, it is understood and agreed\r\n  that each of these lots is to be used for single-family residential purposes\r\n  only and that no commercial activity of any nature whatsoever shall be\r\n  established, kept or maintained thereon.\r\n\r\nBy written\r\n  instrument recorded on September 28, 1972, the parties to the initial\r\n  transaction altered the deed by rescinding the restrictions recited above and\r\n  replacing them with the following:  \r\n\r\n\tIt is understood and agreed by and between JOSEPHINE DRIESSEN and\r\n  ROSCOE ROBINSON and CLARA MAE ROBINSON that Lots 3 and 4 as described in that\r\n  Deed recorded in the Office of the Clerk of Court for Beaufort County, South\r\n  Carolina, in Deed Book 201 at Page 936 shall not be used for construction of\r\n  any type of amusement building thereon, nor shall any type of amusement\r\n  facility be operated thereon.Â  It is further understood and agreed that ROSCOE\r\n  ROBINSON and CLARA MAE ROBINSON, their Heirs and Assigns, shall not in any way\r\n  alter or destroy the sand dunes existing on the property.\r\n\r\nDriessen\r\n  died on October 27, 1989.Â  On June 5, 2001, Appellant acquired the property\r\n  from the Robinsons.Â  The deed from the Robinsons to the Appellant inadvertently\r\n  contained the exact same restrictions originally included in the deed from\r\n  Driessen to Roscoe and Clara Mae Robinson.Â Â Â   \r\nOn\r\n  February 25, 2003, the Robinsons issued a second deed to correct the â€œscrivenerâ€™s\r\n  errorâ€ by entirely removing the restrictions contained in the first deed to\r\n  Appellant and replacing it with the following restrictions:  \r\n\r\n\tLots 3 and 4 as described in that Deed recorded in Office of the\r\n  Clerk of Court for Beaufort County, South Carolina, in Deed Book 201 at Page\r\n  936 shall not be used for construction of any type of amusement building\r\n  thereon, nor shall any type of amusement facility be operated thereon.Â \r\n  Further, [Grantee], its successor and assigns, shall not in any way alter or destroy\r\n  the sand dunes existing on the property.\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  March 8, 2003, Driessenâ€™s surviving heirs executed an instrument titled\r\n  â€œAGREEMENT (Quitclaim Deed with Limited Warranty)â€.Â  This agreement purported\r\n  to release and relinquish any and all rights under the deed restrictions,\r\n  cancel the deed restrictions, and render the restrictions null and void.Â \r\n \r\nRespondents\r\n  initiated these actions seeking declaratory judgments as to the applicability\r\n  of the restrictions with respect to Appellantâ€™s property.[2]Â  Respondents claimed standing based\r\n  on their properties and the property of Appellant being adjacent and sharing a\r\n  common source of title, and Respondents claimed the restrictions in Appellantâ€™s\r\n  deed were valid and enforceable as real covenants which ran with the land. Â Appellant\r\n  contended the restrictions were personal to the Grantor and did not run with\r\n  the land and contended the Respondents, as strangers to the transaction between\r\n  Appellant and the Robinsons, lacked standing to seek a declaration or enforcement\r\n  of the restrictions.\r\nThe\r\n  lower court framed the issue as whether the restrictions contained in the\r\n  instrument recorded â€œon September 28, 1972, [are] real covenant[s] running with\r\n  the land that can be enforced by subsequent grantees of Josephine Driessenâ€¦.â€Â \r\n  By order dated March 5, 2004, the lower court held the restrictions were â€œreal\r\n  covenant[s], running with the land, enforceable byâ€ Respondents.Â  This appeal\r\n  follows.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nâ€œA\r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991). In the present case, the underlying\r\n  issue is a declaration as to whether or not the restrictive covenants are\r\n  enforceable.Â  Therefore, this is an equitable action.Â  See Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 165, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541 (2006).Â  In\r\n  an equity action, the appellate court may review the evidence to determine the\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence.Â  Florence County Sch.\r\n    Dist. #2 v. Interkal, Inc., 348 S.C. 446, 450, 559 S.E.2d 866, 868 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002).Â  Furthermore, the appellate court is not bound by the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  legal determinations.Â  Swindler v. Swindler, 355 S.C. 245, 249, 584\r\n  S.E.2d 438, 440 (Ct. App. 2003).  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDeed\r\n  Restrictions\r\nThe lower court based its holding that the restrictions were real\r\n  covenants and, therefore, ran with the land on the language contained in the\r\n  preamble and express wordage of the instrument recorded on September 28, 1972.Â \r\n  The preamble to the instrument states that the â€œDeed of Conveyance did contain\r\n  certain restrictions and limitations running with the landâ€ and that Driessen\r\n  was then â€œdesirous of releasing and/or modifyingâ€ the restrictions.Â  The text\r\n  of the instrument states that Driessen â€œin substitution thereof does herewith\r\n  impose the following restrictions upon the said property in lieu of those\r\n  previously governing the sameâ€:\r\n\r\n\tÂ It is understood and agreed by and between JOSEPHINE DRIESSEN and\r\n  ROSCOE ROBINSON and CLARA MAE ROBINSON that Lots 3 and 4 as described in that\r\n  Deed recorded in Office of the Clerk of Court for Beaufort County, South\r\n  Carolina, in Deed Book 201 at Page 936 shall not be used for construction of\r\n  any type of amusement building thereon, nor shall any type of amusement\r\n  facility be operated thereon.Â  It is further understood and agreed that ROSCOE\r\n  ROBINSON and CLARA MAE ROBINSON, their Heirs and Assigns, shall not in any way\r\n  alter or destroy the sand dunes existing on the property.Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œA restrictive covenant runs with the land, and is thus\r\n  enforceable by a successor-in-interest, if the covenanting party intended that\r\n  it run with the land, and the covenant touches and concerns the land.â€Â  West v. Newberry Elec. Co-op.,&nbsp; 357 S.C. 537, 542, 593 S.E.2d 500, 503&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2004) (citing Marathon\r\n    Fin. Co. v. HHC Liquidation Corp., 325 S.C. 589, 604, 483 S.E.2d 757, 765 (Ct. App. 1997)).Â  A\r\n  party seeking to enforce a covenant must show it applies to the property either\r\n  by its express language or by a plain and unmistakable implication.Â  Sea\r\n    Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 363 S.E.2d 891 (1987).Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tRestrictive\r\n  covenants are to be construed most strictly against the grantor and persons\r\n  seeking to enforce them, and liberally in favor of the grantee, all doubts\r\n  being resolved in favor of a free use of property and against restrictions.\r\n  This rule, however, obtains only where the parties have failed to express their\r\n  meaning with sufficient clarity to enable the court to say that its construction\r\n  is plain and admits of no doubt; the rule will not be applied to defeat the\r\n  obvious purpose of the restrictions, nor does it require an unnatural and\r\n  strained construction of the words used; and before giving effect to the rule\r\n  the court will have recourse to every aid, rule, or cannon of construction to\r\n  ascertain the intention of the parties, since it is the duty of the courts to\r\n  enforce, not to make, contracts. \r\n\r\nStanton v. Gulf Oil Corp.,&nbsp;232 S.C. 148, 151, 101\r\n  S.E.2d 250, 251&nbsp;(1957) (citation omitted).\r\nThe express language of the preamble to the instrument executed by\r\n  Driessen reveals that the original restrictions were intended to run with the\r\n  land.Â  The language of the instrument also reveals that the purpose for\r\n  executing the instrument was to substitute the original restrictions with the\r\n  newly drafted restrictions.Â  Accordingly, the newly drafted restrictions would\r\n  have the same future application as the original restrictions.Â  The instrument\r\n  clearly illustrates Driessenâ€™s intent to have the restrictions run with the\r\n  land.Â  Moreover, as to the restriction prohibiting the altering or destruction\r\n  of the sand dunes existing on Lot 3 and 4, the language of the restriction\r\n  expressly states that that restriction is to apply to the heirs and assigns of\r\n  the Robinsons.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  generally accepted test provides that the benefit of a covenant meets the touch\r\n  and concern requirement if â€œthe covenanteeâ€™s legal interest in land is rendered\r\n  more valuable by the covenantâ€™s performance.â€ 5 R. Powell &amp; P. Rohan, Powell\r\n    on Real Property Â 673[2], at\r\n  60-49-60-50 (rev. ed. 1996).Â  The restrictions at issue render the surrounding lots more valuable.Â  Eugene J. Laurich, the self\r\n  proclaimed â€œD in D&amp;N Realtyâ€, testified that the restriction on Lot 3 and 4\r\n  made Lot 2 more valuable because they insured Lots 2(B) and 2(D) would be\r\n  entitled to an unobstructed view down the beach and across Folly Creek.Â  In his\r\n  testimony, he cited the restrictions as being the reason D&amp;N Realty decided\r\n  to cease its initial efforts to purchase Lots 3 and 4 and to purchase Lot 2 instead. Â These restrictions limit\r\n  the use of the property by prohibiting\r\n  the building or operation of any amusement facility on Lot 3 and 4 and by\r\n  prohibiting the alteration or destruction of the sand dunes on Lots 3 and 4. Â The\r\n  restrictions also increase the value of Respondentsâ€™ property. Â Â Accordingly, the restrictions touch and concern the\r\n  land. See West v. Newberry\r\n    Elec. Co-op.,&nbsp; 357 S.C. 537, 543,\r\n  593 S.E.2d 500, 503&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004); See also Marathon Finance Co. v. HHC Liquidation Corp.,&nbsp; 325 S.C. 589, 606, 483 S.E.2d 757, 766&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 1997)(Cureton, J. dissenting).\r\nÂ Because we find Driessen intended to have the restrictions run\r\n  with the land and find the restrictions touch and concern the land, we affirm\r\n  the lower courtâ€™s determination that the restrictions are real covenants which\r\n  run with the land and, therefore, are enforceable by Respondents.Â   \r\nCancellation\r\n  of the Deed Restrictions\r\nOur\r\n  determination of the first issue is dispositive of this issue. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an\r\n  appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nFor\r\n  the reasons stated above, the order of the lower court isÂ   \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The parties and the lower court refer to the\r\n  pertinent section of the instrument as being a restriction.Â  There are two\r\n  separate restrictions included in the section.Â  The first restriction is a\r\n  prohibition against the building or operation of any amusement facility on Lots\r\n  3 and 4, and the second restriction is a prohibition against altering or destroying\r\n  the sand dunes on Lots 3 and 4.\r\n[2] These actions were consolidated and tried together,\r\n  and the parties submitted a consolidated record on appeal.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  have consolidated the opinions for these two cases.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
