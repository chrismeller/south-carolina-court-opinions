Tyson Nettles, of Charleston, for\r\n          Appellant Guardian ad Litem.\r\n        David K. Haller, of Charleston, for Appellant\r\n          Latrina R.\r\n        Bonnie T. Brisbane, of North Charleston,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Latrina R. (Mother) appeals from the\r\n  family court's order terminating her parental rights (TPR) to A.F. and J.F.\r\n  (Children).Â  Mother argues the Charleston\r\n  County Department of Social Services (DSS) did not prove by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence the multiple grounds upon which the family court terminated\r\n  her parental rights.Â  Mother further argues the application of section\r\n  63-7-1710(B) of the South Carolina Code (2008) was unconstitutional because DSS\r\n  decided the Children would be adopted before Mother had a full opportunity to\r\n  be heard.Â  Â Lastly, Mother argues the family court erred in finding TPR was in\r\n  the Children's best interest despite the guardian ad litem's (GAL) contrary\r\n  recommendation. Â Further, the GAL appeals, arguing (1) the TPR action was time\r\n  barred because the permanency planning order of the family court required DSS\r\n  to initiate the TPR action within sixty days and (2) the family court\r\n  essentially overruled the prior order of another family court judge in allowing\r\n  the action to proceed when the prior order was the law of the case. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nDSS took the Children into custody\r\n  in May of 2005.Â  A permanency planning hearing was held March 10, 2006,\r\n  and the family court ordered DSS to initiate the TPR action within sixty\r\n  days.Â Â  However, DSS did not file the TPR action until February of 2007.Â  The\r\n  family court held the TPR hearing from June 16 to 18, 2008.Â  At the time of the\r\n  hearing, Mother, a recovering drug addict, was living in a residential\r\n  treatment facility where children were not allowed, and she had not used drugs\r\n  since July of 2007.Â Â  \r\n1. As to the GAL's\r\n  argument the TPR action was time barred, section\r\n  63-7-1700(E) of the South Carolina Code (2008) provides if the court determines\r\n  at the permanency planning hearing the child should not be returned to the\r\n  parent at the time, the court's order must require DSS to file a TPR petition\r\n  no later than sixty days after receipt of the order.Â  However, an appellant\r\n  must demonstrate prejudice to be afforded relief on appeal.Â  Sanders v.\r\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 379 S.C. 554, 562, 666 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008).Â  \r\nThe GAL does not specifically\r\n  articulate a prejudice argument on behalf of the Children; rather, he generally\r\n  states that the timely determination of custody and adherence to procedure\r\n  provides a just result.Â  While we agree with the GAL's observation, the\r\n  prejudice to the Children is unclear.Â  The testimony shows A.F. worked through\r\n  her grief and found peace in her pre-adoptive home, and J.F. did not remember\r\n  Mother or have any concept of the proceedings.Â  Mother also does not\r\n  specifically argue prejudice.Â  Mother did argue the delay effectively caused\r\n  the Children to be in foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months.Â \r\n  However, Mother was still using drugs and had not provided support within sixty\r\n  days of the permanency planning hearing.Â  Therefore, any prejudice the delay\r\n  caused her is unclear.Â  \r\n2. Concerning the GAL's argument that\r\n  the family court overruled a previous family court order that was the law of\r\n  the case, this argument was not raised, and thus, it is not preserved for\r\n  review.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412,\r\n  529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (&quot;It is well-settled that an issue cannot be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.&quot;).\r\n3. We affirm the family court's\r\n  finding TPR was proper under section 63-7-2570(4) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2008) because under the circumstances, Mother's support payments totaling $215\r\n  and Christmas gifts were not material contributions to the Children's support.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 839&nbsp;(1992)\r\n  (&quot;Conduct of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental\r\n  duties may fairly be characterized as 'willful' because it manifests a\r\n  conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and\r\n  consortium from the parent.&quot;); Â S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings,&nbsp;345\r\n  S.C. 288, 296, 547 S.E.2d 506, 511&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (finding\r\n  judicially-motivated repentance, standing alone, rarely warrants a finding of\r\n  curative conduct, and it must be considered together with all the relevant\r\n  facts and circumstances).[2]Â  \r\n4. Concerning Mother's argument that\r\n  the application of section 63-7-1710(B) of the South Carolina Code (2008) was\r\n  unconstitutional because DSS decided the Children would be adopted before\r\n  Mother had a full opportunity to be heard, section 63-7-1710(B) mandates:Â \r\n  &quot;Concurrently with filing of the petition [for TPR], [DSS] shall seek to\r\n  identify, recruit, process, and approve a qualified family for adoption of the\r\n  child if an adoptive family has not yet been selected and approved.&quot;Â \r\n  Furthermore, Mother had notice and a full opportunity to be heard.\r\n5. Despite Mother's\r\n  arguments to the contrary, our review of\r\n  the record indicates TPR is in the Childrenâ€™s best interests.Â  In a termination\r\n  of parental rights case, the best interests of the child are the paramount\r\n  consideration.Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133,\r\n  538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  If the parent's and child's interests\r\n  conflict, the child's interest prevails.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2620\r\n  (2008).Â  The court considered the GAL's recommendation to return the Children\r\n  to Mother but found it benefited Mother rather than recognizing the Children's\r\n  interests prevailed.Â  Mother did not have a home for the Children, and she has\r\n  a history of drug abuse with periods of sobriety and relapse.Â  Mother admitted\r\n  neglecting the Children when using drugs, and she had not completed a treatment\r\n  plan.Â  Additionally, the record contained evidence the Children were settled in\r\n  with a stable pre-adoptive family and were doing well socially and\r\n  academically.Â  Accordingly, the court did not err in finding the termination of\r\n  Mother's parental rights was proper.Â  \r\nThe family court order terminating\r\n  the parental rights of Mother isÂ Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J.,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â Â  Once one statutory ground is met, this court need\r\n  not address whether any other ground for TPR has not been proved.Â  Stinecipher\r\n    v. Ballington, 366 S.C. 92, 100 n.6, 620 S.E.2d 93, 98 n.6 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-571","title":"The State v.

Aiken,&nbsp;369 S.C.\r\n  160, 164-65, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541&nbsp;(2006).Â  A determination of ownership of\r\n  personal property is a matter at law and, on appeal, review is limited to\r\n  determining whether any evidence supported the circuit court's decision.Â  In\r\n    re Estate of Watford, 305 S.C. 535, 536, 409 S.E.2d 791, 792 (Ct. App.\r\n  1991).Â  \r\n&quot;A certificate of title\r\n  issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles is prima facie evidence of the facts\r\n  appearing on it.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-19-320 (2006).Â  The certificate of\r\n  title statute creates a rebuttable presumption that the vehicle's owner is the\r\n  owner reflected on the title document.Â  Tollison v. Reaves, 277 S.C.\r\n  443, 445, 289 S.E.2d 163, 164 (1982).Â  This presumption may be overcome &quot;by\r\n  evidence that the true owner of the vehicle is a person other than the one in\r\n  whose name the vehicle is registered.&quot;Â  Id.; see, e.g., Bankers Ins. Co. of Pa. v. Griffin, 244 S.C. 552, 558, 137 S.E.2d 785,\r\n  786 (1964) (holding man who made all payments on, purchased insurance for, and\r\n  operated vehicle was true owner, and not his brother, in whose name vehicle was\r\n  titled).Â  \r\nHere, the circuit court's\r\n  decision is supported by evidence in the record.Â  The certificate of title\r\n  issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles on July 17, 2001, created a\r\n  rebuttable presumption that the 2001 ambulance was owned jointly by the County\r\n  and the Squad.Â  See Â§ 56-19-320; Tollison, 277 S.C. at 445, 289 S.E.2d at 164.Â  The Squad\r\n  presented evidence it had negotiated the price and features of the vehicle,\r\n  secured and repaid a loan for the full cost, and exclusively used and\r\n  maintained the vehicle.Â  However, the County supplied insurance and license\r\n  plates for the vehicle and reimbursed the Squad for more than half the cost of\r\n  the ambulance with State-provided grant money and County funds that were earmarked\r\n  for the purchase of the ambulance.[1]Â  Furthermore, four of the County's five payments to\r\n  the Squad occurred during the fifteen-month term of the Squad's loan.Â  Consequently,\r\n  the Squad failed to rebut the presumption of co-ownership.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.[2]Â  \r\nHUFF and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\n  and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] According to the County, the parties made an\r\n  agreement pursuant to the County's Capital Growth Plan that the County would\r\n  partially fund the ambulance purchase.Â  The County's payments included\r\n  $13,396.60 in grants from the South Carolina Department of Health and\r\n  Environmental Control and matching funds of 5.5%, or $736.81, from the County.Â \r\n  Both parties participated in applying for the grant money.Â Â Â  \r\n[2] We do not address the Squad's argument concerning\r\n  equitable theories of constructive or resulting trust because this argument is\r\n  unpreserved.Â  &quot;It is\r\n  axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the [circuit court] to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.&quot;Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497\r\n  S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  In\r\n  its reply brief, the Squad argues against the theories of County ownership\r\n  arising from an equitable trust.Â  However, this argument was not raised to or\r\n  ruled upon by the circuit court.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-593","title":"The State v.

Casey Manning, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2009-UP-594\r\n  Heard December 10, 2009 â€“ Filed December\r\n16, 2009\r\nWithdrawn, Substituted and RefiledÂ  March\r\n4, 2010\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Adrian Hammond, pro se, of Columbia, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Dennis Gerald and Milton Gary Kimpson, both\r\n          of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Adrian Hammond appeals the\r\n  trial court's dismissal of his legal malpractice claim against Dennis M.\r\n  Gerald, Milton Kimpson, and Gerald and Kimpson, LLC (collectively Respondents).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn January of 1994, at the\r\n  age of sixteen, Hammond was indicted for murder and assault.Â  Approximately one\r\n  year later, Hammond hired Respondents to pursue a negligence action against\r\n  Knight-Ridder, Inc. for publishing his name and identity in violation of section\r\n  20-7-780 of the South Carolina Code.[1]Â \r\n  Hammond filed suit in January 1997; however, a year later the trial court\r\n  dismissed the case, finding (1) in State, ex rel., The Times &amp; Democrat,\r\n  276 S.C. 26, 274 S.E.2d 910 (1981), the South Carolina Supreme Court found\r\n  identical language in another statute unconstitutional; (2) in 1993 the Office\r\n  of the Attorney General opined section 20-7-780 was unconstitutional; and (3)\r\n  section 20-7-780 was repealed on July 1, 1996.[2]Â \r\n  Shortly thereafter, Respondents informed Hammond no further legal action was\r\n  available because section 20-7-780 had been repealed.Â  \r\nOn September 28, 2002,\r\n  Hammond learned Knight-Ridder declined to publish the names of two South\r\n  Carolina juveniles charged with murder.Â  Subsequently, Hammond discovered\r\n  section 20-7-8510(B) of the South Carolina Code contained language\r\n  substantially similar to section 20-7-780 and felt section 20-7-8510(B)\r\n  provided him with recourse against Knight-Ridder.[3]Â \r\n  On September 28, 2005, Hammond filed a legal malpractice action, pro se,\r\n  against Respondents, alleging failure to research other avenues of recovery,\r\n  investigate the existence of other defendants, and investigate other instances\r\n  of publication.Â  However, Hammond failed to serve his summons and complaint on Respondents.Â \r\n  Hammond subsequently filed a purported amended complaint on January 12, 2006.Â \r\n  Hammond served the summons and amended complaint on Gerald on January 20, 2006,\r\n  and Kimpson on February 9, 2006.[4]Â  \r\nRespondents moved to dismiss\r\n  Hammond's action and for summary judgment.Â  The trial court noted Hammond\r\n  should have known of his claim in December of 1997 when his case against\r\n  Knight-Ridder was dismissed, and therefore held Hammond failed to commence his\r\n  action within the three-year statute of limitations.Â  The trial court also\r\n  found Hammond failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action\r\n  for legal malpractice noting he failed to show section 20-7-8510(B) provided\r\n  him a private cause of action.Â  Ultimately, the trial court granted the motions\r\n  to dismiss.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHammond alleges Respondents\r\n  were negligent in failing to bring an action against Knight-Ridder under\r\n  section 20-7-8510(B). Â We disagree. Â \r\nIn this case, Hammond failed\r\n  to state facts sufficient to support a cause of action because no evidence\r\n  supports the proposition that Hammond is of the class of persons section\r\n  20-7-8510(B) is designed to protect. See Rayfield v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Corrs., 297 S.C. 95, 103, 374 S.E.2d 910, 914&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1988) (stating\r\n  an appellant must demonstrate &quot;(1) that the essential purpose of the\r\n  statute is to protect from the kind of harm the plaintiff has suffered; and (2)\r\n  that he is a member of the class of persons the statute is intended to protect&quot;). \r\nSection 20-7-8510(B) provides:\r\n  &quot;The name, identity, or picture of a child under the jurisdiction of the\r\n  [family court], . . . must not be provided to or made public by a newspaper or\r\n  radio or television station except as authorized by order of the [family\r\n  court].&quot;Â  In this regard, section 20-7-6605(1) defines a child as &quot;a\r\n  person less than seventeen years of age&quot; but specifically excludes from\r\n  such definition &quot;a person sixteen . . . or older who is charged with . . .\r\n  a felony which provides for a maximum term of imprisonment of fifteen years or\r\n  more.&quot;[5]Â \r\n  Thus, as Hammond was sixteen years of age at the time of his indictment for\r\n  murder, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of thirty years'\r\n  imprisonment, Hammond is not within the class of persons sought to be protected\r\n  by section 20-7-8510(B).Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(A) (Supp. 2008) (&quot;A\r\n  person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to murder must be punished by\r\n  death, by imprisonment for life, or by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment\r\n  for thirty years&quot;).[6]Â \r\n  Therefore, the trial court properly granted Respondents' motion to dismiss.\r\nAccordingly, the ruling of\r\n  the trial court is\r\nAffirmed.\r\nShort, Thomas, and Konduros, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  At the time of publication, section 20-7-780\r\n  provided: &quot;The name, identity or picture of any child under the\r\n  jurisdiction of the [family court], . . . shall not be made public by any\r\n  newspaper, radio or television station except as authorized by order of the\r\n  [family court].&quot;Â  \r\n[2]Â Â  Section 20-7-780 was repealed on July 1, 1996, by\r\n  1996 Act No. 383, Â§ 2.Â  \r\n[3] Â On\r\n  July 1, 1996, the same day section 20-7-780 was repealed by 1996 Act No. 383, Â§\r\n  2, section 20-7-8510(B) was enacted by 1996 Act No. 383, Â§ 1, and provided:\r\n  &quot;The name, identity, or picture of a child under the jurisdiction of the\r\n  [family court], . . . must not be provided to or made public by a newspaper or\r\n  radio or television station except as authorized by order of the [family\r\n  court].&quot;Â  Section 20-7-8510(B) has been revised by 2000 Act No. 388, Â§ 4,\r\n  and the above language was deleted.Â  Section 20-7-8510 is now section\r\n  63-19-2020 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008). \r\n[4] The record does not indicate whether Gerald and\r\n  Kimpson, LLC was served.\r\n[5] This definition is now found at section 63-19-20(1)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008).\r\n[6] As to Hammond's additional allegations that Respondents\r\n  were negligent in failing to investigate other defendants and other instances\r\n  of publication, we agree with the trial court that Hammond should have been\r\n  aware of these claims at the time his original claim was dismissed, and are\r\n  therefore barred by the statute of limitation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-3-535 (2005) (making the limitations period for a legal malpractice claim\r\n  begin to run when the person &quot;knew or by the exercise of reasonable\r\n  diligence should have known that he had a cause of action&quot;).Â  We need not\r\n  address the remaining issues on appeal. See Futch v. McAllister\r\n    Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n  (stating an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its\r\n  determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-599","title":"Paris Mountain Utilities, Inc.,  v.

Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(B) (2006) (stating that failure by the arresting officer\r\n  &quot;to produce&quot; a videotape is not a ground alone for dismissal of a DUI\r\n  charge if the arresting officer submits a sworn affidavit certifying that the\r\n  video equipment was in an inoperable condition and that reasonable efforts have\r\n  been made to maintain the equipment in an operable condition); Â State v.\r\n    Dicapua, 373 S.C. 452, 457, 646 S.E.2d 150, 153 (Ct.

The Department contends\r\n  the ALC erred in dismissing the case because it complied with all ALC\r\n  procedural rules in preparing its appeal.Â  We remand.[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe ALC dismissed the Department's case pursuant to\r\n  ALC Rule 59, holding the Department failed to comply with the rules of\r\n  procedure in its appeal.Â  This was error.Â  \r\nALC Rule 59 sets forth the time limits to file the\r\n  record for an appeal of a prison disciplinary conviction:\r\n\r\n\tWithin forty-five (45) days of the date the case is\r\n  assigned to an Administrative Law Judge (date of assignment), the agency shall\r\n  file the record with the court, including a statement of the contents of the\r\n  record, unless the time for filing the record is extended by the Administrative\r\n  Law Judge assigned to the appeal. \r\n\r\nALC Rule 53(A) sets forth the requirements for filing\r\n  a document: \r\n\r\n\tThe date of filing is the date of delivery or the date\r\n  of mailing as shown by the postmark or by the date stamp affixed by the mail\r\n  room at the appellant's correctional institution.Â  Any document filed with the\r\n  Court shall be accompanied by proof of service of such document on all\r\n  parties.Â  A document, pleading, or motion or other paper is deemed filed by the\r\n  Court by:\r\n\t(1)Â  delivering the document to the Court; or\r\n\t(2)Â  by depositing the document in the U.S. mail,\r\n  properly addressed to the Court, with sufficient first class postage attached.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn the case at bar, on February 28, 2008, the ALC gave\r\n  the Department a 90-day extension to file the record on appeal with the court.Â \r\n  The Department maintains it properly filed the documents on May 13, 2008, via\r\n  U.S. mail, well within the deadline for filing provided by the ALC.Â  In support\r\n  of its proposition, the Department submitted a letter establishing it mailed\r\n  the record on appeal to the ALC on May 13, 2008.Â  Because evidence in the\r\n  record suggests that the Department properly complied with the applicable time\r\n  limits, we remand the case to the ALC for an evidentiary hearing to determine\r\n  if the Department made a good faith effort to timely file the record on appeal.Â  See ALC Rule 62 (&quot;Upon the motion of any party, or on its own\r\n  motion, an Administrative Law Judge may dismiss an appeal for failure to comply\r\n  with any of the rules of procedure for appeals, including the failure to comply\r\n  with any of the time limits . . . . Notwithstanding the time frames established\r\n  herein, the Administrative Law Judge has the discretion to determine that a\r\n  document is timely filed upon a finding that the party who filed the document\r\n  made a good faith effort to file the document within the applicable time\r\n  limits.&quot;).Â  \r\nREMANDED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-606","title":"State v.

Pachak, of\r\n          Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        John Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal of Michael Anthony\r\n  Still's probation revocation.Â  Still contends he made no valid waiver of the right to counsel and the right to be\r\n  present at sentencing.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nOn December 3, 2007, Still\r\n  pled guilty to aggravated stalking and received a sentence of ten years'\r\n  imprisonment, suspended upon the service of time served and five years'\r\n  probation.Â  On December 5, 2007, a warrant for his arrest was issued, alleging\r\n  Still failed to report to a probation office immediately after his release from\r\n  a detention center and failed to report to his mother's home in Denmark,\r\n  staying instead at his sister's home in Swansea.Â  On December 8, 2007, Still\r\n  appeared at a probation violation hearing where he was represented by two\r\n  public defenders.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, Still\r\n  explained he did not voluntarily violate the conditions of his probation but\r\n  made a good faith effort to comply.Â  Still asserted he believed he could stay\r\n  with his mother but discovered after his release that her landlord\r\n  disapproved.Â Â  Still said he waited two days before calling the probation\r\n  office because his sister's house lost power and she only had a cordless\r\n  phone.Â  The circuit court found Still had violated his probation and ordered\r\n  him back to jail.Â  However, the circuit court did not impose the sentence at\r\n  the hearing, explaining, &quot;I might want to get [Still] reevaluated one more\r\n  time by a forensic psychiatrist.&quot;Â  Without further proceedings, the\r\n  circuit court issued a revocation order dated December 18, 2007, reiterating\r\n  the finding that Still violated probation, revoking his probation, and\r\n  reinstating the remaining eight years and three hundred forty-six days of his\r\n  suspended sentence.Â  \r\n&quot;The determination of\r\n  whether to revoke probation in whole or in part rests within the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial court.&quot;Â  State v. Allen, 370 S.C. 88, 94,\r\n  634 S.E.2d 653, 655 (2006); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-460 (2007).Â  An appellate\r\n  court's authority to review such a decision is confined to correcting errors of\r\n  law unless the lack of legal or evidentiary basis indicates the circuit court's\r\n  decision was arbitrary and capricious. State v. Williamson, 356 S.C.\r\n  507, 510, 589 S.E.2d 787, 788 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n&quot;A defendant has a\r\n  constitutional right to be present at every stage of the criminal proceeding\r\n  against him.&quot;Â  In re Dwayne M., 287 S.C. 413, 414, 339 S.E.2d 130,\r\n  130 (1986).Â  In South Carolina, all persons charged with probation violations\r\n  have a right to counsel.Â  Barlet v. State, 288 S.C. 481, 483, 343 S.E.2d\r\n  620, 622 (1986); Rule 602(a), SCACR.Â  A probationer's right to counsel arises\r\n  pursuant to the Due Process Clause under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.Â  Turner\r\n    v. State, 384 S.C. 451, ___, 682 S.E.2d 792, 794 (2009) (citing Gagnon\r\n      v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790 (1973)).Â  The erroneous deprivation of this\r\n  right constitutes per se reversible error.Â  State v. Thompson, 355 S.C.\r\n  255, 261, 584 S.E.2d 131, 134 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nThe question of whether a\r\n  defendant's probation should be revoked in whole or in part is committed to the\r\n  circuit court's sound discretion.Â  State v. Knapp, 338 S.C. 541, 543, 526\r\n  S.E.2d 741, 742 (Ct. App. 2000); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-460\r\n  (2007).Â  The authority of the revoking court should always be predicated upon\r\n  an evidentiary showing of fact tending to establish a violation of conditions,\r\n  and before revoking probation the circuit court must determine whether\r\n  sufficient evidence established that the conditions of probation were\r\n  violated.Â  State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, 648-49, 511 S.E.2d 94, 97\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nStill does not challenge the\r\n  legality of the sentence he received at the plea hearing; rather, he contends\r\n  the circuit court's written order of revocation was a &quot;sentencing&quot; to\r\n  which he had the right of attendance and counsel.Â  It is uncontested Still was\r\n  present and represented by counsel at the probation revocation hearing.Â \r\n  Accordingly, Still was afforded due process and his argument is without merit.\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-619","title":"The State v.

(Father and Mother) regaining\r\n  custody of their minor children (Daughter and Son, collectively Children).Â  We\r\n  affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n While Father was married to another woman, he began\r\n  dating Mother.Â  Thereafter, Mother became pregnant with Father's child,\r\n  Daughter.Â  However, Father and Mother stopped seeing each other prior to\r\n  Daughter's birth on June 29, 2002.Â  In 2004, Father and Mother started dating\r\n  again.Â  Subsequently, Father divorced his wife, and on March 13, 2005, Father\r\nand Mother married.Â  Father has three sons from his previous marriage.Â  \r\nDSS first\r\n  became involved with Father and Mother in 2004, when allegations arose that\r\n  Daughter had been physically abused.Â  Two instances triggered DSS involvement.\r\n  First, Daughter's daycare provider alleged Daughter had been physically abused.Â \r\n  Second, Father and Mother failed to follow a doctor's instruction to have\r\n  Daughter x-rayed.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  November 30, 2004, Dr. Dan Robinson referred Daughter to Dr. Steve Skinner for\r\n  an evaluation because there was an eight-month history of recurring pain and\r\n  swelling in Daughter's lower legs. During the appointment, Dr. Skinner noted\r\n  there was trauma over Daughter's mid spine that had healed and bruises on her\r\n  buttocks, back, right arm, and left foot; however, Dr. Skinner did not suspect\r\n  abuse.Â  Dr. Skinner recommended Mother take Daughter to the hospital for an\r\n  x-ray.Â  According to Mother, she waited at the hospital with Daughter for one\r\n  hour; however, they left before having an x-ray because Dr. Skinner did not\r\n  tell her it was urgent and Daughter was hungry and tired.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  December 11, 2004, Emmie Burns, Daughter's babysitter, observed Daughter\r\n  complaining of pain in her left leg.Â  As a result, Burns contacted Dr. Skinner\r\n  and Mother about the pain in Daughter's leg.Â  Later that day, Burns took\r\n  Daughter to the emergency room where Dr. Skinner ordered a full body x-ray.Â \r\n  The x-ray revealed multiple fractures involving the left lower leg, left femur,\r\n  and left upper arm.Â  The fractures were isolated to Daughter's left side and\r\n  all were in various stages of healing, ranging three to four weeks.Â  Dr.\r\n  Skinner consulted with Dr. John Cathcart, an orthopedic surgeon, who previously\r\n  examined Daughter.Â  On December 13, 2004, Dr. Skinner and Dr. Cathcart admitted\r\n  Daughter to the hospital for casting.Â  The same day, Mother went into preterm\r\n  labor with Son.Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  Daughter was taken into emergency protective custody.Â  Gerald and Fay E.,\r\n  Daughter's maternal relatives, volunteered to take custody of Daughter.Â  At the\r\n  probable cause hearing, Father and Mother consented to Gerald and Fay E. obtaining\r\n  legal and physical custody of Daughter.Â  In January 2005, Son was born.Â  Son\r\n  lived with Mother for approximately five weeks following his birth; however,\r\n  Son was then placed with Lisa R., his grandmother, and James and Elsie S., Son's\r\n  great-grandparents.Â  \r\nAt the merits\r\n  hearing on November 23, 2005, Father and Mother agreed to an order finding: (1)\r\n  they medically neglected Daughter; (2) they failed to protect Daughter; and (3)\r\n  a possible threat of harm to Son existed.Â  Additionally, the family court found\r\n  Daughter was physically abused &quot;by a perpetrator whose identity has not\r\n  been determined.&quot;Â  The family court prohibited Father and Mother from\r\n  having any unsupervised visitation with Daughter or Son.Â  The family court\r\n  placed legal and physical custody of Daughter with Gerald and Fay E., and Son's\r\n  legal and physical custody was awarded jointly to Lisa R. and James and Elsie S.[1]Â \r\n  The family court found the agreement was in Children's best interests.Â  The\r\n  family court's order also permitted DSS to close its case &quot;since all\r\n  parties agree that there are no services which []DSS can offer [Father and\r\n  Mother].&quot;Â  \r\nOn\r\n  May 14, 2007, Father and Mother filed a complaint in the Greenwood County\r\n  family court alleging a substantial change in circumstances justified a change\r\n  in custody.Â  Gerald and Fay E. counterclaimed, requesting the family court\r\n  allow them to retain custody of Daughter.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court conducted a hearing September 15-18, 2008.Â  At the hearing, no one\r\n  was able to testify with certainty as to how Daughter was injured.Â  Dr. Skinner\r\n  and Dr. Cathcart both opined they believed Daughter was abused.Â  However, no\r\n  evidence was introduced to prove Mother or Father abused Daughter.Â  \r\nAccording\r\n  to Karen Neelands of Crossroads Pregnancy Center, Father and Mother attended\r\n  and completed various parenting classes from October 27, 2005 to April 25, 2006.Â \r\n  The classes Father and Mother completed involved discipline, creative\r\n  parenting, anger management, nutrition, and budgeting.Â  Additionally, Father\r\n  and Mother completed an eight-hour course in CPR and first aid.Â  \r\nJames\r\n  S., Son's great-grandfather, and Brenda G., Father's mother, acknowledged Father\r\n  and Mother were young and immature but have since matured.Â  Both testified Father\r\n  and Mother were now fit and should regain custody of Daughter and Son.Â  \r\nFather\r\n  and Mother testified at the hearing.Â  Father and Mother both admitted they\r\n  medically neglected Daughter in failing to have her x-rayed in 2004.Â  However, they\r\n  denied abusing Daughter or knowing who harmed Daughter.Â  Father and Mother\r\n  acknowledged they knew of Daughter's bruises.Â  Mother explained she looked for\r\n  a medical explanation as to what caused the bruises, while Father attributed\r\n  the bruising to the fact Daughter bruised easily and played with his sons.Â  Father also suggested Daughter's day care\r\n  provider may have abused Daughter.Â  According to Gerald and Fay E., there had\r\n  been no bruising on Daughter since she had been in their custody; however,\r\n  Daughter was injured while playing on a chair.Â  \r\nFather\r\n  and Mother admitted in 2004 they were not fit parents; however, both asserted\r\n  at the hearing they are now fit.Â  Since Daughter and Son's removal, both have\r\n  maintained stable employment and housing.Â  Additionally, Father and Mother have\r\n  lived in the same house, next door to Father's parents, since October 2005. Â If\r\n  returned to Father and Mother, Daughter and Son would have their own bedrooms.Â \r\n  Both Father and Mother believe it is in Children's best interests to be\r\n  reunited.Â  According to Mother, she relinquished custody of Daughter and Son\r\n  because she did not want her parental rights terminated.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  Cherry Mactaggart, Daughter's counselor, did not believe Daughter and Son\r\n  should be returned to Father and Mother.Â  Likewise, Fay E. believed it was in\r\n  Daughter's best interest to remain in her care.Â  Although Gerald and Fay E. did\r\n  not know if Father and Mother abused Daughter, they believed Daughter was in\r\n  danger of abuse if Father and Mother obtained custody.Â  Steve Strome, the\r\n  county director of Greenwood DSS, testified DSS did not want a change in\r\n  custody because Daughter suffered severe physical injuries while in Father and\r\n  Mother's custody, and these injuries had not reoccurred since Father and Mother\r\n  consented to relinquish custody.Â  \r\nThe guardian ad litem (GAL) also testified at the\r\n  hearing.Â  The GAL expressed concerns over any decision to return Children to Father\r\n  and Mother.Â  The GAL believed Father and Mother still need supervised\r\n  visitation, and Father and Mother were not aware of the severity of Daughter's\r\n  injuries.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  a hearing, the family court concluded Father and Mother &quot;have\r\n  substantially and positively changed their circumstances and lifestyles, in\r\n  their and their children's best interest . . . .&quot;Â  As a result, the family\r\n  court ordered physical and legal custody of Daughter and Son be returned to Father\r\n  and Mother.Â  Gerald and Fay E. filed a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  which the family court denied.Â  DSS filed a petition for supersedeas, which\r\n  this court denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, the court of appeals has jurisdiction\r\n  to find the facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Brown v.

App. 2004).Â  Although this court may find facts in accordance\r\n  with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we are not required to\r\n  ignore the fact that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses,\r\n  was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative\r\n  weight to their testimony.Â  Id.Â  In particular, an appellate court\r\n  should be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child\r\n  custody for that of the family court.Â  Id.Â  Our broad scope of review\r\n  does not relieve appellants of their burden to convince this court the family\r\n  court committed error.Â  Id.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\nI.Â  Did the family court err\r\n  in finding a substantial change of circumstances justified a change of custody?\r\nII.Â  Did the family court\r\n  incorrectly apply the doctrine of psychological parent and erroneously conclude\r\n  the bond between Daughter and Gerald and Fay E. did not overcome the\r\n  presumption in favor of a biological parent?\r\nIII.Â  Did the family court\r\n  abuse its discretion in denying Gerald and Fay E.'s and DSS's motion to present\r\n  hearsay testimony pursuant to section 19-1-180 of the South Carolina Code?\r\nIV.Â  Did the family court\r\n  abuse its discretion in awarding GAL fees and GAL's attorney's fees?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Custody of Minor\r\n  Children\r\nDSS\r\n  and Gerald and Fay E. argue the family court erred in finding a substantial\r\n  change of circumstances justified a change in custody.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe\r\n  best interest of the child is the primary and controlling consideration in all\r\n  child custody controversies.Â  Moore\r\n    v. Moore, 300 S.C. 75, 79, 386 S.E.2d 456, 458&nbsp;(1989).Â  Nevertheless,\r\n  there is a rebuttable presumption that it is in the best interest of any child\r\n  to be in the custody of his or her biological parent.Â  Id.Â  In Kay v.\r\n    Rowland, 285 S.C. 516, 517, 331 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1985), the supreme\r\n  court placed a substantial burden on any third party attempting to take custody\r\n  over a biological parent and &quot;recognized the superior rights of a natural\r\n  parent in a custody dispute with a third party. Once the natural parent is\r\n  deemed fit, the issue of custody is decided.&quot; \r\n&quot;Since the paramount\r\n  consideration of the court[] is the welfare of the child, the dilemma is how to\r\n  assure that parents who temporarily relinquish custody for the child's best\r\n  interest can regain custody when conditions become more favorable.&quot;Â  Moore,\r\n  300 S.C. at 79, 386 S.E.2d at 458.Â  This court should consider\r\n  the following in custody determinations when natural parents seek to reclaim\r\n  custody of their child: (1) whether the parents have proved they are fit parents, able to properly care for the child and\r\n  provide a good home; (2) the amount of\r\n    contact, in the form of visits, financial support or both, which the parents\r\n    had with the child while the child was in the care of a third party; (3) the\r\n    circumstances under which temporary relinquishment occurred; and (4) the degree\r\n    of attachment between the child and the temporary custodian.Â  Id. at\r\n    79-80, 386 S.E.2d at 458-59.Â \r\nThe\r\n  order in the case presently before us indicates the family court considered\r\n  each of the foregoing factors in reaching the decision to award custody to Father\r\n  and Mother.Â  Our own application of the Moore factors reveals the family\r\n  court did not err in finding Father and Mother are now fit parents able to\r\n  provide a good home for Children.Â  Evidence in the record indicates since Father\r\n  and Mother relinquished custody of Children, Father and Mother have married; maintained\r\n  stable employment; obtained adequate housing; and, upon their own initiative,\r\n  completed numerous parenting classes.Â  Further, at the time of the hearing, no\r\n  one was able to offer any evidence Father and Mother abused Children. \r\nConsidering the\r\n  second Moore factor, Father and Mother consistently visited Daughter and\r\n  Son on weekends since Children's removal.Â  According to Mother, she sees\r\n  Daughter three weekends a month, presumably indicating she sees Son the same.Â \r\n  However, Mother admits she did not visit Daughter during the week.Â  Mother pays\r\n  Gerald and Fay E. approximately $90 every two weeks in child support.Â  Fay E.\r\n  testified she did not expect any financial support from Father and Mother.Â \r\n  Rather, she assumed custody out of love for Daughter.Â  Father and Mother also purchased\r\n  Daughter clothes, but Daughter leaves them at Mother and Father's home so she\r\n  does not have to pack for visits.Â  Moreover, Father and Mother now have had\r\n  custody of Daughter and Son for almost one year.\r\nRegarding\r\n  the third factor, the relinquishment occurred due to Father and Mother's\r\n  medical neglect of Daughter.Â  Father and Mother have continually denied abusing\r\n  Daughter, and for almost four years, no one has offered any evidence to the\r\n  contrary.Â  Moreover, Mother, Father, Gerald E., and Fay E. consented to the\r\n  child-care arrangement. When Daughter was placed in Gerald and Fay E.'s home, Father\r\n  and Mother believed they could resume custody once they became fit parents.Â  According\r\n  to Mother, she relinquished custody because she did not want her parental\r\n  rights terminated.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  we observe the evidence presented regarding the degree of attachment between Children\r\n  and their respective custodians.Â  Evidence indicates a strong emotional bond\r\n  between Children and their custodians.Â  We commend Gerald and Fay E. for coming\r\n  forward and volunteering to assume custody of Daughter during a very difficult\r\n  situation.Â  By all accounts, Daughter did well while in their care.Â  However, Father\r\n  and Mother continued to visit Children after they relinquished custody, which indicates\r\n  Children have continued to maintain a strong bond with Father and Mother as\r\n  well.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court did not err in finding a\r\n  substantial change of circumstances justified a change in custody.\r\nII.Â  Psychological Parent Doctrine\r\nDSS\r\n  and Gerald and Fay E. contend the family court incorrectly applied the\r\n  psychological parent doctrine.Â  According to DSS and Gerald and Fay E., the\r\n  family court erred in concluding Gerald and Fay E. failed to rebut the\r\n  presumption that it was in Daughter's best interest to be placed with her\r\n  natural parents. According to DSS and Fay and Gerald E., no burden exists.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThere\r\n  is a rebuttable presumption that it is in the best interest of any child to be\r\n  in the custody of biological parents.Â  Moore, 300 S.C. at 79, 386 S.E.2d\r\n  at 458; Dodge v. Dodge, 332 S.C. 401, 410, 505 S.E.2d 344, 349 (Ct. App.\r\n  1998) (quoting Moore); see also Middleton v. Johnson, 369\r\n  S.C. 585, 604, 633 S.E.2d 162, 172 (Ct. App. 2006) (&quot;The limited right of\r\n  the psychological parent cannot usually overcome the legal parent's right to\r\n  control the upbringing of his or her child.&quot;).Â  In Moore, the\r\n  Supreme Court explained, &quot;[i]f a party relinquishes custody in good faith\r\n  because of some temporary inability to provide for the child, such parent\r\n  should be able to regain custody upon a showing that the condition which\r\n  required relinquishment has been resolved. Child custody should not be subject\r\n  to change because of adverse possession.&quot;Â  Id. at 81, 386 S.E.2d at\r\n  459.Â Â  \r\nThe parties do not dispute\r\n  the family court's finding that a psychological parent-child relationship\r\n  exists between Gerald and Fay E. and Daughter.Â  Rather, DSS and Gerald and Fay E.\r\n  contend the family court erred in finding they have the burden to prove it is in\r\n  Daughter's best interest to remain in their custody.Â  We believe, in accordance\r\n  with Moore, the family court correctly concluded Gerald and Fay E. carry\r\n  the burden to rebut the presumption it is in Daughter's best interest to be\r\n  placed with Father and Mother once the family court found them to be fit\r\n  parents.Â  See Middleton, 369 S.C. at 604, 633 S.E.2d at 172 (finding\r\n  the psychological parent must present compelling circumstances to rebut the\r\n  presumption that a fit, legal parent has the right to control the upbringing of\r\n  his or her child).Â  \r\nIII.Â  Hearsay Testimony\r\nDSS\r\n  and Gerald and Fay E. argue the family court erred in not admitting Daughter's\r\n  hearsay testimony under section 19-1-180(B)(2) of the South Carolina Code.Â \r\n  They assert Daughter was unavailable to testify because she was unable to\r\n  communicate the details of her physical abuse due to fear and emotional\r\n  trauma.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court, and the court's decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Lisa C., 380 S.C. 406,\r\n  411, 669 S.E.2d 647, 650&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008).Â  &quot;In order for this court\r\n  to reverse a case based on the erroneous admission or erroneous exclusion of\r\n  evidence the plaintiff must show error and prejudice.&quot;Â  Osterneck\r\n    v. Osterneck, 374 S.C. 573, 579, 649 S.E.2d 127, 131&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007).\r\nAn\r\n  out-of-court statement made by a child under twelve years of age concerning an\r\n  act of alleged abuse or neglect as defined by section 63-7-20 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2008) may be admissible in a family court proceeding.Â  In order\r\n  to be admissible, the family court must find the child is unavailable to\r\n  testify on any one of the following grounds: (1) the\r\n  child's death; (2) the\r\n  child's physical or mental disability; (3) the\r\n  existence of a privilege involving the child; (4) the\r\n  child's incompetency, including the child's inability to communicate about the\r\n  offense because of fear; or (5) the\r\n  substantial likelihood the child would suffer severe emotional trauma from\r\n  testifying at the proceeding or by means of videotaped deposition or\r\n  closed-circuit television.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-1-180(B)(2)(a) (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  Additionally, there must be a showing the statement possesses &quot;particularized\r\n  guarantees of trustworthiness.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-1-180(B)(2)(b) (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court found Daughter was available to testify by either videotape or\r\n  closed-circuit television.Â  Cherry Mactaggart, Daughter's licensed counselor,\r\n  testified that based on play therapy with Daughter, Daughter should not\r\n  testify.Â  Mactaggart explained Daughter has been diagnosed with post-traumatic\r\n  stress disorder.Â  Initially, Daughter had difficulty with eating, sleeping,\r\n  attachment, expressions, approaching adults, and shyness; however, she opined Daughter\r\n  had made substantial progress.Â  During therapy sessions, Mactaggart did not\r\n  attempt to elicit how Daughter might respond to a court setting.Â  Mactaggart acknowledged\r\n  Daughter was mentally capable of testifying and knew the difference between the\r\n  truth and a lie.Â  The family court denied DSS's motion to admit Daughter's\r\n  hearsay testimony, finding Daughter could testify by videotape or closed-circuit\r\n  television.Â  Â \r\nAt the time of the\r\n  hearing, Daughter was six years of age, and almost four years had passed since\r\n  her removal.Â  Evidence indicated Daughter was mentally competent and knew the\r\n  difference between right and wrong.Â  Accordingly, we do not believe the family\r\n  court erred in finding Daughter could testify by videotape or closed-circuit\r\n  television.[2]\r\nIV.Â  GAL Fees and GAL's Attorney's\r\n  Fees\r\nGerald\r\n  and Fay E. maintain the family court's order contains no findings of fact to\r\n  support the award of GAL fees and GAL's attorney's fees.Â  We agree.Â  Â \r\nAppointment\r\n  of a GAL in a private action is controlled by the South Carolina Private\r\n  Guardian Ad Litem Reform Act (the Act), which became effective January 15,\r\n  2003, and states:\r\n\r\n  (A) In a private action before the family court in\r\n    which custody or visitation of a minor child is an issue, the court may appoint\r\n    a guardian ad litem only when it determines that:\r\n  (1)\r\n    without a guardian ad litem, the court will likely not be fully informed about\r\n    the facts of the case and there is a substantial dispute which necessitates a\r\n    guardian ad litem; or\r\n  (2)\r\n    both parties consent to the appointment of a guardian ad litem who is approved\r\n    by the court.\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-810 (2008).\r\n  Furthermore, the Act authorizes the family court to appoint an attorney to\r\n  represent a non-attorney GAL. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-820(E) (2008).\r\n  When the family court determines the appointment of an attorney to represent\r\n  the GAL is necessary, it must &quot;set forth the reasons for the appointment\r\n  and must establish a method for compensating the attorney.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  63-3-850(A) of the South Carolina Code (2008) provides: \r\n\r\n  At the\r\n    time of appointment of a [GAL], the family court judge must set forth the\r\n    method and rate of compensation for the [GAL], including an initial\r\n    authorization of a fee based on the facts of the case. If the [GAL] determines\r\n    that it is necessary to exceed the fee initially authorized by the judge, the\r\n    guardian must provide notice to both parties and obtain the judge's written\r\n    authorization or the consent of both parties to charge more than the initially\r\n    authorized fee.\r\n\r\nThe statute also provides the\r\n  GAL is entitled to &quot;reasonable compensation, subject to the review and\r\n  approval of the court.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-850(B) (2008).Â  In\r\n  determining the reasonableness of the fees and costs, &quot;the court must take\r\n  into account&quot; the following factors:\r\n\r\n  (1) the complexity of the issues before the court; (2)\r\n    the contentiousness of the litigation; (3)\r\n    the time expended by the guardian; (4)\r\n    the expenses reasonably incurred by the guardian; (5)\r\n    the financial ability of each party to pay fees and costs; and (6)\r\n    any other factors the court considers necessary. \r\n\r\nId.Â  In Loe v. Mother, Father, &amp; Berkeley County\r\n  Dep't of Soc. Servs., 382 S.C. 457, 473-474, 675 S.E.2d 807, 816&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2009), this court found the reasonableness of a GAL's attorney's fees\r\n  should also be determined in light of these statutory factors.Â  \r\nA\r\n  review of the family court's order does not reveal the court considered the\r\n  statutory factors in awarding GAL and GAL attorney's fees.Â  We\r\n    do not address whether the GAL and GAL attorney's fees were properly approved\r\n    pursuant to section 63-3-850 or whether the fees are reasonable. Instead, we reverse the award of fees and remand for a determination of whether the statutory requirements were met in\r\n  authorizing fees for the GAL and the GAL's attorney and a determination of\r\n  reasonableness pursuant to the factors specified in section 63-3-850(B).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the family court did\r\n  not err in finding a substantial change of circumstances justified a return of\r\n  custody to Father and Mother.Â  We affirm the family court's finding that Daughter\r\n  was available to testify by videotape or closed-circuit television.Â  However,\r\n  we reverse the award of GAL and GAL attorney's fees and remand this issue to\r\n  the family court. \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AS MODIFIED, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The family court's order\r\n  also outlined a visitation schedule for all parties. \r\n[2] DSS and Gerald and Fay E. also contend the family\r\n  court erred in not admitting the testimony pursuant to Rule 803(4) of the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Evidence.Â  Pursuant to Rule 803(4), SCRE, &quot;[s]tatements\r\n  made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical\r\n  history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or\r\n  general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably\r\n  pertinent to diagnosis or treatment&quot; are admissible.Â  We find Rule 803(4),\r\n  SCRE, does not apply in the present case.Â  Even if Rule 803(4) is applicable,\r\n  the exclusion of the hearsay testimony was not prejudicial because the family\r\n  court gave DSS an opportunity to interview Daughter and put forth Daughter's\r\n  testimony, which DSS failed to do.Â  Because of this failure, DSS cannot show\r\n  both error and prejudice.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2009-UP-622","title":"Clyde Ackerman v.
