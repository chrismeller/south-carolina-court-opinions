Jones, of Greer, for\r\n          Appellants.\r\n        Gary H. Johnson, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Â Â Todd M.\r\n  Suite and Amy Suzanne Wells appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order finding they\r\n  waived their objection that Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.\r\n  (â€œMERSâ€) is not a real party in interest and granting summary judgment in favor\r\n  of MERS on all of their counterclaims. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 25, 2001 Suite and Wells executed\r\n  a note promising to pay the principal sum of $181,600.00 to CTX Mortgage\r\n  Company (â€œCTXâ€) at an annual interest rate of 7.25%.Â  The same day, a mortgage\r\n  was granted naming MERS as nominee for CTX.Â  The mortgage was recorded with the\r\n  Calhoun County Clerk of Court on May 4, 2001.Â  Although Suite affirms his\r\n  execution of the mortgage document, there is a factual dispute as to whether Wellsâ€™\r\n  signature is authentic. \r\nBeginning in December 2002, Suite and\r\n  Wells stopped making payments on the mortgage. Â In May 2003, MERS filed a\r\n  summons and complaint seeking foreclosure on the related property.\r\nIn a pre-answer motion and in their\r\n  answer, Suite and Wells alleged MERS was not a real party in interest in the\r\n  case.Â  Suite and Wells also filed a counterclaim to MERS foreclosure action.Â \r\n  They alleged: (1) forgery relating to Wellsâ€™ signature on the mortgage\r\n  document; (2) breach of contract; (3) breach of contract accompanied by a\r\n  fraudulent act; (4) violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act; and (5)\r\n  violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).Â  MERS entered\r\n  its reply to the counterclaims and the actions were joined.Â  \r\nOn May 19, 2005, MERS filed and served a\r\n  motion for summary judgment, arguing the record was devoid of any evidence to\r\n  support Suite and Wellsâ€™ causes of action.Â  After holding two separate hearings\r\n  on the matter, the circuit court granted MERS summary judgment on all of Suite\r\n  and Wellâ€™s counterclaims and referred the foreclosure action to the\r\n  master-in-equity.Â  Noting the action had been pending for nearly two and half\r\n  years, with multiple depositions taken and numerous discovery documents\r\n  exchanged, the circuit judge found the issue relating to MERSâ€™ standing had\r\n  never been properly brought before the court and had therefore been waived.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA.Â  Real Party in Interest \r\nSuite and Wells claim that MERS is not a\r\n  real party in interest and that they did not waive their objection to this\r\n  issue.Â  We disagree. \r\nPutting the waiver issue aside, it is obvious\r\n  that MERS has standing in the case sub judice.Â  Quite simply, MERS is\r\n  listed in the mortgage as the nominee of the mortgage holder.Â  Furthermore, Suite\r\n  and Wells have asserted and prosecuted claims against the company and\r\n  represented to the court that the claims were compulsory.Â  Even if we were to\r\n  find the circuit court incorrectly decided Suite and Wells waived the matter,\r\n  there has been no reversible error, as MERS is clearly an interested party.\r\nB. Â Summary Judgment as to Suite and\r\n  Wellsâ€™ Counterclaims\r\nSuite and Wells claim the circuit court\r\n  erred in granting summary judgment for MERS in regard to their numerous\r\n  counterclaims.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of summary\r\n  judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial\r\n  court under Rule 56, SCRCP: â€œsummary judgment is proper when there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.â€ Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363\r\n  S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™\r\n    Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 603 S.E.2d 629 (Ct. App. 2004). In determining whether\r\n  any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences that can\r\n  reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\n  nonmoving party. Â Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C.\r\n  615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004). Â If triable issues exist, those issues must go to\r\n  the jury. Â Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 608 S.E.2d 587 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).\r\nThe party seeking summary judgment has\r\n  the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material\r\n  fact. Â McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 597\r\n  S.E.2d 181 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Once the party moving for summary judgment meets\r\n  the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s\r\n  case, the opponent to the motion can not simply rest on mere allegations or\r\n  denials contained in the pleadings, but must come forward with specific facts\r\n  showing there is a genuine issue for trial.Â  SSI Med. Servs., Inc. v. Cox,\r\n  301 S.C. 493, 392 S.E.2d 789 (1990).Â  \r\n1.Â  Forgery \r\nSuite and Wells raised the issue of the\r\n  alleged forgery as a compulsory counterclaim seeking affirmative relief, not simply\r\n  as a defense to the foreclosure action.Â  The circuit court ruled there was no\r\n  such cause of action recognized in South Carolina, and that even in the event such\r\n  an action was recognized, the counterclaim would not survive summary judgment,\r\n  as there was no evidence as to who forged the signature or regarding damages.Â  \r\nThe circuit court was correct that there\r\n  is no such cause of action in this state. Â Additionally, Suite and Wells\r\n  offered no evidence as to the source of the alleged forgery, but simply alleged\r\n  that MERS was the culprit.Â  Thus, the circuit judge properly granted MERSâ€™\r\n  motion for summary judgment as to Suite and Wellsâ€™ counterclaim for the alleged\r\n  forgery.\r\n2.Â  Breach of Contract \r\nIncluded in Suite and Wellsâ€™ counterclaims\r\n  was a cause of action for breach of contract, more specifically, they allege MERS\r\n  breached their contract through improper escrow payments.\r\nSuite and Wells admitted they made no\r\n  payments on the note after December 2002.Â  The lower court ruled the evidence\r\n  established they were in arrears on the loan prior to the occurrence of any allegedly\r\n  improper escrow payments.Â  The court found that under the note, timely payments\r\n  were a condition precedent to any obligation regarding escrow payments.Â  A\r\n  condition precedent, â€œunless excused, must exist or occur before a duty of\r\n  immediate performance arises.â€Â  Worley v. Yarborough Ford, Inc., 317\r\n  S.C. 206, 210, 452 S.E.2d 622, 624 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  As there was no evidence that\r\n  any escrow issues occurred before Suite and Wells went into arrears on the\r\n  note, summary judgment on the breach of contract counterclaim was proper.\r\n3. Breach of Contract Accompanied by a\r\n  Fraudulent Act\r\nIn order to state a claim for breach of\r\n  contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, a plaintiff must plead facts\r\n  establishing three elements: (1) a breach of contract; (2) fraudulent intent\r\n  relating to the breaching of the contract and not merely to its making; and (3)\r\n  a fraudulent act accompanying the breach.Â  Harper v. Ethridge, 290 S.C.\r\n  112, 348 S.E.2d 374 (1986).\r\nSuite and Wells failed to put forth\r\n  evidence to support a cause of action for breach of contract against MERS. Â Moreover,\r\n  the record is devoid of any evidence that MERS acted with any fraudulent intent\r\n  relating to any alleged breach.Â  When asked whether he believed MERS committed\r\n  fraud on him, Suite responded, â€œI donâ€™tâ€”I wouldnâ€™t say fraud per se.Â  I think\r\n  that, like I said earlier, there was a lot of confusion . . . .â€Â  Clearly, the\r\n  circuit court properly granted summary judgment as to the counterclaim for breach\r\n  of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.\r\n4.Â  Unfair Trade Practices ActÂ  \r\nThe South Carolina Unfair Trade\r\n  Practices Act provides: â€œUnfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive\r\n  acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared\r\n  unlawful.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20(a) (1985).Â  â€œAny person who suffers any\r\n  ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the\r\n  use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or\r\n  practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 may bring an action individually . . .\r\n  to recover actual damages.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140 (1985).Â  An unfair trade\r\n  practice has been defined as a practice that is â€œoffensive to public policy or\r\n  which is immoral, unethical, or oppressive.â€ Â Wogan v. Kunze, 366 S.C.\r\n  583, 606, 623 S.E.2d 107, 120 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing deBondt v. Carlton\r\n    Motorcars, Inc., 342 S.C. 254, 269, 536 S.E.2d 399, 407 (Ct. App. 2000)).\r\nTo be actionable under the act, the\r\n  unfair or deceptive act or practice must have an impact upon the public\r\n  interest and have the potential for repetition.Â  Haley Nursery Co. v.\r\n    Forrest, 298 S.C. 520, 381 S.E.2d 906 (1989); Burbach v. Investors\r\n      Management Corp. Intern., 326 S.C. 492, 484 S.E.2d 119 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  â€œThe\r\n  potential for repetition may be shown in two ways: 1) by showing the same kind\r\n  of actions occurred in the past, thus making it likely they will continue to\r\n  occur absent deterrence, or 2) by showing the companyâ€™s procedures create a\r\n  potential for repetition of the unfair and deceptive acts.â€Â  Crary v.\r\n    Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 388, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998) (citing Daisy\r\n      Outdoor Advertising v. Abbott, 322 S.C. 489, 473 S.E.2d 47 (1996)).\r\nSuite and Wells contend the mortgage\r\n  amount was increased on two separate occasions and thus constitutes a violation\r\n  of the UTPA.Â  Even if we were to assume the mortgage was increased as they\r\n  allege and in manner offensive to public policy, immoral, unethical, or\r\n  oppressive, Suite and Wells failed to produce any evidence that MERS engaged in\r\n  similar acts in past or that the companyâ€™s procedures created a potential for repetition.Â \r\n  Thus, summary judgment in regard to the Unfair Trade Practices Act counterclaim\r\n  was proper.[2]Â \r\n  Suite and Wellsâ€™ unauthorized practice of law allegation, which is incorporated\r\n  into their UTPA argument, was never presented before the circuit court and is\r\n  not preserved for review.\r\n5.Â  RESPA Â \r\nIn their counterclaims, Suite and Wells\r\n  alleged MERS failed to meet RESPAâ€™s requirements as to timely notice of changes\r\n  in the holder of their mortgage.Â  However, it is undisputed the note at issue\r\n  was originally held by CTX and is now held by Bank of America, and Suite admits\r\n  he received notice of the noteâ€™s change of ownership from CTX to Bank of\r\n  America on June 25, 2001, a timeframe within RESPAâ€™s guidelines.Â  Thus, there was\r\n  no evidence to create a triable issue of fact regarding Suite and Wellsâ€™ claim\r\n  that MERS violated RESPA, and the circuit court did not erred in its grant of\r\n  summary judgment on the matter.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The exact act\r\n  or acts Suite and Wells contend were violations of the UTPA is not entirely clear.Â \r\n  Before the circuit court, their argument centered around RESPA and the alleged\r\n  forgery.Â  However, the appeal brief seems to focus only on the alleged increase\r\n  in the mortgage amount and unauthorized practice of law.Â  Regardless, Suite and\r\n  Wells have failed to show any evidence as to the likelihood for repetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-273","title":"State v.

McFaddin, Jr., Family Court\r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-276\r\n  Submitted April 2, 2007 â€“ Filed June 6,\r\n  2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        James H. Babb, of Sumter, for Appellant.\r\n        Warren Stephen Curtis, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Henry\r\n  Green (Father) appeals the family courtâ€™s determination that it lacked\r\n  jurisdiction to modify a South Carolina custody order.Â  Father further appeals\r\n  the family courtâ€™s decision that even if it had jurisdiction, it would decline\r\n  to exercise it.Â  We affirm as modified. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 15, 1998, Tracy Morris\r\n  (Mother) and Father had a son, Mark Austin Green, as a result of their\r\n  nonmarital union.Â  In 1999, the parties separated.Â  On August 7, 2000, the Sumter County family court issued the original custody, support, and visitation order.Â  The\r\n  parties received joint custody with Mother as the primary custodial parent.Â  In 2002, the child moved with Mother to Georgia.Â  Mother and Father\r\n  appeared before the family court several times on matters regarding the child.Â  In 2004, Mother married an active member of the United States Marine Corps who\r\n  was stationed in Arizona, and the family court entered a consent order\r\n  allowing Mother to take the child with her to Arizona.\r\nOn June 5, 2005, the child arrived in South Carolina for his summer visitation with Father.Â  The child was scheduled to\r\n  return to Arizona on August 6, 2005.Â  Upon arriving in South Carolina\r\n  for summer visitation with Father, the child began relaying incidents of\r\n  violence including corporal punishment perpetrated by Motherâ€™s husband.Â  Based\r\n  on those allegations, on July 29, 2005, Father filed an action in the family\r\n  court seeking modification of the custody order.Â  On August 3, 2005,\r\n  Mother called to speak to the child, and Father informed her he would not be\r\n  returning the child on August 6 as scheduled.Â  On August 11, 2005, Mother\r\n  filed a response to Fatherâ€™s complaint asserting in part that the South Carolina family court lacked jurisdiction over the matter. Â \r\nOn March 16, 2006, the family court issued\r\n  an order dismissing Fatherâ€™s action finding it did not have jurisdiction\r\n  because Arizona was now the childâ€™s home state, and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C. Â§\r\n  1738A (2000), mandates that a\r\n  court can decide child custody matters only if it is the childâ€™s home state or\r\n  has been the childâ€™s home state in the last six months.Â  Further, the\r\n  family court determined even if it did have jurisdiction, it would decline to\r\n  exercise it because South Carolina is an inconvenient forum to make a custody\r\n  decision in the case.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from a family court order, this Court has authority to correct errors of\r\n  law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 473, 415 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1992).Â  However, this broad scope of review does\r\n  not require this Court to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings. Â Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d\r\n  620, 623 (2003). Â â€œThe family court in its discretion may enter\r\n  an order declining to exercise jurisdiction based on a finding that it is an inconvenient\r\n  forum, which this Court will uphold absent an abuse of that discretion.â€ Â Charest\r\n    v. Charest, 329 S.C. 511, 516,\r\n  495 S.E.2d 784, 786 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFather argues the\r\n  family court erred in finding it lacked jurisdiction to modify the custody\r\n  order.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  PKPA and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), sections 20-7-782 to -830 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (1976), â€œgovern the subject matter jurisdiction of state courts to rule\r\n  in interstate custody disputes. Â Because the PKPA is federal legislation, its\r\n  provisions will govern any conflict between it and the UCCJA . . . .â€Â  Widdicombe v. Tucker-Cales, 366 S.C. 75, 86, 620 S.E.2d 333, 339 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005) (petition for cert. filed) (citations omitted).Â  One of\r\n  the UCCJAâ€™s purposes is to avoid conflicting custody decrees between states.Â  Id. at 87, 620 S.E.2d at 339; see\r\n    also S.C. Code Ann.\r\n    Â§ 20-7-784 (1976) (Other purposes of the UCCJA include avoiding\r\n  relitigation of custody decisions of other states if feasible and facilitating\r\n  the enforcement of custody decrees of other states.).\r\nThe\r\n  family court found it did not have jurisdiction because the PKPA provides that a child\r\n  custody or visitation determination is consistent with the PKPA only if the court has jurisdiction under the law of the state\r\n  and one of the provided conditions is met.Â  The condition the family court\r\n  relied on was:\r\n\r\n  such State (i) is the home State of the child on the\r\n    date of the commencement of the proceeding, or (ii) had been the childâ€™s home\r\n    State within six months before the date of the commencement of the proceeding\r\n    and the child is absent from such State because of his removal or retention by\r\n    a contestant or for other reasons, and a contestant continues to live in such\r\n    State . . . .\r\n\r\n28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(c)(2)(A)\r\n  (1988).Â  However, the family court interpreted the statute as providing\r\n  that only the home state has jurisdiction.Â  This is contrary to a reading of\r\n  the plain language of the statute, which provides that a state being the\r\n  childâ€™s home state is only one of the reasons a court can exercise\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Another reason a state may maintain jurisdiction under the PKPA is if â€œthe\r\n  court has continuing jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.â€ 28\r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(c)(2)(E) (1988). Â Subsection (d) provides,\r\n\r\n  The jurisdiction of\r\n    a court of a State which has made a child custody or visitation determination\r\n    consistently with the provisions of this section continues as long as the\r\n    requirement of subsection (c)(1) of this section continues to be met and such\r\n    State remains the residence of the child or of any contestant.\r\n\r\n28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(d) (1988).Â  Accordingly, if South Carolina issues the original custody decree in\r\n  accordance with the PKPA and one parent still resides in South Carolina, then South Carolina has jurisdiction if it retains it under the UCCJA. Â \r\nThe PKPA mandates three criteria for a court to retain continuing\r\n  jurisdiction: (1) that the\r\n  original custody determination was entered consistently with the provisions of\r\n  the PKPA; (2) that the court maintain jurisdiction under its own state law, in South Carolina, the UCCJA; and (3) that the state remains the residence of the child or of\r\n  any contestant.Â  Widdicombe, 366 S.C. at 86, 620 S.E.2d at 339.Â  At the time of the original custody decree, Mother, Father, and\r\n  the child were all residents of South Carolina, where the court issued the original\r\n  decree.Â  Accordingly, South Carolina meets the first requirement for retaining\r\n  jurisdiction because the original decree was entered consistently with the\r\n  provisions of the PKPA.\r\nThe\r\n  second requirement under the PKPA is that South Carolina retain jurisdiction\r\n  under its laws.Â  We give great deference to the jurisdiction of the state that\r\n  originally ruled on a\r\n  custody matter.Â  Widdicombe, 366 S.C. at 87, 620 S.E.2d at\r\n  339-40.Â \r\n  â€œCourts which render a custody decree normally retain continuing jurisdiction to modify the decree under local law.â€Â  Knoth v. Knoth,\r\n  297 S.C. 460, 463, 377 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1989).Â  \r\n\r\n  Although\r\n    more than one state may meet the jurisdictional requirements under the UCCJA,\r\n    once a custody decree has been entered, the continuing jurisdiction of the\r\n    decree state is exclusive.Â  This jurisdiction continues if one parent continues\r\n    to reside in the decree state and substantial evidence remains there, even\r\n    though another state has become the childâ€™s home state.Â  \r\n\r\nCharest\r\n  v. Charest, 329 S.C. 511, 518, 495 S.E.2d 784, 788 (Ct. App. 1997)\r\n  (citations omitted).Â  This jurisdiction is\r\n  not necessarily affected by a childâ€™s residence in another state.Â  Knoth,\r\n  297 S.C. at 464, 377 S.E.2d at 342-43.Â  If the prior state still has sufficient\r\n  contact with the case to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements, all petitions\r\n  for modification must be addressed to that state.Â  Id. at 463, 377\r\n  S.E.2d at 342.Â  The courtâ€™s previous consideration of the case is one factor in\r\n  favor of its continued jurisdiction.Â  Id.Â  When a state attempts to\r\n  exercise continuing jurisdiction over a custody decree on which it has\r\n  previously ruled, we broadly interpret the jurisdictional requirements in the\r\n  UCCJA.Â  Widdicombe, 366 S.C. at 87, 620 S.E.2d at\r\n  340. \r\nIn Knoth, an Illinois family court modified custody in a matter a South Carolina family court had previously decided on numerous occasions.Â  297 S.C. at 461, 377 S.E.2d at 341.Â  The South Carolina\r\n  Supreme Court found because the mother remained in South Carolina and the child\r\n  still had considerable contacts with the state, South Carolina continued to\r\n  have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, and the Illinois family court\r\n  improperly assumed jurisdiction.Â  Id. at 464, 377 S.E.2d at 342.Â  \r\nIn Charest, a case analogous to the\r\n  instant case, this Court found â€œ[a]s the decree state, South\r\n  Carolina clearly had continuing jurisdiction . . . based on the fact that at\r\n  least one parent, the father, continued to reside here and the children visited\r\n  him and remained in contact with him in South Carolina.â€Â  329 S.C. at 518-19, 495\r\n  S.E.2d at 788.Â  In the present case, because\r\n  Father still resided in South Carolina and the child visited Father in South Carolina, South Carolina meets the second requirement of the PKPA because it continued\r\n  to have jurisdiction under this stateâ€™s laws.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  third prong of the PKPA analysis provides that one party must continue to\r\n  reside in the state.Â  Because Father continued to reside in South Carolina, the\r\n  third criterion of the PKPA is satisfied. Accordingly, South Carolina meets all three requirements mandated by the PKPA for it to have continuing\r\n  jurisdiction over the matter, and the family court erred in finding it lacked\r\n  jurisdiction.\r\nFather\r\n  contends the family court erred in declining to exercise jurisdiction.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe family court may decline to exercise jurisdiction\r\n  if South Carolina is an inconvenient forum to make a custody determination\r\n  under the circumstances of the case and a court of another state is a more\r\n  appropriate forum.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-796(a) (1976).Â  When determining if South Carolina is an inconvenient forum, the family court should consider if another stateâ€™s\r\n  assumption of jurisdiction is in the childâ€™s interest.Â  Â§ 20-7-796(c).Â  The family court should take\r\n  into account the following factors in making its decision:\r\n\r\n  (1) if\r\n    another state is or recently was the childâ€™s home state;\r\n  (2) if another state has a closer connection with the\r\n    child and his family or with the child and one or more of the contestants;\r\n  (3) if substantial evidence concerning the childâ€™s\r\n    present or future care, protection, training and personal relationships are\r\n    more readily available in another state;\r\n  (4) if the parties have agreed on another forum which\r\n    is no less appropriate;\r\n  (5) if the exercise of jurisdiction by a court of this\r\n    State would contravene any of the purposes stated in Â§ 20-7-784.\r\n\r\nId.Â  The family court may also\r\n  consider other factors it deems relevant.Â  Id.\r\nIn McGee v. McGee, 287\r\n  S.C. 644, 647, 340 S.E.2d 571, 573 (Ct. App. 1986), we found the family court\r\n  did not abuse its discretion in determining Georgia, rather than South\r\n  Carolina, was the more appropriate forum for a custody action. Â Although the\r\n  parents were divorced in South Carolina and the\r\n  father continued to live here, the mother and the coupleâ€™s child had lived in Georgia for five years. Â Id. at 646, 340 S.E.2d at 573.Â  The child had attended\r\n  school in Georgia for three years, all of his recent medical records were in Georgia, and all of his extracurricular activities were centered in Georgia. Â Id. at 647, 340\r\n  S.E.2d at 573.Â  Therefore, those people most familiar with the childâ€™s current\r\n  condition, such as teachers, friends, and neighbors, were in Georgia.Â  Id.\r\nSimilarly, in Charest, we found the family\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise its jurisdiction in\r\n  order for a change of custody action to be instituted in New York. Â 329 S.C. at 520, 495\r\n  S.E.2d at 789.Â  Although the father still resided in South Carolina, the children had\r\n  resided in New York with their mother for five years before the action was\r\n  instituted.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  New York had the most significant connection to the children, and the witnesses\r\n  who could testify about the childrenâ€™s daily activities and current condition\r\n  were located there. Â Id.Â  The children were enrolled in school, attended\r\n  church, and spent most of their time in New York.Â  Id.Â  Further, any\r\n  evidence of the childrenâ€™s alleged mistreatment would necessarily come from New York.Â  Id.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In the present\r\n  case, the child had lived in Arizona for over a year before Father filed this\r\n  action.Â  Father alleges abuse at the hands of Motherâ€™s husband who lived in Arizona with the child.Â  Accordingly, any witnesses to testify about the interaction\r\n  between the child and Motherâ€™s husband would be in Arizona.Â  Because the child\r\n  has resided in Arizona for over a year, it is his home state, it has more\r\n  substantial evidence concerning the childâ€™s care, and it has a closer\r\n  connection to the child than South Carolina as the child has not lived here since\r\n  2002.Â  Therefore, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  declining to exercise jurisdiction over the matter.[1]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  because South Carolina meets the three criteria for retaining jurisdiction under\r\n  the PKPA, the family court erred in finding it did not have jurisdiction to\r\n  modify the custody decree.Â  However, the family court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in finding that even if it had jurisdiction, it would decline to\r\n  exercise it because South Carolina was an inconvenient forum.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  family courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED AS\r\n  MODIFIED.[2]\r\nHUFF, BEATTY,\r\n  and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] Additionally, Father maintains the family court\r\n  deprived him of his procedural and substantive due process rights by executing\r\n  an order granting the â€œde facto permanent reliefâ€ of a dismissal for lack of\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court has established a firm policy of declining to rule on constitutional issues\r\n  unless such a ruling is required. Â Fairway\r\n    Ford, Inc. v. County of Greenville, 324 S.C. 84, 86, 476 S.E.2d 490, 491\r\n  (1996).Â  Fatherâ€™s due process claims seemingly center around the\r\n  fact that the family court erred in finding it lacked jurisdiction.Â  Because we\r\n  determine the family court erred in finding it lacked jurisdiction, we find it\r\n  unnecessary to address whether Father was deprived of his due process rights.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-277","title":"In the Interest of Barry Mc.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2007-UP-277","description":null,"date":"2007-06-06","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nh1 {\r\n\ttext-align:center;\r\n\tpage-break-after:avoid;\r\n\tfont-size:20.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"ZapfChancery\", \"serif\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:normal;\r\n}\r\nh2 {\r\n\tpage-break-after:avoid;\r\n\tfont-size:16.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Arial\", \"sans-serif\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:normal;\r\n}\r\np.MsoFootnoteText, li.MsoFootnoteText, div.MsoFootnoteText {\r\n\tfont-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\", \"serif\";\r\n}\r\nspan.MsoFootnoteReference {\r\n\tvertical-align:super;\r\n}\r\np.MsoTitle, li.MsoTitle, div.MsoTitle {\r\n\ttext-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\", \"serif\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;\r\n}\r\ndiv.Section1 {\r\n\tpage:Section1;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS\r\n  OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE CITED OR RELIED ON AS\r\n  PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE 239(d)(2), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Interest of Barry Mc., A Juvenile under the age of seventeen (17), Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Richland County\r\nÂ Jeffrey Young, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-277\r\n  Submitted June 1, 2007 â€“ Filed June 6,\r\n  2007\r\n\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Acting Chief Attorney Joseph L.

Johnson, III, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Mark Altstaetter\r\n  and Beth-Ann Altstaetter appeal the grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\n  Liberty Insurance Corporation and its subsidiary, Liberty Mutual Insurance\r\n  Company (collectively Liberty).Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nMark Altstaetter sustained an injury while working for Balfour\r\n  Beatty, Inc. (Employer). Â Liberty provided workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  coverage for Employer.Â  Altstaetter filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim against\r\n  Employer and Liberty. Â Liberty appointed Sandy Mayhew, an employee of Liberty, as the nurse case manager for the claim.Â  As a nurse case manager, Mayhew takes\r\n  an active role in managing the treatment of a claimant, utilizing her nursing\r\n  skills.Â  Altstaetter concluded Mayhew neglected to inform him of his true\r\n  diagnosis, exacerbating his condition. Â The Altstaetters filed this action\r\n  against Liberty alleging, inter alia, negligence, breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty, and breach of good faith and fair dealing.Â  Liberty moved for dismissal\r\n  alleging the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act provided the Altstaettersâ€™ exclusive\r\n  remedy.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  reviewing affidavits and considering the partiesâ€™ arguments, the court treated\r\n  the matter as a motion for summary judgment and granted Liberty relief.Â  The\r\n  court denied the Altstaettersâ€™ motion for reconsideration and motion to correct\r\n  a scrivenerâ€™s error.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and\r\n  the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Fleming v.\r\n    Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493-94, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).Â  In determining\r\n  whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences,\r\n  which can reasonably be drawn therefrom, must be viewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Faile v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice,\r\n  350 S.C. 315, 324, 566 S.E.2d 536, 540 (2002).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.\r\nThe Altstaetters argue the circuit court\r\n  erred in finding as an â€œundisputed factâ€ that Liberty was functioning in its\r\n  capacity as the workersâ€™ compensation carrier and entitled to an employerâ€™s\r\n  immunity under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  We disagree.\r\nEmployers are immune from tort actions by employees for\r\n  work-related accidents or injuries because the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act\r\n  provides the exclusive remedy for an employee.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-540\r\n  (1985); Fuller v. Blanchard, 358 S.C. 536, 541, 595 S.E.2d 831, 834 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).Â  In Ancrum v. U.S.\r\n    Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., our\r\n  supreme court addressed the certified question of whether the immunity provided\r\n  to an employer extended to workersâ€™ compensation insurance carriers.Â  301 S.C.\r\n  32, 32, 389 S.E.2d 645, 645 (1989).Â  The court concluded a carrier enjoys an\r\n  employerâ€™s immunity under the act except when the carrier stands in the\r\n  position of a third party unrelated to its function as a compensation carrier.Â  Id. at 34, 389 S.E.2d at 646.Â  \r\nIn Ancrum,\r\n  the carrier provided safety inspections for its insured employers.Â  Id. at 32, 389 S.E.2d at 645.Â  The court provided a guideline to determine whether a\r\n  carrier functioning in such a capacity acted as a carrier or as an unrelated\r\n  third party:\r\n\r\n  Carriers\r\n    may perform safety inspections to assess risk and reduce on-the-job injuries in\r\n    order to minimize benefit payments and premium increases.Â  In such a case,\r\n    safety inspections would be integral to the function of a workerâ€™s compensation\r\n    carrier.Â  On the other hand, a carrier may contract with an employer as an\r\n    independent provider of safety inspections undertaking the employerâ€™s legal\r\n    duty to provide a reasonably safe work place.Â  In this situation, the carrier\r\n    would be performing as a third party and would not be immune from liability.Â \r\n    Evidence of such an agreement could include specific contractual language or\r\n    payment of additional fees for these services.\r\n\r\nId. at 34, 389 S.E.2d at 646. Â By contrast, this court in Fuller, refused to extend the employerâ€™s statutory immunity to a\r\n  physician.Â  358 S.C. at 543, 595 S.E.2d at 834-35.Â  In Fuller, the\r\n  allegedly negligent physician was an employee of Doctorâ€™s Care, providing\r\n  services to employees of Westinghouse pursuant to an agreement between Doctorâ€™s\r\n  Care and Westinghouse.Â  Id. at 539, 595 S.E.2d at 833.Â  Based on\r\n  Westinghouseâ€™s lack of the right to control the physician, this court concluded\r\n  the physician was an independent contractor of Westinghouse.Â  Id. at\r\n  543, 595 S.E.2d at 835. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560 (1985) (providing\r\n  remedies from third parties).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, we agree with the circuit court that, even in the light most\r\n  favorable to the Altstaetters, Mayhew was an employee of Liberty, acting in the\r\n  scope of employment, in furtherance of Libertyâ€™s function as an insurance\r\n  carrier rather than as an unrelated third party.[2]Â \r\n  Liberty provided nurse case managers as an ongoing part of its insurance\r\n  carrier service to its employer clients. Â The nurses were Liberty employees and\r\n  worked exclusively on workersâ€™ compensation cases.Â  Thus, we apply Ancrum and conclude Liberty is entitled to the immunity provided employers in the\r\n  act.Â  \r\nII.\r\nThe\r\n  Altstaetters also contend the circuit court erred in:Â  (1) interpreting Ancrum to mean there is a grant of immunity for any conduct of the carrier in trying\r\n  to return the employee to work; (2) holding that bad faith claims do not exist\r\n  if the bad faith occurs while trying to get the employee back to work as soon\r\n  as possible; and (3) holding that the Ancrum court granted absolute\r\n  immunity to the workersâ€™ compensation carrier for any conduct the carrier\r\n  undertakes so long as the purpose is to return the employee to work as soon as\r\n  possible.Â  These issues are not properly preserved for our review.Â  Where an\r\n  issue presented to the trial court is not explicitly ruled on in the final\r\n  order, the issue must be raised by an appropriate post-trial motion to be\r\n  preserved for appeal.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 460, 535\r\n  S.E.2d 438, 444-45 (2000) (finding where the trial judge does not explicitly\r\n  rule on an argument raised, and the issue is not raised in a Rule 59 motion,\r\n  the appellate court may not address the issue).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the court did not err in granting summary judgment.Â  Accordingly, the order on appeal is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ [1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n [2] We acknowledge the issue of whether Liberty was functioning as a carrier\r\n  is not undisputed, as argued by the Altstaetters in their post-trial motion to\r\n  correct a scrivenerâ€™s error and on appeal.Â  However, we find no genuine issue\r\n  of material fact as to this issue and accordingly view the circuit courtâ€™s use\r\n  of the term â€œundisputedâ€ as a scrivenerâ€™s error not entitling the Altstaetters\r\n  to relief.Â  See Owners Ins. Co. v. Clayton, 364 S.C. 555, 563,\r\n  614 S.E.2d 611, 615 (2005) (finding error without prejudice does not warrant\r\n  reversal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-300","title":"Stutts v.

Uricchio, III, both of Charleston,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Harper\r\n  Finucan, Inc., and Auto Workers Insurance appeal a circuit court order\r\n  reversing the final decision and order of the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Commission. Â Appellants argue the circuit court disregarded the\r\n  proper standard of review by making its own findings of fact and awarding\r\n  benefits to Jessie Stutts.Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nStutts\r\n  began working for Happy Finucan, owner of Harper Finucan, Inc., as a plumber in\r\n  March 2001.Â  Stutts was an hourly employee, but was not paid for his travel\r\n  time to or from work.Â  Finucan had initially agreed to provide Stutts with a\r\n  work vehicle, but this never happened.Â  Instead, Stutts bought a truck himself to\r\n  travel to and from work.Â  Stutts had his own insurance policy on his truck, was\r\n  free to use the truck as he chose, and was responsible for all repairs on his\r\n  truck.Â  However, Finucan or his subordinates routinely paid to fill up Stuttsâ€™\r\n  gas tank, usually once but sometimes twice in a week.Â  \r\nOn the morning of September 12, 2002, Stutts left his truck at\r\n  Rumphâ€™s Garage for repairs to the brakes. Finucan agreed to pay for these\r\n  repairs because Stutts could not afford them.Â  That afternoon after work,\r\n  Stutts picked up his truck and headed home.Â  On the way home, Stutts rear-ended\r\n  a tractor-trailor and sustained injuries.Â  \r\nAfter the\r\n  accident, Stutts filed a claim for workersâ€™ compensation.Â  The single commissioner\r\n  determined that Stuttsâ€™ injury was compensable under the provision of\r\n  transportation exception to the â€œgoing and coming rule.â€Â  The Appellate Panel\r\n  reversed, finding Stuttsâ€™ accident was unrelated to his employment and his\r\n  injury did not â€œoccur during the course and scope of his employment.â€Â  Further,\r\n  the Appellate Panel concluded that the exceptions to the â€œgoing and coming\r\n  ruleâ€ did not apply to this case because Â Finucan did not provide Stuttsâ€™\r\n  transportation, did not pay for Stuttsâ€™ travel time, and did not charge him\r\n  with any special errand after work that day.Â  \r\nStutts\r\n  appealed to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court reversed and reinstated the\r\n  decision of the single commissioner.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act\r\n  establishes the â€œsubstantial evidenceâ€ standard for judicial review of\r\n  decisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, 276\r\n  S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).Â  The findings of the Workersâ€™ Compensation\r\n  Commission will not be set aside if the findings are supported by substantial\r\n  evidence and are not controlled by legal error.Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd.,\r\n  339 S.C. 173, 528 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Substantial evidence is evidence\r\n  that, when viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach\r\n  the conclusion the commission reached. Lockridge v. Santens, 344 S.C.\r\n  511, 544 S.E.2d 842 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The appellate court may not substitute\r\n  its judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on\r\n  questions of fact.Â  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund,\r\n  363 S.C. 612, 611 S.E.2d 297 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFinucan and Auto Workers appeal the circuit court order awarding\r\n  benefits to Stutts, arguing the circuit court disregarded the proper standard\r\n  of review by making its own findings of fact.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nInjuries sustained while traveling to and\r\n  from work are generally not compensable under workersâ€™ compensation law.[2]Â  Eadie v. H.A. Sack Company, 322 S.C. 164, 168, 470 S.E.2d 397, 399 (Ct.\r\n  App 1996).Â  However, South Carolina recognizes five\r\n  exceptions to this rule: 1) if the\r\n  employer provides the means of transportation or pays travel time; 2) if the\r\n  employee performs duties during his commute; 3) if the way used is inherently\r\n  dangerous; 4) if the place where the injury occurs is in such close proximity\r\n  to the workplace that it is brought within the scope of employment; and\r\n  5) if the injury occurs while the employee is on a special errand for the\r\n  employer.Â  Id. 168-69, 400.Â  \r\nThe first exception is the\r\n  only one at issue here.Â  The Appellate Panel found this exception\r\n  did not apply because the â€œEmployer did not provide [Stutts] a means of\r\n  transportation by providing work tools, paying of one tank of gas each week,\r\n  and paying for repairs at Rumphâ€™s . . . .Â  The evidence establishes the [Stutts]\r\n  was driving his own vehicle.â€Â  However, the circuit court, relying on Eadie\r\n    v. H.A. Sack Co., found that these facts clearly constituted â€œprovision of\r\n  transportationâ€ by the employer.Â  322 S.C. 164, 470 S.E.2d 397 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n  Â Thus, the circuit court held that Stuttsâ€™ trip home qualified as an exception\r\n  to the â€œgoing and coming ruleâ€ and thereby brought Stutts within the benefits\r\n  of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act. \r\nWhether the circumstances of this case constitute the provision of\r\n  transportation is a question of fact, subject to the substantial evidence\r\n  standard of review.Â  Eadie v. H.A. Sack Co., 322 S.C. 164, 470 S.E.2d\r\n  397 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Thus, if substantial evidence supports the Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s finding, we must affirm.\r\nIn this case, Stutts purchased his own vehicle, paid his own\r\n  insurance and taxes on the vehicle, and was not paid any wage while traveling\r\n  to and from work.Â  Substantial evidence therefore supported the Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s determination that Finucan did not provide transportation to Stutts. \r\nFurther, we do not believe Eadie supports\r\n  reversal of the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding of fact.Â  In Eadie, the\r\n  employer admitted his provision of transportation to the employee, stating:\r\n  â€œthe bottom line is that the reimbursement of Eadieâ€™s mileage in his personal\r\n  vehicle at a rate of twenty-two cents per mile is the equivalent of providing a\r\n  company vehicle.â€Â  Eadie, 322 at 170, 470 S.E.2d at 400 (Ct. App.\r\n  1996).Â  The\r\n  Appellate Panel in Eadie found there was a provision of transportation,\r\n  and therefore claimant was entitled to benefits.Â  Thus, consistent with the\r\n  scope of review, the court of appeals found substantial evidence supported the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s decision and affirmed the award.\r\nIn this case, however, the Appellate Panel found\r\n  Finucan did not provide transportation to Stutts.Â  Like in Eadie, there\r\n  is substantial evidence to support that finding, and the circuit court therefore\r\n  erred in reversing the Appellate Panel.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s award\r\n  of benefits is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., and CURETON, A.J.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] This is often referred to\r\n  as the â€œgoing and coming rule.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-301","title":"SC Department of Social Services v.

Clare, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n          General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley E. Elliott, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail,\r\n          of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Devario\r\n  Simpson (Simpson) appeals his convictions for trafficking cocaine and resisting\r\n  arrest. Â Simpson argues the evidence seized and admitted at trial was the\r\n  result of an unlawful detention.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn the night of April 19, 2003, Deputy McBee of the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Department initiated a traffic stop of a vehicle driven by\r\n  Simpson. Â According to McBee, Simpsonâ€™s car came to a four-way stop across the\r\n  intersection from his patrol car. Â Simpson signaled a right turn and attempted\r\n  to yield the right-of-way to permit McBee to turn left and proceed before him. Â McBee\r\n  declined to turn left before Simpson and instead waved Simpson through the\r\n  intersection. Â Simpson then straightened his vehicleâ€™s wheels and proceeded to\r\n  go straight through the intersection rather than turning right. Â McBee\r\n  testified Simpsonâ€™s vehicle crossed the center line, before passing his patrol\r\n  car. Â McBee then turned and followed Simpson.Â  Simpson continued on the road at\r\n  a speed exceeding thirty-five miles per hour, which McBee believed was over the\r\n  speed limit for a residential road with no posted speed limit. Â McBee initiated\r\n  a traffic stop for crossing the center line and speeding. \r\nSimpson immediately stopped and exited the car and looked around\r\n  in a manner interpreted by Deputy McBee as an attempt to flee. Â McBee quickly\r\n  approached the car and pinned Simpson between the door and the body of the car.\r\n  Â McBee noticed Simpson had bulges in his pockets, so he searched Simpson for\r\n  weapons. Â McBee testified that as he attempted to pat down Simpsonâ€™s front\r\n  pockets, Simpson contorted his body in an attempt to pull away, so McBee\r\n  handcuffed Simpson and detained him for safety purposes. Â Officer McBee was\r\n  certain, after he completed the pat down, that the bulges in Simpsonâ€™s pants\r\n  were not weapons.\r\nAt this time, Simpsonâ€™s passenger exited the car and attempted to\r\n  intervene, so McBee called for backup. Â Deputy Rudy arrived and took custody of\r\n  Simpson while McBee tried to calm the passenger. Â As McBee spoke to the\r\n  passenger, he heard a scuffle and turned and saw Simpson push Rudy with his\r\n  shoulder. Â Rudy responded by placing Simpson under arrest for assaulting a\r\n  police officer. Â McBee joined Rudy and subdued Simpson. \r\nMeanwhile, another officer responded to the scene with a drug dog.\r\n  Â The dog alerted to the odor of narcotics inside the car. Â A search of the car\r\n  produced 800 grams of cocaine, $11,000 in currency, and other drug\r\n  paraphernalia. Â The officers also searched Simpsonâ€™s person incident to his\r\n  arrest for assaulting a police officer and seized over $6500 in cash from his\r\n  front pants pockets and a hotel key card. Â A search of Simpsonâ€™s hotel room\r\n  pursuant to a search warrant yielded some additional drug paraphernalia.Â  \r\nSimpson was tried by a jury and convicted of trafficking cocaine\r\n  and resisting arrest and acquitted of assault and battery.Â  Simpson was\r\n  sentenced to thirty years in prison for the trafficking charge and one year in\r\n  prison for the resisting arrest charge.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSimpson\r\n  argues his restraint and detention at the traffic stop became unlawful when\r\n  McBee determined he was not armed, and the subsequent searches of his person,\r\n  the car, and the hotel room were not legally justified.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only, and the\r\n  appellate courts are bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings unless they\r\n  are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827,\r\n  829 (2001).Â  â€œThis same standard of review applies to preliminary factual\r\n  findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal\r\n  cases.â€Â  Id. \r\nA.Â  Traffic\r\n  Stop\r\nThe decision to stop a vehicle is generally reasonable when the\r\n  police have probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred.Â  Whren\r\n    v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 810 (1996).Â  Additionally, â€œ[i]f the\r\n  officerâ€™s suspicions are confirmed or are further aroused, the stop may be\r\n  prolonged and the scope enlarged as required by the circumstances.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 248, 525 S.E.2d 535, 539 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Police\r\n  may briefly detain and question a person upon a reasonable suspicion, short of\r\n  probable cause for arrest, that the person is involved in criminal activity.Â  Terry\r\n    v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 22 (1968).Â  \r\nIn this\r\n  case, Deputy McBee observed Simpsonâ€™s car traveling on the wrong side of the\r\n  road for several feet as it went through an intersection.Â  When McBee turned\r\n  his patrol car around, Simpsonâ€™s car sped up and exceeded the speed limit.Â \r\n  McBee had ample justification to stop Simpsonâ€™s car.Â  Then, Simpson immediately\r\n  exited the car and looked around in a manner that was reasonably interpreted as\r\n  a possible attempt to flee.Â  That behavior coupled with the bulges in Simpsonâ€™s\r\n  pockets was sufficient to justify McBee in prolonging the stop.\r\nB. Terry Frisk\r\nA\r\n  police officer may frisk a person when he has a reasonable suspicion that the\r\n  individual is armed and dangerous, and the question is â€œwhether a reasonably\r\n  prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his\r\n  safety or that of others was in danger.â€Â  Id. at 27.Â  The term\r\n  reasonable suspicion requires that the officer articulate a particularized and\r\n  objective basis for his belief, and in determining whether reasonable suspicion\r\n  exists, the court must consider the totality of the circumstances.Â  Blassingame,\r\n  at 248, 525 S.E.2d at 539.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found that McBee articulated a particularized and objective basis\r\n  for his belief that Simpson might be armed and dangerous.Â  Simpson exited the\r\n  car and looked around frantically as soon as the car came to a stop.Â  McBee\r\n  testified that it looked like Simpson was going to run away, so he quickly\r\n  pinned Simpson against the car.Â  McBee testified that Simpsonâ€™s eyes were wide\r\n  and bulging, he was sweating profusely on a cool night, he looked nervous, and\r\n  he had two bulges in his pants pockets.Â  Based on those observations, McBee\r\n  justifiably believed the bulges could have been weapons, and he feared for his\r\n  safety.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  McBee informed Simpson he was going to search him for weapons, Simpson became\r\n  combative and twisted his body in an attempt to escape.Â  At this point, McBee\r\n  handcuffed Simpson as an additional safety measure.Â  When McBee completed the\r\n  pat down, he stopped searching Simpson because he was certain the bulges were\r\n  not weapons.Â  Under the circumstances, these actions were also justified.Â  \r\nC.Â  Search\r\n  Incident to Arrest\r\nOnce a person is under lawful arrest, a\r\n  contemporaneous search incident to arrest is proper.Â  Shipley v. California, 395 U.S. 818, 819 (1969).Â  The full search of a person under lawful arrest\r\n  does not require a search warrant and is considered reasonable under the Fourth\r\n  Amendment.Â  State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 131, 620 S.E.2d 737, 740\r\n  (2005).Â  Furthermore, a trained narcotics dogâ€™s sniff of a vehicle stopped in a\r\n  public place does not constitute a search, and the dogâ€™s positive alert for\r\n  drugs gives probable cause for a subsequent search of the vehicle.Â  State v.\r\n    Jeffus, 22 F.3d 554, 557 (4th Cir. 1994).Â  \r\nSimpsonâ€™s\r\n  passenger began to intervene in the situation by yelling and walking around the\r\n  scene.Â  When Deputy Rudy arrived on the scene, he attempted to further secure\r\n  Simpson while McBee attempted to calm Simpsonâ€™s passenger.Â  When Simpson pushed\r\n  Deputy Rudy, he was immediately arrested for assaulting an officer.Â  Simpson\r\n  was then lawfully searched incident to that arrest.Â  Independent of that\r\n  arrest, the trained drug sniffing dog alerted on Simpsonâ€™s car, which provided\r\n  the probable cause to search the car.Â  Under these circumstances, both the\r\n  search of Simpsonâ€™s person and the search of Simpsonâ€™s car were justified.Â  The\r\n  evidence obtained in these searches provided the probable cause to obtain the\r\n  search warrant for the search of Simpsonâ€™s hotel room.Â  The search of the hotel\r\n  room pursuant to a valid warrant was constitutionally valid as well.Â \r\n  Therefore, the evidenced seized during these searches was properly admitted\r\n  into evidence at trial.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court properly considered the totality of the circumstances surrounding\r\n  Simpsonâ€™s initial traffic stop, Terry frisk, search incident to arrest,\r\n  and search of the hotel room.Â  The record supports the circuit courtâ€™s rulings\r\n  on the admissibility of the evidence.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]Â  \r\nHUFF,\r\n  BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-305","title":"State v.

Robinson for an injury to his right shoulder and resulting psychological harm.Â  The award was upheld by both the Appellate Panel of the Commission and the circuit court.Â  The Greenville Water System and the State Accident Fund (collectively, â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal.Â  We affirm, holding substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s findings.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 1, 2003, Robinson, then 26 years old, suffered an admitted injury to his right shoulder while working for the Greenville Water System performing maintenance and construction work.Â  Robinsonâ€™s job required a lot of physical exertion, including lifting, climbing, and pulling.Â  At the time of his injury, Robinson was leaning over to lift or pull a cast iron meter box out of the ground when he â€œfelt something popâ€ in his right shoulder.Â  \r\n \r\nOn July 2, 2003, Robinson went to Exigent, an urgent care center, complaining of pain after pulling something in his neck and right arm while working the day before.Â  Dr. Thomas Maskell diagnosed Robinson as having a muscle strain, recommended medications, and allowed him to return to full work duties at Robinsonâ€™s request.Â  Dr. Maskell instructed Robinson to follow-up if he experienced any problems.Â  At a follow-up visit to Exigent on July 23, 2003, Dr. Lynn Owens noted Robinson continued to complain of throbbing pain in his right shoulder and difficulty with movement.Â  Dr. Owens recommended different medications and the restriction of his work to light duty.Â  Â Â \r\nOn August 1, 2003, Dr. Maskell reported Robinson had been continuing to work full time, but his right shoulder still bothered him.Â  Dr. Maskell scheduled an MRI scan and restricted Robinson to light duty.Â  According to Dr. Maskellâ€™s notes of August 11, 2003, Robinson had been sent home from light duty work by his employer.Â  The results of the MRI scan showed Robinson actually had a torn rotator cuff, not a pulled muscle as initially diagnosed, so Dr. Maskell referred Robinson to an orthopedist.Â  Â Â \r\nDr. Stephen Geary, an orthopedic surgeon, evaluated Robinson on August 18, 2003 and diagnosed him as having a full-thickness tear of the right dominant[2] rotator cuff, as well as some â€œmoderate degenerative changes of the AC jointâ€[3] and labrum.Â  On August 28, 2003, Dr. Geary performed surgery on Robinson.Â  Robinson continued to experience pain after the surgery, and he began undergoing physical therapy.Â  Â Â \r\nBecause of his continuing pain, Robinson sought a second opinion and was sent to another orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Alan Posta, for an examination.Â  On November 26, 2003, Dr. Posta recommended additional physical therapy and pain management treatment.Â  Dr. Posta found Robinson had a loss of range of motion, pain with overhead motion, tenderness throughout the shoulder, and decreased rotator cuff strength.Â  Dr. Posta opined Robinson had chronic pain and was in need of pain management treatment and further physical therapy, but he was capable of light duty.Â  According to Robinson, there was, effectively, no work for him with his employer because he was told that â€œthere was no such thing as light duty at [his] job.â€Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nOn December 17, 2003, Dr. Geary noted Robinson continued to complain of pain, especially with overhead activity.Â  Nevertheless, Dr. Geary determined Robinson had reached maximum medical improvement (â€œMMIâ€) â€œin regard to his right shoulderâ€ and released him from care, finding he had â€œa 15% (fifteen percent) permanent and partial impairment of his right dominant upper extremity.â€Â  Dr. Geary remarked in his notes that he had â€œnot placed any permanent restrictions onâ€ Robinson.Â  Â Â \r\nRobinson did not receive additional physical therapy past December 2003 despite repeated requests from his attorneys.Â  Robinson believed Dr. Gearyâ€™s attitude towards him changed after he requested a second opinion.Â  Robinson was terminated from his job with the Greenville Water System in February 2004.Â  Â Â \r\nRobinson suffered psychological distress from being unable to work and to resume his other normal activities.Â  Robinsonâ€™s pre-existing Touretteâ€™s syndrome became worse due to the psychological stress he was under from his work injury and chronic pain.Â  Robinson went to his family physician, Dr. Danny Caddell, for treatment of his worsening symptoms.Â  On April 19, 2004, Dr. Caddell concluded â€œRobinsonâ€™s Touretteâ€™s syndrome was aggravated by his work injury of July 1, 2003.â€Â  The same day, Dr. Caddell also reported that â€œRobinsonâ€™s problem with his nerves [was] caused and/or aggravated by his work injury of July 1, 2003.â€Â  In May 2004, Dr. Caddell expressly determined Robinson was in need of pain management treatment for the injuries he received at work.Â  Â Â \r\nIn June 2004, Robinson was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist, Dr. C. David Tollison, who stated in his professional opinion that Robinson had suffered the â€œexacerbation of a pre-existing psychological condition.â€Â  Specifically, Dr. Tollison opined that chronic pain has affected Robinsonâ€™s psychological state, which, in turn, has generated a level of anxiety, stress, and depression that has created protracted muscular spasms, thus increasing the intensity of Robinsonâ€™s pain and his perception of such.Â  Dr. Tollison recommended that Robinson â€œbe referred for specialty treatment in the two primary areas of impairment, that being residual pain and psychological symptoms.â€Â  Â Â \r\nOn May 25, 2004, Dr. George Bruce, an orthopedic surgeon, noted Robinson continued to complain of constant right arm and shoulder pain that limited his ability to raise his arm over his head or lift more than fifteen pounds.Â  Dr. Bruce stated â€œto a reasonable degree of medical certainty . . . [Robinson suffered] a full-thickness tear of his rotator cuff . . . .Â  As he presents today, he has decreased range of motion and decreased strength of his right shoulder, and decreased right hand grip.â€Â  Dr. Bruce believed Robinson had aggravated pre-existing degenerative conditions in his right shoulder in the accident and stated Robinson now has a â€œ27% physical impairment of the right upper extremity.â€Â \r\n \r\nAppellants, meanwhile, moved to terminate Robinsonâ€™s disability payments.Â  Appellants admitted Robinson sustained a compensable injury to his right shoulder, but denied that he was entitled to additional treatment or that he had suffered a compensable injury to any other body part or system.Â  Robinson contended that he needed additional medical treatment and continued temporary compensation benefits due to the injury to his right shoulder and a resulting psychological injury.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nBy order filed March 9, 2005, the Single Commissioner found Robinson had not reached MMI and the injuries to his right shoulder and his psyche were compensable.Â  The Single Commissioner ordered continuing medical treatment â€œto include additional physical therapy, pain management treatment, and psychological counseling.â€Â  Â Â \r\nThe Single Commissioner specifically found:Â  (1) while Dr. Geary had opined that Robinson was able to return to work in mid-December 2003, Dr. Posta stated at the end of November 2003 that Robinson should continue light duty; (2) Dr. Posta recommended additional physical therapy and pain management treatment that has not yet been provided; (3) the employer â€œis unable to provide [Robinson with] light duty workâ€; (4) Robinson â€œremains totally disabled from working because of his injuries, as he is still under light duty work restrictions and [the employer] is unable to provide work within these restrictionsâ€; (5) Robinson â€œhas developed emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, and increased symptoms of his Touretteâ€™s syndrome as a result of his continued right shoulder pain and his inability to work and function as he did before the accidentâ€; and (6) Robinson â€œhas sustained compensable injury to his psyche, including depression, anxiety and aggravation of his pre[-]existing Touretteâ€™s syndrome as a result of his injury by accident, his related physical injuries, and his ongoing pain and limitations.â€ Â Â Â Â Â \r\nA unanimous Appellate Panel adopted the order of the Single Commissioner in its entirety on September 30, 2005, concluding the Findings of Fact and Rulings of Law were correct as stated therein.Â  By order filed March 1, 2006, the circuit court affirmed the order of the Appellate Panel, upholding the Commissionâ€™s findings.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  MMI\r\nOn appeal, Appellants assert the only evidence in the record is that Robinson has reached MMI and that his benefits should be terminated.Â  They assert the Commission erred in awarding continuing benefits.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Under the APA, an appellate court may reverse or modify an administrative agencyâ€™s ruling if the agencyâ€™s findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are affected by an error of law or are clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence in the whole record.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5)(d) &amp; (e) (Supp. 2006).Â \r\n \r\nâ€œThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 519, 466 S.E.2d 357, 359&nbsp;(1996).Â  Substantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion reached by the Commission.Â  Id. \r\n \r\nThe Commission is the ultimate fact-finder in workersâ€™ compensation cases and is not bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Brayboy v. Clark Heating Co., 306 S.C. 56, 409 S.E.2d 767 (1991) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-50); see also Ross v. Am. Red Cross, 298 S.C. 490, 381 S.E.2d 728 (1989).Â  The final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Commission.Â  Ross, 298 S.C. at 492, 381 S.E.2d at 730.Â  A court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission concerning the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006); see also Ellis v. Spartan Mills, 276 S.C. 216, 219, 277 S.E.2d 590, 591 (1981) (stating â€œit is not the task of courts to weigh the evidence as found by the [C]ommissionâ€).Â \r\n \r\nThe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not mean the Commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Ellis, 276 S.C. at 218, 277 S.E.2d at 591. Â â€œWhere there is a conflict in the evidence, either by different witnesses or in the testimony of the same witness, the findings of fact of the Commission are conclusive.â€Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845&nbsp;(1999). \r\n \r\nMMI â€œis a term used to indicate that a person has reached such a plateau that in the physicianâ€™s opinion there is no further medical care or treatment which will lessen the degree of impairment.â€Â  Oâ€™Banner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24, 28, 459 S.E.2d 324, 327 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Even if an employee has reached MMI, further medical care or treatment may still be appropriate.Â  See Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc.,&nbsp;334 S.C. 574, 581, 514 S.E.2d 593, 596-97&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999) (â€œAlthough this medical care or treatment may not reduce the claimantâ€™s degree of physical impairment, it may â€˜tend to lessen the period of disability.â€™â€ (citation omitted)).Â  Whether an employee has reached MMI is a factual determination that is left to the discretion of the Commission.Â  Gadson v. Mikasa Corp., 368 S.C. 214, 224, 628 S.E.2d 262, 268 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nWe agree with the circuit court that substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s finding that Robinson has not reached MMI and that he is entitled to additional benefits.Â  As the circuit court noted, although there was some evidence from Dr. Gearyâ€™s notes that Robinson had reached MMI, at least as to his physical injury, there was conflicting evidence that Robinson had not.Â  Such conflicts should be resolved by the Commission and do not preclude a determination that the Commissionâ€™s findings are supported by substantial evidence.Â \r\n \r\nIn contrast to Dr. Gearyâ€™s findings, Dr. Posta recommended additional physical therapy and pain management treatment for Robinson and restricted him to light duty on November 26, 2003.Â  In addition, Dr. Caddell continued to treat Robinsonâ€™s shoulder pain and his worsening Touretteâ€™s syndrome.Â  In May 2004 Dr. Caddell specifically recommended additional treatment for Robinson.Â  There was also medical evidence from Dr. Tollison, a licensed clinical psychologist, that Robinson sustained an injury to his psyche as a result of his work accident and had continuing pain from his physical injuries.Â  As late as June 2004, Dr. Tollison recommended that Robinson be referred for specialty treatment for two areas of impairment, Robinsonâ€™s residual pain and his psychological symptoms.Â  Â Â \r\nAppellants argue Dr. Postaâ€™s recommendation of additional physical therapy occurred prior to Dr. Gearyâ€™s determination of MMI; therefore, no additional therapy is needed.Â  Dr. Posta recommended additional physical therapy and pain management treatment on November 26, 2003.Â  Just a few weeks later, on December 17, 2003, Dr. Geary ended Robinsonâ€™s treatment when he concluded Robinson was at MMI as to his right shoulder.Â  The Commissionâ€™s interpretation was that Dr. Posta was recommending a continuation of treatment, not an imminent cessation of treatment in December, and we find this interpretation reasonable in light of the evidence that Robinson continued to have both physical and psychological problems as a result of his work accident well into the following year.Â  Robinson testified he sought a second opinion from Dr. Posta because Dr. Geary was winding up his treatment even though he was still experiencing problems.Â  The Commission also relied on the medical records of Dr. Caddell, who recommended additional treatment in 2004.Â  Accordingly, we hold substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s findings in this regard.\r\nII.Â  Psychological Injury\r\nAppellants next contend the Commission erred in finding Robinson has sustained a compensable injury to his psyche as a result of his work accident.Â  They further contend even if the condition is compensable, it does not preclude a determination that Robinson has reached MMI.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Commission determined Robinson â€œhas sustained compensable injury to his psyche, including depression, anxiety and aggravation of his pre[-]existing Touretteâ€™s syndrome as a result of his injury by accident, his related physical injuries, and his ongoing pain and limitations.â€Â  This finding was based on Robinsonâ€™s testimony and the medical records of Dr. Caddell and Dr. Tollison.Â \r\n \r\nOur supreme court has held that â€œ[m]ental injuries are compensable if they are induced either by physical injury or by unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment.â€Â  Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr.,&nbsp;343 S.C. 487, 493, 541 S.E.2d 526, 528&nbsp;(2001).Â  â€œAggravation of pre-existing psychiatric problems is compensable if that aggravation is caused by a work-related physical injury.â€Â  Id.Â  When deciding if causation has been established, the Commission has the discretion to weigh and consider both lay and expert evidence, including lay testimony regarding the employeeâ€™s health before and after the accident.Â  Tiller, 334 S.C. at 339-40, 513 S.E.2d at 846.\r\nWe agree with the circuit court that substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s finding that Robinson has sustained a compensable injury to his psyche.Â  As noted above, Dr. Tollison expressly determined Robinsonâ€™s pre-existing psychological problems and Touretteâ€™s syndrome were exacerbated by his work injury.Â  Dr. Tollison stated Robinson reported being unable to sleep well because of his discomfort and that he had lost twenty pounds as constant pain left him with no appetite.Â  He noted Robinson has experienced frustration, stress, and depressive symptoms and has had a difficult time adjusting to the multiple lifestyle changes caused by his chronic pain and not being able to work and live as he did prior to the accident.Â  Dr. Tollison concluded Robinsonâ€™s chronic pain had affected his psychological state.Â  \r\n\r\nIn April 2004 Dr. Caddell also opined that Robinsonâ€™s Touretteâ€™s syndrome was aggravated by his work injury.Â  Dr. Caddell further stated Robinsonâ€™s â€œproblem with his nerves [was] caused and/or aggravated by his work injury of July 1, 2003.â€Â  In May 2004 Dr. Caddell recommended pain management for Robinson.Â Â Â \r\n \r\nMoreover, Robinson himself testified that his continued pain and inability to function as he did before his injury had caused him emotional problems and increased his pre-existing problems with Touretteâ€™s syndrome.Â  He expressly stated his inability to return to work has almost â€œmade [him] go crazy.â€Â  Robinson, who had four children, stated he had worked since he was twelve years old and had been with his employer for five years and wanted to get better so he could return to work.Â  Robinsonâ€™s employer reported no problems with Robinson prior to this accident for the five years he had been there.Â  Although Robinson acknowledged he did have some marital problems, he stated he had a normal marriage until this accident.Â  As the circuit court observed, Dr. Tollison specifically recognized the other stressors in Robinsonâ€™s life, such as his pre-existing Touretteâ€™s syndrome and his marital situation, but still opined that Robinsonâ€™s psychological condition was caused by his work injury.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the Commissionâ€™s finding of a compensable psychological injury and its related findings regarding MMI.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Robinson is right-handed.Â  \r\n \r\n[3]Â  The â€œAC jointâ€ refers to the acromioclavicular joint, i.e., the joint between the acromion (shoulder blade) and the clavicle (collarbone).Â  See generally Taberâ€™s Cyclopedic Dictionary 32, 398 (17th ed. 1993) (discussing the acromioclavicular joint and the clavicle, respectively).\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-312","title":"Owens v.

Shelton, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Gracie Thompkins appeals the special refereeâ€™s decision finding her in contempt of court and awarding costs and attorney fees to Charles Owens.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn an order filed January 16, 2003, the special referee found Charles Owens enjoyed a prescriptive easement over Gracie and Joseph Thompkinsâ€™ land for the purpose of accessing his borrow pit.[2]Â  The special referee further found Owens was entitled to commercial use of the full width of this easement known as Joseph Road.Â  These findings were not appealed.\r\nOn December 14, 2004, Owens motioned the Horry County Court of Common Pleas for a Rule to Show Cause why Gracie and Joseph Thompkins should not be held in contempt of court for violating the January 16, 2003 order.Â  In his supporting memorandum, Owens alleged the order was violated because the placement of two boats partially obstructed Joseph Road and because Gracie Thompkins stopped trucks as they attempted to enter the site.Â  Â Â Gracie and Joseph Thompkins responded with a motion to Correct and Define Final Order seeking to have the special referee designate the boundaries of the prescriptive easement.Â \r\n \r\nUpon agreement of the parties, the above motions were referred with finality to the special referee.Â  Subsequent to a hearing on this matter, the special referee, in his April 26, 2005 order, dismissed Gracie and Jospeph Thompkinsâ€™ motion as time barred, held them in contempt of the January 16, 2003 order, and ordered them to pay Owensâ€™s costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The special referee denied Thompkins motion to alter or amend the April 26, 2005 order, and she now appeals.Â \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to preservation of order in judicial proceedings.â€Â  Davis v. Davis, 372 S.C. 64, ___, 641 S.E.2d 446, 455 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  On appeal, the trial courtâ€™s decision regarding contempt should be reversed only if it is without evidentiary support or if the trial judge has abused his discretion.Â  Id.Â  When a party is found to have violated a court order, the question of whether or not to impose sanctions remains a matter for the courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Browning v. Browning, 366 S.C. 255, 263, 621 S.E.2d 389, 392-93 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs where either the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.Â  Browning, 366 S.C. at 263, 621 S.E.2d at 393.Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThompkins contends the special referee erred in finding her in contempt for violating his previous order because the order did not identify the location or dimensions of the subject road with specificity.Â  We disagree.\r\nContempt results from the willful disobedience of a court order.Â  Davis, 372 S.C. at ___, 641 S.E.2d at 455.Â  â€œA willful act is one which is â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™ â€ Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988)).Â  In a contempt proceeding for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of a court order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance with the order.Â  Davis, 372 S.C. at ___, 641 S.E.2d at 455.Â  Once the moving party has made out a prima facie case, the burden is then shifted to the respondent to establish his or her defense and inability to comply with the courtâ€™s order.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nAfter the special refereeâ€™s January 2003 order was issued, Thompkins did not make any motion to clarify the boundaries of Owens easement on Joseph Road.Â  It was only after Owens had filed his rule to show cause that Thompkins informed the special referee that his order had left her unsure of the boundaries of the easement.Â  This motion was properly found to be time barred, but Thompkins continues to rely upon this reasoning as a defense to her contempt.Â \r\n \r\nOwens utilized testimony, photographs, county records, police incident reports and other written documentation between his counsel and counsel for Thompkins to establish that obstructions were placed upon Joseph Road.Â  Through photographs and testimony, Owens established that these obstructions did not exist at the time the January 2003 order was issued, and now resulted in non-compliance with that order.Â  Having established a prima facie case, Owens effectively switched the burden to Thompkins to establish a defense.\r\nThompkins does not deny that the complained of items were placed where Owens states they were placed; she states that she is not in contempt because she did not know the boundaries of the Joseph Road easement.Â  Thompkins, having not requested the special referee clarify the boundaries prior to Owensâ€™s action, now seeks to plead ignorance as an excuse for failing to comply with the January 2003 order.Â  However, even after the special referee, in his August 9, 2005 amended order and rule to show cause, specifically instructed Thompkins to â€œrelocate all boats, campers, and other vehicles parked along Joseph Lane [Road],â€ Thompkins failed to comply.Â Â \r\n \r\nIn his January 2003 order, the special referee utilized â€œpictures, plats, and affidavits in finding â€œoverwhelming evidenceâ€ that Joseph Road has been in its current location for more than twenty years.Â  The special referee visited Joseph Road and determined the boundaries represented in a 2001 plat were accurate.Â  In his April 26, 2006 order which found Thompkins to be in contempt, the special referee noted that he had relied on the boundaries established in the 2001 plat in preparing his January 2003 order.[3]Â  Further, the \r\n \r\nApril 2006 order stated that the 2001 plat boundaries were identical to the boundaries noted in the 2005 survey which was provided to the special referee during the contempt hearing.Â  This 2005 survey included the two boats of which Owens complained and illustrates that each boat is clearly within the boundaries of Joseph Road.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe special referee found that Owens had â€œshown clearly and convincingly that [Thompkins] had repeatedly violated the January 2003 order as well as the December 2004 order and rule to show cause and the August 2005 amended order and rule to show cause.â€Â  Thompkins claims that she did not personally place the objects on or near Joseph Road, however, Thompkins has repeatedly stated that Joseph road is her personal property.Â  Accordingly, in his April 2006 order, the special referee noted that Thompkins has â€œfull control of it [Joseph Road] as it is [her] personal propertyâ€ and that she had â€œcontinuously permitted [her] tenants to place upon Defendantâ€™s [Thompkins] private property the many vehicles and other items shown in Plaintiffâ€™s [Owens] hearing exhibits.â€Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nUnder our limited standard of review and granting the required deference[4] to the special referee who was in a better position to observe the witnesses and adjudge their credibility as well as having the opportunity to visit the site itself, we find there is sufficient evidence to uphold the contempt finding.Â  Because we find no abuse of discretion and uphold the finding of contempt, we uphold the special refereeâ€™s award of costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the special referee did not abuse his discretion in finding Thompkins to be in contempt.Â  Based on the foregoing, the special refereeâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Joseph Thompkins is now deceased.Â  Any mention of only â€œThompkinsâ€ in this appeal refers to Gracie Thompkins individually and as Personal Representative of Josephâ€™s estate.Â \r\n \r\n[3] We note the special referee referred to â€œplats,â€ but did not specifically refer to the 2001 plat in his January 2003 order.Â  However, this was the plat available to the court and the parties during the July 2002 hearings which determined the existence of an easement.\r\n[4] See Shirley v.

Self appeals the circuit courtâ€™s award of summary judgment to defendants City of Gaffney (City), County of Cherokee (County), and Mark D. Vanderburg.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 15, 1997, Self was arrested in Gaffney at the home of John D. McCall on a charge of trespass after notice.Â  Self, who was dating or had recently dated McCall, had entered the dwelling with permission but refused to depart when asked.Â  In response, McCall called 911. Â Officer Vanderburg and another policeman responded to the call and informed Self she would have to exit the home.Â  When she again refused, she was arrested.Â  There is no evidence or allegation that Self was injured or otherwise mistreated or mishandled during the arrest.Â  She was transported by Vanderburg to the Gaffney city jail without incident.Â \r\n \r\nSelf was booked and placed in a holding cell at the jail with several other female inmates.Â  She was taken before a magistrate after approximately three hours; however her bond was not set at that time because she was crying so hysterically that the magistrate did not feel he could properly communicate with her.Â  She was then taken back to the holding cell.Â  At some point, Self complained of breathing problems, irregular heartbeat, and numbness.Â  A detention officer responded to her complaint, and she was taken to Upstate Carolina Medical Center approximately twenty minutes later.Â  According to Self, the officers who transported her dragged her down the hallway, placed her in a swivel chair, and rolled her outside to a police car for transport to the hospital.Â  She asserts that she was bruised as a result of this conduct.\r\nOnce at the medical center, Self demanded to be transported elsewhere and refused to sign a consent form in order to receive treatment.Â  She then returned to jail but was soon released.Â  Her entire time of incarceration totaled twenty seven hours.Â  She was later adjudicated not guilty of the trespass after notice charge.\r\nThe morning of her release from jail, Self chose to return to Upstate Carolina Medical Center for treatment.Â  One to two weeks after her arrest, she visited a family doctor who prescribed her migraine medication.Â  No other diagnosis or other treatment, physical or psychological, was ever given or recommended.\r\nSelf brought suit against the City, County, and Vanderburg, alleging: (1) malicious prosecution; (2) assault and battery; and (3) gross negligence in failing to properly train, discipline, and supervise employees.Â  The circuit court awarded the defendants summary judgment as to all three causes of action.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSelf claims the circuit court improperly granted summary judgment for the defendants.Â  We disagree.\r\nSelfâ€™s claims are governed by the provisions of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-10 et. seq.Â  The Act provides for a limited waiver of general sovereign immunity; however, it specifically limits the liability of the State, its agencies, political subdivisions, and other governmental entities for causes of action sounding in tort.Â  The Act contains a nonexclusive list of thirty seven specific exceptions to the limited waiver of immunity.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60 (2005).Â  Selfâ€™s remedy under the Act is the sole, exclusive civil remedy for any tort committed by a governmental entity or government employee acting within the scope of his or her employment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-20(b), 15-78-30 (2005).Â  Based on these exceptions, the City, County, and Vanderburg were all properly awarded summary judgment on each of Selfâ€™s tort claims.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(25) (2005) provides that a governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from â€œresponsibility or duty including but not limited to supervision, protection, control, confinement or custody of any . . . prisoner [or] inmate . . . of any governmental entity, except when the responsibility or duty is exercised in a grossly negligent manner.â€ Â Despite Selfâ€™s arguments to the contrary, the Tort Claims Act clearly places a standard of gross negligence on her claims.\r\nIn her complaint, Self makes only vague and general allegations of negligence.Â  Self never identifies any particular individual in conjunction with her assault and battery claim, but only generally claims that she received bruises from jail personnel in conjunction with her transport to the hospital.Â  In the body of her complaint, there is a general allegation the defendants failed to properly train and supervise officers in the jail. Â In the prayer for relief, there is another â€œclaimâ€ of gross negligence for the alleged failure to provide medical care.Â  In order to prove any of her claims, Self must show the City, County, or Vanderburg was grossly negligent in their actions.Â  A showing of simple negligence is not enough to defeat the protections of the Act.\r\nSouth Carolina courts have recognized that â€œgross negligenceâ€ is a relative term, generally meaning the â€œabsence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.â€Â  Hicks v. McCandlish, 221 S.C. 410, 415, 70 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1952).Â  Gross negligence essentially involves an â€œintentional, conscious failure to do something which it is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that one ought not to do.â€Â  Richardson v. Hambright, 296 S.C. 504, 506, 374 S.E.2d 296, 298 (1988).Â  This degree of negligence connotes the failure to exercise even a slight degree of care.Â  Wilson v. Etheredge, 214 S.C. 396, 400, 52 S.E.2d 812, 814 (1949); Anderson v. Ballenger, 166 S.C. 44, 55, 164 S.E. 313, 317 (1932).Â  Conversely, there is no gross negligence where slight care is exercised.Â  While gross negligence is ordinarily a mixed question of law and fact, when the evidence supports but one reasonable inference, the question is solely a matter of law.Â  Etheredge v. Richland County Sch. Dist. One, 341 S.C. 307, 534 S.E.2d 275 (2000).\r\nIn Etheredge v. Richland County Sch. Dist. One, a high school student was stabbed and killed on campus. Upholding the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to the school, our supreme court held that because the school had only indirect knowledge, if any, of the animosity between the students, provided the hall monitors with walkie-talkies, locked doors between classes, and circulated a daily list of suspended students, the school exercised at least slight care and was entitled to summary judgment pursuant to Â§ 15-78-60.\r\nIn Moore v. Berkley County Sch. Dist., 326 S.C. 584, 486 S.E.2d 9 (Ct. App. 1997), the plaintiff sued the school because her son was sexually assaulted by a teacher.Â  This court held that even though there was evidence the teacher conducted her classroom in a lax manner, allowed the lights to be dimmed, and allowed her students to give her back rubs, this did not amount to sufficient notice to hold the school liable under the gross negligence standard.Â  The court held the school had no notice the teacher had made any inappropriate advances toward the student and that, in any event, the inappropriate classroom behavior would still not have created notice that the teacher would have the student over to her home to have sexual contact with him there.\r\nIn this case, the jail had requirements for jailer training and experience.Â  These included a high school diploma, two years experience in a job requiring public contact, eighty hours of training and graduation from the Criminal Justice Academy, and twenty additional hours of formal training annually.Â  The jailâ€™s physical force policies prohibited the unnecessary use of force.Â  Nonetheless, even assuming the detention officers performed all of the acts Self alleged, upon examining the types of conduct our appellate courts have held do not rise, as matter of law, to the level of gross negligence, it is clear the City and County were not grossly negligent in failing to properly train, discipline, and supervise employees.\r\nAs to the claim relating to an alleged failure to provide medical care, an inmate is entitled to reasonable medical care but is not entitled to choose the particular course of treatment he or she receives, so long as the treatment is adequate.Â  See Deâ€™Lonta v. Angelone, 330 F.3d 630 (2003).Â  Transport to a different medical facility was neither Selfâ€™s right nor the jailâ€™s obligation.Â  By promptly transporting Self to Upstate Carolina Medical Center, the City and County were obviously not grossly negligent in this regard.\r\nBecause there is absolutely no evidence in the record indicating any gross negligence on the part of the City and County, the circuit court properly dismissed Selfâ€™s claims against these defendants.\r\nSelf argues the circuit court erred in dismissing Vanderburg as a individual defendant because Self swore in her affidavit that he arrested her with malice.Â  She infers this malice directly from her opinion that the arrest was made without probable cause.Â  A plain reading of the trial courtâ€™s order shows, however, that its ruling on Vanderburgâ€™s liability was based on other grounds, each of which supports his dismissal.\r\nThe circuit court held that under the Tort Claims Act, an employee is not personally liable for torts committed while acting within the scope of his official duty.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(a) (2005).Â  Because Vanderburg was clearly within the scope of his official duty when he responded to a 911 call as the on duty police officer, he is not properly named as a defendant in this suit.\r\nAdditionally, the court held that even if Vanderburg could be properly named as a defendant, in light of Selfâ€™s claim of malice based on lack of probable cause, her claims as they relate to him are barred by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(3) and Â§ 15-78-60(4).Â  These Tort Claims Act exceptions provide immunity for an alleged loss arising out of the lawful implementation of process and the enforcement of state law.Â  Vanderburg was one the arresting officers and was not involved in any way with Selfâ€™s claims arising from her alleged injuries during her detention.Â  Her claims, therefore, are based solely on Vanderburg arresting her for trespass after notice and he was therefore entitled to be dismissed from the action.\r\nLastly, Vanderburg was entitled to be dismissed on the ground that Self, despite her bare and conclusory allegations of malice, failed to offer any evidence to prove the common law elements of her malicious prosecution claim.Â  Lack of probable cause is an essential element to a malicious prosecution claim.Â  Whitner v. Duke Power Co., 277 S.C. 397, 288 S.E.2d 389 (1982).Â  â€œâ€˜Probable causeâ€™ is defined as a good faith belief that a person is guilty of a crime when this belief rests on such grounds as would induce an ordinarily prudent and cautious man, under the circumstances, to believe likewise.â€Â  Jones v. City of Columbia, 301 S.C. 62, 65, 389 S.E.2d 662, 663 (1990). Â Trespass after notice is a misdemeanor criminal offense and involves â€œthe failure to leave a dwelling house, place of business or premises of another after having been requested to leave.â€Â  State v. Cross, 323 S.C. 41, 44, 448 S.E.2d 569, 570 (Ct. App. 1994); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-620 (2003).Â  Selfâ€™s obvious trespass after notice was committed in Vanderburgâ€™s presence, clearly providing him probable cause to make the arrest and was therefore properly granted summary judgment and dismissed.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s award of summary judgment for the respondents is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-314","title":"State v.

Caldwell, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-315\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2007 â€“ Filed June 12, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART,\r\nREVERSED IN PART\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJohnny Gardner, of Conway, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAnita Ruth Floyd, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this domestic matter, Karen Watts (Mother) argues the family court erred in:Â  (1) failing to award her attorneyâ€™s fees and costs; (2) modifying the partiesâ€™ visitation schedule; and (3) finding her in contempt for denying Mace Watts (Father) visitation with their minor child.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties were married on September 2, 1995, and they had one child, Tyler (Son), born on February 13, 1996.Â  In 2002, Mother discovered Father was involved in an adulterous relationship, and both parties filed for divorce.Â  Father never denied the adultery, and a decree granting a divorce on that basis was filed March 27, 2003.Â  Incorporated into the divorce decree was a consent agreement concerning custody, visitation, property division, alimony, and additional payments to Mother.Â  It was agreed that primary custody of Son would go to Mother, with liberal visitation to Father, including: Â every other weekend; every other Tuesday evening; the first Wednesday of every month for Boy Scouts; four weeks of visitation during the summer months; from the beginning of Christmas break until 4:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve; alternating Spring Break/Easter and Thanksgiving holidays; every Fatherâ€™s Day weekend; and daily telephone visitation on days Son was with Mother.Â  It does not appear from the record that either party appealed from the final divorce decree. \r\n \r\nThereafter, the parties had a contemptuous relationship at the expense of their son.Â  A few days after the final divorce hearing, Mother requested money from Father to help with Sonâ€™s candy sale fundraiser at school.Â  Instead of placing the check under Motherâ€™s doormat in advance, as requested, Father sent a check to the school late through an assistant, and Mother tore the check up in front of Son and his classmates.Â  Although Mother was awarded custody of Son every Motherâ€™s Day weekend, Father planned his wedding to his former paramour, Bobbie, for the Friday of Motherâ€™s Day weekend at Bald Head Island, North Carolina. Â Mother refused to allow Son to attend the wedding, and she insisted that Son attend the â€œMoms and Muffinsâ€ event that same Friday morning at school in Horry County.Â  Father claimed Mother interfered with his court-ordered telephone visitation with Son by not answering the telephone or by yelling at him over the phone in Sonâ€™s presence.Â  Mother denied interfering with telephone visitation, but she claimed Father called all the time and she sometimes avoided the constant telephone calls.Â  There was also an incident where Father came to Motherâ€™s house, despite being warned that he should not appear there, demanded that Mother sign the partiesâ€™ tax returns on short notice and without giving her a copy, and still failed to file the tax returns for several months.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nOn April 30, 2003, Father filed the underlying action primarily requesting modification of visitation so that he could have Son on Motherâ€™s Day weekend to participate as his best man in his wedding.Â Â  The complaint also requested modification of visitation in general, a finding of contempt against Mother for denying him visitation with the child, and a determination of whether Mother was a fit and proper person to maintain custody of the child.Â  Father obtained an emergency order to ensure that Son could go to the wedding in North Carolina.Â  However, on the morning of the wedding, Father returned Son to his school at 7:15 a.m. for the â€œMoms and Muffinsâ€ event.Â  Mother did not arrive at the â€œMoms and Muffinsâ€ event until it was nearly over, and she later drove Son that morning to Bald Head Island, North Carolina, for Fatherâ€™s wedding that evening.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nAfter Fatherâ€™s wedding, several confrontations between Mother, Father, and Bobbie took place.Â  Mother changed Sonâ€™s school without informing Father.Â  Mother refused to allow Bobbie and Father to pick up Son for Fatherâ€™s visitation at Sonâ€™s school.Â  In one instance, when Mother learned Bobbie had accompanied Father to the school to pick Son up for weekend visitation, Mother took Son, placed him in her car, and attempted to leave with him.Â  Father then blocked Motherâ€™s exit, causing the police to be called and again embarrassing Son in front of his classmates.Â  Mother claimed that the visitation agreement did not allow Father to pick Son up from school.Â  Mother also arranged to volunteer at Sonâ€™s school on Fridays when Father picked Son up for visitation, which led to unnecessary confrontations.Â  Mother further failed to inform Father that notices were sent to the former marital home regarding a bad check that he had written, ultimately resulting in Father getting arrested at Sonâ€™s school for writing a bad check. Â Â Â Â \r\nMother eventually filed an answer and counterclaim, generally denying Fatherâ€™s allegations and claiming that Bobbie was a dangerous, immoral person and not proper to care for Son.Â  A trial was held on the matter on February 17, 18, and 19, 2004.Â  The court issued an order chastising both parties for their behavior which was detrimental to Son and modifying visitation.Â  Because the parties disputed the location that Father should pick up Son for exercising visitation, the court specified that Father should pick up Son at school and return Son to school during the school year and pick him up from his home at noon on Friday and return Son home at noon on Monday when school is not in session.Â  The court granted Father additional overnight visitation on alternating Wednesdays.Â  The court also specified the weeks Father could exercise summer visitation, granted Father visitation every Thanksgiving holiday, changed the partiesâ€™ previously agreed upon Christmas visitation schedule, and limited Fatherâ€™s telephone visitation with Son to 7:00 p.m. every Thursday.Â  The court held Mother in contempt for interfering with Fatherâ€™s visitation and directed each party to pay their own attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Motherâ€™s motion to reconsider was denied, and this appeal followed. Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œNor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 2005); see also Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting that because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it should accord great deference to the family courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility are involved).Â  Our broad scope of review does not relieve appellant of her burden to convince this court that the family court committed error.Â  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees \r\nMother contends the family court erred in failing to award her attorneyâ€™s fees and costs and erred in failing to consider and apply the relevant criteria for determining such awards.Â  We disagree. \r\n \r\nInitially, we note this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Mother complained in her Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion that the family court should have awarded her attorneyâ€™s fees and costs because:Â  (1) Husband had the greater financial ability to pay the fees; and (2) Husband was largely unsuccessful in gaining custody or in most of his contempt complaints.Â Â  Mother never argued that the family court failed to consider the appropriate factors in reaching the decision that each party be responsible for their own fees.Â  Because the issue is being raised for the first time on appeal, it is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Bryant v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 342 S.C. 159, 171-72, 536 S.E.2d 380, 387 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that a party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal); Joubert v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Serv., 341 S.C. 176, 184, 534 S.E.2d 1, 5 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review).Â Â Â  Â \r\nIn any event, the family court has statutory authority to assess attorneyâ€™s fees against a party.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420 (38) (Supp. 2006); Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  An â€œaward of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.â€ Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989). Â In determining whether attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded, the court should consider the following factors:Â  the partyâ€™s ability to pay his/her own attorneyâ€™s fees; beneficial results obtained by the attorney; the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M, 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the reasonable amount of attorneyâ€™s fees to award, the family court should consider the nature, extent and difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  The same considerations apply when awarding litigation expenses.Â  Patel, at 533, 599 S.E.2d at 123.Â  An award of attorneyâ€™s fees will be upheld as long as there is sufficient evidence in the record to support each factor.Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 308, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997).Â  \r\n \r\nMother argues her case is on point with this courtâ€™s recent case of Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 318, 608 S.E.2d 147, 155 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  In Lacke, the mother had to bring an action to enforce the fatherâ€™s obligation from their divorce decree to help with their daughterâ€™s college expenses.Â  The family court denied the motherâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees, stating:Â  â€œI further find that both parties shall be responsible for their own attorney fees and costs associated with this action.â€Â  Lacke, 362 S.C. at 317, 608 S.E.2d at 155.Â  The Lacke court held that the â€œsuccinct and brief statement fail[ed] to provide any evidence the trial court considered the appropriate factors in reaching its decision.â€Â  Id.Â  The question of whether attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded was remanded to the family court for consideration of the â€œappropriate factors.â€Â  Id. at 318, 302 S.E.2d at 155.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tIn the present case, the family courtâ€™s order stated: \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tHaving concluded that both parties are at fault in this controversy, I conclude they should pay their own attorney fees.Â  The guardian ad litem worked hard on this case and rendered valuable service to [the child.]Â  He is a practicing attorney and his fees and costs of $10,569.56 plus $2,500.00 for his time in court (3 days) are reasonable.Â  The parties have each paid him $1,500.00 leaving a balance of $10,069.00.Â  This should be paid $7,500.00 by [Father] and $2,569.00 by [Mother.]Â \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAlthough the language from the underlying order is strikingly similar to the language found insufficient in Lacke, the instant case can be distinguished.Â  It is clear from the order that the family court in the present case considered both partiesâ€™ faults in bringing about the action and their respective abilities to pay when denying attorneyâ€™s fees and apportioning the guardian ad litem fees according to a percentage of their respective incomes.Â  The record reflects that Father had a monthly income of $6,500, while Mother had a monthly income of $3,375, solely from alimony and child support. Â Further, Father had to initiate this action after Mother interfered with this visitation rights, and the family court found in Fatherâ€™s favor on several of the issues.Â  Although Mother claims she obtained some beneficial results from the suit, she was found in contempt for interfering with Fatherâ€™s visitation and visitation was modified.Â \r\n \r\nUnlike the order in Lacke, we can glean from both the order and the record in the present case that the family court considered the appropriate factors in denying Mother attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, we find the court did not abuse its discretion.\r\nII.&nbsp; Modification of Visitation \r\nMother contends the family court erred in modifying the visitation schedule.Â  Mother argues the modification was in error because: Â there was already a court-approved agreement regarding visitation filed less than two months before the present action was filed; the modified visitation was not in the childâ€™s best interest; the modification was not necessary or appropriate to resolve the partiesâ€™ visitation problems; and neither party requested such a modification in his/her pleadings.[2]Â  Mother argues that the only visitation problems raised at trial had to do with Fatherâ€™s failure to give notice of the weeks he chose to exercise visitation during the summer of 2003 and the partiesâ€™ conflicting interpretations of the appropriate location to transfer Son for visitation.Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œWhen awarding visitation, the controlling consideration is the welfare and best interest of the child.â€Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996).Â  Visitations orders are subject to continuing review and decisions regarding modification of visitation are also controlled by the best interest of the child.Â  King v. Gardner, 274 S.C. 493, 495, 265 S.E.2d 260, 262 (1980).Â  However, â€œ[w]hile visitation orders are subject to continuing review, a party may not receive relief not contemplated in the pleadings.â€Â  Aiken v. Aiken, 289 S.C. 370, 371, 345 S.E.2d 710, 711 (1986).Â  Decisions regarding visitation are left to the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Woodall, 322 S.C. at 12, 471 S.E.2d at 158.Â  \r\n \r\nAs a preliminary matter, it is clear that the family court had the authority to modify visitation because it was requested by both parties. Â Although Fatherâ€™s complaint focused primarily on modification of visitation so that Son could attend Fatherâ€™s wedding, Father also made the following general statement: Â â€œ[Father] brings this action for a modification of visitation, for Contempt, and for a determination of whether [Mother] is a fit and proper person to maintain custody of the partiesâ€™ minor child.â€Â  Mother also requested in her answer and counterclaim that the â€œamount of visitation to be exercised by [Father] should be reviewed.â€Â  Thus, because modification of visitation was generally requested by both parties in their pleadings, the family court had authority to modify visitation.Â  Aiken, 289 S.C. at 371, 345 S.E.2d at 711.Â  \r\n \r\nHowever, while the family court had the authority to modify visitation, some of the modifications went beyond the complaints at issue in the instant case.Â  We address Motherâ€™s individual complaints regarding the modification of visitation separately. \r\n \r\nA.Â  Additional Mid-Week Visitation \r\nThe visitation agreement incorporated into the partiesâ€™ final divorce decree stated that â€œOn the Tuesday prior to his scheduled visitation weekend, [Father] will be entitled to visitation on Tuesday from after school until 7:00 p.m.â€ Â The modified visitation order stated that on the Wednesday of the week following weekend visits, Father will pick Son up from school and return him to school the following morning.Â  The modification allowed Father a mid-week overnight visitation not previously agreed to by the parties.Â  \r\n \r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s decision to grant an additional overnight visitation.Â  One of the major issues at trial concerned the partiesâ€™ confrontations when exchanging Son.Â  This modification allows Father his mid-week visitation and allows the parties to avoid contact with one another. Â Â \r\nB.Â  Summer Visitation \r\nMother states in her brief that she agrees with the family courtâ€™s modification of summer visitation to outline the specific weeks that Father must exercise visitation.Â  However, she argues the court inadvertently failed to address how weekend visitation would be handled during the summer months.Â  Mother alleges that it is possible that Father would spend nearly sixty days with Son and Mother would only spend thirty days with Son if Father is still entitled to weekend visitation during the summer months.Â \r\n \r\nThe original visitation agreement stated that â€œ[Father] will be entitled to 3 additional weeks of visitation during the summer months of 2003 and thereafter, he will be entitled to 4 weeks of visitation during the summer months, to be exercised in 2 increments of 2 weeks each.â€Â  The agreement provided that Father could pick the dates for two of the weeks, that Mother could pick the dates for two of the weeks, and that both parties were to inform each other of the dates selected by April 15th of every year.Â  The original visitation agreement did not address how normal weekend visitation by Father would be handled during the summer months.Â  \r\n \r\nIn the underlying order, the family court modified visitation to provide that Father would have the child from noon Sunday until noon the following Sunday the second full week of June; the first and third full weeks of July; and the first week of August each summer.Â  The modifications allowed for the same amount of visitation during the summer as was provided in the original visitation agreement, but the modified visitation order specified the dates so as to reduce the disagreements between Father and Mother.Â  The order did not address how Fatherâ€™s normal weekend visitation would be handled during the summer months.Â  Motherâ€™s motion for reconsideration argued that Father had â€œno basis to complain about summer visitation, as it was outside the period of time contemplated by the change of custody and visitation action and, furthermore, [Father] failed to give proper notice as required by the Decree as to the weeks he chose to exercise.â€Â Â  \r\n \r\nIt is apparent that the family court was attempting to alleviate confrontations and communication problems between Father and Mother by setting precise dates for Fatherâ€™s summer visitation.Â  Mother concedes on appeal that she approves of setting the dates.Â  Her only complaint is regarding how weekend visitation will be handled.Â  However, it does not appear that the issue of how to address weekend visitation during the summer months was ever determined in the original visitation agreement or ruled upon by the family court in the underlying case.Â  Thus, the issue is not preserved for appellate review and we may not address it.Â  Bryant, 342 S.C. at 171-72, 536 S.E.2d at 387; Joubert, 341 S.C. at 184, 534 S.E.2d at 5.Â  Although the manner in which weekend visitation is exercised during the summer may substantially impact the amount of time Mother would be able to spend with Son, Mother is still free to seek modification of the order in the family court for clarification of this issue.Â  Â Â \r\nC.Â  Holiday Visitation \r\nMother argues in her brief that the family court erred in modifying the holiday visitation schedule because neither party complained about the holiday schedule and the modifications substantially impacted her familyâ€™s holiday traditions.Â  We agree.\r\n \r\nThe original visitation agreement provided that the parties would alternate the Spring Break/Easter and Thanksgiving holidays.Â  It also stated that: Â â€œ[Father] will be entitled to visitation during the Christmas holiday from 12:00 noon on the day after school is released for this holiday until 4:00 p.m. Christmas Eve, when [Son] shall be returned to [Motherâ€™s] home. Â [Mother] will then have continued possession until school resumes.â€Â  \r\n \r\nThe modified visitation order changed holiday visitation to grant Father visitation every Thanksgiving holiday.Â  The order also modified the Christmas holiday schedule by granting Father visitation on Christmas Eve from 4:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. Christmas Day until December 31 at 2:00 p.m.Â  The modified visitation order did not address which parent would have Son during the Spring Break/Easter holiday.Â  \r\n \r\nFatherâ€™s complaint did not address the holiday visitation schedule, and thus it was inequitable for the family court to modify holiday visitation.Â  The modified visitation significantly reduces the holidays Mother spends with Son, and it allows a significant portion of all holidays to be spent with Father.Â  Furthermore, the modified visitation failed to address how visitation during other holidays was to be divided between the parties.Â  Accordingly, the family court erred in modifying holiday visitation.Â  Holiday visitation shall revert to the visitation as specified in the original visitation agreement.Â  \r\n \r\nIII.&nbsp; Contempt\r\nMother contends the family court erred in finding her in contempt for denying Father visitation. Â We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nA finding of contempt rests within the sound discretion of the court.Â  Henderson v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1989).Â  â€œA trial courtâ€™s determination regarding contempt is subject to reversal where it is based on findings that are without evidentiary support or where there has been an abuse of discretion.â€ Â Henderson v. Puckett, 316 S.C. 171, 173, 447 S.E.2d 871, 872 (Ct. App. 1994). Â â€œEven though a party is found to have violated a court order, the question of whether or not to impose sanctions remains a matter for the courtâ€™s discretion.â€ Â Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 503, 597 S.E.2d 897, 900 (Ct. App. 2004). Â â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs either when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.â€ Â Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nâ€œThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to preservation of order in judicial proceedings.â€Â  In re Brown, 333 S.C. 414, 420, 511 S.E.2d 351, 355 (1998).Â  Contempt results from a partyâ€™s willful disobedience of a court order.Â  Smith v. Smith, 359 S.C. 393, 396, 597 S.E.2d 188, 189 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. 2006) (â€œAn adult who wilfully violates, neglects, or refuses to obey or perform a lawful order of the court . . . may be proceeded against for contempt of court.â€). Â â€œA willful act is one which is â€˜done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™â€ Â Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988)). Â â€œ[B]efore a court may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€ Â Widman, 348 S.C. at 119, 557 S.E.2d at 705.\r\nâ€œIn a proceeding for contempt for violation of a court order, the moving party must show the existence of a court order and the facts establishing the respondentâ€™s noncompliance with the order.â€Â  Hawkins, 359 S.C. at 501, 597 S.E.2d at 899.Â  â€œOnce the moving party has made out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish his or her defense and inability to comply with the order.â€Â  Widman, 348 S.C. at 120, 557 S.E.2d at 705.Â  Furthermore, it is generally recognized that â€œwhere a contemnor is unable, without fault on his part, to obey an order of the court, he is not to be held in contempt.â€Â  Hicks v. Hicks, 280 S.C. 378, 381, 312 S.E.2d 598, 599 (1984). \r\n \r\nThe original visitation agreement stated that â€œ[Fatherâ€™s] visitation will consist of every other weekend, from after school on Friday until Monday morning, when he will return [the child] directly to school.â€Â  The agreement further provided that:Â  â€œIn the event school is not in session, [Father] will pick up [the child] at the home at noon on Friday and will return him to his home on Monday at noon.â€Â  \r\n \r\nMother interpreted the language that Father would have Son â€œfrom after school,â€ to mean that Father should pick up Son from Motherâ€™s house and not pick up Son from school.Â  Thus, she believed that there was no interference with Fatherâ€™s visitation the times she picked Son up from school and took him home, despite the fact that Father and Bobbie were there to pick him up for weekend visitation.Â  The family court noted that the partiesâ€™ prior visitation practice and the spirit of the original visitation agreement meant that Father would pick Son up at school for weekend visitation.Â  The court held Mother in contempt for interfering with Fatherâ€™s visitation.Â Â  \r\n \r\nMother argues on appeal that the only way she could adequately supervise the pick-up of Son for visitation was to have the exchange at her home.Â  She now argues that the agreement does not allow pick-ups from school, and she has made Fatherâ€™s attempt to pick the child up at school very difficult.Â  We find a clear reading of the agreement means that Father should pick-up Son at school on days when school is in session.Â  Otherwise, there would be no need for arrangements for when school is not in session.Â  Furthermore, since the inception of the agreement, pick-ups have been done at the school.Â  By preventing Father from doing so, Mother has interfered with Fatherâ€™s visitation with Son.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in finding Mother in contempt for denying Father visitation.Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the family courtâ€™s finding that Mother should not be awarded attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We also affirm the family courtâ€™s finding that Mother be held in contempt for interfering with Fatherâ€™s visitation.Â  However, we reverse the family courtâ€™s modifications of visitation concerning holiday visitation, and the original visitation agreement concerning holiday visitation shall be reinstated.Â  The modifications made concerning after school pick-up and mid-week visitation are affirmed.Â  For the reasons stated herein, the family courtâ€™s decision is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.Â  \r\n\r\nHUFF, BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Mother also contends the family court erred in denying her Motion to Reconsider and in denying her request for a hearing on the motion.Â  However, this argument is merely conclusory and deals only with the issue of modification of visitation.Â  Therefore, it will be treated as raising the same issues discussed in this section.Â \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-316","title":"Williams v.

Williams, Appellant,\r\n          \r\n                  \r\n        v.\r\n        Otis David Gould, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal from Colleton County\r\nBenjamin Goldberg, Special Referee\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-316\r\n  Submitted June 1, 2007 â€“ Filed June 14,\r\n  2007Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Ronnie L. Crosby, of Hampton, for Appellant.\r\n        James D. Mosteller, III, of Barnwell and Robert J. Harte, of\r\n          Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this boundary dispute, James W. Williams appeals the special refereeâ€™s\r\n  determination that Williams and Otis David Gould acquiesced to the boundary\r\n  between their respective properties.Â  Williams argues on appeal that a dispute\r\n  or uncertainty as to the actual boundary line is required to support a finding\r\n  of acquiescence.Â  Because there is no such requirement under South Carolina\r\n  law, we affirm.\r\nI.\r\nIn\r\n  1961, Raymond M. Gatch granted to G.M. Gould (Father) certain real property\r\n  fronting the western bank of the Edisto River.Â  Father built a cabin on the\r\n  eastern portion of this property.Â  In 1976, Father deeded the western portion\r\n  to Dolphus and Betty G. Bridges.Â  Father retained the eastern portion (the\r\n  Gould Property) until 1990, when he granted it to his son, Otis David Gould.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1970, Dorothy Hadley received the property directly south of the Gould\r\n  Property.Â  In 1974, she deeded this tract to a church for which she acted as\r\n  trustee.Â  In 1993, James Williams obtained this property and subdivided it into\r\n  three tracts.[1]Â \r\n  Tract C (the Williams Property), containing 2.32 acres, now lies south of the\r\n  Gould Property.[2]Â  \r\nSometime\r\n  in the 1970s, Hadleyâ€™s husband dug a canal on the northern portion of the\r\n  Williams Property.Â  Several witnesses later testified the canal had been dug in\r\n  the early 1970s, but the record contains a 1976 plat with only a proposed\r\n  canal.Â  The 1976 plat shows the northern bank of the proposed canal as the\r\n  border between the Williams and Gould Properties.[3]Â  \r\nAfter the canal was finished, Father and Gould proceeded as if it\r\n  marked the boundary between the Williams and Gould Properties.Â  For instance,\r\n  Father and Gould built a fish cleaning table near the canal and installed a\r\n  septic tank in this area. Â Further, the cabin which Father and Gould used when\r\n  they visited the property encroached into the area that is now in dispute.Â  Finally,\r\n  Gould built a river wall up to the edge of the canal in 1992 or 1993.Â  Despite\r\n  Father and Gouldâ€™s continued use of the area in question, Williamsâ€™\r\n  predecessors-in-interest never complained.[4]\r\nIn\r\n  1999, Williams filed an action against Gould claiming he owned property north\r\n  of the canal upon which he asserted Gould had trespassed.Â  Gould denied these\r\n  allegations and claimed his and Williamsâ€™ predecessors in title acquiesced to\r\n  the northern bank of the canal as the border between the Gould and Williams\r\n  Properties.Â  The circuit court held a bench trial, ruled in favor of Williams,\r\n  and found no evidence supported Gouldâ€™s acquiescence defense.Â  In Williams\r\n    v. Gould, Op. No. 2003-UP-153 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 20, 2003), this\r\n  court held the circuit court committed an error of law in ruling no evidence of\r\n  acquiescence existed.Â  Accordingly, we remanded to the circuit court â€œfor\r\n  reconsideration of the acquiescence of title question in light of this\r\n  opinion.â€Â  \r\nOn\r\n  remand, the case was heard by a special referee.Â  At trial, Buddy Gatch\r\n  testified he witnessed Bill Hadley dig the canal between the Gould and Williams\r\n  Properties.Â  Gatch explained Hadley surveyed his northern boundary â€œto find out\r\n  where his line went so he would know where to start his canal, I would assume.â€\r\n  Â According to Gatch, the neighbors and Hadley agreed where to place the line.Â \r\n  Hadley thus placed a marker on a spot six or eight feet from the edge of the\r\n  canal.Â  The referee found Gould met his burden of proving boundary by\r\n  acquiescence.Â  After the referee denied Williamsâ€™ reconsideration motion, this\r\n  appeal followed.Â  \r\nII.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  boundary dispute, if it encompasses an issue of title, is an action at law.â€Â  Knox\r\n    v. Bogan, 322 S.C. 64, 66, 472 S.E.2d 43, 45&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996).Â  In an\r\n  action at law, tried without a jury, the judgeâ€™s factual findings will not be\r\n  disturbed unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports them.Â  Bodiford\r\n    v. Spanish Oak Farms, Inc., 317 S.C. 539, 544, 455 S.E.2d 194,\r\n  197&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).\r\nIII.\r\n Williams\r\n  contends the referee committed an error of law in finding a boundary by\r\n  acquiescence because uncertainty or dispute as to the actual boundary line is\r\n  required to support such a finding.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe common law doctrine of acquiescence occurs when adjacent\r\n  landowners mutually recognize and accept a clear line as the boundary between\r\n  their properties for a long period of time.Â  See 9 Powell on\r\n    Real Property Â§ 68.05(2) (2000); see\r\n      also Croft v. Sanders, 283 S.C. 507, 509, 323 S.E.2d 791, 792 (Ct. App. 1984) (â€œA\r\n  boundary line may be determined by mutual recognition of and acquiescence in a\r\n  particular line.â€)Â  â€œIt is well established that if landowners occupy their\r\n  respective premises up to a certain line which they mutually recognize and\r\n  acquiesce in for a long period of time . . . they are precluded from claiming\r\n  that the boundary line thus recognized and acquiesced in is not the true one.â€ Â Klapman v. Hook, 206 S.C. 51, 57, 32 S.E.2d 882, 884\r\n  (1945).Â  When a boundary line is\r\n  acquiesced to by adjoining landowners, the acquiescence â€œis binding on the\r\n  parties and their successors in interest.â€Â  12 Am. Jur. 2d Boundaries Â§\r\n  83 (1997).\r\nThe essence of Williamsâ€™ appeal is the claim that the doctrine of\r\n  acquiescence requires a showing of a dispute or uncertainty as to the true\r\n  property line.Â  The law, however, imposes no such requirement.Â  Evidence of a\r\n  dispute or uncertainty is not required in a case, such as this one, in which\r\n  acquiescence is established by the actions of adjoining landowners occupying\r\n  their respective properties up to a certain line over a long period of time.[5]Â  In Knox v. Bogan, 322 S.C.\r\n  64, 73, 472 S.E.2d 43, 49 (Ct. App. 1996), this court explained:\r\n\r\n  [W]here, as here, there has been a recognition by adjoining\r\n    property owners of a clearly defined line for a long period of time, there is\r\n    no requirement under South Carolina law that the plaintiff show an active\r\n    dispute or uncertainty as to the true line and a settlement of that dispute or\r\n    uncertainty by the parties as an element of proof of title by acquiescence.\r\n\r\nBased on this precedent, we hold the referee did not commit an\r\n  error of law in finding the parties acquiesced to the northern edge of the\r\n  canal as the boundary between the Gould and Williams Properties.Â  \r\nWe find Williamsâ€™ remaining arguments manifestly without merit.Â  Accordingly, we dispose of\r\n  them pursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR.Â  \r\nIV.\r\nEvidence\r\n  supports the refereeâ€™s finding that Gould established the affirmative defense\r\n  of acquiescence of title.Â  The judgment of the special referee is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Although this property was actually deeded to\r\n  Williams Farms Partnerships, Gould failed to object to Williams proceeding as\r\n  the real party in interest.Â  \r\n[2] Â Later, Williams further subdivided Tract C.Â  \r\n[3] Â Â Â However, Gene Whetsell, a registered land surveyor, testified 35 to\r\n  40 feet of riverfront property to the north of the canal belonged to the Williams Property.Â  Whetsell based\r\n  his conclusion on recorded deeds and plats in both Williamsâ€™ and Gouldâ€™s chain\r\n  of title.Â  \r\n[4]  The only evidence to the contrary is the\r\n  testimony of Roy Walker, who owned the Williams Property in 1982.Â  He attempted\r\n  to access the cabin because it was partially within the property description in\r\n  his deed.Â  He testified â€œsomebody put me out of itâ€ because â€œit was not my\r\n  building.â€Â  \r\n[5]  We note that even if a dispute or uncertainty were required, that\r\n  requirement is met here under our deferential scope of review.Â  Portions of\r\n  Gouldâ€™s testimony reflect some uncertainty about the true boundary line.Â  In\r\n  addition, both Gatchâ€™s testimony and the 1976 plat support inferences that\r\n  Hadley did not know where the true boundary line was located.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-317","title":"Peltier v.

Peltier, of Charleston, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Sandra J. Senn and Robin L. Jackson, of Charleston, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Brian\r\n  Peltier appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting Dr. Jobe Mettsâ€™ motion to\r\n  dismiss because Peltier failed to comply with the two-year statute of\r\n  limitations under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (2005).Â  We affirm. \r\nOn\r\n  September 25, 2002, Dr. Metts performed a lithotripsy procedure on Peltier.Â  At\r\n  the time, Dr. Metts worked at a satellite urology clinic for the Medical\r\n  University of South Carolina (â€œMUSCâ€).Â  On September 25, 2005, Peltier brought\r\n  this action against Dr. Metts, among others, alleging Dr. Metts negligently\r\n  performed the lithotripsy procedure.Â  Dr. Metts moved the circuit court to\r\n  dismiss Peltierâ€™s action against him because it exceeded the two-year statute\r\n  of limitations under the Tort Claims Act.Â  The circuit court agreed, and\r\n  dismissed Peltierâ€™s action.Â  Peltier appeals. \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Peltier argues the circuit court erred in dismissing his action for\r\n  failing to file and serve it within the applicable statute of limitations.Â \r\n  Peltier also asserts the circuit court erred in refusing to allow him to\r\n  proceed to discovery.Â  While we recognize Peltierâ€™s position, the record\r\n  establishes to the exacting summary judgment standard that Dr. Metts worked for\r\n  MUSC, a government entity under the Tort Claims Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-78-30(d) (2005); Tatum v. Med. Univ. of S.C., 346 S.C. 194, 199, 552\r\n  S.E.2d 18, 21 (2001) (â€œMUSC is a governmental agency subject to the provisions\r\n  of the Tort Claims Act.â€).Â  Accordingly, absent a verified claimâ€”which Peltier\r\n  did not fileâ€”Peltier had two years to bring his action against MUSC.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-78-110; see also Joubert v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 341\r\n  S.C. 176, 186, 534 S.E.2d 1, 6 (Ct.

Creson, of Augusta, for Respondent.\r\n        Paige Weeks Johnson, of Aiken, Guardian Ad Litem.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Michael\r\n  Kelley filed this divorce action against Debra Kelley. Â The family court\r\n  awarded custody of the partiesâ€™ two minor children to wife. Â Husband appeals.Â \r\n  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties were married when both were\r\n  residents of California. Â They had two sons, Sean (12) and Joshua (11).Â  The\r\n  parties remained in California until husbandâ€™s business failed, and the parties\r\n  declared bankruptcy. Â The parties decided to move to Aiken, South Carolina,\r\n  where husband intended to start a business with his father.Â  In June 2001,\r\n  husband and the children left California for Aiken.Â  Wife remained behind to\r\n  assist her family, intending to follow in a few weeks. Â During several\r\n  telephone calls prior to wifeâ€™s move, husband dissuaded her from joining them because\r\n  the house he was renovating for the family was not complete.Â  Husband and\r\n  children lived with husbandâ€™s parents during the renovation. Â Wife testified\r\n  that despite husbandâ€™s continued dissuasion, she traveled to Aiken in August.Â \r\n  While in Aiken, husband refused to move into an apartment while the house was being\r\n  completed, stalled wife when she attempted to get a South Carolina driverâ€™s\r\n  license, was reluctant to add her to their automobile insurance, and limited\r\n  her access to the partiesâ€™ vehicle.Â  Husband told the wife it was â€œtoo crampedâ€\r\n  at his parentsâ€™ home, and wife returned to California to await completion of\r\n  the house.Â  During the next few months, husband continually discouraged wife\r\n  from returning.Â  Again, despite his attitude, she arrived in Aiken in early\r\n  December, and the parties moved into the marital home.Â  \r\nIn February 2002, wife returned to California for gastric bypass\r\n  surgery, which would have been prohibitively expensive in Aiken due to the\r\n  partiesâ€™ insurance coverage.Â  Without her knowledge, husband filed an action\r\n  for separate support and maintenance seeking, inter alia, custody of the\r\n  children.Â  A week before wife was scheduled to return to Aiken, husband called\r\n  and ordered her to live with his parents upon her return to Aiken.Â  Husband\r\n  threatened to limit her visitation with the children to his parentsâ€™ home\r\n  during the hours after school until he returned home from work.Â  Wife sought\r\n  advice of counsel in California and learned of the pending action for divorce\r\n  in South Carolina.Â  Wife filed for divorce in California.Â  The children\r\n  remained in Aiken with husband.Â  \r\nNumerous school witnesses testified wife remained very involved\r\n  with the children, whereas husband was very controlling and had difficulties\r\n  with anger management.Â  For instance, the school was piloting an â€œall studentsâ€\r\n  breakfast program.Â  Husband did not want the children to participate and\r\n  brought them to school late.Â  The school pursued the matter, as the children\r\n  were missing instruction time in addition to breakfast.Â  Husband consented to\r\n  adhering to the time, but refused to allow them to eat with the rest of the\r\n  class.Â  Husband forbade the children from attending field trips, argued with a\r\n  teacher about providing a particular type of composition book, required notice\r\n  before the children could see the school nurse, omitted virtually all required\r\n  personal information during registration, and sent the children to school\r\n  without proper clothing.Â  When the children brought fundraising material home\r\n  from school, the husband â€œwadded it up and sent it backâ€ saying â€œhe sent his\r\n  children to school to learn and not to raise money for the school.â€Â  Seanâ€™s\r\n  third-grade teacher explained: Â â€œIt seemed like everything was an issue with\r\n  him.Â  That was negative and hard to fit and hard to do.Â  Just I had a really\r\n  hard time with him.â€Â  She described a class science project of planting seeds.Â \r\n  Sean was not permitted to water his seeds with school water, but had to bring\r\n  water from home.Â  Husband also forbade the school from teaching his children\r\n  that drugs and guns were bad.Â  Seanâ€™s teacher felt that the communication with husband\r\n  was so poor, she would not notify him of anything for fear Sean would be\r\n  severely punished.Â  In a similar vein, wifeâ€™s mother testified that husband was\r\n  quick to anger and spanked the children with â€œforce [that] was extremely hard.â€ \r\nPrior\r\n  to the move to Aiken, wife was the primary caretaker. Â While in California after the family move, wife communicated with the principal, teachers, and Sean\r\n  by letters and e-mail.Â  When in Aiken, wife and her mother visited the school.Â \r\n  She notified Joshuaâ€™s teacher about his birthday and explained that, although\r\n  she did not have access to a vehicle, she wanted to provide cupcakes for the\r\n  class.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court in Aiken held a temporary hearing in June 2002, as a result of\r\n  which it awarded husband temporary custody and appointed a guardian ad litem.Â  Three\r\n  additional hearings were held over the course of the summer of 2003, and the\r\n  guardian ad litem submitted her report.Â  The guardian testified she interviewed\r\n  over twenty individuals in preparing her report and testimony.Â  Her concerns\r\n  about husband related to his temper, controlling behavior, some indications of\r\n  depression, and the overall effects upon his ability to parent.Â  She was also\r\n  concerned about husbandâ€™s alleged cruelty to animals, particularly in view of\r\n  the fact the cruelty was committed in the presence of the children.Â  She\r\n  concluded that it was in the best interest of Joshua and Sean to live with wife\r\n  in California.Â  \r\nFollowing the three hearings during the summer of 2003 and after\r\n  the submission of the guardianâ€™s report, the court issued a supplemental\r\n  temporary order transferring custody of the children to wife and limiting husbandâ€™s\r\n  visitation.Â  The final hearing was held in November 2003, after which the court\r\n  took the matter under advisement due to the voluminous record.Â  In its final\r\n  order, issued on May 25, 2004, the court granted the parties a divorce and\r\n  awarded custody of the children to wife.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family courtÂ This broad\r\n  scope of review, however, does not relieve the appellant of the burden of\r\n  convincing us that the family court committed\r\n  error.Â  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892\r\n  (1979). Â Nor are we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw\r\n  and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility\r\n  and assign comparative weight to their testimonies.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson,\r\n  276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nHusband argues the\r\n  family court violated his rights to due process by failing to issue the final\r\n  order within thirty days.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 26(c), SCRFC\r\nThe South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Family Court provide:Â  â€œExcept under exceptional circumstances, an order in\r\n  a domestic relations case shall be issued as soon as possible after the\r\n  hearing, but not later than 30 days thereafter.â€Â  Rule 26(c), SCRFC.Â  The\r\n  family court did not issue an order until more than six months after the conclusion\r\n  of the hearing in this case. Â We can understand husbandâ€™s angst because of the\r\n  delay in the final order.Â  However, this case was more difficult than the\r\n  ordinary case, requiring four days of testimony.Â  The court informed the\r\n  parties at the conclusion of the final day of hearings that due to the volume\r\n  of evidence and the necessity of the court reviewing it carefully it was\r\n  unlikely that a final order would comply with the mandate of Rule 26(c).Â  Additionally,\r\n  the final order itself consists of fourteen pages, and was obviously carefully\r\n  crafted, particularly as it relates to husbandâ€™s visitation privileges.Â  The delay\r\n  in filing and serving the final order resulted in little or no prejudice to\r\n  husband.Â  See Matter of Price, 277 S.C. 169, 170, 284 S.E.2d 356,\r\n  356 (1981) (finding denial of motion to dismiss for failure to comply with\r\n  Rules of Family Court prescribing maximum forty day period between filing of\r\n  petition against minor and adjudicatory hearing not reversible where no\r\n  material prejudice).\r\nCustody\r\nHusband also argues\r\n  the family court erred in granting custody of the children to wife.[2]Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\n In reviewing a\r\n  family court order awarding custody, â€œ[w]e are â€˜guided by several principles.â€™â€Â  Davis v. Davis, 356 S.C. 132, 135, 588 S.E.2d 102, 103 (2003).Â \r\n  â€œFirst, an\r\n  appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Id.Â Second, the appellate court need not disregard the family\r\n  courtâ€™s findings or ignore the fact the family court judge observed the\r\n  witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility. Â â€œThis\r\n  degree of deference is â€˜especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of children.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Dixon v. Dixon,\r\n  336 S.C. 260, 262-63, 519 S.E.2d 357, 358-59 (Ct. App. 1999)). Â â€œThird, â€˜[t]he welfare of the child and what is in his/her best interest is the primary, paramount and controlling consideration of the court in all child custody controversies.â€™â€Â  Id. at 135, 588 S.E.2d\r\n  at 103-104 (quoting Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614\r\n  (1978)).\r\nThe family court\r\n  temporarily awarded custody to wife after the first three days of testimony on\r\n  May 28, 2003, July 28, 2003, and August 5, 2003. Â The court expressed concern\r\n  that school was about to begin, and the children needed stability for the\r\n  upcoming year. Â At that time, most of the partiesâ€™ witnesses had testified,\r\n  including a counselor, numerous teachers and school officials, and husband.Â  The\r\n  guardian had submitted a detailed report and actively participated in the\r\n  hearings. Â The only remaining witnesses were the guardian and wife. Â The\r\n  guardianâ€™s initial report favored custody with wife.Â  The school officials and\r\n  guardian indicated husband suffered from anger and control issues, and the\r\n  court temporarily suspended husbandâ€™s visitation. Â The guardian testified the\r\n  final day, stating the children seemed to be faring well in California, and her\r\n  opinion had not changed. \r\nThe court stated it\r\n  had â€œnever heard teachers and school officials who were as emphatic as\r\n  witnesses.â€Â  The court considered the many confrontations between husband and\r\n  school personnel in which husband expressed dissatisfaction with school policy\r\n  involving the children. Â The court also noted that even after two years, the\r\n  children had few friends in Aiken.Â  Finally, the court considered the\r\n  guardianâ€™s experience, qualifications, and conclusions.Â  The court ordered\r\n  custody to remain with wife in California, and required husband to complete\r\n  anger management and parenting skills classes prior to receiving unsupervised\r\n  visitation.Â  After review of the record, we find no error.Â  The courtâ€™s\r\n  paramount concern in determining custody issues is to protect the best interest\r\n  of the children.Â  The preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that it is in\r\n  the childrenâ€™s best interest to be with wife.\r\nGuardian ad litem Fees\r\nHusband\r\n  finally argues the guardian failed to be impartial and submitted exorbitant\r\n  fees.Â  We find no reversible error. \r\nThe guardianâ€™s\r\n  report listed over twenty individuals she had interviewed and her supplemental\r\n  report included follow-up with the childrenâ€™s California counselor.Â  One of the\r\n  primary functions of a guardian, in a case of this type, is to make\r\n  recommendations to the court as to custody and other issues.Â  Just because a\r\n  guardian comes down on the side of one party or the other does not, in and of\r\n  itself, indicate a lack of impartiality.Â  As an indication of the guardianâ€™s\r\n  impartiality, she recommended a consultant to perform testing who thereafter\r\n  disagreed with her by indicating he thought custody should remain with\r\n  husband.Â  The guardian concluded both parents loved the children and were able\r\n  to meet their basic physical needs.Â  We find no evidence the guardian failed to\r\n  exercise independent, impartial judgment. \r\nWe likewise find\r\n  support in the record justifying the guardianâ€™s fees.Â  An award of guardian\r\n  fees is within the discretion of the family court.Â  Shirley v. Shirley, 342\r\n  S.C. 324, 341, 536 S.E.2d 427, 436 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The court ordered each\r\n  party to pay one-half of the guardianâ€™s total fees of $7,071.36.Â  We find the\r\n  guardian expended a substantial amount of time in interviewing witnesses and\r\n  preparing for and participating in the hearings. Â The fees are reasonable considering the complexities\r\n  of the case.Â  Accordingly, we find no error.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] We consolidate several of husbandâ€™s issues on appeal.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-325","title":"Allegiant v.

[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn January 14, 2003, White and C. Allan\r\n  Peterson, doing business as Emerald Inns, Inc, (Defendants) entered into an\r\n  agreement to lease from Allegiant furnishings and equipment for use in the\r\n  operation of a hotel.Â  The cash sale price of the goods leased was $67,698.17.Â \r\n  Emerald Inns, White, and Peterson agreed to make lease payments in the amount\r\n  of $1,461.81 per month plus applicable sales tax for 60 months, beginning on\r\n  June 1, 2003.Â  The Defendants made the last payment on April 27, 2004.Â  \r\nOn July 27, 2004, Allegiant brought this\r\n  action for breach of the lease seeking immediate and permanent possession of\r\n  the leased good together with any deficiency remaining after a commercially\r\n  reasonable sale of the goods with interest thereon, judgment against Emerald\r\n  Inns, White, and Peterson for value of the goods, including depreciation and\r\n  pre-judgment interest, and for â€œactual, consequential, and punitive damagesâ€\r\n  arising out of the breach of the lease agreement.Â  Allegiant also sought\r\n  damages against Emerald Inns and Peterson for breach of a carpet purchase\r\n  agreement.Â  White was not a guarantor under that agreement.Â  White answered the\r\n  complaint denying most of the allegations, while Peterson was in default.\r\nThe trial court granted Allegiant summary judgment as to liability\r\n  as to the lease agreement against all of the defendants and on the carpet\r\n  agreement against Emerald Inns and Peterson.Â  However it held the issue of\r\n  damages for both agreements in abeyance pending recovery and disposition of the\r\n  goods that were the subject of the lease agreement.Â  Allegiant took inventory\r\n  of the goods remaining at the hotel and sold them to the new owner of the hotel\r\n  for $5000.00.Â  \r\nAllegiant\r\n  subsequently filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment seeking\r\n  acceleration of all of the payments due under the lease reduced by the amount\r\n  received from the sale of the remaining goods, as well as attorneyâ€™s fees and\r\n  costs.Â  White filed an affidavit asserting the indebtedness was not simply a\r\n  total of all of the rent payments past due and to be become due in the future,\r\n  but rather the amounts of unpaid rent due at the date of the default plus the\r\n  present value of the remaining payments.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the language of the lease allowing Allegiant\r\n  a variety of remedies available â€œunder this agreement or otherwise . . .â€\r\n  allowed it to claim as damages the aggregate of all of the payments that would\r\n  have become due under the lease.Â  In addition, the trial court found that since\r\n  White submitted his affidavit disputing damages less than five days prior to\r\n  the hearing, his request for a damages hearing was not timely and was therefore\r\n  denied.Â  The court awarded Allegiant judgment in the amount of $66,320.60\r\n  against Emerald Inns, White, and Peterson as well as $3200.00 in attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees and $376.66 in costs for a total of $66,320.60.Â  The court also added\r\n  $376.66 in costs to the judgment awarded under the carpet agreement for a total\r\n  judgment against Emerald Inns and Peterson of $30,861.94.Â  The court\r\n  subsequently denied Whiteâ€™s motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Request for\r\n  damages hearing\r\nWhite argues the trial court erred in holding he was obligated to\r\n  request a damages hearing and that, by failing to request such a hearing, he\r\n  waived the right to the hearing.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe burden for proving damages for breach of contract rests on the\r\n  plaintiff.Â  Depositions And . . . Inc. v. Campbell, 305 S.C. 173, 175, 406\r\n  S.E.2d 390, 391 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Furthermore, the party seeking summary\r\n  judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue\r\n  of material fact.Â  McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C.\r\n  372, 376, 597 S.E.2d 181, 183 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP, provides the\r\n  party opposing summary judgment may serve affidavits â€œnot later than two days before the hearing.â€ Â (Emphasis added).\r\nWhite executed his affidavit opposing summary judgment on February\r\n  17, 2004.Â  The hearing was held on February 21, 2006.Â  Thus, Whiteâ€™s affidavit\r\n  was timely under Rule 56(c).Â  We find no provision in the South Carolina Rules\r\n  of Civil Procedure to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling that a defendant is\r\n  barred from receiving a hearing on damages because he failed to file his\r\n  affidavit more than five days before the hearing.Â  According, we hold\r\n  the trial court erred in finding White was not entitled to challenge\r\n  Allegiantâ€™s claimed damages.Â  \r\nII.Â  Amount of\r\n  damages\r\nWhite argues the trial court erred in its calculation of damages.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nThe Remedies section of the lease agreement provides:Â  â€œIf an\r\n  event of default occurs, Lessor is entitled to exercise in any order any one or\r\n  more of the following remedies and the exercise of any one or more of such\r\n  remedies shall not preclude Lessor from any other remedies available to Lessor\r\n  under this Agreement or otherwise: . . . .â€Â  The section then lists a number of\r\n  remedies.Â  Emphasizing the phrase, â€œunder this agreement or otherwise: . . . ,â€\r\n  the trial court found â€œunder the clear terms of this statement, [Allegiant] as\r\n  Lessor, may seek relief through a variety of remedies, including those\r\n  available under statutory and common law.â€Â  \r\nAlthough the lease agreement allowed Allegiant a wide variety of\r\n  remedies, the damages awarded must still be within those allowed by contract\r\n  law.Â  â€œIn a breach of contract action, damages serve to place the nonbreaching\r\n  party in the position he would have enjoyed had the contract been performed.â€Â  South Carolina Fed. Sav. Bank v. Thornton-Crosby Dev. Co., 303 S.C. 74, 77,\r\n  399 S.E.2d 8, 10 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  The measure of damages is â€œthe loss actually\r\n  suffered by the contractee as the result of the breach.â€ Â Collins Holding\r\n    Co. v. Landrum, 360 S.C. 346, 350, 601 S.E.2d 332, 333-34 (2004). \r\n\r\n  Damages will be computed as of the date fixed for performance,\r\n    because a court does not treat the contract as though it contained a promise to\r\n    render performance as of the date of the repudiation.Â  Thus the damages for the\r\n    repudiation of a contract are to be computed as of the date when performance is\r\n    due, and not as of the date of the prior repudiation.Â  This amount must be\r\n    reduced to its present value.Â  Judgment should be rendered for all accrued\r\n    payments plus interest, plus the present value of all unaccrued payments the\r\n    plaintiff would have received if the contract had been performed. Â \r\n\r\n22 Am.Jur.2d Damages Â§63 (2003).Â  \r\nWe hold\r\n  the trial court erred in granting Allegiant the aggregate of all payments past\r\n  due and due in the future.Â  The correct measure of damages would include the balance\r\n  due at the time of the default plus the present value of all unaccrued payments\r\n  at the time of the default.Â  Accordingly, we remand the case to the trial court\r\n  for a damages hearing.Â Â  Â \r\nIII. Â Â Â  Award of\r\n  costs\r\nWhite argues the trial court erred in adding costs of $376.66 to\r\n  both of Allegiantâ€™s judgments.Â  \r\nInitially\r\n  Allegiant contends this issue is not preserved because the parties agreed to\r\n  the apportionment of attorneyâ€™s fees and White did not object to the award of\r\n  costs and did not seek apportionment of costs between the two judgments. Â In\r\n  our review of the record, we find the partiesâ€™ agreement involved only the\r\n  apportionment of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In his motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment, White objected to the award of costs, sufficiently raising the issue\r\n  to the trial court and preserving it for our review.Â  See Godfrey v.\r\n    Heller, 311 S.C. 516, 520, 429 S.E.2d 859, 862 (Ct. App. 1993) (stating\r\n  that where an appellant learns for the first time when the appellant receives\r\n  the order that the respondent would be granted certain relief, the appellant\r\n  must move, pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment to\r\n  preserve the issue).Â Â  \r\nWhite\r\n  contends the issue of costs was not raised at the hearing.Â  However, in its\r\n  complaint Allegiant requested costs and its attorney stated in his affidavit\r\n  that Allegiant had incurred costs in the amount of $376.66.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  issue of costs was properly before the trial court.Â  However, we agree with\r\n  Allegiant that the trial court erred in adding an award of costs of $376.66 to\r\n  both the judgment on the lease agreement and the judgment on the carpet\r\n  agreement.Â  The trial court found Allegiant had incurred costs of $376.66 and\r\n  that this amount was reasonable.Â  By adding this amount to both judgments, the\r\n  trial court in fact awarded Allegiant costs in the amount $753.32.Â  Thus, we\r\n  remand the issue of costs to the trial court.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order of the trial court is reversed\r\n  and the issues of the amount of damages and the awarding of costs are\r\n  remanded.Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n  and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ. concur.Â \r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-326","title":"South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control v.

Harness, III, of Mount Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\n        Van Whitehead, of North Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Shane Gould appeals the administrative\r\n  law judgeâ€™s (ALJ) order requiring relocation of a covered pierhead in a permit\r\n  revocation action initiated by the South Carolina Department of Health and\r\n  Environmental Control (DHEC).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nGould\r\n  resides and owns a house at 29 Sea Olive Road on Hilton Head Island, adjacent\r\n  to Point Comfort Creek. Â He applied for a dock permit in November 2001, which\r\n  was granted on December 19, 2001. Â Based on Gouldâ€™s permit application, all\r\n  parts of the dock were to be built at least twenty feet inside his extended\r\n  property line.Â  Gould began building the dock in 2003.Â  \r\nContemporaneously\r\n  with construction of the dock, Margaret Maxwell, Gouldâ€™s neighbor, complained\r\n  that the dock crossed the extended property line separating her property from\r\n  Gouldâ€™s.Â  Indeed, as completed, the dockâ€™s roofed pierhead and a floating dock\r\n  crossed the extended property line separating the properties.Â  Maxwell\r\n  continued to complain to the Office of Ocean and Resource Management (OCRM) and\r\n  government officials about the dockâ€™s placement, the resulting obstruction of\r\n  her view, and her access to the creek. Â \r\nBased\r\n  upon her complaints, OCRM reviewed the permit and discovered the inaccuracy of\r\n  the submitted application.Â  OCRM instituted an enforcement action in 2004, but\r\n  instead proceeded with this revocation action.[1]Â \r\n  In the action, OCRM sought to revoke Gouldâ€™s permit based on the material\r\n  inaccuracy of the drawings, as well as to require him to submit a new permit\r\n  application with new drawings.Â  However, OCRM did not seek to require Gould to\r\n  alter the dock in the interim.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the pendency of this action, Gould agreed to move his floating dock to the\r\n  other side of the pierhead onto his side of the extended property line.Â  However,\r\n  he did not agree to move the roofed pierhead, which remained across the line\r\n  separating his property from Maxwellâ€™s.\r\nThe ALJ\r\n  found that after Gouldâ€™s floating dock was moved, the only material harm would\r\n  be the impact on Maxwellâ€™s view. Â Accordingly, the ALJ found this matter could\r\n  be solved without revoking the existing permit and requiring a new application.Â \r\n  Thus, the ALJ ordered modification of the existing permit such that (1) the\r\n  gangway and float be moved to the opposite side of the pierhead, and (2) any\r\n  portion of the pierhead roof lying over the extended property lines be removed.Â \r\n  He further required that the new location of the floating dock be approved by\r\n  OCRM consistent with his order, and any partial removal of the roofing be\r\n  approved by OCRM.Â  Gould Appeals.Â  DHEC did not file a brief.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  appellate court may reverse or modify an administrative decision if such\r\n  decision is affected by errors of law, characterized by an abuse of discretion,\r\n  or clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Professional\r\n    Samplers, Inc. v. South Carolina Employment Sec. Comâ€™n, 334 S.C. 392, 395,\r\n  513 S.E.2d 374, 376 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œSubstantial evidenceâ€ is not a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the\r\n  case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in\r\n  order to justify its action.Â  Hull v. Spartanburg Co. Assessor, 372\r\n  S.C. 420, 641 S.E.2d 909, 911 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  The appellate court may not\r\n  substitute its judgment for that of an agency as to the weight of evidence on\r\n  questions of fact.Â  Grant v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 319 S.C.\r\n  348, 353, 461 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1995).Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal Authority to Order\r\n  Removal of the Pierhead-Roof\r\nGould argues that\r\n  the ALJ lacked legal authority to order the removal of the portion of the\r\n  pierhead roof that crosses the extended property lines. Â Specifically, he\r\n  argues because the roof removal was not agreed to by the parties, and because\r\n  OCRM did not request this relief or make any general prayer for relief, there\r\n  is no basis for that portion of the order. Â We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  issue is not preserved for appellate review. Â During examination of the trialâ€™s\r\n  first witness, the ALJ asked the parties: \r\n\r\n  In\r\n    light of the tenure that this case comes before me, do I have the authority to\r\n    if I find in (sic) fitting with the facts to amend the permit and to allow the\r\n    permit of the dock crossing the extended property line within my authority to\r\n    modify?Â  \r\n\r\nCounsel for OCRM answered in the\r\n  affirmative and Gould made no response.Â  The ALJ further noted â€œWell, I just\r\n  wanted to ask that to let both parties know what I may be thinking about and so\r\n  you can ask your questions accordingly.â€Â  Again, Gould did not object or\r\n  respond.Â  At the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ stated that â€œa proper\r\n  resolution to this case would be to modify the permit and require that . . .\r\n  that no dock or anything else extend beyond the extended property line from that\r\n  point on,â€ notifying the parties that the hearing would be adjourned other than\r\n  any response to that proposed resolution.Â  Gould again made no objection or\r\n  argument in response.Â  By failing to object to the ALJâ€™s comments, Gould waived\r\n  any objection he may have raised to the remedy granted.Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP, (â€œWhen\r\n  issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of\r\n  the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised\r\n  in the pleadings.â€); Andrews v. von Elten &amp; Walker, Inc., 315 S.C.\r\n  199, 202, 432 S.E.2d 500, 502, (Ct. App. 1993) (holding an issue that was\r\n  discussed extensively at trial without objection was tried by consent of the\r\n  parties).\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we note Gouldâ€™s position at trial was markedly contrary to his position on\r\n  appeal.Â  Gould argued before the ALJ that an enforcement action was the proper\r\n  means for OCRM to address Gouldâ€™s dock permit issue, rather than a revocation\r\n  action.Â  As Gould apparently acknowledges in his brief, in an enforcement\r\n  action for a permit violation, modification and removal are proper remedies.Â  See South Carolina Coastal Council v. Vogel, 292 S.C. 449, 357 S.E.2d 187\r\n  (1987) (affirming a removal order of an illegally constructed dock); Brownlee\r\n    v. Dept. of Health and Env. Control, 372 S.C. 119, 641 S.E.2d 45, 46 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007) (discussing an enforcement action by the predecessor to OCRM in\r\n  response to a dock that, having been built not in compliance with the issued\r\n  permit, had been subject to an administrative order to relocate the pierhead\r\n  and walkway).Â  Thus, in effect, Gould now appeals the ALJâ€™s enforcement-like\r\n  resolution of this matter, after arguing enforcement was the proper form for\r\n  this action in the first place.Â  â€œIt is well settled that one cannot present\r\n  and try his case on one theory and then change his theory on appeal.â€Â  Gurganious\r\n    v. City of Beaufort, 317 S.C. 481, 488, 454 S.E.2d 912, 916 (Ct. App.\r\n  1995).Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  Gould raised no objection when the ALJ stated his intent to modify the permit\r\n  rather than revoke it, and because of the inconsistency of his arguments on\r\n  appeal and before the ALJ, we find this issue not preserved for appellate review.Â \r\n  Therefore, we find no error in the ALJâ€™s order. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the ALJâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] Maxwell was denied the right to intervene on October\r\n  18, 2005.Â  She did not appeal from this decision.Â  Although it is unclear from\r\n  the record, it appears that Maxwellâ€™s intervenor status was denied while this\r\n  action was still in the posture of an enforcement action. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-327","title":"Suber v.

Suber, of Ridgeville, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n          General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General Karen Ratigan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Raphael\r\n  Suber filed a habeas corpus petition in Greenville County.Â  The lower court\r\n  dismissed Suberâ€™s petition, and this appeal follows.Â  We affirm. Â \r\nFACTS\r\nRaphael Suber was indicted for possession\r\n  with intent to distribute crack cocaine within the proximity of a school,\r\n  trafficking crack cocaine, and possession of a weapon during the commission of\r\n  a violent crime.Â  Suber pled guilty to trafficking crack cocaine and possession\r\n  of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime and received concurrent\r\n  imprisonment terms of twenty five and five years respectively for the offenses.Â  \r\nSuber\r\n  did not appeal his sentence but filed an application for post conviction relief\r\n  (PCR) in Greenville County.Â  In the application, Suber alleged ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel and that his plea was not voluntary.Â  Following an\r\n  evidentiary hearing, the lower court dismissed Suberâ€™s application.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  Suber appealed this dismissal by filing a writ of certiorari with the South\r\n  Carolina Supreme Court, which was denied.Â  Approximately three years later,\r\n  Suber filed a habeas corpus petition in a Greenville County court.Â  The lower\r\n  court dismissed the habeas petition.Â  This appeal follows. Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nThe function of a habeas\r\n  corpus writ is to test the legality of a prisonerâ€™s imprisonment.Â  Gibson v.\r\n    State, 329 S.C. 37, 40, 495 S.E.2d 426, 427 (1998).Â  Habeas corpus is\r\n  obtainable only if other remedies, such as PCR, are inadequate or unavailable.Â  Id.Â  at 41, 495 S.E.2d at 428.Â  Any matter which is recognizable under\r\n  the Uniform Post Conviction Act[1] (the Act) must be raised in a PCR application and may not be raised in a habeas\r\n  petition.Â  Simpson v. State, 329 S.C. 43, 46, 495 S.E.2d 429, 431\r\n  (1998). Â Â \r\nThus,\r\n  an individual is procedurally barred from relying on a habeas petition when the\r\n  matter alleged is such that it could have been raised in a PCR proceeding.Â  Keeler\r\n    v. Mauney, 330 S.C. 568, 571, 500 S.E.2d 123, 124 (Ct. App. 1998).Â \r\n  Consequently, if an individual is procedurally barred, his or her only remedy\r\n  lies in filing the habeas petition with the South Carolina Supreme Court.Â  Id.\r\nOn appeal, Suber\r\n  states the lower court erred in denying habeas relief because his trial counsel\r\n  was ineffective.[2]Â \r\n  However, ineffectiveness of counsel is an issue that can only be asserted in\r\n  proceedings under the Act.Â  State v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 287, 350\r\n  S.E.2d 180, 184 (1986). Â Therefore, Suber is procedurally barred from filing a\r\n  writ of habeas corpus in the lower court. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the lower courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[3]Â  \r\nSTILWELL,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â \r\n  \r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-10 to 17-27-160 (2003). \r\n[2] As grounds for relief in his habeas petition to the\r\n  lower court, Suber argued the lower court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to\r\n  accept his guilty plea and ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  However, on\r\n  appeal Suber assigns error only to the ineffective assistance claim and does\r\n  not assert the subject matter claim. Â Because the subject matter issue was not\r\n  appealed we do not address it.Â  State v.

Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHasseini purchased commercial property from Melvin Hamilton in 1999. Â Hasseini believed the property could be connected to water and sewer service via lines running in front of the property.Â  In January 2000, he discovered that was not the case and shortly thereafter filed suit against Hamilton and other parties, including both the real estate agency and agent.Â \r\n \r\nHasseini did not know Hamiltonâ€™s address, although documents from the transaction showed Hamiltonâ€™s forwarding address as that of the commercial property itself (â€œ3729 Ashley Phosphate NCâ€) and â€œJohn C. Calhoun Apt NC.â€ Â Hasseini delivered four copies of the summons and complaint to the Dorchester County Sheriff on May 14, 2002 for service on Hamilton and other defendants.Â  He made periodic checks with the Sheriffâ€™s office regarding the status of service on Hamilton and was told â€œthey were working on it.â€Â  In October 2003, during a deposition, the real estate agent indicated he had some knowledge as to Hamiltonâ€™s location.Â  Hamilton was ultimately served by a private process server on February 23, 2004. Â \r\nSheriffâ€™s office employees testified they had no record of a summons and complaint being delivered for service upon Hamilton.Â  However, the Sheriffâ€™s office did have records showing that pleadings for both the real estate agent and agency were left with the office and service was actually accomplished as to these defendants.Â  \r\n \r\nHamilton moved for summary judgment, arguing the statute of limitations had run on Hasseiniâ€™s claims by the time he was served. Â The master concluded that service was not effected upon Hamilton within a reasonable time after the summons and complaint were delivered to the Sheriff, and therefore the statute of limitations was not tolled.Â  Consequently, Hasseiniâ€™s case against Hamilton was dismissed.Â \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe master found that Hasseiniâ€™s claim accrued in January 2000 when he discovered there was no access to sewer lines from the property.Â  Therefore, the applicable rule governing service was the rule in effect at that time.Â  See Bergstrom v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 358 S.C. 388, 397, 596 S.E.2d 42, 46-47 (2004) (quoting Stephens v. Draffin, 327 S.C. 1, 5, 488 S.E.2d 307, 309 (1997)) (â€œIn South Carolina, the law in effect at the time the cause of action accrued controls the partiesâ€™ legal relationships and rights.â€).Â  At that time, Rule 3(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provided for the tolling of the statute of limitations when the summons and complaint were delivered to the sheriff for service, provided actual service was then made within a reasonable time.[2]Â  See Hughes v. Water World Water Slide, Inc., 314 S.C. 211, 215, 442 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1994); Montgomery v. Mullins, 325 S.C. 500, 504, 480 S.E.2d 467, 469 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nWhether service was made within a reasonable time depends on the circumstances of the case.Â  Montgomery, 325 S.C. at 504, 480 S.E.2d at 470.Â  In this case, the record shows that Hamilton indeed resided at the John C. Calhoun Apartments in North Charleston immediately following the sale of the property and for the next ten months. Â Hamiltonâ€™s wife and daughter testified that the family completed a change of address form for the U.S. Postal Service and had no trouble receiving mail at that address.Â  Hamilton then moved to Hollywood, South Carolina, in Charleston County, and again completed a change of address form.Â  Hamilton was also listed in the Greater Charleston/North Charleston phone book from 2001 through 2004.Â  Furthermore, Hasseini was in possession of Hamiltonâ€™s social security number which, when given to the private process server, led to Hamiltonâ€™s location.Â \r\n \r\nAt the summary judgment hearing, Hamilton did not dispute that the summons and complaint were delivered to the Sheriffâ€™s office for service on Hamilton.Â  Nevertheless, Hamilton was not actually served until one year and nine months later.Â  The master found that to be an unreasonable time.Â  We agree.Â  Although Hasseini called the Sheriffâ€™s office â€œperiodicallyâ€ to check on the status of service, there comes a point when it is incumbent upon a plaintiff to take further steps.Â  In this case, Hasseini continued to rely on the Sheriffâ€™s office for well over a year before even beginning to pursue service through an investigator based on information already in his possession or readily accessible through public means.Â  As a result, Hamilton was not served until more than a year after the statute of limitations had run.Â \r\n \r\nIn Montgomery v. Mullins, 325 S.C. 500, 480 S.E.2d 467 (Ct. App. 1997), this court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s determination that service was not made within a reasonable time after delivery to the sheriff.Â  In that case, the summons and complaint had been filed with the clerk of court in late September 1992, just as the statute of limitations was about to expire, and were forwarded to the sheriff for delivery. Â Id. at 502-03, 480 S.E.2d at 468.Â  The plaintiff had pursued the whereabouts of the defendants through various means and ultimately served them by publication.Â  Id. at 504, 480 S.E.2d at 469.Â  Service was completed in late December 1993, approximately one year and two months after delivery to the sheriff.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nThe plaintiff in Montgomery did receive an affidavit of non-service from the sheriffâ€™s office, which distinguishes it from this case.Â  Id. at 504, 480 S.E.2d at 469.Â  However, the elapsed time between delivery to the sheriff and actual service is considerably longer in this case and there is no evidence Hasseini was taking any significant action to aid the sheriff in effecting service.Â  The determination of whether Hamilton was served within a reasonable time is in the masterâ€™s discretion, and there is ample evidence in the record to support his ruling.Â  Id. at 506, 480 S.E.2d at 470.Â  Consequently, the ruling of the master is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â The present form of the rule omits any reference to delivery of the summons and complaint to the sheriff and simply provides â€œ[a] civil action is commenced when the summons and complaint are filed with the clerk of court if: Â (1) the summons and complaint are served within the statute of limitations . . . ; or (2) if not served within the statute of limitations, actual service must be accomplished not later than one hundred twenty days after filing.â€Â  Rule 3(a), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-329","title":"Watson v.

Babb, of Calabash, N.C., pro\r\n\t\t\t\tse.\r\n\t\t\t\tStephan Victor Futeral, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Malcom M. Babb appeals orders of the circuit court sanctioning him and denying his motion to quash a subpoena.Â  Babb further contends the circuit court abused its discretion by entering judgment on a prior judgeâ€™s order.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 17, 2001, the Watsons filed a lawsuit against Babb and amended the complaint on July 25, 2001, alleging abuse of process, malicious prosecution, frivolous proceedings, slander of title, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty.Â  The Watsons noticed Babbâ€™s wife (Witness) for a deposition for December 29, 2003.Â  Witness requested that her deposition not be held at the office of the Watson properties, but rather at the Georgetown County Courthouse.Â  Not having received a response from the circuit court setting the location for her deposition, she notified the Watsons by letter, dated December 23, 2003, that she would not appear at the December 29th deposition. On January 13, 2004, the Watsons filed a motion to compel Witnessâ€™s testimony because she did not appear at the December 29th deposition.Â  The circuit court granted the Watsonsâ€™ motion to compel and orderedÂ  the deposition take place at the Georgetown County Courthouse.\r\nWitnessâ€™s deposition was held on April 19, 2004.Â  Babb attended the deposition and frequently made objections on behalf of Witness.Â  The Watsons claim Babbâ€™s objections were inappropriate and his behavior was disruptive.Â  As a result, the Watsons terminated the deposition with the intention of filing an appropriate motion asking the circuit court to continue it to a later date.Â  Accordingly, the Watsons made a motion for sanctions and to compel the deposition testimony of Witness.Â \r\n \r\nThe circuit court heard the motion on September 13, 2004, and on November 24, 2004, the court ordered Babb pay $5,665.05 to the Watsons in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs for the failed deposition.Â  The court also ordered that Babb pay the sum of $2500 to the South Carolina Bar Association as a sanction. The court further ordered the Watsons to reschedule Witnessâ€™s deposition and Babb to pay all costs of taking the second deposition at aÂ  hourly fee of $250 for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Babb then retained an attorney, who, on December 16, 2004, filed a motion for the circuit court to reconsider its award of sanctions against Babb.Â  On May 9, 2005, the circuit court partially granted Babbâ€™s motion for reconsideration, reducing the payment to the South Carolina Bar to $1000 and rescinding the award of attorneyâ€™s fees and mileage for the taking of Witnessâ€™s second deposition.Â \r\n \r\nPrior to issuance of the May 9, 2005 order, counsel for Carolina First Bank sent Babb a letter, dated December 22, 2004, which stated that the bank had been served with a subpoena for the records regarding Babbâ€™s relationship with the bank.[2]Â Â  Counsel further stated that unless he received an order from the court that the subpoena should not be complied with, the bank would produce the requested records â€œon or before January 24, 2004â€ [sic], as directed by the subpoena.Â  On January 19, 2005, Babb filed a motion to quash the subpoena issued to the bank.Â  The circuit court denied Babbâ€™s motion on the ground that it was untimely.Â  \r\n\r\nOn July 20, 2005, the Watsons filed a motion for sanctions for Babbâ€™s failure to comply with both the November 24, 2004 order and the May 9, 2005 order.Â  The circuit court granted the Watsonsâ€™ motion for sanctions and entered a monetary judgment against Babb in the amount of $7,040.05, which represented the $5,665.05 previously awarded by the court, plus an additional $1375 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs incurred by the Watsons in preparation for and attendance at the hearing before the court.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Sanctions\r\nBabb contends that in sanctioning him, the circuit court abused its discretion by: (1) ordering that he pay both the Watsonsâ€™ attorneyâ€™s fees and expenses for Witnessâ€™s first deposition, as well as the video expenses of the second deposition; (2) failing to find that the Watsons attempted to use the deposition as a means of intimidation, and finding that Babbâ€™s objections were sanctionable, when the trial judge had granted him the right to object; (3) failing to make a determination of Babbâ€™s ability to pay before ordering that he pay attorneyâ€™s fees; (4) requiring that Babb pay the South Carolina Bar Association the sum of $1000; (5) failing to give him an opportunity to challenge the Watsonsâ€™ affidavit of their expenses in attempting to obtain Witnessâ€™s deposition; and (6) sanctioning Babb in excess of what is usual for practicing attorneys in the state.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees and Retaking of Deposition\r\nThe imposition of sanctions is generally entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  Barnette v. Adams Bros. Logging, Inc., 355 S.C. 588, 593, 586 S.E.2d 572, 575 (2003).Â  A trial judgeâ€™s exercise of his discretionary powers with respect to sanctions imposed in discovery matters will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  The burden is on the party appealing from the order to demonstrate the trial court abused its discretion.Â  Id.Â  An abuse of discretion may be found where the appellant shows that the conclusion reached by the trial court was without reasonable factual support and resulted in prejudice to the rights of the appellant, thereby amounting to an error of law.Â  Dunn v. Dunn, 298 S.C. 499, 502, 381 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1989) (citing Darden v. Witham, 263 S.C. 183, 209 S.E.2d 42 (1974)). \r\n \r\nIn In re Anonymous, 346 S.C. 177, 194, 552 S.E.2d 10, 18 (2001), our Supreme Court noted the broad discretion given South Carolina judges in addressing misbehavior during depositions.Â  The court stated that in addition to their traditional contempt powers, judges may impose sanctions for improper deposition conduct, including an award of reasonable expenses such as attorney fees.Â  Id.Â  The court also stated that â€œamong the costs a judge may deem appropriate could be those incurred for future judicial monitoring of depositions or payment for the retaking of depositions.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, the circuit court found that Babb engaged in conduct specifically prohibited in depositions.Â  The court found the prohibited conduct included making multiple and ongoing speaking objections and coaching the witness, both of which continued after objection from opposing counsel; engaging in disruptive behavior, including inappropriate and inflammatory references to opposing counsel; and making numerous incorrect objections that were dilatory in nature and purpose.Â  The court concluded Babbâ€™s conduct was a â€œknowing and willful effort to subvert the cause of justice and undermine the judicial process. . . .â€ \r\n \r\nThus, pursuant to In re Anonymous, we hold it was within the courtâ€™s discretion to sanction Babb by ordering him to pay the Watsonsâ€™ attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, including the video expenses of Witnessâ€™s second deposition.\r\nB.&nbsp; Abuse of Discovery Process \r\n\r\nMoreover, Babb argues that the Watsons abused the discovery process by attempting to use Witnessâ€™s deposition as a means of intimidation.Â  However, we find no evidence of such an objective on the part of the Watsons.Â  Despite Babbâ€™s contention, we also find no evidence that the circuit court granted Babb any right to make speaking objections during the deposition.\r\nC.&nbsp; Ability to Pay Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nBabb also argues theÂ  court erred by failing to make a determination of his ability to pay before ordering that he pay attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees as a sanction for discovery abuse, the court should weigh the nature of the abuse, the discovery posture of the case, willfulness, and the degree of prejudice.Â  Samples v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 112, 495 S.E. 2d 213, 216 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The thrust of the discovery rules is to afford full and fair disclosure of evidence, â€œto prevent a trial from becoming a guessing game or one of surprise for either party.â€ State v. Highway Department v. Booker, 260 S.C. 245, 252, 195 S.E.2d 615, 619 (1973). \r\n \r\nUnlike in the family court area, the cases discussing imposition of attorney fees as a sanction for discovery abuse do not focus on the ability of the offending party to pay.Â  Nevertheless, we think the financial condition of the offending party should factor into the adequacy of the sanction.Â  However, in this case Babb filed a Rule 59(e) motion wherein he claimed he was not financially able to pay the sanctions.Â  Additionally, he filed an affidavit setting forth his financial condition. We note also that the Watsons filed a reply to Babbâ€™s motion for reconsideration vehemently attacking his claim of poverty.Â  Thus, it is clear the trial court had before it Babbâ€™s financial information and presumably considered it in granting partial relief on his motion for reconsideration by reducing the sum Babb was required to pay to the South Carolina Bar and eliminating the requirement for paying for the retaking of the deposition.Â  Â \r\nD.&nbsp; Payment Â to the South Carolina Bar Association\r\nIn addition, Babb argues the circuit court abused its discretion by requiring him to pay $1000 to the South Carolina Bar Association, because the association was not a party to the litigation.Â  The court ordered Babb pay that sum to the association â€œfor use in its Law Related Education Program in educating our stateâ€™s laymen about substantive and procedural law.â€ Although the association was not a party in this case, the sanction requiring Babb to pay the association was aimed at Babbâ€™s specific misconduct, pursuant to Karppi v. Greenville Terrazzo Co., Inc., in which the court of appeals held that the sanction should be aimed at the specific misconduct of the party sanctioned.Â  327 S.C. 538, 543, 489 S.E.2d 679, 682 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Karppi further notes the policy reasons for the imposition of sanctions, which is to â€œpenalize those whose conduct may be deemed to warrant such a sanction, and to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent.â€Â  327 S.C. at 545, 489 S.E.2d at 683 (citing Natâ€™l Hockey League v. Metro. Hockey Club, Inc., 427 S.C. 639, 643, 96 S.Ct. 2778, 2781 (1976).Â  Because we find a connection between the order to pay the association and Babbâ€™s misconduct during the deposition, including his violation of the rules of procedure, we find the circuit court did not err by sanctioning Babb in this way.\r\n&nbsp;II.&nbsp; Motion to Quash Subpoena\r\nBabb contends the circuit court abused its discretion by denying his motion to quash the subpoena on the ground it was not timely filed, because the bank provided his banking records to the Watsons prior to the time prescribed to respond with a motion to quash.Â  Babb further contends it was error for the court to disregard the bankâ€™s representations of the January 24, 2005 due date for filing a motion to quash and rely solely on the time frame set out in Rule 45, SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 45(c)(2)(B), SCRCP, provides that a person must file a motion to quash a subpoena within fourteen (14) days after service of the subpoena or before the time specified for compliance if such time is less than 14 days after service.Â  Considering this rule, Babbâ€™s January 21, 2005 filing of the motion to quash, after having received notice of the subpoena as early as December 21, 2004, was untimely.Â  However, on December 22, 2004, counsel for Carolina First Bank sent Babb a letter stating that unless they received an order from the court that the subpoena should not be complied with, the bank would produce the records requested â€œon or before January 24, 2004â€ [sic], as directed by the subpoena. Nevertheless, the bank provided Babbâ€™s records to the Watsons on January 7, 2005.\r\n \r\nAs we read the bankâ€™s letter to Babb, there was no representation as to the deadline for Babb to file a motion to quash.Â  The timeliness of Babbâ€™s motion was governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure, which could neither be lengthened nor shortened by the bankâ€™s letter.Â  Therefore, we ascribe no error to the court when it relied on the Rules of Civil Procedure in finding Babbâ€™s motion to be untimely.Â  \r\n \r\nMoreover, we perceive no prejudice to Babb in the allegedly premature furnishing of the records by the bank inasmuch as he does not contend that the records were not discoverable.[3]Â  Thus, the bankâ€™s release of them before the deadline set out in the letter to Babb, does not give rise to reversible error. We find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying Babbâ€™s motion to quash the subpoena.Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nIII.&nbsp; Other Issues Argued\r\nBabb also argues the circuit court abused its discretion by sanctioning him in excess of sanctions that would have been entered against a licensed attorney for like conduct citing In the Matter of Golden, 329 S.C. 335, 496 S.E.2d 619 (1998); that theÂ  court erred in sanctioning him because he was not given the opportunity to challenge the Watsonsâ€™ attorneyâ€™s fee affidavit; and that the court did not have jurisdiction and/or abused its discretion by entering judgment on a judgment and awarding additional attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We hold these arguments are manifestly without merit and affirm the trial court pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCACR, (which provides that the appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any grounds appearing in the record on appeal) and the following authorities: Ball v. Canadian American Express Co., Inc., 314 S.C. 272, 277, 442 S.E.2d 620, 623 (Ct. App. 1994) (failure to object to the use of affidavits during a hearing waives the right to object on appeal); and Rule 37 SCRCP (dealing with the right of a court to sanction a party for failure to cooperate in discovery).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion when sanctioning Babb and denying his motion to quash the subpoena.Â  The circuit court also did not abuse its discretion by ordering that Babb pay additional attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The letter also indicated that Babb had been notified of or served with the subpoena on December 21, 2004.\r\n[3] Babbâ€™s counsel conceded to the trial court that at least part of the documents furnished by the bank were relevant to the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-330","title":"Mack v.

Scarborough, Master-in-Equity\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-330\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2007 â€“ Filed June 26, 2007\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLawrence M. Kasen, of Summerville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJoseph P. Cerato, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Appellant Mary Jones Mack (Wife) brought this action to set aside a deed executed by her late husband, Leroy Mack, Sr. (Father), in favor of his son from a prior marriage, Philip Mack (Son).Â  Wifeâ€™s complaint alleged Father lacked mental capacity to execute the deed and that Son exercised undue influence over Father at the time of his executing the deed. Â The Master-in-Equity found 1) no evidence Father lacked mental capacity and dismissed that cause of action and 2) no undue influence was exerted by Son over Father in the execution of the deed.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nFather purchased the property at issue on Birdâ€™s Nest Road in Wadmalaw Island, South Carolina in 1980, and built a home on the property in 1988.Â  Father and Son lived together on the property until Wife moved in some time prior to 1999.Â  Because there was tension and a mutual dislike between Wife and Son, Son moved out approximately the same time Wife moved to the home.Â  Father made it clear to Son he did not want Son around the home because of the problems it created between Wife and Son.Â  Often times, when Son visited, Father called the police to remove him from the property.Â  During one such incident in March 2000, Father demanded, at gunpoint, that Son leave the property.Â  When Father married Wife later that year, Father and Son stopped communicating and Son stopped visiting the property.Â  There is conflicting testimony as to the duration and extent of Father and Sonâ€™s estrangement, but for roughly four years the two communicated in limited circumstances and only when Wife was not present. Â \r\nIn October 2003, Fatherâ€™s mother died.Â  Father fell into depression and began to drink and lose weight.Â  On November 16, 2003, Father admitted himself to the Medical University of South Carolina Hospital (MUSC) complaining of excessive alcohol intake and abdominal pain.Â  Two days later, Father voluntarily discharged himself, and soon thereafter, he reconnected with Son.Â \r\n \r\nOn December 26, 2003, Wife called the police to the property after Father became violent with her and began punching the walls.Â  The police took Father to a hospital where, after a psychiatric and substance abuse assessment, he was determined not to be suicidal.Â  The mental status exam indicated Fatherâ€™s thought process was organized and void of any delusions, hallucinations, or paranoid ideas.Â  Father was subsequently released.Â  Three days later, Wife sought to commit Father, believing he needed medical attention and supervision.Â  A hearing was scheduled for January 21, 2004, to determine if Father was a chemically dependant individual in need of voluntary commitment.Â  Â Â \r\nWhen Father learned Wife was seeking to involuntarily commit him, Father informed Son of his plan to deed the property to him.Â  A few days prior, on Christmas day, Father also spoke to his sister, Shirley Mae Mack Brown (Brown), of his intent to leave his property to someone in the family, and specifically of his intent to leave it to Son.Â  On January 14, 2004, Father, under the mistaken belief that he could sign over the original deed to Son through a notary, called Son to pick him up and take him to his notary friend, Rueben Davisâ€™s house.Â  Davis told Father he would need to see an attorney to execute the deed.Â  Son contacted his attorney, who recommended the law firm of Davidson, Wigger and Bennett.Â  Two days later, Father executed the deed at the law firm office.Â  Jim Olson, a paralegal, dealt with Father immediately after Father executed the deed.Â  \r\n\r\nFather did not attend the hearing for his involuntary commitment on January 21, and died three days later on January 24, 2004.Â  Wife learned of the deed execution the following day and received a letter of eviction to vacate the property on January 28, 2004.Â  \r\n \r\nWife filed this action to set aside the deed claiming Father lacked mental capacity and Son exercised undue influence over Father at the time he executed the deed.Â  Son counterclaimed alleging Wife committed waste at the property. Â The master denied Sonâ€™s counterclaim of waste and dismissed Wifeâ€™s first cause of action based on the lack of capacity of Father.[2] Â Further,  \r\nthe master found: (1) no confidential relationship existed between Father and Son; (2) Son did not exercise dominion over Father; (3) even if the evidence were sufficient to shift the burden to Son, the Son rebutted the shift by showing there was no undue influence exercised over Father; and (4) adequate consideration supported the conveyance based on the totality of circumstances.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to set aside a deed is equitable in nature. Â Bullard v. Crawley, 294 S.C. 276, 278, 363 S.E.2d 897, 898 (1987).Â  â€œIn an appeal from an action in equity, this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2001).Â  However, this does not require an appellate court to disregard the findings below, or ignore the fact that the trial judge was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of witnesses.Â  Id.Â  Moreover, the appellant maintains the burden of convincing the appellate court the trial judge committed error in his findings.Â  In re Thames, 344 S.C. 564, 571, 544 S.E.2d 854, 857 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Confidential Relationship\r\nWife argues the master erred in failing to find a confidential relationship existed between Father and Son at the time of the execution of the deed. Â We disagree.\r\n \r\nâ€œA deed regular and valid on its face raises a presumption of validity. Â Generally, the party attacking the deed has the burden of proof.â€Â  Hudson v. Leopold, 288 S.C. 194, 196, 341 S.E.2d 137, 138 (1986) (citation omitted).Â  Where, however, a confidential relationship exists between the grantor and grantee, the deed is presumed invalid and the burden is upon the grantee to show an absence of undue influence.Â  Middleton v. Suber, 300 S.C. 402, 405, 388 S.E.2d 639, 641 (1990).Â  \r\n \r\nA confidential relationship arises when the grantor places trust and confidence in the grantee, and the grantee exerts dominion over the grantor.Â  Bullard, 294 S.C. at 281, 363 S.E.2d at 900.Â  While a familial relationship, alone, is insufficient evidence of a confidential relationship, Hudson, 288 S.C. at 196, 341 S.E.2d at 139, â€œa familial relationship certainly supports an argument that a confidential relationship exists.â€Â  Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388, 398, 608 S.E.2d 849, 853 (2005).Â  Yet, the relationship must be one implying confidence, with some evidence that the grantor actually reposed trust in the grantee in the handling of his affairs. Â Bullard, 294 S.C. at 281, 363 S.E.2d at 900.\r\nIn this case, while there was a familial relationship between Father and Son, there is little, if any, evidence that a relationship of trust and confidence existed.Â  There is no evidence that Son was entrusted with any of Fatherâ€™s business affairs or financial matters or was ever asked to take care of any of Fatherâ€™s personal matters prior to the deed transfer.Â  Wife asserts Sonâ€™s involvement in the actual deed transfer reveals Father placed his trust and confidence with Son.Â  Wife suggests Sonâ€™s selection, hiring, and paying of the attorneys that prepared the deed supports her assertions.Â  Although Son assisted in the details of the transfer, he did so at Fatherâ€™s request and only after Fatherâ€™s expressed decision to make the transfer.Â  Further, there is no evidence that Son exerted dominion over Father.Â  In his order, the master found Father was an â€œindependent personâ€ â€œaware of his actions and the consequences of his actions at the time of execution of the Deed.â€ Accordingly, the master found Son did not exert dominion over Father and held no confidential relationship existed between Father and Son. Â We hold a preponderance of the evidence supports this finding.\r\nII.&nbsp; Undue Influence\r\nRegardless of whether there existed a confidential relationship, Wife argues the master erred in failing to find Son exerted undue influence over Father.Â  We disagree.\r\n \r\nAbsent a confidential relationship, the party challenging the deed must show undue influence was brought to bear upon the conveyance such that the grantorâ€™s will was overborne by the grantee.Â  Dixon, 362 S.C. at 398-99, 608 S.E.2d at 854. Â The Supreme Court has described the nature of undue influence as â€œthe kind of mental coercion which destroys the free agency of the creator and constrains him to do things which are against his free will, and that he would not have done if he had been left to his own judgment and volition.â€Â  Id. (citing Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 333 (2003)).[3] Â Further, the challenging party is required to show â€œthe grantor was unquestionably susceptible to undue influence as a result of [his] physical and mental condition or for some other reason,â€ andÂ  â€œclear evidence of opportunity and disposition by the grantee . . . to influence the grantor must be present.â€Â  Bullard, 294 S.C. at 281-82, 363 S.E.2d at 900. \r\n \r\nWe find no evidence in the record that Fatherâ€™s free will was ever overcome.Â  The master found that Father â€œacted of his free will up to the time of his deathâ€ and was aware of the â€œconsequences of his actions at the time of the execution of the Deed.â€Â  The record also indicates that Father, by his own motivation, decided to convey the property to Son, his only child, in an attempt to keep the property in the Mack family.Â  Additionally, the record is devoid of evidence indicating Father was susceptible to undue influence or that Son had the opportunity or disposition to influence Father.Â  Wife claims Fatherâ€™s alcoholic and weakened mental and physical condition placed him in a more susceptible position to Sonâ€™s exertion of dominion over his affairs.Â  While there is evidence that Fatherâ€™s drinking increased and his health deteriorated from October 2003 until his death on January 24, 2004, the master noted that Fatherâ€™s â€œmental acumen remained steadyâ€ and he was â€œan independent person with a strong will despite poor health in his final days.â€ Â Further, Olson, the paralegal who helped with the deed, testified that Father was under no duress at the time of executing the deed.Â  Thus, we find the evidence insufficient to establish undue influence. \r\n \r\nIII.&nbsp; Admission of Testimony \r\nWife next argues the master erred in admitting trial testimony of Brown and Olson as to Fatherâ€™s wish to leave his property to Son over Wifeâ€™s hearsay objection.[4]Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nHearsay is an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  The rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of such a statement unless an exception to the rule applies.Â  Rule 802, SCRE. Â Rule 803(3), SCRE, provides that a statement of the declarantâ€™s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design) is excluded from the hearsay rule.Â \r\n \r\nWife contends the state of mind exception does not apply to the testimony of Brown and Olson because both were offered to prove the truth of the matter, namely, that Father was considering leaving his property to Son.Â  We disagree with Wifeâ€™s assertion.Â \r\n \r\nFirst, the testimony of Olson is non-hearsay because it is not offered for the truth of the matter, but rather to prove Fatherâ€™s capacity at the time of the execution of the deed.Â  Thus, Olsonâ€™s testimony was admissible as non-hearsay.Â  \r\n \r\nFurther, Brownâ€™s testimony reveals that Father made statements to her that indicated Fatherâ€™s then existing state of mind.Â  In December 2003, less than a month before Father executed the deed, Father told Brown of his plan to leave the property to someone in the family.Â  Father initially stated to Brown he was going to leave the property to Son, but asked if she would want it if Son did not want the property.Â  These statements show that, at the time he made them, he intended to keep the property within the Mack family.Â  Father made the statements to Brown before he executed the deed, and they show how he intended to subsequently dispose of his property.Â  Therefore, pursuant to the state of mind exception, Brownâ€™s testimony was admissible and relevant to the issue at hand. \r\n \r\nIV.&nbsp; Reimbursement for Contributions \r\nLastly, Wife asserts that, if this court were to affirm the masterâ€™s rulings, equity requires the court remand the case on the issue of reimbursement for contributions made by Wife to the property before and after Fatherâ€™s death.Â  We disagree.\r\n \r\nAt trial, Wife attempted to testify as to monetary amounts she paid for the general upkeep, maintenance, and improvements to the property.Â  Sonâ€™s counsel objected on the basis that it was outside of the scope of Wifeâ€™s complaint and that she should not be permitted to amend her pleadings to conform to objectionable testimony at such a late stage in the proceeding.Â  The master allowed Wife to make an offer of proof through which the master would later rule on the admissibility.Â  After Wifeâ€™s testimony the master specifically gave Wife the opportunity to make a motion to modify the pleadings to conform to the testimony.Â  Wife made no such motion and the master made no ruling on the admissibility of Wifeâ€™s testimony regarding her monetary contributions to the property.Â  Accordingly, we find this issue is not adequately preserved for review. See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order to be preserved for appellate review).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find no confidential relationship existed between Father and Son at the time of the execution of the deed.Â  Absent a confidential relationship, we hold Wife failed to present sufficient evidence to establish undue influence.Â  Further, we hold the master did not err in admitting trial testimony as to Fatherâ€™s wish to leave his property to Son.Â  Lastly, we find Wifeâ€™s request to remand the case on the issue of reimbursement for contributions she made to the property is not adequately preserved for our review.\r\n \r\nTherefore, the Master-in-Equityâ€™s ruling is  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Respondent did not appeal from the masterâ€™s denial and, therefore, it is the law of the case. Â Â Sims v. Hall, 357 S.C. 288, 293 n. 2, 592 S.E.2d 315, 318 n.2 (Ct. App. 2003) (finding an unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case and precludes further consideration of the issue on appeal).Â  Likewise, the Appellant did not appeal the masterâ€™s dismissal of the action based on lack of capacity and, therefore, it is the law of the case. Â Id.\r\n[3] The supreme court acknowledged the cited case dealt with a will, but found no reason such a discrepancy should change its analysis.Â  \r\n \r\n[4] Wifeâ€™s counsel made timely objections to the testimony of both Brown and Olson; however, the master admitted the testimony without any specificity as to the basis for his ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-331","title":"Washington v.

Hughston, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-331\r\nSubmitted June 6, 2007 â€“ Filed June 26, 2007\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tStephen Bucher, of Mt. Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJames K. Holmes, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Annette Washington (Wife) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s finding that she was not the surviving spouse of Donnell Washington (Husband), and accordingly, did not qualify for death benefits.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 5, 1998, Husband and Wife married and resided together in North Charleston.Â  Both parties had children from prior relationships but they did not have any children together.Â  On June 13, 2002, the police were called to the coupleâ€™s home over a domestic dispute.Â  Wife denied any violence occurred and did not press criminal charges.Â  In spite of that, Husband was arrested for domestic violence.Â  The parties dispute whether Husband returned to the home when he was released from jail the following day.\r\nOn August 6, 2002, Husband fell from a ladder during the course of employment and suffered a fatal head and neck injury.Â  On November 14, 2002, Wife filed a claim for death benefits alleging Husband suffered an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment with the Marlowe-Chandler Company, which she later corrected to the Wright Construction Company.Â  Wife further contended Husband died as a result of his injuries and as his surviving spouse, she was entitled to death benefits.\r\nOn February 13, 2004, a hearing was scheduled, but because Wife could not be found, her attorney withdrew the claim.Â  On July 9, 2004, Wife filed another claim seeking death benefits under the same grounds as the previously withdrawn claim.Â  On March 25, 2005, the single commissioner conducted a hearing on the matter.Â  \r\n \r\nAt the hearing, Wife testified Husband returned home two days after the domestic dispute, and they continued living together, but sometimes he stayed with his son or mother because it was more convenient to where he worked.Â  Wife further testified from July 14, 2002, until Husbandâ€™s death, she stayed with her daughter in the hospital, and Husband stayed with his son or mother.Â  Additionally, she testified Husband was responsible for all of the bills including rent, electricity, and water, and her financial situation deteriorated following Husbandâ€™s death.Â  Wife further testified that after Husbandâ€™s death, she was evicted and homeless for five months and now lived in subsidized housing. Â \r\nHowever, Husbandâ€™s son testified he picked Husband up from jail following the domestic dispute and took him to the marital home where they found Husbandâ€™s personal belongings packed in his car.Â  Further, Husbandâ€™s son and nephew both testified Husband lived with Husbandâ€™s son or mother upon his release from jail until his death.Â  Husbandâ€™s mother testified Husband lived with her for approximately five weeks following his release from jail. Â Â \r\nOn August 5, 2005, the single commissioner found Husband and Wife were living separate and apart at the time of Husbandâ€™s death, and Wife was not dependent on Husband for support at the time of his death.Â  Accordingly, the single commissioner found the claim compensable but found Wife was not a surviving spouse and Kristen Washington, as Husbandâ€™s minor beneficiary, was solely entitled to death benefits.Â  Wife appealed, and the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission affirmed and adopted the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  Wife appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed, adopting the Appellate Panelâ€™s order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions by the Appellate Panel.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Stone v. Traylor Bros., Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule governs the standard of review in a workersâ€™ compensation decision.Â  Frame v. Resort Servs. Inc.,357 S.C. 520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 494 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The Appellate Panelâ€™s decision must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  \r\nShuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C. 435, 440, 622 S.E.2d 569, 571 (Ct. App. 2005). Â An appellate court can reverse or modify the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision only if the appellantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006); Bursey v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\n \r\n\r\n\tâ€œSubstantial evidenceâ€ is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its action.\r\n\r\nLark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306.\r\nâ€œ[T]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984). Â Where the evidence is conflicting over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate Panel are conclusive.Â  Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co.,360 S.C. 276, 290, 599 S.E.2d 604, 611 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate finder of fact.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  â€œThe final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.â€Â  Bass v. Kenco Group,366 S.C. 450, 458, 622 S.E.2d 577, 581 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding she was not a surviving spouse.Â  Wife contends the Appellate Panelâ€™s findings that she and Husband were separated and Husband was not providing her with support because he left the marital home after his arrest for domestic violence are erroneous.Â  We disagree.\r\n \r\nSection 42-9-290 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) provides if an employee dies as the result of an accident arising out of the course of employment, the employer must provide death benefits to dependents wholly dependent on the decedentâ€™s earnings for support.Â  â€œA surviving spouse or a child shall be conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support on a deceased employee.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-110 (Supp. 2006).Â  â€œThe term â€˜surviving spouseâ€™ includes only the decedentâ€™s wife or husband living with or dependent for support upon the decedent at the time of the decedentâ€™s death or living apart from the decedent for justifiable cause or by reason of desertion by the decedent at such time.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-175 (Supp. 2006). \r\n\r\nWifeâ€™s testimony is the only evidence that Husband remained in the marital home.Â  She testified they still lived together except that he sometimes stayed with his mother or son because it was more convenient to where he worked but would come home to change clothes.Â  All of the other testimony contradicts her assertion he returned to the marital home.Â  The Appellate Panel found Wifeâ€™s testimony inconsistent with other credible witnesses and not supported by any corroborating evidence.Â  Accordingly, the Appellate Panel found Wife not to be credible.Â  Husbandâ€™s son testified Husband lived with him or Husbandâ€™s mother following his release from jail.Â  Husbandâ€™s mother testified that Husband lived with her once he was released.Â  Husbandâ€™s nephew testified in July and August 2005, he lived with Husband and Husbandâ€™s son and took Husband to work everyday.Â  Further, Husbandâ€™s ex-wife testified Husband lived with their son and Husbandâ€™s mother at the time of his death.Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, in regards to Wifeâ€™s assertion that Husband continued to support her, she testified Husband was planning on putting a down payment on a trailer for them to live in together.Â  She also testified he continued to pay the rent and provide her with support, but because he only dealt in cash she could provide no record.Â  She did not call her landlord to testify that Husband continued paying the rent or provide any evidence Husband provided her with support after he went to jail. Â Accordingly, the record contains substantial evidence to support the Appellate Panelâ€™s findings that Husband and Wife did not live together and Husband was not supporting Wife at the time of his death.\r\n \r\nAdditionally, Wife argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding Wife was not a supported spouse because the only conclusions from the evidence were the separation was for justifiable cause or Husband deserted Wife.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  In her testimony before the single commissioner, Wife testified she and Husband still lived together.Â  Wife did not argue Husband deserted her or that they were separated for justifiable cause.Â  The single commissioner found Wife was not a surviving spouse based on the finding they were not living together and Wife was not dependent on Husband for support.Â  The single commissioner failed to find whether Husband deserted Wife or whether they were living apart for justifiable cause.Â  When Wife appealed, she asserted she and Husband were living together and she was dependent on him for support.Â  Wife also asserted, in the alternative, if she and Husband were separated, the only other conclusions were Husband deserted her or they were living apart for justifiable cause, which was Husbandâ€™s alleged domestic abuse.Â  The Appellate Panel affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s report, adopting it in full, and did not rule on the issues of desertion and justifiable cause.Â  Wife appealed to the circuit court asserting the same grounds as in her appeal to the Appellate Panel.Â  The circuit court affirmed adopting the findings of the Appellate Panel, thereby not addressing the desertion and separation for justifiable cause issue.Â  Wife did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See In re Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€); Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (â€œIt is well settled that, but for a very few exceptional circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nFurther, this issue also fails on its merits.Â  Husbandâ€™s son testified that upon Husbandâ€™s release from jail, he took Husband home where they discovered Wife had packed all of Husbandâ€™s belongings in his car. Â Wifeâ€™s own testimony was that she and Husband still lived together.Â  Thus, Wife did not meet the elements of desertion.Â  See Vickers v. Vickers, 255 S.C. 25, 30, 176 S.E.2d 561, 563 (1970) (â€œThe essential elements of desertion are . . . (1) [c]essation from cohabitation for the required statutory period; (2) intent on the part of the absenting party not to resume it; (3) absence of the opposite partyâ€™s consent; and (4) absence of justification.â€).Â  Further, there was no evidence the parties were separated for justifiable cause.Â  Wife testified Husband did not abuse her and provided no evidence of Husbandâ€™s abuse.Â  Further, Wife testified she and Husband were not living apart.Â  Therefore, the record contains substantial evidence to support the Appellate Panelâ€™s findings.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, because the record contains substantial evidence Husband and Wife did not live together and Husband was not supporting Wife at the time of his death, substantial evidence supports the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding. Â Additionally, the issue of whether Husband deserted Wife or whether Husband and Wife were separated for justifiable cause is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Further, the record contains substantial evidence to support the finding that Husband did not desert Wife, and Husband and Wife were not separated for justifiable cause.Â  Therefore, the Appellate Panelâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS JJ., concur.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-332","title":"Bennett v.

Lloyd, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-332\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2007 â€“ Filed June 27, 2007\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tWillie J. Bennett, of Hopkins, Pro Se.\r\n\t\t\t\tNo Respondent brief filed.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Willie J. Bennett appeals a circuit court order remanding his case for a new trial.Â  In his brief, Bennett argues that:Â  (1) the property Tommy Wilson left at his residence should have been found abandoned, (2) the magistrate court erred in reducing Bennettâ€™s award of damages on remand, and (3) Wilson fraudulently and illegally entered into a contract without the required licenses and surety bonds.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBennett contracted with Wilson to make repairs on Bennettâ€™s home for $7,000 in total.Â  Wilson claimed he and his subcontractor were insured and bonded by the state and local municipalities to perform all necessary work.Â  Wilson provided Bennett documentation in support of this claim.Â  Bennett paid Wilson $3,250 by check in advance, and agreed to pay the remaining contract balance upon completion.Â  However, Wilson only appeared at Bennettâ€™s house for one day of work and did not return thereafter.Â  Wilsonâ€™s subcontractor began painting Bennettâ€™s home on April 9, 2002, but failed to do the proper prep work.Â \r\n \r\nAs a result, Bennett contacted the South Carolina Residential Builders Commission Program Coordinator, who investigated the matter and determined that Wilson and his subcontractor were not properly bonded or licensed to perform contract work with a cost greater than $4,999. The coordinator thus issued a cease and desist order to Wilson and his subcontractor.Â \r\n \r\nBennett made numerous phone calls and sent three certified return receipt letters to Wilson requesting that he retrieve the equipment he left behind.Â  Wilson never did so, and Bennett disposed of the equipment.\r\nBennett filed a complaint in the magistrate court to recover damages associated with Wilsonâ€™s incomplete work.Â  A non-jury trial was held at which both parties appeared pro se.Â  The magistrate ordered that Wilson pay Bennett $5,000 in damages, including $325 in punitive damages, plus $55 in costs.Â  Wilson appealed to the circuit court, which remanded the case to the magistrate court. Â The magistrate court order dated July 15, 2004, awarded Bennett judgment in the amount of $3,000 plus $55 in costs.Â  Both parties appealed from this decision, but Bennettâ€™s appeal was dismissed.Â  The second appeal to the circuit court culminated in yet another remand to the magistrateâ€™s court for a new trial.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA circuit court sitting in an appellate capacity in a civil case from the magistrate has the ability to make a determination in the same manner as the circuit court in trials without a jury and to reverse for errors of fact even though the circuit court did not have the opportunity to observe witness demeanor. Â Vacation Time of Hilton Head Island, Inc., v. Kiwi Corp., 280 S.C. 232, 234, 312 S.E.2d 20, 21 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  On review from the circuit court, the appellate court is without authority to reverse findings of fact of the circuit court if there is any supporting evidence.Â  Southeastern PVC Pipe, Mfg. Inc. v. Rothruck Const. Co., Inc., 280 S.C. 498, 500, 313 S.E.2d 50, 52 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBennett appeals the circuit court order remanding this case for a new trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nOn appeal there is a presumption in favor of the correctness of a decree, and the burden of showing error by the circuit court is on the appellant.Â  Snyderâ€™s Auto World, Inc. v. George Coleman Motor Co., Inc., 315 S.C. 183, 186, 434 S.E.2d 310, 312 (Ct. App. 1993); Cook v. Eller, 298 S.C. 395, 398, 380 S.E.2d 853, 855 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  In this matter, Bennettâ€™s arguments do not contain allegations of any error on the part of the circuit court; rather, Bennett merely argues the merits of the case as if he were before the circuit court on remand.Â  Bennett seeks reinstatement of the damage award from the original hearing, minus the punitive damages that were later overturned, plus additional costs, for a total of $4,936.Â  The new trial ordered will provide Bennett the opportunity to prove his case and damages.Â  \r\n \r\nMoreover, Bennett fails to provide a sufficient record for this appeal.Â  The record includes no transcript of the circuit court hearing.Â  The order in the record, a Form 4 order, contains no findings of fact or conclusions of law.[1]Â  Therefore the record before this court does not allow for competent review of any proceeding, and contains insufficient evidence to support Bennettâ€™s arguments. Â Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 339, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005) (holding that the appealing party has the burden of providing a sufficient record).Â  Based on this record, we can find no error on the part of the circuit court.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not err in remanding this case to the magistrateâ€™s court for a new trial. Accordingly, the circuit court order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] It is merely a form order stating the appeal is remanded to the magistrateâ€™s court for a new trial.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-333","title":"State v.

Thomas, Circuit Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-333\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2007 â€“ Filed June 27, 2007\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAppellate Defender Kathrine H. Hudgins, South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia; and Solicitor John Gregory Hembree,Â  of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Clarence Gibbs appeals his convictions for kidnapping, armed robbery, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Gibbs claims the trial court erred in admitting evidence of an out of court â€œshow-upâ€ identification.Â  Gibbs also alleges the trial court erred in admitting half of the photo line-up when the other half was lost prior to trial.Â  Finally, Gibbs avers the court erred in failing to give an alibi charge.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 10, 2005, at approximately 9:30 p.m., the Piggly Wiggly grocery store on Highmarket Street in Georgetown was robbed.Â  John Fowlkes, the manager, Eric Sessions, the cashier, and Greg Morton, the bagger, were working when the store was robbed. Â All three employees testified that a man entered the store, approached Fowlkes and Sessions, pulled a gun, and told them he was there to rob the store. Â The robber then took Fowlkes and Sessions to the office, also taking Morton along the way. Â When they arrived at the office, Fowlkes opened the door and let the others inside. Â As directed, Fowlkes filled a garbage bag with approximately $500. Â Thereafter, the robber left the store. Â Store surveillance captured the whole incident on tape.\r\n \r\nThe employees immediately notified the authorities of the robbery, and each gave consistent descriptions of the robber and the incident. Â After viewing the surveillance tape, officers with the Georgetown Police Department compiled a photo line-up, consisting of two pages with six photos on each page. Â One page contained a picture of Gibbs, while the other did not. Â Though both pages were presented to the victims, the page without Gibbsâ€™s photo was lost prior to trial. Â Ten days after the incident, Fowlkes and Morton both identified Gibbsâ€™s picture as that of the robber, while Sessions was unable to identify any of the twelve individuals pictured.\r\n \r\nApproximately one week later, the police brought Gibbs in for questioning.Â  All three victims were brought to the police station to view Gibbs. Â Fowlkes and Morton identified Gibbs as the robber both by his appearance and his voice. Â Meanwhile, Sessions, upon viewing Gibbs, was sure Gibbs was not the person who robbed the Piggly Wiggly.\r\n \r\nGibbsâ€™s girlfriend, Karen Dozier, and mother, Rosa Jenkins, each testified they were at home with Gibbs on the night of the robbery. Â Gibbs, Dozier, and Jenkins testified they were watching the television show JAG on Sunday, April 10, 2005, between 9:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. Â They remembered this particular episode of JAG because Gladys Knight had a cameo role and sang her hit song â€œMidnight Train to Georgia.â€ \r\n \r\nBoth Jenkins and Dozier testified the only channels available at their house were ABC and FOX while Gibbs testified they also picked up channel 5. Â The State presented rebuttal witnesses from ABC and FOX who testified their stations did not carry JAG on the night in question. Â One of the rebuttal witnesses testified JAG was a CBS affiliated show and would have come on channel 5 in Georgetown. \r\n \r\nPrior to trial, Gibbs moved to suppress any evidence of any show-up identifications as well as any mention of the incomplete photo line-up and any identifications that came from the line-up.Â  The trial judge then held a Neil v. Biggers[1] hearing.Â  After the hearing, the court made a thorough ruling denying Gibbsâ€™s motion to suppress both types of identification.Â  \r\n \r\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the jury convicted Gibbs on all three counts, and the judge sentenced him to concurrent terms of twenty years imprisonment for the armed robbery and for the kidnapping, and five years imprisonment to run consecutively for the possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGibbs argues the trial court erred in admitting evidence of an out of court show-up identification.Â  We disagree.\r\nThis issue is not properly preserved for review.Â  See State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57 (1996) (holding a ruling in limine is not final, and unless an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling procured, the issue is not preserved for review); State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 587 S.E.2d 691 (2003) (holding issues not preserved for review cannot be addressed on appeal).\r\nThe trial of this case was conducted out of order to allow Eric Sessions, one of the victims and a defense witness, to report to the United States Navy.Â  Thus, Sessions was the first witness to be asked about the show-up identification.Â  The defense thoroughly questioned Sessions about the show-up identification. Â Sessions responded that he was sure Gibbs was not the person who robbed the Piggly Wiggly.\r\n \r\nBoth Fowlkes and Morton were then examined as part of the Stateâ€™s case.Â  During both examinations the witnesses were asked about the show-up identification process.Â  Both witnesses confirmed that the man at the police station during the show-up was the man who robbed the Piggly Wiggly.Â  Both witnesses also identified that man as Gibbs, the defendant.Â \r\n \r\nThe defense failed to object to the show-up identification during either Fowlkesâ€™s or Mortonâ€™s examination. Â Therefore, pursuant to Simpson and Dunbar, that issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nGibbs next argues the trial court erred in admitting half of the photo line-up identification when the other half of the line-up was lost prior to trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nThis issue is not preserved for our review.Â  State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 479 S.E.2d 57 (1996) (holding a ruling in limine is not final, and unless an objection is made at the time the evidence is offered and a final ruling procured, the issue is not preserved for review); State v. Carlson, 363 S.C. 586, 611 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding defendant failed to preserve issue for appeal when he responded â€œNo objectionâ€ when the previously objected-to photographs were introduced into evidence at trial); State v. Dunbar, 356 S,C, 138, 587 S.E.2d 691 (2003) (holding issues not preserved for review cannot be addressed on appeal).\r\nOnce again, the defense questioned Sessions about the photo line-up prior to the State attempting to admit the line-up into evidence.Â  The State first moved the photo line-up into evidence during Fowlkesâ€™s testimony.Â  When the State made their motion to admit the line-up, the defense responded: â€œNo objection.â€\r\n \r\nLater, when the State moved to enter the surveillance tape into evidence, the defense responded as follows:\r\n\r\n\tSubject to our previous objection.Â  I mean, your Honor, for clarification when the line-up was introduced into evidence previously I think I did not voice an objection.Â  I would like the record to reflect that the line-up that was introduced was subject to a previous objection.Â  The court has ruled and admitted that line-up but Iâ€™d like the record to reflect that that is subject to our previous objection.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the defense made a timely objection when the State attempted to introduce Mortonâ€™s copy of the photo line-up and when the State attempted to introduce a copy of the line-up during the investigating officerâ€™s testimony.Â  Both of those objections were overruled and the line-ups were admitted into evidence.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Gibbsâ€™s argument regarding the photo line-up being admitted into evidence during Fowlkesâ€™s testimony is not preserved for our review pursuant to Simpson, Carlson, and Dunbar.Â  With respect to Gibbsâ€™s argument that the line-up should not have been admitted during Mortonâ€™s and the officerâ€™s testimony, we find even if the line-up was erroneously admitted, it was harmless error as it was merely cumulative to the other line-up, the show-up identifications, and the in court identifications.Â  See State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 329, 247 S.E.2d 334, 337 (1978)(â€œUnder settled principles, the admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely cumulative to other evidence.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nGibbsâ€™s final argument is that the trial court erred in failing to give an alibi charge.Â  We disagree.\r\nGibbs admits he did not object to the charge as given.Â  By not raising a specific objection to the trial courtâ€™s omission of a jury instruction on the law of alibi, Gibbs waived the right to raise the issue on appeal.Â  State v. Johnson, 315 S.C. 485, 445 S.E.2d 637 (1994).\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s decision is  \r\nAFFIRMED.[2]Â  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] 409 U.S. 188 (1972).\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-334","title":"Gilmer v.

Stoudemire, of Seneca, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tMichael Thornton, of Jacksonville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Susan Thornton (Wife) and Michael Thornton (Husband) were granted a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation. Â An equitable apportionment of the marital estate was ordered.Â  Wife appeals, arguing the family court erred in (1) its valuation of the marital residence; (2) failing to credit Wife with $18,000 she contributed towards the purchase of the marital residence; (3) its valuation of Wifeâ€™s retirement account; (4) its valuation of Husbandâ€™s retirement accounts; (5) failing to require Husband to reimburse Wife for health insurance premiums; (6) awarding Husband a surround sound system without apportioning the corresponding debt to the Husband; and (7) failing to require Husband reimburse Wife for the deficiency owed on a Chevy Trail Blazer that was repossessed and sold.[1]Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.[2]Â  Â \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married August 6, 1998.Â  This was Wifeâ€™s third marriage and Husbandâ€™s second marriage.Â  Wife had two children and Husband had three children, all of prior marriages.Â  Wife and Husband had no children together.Â  \r\n \r\nWife brought an action on January 23, 2003, seeking a divorce on the grounds of physical cruelty, equitable apportionment of the marital estate, an award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, and a restraining order against Husband.Â  Husband filed an answer and counterclaim on February 14, 2003, joining in Wifeâ€™s prayer for equitable apportionment, and seeking a divorce on the ground of Wifeâ€™s physical cruelty and a restraining order against Wife.Â  \r\n \r\nThe family court entered a temporary order on February 14, 2003, awarding temporary relief as well as mutual restraining orders.Â  The court entered another order on April 15, 2003, refusing to find Husband in contempt, continuing the provisions of the February 14, 2003 order, and holding all other issues in abeyance.Â  On December 19, 2003, the court entered an interim order requiring Husband to prepay Wife an amount for six months of health insurance coverage, to continue through the final hearing.Â  The court ordered the reimbursement for prior coverage to be heard at the final hearing. Â \r\nThe final hearing was heard on May 20, 2004 and August 17, 2004.Â  Following the hearing the family court granted a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation, ordered equitable apportionment of the estate, awarded Wife attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, and issued a mutual restraining order.Â  The court also found Husband in willful contempt of a prior order against disposing of marital assets. Â \r\nOn November 17, 2004, Wife moved for reconsideration regarding several aspects of the equitable apportionment.Â  On November 18, 2004, Husband moved for reconsideration of the final order regarding equitable apportionment and the award of fees and costs.Â  The family court heard both motions for reconsideration on December 7, 2004.Â  On January 5, 2005, the family court entered an order on reconsideration disposing of both motions and amending the order. Â Wife appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Â Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992). Â This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings, and we remain mindful of the fact the family court, who saw and heard the parties, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign weight to their testimony. Â Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981); Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 307, 608 S.E.2d 147, 149-50 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The burden is upon the appellant to convince this court that the family court erred in its findings of fact. Â Dubose v. Dubose, 259 S.C. 418, 423, 192 S.E.2d 329, 331 (1972).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Valuation of the Marital Residence\r\nWife argues the family court erred in valuing the marital residence at $145,000.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn making an equitable distribution of marital property, the family court must identify real and personal marital property and determine the propertyâ€™s fair market value.Â  Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 48, 467 S.E.2d 132, 134 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œIn the absence of contrary evidence, the court should accept the value the parties assign to marital assets.â€Â  Toler v. Toler, 292 S.C. 374, 379, 356 S.E.2d 429, 432 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  A family court may accept the valuation of one party over another, and the courtâ€™s valuation of marital property will be affirmed if it is within the range of evidence presented.Â  Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 215, 363 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1987). \r\n \r\nIn this case, Wife testified that she had the property appraised on April 30, 2002, at $135,000, and stated that was the value of the property at the time the parties filed for divorce in January 2003.Â  She further explained that Husband and Wife offered the home for sale in 2001 for $135,000.Â  Husband, however, testified that he initially allowed the property to be appraised relatively low, $135,000, but believed at that time they could sell it for $145,000 - $149,000.Â  In a trial exhibit, Husband assigned the property a fair market value of $159,000 and explained at the hearing that Husband and Wife had made substantial improvements to the property, including increasing the actual size of the residence by 1,000 square feet, adding sodding and a watering system at a cost of $10,000, and landscaping at a cost of $8,000.Â  As to the valuation of the marital residence, the family court found the Husbandâ€™s testimony slightly more credible than the Wifeâ€™s and valued the residence at $145,000.\r\nBecause the family court was free to accept Husbandâ€™s valuation over Wifeâ€™s, and the value accepted by the family court was within the range presented at trial, we find no abuse of discretion in the valuation of the marital home.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not err in valuing the marital residence.Â  \r\n \r\nII. Credit for Money Contributed Towards the Purchase of the Marital Residence\r\nWife also argues the family court erred in failing to credit her roughly $18,000 she contributed towards the purchase of the marital residence.Â  Wife contends the money she used was from the sale of her premarital residence.Â  We disagree. \r\n \r\nGenerally, property acquired by either party prior to the marriage is nonmarital property.Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 338, 569 S.E.2d 393, 398 (Ct. App. 2002); S.C. Code Ann. Â§20-7-473(2) (Supp 2005).Â  However, nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property if: (1) it becomes so commingled with marital property as to be untraceable; (2) it is jointly titled; or (3) it is utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property. Â Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 98, 545 S.E.2d 531, 536-37 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\n \r\nWife claims that she sold her residence from her previous marriage to raise the down payment for the marital residence.Â  She testified she netted $18,162.57 from the sale of her pre-marital residence and deposited it into a joint Wachovia bank account in the name of Husband and Wife.Â  Wife later testified that all the marital money went into that joint bank account and all house payments and bills were paid from the account.Â  Husband acknowledged that the money from Wifeâ€™s pre-marital residence was deposited into the joint bank account, but testified that it was because Husband and Wife considered the sale a â€œjoint sale.â€Â  The family court found the monies generated from the sale of Wifeâ€™s former residence were fully transmuted and she was not entitled to a credit.\r\nAfter reviewing the record, we find evidence to support the family courtâ€™s ruling that the money Wife received from the sale of her premarital residence was fully transmuted.Â  The evidence shows that the money from the sale was used in support of the marriage or in some other manner evidencing the intent to make it marital property.Â  Money from the sale was directly deposited into a previously established joint bank account.Â  Money from the joint account was used to make the down payment on the marital residence and to make house payments.Â  Money from the account, as Wife testified, was also used by Husband and Wife to pay marital bills.Â  We find that by commingling the money from the sale of Wifeâ€™s premarital residence with money from the partiesâ€™ marital account so as to become untraceable, and generally using the money from the account to support the marriage, any money received from the sale of Wifeâ€™s residence was transmuted into marital property. Â Accordingly, the family court did not err in failing to credit her roughly $18,000.\r\nIII. Valuation of Wifeâ€™s Retirement Account\r\nWife contends the family court erroneously valued her retirement account with Oconee Memorial Hospital.Â  We agree. \r\n \r\nDuring the marriage, Wife worked as an RN with Oconee Memorial Hospital.Â  Her retirement account from the hospital was fully funded by her employer and at the time of the separation the account value was $8,614.03.Â  Wife submitted a statement from the hospital revealing that as of December 31, 2002, Wife was only 40% vested in the plan.Â  The family courtâ€™s order valued the account as if Wife was 100% vested in the plan at the time the parties separated.Â  On appeal, Wife asserts the family court erred in treating her account as fully vested and valuating her retirement at the full $8,614.03.\r\nThis court has consistently held nonvested retirement benefits are marital property if the benefits are acquired during the marriage and before the date of filing.Â  Ball v. Ball, 312 S.C. 31, 34-35, 430 S.E.2d 533, 534-35 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding nonvested, unvalued pension benefits are marital property subject to equitable distribution); see also Shorb v. Shorb, 372 S.C. 623, 643 S.E.2d 124, 127 (Ct App. 2007) (finding nonvested stock options comparable to nonvested retirement funds and concluding the nonvested stock options at issue were marital property subject to equitable distribution).Â  There is no doubt in this case that Wifeâ€™s retirement account is marital property.Â  However, the account is only marital property to the extent that it was earned while Wife and Husband were married.Â  At the time of the filing for divorce Wife was 40% vested.Â  Thus, if Wife were to cash in her account on the day of the filing, she would have been entitled to only 40% of the account.Â  Since the account was not fully vested at the time of the filing it should not have been valued as if it were 100% vested.Â  Therefore, we find the family court erred in its valuation of Wifeâ€™s retirement account and remand for a revaluation of the account consistent with this opinion.\r\nIV. Valuation of Husbandâ€™s Retirement Accounts\r\nWife contends the family court erred in failing to include all of Husbandâ€™s retirement accounts in apportioning the marital estate.Â  We agree. \r\n \r\nIn the final divorce decree, the family court noted the existence of Husbandâ€™s Roth IRA with Smith Barney, and assigned a value of $5,304.96. The family court included this value as the Husbandâ€™s retirement in the apportionment of the marital estate.Â  Wife presented evidence at the final hearing that Husband had a second retirement account with Wachovia at the time of separation, valued at $2,330.39. Â Wife testified that on March 8, 2004 Husband cashed in the account and received $2,315.82.Â  On appeal, Wife argues the family court erred in failing to include the value of the Wachovia account in the equitable apportionment.Â  \r\n \r\nA review of the record reveals that Husband maintained a separate Wachovia Securities retirement account at the time of separation.Â  The evidence suggests Husband sold the securities on March 8, 2004 and received $2,315.82.Â  Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR, provides in part: Â â€œUpon the failure of respondent to timely file a brief, the appellate court may take such action as it deems proper.â€Â  Here, Husband did not file a respondentâ€™s brief and in short offers us nothing as to whether the account should have been included in the marital estate or whether the family court properly excluded the account. Â This court should not be inclined to do what Husband neglected to do, i.e, â€œsearch the record for reasons to affirm.â€ Â See Campbell v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 266, 603 S.E.2d 625, 629 (Ct. App. 2004) (Goolsby, J., concurring) (citing Wierszewski v. Tokarick, 308 S.C. 441, 444 n.2, 418 S.E.2d 557, 559 n.2 (Ct. App. 1992)).Â  Thus, we find the family court erred in failing to include the Wachovia Securities retirement account in the valuation of Husbandâ€™s retirement and remand the issue for a revaluation of Husbandâ€™s retirement accounts consistent with this opinion.\r\nV. Reimbursement for Health Insurance Premiums\r\nWife further appeals the family courtâ€™s ruling that Husband was not required to reimburse Wife for prior health insurance premiums she paid on his behalf.Â  We agree. \r\n \r\nUnder the interim order Wife was to maintain health insurance coverage on Husband for six month periods, and Husband was to reimburse her at the monthly rate of $86.99 ($521.94 per six months).Â  The order also found that at the time of the order, Husband had not paid Wife for coverage for the prior six months at $133.88 per month, for a total of $803.23 for his health insurance.Â  The order read:\r\n\r\n\tPAST INSURANCE COVERAGE: That reimbursement by the Plaintiff to the Defendant for the health insurance coverage of the Defendant in the total amount of insurance furnished the Defendant by the Plaintiff at the rate of $133.88 per month times six (6) equals $803.28 in total cost shall be heard at the final hearing in this case \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe final divorce decree identified this issue as an issue for resolution by the court, but failed to address Wifeâ€™s claim for reimbursement.Â  Wife raised this issue in her motion for reconsideration.Â  In the order on reconsideration the family court acknowledged the issue had been preserved by the interim order but ruled that because the temporary order required each party to pay those debts listed in his or her financial declarations and the interim order required the parties keep the insurance coverage in effect, it could â€œfind no present basis to require that the Husband reimburse the Wife for these payments.â€ Â \r\nWhile the temporary order provided that each party would be responsible for debts shown on the financial declarations it was â€œon a temporary basisâ€ â€œpending further order of the Court.â€Â  Further, the interim order did require the parties keep the insurance coverage in effect, but found Wife should not be responsible for Husbandâ€™s health insurance premiums.Â  The interim order required Husband to prepay Wife for coverage on a six month basis during the pendency of the case.Â  If Husband failed to make the prepayment, he forfeited all health insurance coverage.Â \r\n \r\nThe reimbursement of coverage premiums Wife sought were for the six months prior to the interim order, July through December 2003, during which period Husband and Wife were separated.Â  We find no reason Wife should have been responsible for Husbandâ€™s health insurance for the six months prior to the interim order.Â  See Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992) (explaining that, in appeals from the family court, the appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence).Â  Therefore, we reverse the family courtâ€™s ruling as to payments of health insurance premiums and find it equitable for Husband to pay Wife the portion of health insurance premiums, $803.28, she paid for the six months prior to the interim order.Â  \r\n \r\nVI. Debt Corresponding to Stereo System\r\nWife also argues the family court erred in awarding Husband a surround sound system without apportioning the corresponding debt to the Husband.Â  We agree.\r\nDuring the marriage, Husband and Wife purchased a surround sound system with a joint Wells Fargo account. Â Husband took the system when he left the marital residence. Â The system was listed on a list of marital assets in Husbandâ€™s possession at the time of the temporary order.Â  The temporary order provided, â€œHusband should have temporary use and possession of certain items of personal property located in the marital home and identified and listed on page 3 of Wifeâ€™s affidavit . . . and be responsible for the expenses associated therewith.â€Â  In the final divorce decree the family court did not specifically address the surround sound system. Â Wifeâ€™s motion for reconsideration requested the family court reconsider the award of the system. Â The family court summarily dismissed the issue.Â  \r\n \r\nThe family court has broad discretion in determining how marital property is to be valued and distributed.Â  Wynn v. Wynn, 360 S.C. 117, 123 600 S.E.2d 71, 74 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The family court may use any reasonable means to divide the property equitably, and its judgment will only be disturbed where abuse of discretion is found.Â  Id.Â  The same rules of fairness and equity that apply to the equitable division of marital property also apply to the division of marital debts.Â  See Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 437, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813-14 (Ct. App. 1993); Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 457 ,486 S.E.2d 516, 521 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nIn this case, we find it equitable and fair that the debt should follow the system as required in the temporary order.Â  Because Husband took possession of the system at the time of the temporary order and maintained possession, he should be responsible for the corresponding debt.Â  Therefore, we remand for a determination of the debt corresponding to Husbandâ€™s system and thereby credit to be applied to Wife. \r\n \r\nVII. Reimbursement for Deficiency on Repossessed Chevy Trail Blazer\r\n \r\nFinally, Wife appeals the family courtâ€™s ruling that Husband was not required to reimburse Wife for the deficiency owed on a Chevy Trail Blazer that was repossessed and sold.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn the temporary order Husband was awarded the Blazer, but the car was repossessed by GMAC due to Husbandâ€™s failure to make payments. Â The final divorce decree identified the partiesâ€™ Blazer as marital property, but because it had been repossessed and sold, the court valued it at zero.Â  Wife claimed she was being sued for the balance of $4,900.54 and asked the court to charge the deficiency sought by GMAC against Husband.Â  In the order on reconsideration, the family court held it could find no evidence that Wife had paid any portion of that deficiency or that GMAC was actively pursuing a deficiency claim against Wife. Â Accordingly, the family court denied Wifeâ€™s request.Â  \r\n \r\nWe agree with Wife that Husband should be responsible for any debt or deficiency owed on the Blazer.Â  However, after a review of the record, we find no evidence that Wife has paid any portion of the deficiency owed GMAC or that GMAC is actively pursuing a deficiency claim.Â  Therefore, the family court did not err in holding Husband was required to reimburse Wife for the deficiency owed on the Blazer.Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the family courtâ€™s valuation of the marital residence, its refusal to credit Wife for money she contributed towards the purchase of the marital residence, and its refusal to require Husband to reimburse wife for the deficiency owed on the Blazer.Â  We find the family court erred in its valuation of Wifeâ€™s retirement account, its valuation of Husbandâ€™s retirement accounts, and its award of the surround sound system to Husband without apportioning the corresponding debt.Â  We remand these three issues to the family court for a recalculation consistent with this opinion.Â  Finally, we reverse the family courtâ€™s holding that Husband was not required to reimburse Wife for health insurance premiums and require Husband to reimburse wife $803.28 for the coverage premiums. \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Husband did not file a Respondentâ€™s brief. \r\n \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-339","title":"Roe v.

Â At the time of the hearing in this matter, Father was incarcerated and had been incarcerated since prior to Childâ€™s birth.\r\nEarly in Childâ€™s life, Father visited with Child on two occasions while incarcerated. Â Father sent letters to Childâ€™s mother requesting that Child be brought for additional visits.Â  However, Childâ€™s mother was uncooperative.Â  Therefore, the family court found Fatherâ€™s failure to visit Child was out of his control and was not willful.Â  \r\n \r\nFatherâ€™s only means of income was from money orders send to him by his family.Â  The court noted that it was unclear how much money Father had received but found that between August 1, 2000 and March 20, 2006, Father spent a total of $1,976.21 and that Father had not provided any support for Child.Â  Instead, Father spent the money he received in the prison canteen on snack food, cigarettes, and various other nonessential items.Â  The family court, in its order, noted Fatherâ€™s limited access to funds.Â  However, the family court found that Father had some disposable income, and he had willfully failed to use the income to support Child.Â  Based on this finding of a willful failure to support coupled with a determination that termination was in Childâ€™s best interest, the family court terminated Fatherâ€™s parental rights.Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn an appeal from a TPR, an appellate court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 95, 627 S.E.2d 765, 770&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, the appellate court should not necessarily disregard the findings of the family court, because the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Id.Â  This degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of a minor child.Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 62, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652&nbsp;(2006).Â  Before parental rights can be forever terminated, the alleged grounds for the termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 356 S.C. 413, 589 S.E.2d 753 (2003). Â \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nSection 20-7-1572(4) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) allows the family court to grant TPR upon a finding TPR is in the childâ€™s best interest and:\r\n\r\n\tThe child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to support the child.Â  Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care.Â  A material contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means.Â  The court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support . . . .\r\n\r\nâ€œJust as it does in determining wilful failure to visit, the family court has wide discretion in determining whether a failure to support is wilful.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 612, 582 S.E.2d 419, 425&nbsp;(2003).Â  â€œTo determine whether a parentâ€™s failure to support or visit during the time of incarceration evinces a settled purpose to forego parental responsibilities requires a comprehensive analysis of all of the facts and circumstances.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 332, 339, 543 S.E.2d 580, 584&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).\r\nAlthough Father had limited funds at his disposal due to being incarcerated, he clearly had some funds and failed to provide support for Child.Â  Given Fatherâ€™s expenditures on nonessential items, we find that the family court did not err in finding Fatherâ€™s failure to support was willful.Â  See \r\n \r\nS.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Phillips, 301 S.C. 308, 310, 391 S.E.2d 584, 585 (Ct.

Harpootlian, and Graham L. Newman, both of Columbia, for Appellant\r\n\t\t\t\tErin D. Dean, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this declaratory judgment action, Sharon Barber, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Joseph Taylor, appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Auto Owners Insurance Company in which the court held there was no coverage for her claim.Â  We affirm. Â \r\nFACTS\r\nThis action involves a general commercial liability insurance policy purchased by Dorothy Pittman.Â  Dorothy is the sole owner of Pittman Food Store, Inc., a corporation which owns several rental properties.Â  From 1994 through June 2002, Dorothyâ€™s daughter-in-law, Terri Pittman, rented one of these properties for the operation of a convenience store called JT&amp;T Food Mart. Â The lease agreement was never reduced to writing.Â  Terri claimed that in exchange for the $500 a month in rent, Dorothy agreed to pay the property taxes on the property and to maintain liability insurance for the operation of the business.Â  Although Dorothy acknowledged that she agreed to pay the real estate taxes on the property, she denied that she had agreed to provide liability insurance for Terri, Timmy, or JT&amp;T Foodmart.Â  Terriâ€™s husband (and Dorothyâ€™s son), Timmy Pittman, worked part-time at the store.Â \r\n \r\nIn 1995, Dorothy completed an application for insurance coverage with Auto Owners seeking coverage for the properties she owned.Â  Barbara Causey, the agent who completed Dorothyâ€™s application, was aware that Dorothy did not operate JT&amp;T.Â  Although the application listed the nature of Dorothyâ€™s business as â€œproperty-owner,â€ Causey incorrectly coded Dorothyâ€™s application as owner/operator of a convenience store and not as a lessor.Â  Dorothy thereafter paid the slightly higher premiums associated with the incorrect classification.Â \r\n \r\nOn July 23, 2000, a frequent patron, Joseph Taylor, who was mentally challenged, became involved in a verbal altercation with one of the storeâ€™s part-time employees.Â  Terri, who was working at the time, called Timmy and asked him if she should call the police.Â  Timmy told her not to call the police and that he would come over to the store.Â  By the time Timmy arrived at the store, Taylor had already left.Â  Timmy searched for Taylor and found him off store premises.Â  Timmy and Taylor engaged in a struggle.Â  Timmy struck Taylor with a brick and then shot him.Â  Taylor died as a result of his injuries.Â  Timmy eventually pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter.\r\nIn September 2001, Barber, as personal representative of Taylor, filed a wrongful death suit against Dorothy d/b/a Pittman Food and Drugs and Timmy.Â  In February 2002, Auto Owners filed a declaratory judgment action seeking an order that Auto Owners did not owe a duty to defend or a duty to indemnify either Dorothy or Timmy in the underlying action.Â  Thereafter, in May 2003, Barber amended her complaint to remove all allegations against Dorothy, either individually or doing business as Pittman Food and Drug; the amended complaint also added Terri as a defendant.Â  Thus, the only issue remaining in the declaratory judgment action was whether Auto Owners owed a duty to defend or a duty to indemnify Terri or Timmy under the commercial general liability policy issued to Dorothy.Â  \r\n \r\nAfter a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment to Auto Owners.Â  The court held Auto Ownersâ€™ duties only extended to Dorothy.Â  In addition, the court held Auto Owners was not estopped from arguing the insurance policy does not cover Terri and Timmy.Â  Specifically, the court found Auto Ownersâ€™ conduct did not warrant estoppel because the elements of estoppel were not met.Â  This appeal followed.\r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, appellate courts apply the same standard that governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP, which states that summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005). â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€ Â Helms Realty, Inc., 363 S.C. at 340, 611 S.E.2d at 488. Â â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  Summary judgment should be granted when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ.Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBarber contends the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Auto Owners.Â  Specifically, Barber argues Auto Owners should be estopped from denying coverage to Terri or Timmy because Auto Ownersâ€™ agent filed an insurance application falsely stating Dorothy owned and operated JT&amp;T.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nFirst, we hold the doctrine of estoppel cannot be used to make valid a policy that would provide coverage for JT&amp;T, a business in which Dorothy, the named insured, did not have an insurable interest.Â \r\n \r\nâ€œLiability insurance, like other forms of insurance, must be supported by an insurable interest in the named insured.Â  The insurable interest required does not depend upon the named insured having either a legal or equitable interest in the property, but it is enough that the insured may be held liable for damages to its operation and use.â€Â  American Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Passmore, 275 S.C. 618, 620-21, 274 S.E.2d 416, 417-18 (1981) (citations omitted).Â  \r\n \r\nIn Passmore, the named insured added a vehicle belonging to someone else onto his own liability policy when the owner of the vehicle was unable to obtain insurance himself.Â  The trial court held the insurance company was estopped from denying coverage because it accepted premiums and issued the policy covering the vehicle.Â  Our supreme court reversed, holding that because the named insured did not have any insurable interest in the vehicle, the policy was illegal and the doctrine of estoppel may not be invoked to make it valid.\r\n \r\nIn the present case, it is undisputed that Dorothy did not have an insurable interest in the business of JT&amp;T.Â  Accordingly, Barber may not invoke the doctrine of estoppel in an attempt to make valid a policy providing coverage for the business.Â \r\n \r\nEven if the doctrine of estoppel could be invoked in this case, we find the essential elements of estoppel have not been met and thus the doctrine does not apply.Â \r\n \r\nIn finding estoppel was not applicable, the trial court applied the traditional essential elements of estoppel.Â  These elements are:Â  â€œ(1) ignorance of the party invoking it of the truth as to the facts in question; (2) representations or conduct of the party estopped which mislead; (3) reliance upon such representations or conduct; and (4) prejudicial change of position as the result of such reliance.â€Â  Pitts v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 247 S.C. 545, 552, 148 S.E.2d 369, 371 (1966).\r\nBarber asserts Auto Owners should be estopped based on Small v. Coastal States Life Ins. Co., 241 S.C. 344, 348, 128 S.E.2d 175, 178 (1962).Â  In Small, the supreme court stated: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe knowledge of an agent acquired within the scope of his agency is imputable to his principal, and, if an insurance company, at the inception of the contract of insurance, has knowledge of facts which render the policy void at its option, and the company delivers the policy as a valid policy, it is estopped to assert such ground of forfeiture. Â \r\n\r\n241 S.C. 344, 350, 128 S.E.2d 175, 178 (citation omitted).Â  \r\n \r\nThe court held the insurer was estopped from denying coverage where the insured unintentionally misrepresented his health history.Â  In so finding, the court noted there was evidence the insurerâ€™s agent had been informed of the insuredâ€™s medical history.Â  The court did not examine whether the elements of estoppel had been proven.\r\nBased on Small, Barber argues the correct standard for determining whether an insurer may be estopped from asserting coverage merely depends on whether the insurer â€œhas knowledge of facts which render the policy voidâ€ when the policy is issued.Â  Barber further contends Small stands for the position that the elements of estoppel need not be proved for estoppel to apply in the insurance context.Â \r\n \r\nWe find Barberâ€™s assertion that the traditional elements of estoppel are not required under Small is meritless.Â  Although the supreme court did not specifically address the elements in Small, it did not reject those elements either.Â  \r\n \r\nFurthermore, the appellate courts of this state have consistently considered the essential elements set forth in Pitts in determining whether the doctrine of estoppel applies in insurance cases. Â See e.g., Standard Fire Co. v. Marine Contract and Towing Co., 301 S.C. 418, 421, 392 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1990); Jost v. Equitable Life Assurances Socâ€™y of the U.S., 271 S.C. 492, 496, 248 S.E.2d 778, 780 (1978); The Crescent Co. of Spartanburg v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 266 S.C. 598, 604, 225 S.E.2d 656, 659 (1976); Ellis v. Metro. Cas. Ins. Co. of N.Y., 187 S.C. 162, 167, 197 S.E. 510, 512 (1938) (stating that in the law of insurance contracts, â€œthe essential elements of estoppel are ignorance of the party who invokes the estoppel, representations, or conduct of the party estopped, which mislead, and an innocent and deleterious change of position in reliance upon such representations or conductâ€).\r\nWe find the circuit court did not err in applying the elements of estoppel as found in Pitts.Â  Considering these elements, the trial court held:\r\n\r\n\tIn this case, there was absolutely no contact between Terri Pittman, Timmy Pittman, and Auto Owners Insurance Company.Â  Accordingly, there can be no representations or actions taken by [Auto Owners] that was relied on by [Terri and Timmy] and therefore, there are no grounds in the instant case for estoppel.Â  If [Terri and Timmy] were relying on Mrs. Dorothy Pittman to provide insurance for their business, they had the opportunity to check with her/or obtain a copy of the policy to determine whether or not Terri Pittman, Timmy Pittman, or their business, JT&amp;T Foodmart, were shown as insured on the policy.Â  Their failure to undertake that action cannot impose liability on Auto Owners.Â \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBarber only challenged the standard the circuit court applied in considering estoppel and did not specifically challenge these findings of facts.Â  See Weaver v. Recreation Dist., 328 S.C. 83, 88, 492 S.E.2d 79, 82 (1997) (stating the trial courtâ€™s findings come to the appellate court with a presumption of correctness, and the burden is on the appellant to demonstrate reversible error).Â  Furthermore, we hold the circuit courtâ€™s findings are supported by the record.Â  There is no evidence Auto Owners made any representation of coverage to either Terri or Timmy.[1] Â In addition, there is no evidence that Dorothy relied on any representation or conduct by Auto Owners that would support a finding of estoppel in this case.Â  In fact, Dorothy stated in her affidavit that she only intended to obtain liability insurance for only herself individually and doing business as Pittman Food &amp; Drug.Â  She denied intending that the policy would also cover Terri, Timmy, or JT&amp;T Foodmart.Â \r\n \r\nWe therefore find the circuit court properly concluded Auto Owners was not estopped from denying coverage.Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the circuit court is\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  Â \r\nHUFF, BEATTY, JJ. and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We note it is of no consequence that Terri thought the lease arrangement with Dorothy included a promise to provide liability coverage.Â  Any representation made by Dorothy does not translate to a representation made by Auto Owners.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-342","title":"Jenkins v.

P.

Jenkins (Wife) based on a one-year separation and requested an equitable division of the marital assets.Â  Wife answered and counterclaimed in a timely manner, requesting separate support and maintenance, divorce on the ground of adultery, equitable division, a restraining order, and attorney fees and costs.Â  On November 20, 2003, Wife filed a notice of motion and motion for temporary relief. Â After a pendente lite hearing on January 14, 2004, Family Court Judge Walter B. Brown signed a temporary order on February 3, 2004, granting Wife exclusive possession and use of the marital residence, requiring Husband to pay directly to Wife $750.00 per month by the 10th day of each month toward the mortgage on the residence beginning in February 2004, and directing Husband to either pay $2,959.28 to stop the pending foreclosure action on the home or make arrangements with the mortgagee to stop the foreclosure.\r\nFollowing issuance of the temporary order, a rule to show cause was issued against Husband and a hearing on the matter was scheduled for February 17, 2004.Â  Husband failed to appear on the appointed date, and on March 8, 2004, Family Court Judge H. Bruce Williams issued a bench order holding Husband in contempt and sentencing him to serve 10 days in the detention center but allowing him to purge himself by paying $200.00 in court costs by 5:00 p.m. that day.Â  Judge Williams also rescheduled the hearing for April 15, 2004.\r\nFollowing the hearing on April 15, Family Court Judge Rolly Jacobs signed an order on May 20, 2004, finding Husband in willful contempt of the temporary order. Â In support of this finding, Judge Jacobs noted (1) Husband failed to pay the indebtedness on the mortgage on the marital residence or make timely arrangements with the mortgagee to stay the pending foreclosure; and (2) Husband did not pay Wife $700.00 per month toward the mortgage.[2]Â  Consequently, Judge Jacobs ordered Husband to serve 30 days in jail, with the condition that he could purge his contempt and procure his release by paying Wife $2,100.00 plus $1,800.61 in attorney fees.\r\nWife filed another rule to show cause alleging Husband failed to obey both the temporary order issued by Judge Brown and the order issued by Judge Jacobs.Â  A hearing on this rule to show cause took place before Family Court Judge Jack Landis on August 30, 2004.Â  By order dated and filed September 2, 2004, Judge Landis found Husband in contempt of both prior orders and sentenced him to serve no less than 6 months in the county detention center.Â  Judge Landis allowed Husband to purge himself of the contempt by paying the mortgage arrearage of $5,250.00 to Wife and previously ordered attorney fees to Wifeâ€™s counsel.[3]Â  Upon his release, Husband was to pay additional fees of $639.00 to Wifeâ€™s attorney.\r\nA final hearing in the matter took place before Family Court Judge Berry Mobley on October 25, 2004.Â  Both parties were present and represented by counsel.Â  At the hearing, the parties announced they had reached an agreement regarding the ancillary issues, leaving only the issue of the divorce for the court to decide.Â  Judge Mobley, after hearing the terms of the agreement and examining both parties, approved the agreement and incorporated it into the final divorce decree.Â  Judge Mobley also granted Husband a divorce based on his finding that the parties had been separated more than one year.Â  Because the agreement called for Husband to pay periodic alimony, monthly installments on attorney fees awarded to Wife, and past due spousal maintenance and support, Judge Mobley, with Judge Landisâ€™s consent, suspended the contempt sentence imposed on Husband by Judge Landis the previous month and ordered Husbandâ€™s release from custody to allow Husband to begin working.Â  Judge Mobley signed the divorce decree on December 5, 2004, and the clerk of court filed it on December 9, 2004.\r\nOn December 7, 2004, Husband filed a â€œmotion to reconsider,â€ alleging in general terms that portions of the order did not seem to reflect the agreement of the parties as stated on the record and that he did not agree to certain terms of the agreement as set forth in the order.Â  On March 14, 2005, Husband, now represented by another attorney, filed a notice of motion and motion for relief pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  On July 21, 2005, Husband moved to amend his prior motions, essentially arguing that, after reviewing the trial transcript, he determined there were discrepancies between the partiesâ€™ agreement as stated on the record and the agreement as it was set forth in the divorce decree.Â  Wife did not file a response to any of Husbandâ€™s motions.\r\nThe clerk of court scheduled Husbandâ€™s motions to be heard during Judge Mobleyâ€™s next term in Richland County, which was not until November 1, 2005, and Judge Mobley ordered briefs from both parties on the salient issues.Â  On August 9, 2005, after the briefs had been submitted, Judge Mobley issued an order declaring a mistrial in the action and declaring the order that he signed on December 4, 2004, null and void except for the granting of the divorce.Â  In the order signed August 9, 2005, Judge Mobley found â€œ[b]oth parties have now filed motions to vacate the Order as it does not properly reflect the agreement as presented to the Court.â€\r\nOn August 12, 2005, counsel for Wife faxed a letter to Judge Mobley at his office in Lancaster advising that his client did not ask that the order at issue be vacated but that it be upheld.Â  Counsel further requested that Judge Mobley recommit Husband to serve the remaining time on the contempt sentence imposed by Judge Landis if the mistrial order was to remain in effect.\r\nJudge Mobley held another hearing in the case on November 9, 2005.Â  Attorneys for both parties were present.Â  After hearing arguments from counsel, Judge Mobley ruled from the bench that he would rescind the order for mistrial. Â Judge Mobley confirmed this ruling in writing by order dated December 5, 2005, and filed December 20, 2005.Â  In the same order, Judge Mobley also denied Husbandâ€™s motions for relief under Rules 59(e) and 60, SCRCP and held the divorce decree signed December 5, 2004, would be â€œthe Order of the case.â€Â  Husband appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1. Husband argues there was no motion filed under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to confer subject matter jurisdiction on Judge Mobley to vacate his previous order for mistrial beyond ten days of the date of issuance of that order. Â We disagree.\r\n \r\nIn Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 543 S.E.2d 224 (Ct. App. 2001), this court ruled that â€œa Family Court judge does not have the authority to alter or amend a judgment, sua sponte, once the judgment is more than 10-days-old.â€Â  Id. at 157, 543 S.E.2d 229.Â  In addition, because the only post-trial motion by either of the parties did not include a request for the relief granted by the family court when it decided the motion, we held there was no timely motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, on which the family court could base an assertion of jurisdiction. Id. at 155-56, 543 S.E.2d at 228-29.\r\nIn the present case, it is apparent from the appealed order that Judge Mobley, in noting that Wifeâ€™s attorney â€œrequested the court reconsider the rulingâ€ in his prior order declaring a mistrial in the case, considered the August 12, 2005 letter to be a motion to alter or amend.Â  In the letter, counsel noted both the execution and filing dates of the order for mistrial, thus indicating that he was responding promptly in contesting it.Â  We have found nothing in the record to suggest the letter was not sent to Husbandâ€™s counsel. Moreover, the fact that it prompted Judge Mobley to set a hearing, at which Husband was present and voiced no objection, indicates Judge Mobley considered the letter a sufficient statement of the relief Wife was requesting even though it may not have been presented in the customary form in which a post-trial motion would ordinarily be made.Â  See Arthur v. Sexton Dental Clinic, 368 S.C. 326, 334 n.5, 628 S.E.2d 894, 898 n.5 (Ct. App. 2006) (upholding the issuance of a proposed scheduling order, notwithstanding that the documents submitted by the proponent of the order â€œwere not necessarily the equivalent of a formal motionâ€ and noting that â€œ[b]ecause the circuit court and the parties were aware of the substance of Respondentsâ€™ request, we do not believe Appellants were prejudiced by the absence of a formal motionâ€); 56 Am. Jur. 2d Motions, Rules, and Orders, Â§ 16, at 15 (2000) (noting failure to comply with formalities prescribed for motions â€œmay not be fatal to the motion so long as the substantive grounds and relief desired are apparent and the nonmovant is not prejudiced by the omissionâ€). Â Because there was no dispute that Husbandâ€™s attorney received the letter within ten days after the order for mistrial was filed, we further hold the letter constituted a timely motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.\r\n \r\n2. In his reply brief, Husband further contends that, under Rule 5(d), SCRCP, the August 12, 2005 letter had to be filed with the clerk of court to preserve Judge Mobleyâ€™s authority to act on it.Â  We reject this argument.Â  Â \r\nâ€œSubject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Johnston v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 365 S.C. 293, 297, 617 S.E.2d 363, 364-65 (2005).Â  Under this definition of subject matter jurisdiction, a time limit, although mandatory, is not jurisdictional unless the governing rules for having a matter adjudicated by a particular tribunal provide otherwise.Â  See Rule 5(d), SCRCP (â€œUpon failure of a party to file other pleadings, motions, or papers, the court may permit filing or proceed as though the same had not been served.â€); In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 644, 550 S.E.2d 311, 314 (2001) (holding the failure of the State either to conduct a trial regarding whether the defendant was a sexually violent predator or to seek a continuance within the statutorily-required time limit did not divest the court of jurisdiction and noting the appellantâ€™s failure to move to dismiss the case on that ground constituted a waiver of his right to challenge the Stateâ€™s failure to meet the requisite deadline); cf. McClain v. Ingram, 314 S.C. 359, 360, 444 S.E.2d 512, 512-13 (1994) (noting Rule 5(d), SCRCP, clearly requires that the summons and complaint in a civil case be filed before they are served and holding that, because â€œservice preceded filing, . . . this action was not properly commenced before expiration of the statute of limitationsâ€).\r\nApplying the foregoing to the present case, we note (1) the only procedural requirement for a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, is that it â€œshall be served not later than 10 days after receipt of written notice of the entry of the orderâ€; and (2) Husband does not suggest on appeal that his attorney did not receive the letter from Wifeâ€™s attorney within ten days after entry of the order for mistrial.Â  Any alleged failure to file the letter as required by Rule 5(d), SCRCP, would not have precluded Judge Mobley from exercising authority to grant Wifeâ€™s request for relief absent a pertinent objection by Husband.Â  Because Husband did not object to Wifeâ€™s proceeding on her motion or otherwise note it had not been timely filed with the clerk of court, he cannot raise this issue on appeal.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\n\r\n  3. We disagree with Husbandâ€™s contention that Judge Mobley erred in denying his motion for relief under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, because of various alleged errors in the divorce decree.Â  Variations between that order and what was recited at the divorce hearing were not substantive discrepancies but merely changes in language for the order to be clear and enforceable.Â  Moreover, counsel for both parties reviewed the proposed order before it was submitted to Judge Mobley, and only the modifiability of the alimony amount in dispute.Â  As to that particular issue, it is clear from the transcript of the divorce hearing that alimony was to be modifiable and that the base amount was, in fact, advantageous to Husband considering his earnings during the prior year. Â Under these circumstances, we are at a loss to see how any of the alleged differences between the final order and the statements of counsel during the hearing inured to Husbandâ€™s prejudice.Â  See Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 156, 485 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1997) (stating an appellant must show prejudice to have a judgment reversed).\r\n4.Â Finally, Husband contends Judge Mobley erred in denying his motion under Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  In support of his argument, Husband alleges the agreement was unfair from both a procedural and substantive perspective and suggests Wife took advantage of the fact that he was serving time in jail on a contempt charge issued in connection with the litigation.Â  We disagree.Â \r\n \r\nThe agreement, as read into the record during the final hearing, did not address whether Husband would remain incarcerated.Â  Furthermore, it appears from the transcript that Husband was released from custody only after Judge Mobley questioned both parties about the agreement and had obtained Judge Landisâ€™s consent to suspend the contempt sentence.Â  Finally, after comparing the agreement as presented in the final order with the representations of counsel in court and after reading Judge Mobleyâ€™s examination of both parties, we are satisfied that the terms expressed in the final order were substantially the same as those recited at the hearing, that Husband assented to them notwithstanding any reservations he may have had, and that the agreement was fair to both parties.Â  \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and KITTREDGE, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  There is no explanation as to why Judge Brown directed Husband to pay $750.00 per month to Wife toward the mortgage and Judge Jacobs, in the later order, recited the amount he was to pay was $700.00 per month.\r\n[3]Â  Again, there is a discrepancy in that this order states the attorney fees were $1,861.00, as opposed to $1,800.61 in Judge Jacobsâ€™s order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-343","title":"Brown v.

Pruitt Agnew (Pruitt), Janie May S. Agnew (Janie), and their eight children formed The Agnew Family Limited Partnership (Partnership) pursuant to The Agnew Family Limited Partnership Agreement (Partnership Agreement).[2] Â Pruitt and Janie transferred certain real estate they owned to the Partnership.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Partnership was structured to have one thousand total units, ten general partner units, and 990 limited partner units.Â  Initially, Pruitt held six general partner units and 495 limited partner units, Janie held four general partner units and 495 limited partner units, and the children owned no Partnership units.Â  Both Pruitt and Janie made gifts of limited partner units to their eight children in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998.Â  As of March 4, 1998, each child owned fifty-four limited partner units and Pruitt and Janie each owned 279 limited partner units.Â  The ownership of general partner units remained the same until Janieâ€™s death on August 25, 1998, when her general partnership units passed to Pruitt under her will.\r\nOn June 7, 1999, Pruitt executed a document assigning one general partnership unit and 2.25 limited partnership units each to Jane Agnew Brown (Jane), Thomas Simpson Agnew (Tom), Izetta Pruitt Agnew (Izetta), and James.[3]Â  However, on the same day, Pruitt executed a document, Clarification of Ownership of Agnew Family Limited Partnership Interests, reflecting that Izetta and James had not accepted the general partnership units Pruitt had attempted to transfer them, had refused to sign the amendment to the certificate of limited partnership, and would receive limited partnership units instead.Â  Schedule B of the Partnership Agreement as of 6/7/99 indicate the general partners of the Partnership were Pruitt, who held eight general partnership units, and Jane and Tom, who each held one general partnership unit.Â  An amendment to the certificate of limited partnership was filed with the Secretary of State on March 9, 2000, reflecting that Jane and Tom were added as substitute general partners to the Partnership.\r\n \r\nOn August 1, 2000, Pruitt assigned his remaining general partnership units to Jane and Tom, who each received four units.Â  Schedule B of the Partnership Agreement as of 8/1/00 reflect the general partners of the Partnership were Jane and Tom, who each held five general partnership units.Â  An amendment to certificate of limited partnership was filed with the Secretary of State on August 18, 2000, indicating Pruittâ€™s withdrawl as a general partner.Â  Pruitt died on January 11, 2002, having transferred all of his units in the Partnership to his children.Â \r\n \r\nOn July 1, 2003, Jane, Izetta, Tom, Timothy Wigington Agnew, Rebecca Ann Girardeau, and John Pruitt Agnew (the Plaintiffs) filed an action for the partition and sale of real estate against James and Susan Agnew Worthington.[4]Â  James filed an answer, counterclaim and cross-claim which sought dissolution of the Partnership and an accounting of partnership activities and transactions by Jane and Tom.Â  James was allowed to file an amended answer, counterclaim and cross-claim, which sought the same relief, but contained additional allegations.Â  The case was referred to the master-in-equity.Â  \r\n \r\nPlaintiffs, less Izetta, (Respondents) filed a motion for partial summary judgment asking the court to find that neither James nor Izetta are general partners of the Partnership.Â  James filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment asking the court to find that there are no general partners of the Partnership. Â James also filed a motion to amend his answer, counterclaim and cross-claim to conform to proof regarding his cross-motion for partial summary judgment.Â  Izetta did not file a pleading in the case, but submitted an affidavit in opposition to both motions for partial summary judgment.\r\nAt the hearing on the motions, Respondentâ€™s offered the affidavit of Kenneth B. Wingate, the attorney who prepared all of the Partnership documents.Â  The affidavit stated James refused to accept a general partnership unit because he did not want the liability associated with being a general partner.Â  Further, the affidavit explained because James and Izetta would not sign a certificate of amendment acknowledging their position as general partner, as required by statute, Pruitt assigned one general partner unit to only Jane and Tom.Â  James claimed he did not refuse to accept a general partnership unit and was never asked to sign any document relating to the assignment of general partnership units.[5]Â Alternatively, James argued there are no general partners because Pruitt failed to follow the terms of the Partnership Agreement when he appointed Jane and Tom as general partners.Â  According to Jamesâ€™ interpretation of the Partnership Agreement, to appoint new or substitute general partners the limited partners of the Partnership had to be notified and consent to such appoint.Â  Thus, James avers because he, as a limited partner, never consented to the appointment of Jane and Tom, after Pruitt transferred his general partnership shares and withdrew as general partner, there was no longer a general partner of the Partnership.\r\nThe master granted partial summary judgment on Respondentâ€™s motion finding James is not a general partner but denying partial summary judgment on Respondentâ€™s motion regarding Izetta.[6]Â  The master found James did not meet any of the statutory requirements for recognition as a general partner.Â  The master further denied Jamesâ€™ motion for partial summary judgment, finding he was barred by the doctrine of estoppel and laches because he waited too long to raise his no general partner argument.Â  The master also denied Jamesâ€™ motion to amend his answer, counterclaim and cross-claim.Â  James filed a motion to reconsider, alter, or amend the masterâ€™s order.Â  A hearing was held on January 17, 2006, at which time the master denied Jamesâ€™ motion.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard that governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as matter of law.Â  Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 467-68, 581 S.E.2d 496, 500-501 (Ct. App. 2003);Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 227, 612 S.E.2d 719, 722 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Nonetheless, a court cannot ignore facts unfavorable to that party and must determine whether a verdict for the party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts.Â  Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 423, 529 S.E.2d 710, 713 (2000) (citations omitted). \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJames appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Respondentâ€™s, which found James is not a general partner of the Partnership.Â  James claims the June 7, 1999 assignment of partnership interest signed by Pruitt clearly indicates James is a general partner and, thus, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he refused to accept the assignment of a general partnership interest.Â  James avers the master gave more weight to the evidence provided by the Respondentâ€™s rather than reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to James.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to form a limited partnership in South Carolina, a certificate of limited partnership must be executed and filed in the office of the Secretary of State.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§33-42-210(a) (2006).Â  The certificate must set forth: (1) the name of the limited partnership; (2) the address of the office and name and address of the agent for service of process; (3) the name and mailing address of each general partner; (4) the latest date upon which the limited partnership is to dissolve; and (5) any other matters the partners determine to include.Â  Id.Â  A limited partnership is a partnership consisting of two or more limited partners and one or more general partners.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§33-42-20(7) (2006.Â  A â€œâ€˜General Partnerâ€™ means a person who has been admitted to a limited partnership as a general partner in accordance with the partnership agreement and named in the certificate of limited partnership as a general partner.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-42-20(5) (2006).Â \r\n \r\nThe certificate of limited partnership is amended by filing a certificate of amendment in the office of the Secretary of State.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§33-42-220(a) (2006).Â  Within thirty days after the admission or withdrawal of a general partner a certificate of amendment must be filed.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§33-42-220(b) (2006).Â  A certificate of amendment designating a new or substitute general partner must be signed by at least one general partner and by each other general partner designated in the certificate as a new or substitute general partner.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§33-42-240 (2006). \r\n \r\nIn this case, the original certificate of limited partnership, executed and filed in the office of the Secretary of State on September 21, 1995, indicates Pruitt and Janie as sole general partners.Â  In accordance with the statutory requirements, a certificate of amendment was executed and filed in the office of the Secretary of State after Janieâ€™s death to indicate the withdrawal of Janie as a general partner and the admission of Jane and Tom as general partners.Â  The certificate of amendment was signed by Pruitt, as the â€œone general partner,â€ and Jane and Tom, as the general partners designated in the certificate.\r\nWhile Pruitt executed an assignment of partnership interests, on July 7, 1999, indicating an attempt to assign one general partner unit to Jane, Tom, Izetta and James, he executed a clarification of assignment of partnership interest on the same day.Â  The clarification indicates that only Jane and Tom accepted the general partner units and that Izetta and James would receive limited partner units instead. Â Also, as provided in Section 5.6 of the Partnership Agreement entitled â€œPartnership Interest,â€[7] the percentage of partnership interests from June 7, 1999 to August 1, 2000 indicate Jane and Tom as general partners and James as a limited partner.Â  \r\n \r\nFurther, Pruitt executed another assignment of partnership interests on August 1, 2000, transferring four general partner units each to Jane and Tom.Â  On August 18, 2000, a certificate of amendment was executed and filed in the office of the Secretary of State indicating Pruittâ€™s withdrawl as a general partner and the intent of the Partnership to continue without dissolving.Â  The certificate is signed by the remaining general partners, Jane and Tom.\r\n \r\nWhile James argues he never refused to accept the assignment of a general partnership unit and offers Izettaâ€™s affidavit stating she never refused to accept the assignment of a general partnership unit, the overwhelming evidence and documents indicate that the general partner units were never officially assigned to James.Â  Whatever the reason, Pruitt ultimately decided not to appoint James as a general partner, and the final step of amending the certificate of limited partnership was not taken as to James.Â  Although we are bound to review the record in a light most favorable to James, we cannot ignore facts unfavorable to him.Â  See e.g. Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 423, 529 S.E.2d 710, 713 (2000).Â  Therefore, we find the grant of summary judgment in favor of Respondentâ€™s was proper.\r\nJames also appeals the denial of his cross-motion for partial summary judgment and the denial of his motion to amend his answer, counterclaim, and cross-claim.Â  It is well settled that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable.Â  Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 168, 580 S.E.2d 440, 444 (2003); see also Joyner v. Greenville Assocs Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 364 S.C. 237, 240, 612 S.E.2d 727, 728 (Ct. App. 2005) (declining to address the denial of appellantâ€™s motion for summary judgment). Â Similarly, it is well settled that an interlocutory order, such as an order denying a motion to amend pleadings, is not immediately appealable unless it involved the merits of the case or affects a substantial right.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§14-3-330 (Supp. 2006); see also Tatnall v. Gardner, 350 S.C. 135, 138, 564 S.E.2d 377, 379 (Ct. App. 2002) (order denying motion to amend pleadings to assert third party claims was not immediately appealable because the order did not determine a substantial matter forming the whole or part of some cause of action).Â  Thus we decline to address Jamesâ€™ arguments that the master erred by failing to grant him partial summary judgment and by failing to grant him leave to amend his answer, counterclaim, and cross-motion.\r\nBased on the foregoing, the grant of partial summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The Partnershipâ€™s Certificate of Limited Partnership was filed with the South Carolina Secretary of State on September 21, 1995.Â  \r\n \r\n[3] Pruitt also assigned 3.25 limited partnership units to his four remaining children. Â \r\n[4] The partition action was resolved by Order dated December 14, 2004 and is not before this court.Â  \r\n \r\n[5] Izetta also submitted an affidavit declaring she had never been asked to sign a document accepting a general partnership unit.Â \r\n \r\n[6] The master denied the motion as to Izetta because she had not filed a pleading in the action, only a response to the pending motions.Â  Thus, the master found her status, including whether she deliberately chose not to be a general partner, was a matter in which â€œfurther inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law,â€ citing Brockbank v. Best Capital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 378, 534 S.E.2d 688, 692 (2000). Â \r\n[7] Section 5.6 reads, â€œEach partnerâ€™s percentage of partnership interest is the percentage reflected in Schedule B. as amended from time to time.â€ Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-344","title":"Dickey v.

Dickey, of Charlotte, Pro\r\n\t\t\t\tSe.\r\n\t\t\t\tRobert H. Hood, Molly H. Craig and Deborah H. Sheffield, all of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  James Dickey appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on his wrongful death, negligence, and breach of contract causes of action.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nFrom May 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002, Dickeyâ€™s diabetic mother resided at Clarke Nursing Home (the Nursing Home). Â In April and May 2002, his mother was repeatedly admitted to Carolinas Hospital System (the Hospital).Â  From May 31, 2002 until she was discharged on June 24, 2002, the Hospital treated Dickeyâ€™s mother for foot sores. Â Prior to her discharge, the Hospital called Dickey and requested his permission to amputate her feet, which he granted. Â Dickeyâ€™s mother died in June 2003.[1]Â  \r\nOn June 30, 2005, Dickey, both in his individual capacity and as personal representative (PR) of his motherâ€™s estate, filed a complaint against the Nursing Home, Cooke Associates of Florence, Inc.,[2] the Hospital, and DOES A-Z.[3] Â Dickey alleged: (1) professional and medical negligence; (2) gross professional and medical negligence; (3) wrongful death; and (4) breach of contract.[4] Â \r\nIn his complaint, Dickey maintained the Nursing Home, despite knowing his mother was diabetic, transported her in a wheelchair without foot guards or footwear protection. Â Dickey alleged that because of this practice, she developed ulcers on her feet and heels.Â  These ulcers became infected and resulted in her untimely death. \r\n \r\nOn August 4, 2005, the Nursing Home filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming Dickey lacked standing to bring any claims on behalf of his mother in his individual capacity and the statute of limitations barred the claims. Â The Nursing Home asserted Dickeyâ€™s mother last resided at its facility on May 31, 2002, but Dickey commenced the suit over three years later on June 30, 2005.Â  \r\n\r\nOn September 20, 2005, the trial court held a hearing on the Nursing Homeâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  The trial court found the date that the Hospital informed Dickey his mother needed an amputation was the date that a reasonable person would be on notice that a potential claim existed against the Nursing Home. Â Dickey could not recall the exact date the Hospital informed him his mother needed an amputation.Â  Therefore, the trial court set the date beginning the statute of limitations no later than June 24, 2002, the date of her last discharge. Â Accordingly, the statute of limitations expired no later than June 24, 2005, six days before Dickey filed the complaint. \r\n\r\nOn September 27, 2005, after the summary judgment hearing, the South Carolina Bar placed Dickey on interim suspension for an unrelated matter.[5] Â On October 31, 2005, Dickey filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration regarding the summary judgment motion. Â In ruling on the motion for reconsideration, the trial court found Dickey was authorized to file the complaint in his individual capacity, but he was not authorized to file it on behalf of the estate due to his suspension. Â See Brown v. Coe, 365 S.C. 137, 142, 616 S.E.2d 705, 708 (2005) (holding because an estate is a separate legal entity from the individual named as PR, a PR who is not a lawyer cannot represent an estate in court). Â Because his license was suspended, his attempt to file the motion on behalf of his motherâ€™s estate was tantamount to the unauthorized practice of law. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-310 (Supp. 2005).Â  Therefore, the trial court considered the motion only as to Dickey in his individual capacity and denied the motion. Â In his individual capacity, Dickey appealed the trial courtâ€™s decision. \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases not requiring the services of a fact finder.&nbsp; George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).&nbsp; When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this Court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002) (internal citation omitted).&nbsp; Under this rule, summary judgment is proper when no genuine issue as to any material fact exists, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; \r\n \r\nIn determining whether a triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).&nbsp; If evidentiary facts are not disputed, but the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them are, summary judgment should be denied. Â Baugus v. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 415, 401 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1991).&nbsp; Summary judgment is not appropriate when further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of law.&nbsp; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nDickey assigns several points of error to the trial courtâ€™s grant of the Nursing Homeâ€™s motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations. Â In response, the Nursing Home contends that any cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations.Â  The Nursing Home further claims that Dickey, in his individual capacity, cannot pursue these causes of action.Â  We agree with the Nursing Home.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nAt the trial level, Dickey asserted claims for wrongful death, negligence, gross negligence, and breach of contract.Â  We address each claim in turn. \r\n \r\nI. Wrongful Death\r\nThe wrongful death statute provides a remedy for the spouse, child, parent, or heir of an injured party when a person commits a wrongful or negligent act causing the injured partyâ€™s death.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-51-10, 15-51-20 (Supp. 2005).Â  Any recovery directly benefits the individual rather than the decedentâ€™s general estate.Â  Lester v. McFaddon, 415 F.2d 1101, 1103 (4th Cir. 1969).Â  However, any recovery under this cause of action constitutes the individualâ€™s complete remedy.Â  See Banks v. Med. Univ. of S.C., 314 S.C. 376, 380, 444 S.E.2d 519, 521 (1994) (holding if a mother brings a claim in her individual capacity for her decedent child, the wrongful death statute is her exclusive remedy); Green v. S. Ry. Co., 319 F. Supp. 919, 919-20 (D.S.C. 1970) (holding recovery under the wrongful death statute is the exclusive remedy for an individual). Â Therefore, Dickeyâ€™s only vehicle to recover for his motherâ€™s death is under the wrongful death statute.Â \r\n \r\nAlthough the wrongful death statute is the only avenue of recovery for Dickey as an individual, such an action inheres only in the PR, and the statutory beneficiaries cannot proceed in their individual capacity.Â  Lester, 415 F.2d at 1103.Â  Under the statute, â€œthe right of action for wrongful death is purely statutory and . . . may be brought only by the executor or administrator of such deceased person.â€Â  Glenn v. E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., 254 S.C. 128, 133, 174 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1970) (citing Lilly v. Charlotte, C. &amp; A. R. Co., 32 S.C. 142, 10 S.E. 932 (1890)); see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-51-20&nbsp;(Supp. 2005) (â€œEvery [wrongful death] action shall be brought by or in the name of the executor or administrator of such person.â€).Â  \r\n \r\nWhile a non-lawyer PR may administer the affairs of an estate and maintain an action on the estateâ€™s behalf, a PR must be a lawyer if the PR intends to represent the estate in court.Â  Brown, 365 S.C. at 141, 616 S.E.2d at 708.Â  Because the estate is a separate legal entity, only a lawyer can represent the interests of the estate and its beneficiaries in court.Â  Id. at 142, 616 S.E.2d at 708 (holding â€œthe filing of a notice of appeal on behalf of the estate and preparation of briefs . . . clearly constitutes the practice of lawâ€).Â  \r\n \r\nConsequently, Dickeyâ€™s appeal on the wrongful death claim in his individual capacity cannot succeed.Â  If an action for wrongful death is instituted by one other than the PR of a decedent, the trial court should dismiss the action.Â  Glenn, 254 S.C. at 134, 174 S.E.2d at 158.Â  Although Dickey could have potentially recovered as an individual under the wrongful death statute if he, as PR, brought the action and a licensed lawyer represented the estate in court, he failed to do so. Â Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed this claim. \r\n \r\nII.Â Negligence and Gross Negligence\r\nDickeyâ€™s claims for negligence and gross negligence arise out of the same alleged malfeasance as that alleged for wrongful death.Â  As explained above, wrongful death is the only remedy for an individual.Â  While as PR he may have had a potential claim for negligence under the survival statute, Dickey has appealed only in his individual capacity.Â  See Banks, 314 S.C. at 381 n.5, 444 S.E.2d at 522 n.5 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-90 (2005)) (â€œAlthough . . . wrongful death is [decedentâ€™s motherâ€™s] exclusive remedy [in her individual capacity], the battery cause of action may be maintained by [the mother] in her representative capacity for [decedent] under the survival statute.â€). Â Consequently, the trial court did not err when it dismissed these claims.\r\nIII. Breach of Contract\r\nDickey claims the Nursing Home breached its contract with his mother when it refused to notify Dickey of regulatory violations, of substandard performance on the part of the Nursing Homeâ€™s employees and personnel, and of any change in conditions regarding his motherâ€™s health.Â  Dickey further claims the Nursing Home, as his motherâ€™s caregiver, extended both implied and express warranties to his mother by virtue of her residence at the Nursing Home.Â  \r\n \r\nHowever, Dickey has appealed only in his individual capacity, and he does not specifically assert that he had a contract with the Nursing Home nor does he provide such a contract.Â  Generally, a third person not in privity of contract with the contracting parties does not have a right to enforce the contract.Â  Wogan v. Kunze, 366 S.C. 583, 604, 623 S.E.2d 107, 118 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  While his mother may have had a contract with the Nursing Home,[6] Dickey in his individual capacity cannot enforce such a contract, and thus, he has no cause of action for breach of contract.Â  \r\n \r\nOn appeal, the Nursing Home primarily argues that this Court should affirm the trial court based on the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  The Nursing Home further supports its position by arguing that Dickey, in his personal capacity, is not entitled to maintain the current action.Â  See \r\nIâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt.

Â \r\nIn June 2002, Wife filed an action for\r\n  separate maintenance.Â  In March 2003, Wife filed an amended complaint seeking\r\n  divorce on the ground of adultery.Â  After a hearing, the family court: (1) found\r\n  Wife was entitled to a divorce on the ground of adultery; (2) ordered Husband\r\n  to pay $10,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife; (3) gave Wife sole custody of the\r\n  children; (4) ordered Husband to pay child support in the amount of $286 per\r\n  month through the court, plus the 5% administrative service charge; (5)\r\n  equitably divided the marital property; (6) determined Husbandâ€™s Navy Federal\r\n  Credit Union accounts and Charleston Naval Shipyard Federal Credit Union\r\n  accounts were marital property; (7) ordered the marital home to be sold and the\r\n  proceeds divided equally after Husband received $38,808.85 (because Wife had\r\n  more assets); (8) ordered Husband to pay one-half the fair market rental value\r\n  of the marital house to Wife for the time he remained in the house, beginning\r\n  ninety days after the date of the court order; (9) determined Husband had no\r\n  interest in Wifeâ€™s house; and (10) determined Husband would receive the Toyota\r\n  Rav-4 valued at $9,000.Â  Husband filed a motion to alter or amend the family\r\n  courtâ€™s judgment, which was generally denied.[1]Â \r\nThis appeal follows.Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the factual determinations of the family court, an\r\n  appellate court may take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Scott\r\n    v. Scott, 354\r\n  S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623 (2003).Â  However, â€œthe appellate courtâ€™s broad scope of review does not relieve the\r\n  appellant of the burden of showing that the family court committed error.â€Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 62, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006).Â  Also, when evidence is disputed, the appellate court may adhere to the\r\n  findings of the family court, which is in a superior position to judge the\r\nwitnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;Adultery\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in finding he\r\n  committed adultery.Â  Specifically, Husband asserts there was no evidence of his\r\ninclination to commit adultery.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œTo obtain a divorce on the ground of adultery, the evidence\r\n  establishing the adultery â€˜must be clear and positive, and the infidelity must\r\n  be established by a clear preponderance of the evidence.â€™â€Â  Nemeth v. Nemeth, 325 S.C. 480, 484, 481 S.E.2d 181, 183 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting Brown v. Brown, 215 S.C. 502, 512-13, 56 S.E.2d 330, 335 (1949)).Â  â€œAdultery\r\n  may be proved by circumstantial evidence, or by direct evidence, or a\r\n  combination of the two; and circumstantial evidence is just as good as direct\r\nevidence if it is equally convincing.â€Â  Anders v. Anders, 285 S.C. 512, 515, 331 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1985).Â  \r\nThe proof of adultery â€œmust\r\n  be sufficiently definite to identify the time and place of the offense, and the\r\n  circumstances under which it was committed.â€Â  Nemeth, 325 S.C. at 484, 481 S.E.2d at 183.Â  â€œCircumstantial evidence showing the opportunity and inclination to\r\ncommit adultery is sufficient to establish a prima facie case.â€Â  Id.\r\nAt trial, Wife argued Husband had an affair with Maria\r\n  Garcia.Â  In support of her position, Wife presented items she found in June\r\n  2002 in the marital home.Â  Wife submitted various romantic cards allegedly from\r\n  Garcia to Husband.Â  One card states, â€œI miss you.Â  My heart aches for you.Â  My\r\n  stomach is in knots because weâ€™re apart.â€Â  Another reads, â€œThereâ€™s only one\r\n  good thing about us being apart, The â€˜welcome backâ€™ sex is gonna be great!!â€Â \r\n  The cards are signed either â€œMaria â€˜Bragaâ€™â€ or â€œCeu,â€ Garciaâ€™s middle name.Â \r\n  Also, Wife introduced a book entitled, â€œ101 Nights of Great Sex,â€ which she\r\n  alleged came from Garcia.Â  In addition, Wife presented three pages from an\r\ninstant messaging exchange;[2] the exchange is between â€œCeushinhaâ€ and â€œJCFMSoccer.â€Â  \r\nWife testified Garciaâ€™s â€œemail nameâ€ is â€œCeushinhaâ€\r\n  and Husbandâ€™s â€œemail nameâ€ is â€œJCFMSoccer.â€Â  The instant message text suggests\r\n  the parties to the exchange have passionate feelings for each other and have\r\n  been intimate.Â  At one point, Ceushina said, â€œTell me I never called you by his\r\n  name when we were making loveâ€ to which JCFM replied, â€œYes, you did,\r\n  subconsciously things happen!â€Â  Further, Wife testified that in June 2002, she\r\n  found blue lingerie that was not hers in the marital home.Â  Finally, Wife\r\n  offered a video and witness testimony that suggest Garcia stayed overnight with\r\nHusband in July 2002.Â  \r\nIn contrast, Husband averred he and Garcia are long-time\r\n  friends and have never had romantic feelings for one another.Â  Husband admitted\r\n  he and Garcia spent three nights together at his house in July 2002.Â  However,\r\n  Husband explained he and Garcia slept in different bedrooms throughout Garciaâ€™s\r\n  stay.Â  Moreover, Husband testified Garcia intended to stay only a few hours but\r\n  unexpectedly extended her stay because she became ill.Â  Also, Husband testified\r\n  he had never seen the sex book or romantic cards Garcia allegedly sent to him.Â \r\n  Similarly, Husband testified he did not recognize the instant message exchange\r\nintroduced by Wife.Â  \r\nHusband also provided Garciaâ€™s deposition testimony to\r\n  further refute Wifeâ€™s contention.Â  Garcia testified she and Husband are like\r\n  brother and sister.Â  In addition, Garcia testified she visited Husband in July\r\n  2002 when she was en route to visit her boyfriend.Â  Garcia averred she planned\r\n  to stay only a few hours but stayed longer because she began to feel ill.Â \r\n  Garcia testified she and Husband stayed in separate bedrooms.Â  Further, Garcia\r\n  testified she did not recall sending any romantic cards or sex books to\r\n  Husband; however, Garcia admitted that the handwriting in two of the cards\r\nlooked like hers.Â  \r\nWe find the record provides sufficient evidence to\r\n  support the family courtâ€™s finding that Husband committed adultery.Â  First, it\r\n  is undisputed that Husband had the opportunity to commit adultery with Garcia\r\n  in July 2002.Â  Second, the romantic cards, the instant messaging exchange, the\r\n  sex book, and the unclaimed lingerie all suggest Husband was inclined to commit\r\n  adultery with Garcia.Â  We concur with and adhere to the family courtâ€™s findings\r\n  in this instance.Â  Woodall, 322 S.C. at 10, 471 S.E.2d at 157 (holding â€œthe appellate court may adhere to the findings of the trial judge\r\n  who . . . was in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and\r\n  veracityâ€).Â  Therefore, we find the family court did not err in\r\nholding Husband committed adultery. \r\nII.&nbsp; Alimony\r\nHusband next asserts that if we hold the family court\r\n  erred in finding Husband committed adultery, we must remand Husbandâ€™s claim for\r\n  alimony.Â  We will not address this issue because of our disposition on the\r\n  first issue.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889\r\n  (1993) (stating this Court does not need to address remaining issues when\r\nresolution of a prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Toyota Rav-4\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in awarding the\r\n  Toyota Rav-4 to Husband and in failing to account for the pendente lite depreciation of the vehicle.Â  We find the family court did not err in awarding\r\nHusband the Rav-4 but did err in its valuation of the vehicle.Â Â  \r\nHusband\r\n  and Wife purchased the Rav-4 in 1999.Â  Wife sought temporary and permanent\r\n  possession of the Rav-4 in both her initial and amended complaints.Â  The family\r\n  court awarded Wife possession of the Rav-4 during the pendency of this action.Â \r\n  Throughout this case, Wife possessed and used the Rav-4.Â  \r\nWifeâ€™s\r\n  initial financial declaration, submitted in November 2002, listed the value of\r\n  the Rav-4 at $9,000.Â  Wifeâ€™s amended financial declaration, submitted at trial\r\n  in July 2004, valued the Rav-4 at $4,000.Â  The family court awarded the Rav-4\r\n  to Husband, valuing it at $9,000.Â  \r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;Award of Rav-4 to Husband\r\nGenerally, â€œ[t]he apportionment of\r\n  marital property is within the family court judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Doe v.\r\n    Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 502, 478 S.E.2d 854, 859 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In making an equitable distribution of marital property, the\r\n  family court must, among other things: (1) identify the marital property, both\r\n  real and personal, to be divided between the parties; (2) determine the fair\r\n  market value of the identified property; (3) apportion the marital estate\r\n  according to the contributions, both direct and indirect, of each party to the\r\n  acquisition of the property during the marriage, their respective assets and\r\n  incomes, and any special equities they may have in marital assets; and (4)\r\n  provide for an equitable division of the marital estate, including the manner\r\nin which the distribution is to take place. Â Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 197, 612 S.E.2d 707, 715 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nIn addition, the family court must consider fifteen criteria\r\n  specified by section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), weighing\r\n  each as it finds appropriate based on the facts of the case.Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 297, 372 S.E.2d 107, 112 (Ct. App. 1988). Â â€œThese\r\n  criteria guide the court in exercising its discretion over apportionment of the\r\n  marital propertyâ€ and â€œare nothing more than equities to\r\n  be considered in reaching a fair distribution of marital property.â€Â  Id. at 297-98, 372 S.E.2d at 112.Â  â€œOn review of an equitable apportionment of\r\n  marital property, this [C]ourt looks to the fairness of the overall\r\n  apportionment and if the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that this\r\n  [C]ourt might have weighed specific factors differently than the trial [C]ourt.â€Â  Doe, 324 S.C. at 502, 478\r\nS.E.2d at 859.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nWe find the family court did not commit an abuse of discretion in\r\n  awarding the Rav-4 to Husband. Â The family courtâ€™s order provides that in\r\n  determining the equitable apportionment of the property, it â€œspecifically\r\n  considered all factors as set forth in 1-15 subparts of South Carolina Code of\r\n  Law Section 20-7-472 and . . . gave weight as the court found appropriate to\r\n  all of the factors enumerated in that statute.â€Â  After consideration of the\r\n  facts in this case, we affirm the family courtâ€™s award.Â  Because Husband did\r\n  not want the Rav-4 does not make the family courtâ€™s award an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  The family court was well within its authority to award the Rav-4,\r\na portion of the marital estate, to Husband.\r\nb.&nbsp; Value of Rav-4\r\nGenerally, â€œfor purposes of equitable distribution, the value of\r\n  marital property is the value of the property at the time of the commencement\r\n  of the marital litigation.â€Â  Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 227,\r\n  512 S.E.2d 539, 541 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œIt is equally true, however, that the\r\n  parties may be entitled to share in any appreciation or depreciation in marital assets occurring after separation\r\n  but before divorce.â€Â  Fields v. Fields, 342 S.C. 182, 186, 536 S.E.2d 684, 686 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In cases when a substantial delay exists between the commencement\r\n  of the action and its ultimate resolution, â€œthe family court has the ability to\r\n  consider the post-filing appreciation or depreciation when valuing and\r\n  apportioning the marital estate.â€Â  Dixon, 334 S.C. at 228, 512 S.E.2d at\r\n542. Â Â \r\nIn cases when it would be â€œgrossly unfairâ€ to value a marital\r\n  asset at the time of the commencement of the action, the family court may value\r\n  the asset at the time of trial.Â  Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C.\r\n  141, 151, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In all instances, when\r\n  reviewing the valuation of a marital asset, the appellate court looks to the\r\n  overall fairness of the distribution award.Â  Id. (citing Johnson,\r\n  296 S.C. at 300, 372 S.E.2d at 113). In Mallet, this Court affirmed the\r\n  family courtâ€™s valuation of a business at the time of trial, which had\r\n  depreciated through no fault of either party, because we found it would be\r\n  â€œgrossly unfairâ€ to value the asset as of the date of the commencement of the\r\naction.Â  Id.Â  \r\nUnder the facts of this case, we find it would be grossly unfair\r\n  to value the Rav-4 at the time the action commenced.Â  The Rav-4 diminished\r\n  substantially in value from $9,000 to $4,000 during the course of this action,\r\n  which began in June\r\n  2002 and concluded over two years later in September 2004.Â  Moreover, the depreciation presumably occurred through no fault of\r\n  either party.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court committed an error in\r\n  valuing the Rav-4 at $9,000.Â  To make the end result equitable, the Rav-4\r\n  should have been valued at $4,000, the value at the time of the trial.Â \r\nAccordingly, we modify the family courtâ€™s order to reflect this finding.\r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;Husbandâ€™s Navy Federal\r\nCredit Union accounts\r\nHusband alleges the family court erred in finding his\r\n  bank accounts with the Navy Federal Credit Union were marital assets.Â  We\r\nagree. \r\nThroughout their marriage, Husband and\r\n  Wife maintained a household account and separate, individual bank accounts.Â  Husband\r\n  maintained numerous accounts that he testified stemmed from monies given to him\r\n  prior to his marriage.Â  Regarding the Navy Federal accounts, Husband testified\r\n  the source of these funds traced back to various accounts opened between 1978\r\n  and 1984.Â  Husband further testified his father provided the initial funds for\r\n  these accounts.Â  In addition, Husband averred Wife never had access to these\r\n  accounts, and he never intended for them to become marital property.Â  Wife\r\n  similarly testified, â€œAt all points in time, I had my separate accounts.Â  He\r\n  had his separate accounts and\r\n  there was a house account.â€Â  The family court found these accounts were marital\r\nproperty and included them in the equitable apportionment.Â  \r\nWe note that despite Wifeâ€™s contention to\r\n  the contrary, this issue is preserved for our review.Â  â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time\r\n  on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71,\r\n  76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  Here, Husband clearly raised the issue at\r\n  trial, as evidenced by his trial brief and testimony, and the family court\r\n  ruled the accounts were marital assets.Â  Wife asserts Husband waived his right to appeal this issue\r\n  because he agreed at the hearing on his motion to alter or amend the judgment\r\n  that the partiesâ€™ joint account with Navy Federal Credit Union should be\r\n  equitably divided.Â  However, Husbandâ€™s\r\n  agreeing to the division of the partiesâ€™ joint account has no bearing on the\r\ndivision of his individual accounts.Â  \r\nOn the merits, the family court â€œdoes not\r\n  have jurisdiction or authority to apportion nonmarital property.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2005).Â  Marital property â€œmeans all real and personal property which has\r\n  been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the\r\n  date of filing or commencement of marital litigation as provided in Â§\r\n  20-7-472 regardless of how legal title is held . . . .â€Â  Id.Â  However,\r\n  property acquired before the marriage is generally nonmarital.Â  Â§ 20-7-473(2).Â \r\n  â€œIn certain circumstances, nonmarital property, as defined by the Act, may be\r\n  transmuted into marital property during the marriage.â€Â  Johnson,\r\n  296 S.C. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 110.Â  In all cases, â€œ[t]he spouse\r\n  claiming an equitable interest in property upon dissolution of the marriage has\r\n  the burden of proving the property is part of the marital estate.â€Â  Johnson,\r\n296 S.C. at 294, 372 S.E.2d at 110.\r\nWe find Wife failed to meet her initial\r\n  burden of proving Husbandâ€™s Navy Federal accounts were marital assets.Â  The\r\n  record is devoid of any evidence suggesting funds in these accounts were\r\n  attained during the marriage.Â  Also, no evidence was presented to suggest these\r\n  accounts were transmuted into marital property.Â  In fact, the only testimony\r\n  regarding these accounts provided the accounts originated solely from\r\n  premarital funds and were maintained exclusively by Husband.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  find the family court erred in including Husbandâ€™s Navy Federal accounts as\r\n  part of the marital assets.Â  Thus, we reverse this portion of the family\r\ncourtâ€™s order to reflect our finding.\r\nV.&nbsp;&nbsp;Division of Husbandâ€™s\r\nNavy Federal Credit Union accounts\r\nHusband asserts that if the Navy Federal\r\n  Credit Union accounts were marital property, the family court erred in dividing\r\n  them on a 50/50 basis.Â  Because\r\n  Husbandâ€™s Navy Federal accounts were nonmarital property, we need not address this issue. See Whiteside,\r\n  311 S.C. at 340, 428 S.E.2d at 889 (stating appellate court need not address\r\nremaining issues when resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\nVI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wifeâ€™s withdrawal of $17,248\r\nfrom marital account and Husbandâ€™s equity interest in Wifeâ€™s house\r\nHusband next asserts the family court erred in failing to give\r\n  Wife a $17,000[3] credit for funds she allegedly withdrew from the partiesâ€™ marital account.Â \r\n  Further, Husband claims her use of these marital funds to purchase items for\r\nher new house gave Husband an equity interest in Wifeâ€™s house.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nWife argues this issue is not\r\n  properly preserved for our review.Â  Wife contends the family court did not\r\n  specifically rule on this issue, and Husband clearly failed to raise any\r\n  arguments relating to Wifeâ€™s alleged dissipation of marital funds from the\r\npartiesâ€™ joint account in his post-trial motion.Â  \r\nIf a party wants to raise an issue on appeal, the party has the\r\n  responsibility to establish that the issue was raised to and ruled upon by the\r\n  family court.Â  See e.g., Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733 (â€œIt is axiomatic that\r\n  an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review.â€).Â  If the family court fails to rule upon an issue, the party then must\r\n  raise the issue in a Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Failure to do so prevents this Court from\r\n  addressing it on appeal due to issue preservation principles.[4] Â See Iâ€˜On v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422-23,\r\n  526 S.E.2d 716, 725 (2000) (stating parties should raise all necessary issues\r\n  and arguments to trial court and attempt to obtain a ruling on those issues); Noisette\r\n    v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (ruling issue was\r\n  not preserved for appellate review when the trial court did not explicitly rule\r\n  on the appellantâ€™s argument and the appellant made no Rule 59(e) motion to\r\nalter or amend the judgment).\r\nEven though the family court did not explicitly rule on this\r\n  issue, based on the overall apportionment, we find the family court correctly\r\n  accounted for the $17,248 in its order. Â Further, we hold the family court appropriately\r\ndeclined to award Husband an equity interest in Wifeâ€™s home.Â  \r\nThe crux of Husbandâ€™s argument is the $17,000 credit to Wifeâ€™s\r\n  bank account in the family courtâ€™s final order pertained to a January 2004\r\n  order releasing funds and requiring the parties to equally divide a marital\r\n  account as a second advance on equitable distribution.Â  Husband claims the\r\n  family court failed to credit Husband his marital share of Wifeâ€™s $17,248 in\r\n  expenditures as it only accounted for Wifeâ€™s $17,000 share of the advance on\r\nequitable distribution from the January order.\r\nBased on our review of the evidence, we find the $17,000 credit to\r\n  both Wife and Husband in the final order related to the prior advance on\r\n  equitable distribution.Â  The January order to release funds required an equal\r\n  split of the marital account, and Husband alleges Wife improperly spent $17,248.\r\n  Â It is more likely the family court was referencing the January order.Â \r\n  Further, the final order states Wife â€œreceivedâ€ $17,000 from Husbandâ€™s account.Â \r\n  This language tends to indicate the family court allowed Wife to access those\r\n  funds.Â  Because Husband alleged Wife improperly dissipated the marital estate,\r\n  we surmise the family court would not have chosen this specific language if it\r\nwas attempting to resolve the issue of Wifeâ€™s expenditures.Â  \r\nLooking at the overall apportionment of the marital estate, we\r\n  find the family courtâ€™s equitable distribution award accounted for all the relevant\r\n  facts, including Wifeâ€™s expenditures. Â At trial, Wife admitted she removed\r\n  approximately $17,248 from the coupleâ€™s marital account between April 2001 and\r\n  June 2002.Â  Wife further acknowledged that a portion of this money was used to\r\n  purchase appliances and/or â€œthingsâ€ for her new home.Â  Wife also testified the\r\n  $42,000 down payment for her house came from her father.Â  Wife further stated\r\nHusband contributed nothing to the purchase of her house.Â  \r\nThe family court found that $9,341.73 of the equity in Wifeâ€™s\r\n  house constituted â€œmarital portions.â€Â  Nevertheless, the family court held Wife\r\n  was entitled to 100% of the marital portions of Wifeâ€™s house because Husband\r\n  â€œhas used the marital residence during this entire litigation without having to\r\n  pay any mortgage and the wife had to make the mortgage payments of $1,190.76 a\r\nmonth with no help from husband . . . .â€Â  \r\nWe recognize when â€œone spouse has dissipated marital assets, the\r\n  court will value the assets as of some date before the dissipation and treat\r\n  the dissipated assets as part of the dissipating spouseâ€™s share of the marital\r\n  estate.â€ Â Dixon, 334 S.C. at 232, 512 S.E.2d at 544.Â  However, we find\r\n  Husbandâ€™s actions counterbalanced those of Wifeâ€™s, which the family court\r\n  considered in its final order, resulting in Wifeâ€™s receipt of 100% of the\r\n  marital portions of Wifeâ€™s house. Â As stated above, â€œ[t]he apportionment of marital property is\r\n  within the family court judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Doe, 324 S.C. at 502, 478 S.E.2d at 859.Â  On review of an equitable apportionment of marital property, this Court\r\n  looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment, and if the end result is\r\n  equitable, it is irrelevant that this Court might have weighed specific statutory\r\nfactors differently than the family court.Â  Id.\r\nThus, we find the family court did not commit an abuse of\r\n  discretion in making its equitable distribution award as it relates to the\r\n$17,248 and in denying Husband an equity interest in Wifeâ€™s house.Â Â Â  \r\nVII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Husbandâ€™s contribution\r\nto the marital house\r\nHusband next contends the family court\r\n  erred in equitably apportioning the marital house.Â  Specifically, Husband\r\n  argues the family court failed to give appropriate weight to Husbandâ€™s\r\npre-marital contributions to the marital house.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe record indicates Husbandâ€™s and Wifeâ€™s\r\n  down payment on the marital house totaled $6,695.85.Â  Wife testified she and\r\n  Husband â€œboth put down about the same amount of money for the house,â€ and her\r\n  portion came from her retirement account.Â  In addition, Wife testified the\r\n  marital home was paid off in equal amounts by the parties.Â  Husband gave no\r\n  direct testimony about the down payment on the marital house. Â Instead, Husband\r\n  asserts the coupleâ€™s mortgage application, which indicates the couple had\r\n  $23,247.12 in cash, is evidence Husband made substantial pre-marital\r\n  contributions to the purchase of the marital home.Â  Wife testified the majority\r\n  of the cash-in-hand represented on the credit application must have been\r\nHusbandâ€™s.Â  \r\nInitially, Wife argues this issue is not\r\n  preserved for review.Â  However, the equitable apportionment of the marital home\r\n  was an issue for the family court, and the court unmistakably held both parties\r\n  have an equal interest in the marital house.Â  See e.g., Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733 (â€œIt is axiomatic that\r\n  an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review.â€).Â Â \r\nDespite Wifeâ€™s contention, this issue is preserved for our review.Â  \r\nOn the merits, we find the family court\r\n  did not commit an abuse of discretion in equitably apportioning the marital\r\n  house.Â  The record clearly provides the total down payment by the parties did\r\n  not exceed $5,500. Â Moreover, Husbandâ€™s contention that the credit application\r\nevidences that he made â€œsubstantialâ€ contributions is baseless.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHusbandâ€™s $34,000 loan from father\r\nHusband next argues the family court erred\r\n  in failing to apportion the $34,000 loan Husband allegedly received from his\r\nfather to pay off the mortgage on the marital home.Â  We disagree. \r\nIn January 1997, Husband and Wife paid off\r\n  the remaining mortgage on the marital house, totaling approximately $68,000.Â \r\n  Husband and Wife agreed to each pay half of the remaining mortgage.Â  Wifeâ€™s\r\n  portion came from the household account.Â  Husband testified his father loaned\r\n  him $34,000 to pay his portion.Â  Husband also testified he told Wife he had to\r\n  borrow the money from his father.Â  Similarly, Wife admitted Husband informed\r\nher that his father could lend him the money to pay off the mortgage.Â  \r\nWe find this issue is not preserved for\r\n  our review.Â  The family court did not rule on the issue of Husbandâ€™s alleged\r\n  loan, and the issue was not raised in Husbandâ€™s motion to alter or amend.Â  An issue is not preserved when a party raises\r\n  an issue, but the issue is never ruled on by the trial court, and the party\r\n  fails to file a motion to alter or amend raising the issue.Â  S.C. Farm\r\n    Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.E.C.U.R.E. Underwriters Risk Retention Group, 347\r\nS.C. 333, 334, 554 S.E.2d 870, 875 (Ct. App. 2001). Â Â \r\nVIII.&nbsp;Selling of marital house\r\nHusband next asserts the family court\r\n  erred in failing to allow Husband to keep the marital house as part of the\r\nequitable division.Â  We disagree. \r\nHusband has lived in the marital house\r\n  since 1986.Â  Husbandâ€™s financial declaration provides the value of the marital\r\n  house in July 2004 was $185,000.Â  Similarly, Wifeâ€™s amended financial\r\n  declaration, presented at the time of trial, provides the approximate market\r\n  value of the marital house was $185,000.Â  The court ordered the parties to sell\r\n  the marital house and to equitably divide the proceeds from the sale after\r\n  offsetting Wifeâ€™s excess assets.Â  In his motion to alter or amend, Husband\r\n  asked the family court to provide him with the option to buy out Wifeâ€™s\r\ninterest in the marital house.Â  The family court denied Husbandâ€™s request.Â  \r\nâ€œTo effect an equitable division of property, the family court may\r\n  require the sale of the marital home.â€Â  Craig\r\n    v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d\r\n  359, 361 (2005).Â  However, â€œ[b]efore ordering marital\r\n  property be sold, the court should first try to make an â€˜in-kindâ€™ distribution\r\n  of the marital assets.â€ Â Id. Â The family court may grant a spouse title to\r\n  the marital home as part of the equitable distribution or as an award incident\r\n  to support.Â  Id. at 290-91, 617 S.E.2d at 361-62.Â  Nevertheless, â€œ[t]he apportionment of marital property is\r\n  within the family court judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal\r\nabsent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Doe, 324 S.C. at 502, 478 S.E.2d at 859.Â  Â Â Â \r\nWe find the family court did not commit an abuse of discretion in\r\n  ordering the parties to sell the marital house and equitably divide the\r\n  proceeds.Â  The family court considered all of the statutory factors in\r\n  determining that the most appropriate distribution required the sale of the\r\n  marital home.Â  Admittedly, the family courtâ€™s order fails to clearly articulate\r\n  the reason for requiring the parties to sell the marital house.Â  However, upon our\r\n  review of the facts, in particular Husbandâ€™s limited financial resources (both\r\n  present monetary holdings and future earning potential) and the contentious\r\n  relationship between the parties, we find the most appropriate distribution\r\n  requires selling the marital house.Â  Moreover, the family courtâ€™s order does\r\n  not prevent Husband from purchasing the marital home in an armâ€™s length\r\ntransaction.Â  Therefore, we uphold the family courtâ€™s ruling on this issue.Â  \r\nIX.&nbsp;Husbandâ€™s rent\r\non the marital house\r\nHusband next argues the family court erred\r\n  in requiring Husband to reimburse Wife for one-half the fair market rental\r\nvalue of the marital house until it sells.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe family court allowed Husband to remain\r\n  in the marital house after trial but ordered the house be immediately placed on\r\n  the market for sale.Â  In addition, the family court held that if the marital\r\n  house did not sell within ninety days, Husband would be liable to Wife for half\r\n  the rental value of the marital house until the house was sold.Â  The family\r\n  court stipulated that Husbandâ€™s rental payments may be taken out of the\r\nproceeds from the sale of the marital house.Â  \r\nWe find the family court did not commit an\r\n  abuse of discretion in ordering Husband to pay Wife half the rental value of\r\n  the marital house.Â  Husband asserts Wife is not entitled to both rent and any\r\n  increased equity in the marital house during this period because Husband is\r\n  paying the expenses and taxes on the marital house.Â  We find this contention to\r\nbe without merit.Â  \r\nTo support his position, Husband cites to McDavid v. McDavid,\r\n  333 S.C. 490, 511 S.E.2d 365 (1999).Â  In McDavid, the Supreme Court held\r\n  the husband was not entitled to a share in the increased equity of the marital\r\n  home between the time of separation and the time of trial when the husband did\r\n  not contribute to the mortgage payments during this period.Â  Id. at 497,\r\n  511 S.E.2d at 369. Â Husbandâ€™s reliance on McDavid is misplaced.Â  In this\r\n  case, unlike in McDavid, Husband who is residing in the marital house is\r\n  not continuing to pay a mortgage.Â  In contrast, Husband and Wife equally paid off the\r\n  mortgage on the marital house and thus have equal rights to any increased\r\n  equity in the house.Â  Any expenses Husband incurs associated with the upkeep of\r\n  the marital house are related to daily living and do not substantially\r\n  contribute to any increase in value.Â  Moreover, as the family court noted,\r\n  Husband has lived in the marital house rent free throughout the duration of\r\n  this case.Â  Accordingly, we find the overall apportionment of the marital\r\nproperty, including the requirement that Husband pay rent, is appropriate.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nX.&nbsp;Health\r\nInsurance\r\nHusband alleges the family court erred in\r\n  crediting Wife with health insurance costs.Â  Specifically, Husband asserts the\r\n  child support guidelines require that his free medical care, which he receives\r\n  as a disabled veteran, should have been selected as the best coverage.Â  Husband\r\n  further contends the family court committed an error of law in failing to make\r\n  written findings to justify its deviation from the child support guidelines.Â \r\nWe disagree. \r\nThe family court credited Wife with $115 per month in medical\r\n  insurance costs for the children.Â  In his motion to alter or amend, Husband\r\n  alleged his coverage is comprehensive, free, and cannot be cancelled, and thus,\r\n  it should have been used to provide coverage.Â  Wife responded by asserting that\r\n  the primary health insurance for the children has always been her plan, and\r\n  Husbandâ€™s coverage has various limitations which prevent access and coverage. Â The\r\n  court denied Husbandâ€™s motion to alter or amend Wifeâ€™s credit for insurance\r\ncosts.Â  \r\nIn determining health insurance coverage\r\n  for children, â€œ[o]rdinarily, the\r\n  court should require coverage by that parent who can obtain the most comprehensive\r\n  coverage through an employer or otherwise, at the most reasonable cost.â€Â  27 S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(12) (Supp. 2006).Â  In this case, while both Husband and\r\n  Wife are able to provide health insurance, the record fails to provide any detailed\r\n  information about eitherâ€™s coverage.Â  Husband has presented no evidence to\r\n  demonstrate that Wifeâ€™s plan is not the â€œmost comprehensive coverageâ€ as\r\n  required by South Carolina regulations.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court\r\n  did not err in crediting Wife with health insurance costs.Â  See Medlock, 322\r\n  S.C. at 132, 470 S.E.2d at 376 (stating the appellant has the burden of\r\n  presenting a record sufficient to allow the appellate court to make a\r\ndecision).\r\nXI.&nbsp;Child support\r\npayments through the court\r\nHusband next asserts the family court\r\n  erred in requiring him to make support payments through the court, and thereby\r\nincur an additional 5% service charge.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 20-7-420(A)(21)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides that the family court has\r\n  exclusive jurisdiction â€œto\r\n  determine the manner in which sums ordered paid for support shall be paid and\r\n  applied, either to a person through the court, through the clerk of court, or\r\n  through a centralized wage withholding system if required by federal statute or\r\n  regulation.â€Â  The family court held Husband must pay child support to the Wife\r\n  through the court by the first of each month and denied Husbandâ€™s motion to\r\nalter or amend this ruling.Â  \r\nThe parties have a contentious\r\n  relationship and requiring payments through the court may help limit future\r\n  disagreements.Â  In addition, the record indicates Husband has not always been\r\n  timely with his payments.Â  Thus, we find the family court did not err in\r\nordering Husband to make support payments through the court.Â Â Â  \r\nXII.&nbsp;Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nFinally, Husband asserts that if this\r\n  opinion alters the family courtâ€™s ruling in his favor, we should remand the\r\nissue of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs for reconsideration.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œIn determining whether an attorneyâ€™s fee should be awarded, the\r\n  following factors should be considered: (1) the partyâ€™s ability\r\n    to pay his/her own attorneyâ€™s fee; (2)\r\n  beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3)\r\n  the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions; (4) effect of the attorneyâ€™s fee\r\n  on each partyâ€™s standard of living.â€Â  E.D.M.\r\n    v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 76-77, 415 S.E.2d\r\n  812, 816 (1992).Â  The beneficial result obtained by\r\n  counsel is an essential factor in determining whether an attorneyâ€™s fee should\r\n  be awarded.Â  Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 503, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666\r\n(1993).Â  \r\nIn this case, we modify the family courtâ€™s\r\n  valuation of the Rav-4 and reverse its finding that Husbandâ€™s Navy Federal\r\n  Credit Union accounts were marital property.Â  However, the overall holdings of\r\n  the family court, namely the equitable division of marital property, the denial\r\n  of Husbandâ€™s request for alimony, and Husbandâ€™s requirement to pay child\r\n  support, are affirmed.Â  Moreover, the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  to Wife was largely based on its finding that Husband was primarily responsible\r\n  for the unnecessary delay in the proceedings and that Husband was not entitled\r\n  to alimony. Â Our decision does not impact either of these findings.Â \r\n  Accordingly, under these facts and our overall disposition of the case, we\r\naffirm the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the family court did not\r\n  err in (1) finding Husband committed adultery; (2) refusing to award alimony to\r\n  Husband; (3) failing to credit Wife with $17,248 that she removed from marital\r\n  account; (4) failing to award Husband equity in Wifeâ€™s house; (5) equitably\r\n  dividing the partiesâ€™ interest in the marital house; (6) failing to apportion\r\n  Husbandâ€™s alleged $34,000 loan; (7) ordering the sale of the marital home; (8)\r\n  ordering Husband to pay half the rental value of the marital house to Wife for the\r\n  time he remains in the house beyond ninety days after trial; (9) crediting Wife\r\n  with health insurance costs; (10) ordering Husband to pay child support payments\r\n  through the court; and (11) awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Wife.Â  \r\nWe also hold the family court erred in\r\n  valuing the Toyota Rav-4 at $9,000 and in finding Husbandâ€™s Navy Federal Credit\r\n  Union accounts were part of the marital estate.Â  After adjusting the value of\r\n  the Rav-4 from $9,000 to $4,000 and removing Husbandâ€™s accounts from the\r\n  marital estate, Husband is entitled to $55,676 while Wife is entitled to\r\n  $138,893.58.Â  Therefore, Wife has $83,217.58 more of the assets to be divided\r\n  than does Husband.Â  Husband is still required to pay $10,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  to Wife.Â  Thus, Husband will receive the first $73,217.58 of the proceeds from\r\n  the marital residence. Â The remainder of such proceeds, less any rent Husband\r\n  owes to Wife, will be divided equally between the parties.Â  Accordingly, the\r\norder of the family court isÂ  \r\nAFFIRMED in PART, REVERSED in PART, and MODIFIED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  BEATTY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The family court modified its original order to some\r\n  extent, but for the most part, it denied Husbandâ€™s motion.Â  \r\n[2] At trial, Wife referenced the exhibit as an email;\r\n  however, the document appears to be more akin to an instant message exchange.\r\n[3]Â  Husband argues Wife improperly spent $17,000 in\r\n  marital funds.Â  We reference the $17,000 at the outset to reflect Husbandâ€™s argument,\r\n  but based on trial testimony and the record, we note the actual amount dissipated\r\n  from the marital estate by Wife is $17,248.Â  (R. at 363-64). \r\n[4] The appellant has the burden of presenting a record\r\n  sufficient to allow the appellate court to make a decision.Â  Medlock v.
