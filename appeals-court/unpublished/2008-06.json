James Muhammad, (Wright) was mentally\r\n  ill.Â  Wright appeals, we\r\n  dismiss this appeal. Â \r\nFACTS\r\nWright was found not guilty by reason of insanity of assault and\r\n  battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  Wright was committed to the\r\n  Department of Mental Health (the Department).Â  Wright was conditionally\r\n  discharged from the Department in July 1999 and readmitted in June 2004.Â \r\n  Wright was again conditionally discharged in April 2005 and readmitted in\r\n  November 2005 as a result of noncompliance with prior discharge orders.Â  \r\nA hearing was held to determine whether Wright should remain\r\n  hospitalized or be conditionally discharged.Â  The lower court found by clear\r\n  and convincing evidence that Wright was mentally ill and ordered him to remain\r\n  committed for treatment.Â  Wright argues the lower courtâ€™s decision is in\r\n  error.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe maximum length of supervision or confinement for an individual\r\n  found not guilty by reason of insanity is limited to the maximum sentence the\r\n  individual could have received for the charged offense.Â  S.C.

Construction, Inc. (JCC), a general construction\r\n  company, successfully submitted a bid for a project to refurbish a waste water\r\n  treatment facility for the Town of St. Matthews, South Carolina.Â  One aspect of\r\n  the workload required JCC to remove and dispose of sludge from the treatment facilityâ€™s\r\n  basins.Â  To effectuate the sludge removal, JCC solicited bids for this portion\r\n  of the work and subcontracted with Appellant Environmental Solutions\r\n  International, Inc. (ESI) in November 2003.Â  ESI agreed to payment of $108.00\r\n  per ton of sludge removed.Â  The scope of the sludge removal was based on an\r\n  estimate by Woolpert, L.L.P. (Woolpert), an engineering consultant hired by the\r\n  town, and was limited by the terms of the contract.Â  Under the subcontract, ESI\r\n  was required to:\r\n\r\n  Remove, solidify, transport and dispose\r\n    of approximately 350 tons of waste treatment sludge.Â  Payment to be determined\r\n    by measure of sludge hauled to the landfill.Â  The unit cost rate of $108.00 per\r\n    ton hauled shall apply (as per the project bid form).Â  Approximate total\r\n    commitment for accounting purposes only is $37,800.00.\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n  contracting with JCC, ESI hired Wolfe Creek Construction, Inc. (Wolfe Creek) to\r\n  perform the actual removal.Â  In December 2003, ESI and Wolfe Creek began the\r\n  removal process.Â  A number of delays plagued the project from the beginning\r\n  resulting from leakage in sludge dewatering containers, inclement weather, and\r\n  the lengthy process required to dry the sludge.Â  Additionally, the total amount\r\n  of sludge requiring removal greatly exceeded the scope originally estimated by\r\n  Woolpert.Â  In response to this discovery, ESI submitted a change order to JCC,\r\n  increasing the scope of removal from 350 tons to 5,000 tons to reflect\r\n  Woolpertâ€™s error in the original estimate.\r\nIn\r\n  April 2004, ESI quit work and left the jobsite, leaving behind a\r\n  partially-filled dewatering bag of sludge, various equipment, and sawdust used\r\n  in solidifying the sludge.Â  In May 2004, ESI faxed JCC a new agreement demanding\r\n  a price increase from $108.00 per ton to $220.00 per ton for the sludge removal.Â \r\n  ESI alleged the price increase was in line with the increased costs associated\r\n  with the larger workload which would require more personnel and different\r\n  equipment in order to meet the project deadlines.Â  JCC never accepted this\r\n  agreement and solicited new bids in order to facilitate the removal.Â  Wolfe\r\n  Creek offered to complete the project, subcontracted with JCC, and completed\r\n  all remaining sludge removal.Â  Wolfe Creek compensated ESI for the materials\r\n  left behind at the jobsite by giving ESI a $10,350.00 credit.Â  The credit memo\r\n  sent to ESI by Wolfe Creek noted the credit was for time, materials, and labor\r\n  exhausted in filling the remaining bag and for three loads of ESIâ€™s sawdust.Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  ESI filed suit against several parties including JCC over the subcontract for\r\n  sludge removal.Â  ESI alleged JCC was liable for breach of contract, quantum\r\n  meruit, conversion, and intentional interference with contractual relations.Â \r\n  JCC moved for summary judgment on all causes of action.Â  At the hearing, ESI\r\n  withdrew its claim of conversion.Â  Subsequently, the trial judge granted JCCâ€™s\r\n  Motion for Summary Judgment as to all of ESIâ€™s claims.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nESI alleges there are genuine issues of\r\n  material fact as to whether it was paid under the contract for (1) the total amount\r\n  of sludge hauled to the landfill and (2) for the sludge pumped into dewatering\r\n  bags but left at the jobsite, and therefore, the grant of summary judgment was\r\n  inappropriate as to the claims for quantum meruit and breach of contract.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nIn order for a motion of summary\r\n  judgment to warrant denial, a triable issue must exist.Â  Worsley Cos., Inc.\r\n    v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 339 S.C. 51, 55, 528 S.E.2d 657, 660 (2000).Â  â€œA\r\n  court considering summary judgment neither makes factual determinations nor\r\n  considers the merits of competing testimony; however, summary judgment is\r\n  completely appropriate when a properly supported motion sets forth facts that\r\n  remain undisputed or are contested in a deficient manner.â€Â  David v. McLeod\r\n    Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 250, 626 S.E.2d 1, 5 (2006). Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  the case at bar, ESI has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact it\r\n  was not compensated for services provided to JCC.Â  The record is barren of\r\n  evidence to support this contention.Â  Therefore, the trial judgeâ€™s grant of\r\n  summary judgment was appropriate.Â  \r\nESI\r\n  alleges it was not paid for the amount of sludge it disposed of according to\r\n  the terms of the contract and for the amount of sludge it pumped into\r\n  dewatering bags and left at the jobsite.Â  However, ESI did not properly support\r\n  these claims to the extent necessary to raise a genuine issue of material\r\n  fact.Â  As in this case, summary judgment is completely appropriate when facts\r\n  are contested in a deficient manner.Â  See David, 367 S.C. at 250,\r\n  626 S.E.2d at 5.\r\n1.Â \r\n  Sludge Removal Fully Performed under the Terms of the Contract\r\nESI alleges that it was not paid for the\r\n  350 tons of sludge removed, transported, and disposed of at the dump.Â  Based on\r\n  our review of the record, this issue is not preserved.Â  Even if preserved, the\r\n  issue fails on the merits.Â  \r\nThis sludge removal was specifically\r\n  covered by the terms of the contract.Â  ESI performed under the contract by\r\n  disposing of approximately 350 tons of sludge and would have a cause of action\r\n  for breach of contract against JCC if JCC failed to pay for these services.Â  However,\r\n  sufficient evidence is not contained in the record to support this contention.Â  \r\nThe cause of action for breach of\r\n  contract requires the plaintiff to establish the following elements:Â  (1) the\r\n  existence of a contract, (2) a breach of the contract, and (3) damages to the\r\n  plaintiff proximately resulting from the breach.Â  Fuller v. Eastern Fire\r\n    &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 240 S.C. 75, 89, 124 S.E.2d 602, 610 (1962).Â  A breach\r\n  occurs when a party to the contract fails to carry out a term, promise, or\r\n  condition of the contract.Â  See Freeman Dodge, Inc. v. Fin. Servs.,\r\n    Inc., 272 S.C. 164, 249 S.E.2d 897 (1978) (finding finance companyâ€™s\r\n  failure to offer car back to dealership as required by the terms of the\r\n  contract was breach).\r\nESI has failed to produce evidence\r\n  supporting the elements required for a breach of contract action.Â Â Â  Looking to\r\n  â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\r\n  file, together with the affidavitsâ€ in the record, ESI did not present\r\n  sufficient evidence of a breach by JCC to create an issue for trial.Â  See Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Â \r\nIt\r\n  is undisputed JCC and ESI entered into a mutual contract.Â  By the terms of the\r\n  contract, ESI was required to â€œ[r]emove, solidify, transport and dispose of\r\n  approximately 350 tons of waste treatment sludge.â€Â  After disposal of the\r\n  sludge, JCC was required to pay ESI according to the â€œmeasure of sludge hauled\r\n  to the landfill.â€Â  To establish a breach, ESI was required to prove JCC did not\r\n  pay for sludge removal complying with the terms of the agreement.Â  However, there\r\n  is no evidence in the record suggesting JCC failed to compensate ESI for the\r\n  work it performed.Â  The only evidence offering insight into JCCâ€™s payment for ESIâ€™s\r\n  services is the deposition of Brian Larry Penfield, Jr. (Penfield), the\r\n  president and owner of ESI.Â  In his deposition, Penfield testified:\r\n\r\n  Q:Â  Okay.Â  And do you know how much\r\n    money J.C. Construction paid you?\r\n  A:Â  Without pulling it out I do not\r\n    know, sir.\r\n  Q:Â  So you have no idea as you sit here\r\n    today whether they paid you the entire $38,000, do you?\r\n  A:Â  Not right this moment I do not.\r\n  Q:Â  All right.Â  As we sit here today can\r\n    you tell me what services or materials that you provided to my client, J.C.\r\n    Construction that you were not compensated for?\r\n  A:Â  Well, the contract for the first 350\r\n    tons and first $37,800 I would say that that there was falling in line with the\r\n    $108 a ton and then due to circumstances either caused by delays, change orders\r\n    and other nature like that, that the materials that was in the bag on the\r\n    bottom of the hill and the prevention of moving further with the job since we\r\n    were basically . . . when we put a work stoppage in to try and get things\r\n    hashed out it prevented us from making up the rest of the money, particularly\r\n    time, the cost of the bags.Â  We had multitude of down days to where we drove up\r\n    there and we couldnâ€™t do anything, some of which may have been in our error but\r\n    some of which were not, so those are the things that I think that should be\r\n    calculated in regard to that.Â  \r\n\r\nIn the appellantâ€™s brief, ESIâ€™s counsel\r\n  concedes this testimony confirms ESI was paid for the first 350 tons of sludge\r\n  removal but argues that Penfieldâ€™s testimony was erroneous and inaccurate.Â \r\n  While counsel maintains that Penfield was mistaken and ESI was not paid for the\r\n  sludge removal fully performed, no additional evidence is offered anywhere in\r\n  the record to support this contention.Â Â Â Â  \r\nGiven Penfieldâ€™s uncertain testimony and\r\n  the lack of other supporting evidence, this court does not find a genuine issue\r\n  of material fact as to whether ESI was paid under the contract.Â  Although\r\n  Penfield appears to be unsure as to what amount he received from JCC at the\r\n  time of the deposition, the testimony establishes ESI was paid.Â  When asked\r\n  what services ESI was not compensated for, Penfield seems to suggest ESI wants\r\n  payment for the sludge pumped into the dewatering bags and left at the jobsite\r\n  and the costs associated with delays as opposed to the money due under the\r\n  original terms of the contract.Â  His response to the question is ambiguous at\r\n  best.Â  This ambiguity is not sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material\r\n  fact sufficient for trial on the claim ESI was not paid for work fully\r\n  performed under the contract.Â  Facts contested in a deficient manner cannot\r\n  overcome a properly supported motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nAfter JCC established a lack of\r\n  evidentiary support for the case, the burden shifted to ESI to prove the\r\n  existence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  See Regions Bank v.\r\n    Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 660, 582 S.E.2d 432, 438 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  A party\r\n  opposing a motion for summary judgment must allege facts clearly showing a\r\n  material issue for trial and cannot rely on a mere scintilla of evidence to\r\n  overcome the motion.Â  See Thomas v. Waters, 315 S.C. 524, 526,\r\n  334 S.E.2d 659, 661 (2001).Â  ESI failed to meet this burden.Â  Looking to Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP, we are limited to examining the pleadings, depositions, answers\r\n  to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits to find a genuine issue\r\n  of material fact warranting a denial of a grant of summary judgment.Â  Based on\r\n  the record in this case, no such factual dispute exists to support the claim\r\n  ESI was not compensated for the sludge removal fully performed under the\r\n  contract.Â  Therefore, the grant of summary judgment was proper in regards to\r\n  this claim.Â  \r\n2.Â \r\n  Excess Sludge Pumped into Dewatering Bags without Disposal\r\nAdditionally, ESI is seeking recovery\r\n  for sludge removed in excess of the terms of the contract and left in\r\n  dewatering bags at the jobsite without proper disposal.Â  ESI alleges it is\r\n  entitled to recover for this work under a theory of quantum meruit, or in the\r\n  alternative, under a claim for breach of contract.Â  \r\nQuantum meruit is an equitable remedy.Â  Columbia Wholesale v. Scudder May N.V., 312 S.C. 259, 261, 440 S.E.2d 129,\r\n  130 (1994); Landbank Fund VII, LLC v. Dickerson, 369 S.C. 621, 630, 632\r\n  S.E.2d 882, 887 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  â€œ â€˜In a law action, the measure of damages is\r\n  determined by the partiesâ€™ agreement, while in equity, â€˜the measure of the\r\n  recovery is the extent of the duty or obligation imposed by law, and is\r\n  expressed by the amount which the court considers the defendant has been\r\n  unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.â€™ â€™ â€Â  QHG of Lake City,\r\n    Inc. v.

App. 1987), this Court addressed what constitutes\r\n  abandonment of a contract:Â  \r\n\r\n  Abandonment of contract by one\r\n    party is the giving up of the right to a benefit due from the other party.Â  Pitcher\r\n      v. Lauritzen, 18 Utah 2d 368, 423 P.2d 491 (1967).Â  A contract will be\r\n    treated as abandoned when the acts of one party inconsistent with its existence\r\n    are acquiesced in by the other party.Â  Sauder v. Dittmar, 118 F.2d 524 (10th\r\n    Cir. 1941); 17 Am.Jur.2d Contracts Section 484 (1964).Â  To constitute\r\n    abandonment of contract by conduct, the actions relied upon must be positive,\r\n    unequivocal, and inconsistent with the existence of a contract.Â  Mood v.\r\n      Methodist Episcopal Church South, 289 S.W. 461 (Tex. Civ. App. 1926).Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  abandonment of a contract is a matter of intention to be ascertained from the\r\n  facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction from which the abandonment\r\n  is claimed to have resulted.â€Â  Quality Concrete Products, Inc. v. Thomason,\r\n  253 S.C. 579, 589, 172 S.E.2d 297, 302 (1970).Â  â€œAn abandonment of a contract\r\n  need not be express but may be inferred from the conduct of the parties and the\r\n  attendant circumstances.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œ[A]n abandonment of the contract involves\r\n  a breach of the implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing.â€Â  U.S. ex. rel. William Elec. Co., Inc. v. Metric Constructors, Inc., 325 S.C.\r\n  129, 135, 480 S.E.2d 447, 450 (1997).Â  \r\nESI\r\n  cannot recover under a theory of quantum meruit if the work they are seeking\r\n  compensation for is covered under the terms of an express contract.Â  However, if\r\n  the express contract has been abandoned, recovery under quantum meruit may be\r\n  possible.Â  In this case, an express contract covered the task for which ESI is\r\n  seeking recovery, but ESI abandoned the contract when it unilaterally decided\r\n  to quit the project.Â  This abandonment cannot allow ESI to recover under\r\n  quantum meruit.Â  ESI left the jobsite, demanded an increase in price, and\r\n  refused to perform any further work until JCC consented.Â  ESI sent a new\r\n  service agreement to JCC stating, along with a price increase to $220.00 per\r\n  ton removed:Â  \r\n\r\n  This cost will include all of the\r\n    changes and the clarifications that Woolpert Engineering has imposed for this\r\n    project.Â  No trucks can be loaded until there is an agreement signed and\r\n      returned.Â  ESI will still need to obtain a new purchase order for the\r\n    remaining sludge to reflect the cost changes as well as change orders signed\r\n    and placed by Woolpert to insure it is done by the new specifications.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nIn\r\n  response to this demand, JCC hired another company to complete the remaining\r\n  tasks.Â  ESIâ€™s abandonment was a breach of contract and does not open the door\r\n  to a claim under quantum meruit.Â  Therefore, ESI was barred from recovery.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  ESI is not entitled to recover for breach of contract until it fully performs\r\n  under the terms of the contract.Â  By failing to properly transport and dispose\r\n  of the sludge pumped into the dewatering bags, ESI did not complete performance.Â \r\n  Due to this failure, ESI was not yet entitled to compensation under the terms\r\n  of the contract and cannot recover for breach of contract.Â  \r\n3.Â \r\n  Ambiguity in the Contract\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  ESI argues the contract was ambiguous by stating â€œapproximately 350 tons of\r\n  waste treatment sludge.â€Â  Because â€œapproximatelyâ€ could be subject to conflicting\r\n  interpretation, the question of whether the additional sludge removed is\r\n  covered by the terms of an express contract is disputed.Â  If the additional\r\n  sludge removal was not covered by an express contract, recovery under quantum\r\n  meruit may be allowed.Â  \r\nIn HK New Plan Exch. Prop. Owner I, LLC v. Coker, 375 S.C. 18, 23, 649\r\n  S.E.2d 181, 184 (Ct. App. 2007), we discussed the effect of an ambiguous contract\r\n  on a motion for summary judgment:Â  \r\n\r\n  Generally, the\r\n    construction of a contract is a question of law for the court. Â Soil\r\n      Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way Envtl., Inc., 325 S.C. 231, 234, 482 S.E.2d 554,\r\n    555 (1997). Â Where a motion for summary judgment presents a question as to the\r\n    construction of a written contract, if the language employed by the agreement\r\n    is plain and unambiguous, the question is one of law. Â First-Citizens Bank\r\n      Trust Co. v. Conway Nat'l Bank, 282 S.C. 303, 305, 317 S.E.2d 776,\r\n    777 (Ct. App. 1984). Â â€œIn such a case, summary judgment is proper and a trial\r\n    unnecessary where the intention of the parties as to the legal effect of the\r\n    contract may be gathered from the four corners of the instrument itself.â€ Â Id.\r\n  However, summary\r\n    judgment is improper where the motion presents a question as to the\r\n    construction of a written contract, and the contract is ambiguous because the\r\n    intent of the parties can not be gathered from the four corners of the\r\n    instrument. Â Bishop v. Benson, 297 S.C. 14, 17, 374 S.E.2d 517,\r\n    518-19 (Ct. App. 1988). Â Where a contract is unclear, or is ambiguous and\r\n    capable of more than one construction, the parties' intentions are matters of\r\n    fact to be submitted to a jury. Â Wheeler v. Globe Rutgers Fire Ins. Co. of\r\n      City of N.Y., 125 S.C. 320, 325, 118 S.E. 609, 610 (1923).\r\n\r\nTypically, when a contract is ambiguous\r\n  and a question of fact is raised to its interpretation, summary judgment would\r\n  not be appropriate.Â  However, in this case, regardless of the interpretation of\r\n  the contract, ESI would not be entitled to recover.Â  \r\nIf an express contract covered the excess\r\n  sludge removed, then ESI would be limited to a recovery in breach of contract.Â \r\n  However, due to the fact ESI breached the contract and did not fully perform,\r\n  it would be unable to recover.Â  \r\nIf the additional sludge removal was not\r\n  covered by the contract because of the ambiguity of the term â€œapproximately,â€\r\n  ESI would still be unable to recover under a theory of quantum meruit.Â  Before\r\n  recovery is allowed, quantum meruit requires the defendant to retain a benefit\r\n  under circumstances that make it inequitable for the defendant to do so without\r\n  paying value.Â  In this case, it would not be inequitable for JCC to retain the\r\n  benefit of ESIâ€™s work because there was no inequitable conduct on the part of\r\n  JCC leading to the removal.Â  ESI submitted a change order requesting an\r\n  increase in tonnage removed to 5000 tons.Â  However, ESI failed to present any\r\n  evidence JCC agreed to this increase.Â  Because it proceeded without a valid\r\n  agreement, ESI bore the risk of not receiving a benefit for its services.Â \r\n  Therefore, recovery for the excess sludge removal is inappropriate under a\r\n  theory of quantum meruit.Â  \r\nIn his deposition, Penfield testified to\r\n  his understanding of the partiesâ€™ agreement regarding the disposal of\r\n  additional sludge:\r\n\r\n  Q:Â  Okay.Â  You would agree with me that\r\n    this contract doesnâ€™t give you any more rights than to basically haul away 350\r\n    tons of sludge?\r\n  . . . \r\n  A:Â  I think there was also a change\r\n    order sent in part to remove it . . . turn it to, I think 1,800 tons or so.Â  \r\n  Q:Â  Was that change order ever signed by\r\n    my client?\r\n  A:Â  That I donâ€™t know, sir.Â  \r\n  Q:Â  Well, Iâ€™ll show it to you.Â  Iâ€™m\r\n    going to hand you what has been marked as Exhibit Number Four to your\r\n    deposition.Â  \r\n  . . . \r\n  Q:Â  What is that, for the record,\r\n    please?\r\n  A:Â  That is a change in calculation\r\n    after we tried to meet every one of the change orders that had been placed upon\r\n    us. \r\n  Q:Â  And in that you raised the price,\r\n    you basically gave a quote that sais (sic), â€œHey, weâ€™ll do this for 200 bucks a\r\n    ton,â€ is that correct?\r\n  A:Â  Thatâ€™s correct.\r\n  Q:Â  In the second paragraph it says, â€œNo\r\n    trucks can be loaded until there is an agreement signed and returned.â€\r\n  A:Â  Thatâ€™s correct.\r\n  Q:Â  Okay.Â  So what youâ€™re doing is\r\n    youâ€™re saying my company will do this if we enter into an agreement for this\r\n    price to be $220, is that correct?\r\n  A:Â  Yes, sir.Â  \r\n  . . . \r\n  Q:Â  Well, they didnâ€™t agree to this did\r\n    they, to Exhibit Number Four?Â  They didnâ€™t agree to pay two and a half times .\r\n    . . \r\n  A:Â  No, sir, they never signed it and\r\n    sent it back.\r\n  Q:Â  Right so you didnâ€™t have an\r\n    agreement to do any more work out there, did you?\r\n  A:Â  In the terms that youâ€™re putting it,\r\n    no sir.\r\n  Q:Â  Well, you put it right here that you\r\n    werenâ€™t going to load any trucks until they signed the agreement, didnâ€™t you?\r\n  A:Â  Thatâ€™s correct.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  deposition of Laverne Anderson (Anderson) establishes JCCâ€™s understanding of\r\n  the agreement regarding any additional sludge removal beyond the terms of the\r\n  contract.Â  Anderson explained:Â  \r\n\r\n  [W]e had ESI under contract, which is\r\n    drawn up to meet our needs, and we had won the contract to remove 350 tons and\r\n    thatâ€™s it.Â  And then if we chose to do so, to continue working with him, we\r\n    could issue him a change order at the same unit rate he gave us to complete the\r\n    job.Â  But he left the job because he hadnâ€™t paid his suppliers, he pulled off,\r\n    he couldnâ€™t remove the sludge.Â  \r\n\r\nNothing\r\n  in the record establishes any agreement between JCC and ESI for the removal of\r\n  sludge beyond the terms of the original contract.Â  If the original contract had\r\n  expired, ESI pumped the additional sludge without an agreement with JCC.Â  ESI\r\n  cannot perform work without any agreement in place and then argue it is\r\n  entitled to compensation.Â  Without evidence indicating it would be inequitable\r\n  for JCC to retain this benefit, ESI is not entitled to recover under quantum\r\n  meruit.Â  \r\nFurthermore, we note ESI received a\r\n  credit from its subcontractor, Wolfe Creek, for time, materials, and labor\r\n  exhausted in filling the remaining bag and for three loads of ESIâ€™s sawdust.Â  This\r\n  credit compensated ESI for expenses it incurred in pumping the excess sludge\r\n  into the dewatering bags before ESI abandoned the jobsite.Â  Even though ESI did\r\n  not receive as much as it desired for the excess removal, the credit ensured\r\n  that ESI was repaid for the incurred costs.Â  Therefore, equity does not require\r\n  JCC to further compensate ESI for this work.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nESI has not presented a theory of\r\n  recovery for which it is entitled to prevail based on the evidence contained in\r\n  the record. Â Regardless of whether the contract is ambiguous, the grant of\r\n  summary judgment is appropriate.Â  Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case\r\n  without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-283","title":"Gravelle v.

Terrorism of a Different Color,â€ stated in full:\r\n\r\n  When we\r\n    can no longer speak openly and freely on Forums such as Clearstar we certainly\r\n    have been terrorized.Â  I think most of us who use Clearstar, for the intent\r\n    that [Long] created it, will agree that it has become one of the most useful\r\n    tools that we have.Â  My hope is that it will continue to mature as one of the\r\n    best technical resources we have as Locksmiths.\r\n  So I ask\r\n    all who pay the 40 bucks a year . . . the 250 or 500 for lifetimeâ€¦to consider\r\n    how much money Clearstar has made and/or saved you this year.Â  Think about it.\r\n  Lets\r\n    [sic] say you have worked hard this year . . . very hard . . . trying to grow\r\n    and improve your business.Â  Then you get hit with a lawsuit (one which you\r\n    donâ€™t deserve to be part of) costly, distracting and depressing.Â  Your friendâ€™s\r\n    [sic] rally for you and the court with its wisdom throws the suit out . . . you\r\n    relax.\r\n  Now in a\r\n    different venue . . . the State of California, the Lawsuit is new again . . . .\r\n  Terrorism\r\n    of a different Color . . . frivolous lawsuits.\r\n  The\r\n    Clearstar Defense Fund is open for business.\r\n\r\n[Roberts]\r\nBased\r\n  on this post, Gravelle filed a complaint in South Carolina against Roberts[1] for libel.[2]Â \r\n  He filed this complaint in South Carolina because Roberts is an officer and\r\n  employee of Beacon Safe &amp; Lock, Inc., which is a South Carolina corporation.Â \r\n  Gravelle claimed Robertsâ€™ post accused him of â€œfiling frivolous lawsuits and\r\n  carrying out deplorable actions akin to that of Osama Bin Ladin, [imputing\r\n  toward him and his company] a lack of integrity, honesty, trust,\r\n  professionalism . . . which held him up to ridicule, scorn mocking, etc . . .\r\n  and lower[ing] him within his professional community.â€Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the close of Gravelleâ€™s case, Roberts moved for a directed verdict and Gravelle\r\n  moved to represent himself pro se, though he wanted to retain his\r\n  current counsel as second chair.Â  The trial court denied Gravelleâ€™s motion for hybrid\r\n  representation and granted Robertsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict, finding the\r\n  publication was not defamatory as a matter of law, and alternatively, even if\r\n  it was defamatory, it was not actionable per se.Â  Gravelle then\r\n  filed a motion for a new trial, which was dismissed as untimely.Â  This appeal\r\n  follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;Directed Verdict\r\nGravelle\r\n  maintains the trial court erred by granting Robertsâ€™ directed verdict motion.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  ruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial court is required to view\r\n  the evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most\r\n  favorable to the party opposing the motion and deny the motion when either the\r\n  evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Law\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  The\r\n  appellate court will reverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling on a directed verdict\r\n  motion only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling\r\n  is controlled by an error of law.Â  Id. at 434-35, 629 S.E.2d at 648.Â  When\r\n  considering a directed verdict motion, neither the trial court nor the appellate\r\n  court has authority to determine issues of credibility or to resolve conflicts\r\n  in the testimony or evidence.Â  Erickson v. Jones St. Publishers, L.L.C.,\r\n  368 S.C. 444, 463, 629 S.E.2d 653, 663 (2006).\r\nâ€œ[L]ibel\r\n  is a written defamation or one accomplished by actions or conduct.â€Â  Holtzscheiter\r\n    v. Thompson Newspapers, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 508, 506 S.E.2d 497, 501\r\n  (1998).Â  â€œThe tort of defamation allows a plaintiff to recover for injury to\r\n  his or her reputation as the result of the defendantâ€™s communications to others\r\n  of a false message about the plaintiff.â€Â  Parrish v. Allison, 376 S.C.\r\n  308, 320, 656 S.E.2d 382, 388 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  To recover for defamation, the\r\n  plaintiff must establish: â€œ(1) a false and defamatory statement concerning\r\n  another; (2) an unprivileged publication to a third party; (3) fault on the\r\n  part of the publisher; and (4) either actionability of the statement\r\n  irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the\r\n  publication.â€Â  Lynch v. Toys â€œRâ€ Us-Del., Inc., 375 S.C. 604, 619, 654\r\n  S.E.2d 541, 549 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Pursuant to the first element, the trial\r\n  court must initially determine if the statement is reasonably capable of\r\n  conveying a defamatory meaning.Â  Parrish, 376 S.C. at 321, 656 S.E.2d at\r\n  389.Â  \r\nA\r\n  statement can be defamatory per se or defamatory per quod.Â  Id.Â  Defamation per se occurs when the defamatory\r\n  meaning of a statement is obvious on the face of the statement, whereas\r\n  defamation per quod occurs when extrinsic evidence must be\r\n  introduced in order to prove the defamatory meaning.Â  Holtzscheiter, 332\r\n  S.C. at 508-09, 506 S.E.2d at 501.Â  \r\nRobertsâ€™\r\n  post is not defamatory on its face and, therefore, is not defamatory per se. Â See Whitaker v. Sherbrook Distrib. Co., 189 S.C. 243,\r\n  245, 200 S.E. 848, 849 (1939) (stating for words to be libelous per se,\r\n  the court must be able to presume without extrinsic evidence the plaintiff has\r\n  been degraded or suffered some loss due to these words).Â  Robertsâ€™ post complains\r\n  about frivolous lawsuits but does not name Gravelle as the instigator of the\r\n  suits.Â  While we recognize Gravelleâ€™s name need not be referenced in the\r\n  writing to support a libel action, we find the description in the writing too\r\n  vague and any damage too nebulous to amount to defamation.Â  Cf. Nash\r\n    v. Sharper, 229 S.C. 451, 456, 93 S.E.2d 457, 459 (1956) (â€œTo support an\r\n  action for a libel, the plaintiffâ€™s name need not be mentioned in the writing;\r\n  it is sufficient that there is a description of, or reference to, him, by which\r\n  he may be known.â€).\r\nFurther,\r\n  Gravelle failed to present any evidence indicating the statement was defamatory per quod.Â  See Fleming v. Rose, 338 S.C. 524, 532-33,\r\n  526 S.E.2d 732, 737 (Ct. App. 2000), overruled on other grounds by Fleming\r\n    v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002) (â€œIf the defamatory meaning is\r\n  not clear unless the hearer knows facts or circumstances not contained in the\r\n  statement itself, then the statement is defamatory per quod.â€).Â  Indeed,\r\n  Gravelle was unable to show that even if additional information was known to\r\n  the reader that the statement was false or that it resulted in harm to his\r\n  reputation.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  even if Robertsâ€™ statement was defamatory, no evidence was presented showing\r\n  the defamation was actionable.Â  See Capps v. Watts, 271 S.C. 276,\r\n  281, 246 S.E.2d 606, 609 (1978) (â€œIf a publication is not both libelous and\r\n  actionable, a cause of action for libel cannot lie.â€).Â  Specifically, Gravelle failed\r\n  to plead and prove common law actual malice and special damages, and the\r\n  statement is not the type from which the law presumes malice.Â  See Holtzscheiter,\r\n  332 S.C. at 510, 506 S.E.2d at 501-02 (stating the law presumes malice and\r\n  general damages with defamation that is actionable per se, but\r\n  plaintiff must plead and prove malice and special damages if it is not\r\n  actionable per se).Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err by\r\n  directing a verdict in favor of Roberts.\r\nII. New Trial Motion\r\nGravelle\r\n  contends the trial court erred by dismissing his motion for a new trial as\r\n  untimely.Â  We disagree.\r\nMotions\r\n  for new trials are governed by Rule 59 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\n  Procedure.Â  Boone v. Goodwin, 314 S.C. 374, 376, 444 S.E.2d 524, 525\r\n  (1994). Â Rule 59(b), SCRCP, provides:Â  â€œThe motion for a new trial shall be\r\n  made promptly after the jury is discharged, or in the discretion of the court\r\n  not later than 10 days thereafter.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court granted Robertsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict and discharged the\r\n  jury on May 24, 2005.Â  Gravelle did not serve his motion for a new trial until\r\n  June 9, 2005.Â  Because the motion was not made within the ten days required by\r\n  Rule 59(b), SCRCP, the trial court dismissed the motion as untimely.Â  Gravelle\r\n  does not dispute his motion was served after ten days had elapsed from the time\r\n  the jury was discharged.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion by electing not to entertain Gravelleâ€™s motion.\r\nIII. Hybrid Representation\r\nGravelle\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for hybrid representation.Â \r\n  We find this argument to be abandoned on appeal.\r\nAn\r\n  issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the argument\r\n  is raised in a brief but not supported by authority.Â  Historic Charleston Holdings, LLC v. Mallon, 365 S.C. 524, 533 n.7, 617 S.E.2d 388, 393 n.7 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  Gravelle has failed to cite any authority in support of his\r\n  assertion that the trial court erred in denying his motion for hybrid\r\n  representation, and he has, therefore, abandoned this issue on appeal.Â  \r\nIV. Evidence\r\nGravelle\r\n  maintains the trial court erred by excluding evidence supporting his special\r\n  damages claim and evidence offered to show the effects of Robertsâ€™ alleged\r\n  libel.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Todd\r\n    v. Joyner, 376 S.C. 114, 118-19, 654 S.E.2d 862, 864 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  â€œAn\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a\r\n  factual conclusion without evidentiary support.â€Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 467, 611 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2005).\r\n\r\n  a. Special Damages\r\n\r\nThe trial court excluded Gravelleâ€™s special damages\r\n  exhibit because his damages were speculative and not compensable under South Carolina law.Â  South Carolina does not permit recovery for speculative damages.Â  Llewellyn\r\n    v. Atl. Greyhound Corp., 204 S.C. 156, 170, 28 S.E.2d 673, 678 (1944).Â  Gravelle\r\n  argued his special damages amounted to $110,490, which included: (1) deposition\r\n  and trial expenses of airline tickets, hotel accommodations, car rentals, and\r\n  out-of-pocket expenses such as food and gas, (2) loss of business (coinciding\r\n  with deposition and trial dates), (3) prospective advertisement expenditures,\r\n  and (4) expenses associated with attending trade shows.Â  As the trial court\r\n  noted, the damages Gravelle sought were â€œprimarily related to the case.â€Â  The\r\n  only damages not related to his lawsuit were future advertising expenses.Â  The\r\n  evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that these damages were\r\n  speculative or not the type of damages compensable under South Carolina law.\r\n\r\n  b. Effects of Libel Evidence\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  trial court excluded the evidence depicting responses by other individuals to Robertsâ€™\r\n  post, finding the evidence was hearsay.Â  Gravelle argues these responses are\r\n  essential to establish the damage his reputation sustained as a direct and\r\n  proximate result of Robertsâ€™ statements.Â  The responses offered, however, were written\r\n  by third parties, not Roberts.Â  These responses were hearsay because they were\r\n  written by third parties not testifying at trial or otherwise under oath and\r\n  offered to prove Gravelleâ€™s reputation was damaged, and no exception applied to\r\n  render this hearsay admissible.Â  SeeÂ  Rule 801(c), SCRE (â€œâ€˜Hearsayâ€™ is a\r\n  statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial\r\n  or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€);\r\n  Rule 802, SCRE (stating hearsay is not admissible unless an exception applies).Â \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to admit the responses.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.[3] \r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The action was\r\n  filed against Roberts as an individual and as the\r\n  principle officer of Beacon Safe &amp; Lock, Inc. and DOES I through V, and Roe\r\n  Corporations VI through X.Â  \r\n[2] Gravelle also\r\n  sued for tortious interference with prospective or existing business relations,\r\n  but he abandoned the claim at trial.Â  \r\n[3] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-284","title":"Estate of Rosa Tucker v.

Steinmetz, both of\r\n          Columbia,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Rosa Tucker filed this complaint in 2003 against her\r\n  oldest son, Roy Tucker (Tucker), alleging fraud, conversion, constructive\r\n  trust, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence per se for\r\n  violation of the Omnibus Elderly Abuse Statute, and unfair trade practices.Â \r\n      \r\n  Rosa died in\r\n  2004 and the action was continued on behalf of the Estate of Rosa Tucker (the\r\n  Estate) by the personal representative, Ernest Tucker.Â  After a bench trial, the circuit court issued\r\n  an order finding the Estate was entitled to a constructive trust in the amount\r\n  of $22,000.Â  The court denied the\r\n  Estateâ€™s remaining claims.Â  The circuit\r\n  court thereafter denied Tuckerâ€™s post-trial motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment.Â  Tucker appeals.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Tucker asserts (1) the circuit court erred in imposing a constructive\r\n  trust, (2) even if the constructive trust was properly imposed, the circuit\r\n  court erred in establishing the amount of the trust as $22,000, and (3)&nbsp;the\r\n  circuit court erred in denying his motion for a new trial or a new trial nisi remittitur.\r\n1.Â  Imposition of\r\n  Constructive Trust.\r\nThis\r\n  dispute arises out of Tuckerâ€™s purchase of two residences that his mother lived\r\n  in located at\r\n \r\n  3626 Hydrangea\r\n  Street and\r\n \r\n  3601 Edmond Drive in\r\n  \r\n  Columbia,\r\n  \r\n  South Carolina.Â  The Estate alleges Tucker used money advanced\r\n  to him by his mother to make the purchases, but he did not repay the amounts\r\n  loaned to him.Â  The circuit court granted\r\n  a constructive trust to the Estate pertaining to the\r\n  \r\n  Hydrangea Street property.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  his appeal, Tucker first alleges the circuit court erred in finding a\r\n  constructive trust should be imposed.Â  Tucker contends (a) there has been no finding of fraud, bad faith, abuse\r\n  of confidence, or violation of a fiduciary duty that would give rise to an\r\n  obligation in equity to make restitution, (b) the Estate has not established\r\n  its entitlement to a trust by clear and convincing evidence, and (c) the\r\n  Estateâ€™s complaint did not seek the establishment of a trust for the Hydrangea\r\n  Street property.Â  \r\n\"A\r\n  constructive trust arises entirely by operation of law without reference to any\r\n  actual or supposed intentions of creating a trust.\"Â  McNair v. Rainsford,&nbsp;330\r\n  S.C. 332, 356, 499 S.E.2d 488, 501&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998).Â  \"It is resorted to by equity to vindicate\r\n  right and justice or frustrate fraud.\"Â \r\n      \r\n      Id.Â  Because an action to declare a constructive\r\n  trust is in equity, this Court may find the facts in accordance with its own\r\n  view of the evidence.Â  Lollis\r\n    v. Lollis,&nbsp;291 S.C. 525, 530, 354 S.E.2d 559, 561&nbsp;(1987).\r\n\"A\r\n  constructive trust will arise whenever the circumstances under which property\r\n  was acquired make it inequitable that it should be retained by the one holding\r\n  the legal title.\"Â  Lollis,\r\n  291 S.C. at 529, 354 at 561.Â  \"A\r\n  constructive trust results from fraud, bad faith, abuse of confidence, or\r\n  violation of a fiduciary duty which gives rise to an obligation in equity to\r\n  make restitution.\"Â \r\n      \r\n      Id.Â  \"A\r\n  constructive trust arises whenever a party has obtained money which does not\r\n  equitably belong to him and which he cannot in good conscience retain or\r\n  withhold from another who is beneficially entitled to it as where money has\r\n  been paid by accident, mistake of fact, or fraud, or has been acquired through\r\n  a breach of trust or the violation of a fiduciary duty.\"Â  SSI Med. Servs., Inc. v.\r\n    Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 500, 392 S.E.2d 789, 793-94 (1990). \r\nThe\r\n  burden is on the plaintiff to establish a constructive trust by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence.Â  McNair, 330\r\n  S.C. at 357, 499 S.E.2d at 501; see also Lollis,&nbsp;291 S.C. at\r\n  530, 354 S.E.2d at 561 (\"In order to establish a constructive trust, the\r\n  evidence must be clear, definite, and unequivocal.\").Â  Although fraud is generally cited as an\r\n  element to establish a constructive trust, a party need not show actual\r\n  fraud.Â  McNair, 330 S.C. at 357, 499 S.E.2d at 501.Â  Further, \"equity is less than demanding and quite flexible in\r\n  prescribing the elements essential to a constructive trust.\"Â  Whitmire v. Adams,\r\n  273 S.C. 453, 458, 257 S.E.2d 160, 163&nbsp;(1979).\r\nInitially,\r\n  we find Tuckerâ€™s argument that the circuit court erred in imposing a\r\n  constructive trust because the Estate did not seek the establishment of a\r\n  constructive trust as to the\r\n \r\n  Hydrangea\r\n  Street property, but only claimed a constructive\r\n  trust for the\r\n  \r\n  Edmond Drive\r\n  property, is not properly before us.Â  Tucker did not raise this alleged error to the circuit court in a\r\n  post-trial motion.Â  Where a trial court\r\n  grants relief that was not requested, the proper procedure for the party\r\n  alleging error is to make a post-trial motion to the trial court to alter or amend\r\n  the order.Â  See, e.g., Pelican\r\n    Bldg. Ctrs. of Horry-Georgetown, Inc. v. Dutton,&nbsp;311 S.C. 56, 60, 427\r\n  S.E.2d 673, 675&nbsp;(1993); Godfrey v. Heller, 311 S.C. 516, 520-21,\r\n  429 S.E.2d 859, 862 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  An\r\n  alleged error may not be raised for the first time on appeal; rather, it must\r\n  be both raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.Â  Pye v. Estate of\r\n    Fox,&nbsp;369 S.C. 555, 564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510&nbsp;(2006) (\"It is well\r\n  settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved.\"); see Staubes v. City of Folly\r\n    Beach,&nbsp;339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546&nbsp;(2000) (\"Error preservation requirements are intended â€˜to enable the lower\r\n  court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and\r\n  arguments.â€™ \" (quoting Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of\r\n    \r\n      \r\n    Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526\r\n  S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000))).Â  Thus, this\r\nallegation is not preserved.\r\nWe\r\n  next consider Tuckerâ€™s argument that a constructive trust was not proper in\r\n  this case because the Estate made no showing of fraud, a confidential\r\n  relationship, or any other qualifying element by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence.Â  The Estate contends the\r\n  circuit court did specifically find \"that [Tucker] and his mother were clearly\r\n  in a confidential relationship, [Tucker] was the dominant party in the\r\n  transactions complained of, that [Tuckerâ€™s] mother relied upon him and trusted\r\n  him, and [Tucker] provided little evidence that the transactions were fair or\r\n  equitable.\"Â Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  have previously noted that \"a precise definition of a confidential relationship\r\n  is elusive . . . .\"Â  Chapman v. Citizens &amp; S. Natâ€™l Bank, 302 S.C. 469, 475, 395\r\n  S.E.2d 446, 450&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1990).Â \"Confidential relations are deemed to arise whenever two persons have\r\n  come into such a relation that confidence is necessarily reposed by one and the\r\n  influence which naturally grows out of the confidence is possessed by the\r\n  other, and this confidence is abused or the influence is exerted to obtain an\r\n  advantage at expense of confiding party.\"Â \r\n      \r\n      Id. at 476, 395 S.E.2d at 451.Â  In Chapman we quoted the following\r\n  definition from Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary:\r\n\r\n  Confidential relation.Â  A fiduciary relation.Â  It is a peculiar relation which exists between client and attorney,\r\n    principal and agent, principal and surety, landlord and tenant, parent and\r\n    child . . . .Â  In these and like cases, the law, in order to\r\n    prevent undue advantage from the unlimited confidence or sense of duty which\r\n    the relation naturally creates, requires the utmost degree of good faith in all\r\n    transactions between the parties.Â  It is\r\n    not confined to any specific association of parties.Â  It appears when the circumstances make it\r\n    certain that the parties do not deal on equal terms, but on the one side there\r\n    is an overmastering influence, or, on the other, weakness, dependence, or\r\n      trust, justifiably reposed. The mere existence of kinship does not, of\r\n    itself, give rise to such relation.Â  It\r\n    covers every form of relation between parties wherein confidence is reposed by\r\n    one in another, and [the] former relies and acts upon representations of the\r\n    other and is guilty of no derelictions on his own part.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  Id. at 476, 395 S.E.2d at 450-51 (quoting Blackâ€™s Law\r\n    Dictionary 270 (5th ed. 1979)).\r\nWe\r\n  agree with the Estate that the circuit court did, in fact, find a confidential\r\n  relationship existed between Tucker and his mother.Â  Although the circuit court did not expressly\r\n  use the phrase \"confidential relationship,\" it is clear the court made this\r\n  determination after reviewing the courtâ€™s findings as follows:Â  (1) Tucker \"has benefited from his\r\n  relationship with his mother by taking money from her by way of an $8[,]000.00\r\n  loan, by selling property to her for stated consideration of $14,000.00, and\r\n  then having her re-convey the property for love and affection\"; (2) Tucker \"was\r\n  the dominant party in these transactions and a businessman who, by his own\r\n  testimony, buys and sells real estate, sells life insurance, and owns rental\r\n  houses\"; (3)&nbsp;Tucker \"also prepared the deeds that were signed by his\r\n  mother\"; and (4)&nbsp;Tuckerâ€™s mother \"never graduated from high school and\r\n  relied upon and trusted Roy Tucker in these transactions.\"Â Â Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold the circuit court did not err in determining the imposition of a\r\n  constructive trust was appropriate under the circumstances.Â Â  Tucker seeks the imposition of a strict\r\n  standard that is not required by our case law.Â  As noted above,\r\n  \r\n  South Carolina\r\n  law provides actual fraud need not be shown to warrant imposition of a\r\n  constructive trust, and the courts are flexible in determining the\r\n  circumstances that justify the imposition of a constructive trust.Â  See Whitmire, 273 S.C. at 458,\r\n  257 S.E.2d at 163 (\"[E]quity is less than demanding and quite flexible in\r\n  prescribing the elements essential to a constructive trust.\").Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, Tucker had a confidential relationship with his mother and he was\r\n  able to obtain funds from her based on the reliance and trust she placed in him\r\n  to direct these business transactions.Â  Tuckerâ€™s mother was an older adult in poor health who did not complete her high school education, and she acquiesced in the decisions\r\n  of her son.Â  Tucker prepared the deeds\r\n  and was in control of the transactions.Â  Because Tucker has never repaid these funds, we agree with the circuit\r\n  court that it is only just and equitable that the law provides recovery to his\r\n  motherâ€™s Estate by means of the imposition of a constructive trust.Â  See, e.g., Devlin v. Devlin,&nbsp;89\r\n  S.C. 268, 271, 71 S.E. 966, 968&nbsp;(1911) (approving the principle of law\r\n  that \"where confidential relations exist between persons, the law looks with\r\n  suspicion upon any transaction between them, whereby the superior gains an\r\n  advantage to himself over the other\"). \r\n2.Â  Amount of Constructive\r\n  Trust.\r\nTucker\r\n  further contends that, even if the circuit court properly imposed a\r\n  constructive trust, the court erred in finding the trust amount should be\r\n  $22,000.Â  Tucker argues $14,000 of this\r\n  amount, which is the sum that was recited in the deed of the\r\n \r\n  Hydrangea Street property, was never\r\n  actually paid to him by his mother.Â  He\r\n  also contends he is entitled to an offset for the unpaid rent, mortgage\r\n  payments, taxes, insurance, and the amount he expended for repairs.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  his testimony, Tucker admitted he had not repaid his mother the $8,000 she had\r\n  advanced for his purchase of the\r\n  \r\n  Hydrangea\r\n  Street home.Â  Tucker also admitted there is a deed that shows he received $14,000 from\r\n  his mother and transferred the home to her.Â  When asked about his receipt of the $14,000 during his testimony, Tucker\r\n  stated, \"Thatâ€™s what it says . . . .\"Â  Although Tucker now disputes that he ever received the $14,000 recited\r\n  as consideration in the deed, we cannot say the circuit court erred in its\r\n  determination of the amount of the trust.Â  Under our standard of review, we may take our own view of the evidence,\r\n  but we are also aware that the circuit court was in the best position to hear\r\n  the witnesses and evaluate their credibility in this regard.Â  See Latimer v.\r\n    Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 380, 602 S.E.2d 32, 34&nbsp;(2004) (\"We are not\r\n  required to disregard the findings of the trial judge who saw\r\n  and heard the witnesses and was in\r\n  a better position to evaluate their credibility.\").Â  Accordingly, we are not inclined to disturb the circuit courtâ€™s finding\r\n  that Tucker received the sum of $14,000 as recited in the deed regarding the\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  Hydrangea Street\r\nproperty.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  we find the issue of an offset has been waived.Â  Tucker did not seek an offset in his pleadings and Tuckerâ€™s counsel\r\n  expressly advised the circuit court at the trial in this matter:Â  \"We do not claim an offset for rent, your\r\n  Honor, in this case.\"Â  Thereafter, the\r\n  court denied counselâ€™s belated, oral motion to amend the pleadings to seek an\r\n  offset.Â  Although Tucker filed a motion\r\n  to reconsider asking for a \"remittitur\" based on the unpaid rent, we note a\r\n  remittitur is a term of art and it is distinguishable from establishing the\r\n  entitlement to an offset that is proven at trial in the first instance.Â  Moreover, as for the rent, we find any\r\n  calculation for unpaid rent would be speculative as we do not know what the\r\n  rent would be after Tuckerâ€™s mother moved to the\r\n  \r\n  Edmond Street property and Tucker made no\r\n  offer of proof.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  we note Tucker is attempting on appeal to expand the items for which he is\r\n  seeking an offset, as he is now claiming an offset for additional items other\r\n  than rent, such as taxes, insurance, and repairs.Â  Consequently, we find no merit to Tuckerâ€™s\r\n  contention that the circuit court erred in failing to grant him an offset\r\n  against the amount awarded for the constructive trust.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,&nbsp;330\r\n  S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733&nbsp;(1998) (\"It is axiomatic that an issue\r\n  cannot be raised for the first time\r\n  on appeal, but must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved\r\n  for appellate review.\"); Hurst v.

Widener, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        Attorney Drew A. Laughlin, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action arising out of the dissolution of a law\r\n  practice, William C. Clark (Clark) and Clark &amp; Stevens, P.A. appeal the\r\n  special refereeâ€™s finding that contingency fee cases were an asset of the firm\r\n  subject to distribution in accordance with the partiesâ€™ respective ownership\r\n  interests.Â  Clark further asserts the special referee erred in finding unjust\r\n  enrichment and in granting relief that exceeded the relief requested by\r\n  plaintiffs.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nJack\r\n  H. Biel (Biel) and Clark practiced law together as a professional association\r\n  organized as a professional corporation under the name Biel &amp; Clark, P.A.\r\n  (the Firm).Â  Clark joined the Firm in 1988 and became an equal shareholder\r\n  sometime in late 1989 or early 1990.Â  During the twelve year duration of the\r\n  Firmâ€™s practice, Biel primarily handled real estate, probate, estate planning,\r\n  and business matters, while Clark handled litigation and domestic matters.Â  Biel and Clark shared equally in the profits and expenses of all legal matters handled by\r\n  the Firm, regardless of the originating attorney or the working attorney. Â \r\nBiel and Clark mutually agreed to cease practicing law\r\n  together as Biel &amp; Clark, P.A., effective December 31, 2000.Â  There was no written agreement governing the termination of the Firmâ€™s practice.Â  The\r\n  professional association remains in existence and has been in the process of\r\n  winding up since the mutual agreement to cease practicing law together.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the time the Firm concluded its operations, Clark was handling several\r\n  significant cases that he retained and continued to manage at his new firm.Â Â Â \r\n  Among these cases are three contingency fee cases that are the subject of the\r\n  present litigation: (1) McKinley; (2) Southwind II; and (3) Ocean Palms.Â  The\r\n  McKinley case is a personal injury matter involving Grant McKinley, a longtime\r\n  friend and client of Biel.Â  The Southwind II and Ocean Palms cases are complex\r\n  construction matters involving condominium and timeshare projects.Â  There was\r\n  no agreement between Biel and Clark regarding attorneyâ€™s fees that might be\r\n  earned on these cases.Â  \r\nDue\r\n  to his personal relationship with Grant McKinley and his prior legal work for\r\n  the Southwind II property ownersâ€™ association, Biel played a significant role\r\n  in procuring the McKinley and Southwind II cases for the Firm.Â  \r\nWith\r\n  regard to the McKinley case, Clark worked a total of 52.7 hours and collected a\r\n  fee of $50,000.00.Â  Of that time, 17.8 hours were expended prior to December 31, 2000.Â  Prior to that date, the Firm advanced $1,233.33 for costs.Â  When the\r\n  case settled, Clark tendered $5,000.00 to Biel as a finderâ€™s fee. \r\nWith\r\n  regard to the Southwind II matter, Clark worked a total of 95.75 hours and\r\n  received a fee of $203,291.91.[1]Â \r\n  Of the 95.75 hours, Clark worked a total of 16.75 hours prior to December 31, 2000, and the Firm advanced a total of $393.04 for costs.Â  A settlement\r\n  statement dated March 1, 2002, and signed by the president of Southwind IIâ€™s\r\n  governing body shows â€œ[t]otal expenses for Biel &amp; Clark, P.A.â€ of $550.21.Â \r\n  Clarkâ€™s time and expense records show that those expenses were incurred after December 31, 2000; however, they are attributed to the Firm on the settlement statement.Â \r\n  The balance of the fee was retained by Clark and Stevens, P.A..[2]\r\nAs\r\n  to Ocean Palms, this case was procured by Clark.Â  Prior to December 31, 2000,\r\n  the work performed by the Firm for Ocean Palms was billed on an hourly basis\r\n  and the fees earned and billed on that basis were collected and distributed\r\n  equally between Biel and Clark.Â  In September of 2001, Clark entered into a\r\n  contingency fee agreement with Ocean Palms.Â Â Â  At the time of the hearing\r\n  before the special referee, portions of the Ocean Palms case had settled and a\r\n  fee of $275,000.00 had been collected.Â  Other portions of the case were pending\r\n  settlement at the time of the hearing.\r\nPrior\r\n  to December 31, 2000, the clients in the McKinley, Southwind II, and Ocean\r\n  Palms cases did not receive written notification that Biel and Clark were\r\n  ceasing to practice law together or that the Firm was going to cease\r\n  operations.Â  The Firm appears as counsel for the plaintiffs in pleadings filed\r\n  in all of these cases both before and after December 31, 2000.Â  Clark took no steps to see that the Firm was relieved as counsel in any of the disputed\r\n  cases.Â  \r\nOn February 19, 2001, and March 19, 2001, Biel wrote Clark setting forth his understanding\r\n  that the fees generated by the McKinley case would be split equally between the\r\n  two attorneys.Â  In his letter, Biel also set forth his understanding that the\r\n  fees generated by the Southwind II and Ocean Palms cases would be paid 50% to\r\n  the Mullen firm, with the remaining balance shared equally between Biel and Clark.Â  Biel further invited Clark to advise him if his understanding differed\r\n  from Bielâ€™s.Â  Biel received no response from Clark until he settled the McKinley\r\n  case more than one year later and tendered the $5,000.00 finderâ€™s fee to Biel.Â  \r\nOn February 3, 2006, a hearing was held on the matter.[3]Â \r\n  Biel alleged causes of action for dissolution of the Firm, breach of\r\n  contract, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and an accounting.Â \r\n  Specifically, Biel sought dissolution of the Firm and a distribution of 50% of\r\n  the fees generated by the above-mentioned cases.Â  In an amended order dated February 28, 2006, the special referee held that the disputed fees were assets of the Firm\r\n  to be distributed in accordance with the partiesâ€™ relative ownership\r\n  interests.Â  The special referee rejected Bielâ€™s breach of contract claim\r\n  concluding that plaintiffs failed to prove the existence of a contract\r\n  pertaining to the disputed fees or its breach.Â  As an alternative holding, the special\r\n  referee accepted Bielâ€™s unjust enrichment claim, finding that Biel had a\r\n  reasonable expectation of payment from the contingency cases; that Clark should\r\n  have reasonably expected to pay Biel; and that society would reasonably expect\r\n  payment to Biel under these circumstances.Â  Based on these findings, the\r\n  special referee ordered Clark to pay 25% of the fees generated by the Southwind\r\n  II matter and 25% of the fees generated and to be generated by the Ocean Palms\r\n  matter to Biel.Â  This allocation recognized that the Mullen firm was to receive\r\n  or had received 50% of the fees from these cases.Â  On August 7, 2006, the special referee further ordered that the fees generated by the Ocean Palms matter\r\n  after the issuance of the February 28, 2006, order shall be paid to the Firm\r\n  and that the Firm be reimbursed for all expenses incurred in prosecuting the\r\n  matter.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis\r\n  case involves both actions in law and in equity. Â â€œWhen legal and equitable\r\n  actions are maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal or\r\n  equitable for purposes of the applicable standard of review on appeal.â€Â  Corley\r\n    v. Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 92, 485 S.E.2d 97, 99 n. 1 (1997) (citing Future Group\r\n      v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 478 S.E.2d 45 (1996)).\r\nâ€œIn an\r\n  action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact\r\n  of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without\r\n  evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings . . . . The judgeâ€™s\r\n  findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.â€ Â Townes\r\n    Assoc., Ltd. v. Cty of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775\r\n  (1976).Â  A special referee, under Rule 53(c), SCRCP, â€œshall exercise all power\r\n  and authority which a circuit [court] sitting without a jury would have in a\r\n  similar matter.â€Â  Accordingly, our review of a special refereeâ€™s decision is\r\n  limited to the correction of errors of law.Â  Id. at 85, 221 S.E.2d at\r\n  775.\r\nA\r\n  corporate dissolution is an action at equity.Â  Jordan v. Holt,\r\n  362 S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d 129, 131 (2005).Â  In actions at equity, this\r\n  court can find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nClark argues the\r\n  special referee erred in finding the contingency fee cases were assets of the\r\n  Firm subject to marshalling and distribution through the dissolution of the\r\n  Firm.Â  Specifically, Clark contends the contingency cases and fees are not\r\n  assets of the firm because all three cases were transferred to him after the\r\n  break-up of the Firm.[4]Â \r\n  He further asserts the referee erred because Biel did not allege the cases and\r\n  fees were assets of the Firm in their complaint. Â We disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  an initial matter, we note Clark failed to cite supporting authority for the primary\r\n  arguments asserted in his brief on appeal. Â However, to the extent appellant\r\n  asserts the lack of any South Carolina authority regarding the primary issues\r\n  raised, we proceed to review the arguments asserted.\r\nThe\r\n  disposition of attorneyâ€™s fees upon the dissolution of a law firm organized as\r\n  a professional corporation in the absence of an agreement governing the\r\n  dissolution is an issue of first impression in South Carolina.Â  Cognizant of\r\n  the reciprocal and continuing obligations of former law partners, a majority of\r\n  courts apply the principles of partnership law to professional corporations\r\n  where withdrawal of attorney-shareholders results in the dissolution of the\r\n  corporate entity. Â See, e.g., Boyd, Payne, Gates, &amp; Farthing,\r\n    P.C. v. Payne, Gates, Farthing &amp; Radd, P.C., 422 S.E.2d 784, 789-90 (Va.\r\n  1992); Fox v. Abrams, 163 Cal. App. 3d 610, 616-17 (1985); Breaking\r\n    Up Is Hard To Do: Allocating Fees From the unfinished Business Of A\r\n    Professional Corporation, 64 U. Chi., L. Rev. 1367, 1368-79 (Fall 1997). Â Â \r\nUnder\r\n  the principles of partnership law as codified in the Uniform Partnership Act\r\n  (UPA), all partners, upon dissolution, have a fiduciary duty to wind up the\r\n  unfinished business of the partnership and to divide the resulting fees based\r\n  upon each partnerâ€™s interest in the former partnership. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  33-41-370 (2006).Â  Likewise, courts applying a partnership analysis to allocate\r\n  fees from the unfinished business of a law firm organized as a professional\r\n  corporation find work in progress at the time of dissolution an asset of the\r\n  firm in which the partners of the former firm have a fiduciary duty to\r\n  complete.Â  See, e.g., First Union Natâ€™l Bank of Maryland v. Meyer,\r\n    Faller, Weisman &amp; Rosenberg, 723 A.2d 899, 905-07 (Md. App. 1999); Marr v. Langhoff, 589 A.2d 470, 475-77 (Md. 1991); Resnick v. Kaplan,\r\n  434 A.2d 582, 586-88 (Md. App. 1981). Â In determining allocation of fees in\r\n  this context, these courts hold the distribution of fees resulting from\r\n  completion of work in progress, absent special agreement, be allocated\r\n  according to each partnerâ€™s interest in the profits of the dissolved firm.Â  See,\r\n    e.g., Sufrin v. Hosier, 896 F.Supp. 766, 768-69 (N.D.ILL. 1995); Boyd, Payne, Gates, &amp; Farthing, P.C., 422 S.E.2d at 789-90; Sullivan,\r\n      Bodney &amp; Hammond v. Bodney, 820 P.2d 1248, 1250-51 (Kan. App. 1991); Fox,\r\n  163 Cal. App. 3d 610, 616-17.\r\nIn\r\n  the case at hand, the Firm was organized as a professional corporation\r\n  controlled by two attorney-shareholders, Biel and Clark. Consistent with the\r\n  majority approach stated above, application of a partnership analysis is\r\n  appropriate where the withdrawal of the attorney-shareholders results in the\r\n  dissolution of the corporate entity.Â  Here, it is undisputed that the\r\n  withdrawal of Biel and Clark from the Firm resulted in the dissolution of the\r\n  partnersâ€™ professional corporation.Â  Thus, the work in progress associated with\r\n  the three contingency fee cases constituted unfinished business in which Biel and Clark had a fiduciary duty to complete.Â  As such, the resulting fees generated by\r\n  the completion of these three cases during the winding up process are deemed\r\n  assets of the Firm subject to distribution based upon Biel and Clarkâ€™s ownership interest in the profits of the Firm.Â  Therefore, based upon our review of\r\n  the record, we find the fees generated from the three contingency fee cases in\r\n  dispute are assets of the Firm subject to marshalling and distribution between Biel and Clark.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the manner in which the special referee determined\r\n  the allocation of the fees and expenses.\r\nBecause we affirm\r\n  the decision of the special referee as to dissolution and distribution of fees,\r\n  we need not reach the special refereeâ€™s alternative holding regarding unjust\r\n  enrichment.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,\r\n  335 S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review\r\n  remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the\r\n  appeal); see also Weeks v. McMillan, 291 S.C. 287, 292,\r\n  353 S.E.2d 289, 292 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œWhere a decision is based on alternative\r\n  grounds, either of which independent of the other is sufficient to support it,\r\n  the decision will not be reversed even if one of the grounds is erroneous.â€).Â  Â \r\nFinally, Clark argues\r\n  the special referee erred in granting relief that exceeded the relief requested\r\n  by Biel.Â  We disagree.\r\nOur\r\n  supreme court has held that where â€œthe facts alleged are broad enough to\r\n  warrant relief, it matters not how narrow the specific prayer may be if the\r\n  bill contains a prayer for general relief.â€Â  McMaster v. Strickland, 322\r\n  S.C. 451, 454, 472 S.E.2d 623, 625 (1996) (citing Mortgage Loan Co. v.\r\n    Townsend, 156 S.C. 203, 152 S.E. 878 (1930)).Â  In addition to a prayer for\r\n  dissolution and winding up of the Firmâ€™s business and affairs, Bielâ€™s complaint also contains a prayer for general relief.Â  Furthermore, the factual\r\n  allegations of the complaint regarding dissolution of the Firm support the\r\n  special refereeâ€™s division of fees in this manner.Â  Thus, we find the relief\r\n  granted was appropriate. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the order of the special referee is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, THOMAS,\r\nand PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The fee for Southwind II was split between Clark and\r\n  the Mullen firm, which was associated by Clark and/or the Firm to assist in\r\nhandling the case.Â  The $203,291.91 reflects the amount received by Clark after paying 50% of the fee to the Mullen firm. \r\n[2] The balance retained reflects the amount of the fee\r\nreceived after paying the Mullen firmâ€™s fees and expenses.Â  \r\n[3] None of the clients in the three cases at issue\r\ntestified at the hearing.Â  \r\n[4] We find it essential to note that pursuant to Rule\r\n  1.16 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, the right to discharge a lawyer at\r\n  any time, with or without cause, lies solely with the client.Â  As such, any\r\n  indication that the clients in these matters did in fact discharge the Firm\r\n  from representation would significantly impact the decision in this case.Â \r\n  However, the record is deficient of any writing, testimony, or other evidence from\r\n  the client to show the clientâ€™s intent in these three cases.Â  Thus, absent a\r\n  showing that the clients directed otherwise, we cannot find error based on this\r\n  allegation. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-286","title":"State v.

Patrick Smith, both of Greenville, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this civil action, Robert\r\n  Michael Gaddis (R.M. Gaddis) and Robert S. Gaddis (R.S. Gaddis) appeal the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s dismissal of their claims under section 15-36-100 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) and the alternative ground of res judicata.Â \r\n  We affirm.[1] \r\nAs to the professional negligence claim, S.C. Code Â§ 15-36-100(E) (Supp. 2007) provides that a defective\r\n  affidavit may result in dismissal for failure to state a claim unless cured by\r\n  amendment within thirty days.Â  Here, the court never addressed in its final\r\n  order the plaintiffs&#700; request to amend the affidavit or pleadings to\r\n  allege a supervisory theory of recovery and the court was never asked to do so\r\n  pursuant to a Rule 59(e) motion. Â Therefore, the supervisory theory of recovery was never asserted\r\n  by amended affidavit or further developed in the record. Â See Jones v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\r\n    Co., 364 S.C. 222, 235, 612 S.E.2d 719, 726 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œ[A]n issue is\r\n  not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument and\r\n  the appellant does not make a Rule 59 motion to alter or amend the judgment.â€\r\n  (citing Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 501-02, 597 S.E.2d 897, 899\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004))).Â  Similarly, the argument presented on appeal as to the\r\n  effective date of the statute was never raised to the trial court.Â  See Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (noting an\r\n  issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review). Â Thus,\r\n  these issues are not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nAs to the trespass and nuisance causes of action, the trial court\r\n  never explicitly addressed these claims in its final order.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  court was never asked to explicitly address these claims after the written\r\n  order was filed.Â  Accordingly, these issues are not preserved for review.Â  See Jones, 364 S.C. at 235, 612 S.E.2d at 726.\r\nBased on our ruling, we need not address the alternative ground of res judicata as to R.M. Gaddis.Â  See Whiteside v.\r\n  Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993)\r\n  (finding the court need not address remaining issue when resolution of prior\r\n  issue is dispositive).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J., PIEPER, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-293","title":"Kissiah v.

(ESI), an\r\n  employee leasing company.Â  On May 12, 2003, Kissiah was injured while working\r\n  in RPIâ€™s Anderson office.Â  Shortly before his accident, RPI had entered into an\r\n  agreement with ESI for ESI to lease to it part-time employees.Â  As part of this\r\n  contract, the employment of RPIâ€™s existing part-time employees was to transfer\r\n  to ESI. Â ESI memorialized their agreement in a letter dated May 2, 2003, which\r\n  provided:\r\n\r\n\tThis is to inform you that as of 5-1-03, per our previous\r\n  agreement, you have been assigned to our company.Â  The employees will be on\r\n  ESIâ€™s payroll effective 7am on 5-11-03. Â All employees who work after this time\r\n  will be the responsibility of ESI.Â  Our company will cover these employees for\r\n  their workmans comp insurance.Â  . . .\r\n\r\nKissiah was not at work on the Friday before the contract date\r\n  when the other employees completed their employment paperwork for ESI.Â  His\r\n  accident occurred the following Monday, the first working day under the\r\n  contract.Â  On the date of the accident, Kissiah had never heard of ESI.Â  He did\r\n  not complete any paperwork for ESI until June 4, 2003.Â  He had not provided ESI\r\n  with a copy of his social security card at the time of the hearing.Â  \r\nESI employee Lisa Gaines testified that if a person had not filled\r\n  out an application and provided a copy of their photo identification and social\r\n  security card, that person could not be an employee of ESI.Â  She stated ESI\r\n  needed all three items to be able to pay someone.Â  However, she stated that if\r\n  Kissiah provided ESI with his social security card, ESI would pay him for the\r\n  hours he worked on May 12, but he would not be considered an employee until the\r\n  time he submitted the card.Â  \r\nRPI\r\n  paid Kissiah one temporary total disability check after the accident but\r\n  stopped paying without filing or serving a Form 15.Â  Although Kissiah had been\r\n  out of work since the accident, he received no other payments from either RPI\r\n  or ESI. Â When Kissiah filed the present claim, both RPI and ESI denied\r\n  liability and asserted they were not Kissiahâ€™s employer on the date of the\r\n  accident.Â  RPI also asserted Kissiah was injured outside the course and scope\r\n  of his employment and therefore was not entitled to any benefits.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner held Kissiah had sustained a compensable\r\n  injury by accident but had not reached maximum medical improvement.Â  She held\r\n  he was entitled to temporary total disability benefits and continuing medical\r\n  treatment.Â  In addition, the single commissioner found he was an employee â€œin\r\n  limboâ€ between RPI and ESI and ordered both employers to split liability\r\n  50/50.Â  She also held RPI must pay a 25% fine on the amount of temporary total\r\n  disability benefits it owed to Kissiah for improperly stopping the payment of\r\n  benefits.Â  Both RPI and ESI appealed to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  \r\nThe Commission affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s ruling that\r\n  Kissiah had sustained an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of\r\n  his employment and was entitled to benefits.Â  However, it reversed the single\r\n  commissionerâ€™s division of liability and held only RPI was liable for the\r\n  claim.Â  \r\nThe circuit court affirmed the Commissionâ€™s ruling concerning\r\n  Kissiahâ€™s entitlement to benefits.Â  However, it remanded the case to the\r\n  Commission to rule on Kissiahâ€™s motion to alter or amend.Â  In its amended order,\r\n  the Commission held the proposed agreement between RPI and ESI did not affect\r\n  Kissiahâ€™s employment status.Â  As Kissiah failed to meet the eligibility for\r\n  ESI, he remained in the employ and control of RPI on the date of his accident.Â \r\n  RPI appealed this ruling to the circuit court, which affirmed.Â  RPI then\r\n  appealed to this court.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nESI questions whether the issue before this court is\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Generally, the issue of whether a claimant is an employee is\r\n  jurisdictional and therefore the question on appeal is one of law.Â  Nelson\r\n    v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 594, 564 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2002). Â Thus,\r\n  the appellate court can take its own view of preponderance of the evidence on\r\n  the issue of jurisdiction.Â  Id.Â  However, in the present case, there is\r\n  no question that Kissiah is an employee and is covered by the Workersâ€™\r\n  Compensation Act.Â  The supreme court addressed the issue of whether the\r\n  determination of an employeeâ€™s knowledge of a change in the ownership of the\r\n  body shop where he worked, thus relieving the original employer of liability,\r\n  involved jurisdiction.Â  Addison v. Dixie Chevrolet Co., 246 S.C.\r\n  86, 142 S.E.2d 442 (1965).Â  The court found: \r\n\r\n\tIn the case at bar there was no factual issue upon which the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s jurisdiction, in the true sense of the word, depended.Â  It is not\r\n  disputed that the respondent was an employee of Dixie Chevrolet Company and\r\n  protected under its workmenâ€™s compensation coverage at the time when Burn, its\r\n  body shop foreman, took over the shop under the oral agreement before mentioned\r\n  and proceeded to operate it himself, and that respondent's employment in the\r\n  body shop, which had commenced, under Burn more than three years before,\r\n  continued without interruption thereafter.Â  Interpretation of the agreement\r\n  between Dixie Chevrolet Company and Burn is not involved; whether or not\r\n  respondent was a statutory employee is not involved.Â  The seriousness of\r\n  respondentâ€™s injuries was not questioned, nor was the fact that those injuries\r\n  were occasioned by accident arising out of and in the course of his\r\n  employment.Â  The vital, and single, factual issue was whether respondent knew\r\n  of and consented to the new employer-employee relationship resulting from the\r\n  take-over of the body shop by Burn under the oral agreement before mentioned.Â \r\n  That issue was not jurisdictional; its determination by the Commission, being\r\n  adequately supported by the evidence, was conclusive.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 91-92, 142 S.E.2d at 444.\r\nWe find under Dixie, the present case does not\r\n  involve a jurisdictional issue.Â  Accordingly, this court can reverse or\r\n  modify the Commissionâ€™s decision only if the appellantâ€™s substantial rights\r\n  have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is\r\n  clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\r\n  on the whole record.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454, 535\r\n  S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2007).Â \r\n  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed\r\n  from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would\r\n  allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€Â  Shealy,\r\n  341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRPI\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in affirming the Commissionâ€™s decision that it\r\n  was solely liable for Kissiahâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 42-1-130 defines an employee as a â€œperson engaged in an\r\n  employment under any appointment [or] contract of hire, . . . expressed or\r\n  implied, oral or written . . . .â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-130 (Supp. 2007).Â  Although\r\n  no formality is required, the contract of employment is established if the\r\n  parties recognize each other as employer and employee. Â Shuler v. Tri-County\r\n    Elec. Co-op., 374 S.C. 516, 521, 649 S.E.2d 98, 100 (Ct. App. 2007). Â â€œEmployment,\r\n  like any other contract, presupposes understanding. Â The new relation cannot be\r\n  thrust upon the servant without knowledge or consent.â€Â  Chavis v. Watkins,\r\n  256 S.C. 30, 34, 180 S.E.2d 648, 650 (1971) (quoting Holloway v. G. O.\r\n    Cooley &amp; Sons, 208 S.C. 234, 243, 37 S.E.2d 666, 670 (1946)). Â Thus,\r\n  the original employer has been held to be liable to the employee when there had\r\n  been a change in the ownership and the employee had not been put on notice of\r\n  the change of employer.Â  Addison v. Dixie Chevrolet Co., 246 S.C.\r\n  86, 91-92, 142 S.E.2d 442, 444-45 (1965); Holloway, 208 S.C. at 243, 37\r\n  S.E.2d at 671 (1946).Â  The employee is not chargeable with the legal\r\n  consequences of the arrangement between the purchaser and seller of the\r\n  business except as is known and approved by him.Â  Allen v. Phinney Oil Co.,\r\n  241 S.C. 173, 178, 127 S.E.2d 448, 451 (1962).Â  The burden rested upon the employer\r\n  denying liability to show that a change in the identity of his employer was\r\n  made known to employee. Â Chavis, 256 S.C. at 34, 180 S.E.2d at 650.Â  \r\nKissiah\r\n  testified that on the date of the accident, he had never heard of ESI.Â  When he\r\n  was at the hospital he told hospital personnel that he was an employee of RPI.Â \r\n  He stated no one at RPI ever told him that he was no longer an employee of RPI.Â \r\n  Thus, under our precedent, RPI remained liable as Kissiahâ€™s employer for his\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  \r\nRPI\r\n  argues the statutes governing the regulation of professional employer\r\n  organizations South Carolina Code Annotated Section 40-68-10 et seq. (Supp.\r\n  2007) support its claim that it is not liable for Kissiahâ€™s claim.Â  It asserts\r\n  that as the terms of a professional employer organization services agreement\r\n  must be in writing,[2] ESI could not impose additional requirements not found in the written agreement\r\n  as prerequisites of the transfer of employment.Â  Thus, ESI could not assert\r\n  Kissiah was not its employee because he had not completed his paperwork or\r\n  submitted his social security card before the accident.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  issue of the applicability of these statutes was never raised to or ruled on by\r\n  the Commission.Â  Therefore, it is not\r\n  properly before this court.Â  See Smith v. NCII, Inc., 369 S.C. 236, 256, 631 S.E.2d 268, 279 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006) (â€œOnly issues raised\r\n  and ruled upon by the commission are cognizable on appeal.â€).Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the terms of the agreement between RPI and ESI are extraneous to our decision.Â \r\n  As stated above, an employee is not chargeable with the legal consequences of\r\n  the arrangement between employers except as is known and approved by him.Â  Allen\r\n    v. Phinney Oil Co., 241 S.C. at 178, 127 S.E.2d at 451.Â  Kissiah had no\r\n  knowledge of the agreement between RPI and ESI and never agreed to become an\r\n  employee of ESI.Â  We find the Commissionâ€™s decision that Kissiah remained in\r\n  the employ of RPI on the date of the accident is supported by the record.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find the circuit court did not err in affirming the\r\n  Commissionâ€™s decision that RPI is liable for Kissiahâ€™s claim.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] See S.C.

Savitz, III , of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDeputy Director Teresa A. Knox, Tommy Evans, Jr. and J. Benjamin\r\n  Aplin of the South Carolina Dept. of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services, all\r\n  of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant,\r\n  Robert Anthony Hawkins, appeals the partial revocation of his probation,\r\n  asserting there was an insufficient evidentiary basis to establish that he\r\n  violated the conditions of his probation.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nHawkins\r\n  pled guilty in September 2003 to possession of a stolen vehicle and being a\r\n  habitual traffic offender.Â  He was sentenced to concurrent terms of ten years\r\n  suspended upon service of eighteen months with five years of probation for the\r\n  vehicle charge, and five years suspended upon service of eighteen months with\r\n  five years of probation on the habitual offender charge.Â  A probation arrest\r\n  warrant was issued on September 12, 2006, charging Hawkins with failing to\r\n  follow the advice and instructions of his supervising agent by failing to complete\r\n  intake as instructed, as Hawkins left prior to completion of intake and did not\r\n  return.Â  It further charged Hawkins changed addresses without consent from his\r\n  agent, failed to notify his agent of his whereabouts, thereby absconding from\r\n  supervision, and failed to pay his supervision fees, being $160.00 in arrears\r\n  at that time.Â  \r\nA\r\n  probation revocation hearing was held on October 19, 2006, at which time\r\n  Hawkins informed the court he did not agree with the violations.Â  The probation\r\n  agent stated Hawkins reported for his initial intake after being released on a\r\n  previous revocation, but that he left before completing his initial intake.Â \r\n  His agent followed up by trying to confirm his residence and whereabouts, but\r\n  was not able to do so.Â  Hawkins maintained that on September 5, 2006, he\r\n  reported, signed in, and sat in the auditorium where he waited from 9:15 until\r\n  1:00.Â  He stated he had a job interview scheduled for 2:00, so he had to\r\n  leave.Â  He stated he had been jailed on this matter since September 25, 2006.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the alleged arrearage in fees, Hawkins stated that he had â€œonly been out [of\r\n  jail] four daysâ€ from his most recent revocation service, and since the fee was\r\n  $40 a month, he could not already be in arrears in the amount of $160.Â  When\r\n  asked by the court to explain the arrearage figures, the probation agent\r\n  stated, â€œthe only thing I can think is on his revocations, he still had\r\n  arrearages,â€ and that when Hawkins went to jail for the prior revocation,\r\n  â€œthose arrearages followed him.â€Â  Hawkinsâ€™ attorney argued Hawkins was\r\n  previously revoked for having an arrearage, and the State was attempting to\r\n  show a violation for the same arrearage on which he had already had his\r\n  probation revoked.Â  The agent then stated they were not charging him with arrearage,\r\n  but with the fact that Hawkins showed up for his intake but decided to leave\r\n  and had no further contact, and that the agent was thereafter unable to track\r\n  him down at a current residence.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court found Hawkins should not have left the auditorium to go check on\r\n  a job.Â  It then revoked twenty-five days of Hawkinsâ€™ suspended sentences on\r\n  both charges, with credit for time served of twenty-five days.Â  \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  determination of whether to revoke probation in whole or part rests within the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial court.â€Â  State v. Allen, 370 S.C. 88, 94,\r\n  634 S.E.2d 653, 655 (2006).Â  This court will not reverse the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  decision unless that court abused its discretion.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\tAn abuse\r\n  of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based upon an error of\r\n  law, such as application of the wrong legal principle; or, when based upon\r\n  factual conclusions, the ruling is without evidentiary support; or, when the\r\n  trial court is vested with discretion, but the ruling reveals no discretion was\r\n  exercised; or when the ruling does not fall within the range of permissible\r\n  decisions applicable in a particular case, such that it may be deemed arbitrary\r\n  and capricious.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Hawkins asserts the circuit court\r\n  committed reversible error in revoking his probation because the probation\r\n  agent failed to provide a sufficient evidentiary basis to establish he violated\r\n  the conditions of his probation.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn deciding whether to revoke probation, â€œ[t]he trial\r\n  court must determine whether the State has presented sufficient evidence to\r\n  establish that a probationer has violated the conditions of his probation.â€Â  Allen,\r\n  370 S.C. at 94, 634 S.E.2d at 655.\r\n\r\n\tProbation is a matter of grace;\r\n  revocation is the means to enforce the conditions of probation.Â  However, the\r\n  authority of the revoking court should always be predicated upon an evidentiary\r\n  showing of fact tending to establish a violation of the conditions.Â  Thus,\r\n  before revoking probation, the circuit judge must determine if there is\r\n  sufficient evidence to establish that the probationer has violated his\r\n  probation conditions.Â  \r\n\r\nState v. Hamilton,\r\n  333 S.C. 642, 648-49, 511 S.E.2d 94, 97 (Ct. App. 1999) (citations omitted). \r\nHawkins points to the courtâ€™s observation that\r\n  Hawkinsâ€™ case was â€œtoo complicated,â€ as evidence of a lack of evidentiary\r\n  support that Hawkins violated the terms of his probation.Â  However, a review of\r\n  the record indicates the court was speaking to the confusion over the monetary\r\n  figures discussed regarding possible arrearage stating, â€œWeâ€™ve got to have this\r\n  all checked out,â€ and â€œI want a full audit of his money situation.â€Â  Hawkins\r\n  admitted he failed to stay to complete his initial probation intake.Â  Further,\r\n  he offered no explanation for his failure to notify his agent of an address\r\n  change and his whereabouts. Thus, there is sufficient evidence to establish\r\n  that he violated his probation conditions.\r\nFor the foregoing reason, the circuit courtâ€™s ruling\r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-295","title":"SC DSS v.

Brown, Joseph E. DaPore, Russell G. Hines, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Andrew K. Epting, Jr., of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â KCC\r\n  Contractor Inc. appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming an arbitration\r\n  award.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nKCC was the general contractor for the construction of the All\r\n  Suites Hotel on property leased by John Q. Hammons Revocable Trust from the\r\n  City of North Charleston.Â  Osborne Electric entered into a subcontract\r\n  agreement with KCC to provide the electrical work on the project.Â  After a\r\n  disagreement arose between the parties, Osborne filed a notice and certificate\r\n  of mechanicâ€™s lien stating the value of the labor and materials furnished was\r\n  $253,630.82.Â  It subsequently filed an action to foreclose the mechanicâ€™s\r\n  lien.Â  Osborne also asserted claims for breach of contract and quasi-contract.Â \r\n  KCC answered and counterclaimed for breach of contract and negligence.Â  The\r\n  matter was sent to arbitration.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  arbitrator held Osborne was â€œentitled to $165,406.81 for its contract balances\r\n  including change orders after reduction for the appropriate back charges in\r\n  favor of KCC.â€Â  Finding Osborne the prevailing party, the arbitrator also\r\n  awarded Osborne $22,521.20 in pre-judgment interest and attorneyâ€™s fees and\r\n  costs in the amount of $57,592.93.Â  \r\nKCC\r\n  filed an application for a change of arbitration award alleging an â€œevident\r\n  miscalculation of figures or an evident mistake in the description of any\r\n  person, thing or property referred to in the awardâ€ and/or â€œthe award is\r\n  imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy.â€Â  It\r\n  asserted that inherent in the arbitratorâ€™s ruling that KCC was entitled to a\r\n  credit for â€œappropriate back chargesâ€ was a finding that Osborne breached the\r\n  subcontract agreement.Â  Thus, KCC claimed, it was entitled to recover\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and expenses pursuant to the subcontract agreement.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  arbitrator held there was no miscalculation or mistake in the award and that\r\n  KCC was simply rearguing its claim that it was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  based on the contract, which was denied in the arbitration award.Â  The\r\n  arbitrator thus denied the application for a change of arbitration award.Â  \r\nKCC\r\n  filed in circuit court a motion for modification or correction of arbitration\r\n  award while Osborne filed a motion seeking to have the arbitration award\r\n  affirmed.Â  The circuit court affirmed the arbitration award.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nKCC\r\n  argues the circuit erred by confirming the arbitratorâ€™s award and failing to\r\n  grant KCCâ€™s motion to modify or vacate the award.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs a general rule, an arbitration award is conclusive and courts\r\n  will refuse to review the merits of an award.Â  Batten v. Howell, 300\r\n  S.C. 545, 547, 389 S.E.2d 170, 171 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  â€œReview of an arbitration\r\n  award is limited and the decision of the arbitrator will be vacated only under\r\n  certain grounds as provided by statute, or upon the non-statutory ground of\r\n  manifest disregard or perverse misconstruction of the law.â€ Â Lauro v.\r\n    Visnapuu, 351 S.C. 507, 516, 570 S.E.2d 551, 556 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nKCC seeks modification of the arbitration award on the following\r\n  statutory grounds:\r\n\r\n  (1) There was an evident miscalculation of figures or an evident\r\n    mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred to in the\r\n    award;\r\n  . . .\r\n  (3) The award is imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the\r\n    merits of the controversy.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann.Â§\r\n  15-48-140 (a) (2005).Â  \r\nKCC\r\n  argues that under the subcontract agreement, it was entitled to attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees.Â  The agreement provided KCC could recover attorneyâ€™s fees and expenses\r\n  incurred in the prosecution or defense of any action or suit â€œby reason of any\r\n  other breach or failure by [Osborne].â€Â  KCC asserts the arbitratorâ€™s award of\r\n  back charges in favor of KCC established Osborne breached the subcontract\r\n  agreement by failing to perform its obligations under that agreement.Â  Thus,\r\n  because of the arbitratorâ€™s refusal to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the award\r\n  contains an error in the calculation of the amount owed to Osborne and is\r\n  imperfect in its form.Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  this courtâ€™s opinion in Lauro v. Visnapuu instructive for the present\r\n  case.Â  In Lauro the circuit court modified the arbitratorâ€™s award\r\n  finding the arbitratorâ€™s failure to award Lauro the difference between the full\r\n  maximum sum of the contract and the amount Visnapuus paid was a\r\n  â€œmiscalculation.â€Â  Lauro, 351 S.C. at 517, 570 S.E.2d at 556.Â  This\r\n  court noted that the arbitrator had â€œrepeatedly expressed that he had not\r\n  overlooked the matter, but had simply concluded that Lauro was not entitled to\r\n  the difference between the original contract sum and the amount paid, because\r\n  Lauro had not completed the contract.â€Â  Id.\r\nWe explained:\r\n\r\n  Even if the arbitratorâ€™s decision in this regard were erroneous,\r\n    it does not constitute an evident miscalculation of figures as envisioned under\r\n    Â§ 15-48-140. That is, the arbitrator did not commit a mathematical error in\r\n    computing the total amount of the award. Rather, the arbitrator consciously\r\n    declined to award Lauro the full amount of the contract.\r\n\r\nLauro, 351 S.C. at 517, 570 S.E.2d at 556.\r\nSimilarly, in the order denying KCCâ€™s application for a change in\r\n  the arbitration award, the arbitrator emphasized that he had not made a\r\n  miscalculation or mistake in the original arbitration award.Â  He clarified,\r\n  â€œThe credit provided to KCC in the Award was for various items including\r\n  credits agreed to by the parties and work not performed by Osborne after KCCâ€™s material breach of the Agreement.Â  KCCâ€™s failure to pay Osborne is the\r\n  reason that KCC incurred legal fees defending the mechanicâ€™s lien action, not\r\n  because of any breach or failure by Osborne.â€ Â (Emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe arbitrator never found Osborne had breached the subcontractor\r\n  agreement or failed to perform its obligations under that agreement other than\r\n  due to KCCâ€™s breach.Â  The arbitratorâ€™s refusal to award attorneyâ€™s fees was not\r\n  a miscalculation of figures as provided in section 15-48-140 (a) (1).Â  Rather\r\n  it was based on his determination that KCC was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  under the agreement.Â  Similarly, section 14-48-140 (a) (3) is inapplicable to\r\n  grant KCC the relief it seeks.Â  This section allows modification when the award\r\n  is imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the merits of the\r\n    controversy. Â (Emphasis added).Â  The arbitratorâ€™s decision that KCC was not\r\n  entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees clearly involves the merits of the controversy.Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  the circuit court did not err in affirming the arbitration award.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the order of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\npursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-297","title":"Sinkler v.

Ervin, of Charleston, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This\r\n  case arises from a zoning ordinance, which rezoned a tomato farm to a planned\r\n  development district.Â  Upon review, the circuit court found the ordinance invalid\r\n  due to perceived conflicts with the Enabling Act and local zoning regulations.Â \r\n  This court finds no such conflicts and defers to the local governing bodyâ€™s\r\n  judgment regarding this zoning decision.Â  We reverse and reinstate the\r\n  ordinance.\r\n1.Â Theodora and John\r\n  Walpole own the property in question and applied to have the property rezoned\r\n  from AG-15 to PD-96, i.e. from agricultural with some houses to a planned\r\n  development district.Â  Charleston County Council approved the application and\r\n  issued an ordinance rezoning the property as PD-96.\r\nDana\r\n  Sinkler and Anchorage Plantation Homeowners Association (hereinafter â€œSinklerâ€)\r\n  brought a declaratory judgment action challenging County Councilâ€™s rezoning of\r\n  the property.Â  The circuit court found the ordinance was invalid and the\r\n  property was still zoned AG-15.Â  The circuit court found the submitted plan for\r\n  the property did not meet the Enabling Actâ€™s requirements of mixed use,\r\n  improved property design, and specifically designated open space.Â  As an\r\n  additional sustaining ground, the circuit court found the zoning and land\r\n  development regulations (ZLDR) lacked a process to change AG-15 to planned\r\n  development.Â  Charleston County, the Council, and the Walpoles (collectively\r\n  â€œthe County of Charlestonâ€) appealed the circuit courtâ€™s ruling.\r\n2.Â The circuit court\r\n  found the ordinance violated sections 6-29-720 and 740 of the South Carolina\r\n  Codeâ€™s Enabling Act and, therefore, found the ordinance invalid.Â  We disagree\r\n  because of the deference provided local governing bodies and the flexibility\r\n  created through the Enabling Act.\r\nTo provide the\r\n  proper framework, this court first recognizes that a holistic reading of the\r\n  Enabling Act indicates its purpose is to provide the flexibility and ability\r\n  for a local governing authority to make local decisions regarding zoning.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 6-29-720(C) &amp; 740 (Supp. 2007); Dunbar v. City of\r\n    Spartanburg, 266 S.C. 113, 119, 221 S.E.2d 848, 850 (1976) (noting a\r\n  predecessor to the Enabling Act of 1994 was broad in its scope and gave\r\n  municipalities much authority in the field of zoning).Â  The narrow reading of\r\n  the Enabling Act by the circuit court is at direct odds with this intent.\r\nFurther,\r\n  the circuit court exceeded the applicable scope of review because a reviewing\r\n  court should practice judicial restraint and not supplant its judgment for the\r\n  local governing authorityâ€™s judgment.Â  Specifically, our supreme court stated:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    governing bodies of municipalities clothed with authority to determine\r\n    residential and industrial districts are better qualified by their knowledge of\r\n    the situation to act upon such matters than are the Courts, and they will not\r\n    be interfered with . . . unless there is plain violation of the constitutional\r\n    rights of citizens.Â  There is a strong presumption in favor of the validity of\r\n    municipal zoning ordinances, and in favor of the validity of their application,\r\n    and where the Planning and Zoning Commission and the city council of a\r\n    municipality has acted after considering all the facts, the Court should not\r\n    disturb the finding unless such action is arbitrary, unreasonable, or in\r\n    obvious abuse of its discretion, or unless it has acted illegally and in excess\r\n    of its lawfully delegated authority.Â  Likewise, the\r\n    power to declare an ordinance invalid because it is so unreasonable as to\r\n    impair or destroy constitutional rights is one which will be exercised\r\n    carefully and cautiously, as it is not the function of the Court to pass upon\r\n    the wisdom or expediency of municipal ordinances or regulations.\r\n\r\nBob Jones Univ., Inc. v.\r\n  City of Greenville, 243 S.C. 351,\r\n  360, 133 S.E.2d 843, 847 (1963) (citation omitted).Â  This court additionally\r\n  held, â€œ[w]e cannot insinuate our judgment into a review of the City Councilâ€™s\r\n  decision, but must leave that decision undisturbed if the propriety of that\r\n  decision is even â€˜fairly debatable.â€™â€Â  Lenardis v. City of Greenville,\r\n  316 S.C. 471, 472, 450 S.E.2d 597, 598 (Ct. App. 1994) (citation omitted).\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  specifically found the ordinance violated section 6-29-720 of the Enabling Act because\r\n  the ordinance failed to meet the provided definition.Â  Section 6-29-720(C)(4)\r\n  defines a planned development district as:\r\n\r\n  [A] development project comprised of housing of different types\r\n    and densities and of compatible commercial uses, or shopping centers, office\r\n    parks, and mixed-use developments.Â  A planned development district is\r\n    established by rezoning prior to development and is characterized by a unified\r\n    site design for a mixed use development.\r\n\r\nFirst, we note the\r\n  prefatory language before the definitions of possible planning techniques,\r\n  including the above definition for a planned development district, states, â€œ[t]he zoning ordinance may utilize the following or any other zoning\r\n  and planning techniques for implementation of the goals specified above. Â Failure\r\n    to specify a particular technique does not cause use of that technique to be\r\n    viewed as beyond the power of the local government choosing to use it.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-720(C) (emphasis added).\r\nAt oral argument,\r\n  Sinkler argued the County Council did not avail itself of this curative\r\n  language because the County Council utilized one of the definitions.Â  This\r\n  court need not explore Sinklerâ€™s argument as this court defers to the County\r\n  Councilâ€™s judgment regarding the plan.Â  In the ordinance, the County Council\r\n  found that the plan met Article 3.5 of the ZLDR by:\r\n\r\n  Providing\r\n    a greater choice in the type of environment and living units available to the\r\n    public through lot size ranges (minimum of one acre);\r\n  Providing\r\n    more open space land use by 224 acres of common open space land use and an\r\n    additional 345 acres of open space land use on residential lots totaling 569\r\n    acres of the tractâ€™s 747 acres;\r\n  Providing\r\n    a creative approach to the use of land by limiting the total number of\r\n    residential lots to 107, limiting the uses in these areas from that which would\r\n    be allowed in the AG-15 Zoning District, and incorporating existing water\r\n    features into the common open space areas providing for greater wildlife\r\n    habitat area and protecting water quality; and by Providing (sic) an efficient\r\n    use of the land that results in a smaller network of utilities and streets and\r\n    a variety of lot sizes.\r\n\r\nNotably, Article 3.5.1 of the\r\n  ZLDR incorporates the definition of planned development district in the\r\n  Enabling Act.Â  Article 3.5.2 provides the intent for planned development\r\n  districts, which is consistent with section 6-29-740.\r\nTherefore, County\r\n  Councilâ€™s above findings square with the planned development district\r\n  definition provided in section 6-29-720(C)(4).Â  Further, these findings address\r\n  the remaining reasons the circuit court found the ordinance conflicted with the\r\n  Enabling Act: the ordinanceâ€™s believed failure to improve design and character\r\n  of the community under section 6-29-740, lack of mixed use and open space, and\r\n  deficient specificity.Â  Thus, we are convinced the planned development district\r\n  satisfies the threshold statutory requirements provided under section 6-29-720\r\n  and 740.\r\nNext,\r\n  we turn to whether County Councilâ€™s decision was arbitrary or capricious, as\r\n  required by the applicable scope of review.Â  See Bear Enters. v. County of Greenville, 319 S.C. 137, 141-42, 459 S.E.2d 883, 886 (Ct. App. 1995)\r\n  (stating the reviewing court will focus on whether the municipal zoning\r\n  authorityâ€™s decision was arbitrary or capricious).Â  County Council reviewed the\r\n  plan for the property multiple times and the county staff recommended rezoning\r\n  the property.Â  Accordingly, County Councilâ€™s decision was neither arbitrary nor\r\n  capricious.\r\n3. As an additional\r\n  ground for declaring the ordinance invalid, the circuit court held that County\r\n  Council did not intend for a property owner to reduce the residential standards\r\n  of property zoned AG-15 through a planned development district process.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nIn a case recently\r\n  decided by this Court, owners of property adjacent to rezoned land challenged\r\n  the rezoning ordinance, arguing it conflicted with the local ZLDR.Â  Mikell\r\n    v. County of Charleston, 375 S.C. 552, 654 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2007), petition\r\n      for cert. filed (S.C. January 24, 2008).Â  Sinkler acknowledges the uphill\r\n  battle in attempting to distinguish our decision in Mikell.Â  We\r\n  appreciate able counselâ€™s effort to distinguish Mikell, but we find the\r\n  precedent controlling.\r\nIn Mikell,\r\n  the master-in-equity found ZLDR restricted County Councilâ€™s authority to rezone\r\n  the property from AG-10 to PD and remanded the ordinance to County Council.Â  Id. at 556-57, 654 S.E.2d at 95.Â  On appeal, this court found the ZLDR supported County Councilâ€™s decision to rezone the property, and we reversed the masterâ€™s\r\n  ruling and reinstated the ordinance.Â  Id. at 560, 654 S.E.2d at 96.Â  This\r\n  court specifically held ZLDR Article 2.1.2 and section 6-29-740 provide â€œCounty\r\n  Council with final decision-making authority in rezoning actions pursuant to a planned\r\n  development [PD] application,â€ and Article 3.5.7 â€œprovides for deviations from\r\n  other zoning designations.â€Â  Id. at 560, 654 S.E.2d at 96-97.Â  As noted\r\n  in Mikell, â€œthere is nothing to suggest that County Council cannot\r\n  change an ordinance that it created.â€Â  Id. at 561, 654 S.E.2d at 97.\r\nIn\r\n  the case at hand, the circuit court interpreted the ZLDR as barring the use of\r\n  a planned development district to alter AG-15 zoning standards.Â  The circuit\r\n  court noted that the regulations for AG-8 and AG-10 provide a process to achieve\r\n  the highest allowed density rate, which is to make a request through the planned\r\n  development process.Â  No such process is mentioned for AG-15 and AG-25 areas.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the circuit court concluded that the absence of a planned development process for\r\n  AG-15 barred such an action.Â  However, the plain meaning of the statutory\r\n  language does not indicate the home density cannot be increased given the\r\n  discussed power of County Council.Â  Accordingly, there is no conflict between\r\n  the ordinance and the ZLDR.\r\n4. Sinklerâ€™s challenge\r\n  to County Councilâ€™s legal authority fails to show the enacted ordinance conflicted\r\n  with state law or ZLDR; County Councilâ€™s decision was arbitrary and\r\n  unreasonable; or rezoning violated Sinklerâ€™s constitutional rights.Â  We decline\r\n  to substitute our judgment for that of County Council, and we hold the circuit\r\n  court erred in concluding County Council exceeded its lawfully delegated\r\n  authority.Â  Due to this finding, we need not address the County of Charlestonâ€™s remaining arguments.Â  Accordingly, we reinstate the ordinance rezoning the Walpolesâ€™ property as PD-96 and the order of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-298","title":"South Carolina Department of Social Services v.

Ernest Kinard, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-299\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2008 â€“ Filed June 9, 2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tGeneral Counsel Frank L. Valenta, Jr. and Deputy Chief Counsel\r\n  Philip S. Porter, of Blythewood, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDaniell S. Landers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  This is a judicial review of an administrative action.Â  The circuit judge,\r\n  after hearing the matter without a jury, issued an order rescinding the\r\n  suspension of the driverâ€™s license of Respondent William S. Catchings, Jr.,\r\n  directing the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles to refund to\r\n  Catchings a $200.00 license reinstatement fee, and assessing attorneyâ€™s fees of\r\n  $5,065.00 against the Department.Â  Following the denial of its post-trial\r\n  motions, the Department filed this appeal.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn February 24,\r\n  2005, Catchingsâ€™s wife requested the familyâ€™s insurance company to drop\r\n  coverage on a 1987 Ford Bronco.Â  The insurance policy itself, however, remained\r\n  in effect, and the Catchings continued to pay the premiums on their other\r\n  vehicles.\r\nOn March 24, 2005,\r\n  the Department, having been notified of the lapse in insurance coverage on the\r\n  Bronco, sent Catchings an FR4 Notice.Â  In the body of the notice, the\r\n  Department advised Catchings that it had received notice of cancellation of\r\n  insurance on the vehicle and that he should provide proof of liability\r\n  insurance coverage or surrender the tag and registration on the vehicle.Â  The\r\n  notice further stated, â€œFailure to comply with this notice before the\r\n  suspension date will result in the suspension of your vehicle registration and/or driverâ€™s license.â€Â  (Emphases added.) Â In the top right hand corner of the\r\n  letter appeared the notation â€œDate of Suspension:04/21/2005â€ and references to two\r\n  sections of the South Carolina Code.\r\nCatchings\r\n  surrendered his registration and tag at a Department branch office on April 21,\r\n  2005.Â  The Department customer service representative who waited on him\r\n  accepted these items without incident, and Catchings was not told that he owed\r\n  the Department any money or that his license had been or would be suspended.\r\nOn July 29, 2005,\r\n  while driving on I-20 in Augusta, Georgia, Catchings was stopped for speeding.Â \r\n  When the apprehending officer ran a license and registration check, Catchings\r\n  was handcuffed in front of his wife, arrested, and taken to jail for driving on\r\n  a suspended license.Â  Catchings had to sit in jail until his wife located a\r\n  bail bondsman in the middle of the night to bond him out.Â  The arrest was the\r\n  first notice Catchings received of any unresolved issues regarding his driverâ€™s\r\n  license.\r\nThe week after he\r\n  was arrested and jailed, Catchings received a letter from the Department dated\r\n  August 1, 2005, advising that his â€œregistration and/or driving privilege in\r\n  this state will not be suspendedâ€ but also that he had to pay a penalty of\r\n  $200.00.Â  Also, on August 8, 2005, Catchingsâ€™s wife checked the Department\r\n  website to determine the status of Catchingsâ€™s license and found it was listed\r\n  as â€œsuspendedâ€ as of that date. Â Although Catchings retained counsel to attempt\r\n  to resolve the matter, he eventually paid the penalty because his job involved\r\n  driving a company van.\r\nA few days later, Catchings received another letter from the Department.Â  Although this letter\r\n  was dated August 9, 2005, it was essentially a duplicate of the letter dated\r\n  August 1, 2005.Â  In addition, although Catchings never requested reinstatement\r\n  of the registration on the Bronco, the Department sent Catchings a second\r\n  letter, also dated August 9, 2005, indicating this relief had been granted.Â \r\n  According to yet a third letter from the Department dated August 9, 2005, the\r\n  suspension was cleared as of that date.\r\nCatchingsâ€™s\r\n  attorney wrote to the Department on August 23, 2005, in an effort to have the\r\n  suspension voided.Â  In the letter, counsel pointed out that Catchings was never\r\n  an uninsured driver, had never driven an uninsured vehicle, and did not receive\r\n  notice from the Department that his driverâ€™s license had been suspended or\r\n  definitely would be suspended.Â  The letter also contained a request for\r\n  reconsideration of the Departmentâ€™s actions and an evidentiary hearing under\r\n  the Administrative Procedures Act. Â In the letter, counsel for Catchings\r\n  expressed a desire to resolve the matter amicably and suggested his client\r\n  would be willing to waive or release any claims for damages and attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  if the suspension could be voided or rescinded and the charges for driving\r\n  under suspension were resolved.[2]Â \r\n  The record does not indicate that the Department granted any of the requests or\r\n  otherwise responded to the letter.Â  \r\nOn August 26, 2005, Catchings filed a petition for judicial review in the Court of Common Pleas for\r\n  Richland County, the county of his residence.Â  In the petition, Catchings\r\n  sought judicial review of an administrative action pursuant to South Carolina\r\n  Code sections 1-23-380(A) and 56-1-410.Â  The Department filed an answer on\r\n  October 24, 2005, essentially denying the allegations in the petition.\r\nThe matter was\r\n  placed on the Richland County Common Pleas Non-Jury Docket for the term of\r\n  court beginning July 31, 2006.Â  At the roster meeting on July 31, 2006, Catchingsâ€™s attorney was present, but no one appeared on behalf of the\r\n  Department. Â The case was placed on â€œstandbyâ€ status for that week pending a\r\n  scheduling opportunity, and counsel for Catchings faxed the attorney of record\r\n  for the Department a letter advising of this development.Â  In the same letter,\r\n  counsel further advised that he requested a hearing on August 28, 2006, in case\r\n  the matter could not be heard the week of the roster meeting.Â  On August 1,\r\n  2006, a paralegal for the Department faxed a letter to the Chief Administrative\r\n  Judge for the Fifth Judicial Circuit requesting on behalf of the attorney\r\n  assigned to the case protection on August 1 and August 2, 2006, because of\r\n  hearings scheduled in other locations on those days.\r\nThe\r\n  court set the matter for a non-jury hearing to be held at 9:30 a.m. on August\r\n  3, 2006, and on August 1, 2006, attempted to advise counsel for the Department by\r\n  telephone of the upcoming trial.Â  Through miscommunication and oversight,\r\n  however, counsel for the Department did not appear when the case was called.Â \r\n  After an unsuccessful attempt to reach counsel by telephone and a delay of\r\n  about thirty minutes, the trial proceeded without the Departmentâ€™s participation.\r\nAfter the trial, Catchingsâ€™s attorney prepared a\r\n  proposed order, which he mailed to the presiding judge on August 7, 2006, and a\r\n  copy of which was also mailed to counsel for the Department.Â  The trial judge\r\n  signed the order on August 14, 2006, and the clerk of court filed it on August\r\n  21, 2006.Â  The Department received the final\r\n  order on August 23, 2006.\r\nNothing\r\n  more was heard from the Department until September 5, 2006, when it filed a\r\n  motion for rehearing or, in the alternative, relief from the judgment under Rules 59 and 60(b) of the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â \r\n  Catchings sent a response to the motion with a memorandum of law and an\r\n  affidavit of counsel dated September 12, 2006.Â  By order dated December 11,\r\n  2006, and filed December 13, 2006, the trial judge denied the motion, and the\r\n  Department filed this appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nRegarding the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s appeal of the trial judgeâ€™s decision to proceed with the hearing\r\n  in its absence and denial of its motion for rehearing or relief from judgment,\r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court has stated, â€œWhether to grant or deny a motion\r\n  under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the judge.â€Â  BB&amp;T\r\n    v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 551, 633 S.E.2d 501, 502 (2006).Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the merits of the appealed order, we agree with the trial judge that the\r\n  appropriate standard of review of a driverâ€™s license suspension is set forth in\r\n  South Carolina Code section 1-23-380(A)(5), which allows the circuit court to\r\n  reverse the suspension if it (1) violated constitutional and statutory\r\n  provisions; (2) exceeded the Departmentâ€™s statutory authority; (3) was made\r\n  upon unlawful procedure; (4) was clearly erroneous in view of the record as a\r\n  whole; or (5) was arbitrary and capricious, characterized by abuse of\r\n  discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2007).Â  In addition, in a judicial review of a driverâ€™s\r\n  license suspension, â€œthe burden of proof in any such hearing shall be on the\r\n  department.â€Â  Id. Â§ 56-1-410 (2006).[3]\r\nCatchings was\r\n  awarded attorneyâ€™s fees under South Carolina Code section 15-77-300, which,\r\n  under certain conditions, allows a court to award attorneyâ€™s fees in a civil\r\n  lawsuit to â€œany party who is contesting state action.â€Â  Id. Â§ 15-77-300\r\n  (2005).Â  Review of an award of attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to this section is\r\n  subject to an abuse of discretion standard.Â  Heath v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 182, 394 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1990).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  We first address the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s argument that the trial judge acted improperly in hearing and\r\n  deciding the case in the absence of the Departmentâ€™s counsel.Â  We find no abuse\r\n  of discretion upon which to base a finding of reversible error.\r\nIn its memorandum\r\n  of law in support of its motion for a rehearing of the case, the only argument\r\n  the Department made regarding the trial judgeâ€™s decision to hear the case in\r\n  its absence was that it was not provided appropriate notice of the hearing.Â \r\n  The facts related in support of that argument, however, evidence only internal\r\n  communication problems within the Department itself, rather than the failure of\r\n  the court to provide adequate notice.Â  A court employee telephoned the contact\r\n  number listed on the pleadings filed by the Department to inform the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s attorney that the hearing was scheduled and was directed by a\r\n  Department employee to that attorneyâ€™s cell phone number, which, apparently\r\n  unbeknownst to the Department employee, was the number for the attorneyâ€™s\r\n  family cell phone, which he had not carried for several months after being\r\n  issued a cell phone by the Department.Â  Moreover, the Department employee did\r\n  not inquire about the specifics of the court employeeâ€™s telephone call and\r\n  never informed the attorney that the court had attempted to reach him.Â  When\r\n  the attorney did not appear at the hearing, the clerk of court attempted to\r\n  reach him at the same family cell phone number provided earlier by the\r\n  Department.Â  Even if the court could have communicated with the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  attorney by another means, this does not excuse the Departmentâ€™s failure to\r\n  â€œmonitor the progress of [its] case.â€Â  Goodson v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla., 295 S.C. 400, 403, 368 S.E.2d 687, 689) (Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\nWe agree with the\r\n  Department that South Carolina policy favors â€œthe disposition of issues on\r\n  their merits rather than on technicalities.â€Â  Mictronics, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t\r\n    of Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 511, 548 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  We\r\n  also agree that dismissal of a case is a harsh sanction that is generally\r\n  resorted to â€œonly in the face of a clear record of delay or contumacious\r\n  conduct by the plaintiff.â€Â  McComas v. Ross, 368 S.C. 59, 63, 626 S.E.2d\r\n  902, 904 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The outcome of the present case, however, was not a\r\n  dismissal or a default judgment, but rather a decision based on the evidence\r\n  and pleadings, including those filed by the Department.Â  Contrary, then, to the\r\n  Departmentâ€™s suggestion that the trial judge decided against it on a\r\n  â€œtechnicalâ€ ground, the case was decided on the merits after a hearing at\r\n  which, because of mishaps for which only the Department can be held responsible,\r\n  its attorney failed to appear.\r\n2.Â  We further disagree with\r\n  the Departmentâ€™s argument that the trial judge abused his discretion in\r\n  refusing to grant its motion for rehearing or relief from judgment.Â  This\r\n  argument, as presented in the Departmentâ€™s brief on appeal, concerns only the\r\n  application of Rule 60(b), SCRCP, to the present case.\r\nAs noted by the\r\n  Department, this Court, in Mictronics, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, reviewed\r\n  a dismissal of an appeal with prejudice by an administrative law judge after\r\n  the appellant, because of a misunderstanding about the date of the hearing,\r\n  failed to appear at the appointed time.Â  Holding among other things that the\r\n  appellant acted promptly once becoming aware of the mistake, this Court\r\n  reversed the administrative law judgeâ€™s denial of the appellantâ€™s motion to\r\n  reopen the case.Â  Mictronics, 345 S.C. at 511, 548 S.E.2d at 226.Â  \r\nUnlike\r\n  the appellant in Mictronics, the Department did not act diligently under\r\n  the circumstances.Â  At no time did the Department inquire about the hearing,\r\n  even after Catchingsâ€™s attorney sent a proposed order.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Catchingsâ€™s attorney had advised counsel for the Department that he requested\r\n  to have the matter set for August 28, 2006, if it was not reached the week of\r\n  the roster meeting; however, there is nothing in the record suggesting the\r\n  Department made a prompt attempt to verify if the hearing could take place on\r\n  that later date.Â  Finally, even though the Departmentâ€™s post-trial motion was\r\n  sufficiently timely to be considered by the trial judge, we simply do not\r\n  accept the Departmentâ€™s assertion that the filing of its motion â€œwithin ten\r\n  days of receiving notice of the Order is further evidence of its prompt\r\n  response to its mistakes.â€\r\n3.Â  Regarding the merits of\r\n  the case, the Department cites numerous statutes to support its position that\r\n  suspension of Catchingsâ€™s driverâ€™s license was lawful and suggests that\r\n  Catchings was at least partly responsible for the problems resulting from his\r\n  suspension because he failed to present the suspension notice to the customer\r\n  service representative who waited on him or alert that employee to the issues\r\n  of fines or reinstatement fees.Â  Neither argument was raised to the trial judge\r\n  at the hearing; moreover, the various statutes the Department cited in its\r\n  brief on this issue were not referenced in its answer.Â  We therefore hold these\r\n  arguments were not preserved for appeal and do not address them.Â  See Wilder\r\n    Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the\r\n  first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Hickman v. Hickman,\r\n  301 S.C. 455, 456, 392 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œA party cannot use\r\n  Rule 59(e) to present to the court an issue the party could have raised prior\r\n  to judgment but did not.â€).\r\n4.Â  Finally, the Department challenges\r\n  the award of attorneyâ€™s fees, arguing (1) Catchings is not entitled to attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees even if he remains the prevailing party after this appeal; and (2) the\r\n  fees were not reasonable.Â  We decline to disturb the attorneyâ€™s fee award.Â  \r\nCatchingsâ€™s\r\n  attorney presented his fee affidavit at trial, and it was incumbent on the\r\n  Department to present its objections to the affidavit at that time. Â See Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 212, 479 S.E.2d 35, 41 (1996)\r\n  (holding a party could not raise an issue on appeal because it failed to make\r\n  an appropriate objection at trial).Â  Furthermore, although the Department moved\r\n  for rehearing and relief from the judgment, it raised only the issue of whether\r\n  the court had provided appropriate notice of the hearing.Â  Because the trial\r\n  judge was never presented with any objections from the Department concerning\r\n  the award of attorneyâ€™s fees, we hold any arguments concerning this issue were\r\n  not preserved for appellate review.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Although Catchings paid a fine for speeding, the\r\n  charges for driving under suspension were nol prossed after counsel sent the\r\n  letter.\r\n[3]Â  We are aware that the South Carolina General\r\n  Assembly repealed this section in 2006. Â 2006 S.C. Acts 381 Â§ 11, at 2935.Â  The\r\n  repeal, however, was accompanied by a savings clause, which provided as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n\tAfter\r\n  the effective date of this act, all laws repealed or amended by this act must\r\n  be taken and treated as remaining in full force and effect for the purpose of sustaining\r\n  any pending or vested right, civil action, special proceeding, criminal\r\n  prosecution, or appeal existing as of the effective date of this act, and for\r\n  the enforcement of rights, duties, penalties, forfeitures, and liabilities as\r\n  they stood under the repealed or amended laws.\r\n\r\nId.

Hardin, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this breach of contract action, Steve Layne and Jody Layne (the Laynes) appeal\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s partial denial of their motion for a new trial nisi remittitur.Â \r\n  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe\r\n  Laynes hired Gateway Construction Company, Inc., to build a new house pursuant\r\n  to a written contract. Â After Gateway began construction, the Laynes requested\r\n  that Gateway work outside of the contract and amend the construction schedule so\r\n  the Laynes could obtain a particular interest rate. Â The Laynes requested a\r\n  lien release from Gateway as required for the closing. Â Gateway issued a\r\n  conditional lien release stating $50,711.00 remained due on the project through\r\n  July 25, 2003. Â After the closing, the Laynes failed to pay as set forth\r\n  in the conditional lien release. Â Gateway, therefore, ceased construction on\r\n  the project. Â The Laynes subsequently brought this action against Gateway for\r\n  breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act,\r\n  negligence, breach of warranty, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair\r\n  Trade Practices Act. Â Gateway answered and counterclaimed, alleging breach of\r\n  contract. \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Andrew Guliano, Gatewayâ€™s president, testified Gatewayâ€™s damages totaled\r\n  $108,380, including the contract balance of $50,711, $21,073.50 in other\r\n  damages, and $36,595.50 in interest.Â  Gateway reduced the total by $9,000 in\r\n  retainage fees. Â The jury returned a verdict in favor of Gateway in the\r\n  amount of $99,380. Â The Laynes moved for a new trial nisi remittitur,\r\n  arguing the jury awarded compound interest and the verdict included a double\r\n  recovery of damages.Â  The trial court granted the Laynesâ€™ motion as to the\r\n  issue of compound interest and reduced the damages to $92,933.99.Â  The Laynes\r\n  again moved to alter or amend the judgment because the trial courtâ€™s order did\r\n  not address the double recovery of damages issue, and the trial court denied\r\n  the motion.Â  The Laynes appeal.Â  Â \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  Laynes argue the trial court erred in denying their motion for a new trial nisi remittitur to the extent that the damages included a double recovery.Â \r\n  Specifically, the Laynes argue the $21,073.50 Gateway claimed as â€œother\r\n  damagesâ€ was also included in the contract balance of $50,711.00. Â \r\nIn a breach of contract action, the measure of damages is the loss actually suffered as the result of\r\n  the breach.Â  Collins Holding Corp. v. Landrum, 360 S.C. 346, 350, 601\r\n  S.E.2d 332, 333&nbsp;(2004).Â  The amount of damages remains largely within the\r\n  discretion of the finder of fact, as reviewed by the trial judge.Â  Mishoe v.\r\n    QHG of Lake City, Inc.,&nbsp;366 S.C. 195, 201, 621 S.E.2d 363,\r\n  366&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  A motion for new trial nisi remittitur asks the trial court to reduce the verdict because the verdict is merely excessive.\r\n  Â See Oâ€™Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 527, 431 S.E.2d 555,\r\n  556 (1993). Â The denial of a motion for a new trial nisi is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and\r\n  will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â Id.Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either\r\n  lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law. State v.\r\n    McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).\r\n\r\nHere, evidence\r\n  supports the trial courtâ€™s partial denial of the Layneâ€™s motion for a remittitur.Â \r\n  The damages awarded by the jury were within the range of evidence presented at\r\n  trial.Â  Guliano stated he\r\n  used Gatewayâ€™s general ledger to calculate the total cost and damages\r\n  attributed to the project.Â  Â He testified Gatewayâ€™s damages totaled $99,380. Â In\r\n  addition, Gateway introduced an exhibit demonstrating that costs, labor, and\r\n  interest totaled $99,380.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and\r\nKONDUROS, JJ., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\ncase without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-305","title":"South Carolina Department of Social Services v.

(R.8)Â  Entec moved for a supplemental hearing and provided\r\n  affidavits that Stabl has assets to satisfy the judgment. (App.br.2)Â  Seven\r\n  Products Plus, Inc. is the successor to Stabl and Bruce McClure is the\r\n  â€œowner/contact personâ€ for both corporations. (R.123)Â  Entec learned just prior\r\n  to the supplemental hearing that Stabl pledged its receivables to Peoples Bank\r\n  for $1.8 million. (R.21, 47, 48)Â  Within a day or two of the supplemental\r\n  hearing, Entec subpoenaed records from Peoples Bank and Seven Products. (R.30,\r\n  Resp.br.3)Â  \r\nStabl\r\n  moved to quash the subpoenas. (R.30-32)Â  After a hearing, the court granted the\r\n  motion, stating in part:Â  â€œThe testimony of Mr. McClure and the records\r\n  furnished at the hearing are devoid of any direct or circumstantial evidence\r\n  that establishes Seven Products was responsible whatsoever for any of the open\r\n  account invoices upon which [Entec] obtained judgment against Stabl or that [Stabl]\r\n  has engaged in any fraudulent transfer of assets.â€ (R.3)Â  Entec appeals. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nInitially,\r\n  Stabl argues the order on appeal is an interlocutory order, not immediately\r\n  appealable.Â  Entec argues the order makes a final determination of the merits\r\n  of the case, thus making the order appealable under South Carolina Code section\r\n  14-3-330.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2007) (restricting\r\n  appellate review of interlocutory orders).Â  We find the order does not make\r\n  findings on the merits.Â  Furthermore, Stabl concedes in its brief that Entec is\r\n  not prejudiced by the order beyond â€œthe small discovery limitationsâ€ imposed by\r\n  the trial court. (Resp.br.10)Â  We conclude the order is not immediately\r\n  appealable.Â  See Ex parte Wilson, 367 S.C. 7, 625 S.E.2d 205\r\n  (2005) (finding an order granting a motion to quash a subpoena duces tecum,\r\n  issued to a nonparty, is not immediately appealable).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  order on appeal is\r\nDISMISSED.\r\n HEARN, C.J.,\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral\r\nargument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-307","title":"State v.

Sheffield.Â  We reverse. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nSheffield taught special education in Hampton County School\r\n  District 1 (the District). Â In 2004, Sheffield filed a claim for long-term\r\n  disability benefits, alleging she was unable to work because she suffered\r\n  rheumatoid arthritis and SjÃ¶grenâ€™s syndrome.[2] \r\nSheffieldâ€™s\r\n  claim was initially reviewed by Standard Insurance Company (Standard), the\r\n  third-party claims administrator for her long term disability plan. Â Standard\r\n  denied the claim, and Sheffield requested a review. Again, Standard denied the\r\n  claim. Â In addition, Standardâ€™s Quality Assurance Unit denied the claim\r\n  after conducting an independent review. Â Sheffield next appealed to the\r\n  Employee Insurance Programâ€™s Long-Term Disability Appeals Committee (Appeals\r\n  Committee).Â  The Appeals Committee reviewed Sheffieldâ€™s Long-Term Disability\r\n  Income Benefit Plan (the Plan), Sheffieldâ€™s medical records, and all other\r\n  documents contained in the administrative record. \r\nAccording to the Plan, employees are disabled if a physical\r\n  disease, injury, pregnancy, or mental disorder renders them â€œunable to perform\r\n  with reasonable continuity the Material Duties of [their] Own Occupation.â€Â  The\r\n  Plan further provides, â€œOwn Occupation means any employment, business, trade,\r\n  profession, calling or vocation that involves Material Duties of the same\r\n  general character as [the employeeâ€™s] regular and ordinary employment with the\r\n  Employer. . . .â€ \r\nThe job description for a â€œClassroom Teacherâ€ in District 1\r\n  contains the following duties:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tInstruct students for specified time and in \r\n\t\t\tspecified subjects as outlined in the teacherâ€™s contract, the \r\n\t\t\tDefined Minimum Program and according to the districtâ€™s and the \r\n\t\t\tschoolâ€™s policies.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tSupervise students in classroom, in halls, in \r\n\t\t\tlunchroom, on playgrounds and in boarding buses and extra-curricular \r\n\t\t\tactivities.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nKarol Paquette,\r\n  Sheffieldâ€™s vocational case manager, classified Sheffieldâ€™s occupation as\r\n  â€œTeacher, Mentally Impaired.â€Â  Paquette added Sheffieldâ€™s position included\r\n  light physical demands.Â  \r\nThe Appeals Committee also reviewed Sheffieldâ€™s medical records.Â  The records included documents from Dr. Welcker, Sheffieldâ€™s\r\n  family physician, and Dr. Nussbaum, Sheffieldâ€™s rheumatologist. Â In\r\n  addition, the Appeals Committee considered the opinions of Dr. Ingram and Dr. Fraback,\r\n  rheumatologists hired by Standard to review Sheffieldâ€™s medical records and\r\n  provide opinions as to her condition. Â Although Sheffield also sought treatment\r\n  with an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT), she failed to submit ENT medical\r\n  records to Standard or the Appeals Committee.Â  The Appeals Committee,\r\n  therefore, did not review these medical records, and Dr. Ingram and Dr. Fraback\r\n  were unaware of any diagnosis or treatment by the ENT.Â  Â Â \r\nDr.\r\n  Welker, who initially diagnosed Sheffield with rheumatoid arthritis and SjÃ¶grenâ€™s syndrome, opined Sheffield was unable to work due to the\r\n  physical limitations resulting from her conditions. Â He added Sheffield was unable to walk, sit, or stand for any period of time. Â He also noted Sheffield suffered from garbled speech that could prevent public speaking.Â  Dr. Nussbaum noted\r\n  Sheffield suffered joint swelling, stiffness and pain, dry mouth due to\r\n  salivary gland failure, and low back pain.Â  He described Sheffieldâ€™s condition\r\n  as a â€œchronic illness which is unlikely to improve.â€Â  Dr. Nussbaum, however,\r\n  opined by letter dated August 13, 2004, that Sheffield had difficulty with\r\n  prolonged standing and walking, but was otherwise able to work without\r\n  difficulty.Â  Dr. Nussbaum later opined Sheffield could walk or stand for up to\r\n  one hour at a time and Sheffield could walk or stand for four hours during an\r\n  eight hour work day.Â  Dr. Nussbaum added Sheffield could sit for up to two\r\n  hours at a time and she could sit for up to six hours during the work day.Â  Ultimately,\r\n  Dr. Nussbaum concluded Sheffield was not physically able to return to work.Â  \r\nDr. Ingram and Dr. Fraback opined Sheffieldâ€™s conditions did not preclude her from returning to her occupation. Â Dr.\r\n  Ingram found Sheffieldâ€™s medical records â€œdo not show significant rheumatoid\r\n  arthritis, such that her rheumatologist does not recommend that she begin a\r\n  second-line agent, which is recommended in all but the most minimal rheumatoid\r\n  arthritis.â€Â  Â Â Dr. Fraback agreed, finding her rheumatoid arthritis\r\n  appeared to be mild to moderate.Â  With respect to Sheffieldâ€™s SjÃ¶grenâ€™s syndrome, Dr. Ingram commented as follows:\r\n\r\n\tThe dry oral mucosa is documented, as well as at least two years\r\n  of treatment with agents to increase salivary production.Â  There is no mention\r\n  that she has been advised to use oral wetting agents, the typical\r\n  recommendations of sucking lemon drops or frequent sips of water.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  in the classroom, amplification and microphones are easily available to\r\n  teachers and there is no indication she has requested that modification . . .\r\n  .Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Fraback\r\n  noted, â€œWhile she does have SjÃ¶grenâ€™s syndrome, the most recent note from\r\n  the rheumatologist indicated that [her condition] was somewhat better with a\r\n  new drug Evaxac . . . .â€Â  Dr. Fraback added â€œIt would be unusual for SjÃ¶grenâ€™s syndrome to preclude speaking if the speaker had the\r\n  ability to sip water as needed.â€Â  \r\nThe Appeals Committee unanimously denied\r\n  Sheffieldâ€™s claim, finding the administrative record did not indicate Sheffield was unable to perform the duties of her occupation as a teacher for the mentally\r\n  impaired.Â  The Appeals Committee relied on Dr. Nussbaumâ€™s letter of August 13,\r\n  2004 that stated Sheffield had difficulty with prolonged standing and walking,\r\n  but was otherwise able to continue her employment.Â  The Appeals Committee\r\n  further noted Dr. Nussbaumâ€™s opinion that Sheffield could walk or stand for\r\n  four hours and sit for six hours. Â They added Standardâ€™s rheumatologist\r\n  consultants agreed Sheffieldâ€™s claim file did not indicate Sheffield was\r\n  physically unable to perform her Own Occupation. Â \r\nSheffield appealed this decision to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court reversed the\r\n  Appeals Committeeâ€™s decision.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nThe Insurance Program argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in finding the Appeals Committeeâ€™s denial of Sheffieldâ€™s claim was\r\n  not supported by substantial evidence.Â  We agree.\r\nSection\r\n  1-11-710(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) provides:\r\n\r\n\t[C]laims for benefits under any self-insured plan of insurance offered by \r\n\tthe State to state and public school district employees and other\r\n  eligible individuals must be resolved by procedures established by the [South\r\n  Carolina Budget and Control Board], which shall constitute the exclusive remedy\r\n  for these claims, subject only to appellate judicial review consistent with the\r\n  standards provided in Section 1-23-380.\r\n\r\nÂ Pursuant to section\r\n  1-23-380(A)(5) of the South Carolina Code (Supp 2007), an appellate court, when\r\n  reviewing the final decision of an agency, â€œmay not substitute its judgment for\r\n  the judgment of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of\r\n  fact.â€Â  Rather, the decision of the agency should be affirmed unless it is\r\n  clearly erroneous in light of the substantial evidence on the record, is\r\n  arbitrary or capricious, or is affected by other error of law. Id.; see Wilson v. State Budget &amp; Contol Bd. Employee Ins. Program, 374 S.C.\r\n  300, 648 S.E.2d 310 (Ct. App. 2007) (affirming the agencyâ€™s denial of benefits\r\n  and reversing the circuit courtâ€™s award of benefits when the employee submitted\r\n  evidence supporting her disability claim, but substantial evidence to the\r\n  contrary supported the agencyâ€™s decision).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering the record as a whole,\r\n  would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.â€Â  Tiller\r\n    v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr, 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999). Â \r\nHere, Sheffield submitted evidence of her disability. Substantial evidence to the contrary,\r\n  however, supports the decision of the Appeals Committee.Â  As set forth above, Dr.\r\n  Nussbaum stated Sheffield could walk or stand for four hours and sit for six\r\n  hours. Â In addition, Dr. Ingram and Dr. Fraback concluded Sheffieldâ€™s\r\n  conditions did not preclude her from returning to work.Â  Specifically, Dr.\r\n  Ingram and Dr. Fraback agreed Sheffieldâ€™s rheumatoid arthritis was mild to\r\n  moderate and her dry mouth condition was treatable. Â Because substantial\r\n  evidence supports the Appeals Committeeâ€™s decision, the circuit courtâ€™s award\r\n  of benefits is Â Â \r\nREVERSED. \r\nKONDUROS, J., concurs.\r\nSHORT, J., dissents\r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  J., (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent.\r\nI\r\n  recognize the very restrictive standard of review this court must employ when\r\n  reviewing the decision of an agency under the Administrative Procedures Act, as\r\n  noted in the majority opinion.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp.\r\n  2007).Â  After reviewing the Appeals Committeeâ€™s decision with great deference,\r\n  however, I find the Committee erred in denying Sheffieldâ€™s claim.Â  I would\r\n  affirm the circuit court.\r\nSheffield was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and SjÃ¶grens syndrome.Â  Sheffieldâ€™s\r\n  family doctor, Glenn Welcker, saw and treated Sheffield.Â  Welcker referred Sheffield to an ENT specialist, Dr. C. Willy Schwenzfeier, who treated her for the SjÃ¶grens\r\n  syndrome.Â  Schwenzfeier referred Sheffield to a rheumatoid arthritis\r\n  specialist, Dr. Alan Nussbaum.Â  Nussbaum saw and treated Sheffield for\r\n  arthritis, concluding: (1) she had a â€œchronic illness which is unlikely to\r\n  improve;â€ and (2) â€œshe is unable to function as a classroom teacher.â€Â  Nussbaum\r\n  found Sheffieldâ€™s arthritis worsening.Â  Furthermore, Nussbaum responded â€œNeverâ€\r\n  to the insurance form question asking when he expected a fundamental change in\r\n  condition.Â  Welcker likewise concluded Sheffield was unable to continue\r\n  working.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  comparison, the medical opinions relied upon by the Committee to deny benefits\r\n  were made by two physicians, Shirley Ingram and Ronald Fraback, hired by the\r\n  disability plan.Â  Neither of these physicians ever examined Sheffield.Â  Ingram\r\n  opined Sheffieldâ€™s arthritis was not â€œsignificantâ€ because Nussbaum did not\r\n  recommend a particular treatment.Â  Ingram also questioned the impact of Sheffieldâ€™s SjÃ¶grens syndrome because she could not review records of an ENT.Â  However, Sheffield was referred to and treated by an ENT and thereafter by Welcker.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Ingram concluded she was â€œunable to assess [Sheffieldâ€™s] limitationsâ€ as to her\r\n  SjÃ¶grens syndrome.Â  Fraback apparently incorrectly believed Sheffield was never\r\n  referred to an ENT stating his belief â€œan [ENT] consultation would be\r\n  expected.â€Â  Fraback otherwise concluded Sheffieldâ€™s arthritis was only â€œmild to\r\n  moderateâ€ because she was being treated with â€œminimal medication.â€Â  As found by\r\n  the circuit court, these reviewing doctors did not specifically dispute\r\n  Sheffieldâ€™s condition or the physical limitations imposed by Sheffieldâ€™s\r\n  treating physicians.Â  Rather, they advocated different treatment methods.Â \r\n  Accordingly, I agree with the circuit courtâ€™s finding that the Committeeâ€™s\r\n  decision to deny the claim was erroneous.Â  I would affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in\r\n  resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  SjÃ¶grenâ€™s syndrome is a disease that causes extreme\r\n  dry mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-311","title":"Roberts v.

Roberts (Father) appeals the family\r\n  courtâ€™s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nFather and Marcia M. Roberts (Mother) married on July 29, 2000,\r\n  and separated in 2001.Â  Child was born April 26, 2001.Â  Mother and Child moved\r\n  from New York to South Carolina in January 2002.Â  Father remained in New York, where he was incarcerated for an unspecified period of time.Â  Father maintained\r\n  regular telephone contact with Child and sent money to support Mother and\r\n  Child.Â Â  \r\nFather assisted Mother in purchasing a home on Pawleys Island.Â  Although the parties remained married, Mother purchased the home in her name\r\n  only, followed by the notation â€œan unmarried woman.â€Â  Mother notified Father by\r\n  letter that she and Child had moved from South Carolina to California as of\r\n  June 1, 2006.Â  \r\nOn June 19, 2006, Father filed suit in South Carolina seeking\r\n  divorce, equitable distribution of property, and child custody.Â  In August, Mother\r\n  filed suit in California seeking the same relief.Â  The South Carolina family\r\n  court heard Fatherâ€™s motion for temporary relief on September 12, 2006.Â  At that\r\n  hearing, Mother argued South Carolina lacked jurisdiction to hear this matter because\r\n  she and Child had moved from South Carolina to California on February 5, 2006.Â Â Â  \r\nThe family court found neither party lived in South Carolina at\r\n  the time Father filed suit.Â  Furthermore, the family court found jurisdiction\r\n  was proper in California and stated even if South Carolina had jurisdiction,\r\n  the family court â€œwould waive that jurisdiction to the State of California.â€Â  Consequently, the family court dismissed Fatherâ€™s case for lack of\r\n  jurisdiction.Â Â  \r\nOn October 18, 2006, Father filed a motion for reconsideration of\r\n  the child custody and visitation issues.Â  At the hearing on November 28, 2006,\r\n  Father proffered the testimony of Childâ€™s teacher, Leslie Lane Whitley, who was\r\n  also the director of the Montessori school Child attended in Pawleys Island.Â  Whitley testified Child attended her school for at least two years.Â  Child was\r\n  absent from school for three weeks during February 2006 and for five additional\r\n  days between the end of February and May 12, 2006.Â  Child did not return to\r\n  school after May 12, 2006.Â  Whitley further stated Mother had informed her that\r\n  Mother and Child traveled to California in February to assist Motherâ€™s\r\n  boyfriend in cleaning out his house and that Mother and Child would relocate to\r\n  California permanently in mid-May 2006.Â Â Â  \r\nOn January 18, 2007, the family court entered an order finding a\r\n  dispute existed as to the date Mother and Child relocated to California.Â  The\r\n  order also denied Fatherâ€™s motion for reconsideration and required Father to\r\n  pay $500.00 toward Motherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing a decision by the family court, the appellate court has the authority\r\n  to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649,\r\n  652&nbsp;(2006).Â  This broad scope of review does not require the appellate\r\n  court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Wooten v. Wooten,\r\n  364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102&nbsp;(2005).Â  A family court has\r\n  discretion to decline jurisdiction of a child custody matter on the basis of\r\n  inconvenient forum.Â  Mansour v. Mansour, 296 S.C. 215, 217, 371 S.E.2d\r\n  537, 538 (1998).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the\r\n  family court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of\r\n  law.Â  Bryson v. Bryson, 347 S.C. 221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nInitially,\r\n  we note this matter potentially involves South Carolina, California, and\r\n  federal child custody laws.Â  The timing of this action further complicates the\r\n  interaction of laws, because during the pendency of the appeal, South Carolinaâ€™s new uniform act governing child custody matters became effective.Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, requests for relief made prior to June 8, 2007, in child custody\r\n  proceedings are governed by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA)[2] instead of the more recently enacted Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and\r\n  Enforcement Act (UCCJEA).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-6094 (Supp. 2007).Â  Child\r\n  custody actions in California are governed by the California UCCJEA.Â  Cal. Fam. Code Â§ 3400 (West 2008).[3]Â  \r\nAll\r\n  motions or requests for relief in this matter were made and ruled upon during\r\n  or before January of 2007.Â  Accordingly, the South Carolina UCCJA governed the\r\n  family courtâ€™s decision from which Father appeals.Â  \r\nI.&nbsp; Inconvenient\r\n  Forum\r\nFather\r\n  argues the family court abused its discretion by declining jurisdiction because\r\n  South Carolina had the closest connection with Child.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court is the proper forum for child custody disputes in South Carolina.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-400 (1985).Â  However, a South Carolina court may\r\n  decline to exercise jurisdiction â€œif it finds that it is an inconvenient forum\r\n  to make a custody determination under the circumstances of the case and that a\r\n  court of another state is a more appropriate forum.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-796(a) (1985).Â  In determining whether South Carolina is an inconvenient\r\n  forum, the family court must examine factors including, but not limited to, the\r\n  following:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1) \r\n\t\t\tif another state was recently the childâ€™s home \r\n\t\t\tstate; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2) \r\n\t\t\tif another state has a closer connection with the \r\n\t\t\tchild and his family or with the child and one or more of the \r\n\t\t\tcontestants; [and]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3)\r\n\t\t\tif substantial evidence concerning the childâ€™s \r\n\t\t\tpresent or future care, protection, training and personal \r\n\t\t\trelationship [is] more readily available in another state.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-7-796(c).Â  Under the UCCJA, South Carolina defined â€œhome stateâ€ as the state\r\n  in which â€œthe child immediately preceding the time involved lived with . . . a\r\n  parent . . . for at least six consecutive months . . . .Â  Periods of temporary\r\n  absence of any of the named persons are counted as part of the six-month or\r\n  other period.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-786(5).[4]Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the family court did not err in finding a California court was the\r\n  appropriate forum for trial of this matter.Â  The family court had discretion\r\n  under the UCCJA to decline jurisdiction on the basis that South Carolina was an\r\n  inconvenient forum and that another state would be more appropriate.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-796(a).Â  In doing so, the family court weighed several factors and\r\n  found facts favoring trial in California.Â  The family court found neither the\r\n  parties nor Child lived in South Carolina on or after the date Father filed\r\n  this action, both Mother and Child had become residents of California, and California was the proper jurisdiction for determination of divorce and child custody\r\n  issues.Â  Furthermore, under its UCCJEA, California could accept jurisdiction\r\n  upon South Carolinaâ€™s declination thereof.[5]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion in finding California was a more appropriate jurisdiction for trial of child custody issues in this\r\n  case.Â  \r\nWe disagree\r\n  with the family courtâ€™s finding that South Carolina lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â \r\n  Nonetheless, because the family court had both the discretion and a factual\r\n  basis to decline jurisdiction, this finding was harmless error.Â  See Davis v. Davis, 372 S.C. 64, 87, 641 S.E.2d 446, 458 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding\r\n  error is only reversible if material and prejudicial to appellantâ€™s substantial\r\n  rights).Â  Both South Carolina law and California law required six monthsâ€™\r\n  residency before a state could become a childâ€™s â€œhome state.â€Â  Under the laws\r\n  of both states, South Carolina was Childâ€™s home state when Father filed suit.Â \r\n  Mother asserted she and Child moved from South Carolina to California in\r\n  February 2006, four months before Father filed suit.Â  Father asserted, with the\r\n  support of Motherâ€™s letter and Childâ€™s teacherâ€™s testimony, that Mother and\r\n  Child moved from South Carolina in June 2006, just two weeks before Father\r\n  filed suit.Â  However, when Father filed suit, South Carolina was the only state\r\n  in which Child had lived for six months or more.Â  Regardless of whether Mother\r\n  moved in February or June, South Carolina did not lose â€œhome stateâ€\r\n  jurisdiction because of Motherâ€™s move to California.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  the family court erroneously concluded South Carolina lacked jurisdiction.Â \r\n  However, this error was harmless, because the family court possessed authority\r\n  to decline jurisdiction in this matter.Â  The family court correctly concluded\r\n  jurisdiction was proper in California.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Fraud\r\nFather\r\n  also argues declining jurisdiction was an abuse of discretion because Mother\r\n  removed Child from South Carolina unilaterally and committed fraud on the court\r\n  in an effort to defeat South Carolina jurisdiction.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina recognizes fraud on the court as â€œâ€˜that species of fraud which does,\r\n  or attempts to, subvert the integrity of the Court itself, or is a fraud\r\n  perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery cannot\r\n  perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are\r\n  presented for adjudication.â€™â€Â  Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72,\r\n  78, 579 S.E.2d 605, 608 (2003) (quoting Evans v. Gunter, 294 S.C. 525,\r\n  529, 366 S.E.2d 44, 46 (Ct. App. 1988)).Â  To merit vacating a judgment, the\r\n  fraud alleged must be extrinsic.Â  Id. at 80, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (citing Bryan\r\n    v. Bryan, 220 S.C. 164, 168, 66 S.E.2d 609, 610 (1951)).Â  The fundamental\r\n  difference between extrinsic fraud and intrinsic fraud is that extrinsic fraud\r\n  denies the opposing party his day in court.Â  Id. at 82, 579 S.E.2d at\r\n  611.Â  Extrinsic fraud: \r\n\r\n\tâ€œ[I]nduces\r\n  a person not to present a case or deprives a person of the opportunity to be\r\n  heard.Â  Relief is granted for extrinsic fraud on the theory that because the\r\n  fraud prevented a party from fully exhibiting and trying his case, there has\r\n  never been a real contest before the court on the subject matter of the action.â€\r\n\r\nId. at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (quoting Hilton Head Ctr.\r\n  of S.C. v. Public Serv. Commâ€™n, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177\r\n  (1987)).Â  Extrinsic fraud includes subornation of perjury or intentional\r\n  concealment of documents by an attorney, but not by a witness.Â  Id. at 82, 579 S.E.2d at 610-11.Â  \r\nBy\r\n  contrast, equitable relief from a judgment is not available on the basis of\r\n  intrinsic fraud.Â  Id. at 82, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (citing Bryan, 220\r\n  S.C. at 168, 66 S.E.2d at 610).Â  Intrinsic fraud â€œmisleads a court in\r\n  determining issues and induces the court to find for the party perpetrating the\r\n  fraud.â€Â  Id. at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610 (quoting Hilton Head Ctr.,\r\n  294 S.C. at 11, 362 S.E.2d at 177).Â  Intrinsic fraud includes perjury by a\r\n  party or a witness.Â  Id. at 81, 579 S.E.2d at 610.Â  Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  family court did not err in declining to accept jurisdiction on the basis of\r\n  Motherâ€™s alleged fraud.Â  Motherâ€™s misrepresentation of the date she and Child\r\n  moved to California is, at worst, perjury by a party.Â  Perjury by a party is\r\n  intrinsic fraud.Â  Because relief from judgment is not available for intrinsic\r\n  fraud, the family court correctly declined to reconsider its decision.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the family court had discretion to waive jurisdiction even if Mother had\r\n  admitted to moving in June rather than in February.Â  Motherâ€™s alleged fraud did\r\n  not affect the outcome of the case.Â  Consequently, the family court did not err\r\n  in declining jurisdiction despite Motherâ€™s alleged fraud.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe\r\n  find the family court did not abuse its discretion in declining jurisdiction,\r\n  regardless of Motherâ€™s alleged fraud in misrepresenting the date she and Child\r\n  moved to California.Â  Accordingly, the order of the family court in this matter\r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nSHORT\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-782 to -830 (repealed 2007).Â  \r\n[3] If state and federal laws on child custody\r\n  jurisdiction conflict, both South Carolina and California courts defer to the\r\n  provisions of the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C.\r\n  Â§ 1738A (2000).Â  Clay v. Burckle, 369 S.C. 651, 656, 633 S.E.2d 173, 176\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006); In re Marriage of Pedowitz, 179 Cal. App. 3d 992, 999\r\n  (5th Dist. 1986).Â  We see no such conflict in this matter.Â  Consequently, we\r\n  rely on state law to resolve the questions raised herein.\r\n[4] The South Carolina UCCJAâ€™s definition of â€œhome stateâ€\r\n  is substantially similar to the definitions in the PKPA and the California\r\n  UCCJEA.Â  See 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(b)(4) (2000); Cal. Fam. Code Â§ 3402(g) (West\r\n  2008).\r\n[5] Under certain circumstances, a California court may\r\n  make an initial child custody determination concerning a child whose home state\r\n  is elsewhere.Â  For example, a California court may accept jurisdiction if all\r\n  other courts having jurisdiction â€œhave declined to exercise jurisdiction on the\r\n  ground that a court of this state is the more appropriate forum to determine\r\n  the custody of the childâ€ either because each other state is an inconvenient\r\n  forum or because the party seeking California jurisdiction has engaged in\r\n  â€œunjustified conduct.â€Â  Cal.

Elliott, Senior\r\n  Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., of Columbia; and Solicitor Edgar\r\n  Lewis Clements, III, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Appellant\r\n  appeals the family courtâ€™s order finding him guilty of two counts of assault\r\n  with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct (ACSC) in the first degree.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 10, 2006, Appellant was brought before the family court\r\n  for trial on the following charges:Â  (1) two counts of first degree burglary;\r\n  (2) two counts of first degree ACSC; (3) two counts of third degree ACSC; (4)\r\n  three counts of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN); (5)\r\n  two counts of strong arm robbery; (6) three counts of petit larceny; (7) one\r\n  count of attempted strong arm robbery; and (8) three counts of kidnapping.Â  Before\r\n  the trial commenced, Appellant pled guilty to all charges except the four ACSC\r\n  charges.Â  The family court accepted Appellantâ€™s pleas, postponed sentencing\r\n  Appellant on the pleaded offenses until after the trial on the remaining\r\n  offense concluded, and proceeded to conduct Appellantâ€™s trial on the remaining\r\n  offenses.\r\nAt the conclusion of the Stateâ€™s case in chief, Appellantâ€™s\r\n  attorney moved to dismiss the remaining charges on the ground of double\r\n  jeopardy.Â  Appellantâ€™s attorney argued â€œsome of these counts â€“ the testimony\r\n  offered and the allegations made in the counts seem to [mirror] what heâ€™s (sic)\r\n  already pled to . . . .â€Â  The family court ruled â€œ[d]ouble jeopardy is not\r\n  attached.â€Â  Ultimately, the family court found Appellant guilty of both counts\r\n  of first degree ACSC and dismissed both counts of third degree ACSC.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  the trial court violated the double jeopardy clause by finding him guilty of\r\n  two counts of ACSC because he had pleaded guilty to ABHAN under the same set of facts.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Coleman, 365 S.C. 258, 262-63, 616 S.E.2d 444, 446&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (citation omitted), this court stated the purpose of the double jeopardy clause:\r\n\r\n\tThe Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions protect citizens from being twice placed in\r\n  jeopardy of life or liberty. See U.S. Const. amend. V (â€œNo person shall\r\n  be . . . subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or\r\n  limb . . . .â€); S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12 (â€œNo person shall be subject for the\r\n  same offense to be twice put in\r\n  jeopardy of life or liberty . . . .â€). Under the law of double jeopardy,\r\n  a defendant may not be prosecuted for the same offense after an acquittal, a\r\n  conviction, or an improvidently granted mistrial.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Court of the United States has held the Double Jeopardy Clause affords\r\n  defendants three protections:\r\n\r\n\t[It] â€˜protects\r\n  against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. Â It protects\r\n  against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. Â And it\r\n  protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.â€™Â  Where consecutive\r\n  sentences are imposed at a single criminal trial, the role of the\r\n  constitutional guarantee is limited to assuring that the court does not exceed\r\n  its legislative authorization by imposing multiple punishments for the same\r\n  offense.Â  Where successive prosecutions are at stake, the guarantee serves â€˜a\r\n  constitutional policy of finality for the defendantâ€™s benefit.â€™ That policy\r\n  protects the accused from attempts to relitigate the facts underlying a prior\r\n  acquittal, [] and from attempts to secure additional punishment after a prior\r\n  conviction and sentence.\r\n\r\nBrown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 165-66&nbsp;(1977) (internal citations\r\n  omitted).Â  It is well established that ABHAN is a\r\n  lesser included offense of ACSC.Â  See State v. Elliott,\r\n  346 S.C. 603, 607, 552 S.E.2d 727, 729&nbsp;(2001) (overruled on other\r\n  grounds).\r\nIn Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 493 (1984), the Supreme Court of the United States\r\n  addressed the implications of the Double Jeopardy Clause when a defendant\r\n  pleads guilty to a lesser included offense.Â  The court stated â€œ[t]he acceptance\r\n  of a guilty plea to lesser included offenses while charges on the greater\r\n  offenses remain pending, moreover, has none of the implications of an â€˜implied\r\n  acquittalâ€™ which results from a verdict convicting a defendant on lesser\r\n  included offenses rendered by a jury charged to consider both greater and\r\n  lesser included offenses.â€Â  Id. at 501-2.Â  The court found that\r\n  prosecution of the greater offenses was not barred by the Double Jeopardy\r\n  Clause and, specifically held â€œ[w]hile the Double Jeopardy Clause may protect a\r\n  defendant against cumulative punishments for convictions on the same offense,\r\n  the Clause does not prohibit the State from prosecuting [a defendant] for such\r\n  multiple offenses in a single prosecution.â€Â  Id. at 500.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Appellant pleaded guilty to lesser offenses.Â  The trial court accepted the\r\n  pleas and held the matter of sentencing in abeyance until Appellant was tried\r\n  for the remaining offenses. Â Immediately following the acceptance of the guilty\r\n  pleas, the trial for the remaining charges was conducted.Â  At the conclusion of\r\n  the trial, the trial court found Appellant guilty of both counts of first degree ACSC, dismissed\r\n  both counts of third degree ACSC, and committed Appellant to the custody of the\r\n  Department of Juvenile Justice not to exceed his twenty-first birthday.Â  Appellant was not subjected to cumulative punishments\r\n  for convictions on the same offenses.Â  Accordingly, we find no violation of the\r\n  Double Jeopardy Clause.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON,\r\n  SHORT, and THOMAS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-313","title":"State v.

Groves, of Charleston, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Thomas\r\n  Dewey Wise and Island Preservation Company[1] (collectively referred to as Wise) appeal from the special refereeâ€™s\r\n  determination that: Â (1) an unpaved pathway running along the north-south\r\n  corridor of the west side of South Fenwick Island (referred to as the Main\r\n  Road) was impliedly dedicated to the public or a neighborhood road; (2) Wise\r\n  does not possess a prescriptive easement over any portion of the Main Road; (3)\r\n  Wise does not possess a prescriptive easement or an easement by necessity\r\n  across Tract 19 on what is referred to as the Spur Road; and (5) Wise can\r\n  access his landlocked property on Tract 3 from a relocated way.Â  We affirm.[2] \r\nFACTS\r\nSouth Fenwick Island is a remote island of approximately 500 acres\r\n  located in Colleton County.Â  The Island has no paved roads or public utilities\r\n  and is accessible only by boat.Â  Until the 1960s, several families lived on the\r\n  Island, where they cultivated crops and raised livestock. Â A church and a\r\n  public school were located adjacent to the Main Road.Â  Since 1960, portions of\r\n  the Island have been sold, and today it is used primarily for hunting and\r\n  fishing.Â  Although no one currently lives on the Island, some of the\r\n  original owners still have property on the Island that they visit\r\n  periodically.Â  \r\nIn 1984, Wise began purchasing property on the Island including\r\n  Tract 10 on the south and center sections and Tract 3 on the north end.Â  Wise\r\n  currently owns Tracts 1, 3, 4, 10, and 21.Â  He keeps farm equipment, trucks,\r\n  and three-wheel vehicles on the Island, but does not have a residence there.Â  In\r\n  1996, South Fenwick and Lavington Associates (collectively referred to as\r\n  â€œSouth Fenwickâ€) purchased Tract 15 on the south end and subsequently purchased\r\n  Tracts 18, 19, and 20 on the north end.Â  David Maybank, Jr., who manages the\r\n  property held by South Fenwick, testified that Wise erected a gate in 2004 that\r\n  blocked the Main Road and told Maybank to stop using that section of the Main Road.Â  \r\nWise and his witnesses testified that from\r\n  1985 to 1997 they accessed the east side of Tract 1 by crossing Tracts 2, 19,\r\n  and 4.Â  After Wise purchased Tract 4 in 1997, they continued to cross Tracts 2\r\n  and 19 without seeking permission from the owners.Â  Wise testified there were\r\n  no issues until South Fenwick purchased Tract 19 in March 2005 and erected a\r\n  fence that blocked Wiseâ€™s preferred access to his property on Tract 1 along a\r\n  pathway referred to as Spur Road.[3]Â \r\n  Wise erected a barrier across the Main Road at Tract 21 precluding South\r\n  Fenwickâ€™s use of the road to access its Tracts 18, 19, and 20.Â  \r\nWise brought this action against South Fenwick seeking a\r\n  determination that he had acquired: Â (1) a prescriptive easement over the Main Road and (2) a prescriptive easement or, alternatively, an easement by necessity over\r\n  Tract 19 to access his property on Tracts 1 and 3.Â  South Fenwick\r\n  counterclaimed, asserting the Main Road had been impliedly dedicated to the\r\n  property or was a neighborhood road allowing general use by the public.Â  In\r\n  addition, it denied Wiseâ€™s right to an easement over Tract 19.[4]Â  Wise replied and did not assert any\r\n  affirmative defenses to South Fenwickâ€™s counterclaims.Â  \r\nWith the partiesâ€™ consent, the circuit court appointed Marvin\r\n  Infinger as special referee.Â  The referee held:Â  (1) the Main Road had been\r\n  impliedly dedicated to the public; (2) the Main Road was a public road under\r\n  the doctrine of neighborhood road; (3) Wise did not have a prescriptive\r\n  easement over the Main Road; (4) Wise must immediately remove obstructions he\r\n  placed on the Main Road; (5) Wise did not possess a prescriptive easement or\r\n  easement by necessity on the Spur Road (6) Wise was entitled to an easement by\r\n  necessity running between Tracts 4 &amp; 3 and across Tract 19, fifteen feet\r\n  wide by twenty feet long.Â  Subsequently, both parties filed motions to alter or\r\n  amend the final order.Â  On April 20, 2007, the referee denied Wiseâ€™s post-trial\r\n  motions and granted South Fenwickâ€™s motion, clarifying that Wise was not\r\n  allowed to block the Community Road.Â  Wiseâ€™s appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in an action\r\n  at law. Â Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 165, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541 (2006). Â â€œHowever,\r\n  the determination of the scope of the easement is a question in equity.â€Â  Id. Â â€œThe determination of whether a road has been dedicated to public use is one in equity.â€Â  Vick v.\r\n    S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 347 S.C. 470, 477, 556 S.E.2d 693, 697 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001). Â \r\nâ€œIn\r\n  an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of\r\n  fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without\r\n  evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Townes Assocs.,\r\n    Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  In an action in equity, this court may view the facts\r\n  in accordance with our preponderance of the evidence.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher\r\n    Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989).Â  However, we\r\n  should not disregard the findings of the special referee, who was in a better\r\n  position to weigh the credibility of witnesses.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Main Road \r\nA.&nbsp; Indispensable\r\n  Parties\r\nWise\r\n  argues the referee erred in determining the Main Road is a dedicated public or\r\n  neighborhood road without first requiring South Fenwick to add Colleton County and all owners of property or easements adjacent to the Main Road as\r\n  indispensable parties.Â  We find this issue is not properly before the court.\r\nThe defense\r\n  of failure to join indispensable parties is waived if not raised at trial. Â Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys.\r\n    &amp; Serv., 343 S.C. 587, 596, 541 S.E.2d 257, 262 (2001) (citing Rule\r\n  12(h)(2), SCRCP).Â  Wise brought this action seeking a declaration of his rights\r\n  to the Community Road.Â  As the complaining party, Wise named only South Fenwick and Lavington Associates as defendants.Â  In responding to South Fenwickâ€™s\r\n  counterclaims seeking a determination that the Main Road had been dedicated to\r\n  the public, Wise failed to plead the affirmative defense of failure to join\r\n  indispensable parties pursuant to 12(b)(7), South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â \r\n  There is no indication in the record that the issue of the failure to add\r\n  indispensable parties was tried by consent.Â  Wiseâ€™s attorney questioned\r\n  whether Maybank represented Colleton County and asserted Maybank did not have\r\n  standing or the right to accept a road on behalf of Colleton County.Â  However, Wise never asserted the action must fail due to the failure to add Colleton County as a party.Â  As the special referee\r\n  noted in his order on the post-trial motions, â€œ[t]he issue of whether\r\n  indispensable parties should be added was not raised by either party.â€Â \r\n  Instead, Wise raised the issue of the failure to add all of the neighboring\r\n  landowners for the first time in his motion to alter or amend.Â  A party cannot\r\n  use a motion to reconsider, alter or amend a judgment to present an issue that\r\n  could have been raised prior to the judgment but was not.Â  Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct.App.1995). Â Accordingly,\r\n  we find the issue of failure to join alleged indispensable parties is not\r\n  preserved for this courtâ€™s review. Â \r\nB.&nbsp; Implied\r\n  dedication\r\nWise\r\n  argues the referee erred in determining the Main Road had been impliedly\r\n  dedicated to the public many decades earlier.Â  Specifically, Wise states there\r\n  is â€œscantâ€ evidence of intent to dedicate the road to the public and â€œno\r\n  evidenceâ€ of the publicâ€™s acceptance of the implied dedication.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  party seeking to establish dedication must prove two elements:Â  (1) the owner\r\n  must express in a positive and an unmistakable manner the intention to dedicate\r\n  his property to public use, and (2) there must be, within a reasonable time, an\r\n  express or implied public acceptance of the property offered for dedication. Â Tupper\r\n    v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 326, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191-92 (1997).Â  Intent\r\n  to dedicate may be implied from long public use of the land to which the owner\r\n  acquiesces.Â  Hoogenboom v. City of Beaufort, 315 S.C. 306, 317, 433 S.E.2d\r\n  875, 883 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  No formal acceptance by the public of an offer of\r\n  dedication is necessary, and acceptance of the offer may be implied in various\r\n  ways, including a showing of public use.Â  Van Blarcum v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 337 S.C. 446, 451, 523 S.E.2d 486, 489 (Ct. App. 1999). Â Proof of\r\n  dedication must be strict, cogent, and convincing.Â  Tupper, 326 S.C. at\r\n  326, 487 S.E.2d at 192.Â  \r\nThe Main Road appeared on government maps and charts as early as 1919.Â  Arthur Buster Whaley,\r\n  who was born on the Island in 1925 and lived there until 1965, testified in a\r\n  deposition in another case that his family had owned property on the Island.Â  Whaley had inherited Tracts 7, 14, and 21; however, by 2003, he owned only Tract\r\n  7.Â  Whaley stated about sixteen families lived on the Island during the 1940s.Â \r\n  According to Whaley, a road ran from the cut at the north end â€œstraight through\r\n  the plantation,â€ and families used this road to walk to church, to visit each\r\n  other, and to drive horse-drawn carts from the landing to their homes.Â  Whaley said the residents of the Island maintained the Main Road.Â  Whaley added\r\n  that each family had its own wagon and it was not necessary for them to obtain\r\n  permission to travel on the Main Road.Â  Everyone simply used the road.Â  Whaley\r\n  stated that neither he nor Wise ever prohibited the other from using sections\r\n  of the Main Road.Â  \r\nKenneth\r\n  Hodges, a fifty-five-year-old Baptist minister, testified his great-great\r\n  grandfather, Dave Smalls, once owned most of the Island.Â  Although Hodgesâ€™s\r\n  family now owns only a small parcel, he visited the Island several times a\r\n  year.Â  Hodges stated Island residents used the Main Road to reach the school,\r\n  the church, and their individual properties.Â  According to Hodges, â€œThe\r\n  properties are still there so the need [for the road] is still there.â€Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1980, Willie Hopkins sold Tract 19 to Wiseâ€™s predecessors in title.Â  In a 1995\r\n  affidavit, Hopkins stated: â€œ[T]here was a path wide enough for two ox carts to\r\n  pass (about 20 feet) that was used by my family and neighbors to the east to\r\n  get back and forth to the government cut.Â  We all used it and considered it a\r\n  path for all persons.â€Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 30, 2002, Wise filed an action seeking a declaration that he was\r\n  entitled to use the Main Road based upon the legal theory that the Main Road was a thoroughfare available to all property owners.[5]Â \r\n  In that action, Wiseâ€™s complaint asserted: \r\n\r\n\tTheir\r\n  (sic) exists and has existed for well over 50 years, a dirt road running\r\n  parallel to the Ashepoo River in a generally north to south orientation along\r\n  most of the island.Â  The purpose of this road was to allow property owners to\r\n  travel across the island.Â  Many former residents of the island including the\r\n  Defendant Whaley, the Plaintiffs and their predecessors in title owned property\r\n  on the island and used the road.Â  There was at one time located on South Fenwick Island both a school and a church.Â  Both were located adjacent to the road in\r\n  question and the road in question was a common thoroughfare used by all to\r\n  travel to the school and to the church and to visit their properties. \r\n\r\nWe\r\n  find the evidence supports the refereeâ€™s decision that South Fenwick had\r\n  established an implied dedication of the Main Road.Â  The record is replete with\r\n  evidence that the Main Road had been used for over fifty years by the residents\r\n  and property owners of the Island as they traveled over the Island to go to the\r\n  school, church, and each otherâ€™s residents, and to haul supplies from the main\r\n  land to their homes.Â  This long-term use to which the owners of the property\r\n  acquiesced establishes an intent to dedicate.Â  Similarly, the long-term use\r\n  along with the residentsâ€™ maintenance of the road establishes an acceptance of\r\n  the dedication by the public.Â  \r\nC.Â \r\n  Neighborhood Road\r\nAs we find the Main Road was impliedly dedicated to the public, we need not address the doctrine of\r\n  neighborhood road.Â  \r\nD.Â \r\n  Abandonment\r\nWise\r\n  additionally contends the referee erred in failing to find Main Road had been\r\n  abandoned.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  supreme court found an unmaintained road that became public by dedication or\r\n  through prescriptive or long-established use had not been abandoned because no\r\n  interested person had instituted an action under the statutory process to\r\n  effect an abandonment of the road.Â  It held, â€œThe circuit court correctly\r\n  concluded [the] Road remains publicly accessible because no formal action has\r\n  been instituted to abandon it pursuant to [statute[6]].â€\r\n  Â S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp. v. Hinson Family Holdings, LLC, 361 S.C. 649,\r\n  655-56, 606 S.E.2d 781, 785 (2004). Â In this case, there has been no action to\r\n  abandon the Main Road.Â  We find the evidence supports the\r\n  refereeâ€™s conclusion that the Main Road had not been abandoned. \r\nE.Â \r\n  Prescriptive easement\r\nWise\r\n  asserts the referee erred in failing to rule Wise had obtained a prescriptive\r\n  easement over the Main Road.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  disagree.Â  This court held a plaintiff did not establish a private right under\r\n  a prescriptive easement because he failed to produce evidence that his use was\r\n  exclusive and was different from the right which could be asserted by members\r\n  of the general public.Â  Cleland v. Westvaco, 314 S.C. 508, 511, 431\r\n  S.E.2d 264, 266 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  As stated above, the Main Road had been\r\n  dedicated to general public use.Â  Wiseâ€™s right to use the Main Road was no\r\n  different than the publicâ€™s right.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the refereeâ€™s\r\n  determination that Wise does not have a prescriptive easement.\r\nII.&nbsp; Spur Road\r\nA.Â \r\n  Prescriptive easement\r\nWise\r\n  argues the referee erred in holding he did not hold a prescriptive easement\r\n  over Tract 19 to access the eastern section of Tract 1 from the Main Road on\r\n  what is called the Spur Road.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  order to establish a prescriptive easement, a party must prove:Â  \r\n\r\n\tÂ (1)\r\n  continued use for 20 years, (2) the identity of the thing enjoyed, and (3) use\r\n  which is either adverse or under a claim of right.Â  When the claimant has\r\n  established that the use was open, notorious, continuous, and uninterrupted,\r\n  the use will be presumed to have been adverse.Â  \r\n\r\nBoyd v. Bellsouth Tel. Tel.\r\n  Co., 369 S.C. 410, 419-20, 633 S.E.2d\r\n  136, 141 (2006).Â  \r\nWise\r\n  purchased Tract 1 in 1985 and contends he created the Spur Road, which crosses\r\n  Tracts 2, 19, and 4, to avoid the marsh when traveling from the Main Road to the eastern side of Tract 1.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  Wise and his witnesses claimed they had used the Spur Road since Wise created\r\n  it in 1984 or 1985, several witnesses testified the Spur Road had not existed\r\n  until more recently.Â  Kenneth Hodges testified his family owned Tract 2 for\r\n  generations and there was not a bush-hogged road across it since 1984 or 1985.Â \r\n  Similarly, Harold Rourk, who owned Tract 4 from 1979 to 1996, testified he had\r\n  never seen bush hogging across his property.Â  Regarding the Spur Road, Rourk\r\n  testified: â€œIs that road supposed to be on the property that I owned?Â  Iâ€™ve\r\n  never seen that road before.â€Â  Rourk additionally testified, â€œThat was my\r\n  property.Â  I would notice if somebody had been on it.â€Â  Robert Frank, who\r\n  surveyed Tract 4 in 1995, stated he never saw â€œthe manmade Spur Road that is in\r\n  dispute.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  referee held that in order for Wise to claim a prescriptive easement, his use\r\n  of the road must be open and notorious.Â  Considering the above testimony, the\r\n  referee held the claimed pathway was not sufficiently visible and open to place\r\n  South Fenwick on notice that its property was being invaded by Wise and thus\r\n  Wise had acquired no right by prescription.Â  \r\nWise\r\n  does not claim he did not have to establish his use was open and notorious.Â \r\n  Rather, he challenges the credibility of the above witnesses.Â  However, the\r\n  credibility of testimony is a matter for the finder of fact to judge.Â  â€œCredibility\r\n  determinations regarding testimony are a matter for the finder of fact, who has\r\n  the opportunity to observe the witnesses, and those determinations are entitled\r\n  to great deference on appeal.â€ Â Okatie River, L.L.C. v.\r\n    Southeastern Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 338, 557 S.E.2d 468, 474 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2003).Â  Wise also takes issue with South Fenwickâ€™s failure to call Harry\r\n  Turner, the former owner of Tract 19, as a witness.Â  â€œIt is a well settled rule\r\n  that if a party knows of the existence of an available witness on a material\r\n  issue and such witness is within his control and if without satisfactory\r\n  explanation he fails to call him, the jury may draw the inference that the\r\n  testimony of the witness would not have been favorable to such party.Â  Duckworth\r\n    v. First National Bank, 254 S.C. 563, 577, 176 S.E.2d 297, 304 (1970).Â  However,\r\n  this rule only applies when the witness is in the control of the party and is\r\n  available.Â  Id.Â  Here, there is no evidence Harry Turner was in the\r\n  control of South Fenwick.Â  Therefore, no inference concerning his testimony\r\n  could be drawn. Â \r\nWise asserts his\r\n  and his witnessesâ€™ testimony concerning the use of Tract 19 was uncontradicted\r\n  because the South Fenwickâ€™s witnesses only testified about the lack of\r\n  visibility of the Spur Road on the other tracts rather than on Tract 19.Â  We\r\n  find it reasonable for the referee to find Wiseâ€™s use of Tract 19 was no more\r\n  open and notorious than it was on the other tracts along which the Spur Road ran.Â  Furthermore, â€œthe fact that testimony is not contradicted directly does not\r\n  render it undisputed.â€ Okatie River, 353 S.C. at 338, 557 S.E.2d\r\n  at 474.\r\nWe\r\n  find the record supports the refereeâ€™s finding that Wiseâ€™s use of the Spur Road was not open and notorious.Â  Therefore, we must affirm his ruling that Wiseâ€™s\r\n  claim for a prescriptive easement fails.Â  \r\nB.Â \r\n  Easement by necessity\r\nWise\r\n  argues the referee erred in holding he did not possess and easement by\r\n  necessity over Tract 19.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  party asserting the right of an easement by necessity must demonstrate:Â  (1)\r\n  unity of title, (2) severance of title, and (3) necessity.Â  Kennedy v.\r\n    Bedenbaugh, 352 S.C. 56, 60, 572 S.E.2d 452, 454 (2002).\r\n\r\n\tOnly reasonable necessity is\r\n  required; thus, the easement must be more than merely convenient, but it does\r\n  not need to be absolutely essential. Â However, the whole point of the easement\r\n  by necessity doctrine is to ensure that landlocked parcels have access to a public\r\n  road . . . .Â  The doctrine only provides reasonable access to the dominant estate when there is\r\n  none; it does not provide a means for ensuring a preferred method of access to\r\n  a particular portion of a tract when access to the tract is otherwise\r\n  available.\r\n\r\nMorrow v. Dyches, 328 S.C. 522, 529, 492 S.E.2d 420, 424 (Ct. App. 1997)\r\n  (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Special Referee held: \r\n\t\r\n\t\tReasonable\r\n  access exists to Tract 1 via the [Main Road] to the western high land portion\r\n  of Tract 1.Â  This being the case, additional access over Tract 19 to the\r\n  eastern portion of Tract 1 would be tantamount to providing [Wise] â€œa means for\r\n  ensuring a preferred method of access to a particular portion of a tract when\r\n  access to the tract is otherwise available.â€ [quoting Morrow, 328 S.C.\r\n  at 529, 492 S.E.2d at 424.]Â  Hence, imposition of a way by necessity can not be\r\n  justified, as a matter of law.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nWise did not\r\n  challenge this ruling.Â  Accordingly, it is the law of the case.Â  See Charleston\r\n    Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871\r\n  (2000) (finding that an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the\r\n  case and requires affirmance).\r\nIn addition, the\r\n  referee found that the evidence respecting a total breach of Tract 4 is\r\n  unclear, and a total, or at least essentially a total breach was essential for\r\n  Wiseâ€™s claim.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  a sketch of the property prepared by Jerry L. Fowler for Wise in 2006 shows the\r\n  marsh crossing Tract 4 into Tract 19, a 1995 boundary survey of Tract 4\r\n  prepared by Robert Frank for Clarence H. Rourk, Jr. shows the critical area\r\n  protruding into Tract 4 but not completely crossing it.Â  Similarly, a composite\r\n  sketch of the Island by Robert Frank Surveying shows the marsh protruding into\r\n  Tract 4 but also not obstructing it completely.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  in a letter Wise wrote prior to his purchase of Tract 4, he stated, â€œAttached\r\n  to this fax will be found the most recent version of Colleton County Tax Map\r\n  Number 345.Â  Looking at the tax map, it is apparent that the marsh area of my\r\n  property does not intrude on the strip of land for Lot No. 4 which is contrary\r\n  to what is reflected on the Robert Frank survey.â€Â  \r\nWe find evidence in\r\n  the record supporting the refereeâ€™s determination that Wise had not established\r\n  entitlement to an easement by necessity over the Spur Road to the eastern\r\n  portion of Tract 1.Â  Considering our limited standard of review, we find no\r\n  error in this ruling.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Easement of necessity\r\n  to access Tract 3 \r\nWise\r\n  additionally contends the referee erred in relocating an easement to provide\r\n  access to his Tract 3. We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œA\r\n  court using its equity powers may relocate an easement when the relocation will\r\n  not â€˜(a) significantly lessen the utility of the easement, (b) increase the\r\n  burdens on the owner of the easement in its use and enjoyment, or (c) frustrate\r\n  the purpose for which the easement was created.â€™â€Â  Goodwin v. Johnson,\r\n  357 S.C. 49, 53, 591 S.E.2d 34, 36 (Ct.App.2003) (quoting Restatement (Third)\r\n  of Property:Â  Servitudes Â§ 4.8 (2000)).\r\nThe\r\n  relocated easement is approximately fifteen feet wide by twenty feet long,\r\n  providing access to Tract 3 from Tract 4 by crossing Tract 19.Â  The\r\n  refereeâ€™s placement of the easement properly balances Wiseâ€™s need to reach\r\n  landlocked Tract 3 from Tract 4 with the resulting burden placed on South Fenwickâ€™s servient estate. Â We find the referee did not err in his placement\r\n  of the easement.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the order of the special referee is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Island Preservation Company is a family limited\r\npartnership.Â  Wise is the general partner.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] The Spur\r\n  Road runs from the Main Road at Tract 2, across Tracts 19 and 4, to Tract 1; an â€œoffshootâ€ of the Spur Road runs from Tract 4, across Tract 19, to Tract 3.Â  \r\n[4] On\r\n  June 6, 2006, the court granted Wiseâ€™s request for a temporary injunction and\r\n  directed South Fenwick to allow Wise access over Tract 19 until their dispute\r\n  was resolved.Â  Subsequently, the court\r\n  amended the injunction to state its findings of fact and conclusions of law\r\n  related only to the grant of a temporary injunction and were not binding on the\r\ncourtâ€™s subsequent consideration of the issues between the parties.Â  \r\n[5] On appeal, Wise contends the referee erred in holding\r\n  he was bound by admissions made in his pleading from another case.Â  The referee\r\n  specifically stated he did not apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel.Â  We\r\n  find the referee properly admitted the excerpt, offered without objection, as\r\n  an admission by a party opponent, pursuant to Rule 801(d)(2)(A), South Carolina\r\n  Rules of Evidence.Â  See Young v.

Thayer Rivers, Jr., of Ridgeland, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDrew A. Laughlin, of Hilton Head, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Clifford\r\n  Danny Taylor appeals from an award granting Mathesoya Management Corporation\r\n  (Mathesoya) damages for breach of a commercial lease.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nTaylor owned a\r\n  retail clothing business in Lake City, South Carolina.Â  To facilitate\r\n  relocation of the business to the Hilton Head area, Taylor entered into an\r\nagreement with Mathesoya to lease commercial space in Bluffton, South Carolina.\r\nThe lease agreement covered Unit 11 and Unit 12 of the\r\n  Village at Sheridan Park in Bluffton, South Carolina for a term of sixty\r\n  months, commencing on June 1, 2001.Â  Under the agreement, Taylor agreed to pay\r\n  rent for the use of the two units in monthly installments. Â Additionally, the\r\nlease agreement provided: \r\n\r\n\tAll alterations, additions, improvements and fixtures,\r\n  other than trade fixtures, which may be made or installed by either of the\r\n  parties hereto upon the Demised Premises, and which in any manner are attached\r\n  to the floors, walls or ceilings, shall be the property of Landlord and at the\r\n  termination of this Lease Agreement shall remain upon and be surrendered with\r\nthe Demised Premises as part thereof, without disturbance or removal.Â  Â \r\n\r\nTaylor commenced\r\n  business in June of 2001; however, by\r\n  December of that year, business had slowed down considerably. Â After Taylor failed to pay the December rent, Mathesoya instituted eviction proceedings on\r\n  January 13, 2002, and the court scheduled a hearing on the matter for January\r\n  15.Â  Prior to the hearing, Taylor delivered a check to Mathesoya for the\r\n  remaining balance; however, the check was dishonored when Lance Brutschy,\r\n  President of Mathesoya, presented it to the bank.\r\nTaylor failed to\r\n  make an appearance at the January 15 hearing, and the Magistrate Court for Beaufort County granted the eviction.Â  On January 18, Brutschy received a call from Taylorâ€™s attorney, who asked if Mathesoya would allow Taylor to stay if the money was\r\n  presented that day in cash.Â  Brutschy agreed to allow Taylor to stay on these\r\n  conditions; however, the money was never presented to Brutschy.Â  On January 23,\r\n  Taylor filed an affidavit with the court stating he had cured all defaults in\r\n  payment of the rent and did not owe any money at that time.Â  Upon receipt of\r\n  this affidavit, the court stayed the ejectment and scheduled another hearing\r\n  for February 25 of that year.Â  Prior to the hearing, Taylor vacated the\r\n  premises, removing his inventory and the air conditioning units he had\r\n  personally purchased.\r\nAfter Taylor left, Mathesoya eventually was able to rent the premises to new tenants; however,\r\n  their rent was lower than what Taylor had been paying under his lease.Â  Mathesoya\r\n  brought a claim against Taylor for damages resulting from the breach of the\r\n  lease agreement, including unpaid rent, lost rent, and costs.Â  Taylor answered, alleging: (1) the equitable defense of unclean hands; (2) Mathesoya failed\r\n  to state a claim upon which relief could be granted; and (3) Mathesoya failed\r\n  to mitigate his damages.Â  Additionally, Taylor counterclaimed for breach of\r\n  contract.Â  Mathesoya prevailed at trial and this appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn\r\n  action for breach of contract\r\n  seeking money damages is an action\r\n  at law.â€Â  R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l\r\n    Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 430, 540 S.E.2d 113, 117 (Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\n  Furthermore, the interposition of an equitable defense in an action at law does\r\n  not alter the nature of the action. Â Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 19,\r\n  640 S.E.2d 486, 496&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (internal citation omitted) (â€œ[A]\r\n  distinction should be made between cases in which the defendantâ€™s answer\r\n  asserts merely an equitable defense, and cases in which the answer seeks\r\n  affirmative equitable relief.Â  In the case of an equitable defense, the nature\r\n  of the action remains the same.â€); but see Brown v. Chandler, 50 S.C. 385, 391, 27 S.E. 868, 871 (1897) (holding an equitable defense in a\r\n  legal action receives equity review).\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing a judgment made in a law case tried by a master without a jury, the\r\n  appellate court will not disturb the masterâ€™s findings of fact unless the\r\n  findings are found to be without evidence reasonably supporting them.Â  Townes\r\n    Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976); Karl Sitte Plumbing Co. v. Darby Dev. Co. of Columbia, Inc., 295 S.C.\r\n  70, 76-7, 367 S.E.2d 162, 166 (Ct. App. 1988). However, â€œ[a] reviewing court is\r\n  free to decide questions of law with no particular deference to the trial\r\n  court.â€ Hunt v. S.C. Forestry Commâ€™n, 358 S.C. 564, 569, 595 S.E.2d 846,\r\n  848-49 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Excessive Damages\r\nTaylor argues\r\n  the master erred by granting monetary relief in excess of the amount prayed for\r\n  in the complaint.Â  Specifically, Taylor argues Mathesoya only prayed for\r\n  damages for lost rent in the amount of $92,682.27; therefore, the master erred\r\n  in awarding $100,718 for these damages.Â  This issue is not preserved for our\r\nreview.Â  \r\nâ€œIt\r\n  is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but\r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d\r\n  731, 733&nbsp;(1998).Â  A party may not argue one set of grounds below and\r\n  alternate grounds on appeal.Â  State\r\n    v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694&nbsp;(2003).Â \r\n  Furthermore, a general, non-specific argument does not necessarily encompass\r\n  the multitude of specific grounds which may support such a broad argument;\r\n  rather a party must actually raise the specific grounds below in order to\r\n  preserve the issue for review.Â  See Collins Entmâ€™t Corp. v. Coats\r\n    &amp; Coats Rental Amusement,&nbsp;368 S.C. 410, 418, 629 S.E.2d 635,\r\n  639&nbsp;(2006) (â€œInitially, although American argued there was insufficient\r\n  evidence of excess capacity [of machines] below, it made no argument with\r\n  respect to the specific types of machines at issue.\r\n  Accordingly, as this specific argument was not raised\r\n  below, it is not preserved.â€); State\r\n    v. Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 257, 609 S.E.2d 572, 591&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (internal\r\n  citation omitted) (â€œIt is well settled that an objection must be on a specific\r\n  ground.Â  To be preserved for appellate review, an objection should be sufficiently specific to bring into\r\n  focus the precise nature of the alleged error.â€);Â  Wilder Corp. at 76,\r\n  497 S.E.2d at 733 (â€œ[A]n objection must be sufficiently specific to inform the\r\n  trial court of the point being urged by the objector.â€).Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  Taylor challenged the excessiveness of the award below both on alternative\r\n  grounds and in a general manner, Taylor failed to specifically argue the masterâ€™s\r\n  award could not exceed the amount prayed for in the complaint.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  this specific argument is not preserved for our review.\r\nII.&nbsp; Unpaid Rent\r\nTaylor argues\r\n  the master erred in granting Mathesoya eight months of unpaid rent because\r\n  Mathesoyaâ€™s efforts to re-lease the premises were insufficient to mitigate its\r\ndamages.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA party injured by the acts of another is\r\n  required to do those things a person of ordinary prudence would do under the\r\n  circumstances, but the law does not require him to exert himself unreasonably\r\n  or incur substantial expense to avoid damages.â€Â  Baril\r\n    v. Aiken Regâ€™l Med. Ctrs., 352 S.C. 271, 285, 573 S.E.2d 830, 838&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2002).Â  â€œMoreover, the party who claims damages should have been minimized\r\n  has the burden of proving they could reasonably have been avoided or reduced.â€Â  Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 262, 599 S.E.2d 467, 478&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).Â  To meet the burden of proof, a tenant must present affirmative evidence\r\n  showing how a landlordâ€™s damages could reasonably have been avoided, or how the\r\n  landlordâ€™s efforts were unreasonable under the circumstances.Â  See Genovese\r\n    v. Bergeron, 327 S.C. 567, 573, 490 S.E.2d 608, 611&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997)\r\n  (â€œThe tenant failed to present any evidence showing what types of advertising\r\n  would have been reasonable, how much sooner the landlords could have rented or\r\n  sold the property through other methods, or that the landlordsâ€™ actions to rent\r\n  the property were inadequate or improper. We conclude, therefore, the tenant\r\n  failed to sustain her burden of proving the landlords could have reasonably\r\n  avoided or reduced their damages.â€).\r\nHere, Taylor failed to present any\r\n  affirmative evidence of steps Mathesoya should have taken or that Mathesoyaâ€™s\r\n  efforts were unreasonable under the circumstances.Â  As a result, Taylor failed to meet his burden of proof as a matter of law. Â Additionally, there is\r\n  sufficient evidence in the record to support a conclusion that Mathesoya\r\n  effectively mitigated his damages.Â  Brutschy testified he took multiple steps\r\n  to re-lease the premises, including cleaning the premises, replacing the air\r\n  conditioning units, advertising, replacing carpet, repairing a damaged wall,\r\n  and repainting.Â  Accordingly, the masterâ€™s award of damages for the unpaid rent\r\n  is affirmed.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Mathesoyaâ€™s Installation of\r\n  Carpet in Unit 11 \r\nTaylor argues\r\n  the master erred in granting Mathesoya damages for replacing the carpet in\r\n  areas of Unit 11 because there was no carpet in these areas before he took\r\n  possession of the premises, and the lease agreement did not require\r\ninstallation of carpet.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nUpon breach of a lease agreement, a landlord may seek\r\n  damages for unpaid rent and â€œsuch special damages as [the landlord] may plead\r\n  and prove to have resulted from the breach.â€Â  Simon v. Kirkpatrick, 141\r\nS.C. 251, 259, 139 S.E. 614, 617&nbsp;(1927) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nThe lease agreement gave Mathesoya ownership of any\r\n  improvements to the premises, including the installation of carpet.Â  Regardless,\r\n  Taylor argues Mathesoya is only entitled to damages for the replacement of the\r\n  carpet which Taylor actually installed and subsequently damaged because the\r\n  lease did not require the entire unit to be carpeted.Â  This argument is\r\n  misplaced because it narrowly focuses on the costs of replacing the carpet as\r\n  damages to Mathesoyaâ€™s property.Â  Brutschy testified the carpet in Unit 11 was\r\n  damaged and had to be replaced to re-let the premises.Â  He also testified areas\r\n  of Unit 11 were uncarpeted due to a display case Taylor had placed in the\r\n  premises.Â  The master specifically found Mathesoya replaced the carpet in Unit\r\n  11 in his efforts to re-let the premises.Â  Taylor failed to address whether the\r\n  cost of the new carpet was an expense incurred in mitigating the damages\r\n  resulting from the breach of the lease agreement.Â  He also failed to provide\r\n  evidence showing Mathesoyaâ€™s efforts to re-let the premises were unreasonable\r\n  or installation of the carpet was an unnecessary expense.Â  Accordingly, there\r\n  is evidence to support the masterâ€™s conclusion Mathesoya was entitled to\r\n  damages for the costs of installing the carpet as an expense incurred in\r\nmitigation of his damages.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Estoppel\r\nTaylor argues\r\n  he was entitled to rely on assertions that Mathesoya had a replacement tenant; therefore,\r\n  Mathesoya should be estopped from recovering damages.Â  This issue is not\r\npreserved for our review.Â  \r\nâ€œ[E]stoppel\r\n  must be affirmatively pled as a defense and cannot be bootstrapped onto another\r\n  claim.â€Â  Collins Entmâ€™t, Inc. v. White, 363 S.C. 546, 562, 611 S.E.2d\r\n  262, 270&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  Taylor failed to plead estoppel as an\r\n  affirmative defense.Â  While Taylorâ€™s answer broadly asserted Mathesoya acted\r\n  â€œinequitably and unfairly,â€ we decline to hold such a general assertion\r\n  includes estoppel, a defense which requires a party establish multiple\r\n  elements.[1]Â \r\n  Likewise, Taylorâ€™s assertion that Mathesoya acted â€œwith unclean handsâ€ is a\r\n  separate defense to which estoppel cannot be â€œbootstrapped.â€Â  As a result, Taylor failed to specifically assert the defense, either by name or through its elements,\r\n  and therefore Taylor failed to raise this issue before the master.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  even if we assumed, arguendo, Taylor had effectively pled estoppel, the master\r\n  did not rule on the issue in his order, nor did Taylor address it in his 59(e)\r\n  motion to reconsider.Â  Where a trial court does not explicitly rule on an\r\n  argument raised, and the appellant makes no Rule 59(e) motion to obtain a\r\n  ruling, the appellate court may not address the issue.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 460, 535 S.E.2d 438, 444-45&nbsp;(2000).Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nV.&nbsp; Abandonment\r\nTaylor argues the\r\n  master erred in finding he abandoned the premises because in actuality he was\r\n  evicted, which is distinguishable from abandonment; therefore, the master\r\n  inappropriately emphasized abandonment as the justification for awarding damages\r\nto Mathesoya.Â  We find no reversible error.Â  \r\nâ€œAn\r\n  error not shown to be prejudicial does not constitute grounds for reversal.â€ Â Brown\r\n    v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 417, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Ct. App. 1997). Â â€œAn\r\n  error is not reversible unless it is material and prejudicial to the\r\n  substantial rights of the appellant.â€ Â Visual Graphics Leasing Corp. v.\r\n    Lucia, 311 S.C. 484, 489, 429 S.E.2d 839, 841 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nWhile Taylor is correct in his assertion that eviction\r\n  is legally distinguishable from abandonment, the distinction does not have any\r\n  bearing on this case because Mathesoyaâ€™s action is for damages resulting from\r\n  the breach of a lease agreement.Â  Whether the master described the situation as\r\n  abandonment of the premises, abandonment of the lease agreement through\r\n  non-payment of rent, or eviction, Taylor breached the agreement when he failed\r\n  to pay the rent required by the lease, and as a result, Mathesoya incurred\r\n  damages.Â  Therefore, Taylor fails to illustrate how this distinction caused him\r\n  prejudice because any error on the part of the master in describing the\r\n  situation as abandonment of the premises was immaterial to the outcome of the\r\ncase.Â  Therefore, there is no reversible error.Â  \r\nVI.&nbsp; Removal of the Air Conditioning Units \r\nTaylor argues\r\n  the master erred in granting damages for the replacement of the air\r\n  conditioning units. Â Specifically, Taylor argues he went to great lengths to\r\n  ensure the units would not become fixtures subject to the lease provision\r\n  granting Mathesoya ownership of all fixtures installed on the premises; therefore,\r\nthe master erred in awarding damages for replacement units.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nA\r\n  trial judge has considerable discretion regarding the amount of damages, both\r\n  actual or punitive; thus, our review on appeal is limited to the correction of\r\n  errors of law.Â  Mellen v. Lane, 377 S.C. 261, 275-6, 659 S.E.2d 236, 244\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008). Â â€œOur task in reviewing a damages award is not to weigh the\r\n  evidence, but to determine if there is any evidence to support the damages\r\n  award.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  lease agreement provides the air conditioning units at issue would become the\r\n  property of Mathesoya if they were â€œin any manner attached to the floor, walls\r\n  or ceilings.â€Â  The master found â€œTaylor removed air conditioning equipment\r\n  consisting of two exterior condensers, an interior air handler, and the\r\n  thermostat that had been installed by Taylor as a part of his improvements to the\r\n  leased premisesâ€ and awarded Mathesoya the costs of replacement air\r\n  conditioning equipment.Â  Taylor contends this conclusion was in error, pointing\r\n  to his testimony that the air conditioning units were not attached to\r\n  Mathesoyaâ€™s building, and he purposefully installed the units so they would not\r\n  become Mathesoyaâ€™s property.Â  Additionally, Taylor emphasizes the testimony on\r\n  the subject was not challenged during cross-examination.\r\nÂ Mathesoyaâ€™s\r\n  apparent failure to challenge Taylorâ€™s statements on cross-examination does not\r\n  amount to a wholesale admission to such statements, nor does it mean the finder\r\n  of fact was obligated to accept them as true.Â  Additionally, while Taylorâ€™s testimony supports his argument the air conditioning units were not attached to the\r\n  building, there is evidence in the record that supports the conclusion they\r\n  were attached and subject to the provision of the lease agreement.Â  Brutschy\r\n  testified elements of the air conditioning system had been suspended from the\r\n  ceiling, and Taylorâ€™s removal of the system caused damage to the premises.Â \r\n  Mathesoya provided photographs of the areas where the air conditioning had\r\n  existed, depicting the physical damage caused by the removal of the units.Â \r\n  Taylor himself testified about the permanent fixtures he used to suspend the components\r\n  of the air conditioning system. Â Accordingly, there is sufficient\r\n  evidence to support a conclusion the air conditioning units were attached to the\r\n  premises, and therefore we affirm the masterâ€™s award of damages for replacement\r\n  units.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the master is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\nSHORT, and THOMAS JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Strickland v.

Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  Wrights argue the Committee erred in affirming the Departmentâ€™s decision to\r\n  remove their foster child from their home because substantial evidence did not\r\n  support the Departmentâ€™s decision.Â  We find we lack jurisdiction to hear this\r\n  matter.Â  Consequently, we dismiss.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nÂ â€œA\r\n  foster parent has the right to appeal . . . the removal of a foster child from\r\n  the foster home.â€Â  27 S.C.

Lawrence, all\r\n  of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Subsequent\r\n  to a supplemental proceeding, Delbert Tangeman (Tangeman) appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s\r\n  order setting aside the transfer of real property from Tangeman to his wife as\r\n  a fraudulent transfer.Â  We reverse and remand.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nBarry and Alice Mallek (the Malleks) received\r\n  a general verdict against Tangeman following a jury trial in June 2002, which\r\n  was affirmed by this court on January 14, 2005.Â  The Malleks sought to execute\r\n  on the judgment against Tangeman; however, the execution was returned nulla\r\n  bona on or about June 13, 2005.Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  the Malleks sought an order of reference and rule to show cause for supplemental\r\n  proceedings.Â  A supplemental proceeding was held before the master-in-equity on\r\n  August 1, 2005.Â  During the hearing, Tangeman indicated that his business\r\n  assets, as well as numerous pieces of real estate, had been transferred to his\r\n  wife.Â  Tangeman did not have the documents regarding the transfers at the time\r\n  of the hearing; thus, the hearing was adjourned and Tangeman was ordered to produce\r\n  the relevant documents at a later date.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  hearing was reconvened on January 17, 2006.Â  At the hearing, Tangeman returned\r\n  to the stand and answered questions regarding the documents.Â  The documents\r\n  included mortgage notes dated August 1, 1998, in the amounts of $20,000,\r\n  $30,000, and $150,000.[2]Â \r\n  The mortgages securing these notes, although dated August 1, 1998, were\r\n  notarized and recorded on April 26, 2000.Â  This date correlates to a document\r\n  presented by Tangeman wherein he had transferred all of his assets, including\r\n  all of his real estate, household furniture, construction business vehicles,\r\n  equipment, and tools to his wife on April 25, 2000.Â  Tangeman testified that\r\n  valid consideration for the transfers was given by his wife who, in addition to\r\n  her personal service as secretary without compensation, had invested sums of\r\n  money from her inheritance and otherwise into his business over the years. Â He\r\n  also stated that a written agreement reflecting any obligation for repayment\r\n  from either himself or from his business was not executed.Â  \r\nAt the\r\n  close of the hearing, the Malleks asked the master-in-equity to set aside the\r\n  transfers as fraudulent conveyances under the Statute of Elizabeth.Â  At this\r\n  time, Tangeman requested an opportunity to enter into evidence documents which he\r\n  alleged would prove the transfers were not fraudulent.Â  The master-in-equity\r\n  refused and the following colloquy ensued:\r\n\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â  Your Honor?\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â  Donâ€™t I get an opportunity to - - -\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  Your opportunity was a long time ago.Â  You are here at the direction and the request to appear by [c]ounsel in an\r\n  attempt to locate funds to pay his clientâ€™s judgment.Â  The issues relating to\r\n  any other matters were tried in a caseÂ  - - -\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â  They were - - -\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  In 2001 and those are not here.Â  Today, the only reason\r\n  I am here, or the only reason we are here and I am hearing this, is to assist Mr. Coggins in having\r\n  his client recover the money that was found to be due from you to\r\n  the Malleks.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â \r\n  Your Honor, there are two very important documents that Mr. Coggins is not present\r\n  here today.\r\n\tTHE\r\n  COURT:Â  Well, again - - - Excuse me, sir.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â \r\n  And they have been presented in the past.\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  Excuse me.Â  Mr. Coggins is handling his case for his\r\n  client.Â  Now whether in his presentation he decided not to include documents,\r\n  that is solely up to him.Â  But you are not handling his case and the sole\r\n  purpose you are here today is to try to find funds to pay his clientâ€™s\r\n  judgment.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â \r\n  There are two - - -\r\n\tTHE\r\n  COURT:Â  I understand.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â \r\n  There are two - - -\r\n\tTHE\r\n  COURT:Â  You didnâ€™t - - - You didnâ€™t hear me.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â \r\n  Yes, I did.\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  Alright.Â  And so that is the - - - That is the end of\r\n  the conversation.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â \r\n  So I cannot make a motion?\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  No, you cannot.Â  If you want to have an attorney file\r\n  some type of motion on your behalf, then you are welcome to do that.Â  Once the [o]rder\r\n  has been signed, then if there is grounds for filing a motion or any type of\r\n  responsive pleading, then the attorney would have to review the [o]rder that I\r\n  have signed and at that point the [o]rder is subject to whatever attack that\r\n  can be done.Â  But until then - - -\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â  There have been two - - - May I share the two documents\r\n  that are in evidence and that are not - - -\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  They are not.Â  The only evidence are here and I have\r\n  reviewed these documents as they were handed up.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â  Okay.\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  Thereâ€™s eleven documents that were presented by Mr.\r\n  Coggins during your testimony.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â  There is one side of that page that you have not\r\n  considered, Your Honor.\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  I have looked at every document.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â  No, sir.Â  You have not.Â  It is on the back side of that\r\n  one mortgage.\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  I have - Sir, I have looked at every document as it\r\n  was handed up and Iâ€™ve looked at the dates.Â  Iâ€™ve looked at all the recording\r\n  information and everything that is on the documents.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â  There is a [o]ne hundred fifty thousand ($150,000) [d]ollar\r\n  mortgage that preceded all of these dates and it is in evidence.\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  I understand that.Â  I understand that.\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â  And it will clearly take care of any fraudulent\r\n  claims.Â  It is clearly - - -\r\n\tTHE COURT:Â  Well, sir, I am not meaning to cut you short, but I\r\n  am.Â  If, after the [o]rder is entered, you have an attorney who wants to file\r\n  some type of motion relating to the [o]rder, then that is the time to do it.Â \r\n  Alright, sir?\r\n\tTANGEMAN:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nShortly after\r\n  this exchange, the hearing concluded.Â  In the final order, the master-in-equity\r\n  set aside the transfer of Tangemanâ€™s property to his wife as a fraudulent\r\n  conveyance and appointed a receiver over all of his business and real estate\r\n  properties until the Malleksâ€™ judgment was paid in full.Â  \r\nTangeman\r\n  filed a motion to reconsider claiming he was not provided an opportunity to\r\n  prove the transfers were valid and requested the master-in-equity consider\r\n  certain documents he was not allowed to present at the hearing.Â  The master-in-equity\r\n  denied Tangemanâ€™s motion. Â This appeal follows. Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSupplementary proceedings\r\n  are equitable in nature.Â  Ag-Chem Equip. Co., Inc. v. Daggerhart, 281\r\n  S.C. 380, 383, 315 S.E.2d 379, 381 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  In an equitable matter\r\n  referred to a master-in-equity for final judgment, we may find facts in\r\n  accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Van\r\n    Blarcum v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 337 S.C. 446, 450, 523 S.E.2d 486,\r\n  488 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, this court is not required to disregard the\r\n  findings of the master-in-equity.Â  Friarsgate, Inc. v. First Fed. Sav. &amp;\r\n    Loan Assâ€™n, 317 S.C. 452, 456, 454 S.E.2d 901, 904 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\nThe admissibility\r\n  of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be\r\n  reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error\r\n  resulting in prejudice to the defendant. Â Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1,\r\n  33, 640 S.E.2d 486, 504 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when\r\n  the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without\r\n  evidentiary support.â€Â  Menne v. Keowee Key Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n, Inc.,\r\n  368 S.C. 557, 568, 629 S.E.2d 690, 696 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  â€œTo warrant reversal\r\n  based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both\r\n  the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice.â€Â  Fields v. Regâ€™l Med.\r\n    Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTangeman argues the\r\n  denial by the master-in-equity of his request to present evidence of a valid\r\n  conveyance was error.Â  We agree. \r\nThe\r\n  Statute of Elizabeth, as codified in section 27-23-10 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2007), provides in relevant part: \r\n\r\n\tEvery .\r\n  . . conveyance of lands . . . which may be had or made to or for any intent or purpose\r\n  to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors and others of their just and lawful . .\r\n  . debts . . . must be deemed and taken . . . to be clearly and utterly void,\r\n  frustrate and of no effect, any pretense, color, feigned consideration,\r\n  expressing of use, or any other matter or thing to the contrary\r\n  notwithstanding. \r\n\r\nPursuant to this\r\n  statute, conveyances may be set aside under two conditions: (1) where the\r\n  transfer is made by the grantor with the actual intent of defrauding his\r\n  creditors where that intent is imputable to the grantee, even though there is\r\n  valuable consideration; and (2) where a transfer is made without actual intent\r\n  to defraud the grantorâ€™s creditors, but without valuable consideration.Â  See Albertson v. Robinson, 371 S.C. 311, 316, 638 S.E.2d 81, 83 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006). Â Where a conveyance is made without an actual intent to defraud but\r\n  without consideration, the conveyance will stand if the grantor reserves a\r\n  sufficient amount of property not merely at the time of the transfer, but an\r\n  amount from which in the final analysis the creditors are able to collect their\r\n  indebtedness in full.Â  Gardner v. Kirven, 184 S.C. 37, 41, 191\r\n  S.E. 814, 816 (1937).Â  Moreover, â€œ[w]here transfers to members of the family\r\n  are attacked either upon the ground of actual fraud or on account of their\r\n  voluntary character, the law imposes the burden on the transferee to\r\n  establish both a valuable consideration and the bona fides of the transaction by\r\n  clear and convincing testimony.â€ Â Id. (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the alleged fraudulent conveyance was between family members; thus, the\r\n  burden to establish valuable consideration and the bona fides of the transaction\r\n  was imposed upon the transferee.Â  See Id.Â  Â However, the\r\n  transferee, Tangemanâ€™s wife, was not a party to the proceeding at issue.[3] Moreover, not only was the transferee not a party to the proceeding, but Tangeman\r\n  himself was also denied the opportunity to introduce documentary evidence and\r\n  to present an argument as to the validity of the transfer. Â Review of the\r\n  record indicates the master-in-equity stated that the Malleks had exclusive\r\n  control over the presentation of the case and Tangemanâ€™s involvement was\r\n  limited solely to responding to their questions on direct examination.Â  The\r\n  record further reveals that Tangeman sought to present testimony in response to\r\n  the Malleksâ€™ presentation on direct examination and was repeatedly denied the\r\n  opportunity.Â  The master-in-equity erred by precluding Tangeman the opportunity\r\n  to present his position as to the validity of the transfer.Â  Moreover, we\r\n  further express concern that the master-in-equity clearly stated that Tangeman\r\n  may only respond by having an attorney file some motion after the issuance of\r\n  the courtâ€™s order.[4]Â \r\n  We find Tangemanâ€™s inability to present his position prejudiced him.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  we conclude a remand is appropriate to allow for a hearing in which Tangeman is\r\n  provided an opportunity to address the validity of the transfer.[5]Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to address Tangemanâ€™s remaining issues and\r\n  arguments.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C.\r\n  406, 423, 526 S.E.2d 716, 725 (2005) (holding that the court need not address\r\n  additional issues if it is not necessary to the resolution of the case). Â \r\nBased\r\n  on our reasoning herein, the decision of the master-in-equity is Â \r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED. \r\nWILLIAMS,\r\nTHOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Tangeman also produced his 2001 and 2002 Federal\r\n  income tax returns, which list â€œDelbert Tangemanâ€ as the sole proprietor of his\r\n  building contracting business.Â  The returns also indicated income received from\r\nrental property in the names of both Tangeman and his wife.Â  \r\n[3] We recognize the issue as to the transferee not being\r\n  named as a party was not raised; therefore, we focus only on the decision to\r\npreclude Tangeman from addressing the validity of the transfer.\r\n[4] As to the Malleksâ€™ argument that Tangeman failed to\r\n  proffer the documents into the record, the record clearly shows the futility of\r\n  further attempts to preserve Tangemanâ€™s desire to introduce these documents in\r\n  light of the comments of the master-in-equity.Â  See Staubes v. City\r\n    of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 415, 529 S.E.2d 543, 547 (2000) (noting that\r\n  this court does not require parties to engage in futile actions in order to\r\n  preserve issues for appellate review).Â  Moreover, since the master-in-equity\r\n  specifically indicated that Tangeman could only further address the court by\r\n  way of post trial motion, we find Tangeman has preserved his arguments because\r\n  he complied with the courtâ€™s specific instructions by way of a motion to\r\n  reconsider.Â  Thus, in light of the courtâ€™s specific directions, we decline to\r\nfind Tangemanâ€™s arguments unpreserved.Â Â  \r\n[5] On remand, consideration should be given as to\r\n  whether the case should be postured as a declaratory judgment or other\r\n  independent action and whether Tangemanâ€™s wife, as transferee, should be added\r\nas a party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-318","title":"Oâ€™Reilly v.

Ruff, both of Beaufort, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this action involving the probate of a will, Carl C. Hendricks (Carl) challenges\r\n  the validity of his motherâ€™s will and seeks to set aside the probate of the will.Â \r\n  On appeal from the decision of the circuit court affirming the probate court, Carl\r\n  argues the probate court erred in excluding testimony from an expert witness.Â \r\n  He also argues the probate court erred in excluding the proffer of an\r\n  incapacitated fact witness and in denying his motion to extend the record.Â  He further\r\n  contends the probate court erred in denying his motion to exhume his motherâ€™s\r\n  body.Â  We affirm.[1]Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 23,\r\n  2002, Carlâ€™s mother, India B. Hendricks (Decedent), passed away in Beaufort County.Â  Decedent was survived by her three adult children: Carl C. Hendricks,\r\n  Jr., William P. Hendricks, and Carol H. Waters.Â  On March 24, 1997, Decedent\r\n  executed her last will and testament wherein she appointed Carol and William as\r\n  joint personal representatives of her Estate.Â  Further, Decedent left $150,000\r\n  to Carl, and instructed that the remainder of the Estate, which Decedent\r\n  estimated was worth approximately $3 million at the time she executed her will,\r\n  be split equally between William and Carol.\r\nAfter Decedentâ€™s\r\n  death, William and Carol (collectively the Estate), petitioned the probate\r\n  court to be appointed as the personal representatives of the Estate and\r\n  requested an informal probate of their motherâ€™s will.Â  Thereafter, on December\r\n  19, 2002, Carl petitioned the probate court, challenging the validity of the\r\n  will and seeking to set aside the informal probate of the will.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Carl believed Decedent suffered from Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other\r\n  incapacitating mental diseases for a number of years prior to her execution of\r\n  the will.Â  Carl alleged the will was invalid because Decedent lacked the requisite\r\n  mental capacity when she executed the will.\r\nAfter extended\r\n  discovery, the parties entered into a scheduling order, which the probate court\r\n  extended several times.Â  Shortly before trial, Carl wrote the Estate and\r\n  disclosed a new expert, Dr. T. Ray Sherbert (Dr. Sherbert), and provided a copy\r\n  of the expertâ€™s affidavit.Â  In response, the Estate filed a motion in limine to\r\n  preclude Dr. Sherbert from testifying as an expert witness, arguing the\r\n  disclosure occurred twelve days prior to trial and more than two months past\r\n  the extended deadline for expert witness disclosure.Â  The probate court granted\r\n  the Estateâ€™s motion in limine.Â  \r\nAt trial,\r\n  Carl examined eleven witnesses, including a previously disclosed expert\r\n  witness, Dr. Edward McNeil.Â  At the conclusion of Carlâ€™s case, the probate\r\n  court granted the Estateâ€™s motion for a directed verdict as to Carlâ€™s claim for\r\n  undue influence.Â  After the Estate rested, Carl moved to extend the record of\r\n  trial to include the deposition of Eugene Robinson, a proposed witness who was\r\n  hospitalized during the trial and unable to appear on Carlâ€™s behalf.Â  After\r\n  receiving a proffer of Robinsonâ€™s proposed testimony, the probate court denied\r\n  Carlâ€™s motion to extend the record.Â  \r\nThe probate court found Decedent had the requisite mental capacity\r\n  to execute a valid will and denied Carlâ€™s motions to extend the record to allow\r\n  testimony from Eugene Robinson and to exhume Decedentâ€™s body in order to\r\n  perform an autopsy. Â The circuit court affirmed the judgment of the probate\r\n  court.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  action to contest a will is an action at law.Â  In re Estate of Cumbee, 333\r\n  S.C. 664, 670, 511 S.E.2d 390, 393 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  If a proceeding in the probate\r\n  court is in the nature of an action at law, review by the circuit court and appellate\r\n  court extends merely to the correction of errors of law.Â  Bob Jones Univ. v. Strandell, 344 S.C. 224, 230, 543 S.E.2d 251, 253 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the circuit court and appellate court may not disturb the probate courtâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact unless they are not supported by the evidence.Â  Cumbee,\r\n  333 S.C. at 670, 511 S.E.2d at 393.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nCarl argues the\r\n  probate courtâ€™s exclusion of Dr. Sherbert as an expert witness was in error.Â  Carl\r\n  further contends the exclusion of Dr. Sherbertâ€™s testimony resulted in\r\n  prejudice.Â  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nPursuant to Rule\r\n  33(b) SCRCP, there is a continuing duty on the part of the party from whom\r\n  information is sought to answer a standard interrogatory, such as the one\r\n  requesting the party to list any expert witnesses whom the party proposes to\r\n  use as a witness at the trial of the case.Â  Bensch v. Davidson, 354 S.C.\r\n  173, 182, 580 S.E.2d 128, 132 (2003).Â  This requirement of disclosure of\r\n  information before trial is established to avoid surprise and to promote\r\n  decisions on the merits after a full and fair hearing.Â  Id. at 182, 580\r\n  S.E.2d at 132-33.Â  When a violation of Rule 33 occurs, the trial court has\r\n  discretion to impose a sanction upon the violating party, such as the exclusion\r\n  of a witness, if warranted.Â  Id.Â  Â In Jumper v. Hawkins, 348 S.C.\r\n  142, 558 S.E.2d 911 (Ct. App. 2001), this court addressed the authority of a\r\n  trial court to exclude the testimony of an expert.Â  The court in Jumper held the trial court is required to consider and evaluate the following factors\r\n  before imposing the sanction of exclusion of a witness:Â  \r\n\r\n\t(1) the\r\n  type of witness involved; (2) the content of the evidence emanating from the\r\n  proffered witness; (3) the nature of the failure or neglect or refusal to\r\n  furnish the witnessâ€™ name; (4) the degree of surprise to the other party,\r\n  including the prior knowledge of the name of the witness; and (5) the prejudice\r\n  to the opposing party. \r\n\r\nId. at 152, 558 S.E.2d at 916.Â  \r\nApplication of the factors established in Jumper are essential to a determination of abuse of discretion as â€œthe sanction of\r\n  exclusion of a witness should never be lightly invoked.â€Â  Barnette v. Adams\r\n    Bros. Logging, Inc., 355 S.C. 588, 592, 586 S.E.2d 572, 574 (2003).Â  In Barnette,\r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court noted the importance of satisfying the Jumper factors in finding the trial court abused its discretion in excluding expert witnesses\r\n  where there was no specific finding of the factor of prejudice to the opposing\r\n  counsel other than necessity of further discovery and there was no disobedience\r\n  of any order of the court.Â  Id. at 593, 586 S.E.2d at 575.Â  Similarly, in Arthur v. Sexton Dental Clinic, this court emphasized the importance of\r\n  the Jumper factors in affirming the trial courtâ€™s sanction where,\r\n  although not specifically enunciated, the trial court properly considered each\r\n  of the factors.Â  368 S.C. 326, 628 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The Arthur court held the trial court properly excluded the testimony of three expert\r\n  witnesses after making the appropriate inquiry and upon consideration of the\r\n  requisite factors following an in-depth instruction on the Jumper factors from counsel.Â  Id. at 341, 628 S.E.2d at 902. \r\nAs a\r\n  threshold matter, we note that Carl failed to name Dr. Sherbert as an expert\r\n  witness within the time limits established by the probate courtâ€™s amended\r\n  scheduling order.Â  Given Carlâ€™s failure to comply with the scheduling order,\r\n  the probate court had the discretionary authority to impose the appropriate\r\n  sanctions if warranted.Â  See Arthur, 368 S.C. at 338, 628 S.E.2d\r\n  at 901.Â  Thus, the question before this court is whether the probate court\r\n  abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Sherbert as an expert witness.Â  See id.; see also Jumper, 348 S.C. at 150, 558 S.E.2d at 915\r\n  (internal citation omitted) (stating â€œ[t]he decision of whether or not to allow\r\n  a witness to testify who was not previously listed on answers to\r\n  interrogatories rests within the sound discretion of the trial [court].â€). Â \r\nWe\r\n  believe the probate court properly considered the factors set forth in Jumper and find the probate court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Dr.\r\n  Sherbertâ€™s testimony. Â The probate court did not lightly invoke its sanction of\r\n  expert witness exclusion.Â  Rather, it imposed such a sanction after several\r\n  extensions to the scheduling order.Â  Additionally, the probate court discussed\r\n  each factor in depth in its order granting the Estateâ€™s motion in limine.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the first factor, the probate court noted Carl proposed to use Dr. Sherbert\r\n  as an expert witness at trial.Â  However, the probate court also outlined Carlâ€™s\r\n  trial history regarding use of experts such as Dr. Geoffrey R. McKee, a\r\n  forensic psychologist, who was â€œabsolutely necessary to [Carlâ€™s] caseâ€; the\r\n  court cited another occasion, where Appellant stated, aside from Dr. Edward\r\n  McNeil, Carl â€œdoes not now plan to use Dr. McKee as an expert witness.â€Â  Under\r\n  the second factor of Jumper, the probate court recognized Dr. Sherbertâ€™s\r\n  proffered testimony would demonstrate his opinion on Decedentâ€™s mental and\r\n  physical conditions.[2]Â \r\n  In weighing this factor, the probate court stated Dr. Sherbertâ€™s opinion â€œwould\r\n  be based on his review of medical records generated by others, and on his\r\n  consultations with [Carl].â€Â  \r\nAs to the third\r\n  factor, the probate court considered Carlâ€™s failure to furnish Dr. Sherbertâ€™s\r\n  name as a proposed expert witness by noting the prolonged schedule of the trial\r\n  and the prior extensions granted to Carl.Â  Carl first disclosed Dr. Sherbertâ€™s name on April 13, 2005, twelve days before trial\r\n  and over two months past the already extended deadline for expert witness\r\n  disclosure.Â  In addition, the probate court granted Carlâ€™s motion to extend the\r\n  scheduling order from December 30, 2004, until February 1, 2005.Â  Moreover,\r\n  Carl had previously indicated he did not plan on using any expert witnesses other\r\n  than Dr. McNeil.Â  Noting that the time\r\n  for disclosing experts had passed, the probate court stated that allowing Carl\r\n  to proffer Dr. Sherbertâ€™s testimony would place Respondents with â€œthe\r\n  unreasonable burden of choosing either to go to trial inadequately prepared, or\r\n  to request a postponement of a trial that has already been delayed twice over\r\n  their strenuous objections.â€Â  The probate court further described the late disclosure\r\n  as â€œlast minuteâ€ under the third factor in Jumper.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the fourth factor in Jumper, the probate court noted, â€œ[I]t appears that\r\n  the April 13 disclosure of the proposed use of Dr. Sherbert as a witness took [the\r\n  Estate] completely by surprise, thus compounding substantially the prejudice\r\n  factor addressed below.â€Â  Finally, the probate court noted Carlâ€™s late\r\n  furnishing of Dr. Sherbertâ€™s name as a witness prejudiced the Estate by further\r\n  delaying trial, providing inadequate time for trial preparation, and adding personal\r\n  distress from another protraction of litigation.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  the probate court properly considered the factors set forth in Jumper in\r\n  its decision to exclude Dr. Sherbert as an expert witness.Â  Additionally, we\r\n  find no error in the sanction based on Carlâ€™s conduct.Â  We further note that\r\n  Carl presented at trial an expert witness, Dr. McNeil, who testified at length.\r\n  Â Dr. McNeil who, unlike Dr. Sherbert, had a doctor-patient relationship with\r\n  the Decedent, testified that he had no concerns about Decedentâ€™s mental\r\n  capacity until an event of transient amnesia that lasted only a short duration\r\n  in December 1997 and a diagnosis of â€œprogressive dimentiaâ€ in January 1998.Â  Again,\r\n  this medical concern arose after the execution of the will. \r\nDr.\r\n  Sherbert proffered testimony suggesting the Decedent may have suffered from some\r\n  form of mental condition. Â However, Dr. Sherbert testified that he could not\r\n  make this finding without an autopsy.Â  While we note the relevance of this\r\n  testimony, we nonetheless conclude that the probate court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in light of the multiple continuances previously granted in this\r\n  case.Â  We further note that Dr. Sherbert himself indicated that an autopsy by a\r\n  forensic pathologist would be the most definitive means to confirm any\r\n  diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.Â  While Carl originally designated Dr. McKee,\r\n  a forensic psychologist, to testify, that expert was not able to\r\n  complete a report in time and Carl made the decision to proceed without a\r\n  forensic psychologist. Â Carl made a voluntary decision to proceed with\r\n  the testimony of Dr. McNeil only. Â Unless Dr. McKee qualifies, it is not clear\r\n  that a forensic pathologist was ever named.Â  Accordingly, we cannot say\r\n  the probate court abused its discretion; therefore, we affirm the circuit court\r\n  in upholding the ruling of the probate court on this issue.[3]\r\nNext, Carl argues the probate court erred in denying\r\n  his motion to extend the\r\n  record to include the deposition of\r\n  Eugene Robinson.Â  We find no error. \r\nThe\r\n  decision whether to reopen a record for additional evidence is within the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  that discretion.Â  Brenco v. South Carolina Dept. of Transp., 659 S.E.2d\r\n  167 (2008); Wright v. Strickland, 306 S.C. 187, 188, 410 S.E.2d 596, 597\r\n  (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Furthermore, the trial judge is endowed with considerable\r\n  latitude and discretion in allowing a party to reopen a case.Â  Spinx Oil\r\n    Co., Inc. v. Fed. Mut. Ins. Co., 310 S.C. 477, 482, 427 S.E.2d 649, 651\r\n  (1993), overruled on other grounds, Joe Harden Builders, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. and Sur. Co., 326 S.C. 231, 486 S.E.2d 89 (1997). Â \r\nThe\r\n  probate court denied Carlâ€™s request to hold open the trial record so Carl could\r\n  supplement the record with Robinsonâ€™s deposition.Â  In so holding, the probate\r\n  court noted Carl, a litigant in the matter, interviewed the witness himself.Â \r\n  The probate court described the proffer as â€œthe product of a private\r\n  conversation between [Carl] and the prospective witness and with the transcript\r\n  solely prepared by [Carl].â€Â  Additionally, the probate court was concerned with\r\n  the manner in which Robinsonâ€™s proffer was prepared and â€œthe obvious number of\r\n  holes in [Carlâ€™s] case, that [the proffer] conveniently attempts to plug.â€Â \r\n  Furthermore, the probate court stated another concern was that â€œthe ultimate\r\n  result of this is to taint this witnessâ€™ prospective testimony.â€Â  In\r\n  conclusion, the probate court held the prejudice that could result in such a\r\n  delay is not outweighed by any possible benefit of his testimony.Â  Based on\r\n  this decision, the probate court denied Carlâ€™s request to hold open the record\r\n  so it could possibly be supplemented with the deposition of Robinson.Â  We find\r\n  the probate court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to extend the trial\r\n  after weighing Robinsonâ€™s proffer with the possible prejudice to the Estate\r\n  pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in\r\n  affirming the decision of the probate court.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J.,\r\n  THOMAS, J., and PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The probate court referred to Carlâ€™s letter as well\r\n  as Dr. Sherbertâ€™s letter and affidavit in identifying the content of his\r\nproposed testimony.Â  \r\n[3] Carl also argues on appeal that the probate court\r\n  erred in denying his motion to exhume Decedentâ€™s body in order to determine\r\n  Decedentâ€™s mental capacity at the time she executed her will.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Carl argues an autopsy of Decedentâ€™s body would either confirm or discredit Dr.\r\n  Sherbertâ€™s opinion.Â  Our decision to affirm the circuit court in affirming the\r\n  probate courtâ€™s exclusion of Dr. Sherbert as an expert witness is dispositive\r\n  of Carlâ€™s third issue on appeal.Â  Therefore, we need not address it on the\r\n  merits.Â  Even if we were to address the issue, we find it is without merit.Â \r\n  The probate court determined Decedentâ€™s testamentary capacity was established\r\n  by sufficient evidence, and accordingly, the extraordinary measure of\r\n  exhumation and autopsy is unwarranted.Â  In re Percivalâ€™s Estate, 101\r\n  S.C. 198, 206, 85 S.E. 247, 248 (1915) (â€œ[E]xhumation ought not to be made\r\n  except upon the most serious consideration.â€).Â  Furthermore, at issue was\r\n  whether Decedent was of sound mind on March 24, 1997, the date she executed her\r\nwill, rather than the date of her death.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-321","title":"State v.

Grady Jordan, of Easley, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAmy V. Cofield, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Arthur G. Roberts (deceased), appeals the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s reversal of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissionâ€™s order\r\n  finding Roberts was an employee of Rochester Cab Company (Rochester).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRoberts\r\n  was shot and killed while driving a cab for Rochester Cab Company.Â  The single\r\n  commissioner found that Roberts was Rochesterâ€™s employee under the workersâ€™\r\n  compensation statute.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-130 (Supp. 2007).Â  The appellate\r\n  panel affirmed.Â  However, the circuit court reversed the appellate panel, finding\r\n  it did not properly follow the four tests required to impose liability on as\r\n  set forth in Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 564 S.E.2d 110\r\n  (2002). Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGenerally, a reviewing court will not overturn a decision by the\r\n  appellate panel unless the determination is unsupported by\r\n    substantial evidence or is affected by an error of law.Â  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 619, 611 S.E.2d\r\n  297, 299 (Ct. App. 2005). Â However, the narrow nature of the question on appeal\r\n  dictates a preponderance of the evidence standard.Â  â€œWorkersâ€™ compensation awards are\r\n  authorized only if an employer-employee relationship exists at the time of the\r\n  injury.Â  Whether or not an employer-employee relationship exists is a\r\n  jurisdictional question. Â Where the issue involves jurisdiction, this Court can\r\n  take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€ Â Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349 S.C. 589, 594, 564 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2002) (citations omitted).Â  However, â€œ[i]t is South Carolinaâ€™s policy\r\n  to resolve jurisdictional doubts in favor of the inclusion of employers and\r\n  employees under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe analytical framework used by both the appellate panel and the\r\n  circuit court involves the right of control and is set forth in the seminal\r\n  case of Nelson v. Yellow Cab Co., 349\r\n  S.C. at 594, 564 S.E.2d at 113. Â â€œThere are four elements which determine\r\n  the right of control: 1) direct evidence of the right or exercise of control;\r\n  2) furnishing of equipment; 3) right to fire; and 4) method of payment.â€Â  Id.Â  In Nelson, the court stated proof of any single element would be\r\n  indicative of an employment relationship while contrary evidence would only be\r\n  mild evidence of an independent contractor relationship.Â  Id. at 594-95,\r\n  564 S.E.2d at 113.\r\nHere, Rochester made many decisions which demonstrate its right or\r\n  exercise of control, including:Â  deciding which car to lease to which driver;\r\n  requiring drivers to keep the cars clean, to have the oil changed at the\r\n  companyâ€™s expense, to be courteous, kind, and refrain from the use of\r\n  profanity; and requiring drivers to have clean criminal records, to adhere to a\r\n  dress code, to maintain the company sign on top of the cab, to charge city\r\n  rates, and to keep their radio on if they wanted to keep their car.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Rochester prohibited drivers from drinking alcohol or using drugs on the job.Â  \r\nThere is also evidence Rochester furnished the needed equipment,\r\n  as it owned the cars which were leased to the drivers, paid for the car insurance,\r\n  installed two-way radios, and provided business cards to the drivers.Â  Drivers\r\n  paid for the lease of their car by providing Rochester with fifty percent of\r\n  the fees earned.Â  This is an important distinction from the situation in Nelson where the driver paid a set lease fee and kept all fares and tips for his\r\n  compensation.Â  Id. at 593, 599, 564 S.E.2d at 112, 115.Â  The arrangement\r\n  in this case weighs heavily in favor of Roberts and a finding that an employer/employee\r\n  relationship did exist.\r\nRochester also possessed the right to fire the drivers, as it would\r\n  take a car away if the driver had a criminal record, used drugs or alcohol on\r\n  the job, charged more than city rates, was not paying the full percentage of\r\n  the fares he earned, or otherwise violated the requirements and prohibitions\r\n  set forth above.Â  Moreover, Rochester specifically reserved the right to\r\n  terminate the relationship if a driver did not complete his work in the\r\n  expected manner.Â  Consequently, evidence of the third element in Nelson is present.\r\nFinally, with respect to the method of payment, Robertâ€™s earnings\r\n  consisted of fifty percent of his fares with the other fifty percent remitted\r\n  to Rochester.Â  We find this is distinguishable from Nelson, where the\r\n  driver kept all his fares and tips after paying a set amount to the cab company\r\n  for lease of the vehicle.Â  Rochester required that city rates be observed, but\r\n  the rate for fares outside the city could be determined by the driver.Â  In the\r\n  case of checks or insurance voucher slips, the driver submitted the check or\r\n  slip to Rochester as though it were cash, and Rochester was then responsible\r\n  for collecting its fifty percent of the dayâ€™s earnings by cashing the check or\r\n  seeking reimbursement from the insurance company.Â  Overall, the fact that\r\n  Roberts was only entitled to fifty percent of his fares supports the contention\r\n  he was an employee as opposed to an independent contractor.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSome factors weigh in favor of finding Roberts an independent contractor;\r\n  however, we find more evidence to support a finding he was an employee of Rochester.Â  Rochester controlled and disciplined the drivers, and it furnished their\r\n  equipment, not under a contractually set arrangement, but rather based on a\r\n  percentage of what the driver earned.Â  Furthermore, Rochester could terminate\r\n  the employer/employee relationship based on a violation of how the work was to\r\n  be performed by the driver, and the driver was only entitled to fifty percent\r\n  of his earnings no matter how much he brought in driving the cab.Â  Because South Carolinaâ€™s policy is to resolve jurisdictional doubts in favor of the inclusion of\r\n  employers and employees under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, and because there\r\n  was ample evidence from which such a relationship could be found to exist, the\r\n  decision of the circuit court is respectfully \r\nREVERSED.[1]\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT, J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-324","title":"Parker v.

Mattison Bogan, both of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tRobert Brown, of Fort Mott, pro se.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this landlord-tenant\r\n  action, the magistrate found Celestine Parker wrongfully withheld a portion of\r\n  Robert Brownâ€™s security deposit and awarded Brown treble damages.Â  The circuit\r\n  court affirmed, and Parker appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 3, 2004, Parker and Brown entered\r\n  into a six-month lease wherein Brown agreed to rent Parkerâ€™s house.Â  Brown\r\n  agreed to pay Parker $575 a month commencing on January 1, 2005.Â  The lease\r\n  also called for Brown to pay a security deposit of $550.Â  According to Parker, in\r\n  an addendum to the rental contract, the parties agreed Brown would move in on\r\n  December 18, 2004.[1]Â \r\n  However, Brown moved in on December 15, 2004. \r\nUnder\r\n  the terms of the rental contact, the lease expired on June 30, 2005, but\r\n  testimony indicates Brown left personal items in the rental property until July\r\n  6, 2005.Â  Following a final inspection of the property, Parker determined Brown\r\n  was not entitled to a full refund of his security deposit.Â  Instead, Parker\r\n  refunded Brown $269.64 of the $550 deposit, making several deductions.Â  \r\nBrown\r\n  filed a complaint in magistrateâ€™s court alleging Parker made unauthorized\r\n  deductions from his security deposit and failed to return the deposit in a\r\n  timely manner.Â  The magistrate awarded Brown treble damages of $1100, finding Parker\r\n  did not itemize the deductions and send the cost of repairs or refund the\r\n  security deposit in a timely manner.Â  The circuit court affirmed the award based\r\n  upon its finding that substantial evidence supported the magistrateâ€™s order.Â \r\n  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn review from the\r\n  circuit court, the appellate court is without authority to reverse findings of\r\n  fact if there is any supporting evidence.Â  Vacation Time of Hilton Head Island,\r\n    Inc. v. Kiwi Corp., 280 S.C. 232, 234, 312 S.E.2d 20, 21&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  1984).Â  This court presumes an affirmance by a circuit court of a magistrateâ€™s\r\n  judgment was made upon the merits when the testimony is sufficient to sustain\r\n  the magistrateâ€™s judgment and there are no facts that show the affirmance was\r\n  influenced by an error of law.Â  Parks v. Characters Night Club, 345 S.C.\r\n  484, 490, 548 S.E.2d 605, 608&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001).Â  Unless we find an error of\r\n  law, the appellate court will affirm the circuit courtâ€™s holding if there are\r\n  any facts supporting the decision.Â  Hadfield v. Gilchrist, 343 S.C. 88,\r\n  94, 538 S.E.2d 268, 271&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR\r\nInitially, Parker contends this court should reverse\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order, pursuant to Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR, because Brown\r\n  failed to file an initial brief.Â  We disagree.\r\nUpon the failure of\r\n  respondent to timely file a brief, the appellate court â€œmay take such action as\r\n  it deems proper.â€Â  Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR.Â  South Carolina courts have\r\n  recognized the failure of a respondent to file a brief could justify a reversal.Â  Turner v. Santee Cement Carriers, Inc.,&nbsp; 277 S.C. 91, 96, 282\r\n  S.E.2d 858, 860&nbsp;(1981).Â  Furthermore, when a respondent does not file a\r\n  brief, this court has found it proper to address the issues as presented by the\r\n  appellant.Â  Durham v. United Cos. Fin. Corp.,&nbsp; 326 S.C. 403, 404,\r\n  483 S.E.2d 786 (Ct. App. 1997) revâ€™d on other grounds, 331 S.C. 600, 503 S.E.2d\r\n  465 (1998).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Brownâ€™s failure to file a brief with this court could justify reversal, we do\r\n  not deem it proper to reverse under these facts.Â  The record is sufficient to\r\n  provide this court with an understanding of the issues on appeal.Â  \r\nII.Â  Civil Relief Act\r\nParker next\r\n  maintains the circuit court erred affirming the decision of the magistrate failing\r\n  to stay the case because co-defendant Stanley Parker was on active military duty.Â \r\n  This issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nAn issue cannot be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order for an issue to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review it must be raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court.Â  Staubes\r\n    v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).Â \r\n  â€œError preservation requirements are intended â€˜to enable the lower court to\r\n  rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and\r\n  arguments.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Iâ€™On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C.\r\n  406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000)).Â  Where the circuit court has not ruled\r\n  on an issue, â€œa reviewing court simply would not be able to evaluate whether\r\n  the trial court committed error.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn the present\r\n  case, the magistrate received a fax from Stanley Parker stating he was on\r\n  active duty outside the state and could not be in attendance.Â  The record does\r\n  not indicate a request to stay the proceedings was made pursuant to the Civil\r\n  Relief Act.Â  Furthermore, even if we liberally construe Stanley Parkerâ€™s fax to\r\n  the Magistrate as an application for a stay of proceedings, Parker did not\r\n  appeal the Magistrateâ€™s denial of the request to stay to the circuit court.Â  Biales\r\n    v. Young, 315 S.C. 166, 168, 432 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1993) (â€œFailure to [challenge a ruling] is an abandonment of\r\n  the issue and precludes consideration on appeal.â€).Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  Moreover,\r\n  we fail to discern any prejudice because Stanley Parkerâ€™s name was not on the\r\n  partiesâ€™ contract.Â  Accordingly, this issue is without merit. \r\nIII.Â  Security Deposit\r\nParker maintains the magistrate erred in finding she\r\n  improperly withheld deductions from Brownâ€™s security deposit and failed to\r\n  return the balance in a timely manner.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tThe South Carolina\r\n  Residential Landlord and Tenant Act provides:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a) Upon\r\n  termination of the tenancy, property or money held by the landlord as security\r\n  must be returned less amounts withheld by the landlord for accrued rent and\r\n  damages which the landlord has suffered . . . .Â  Any deduction from the\r\n  security/rental deposit must be itemized by the landlord in a written notice to\r\n  the tenant . . . within thirty days after termination of the tenancy and\r\n  delivery of possession and demand by the tenant, whichever is later. The tenant\r\n  shall provide the landlord in writing with a forwarding address or new address\r\n  to which the written notice and amount due from the landlord may be sent.Â  If\r\n  the tenant fails to provide the landlord with the forwarding or new address,\r\n  the tenant is not entitled to damages under this subsection provided the\r\n  landlord (1) had no notice of the tenantâ€™s whereabouts and\r\n  (2) mailed the written notice and amount due, if any, to the tenantâ€™s last\r\n  known address.\r\n\t\t(b) If the landlord fails to return to the tenant any prepaid rent\r\n  or security/rental deposit with the notice required to be sent by the landlord\r\n  pursuant to subsection (a), the tenant may recover the property and money in an\r\n  amount equal to three times the amount wrongfully withheld and reasonable\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-410(a)&amp;(b) (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nHere, Parker\r\n  determined Brown was entitled to the return of only $269.64 of his $550 security\r\n  deposit.Â  Parker made the\r\n  following deductions: (1) $24.72 for a June 2005 telephone bill; (2) $65.00 for\r\n  landscaping; (3) $80.00 for carpet cleaning; (4) $54.99 for new locks; and (5)\r\n  $55.65 in rental fees.Â  \r\nThe magistrate heard the partiesâ€™ testimony and determined\r\n  Parkerâ€™s deductions were unauthorized for the following reasons:Â  Brown\r\n  paid the June 2005 phone bill; Parker failed to produce a receipt for landscaping\r\n  the rental property; the receipt for carpet cleaning was post dated August 8,\r\n  2008, and indicated a charge of only $60; it was Parkerâ€™s responsibility to\r\n  change the locks after Brown moved out; and Parker was not entitled to rent for\r\n  three days in December 2004.Â  Each of these findings is supported by evidence\r\n  in the record; therefore, the circuit\r\n  court properly upheld the findings of the magistrate.\r\nThe magistrate\r\n  also concluded Parker failed to return the security deposit in a timely\r\n  manner.Â  Although Brown vacated the property on June 30, 2005, it appears some\r\n  of his possessions remained there until July 6, 2005.Â  At the hearing, Parker stated\r\n  she returned part of Brownâ€™s security deposit on July 6, 2005.[2]Â \r\n  However, the evidence presented indicated Parker did not mail the check to Brown\r\n  until August 6, 2005.Â  In addition, Parker contended she could not refund the\r\n  security deposit because she did not have the proper forwarding address,\r\n  although she admitted to the circuit court on appeal she possessed the address\r\n  Brown claimed was his permanent address.Â  As a result, the magistrate and the\r\n  circuit court did not err in finding Parker returned a portion of Brownâ€™s\r\n  security deposit more than thirty days following the termination of the tenancy\r\n  and in awarding treble damages.Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s order affirming the\r\n  magistrateâ€™s findings is\r\nAFFIRMED. [3]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  SHORT, J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The addendum was not signed by either party.Â  \r\n[2] On appeal to the circuit court, Parker stated Brownâ€™s\r\n  mother removed personal items from the rental property on July 7, 2005, which\r\n  would have made Parkerâ€™s mailing of the security deposit timely.Â  However, the\r\n  record does not show this argument was raised to the magistrate.\r\n[3] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-325","title":"Savannah Architectural Supply v.

Finn, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tLeo A. Dryer, Jr., of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  James\r\n  Brady appeals the trial courtâ€™s order finding him liable on a contract with Savannah Architectural Supply, Inc.\r\n  (Savannah Architectural).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1986, Brady and another\r\n  individual formed Boru Enterprises, Inc., which did business under the trade\r\n  name Brady Builders.Â  Brady was also president of Boru Enterprises.Â  In\r\n  1999, Rick Bohrer, an employee of Boru Enterprises, requested a quote from\r\n  Savannah Architectural on behalf of Brady Builders.Â  As a result,\r\n  Savannah Architectural opened an account for Brady Builders. Construction\r\n  materials amounting to $43,602.47,[2] were ordered\r\n  on the account between June 21, 1999 and March 21, 2001.Â  No payment was\r\n  made and Savannah Architectural brought suit against Brady personally.Â  Brady\r\n  answered asserting he was employed by Boru Enterprises, and thus, not\r\n  personally liable.Â  Brady also stated Boru Enterprises was no longer actively\r\n  conducting business.Â  \r\nAt trial, Chester Gayheart, the president\r\n  of Savannah Architectural, testified Brady had been a customer of Savannah\r\n  Architectural since 1995.Â  Additionally, Gayheart testified he believed\r\n  he was dealing with a sole proprietorship Brady owned and was unaware of the\r\n  existence of Boru Enterprises.Â  As evidence, Savannah\r\n  Architectural offered (1) draw requests submitted by Brady Builders and signed\r\n  by Brady with no corporate designations regarding the project for which the\r\n  materials Savannah Architectural provided were used; (2) copies of a cashierâ€™s\r\n  check issued jointly to Brady Builders and itself by one of Brady Builderâ€™s\r\n  customers, which did not reference Boru Enterprises; and (3) several of its\r\n  invoices addressed to Brady Builders for the construction materials.Â  Further, Brady testified he regularly signed his name without designating himself as\r\n  a corporate officer.Â  However, Gayheart admitted Savannah Architectural\r\n  had not seen the draw requests at the time it provided the construction\r\n  materials to Brady Builders.\r\nThe trial court found Boru Enterprises was\r\n  an undisclosed principal, and thus, Brady was liable as an agent for the amount\r\n  due and interest.Â  Approximately a month after the trial court issued\r\n  its order, Brady filed a Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion for relief from judgment.Â  Brady asserted he had newly discovered evidence in the form of a check paid\r\n  to Savannah Architectural that noted Brady Builders was a division of Boru\r\n  Enterprises.Â  The trial court denied the motion finding the check was not newly\r\n  discovered evidence because it was in Bradyâ€™s own records and he was aware of\r\n  its existence prior to trial.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn\r\n  action on an open account is an action at law.â€Â  Spartanburg Regâ€™l\r\n    Med. Ctr. v. Bulsa, 308 S.C. 322, 323, 417 S.E.2d 648, 649&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  1992).Â  On appeal of an action at law tried without a jury, this courtâ€™s review\r\n  is limited to correction of errors at law.Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home v.\r\n    Beasley,&nbsp;365 S.C. 157, 164, 616 S.E.2d 710, 714&nbsp;(2005).Â  The\r\n  trial courtâ€™s findings are equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.Â  King\r\n    v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 317 S.C. 385, 389, 453 S.E.2d 885, 888&nbsp;(1995).Â \r\n  Questions regarding credibility and weight of evidence are exclusively for the\r\n  trial court.Â  Sheek v. Crimestoppers Alarm Sys.,&nbsp;297 S.C. 375, 377,\r\n  377 S.E.2d 132, 133&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1989).Â  â€œWe must look at the evidence in the\r\n  light most favorable to the respondents and eliminate from consideration all\r\n  evidence to the contrary.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  Liability\r\nBrady\r\n  contends the trial court erred in granting judgment against him after finding\r\n  Bohrer was an agent for Boru Enterprises, an undisclosed principal.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nâ€œAn agent is one appointed by a principal as his\r\n  representative and to whom the principal confides the management of some business to be transacted in the principalâ€™s name, or on his\r\n  account, and who brings about or effects legal relationships between the principal and third parties.â€Â  Colleton County Taxpayers Assâ€™n v. Sch. Dist. of Colleton County,&nbsp;371\r\n  S.C. 224, 239, 638 S.E.2d 685, 693&nbsp;(2006).Â  If an agent did not disclose\r\n  his principal when making a contract with a party, the party, upon discovering\r\n  the principal, may hold either the agent or the principal liable.Â  See Goodale\r\n    v. Page, 92 S.C. 413, 416, 75 S.E. 700, 701&nbsp;(1912); see\r\n      also Broom v. Marshall, 284 S.C. 530, 540, 328 S.E.2d 639,\r\n  645&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1984) (Gardner, J. dissenting) (quoting 3 C.J.S. Agency Â§ 369 (1973)) (â€œAn agent . . . if he contracts as agent for an undisclosed principal, will be personally liable unless\r\n    there is a mutual intention of the parties to the contrary.â€); Restatement\r\n  (Third) of Agency Â§ 6.03 (2006) (â€œWhen\r\n    an agent acting with actual authority makes a contract on behalf of an\r\n    undisclosed principal, (1) unless excluded by the contract, the principal is a party to the\r\n      contract; [and] (2) the agent and the third party are parties to the contract .\r\n      . . .â€).Â  â€œA principal\r\n        is undisclosed if, when an agent and a third party interact, the third party\r\n        has no notice that the agent is acting for a principal.â€Â  Restatement\r\n  (Third) of Agency Â§ 1.04(2)(b) (2006).\r\nBrady routinely did\r\n  business with Savannah Architectural as an agent of Boru Enterprises.Â  However,\r\n  Savannah Architectural had no indication Brady was acting on behalf of a corporation.Â \r\n  Therefore, Boru Enterprises was an undisclosed principal, and thus, Brady can\r\n  be held liable as its agent.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in\r\n  finding Brady personally liable for the debt.\r\nII.Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP,\r\n  Motion\r\nBrady maintains the\r\n  trial court erred in failing to grant his Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  decision to deny a motion under\r\n  Rule 60(b) is within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion.Â  Raby Constr.,\r\n    L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 17, 594 S.E.2d 478, 482 (2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision is controlled by an error of law or is based on factual\r\n  findings lacking evidentiary support.Â  Degenhart v. Burriss, 360 S.C. 497, 500, 602 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).\r\nOn\r\n  motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party\r\n  from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for newly discovered evidence that\r\n  by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial\r\n  under Rule 59(b), SCRCP.Â  Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  \r\n\r\n\tTo\r\n  obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, a movant must establish\r\n  that the newly discovered evidence: (1) will probably change the result if a new trial is granted; (2) has been\r\n  discovered since the trial; (3) could not have been discovered before the\r\n  trial; (4) is material to the issue; and (5) is not merely cumulative or\r\n  impeaching.\r\n\r\nLanier v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 217, 612 S.E.2d 456, 459&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  When the party knew of and possessed evidence at the time of trial,\r\n  it is not newly discovered for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(2).Â  Lanier,\r\n  364 S.C. at 218, 612 S.E.2d at 459.\r\nâ€œRule\r\n  60(b)(2) allows the court to grant a new trial only if the newly discovered\r\n  evidence could not have been discovered by due diligence prior to trial.â€Â  Lanier,\r\n  364 S.C. at 220, 612 S.E.2d at 460.Â  Due diligence is the â€œdiligence reasonably\r\n  expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a person who seeks to satisfy a\r\n  legal requirement or to discharge an obligation.â€Â  Id. â€œDiligence looks\r\n  not to what the litigant actually discovered, but what he or she could have discovered.â€Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, when parties could\r\n  have discovered the new evidence prior to trial, they are not entitled to\r\n  relief under Rule 60(b)(2).Â  See Raby Constr., L.L.P., 358 S.C.\r\n  at 21, 594 S.E.2d at 484 (citing Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 152, 591\r\n  S.E.2d 654, 657 (Ct. App. 2004)).\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, the check was in Boru Enterprisesâ€™ records.Â  Simply because\r\n  those records were in a state of disarray does not change the fact Brady had\r\n  access to them before trial.Â  This court has previously found â€œ[w]hen a party\r\n  simply misplaces evidence at home, the court will treat the failure to discover\r\n  it as a failure to exercise due diligence.â€Â  Lanier, 364 S.C. at 220,\r\n  612 S.E.2d at 461.Â  Here, Brady testified as to the existence of such a check\r\n  at trial.Â  Accordingly, he knew of the check and had access to Boru\r\n  Enterprisesâ€™ records.Â  Therefore, the check did not constitute newly discovered\r\n  evidence.Â  Further, because Brady could have discovered the check prior to\r\n  trial, he failed to exercise due diligence.Â Â  Consequently, the trial court did\r\n  not err in denying Bradyâ€™s Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The parties stipulated to this amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-326","title":"Windham v.

Jackson Kimball, III, Special Circuit\r\n  Court Judge\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2008-UP-327\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2008 â€“ Filed June 27,\r\n  2008Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIvan N. Walters, of Rock Hill, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJoshua B. Vann, and Lucy L. McDow, both of Rock Hill, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this trespass action, Jason Parker appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary\r\n  judgment in favor of Ronald Plexico.Â  Specifically, Parker argues the trial\r\n  court erred in finding dams Plexico constructed were not a continuing trespass\r\n  and Parkerâ€™s claim was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nPlexico owned property located on Lake Wylie. He observed stream drainage from the neighboring property entering his\r\n  property.&nbsp; Over time, the steam drainage caused his land to erode.&nbsp;\r\n  He received permission from the owner of the neighboring property to construct\r\n  two retention ponds and dams (collectively, â€œthe damsâ€), which were completed\r\n  by 1990.&nbsp; Ten years later, Plexicoâ€™s son, David, purchased the Lake Wylie property.\r\nIn June 2002, Parker acquired the neighboring property as\r\n  co-tenant with his father.Â  Parker later acquired his fatherâ€™s interest and\r\n  began developing the property. Â Parker attempted to obtain permits but\r\n  halted development because of conflicting positions regarding the dams taken by\r\n  the Army Corps of Engineers, York County, and Duke Energy Corporation.Â  Consequently,\r\n  Parker brought an action against Plexico seeking damages for civil conspiracy\r\n  and a continuing trespass caused by the dam construction.Â  In response,\r\n  Plexico filed a motion for summary judgment asserting: (1) Parker has no claim\r\n  for trespass because he did not own the property at the time the dams were constructed;\r\n  (2) Parker is barred from proceeding on his claim under the statute of\r\n  limitations; and (3) Parker has no evidence of a civil conspiracy to prevent\r\n  the removal of the dams on his property.\r\nThe trial court granted Plexicoâ€™s motion, finding the dams\r\n  â€œconstitute a permanent, one-time alteration of the property, and any injury in\r\n  regard to them occurred at the time they were constructed.â€Â  The trial court\r\n  also found Plexico could not have had intent to harm or damage Parker when the\r\n  dams were constructed because Parker did not own the property at that time.Â \r\n  Further, the trial court concluded Parkerâ€™s claim was barred by the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  Thereafter, Parker filed a motion to alter or amend judgment,\r\n  which the trial court denied. Â This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is\r\n  proper when no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Hurst v. E. Coast Hockey League, Inc., 371 S.C. 33, 36, 637 S.E.2d 560, 561\r\n  (2006).Â  On appeal from a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard governing the trial court.Â  Id.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact\r\n  exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom must be\r\n  viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006).Â  â€œA court considering summary judgment neither makes factual\r\n  determinations nor considers the merits of competing testimony; however,\r\n  summary judgment is completely appropriate when a properly supported motion\r\n  sets forth facts that remain undisputed or are contested in a deficient manner.â€ Â David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 250, 626 S.E.2d 1,\r\n  5&nbsp;(2006). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Continuing Trespass\r\nParker\r\n  contends the trial court erred in finding the dams constructed by Plexico were\r\n  not a continuing trespass.[2]Â  We disagree.\r\nTrespass\r\n  is defined as â€œany intentional invasion of the plaintiffâ€™s interest in the\r\n  exclusive possession of his property.â€Â  Hedgepath v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,\r\n  348 S.C. 340, 357, 559 S.E.2d 327, 337 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Thus, actual or\r\n  constructive possession by the plaintiff at the time of the trespass is a\r\n  necessary element to maintain an action for trespass.Â  Daniels v. Coleman, 253 S.C. 218, 229, 169 S.E.2d 593, 598 (1969).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  a purchaser who acquires title after the act of trespass has no action for\r\n  trespass, unless his title is retrospective in nature and dates back to the\r\n  time of the trespass.Â  75 Am. Jur. 2d Trespass Â§ 29 (2007).Â  However, an\r\n  exception exists when a trespass is continuing and has not ceased by the time\r\n  the purchaser acquires title to the property.Â  Id. \r\nA\r\n  continuing trespass is intermittent or periodical and occurs so often it is\r\n  said to be continuing, although it is not necessarily constant or unceasing.Â  Silvester\r\n    v. Spring Valley Country Club, 344 S.C. 280, 286, 543 S.E.2d 563, 566 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).Â  Typically, a trespass is continuing if\r\n  abatement is reasonably and practically possible.Â  Id. at 287, 543\r\n  S.E.2d at 567. Â On the contrary, a permanent\r\n  trespass â€œmay be expected to continue but is presumed to continue permanently,\r\n  with no possibility of abatement.â€Â  Id. at 286, 543 S.E.2d at 566-67.Â  When a permanent trespass has occurred, the injury is fixed\r\n  and goes to the whole value of the land. Â Id., 543 S.E.2d at 567.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, Parker misconstrues the nature of the dams constructed by\r\n  Plexico as a continuing trespass.Â  Even assuming the dams were wrongfully\r\n  constructed, the dams represent the damage caused by the trespass, not the\r\n  trespass itself.[3]Â  As noted by the trial\r\n  court, â€œThe dams are not a continuing inference with Parkerâ€™s possession; they\r\n  represent damage to the land of which he now has undisputed exclusive\r\n  possession.â€Â  Furthermore, removal of the dams would not abate any repeated\r\n  intrusion upon Parkerâ€™s property; rather, removal would simply eliminate the\r\n  offending condition.[4]Â  Because the record\r\n  reflects no new occurrence of injury after Parkerâ€™s purchase of the property,\r\n  Plexico did not commit a continuing trespass.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did\r\n  not err in refusing to submit Parkerâ€™s continuing trespass cause of action to\r\n  the jury.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Statute of Limitations\r\nParker\r\n  further maintains the trial court erred in finding his claim was barred by the statute\r\n  of limitations.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to attack Plexicoâ€™s statute of limitations defense, Parker\r\n  seeks to characterize his property damage claim as a continuing trespass.Â  When\r\n  a trespass â€œis permanent and only one cause of action may be brought for\r\n  damages, the statute of limitations bars the action if it is not brought within\r\n  the statutory period after the first actionable injury.â€Â  Hedgepath,\r\n  348 S.C. at 357, 559 S.E.2d at 337.Â  However,\r\n  when the trespass is characterized as continuing, â€œthe expiration of the\r\n  limitations period after the first actionable injury does not effect a complete\r\n  bar as each new injury gives rise to a new cause of action and a landowner may\r\n  at any time recover for an injury to his land which occurred within the statutory\r\n  period.â€Â  Id. at 358, 559 S.E.2d at 337.\r\nAs previously noted, we find the dams constitute a permanent\r\n  trespass as opposed to a continuing trespass.Â  Indeed, Parkerâ€™s claim is premised entirely on the\r\n  construction of the dams and not any continued operation, use, or recurring\r\n  activity by Plexico.Â  Thus, under settled precedent, the statute of limitations\r\n  has run as to the trespass of which the dams are a remaining condition.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-3-530(3) (2005) (requiring a plaintiff bringing a cause of action for\r\n  trespass to file suit within three years from when the cause of action arose).Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to\r\n  Plexico under the statute of limitations. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the trial court did not err in granting Plexicoâ€™s motion for summary\r\n  judgment.Â  Accordingly, the decision of\r\n  the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Parker asserts the trial court improperly relied on\r\n  nuisance and inverse condemnation jurisprudence in deciding if the dams were a\r\n  permanent or continuing trespass.Â  This court has previously utilized these\r\n  types of cases in analyzing continuing trespass situations. See Knight v. Waggoner, 359 S.C. 492, 496, 597 S.E.2d 894, 896 (Ct. App. 2004); Whitfield\r\n    Constr. Co. v. Bank of Tokyo Trust Co.,&nbsp;338 S.C. 207, 218, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  888, 894&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999).Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s reliance.\r\n[3] Contrary to Parkerâ€™s contention, the record does not demonstrate\r\n  an unauthorized entry upon his property; the only evidence indicates the\r\n  previous landowner authorized Plexicoâ€™s entry onto Parkerâ€™s property.\r\n[4] Parker argues this court should treat the abatability\r\n  of the dams as a factual issue and remand for a jury determination of whether\r\n  the dams are removable.Â  However, because Parker failed to raise this argument\r\n  to the trial court, it is not preserved for our review.Â  See In re Michael H., 360 S.C.\r\n  540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (â€œAn issue may not be\r\n  raised for the first time on appeal.Â  In order to preserve an issue for appeal,\r\n  it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2008-UP-328","title":"Meeks v.

Killoren, Jr., of Harrison, of Spartanburg, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tRobert Eric Davis, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this civil case, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of David Meeksâ€™ motion for\r\n  a new trial nisi additur. Â \r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 23, 2000, David Meeks (Meeks) was stopped at the\r\n  intersection of Floyd Road and Highway 221 in Spartanburg County, South Carolina.Â  Bobby Goings (Goings) was attempting to make a left turn onto Floyd Road from the southbound lane of Highway 221.Â  Goings collided with a vehicle\r\n  traveling north on Highway 221.Â  As a result of this collision, Goingsâ€™ vehicle\r\n  collided with Meeksâ€™ vehicle.Â  \r\nMeeks sought to recover medical expenses allegedly incurred as a\r\n  result of the accident and the cost of a future, unscheduled surgery to his\r\n  ribs.Â  In August 1998, Meeks was injured when he was kicked in his ribs by a\r\n  deer.Â  The deer kick was in the same area as the alleged injury Meeks sustained\r\n  in the automobile accident.Â  \r\nIn 2002, approximately four years after the deer kick and two years\r\n  after the automobile accident, Meeks was referred to Dr. Michael Zhadkevich, a\r\n  board certified heart, lung, and general surgeon.Â  Dr. Zhadkevich and Meeks\r\n  discussed surgical options in 2002 and 2003 to correct his alleged injuries.Â  However,\r\n  Meeks never scheduled surgery, but he did return to Dr. Zhadkevich in 2007,\r\n  seven years after his automobile accident.Â  Dr. Zhadkevich testified Meeks was\r\n  â€œdoing pretty well.â€Â  \r\nDuring the trial, Meeksâ€™ wife, Lucia, testified.Â  During cross-\r\n  examination, Goings asked Lucia the cost of tuition associated with educating\r\n  their child in a private school.Â  Meeks objected, arguing the question was\r\n  irrelevant.Â  The trial court overruled this objection.Â  \r\nAt the close of the trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of\r\n  Meeks for $3,548.25.Â  This amount represented Meeksâ€™ actual medical bills.Â  The\r\n  jury did not award Meeks the approximate $24,430 he was seeking for the\r\n  unscheduled, future surgery.Â  Meeks filed a motion for a new trial nisi additur.Â \r\n  Meeks argued the jury award was insufficient because the jury failed to award\r\n  him the cost of the future surgery.Â  The trial court denied this motion.Â  This\r\n  appeal follows.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMeeks argues the trial court committed reversible error in two\r\n  respects: (1) denying his motion for a new trial nisi additur,\r\n  and (2) overruling his objection to questioning concerning the cost of his\r\n  childâ€™s tuition.Â  \r\nA. New trial nisi additur[1]\r\nMeeks\r\n  first argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial nisi additur.Â  We disagree. Â  \r\nOur decision in Howard v. Roberson succinctly sets out the\r\n  law regarding a new trial nisi additur. \r\n\r\n\tA new\r\n  trial nisi is one in which a new trial will be granted unless the party\r\n  opposing it complies with a condition set by the court.Â  The grant or denial of\r\n  new trial motions rests within the discretion of the trial judge, and his\r\n  decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings are wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by error\r\n  of law.Â  The trial court alone has the power to grant a new trial nisi when he finds the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate or excessive.Â \r\n  However, compelling reasons must be given to justify invading the juryâ€™s\r\n  province by granting a new trial nisi additur or remittitur.Â \r\n  The consideration for a motion for a new trial nisi additur or \r\n\tremittitur requires the trial judge to consider the adequacy of the verdict in light of\r\n  the evidence presented.Â  Great deference is given to the trial judge who heard\r\n  the evidence and is more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial, and\r\n  who thus possesses a better-informed view of the damages than this Court.Â  \r\n\r\n376 S.C. 143,\r\n  155-56, 654 S.E.2d 877, 883-84 (Ct. App. 2007) (internal quotations and\r\n  citations omitted). \r\nThe record contains ample evidence to demonstrate the trial court\r\n  did not abuse its discretion in denying Meeksâ€™ nisi additur motion.Â  Meeks was kicked in his left ribs in 1998 by a deer, which Meeksâ€™\r\n  family physician noted may have caused â€œa rib fracture on [his] left side.â€Â  This\r\n  kick was in the same area as the alleged injury Meeks sustained in the\r\n  automobile accident in 2000.Â  Based on this, the jury could have easily\r\n  concluded Meeksâ€™ injury was not the result of the automobile accident but rather\r\n  a result of the deer kick.Â  \r\nAdditionally, from June 2003 to January 2007, Meeks was actively\r\n  working and did not require any medical attention.Â  When Meeks returned to Dr.\r\n  Zhadkevich in 2007, seven years after his automobile accident, Dr. Zhadkevich\r\n  concluded Meeksâ€™ â€œphysical exam reveal[ed] a robust gentleman who look[ed] much\r\n  younger than his age.Â  His pain in the area of the previous fracture has\r\n  significantly improved with only minimal discomfort . . . .â€Â  Relying on this\r\n  evidence, the jury could have concluded Meeks would not need surgery in the\r\n  future because he did not suffer any apparent injury from the automobile\r\n  accident.Â  Based on the foregoing, we cannot say the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion in denying Meeksâ€™ nisi additur motion.Â  See id. (â€œThe grant or denial of new trial\r\n  motions rests within the discretion of the trial judge, and his decision will\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings are wholly unsupported by the\r\n  evidence . . . .â€).\r\nB. Admission\r\n  of evidence[2] \r\nMeeks also\r\n  argues the trial court improperly allowed Goings to inquire into the cost of\r\n  tuition associated with educating his child in a private school.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Burroughs v. Worsham,\r\n  352 S.C. 382, 391, 574 S.E.2d 215, 219-20 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The exercise of\r\n  this discretion will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that\r\n  discretion.Â  Id.Â  We may reverse the trial courtâ€™s decision only if the\r\n  appellant shows both an error in the ruling and resulting prejudice.Â  Id.\r\nIn this case, even if we assume the trial courtâ€™s decision was\r\n  erroneous, Meeks has failed to show prejudice.Â  Meeks argues the jury\r\n  envisioned him as an affluent individual who could afford to pay for his own\r\n  surgery.Â  Meeks contends he was prejudiced because even though Goings was found\r\n  liable, the jury failed to award him the cost of the surgery to correct his\r\n  alleged injuries.Â  However, as explained above, the jury could have concluded Meeksâ€™ injury\r\n  to his ribs was not the result of the automobile accident.Â  Likewise, the jury\r\n  could have concluded Meeks would not need surgery in the future.Â  Since we find\r\n  no prejudice, we conclude there is no reversible error.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Goings argues this issue is not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  We disagree. Meeks filed a motion for a new trial nisi additur, and the trial\r\n  court ruled upon this motion.Â  Thus, this\r\n  issue is preserved for our review.Â  Wilder Corp.\r\n    v.

Tyler and Donald W. Tyler, Jr., of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tTodd R. Ellis and R. Trippett Boineau, III, of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  First South Bank (First South) appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees, arguing the order failed to award First South legal costs and attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees incurred in bringing an action to set aside a fraudulent conveyance of\r\n  property.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  2002, First South loaned $80,000 to Selective Project Management, Inc.\r\n  (Selective Project), and as a condition of the loan, First South required Ann Leath\r\n  to sign and execute a guaranty for all present and future obligations of\r\n  Selective Project.[2]Â \r\n  The guaranty provided Leathâ€™s liability was â€œunlimitedâ€ and First South may â€œat\r\n  any time or from time to time [] make loans or extend other accommodations to\r\n  or for the account of Selective Project.â€Â  The guaranty further provided Leath\r\n  was â€œliable for all indebtedness, without any limitation as to amount [], plus\r\n  accrued interest thereon and all attorneysâ€™ fees, collection costs and\r\n  enforcement expenses referable thereto.â€Â  Selective Project failed to make the\r\n  required principal and interest payments due under the Note on March 5, 2003.Â  Therefore,\r\n  on May 19, 2003, First South filed a complaint in Richland County to collect payment on the delinquent Note.Â  \r\nOn April 26, 2006, the trial court granted summary judgment to\r\n  First South and required Leath to pay First South $104,065.91, â€œplus attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees and costs (to be awarded by subsequent order).â€Â  The next month, Leath filed\r\n  a motion to reconsider pursuant to Rules 52 and 59(e), SCRCP; however, the motion\r\n  was denied.\r\nAfter Leath was ordered to pay First South for the debt on the\r\n  Note, on July 3, 2006, Leath transferred real property she owned to her son,\r\n  Joseph Leath, for â€œthe sum of One and 00/100 ($1.00) Dollar and Love and\r\n  Affection.â€Â  As a result, First South filed a complaint in Lexington County against Leath for fraudulently conveying her property to her son, and seeking\r\n  an injunction to prevent the committing of waste to the property and litigation\r\n  costs.\r\nAfter a hearing on November 21, 2006, the trial court issued an\r\n  order dated December 19, 2006, awarding First South attorneysâ€™ fees in the\r\n  amount of $12,000.Â  However, the order did not specifically mention an amount\r\n  for legal costs, which the April 26, 2006 order had awarded First South.Â  Thus,\r\n  First South filed a motion to alter or amend the courtâ€™s December order,\r\n  arguing the court failed to set an amount for legal costs to be awarded to\r\n  First South.Â  First South also argued the court failed to address whether the\r\n  award includes attorneysâ€™ fees incurred in bringing the related action in Lexington County to set aside Leathâ€™s fraudulent conveyance.Â  The court denied First\r\n  Southâ€™s motion on March 9, 2007.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an\r\n  action at law to recover on a guaranty, our scope of review extends only to the\r\n  correction of errors at law and does not permit an entry of an original\r\n  judgment.Â  S. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Harley, 295 S.C. 423, 424, 368\r\n  S.E.2d 908, 909 (1988).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Attorneysâ€™ Fees\r\nFirst\r\n  South argues the trial court erred by failing to award attorneysâ€™ fees incurred in bringing the related\r\n  action in Lexington County to set aside Leathâ€™s fraudulent conveyance of her\r\n  property to her son.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe decision to award attorneyâ€™s fees is a matter within the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial judge and the award will not be reversed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Marquez v. Caudill, 376 S.C. 229, 246, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 737, 745 (2008); see Keeneyâ€™s Metal Roofing, Inc. v. Palmieri,\r\n  345 S.C. 550, 553, 548 S.E.2d 900, 901 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The factors used to determine\r\n  a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee are: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the\r\n  case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing\r\n  of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and\r\n  (6) customary legal fees for similar services.Â  EFCO Corp. v. Renaissance on\r\n    Charleston Harbor, LLC, 370 S.C. 612, 621, 635 S.E.2d 922, 926 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006).Â  â€œ[O]n appeal, an award for attorneyâ€™s fees will be affirmed so long as\r\n  sufficient evidence in the record supports each factor.â€Â  Jackson v.\r\n    Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 308, 486 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1997).\r\nIn the December 19, 2006 order, the court awarded First South\r\n  $12,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees, which was less than the $31,449.75 First South\r\n  requested.Â  The court stated, â€œ[a]fter listening to the testimony given as well\r\n  as reviewing the affidavits and invoices, it is the Courtâ€™s conclusion that the\r\n  proposed attorneyâ€™s fees in the case are not reasonable and as such must be\r\n  reduced.â€Â  The court further found the case was simple, â€œthe billing procedure\r\n  [did] not accurately reflect the time spent on every matter and [was]\r\n  unreasonableâ€ due to the fact the attorneys were well-qualified and\r\n  experienced, and â€œcustomary legal fees for [this type of case] are a small\r\n  percentage of the total amount owed.â€Â  The court also was aware of the existence\r\n  of the fraudulent conveyance action when the court awarded the attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  because the court dissolved the temporary injunction issued in that action.Â  Additionally,\r\n  First South raised the issue of attorneysâ€™ fees for the fraudulent conveyance\r\n  action in its motion to reconsider and First South previously argued the issue\r\n  before the court during a November 21, 2006 hearing.\r\nThe trial court considered the appropriate factors in awarding\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Also, the court considered the attorneysâ€™ fees for the\r\n  fraudulent conveyance action.Â  Accordingly, we affirm on this issue.\r\nII.&nbsp; Litigation Costs\r\nFirst South argues the trial court erred by failing to award costs\r\n  as provided for in the order granting summary judgment to First South.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œAn appellate court will not overturn a trial courtâ€™s decision to\r\n  award costs unless there has been an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Peterson v. Natâ€™l\r\n    R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 402, 618 S.E.2d 903, 908 (2005).\r\nÂ The guaranty Leath signed provided she was â€œliable for all\r\n  indebtedness, without any limitation as to amount [], plus accrued interest\r\n  thereon and all attorneysâ€™ fees, collection costs and enforcement expenses\r\n  referable thereto.â€Â  Additionally, the April 26, 2006 order states, â€œFirst\r\n  South is awarded judgment, in an amount to be determined at a future date, for\r\n  its attorneysâ€™ fees, collection costs and enforcement expenses.â€Â  See Order, p. 5.Â  The order further states First South is awarded â€œa total of\r\n  [$104,065.91], plus attorneysâ€™ fees and costs (to be awarded by subsequent\r\n  order).â€Â  First South requested $2,985.47 in costs; however, the trial court\r\n  did not award any costs in its December 19, 2006 order.Â  Additionally, First\r\n  South raised the issue of costs in its motion to reconsider.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  find the trial court erred by failing to award costs to First South and remand\r\n  this issue for a determination on costs.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the judgment of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Michael Leath, Leathâ€™s ex-husband, also signed a\r\n  guaranty, but it is not at issue in this case because First South determined\r\n  Selective Project and Michael Leath had no assets and a default judgment\r\n  against them would be uncollectible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
