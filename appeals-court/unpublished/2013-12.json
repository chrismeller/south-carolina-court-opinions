We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR,\r\nand the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.      As to whether the trial court erred in charging the jury on the issues of\r\ncomparative negligence and open and obvious condition, we find there was\r\nevidence in the record regarding these issues, and therefore, the court correctly\r\ncharged the jury accordingly: Magnolia N.

(the POA), filed this\r\ndeclaratory judgment action to determine the validity of a deed executed on behalf\r\nof Appellant Rivers Point Row, LLC (RPR). The POA alleged the transfer was\r\ninvalid because RPR had previously conveyed the subject property to the POA\r\nwhen RPR, as the Declarant, recorded the Master Deed creating the POA. The\r\npleadings were later amended to include the principals of RPR as third-party\r\ndefendants along with RPR. The matter was referred to the Charleston County\r\nMaster-in-Equity, and motions for summary judgment were filed on behalf of both\r\nRPR and its principals and the POA. Following a hearing on both summary\r\njudgment motions, the Master issued orders granting summary judgment to the\r\nPOA and denying summary judgment to RPR and its principals. In granting\r\nsummary judgment to the POA, the Master held that the subject property had\r\nbecome a common element of the POA when the Master Deed was recorded and\r\nthat once RPR lost its controlling interest pursuant to the terms of the Master Deed,\r\nRPR could no longer amend the Master Deed or resolve to do any act affecting the\r\nPOA without approval of the unit owners. RPR and its principals appeal.\r\n\r\nWe affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.

The trial court granted summary judgment to Respondents, holding\r\nKing could not recover either damages or equitable relief because she did not have\r\na written agreement with Respondents. King appeals. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.    King argues the trial court erred in ruling that pursuant to section 40-57-\r\n135(D)(4) of the South Carolina Code (2011), the absence of a written agreement\r\nbarred her from recovering for the services that she provided to Respondents. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nAt the summary judgment hearing, King argued her claims were based in equity\r\nrather than contract and emphasized that she was not seeking a commission on the\r\nsale of the home that Respondents purchased. Section 40-57-135(D)(4), however,\r\nencompasses the possibility that a buyer's representation agreement could call for\r\ncompensation to the real estate professional in forms other than a commission on a\r\npurchase or sale. This section requires numerous terms of a buyer's representation\r\nagreement to be in writing, including \"the amount of compensation to be paid or\r\nthe method to be used in calculating the amount of compensation to be paid\" and\r\n\"an explanation of how and when the agent earns his compensation.\" S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 40-57-135(D)(4)(b) and (c) (2011) (emphasis added). Furthermore, King\r\nalleged in her complaint and her affidavit that she requested Respondents on\r\nmultiple occasions to execute a buyer's representation agreement, and the evidence\r\nin the record does not give rise to an inference that she expected to be compensated\r\nfor acting in any other capacity than Respondent's buyer's agent. King's affidavit\r\nincludes an assertion that Respondents never indicated they would not sign a\r\nbuyer's representation agreement before ratifying a contract to purchase a home,\r\nand exhibits filed with the trial court included a letter from the South Carolina\r\nRealtors Association asserting King tried to collect a realtor's fee from the broker\r\nwhose firm sold the home to Respondents.\r\n\r\n2.     King also asserts that because Respondents did not establish an agency\r\nrelationship with her by signing a buyer's representation agreement, they were her\r\n\"customers\" pursuant to section 40-57-137(O) of the South Carolina Code (2011).\r\nBased on this customer relationship, King maintains she is entitled to proceed on\r\nher claim under the equitable theories of quantum meruit, unjust enrichment, and\r\nconstructive trust based on language in section 40-57-137(O)(1) of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2011).\r\n\nWe disagree with King's assertion that pursuant to section 40-57-137(O), she\r\nshould be allowed to continue to pursue her claim for equitable relief. First, we\r\nfound no indication in the record on appeal that King raised the issue of her right to\r\nrecover under section 40-57-137(O)(1) during the summary judgment hearing. See\r\nBaughman v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 117, 410 S.E.2d 537, 546 (1991)\r\n(holding an issue was not preserved for appellate review because the plaintiffs\r\nfailed to raise it to the trial court in opposition to the defendant's summary\r\njudgment motion). Furthermore, although section 40-57-137(O)(1) allows a real\r\nestate professional to offer certain services to a customer, section 40-57-137(O)(2)\r\nrequires the real estate professional to provide the customer an explanation of the\r\nscope of services that the professional will provide and to provide accurate\r\ninformation in all dealings. King has not presented evidence that she fulfilled the\r\nrequirements stated in section 40-57-137(O)(2); therefore, we hold King has not\r\ncarried her burden to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether it\r\nwould be inequitable for Respondents to retain the value of her services without\r\npaying for them. See Rule 56(e), SCRCP (requiring the party opposing a summary\r\njudgment motion to \"set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for\r\ntrial\" (emphasis added)); Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341\r\nS.C. 1, 8-9, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872 (2000) (stating that to recover in quantum meruit,\r\na plaintiff must show (1) a benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the defendant,\r\n(2) realization of that benefit by the defendant, and (3) retention of the benefit by\r\nthe defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable for the defendant to\r\nretain it without paying its value); Campbell v. Robinson, 398 S.C. 12, 24, 726\r\nS.E.2d 221, 228 (Ct. App. 2012) (listing similar requirements to recover on a claim\r\nfor unjust enrichment); Macaulay v. Wachovia Bank of S.C., N.A., 351 S.C. 287,\r\n294, 569 S.E.2d 371, 375 (Ct. App. 2002) (\"A constructive trust results when\r\ncircumstances under which property was acquired make it inequitable that it be\r\nretained by the one holding legal title.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n\r\n3.     King also contends there were sufficient questions of fact on various legal\r\ncauses of action set forth in her complaint, namely fraud, civil conspiracy, and\r\nconversion. We disagree and affirm the trial court's dismissal of these claims\r\npursuant to Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR, and the following authorities: Turner v.\r\nMilliman, 392 S.C. 116, 122, 708 S.E.2d 766, 769 (2011) (noting the elements of a\r\nfraud claim include the plaintiff's right to rely on the truth of the false\r\nrepresentation); id. at 124-25, 708 S.E.2d at 770 (\"[A] fraud claim requires proof\r\nby clear and convincing evidence; thus, more than a mere scintilla of evidence\r\nmust be presented to withstand a motion for summary judgment.\"); Oxford Fin.\r\nCos., Inc. v.

Boyd, of James W. Boyd, Attorney, of Rock\r\n             Hill, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n             Amy Miller Snyder and N. Heyward Clarkson, III, both\r\n             of Clarkson, Walsh, Terrell & Coulter, PA, of Greenville,\r\n             for Respondents Staci L. Versen-Rampey and SC\r\n             Emergency Physicians, LLC; and William U. Gunn, of\r\n             Holcombe Bomar, PA, of Spartanburg, for Respondents\r\n             Amisub of South Carolina and Jason Price.\r\n\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.: Ann Adams appeals the circuit court's order finding she failed\r\nto comply with section 15-79-125 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) when\r\nshe did not file an expert affidavit contemporaneously with her Notice of Intent to\r\nFile Suit for medical malpractice. We affirm.\r\n\r\nOn October 28, 2008, Adams's husband died after a week-long stay in the hospital\r\nfollowing a fall. On October 20, 2011, Adams, as personal representative of her\r\nhusband's estate, filed a notice for wrongful death and survival claims against the\r\nhospital, nurse practitioner, radiologic technologist, and radiologist and his\r\npractice. Section 15-79-125 requires that before a plaintiff initiates a lawsuit for\r\n\nmedical malpractice, the party file a notice, contemporaneously with an expert\r\naffidavit, and serve them on the defendant. § 15-79-125(A). Adams failed to\r\ncontemporaneously file her expert affidavit. Each defendant filed a motion to\r\ndismiss, and the circuit court granted all of the motions. Adams appealed, arguing\r\nthe circuit court erred in its interpretation of section 15-79-125 and section 15-36-\r\n100 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012). We disagree.\r\n\r\nBoth sides concede Ranucci v. Crain, 397 S.C. 168, 723 S.E.2d 242 (Ct. App.\r\n2012), cert. granted, (Sept. 6, 2013), controls our interpretation of these statutes.\r\nIn Ranucci, this court affirmed the circuit court's dismissal of Ranucci's notice for\r\nher failure to comply with the contemporaneous filing requirement of section 15-\r\n79-125 because she filed her expert affidavit forty-five days after she filed her\r\nnotice. 397 S.C. at 178, 723 S.E.2d at 247. The court rejected the same argument\r\nAdams makes here—that the affidavit requirements of section 15-36-100 permitted\r\nher to file the affidavit late without violating section 15-79-125. Id.\r\n\r\nAs in Ranucci, because Adams failed to comply with the mandatory filing\r\nrequirements of section 15-79-125, the circuit court's order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., concurring: I concur with the majority that Ranucci controls our\r\ninterpretation of the statutes at issue in this appeal. However, as I explained in my\r\nconcurring opinion in Ranucci, I believe our interpretation requires the conclusion\r\nthat the statute of limitations has expired on any civil action Adams might have\r\nbrought for malpractice. Therefore, the issues raised in this appeal are moot, and I\r\nwould dismiss the appeal. See Ranucci, 397 S.C. at 179-81, 723 S.E.2d at 248-49\r\n(Few, C.J., concurring). But cf. Ross v. Waccamaw Cmty. Hosp., 404 S.C. 56, 66,\r\n744 S.E.2d 547, 552 (2013) (upholding the circuit court's continued jurisdiction\r\nover the notice after the time limits of section 15-79-125 have expired, but not\r\naddressing the right of a plaintiff to serve a summons and complaint after the\r\nexpiration of the statute of limitations).\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-475","title":"SCDSS v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy\r\n        Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Senior\r\n        Assistant Attorney General W. Edgar Salter, III, all of\r\n        Columbia; and Solicitor Scarlett Anne Wilson, of\r\n        Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Gregory Gathers appeals his conviction of murder, arguing the\r\ntrial court erred in admitting autopsy pictures of the victim because the State\r\nobtained the same evidence through the pathologist's testimony and his use of\r\ndiagrams. Gathers contends exhibits ten through fifteen were not necessary to\r\nestablish material facts and the danger of undue prejudice outweighed the\r\nprobative value.\r\n\r\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting exhibits ten through twelve.\r\nSee State v. Collins, 398 S.C. 197, 202, 727 S.E.2d 751, 754 (Ct. App. 2012) (\"The\r\nadmission of evidence is within the [trial] court's discretion and will not be\r\nreversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.\"). These exhibits were\r\npictures of the victim's face showing cuts on her eyelids. During trial, Gathers\r\nrepeatedly asserted he did not cut the victim. He stated the victim reached for a\r\nknife, and he hit her while he was grabbing the knife from her, causing her to fall\r\nand hit her head. Exhibits ten through twelve were probative to whether Gathers\r\nintentionally cut the victim's eyelids, which was probative to malice. See id.\r\n(\"Probative means tending to prove or disprove.\" (internal quotation marks and\r\ncitation omitted)); S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-10 (2003) (\"'Murder' is the killing of any\r\nperson with malice aforethought, either express or implied.\"). Although exhibits\r\nten through twelve were prejudicial, they were less prejudicial than pictures\r\nexcluded by the trial court because they were taken after the pathologist cleaned\r\nmost of the blood from the victim's face. Accordingly, the probative value of\r\nexhibits ten through twelve was not substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\nunfair prejudice. See Rule 403, SCRE (\"Although relevant, evidence may be\r\nexcluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\nprejudice . . . .\"); Collins, 398 S.C. at 207, 727 S.E.2d at 757 (\"All evidence is\r\nmeant to be prejudicial; it is only unfair prejudice [that] must be [scrutinized under\r\nRule 403].\"); id. (\"Unfair prejudice does not mean the damage to a defendant's case\r\nthat results from the legitimate probative force of the evidence; rather it refers to\r\nevidence [that] tends to suggest decision on an improper basis.\").\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting exhibits\r\nthirteen through fifteen. Exhibit thirteen was a picture of scrapes on the victim's\r\nknees, and exhibits fourteen and fifteen were pictures of cuts on the victim's hands.\r\nThese pictures also were probative to malice. Exhibits thirteen through fifteen\r\nwere taken after the pathologist removed most of the blood from the victim's body.\r\nFurther, because they are pictures of specific injuries, they are not as emotionally\r\njarring as exhibits ten through twelve. These pictures do not \"have an undue\r\ntendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis\"; thus, the danger of unfair\r\n\nprejudice caused by exhibits thirteen through fifteen is minimal. See id.\r\n(\"Photographs pose a danger of unfair prejudice when they have an undue\r\ntendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not\r\nnecessarily, an emotional one.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\r\nAccordingly, the probative value of exhibits thirteen through fifteen was not\r\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\r\n\r\nBecause the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting exhibits ten through\r\nfifteen, Gathers's conviction is affirmed.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.1\r\n\r\nHUFF, GEATHERS,2 and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2   Judge Geathers has no relation to Appellant.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-463","title":"State v.

(St. Clements)\r\nappeals the Master-in-Equity's order, in which the Master denied St. Clements'\r\n\nclaim for an injunction and ordered that Respondent BE-MI, Inc. (BE-MI) had the\r\nright to retain and maintain a certain side deck. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\"An action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is in equity.\" S.C. Dep't\r\nof Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302\r\n(2001). \"On appeal from an equitable action, an appellate court may find facts in\r\naccordance with its own view of the evidence.\" Buffington v. T.O.E. Enters., 383\r\nS.C. 388, 391, 680 S.E.2d 289, 290 (2009). \"While this standard permits a broad\r\nscope of review, an appellate court will not disregard the findings of the trial court,\r\nwhich saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their\r\ncredibility.\" Id. \"A court does not automatically issue a mandatory injunction\r\nonce it finds a restrictive covenant has been violated.\" Sea Pines Plantation Co. v.\r\nWells, 294 S.C. 266, 274, 363 S.E.2d 891, 896 (1987) (citing Hunnicutt v.\r\nRickenbaker, 268 S.C. 511, 515-16, 234 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1977)). \"The court must\r\nbalance the equities between the parties; and if the harm to the defendant\r\noutweighs the plaintiff's benefit, no relief will be granted.\" Sea Pines, 294 S.C. at\r\n274, 363 S.E.2d at 896. \"Although the issuance of a mandatory injunction depends\r\nupon the equities between the parties, the decision of whether to issue such relief\r\nrests in the court's discretion.\" Id. The evidence presented at trial shows an\r\ninjunction seeking removal of the side deck would cause considerable harm. BE-\r\nMI has constructed, maintained, and improved the side deck at BE-MI's own\r\nexpense. The side deck constitutes a substantial part of BE-MI's business and\r\nrelieves congestion by the pool and pool bar, allows patrons a place to sit and eat,\r\nand provides shade. In contrast, St. Clements asserts an injunction would remedy\r\nthe loss of two parking spots; however, the record is unclear on the necessity of\r\nthose two spots. For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Master is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-467","title":"State v.

On appeal, Izzard\r\nargues the circuit court erred by: (1) relying on a prior action when no such action\r\nexisted; (2) determining there were no genuine issues of material fact and entering\r\n\njudgment as a matter of law; (3) applying the doctrine of res judicata; (4) applying\r\nthe doctrine of collateral estoppel; (5) finding there was no improper taking as a\r\nmatter of law; (6) determining as a matter of law the City properly asserted its\r\npolice power; (7) granting Respondents summary judgment on Izzard's negligence\r\nand gross negligence claims; (8) granting Respondents summary judgment on\r\nIzzard's procedural due process claim; (9) granting Respondents summary\r\njudgment on Izzard's conversion claim; and (10) determining Respondents' actions\r\nwere in concert with the International Building Code. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. Because we find there is no genuine issue of material fact that Izzard's property\r\nwas taken for public use, we need not reach whether the circuit court erred by\r\napplying the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel to bar Izzard's takings\r\nand police power claims. Therefore, the circuit court did not err by granting\r\nsummary judgment. See Rule 56(c), SCRCP (providing summary judgment is\r\nappropriate when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a\r\njudgment as a matter of law\"); Carolina Chloride, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Transp.,\r\n391 S.C. 429, 435, 706 S.E.2d 501, 504 (2011) (\"The elements of an action for an\r\ninverse condemnation are: (1) affirmative conduct of a government entity; (2) the\r\nconduct effects a taking; and (3) the taking is for a public use.\"); S.C. State\r\nHighway Dep't v. Wilson, 254 S.C. 360, 365, 175 S.E.2d 391, 394 (1970) (\"[J]ust\r\ncompensation is required in the case of the exercise of eminent domain but not for\r\nthe loss by the property owner which results from the constitutional exercise of the\r\npolice power.\"); Carolina Convenience Stores, Inc. v. City of Spartanburg, 398\r\nS.C. 27, 32, 727 S.E.2d 28, 30 (Ct. App. 2012) (\"A detriment to private property\r\nthat results from a legitimate exercise of police power does not constitute a taking\r\nof private property for public use.\").\r\n\r\n2. We find there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Izzard's due\r\nprocess rights were violated; therefore, the circuit court did not err by granting\r\nsummary judgment on Izzard's procedural due process claim. See Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP (providing summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings,\r\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\r\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\r\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law\"); Harbit v. City\r\nof Charleston, 382 S.C. 383, 394, 675 S.E.2d 776, 781-82 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n(affirming the circuit court's grant of summary judgment on the appellant's\r\n\nprocedural due process claim when the appellant \"received three levels of review,\r\nin each of which he was allowed to present his position\").\r\n\r\n3. We find no error in the circuit court granting summary judgment for\r\nRespondents on Izzard's negligence, gross negligence and conversion claims\r\nbecause Izzard's claims were barred by the statute of limitations. See Rule 220(c),\r\nSCACR (providing an appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing in the\r\nrecord); S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-110 (2005) (providing any action brought\r\npursuant to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act \"is forever barred unless an action\r\nis commenced within two years after the date the loss was or should have been\r\ndiscovered\"); Holmes v. Nat'l Serv. Indus., Inc., 395 S.C. 305, 309, 717 S.E.2d\r\n751, 753 (2011) (\"[T]he statute of limitations begins to run from the date the\r\nclaimant knew or should have known that, by the exercise of reasonable diligence,\r\na cause of action exists.\"); Snell v.

We find Izzard's remaining issues on appeal are unpreserved for appellate\r\nreview. See Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772, 779-80\r\n(2004) (noting an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court to be\r\npreserved for appellate review).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-480","title":"State v.

Denton and Dr. John May, doing business as\r\nEdusystems, appeal the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to Denmark\r\nTechnical College (the College) in their action against the College for terminating\r\ntheir consulting contract and refusing to pay the remainder of the contract. The\r\ncircuit court found the contract was not a valid sole source procurement and was\r\nnot approved by the Budget and Control Board as was required because it was over\r\n$50,000. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.      We affirm the circuit court's order granting summary judgment in favor of\r\nthe College. Denton and May claim the Consolidated Procurement Code divested\r\nthe circuit court of jurisdiction over contract disputes involving a state entity.\r\nHowever, we find the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction over the contract\r\ndispute. See S.C. Code Ann. § 15-77-50 (2005) (stating the \"circuit courts of this\r\nState are hereby vested with jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions,\r\nactions and controversies\"); Skinner v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 380 S.C. 91, 93,\r\n668 S.E.2d 795, 796 (2008) (defining subject matter jurisdiction as \"the power to\r\nhear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question\r\nbelong\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, Denton and May chose to\r\nfile this case in circuit court. Their argument on appeal that the forum they chose\r\ndoes not have jurisdiction to hear the case is not only incorrect, but if accepted\r\nwould necessarily result in the dismissal of the entire lawsuit. This case is\r\ndistinguishable from Unisys Corp. v. South Carolina Budget & Control Board\r\nDivision of General Services Information Technology Management Office, 346\r\nS.C. 158, 551 S.E.2d 263 (2001). In Unisys, the State invoked the remedy\r\nprovided in the Consolidated Procurement Code, 346 S.C. at 164, 551 S.E.2d at\r\n267, and because of that the supreme court held the circuit court did not have\r\njurisdiction to hear the same dispute over the same contract. Id. at 176-77, 551\r\nS.E.2d at 273. Here, neither party invoked the procedures in the Consolidated\r\nProcurement Code. Thus, Unisys does not control. Therefore, the circuit court had\r\nthe power to hear the case, and its jurisdiction was proper.\r\n\r\n2.     Additionally, Denton and May claim they should not have been required to\r\ncomply with the Consolidated Procurement Code. Instead, they argue the College,\r\nas the governmental entity, is responsible for compliance with the Code. However,\r\nwe find Denton and May were obligated to meet the terms of the Consolidated\r\nProcurement Code. See Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174,\r\n\n177-78, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992) (providing that the Procurement Code \"is\r\napplicable to every expenditure of funds by the state acting through a\r\ngovernmental body\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 11-35-310 (2011) (defining a\r\ngovernmental body to include state colleges, universities, and technical schools);\r\nAhrens v. State, 392 S.C. 340, 353, 709 S.E.2d 54, 60-61 (2011) (warning that \"[a]\r\npublic officer derives his authority from statutory enactment, and all persons are in\r\nlaw held to have notice of the extent of his powers, and therefore, as to matters not\r\nreally within the scope of his authority, they deal with the officer at their peril\"\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n\r\n3.     Furthermore, Denton and May claim on appeal there was a valid emergency\r\nprocurement under the Consolidated Procurement Code because the College was in\r\ndanger of missing its audit deadline. This is insufficient to justify the contract as\r\nan emergency procurement. See S.C. Code Ann. § 11-35-1570 (2011) (declaring\r\nemergency procurements are proper \"only when there exists an immediate threat to\r\npublic health, welfare, critical economy and efficiency, or safety under emergency\r\nconditions as defined in regulations promulgated by the board; and provided, that\r\nsuch emergency procurements shall be made with as much competition as is\r\npracticable under the circumstances\"). Moreover, the issue is not properly\r\npreserved for review by this court. See Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 564,\r\n633 S.E.2d 505, 510 (2006) (maintaining \"[i]t is well settled that an issue cannot be\r\nraised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by\r\nthe trial court to be preserved\"); Bochette v. Bochette, 300 S.C. 109, 112, 386\r\nS.E.2d 475, 477 (Ct. App. 1989) (stating \"[a]n appellant may not use either oral\r\nargument or the reply brief as a vehicle to argue issues not argued in the appellant's\r\nbrief\").\r\n\r\n4.     Finally, summary judgment was properly granted in this case. See Sloan v.\r\nDep't of Transp., 379 S.C. 160, 167, 666 S.E.2d 236, 239 (2008) (stating summary\r\njudgment is appropriate \"when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\r\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\"). We agree with the\r\ncircuit court that a verdict for Denton and May was not reasonably possible under\r\nthe facts presented.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court order granting summary judgment in favor of the\r\nCollege is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-486","title":"Black v.

We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the\r\nfollowing authorities:\r\n\r\n1.

Haynie, pro se, of Columbia.\r\n\r\n             Catharine H. Garbee Griffin, of Baker Ravenel &\r\n             Bender, LLP, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: F.M. Haynie d/b/a Docwild's General Contractor (Haynie)\r\nappeals the master-in-equity's order, arguing the master erred by (1) finding the\r\ncontract was a sum certain contract, (2) denying damages to Haynie under the\r\n\ntheory of quantum meruit, (3) awarding damages to Paul Cash and Carole Cash\r\n(the Cashes), and (4) adopting the Cashes' proposed order. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. The master did not err in concluding the parties' contract was for a sum certain.\r\nThe March 2, 2007 letter from Haynie to the Cashes served as an offer, and the\r\nparties made counteroffers through oral negotiations. The master found the parties\r\neventually orally agreed the cost of the shed would be for a sum certain of $35,000\r\nwith the cost of the windows and doors to be added once those items were selected.\r\nSee Gaskins v. Firemen's Ins. Co. of Newark, N.J., 206 S.C. 213, 216, 33 S.E.2d\r\n498, 499 (1945) (noting that if there is a meeting of the minds with regard to the\r\nessential elements of a contract, it is immaterial whether the contract is written or\r\noral). The master's finding is supported by evidence of the parties' intent. See U.S.\r\nBank Trust Nat'l Ass'n v. Bell, 385 S.C. 364, 374, 684 S.E.2d 199, 204-05 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2009) (\"When interpreting an oral contract, a court must give effect to the\r\nintentions of the parties. The determination of the parties' intent is a question of\r\nfact.\" (citations omitted)). Haynie's ledger, spreadsheets, and internal documents\r\nreference a contract price of $35,000, and Cash noted the cost of the project was\r\n$35,000 in his ledger. During the course of building the shed, the parties orally\r\nagreed to changes and upgrades to the initial scope of work. See Roberts v.\r\nGaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. App. 1997) (\"A contract is\r\nan obligation which arises from [an] actual agreement of the parties manifested by\r\nwords, oral or written, or by conduct.\"). The parties agreed on the cost for each\r\nchange or upgrade, and the Cashes paid Haynie accordingly. Thus, based upon our\r\n\"any evidence\" standard of review, the master did not err by concluding the\r\ncontract was for a sum certain of $35,000, with subsequent oral modifications. See\r\nSherlock Holmes Pub, Inc. v. City of Columbia, 389 S.C. 77, 81, 697 S.E.2d 619,\r\n621 (Ct. App. 2010) (\"An action to construe a contract is an action at law\r\nreviewable under an any evidence standard.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\n\r\n2. The master did not err in denying damages to Haynie under the theory of\r\nquantum meruit. Because the master properly concluded the parties had an express\r\ncontract, Haynie cannot recover under quantum meruit. See Earthscapes\r\nUnlimited, Inc. v. Ulbrich, 390 S.C. 609, 616, 703 S.E.2d 221, 225 (2010)\r\n(\"Absent an express contract, recovery under quantum meruit is based on quasi-\r\ncontract.\"). Further, Haynie cannot establish a claim under quantum meruit\r\nbecause he failed to prove the Cashes unjustly retained a benefit without paying for\r\nit. See id. at 616-17, 703 S.E.2d at 225 (\"To establish a claim of quantum meruit,\r\nthe plaintiff must prove: (1) a benefit conferred upon the defendant by the plaintiff;\r\n(2) realization of that benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention by the defendant\r\nof the benefit under conditions that make it unjust for him to retain it without\r\n\npaying its value.\"). Haynie failed to provide an accurate estimate because he based\r\nhis opinion on the value of the shed on the erroneous premise that the shed was a\r\nresidential, conventional, or recreational dwelling. However, Haynie admitted the\r\nCashes cannot occupy the shed because it does not have a kitchen or full bath.\r\nThus, Haynie failed to meet his burden of proof to establish a claim for damages\r\nunder quantum meruit.\r\n\r\n3. The master did not err in awarding $4,135 in damages to the Cashes. The record\r\ncontains evidence Haynie failed to meet the proper standard of care when installing\r\nthe septic tank and the shingles to the shed. See Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 400,\r\n645 S.E.2d 245, 250 (2007) (\"To prove negligence, a plaintiff must show: (1)\r\ndefendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) defendant breached the duty by a\r\nnegligent act or omission; (3) defendant's breach was the actual and proximate\r\ncause of the plaintiff's injury; and (4) plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.\");\r\nSmith v. Breedlove, 377 S.C. 415, 422, 661 S.E.2d 67, 71 (2008) (\"A builder who\r\ncontracts to construct a dwelling impliedly warrants that the work undertaken will\r\nbe performed in a careful, diligent, workmanlike manner.\"). Mr. Cash testified he\r\npaid $1,975 to replace the septic tank in the shed because Haynie did not install it\r\naccording to code and it overflowed into the shed. Replacing the defective septic\r\ntank also damaged the Cashes' sprinkler system, which cost an additional $1,590 to\r\nrepair. Finally, Mr. Cash testified Haynie's improper installation of the shingles\r\ncaused the shed to rot from water pooling. The Cashes paid $585 to replace the\r\nshingles. Therefore, the master properly awarded $4,135 in damages to the\r\nCashes.\r\n\r\n4. Haynie argues the master erred in adopting the Cashes' proposed order. This\r\nissue is not preserved because Haynie raises it for the first time on appeal. See\r\nWilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"It is\r\naxiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have\r\nbeen raised to and ruled upon by the trial [court] to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview.\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.1\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-490","title":"State v.

Valenta, Jr., Linda Annette Grice, and Philip S.\r\n        Porter, all of the South Carolina Department of Motor\r\n        Vehicles, all of Blythewood, for Respondents.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: This appeal arises from the suspension of Mark Schnee's driver's\r\nlicense by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) as a result of Schnee's refusal\r\nto submit to a breath test as required under section 56-5-2950 of the South Carolina\r\nCode (Supp. 2012). The South Carolina Office of Motor Vehicle Hearings\r\n(OMVH) sustained the suspension and the Administrative Law Court (ALC)\r\naffirmed. On appeal, Schnee argues the ALC erred in upholding the OMVH's\r\ndetermination that: (1) Officer Ronald Fair was trained and certified by the South\r\nCarolina Criminal Justice Academy to administer breath tests; and (2) probable\r\ncause existed to arrest him for driving under the influence (DUI). We affirm\r\npursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1. As to whether the ALC erred in affirming the OMVH finding that Officer Fair\r\nwas trained and certified by the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy to\r\nadminister breath tests: Kearse v. State Health & Human Servs. Fin. Comm'n, 318\r\nS.C. 198, 200, 456 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1995) (holding the findings of an\r\nadministrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if\r\nunsupported by substantial evidence); State v. Jansen, 305 S.C. 320, 322-23, 408\r\nS.E.2d 235, 237 (1991) (holding testing precautions \"do not apply to the offer and\r\nrefusal of a breathalyzer test\" and a defendant may not question the validity of test\r\nmethods when \"no test was given, and there were no results offered as evidence by\r\nthe State\"); Ex parte Horne, 303 S.C. 30, 32, 397 S.E.2d 788, 789 (Ct.

Appellants\r\nargue the Master erred in the following: (1) failing to find the delinquent tax\r\ncollector for Charleston County did not exercise due diligence when certified\r\nmailings were returned unsigned; (2) interjecting issues that were neither pled nor\r\nraised by the parties; (3) finding Appellants' predecessor-in-interest committed\r\nfraud upon her creditors, had unclean hands, and was judicially estopped from her\r\nassertions based on a bankruptcy proceeding; and (4) imputing the predecessor-in-\r\ninterest's purported fraud to Appellants.
