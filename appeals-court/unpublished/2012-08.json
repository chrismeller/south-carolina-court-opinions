Clenton Campbell, of Walterboro, for Guardian ad\r\n              Litem.\r\n\r\n\r\n       PER CURIAM: Sherri L. Tahaei (f.k.a. Sherri L. Smith) (Sherri), pro\r\nse, appeals the family court's final order finding she failed to establish the\r\nexistence of a common-law marriage. She argues the family court erred in:\r\n(1) finding no common-law marriage existed; (2) failing to enforce multiple\r\norders requiring Seyed D. Tahaei (Seyed) to produce immigration and\r\nfinancial documents; and (3) failing to grant her motion for a continuance\r\nafter Seyed failed to timely provide discovery documents. We affirm in part\r\nand reverse in part.1\r\n\r\n      \"The family court is a court of equity.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381,\r\n386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011). In appeals from the family court, the\r\nappellate court reviews factual and legal issues de novo. Simmons v.\r\nSimmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011). \"De novo review\r\npermits appellate court fact-finding, notwithstanding the presence of evidence\r\nsupporting the [family] court's findings.\" Lewis, 392 S.C. at 390, 709 S.E.2d\r\nat 654-55. However, this broad standard of review does not require the\r\nappellate court to disregard the factual findings of the family court or ignore\r\nthe fact that the family court is in the better position to assess the credibility\r\nof the witnesses. Pinckney v. Warren, 344 S.C. 382, 387, 544 S.E.2d 620,\r\n623 (2001). Moreover, the appellant is not relieved of the burden of\r\ndemonstrating error in the family court's findings of fact. Id. at 387-88, 544\r\nS.E.2d at 623.\r\n\r\nI.      Common-Law Marriage\r\n\r\n     Sherri argues the family court erred in finding she failed to meet her\r\nburden of proof because she provided sufficient evidence to prove a\r\ncommon-law marriage existed. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\n      \"Whether a common-law marriage exists is a question of law.\" Callen\r\nv. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, 623, 620 S.E.2d 59, 62 (2005). \"The proponent of\r\nthe alleged marriage has the burden of proving the elements by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence.\" Id. \"A common-law marriage is formed\r\nwhen two parties contract to be married.\" Id. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62. \"No\r\nexpress contract is necessary; the agreement may be inferred from the\r\ncircumstances.\" Id. \"The fact finder is to look for mutual assent: the intent\r\nof each party to be married to the other and a mutual understanding of each\r\nparty's intent. Consideration is the participation in the marriage. If these\r\nfactual elements are present, then the court should find as a matter of law that\r\na common-law marriage exists.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      \"Further, when the proponent proves that the parties participated in\r\napparently matrimonial cohabitation, and that while cohabiting the parties\r\nhad a reputation in the community as being married, a rebuttable presumption\r\narises that a common-law marriage was created.\" Id. (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted). \"This presumption may be overcome by strong, cogent\r\nevidence that the parties in fact never agreed to marry.\" Id. (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\n       We find the family court erred as a matter of law because Sherri\r\nprovided ample evidence to support her contention she and Seyed were\r\ncommon-law married. First, the family court erred in finding Seyed never\r\nlisted Sherri as his wife \"on any documentation.\" Multiple documents in the\r\nrecord indicate a common-law marriage existed. For example: (1) checks\r\nfrom a joint bank account in the name of \"D.S. Tahaei\" and \"S.L. Smith-\r\nTahaei\"; (2) an insurance card signed by Seyed listing \"Sherri L. Smith-\r\nTahae[i]\" as an insured; (3) two newspaper articles announcing the birth of\r\ntheir second child and identifying the couple as \"David and Sherri Tahaei\";\r\n(4) a country club membership application signed by Seyed listing \"Sherri\r\nTahaei\" as \"spouse\"; and (5) a health insurance policy questionnaire signed\r\nby Seyed indicating he has \"a common-law marriage\" and listing \"Sherri L.\r\nSmith-Tahaei\" as his wife. Additionally, Sherri testified she and Seyed\r\ncohabitated for approximately eight years. Moreover, Sherri's next door\r\nneighbor testified Seyed introduced Sherri as his wife and that she believed\r\nSherri and Seyed were living together as husband and wife. Finally, Sherri's\r\n\ndaughter from an earlier relationship testified Seyed raised her as his step-\r\ndaughter and explained she called him \"Daddy David.\"\r\n\r\n     We find Sherri proved by a preponderance of the evidence she and\r\nSeyed agreed to live as husband and wife. See id. at 624, 620 S.E.2d at 62.\r\n\r\n      Seyed provided very little in the way of rebuttal evidence. He disputed\r\nthe validity of the documents Sherri entered and testified he moved out for a\r\nperiod of time during the cohabitation. Seyed's testimony was not strong,\r\ncogent evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption the couple agreed to\r\nmarry. See id.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, we reverse the family court's finding that Sherri failed to\r\nestablish the existence of a common-law marriage.\r\n\r\nII.   Remaining Issues\r\n\r\n      With regard to Sherri's remaining issues on appeal, we affirm pursuant\r\nto Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n      1.    As to whether the family court erred in failing to enforce multiple\r\norders requiring Seyed to produce immigration and financial documents to\r\nSherri: Halverson v. Yawn, 328 S.C. 618, 621, 493 S.E.2d 883, 884 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1997) (holding a trial court's exercise of its discretionary powers with\r\nrespect to sanctions imposed in discovery matters will not be disturbed on\r\nappeal absent a clear abuse of discretion).\r\n\r\n      2.     As to whether the family court erred in denying Sherri's motion\r\nfor a continuance: Moore v. Moore, 376 S.C. 467, 482, 657 S.E.2d 743, 751\r\n(2008) (holding the grant or denial of a continuance is within the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial court and is reviewable on appeal only when an abuse\r\nof discretion appears in the record).\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\n      WILLIAMS, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-465","title":"State v.

Seaton, IV, of Grover Seaton Law Firm, LLC,\r\n        of Moncks Corner, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Jennifer Bowling (Wife) appeals the family court's order (1)\r\nfinding her in direct criminal contempt and (2) imposing a conditional sentence.\r\nWe reverse.\r\n\r\nDirect contempt is conduct in the presence of the court that willfully interferes with\r\njudicial proceedings, exhibits disrespect for the court, or hampers the parties or\r\nwitnesses. State v. Brandt, 393 S.C. 526, 540-41, 713 S.E.2d 591, 598 (2011).\r\n\"Perjury or false swearing may constitute contempt of court.\" State v. Stanley, 365\r\nS.C. 24, 35, 615 S.E.2d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Crute v. Crute, 70 S.E.2d\r\n727, 728 (Ga. App. 1952)). However, the purpose for exercising the contempt\r\npower should be used sparingly and be based upon the need to preserve order in\r\njudicial proceedings, enforce judgments, orders and writs, and ensure \"the due\r\nadministration of justice.\" State ex rel. McLeod v. Hite, 272 S.C. 303, 305, 251\r\nS.E.2d 746, 747 (1979).\r\n\r\nHere, the family court's contempt finding was made after trial concluded, and the\r\nneed to ensure courtroom decorum and authority by exercising the contempt power\r\nis reduced when the contemptuous conduct is not addressed until after trial\r\nconcludes. Cf. Codispoti v. Penn., 418 U.S. 506, 515 (1974) (noting that when the\r\ntrial court postpones until after the verdict the conviction for contemptuous acts\r\nduring trial, \"there is no overriding necessity for instant action to preserve order\").\r\nMore importantly, the family court's contempt finding focused exclusively on\r\nwhether Wife's testimony was truthful, and its own explanation belies any assertion\r\nthat the contempt power was exercised to preserve order in the trial or ensure\r\nWife's subsequent compliance with a prior order. In fact, the family court's\r\nexpressed purpose for imposing the conviction was \"a matter of word getting out\"\r\nto people not involved in the litigation at all. Under the circumstances of this case,\r\nwe believe the family court abused its discretion.\r\n\r\nBecause we reverse Wife's contempt conviction, we need not consider her\r\nremaining issue. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C.\r\n598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling the court need not review remaining\r\nissues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-468","title":"Latimer v.

FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n       Thelathia Morris (Decedent) died intestate on March 11, 2003. Her\r\nmother, Mattie Morris (PR), was appointed as personal representative of her\r\nestate. On April 8, 2003, Latimer, who had cohabitated with Decedent, sent a\r\nletter to Morris Transportation2 resigning. He further provided a list of\r\npersonal belongings he wanted returned and their values3 and a list of bills he\r\nwanted paid. In addition, the following day he signed a document stating he\r\nwished to retrieve two coin collections he owned, located at Decedent's last\r\nresidence. On April 10, 2003, he sent two additional letters to Morris\r\nTransportation requesting four pagers and a pressure washer be returned and\r\nrequesting rent and payment for those. On April 28, 2003, Latimer filed a\r\nclaim of $13,812.74 against the estate. On June 12, 2003, he filed an\r\namended creditor's claim referencing the original claim and stating the claim\r\nwas for $9,900.\r\n\r\n      On June 17, 2003, Latimer filed an affidavit for claim and delivery\r\n(Magistrate Claim) in the magistrate's court against PR and Morris\r\nTransportation4 for property amounting to $6,990.81. An attachment listed\r\nthe same property as the list related to the probate matter. On June 27, 2003,\r\nPR denied $10,000 of Latimer's $13,812.74 claim. On July 18, 2003,\r\nLatimer filed a petition for allowance of claim in the probate court for\r\n$10,141.26, seeking attorney's fees; filing costs, including that for the\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\n\r\n2 Presumably, PR was an owner of Morris Transportation although this is not \n\r\nclear in the record or brief. \n\r\n3 It is difficult to tell from the record whether the list of personal items was \n\r\nsubmitted with the letter sent to Morris Transportation, the claim \n\r\nsubsequently filed with the probate court, or neither.\n\r\n4 Latimer also named Matthew Rice as a defendant but the record and brief \n\r\ndo not indicate who he is.\n\r\n\nMagistrate Claim; $8,848.68 for CitiFinancial; and three charges for\r\ntransmission fluid. The magistrate's court held a claim and delivery hearing\r\non July 29, 2003. The record contains a handwritten note from the magistrate\r\nstating the parties had reached an agreement that the case would be decided\r\nin the Anderson County probate court and that agreement was placed on the\r\nrecord.On July 6, 2005, Judge Carole Dennison of the Anderson County\r\nprobate court issued an order from a May 25, 2005 probate court hearing.\r\nThe court found the Magistrate Claim did not comply with section 62-3-806\r\nof the South Carolina Code and thus should not be considered by the\r\nAnderson County probate court. The court additionally found PR allowed\r\n$3,812.74 from the first claim and \"never properly disallowed\" the second\r\nclaim for $9,900, entitling Latimer to a total of $13,712.74. On July 15,\r\n2005, Latimer filed a motion to reconsider with Judge Dennison. He\r\ncontended that to the extent he allegedly did not comply with all applicable\r\nrules of procedure for filing a civil action against an estate, the parties agreed\r\nthe Anderson County probate court would hear the matter originally\r\npresented before the magistrate and that agreement implicitly cured any\r\nalleged defects in the filing of the Magistrate Claim. Judge Dennison wrote a\r\nletter in response to the motion stating she wished to set up a conference call\r\non the case for July 27, 2005. On August 31, 2005, Judge Dennison prepared\r\nanother letter, stating that since the conference call, she had determined she\r\nneeded an order to dispose of the motion. However, the court issued an order\r\non November 2, 2005, providing the court held a hearing on the motion via\r\nphone conference on September 17, 2005, and stating Latimer \"will file an\r\naction in Anderson County Probate Court which is identical to the one\r\n[Latimer] previously filed with\" the magistrate's court. The court stated,\r\n\"While the Court is not setting a time limit, it is anticipated that this filing\r\nwill be done in a reasonably prompt period of time. At the time of this filing,\r\nthe Court will then consider the matter as it deems appropriate.\"\r\n\r\n     On September 8, 2005, Latimer filed a complaint in the Anderson\r\nCounty probate court stating the Magistrate Claim had been transferred to the\r\nprobate court by the magistrate and was a separate action from that ruled\r\nupon by Judge Dennison at the May 25, 2005 hearing. On April 6, 2006,\r\nJudge Dennison issued an order finding the list of items from the Magistrate\r\n\nClaim was identical to the list attached to the probate court claim from April\r\n23, 2003, for which he was awarded $3,812.74. The court noted that the\r\nMagistrate Claim sought a smaller dollar amount ($6,990.81) than that which\r\nhe filed in probate court ($13,812.74), \"and thus, were the Court to entertain\r\nthe claim today, it would be forced to revisit its prior Order, which it will not\r\ndo, and potentially award him less on the claim than has already be[en]\r\nadjudicated.\" The court thus dismissed the petition, finding (1) the\r\nMagistrate Claim should have been a claim against the estate, (2) Latimer's\r\nclaims had already been ruled upon by the probate court, and (3) he was\r\nentitled to no further relief thereunder. On May 24, 2006, Latimer filed a\r\nmotion to the probate court pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, asking to be\r\nrelieved from the order, which stated in part \"the items which makes [sic] up\r\nMr. Latimer's claim in Magistrate's Court is identical to the list of items that\r\nis attached to the claim he filed in the Probate Court of April 23, 2003[,] and\r\nfor which he was awarded $3,812.74.\" He contended the Magistrate Claim\r\nwas for $6,900 in furniture while the original probate claim was for\r\n$13,812.74, of which $10,000 was disallowed by PR.\r\n\r\n      On June 8, 2006, the supreme court determined Judge Martha D.\r\nNewton, Anderson County Probate Judge, was disqualified from any further\r\nhearings on the matter and appointed Judge Sandra Burgess Orr, Oconee\r\nCounty Probate Judge, to sit in the matter. At a hearing on October 16, 2006,\r\nJudge Orr considered Latimer's motion for reconsideration as well as a\r\nmotion to expedite the closing of the estate and payment of claims. On\r\nNovember 30, 2006, Judge Orr issued an order requiring an inventory and\r\nappraisal be conducted by PR and holding all other matters in abeyance\r\npending another hearing. On April 24, 2007, Judge Orr conducted a hearing\r\non the motion for reconsideration. On September 26, 2007, Judge Orr issued\r\nan order denying the motion to reconsider, finding Judge Dennison's order\r\nwas correct because the Magistrate Claim covered the same issues that were\r\npreviously filed and subsequently ruled on in the probate court. Judge Orr\r\nalso found assuming arguendo the Magistrate Claim was not the same as an\r\nissue previously raised in probate court, the court would still have to dismiss\r\nthe claim because it was not filed in probate court. Judge Orr stated she was\r\naware of no code section that permitted a case to be transferred from the\r\nmagistrate's court to probate court.\r\n\n      Latimer appealed Judge Orr's decision to the circuit court, asserting the\r\njudge erred in finding (1) Latimer had already filed a claim for furniture in\r\nthe probate court and (2) a dispute between two parties in magistrate's court\r\ncould not be transferred to the probate court in which the estate had been\r\nadministered. At the hearing before the circuit court, PR's attorney stated that\r\nattached to Latimer's second claim in probate court was an itemized list of\r\npersonalty that was identical to the list submitted with the Magistrate Claim.\r\nHe further stated that at the third hearing before Judge Dennison, Judge\r\nDennison had her clerk review the microfilmed filing for the probate court\r\nclaim to see if the lists were the same and she verified they were. Latimer's\r\nattorney stated that as an officer of the court, he was in court during that\r\nproceeding and PR's attorney's rendition of what happened was correct, even\r\nthough his client claimed that is not what occurred. PR's attorney\r\nadditionally stated that Latimer never filed a new claim as Judge Dennison\r\nordered.\r\n\r\n      The circuit court found all claims were required to be served and filed\r\nby February 1, 2004, pursuant to section 62-3-806. The circuit court found\r\nJudge Dennison had her clerk verify on the record that the basis of the\r\nprobate claim for $9,900 was identical to the Magistrate Claim. The circuit\r\ncourt further noted that \"in an abundance of caution, Judge Den[n]ison\r\nordered from a hearing conducted on July 15, 2005[,] and by Order dated\r\nNovember 5, 2005[,] that ' . . . [Latimer] shall file a claim based upon his\r\nMagistrate's Court case, which is identical to the Magistrate's Court claim . . .\r\n.'\" (ellipses added by circuit court). The circuit court further noted Latimer\r\n\"never filed such claim, but instead, filed numerous other motions and\r\nchallenges to the previous Probate Court orders, all of which were addressed\r\nand denied as set forth hereinabove.\" The circuit court found Latimer's\r\nappeal as related to those filings with the Anderson County probate court was\r\nwithout merit and his probate claims were properly adjudicated and affirmed\r\nby both the Anderson County and Oconee County probate courts. The circuit\r\ncourt denied and dismissed Latimer's appeal and found he was entitled to the\r\njudgment of $13,712.74 as set forth in the Anderson County court records.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\n                        STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\r\n\r\n      Appeals from the probate court are governed by the provisions of the\r\nprobate code. Matter of Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 360, 434 S.E.2d 254,\r\n256 (1993). A final order or decree of the probate court may be appealed to\r\nthe circuit court. S.C. Code Ann. § 62-1-308(a) (2009). The circuit court\r\n\"must hear and determine the appeal according to the rules of law.\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 62-1-308(d) (2009). \"'[A]ccording to the rules of law' means\r\naccording to the rules governing appeals.\" Matter of Howard, 315 S.C. at\r\n360, 434 S.E.2d at 257. On appeal from the final order of the probate court,\r\nthe circuit court must apply the same standard of review an appellate court\r\nwould apply on appeal. In re Estate of Pallister, 363 S.C. 437, 447, 611\r\nS.E.2d 250, 256 (2005). Thus, the standard of review applicable to cases\r\noriginating in the probate court depends upon whether the underlying cause\r\nof action is at law or in equity. In re Estate of Holden, 343 S.C. 267, 278,\r\n539 S.E.2d 703, 709 (2000). \"Petitions to allow claims under [s]ection 62-3-\r\n806(b) are treated the same as any other proceeding for purposes of\r\nascertaining their legal or equitable nature. The proceeding in this case\r\ninvolves claims for money due. Ordinarily, such claims are triable at law with\r\nan attendant right to trial by jury.\" Matter of Howard, 315 S.C. at 362, 434\r\nS.E.2d at 258 (citations and footnote omitted). For a proceeding in the nature\r\nof an action at law, the circuit court and the appellate court may not disturb\r\nthe probate court's findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses no\r\nevidence supports them. Neely v. Thomasson, 365 S.C. 345, 349-50, 618\r\nS.E.2d 884, 886 (2005).      LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Filing Requirements\r\n\r\n       Latimer contends the circuit court erred in holding section 62-1-100 of\r\nthe South Carolina Code (2009) sets forth the filing requirements and time\r\nrestraints for the presentation of claims against any estate. We disagree.\r\n\r\n            The claimant may commence a proceeding against\r\n            the personal representative in any court where the\r\n            personal representative may be subjected to\r\n\n           jurisdiction, to obtain payment of his claim against\r\n           the estate, but the commencement of the proceeding\r\n           must occur within the time limited for presenting the\r\n           claim, and the claimant must file a written statement\r\n           of the claim as in (1) above, with the clerk of the\r\n           probate court. No presentation of claim is required in\r\n           regard to matters claimed in proceedings against the\r\n           decedent which were pending at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 62-3-804(2) (2009).\r\n\r\n                 (a) As to claims presented in the manner\r\n           described in [s]ection 62-3-804 [of the South\r\n           Carolina Code (2009)] within the time limit\r\n           prescribed in [s]ection 62-3-803 [of the South\r\n           Carolina Code (2009)], the personal representative\r\n           may mail a notice to any claimant stating that the\r\n           claim has been disallowed. If, after allowing or\r\n           disallowing a claim, the personal representative\r\n           changes his decision concerning the claim, he shall\r\n           notify the claimant. The personal representative may\r\n           not change a disallowance of a claim after the time\r\n           for the claimant to file a petition for allowance or to\r\n           commence a proceeding on the claim has run and the\r\n           claim has been barred. Every claim which is\r\n           disallowed in whole or in part by the personal\r\n           representative is barred so far as not allowed unless\r\n           the claimant files a petition for allowance in the court\r\n           or commences a proceeding against the personal\r\n           representative not later than thirty days after the\r\n           mailing of the notice of disallowance or partial\r\n           allowance if the notice warns the claimant of the\r\n           impending bar. It is the responsibility of the personal\r\n           representative to notify the claimant if a claim is\r\n           disallowed.\r\n\n                  (b) Upon service of the summons and petition\r\n            of the personal representative or of a claimant in a\r\n            proceeding for the purpose, the court may allow in\r\n            whole or in part any claim or claims presented to the\r\n            personal representative or filed with the court in due\r\n            time and not barred by subsection (a) of this section.\r\n            Notice of hearing in this proceeding shall be given to\r\n            the claimant, the personal representative, and those\r\n            other persons interested in the estate as the court may\r\n            direct by order entered at the time the proceeding is\r\n            commenced.\r\n\r\n                  (c) A judgment in a proceeding in another court\r\n            against a personal representative to enforce a claim\r\n            against a decedent's estate is an allowance of the\r\n            claim.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code § 62-3-806 (2009 & Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\n      Section 62-3-806(b) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011)\r\nauthorizes a decedent's personal representative or a claimant against a\r\ndecedent's estate to petition the probate court for the allowance or\r\ndisallowance of claims filed against the decedent's estate pursuant to section\r\n62-3-804. Matter of Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 359 n.1, 434 S.E.2d 254, 256 n.1\r\n(1993).\r\n\r\n      The circuit court actually stated \"section 62-1-100 et seq.\" applies,\r\nmeaning the entire probate code. Section 62-1-100 merely lays out when the\r\nprobate code began to take effect, which is not an issue in this case.\r\nAlthough section 62-3-804(2) does provide a claimant \"may commence a\r\nproceeding against the personal representative in any court where the\r\npersonal representative may be subjected to jurisdiction,\" it further states\r\n\"and the claimant must file a written statement of the claim . . . with the clerk\r\nof the probate court.\" Nothing in the record indicates Latimer filed a written\r\nstatement with the probate court for the Magistrate Claim. Accordingly, if\r\nthe Magistrate Claim was not for the same items as his filing with the probate\r\ncourt, he did not comply with section 62-3-804(2) because he did not file a\r\n\nwritten statement of the claim with the probate court. Further, the record\r\ncontains some evidence to support the probate court's finding that the items\r\nrequested in the Magistrate Claim had been requested in the claim against the\r\nestate; Latimer's attorney agreed with PR's attorney that Judge Dennison's\r\nclerk had verified the lists were the same, and in the record, the page after the\r\ncreditor's claim contains a list identical to the Magistrate Claim list.\r\nTherefore, the circuit court did not err in affirming the probate court.\r\n\r\nII.   Transfer of Magistrate Claim\r\n\r\n       Latimer argues the circuit court erred in holding it had been verified\r\nthat the second claim filed by the claimant was identical to the claim in the\r\namount of $9,900 filed with the Pendleton magistrate. Latimer does not\r\nargue this in the body of this argument, only in his issue statement. \"An issue\r\nraised on appeal but not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and will not\r\nbe considered by the appellate court.\" Fields v. Melrose Ltd. P'ship, 312 S.C.\r\n102, 106, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 (Ct. App. 1993). Therefore, this argument is\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\n      Latimer contends in the body of his brief the magistrate's ruling was not\r\nactually filed in or transferred to the probate court. He asserts it was error to\r\nhold the Magistrate Claim was ruled on by the probate court because the\r\nprobate court never had jurisdiction over it, as the case was not transferred to\r\nit. The circuit court did not rule on this argument. Additionally, the record\r\ncontains no Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion on the argument. \"[B]ut for a very\r\nfew exceptional circumstances, an appellate court cannot address an issue\r\nunless it was raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.\" Lucas v. Rawl\r\nFamily Ltd. P'ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004).\r\nAccordingly, this argument is unpreserved for our review.\r\n\r\nIII. Refiling of Magistrate Claim\r\n\r\n       Latimer maintains the circuit court erred in finding Latimer never filed\r\na claim as ordered by Judge Dennison at the hearing on July 15, 2005, and\r\nthe order dated November 5, 2005. We need not rule on this issue because\r\nthe first issue was dispositive as this was not the circuit court's only basis for\r\naffirming the probate court, as discussed above. See Futch v. McAllister\r\n\nTowing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n(finding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its\r\ndetermination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal); Dwyer v. Tom\r\nJenkins Realty, Inc., 289 S.C. 118, 120, 344 S.E.2d 886, 888 (Ct. App. 1986)\r\n(noting \"'[w]here a decision is based on two grounds, either of which,\r\nindependent of the other, is sufficient to support it, it will not be reversed on\r\nappeal because one of those grounds is erroneous'\" (quoting 5 Am. Jur. 2d\r\nAppeal and Error § 727 at 171 (1962)) (alteration by court)).\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      The record contains evidence to support the probate court's findings\r\nthat the items requested in the Magistrate Claim had been requested in the\r\nclaim filed against the estate. Accordingly, the circuit court is\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n      PIEPER, KONDUROS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-474","title":"State v.

All three petitions alleged Respondent\r\nPalmetto Health Alliance f/k/a Richland Memorial Hospital (the Hospital) was in\r\ncontempt of a 2001 confidential consent order of settlement (the Consent Order)\r\nand a 2003 supplemental order (the Supplemental Order) (collectively \"the\r\nSettlement Orders\"). Dr. Shah argues the trial court erred by finding the Hospital\r\ndid not willfully violate the terms of the Settlement Orders. We affirm.1\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nDr. Shah is a board certified vascular and interventional radiologist who formerly\r\nworked at the Hospital. In December 1995, the Hospital claimed Dr. Shah had\r\nmishandled the diagnosis of six patients. After a hearing, the allegations against\r\nDr. Shah were found to be untrue. The following month, the Hospital excluded Dr.\r\nShah from the duty rotation schedule. Dr. Shah then commenced an action against\r\nthe Hospital by filing a complaint on January 19, 1996, alleging the Hospital had\r\nengaged in a malicious and conspiratorial peer review and denied him his right to\r\npractice (the 1996 Action). On the day of trial, the parties reached a settlement\r\nagreement and the trial court subsequently entered the 2001 Consent Order, which\r\nmemorialized the parties' confidential settlement agreement.\r\n\r\nThe Consent Order (1) provided a monetary award to Dr. Shah; (2) required that\r\nfuture Quality Assurance (QA) reviews of Dr. Shah's medical cases would be\r\nremoved from the responsibility of radiologists who were associated with the\r\nHospital; (3) enabled either party to bring a dispute regarding the QA review or the\r\nduty rotation aspects of the settlement before the court \"in the form of a Petition for\r\na Rule to Show Cause\"; and (4) dismissed the 1996 Action with prejudice. In\r\nessence, the Consent Order removed Dr. Shah from the \"normal and traditional\"\r\nQA process conducted by other radiologists within the Hospital's Radiology\r\nDepartment and established a process whereby an outside, board-certified\r\nradiologist would review Dr. Shah's medical cases instead. Upon the selection of\r\nan outside reviewer, the reviewer was to have oversight of the selection process\r\nand review of Dr. Shah's cases. The Consent Order only addressed the\r\n\r\n1The Hospital filed a motion to supplement the record two days before oral\r\narguments were scheduled. At oral arguments, without objection, the motion was\r\ngranted.\r\n\nintradepartmental QA process and it expressly provided that Dr. Shah would\r\ncontinue to be bound by the Hospital's Bylaws.\r\n\r\nFollowing the issuance of the Consent Order, the parties were unable to mutually\r\nagree upon an outside reviewer. Consequently, the Hospital filed a petition for rule\r\nto show cause asking the court to clarify matters addressed in the Consent Order,\r\nspecify those matters covered by Dr. Shah's QA review process, and clarify the\r\nprocedures for addressing issues not related to Dr. Shah's extra-departmental QA\r\nreview process.2 After a hearing on the petition, the trial court issued the\r\nSupplemental Order, which provided more explicit instructions regarding the\r\nselection and role of the outside reviewer.\r\n\r\nThe Supplemental Order first indicated that the purpose of the unique QA process\r\napproved for Dr. Shah's cases was \"to provide an independent and impartial QA\r\nreview of Dr. Shah's cases that would not involve the other radiologists within the\r\nHospital's Department of Radiology who have been litigants in this case.\" The\r\nSupplemental Order then noted that \"[t]he stated goal of the Consent Order is to\r\nremove the [Radiology] Department and the Chief of the Department from\r\ninvolvement in the QA process to ensure fairness, impartiality, and to remove any\r\nclaim of bias.\" After recognizing that the 2001 Consent Order did not address\r\nalleged violations of Administrative Requirements, the Supplemental Order noted\r\nthat \"[d]uring the hearing, Dr. Shah [had] stated his willingness to have alleged\r\nviolations of noncompliance with Administrative Requirements handled by the\r\nChief [of the Radiology Department].\" Therefore, the Supplemental Order\r\nprovided that the Chief of the Radiology Department would be responsible for\r\nhandling issues related to Dr. Shah's compliance with Administrative\r\nRequirements, i.e., those matters outside the scope of departmental QA addressed\r\nby the Consent Order. The Supplemental Order granted the Chief of the Radiology\r\nDepartment discretion to refer matters to the Chief of Medical Staff or the Medical\r\nExecutive Committee (MEC).\r\n\r\nThe Supplemental Order also addressed the process for handling Dr. Shah's \"QA\r\nprocess or a complaint against Dr. Shah [that] involves an allegation that Dr. Shah\r\n\r\n2 The court referred to these other matters cumulatively as \"Administrative\r\nRequirements,\" although these matters encompassed much more, including: state\r\nand federal regulations; the Hospital's Directives, Bylaws, and Policies; and\r\nlicensing criteria. All of these items govern every physician affiliated with the\r\nHospital.\r\n\ndeviated from the standard of care in treating a patient . . . .\" The court specified\r\nthat \"every effort should be made to make the review as similar as possible to the\r\ncustomary and prevailing procedure followed for any other person on the Medical\r\nStaff.\" As a matter of course, the outside reviewer was to review Dr. Shah's cases\r\nand issue a \"decision\" regarding his work. The outside reviewer was to then notify\r\nthe MEC, the Hospital's chief of staff, and Dr. Shah of his or her decision within\r\nthirty days. The Supplemental Order provided that \"[u]pon receipt of the Decision,\r\nthe MEC shall determine what action, if any, should be taken . . . .\" The trial court\r\nconcluded the Supplemental Order by stating:\r\n\r\n             Nothing in this Order or in the original Consent Order\r\n             precludes the initiation of any administrative action\r\n             provided under the Bylaws or Policies, or limits the\r\n             Board of Directors of the Palmetto Health Alliance or\r\n             Hospital management to take such administrative action\r\n             as they deem necessary for the proper administration and\r\n             management of the Palmetto Health Alliance and/or\r\n             Hospital and to assure quality patient care is provided.\r\n\r\nDr. Shah filed a motion to alter or amend the Supplemental Order, but the trial\r\ncourt denied the motion, stating: \"The solution of this dispute has to be made to fit\r\nwithin an overlay of federal, state, and local laws and regulations; requirements to\r\nmeet medical and hospital standards; recognition of patient rights and the public\r\ninterest; and, strict rules of confidentiality.\" Ultimately, the Hospital and Dr. Shah\r\nmutually agreed upon Dr. Bayne Selby, a radiologist with the Medical University\r\nof South Carolina, to serve as the outside reviewer. Throughout the following\r\nyear, Dr. Selby reviewed Dr. Shah's cases and rendered reports as required by the\r\nSettlement Orders.\r\n\r\nShortly after receiving Dr. Selby's fourth report, the MEC initiated a \"corrective\r\naction\" against Dr. Shah. On April 5, 2004, the MEC decided to place Dr. Shah on\r\na ninety-day probation, which the MEC subsequently extended to six months. Dr.\r\nShah appealed. After a lengthy hearing, the Hospital's Fair Hearing Committee\r\n(FHC) issued a report of its findings and recommendations to the MEC. In this\r\nreport, the FHC expressed its opinion that a random audit of invasive procedures\r\nperformed by Dr. Shah from that point forward would provide a better\r\nmeasurement of Dr. Shah's competence than would a retrospective review of past\r\ncases. Therefore, the FHC recommended the MEC place Dr. Shah on probation\r\nuntil September 5, 2005, to allow the Hospital to conduct such an audit. The FHC\r\n\nalso recommended that the MEC require Dr. Shah to successfully complete several\r\nrequirements as conditions of his probation. Dr. Shah appealed to the Hospital's\r\nBoard of Directors, but the Board upheld the decision.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the FHC report, Dr. Selby began reviewing a number of Dr.\r\nShah's recent cases involving invasive procedures. During this time, Dr. Shah filed\r\na petition for rule to show cause and a memorandum in support of the petition,\r\nalleging the Hospital was in contempt of the Settlement Orders. However, the\r\ncourt never held a hearing or ruled on Dr. Shah's petition. Dr. Selby's review\r\nresulted in three more reports. On October 31, 2005, the MEC met to discuss Dr.\r\nSelby's reports and whether Dr. Shah had satisfied all of the terms of his probation.\r\nThe MEC ultimately determined Dr. Shah had not satisfactorily met the\r\nrequirements as outlined in his probation. Therefore, the members of the MEC\r\nconcluded the meeting by unanimously voting to suspend Dr. Shah's hospital\r\nprivileges and to recommend the Hospital revoke such privileges.\r\n\r\nOn December 13, 2005, the FHC commenced a termination hearing. The purpose\r\nof the hearing was to hear Dr. Shah's challenge to the MEC's decision to suspend\r\nhis hospital privileges and its recommendation that the Hospital permanently\r\nrevoke such privileges. The hearing lasted three days, during which Dr. Shah\r\ncalled eighteen witnesses to testify on his behalf. After the hearing concluded, but\r\nprior to the FHC rendering its decision, Dr. Shah filed an amended petition for rule\r\nto show cause and a memorandum in support of the amended petition, alleging the\r\nHospital's failure to comply with the terms of the Settlement Orders and Bylaws.\r\nShortly thereafter, on December 30, 2005, the FHC issued its report upholding the\r\nMEC's decision to terminate Dr. Shah. The FHC based its decision on its findings\r\nthat Dr. Shah (1) failed to satisfy the terms of his probation; (2) continued to suffer\r\ndeficiencies in his clinical competence; and (3) failed to adhere to the Hospital's\r\nadministrative policies and procedures.\r\n\r\nOn March 14, 2006, Dr. Shah appeared before the Hospital's Board of Directors to\r\nappeal his termination. However, the Board sent Dr. Shah a letter the following\r\nmonth stating its decision to affirm his termination. Shortly thereafter, on April\r\n13, 2006, Dr. Shah filed a third petition for rule to show cause and memorandum in\r\nsupport, again alleging the Hospital's repeated failure to comply with the\r\nSettlement Orders. As with the prior petitions, for some unknown reason the trial\r\ncourt never scheduled a hearing on the matter. Therefore, Dr. Shah commenced a\r\nnew lawsuit against the Hospital by filing a complaint on July 12, 2006, asserting\r\n\ncauses of action for civil compensatory contempt, breach of the Settlement Orders,\r\nand breach of the Hospital's Bylaws (the 2006 Action).\r\n\r\nAfter the parties had commenced discovery in preparation for the 2006 Action, the\r\ntrial court issued an order granting the parties' request to assign the 2006 Action\r\nand the pending petitions for rule to show cause to the Honorable Doyet A. Early,\r\nIII. At a subsequent motions hearing, the parties announced to the trial court that\r\nthey had reached an agreement to proceed on the Petitions and dismiss the 2006\r\nAction with prejudice. On November 10, 2008, the trial court entered a consent\r\norder of dismissal (the Order of Dismissal) signed by all parties. The Order of\r\nDismissal encompassed the parties' agreement that Dr. Shah would dismiss the\r\n2006 Action with prejudice and proceed on the Petitions. The Order of Dismissal\r\nalso provided \"The parties may argue and rely on such information, documents,\r\nand discovery from the 2006 Action, and affidavits of Drs. Shah, Close and\r\nWaldren, as may be relevant and admissible therein.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days after the trial court issued the Order of Dismissal, Dr. Shah filed a\r\n\"memo in support of consolidated petitions for rule to show cause.\" After a\r\nhearing, the trial court issued an order on February 26, 2009, denying the Petitions.\r\nIn its order, the trial court found the only permissible grounds and the only\r\npermissible relief for contempt were those set forth in the three Petitions and\r\nsupporting memoranda pending at the time of the Order of Dismissal. Therefore,\r\nthe trial court declined to consider any grounds for contempt not asserted in the\r\nPetitions and the three supporting memoranda, including five alleged violations of\r\nthe Settlement Orders set forth in Dr. Shah's \"memo in support of the consolidated\r\npetitions.\" As to the grounds for contempt set forth in the Petitions, the trial court\r\nfound, \"[Dr. Shah's] allegations, even if assumed true, do not come within the\r\nnarrowly drawn ambit of the Settlement Orders' proscribed and prescribed conduct.\r\nMoreover, the evidence convinces me that [the Hospital] never intended to violate\r\nthe Settlement Orders, assuming it did in some way.\" The trial court also ruled, \"In\r\naddition, all motions are denied because the relief sought by [Dr. Shah was] not\r\navailable as a matter of law.\" Pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, Dr. Shah filed a\r\nmotion to alter or amend the judgment. However, the trial court issued an order on\r\nApril 2, 2009, denying Dr. Shah's motion. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nA decision on contempt rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and an\r\nappellate court will not disturb such decision unless the trial court has abused its\r\n\ndiscretion. DiMarco v. DiMarco, 393 S.C. 604, 607, 713 S.E.2d 631, 633 (2011).\r\nAs an equitable matter, we review the exercise of that discretion de novo. See\r\nChisholm v. Chisholm, 396 S.C. 507, 510, 722 S.E.2d 222, 223 (2012) (reviewing\r\nthe family court's discretion in awarding attorney's fees under a de novo standard\r\nof review). Consequently, we will affirm the decision of the trial court unless the\r\nappellant satisfies this court that the preponderance of the evidence is against the\r\nfindings of the trial court. Id.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nDr. Shah first challenges the trial court's ruling that the only grounds for contempt\r\nproperly before it were those asserted in the three Petitions. Dr. Shah argues (1)\r\nsuch finding was a direct contradiction of the parties' agreement and the\r\nunequivocal language in the Order of Dismissal, and (2) new issues of contempt\r\narising from the 2006 Action were tried by implied consent of the parties. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\"As a general rule, judgments are to be construed like other written instruments.\"\r\nHailey v. Hailey, 357 S.C. 18, 25, 590 S.E.2d 495, 498 (Ct. App. 2003) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). \"The determinative factor is the intent of the parties or\r\nthe court, as gathered, not from an isolated part of the contract or judgment but\r\nfrom all its parts.\" Petition of White, 299 S.C. 406, 412, 385 S.E.2d 211, 215 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1989). Hence, a judgment or contract should be examined and considered in\r\nits entirety. Id. \"[I]f the language employed is plain and unambiguous, there is no\r\nroom for construction or interpretation and the effect thereof must be declared in\r\nthe light of the literal meaning of the language used.\" Id.\r\n\r\nWe find the Order of Dismissal unequivocally limited the grounds for contempt to\r\nthose asserted in the Petitions. The first paragraph provides, \"The Plaintiffs agree\r\nto and hereby dismiss [the 2006] action against all Defendants with prejudice.\"\r\nThe order subsequently provides, \"Plaintiffs will proceed in the 1996 action on the\r\npending petitions for rule to show cause and memoranda in support.\" Read\r\ntogether, we find these provisions unambiguously express the parties' agreement\r\nfor Dr. Shah to dismiss all of his claims against the Hospital from the 2006 Action\r\nand proceed solely on the three petitions for rule to show cause that were pending\r\nat the time the court issued the Order of Dismissal. Dr. Shah interprets the\r\nlanguage permitting \"[t]he parties [to] argue and rely on such information,\r\ndocuments and discovery from the 2006 action, and affidavits of Drs. Shah, Close\r\nand Waldren, as may be relevant and admissible therein,\" as expressly allowing\r\n\nhim to assert grounds for contempt other than those in the Petitions. However,\r\nlooking at the Order of Dismissal as a whole, this language can only reasonably be\r\ninterpreted as an expression of the court's intent to permit the parties to supplement\r\nor support their existing arguments already set forth in the pending Petitions and\r\nsupporting memoranda with information subsequently discovered in preparation\r\nfor the 2006 Action. Therefore, grounds for contempt other than those asserted\r\nwithin the Petitions and the three supporting memoranda were not properly before\r\nthe trial court.\r\n\r\nAs to Dr. Shah's implied consent argument, we find the issue is not preserved for\r\nour review. Dr. Shah argues the Hospital's failure to object to the introduction of\r\nevidence relating to issues from the 2006 Action constituted the Hospital's implied\r\nconsent to litigate grounds for contempt not asserted in the Petitions. However,\r\nDr. Shah did not make this argument in his motion to alter or amend the judgment.\r\nTherefore, the issue was never ruled upon by the trial court. See Herron v. Century\r\nBMW, 395 S.C. 461, 465, 719 S.E.2d 640, 642 (2011) (\"[A]n issue cannot be\r\nraised for the first time on appeal.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\r\nFurthermore, even if the issue of implied consent was properly preserved, Dr.\r\nShah's argument lacks merit because any objection made by the Hospital to the\r\nintroduction of evidence would have been futile due to the trial court's ruling that it\r\nwould allow all evidence offered, despite any objections, and it would then\r\ndetermine the relevancy, admissibility, and persuasiveness of the evidence. See\r\nStaubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 415, 529 S.E.2d 543, 547 (2000)\r\n(providing our courts do not require parties to engage in futile actions in order to\r\nprotect their interests on appellate review). For these reasons, we find the trial\r\ncourt acted within its discretion by only considering evidence that related to the\r\ngrounds for contempt asserted in the Petitions and the three supporting\r\nmemoranda.\r\n\r\nNext, Dr. Shah challenges the trial court's determination that the Hospital was not\r\nin contempt of the Settlement Orders. Dr. Shah argues the trial court erred by\r\nfinding the Settlement Orders only applied to the initial QA review, and therefore,\r\nallegations that the Hospital violated its Bylaws did not provide grounds for\r\nholding the Hospital in contempt. Dr. Shah also argues that the evidence supports\r\nfinding the Hospital in contempt. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"All courts have the inherent power to punish for contempt . . . .\" Ex parte\r\nCannon, 385 S.C. 643, 660, 685 S.E.2d 814, 824 (Ct.

App. 2004) (citation\r\nomitted). \"Before a court may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly\r\nand specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.\" Miller, 375 S.C. at 454, 652\r\nS.E.2d at 760 (internal quotation marks omitted). \"Once the moving party has\r\nmade out a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish\r\nhis or her defense and inability to comply with the order.\" Id. (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted).\r\n\r\nWe find the Settlement Orders only govern the QA review process; these orders do\r\nnot purport to govern every aspect of continued interaction between Dr. Shah and\r\nthe Hospital. Both the 2001 Consent Order and the 2003 Supplemental Order\r\nexpressly set forth limited requirements regarding Dr. Shah's QA reviews. The\r\npurpose of the Consent Order was to establish an extra-departmental process for\r\nconducting Dr. Shah's QA reviews to ensure that Dr. Shah received fair and\r\nunbiased reviews of his cases. The Consent Order does not reference any other\r\nstage of the peer review process, much less set forth any requirements as to how\r\nthe Hospital was to conduct its review of matters outside the QA process.\r\n\r\nThe court issued the Supplemental Order to set forth additional procedures and\r\nguidelines regarding the QA review process and to \"clarify the procedure for\r\nhandling issues related to non-QA Administrative Requirements.\" In this order,\r\nthe court first recognized that \"Administrative Requirements are not matters\r\ntraditionally included in the QA Process as envisioned by the prior Consent\r\nOrder,\" and therefore, \"should be addressed through the procedures set forth in the\r\nBylaws and Policies.\" This language acknowledges that the court only intended to\r\nspecify how the Hospital conducted QA reviews of Dr. Shah's cases. Accordingly,\r\nthe Supplemental Order directs the Chief of the Hospital's Radiology Department\r\nto handle any allegation that Dr. Shah violated the Administrative Requirements in\r\n\naccordance with the Hospital's Bylaws and Policies. The fact that the court directs\r\na person affiliated with the Hospital to handle these administrative matters\r\ninternally and in accordance with the Hospital's rules and regulations expresses the\r\ncourt's intent to narrowly limit its intrusion on the Hospital's self-governance to\r\ndirecting how the Hospital conducted QA reviews of Dr. Shah's cases. The\r\nSupplemental Order concludes by reiterating this intent, expressly indicating that\r\nthe court does not intend to preclude the Hospital from taking any action\r\nauthorized under the Bylaws or limit the Hospital's managers and directors from\r\ntaking such action that they deem necessary.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Supplemental Order addresses matters outside the QA review\r\nprocess, such as Administrative Requirements, the court did not direct the Hospital\r\nto handle these matters in any particular manner. Rather, the court permitted the\r\nHospital to address these matters in accordance with its own rules and regulations.\r\nBecause the Settlement Orders only set forth requirements governing how the\r\nHospital conducts QA reviews of Dr. Shah's cases, our review in this case is\r\nlimited to determining whether the Hospital complied with those requirements.\r\nTherefore, we decline to address the asserted grounds for contempt that are\r\nunrelated to the QA review process. See Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR (providing an\r\nappellate court need not address points unnecessary to the decision of the appeal).\r\n\r\nAs to the merits of the case, we find Dr. Shah failed to present clear and\r\nconvincing evidence that the Hospital willfully violated the Settlement Orders. Dr.\r\nShah contends the Hospital failed to comply with requirements governing the QA\r\nreview by not providing Dr. Selby, the outside reviewer, with oversight authority\r\nin the case selection process. To support his position, Dr. Shah points to evidence\r\nthat Dr. Selby did not personally select the medical cases used in his review.\r\nHowever, Dr. Shah's argument misinterprets the Settlement Orders. The Consent\r\nOrder provides a mutually selected outside reviewer will conduct the QA reviews\r\nof Dr. Shah's cases and \"[t]his outside reviewer will have oversight authority over\r\nthe case selection process as well as the cases themselves. The outside reviewer\r\nwill insure that the selection process is performed consistent with [the Hospital's]\r\nestablished protocols and not in a discriminatory fashion.\" The Supplemental\r\nOrder subsequently reiterates this latter provision, indicating \"every effort should\r\nbe made to make the review as similar as possible to the customary and prevailing\r\nprocedure followed for any other person on the Medical Staff.\" This language\r\nunambiguously required the Hospital to provide the outside reviewer with the\r\nauthority to oversee the QA review for the purpose of ensuring Dr. Shah's reviews\r\n\nwere conducted in accordance with the existing procedures and protocols, and not\r\nin a discriminatory manner.\r\n\r\nWhile this authority would certainly permit the outside reviewer to personally\r\nselect the cases used in Dr. Shah's QA review if he or she so chose, the Settlement\r\nOrders did not specifically require the outside reviewer to do so. Moreover, the\r\nSettlement Orders do not prohibit the Hospital from submitting cases to Dr. Selby\r\nfor his review. Although the Hospital selected the first group of cases that Dr.\r\nSelby used in his review, the Hospital fully complied with Dr. Selby's subsequent\r\nrequest for additional cases selected on a different basis. The evidence shows Dr.\r\nSelby was then free to choose which cases he would use in his review of Dr. Shah.\r\nThe record herein does not clearly support a finding that the Hospital willfully\r\nimpaired or prohibited Dr. Selby's authority to oversee the QA review and process.\r\nFor these reasons, we find the trial court acted within its discretion by declining to\r\nhold the Hospital in contempt.\r\n\r\nAgain, we emphasize that the merits of the decision to terminate Dr. Shah's\r\nhospital privileges is not before us. Rather, our review of this case is narrowly\r\nlimited to determining whether the Hospital willfully violated the terms of the\r\nSettlement Orders. In addition, while we recognize the procedures adopted by the\r\nparties and the trial court were unusual, we also recognize the court's broad\r\ndiscretion in choosing to implement equitable remedies or sanctions, including\r\ncontempt. Even if the evidence is conflicting as to willful conduct, the fact finder's\r\ndecision on contempt may be affirmed absent an abuse of the broad discretion\r\ngranted to the court.3\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is hereby\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n3 In light of our disposition herein, we decline to address Dr. Shah's remaining\r\narguments. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (providing an appellate court need not address all\r\nissues on appeal when the disposition of one issue is dispositive).\r\n\nSHORT, J., dissenting:\r\n\r\nI respectfully dissent. The appellant, Dr. Shah, had full privileges at the Hospital\r\nfor more than twenty-nine years, and he maintained a large and profitable\r\nindependent radiology practice there until the Hospital terminated his privileges on\r\nMarch 14, 2006. In 1995, the Hospital awarded an exclusive contract to a\r\nradiology group to render all radiological services for the Hospital, and that is\r\nwhen this dispute began. Ultimately, the parties reached a settlement agreement;\r\nhowever, they could not agree on an outside reviewer and the scope of the review\r\nprocess. Therefore, Judge Keesley issued a supplemental order addressing the\r\nissues and providing for a method to be used by the parties to select an outside\r\nreviewer.\r\n\r\nDr. Shah alleged the Hospital willfully violated the settlement orders by failing to\r\ncomply with requirements governing the review process by not providing Dr.\r\nSelby, the outside reviewer, with oversight authority in the case selection process.\r\nHowever, the trial court found the settlement orders only applied to the QA review\r\nprocess; thus, Dr. Shah's allegations failed to provide grounds for holding the\r\nHospital in contempt.4 When read in totality, I find the clear intent of the 2001\r\nconsent order and 2003 supplemental order was to provide for an outside review of\r\nDr. Shah's cases to determine whether he deviated from the standard of care in\r\ntreating patients. I also find the orders do not limit the outside review to the QA\r\nreview process because the supplemental order states:\r\n\r\n             When a matter involves the traditional QA Process or a\r\n             complaint against Dr. Shah involves an allegation that\r\n             Dr. Shah deviated from the standard of care in treating a\r\n             patient, those matters shall be referred to an outside\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 \"Contempt results from the willful disobedience of a court order, and before a\r\ncourt may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically\r\nreflect the contemptuous conduct.\" Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557\r\nS.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001). A party can act willfully by voluntarily and\r\nintentionally doing something the law forbids or failing to do something the law\r\nrequires to be done. Ex parte Kent, 379 S.C. 633, 637, 666 S.E.2d 921, 923 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2008).\r\n\n             reviewer pursuant to the Consent Order and the\r\n             procedures set forth herein. (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nOn December 30, 2005, the Hospital's Fair Hearing Committee issued its report\r\nupholding the decision to terminate Dr. Shah's privileges. According to the report,\r\nDr. Shah's termination was justified in part by the Hospital's internal review of\r\nthirty-five emergency room cases, which had not been reviewed by Dr. Selby as\r\nrequired by the 2003 supplemental order. These cases were not selected in a\r\nprocess overseen by Dr. Selby, and he did not review them. In addition, these\r\ncases contained allegations that Dr. Shah deviated from the standard of care in\r\ntreating patients; therefore, they should have been reviewed by Dr. Selby per the\r\nsettlement order. These facts are undisputed.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court refused to consider this evidence because it found Dr. Shah did\r\nnot assert it in any of his pending petitions for contempt, and the Hospital's internal\r\nreview of thirty-five emergency room cases was done at the MEC and FHC stage\r\nof the PPR Process and not the QA stage. However, I find the circuit court erred in\r\nrefusing to consider this evidence concerning the issue of contempt. This evidence\r\nwas revealed through discovery in the 2006 action, and the parties agreed this\r\nevidence could be considered by the court. Dr. Shah's principal grounds in his\r\npetitions for contempt were that the Hospital did not allow Dr. Selby to have\r\noversight regarding the case selection process, and this evidence clearly\r\ndemonstrated the Hospital's conscious disregard for the 2003 supplemental order,\r\nwhich provided for an outside review of Dr. Shah's cases to determine whether he\r\ndeviated from the standard of care in treating patients. I find the refusal to allow\r\nDr. Selby to review the thirty-five emergency room cases is evidence of the\r\nHospital's continual refusal to comply with the 2003 supplemental order. Further,\r\nthe issue concerning the thirty-five emergency room cases was presented to the\r\ncourt without objection, and the Hospital presented evidence of the emergency\r\nroom cases in its memorandum to the court.\r\n\r\nI further find the unauthorized review of the thirty-five emergency room cases by\r\nthe Hospital's employee, Dr. John Stewart, and the Hospital's reliance thereon as\r\njustification for terminating Dr. Shah's privileges constitutes overwhelming\r\nevidence that the Hospital intentionally and willfully violated the 2003\r\nsupplemental order. There is no question the Hospital knew all reviews of Dr.\r\nShah's cases were to be handled by an independent outside reviewer only. As a\r\nresult, I find the Hospital willfully failed to comply with 2001 consent order and\r\nthe 2003 supplemental order by conducting an internal review of the thirty-five\r\n\nemergency cases and determining Dr. Shah violated the standard of care. The\r\nHospital should not have considered these cases in its decision to revoke Dr. Shah's\r\nhospital privileges. Therefore, I would remand this case to the trial court to\r\ndetermine the appropriate remedy to be imposed.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-476","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Senior Assistant\r\n        Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n        Attorney General Alphonso Simon, Jr., and Solicitor\r\n        Warren B. Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Tremaine Rashon Wray appeals his conviction for murder. We\r\naffirm.\r\n\r\nThe victim was socializing with a group of friends at a club in Columbia. An\r\naltercation ensued, prompting the group to depart from the premises. As they\r\nhurried to leave, shots were fired from a vehicle toward a car wash stall where their\r\nown vehicles were parked. The victim was shot in the leg and pronounced dead\r\nshortly after being taken to the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the club identified Wray and co-defendant Taurus Watts from\r\nphotographic lineups as the shooters. He also was acquainted with Wray, had\r\nknown Watts a long time, and claimed to have seen both at his business\r\nestablishment on the night of the shooting. In addition, he was able to describe\r\nother particulars relevant to the incident, such as the weapon used in the shooting,\r\nthe vehicle in which Wray and Watts were riding, the direction in which the\r\nvehicle was travelling when the victim was shot, and the side of the vehicle\r\nwhence the shots were fired. The murder weapon was never found, but the\r\ninformation provided by the club owner was consistent with other details\r\ndiscovered by the police. These details included (1) the location of gunshot\r\nresidue in the vehicle in which Wray and Watts were riding, (2) two projectiles\r\nfrom the car wash stall and one projectile recovered from the victim's clothing, and\r\n(3) shell casings found at the crime scene. Wray and Watts were subsequently\r\nindicted for murder. Over objections from both defendants, the State successfully\r\nmoved to have their scheduled trial postponed to investigate a new lead on the\r\nlocation of the murder weapon. They were tried together a few months later. The\r\njury found both defendants guilty, and they filed separate appeals.\r\n\r\n1. Wray argues the trial judge should have suppressed the fruits of a search warrant\r\nof the vehicle in which he and Watts were seen on the night of the incident because\r\nthe affidavit supporting the warrant failed to set forth sufficient information to\r\nestablish probable cause and merely gave conclusory statements by the investigator\r\nwithout identifying any witnesses. We affirm the trial judge's admission of this\r\nevidence. See State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 666 (2000)\r\n(stating the appellate court will affirm the trial judge's ruling on a motion to\r\nsuppress if the ruling is supported by any evidence and will reverse only if there is\r\n\"clear error\"). The issuing magistrate's task is to make \"a practical, common-sense\r\ndecision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him,\r\nincluding the 'veracity' and 'basis of knowledge' of persons supplying hearsay\r\ninformation, there is a fair probability that . . . evidence of a crime will be found in\r\n\na particular place.\" Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983). According to the\r\naffidavit, (1) several witnesses saw the vehicle to be searched leaving the crime\r\nscene and identified it as the vehicle from which several rounds were fired and (2)\r\na witness identified both the driver and the passenger in the vehicle and stated that\r\nthe gunfire that struck the victim came from the vehicle at the incident location.\r\nNone of the witnesses were confidential informants; therefore, evidence of past\r\nreliability was not necessary. See State v. Driggers, 322 S.C. 506, 510, 473 S.E.2d\r\n57, 59 (Ct. App. 1996). Moreover, law enforcement personnel located the vehicle\r\nat the residence of the individual identified by the witness as the driver, thus\r\nindependently corroborating the witness's account. See State v. Bellamy, 336 S.C.\r\n140, 145, 519 S.E.2d 347, 349 (1999) (upholding a finding that a search warrant\r\nwas based on probable cause even though the informant's reliability was suspect\r\nand citing, among other reasons, that weapons described by the informant matched\r\nthose that had been stolen from the police department just days earlier). Finally,\r\nalthough the affidavit did not include the names of the witnesses, it noted that the\r\nwitness who identified the occupants of the vehicle had also given a separate\r\nstatement to law enforcement. See Gates, 462 U.S. at 241-42 (\"[A]n affidavit\r\nrelying on hearsay 'is not deemed to be insufficient on that score, so long as a\r\nsubstantial basis for crediting the hearsay is presented.'\" (quoting Jones v. United\r\nStates, 362 U.S. 257, 269 (1960))).\r\n\r\n2. Wray next complains that the trial judge should have granted his motion for a\r\nmistrial because of two inflammatory and leading questions that the solicitor asked\r\na witness for the State. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe witness had previously been in a relationship with one of the men socializing\r\nwith the victim on the night of his death. She was at the club that night. There,\r\nshe ran into her former boyfriend and was introduced to others in his party. When\r\nshe went to the bar by herself, an unknown man, whom she knew only as \"T-\r\nsomething,\" made unwanted advances toward her. The witness then proceeded to\r\nthe dance floor, where her former boyfriend approached her and stood behind her.\r\nShortly thereafter, the man known as \"T-something\" resumed making advances\r\ntoward the witness despite her attempt to discourage him, prompting her former\r\nboyfriend to throw a drink on him. A fight erupted inside the club, which led to\r\nthe victim's death and resulted in Wray's conviction. The witness gave a\r\ndescription of \"T-something\" and testified that he was definitely not Taurus Watts,\r\nwith whom she was acquainted through family members.\r\n\nThe State called the witness to testify in its case-in-chief. Without objection, the\r\nsolicitor asked her if she remembered being reluctant to talk with the police when\r\nthey came to her home to question her about the incident, and the witness answered\r\nin the affirmative. The solicitor then asked, \"Isn't it true you were scared to talk to\r\nthem?\" Wray objected on the basis that the solicitor was attempting to lead the\r\nwitness, and the trial judge sustained the objection. Immediately after the trial\r\njudge ruled on the objection, the solicitor asked the witness about a statement she\r\nmade to an investigator about her fear. Although Wray promptly objected again,\r\nthe witness answered the question in the negative before Wray could elaborate on\r\nhis objection. The trial judge then instructed the jury to \"to disregard both the\r\nquestion and answer in that line of questioning.\" The witness went on to testify\r\nthat despite her initial reluctance, she eventually went to the sheriff's department\r\nand provided a statement.\r\n\r\nThe jury was then excused, and Wray moved for a mistrial, arguing the solicitor\r\nimproperly injected the issue of the witness's fear of retaliation if she discussed the\r\ncase with law enforcement. He also contended the question was unduly suggestive\r\nand resulted in obvious prejudice to him. The trial judge refused to declare a\r\nmistrial, noting she had given a curative instruction, but offered to restate the\r\nprecautionary statement to the jurors. Wray declined the offer.\r\n\r\n\"The decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial\r\ncourt and will not be overturned on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting\r\nto an error of law.\" State v. Bantan, 387 S.C. 412, 417, 692 S.E.2d 201, 203 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2010) (citing State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 551, 514 S.E.2d 584, 590\r\n(1999)). In a criminal case, \"[a] mistrial should be granted only when absolutely\r\nnecessary, and a defendant must show both error and prejudice in order to be\r\nentitled to a mistrial.\" State v. Wilson, 389 S.C. 579, 585-86, 698 S.E.2d 862, 865\r\n(Ct. App. 2010). \"'The determination of prejudice must be based on the entire\r\nrecord and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case.'\" Id. at 586, 698\r\nS.E.2d at 865-66 (quoting State v. White, 371 S.C. 439, 447, 639 S.E.2d 160, 164\r\n(Ct. App. 2006)).\r\n\r\nHere, in ruling on Wray's objection, the trial judge instructed the jury to disregard\r\nboth the question and the witness's answer. Also, when charging the jury, she\r\ndirected the jurors to disregard any testimony stricken from the record. Although\r\nWray argued both at trial and on appeal that he was adversely affected by the two\r\nquestions to which he objected, he offered only conclusory arguments to support\r\nhis assertion that he was irremediably prejudiced by the questions and resulting\r\n\ntestimony. Moreover, the inflammatory insinuations in the solicitor's questions\r\nwere not referred to again during the six and one-half days of trial that followed the\r\nwitness's appearance. Finally, neither the questions at issue nor any answers that\r\nthe witness gave implicated either defendant in the victim's murder. Considering\r\nall these circumstances, we hold the trial judge's remedial measures were sufficient\r\nto cure any prejudice from the solicitor's questions; therefore, the case for mistrial\r\npresented here was not one of such manifest necessity that warrants reversal of the\r\ntrial judge's refusal to invoke this drastic measure. See State v. Patterson, 337 S.C.\r\n215, 227, 522 S.E.2d 845, 851 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"A mistrial should only be granted\r\nin cases of manifest necessity and with the greatest caution for very plain and\r\nobvious reasons.\"); id. (stating that a mistrial should not be ordered in every case in\r\nwhich incompetent evidence is received and that \"the trial judge should exhaust\r\nother methods to cure possible prejudice before aborting a trial\").\r\n\r\n3. Finally, Wray maintains the circuit judge originally scheduled to preside at the\r\ntrial erred in granting the State's motion to continue the case to investigate recently\r\nobtained information about where the murder weapon could be found. Wray\r\nargues the State, in moving for a continuance, failed to comply with Rule 7 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure and this error was compounded by the\r\ncourt's excusing the State from compliance with this rule. We disagree.\r\n\r\nA trial judge's decision to grant a continuance will not be reversed absent a clear\r\nshowing of an abuse of discretion. State v. Galimore, 396 S.C. 471, 477, 721\r\nS.E.2d 475, 478 (Ct. App. 2012). Here, as required by Rule 7, the State's motion\r\nwas made in writing and filed with the clerk of court. Rule 7(a), SCRCrimP. The\r\nmotion also included a showing of good and sufficient legal cause to postpone the\r\ntrial, namely the existence of newly discovered information that, notwithstanding\r\ndiligent efforts by law enforcement, could not be fully investigated before the\r\nscheduled trial. Furthermore, contrary to Wray's argument at trial, the requirement\r\nthat the State present testimony to support its motion applies only when the\r\ncontinuance is sought because of the absence of a witness. Rule 7(b), SCRCrimP.\r\nIn this case, the State requested a continuance to investigate a new lead about the\r\nlocation of the missing murder weapon, not because a witness failed to appear.\r\nBased on these circumstances, we hold the grant of the State's motion to continue\r\nthe case was within the trial judge's discretion.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-478","title":"State v.

We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe complaint alleges that on April 29, 2003, Smith gave a Fixed Rate Note\r\n(\"Note\") to Wells Fargo in the amount of $83,000. The Complaint further\r\nalleges that to secure payment of the Note, Smith gave Wells Fargo a real\r\nestate mortgage (\"Mortgage\") covering his real property at 1 Anchor Road in\r\nGreenville, South Carolina, as well as a 2003 Fleetwood mobile home.\r\n\r\nWells Fargo filed this action for foreclosure, alleging Smith defaulted on his loan\r\npayments under the Note and Mortgage and owed $77,460.63 on the debt. After\r\nthe Greenville County Clerk of Court filed an order of reference, Smith filed a\r\nmotion to allow late filing of responsive pleadings, and Wells Fargo consented to\r\nan extension of time. Smith filed an answer and counterclaim with a jury trial\r\nrequest and asserted, along with other various defenses, the following\r\ncounterclaims: 1) accounting; 2) unconscionability; and 3) violation of section 37-\r\n10-102 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010).2 Wells Fargo filed a motion to\r\nstrike the jury demand (\"motion to strike\"). The Master heard the motion to strike\r\nand asked Smith to submit additional authority to support his position.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, 2009, the Master issued an order granting Wells Fargo's motion to\r\nstrike and confirming the order of reference. Smith timely filed a Rule 59(e),\r\nSCRCP, motion seeking to alter or amend the final order, and by order entered\r\nApril 15, 2009, the Master denied Smith's Rule 59(e) motion. This appeal\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n1 Wells Fargo, NA is the successor by merger to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc.  \r\n2 Section 37-10-102 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) is also referred to as\r\nthe Attorney Preference statute.                                \r\n \r\n\n\"The matter of striking from a pleading, and the matter of admissibility of evidence\r\nis largely within the discretion of the trial judge.\" Brown v. Coastal States Life Ins.\r\nCo., 264 S.C. 190, 194, 213 S.E.2d 726, 728 (1975). \"The granting or refusal of a\r\n[m]otion to strike . . . will not be reversed except for an abuse of discretion or\r\nunless the action of the trial judge was controlled by an error of law.\" Id. at 194-\r\n95, 213 S.E.2d at 728 (internal citation omitted); see also Mayes v. Paxton, 313\r\nS.C. 109, 115, 437 S.E.2d 66, 70 (1993) (holding absent an abuse of discretion, the\r\ntrial court's ruling on a motion to strike will not be reversed).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, \"[w]hether a party is entitled to a jury trial is a question of law.\"\r\nVerenes v. Alvanos, 387 S.C. 11, 15, 690 S.E.2d 771, 772 (2010). \"An appellate\r\ncourt may decide questions of law with no particular deference to the trial court.\"\r\nIn re Campbell, 379 S.C. 593, 599, 666 S.E.2d 908, 911 (2008) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nA. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Smith asserts the Master exceeded his jurisdiction in ruling on Wells\r\nFargo's motion to strike. As a result, Smith contends the matter should have been\r\ntransferred to the circuit court when he initially filed the jury demand as part of the\r\nanswer and counterclaim. We disagree.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Rule 53, SCRCP, a master has no power or authority except that which\r\nis given to him by an order of reference. Smith v. Ocean Lakes Family\r\nCampground, 315 S.C. 379, 381, 433 S.E.2d 909, 910 (Ct. App. 1993). When a\r\ncase is referred to a master under Rule 53, the master is given the power to conduct\r\nhearings in the same manner as the circuit court unless the order of reference\r\nspecifies or limits the master's powers. Smith Cos. of Greenville, Inc. v. Hayes,\r\n311 S.C. 358, 360, 428 S.E.2d 900, 902 (Ct. App. 1993). Specifically, Rule 53(c),\r\nSCRCP, states \"[o]nce referred, the master or special referee shall exercise all\r\npower and authority which a circuit court judge sitting without a jury would have\r\nin a similar matter.\"\r\n\r\nAs a basis for this claim, Smith cites the Reporter's Note appended to the 2002\r\nAmendment to Rule 53, SCRCP. This note states, \"If there are counterclaims\r\nrequiring a jury trial, any party may file a demand for a jury under Rule 38 and the\r\ncase will be returned to the circuit court.\" However, the order of reference in this\r\ncase authorized the Master \"to take testimony and to direct entry of final judgment\r\nin this action under Rule 53(b), SCRCP, and all matters arising from or reasonably\r\n                                            \r\n \r\n\nrelated to such action. The Master in Equity shall retain jurisdiction to perform all\r\nnecessary acts incident to this foreclosure action . . . .\" Thus, once the case is\r\nreferred to the Master, he has subject matter jurisdiction to resolve the action to the\r\nextent the order of reference provides, and with the authority a circuit court judge\r\nwould have in a similar matter. See Rule 53(c), SCRCP; Hayes, 311 S.C. at 360,\r\n428 S.E.2d at 902. Accordingly, we find the Master had subject matter jurisdiction\r\nto rule on Wells Fargo's motion to strike the jury demand as the matter was\r\nproperly before the Master pursuant to the order of reference and our rules of civil\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nB. Smith's Counterclaims\r\nSmith contends the Master erred in determining Smith's counterclaims for\r\nunconscionability and a violation of the Attorney Preference statute were not\r\nentitled to a jury trial. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Constitution provides \"[t]he right of trial by jury shall be\r\npreserved inviolate.\" S.C. Const. art. I, § 14. \"The right to a trial by jury is\r\nguaranteed in every case in which the right to a jury was secured at the time of the\r\nadoption of the Constitution in 1868.\" Mims Amusement Co. v. S.C. Law\r\nEnforcement Div., 366 S.C. 141, 149, 621 S.E.2d 344, 348 (2005) (citation\r\nomitted). Additionally, Rule 38(b), SCRCP, provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n                             Any party may demand a trial by jury of any issue triable\r\n                             of right by a jury by serving upon the other parties a\r\n                             demand therefor[e] in writing at any time after the\r\n                             commencement of the action and not later than 10 days\r\n                             after the service of the last pleading directed to such\r\n                             issue. Such demand may be endorsed upon a pleading of\r\n                             the party.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Smith demanded a jury trial in his answer and counterclaim\r\nwhen he asserted counterclaims of accounting3, unconscionability, and a violation\r\nof the Attorney Preference statute against Wells Fargo.\r\n                                                            \r\n3Smith conceded at the non-evidentiary hearing he was not entitled to a jury trial\r\non his counterclaim for accounting and subsequently abandoned this argument on\r\nappeal. See Rule 208(b)(1)(D), SCACR (stating each \"particular issue to be\r\naddressed shall be set forth in distinctive type, followed by discussion and citations\r\nof authority\"); Jinks v. Richland Cnty., 355 S.C. 341, 344, 585 S.E.2d 281, 283\r\n                                                                \r\n \r\n\n\"Generally, the relevant question in determining the right to trial by jury is whether\r\nan action is legal or equitable; there is no right to trial by jury for equitable\r\nactions.\" Lester v. Dawson, 327 S.C. 263, 267, 491 S.E.2d 240, 242 (1997). If a\r\ncomplaint is equitable and the counterclaim legal and compulsory, the defendant\r\nhas the right to a jury trial on the counterclaim. C & S Real Estate Servs., Inc. v.\r\nMassengale, 290 S.C. 299, 302, 350 S.E.2d 191, 193 (1986), modified by Johnson\r\nv. S.C. Nat'l Bank, 292 S.C. 51, 354 S.E.2d 895 (1987). \"A mortgage foreclosure\r\nis an action in equity.\" U.S. Bank Trust Nat'l. Ass'n v. Bell, 385 S.C. 364, 373, 684\r\nS.E.2d 199, 204 (Ct. App. 2009). As Wells Fargo's foreclosure allegation is\r\nequitable in nature, Smith has the right to a jury trial only if his counterclaim is\r\nboth legal and compulsory. See C & S Real Estate Servs., Inc., 290 S.C. at 302,\r\n350 S.E.2d at 193.\r\n\r\nCharacterization of an \"action as equitable or legal depends on the appellant's 'main\r\npurpose' in bringing the action.\" Ins. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. S.C. Ins. Co., 271 S.C.\r\n289, 293, 247 S.E.2d 315, 318 (1978) (citations omitted).4 \"The main purpose of\r\nthe action should generally be ascertained from the body of the complaint.\" Id.\r\n(citation omitted). \"However, if necessary, resort may also be had to the prayer for\r\nrelief and any other facts and circumstances which throw light upon the main\r\npurpose of the action.\" Id. (citation omitted). The nature of the issues raised by\r\nthe pleadings and character of relief sought under them determines the character of\r\nan action as legal or equitable. Bell v. Mackey, 191 S.C. 105, 119-20, 3 S.E.2d\r\n816, 822 (1939) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nFor Smith's counterclaims to be entitled to a jury trial, each counterclaim must be\r\nboth legal and compulsory.\r\n\r\n1. Unconscionability\r\n\r\nSmith argues the Master erred in finding he was not entitled to a jury trial on his\r\nunconscionability counterclaim. We disagree.\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n(2003) (holding issues not argued in the brief are deemed abandoned and precluded\r\nfrom consideration on appeal). \r\n4 \"[T]he 'main purpose' rule evolved from a determination that where a plaintiff has\r\nprayed for money damages in addition to equitable relief, characterization of the\r\naction as equitable or legal depends on the plaintiff's 'main purpose' in bringing the\r\naction.\" Floyd v. Floyd, 306 S.C. 376, 380, 412 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1991) (citations\r\nomitted).                                                                                      \r\n \r\n\na) Common Law Unconscionability5\r\n\r\nAlthough Smith's counterclaim for common law unconscionability is compulsory,\r\nhe is not entitled to a jury trial because this is an equitable claim that does not\r\ncreate a cause of action for damages.\r\n\r\n\"By definition, a counterclaim is compulsory only if it arises out of the same\r\ntransaction or occurrence as the opposing party's claim.\" First-Citizens Bank &\r\nTrust Co. of S.C. v. Hucks, 305 S.C. 296, 298, 408 S.E.2d 222, 223 (1991); see\r\nalso Rule 13(a), SCRCP. The test for determining if a counterclaim is compulsory\r\nis whether there is a \"logical relationship\" between the claim and the counterclaim.\r\nMullinax v. Bates, 317 S.C. 394, 396, 453 S.E.2d 894, 895 (1995). In N.C. Fed.\r\nSav. & Loan Ass'n v. DAV Corp., 298 S.C. 514, 518, 381 S.E.2d 903, 905 (1989),\r\nour supreme court adopted the \"logical relationship\" test and held DAV's\r\ncounterclaim was compulsory because \"there [was] a logical relationship between\r\nthe enforceability of the note which [was] the subject of the foreclosure action and\r\nthe validity of the purported oral agreement which, if performed, would have\r\navoided default on the note by the joint venture.\" In essence, the \"logical\r\nrelationship\" determination is made by asking whether the counterclaim would\r\naffect the lender's right to enforce the note and foreclose the mortgage. Advance\r\nIntern., Inc. v. N.C. Nat'l Bank of S.C., 316 S.C. 266, 269-70, 449 S.E.2d 580, 582\r\n(Ct. App. 1994), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 320 S.C. 532, 466 S.E.2d 367\r\n(1996).\r\n\r\nHere, there is a \"logical relationship\" between the enforceability of the Note, which\r\nis the subject of the foreclosure action, and the allegation that the Mortgage\r\nbetween Wells Fargo and Smith is unconscionable. If Smith prevails on his\r\nunconscionability claim, it will affect Wells Fargo's right to enforce the Note and\r\nforeclose the Mortgage. Therefore, Smith's common law unconscionability\r\ncounterclaim is compulsory under the \"logical relationship\" test.\r\n\r\nEven though Smith's common law unconscionability counterclaim is compulsory,\r\nbecause common law unconscionability only provides an equitable relief, Smith is\r\n                                                            \r\n5 Smith's counterclaim for unconscionability failed to specify whether it was a\r\nclaim for common law unconscionability or statutory unconscionability under\r\nsection 37-5-108 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010). We analyze this issue\r\nunder both and hold the Master was correct in finding Smith was not entitled to a\r\njury trial under either version of the counterclaim.            \r\n \r\n\nnot entitled to a jury trial on his counterclaim. Jurisdictions throughout the country\r\nagree that common law unconscionability is an equitable cause of action with\r\ncorresponding relief that is only equitable in nature. See Doe v. SexSearch.com,\r\n551 F.3d 414, 419 (6th Cir. 2008) (\"At common law, unconscionability is a\r\ndefense against enforcement, not a basis for recovering damages.\"); Super Glue\r\nCorp. v. Avis Rent a Car Sys., Inc., 517 N.Y.S.2d 764, 766 (N.Y. App. Div. 1987)\r\n(\"The doctrine of unconscionability is used as a shield, not a sword, and may not\r\nbe used as a basis for affirmative recovery.\"); see, e.g., Restatement (Second) of\r\nContracts § 208 (1981) (\"If a contract or term thereof is unconscionable at the time\r\nthe contract is made a court may refuse to enforce the contract, or may enforce the\r\nremainder of the contract without the unconscionable term, or may so limit the\r\napplication of any unconscionable term as to avoid any unconscionable result.\").\r\nDespite Smith's request for actual and punitive damages for unconscionability in\r\nthe body of his pleadings, the primary relief sought is to have the mortgage\r\ndeclared void. Accordingly, Smith seeks relief from a jury that cannot be granted.\r\nSee Simpson v. MSA of Myrtle Beach, 373 S.C. 14, 25, 644 S.E.2d 663, 669 (2007)\r\n(\"In determining whether a contract was 'tainted by an absence of meaningful\r\nchoice,' courts should take into account the nature of the injuries suffered by the\r\nplaintiff; whether the plaintiff is a substantial business concern; the relative\r\ndisparity in the parties' bargaining power; the parties' relative sophistication;\r\nwhether there is an element of surprise in the inclusion of the challenged clause;\r\nand the conspicuousness of the clause.\") (emphasis added); Mortgage Elec. Sys.,\r\nInc. v. White, 384 S.C. 606, 615, 682 S.E.2d 498, 502 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"Rescission\r\nis an equitable remedy that attempts to undo a contract from the beginning as if the\r\ncontract had never existed.\"); Loyola Fed. Sav. Bank v. Thomasson Props., 318\r\nS.C. 92, 93, 456 S.E.2d 423, 424 (Ct. App. 1995) (\"If the claim is equitable, there\r\nis no right to a jury trial.\"). Because the only remedies available for common law\r\nunconscionability are equitable, there is no right to a jury trial on this claim. See\r\nBrown v. Greenwood Sch. Dist. 50 Bd. of Trs., 344 S.C. 522, 525, 544 S.E.2d 642,\r\n643 (Ct. App. 2001) (\"There is no right to a jury trial for equitable remedies such\r\nas rescission and restitution.\"). Accordingly, Smith's common law\r\nunconscionability counterclaim is not entitled to a jury trial.\r\n\r\nb) Statutory Unconscionability\r\n\r\nApplying the same \"logical relationship\" test, we find Smith's counterclaim for\r\nstatutory unconscionability is also compulsory. In addition to arising out of the\r\nsame transaction or occurrence as Wells Fargo's foreclosure action, Smith's\r\ncounterclaim bears a \"logical relationship\" to the enforceability of the Note and\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            \r\n \r\n\nMortgage. Accordingly, Smith's statutory unconscionability counterclaim is\r\ncompulsory under the \"logical relationship\" test.\r\n\r\nAlthough the statutory unconscionability counterclaim is compulsory, section 37-\r\n5-108 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) requires the determination of\r\nwhether an agreement is unconscionable to be a matter of law for the court. See\r\nTilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 333 S.C. 33, 38, 508 S.E.2d 16, 18 (1998) (\"If a statute's\r\nlanguage is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning,\r\nthere is no occasion for employing rules of statutory interpretation and the court\r\nhas no right to look for or impose another meaning.\"). In section 37-5-108, the\r\nGeneral Assembly explicitly chose the use of the term \"court\" to unequivocally\r\ndemonstrate that the matter is not to be resolved by a jury, but by the court. See §\r\n37-5-108(1) (\"[I]f the court as a matter of law finds . . . the agreement or\r\ntransaction to have been unconscionable . . . the court may refuse to enforce the\r\nagreement.\") (emphasis added); see also § 37-5-108(3) (\"If it is claimed or appears\r\nto the court that the agreement or transaction or any term or part thereof may be\r\nunconscionable . . . the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present\r\nevidence . . . to aid the court in making the determination.\") (emphasis added).\r\nTherefore, section 37-5-108 does not provide a right to a jury trial for a statutory\r\nunconscionability cause of action. Accordingly, we affirm the Master's decision to\r\nstrike Smith's request for a jury trial on his unconscionability counterclaim. \r\n\r\n2. Violation of the Attorney Preference Statute\r\n\r\nTo determine whether Smith is entitled to a jury trial on his allegation that Wells\r\nFargo violated the Attorney Preference statute, we again must determine if this\r\ncounterclaim is both legal and compulsory. See C & S Real Estate Servs., Inc., 290\r\nS.C. at 302, 350 S.E.2d at 193. We conclude Smith's counterclaim is permissive\r\nbecause a violation of the Attorney Preference statute would not affect the\r\nenforceability of the Note and Mortgage.\r\n\r\nSection 37-10-102(a) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) provides, in\r\npertinent part:\r\n\r\n             Whenever the primary purpose of a loan that is secured\r\n             in whole or in part by a lien on real estate is for a\r\n             personal, family or household purpose . . . [t]he creditor\r\n             must ascertain prior to closing the preference of the\r\n             borrower as to the legal counsel that is employed to\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            \r\n \r\n\n             represent the debtor in all matters of the transaction\r\n             relating to the closing of the transaction . . . .\r\n\r\nThe complaint alleges that to secure payment of this Note, Smith gave Wells Fargo\r\na real estate Mortgage covering his real estate property as well as a mobile home.\r\nAs a result, Smith was entitled to choose an attorney of his preference for the\r\nclosing of the transaction pursuant to section 37-10-102(a). A violation of the\r\nAttorney Preference statute is enforced by section 37-10-105(A) of the South\r\nCarolina Code (Supp. 2010). The enforcement provision of the Attorney\r\nPreference statute provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n             If a creditor violates a provision of this chapter, the\r\n             debtor has a cause of action . . . to recover actual\r\n             damages and also a right in an action . . . to recover from\r\n             the person violating this chapter a penalty in an amount\r\n             determined by the court of not less than one thousand\r\n             five hundred dollars and not more than seven thousand\r\n             five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 37-10-105(A) (Supp. 2010). A review of this statute\r\ndemonstrates Smith's counterclaim has no \"logical relationship\" to the\r\nenforceability of the Note and Mortgage. Moreover, even if a violation of the\r\nstatute occurred, Smith would only be entitled to actual damages and a possible\r\npenalty between $1,500 to $7,500. The statute, however, does not permit\r\nrescission of the Note and Mortgage for its violation. See § 37-10-105(A). As\r\nSmith's counterclaim bears no \"logical relationship\" to the enforceability of the\r\nNote and Mortgage, we conclude Smith's counterclaim is permissive. Therefore,\r\nSmith waived his right to a jury trial by asserting it in the foreclosure action. See\r\nN.C. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 294 S.C. at 30, 362 S.E.2d at 310 (\"[W]here a\r\ndefendant in an action begun in equity asserts a permissive counterclaim that is\r\nlegal in nature, the defendant is deemed to have waived the right to a jury trial on\r\nthe issues raised by the counterclaim.\"). Accordingly, we affirm the Master's\r\ndecision to strike Smith's request for a jury trial on his counterclaim for a violation\r\nof the Attorney Preference statute.\r\n\r\nC. Scope of Motion to Strike Jury Demand\r\nSmith contends the Master exceeded the scope of Wells Fargo's motion to strike by\r\nmaking findings of fact and conclusions of law based on documents and\r\ninformation not in evidence. We agree.      \r\n \r\n\nA reversal is required when the trial court's ruling exceeds the limits and scope of\r\nthe particular motion before it. Skinner v. Skinner, 257 S.C. 544, 549-50, 186\r\nS.E.2d 523, 526 (1972).\r\n\r\nAfter a brief non-evidentiary motion hearing, the Master requested Smith submit\r\nauthority to support his assertion he was entitled to a jury trial. A review of the\r\nMaster's order demonstrates his ruling went beyond the permissible scope of Wells\r\nFargo's motion. The order granting Wells Fargo's motion to strike had the effect of\r\ngranting judgment and making findings of fact based on information not admitted\r\nor decided by the pleadings. In short, the Master's order on the motion to strike the\r\njury demand makes findings of fact and rules that a cause of action is meritless\r\nwithout evidentiary support, constituting an abuse of discretion.6 See Edwards v.\r\nEdwards, 384 S.C. 179, 183, 682 S.E.2d 37, 39 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"The [trial] court\r\nabuses its discretion when factual findings are without evidentiary support or a\r\nruling is based upon an error of law.\"). We conclude these impermissible findings\r\nof fact and conclusions of law are prejudicial to Smith, thus warranting reversal.\r\nSee Watts v. Bell Oil Co. of Ocean Drive, Inc., 266 S.C. 61, 63, 221 S.E.2d 529,\r\n530 (1976) (holding a trial court will only be reversed when the record shows not\r\nonly error but also prejudice).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn summary, the Master had subject matter jurisdiction to rule on Wells Fargo's\r\nmotion to strike the jury demand. Additionally, the Master's ruling on Smith's\r\nunconscionability and attorney preference statute counterclaims is affirmed. The\r\nMaster's order, to the extent that it details specific findings of fact and conclusions\r\nof law, is reversed and the case remanded to the Master for a bench trial on the\r\nmerits of all causes of action alleged.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nGEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n6 The Master made certain findings of fact that go to the substance and merits of\r\nSmith's claims and well beyond the scope of the motion to strike, including:\r\n\"Smith's counterclaim has no merit,\" and \"[b]ecause Smith would not be entitled to\r\nrelief as against Wells Fargo on his counterclaim, it can hardly be said he would be\r\nentitled to a jury trial on it.\"                                \r\n \r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-479","title":"Elkachbendi v.

DeVane and Theresa Wozniak Jenkins, both of\r\n             Ameika DeVane & Mack, of Summerville, for\r\n             Respondent/Appellant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this cross-appeal, Mokhtar Elkachbendi (Husband) appeals\r\nfrom two orders of the family court: (1) the first, filed on May 6, 2010, granted\r\nAnne Elkachbendi (Wife) attorney's fees and costs related to the parties' divorce\r\nand (2) the second, filed on August 24, 2010, dismissed Husband's Rule 59(e),\r\nSCRCP, motion to alter or amend the May 6, 2010 order as untimely. Wife cross-\r\nappeals from the family court's August 24, 2010 order, contending the family court\r\nerred in denying her request for attorney's fees and costs incurred in responding to\r\nHusband's Rule 59(e)motion. We affirm in part, dismiss in part, and reverse in\r\npart.\r\n\r\n1.     In deciding an appeal from the family court, \"this Court may find facts in\r\naccordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.\" Miles v.\r\nMiles, 393 S.C. 111, 117, 711 S.E.2d 880, 883 (2011). \"Moreover, consistent with\r\nour constitutional authority for de novo review, an appellant is not relieved of his\r\nburden to demonstrate error in the family court's findings of fact. Consequently,\r\nthe family court's factual findings will be affirmed unless 'appellant satisfies this\r\ncourt that the preponderance of the evidence is against the finding of the [family]\r\ncourt.'\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 392, 709 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2011) (quoting\r\nFinley v. Cartwright, 55 S.C. 198, 202, 33 S.E. 359, 360-61 (1899)).\r\n\r\n2.      As to whether the family court erred in finding Husband's Rule 59(e) motion\r\nuntimely, we affirm the family court's ruling. \"A motion to alter or amend the\r\njudgment shall be served not later than 10 days after receipt of written notice\r\nof the entry of the order.\" Rule 59(e), SCRCP (emphasis added). In Ackerman v.\r\n3-V Chemical, Inc., \"[t]he sole issue on certiorari [was] what constitutes timeliness\r\nin filing a Rule 59, SCRCP, motion to reconsider.\" 349 S.C. 212, 214, 562 S.E.2d\r\n613, 614 (2002). There, the South Carolina Supreme Court rejected an argument\r\nthat a Rule 59 motion filed ten days after receipt of the written order, but not\r\nwithin ten days of receipt of the Form Four notice of entry of the judgment, was\r\ntimely: \"There is simply no language in the rule permitting the motion to be served\r\n10 days after receipt of the written order; it states 10 days after receipt of written\r\n\nnotice of the entry of judgment.\" Id. at 215, 562 S.E.2d at 615. Furthermore,\r\nRule 6, SCRCP, does not extend the time for filing and serving a Rule 59(e)\r\nmotion: \"The time for taking any action under [R]ules 50(b), 52(b), 59, and 60(b)\r\nmay not be extended except to the extent and under the conditions stated in [the\r\nRule].\" Rule 6(b), SCRCP; see also Witzig v. Witzig, 325 S.C. 363, 366, 479\r\nS.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"Rule 6(e) is a pleadings rule and applies only\r\nwhen service is effective upon mailing. The extra five days provided by Rule\r\n6(e) compensates for the time notice is in the mail.\") (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\"Immediately upon the entry of an order or judgment the clerk shall serve a notice\r\nof the entry by first class mail upon every party . . . . Such mailing shall not be\r\nnecessary to parties who have already received notice. Such mailing is sufficient\r\nnotice for all purposes for which notice of the entry of an order or judgment is\r\nrequired by these rules . . . .\" Rule 77(d), SCRCP (emphasis added). Here, it is\r\nundisputed that, pursuant to Rule 77(d) the clerk of the family court mailed the\r\nForm Four notice of entry of judgment to counsel of record for both parties on May\r\n6, 2010.1 When challenged as to the timeliness of his Rule 59(e) motion, Husband\r\nfailed to offer any evidence regarding the date he received the Form Four notice of\r\nentry of judgment. See Green v. Green, 320 S.C. 347, 350-51, 465 S.E.2d 130,\r\n132-33 (Ct. App. 1995) (upon Wife's challenge to the timeliness of a Rule 59(e)\r\nmotion, the family court found Husband had produced credible evidence of the\r\nmotion's timeliness; on appeal, the court of appeals upheld the family court's\r\nimplicit credibility determination that the motion was timely served). We affirm\r\nthe family court's finding that Husband's Rule 59(e) motion was untimely.\r\n\r\nHusband filed and served his appeal from the family court's May 6, 2010 order on\r\nSeptember 2, 2010. A timely post-trial motion stays the time for appeal; however,\r\nan untimely post-trial motion does not stay the time for appeal. Canal Ins. Co. v.\r\nCaldwell, 338 S.C. 1, 5, 524 S.E.2d 416, 418 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\n              When seeking review of a family court's order, a notice\r\n              of appeal must be served on all respondents within thirty\r\n              days after receipt of written notice of the order or\r\n              judgment. Service of the notice of appeal is a\r\n              'jurisdictional requirement, and this Court has no\r\n              authority to extend or expand the time in which the\r\n              notice of intent to appeal must be served.' A timely post-\r\n              trial motion, including a motion to alter or amend the\r\n\r\n1   On May 6, 2010, Jack Cordray was counsel of record for Husband.\r\n\n             judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, stays the time\r\n             for an appeal for all parties until receipt of written notice\r\n             of entry of the order granting or denying such motion.\r\n\r\nCamp v. Camp, 386 S.C. 571, 574-75, 689 S.E.2d 634, 636 (2010) (citations\r\nomitted); see also State v. Cooper, 342 S.C. 389, 397, 536 S.E.2d 870, 875 (2000)\r\n(\"When either party files a timely Rule 59, SCRCP motion, the time to appeal for\r\nall parties is stayed until the motion is resolved.\"). Because this court has no\r\njurisdiction over Husband's appeal of the family court's May 6, 2010 order, we\r\ndismiss Husband's appeal.\r\n\r\n3.     As to Husband's estoppel argument, we find this issue unpreserved because\r\nHusband failed to raise this issue to the family court. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,\r\n330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"It is axiomatic that an issue cannot\r\nbe raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon\r\nby the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.\"); see also Jean Hoefer\r\nToal, et al., Appellate Practice in South Carolina 57 (2d ed. 2002) (\"There are four\r\nbasic requirements to preserving issues at trial for appellate review. The issue\r\nmust have been (1) raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, (2) raised by the\r\nappellant, (3) raised in a timely manner, and (4) raised to the trial court with\r\nsufficient specificity.\").\r\n\r\n4.     As to whether the family court erred in denying Wife's request for $6,638.65\r\nin attorney's fees incurred in responding to Husband's post-trial motion, we\r\nreverse. See Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 645, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534 (Ct. App.\r\n1998) (\"In determining whether to award attorney's fees, the court should consider\r\neach party's ability to pay his or her own fee; the beneficial results obtained by the\r\nattorney; the parties' respective financial conditions; and the effect of the attorney's\r\nfee on each party's standard of living.\" (citing E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415\r\nS.E.2d 812 (1992))). In reversing, we note the family court's extensive\r\nconsideration of these factors in its May 6, 2010 order. Furthermore, we note Wife\r\nprevailed in her efforts to show that Husband's Rule 59(e) motion was untimely.\r\nAccordingly, we award Wife attorney's fees of $6,638.65.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART, and REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nPIEPER, KONDUROS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-489","title":"Jennifer K. v.

Urquhart, both of Law Office of Thomas F.\r\n             McDow, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this divorce action, Jennifer K. (Mother) argues the family\r\ncourt erred in: (1) finding Robert K. (Father) did not sexually abuse one of their\r\n\nchildren; (2) awarding custody of the children to Father; (3) restricting Mother's\r\nphone contact with the children; (4) apportioning the marital debt; and (5)\r\nawarding Father attorney's fees. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                                      FACTS\r\n\r\nMother and Father were married in October 2004 and separated in April 2008.\r\nThey had two children at the time of their separation: a three-year-old daughter and\r\na one-year-old daughter (collectively, Children). After Mother and Father\r\nseparated, Mother and Children moved to Charlotte, North Carolina to live with\r\nMother's mother. Father continued to reside in the marital home in Rock Hill; he\r\nhad visitation with Children every other weekend.\r\n\r\nOn June 4, 2008, Mother filed a complaint seeking separate maintenance, custody,\r\nequitable distribution of property, attorney's fees, and other relief. Father filed an\r\nanswer and counterclaim seeking dismissal of Mother's complaint and a divorce on\r\nthe ground of Mother's adultery. He additionally sought custody of Children,\r\nrestricted visitation between Children and Mother, equitable distribution of marital\r\nproperty, attorney's fees, the appointment of a guardian ad litem (GAL), and other\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nOn July 18, 2008, Mother's mother notified Mother the older child (Child), then\r\nage three, had told her, \"Daddy touched my bottom with a stick.\" Thereafter,\r\nMother questioned Child, who told her Father had \"touched her bottom way up to\r\nher belly\" with a stick. Mother then examined Child and noted her vaginal and\r\nanal areas were red. Subsequently, Child was examined by her pediatrician, Dr.\r\nWendy Baker. Dr. Baker noted Child's vaginal area to be intact. After the medical\r\nexam, Dr. Baker reported the case to the North Carolina Division of Social\r\nServices (NCDSS) as a \"possible sexual assault.\"\r\n\r\nUpon referral from NCDSS, a forensic interview and medical examination were\r\nscheduled with Pat's Place Child Advocacy Center. On July 30, 2008, Child was\r\ninterviewed by Christopher Ragsdale, MSW, LCSW. During the interview, Child\r\ndenied that Father had touched her inappropriately. Furthermore, the medical\r\nexaminer found no indication of sexual abuse.\r\n\r\nA temporary hearing was held on August 6, 2008, to determine temporary custody\r\nof Children. At that time, Mother informed the court of the sexual abuse\r\nallegations against Father and the pending investigation by NCDSS. Due to these\r\n\nallegations, the court issued a temporary order awarding Mother custody of\r\nChildren. The order appointed April Counterman as GAL. Additionally, the court\r\nordered Father to have no contact with Children until further order by the court.\r\n\r\nOn September 2, 2008, NCDSS determined the allegations of sexual abuse were\r\nunfounded and closed the investigation file. Additionally, the York County\r\nSolicitor's Office and the Tega Cay Police Department closed the case after an\r\nextensive review of the forensic evidence. Thereafter, Mother informed the Tega\r\nCay Police Department that Child had disclosed to an employee at her daycare that\r\nFather touched her inappropriately with a stick. Detective Harry Spence advised\r\nMother to contact the Dickerson Center for Children.\r\n\r\nOn October 15, 2008, Child met with Lysa Miller-DuPre, LMSW, at the Dickerson\r\nCenter. Child reported to Miller-DuPre that Father had touched her vaginal area\r\nwith a stick that he got \"off the ground.\" When asked where Father got the stick,\r\nChild responded \"in his pants.\" Due to the inconsistencies in Child's statements,\r\nMiller-DuPre recommended an evaluation by a therapist who specialized in\r\nevaluating sexual abuse cases.\r\n\r\nChild began attending play therapy sessions with Caroline McCloud, MSW, LCSW\r\nin October 2008.1 Child told McCloud that Father touched her vaginal area with\r\n\"an actual stick.\" McCloud believed Child's allegation of abuse against Father; she\r\nalso believed Child met the requirements of having post-traumatic stress disorder.\r\nMcCloud recommended Child not have further contact with Father.\r\n\r\nIn an order dated December 31, 2008, the family court ordered psychologists, Drs.\r\nWilliam and Madalyn Tyson, to evaluate Child, Father, and Mother. Dr. Madalyn\r\nTyson met with Child for six clinical interviews. Additionally, Father and Mother\r\nindividually met with Dr. William Tyson for a series of clinical interviews. Drs.\r\nTyson and Tyson also met with McCloud. Based on their psychological\r\nevaluations and review of the files, Drs. Tyson and Tyson found the occurrence of\r\nsexual abuse was unlikely.\r\n\r\nThe final hearings were held on November 30, December 1, December 2,\r\nDecember 3, December 11, 2009, and February 4, 2010. In an order issued on\r\nMarch 12, 2010, the family court granted Father a divorce on the ground of\r\n\r\n1Child attended play therapy sessions with McCloud from October 2008 to\r\nNovember 2009.\r\n\nMother's adultery.2 The family court found Child was not sexually or otherwise\r\nabused by Father; thereafter, the court awarded Father custody of Children,\r\nestablished a standard visitation schedule with modified phone contact, obligated\r\nMother to pay Father child support, equitably apportioned the marital estate, and\r\nrequired Mother to pay $9,000 towards Father's attorney's fees of $34,688.64. This\r\nappeal followed.            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de\r\nnovo. Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011).\r\nAlthough this court reviews the family court's findings de novo, \"[it] is not\r\nrequired to disregard the findings of the trial judge who was in a superior position\r\nto make credibility determinations.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 385, 709 S.E.2d\r\n650, 651-52 (2011). Further, the burden is upon the appellant to convince this\r\ncourt that the family court erred in its findings. Id. at 385, 709 S.E.2d at 652.\r\n                               ISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n1. Did the family court err in finding Father did not sexually abuse Child?\r\n\r\n2. Did the family court err in awarding custody of Children to Father and\r\n   restricting Mother's phone contact?\r\n\r\n3. Did the family court err in dividing the marital debts?\r\n\r\n4. Did the family court err in failing to make the requisite findings of fact on\r\n   which to base the award of attorney's fees?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2The family court issued an amended divorce and custody order on September 21,\r\n2010 to correct factual errors regarding Mother's place of residence; the amended\r\ndecree also added a finding that reconciliation between the parties was not\r\npossible.\r\n\n                                  LAW/ANALYSIS\n\r\n\r\nI. Sexual Abuse Allegations\r\n\r\nMother argues the family court erred by finding Father had not sexually abused\r\nChild. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\"[C]onsistent with our constitutional authority for de novo review, an appellant is\r\nnot relieved of his burden to demonstrate error in the family court's findings of\r\nfact.\" Lewis, 392 S.C. at 392, 709 S.E.2d at 655. \"Consequently, the family\r\ncourt's factual findings will be affirmed unless 'appellant satisfies this court that the\r\npreponderance of the evidence is against the finding of the [family] court.'\" Id.\r\n(quoting Finley v. Cartwright, 55 S.C. 198, 202, 33 S.E. 359, 360-61 (1899)).\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, the family court properly considered the evidence regarding the\r\nvalidity of Child's sexual abuse allegation. Neither Dr. Baker nor the medical\r\nexaminer found any signs of sexual abuse. Furthermore, NCDSS deemed the case\r\nunfounded and closed the case file after a complete investigation. Moreover, the\r\nYork County Solicitor's Office closed the case after an extensive review of the\r\nforensic evidence. Additionally, Drs. Tyson and Tyson both testified the\r\noccurrence of sexual abuse appeared unlikely. Despite the battery of interviews\r\nand examinations conducted in this case, there was no definitive psychological or\r\nmedical evidence presented at trial that Child was sexually abused. Accordingly,\r\nwe affirm the family court's finding that Father did not sexually abuse Child.\r\n\r\nII. Bests Interests of the Children\r\n\r\n   A. Custody\r\n\r\nMother contends the family court erred in awarding Father custody of Children.\r\nWe affirm.\r\n\r\nIn considering the best interest of Children, we take note of several facts. Mother\r\ntestified that, while married to Father, she exposed Children to her paramour.\r\nMother admitted that she went out to a sports bar for several hours, leaving\r\nChildren unattended while a neighbor listened out for them on a baby monitor. See\r\nDavis v. Davis, 356 S.C. 132, 135, 588 S.E.2d 102, 103-04 (2003) (holding that in\r\na child custody case the best interest of the child is the paramount and controlling\r\nfactor); see also Brown v. Brown, 362 S.C. 85, 91, 606 S.E.2d 785, 788 (Ct. App.\r\n\n2004) (holding the court may consider the morality of a parent in determining\r\ncustody of children when it is relevant \"either directly or indirectly, to the welfare\r\nof the child\"). Furthermore, Mother testified that, if awarded custody, she would\r\ninform Child the judge was making Child visit Father. See Morehouse v.\r\nMorehouse, 317 S.C. 222, 226-27, 452 S.E.2d 632, 634-35 (Ct. App. 1994)\r\n(upholding an award of custody to father when mother was unwilling to encourage\r\na relationship between the child and father). Additionally, the family court found\r\nMother acted inappropriately during Father's supervised visits with Children. See\r\nWatson v. Poole, 329 S.C. 232, 239, 495 S.E.2d 236, 240 (Ct. App. 1997) (granting\r\ncustody to father based, in part, on mother’s unwillingness to facilitate the child’s\r\nvisitation with the father). Accordingly, we find the family court did not err in\r\nawarding Father custody of Children.\r\n\r\n   B. Visitation\r\n\r\nMother claims the family court erred in restricting Mother's phone contact with\r\nChildren. We affirm.\r\n\r\nInitially, we note this issue is not preserved for our review. See Ellie, Inc. v.\r\nMiccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 99, 594 S.E.2d 485, 496 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding that when\r\nan issue is not argued within the body of the brief, but is only a short, conclusory\r\nstatement, it is abandoned on appeal). However, we address this issue, because\r\n\"procedural rules are subservient to the court's duty to zealously guard the rights of\r\nminors.\" Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 107, 536 S.E.2d 372, 374\r\n(2000).\r\n\r\nHere, Mother sent a cell phone with Child during a November 2009 visit. In\r\naddition, Mother repeatedly called Father's parents' home during a December 2009\r\nvisit. In limiting Mother's phone contact with Children, the family court properly\r\nconsidered Mother's previous abuse of phone communication. See Woodall v.\r\nWoodall, 322 S.C. 7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996) (\"When awarding visitation,\r\nthe controlling consideration is the welfare and best interest of the child.\" (citations\r\nomitted)); Frye v. Frye, 323 S.C. 72, 76, 448 S.E.2d 586, 588 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"A\r\nfamily court may impose upon a noncustodial parent such conditions and\r\nrestrictions on his visitation privileges as the court, in its discretion, thinks\r\nproper.\"). Therefore, we affirm the family court's modification of the standard\r\nvisitation schedule.\r\n\nIII. Equitable Distribution\r\n\r\nMother argues the family court failed to weigh and consider each of the fifteen\r\nequitable apportionment factors in rendering its judgment. Specifically, Mother\r\ncontends the family court failed to consider Father's economic misconduct in\r\nequitably dividing the marital assets. We affirm.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the family court's order that the court was cognizant of the\r\nrequired equitable distribution factors. See Pirayesh v. Pirayesh, 359 S.C. 284,\r\n300, 596 S.E.2d 505, 514 (Ct. App. 2004) (\"[O]ur focus is on whether the family\r\ncourt addressed the statutory factors governing apportionment with sufficiency for\r\nus to conclude that the court was cognizant of these factors.\"). Furthermore,\r\nMother acknowledged the mortgage debt was marital debt. No evidence was\r\npresented to suggest that Father's accumulation of mortgage debt constituted\r\nmisconduct. See McDavid v. McDavid, 333 S.C. 490, 496, 511 S.E.2d 365, 368\r\n(1999) (\"[W]e hold poor business decisions, in and of themselves, do not warrant a\r\nfinding of marital, 'misconduct' and that there must be some evidence of willful\r\nmisconduct, bad faith, intention to dissipate marital assets, or the like, before a\r\ncourt may alter the equitable distribution award for such misconduct.\").\r\nAccordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion when apportioning the\r\nmarital debt.\r\n\r\nIV. Attorney's Fees\r\n\r\nMother contends the family court erred in ordering her to pay $9,000 towards\r\nFather's attorney's fees. According to Mother, the family court failed to\r\nappropriately weigh and consider the E.D.M. and Glasscock factors in awarding\r\nattorney's fees to Father. See E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d\r\n812, 816 (1992); Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315\r\n(1991). We affirm.\r\n\r\nHere, the family court set forth specific findings of fact for each of the E.D.M. and\r\nGlasscock factors. See Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534-\r\n35 (Ct. App. 1998) (noting the family court order awarding attorney's fees must set\r\nforth specific findings of fact for each of the required factors). Accordingly, we\r\nfind the family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding Father attorney's fees.\r\nSee Lewis, 392 S.C. at 394, 709 S.E.2d at 656 (holding the decision to award\r\nattorney's fees is within the family court's sound discretion).\r\n\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nPIEPER, KONDUROS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-490","title":"Myers v.

Richter, Jr., both\r\n            of The Richter Firm, LLC, of Mount Pleasant, for\r\n            Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Joseph L. Myers, III, appeals the trial court's determination that\r\n183 acres owned by JKM Holdings, Inc. (JKM), which had been previously used\r\n\nas a golf course, can be used for purposes other than recreation. On appeal, Myers\r\nargues (1) the restriction and covenants create a conservation easement, (2) the\r\ndeed and covenants restrict development, (3) the elements of promissory estoppel\r\nwere met, and (4) JKM holds the property in trust for the residents of Snee Farm.\r\nWe affirm the trial court.\r\n\r\n1. As to whether a conservation easement exists, we find this issue is not\r\n   preserved for review. This issue was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the\r\n   trial court. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733\r\n   (1998) (noting to be preserved for review, an issue must be raised to and ruled\r\n   upon by the trial judge); id. (finding an issue cannot be raised for the first time\r\n   on appeal).\r\n\r\n2. As to whether the trial court erred in determining the deed and covenants allow\r\n   development on the 183 acres, we find the supreme court's decision in\r\n   Stylecraft, Inc. v. Thomas, 250 S.C. 495, 159 S.E.2d 46 (1968), controlling.\r\n   Here, as in Stylecraft, the granting clause conveys a fee simple absolute. Even\r\n   though the intent of the grantor was to maintain the conveyed property as\r\n   recreational, the subsequent language in the deed conditioning any potential\r\n   inconsistent use with a right of re-entry improperly cuts down the estate; thus, it\r\n   is ineffective pursuant to Stylecraft. The granting clause of the deed and the\r\n   covenants, as incorporated, do not expressly prevent future development on the\r\n   183 acres. See id., 250 S.C. 495, 498, 159 S.E.2d 46, 47 (\"In a long and\r\n   unbroken line of decisions this court has approved the rule that where the\r\n   granting clause in a deed purports to convey title in fee simple absolute that\r\n   estate may not be cut down by subsequent words in the same instrument.\");\r\n   Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 166, 631 S.E.2d 539, 542 (2006) (noting courts\r\n   should strictly construe restrictive covenants, with all doubts resolved in favor\r\n   of the free use of the property); Matsell v. Crowfield Plantation Cmty. Servs.\r\n   Ass'n, Inc., 393 S.C. 65, 71, 710 S.E.2d 90, 93 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"Words of a\r\n   restrictive covenant will be given the common, ordinary meaning attributed to\r\n   them at the time of their execution.\"); Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498\r\n   S.E.2d 862, 864 (1998) (\"The court may not limit a restriction in a deed, nor, on\r\n   the other hand, will a restriction be enlarged or extended by construction or\r\n   implication beyond the clear meaning of its terms even to accomplish what it\r\n   may be thought the parties would have desired had a situation which later\r\n   developed been foreseen by them at the time when the restriction was\r\n   written.\"); id. (\"It is still the settled rule in this jurisdiction that restrictions as to\r\n   the use of real estate should be strictly construed and all doubts resolved in\r\n   favor of free use of the property . . . .\").\r\n\n3. As to whether Myers is entitled to relief under a theory of promissory estoppel,\r\n   we find Myers failed to establish a promise made by either Snee Farm, Inc. or\r\n   JKM. See Stevens & Wilkinson of S.C., Inc. v. City of Columbia, 396 S.C. 338,\r\n   348, 721 S.E.2d 455, 460 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"To recover for promissory estoppel,\r\n   a plaintiff must prove the following: (1) a party made a promise unambiguous\r\n   in its terms; (2) the party to whom the promise is made reasonably relied on the\r\n   promise; (3) the reliance was expected and foreseeable by the party who made\r\n   the promise; and (4) the party to whom the promise is made sustained injury in\r\n   reliance on the promise.\"); Craft v. S. C. Comm'n for Blind, 385 S.C. 560, 565,\r\n   685 S.E.2d 625, 627 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding to recover under a theory of\r\n   promissory estoppel a party must demonstrate each element of promissory\r\n   estoppel).\r\n\r\n4. As to whether evidence in the record establishes JKM holds the 183 acres for\r\n   the benefit of Snee Farm residents, we find Myers failed to demonstrate JKM\r\n   holds the 183 acres in trust for the residents. See Regions Bank v. Schmauch,\r\n   354 S.C. 648, 670, 582 S.E.2d 432, 444 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"A fiduciary\r\n   relationship exists when one reposes special confidence in another, so that the\r\n   latter, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due\r\n   regard to the interests of the one reposing confidence.\") (quoting O'Shea v.\r\n   Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 15, 416 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1992)); Steele v.

Valenta, Jr., Linda Annette Grice, and Philip S.\r\n        Porter, all of the South Carolina Department of Motor\r\n        Vehicles, of Blythewood, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Sabina Animas appeals the order of the Administrative Law\r\nCourt (ALC) affirming the Department of Motor Vehicles' suspension of her\r\ndriver's license. On appeal, Animas argues the ALC erred in (1) finding section\r\n17-1-40 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) was not applicable to the driving\r\nunder the influence (DUI) charge and (2) admitting documents relating to her DUI\r\ncharge as evidence to support the suspension. We affirm1 pursuant to Rule 220(b),\r\nSCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.     As to whether the ALC erred in finding section 17-1-40 does not apply to\r\nthe DUI charge: S.C. Code Ann. § 17-1-40(A) (Supp. 2011) (\"A person who after\r\nbeing charged with a criminal offense and the charge is discharged . . . [or]\r\nproceedings against the person are dismissed . . . the arrest and booking record,\r\nfiles, mug shots, and fingerprints of the person must be destroyed and no evidence\r\nof the record pertaining to the charge may be retained by any municipal, county, or\r\nstate law enforcement agency.\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 17-1-40(C) (Supp. 2011)\r\n(providing this section does not apply to violations of Title 56); State v. Jacobs,\r\n393 S.C. 584, 587, 713 S.E.2d 621, 622 (2011) (\"Where the statute's language is\r\nplain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of\r\nstatutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another\r\nmeaning.\" (citation and quotation marks omitted)).\r\n\r\n2.       As to whether the ALC erred in affirming the suspension of Animas's\r\ndriver's license: Taylor v. S.C. Dep't of Motor Vehicles, 368 S.C. 33, 35-36, 627\r\nS.E.2d 751, 752 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"The findings of an administrative agency are\r\npresumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.\r\nSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed\r\nblindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as\r\na whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative\r\nagency reached in order to justify its action.\" (citation and quotation marks\r\nomitted)); S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2951(A) (Supp. 2011) (\"The Department of\r\nMotor Vehicles must suspend the driver's license . . . of . . . a person who drives a\r\nmotor vehicle and refuses to submit to a test provided for in Section 56-5-2950\r\n. . . .\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2951(F)(1-3) (Supp. 2011) (\"An administrative\r\nhearing must be held after the request for the hearing is received\" and the \"hearing\r\nis limited to whether the person: (1) was lawfully arrested or detained; (2) was\r\ngiven a written copy of and verbally informed of the rights . . . ; [and] (3) refused\r\nto submit to a test . . . .\").\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
