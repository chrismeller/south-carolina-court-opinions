Â We dismiss the appeal.[1]\r\nCypress,\r\n  a firefighter with the City of Charleston, collapsed after suffering from heat\r\n  exhaustion during a training exercise on August 4, 2007.Â  Cypress subsequently\r\n  filed a Form 50.Â  The Single Commissioner found Cypress suffered a &quot;14%\r\n  permanent partial disability of the whole person&quot; and awarded him workers'\r\n  compensation benefits pursuant to section 42-9-30.Â  The Appellate Panel\r\n  reversed and remanded the order of the Single Commissioner.Â  The Appellate\r\n  Panel held a &quot;whole person&quot; disability is not an enumerated scheduled\r\n  member under section 42-9-30, and as a result, the Single Commissioner's order\r\n  was affected by an error of law.Â  The Appellate Panel remanded the issue of\r\n  whether Cypress sustained wage loss under section 42-9-20 to the Single\r\n  Commissioner.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the Appellate Panel reversed and remanded the Single Commissioner's order for\r\n  further proceedings on the merits, we dismiss this appeal as not immediately\r\n  appealable.Â  Long v.

Brown (Husband)\r\n  prior to the marriage had not been transmuted into marital property and Wife\r\n  did not have a special equity in the Pasture Property. Â Wife also argues the\r\n  family court erred in failing to order the return to her of certain items of\r\n  personal property. Â We affirm as to the Pasture Property and reverse as to the\r\n  personal property.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe parties were married on\r\n  November 16, 1982.Â  They separated on December 28, 2006.Â  At the time of the\r\n  separation, Wife was 80 years old and Husband was 87.[1]Â \r\n  Wife has four living children, including Defendant Sharon Smith, from a\r\n  previous marriage.Â  Husband also has four children from a previous marriage.Â \r\n  They had no children together.Â  \r\nHusband retired from\r\n  Wellington Mills in 1984.Â  He had purchased the 122-acre Pasture Property in\r\n  1947 for $3,000.Â  He kept cattle on the Pasture Property until 1998, when he\r\n  sold the cattle to his son Robert.Â  Wife worked for Bi-Lo until she had to\r\n  retire due to health reasons in 2007. Â During the marriage, the parties maintained\r\n  separate bank accounts.Â  One of Wife's accounts was a joint account with\r\n  Smith.Â  Wife paid for her car, insurance, her own medical expenses, and some\r\n  groceries with her account.Â  Husband paid the taxes and insurance on the house\r\n  and Pasture Property, phone, utilities, his medical expenses, and most of the\r\n  groceries from his account.Â  While they were married, the parties lived in the\r\n  house Husband inherited in 1978.Â  Wife contributed to numerous improvements\r\n  made to the house.Â  \r\nWife decided in early\r\n  December to separate from Husband after he told her to leave.Â  In preparation\r\n  for the separation, Wife purchased a mobile home, a freezer, a refrigerator,\r\n  and a stove.Â  In January, Wife transferred most of the money from the joint\r\n  account with Smith to an account solely in Smith's name and purchased a\r\n  certificate of deposit (cd) in Smith's name with the remaining $10,000.Â  Wife\r\n  acknowledged Smith had not contributed to the funds in the joint account. Â When\r\n  Wife left on December 28, she took a considerable amount of personal property.Â \r\n  She returned on a later date to retrieve more items of personal property.Â  \r\nHusband brought this action\r\n  on January 11, 2007.Â  After a hearing, the family court held the marital\r\n  residence, which had a value of $45,000, had been transmuted into marital\r\n  property.Â  However, it held the Pasture Property was non-marital and Wife did\r\n  not have a special equity in the property.Â  The court found the funds in the\r\n  account in Smith's name, as well as the cd, were marital property and credited\r\n  Wife with these funds.Â  The court held each party would keep ownership and\r\n  possession of the household goods in his or her possession. Â The court awarded\r\n  Wife attorney's fees.Â  Wife filed a motion to alter or amend, which the family\r\n  court denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family\r\n  court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de novo. Â Simmons v.\r\n  Simmons, Op. No. 26970 (S.C. Sup.Ct. filed May 9, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh.\r\n  No. 16 at 27, 29); see Lewis v. Lewis, Op. No. 26973 (S.C. Sup.Ct.\r\n  filed May 9, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 41, 44). Â Although this court\r\n  reviews the family court's findings de novo, we are not required to ignore the\r\n  fact that the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony. Â Lewis, at 46â€“48. Â The burden is upon the appellant to\r\n  convince this court that the family court erred in its findings. Â Id. at\r\n  51.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Pasture Property\r\nWife argues the family court\r\n  erred in failing to find the Pasture Property had been transmuted into marital\r\n  property or that she had a special equity interest in the property.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nProperty acquired prior to\r\n  the marriage is generally considered nonmarital. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A)(2)\r\n  (Supp. 2010).Â  In addition, marital property does not include &quot;any\r\n  increase in value in nonmarital property, except to the extent that the\r\n  increase resulted directly or indirectly from efforts of the other spouse\r\n  during marriage.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A)(5) (Supp. 2010).Â  A\r\n  non-owner spouse has a special equity interest in any increase in value of nonmarital\r\n  property resulting from that spouse's material contribution. Â Murray v.\r\n  Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 159, 439 S.E.2d 312, 316 (Ct. App. 1993). \r\nIn addition, even if property\r\n  is nonmarital, it may be transmuted into marital property during the marriage. Â Johnson\r\n  v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988). Â The\r\n  spouse claiming nonmarital property has been transmuted must produce objective\r\n  evidence showing the parties themselves regarded the property as the common\r\n  property of the marriage during the marriage.Â  Id. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at\r\n  110-11. Evidence of transmutation includes jointly titling the property, using\r\n  the property exclusively for marital purposes, commingling the property with\r\n  marital property so that it becomes untraceable, or using marital funds to\r\n  build equity in the property. Â Id. at 295, 372 S.E.2d at 111. Â &quot;The\r\n  mere use of separate property to support the marriage, without some additional\r\n  evidence of intent to treat it as property of the marriage, is not sufficient\r\n  to establish transmutation.&quot; Â Id. at 295-96, 372 S.E.2d at 111.\r\n  Whether property has been transmuted into marital property is a matter of\r\n  intent to be determined from the facts of each case. Â Simpson v. Simpson,\r\n  377 S.C. 527, 538, 660 S.E.2d 278, 284 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  \r\nHusband purchased the Pasture\r\n  Property in 1947 for $3,000.Â  An appraiser valued the property at $383,000 at\r\n  the time of the hearing.Â  The Pasture Property was fenced and Husband kept\r\n  cattle on it.Â  In 1998, Husband's son purchased the cattle from Husband for\r\n  $10,000 and took over the duties of caring for the cattle and the property.Â  Husband\r\n  never had any debt on the Pasture Property during the marriage.Â  In addition,\r\n  he paid all of the taxes and insurance on the Pasture Property from his\r\n  account.Â  The Pasture Property was titled solely in his name and Husband had\r\n  devised the Pasture Property to his children in his will.Â  Wife acknowledged\r\n  Husband never indicated he would transfer the Pasture Property into her name.Â \r\n  She also acknowledged that for years, his will provided the Pasture Property\r\n  would go to his children.Â  \r\nWife claimed she shared in\r\n  the care of the cattle.Â  She testified she went with Husband at least twice a\r\n  day to check on the cattle.Â  In addition she stated she accompanied Husband\r\n  when taking the cows to market.Â  When Husband was in the hospital, Wife and\r\n  Smith cared for the cattle.Â  Wife's son testified Husband and Wife always\r\n  worked on the Property together.Â  Reverend Samuel Duncan testified that he\r\n  frequently visited the parties' home during marriage.Â  He stated that often\r\n  when he arrived at the house, they would not be home.Â  They would later\r\n  apologize and explain they had been working at the farm. Â However, he\r\n  acknowledged he did not know what chores Wife did at the farm. Â Dr. Andrew\r\n  Singer, the veterinarian who treated the cattle, stated Wife was always with\r\n  Husband when he brought cattle to the practice.Â  Wife helped load and unload\r\n  the cattle and went inside to make the payments. Â He stated during the later\r\n  years, he dealt exclusively with her while Husband stood by the truck.Â  \r\nIn contrast, Husband\r\n  testified Wife did not work with him on the Pasture Property.Â  He stated that\r\n  when Wife accompanied him to the property, she simply watched him work.Â \r\n  Husband's son Robert testified Husband did all of the work on the Pasture Property\r\n  with Robert's occasional help.Â  Robert testified Wife often stayed in the truck\r\n  when the parties drove to the Property.Â  Sheila Loftis, who lived near the\r\n  Pasture Property, testified she only saw Husband and Robert working on the\r\n  property.Â  She never saw Wife working there.Â  Similarly, another neighbor who lived\r\n  near the Pasture Property stated in an affidavit that he had never seen Wife on\r\n  the property.Â  \r\nWe find the record supports\r\n  the family court's rulings that the Pasture Property had not been transmuted\r\n  and Wife did not have a special equity in the property.Â  Husband manifested no\r\n  intent to share the Pasture Property with Wife.Â  Wife made no financial\r\n  contributions to the Pasture Property and Husband paid for all taxes and\r\n  insurance on the Property from his separate account.Â  Although the property had\r\n  significantly increased in value, the increase was due mainly to changes in the\r\n  market conditions according to the appraiser.Â  While the good condition of the\r\n  property also added to the value, the evidence of Wife's non-financial\r\n  contributions to the property is contradictory.Â  As the family court was in a\r\n  better position to judge the credibility of the witnesses, we find the court\r\n  did not err in ruling Wife had no interest in the Pasture Property.Â  \r\n2.Â  Personal Property\r\nWife argues the family court\r\n  erred in failing to order the return of Wife's nonmarital property that is\r\n  located at the marital residence.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAs stated above, property acquired\r\n  prior to the marriage is generally considered nonmarital.Â  Â§ 20-3-630(A)(2).Â  In\r\n  addition, property acquired by either party by gift from a party other than the\r\n  spouse is considered to be nonmarital.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A)(1) (Supp.\r\n  2010). Â \r\nOn a form entitled Marital\r\n  and Non-Marital Property Subject to Equitable Distribution, Wife listed seven\r\n  items as &quot;Personal property not subject to equitable distribution left at\r\n  marital residence&quot;:Â  \r\nLarge\r\n  Set of Silverware (Gift from my Daughter)\r\nProjector\r\n  and Slides (Personally mine; taken on mission trips to various countries)\r\nPressure\r\n  Cooker (Belongs to Grace Metz)\r\nCuckoo\r\n  Clock (Gift from my son from Germany)\r\nLittle\r\n  Lamp (My son made when he was in School)\r\nDrinking\r\n  Glasses (I brought them from Ohio)\r\nTable\r\n  and 2 Chairs (I brought them from Ohio)\r\nThe family court ordered each\r\n  party was to maintain ownership and possession of the household goods in his or\r\n  her possession.Â  Husband does not contend the above listed items were in fact\r\n  marital property.Â  However, the record is not clear that Husband has possession\r\n  of all of the items on the list.Â  For example, Husband testified Wife left him\r\n  with no tables.Â  To the extent the family court allowed Husband to have\r\n  ownership of any items Wife acquired before the marriage or that were gifted\r\n  solely to her, we find error in its ruling.Â  Husband should return to Wife any\r\n  of these items that he, in fact, does retain in his possession.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the family court's\r\n  ruling that Wife has no interest in the Pasture Property.Â  However, we find the\r\n  family court erred in allowing Husband to retain items of personal property\r\n  that Wife acquired before the marriage or that were gifted solely to her.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nHUFF and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wife was born\r\n  June 5, 1926.Â  Husband was born December 1, 1919.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-368","title":"Fauley v.

Fauley appeals the dismissal of her claim against David S. Weaver, arguing\r\n  the trial court erred in dismissing the action because Weaver's motion to\r\n  dismiss was untimely.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFollowing an automobile\r\n  accident, Fauley attempted to serve Weaver, but was unable to do so.Â  After the\r\n  statute of limitations elapsed, Fauley accomplished service by publication.Â  Weaver\r\n  did not file an answer or motion within thirty days of service by publication.Â \r\n  Several months later, after his insurance carrier was served, Weaver filed a\r\n  motion to dismiss which was followed by Fauley's motion for entry of default.Â \r\n  Weaver subsequently filed a motion to set aside the entry of default.Â  Fauley\r\n  filed returns to both Weaver's motion to dismiss and motion to set aside\r\n  default.Â  After a hearing, the trial court granted Weaver's motions to set\r\n  aside default and to dismiss the case, holding Weaver was not timely and\r\n  properly served.\r\nRule 55(c), SCRCP\r\n  provides that an entry of default may be set aside for good cause. Â A motion under Rule 55(c) is\r\n  addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Â Williams v. Vanvolkenburg,\r\n  312 S.C. 373, 375, 440 S.E.2d 408, 409 (Ct.App. 1994). Â When deciding whether to set aside an\r\n  entry of default, the trial court should consider: (1) the timing\r\n  of the motion for relief; (2) whether the defendant has a meritorious defense;\r\n  and (3) the degree of prejudice to the plaintiff if relief is granted.

Fund and Walker,\r\n  Hunter &amp; Associates, Carrier (collectively Employer) appeal the order of\r\n  the circuit court remanding the case to the Workers' Compensation Commission to\r\n  appoint an additional commissioner for de novo review.Â  We dismiss[1] the appeal because the circuit court's order is not immediately appealable.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nRicky Watts filed a Form 50\r\n  alleging he was injured in a work-related accident on August 9, 2005 when a\r\n  fork-lift operated by another employee collided with the one he was operating.Â \r\n  Watts stated he reported the accident to Employer that same day, reported on\r\n  October 8, 2005 that he was being taken out of work by his doctor, and reported\r\n  on October 20, 2005 that his injuries and medical problems were caused by the\r\n  forklift accident.Â  He explained at the hearing his pain had worsened with\r\n  time.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner held\r\n  Watts had suffered a compensable injury to his lower back on August 9, 2005.Â \r\n  The commissioner noted: &quot;This case boils down to whether [Watts's]\r\n  credibility is such that it can overcome the delay in reporting the injury to\r\n  his supervisor.&quot;Â  \r\nEmployer appealed and in a\r\n  two to one decision, the Appellate Panel reversed.Â  In its order, the Panel\r\n  explained Watts was not a credible witness.Â  It listed the evidence it found to\r\n  support this finding on credibility as:\r\n\r\n  the\r\n    inconsistencies in [Watts's] testimony, his failure to report the injury to the\r\n    Employer, his failure to report the injury to his physicians, his testimony\r\n    regarding the circumstances of his medical problems at the produce stand he\r\n    operates, his conversations with the Employer on his short form disability\r\n    application, and on all the facts and circumstances surrounding this claim,\r\n    including [Watts's] admission that he gave deceptive testimony . . . .\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above\r\n  findings, Commissioner Susan Barden included in the order her own notes as to\r\n  why she found Watts was not credible.Â  These notes provided in part, &quot;Defendants'\r\n  APA [# 14], P. 55 must be compared with [Watts's] APA page 4, in that on the\r\n  [Watts's] version, it appears to the undersigned someone attempted to erase the\r\n  checked 'No' as to whether the condition is work-related.&quot;\r\nWatts appealed to the circuit\r\n  court.Â  The circuit court found the documents referred to by Commissioner\r\n  Barden were two different forms filled out on different dates, not the same\r\n  form, as Commissioner Barden believed.Â  It noted neither party had asserted\r\n  Watts or anyone else had attempted to alter the document.Â  Rather, Commissioner\r\n  Barden had raised the issue herself to support her conclusion that Watts was\r\n  not credible.Â  The circuit court found that due to Commissioner Barden's misperception\r\n  of the documents, her decision was based upon &quot;surmise, speculation, and\r\n  innuendo,&quot; which constituted an error of law.Â  Holding the adage you\r\n  cannot unring the bell applied, the court found Commissioner Barden's review\r\n  would be prejudiced and a de novo hearing was necessary.Â  \r\nHowever, the court also noted\r\n  there was no indication the decision of the other commissioner who voted to\r\n  deny Watts's claim was tainted by the misperception of the documents.Â  Thus,\r\n  the court held as a matter of judicial economy it would not be appropriate to\r\n  remand for a de novo hearing before a full panel.Â  Instead, the circuit court\r\n  ordered Commissioner Barden's decision was reversed and remanded with\r\n  instructions for the commission to appoint another commissioner to review the\r\n  record and enter a decision on the appeal.Â  The Circuit Court allowed the\r\n  decision of the other two commissioners to stand.Â  The court recognized, &quot;Since\r\n  the original decision was a vote of 2 to 1 to reverse the decision of the\r\n  Hearing Commissioner based on the credibility of [Watts], the decision of this\r\n  Hearing Commissioner will determine whether or not the decision of the Hearing\r\n  Commissioner is reversed or is affirmed.&quot;Â  Employer appealed to this\r\n  court.\r\nLAW/ANALYIS\r\nWe hold the circuit court's\r\n  order is not immediately appealable.Â  Our courts &quot;have consistently held\r\n  that an order of the circuit court remanding a case for additional proceedings\r\n  before an administrative agency is not directly appealable.&quot;Â  Montjoy\r\n    v. Asten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 52, 446 S.E.2d 618, 618 (1994).Â  This\r\n  court recently reiterated when the order on appeal remands the case to the\r\n  commission for additional proceedings, the order is not a final judgment and is\r\n  not immediately appealable.Â  Long v. Sealed Air Corp., 391 S.C. 483, 487,\r\n  706 S.E.2d 34, 36 (Ct. App. 2011).Â  The court found support for its decision in Charlotteâ€“Mecklenburg Hospital Authority v. South Carolina Department of\r\n    Health and Environmental Control, 387 S.C. 265, 692 S.E.2d 894 (2010), in\r\n  which the supreme court dismissed an appeal from the Administrative Law Court.Â  Long, 391 S.C. at 485, 706 S.E.2d at 35.Â  \r\n\r\n  In Charlotte-Mecklenburg,\r\n    the supreme court explained:Â  \r\n  If\r\n    there is some further act which must be done by the court prior to a\r\n    determination of the rights of the parties, the order is interlocutory. A\r\n    judgment which determines the applicable law, but leaves open questions of\r\n    fact, is not a final judgment. A final judgment disposes of the whole subject\r\n    matter of the action or terminates the particular proceeding or action, leaving\r\n    nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.\r\n\r\n387\r\n  S.C. at 267, 692 S.E.2d at 894-95 (citations omitted).\r\nDuring the briefing stage of\r\n  this appeal, Watts filed a motion to dismiss, which the court denied.[2]Â \r\n  Employer filed a return to the motion arguing the circuit court's order was\r\n  appealable.Â  The Employer asserted the circuit court did not have the authority\r\n  to dictate the review process of the Commission and the circuit court's review\r\n  was limited to determining whether the Panel's decision was supported by\r\n  substantial evidence in the record.Â  We find Employer's arguments pertain to\r\n  whether the circuit court erred in its remand of the case and not whether its\r\n  order is a final judgment.Â  The order on appeal does not dispose of the whole\r\n  subject matter of the action or terminate the particular proceeding or action.Â \r\n  It is not a final judgment and is not immediately appealable.Â  \r\nEmployer also asserted this\r\n  court should exercise jurisdiction because if it does not review the circuit\r\n  court's unusual remand procedure, the issue might never be reviewed.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  If the Employer remains unsatisfied with the decision on remand, it\r\n  may raise the issue to the court when the final judgment is on appeal.Â  \r\nWe hold the\r\n  circuit court's order is not immediately appealable.Â  Accordingly, the appeal\r\n  is \r\nDISMISSED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide\r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The court did\r\n  not explain its reasoning in denying the motion and did not make a specific\r\n  finding that the order was appealable.Â  Furthermore, &quot;[i]ssues related to\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.&quot; Â In re November\r\n    4, 2008 Bluffton Town Council Election, 385 S.C. 632, 637, 686 S.E.2d 683,\r\n  686 (2009).Â  The lack of subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived, even by\r\n  consent of the parties, and should be taken notice of by the appellate court.Â  Id. Â Accordingly, the court's previous denial of the motion to dismiss does not\r\n  prevent us from now finding the circuit court's order is not immediately\r\n  appealable.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-371","title":"Shealy v.

Nelson, both\r\n          of Mount Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\n        FleetÂ  Freeman, of Mount Pleasant, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Robert\r\n  B. Shealy (Shealy) argues the Master-In-Equity (Master) erred by not awarding him\r\n  $132,000 in brokers' commission fees for 1219 East Ashley Avenue (the Property)\r\n  pursuant to a right of first refusal contract (Refusal Contract) executed by\r\n  Paul E. Shelton.Â  We dismiss the appeal.[1] Â Â \r\nOn February 17, 2003, Shealy\r\n  and Shelton executed an exclusive right to sell listing agreement for 1220 East\r\n  Ashley Avenue in Folly Beach, South Carolina.Â  Pursuant to the terms of the\r\n  agreement, Shealy was entitled to a commission of 4.5% in exchange for securing\r\n  a purchaser. Â Subsequently, Edward Gilbreath purchased 1220 East Ashley Avenue.Â \r\n  In consideration for Gilbreath's purchase, Shelton granted Gilbreath a right of\r\n  first refusal to purchase the Property which neighbored 1220 East Ashley\r\n  Avenue.Â  The Refusal Contract provided, &quot;Bobby Shealy shall be\r\n  deemed the listing agent . . . as to a sale of the Property from Paul E.\r\n    Shelton to Edward Gilbreath.Â  Bobby Shealy shall be deemed\r\n  the listing agent as to any other sale of the Property.&quot;Â  (emphasis in\r\n  original).Â  Shelton died on August 27, 2004, and Shirley Huggins was appointed\r\n  personal representative of his estate (the Estate).[2]Â  \r\nSometime in May or June 2005,\r\n  Gilbreath viewed the Property but declined to purchase it.Â  On July 15, 2005, Shealy\r\n  filed a creditor's claim with the probate court claiming he was entitled to a\r\n  commission of $132,000 or 6% of the Property's $2,200,000 from the Estate.[3]Â \r\n  The Estate disallowed Shealy's creditor's claim on July 29, 2005, and Shealy\r\n  petitioned for allowance of the claim on August 18, 2005.Â  On January 17, 2006,\r\n  Shealy filed a petition for declaratory judgment or specific performance.Â  On\r\n  February 10, 2006, the Estate moved to remove the case to the circuit court,\r\n  and Shealy also moved to remove the case to the circuit court, including his\r\n  creditor's claim.Â  The probate court transferred the case to the circuit court,\r\n  and the circuit court referred the case to the Master.\r\nThe Master concluded (1)\r\n  Shealy lacked standing to bring suit on the recovery of the brokers' commission\r\n  fee because the commission belonged to the real estate agency rather than to Shealy;\r\n  (2) the Refusal Contract was not an enforceable contract, and, as a result Shealy's\r\n  action for breach of contract or breach of contract with fraudulent intent was\r\n  not actionable; (3) the declaratory judgment action was not justiciable because\r\n  there was no enforceable contract declaring Shealy's rights; and (4) Shealy was\r\n  not entitled to specific performance. We dismiss the appeal pursuant to the\r\n  following authorities:Â  Pee Dee Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. Carolina Power &amp;\r\n    Light Co., 279 S.C. 64, 66, 301 S.E.2d 761, 762&nbsp;(1983) (noting an\r\n  issue that is contingent, hypothetical, or abstract is not ripe for review); Park\r\n    v.

Co., 251 S.C. 410, 414, 162 S.E.2d 709, 711&nbsp;(1968)\r\n  (&quot;The courts generally decline to pronounce a declaration in a suit\r\n  wherein the rights of the plaintiff are contingent upon the happening of some\r\n  event which cannot be forecast and which may never take place.&quot;); Springs\r\n    &amp; Davenport, Inc. v. AAG, Inc., 385 S.C. 320, 325, 683 S.E.2d 814, 816\r\n  (Ct. App. 2009) (noting the general rule that a broker earns his commission\r\n  when &quot;he procures a purchaser who is accepted by the owner of the property\r\n  and with whom the latter, uninfluenced by any representation of fraud on the\r\n  part of the broker, enters into a valid and enforceable contract&quot;).\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.\r\nWILLIAMS, GEATHERS, and LOCKEMY, JJ.,\r\n  concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In its motion\r\n  for summary judgment, the Estate asserted it was not the proper party-defendant\r\n  since the Paul E. Shelton Revocable Trust owned the property.Â  Initially, the\r\n  Master granted summary judgment in favor of the Estate.Â  Shealy filed a Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP, motion, and the Master granted Shealy leave to amend his\r\n  complaint to substitute the Paul E. Shelton Revocable Trust as the proper\r\n  defendant.\r\n[3] Shealy\r\n  subsequently claimed he was entitled to a 4.5% commission fee rather than a 6%\r\n  commission fee based on the listing agreement of 1220 East Ashley Avenue.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-372","title":"Underground Boring v.

Bryan, of Surfside Beach, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this breach of contract action, P Mining appeals the trial court's judgment in\r\n  favor of Underground Boring in the amount of $99,041.35 plus $29,369.48 in\r\n  prejudgment interest.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe City of North Myrtle\r\n  Beach (the City) hired P Mining to replace all overhead utility lines with underground\r\n  ones.Â  It provided P Mining with plans and detailed specifications for the\r\n  project.Â  P Mining subcontracted with Underground Boring for boring and\r\n  installation of conduit.Â  The parties entered into a one-page contract, which\r\n  listed the prices for the different sizes of conduit.Â  The contract did not\r\n  specify the depth that the conduit should be buried.Â  The parties subsequently\r\n  agreed to a price adjustment.Â  \r\nAfter Underground Boring\r\n  finished its work, Santee Cooper complained to P Mining that the conduit had not\r\n  been buried deeply enough in some places.Â  On July 29, 2005, Charles Permenter\r\n  with P Mining wrote Donnie Stewart of Underground Boring to inform him P Mining\r\n  would not pay any funds towards the outstanding balance until Stewart met with\r\n  the City and Santee Cooper and they signed off on all of the bores completed.Â \r\n  Stewart testified the meeting was never scheduled. Â P Mining requested\r\n  Underground Boring correct the installation of conduit that had not been buried\r\n  deeply enough in the median of Ocean Boulevard.Â  Stewart stated he was willing\r\n  to make the repair if P Mining paid the remaining funds owed Underground\r\n  Boring.Â  The payment was never forthcoming.Â  Other than the Ocean Boulevard\r\n  location, Stewart never received any written requests identifying particular\r\n  areas P Mining, the City, or Santee Cooper wanted Underground Boring to make corrections.Â  \r\nA dispute also arose between\r\n  the City and P Mining concerning the amount of conduit buried.Â  Because the\r\n  City had concerns about the depth of the conduit, as well as the quantity P\r\n  Mining had billed, it withheld payment from P Mining.Â  P Mining, in turn,\r\n  withheld payment from Underground Boring.Â  \r\nUnderground Boring brought\r\n  this action seeking payment of the balance due of $116,656.35 in addition to\r\n  interest, attorney's fees, and costs.[2]Â \r\n  In its answer, P Mining asserted Underground Boring had breached the contract.Â  \r\nAfter a bench trial, the\r\n  court found Underground Boring was never made aware of any specifications and\r\n  specifically was not told a depth for the borings.Â  The court noted the\r\n  contract between P Mining and Underground Boring did not require a specific\r\n  bury depth, nor did the contract incorporate by reference the terms of the City's\r\n  contract and specifications.Â  Thus it held P Mining was not entitled to a\r\n  setoff for the amounts it claimed it incurred to bury the conduit deeper.Â  The\r\n  trial court also rejected P Mining's contention Underground Boring had\r\n  submitted bills for more than the actual linear footages bored.Â  The court\r\n  further found P Mining was entitled to a set-off for repairs it made to sewer\r\n  lines Underground Boring hit on three separate occasions.Â  Thus, it held\r\n  Underground Boring was owed an unpaid balance of $116,656.35, less the amount\r\n  owed for the repairs by P Mining, leaving an amount of $99,041.35.Â  It denied\r\n  Underground Boring's request for attorney's fees and prejudgment interest.Â  \r\nBoth parties filed motions to\r\n  alter or amend.Â  The court denied P Mining's motion.Â  It also denied\r\n  Underground Boring's motion to the extent it requested attorney's fees and\r\n  interest pursuant to section 27-1-15 of the South Carolina Code (2007), but\r\n  granted prejudgment interest in the amount of $29,369.48 pursuant to section\r\n  34-31-20(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010).Â  It denied the remainder\r\n  of the motion requesting the court exclude the set-offs for the repairs.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;An action for breach of\r\n  contract is an action at law.&quot; Â Electro Lab of Aiken, Inc. v. Sharp\r\n    Constr. Co. of Sumter, Inc., 357 S.C. 363, 367, 593 S.E.2d 170, 172 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).Â  In a law action tried without a jury, this court's review is limited to\r\n  correcting errors of law, and we are required to uphold the trial court's findings\r\n  of fact unless there is no evidence to support them. Â Townes Assocs., Ltd.\r\n    v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85-86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â \r\n  Required Burial Depth\r\nP Mining argues the trial\r\n  court erred in finding Underground Boring was not required to install the\r\n  conduit at a minimum burial depth of three feet.Â  It first contends the court\r\n  erred in finding Underground Boring was never made aware of the requirement set\r\n  forth in the plans and specifications for the project that the conduit be\r\n  installed at a minimum depth of three feet.Â  \r\nThe City's detailed specifications\r\n  for the project provided &quot;Conduit depth must have at least 3' of cover\r\n  over the conduits to meet code.Â  Conduits in areas where proposed and existing\r\n  water, sewer, and drainage exist must be installed at a depth approved by a\r\n  City of North Myrtle Beach inspector on site.&quot;Â  Stewart stated that while\r\n  he was given the plans, he was never provided with the specifications.Â  The\r\n  trial court held, &quot;Based on the testimony presented and the Court's\r\n  viewing of the credibility of the witnesses, the Court specifically finds that\r\n  [Underground Boring] was never made aware of any specifications and\r\n  specifically was not told a depth for the borings.&quot;Â  &quot;Credibility\r\n  determinations regarding testimony are a matter for the finder of fact, who has\r\n  the opportunity to observe the witnesses, and those determinations are entitled\r\n  to great deference on appeal.&quot; Â Okatie River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern\r\n    Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 338, 577 S.E.2d 468, 474 (Ct. App. 2003).Â \r\n  We hold the trial court's finding is supported by the evidence.Â  \r\nP Mining next contends the\r\n  trial court erred in concluding that the contract between P Mining and\r\n  Underground Boring was unambiguous and in refusing to consider parol evidence\r\n  that demonstrated Underground Boring was required to bury the conduit at a minimum\r\n  depth of three feet.Â  \r\n&quot;It is a question of law\r\n  for the court whether the language of a contract is ambiguous.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550\r\n  S.E.2d 299, 302-03 (2001).Â  An ambiguous contract is one that can be understood\r\n  in more ways than just one or is unclear because it expresses its purpose in an\r\n  indefinite manner.Â  Klutts Resort Realty, Inc. v. Down'Round Dev. Corp.,\r\n  268 S.C. 80, 89, 232 S.E.2d 20, 25 (1977). Â &quot;[W]here a contract is\r\n  ambiguous, parol evidence is admissible to ascertain the true meaning and\r\n  intent of the parties.&quot;Â  Penton v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 326\r\n  S.C. 275, 280, 486 S.E.2d 742, 745 (1997).\r\nThe one-page contract did not\r\n  refer to the plans and specifications the City of North Myrtle Beach gave P\r\n  Mining nor did it incorporate by reference the contract between the City of\r\n  North Myrtle Beach and P Mining.Â  As stated above, we find the record supports\r\n  the trial court's ruling that Underground Boring was never made aware of any\r\n  specifications and specifically was not told a depth for the borings. Â As\r\n  Underground Boring was not aware of this requirement, it could not have been\r\n  the intent of the parties to have this requirement in the contract.Â  Thus, even\r\n  if the contract was ambiguous, we find no error in the court's ruling on this\r\n  issue.Â  Â Â Â  \r\nP Mining argues the trial\r\n  court erred in failing to find Underground Boring breached its contract with P\r\n  Mining because Underground Boring did not bury the conduit to the depth\r\n  required.Â  As stated above, the record supports the trial court's finding that the\r\n  contract between the parties did not require a burial depth of three feet.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error in the court's ruling on this issue.Â  \r\nFinally, P Mining argues\r\n  Underground Boring installed the conduit in a manner that not only failed to\r\n  comply with the depth requirements of the plans and specifications for the\r\n  Project, but also failed to comply with the industry standard for minimum\r\n  boring depth.Â  In its order on the parties' motions to alter or amend, the\r\n  trial court reaffirmed its ruling Underground Boring was not in breach.Â  As the\r\n  trial court noted, Stewart testified that where possible, the conduit was\r\n  buried to meet industry standards of thirty to thirty-six inches.Â  However,\r\n  occasionally, because of existing utilities, the bore might be shallower or\r\n  deeper.Â  In both of the examples cited by P Mining in its brief where the\r\n  conduit was not buried deeply enough, an existing storm drain was under the\r\n  conduit.Â  We find no error in the court's ruling on this issue.Â  \r\nB.Â  Quantity of Conduit Installed\r\nP Mining argues the trial\r\n  court erred in finding Underground Boring was entitled to be paid for the\r\n  installation of a total of 47,092 linear feet of conduit.Â  It first contends the\r\n  trial court erred in allowing and considering hearsay evidence of former\r\n  employees of Underground Boring who did not appear at trial.Â  \r\nGenerally, &quot;[t]he\r\n  admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter within the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial court and absent clear abuse, will not be disturbed on appeal.&quot; Â Gamble\r\n    v. Int'l Paper Realty Corp. of S.C., 323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441\r\n  (1996).Â  As an exception to the hearsay rule, the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Evidence provide for the admissibility of records of regularly conducted\r\n  activity.Â  Rule 803(6), SCRE.Â  This rule states the following is admissible:\r\n\r\n  A\r\n    memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events,\r\n    conditions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information\r\n    transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly\r\n    conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that\r\n    business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation,\r\n    all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness,\r\n    unless the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation\r\n    indicate lack of trustworthiness; provided, however, that subjective\r\n    opinions and judgments found in business records are not admissible. Â The term &quot;business&quot;\r\n    as used in this subsection includes business, institution, association,\r\n    profession, occupation, and calling of every kind, whether or not conducted for\r\n    profit.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nP Mining asserts the records\r\n  of the measurements taken by Underground Boring's employees and Underground\r\n  Boring's invoices do not fall within this exception because &quot;the source of\r\n  information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of\r\n  trustworthiness.&quot;Â  \r\nStewart testified that as his\r\n  supervisor Tony Knight finished installing conduit in an area, he would measure\r\n  the area with a measuring wheel.Â  Knight would either submit a written report\r\n  with the measurement or call into the office where Stewart or his secretary\r\n  would record the measurement.Â  The secretary used these measurements in\r\n  preparing the invoices submitted to P Mining.Â  The measurements were also used\r\n  in calculating Knight's payments.Â  Stewart testified he had never received any\r\n  complaint from other jobs about Knight's measurements being excessive.Â  The\r\n  evidence shows the records Underground Boring submitted were kept in the course\r\n  of a regularly conducted business activity and their method of preparation did\r\n  not indicate a lack of trustworthiness.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court\r\n  did not abuse its discretion in admitting the records.Â  \r\nP Mining also argues the\r\n  trial court should have used the linear footage measurement made by a City\r\n  employee.Â  City employee Travis Dupree testified that after the dispute over\r\n  the amount of conduit installed arose, he and P Mining employee Rocky Permenter\r\n  made their own measurements of the project.Â  He stated his measurements\r\n  indicated a total of 44,898 feet.Â  Dupree acknowledged on cross examination he\r\n  had measured the project by himself before measuring it with Permenter.Â \r\n  Although the total of that measurement was only 70 linear feet greater from the\r\n  one measured with Permenter, the measurement of each individual section was\r\n  different.Â  When taking the higher measurement for each section, the total was\r\n  48,399 feet.Â  The trial court noted &quot;P Mining failed to produce testimony\r\n  to explain which of the two measurements for the various sections was correct.&quot;Â  \r\nThe records Underground\r\n  Boring presented into evidence indicated the total footage for its work was\r\n  47,092 feet.Â  As the record contains evidence to support the trial court's\r\n  finding that Underground Boring was entitled to payment for 47,092 linear feet\r\n  of conduit, we find no error in the trial court's ruling.Â  \r\nC.Â  Prejudgment Interest\r\nP Mining argues the trial\r\n  court erred in awarding Underground Boring prejudgment interest.Â  The only\r\n  basis for this argument is its contention that the trial court erred in\r\n  granting a judgment in favor of Underground Boring.Â  As we affirm the judgment,\r\n  we also affirm the award of prejudgment interest.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, SHORT,\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Underground\r\n  Boring originally named as defendants Charles L.

Middleton, of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\n        Deena Smith McRackan, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this appeal from the family court, George Lucas\r\n  (Husband) argues the family court erred in awarding the parties' motor coach to\r\n  Karen Lucas (Wife).Â  Husband also contends the family court abused its\r\n  discretion in awarding attorney's fees to Wife.Â  We affirm in part and reverse\r\n  in part.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nHusband and Wife were married\r\n  in Hawaii on July 2, 1996, and no children were born of the marriage.Â  On the\r\n  date of the final hearing, Husband and Wife were fifty-two years old.Â  Prior to\r\n  the marriage, Husband obtained a degree in horticultural technology from\r\n  a technical college.Â  However, Husband worked as freelance golf photographer\r\n  during their marriage and earned approximately $900 per month. Â Wife is a\r\n  registered nurse and worked in the nursing field for a majority of the parties'\r\n  marriage.Â  During that time, Wife earned between $58,000 and $90,000 per year.Â \r\n  Due to numerous health issues, Wife stopped working as a nurse in 2000 and\r\n  began working as a freelance photographer with Husband. Â After two or three\r\n  years, she resumed working as a nurse, but due to complications caused by her\r\n  medical conditions, she was unemployed on the date of the final hearing.Â  \r\nThe parties lived with\r\n  Husband's elderly mother (Mother) in her home in Charleston, South Carolina,\r\n  during the vast majority of their marriage.Â  During that time, the parties did\r\n  not pay rent, but they paid the bills and helped to maintain the residence.Â  When\r\n  the parties separated in September 2006, Wife moved in with her mother in\r\n  Woodruff, South Carolina.Â  In September 2007, Wife filed for divorce based on\r\n  one year's continuous separation.Â  \r\nOn the date of the final\r\n  hearing, the parties owned no real property. Â Their primary dispute centered around\r\n  two items of personal property, namely a 1994 Georgie Boy Signature Swinger\r\n  motor coach and a Ryder Cup collector's golf club.[1]Â  After hearing testimony from both\r\n  parties, the family court issued a final divorce decree granting the parties a\r\n  divorce based on one year's continuous separation.Â  In its decree, the family\r\n  court found Wife made greater direct and indirect contributions towards the\r\n  acquisition, preservation, and appreciation of the marital estate.Â  As a\r\n  result, it awarded the Ryder Cup golf club to Husband and the motor\r\n  coach to Wife.Â  The family court acknowledged Mother held title to the motor\r\n  coach and had paid off the lien on the motor coach with funds drawn from an\r\n  equity line on Mother's home.Â  However, the family court determined Husband's\r\n  post-filing transfer of title to Mother was in bad faith.Â  Further, the family court\r\n  held that any payment by Mother on the motor coach was either a gift or\r\n  repayment for monies expended mainly by Wife for improvement and upkeep of Mother's\r\n  home.Â  The court also granted Wife's request for alimony in the amount of $500\r\n  per month and her request for attorney's fees and costs in the amount of\r\n  $7,536.08.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family\r\n  court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de novo.Â  Simmons v.\r\n    Simmons, Op. No. 26970 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 9, 2011) (Shearhouse Adv.\r\n  Sh. No. 16 at 29); Lewis v. Lewis, Op. No. 26973 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed\r\n  May 9, 2011) (Shearhouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 44).Â  Although this court reviews\r\n  the family court's findings de novo, we are not required to ignore the fact\r\n  that the trial court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position\r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Lewis, Op. 26973 at 46-48.Â  The burden is upon the appellant\r\n  to convince this court that the family court erred in its findings.Â  Id. at 49-51.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motor Coach\r\nHusband claims the family\r\n  court erred in certain findings of fact, specifically the court's finding that\r\n  Wife made a greater contribution to the acquisition, appreciation, and\r\n  preservation of the marital estate, which it erroneously relied upon in\r\n  determining Wife was entitled to the motor coach.Â  We agree.\r\nAt the final hearing, the\r\n  parties testified they purchased the motor coach for approximately $30,000 in\r\n  2002, by using Mother's home as collateral on the initial loan.Â  The motor\r\n  coach was subsequently paid off in 2005 through an equity line taken out on Mother's\r\n  home. Â Wife did not claim she ever made any payments on the equity line but\r\n  rather stated she had no involvement in the financing of the motor coach or in\r\n  the refinancing of Mother's home.Â  On the other hand, Husband testified he,\r\n  along with Mother and Husband's sister, was responsible for paying the $605\r\n  monthly payment on the equity line.Â  The foregoing evidence indicates Husband\r\n  made a greater contribution to the acquisition of the motor coach. Â Furthermore,\r\n  Wife's valuation for a motor coach of the same make and model reflected a\r\n  decrease in value by almost half since the date of purchase.Â  Her valuation directly\r\n  contradicts the family court's finding that the motor coach appreciated during\r\n  the marriage.Â  Therefore, this finding is not supported by the record. Â \r\nRegarding Wife's contribution\r\n  to the preservation of the motor coach, Wife testified she and Husband made\r\n  substantial repairs to the motor coach.Â  However, Wife never testified she paid\r\n  for these expenses directly out of her salary or that she was solely\r\n  responsible for the insurance that ultimately paid many of the repair costs.Â \r\n  While Wife may have contributed her time and energy in the upkeep and\r\n  maintenance of the motor coach, we find no evidence that her contribution was\r\n  greater than that of Husband.Â  Further, the record demonstrates accounting for\r\n  the depreciation in the motor coach in conjunction with the remaining balance\r\n  on Mother's equity line[2] results in a windfall to Wife.Â  Specifically, Wife's valuation on the date of\r\n  the final hearing for a motor coach of the same make and model ranged from\r\n  $12,485 to $15,075.Â  The outstanding loan on the motor coach, which Mother paid\r\n  off in 2005, totaled $29,520. Â We recognize the motor coach is technically debt\r\n  free because Mother paid off the loan with equity taken out of her home, but we\r\n  find it inequitable to award Wife the motor coach free and clear when the\r\n  resulting indebtedness is greater than the asset's value.[3]Â  Furthermore, we find it\r\n  inequitable to award this asset entirely to Wife without any affirmative proof\r\n  that she contributed to its acquisition or debt reduction, particularly when\r\n  Mother, not Wife, is responsible for repaying that debt. \r\nWife presented no testimony\r\n  she made any payments on the motor coach or on the equity line.Â  Instead, Wife\r\n  testified Husband and Mother financed the motor coach. Â While her failure to\r\n  make payments on the motor coach does not render it nonmarital property, we\r\n  fail to see how an asset completely paid for by Mother and Husband, and for\r\n  which Mother is still indebted, should be awarded to Wife.Â  Cf. Bowen\r\n    v. Bowen, 280 S.C. 602, 604, 313 S.E.2d 362, 364 (Ct. App. 1984) (finding\r\n  family court properly found house was not wife's sole property despite being\r\n  titled in wife's name when husband made all mortgage payments on the house and\r\n  wife's financial contributions were nominal).Â  Further, we disagree with the\r\n  family court's finding that the payoff of the motor coach was either a gift or\r\n  repayment for monies Wife expended to improve the house. Â Neither Wife nor\r\n  Husband ever testified Mother paid off the motor coach as a gift, but instead\r\n  Wife stated Mother participated in financing the motor coach because the\r\n  parties did not have sufficient collateral to secure the purchase of the motor\r\n  coach on their own.[4] Â Additionally, Wife's own testimony indicates the improvements and repairs to Mother's\r\n  house were in lieu of paying rent. Â As a result, we find the family court erred\r\n  when it awarded the motor coach to Wife.Â  We reverse this portion of the family\r\n  court's order.[5]\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorney's Fees\r\nHusband also avers the family\r\n  court erred in awarding attorney's fees to Wife.Â  We disagree.Â  Â \r\nAn award of attorney's fees\r\n  and costs is a discretionary matter not to be overturned absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion by the family court.Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365,\r\n  384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989).Â  To award attorney's fees, the family court should\r\n  consider several factors, including: (1) ability of the party to pay the fees;\r\n  (2) beneficial results obtained; (3) financial conditions of the parties; and\r\n  (4) the effect a fee award will have on the party's standard of living.Â  E.D.M.\r\n    v. T.A.M, 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  \r\nWhile Husband does not\r\n  contest the reasonableness of Wife's attorney's fees,[6] he claims the requisite factors\r\n  from E.D.M. do not support an award of fees to Wife.Â  We disagree and\r\n  find the family court properly considered the appropriate factors in awarding\r\n  Wife attorney's fees.Â  Specifically, the family court concluded Husband had &quot;a\r\n  superior financial condition and ability to pay both his and Wife's fees by\r\n  reason of Wife's emotional and physical health.&quot;Â  Additionally, the family\r\n  court found Wife obtained a beneficial result in the areas she requested relief\r\n  and because Husband had the ability to earn a living whereas Wife did not, the\r\n  imposition of fees against Husband would have a lesser effect on Husband's\r\n  standard of living than that of Wife.Â  \r\nDespite our decision to award\r\n  the motor coach to Husband, we find Wife is entitled to attorney's fees.Â \r\n  First, while both parties' financial declarations reveal that neither party has\r\n  a significant monthly income, Husband, despite being underemployed, was in a\r\n  better financial position on the date of the final hearing to pay Wife's fees.Â \r\n  We recognize Wife's degree in nursing has allowed her to maintain a greater\r\n  earning capacity in the past, which would otherwise increase her ability to pay\r\n  her fees.Â  However, due to Wife's significant health issues, she is currently\r\n  unable to maintain even part-time employment. Â Further, even if Wife was\r\n  gainfully employed, we cannot say an award of fees would be an abuse of\r\n  discretion under the circumstances because each party's ability to pay is but\r\n  one factor to consider in awarding fees.Â  See Harvley v. Harvley,\r\n  279 S.C. 572, 576, 310 S.E.2d 161, 163 (Ct. App. 1983) (finding the fact that\r\n  wife was gainfully employed and husband was unemployed did not deprive wife of\r\n  award of attorney's fees when facts and circumstances of case merited\r\n  imposition of fees against husband).Â Â  \r\nAlthough we alter Wife's\r\n  share of the marital estate, Wife has succeeded in part on other issues.Â \r\n  First, she requested a divorce based on one year's continuous separation and\r\n  resumption of her maiden name, both which the family court granted.Â  Next, she\r\n  sought permanent periodic alimony in the amount of $1,500 per month, and while\r\n  the family court properly determined Husband could not afford to pay this\r\n  amount given his current earnings, Wife succeeded in securing a $500 monthly\r\n  alimony payment.Â  Additionally, Wife is entitled to the car dolly and all other\r\n  personal property specifically granted to Wife in the final order.Â  \r\nOur decision to reverse the\r\n  family court on the motor coach issue does not completely negate Wife's\r\n  beneficial results. Â See Myers v. Myers, 391 S.C. 308, 322, 705\r\n  S.E.2d 86, 94 (Ct. App. 2011) (finding wife was still entitled to a portion of\r\n  her attorney's fees despite partial reversal because she succeeded on other\r\n  issues); Golden v. Gallardo, 295 S.C. 393, 395, 368 S.E.2d 684, 685 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1988) (finding the family court properly awarded the mother a portion of\r\n  her fees and costs in suit brought by father to enforce visitation rights when\r\n  both parties prevailed on some issues).Â  Moreover, as stated earlier, a party's\r\n  success at trial is only one factor to be considered by the court in\r\n  determining whether a party is entitled to attorney's fees. Â See Upchurch\r\n    v. Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 649 (2006) (&quot;Beneficial\r\n  result alone is not dispositive of whether a party is entitled to attorney's\r\n  fees.&quot;); Roberson v. Roberson, 359 S.C. 384, 393, 597 S.E.2d 840,\r\n  844-45 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding wife was entitled to $8,000 in attorney's fees\r\n  because she needed assistance to pay her fees, she succeeded on some of the\r\n  contested issues in divorce, and the attorney's fees would have a greater\r\n  impact on wife than on husband given their financial conditions). Â Â Accordingly,\r\n  we find that under these circumstances, the family court properly exercised its\r\n  discretion in requiring Husband to pay Wife's attorney's fees.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the\r\n  family court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED\r\n  IN PART. \r\nWILLIAMS, GEATHERS, and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The parties purchased the motor coach in 2002 for $29,800, but Wife\r\n  presented evidence that its value ranged between $12,485 and $15,075 at trial.Â \r\n  Wife estimated the golf club was worth approximately $2,500, which Husband did\r\n  not contest at trial or on appeal. \r\n[2] Husband testified the equity\r\n  line, which is capped at $50,000, has ballooned to approximately $48,000\r\n  because he and Mother are taking monthly draws between $300 and $400 to pay\r\n  living expenses. \r\n[3] Subtracting either the highest or lowest valuation submitted by Wife\r\n  for the motor coach from the original purchase price results in a negative\r\n  equity for the motor coach.\r\n[4] Moreover, if Husband established the motor coach was a gift from Mother,\r\n  it would be logical to conclude based on Husband's and Wife's testimony that Mother\r\n  gifted the motor coach to Husband not to Wife.Â  Because a gift from a third\r\n  party solely to one spouse should be treated as nonmarital property, this would\r\n  also require awarding Husband the motor coach.Â  See Barr v. Barr,\r\n  287 S.C. 13, 17, 336 S.E.2d 481, 484 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding a gift from a\r\n  third party solely to one spouse should be treated as spouse's separate,\r\n  nonmarital property).\r\n[5] We decline to address Husband's remaining contention regarding whether\r\n  his transfer of the title of the motor coach to Mother was in bad faith.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (finding appellate court need not review remaining\r\n  issues when determination of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n[6] See Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313\r\n  (1991).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-375","title":"SCDSS v.

Martin, of Chapin, for Guardian ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: B.D. and R.D. (Foster Parents) appeal from the\r\n  family court's permanency planning order placing custody of Child with R.E. and\r\n  C.E. (Grandparents).Â  Specifically, Foster Parents argue the family court erred in (1)\r\n  making conclusory findings of fact in the permanency planning order that were\r\n  not supported by the evidence and were contrary to the family court's oral\r\n  ruling; (2) making a conclusory finding in the permanency planning order that\r\n  it was in the best interest of Child to be transferred to Grandparents when the\r\n  evidence did not support such a finding; (3) failing to comply with section\r\n  63-7-1700(G) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010); and (4) excluding the\r\n  testimony of Foster Parents' expert witness and failing to consider the\r\n  expert's testimony in its ruling.Â  We affirm.[1] Â Â \r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the family court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de\r\n  novo.Â  Simmons v. Simmons, __ S.C. __, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011); see Lewis v. Lewis, __ S.C. __, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651 (2011).Â  Although this\r\n  court reviews the family court's findings de novo, we are not required to\r\n  ignore the fact that the trial court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a\r\n  better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to\r\n  their testimony.Â  Lewis, __ S.C. at __, 709 S.E.2d at 651.Â  The burden\r\n  is upon the appellant to convince this court that the family court erred in its\r\n  findings.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n&quot;In\r\n  appeals from the family court, the appellate court has the authority to find\r\n  the facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.&quot;Â  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652\r\n  (2006).Â  &quot;This broad scope of review does not, however, require the\r\n  appellate court to disregard the findings of the family court.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;This degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the\r\n  welfare and best interests of a minor child.&quot;Â  Id. at 62, 624 S.E.2d\r\n  at 652.\r\n1. Foster\r\n  Parents' first argument is without merit because the family court's findings of\r\n  fact in its permanency planning order were supported by evidence in the\r\n  record.Â Â  Additionally, in\r\n  South Carolina, &quot;[i]t is well settled that [the court] is not bound by a\r\n  prior oral ruling and may issue a written order which is in conflict with the\r\n  oral ruling.&quot;Â  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 621, 571 S.E.2d\r\n  92, 97 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Accordingly, the argument that the oral ruling and the\r\n  order conflict is also without merit.\r\n2. &quot;In\r\n  custody matters, the court's paramount concern is the welfare and best interest\r\n  of the child.&quot;Â  Hartley v. Hartley, 292 S.C. 245, 248, 355 S.E.2d\r\n  869, 872 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  We hold the family court correctly found custody\r\n  with the Grandparents was in the Child's best interest.Â  Specifically, a\r\n  homestudy conducted through the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children\r\n  approved Grandparents, finding Grandparents fit and willing relatives.Â \r\n  Additionally, Child will reside with two siblings who live with Grandparents\r\n  and are doing well.Â  Moreover, Child will continue to have a relationship with\r\n  Child's biological family in a stable environment.Â  Finally, DSS recommended\r\n  Child be awarded to Grandparents.Â  Although Foster Parents provided good care\r\n  for Child and were making preparations to adopt Child, because DSS's permanency\r\n  plan is &quot;custody or guardianship with a fit and willing relative,&quot;\r\n  the family court properly assessed the viability of Grandparents as appropriate\r\n  custodians under the applicable statute and found Grandparents satisfied the\r\n  best interests of Child.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1700(C) (Supp.\r\n  2010).Â  \r\n3. Foster Parents' third argument is without merit because\r\n  the family court was not operating under section 63-7-1700(G), but rather under\r\n  section 63-7-1700(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010).Â  Section\r\n  63-7-1700(C) is appropriate when the family court is approving a permanency\r\n  plan, and it provides &quot;[i]f the [family] court approves a plan that is not\r\n  reunification with the parents, custody or guardianship with a fit and willing\r\n  relative, or termination of parental rights, the [family] court must find\r\n  compelling reasons for approval of the plan and that the plan is in the child's\r\nbest interests.&quot;Â  Alternatively, section 63-7-1700(G) provides:\r\n\r\n  If after\r\n    assessing the viability of adoption, the department demonstrates that\r\n    termination of parental rights is not in the child's best interests, the court\r\n    may award custody or legal guardianship, or both, to a suitable, fit, and\r\n    willing relative or nonrelative if the court finds this to be in the best\r\n    interest of the child; however, a home study on the individual whom the\r\n    department is recommending for custody of the child must be submitted to the\r\n    court for consideration before custody or legal guardianship, or both, are\r\n    awarded.Â  The court may order a specified period of supervision and services\r\n    not to exceed twelve months, and the court may authorize a period of visitation\r\n    or trial placement prior to receiving a home study.Â  \r\n\r\nHere,\r\n  the family court was not assessing the viability of adoption but, rather, was\r\n  approving a permanency plan.Â  Accordingly, because section 63-7-1700(G) was\r\n  inapplicable, the family court was not required to meet those requirements.\r\n4. Foster\r\n  Parents' fourth argument is without merit.Â  After reviewing the testimony of\r\n  Foster Parents' expert witness under this court's broad scope of review, we\r\n  find the exclusion of the expert's testimony was harmless because the testimony\r\n  was merely cumulative to other evidence presented at the hearing.Â  See State\r\n    v. Pipkin, 359 S.C. 322, 328, 597 S.E.2d 831, 834 (Ct. App. 2004)\r\n  (&quot;Even if excluded in error, the exclusion of evidence which would be merely\r\n  cumulative to other evidence . . . is harmless.&quot;).Â  Accordingly, any error\r\n  resulting from the exclusion of the expert's testimony was harmless because of\r\n  its cumulative nature.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS, KONDUROS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-376","title":"Goodson v.

Ralph Garris, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        William H. Bowman, III, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Donald\r\n  Lee Goodson appeals an order finding he was not entitled to uninsured motorist\r\n  (UIM) coverage.Â  Â We affirm.[1]\r\nGoodson sustained serious injuries when an automobile\r\n  struck the motorcycle he was operating.Â  The limits of the at-fault driver's\r\n  liability insurance were insufficient to compensate Goodson for his injuries\r\n  and other damages arising from the accident. Â \r\nAt the time of the accident, Goodson's motorcycle was\r\n  insured by GEICO Indemnity Company under an Indemnity Cycle-Gard Motorcycle\r\n  Policy. Â The limits of Goodson's liability coverage were 15/30/10.Â  Since\r\n  the inception of the policy in March 2003, Goodson never had UIM coverage on\r\n  this policy. \r\nGoodson sued GEICO for reformation of the policy to\r\n  include UIM coverage, alleging GEICO failed to offer this coverage to him as\r\n  required by section 38-77-160 of the South Carolina Code (2002).Â  After a\r\n  nonjury trial, the trial court issued an order finding that pursuant to section\r\n  38-77-350(A) of the South Carolina Code (2002 &amp; Supp. 2010), GEICO was\r\n  entitled to a conclusive presumption that it made a meaningful offer of UIM\r\n  coverage to Goodson.Â  In addition, although the court stated that evidence of\r\n  an insured's knowledge or level of sophistication would not be relevant as a\r\n  determination of whether an offer of UIM coverage was sufficient under section\r\n  38-77-350, it further found that GEICO's offer of UIM coverage provided\r\n  sufficient information for Goodson, considering his level of education and work\r\n  experience, to make an intelligent decision regarding whether or not to\r\n  purchase UIM coverage.Â  Goodson appeals.\r\n1. The failure to comply strictly with section\r\n  38-77-350(A) when offering UIM coverage does not automatically require judicial\r\n  reformation of the policy to include such coverage.Â  Grinnell Corp. v. Wood,\r\n  389 S.C. 350, 357, 698 S.E.2d 796, 799 (2010).Â  &quot;Rather, even where an\r\n  [insurer] is not entitled to the presumption that it made a meaningful offer,\r\n  it may prove the sufficiency of its offer by showing that it complied with Wannamaker.&quot;[2]Â  Id. at 357, 698 S.E.2d\r\n  799-800.\r\n2. We hold the\r\n  offer of UIM coverage at issue here satisfied the Wannamaker requirements,\r\n  namely that (1) the insurer's notification process be commercially reasonable,\r\n  (2) the insurer specify the limits of optional coverage and not merely offer\r\n  additional coverage in general terms, (3) the insurer intelligibly advise the\r\n  insured of the nature of the optional coverage, and (4) the insured be told\r\n  that optional coverages are available for an additional premium.Â  State Farm\r\n    Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 521, 354 S.E.2d 555, 556\r\n  (1987)\r\nGoodson\r\n  concedes GEICO satisfied the first two prongs of the Wannamaker test.Â \r\n  As to whether GEICO &quot;intelligibly advised&quot; Goodson of the nature of\r\n  optional coverage, the offer form contains a brief summary of the nature of UIM\r\n  coverage, including who would be able to recover, the circumstances under which\r\n  coverage would be available, and the extent of coverage.Â  It further advises\r\n  that if the insured rejects any of the offered coverages, including UIM\r\n  coverage, the form may be used by GEICO against the insured in the event the\r\n  insured seeks this coverage at a later time.Â  The form also provides GEICO's\r\n  toll-free telephone number, informs insureds that they may also contact the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Insurance with questions, and gives contact\r\n  information for the Department, including both its mailing and e-mail addresses\r\n  and local and toll-free telephone numbers.Â Â  On the final page of the offer\r\n  form appears a printed acknowledgement by which the insured, in signing the\r\n  form, attests to the fact that GEICO has communicated the necessary information\r\n  to enable the insured to make an intelligent decision regarding the various\r\n  coverages offered.Â  We therefore hold GEICO &quot;intelligibly advised&quot;\r\n  Goodson of the nature of UIM coverage. Â This holding is further supported by the\r\n  fact that it appears undisputed that Goodson personally completed the form and by\r\n  the trial court's findings regarding Goodson's education and level of\r\n  sophistication.Â  See Â Floyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C.\r\n  253, 263, 626 S.E.2d 6, 12 (2005) (stating that in requiring the insured to\r\n  personally mark, make selections, and sign the form, &quot;the Legislature\r\n  apparently recognized that an insured person who is required to personally\r\n  complete an offer form inevitably will find it necessary to seek further\r\n  explanation from the insurance agent when he or she is unable to complete the\r\n  form due to a lack of knowledge or understanding of the concepts of UM and UIM\r\n  coverages&quot;);[3] Croft v. Old Republic Ins. Co., 365 S.C. 402, 420, 618 S.E.2d 909, 918\r\n  (2005) (&quot;[E]vidence of the insured[']s knowledge or level of\r\n  sophistication is relevant and admissible when analyzing, under Wannamaker,\r\n  whether an insurer intelligibly advised the insured of the nature of the\r\n  optional . . . UIM coverage.&quot;).\r\n3. We disagree with\r\n  Goodson's argument that the absence of specific premiums corresponding to the\r\n  listed coverage limits amounts to a failure to satisfy the requirement that an\r\n  insurer, when offering UIM coverage, advise its insureds that optional\r\n  coverages are available for an additional premium.Â  \r\nAs the trial court\r\n  noted, GEICO provided a method by which Goodson could have determined the\r\n  premium for a specific set of coverage limits, namely, he could have called\r\n  GEICO at its customer service telephone number for a quote.Â  Goodson's only\r\n  challenge to this rationale is that GEICO should not have &quot;put the onus on\r\n  its customer to contact it for specific premiums&quot; because it had the\r\n  necessary information to provide specific quotes for his vehicles given the\r\n  fact that his liability limits were the statutory minimums, and he fails to\r\n  explain why it is unduly burdensome to expect customers to call their insurers\r\n  for specific premiums.Â  We agree with the trial court that Goodson had the sophistication\r\n  to avail himself of the means provided by GEICO to obtain a precise quote for a\r\n  desired level of UIM coverage.Â  See Grinnell, 389 S.C. at 357-58,\r\n  698 S.E.2d at 800 (&quot;A meaningful offer of additional UM and UIM [coverage]\r\n  makes as certain as possible that an insured has actual knowledge of his\r\n  options with respect to such coverages and is therefore able to make an\r\n  informed decision with respect to this desired coverage.&quot;).\r\n4. Because we hold\r\n  that GEICO's offer of UIM coverage was sufficient under Wannamaker, we\r\n  need not address Goodson's argument challenging the trial court's finding that\r\n  GEICO was entitled to a conclusive presumption under section 38-77-350 that\r\n  Goodson made a knowing decision to reject UIM coverage.Â  See Futch v. McAllister\r\n    Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling that, if the determination of a\r\n  particular issue is dispositive of an appeal, the appellate court need not\r\n  review the remaining issues); Weeks v.

Haynsworth, III, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        David Richard Price, Jr, of Easley, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Phillips Brothers Properties LLC (Phillips Brothers)\r\n  appeals the order of the trial court voiding a tax sale of the property of Lee\r\n  Edwards Cunningham and voiding the deed of the tax sale purchaser, Gary T.\r\n  Cason, to Phillips Brothers.Â  Phillips Brothers argues the trial court erred in\r\n  (1) ruling Cunningham's action was not barred by the statute of limitations;\r\n  (2) holding Phillips Brothers was not a bona fide purchaser for value under section\r\n  15-39-870 of the South Carolina Code (2005); (3) finding Cunningham's claim was\r\n  not barred by estoppel; (4) finding it also was not barred by laches; (5)\r\n  allowing Cunningham to collaterally attack the judgment from a prior quiet\r\n  title action; and (6) holding the absence of Cunningham's mortgagee from the\r\n  quiet title action prevented Phillips Brothers from being a bona fide purchaser\r\n  for value.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\n1. As\r\n  to the statute of limitations, we find Phillips Brothers failed to properly challenge\r\n  the trial court's rulings and did not meet his burden of demonstrating reversible\r\n  error.Â  The trial court ruled Cunningham's action to void the delinquent tax\r\n  sale and deed was not barred by the statute of limitations found in sections\r\n  12-51-160 and -90(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010) because the\r\n  defects were jurisdictional and when the defect is jurisdictional, the two-year\r\n  statute of limitations does not apply.Â  The court found allowing the statute to\r\n  bar the claim of a person who never received due process notice would require\r\n  an interpretation and/or application of the statutes in a manner that would\r\n  circumvent the due process requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\r\n  United States Constitution. Phillips Brothers failed to challenge these rulings\r\n  and merely asserted the statute began to run on the date of sale. Â Accordingly,\r\n  we find the trial court's rulings on this issue are the law of the case.Â  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238,\r\n  241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (stating an unappealed ruling is the law of the\r\n  case and should not be reconsidered by the appellate court); McCall v. IKON,\r\n  380 S.C. 649, 659-60, 670 S.E.2d 695, 701 (Ct. App. 2008) (noting an appealed\r\n  order comes to the appellate court with a presumption of correctness and the\r\n  burden is on appellant to demonstrate reversible error). \r\n2. As\r\n  to Phillips Brothers' argument it is a bona fide purchaser under section 15-39-870\r\n  of the South Carolina Code, we find no error in the trial court's ruling.Â  Phillips\r\n  Brothers failed to challenge the trial court's holding this section does not\r\n  apply to tax sales.Â  Therefore, it is the law of the case.Â  See Judy\r\n    v. Martin, 381 S.C. 455, 459, 674 S.E.2d 151, 153 (2009) (&quot;[A]n\r\n  unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case and precludes further\r\n  consideration of the issue on appeal.&quot;).Â  In addition, Phillips Brothers\r\n  sets forth no argument or citation of authority to support its contention\r\n  section 15-39-870 should also apply to tax sales and quiet title actions.Â  See McCall,\r\n  380 S.C. at 659-60, 670 S.E.2d at 701 (stating an appealed order comes to the\r\n  appellate court with a presumption of correctness and the burden is on\r\n  appellant to demonstrate reversible error); Harris v. Campbell, 293 S.C.\r\n  85, 87, 358 S.E.2d 719, 720 (Ct. App. 1987) (noting our court is &quot;obliged\r\n  to reverse when error is called to our attention, but we are not in the\r\n  business of figuring out on our own whether error exists&quot;). Â Furthermore,\r\n  in construing the statute according to the plain and ordinary meaning of the\r\n  words used, we find the section only applies to judicial sales by decree of\r\n  court and does not apply to tax sales or quiet title actions.Â  See First\r\n    Baptist Church of Mauldin v. City of Mauldin, 308 S.C. 226, 229, 417 S.E.2d\r\n  592, 593 (1992) (&quot;In construing a statute, its words must be given their\r\n  plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction\r\n  to limit or expand the statute's operation.&quot;).Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to any contention Phillips Brothers makes that it is a common law bona fide\r\n  purchaser of value, we find this argument is not within the scope of the issues\r\n  set forth in its statement of the issues on appeal.Â  See Rule\r\n  208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (&quot;Ordinarily, no point will be considered which is not\r\n  set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.&quot;). Â In addition,\r\n  Phillips Brothers failed to specifically challenge on appeal many of the trial\r\n  court's reasons for holding Phillips Brothers was not a bona fide purchaser for\r\n  value including (1) because the tax sale and deed were void, Cason never had\r\n  legal title and could not transfer title to Phillips Brothers; and (2) Phillips\r\n  Brothers' interest in the property was subject to Cunningham's right of\r\n  redemption.Â  Accordingly, these rulings are the law of the case.Â  Ables v.\r\n    Gladden, 378 S.C. 558, 569, 664 S.E.2d 442, 448 (2008) (holding an unappealed\r\n  ruling is the law of the case).\r\n3. As\r\n  to estoppel, Phillips Brothers failed to discuss the issue of estoppel in its\r\n  brief; therefore, the issue is deemed abandoned.Â  State v. Hiott, 276\r\n  S.C. 72, 86, 276 S.E.2d 163, 170 (1981) (stating an issue raised on appeal but\r\n  not argued in the brief is deemed abandoned and will not be considered by the\r\n  appellate court).\r\n4. As\r\n  to laches, the trial court held, &quot;The undisputed failures to provide\r\n  Cunningham his constitutional right to due process prevented him from learning\r\n  of the facts forming the basis of his claim, and occasioned any delay by\r\n  Cunningham in bringing this action.&quot;Â  We find no error in this ruling.Â  See Smith v. Barr, 375 S.C. 157, 164, 650 S.E.2d 486, 490 (Ct. App. 2007) (finding\r\n  equity did not require the validation of a tax sale because the failure to give\r\n  the required statutory notice renders the tax sale invalid and equity follows\r\n  the law); Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C.\r\n  471, 479, 451 S.E.2d 924, 929 (Ct. App. 1994) (&quot;The lached party must have\r\n  had actual knowledge or inquiry notice of the facts forming the basis of its\r\n  claim, and its failure to assert its right is irrelevant until there is a\r\n  reason or situation that demands assertion.&quot;); id. (noting the\r\n  burden of proof is upon the person claiming laches).Â  \r\n5. As\r\n  to Phillips Brothers' assertion the trial court's order vesting title in\r\n  Cunningham and cancelling the deeds to Cason and Phillips Brothers was an\r\n  impermissible collateral attack on the judgment in the quiet title action,\r\n  Phillips Brothers did not raise this issue to the trial court until its motion\r\n  to alter or amend.Â  Accordingly, it is not properly before this court.Â  See Kiawah Prop. Owners Grp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 359 S.C. 105, 113, 597\r\n  S.E.2d 145, 149 (2004) (stating a party may not raise an issue in a motion to\r\n  reconsider, alter, or amend a judgment that could have been presented prior to\r\n  the judgment).\r\n6. Finally,\r\n  as to Phillips Brothers' argument the trial court erred in finding the absence\r\n  of Cunningham's mortgagee from the quiet title action established Phillips\r\n  Brothers was not a bona fide purchaser, we need not address this issue because\r\n  we affirm the trial court for the above stated reasons.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when\r\n  its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
