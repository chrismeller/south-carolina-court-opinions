As to whether the\r\n  trial court erred in considering documents from a prior factually-related\r\n  action: Dixon v.

Jones, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: Randall\r\n  Brummitt (Husband) appeals from an order of the family court increasing his\r\n  alimony obligation, finding him in contempt, and awarding Patricia Brummitt\r\n  (Wife) attorney's fees and costs.Â  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR,\r\n  and the following authorities:\r\n1. Regarding the family\r\n  court's refusal to reduce or terminate Husband's alimony, we find evidence in\r\n  the record supporting the family court's decision to increase alimony, and\r\n  therefore, the family court did not abuse its discretion.Â  SeeÂ  Eubank\r\n    v. Eubank, 347 S.C. 367, 372, 555 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 2001)\r\n  (explaining that a family court's decision regarding the modification of\r\n  alimony will not be disturbed on review absent an abuse of discretion);Â  Clark\r\n    v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000) (&quot;An abuse\r\n  of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based on an error of law\r\n  or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary\r\n  support.&quot;).\r\n2. Regarding the contempt,\r\n  we find no abuse of discretion where evidence in the record reflects Husband\r\n  willfully violated the family court's previous order.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 63-3-620 (2010) (&quot;An adult who wilfully violates, neglects, or\r\n  refuses to obey or perform a lawful order of the court . . . may be proceeded\r\n  against for contempt of court.&quot;);Â  Bartlett v. Rachels, 375 S.C.\r\n  348, 353, 652 S.E.2d 432, 435 (Ct. App. 2007) (explaining that a family court's\r\n  decision regarding contempt will be reversed only if the family court abused\r\n  its discretion).\r\n3. Regarding the award\r\n  of attorney's fees, Husband hinged his argument on his inferior financial\r\n  condition and his anticipated success in this appeal.Â  Because the appeal was\r\n  not successful and ample evidence in the record indicates Husband's ability to\r\n  pay the fees exceeds that of his disabled ex-wife, the family court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion.Â  Dickert v. Dickert, 387 S.C. 1, __, 691 S.E.2d\r\n  448, 452-53 (2010) (&quot;Whether to award attorney's fees is a matter within\r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and THOMAS and\r\n  PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-300","title":"Motsinger v.

Lyles and Jason A. Pittman, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJoseph S. McCue, Christian Stegmaier, and Amy L. Neuschafer, of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Shields, Inc. (Shields)\r\n  appeals orders of the circuit court granting relief from a prior order\r\n  dismissing the case and granting summary judgment in favor of Respondent\r\n  McDevitt Street Bovis, Inc. (McDevitt).Â  Shields argues that the court erred in\r\n  granting McDevitt's request for relief under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, by finding the\r\n  dismissal was void ab initio and by denying application of Shields' defenses because\r\n  of Shields' unclean hands.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThis\r\n  appeal arises out of the construction of a nine story, fifty-four unit\r\n  condominium apartment complex in North Myrtle Beach, known as Pinnacle.Â \r\n  McDevitt was the general contractor for the original construction and hired\r\n  Shields as a subcontractor.Â  In 1989, McDevitt and the Pinnacle Condominium\r\n  Association, on behalf of all of the individual unit owners, signed a release\r\n  wherein Pinnacle released McDevitt from liability resulting from certain\r\n  construction defects in return for a settlement payment.Â  As part of the\r\n  release, Pinnacle assigned to McDevitt any claims it might have against\r\n  Shields.\r\nIn 1990, McDevitt\r\n  filed a lawsuit against Shields for defects in the installation of synthetic\r\n  stucco (R-Wall) at Pinnacle.Â  In its complaint, McDevitt alleged Shields\r\n  breached its contract by failing to construct the R-Wall in a good and\r\n  workmanlike manner and by failing to repair the damages upon McDevitt's\r\n  request.Â  A jury awarded McDevitt actual damages, attorney's fees, and costs.Â  Before\r\n  the matter could be decided on appeal, McDevitt and Shields entered into a\r\n  settlement agreement and mutual release in 1993.\r\nIn\r\n  1997, the Pinnacle Condominium Association filed a new lawsuit, which is the\r\n  subject of the present appeal, against the developer, the architect, and\r\n  McDevitt as the general contractor.Â  Pinnacle alleged installation and\r\n  construction defects in the exterior wall system.Â  McDevitt subsequently filed\r\n  a third-party complaint against Shields and four other subcontractors.Â \r\n  McDevitt alleged it was entitled to indemnification against the claims Pinnacle\r\n  asserted regarding Shields' work.Â  Alternatively, McDevitt alleged Shields\r\n  breached its subcontract and/or warranties, owed McDevitt a defense and\r\n  indemnification, and owed contribution if Pinnacle's allegations proved to be\r\n  correct.\r\nIn\r\n  1998, the case was assigned to the Honorable John L. Breeden, Jr.Â  McDevitt\r\n  filed a motion for summary judgment, which Judge Breeden granted after a\r\n  hearing.Â  The order, filed August 8, 2000, granted summary judgment in favor of\r\n  McDevitt for contractual indemnity and collateral estoppel and denied Shields'\r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  On August 17, 2000, Shields filed a motion to\r\n  alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, and an amended motion\r\n  approximately one week later.\r\nOn\r\n  April 2, 2001, Shields' attorney wrote Judge Breeden a letter asking him to\r\n  rule on the pending Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Shields' attorney wrote Judge Breeden\r\n  another letter on May 10, 2001, asking him to hear the pending Rule 59(e) motion.Â \r\n  In December of 2001, Judge Breeden signed an order dismissing all of the claims\r\n  in the action except for McDevitt's third-party claims against Shields and two\r\n  other subcontractors.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  May 17, 2002, Shields' attorney again wrote Judge Breeden asking him to set the\r\n  pending motion for hearing.Â  On June 28, 2002, the Honorable Steven H. John\r\n  signed a Form 4 order dismissing the action pursuant to Rule 43(k), SCRCP,\r\n  which was filed on July 3, 2002.Â  On August 27, 2002, McDevitt filed a motion\r\n  pursuant to Rule 60(b), SCRCP, asking the court to reinstate the case because\r\n  the 2002 dismissal was entered on the mistaken assumption that all claims in\r\n  the action had settled.Â  Judge Breeden signed an order filed September 11,\r\n  2002, reopening the case without holding a hearing.Â  In the meantime, the\r\n  pending Rule 59(e) motion was scheduled for a hearing but was continued upon Shields'\r\n  request on October 1, 2002.\r\nOn\r\n  January 17, 2003, McDevitt's attorney wrote Shields' attorney, asking for\r\n  available times to schedule the Rule 59(e) motion for a hearing.Â  On July 1,\r\n  2003, Shields' attorney wrote Judge Breeden again, asking him to reschedule\r\n  Shields' Rule 59(e) motion.Â  On July 3, 2003, the Clerk filed another Form 4\r\n  order that had been signed by Judge John on June 27, 2003, dismissing the\r\n  action again pursuant to Rule 43(k), SCRCP (the 2003 Dismissal).Â  McDevitt did\r\n  not file a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the 2003 Dismissal; instead, it\r\n  filed another Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion on August 19, 2003, asking the court to\r\n  reinstate the case again because of mistake.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  almost three years of inactivity, attorney Joseph McCue sent a letter to the\r\n  Clerk of Court on May 25, 2006, asking for a hearing on McDevitt's second Rule\r\n  60(b) motion.Â  Shields' attorney responded in a letter to the Clerk dated June\r\n  9, 2006, and argued that McCue was not McDevitt's attorney of record and that the\r\n  case had been dismissed in 2003.Â  On June 29, 2006, McCue sent a proposed\r\n  consent order to substitute counsel to the Clerk, which was never signed.\r\nThe\r\n  case remained dormant until January 16, 2008, when McCue sent a letter to the\r\n  Clerk of Court memorializing a telephone conversation with the nonjury docket\r\n  coordinator and setting the motion for a hearing on February 4, 2008.Â  On March\r\n  18, 2008, McCue sent another consent order to substitute counsel to the Clerk,\r\n  along with the required filing fee.Â  On March 20, 2008, Judge John heard\r\n  arguments on McDevitt's second Rule 60(b) motion and Shields' rule 59(e) motion.Â \r\n  Judge John granted McDevitt's Rule 60(b) motion for relief, found the 2003 Dismissal\r\n  void ab initio, and denied Shields' Rule 59(e) motion due to the impossibility\r\n  of a rehearing.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  decision to grant or deny a Rule 60(b) motion is within the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial judge.Â  BB&amp;T v. Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 551, 633 S.E.2d 501,\r\n  502 (2006).Â  The appellate standard of review is limited to determining whether\r\n  there was an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. at 551, 633 S.E.2d at 502-03.Â  An\r\n  abuse of discretion occurs when the order of the court is controlled by an\r\n  error of law or where the order is based on factual conclusions that are\r\n  without evidentiary support.Â  Sundown Operating Co. v. Intedge Indus., Inc.,\r\n  383 S.C. 601, 607, 681 S.E.2d 885, 888 (2009).Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nShields argues the\r\n  trial court erred in finding the 2003 Dismissal was void ab initio instead of\r\n  merely being voidable; thus, because the order is only voidable, Shields is\r\n  entitled to raise certain legal and equitable defenses.Â  We agree.\r\n1.&nbsp; As to whether the trial court\r\n  erred in finding the 2003 Dismissal void ab initio:Â  Although the court did not\r\n  explicitly base its ruling on Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, we proceed as if the trial\r\n  court granted McDevitt's motion on that basis.Â  We find the 2003 Dismissal is\r\n  not void because the circuit court has jurisdiction to determine contractual\r\n  disputes; therefore, the trial court's ruling was an error of law.Â  See Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP (setting forth the circumstances in which a party may\r\n  obtain relief from a final judgment when that judgment is void); Thomas\r\n    &amp; Howard Co. v. T.W. Graham &amp; Co., 318 S.C. 286, 291, 457 S.E.2d\r\n  340, 343 (1995) (&quot;A void judgment is one that, from its inception, is a\r\n  complete nullity and is without legal effect and must be distinguished from one\r\n  which is merely 'voidable.' . . . Generally, a judgment is void only if a court\r\n  acts without jurisdiction.&quot;); S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 11 (2009) (delineating\r\n  the jurisdiction of the circuit court); Capital City Ins. Co. v. BP Staff,\r\n    Inc., 382 S.C. 92, 100, 674 S.E.2d 524, 528 (Ct. App. 2009) (defining\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction as the power to hear and determine cases of the\r\n  general class to which the proceedings in question belong).\r\n2.&nbsp; As to whether the trial court\r\n  erred in finding Shields had unclean hands:Â  We find Shields did not have a\r\n  duty to ask for a hearing on McDevitt's motion; therefore, the trial court's\r\n  refusal to consider Shields' defenses was an error of law.Â  See Don\r\n    Shevey &amp; Spires, Inc. v. Am. Motors Realty Corp., 279 S.C. 58, 60, 301\r\n  S.E.2d 757, 759 (1983) (&quot;While a defendant may bring about an expeditious\r\n  trial of a case, he has no legal obligation to do so; except to meet such\r\n  actions as are taken by the plaintiff, he may remain passive.&quot;) (internal\r\n  citation and quotation omitted).\r\n3.&nbsp; As to Shields' defense of waiver:Â \r\n  We find McDevitt waived its right to assert its Rule 60 motion when it\r\n  abandoned the case for several years by failing to pursue a hearing or ruling\r\n  on the motion and/or by failing to diligently pursue its case.Â  See Dep't\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Mrs. H., 346 S.C. 329, 334, 550 S.E.2d 898, 901 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001) (concluding defendants waived and abandoned their opportunity for a\r\n  hearing on a Rule 60 motion when seven years elapsed between the filing of the\r\n  motion and the hearing on the motion); Strickland v. Strickland, 375\r\n  S.C. 76, 85, 650 S.E.2d 465, 470 (2007) (holding waiver is the &quot;voluntary\r\n  and intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.&quot;)\r\n  (internal quotation omitted); Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal\r\n    Prop. Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387-88 (1992) (finding the\r\n  party claiming waiver must show the other party possessed, at the time, actual\r\n  or constructive knowledge of his rights or of all the material facts upon which\r\n  they were dependent).\r\n4.&nbsp; Due to our disposition herein, we\r\n  need not address any remaining issues on appeal.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (noting an appellate court need not address the remaining issues on\r\n  appeal when the disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nREVERSED.\r\nPIEPER\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-311","title":"State v.

Charleston, and John\r\n          S. Nichols of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: The\r\n  South Carolina Uninsured Employers' Fund (Fund) appeals the order of the\r\n  circuit court, which reversed the decision of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission (Commission) denying benefits to Dharmendra Chaudhari, husband of\r\n  deceased employee Anita Chaudhari and remanded the case to the Commission.Â  We\r\n  find the order on appeal is not immediately appealable and therefore dismiss.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n  \r\n\r\nOn November 14, 2002, Anita\r\n  Chaudhari was killed by a co-worker while working at the Fast Point Gas\r\n  Station.Â  Mr. Chaudhari brought this action seeking workers' compensation\r\n  benefits.Â  As the Employer, Avni Grocers, did not have workers' compensation\r\n  insurance, the Fund defended the action.Â  The single commissioner held Mr.\r\n  Chaudhari failed to prove Avni Grocers regularly employed four or more\r\n  employees as required by section 42-1-150 of the South Carolina Code (1985) to\r\n  be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.Â  The Appellate Panel of the\r\n  Commission affirmed.Â  The circuit court, however, reversed and remanded the\r\n  matter to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with its order.Â \r\n  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMr. Chaudhari argues the\r\n  order of the circuit court is not immediately appealable.Â  We agree.\r\nOur courts â€œhave consistently\r\n  held that an order of the circuit court remanding a case for additional\r\n  proceedings before an administrative agency is not directly appealable.â€Â  Montjoy\r\n  v. Asten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 52, 446 S.E.2d 618, 618 (1994).Â  The\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court recently reiterated that appeals from\r\n  administrative agencies may only be from final decisions.Â  Charlotte-Mecklenburg\r\n  Hosp. Auth. v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, S.C. Sup. Ct.\r\n  Order dated April 8, 2010 (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 14 at 85).Â  It explained the\r\n  general appealability statute, section 14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (1976 &amp; Supp. 2009), does not apply to appeals from administrative\r\n  agencies.Â  Id. at 87.Â  The court overruled this court's opinion Canteen\r\n  v. McLeod Regional Medical Center, 384 S.C. 617, 682 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009) to the extent it relied on section 14-3-330 to permit the appeal of\r\n  interlocutory orders of the administrative law court or an administrative\r\n  agency.[1] Â Id.Â  \r\nA judgment is not final when\r\n  there is some further act that must be done by the court prior to a determination\r\n  of the rights of the parties or when the judgment determines the applicable law\r\n  while leaving open questions of fact.Â  Id. at 88.Â  &quot;A final\r\n  judgment disposes of the whole subject matter of the action or terminates the\r\n  particular proceeding or action, leaving nothing to be done but to enforce by\r\n  execution what has been determined.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe order on appeal remands\r\n  the matter to the Commission for further proceedings.Â  It is not a final\r\n  judgment.Â  Thus, the order is not immediately appealable.Â  \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.Â  \r\nFEW, C.J., and HUFF and\r\n  THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It also overruled Oakwood Landfill, Inc. v.

While we\r\n  recognize the preservation concern about the lack of specific findings by the\r\n  family court, we also recognize that where the best interests of a minor child\r\n  are concerned, the court may\r\n  appropriately raise, ex mero motu, issues not raised by the parties.Â  Joiner\r\n  ex rel.

Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 107, 536 S.E.2d 372, 374 (2000).Â \r\n  Here, we find remand is appropriate because (1) in order to decide this matter,\r\n  we must speculate as to the findings that would support the family court's\r\n  decision to award custody to Father; (2) the attorneys did not make any legal\r\n  arguments on the record, so we are constrained to rely upon the pleadings; (3) if\r\n  the family court relied on the temporary order as the framework for the final\r\n  order, we find our review problematic as the transcript of that hearing is not\r\n  a part of this record; and (4) the guardian ad litem did not submit a report or\r\n  testify at the hearing.Â  See Rule 26(a), SCRFC (&quot;An order or\r\n  judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic relations case shall set\r\n  forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the\r\n  court's decision.&quot;); In\r\n  re Treatment &amp; Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 133, 568 S.E.2d 338, 343 (2002) (&quot;The absence\r\n  of factual findings makes our task of reviewing the court order impossible\r\n  because the reasons underlying the decision are left to speculation.&quot;)\r\n  (internal quotation omitted); Atkinson v.

Â As to whether the family\r\n  court erred in issuing its decision when the guardian ad litem failed to submit\r\n  a written report:Â  Joiner ex rel. Rivas, 342 S.C. at 107, 536 S.E.2d at\r\n  374 (finding that where the best interests of a minor child are concerned, the\r\n  court may appropriately raise, ex mero motu, issues not raised by the\r\n  parties); S.C.

Dep't of\r\n  Transp. v.

Baker, pro se, of\r\n          North Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.:Â  Phyllis B.\r\n  Baker (Wife) appeals the family court's divorce decree. Â Her primary contention\r\n  is that the family court erred in treating her State disability retirement\r\n  benefits as both marital property and income. Â We agree and reverse.[1]Â  \r\nJerry M. Baker (Husband) and Wife\r\n  were married from 1977 to 2007. Â Wife taught public school from the time of the\r\n  marriage until 1999, when the State found her disabled. Â At the time of\r\n  the divorce, Wife received $2,016.82 per month from the State for her\r\n  disability. Â The divorce decree distributed 50% of this benefit to Husband as part\r\n  of equitable distribution.Â  The family court also used the $2,016.82\r\n  monthly payment in calculating Wife's income. Â In her Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  motion, Wife argued her disability benefits were being &quot;double\r\n  counted&quot; as both income for purposes of determining alimony and as a\r\n  marital asset subject to distribution.Â  The family court declined to amend\r\n  the order.Â  \r\nThis appeal is controlled by this\r\n  court's decision in Tinsley v. Tinsley, 326 S.C. 374, 483 S.E.2d 198\r\n  (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The Tinsley court noted &quot;the focus of South\r\n  Carolina appellate courts in deciding whether payments from an employer are\r\n  marital property subject to distribution, or income, has been on\r\n  determining whether the payments are compensation for services performed during\r\n  the course of the marriage.&quot;Â  Id. at 381, 483 S.E.2d at 202\r\n  (emphasis added). Â Under the reasoning of Tinsley, the family court\r\n  erred as a matter of law in treating Wife's benefits as a marital asset subject\r\n  to distribution because the payments were not compensation for services\r\n  performed during the marriage.Â  Rather, Wife's disability benefits were\r\n  replacement for income she would have been receiving had she not become\r\n  disabled.Â  Therefore, Wife's benefits should have been classified as income. \r\nAccordingly, we reverse and\r\n  remand for the family court to reconsider the equitable distribution factors\r\n  and alimony factors after classifying Wife's disability retirement benefits as\r\n  income, and subtracting Wife's retirement benefits from the value of the\r\n  marital estate. Â All remaining issues on appeal concern equitable distribution,\r\n  alimony, and attorney's fees.Â  The family court must reconsider all of these\r\n  issues on remand in light of our ruling.Â  See Sexton v. Sexton,\r\n  310 S.C. 501, 503-504, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666&nbsp;(1993) (reversing and remanding\r\n  issue of attorney's fees for reconsideration when the substantive results\r\n  achieved by trial counsel were reversed on appeal).Â  The family court must also\r\n  reconsider the issue of security for the payment of alimony in light of our ruling.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(D) (Supp. 2009) (listing the probable\r\n  economic condition of the supported spouse upon the death of the payor spouse\r\n  as one of the factors a family court should consider in determining whether to\r\n  require the payor spouse to maintain a life insurance policy as security for\r\n  future alimony payments).

Pascoe, Jr., of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Cedric Kearse appeals his conviction for\r\n  trafficking in cocaineâ€“second offense, possession with the intent to distribute\r\n  crack cocaineâ€“second offense, and failure to stop for a blue light.Â  He argues\r\n  the plea court erred in: (1) denying his motion to relieve counsel; and (2)\r\n  accepting his guilty plea because it was not knowingly and voluntarily entered\r\n  into.Â  We affirm.[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n1.Â \r\n  As to whether the plea court erred in denying Kearse's motion to relieve\r\n  counsel:Â  The plea court conducted a sufficient inquiry into the basis of\r\n  Kearse's complaints against plea counsel.Â  Although Kearse believed he did not\r\n  have adequate time to speak with plea counsel and felt pressed to proceed to trial,\r\n  none of his objections prevented him from communicating with his attorney or\r\n  precluded plea counsel from adequately defending him.Â  The plea court also\r\n  inquired regarding plea counsel's preparations for trial, and determined plea\r\n  counsel was prepared to go forward with the case.Â  Accordingly, the plea court\r\n  did not abuse its discretion in denying Kearse's motion to relieve counsel.Â  See State v. Childers, 373 S.C. 367, 372, 645 S.E.2d 233, 235 (2007) (&quot;A\r\n  motion to relieve counsel is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge and\r\n  will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;); State v. Sims,\r\n  304 S.C. 409, 414, 405 S.E.2d 377, 380 (1991) (holding an appellate court may\r\n  consider several factors in determining whether the trial court abused its\r\n  discretion in a motion for substitution of counsel: timeliness of the motion,\r\n  adequacy of the trial judge's inquiry into the defendant's complaint, and\r\n  whether the attorney-client conflict was so great that it resulted in a total\r\n  lack of communication, thereby preventing an adequate defense).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n2.Â \r\n  As to whether the plea court erred in accepting his guilty plea because it was\r\n  not knowingly and voluntarily entered into:Â  This issue is not preserved for\r\n  our review because Kearse failed to object during the guilty plea.Â  See State\r\n    v.

McCulloch, Jr., of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Maureen Blackwell and Walter L. Blackwell, III\r\n  (Grandmother and Grandfather, collectively Grandparents) appeal from the\r\n  circuit court's dismissal of their complaint with prejudice for lack of subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction and failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause\r\n  of action.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nGrandparents are the\r\n  biological parents of Janis Birket (Mother).Â  Mother and Jeromy Birket (Father) are married and have two\r\n  children: Daughter and Son (Granddaughter and Grandson, collectively Children).Â \r\n  Mother and Father have sole custody of Children.Â  At the time Grandparents\r\n  filed their complaint in circuit court, Granddaughter was six years of age and\r\n  Son was seven months old.Â  \r\nPreviously,\r\n  Grandparents, Mother, Father, and Granddaughter all resided in California.Â  For\r\n  an unspecified amount of time, Granddaughter either resided in Grandparents'\r\n  home or lived within close proximity to Grandparents.Â  As a result, Granddaughter\r\n  visited Grandparents often, and Grandparents believed &quot;a strong bond of\r\n  love and affection was formed between [Granddaughter] and [Grandparents] during\r\n  that time.&quot; \r\nThereafter, Mother\r\n  and Father decided to move to South Carolina and allegedly requested\r\n  Grandparents assistance in moving.[2]Â \r\n  As a result, Grandparents maintained they entered into an oral contract with\r\n  Mother and Father whereby Grandparents agreed to the following: (1) sell their\r\n  home &quot;of approximately [thirty] years&quot; in California; (2) name Mother\r\n  as the listing agent for the home; (3) sell Grandfather's business; (4) sell\r\n  Grandparents' investment property; (5) move to South Carolina with\r\n  Granddaughter, &quot;leaving behind everything in their lives, including\r\n  friends, belongings and associations that they had accumulated over sixty years;&quot;\r\n  (6) give Mother a sum certain of money from a lawsuit Grandfather negotiated;\r\n  (7) purchase a home in South Carolina within close proximity to Mother and\r\n  Father's home &quot;and cause a real estate commission to be paid to [Father]\r\n  for that purchase;&quot; (8) provide child care services for Mother and Father\r\n  whenever needed; and (9) be a part of Granddaughter's life.Â  In exchange,\r\n  Mother and Father allegedly agreed to (1) &quot;provide an environment in which\r\n  [Grandparents] could maintain a close and loving relationship with\r\n  [Granddaughter] and allow [Grandparents] to have unfettered contact with [Granddaughter]&quot;;\r\n  (2) continue to allow Grandparents to have the same amount of contact with Granddaughter\r\n  as had been previously established, including the celebration of holidays and\r\n  special events; (3) utilize Grandparents for child care services for\r\n  Granddaughter; and (4) perform real estate brokerage services for the sale of\r\n  Grandparents' California home at no charge.[3]Â \r\n  Grandparents assert as an inducement to enter the contract, Mother and Father\r\n  promised Grandparents they would remain an integral of Granddaughter's life.Â  \r\nIn May 2007, Mother\r\n  and Father made the decision to stop allowing Grandparents to have contact with\r\n  Granddaughter.Â  As a result, on March 27, 2008, Grandparents filed a complaint\r\n  alleging breach of contract (specific performance), breach of contract\r\n  (recission), breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, intentional\r\n  infliction of emotional distress (IIED), negligent infliction of emotional\r\n  distress, breach of contract (damages), and tortious interference with a\r\n  contract.Â  Thereafter, Grandparents filed\r\n  an amended complaint to include an additional cause of action for breach of\r\n  contract (constructive trust).[4] Subsequently,Grandparents\r\n  dismissed their first cause of action for breach of contract (specific\r\n  performance).Â  Not only were Mother and Father named defendants, but Grandparents\r\n  also named &quot;Does 1 thru 20&quot; as defendants responsible for enticing\r\n  Mother and Father to breach the alleged oral contract.Â  \r\nIn their\r\n  complaint, Grandparents alleged they fully performed under the contract;\r\n  however, they maintained Mother and Father did not perform.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Grandparents contended Mother and Father had &quot;prevented all meaningful\r\n  contact&quot; between themselves and Granddaughter since May 2007.Â \r\n  Additionally, Grandparents asserted Mother and Father's conduct negatively\r\n  impacted their relationship with Granddaughter.Â  \r\nThe same day\r\n  Grandparents filed their complaint, Grandparents also filed a motion for a\r\n  temporary restraining order prohibiting Mother and Father from disclosing the\r\n  lawsuit or the underlying dispute to Granddaughter.Â  In their motion,\r\n  Grandparents asserted the &quot;central issue&quot; in the lawsuit was their\r\n  ability to have a relationship with Granddaughter.\r\nDuring the\r\n  pendency of the action in circuit court, Grandparents continued attempts of\r\n  enforcing the alleged contract by contacting Mother and Father as an attempt to\r\n  gain access to Granddaughter.Â  During this time, Grandparents did not attempt\r\n  to develop any relationship with Grandson.Â  Unbeknownst to Mother and Father,\r\n  Grandmother also volunteered at Granddaughter's school.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Grandparents drove past Mother and Father's house.Â  Eventually, counsel for\r\n  Mother and Father requested Grandparents cease any efforts to contact or\r\n  communicate with Mother and Father.Â  However, Grandfather responded, stating he\r\n  would &quot;continue contact . . . as we deem appropriate.Â  Especially since we\r\n  have grave concerns for their physical safety.&quot;Â  According to Mother,\r\n  Grandparents offered to &quot;resolve&quot; the law suit if Mother and Father\r\n  agreed to visitation.Â Â  Further, Grandfather stated their &quot;goal is simply\r\n  to be a part of [Mother] and [Granddaughter's] lives.Â  If you no[] longer want\r\n  us in your life, so be it.Â  Should you choose to abandon us that decision\r\n  should not be forced on [Granddaughter]. . . . However, if you are determined\r\n  to exclude us, you may be certain we will not simply go away.&quot;Â \r\n  Grandfather mailed numerous letters to Mother indicating Grandparents' continued\r\n  desire to be a part of Granddaughter's life and demonstrated an unwillingness\r\n  to accept a refusal on their part.Â  Thereafter, Mother and Father filed a\r\n  motion for a temporary restraining order and injunction, which the circuit\r\n  court granted.Â  \r\nOn May 6, 2008,\r\n  Mother and Father filed a motion to dismiss Grandparents' complaint pursuant to\r\n  Rule 12(b)(1) and (6), SCRCP.Â  At the hearing, Grandparents made a motion to\r\n  dismiss their first cause of action for specific performance.Â  As a result, the\r\n  only remaining causes of action involved alleged money damages. At the hearing,\r\n  Grandparents acknowledged South Carolina law prevented the enforcement of a\r\n  contract for visitation.Â  \r\nFollowing a\r\n  hearing, the circuit court dismissed all of Grandparents' causes of action.Â  On\r\n  October 14, 2008, the circuit court issued an order clarifying it did not have\r\n  jurisdiction to order grandparent visitation.Â  The Â circuit court then found\r\n  Grandparents failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action\r\n  for breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  As a\r\n  result, the circuit court dismissed Grandparents' complaint with prejudice.Â \r\n  This appeal followed. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â \r\n  Jurisdiction\r\nGrandparents\r\n  argue the circuit court erred in finding it lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nFamily courts are\r\n  of limited jurisdiction.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530 (2010).Â  Family courts have jurisdiction over\r\n  grandparent visitation only if parents are deceased, divorced, or living\r\n  separate and apart.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(33)\r\n  (2010).Â  However, the family court\r\n  generally does not have jurisdiction to enforce contractual agreements not\r\n  incorporated or merged into court orders.Â  Lighty v. S.C. Dep't of Soc.\r\n    Servs., 285 S.C. 508, 510, 330 S.E.2d 529, 530&nbsp;(1985).Â  Rather, the circuit court is vested with\r\n  jurisdiction over an action based upon a contract.Â  Id. at 509, 330\r\n  S.E.2d at 530.Â  Further, the award of\r\n  money damages is &quot;beyond the jurisdiction&quot; of the family court.Â  Peake\r\n    v. Peake, 284 S.C. 591, 593, 327 S.E.2d 375, 376&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985); see\r\n      also Thompson v. Ballentine, 298 S.C. 289, 292, 379 S.E.2d 896,\r\n  898&nbsp;(1989) (explaining that section 63-3-530 of the South Carolina Code (2010)\r\n  does not give the family court authority to award money damages).\r\nWe agree with the\r\n  circuit court's finding it lacked jurisdiction to order grandparent visitation because\r\n  the family court has jurisdiction over grandparent visitation.Â  Moreover, Grandparents admitted they were not attempting to enforce visitation\r\n  rights and Grandparents dismissed their demand for specific performance of the alleged\r\n  contract.Â  Rather, Grandparents' complaint alleged breach of contract and\r\n  IIED.Â  All of Â Grandparents'\r\n  causes of action requested the following forms of relief: (1) recission of the contract, (2) damages, and (3) the\r\n  imposition of a constructive trust.Â  All of these are remedies within the\r\n  circuit court's jurisdiction.Â  Thus, these actions were properly before the\r\n  circuit court when the circuit court reviewed Grandparents breach of contract\r\n  and IIED claims on the merits.\r\nII.Â  Breach of Contract\r\nGrandparents\r\n  argue they pled all the essential elements of breach of contract, and the\r\n  circuit court erred in dismissing their complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe circuit court may dismiss\r\n  a claim when the defendant demonstrates the plaintiff has failed &quot;to state facts sufficient to\r\n  constitute a cause of action&quot; in the pleadings filed with the court.Â  Rule\r\n  12(b)(6).Â  The trial court's ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion &quot;must be\r\n  bottomed and premised solely upon the allegations set forth by the plaintiff.&quot;Â  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 232-33, 553 S.E.2d 496, 499-500&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2001).Â  The motion will not be sustained if the facts alleged and the\r\n  inferences reasonably deducible from the pleadings would entitle the plaintiff\r\n  to relief on any theory of the case.Â  Id.Â  &quot;The question to be\r\n  considered is whether, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the\r\n  pleadings articulate any valid claim for relief.&quot;Â  Id.Â  This court\r\n  applies the same standard of review as the trial court in reviewing the dismissal of\r\n  an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).Â  Cole Vision Corp. v. Hobbs, 384 S.C. 283,\r\n  287, 680 S.E.2d 923, 925&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).Â  \r\n&quot;The general rule, well\r\n  established in South Carolina, is that courts will not enforce a contract when\r\n  the subject matter of the contract or an act required for performance violates\r\n  public policy as expressed in constitutional provisions, statutory law, or judicial\r\n  decisions.&quot;Â  White v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., 360 S.C. 366, 371,\r\n  601 S.E.2d 342, 345&nbsp;(2004); see also Batchelor v. Am. Health\r\n    Ins. Co., 234 S.C. 103, 112, 107 S.E.2d 36, 40 (1959) (noting that\r\n  contracts violating public policy as expressed in constitutional provisions,\r\n  statutes, or judicial decisions are void).Â  Public policy suggests that &quot;South\r\n  Carolina, as parens patriae, protects and safeguards the welfare\r\n  of its children.&quot;Â  Mr. T v. Ms. T, 378 S.C. 127, 138, 662 S.E.2d\r\n  413, 419&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2008) (quoting Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 145,\r\n  245 S.E.2d 612, 617 (1978)).Â  &quot;This principle is founded upon the state's\r\n  duty to protect those of its citizens who are unable because of infancy to take\r\n  care of themselves, and on the right of the child, as citizen and ward, to the\r\n  state's protection.&quot;Â  Id. Â \r\nFlorida has held: &quot;It is\r\n  well established that a court is not bound by an agreement of parents regarding\r\n  child support, custody, or visitation.&quot;Â  Higgins v. Higgins, 945\r\n  So. 2d 593, 596&nbsp;(Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006); see also Taylor v.\r\n    Kennedy, 649 So. 2d 270, 271-72&nbsp;(Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1994) (declining\r\n  to recognize claims for specific performance of a contract for visitation in\r\n  favor of a non-parent or a child's right to petition a Florida court to order\r\n  his or her parent to permit visitation with third parties).Â  The Â Higgins court\r\n  explained: &quot;One important reason for this principle is that the court must\r\n  guard against the possibility that a parent might bargain away valuable rights\r\n  of a child for reasons unrelated to the child's best interests.&quot;Â  945 So. 2d\r\n  at 596.Â  Although not pertaining to visitation, Mississippi has held:Â  &quot;The\r\n  custody of a child is not subject to being traded, or possession granted or\r\n  withheld as if it were a chattel, and neither is its custody subject to being\r\n  used as a lever to gain a favorable bargaining position as to the division of\r\n  property between the parents.&quot;Â  Reno v. Reno, 176 So. 2d 58,\r\n  62&nbsp;(Miss. 1965).\r\nWe recognize the difficult\r\n  situation Grandparents are in because for reasons not set forth in the Record\r\n  on Appeal, Mother and Father have determined that Granddaughter should no\r\n  longer have contact with Grandparents.Â  Although this is not a family court\r\n  action, the heart of the alleged contract involves Grandparents attempt to have\r\n  access to Granddaughter, and we are mindful that in family court there is a\r\n  presumption that a fit parent's decision regarding grandparent visitation is in\r\n  a child's best interests.Â  See Marquez v. Caudill, 376 S.C. 229,\r\n  248, 656 S.E.2d 737, 747&nbsp;(2008) (&quot;[I]t is well-settled that parents\r\n  have a protected liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their\r\n  children and that this is a fundamental right protected by the Due Process\r\n  Clause. . . . [T]he court must give 'special weight' to a fit parent's decision\r\n  regarding visitation.Â  A court considering grandparents visitation over a\r\n  parents objection must allow a presumption that a fit parents decision is in\r\n  the child's best interest.&quot;).Â  The South Carolina Legislature has specifically\r\n  limited the circumstances in which a grandparent is entitled to visitation and\r\n  none of those are present in this case.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-3-530(A)(33) (2010) (explaining the family court may &quot;order visitation\r\n  for the grandparent of a minor child where either or both parents of the minor\r\n  child is or are deceased, or are living separate and apart in different\r\n  habitats . . . ).Â  As a result, Grandparents are attempting to enforce a\r\n  contract that involves the exchange of money, among other things, as\r\n  consideration to have &quot;unfettered contact&quot; with Granddaughter.Â  \r\nWhile it is unfortunate\r\n  relations among family members have degenerated to this point, allowing such a\r\n  contract to be enforceable would be contrary to this state's interest in\r\n  protecting children and would permit a parent to bargain away valuable rights\r\n  of a child for reasons unrelated to the child's best interest.Â  As a result,\r\n  allowing grandparents and parents the ability to contract away rights not\r\n  expressly authorized by law would contravene public policy.Â  Accordingly, Â we\r\n  find the contract is unenforceable because it violates public policy, and the\r\n  circuit court did not err in finding the complaint failed to state facts\r\n  sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â \r\n  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress \r\nGrandparents\r\n  contend they stated sufficient facts to constitute an action for IIED.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\nIn order to recover for the IIED,\r\n  a plaintiff must establish:\r\n\r\n  (1) the\r\n    defendant intentionally or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress or\r\n    was certain or substantially certain that such distress would result from his\r\n    conduct; (2) the conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to exceed all\r\n    possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious, and utterly\r\n    intolerable in a civilized community; (3) the actions of the defendant caused\r\n    the plaintiff's emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress suffered by\r\n    the plaintiff was severe so that no reasonable man could be expected to endure\r\n    it.Â  \r\n\r\nFord v. Hutson, 276 S.C. 157, 162, 276 S.E.2d 776, 778-79&nbsp;(1981)\r\n  (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).Â  \r\nGrandparents alleged in their\r\n  complaint Grandfather &quot;is disabled, of frail and ill health, and is easily\r\n  upset and injured.&quot;Â  Further, they alleged Mother and Father\r\n\r\n  engaged\r\n    in an intentional course of conduct by which they intended to physically harm\r\n    [Grandfather] and which did, in fact, harm [Grandfather].Â  Such conduct\r\n    included breaking [Grandfather's] heart by alienating [Granddaughter] and\r\n    keeping her from him and preventing him from enjoying a loving relationship\r\n    with [Granddaughter].Â  As a result, [Grandfather] suffered extreme emotional\r\n    distress and physical harm.Â  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Grandparents stated\r\n  Mother and Father's conduct was &quot;extreme and outrageous&quot; and the\r\n  &quot;intentional acts exceeded the bounds allowed in a civilized\r\n  society.&quot;Â  \r\nBased solely on the facts alleged\r\n  and the inferences reasonably deducible from the complaint, we find that Grandparents\r\n  are not entitled to relief.Â  Mother and Father decided Grandparents should not\r\n  be allowed to visit their Granddaughter, and we do not find this amounts to\r\n  extreme and outrageous conduct that is utterly intolerable in a civilized\r\n  community and so severe that no reasonable man could be expected to endure it.Â  See Hutson, 276 S.C. at 162, 276 S.E.2d at 778-79.Â  As a result,\r\n  Grandparents failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action\r\n  for IIED, and the circuit court did not err in dismissing this cause of action.\r\n  Â Â \r\nIII.Â  Dismissal With\r\n  Prejudice\r\nGrandparents assert their complaint\r\n  should not have been dismissed with prejudice.Â  We disagree. \r\nGrandparents cannot possibly\r\n  amend their circuit court complaint to state facts sufficient to constitute a\r\n  cause of action because the alleged contract was in violation of public\r\n  policy.Â  See Spence v. Spence, Â 368 S.C. 106, 129, 628 S.E.2d\r\n  869, 881&nbsp;(2006) (explaining that typically a plaintiff is given an\r\n  opportunity to file and serve an amended complaint; however &quot;if it appears\r\n  to a certainty that no relief can be granted under any set of facts that can be\r\n  proved in support of its allegations&quot; the complaint may be dismissed with\r\n  prejudice).Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in dismissing\r\n  Grandparents' complaint with prejudice.Â  \r\nIV.Â  Brokerage Services\r\nGrandparents maintain the circuit\r\n  court erred in finding the promise concerning brokerage services violated the\r\n  statute of limitations and that brokerage agreement contained an arbitration\r\n  clause.Â  However, we find Grandparents abandoned this issue on appeal because\r\n  Grandparents failed to cite any authority in support of this contention.Â  See Hunt v. S.C. Forestry Comm'n, 358 S.C. 564, 573, 595 S.E.2d 846,\r\n  851&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (&quot;Issues raised in a brief but not supported by\r\n  authority are deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal.&quot;); see\r\n    also In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001)\r\n  (&quot;A bald assertion, without supporting argument, does not preserve an\r\n  issue for appeal.&quot;).\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nBased on the foregoing, the\r\n  circuit court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.[5]\r\nKONDUROS, GEATHERS, and\r\n  LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The residential listing agreement for Grandparents'\r\n  property in California indicates their property was listed for sale on December\r\n  5, 2004, and the seller's closing statement reflects the closing for the\r\n  property occurred on February 7, 2005.Â  \r\n[3] We note the residential listing agreement states\r\n  Mother, as broker, received five percent of the listing price.Â  \r\n[4] Grandparents also filed numerous lis pendens on various real property Mother and Father either owned or were\r\n  associated with.Â  Â \r\n[5] This court need not address Grandparents' remaining\r\n  arguments because the determination of the contract issue is dispositive.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 591, 598&nbsp;(1999) (finding this court need not address issues when its\r\n  determination of a prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-331","title":"State v.

Elliott, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General Deborah R.J.

Second\r\n  Injury Fund, of Columbia, Terri Morrill Lynch, Matthew J. Story, Margaret M. Urbanic, of Charleston, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\nJarrel L. Wigger of N. Charleston, John S.\r\n  Nichols, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\nPER CURIAM: Â The\r\n  South Carolina Uninsured Employers' Fund (Fund) appeals the order of the\r\n  circuit court, which reversed the decision of the South Carolina Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commission (Commission) denying benefits to Rajkumari Puniyani,\r\n  mother of deceased employee Virendra Puniyani, and remanded the case to the\r\n  Commission.Â  We find the order on appeal is not immediately appealable and\r\n  therefore dismiss.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn November 14, 2002, Virendra\r\n  Puniyani was killed by a co-worker while working at the Fast Point Gas\r\n  Station.Â  Mrs. Puniyani brought this action seeking workers' compensation\r\n  benefits.Â  As the Employer, Avni Grocers, did not have workers' compensation\r\n  insurance, the Fund defended the action.Â  The single commissioner held Mrs.\r\n  Puniyani failed to prove Avni Grocers regularly employed four or more employees\r\n  as required by section 42-1-150 of the South Carolina Code (1985) to be subject\r\n  to the jurisdiction of the Commission.Â  The Appellate Panel of the Commission\r\n  affirmed.Â  The circuit court, however, reversed and remanded the matter to the\r\n  Commission for further proceedings consistent with its order.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMrs. Puniyani argues the\r\n  order of the circuit court is not immediately appealable.Â  We agree.\r\nOur courts â€œhave consistently\r\n  held that an order of the circuit court remanding a case for additional\r\n  proceedings before an administrative agency is not directly appealable.â€Â  Montjoy\r\n    v. Asten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 52, 446 S.E.2d 618, 618 (1994).Â  The\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court recently reiterated that appeals from\r\n  administrative agencies may only be from final decisions.Â  Charlotte-Mecklenburg\r\n    Hosp. Auth. v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, S.C. Sup. Ct.\r\n  Order dated April 8, 2010 (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 14 at 85).Â  It explained the\r\n  general appealability statute, section 14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (1976 &amp; Supp. 2009), does not apply to appeals from administrative\r\n  agencies.Â  Id. at 87.Â  The court overruled this court's opinion Canteen\r\n    v. McLeod Regional Medical Center, 384 S.C. 617, 682 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009) to the extent it relied on section 14-3-330 to permit the appeal of\r\n  interlocutory orders of the administrative law court or an administrative\r\n  agency.[1]Â  Id.Â  \r\nA judgment is not final when\r\n  there is some further act that must be done by the court prior to a\r\n  determination of the rights of the parties or when the judgment determines the applicable\r\n  law while leaving open questions of fact.Â  Id. at 88.Â  &quot;A final\r\n  judgment disposes of the whole subject matter of the action or terminates the\r\n  particular proceeding or action, leaving nothing to be done but to enforce by\r\n  execution what has been determined.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe order on appeal remands\r\n  the matter to the Commission for further proceedings.Â  It is not a final\r\n  judgment.Â  Thus, the order is not immediately appealable.Â  \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.Â  \r\nFEW, C.J. and HUFF and\r\n  THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It also overruled Oakwood Landfill, Inc. v.

McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General\r\n  John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Molly R. Crum, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tDeputy Chief Appellate Defender Wanda H. Carter, of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  This post-conviction relief (PCR) matter arises out of Respondent Edmund Goins'\r\n  conviction for assault and battery with intent to kill (ABWIK) and two convictions\r\n  of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN), based on three\r\n  indictments for ABWIK.Â  This court granted the State's petition for certiorari\r\n  to address whether the PCR court erred in granting relief.Â  We reverse.[1]Â  \r\nThe State argues there is no probative evidence to support the\r\n  finding that trial counsel was ineffective based on the combination of\r\n  counsel's failure to present evidence regarding Goins' mental disorder and\r\n  limited contact with Goins before trial.Â  Without deciding the ultimate reach\r\n  of the cumulative error doctrine in the PCR context, we find it appropriate to\r\n  resolve this case on the lack of prejudice.Â  See Porter v. McCollum,\r\n  130 S.Ct. 447, 455-56 (2009) (&quot;We do not require a defendant to show that\r\n  counsel's deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome of [the\r\n  trial], but rather that he establish a probability sufficient to undermine\r\n  confidence in that outcome.&quot;) (internal quotations omitted); Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 697 (1984) (&quot;[A] court need not determine\r\n  whether counsel's performance was deficient before examining the prejudice\r\n  suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies. . . .Â  If it\r\n  is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack of\r\n  sufficient prejudice, . . . that course should be followed.&quot;); Lorenzen\r\n    v. State, 376 S.C. 521, 535, 657 S.E.2d 771, 779 (2008) (holding that where\r\n  none of the errors alleged are meritorious, the PCR court erred in finding the\r\n  cumulative effect of the alleged errors established a claim of ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel).\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Goins asserted that he was bipolar and that\r\n  trial counsel should have investigated Goins' diagnosis and requested a\r\n  competency evaluation.Â  While Goins also testified at his criminal trial that\r\n  he was bipolar and manic depressive, we note Goins did not put forth any\r\n  evidence that he was either insane at the time of the assaults or incompetent\r\n  at the time of trial.Â  See Jeter v. State, 308 S.C. 230, 233, 417\r\n  S.E.2d 594, 596 (1992) (affirming the denial of PCR where the petitioner failed\r\n  to present live medical testimony at the PCR hearing to show &quot;a reasonable\r\n  probability that he was either insane at the time of the [incident] or\r\n  incompetent at the time of [trial].&quot;) (internal quotation omitted); Daniel\r\n    v. State, 282 S.C. 155, 158-59, 317 S.E.2d 746, 748 (1984) (reversing the\r\n  grant of relief where there is no evidence showing that the failure of counsel\r\n  to investigate the defendant's mental condition was prejudicial).Â  \r\nMoreover, as to the relief granted on the ABWIK conviction, we\r\n  find that the PCR court erred as a matter of law in determining that Goins was\r\n  prejudiced by the failure to introduce the evidence at issue.Â  The PCR judge\r\n  based his analysis upon the fact that a jury could interpret the applicant's\r\n  conduct as impulsive and dangerous, but not with malice aforethought; thus, the\r\n  court opined the jury could return a verdict of ABHAN, as opposed to the\r\n  greater offense of ABWIK.Â  This partial responsibility analysis is tantamount\r\n  to a recognition of the defense of diminished capacity, which we do not\r\n  recognize in this state.Â  See Gill v. State, 346 S.C. 209, 220,\r\n  552 S.E.2d 26, 32 (2001) (upholding the trial court's refusal to charge\r\n  diminished capacity where Gill argued his borderline intellectual capacity\r\n  affected his ability to achieve the requisite mens rea for the crime\r\n  charged because South Carolina does not recognize the diminished capacity\r\n  defense); State v. Santiago, 370 S.C. 153, 162, 634 S.E.2d 23, 28 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006) (finding the trial judge properly excluded testimony that Santiago's\r\n  Asperger's disorder caused him to fear for his life because South Carolina does\r\n  not recognize the diminished capacity defense).Â  Thus, while acknowledging\r\n  Goins testified at his criminal trial about his bipolar mental condition and\r\n  his manic depression, we find Goins failed to establish a probability sufficient\r\n  to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.Â  See Porter,\r\n  130 S.Ct. at 455-56.\r\nAs to\r\n  the two ABHAN convictions, the PCR court erred in granting relief on Goins' two\r\n  convictions for the lesser included offenses of ABHAN based on cumulative error,\r\n  as there is no probative evidence of prejudice in the record to support those\r\n  findings.Â  See Hutto v. State, 387 S.C. 244, 244, 692 S.E.2d 196,\r\n  197 (2010) (stating a PCR court's ruling should be upheld on appeal only if it\r\n  is supported by any evidence of probative value in the record); Lorenzen,\r\n  376 S.C. at 535, 657 S.E.2d at 779.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the grant of post-conviction relief is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nFEW, C.J., THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-340","title":"Blackwell v.

As to whether the trial court erred in denying Carr's motion\r\n  for a directed verdict:Â  State v.\r\n    Hernandez, 382 S.C. 620, 624, 677\r\n  S.E.2d 603, 605&nbsp;(2009) (&quot;If there is any direct evidence or\r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of\r\n  the accused, [this court] must find the case was properly submitted to the\r\n  jury.&quot;); State v. Stuckey, 347 S.C. 484, 499 n.7, 556 S.E.2d 403,\r\n  411 n.7&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (noting this court considers only the existence or\r\n  nonexistence of evidence in reviewing the denial of a directed verdict motion,\r\n  thus witness credibility is not a proper inquiry for consideration).\r\n2. As\r\n  to whether the trial court erred in denying Carr's motion for severance: The\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Carr's motion for\r\n  severance. Â State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 282, 523 S.E.2d 173,\r\n  176&nbsp;(1999) (&quot;Motions for a severance . . . are addressed to the\r\n  discretion of the trial court.Â  Absent a showing of an abuse of discretion,\r\n  this Court will not disturb the trial court's ruling on appeal.&quot;)\r\n  (citations omitted); Hughes v. State, 346 S.C. 554, 559, 552 S.E.2d 315,\r\n  317&nbsp;(2001) (&quot;An appellate court should not reverse a conviction\r\n  achieved at a joint trial in the absence of a reasonable probability that the\r\n  defendant would have obtained a more favorable result at a separate\r\n  trial.&quot;).Â  Further, the trial court's cautionary instruction protected\r\n  Carr's individual rights and ensured he was not prejudiced by the joint trial.Â  See State v. Holland, 261 S.C. 488, 494, 201 S.E.2d 118,\r\n  121&nbsp;(1973) (finding trial court's cautionary instructions to the jury\r\n  protected the rights of each individual appellant and ensured there was no prejudice\r\n  arising out of their joint trial). \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-343","title":"Briket v.

Blackwell, III and Maureen\r\n  Blackwell's (collectively the Blackwells) harassment. On May 28, 2008, a permanent restraining order\r\n  hearing was held, and the magistrate's court issued a restraining order\r\n  effective until May 28, 2009.Â  Thereafter, the circuit court affirmed the\r\n  magistrate's court grant of a restraining order.Â  The Blackwells now appeal to\r\n  this court.Â  The restraining order\r\n  expired by its own terms on a May\r\n  28, 2009, thus we find a ruling on the issues pending before this court will\r\n  have no practical effect on the parties to this appeal.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  dismiss[1] the appeal as moot.Â  See Curtis v.

Williams, of Moncks Corner, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this family court case, Anna Lee Shaw (Wife) appeals from an order of Judge\r\n  Tunstall granting Cupid Shaw (Husband) sole authority to conduct listing\r\n  arrangements, negotiations, and the final sale of certain jointly held\r\n  property, free of interference or control by Wife, and an order of Judge\r\n  Konduros, on behalf of Judge Tunstall, denying Wifeâ€™s motions pursuant to Rules\r\n  59 and 60, SCRCP.Â  Wife contends (1) Judge Tunstall erred in proceeding with a\r\n  hearing when another judge had retained jurisdiction of the matter and no\r\n  written order was entered by the prior judge relinquishing jurisdiction; (2)\r\n  Judge Tunstall erred and abused his discretion by issuing an order on Husbandâ€™s\r\n  rule to show cause which effectively modified the underlying order and granted\r\n  new relief not requested by Husband; (3) Judge Tunstall erred in proceeding\r\n  with the hearing on March 17, 2008 knowing that the defendant Jerome Shaw had\r\n  not been notified of the hearing or dismissed from the action as Jerome was a\r\n  necessary party to the case; (4) the underlying orders upon which Judge\r\n  Tunstall based his ruling were without subject matter jurisdiction or were\r\n  ambiguous and unenforceable; (5) Judge Tunstall was barred by equity from\r\n  enforcing the order of Judge Cate filed April 26, 2008 and was it an abuse of\r\n  discretion by Judge Tunstall to enforce the order.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.Â  We decline to rule on\r\n  whether (1) Judge Tunstall erred in proceeding with a hearing when another\r\n  judge had retained jurisdiction of the matter and no written order was entered\r\n  by the prior judge relinquishing jurisdiction; (2) Judge Tunstall erred in\r\n  proceeding with the hearing on March 17, 2008 knowing that the defendant Jerome\r\n  Shaw had not been notified of the hearing or dismissed from the action as\r\n  Jerome was a necessary party to the case; and (3) Judge Tunstall was barred by\r\n  equity from enforcing the order of Judge Cate filed April 26, 2008 and whether\r\n  it was an abuse of discretion by Judge Tunstall to enforce the order.Â  These\r\n  issues clearly are not preserved for our review.Â  Payne\r\n    v. Payne, 382 S.C. 62, 70, 674 S.E.2d 515,\r\n  519 (Ct. App. 2009) (â€œTo be preserved for appellate review, an issue must have\r\n  been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.Â  Issues not raised and ruled\r\n  upon in the trial court will not be considered on appeal.â€); see also Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388, 399, 608 S.E.2d 849, 854 (2005) (finding\r\n  issue raised for first time in a Rule 59, SCRCP motion is not preserved for\r\n  review); Gartside v. Gartside, 383 S.C. 35, 43, 677 S.E.2d 621, 625 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009) (a party cannot use a motion to reconsider, alter or amend a\r\n  judgment to present an issue that could have been raised prior to the judgment\r\n  but was not).\r\n2.Â  We find no merit to\r\n  Wifeâ€™s assertion Judge Tunstall erred and abused his discretion by issuing an\r\n  order which effectively modified Judge Cateâ€™s order and granted new relief that\r\n  was not requested by Husband.Â  Assuming arguendo that the issue is properly preserved\r\n  because Wife could not have raised the matter until her post-trial motion since\r\n  she did not know of it prior to the judgment, it is clear Judge Tunstall did\r\n  not modify clear and unambiguous terms of a divorce or separation agreement as\r\n  prohibited by Nicholson v. Nicholson, 378 S.C. 523, 532, 663 S.E.2d 74,\r\n  79 (Ct. App. 2008), but simply construed Judge Cateâ€™s order incorporating the partiesâ€™\r\n  agreement to effect the intent of the judge and the parties, and did so in\r\n  accordance with principles of equity and the rule that implied in every such\r\n  agreement is a requirement of reasonableness.Â  Davis v. Davis, 372 S.C.\r\n  64, 75, 641 S.E.2d 446, 451 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Further, a family court may\r\n  exercise its power in equity to ensure a just result.Â  Buckley v. Shealy,\r\n  370 S.C. 317, 323-24, 635 S.E.2d 76, 79 (2006) (citing Ex Parte Dibble,\r\n  279 S.C. 592, 595-96, 310 S.E.2d 440, 442 (Ct. App. 1983) for the proposition\r\n  that all courts have the inherent power to do all things reasonably necessary\r\n  to ensure that just results are reached to the fullest extent possible).Â \r\n  Additionally, in consideration of Husbandâ€™s petition, as well as his argument\r\n  and presentation of evidence at the hearing, it is equally clear that Judge\r\n  Tunstall did not, as asserted by Wife, grant Husband relief not requested.Â \r\n  Finally, Wifeâ€™s argument in this respect may be considered abandoned on appeal\r\n  based on the conclusory nature of her argument and failure to cite any law in\r\n  support thereof.Â  See Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600,\r\n  608 S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (noting when an appellant fails to cite\r\n  any supporting authority for his position and fails to provide any argument or\r\n  makes conclusory arguments, the appellant abandons the issue on appeal).\r\n3.Â  We further find subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction was not implicated, and because Wife failed to challenge\r\n  the family courtâ€™s authority at the time of the numerous hearings and failed to\r\n  directly appeal the previous orders, the matter is not preserved.Â  We likewise\r\n  hold Wifeâ€™s ambiguity argument is not preserved as she failed to raise the\r\n  issue before Judge Tunstall.Â  \r\nSubject matter jurisdiction\r\n  refers to a courtâ€™s constitutional or statutory power to adjudicate a\r\n  particular case.Â  Johnson v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Prob., Parole, &amp; Pardon\r\n    Servs., 372 S.C. 279, 284, 641 S.E.2d 895, 897 (2007).Â  More simply, it is\r\n  the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the\r\n  proceedings in question belong.Â  Coon v. Coon, 364 S.C. 563, 566, 614\r\n  S.E.2d 616, 617 (2005).Â  Numerous of our courtsâ€™ cases have held that subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction is not implicated when the court possesses the power to\r\n  hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in\r\n  question belong.Â  Gainey v. Gainey, 382 S.C. 414, 424, 675 S.E.2d 792,\r\n  797 (Ct. App. 2009). Â The family court does not have jurisdiction to apportion\r\n  nonmarital property.Â  Simmons v. Simmons, 370 S.C. 109, 113-14, 634\r\n  S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 2006); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2007) (repealed\r\n  and replaced by Â§ 20-3-630); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(B) (Supp. 2009).Â \r\n  However, the family court undoubtedly has jurisdiction to determine whether\r\n  property is marital or nonmarital.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420\r\n  (A)(2)(Supp. 2007) (repealed and replaced by Â§ 63-3-530(A)(2)) (providing the\r\n  family court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine actions â€œ[f]or\r\n  divorce a vinculo matrimonii, separate support and maintenance, legal\r\n  separation, and in other marital litigation between the parties, and for\r\n  settlement of all legal and equitable rights of the parties in the actions in\r\n  and to the real and personal property of the marriage . . . .â€); S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 63-3-530(A)(2) (2010) (likewise providing the family court has exclusive\r\n  jurisdiction â€œto hear and determine actions for divorce a vinculo matrimonii,\r\n  separate support and maintenance, legal separation, and in other marital\r\n  litigation between the parties, and for settlement of all legal and equitable\r\n  rights of the parties in the actions in and to the real and personal property\r\n  of the marriage . . . .â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-620(A) (Supp. 2009) (stating, â€œ[i]n\r\n  a proceeding for divorce a vinculo matrimonii or separate support and\r\n  maintenance, . . . and in other marital litigation between the parties, the\r\n  court shall make a final equitable apportionment between the parties of the\r\n  partiesâ€™ marital property upon request by either party in the pleadingsâ€); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-630(A) (Supp. 2009) (defining marital property and that which,\r\n  by exception, constitutes nonmarital property). Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nImplicit in the courtâ€™s\r\n  orders is that the 1.3 acres constituted marital property.[2]Â \r\n  The determination of the marital nature of the property in question arose in\r\n  the course of marital litigation and was therefore within the family courtâ€™s\r\n  jurisdiction under former section 20-7-420(A)(2) and current section\r\n  63-3-530(A)(2).Â  Thus, the family court has subject matter jurisdiction over\r\n  the matter.Â  Additionally, Wife did not challenge the family courtâ€™s authority\r\n  over the property in question at the time of the 1993 hearing, nor even the\r\n  2000 hearing, nor does it appear she filed any direct appeals from either of\r\n  those orders.Â  The issue of the courtâ€™s authority could have been raised in\r\n  those hearings but was not, and because the matter does not implicate subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction, it may not simply be raised at any time, and is therefore\r\n  unpreserved.Â  See Gainey, 382 S.C. at 424-25, 675 S.E.2d at 797\r\n  (holding subject matter jurisdiction was not implicated in action for separate\r\n  maintenance and support and approval of the partiesâ€™ agreement where wife\r\n  subsequently asserted the parties were not living separate and apart; wifeâ€™s\r\n  failure to challenge the family courtâ€™s authority at the time of the hearing\r\n  and failure to directly appeal the order rendered the matter unpreserved and\r\n  her attempt to assert the courtâ€™s lack of subject matter jurisdiction some\r\n  thirteen months later in a post-trial motion was properly denied).Â  Because the\r\n  court has subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether property is marital\r\n  or nonmarital, and because Wife did not challenge the implicit rulings of the\r\n  family court that the property in question was marital, this issue is not\r\n  preserved and Wifeâ€™s attempt to classify the matter as a subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction issue will not save her from the preservation rules of our\r\n  courts.Â Â  \r\nFurther there is no merit to\r\n  Wifeâ€™s contention the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction by virtue of the\r\n  courtâ€™s failure to join Jerome as a necessary party to the 2000 action because\r\n  the property had already been conveyed to Jerome.Â  At this point the orders\r\n  implicitly provided, and Wife agreed, that the property in question was\r\n  marital.Â  The fact that Wife may have deeded the property to a third party in\r\n  contravention of the family courtâ€™s order did not divest the court of subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction over Husbandâ€™s petition to hold Wife in contempt for\r\n  violation of the courtâ€™s order.\r\nLastly, as noted by Husband,\r\n  Wife failed to raise any issue concerning ambiguity in the 1993 order of Judge\r\n  Creech before Judge Tunstall at the 2008 hearing.Â  Accordingly, this argument\r\n  is not preserved for review.Â  See Payne, 382 S.C. at 70, 674 S.E.2d at 519 (stating to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review, an issue must have been raised to and ruled\r\n  upon by the trial judge, and issues not raised and ruled upon in the trial\r\n  court will not be considered on appeal); Dixon, 362 S.C. at 399, 608\r\n  S.E.2d at 854 (finding issue raised for first time in a Rule 59, SCRCP motion\r\n  is not preserved for review).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and HUFF and\r\n  WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] We note there is no merit to Wifeâ€™s contention\r\n  that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Husband expressly\r\n  waived interest in her inherited property and the 1.3 acres was inherited\r\n  property.Â  Wife has taken inconsistent positions that (1) the property was\r\n  given to Jerome by her father and she merely held the property in trust and\r\n  that (2) the property was inherited by her.Â  A review of the record reveals\r\n  that the property was actually deeded to Wife in 1985, not inherited by her.\r\n  She then deeded the property to Jerome in 1997. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2010-UP-345","title":"Hensley v.

Garrett appeals the trial court's order denying his motion to compel\r\n  arbitration.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nBilly Hensley brought this\r\n  action against Garrett and Carolina First Investments, of which Garrett was the\r\n  President, on June 21, 2005.Â  He asserted causes of action for negligence and\r\n  violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act arising from\r\n  Garrett's advice to invest his retirement funds with Thaxton Life Partners, Inc.,\r\n  which has since filed for bankruptcy.Â  Garrett filed a pro se answer on September 4, 2005, asserting several affirmative defenses and a\r\n  counterclaim.Â  \r\nOn October 11, 2005, Garrett\r\n  served a motion to dismiss/stay action and compel arbitration.Â  He asserted he\r\n  was entitled to arbitration under the &quot;Senior Subordinated Term Note\r\n  Subscription Agreement&quot; Hensley signed when purchasing the note of Thaxton\r\n  Life Partners.Â  The trial court denied the motion, finding Garrett was not a\r\n  party to the contract that provided for arbitration.Â  Garrett filed a timely\r\n  motion to alter or amend.Â  \r\nPrior to the hearing on the\r\n  motion, the parties entered into an agreement in which Garrett withdrew his\r\n  motion to alter or amend and agreed to not appeal the court's order denying his\r\n  motion to compel arbitration.Â  The parties agreed neither party would take the\r\n  deposition of the other prior to Garrett's trial date for charges of securities\r\n  fraud and criminal conspiracy arising from his dealings with Thaxton Life\r\n  Partners.Â  The trial court incorporated the parties' agreement into an order\r\n  filed June 2, 2006.Â  \r\nThe parties proceeded with\r\n  discovery, exchanging and responding to interrogatories and requests to\r\n  produce.Â  In addition, the depositions of three witnesses were scheduled, but\r\n  these depositions were cancelled when the witnesses asserted their rights\r\n  against self-incrimination pursuant to the Fifth Amendment of the\r\n  United States Constitution.Â  Hensley filed a motion for summary judgment on\r\n  liability, which the court denied on March 4, 2008. Â \r\nGarrett then filed a motion\r\n  to compel arbitration on March 12, 2008.Â  In the motion, Garrett asserted he\r\n  had found two cases from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in which the court\r\n  held third parties to Thaxton Life Partners' &quot;Senior Subordinated Term\r\n  Note Subscription Agreement&quot;[2] could enforce the agreement's arbitration provision.Â  Â Â \r\nThe trial court denied the\r\n  motion.Â  It found Garrett had waived his right to compel arbitration in the\r\n  order of June 2, 2006 in which he withdrew his motion to alter or amend and\r\n  agreed to not appeal the court's decision denying arbitration.Â  In addition, the\r\n  court found Garrett had waived arbitration due to his actions in the course of\r\n  the litigation.Â  Garrett filed a motion to alter or amend, which the court\r\n  denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of whether\r\n  a party waived its right to arbitrate is a legal conclusion subject to de novo\r\n  review.Â  Rhodes v. Benson Chrysler-Plymouth, 374 S.C. 122, 125, 647\r\n  S.E.2d 249, 250 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  However, the trial court's factual findings\r\n  underlying that conclusion will not be reversed if any evidence reasonably\r\n  supporting them.Â  Id. at 125-26, 647 S.E.2d at 250-51.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGarrett argues the trial\r\n  court erred in holding he had waived arbitration.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe right to enforce an\r\n  arbitration clause may be waived.Â  Liberty Builders, Inc. v. Horton, 336\r\n  S.C. 658, 665, 521 S.E.2d 749, 753 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;There is no set rule\r\n  as to what constitutes a waiver of the right to arbitrate; the question depends\r\n  on the facts of each case.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n\r\n  Generally,\r\n    the factors our courts consider to determine if a party waived its right to\r\n    compel arbitration are:Â  (1) whether a substantial length of time transpired\r\n    between the commencement of the action and the commencement of the motion to\r\n    compel arbitration; (2) whether the party requesting arbitration engaged in\r\n    extensive discovery before moving to compel arbitration; and (3) whether the\r\n    non-moving party was prejudiced by the delay in seeking arbitration.Â  These\r\n    factors, of course, are not mutually exclusive, as one factor may be\r\n    inextricably connected to, and influenced by, the others.\r\n\r\nRhodes v. Benson Chrysler\r\n  Plymouth, 374 S.C. 122, 126, 647\r\n  S.E.2d 249, 251 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nGarrett waived arbitration by\r\n  withdrawing his motion to alter or amend the trial court's original order\r\n  denying arbitration and agreeing to not appeal the order.Â  Garrett asserts he should\r\n  not be deemed to have waived his right to arbitration because he did not\r\n  possess knowledge of all of the material facts when he entered into the\r\n  agreement as he was unaware the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals would later\r\n  find the arbitration agreement enforceable by third parties.Â  We find this\r\n  contention is without merit.Â  See Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas\r\n    Horizontal Prop. Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387-88 (1992)\r\n  (&quot;Generally, the party claiming waiver must show that the party against\r\n  whom waiver is asserted possessed, at the time, actual or constructive\r\n  knowledge of his rights or of all the material facts upon which they depended.&quot;).Â \r\n  The Fourth Circuit's opinions did not alter the material facts of the case or\r\n  the circumstances surrounding Garrett's waiver of arbitration. Â They are merely\r\n  judicial decisions contradicting the trial court's original order.Â  It was\r\n  incumbent upon Garrett to timely appeal that order and prove to the appellate\r\n  court the trial court's ruling was in error. Â Instead, Garrett agreed to forgo\r\n  his appeal and proceed with the litigation process.Â  \r\nOver two and a half years\r\n  passed between the commencement of this lawsuit and Garrett's current motion to\r\n  compel arbitration. Â Â During the course of the litigation, both parties\r\n  submitted and responded to interrogatories and requests to produce.Â  In\r\n  addition, Hensley filed two motions for summary judgment.Â  Thus, Hensley was\r\n  prejudiced by Garrett's delay in seeking arbitration due to the time and\r\n  expense incurred in engaging in discovery and preparing his motions for summary\r\n  judgment.Â  \r\nWe conclude the trial court\r\n  did not err in holding Garrett waived arbitration.Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court's order denying Garrett's motion to compel arbitration is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, THOMAS and KONDUROS,\r\n  JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Am. Bankers Ins. Group v. Long, 453 F.3d 623 (4th Cir. 2006); Kirsh v. Finova\r\n  Group, 2007 WL 4481158 (4th Cir. 2007).Â  Hensley was a party in the Kirsh case.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
