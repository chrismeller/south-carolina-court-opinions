Jenkins, Sr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2004-UP-600\r\n  Submitted November 1, 2004 â€“ Filed December 3, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      \r\n        T. Preston Reid, of Greenville, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\n        Jack D. Griffeth, of Greenville, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Shannon Knox and Larry McKinney both appeal from a family \r\n  court order finding that Knox and McKinney were not married under common law \r\n  from 1993 to 1998 and that a bifurcated evidentiary trial needed to be held \r\n  to determine if a common law marriage existed between the parties from 1998 \r\n  to 2002.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\n Knox and McKinney were romantically involved and lived together \r\n  from August 1993 to January 2002.Â  During that time, neither party maintained \r\n  a separate residence.Â  The couple lived in four different homes during the eight \r\n  years they lived together, including a home they built together in 1996.Â  McKinney \r\n  is an electrical engineer and a successful businessman who owns and is a partner \r\n  in many businesses.Â  Knox, who has a high school education, was responsible \r\n  for household duties such as cleaning and buying groceries.Â  \r\nKnox claims the couple held themselves â€œout as husband and wife to \r\n  the general public, friends and neighbors, in business relations, and in many \r\n  organizations with which [the couple was] associated.â€Â  She also claims the \r\n  couple had family memberships at gyms and private clubs, including the Greenville \r\n  Country Club.Â  Additionally, Knox asserts the couple held a joint checking account \r\n  at a local bank.Â  Further, Knox submitted copies of their water and power contract, \r\n  listing her as McKinneyâ€™s spouse.Â  However, McKinney claims that both parties \r\n  did not intend to be married and used different names throughout their relationship, \r\n  including tax returns, bank accounts, and driverâ€™s licenses.Â  McKinney also \r\n  alleges they used separate names when introducing themselves to others and in \r\n  written contracts.Â  McKinney submitted affidavits from 16 individuals who knew \r\n  the couple and stated that they did not hold themselves out to the public as \r\n  a married couple.Â Â Â  \r\nIn 1998, the couple decided to purchase a condominium in Greenville.Â  Knox \r\n  claims that McKinney told her she had to sign a â€œWaiver Agreementâ€ before they \r\n  could close on the condominium.Â  The Waiver Agreement stated that â€œalthough \r\n  [Knox and McKinney] may live together, date and see [each] other on a frequent \r\n  basis, they are not husband and wife, either legally or by common law.â€Â  The \r\n  agreement further provided that it could be â€œpresented [in court] as conclusive \r\n  and binding evidence that the parties have never been married to each other.â€Â  \r\n  Knox claims that McKinney and his attorney pressured her into signing the agreement.Â  \r\n  She further claims that she did not sign it freely or voluntarily and that she \r\n  was fraudulently induced to sign it.Â  McKinney argues that Knox consulted with \r\n  an attorney before signing the agreement.Â  The couple separated in January 2002.Â \r\nOn July 2, 2002, Knox filed a motion for temporary relief and a complaint seeking \r\n  alimony and equitable distribution of the coupleâ€™s property based on the coupleâ€™s \r\n  common law marriage.Â  On August 19, 2002, McKinney filed an answer and a motion \r\n  to dismiss on the grounds that the parties are not husband and wife, and therefore, \r\n  the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â  The motion was heard on August \r\n  29, 2002.Â  On September 9, 2002, the family court filed its order finding that \r\n  Knox and McKinney were not married under common law because of the Waiver Agreement.Â  \r\n  Thus, the court found it was without subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate \r\n  Knoxâ€™s claims and dismissed the action under Rule 12(b), SCRCP.Â  The court further \r\n  determined that any irregularity in the consummation of the Waiver Agreement \r\n  should be tested in the Court of Common Pleas.Â  \r\nOn September 16, 2002, Knox filed a motion for a new trial and/or motion to \r\n  alter or amend judgment, arguing the court erred in finding it did not have \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction and by denying Knox a full evidentiary hearing as \r\n  to the existence of a common law marriage.Â  The motion was heard on October \r\n  30, 2002.Â  On December 2, 2002, the family court filed an amended order, finding \r\n  that it did have subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to section 20-7-420(5) \r\n  of the South Carolina Code (1985).Â  The court then found that â€œwhether the intent \r\n  of the parties to remain unmarried changed after January 30, 1998 is \r\n  a question of fact to be found from evidence showing their mutual intent after \r\n  that dateâ€ (emphasis added).Â  The court granted a bifurcated evidentiary trial \r\n  â€œlimited to determine the existence/non-existence of a common law marriage between \r\n  the parties after January 30, 1998â€ (emphasis added).Â  Knox and McKinney \r\n  both now appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n    \r\nThe issue of common law marriage is a case at law.Â  \r\n  Richland Memorial Hosp. v. English, 295 S.C. 511, 513, 369 S.E.2d 395, \r\n  396 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without \r\n  a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal \r\n  unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  \r\n  Townes Assoc., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d \r\n  773, 775 (1976).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Knox argues the family court erred in finding she and McKinney were \r\n  not married under common law before the parties signed the January 30, 1998 \r\n  Waiver Agreement. \r\nSection 20-7-420(5) of the South Carolina Code (1985) grants the family court \r\n  exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine the validity of marriages.Â  â€œIn \r\n  South Carolina, a common-law marriage exists if the parties intend to enter \r\n  into a marriage contract.â€Â  Barker v. Baker, 330 S.C. 361, 367, 499 S.E.2d \r\n  503, 506 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œIt is essential to a common law marriage that there \r\n  shall be a mutual agreement between the parties to assume toward each other \r\n  the relation of husband and wife.Â  Cohabitation without such an agreement does \r\n  not constitute marriage.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 235 S.C. 542, 550, 112 \r\n  S.E.2d 647, 651 (1960).Â  â€œA valid common law marriage requires that the facts \r\n  and circumstances show an intention on the part of both parties to enter into \r\n  a marriage contract.â€Â  Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 545, 466 S.E.2d \r\n  373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The party claiming a common law marriage must prove \r\n  it by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  Yarbrough v. Yarbrough, 280 S.C. \r\n  546, 551, 314 S.E.2d 16, 18-19 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  However, direct evidence of \r\n  the partiesâ€™ intent is not often available, thus the existence of a common-law \r\n  marriage is frequently proved by circumstantial evidence.Â  Barker, 330 \r\n  S.C. at 367-368, 499 S.E.2d at 507.Â  Typically, the circumstantial evidence \r\n  relied upon to prove a common-law marriage is the amount of time a couple has \r\n  lived together and whether the couple publicly held themselves out as husband \r\n  and wife.Â  Id.Â  â€œWhile the presumption of marriage from cohabitation \r\n  and reputation is ordinarily a rebuttable presumption, the degree of proof to \r\n  overcome it is generally very high, especially where the parties have cohabitated \r\n  as husband and wife for a long time.â€Â  Owens, 320 S.C. at 546, 466 S.E.2d \r\n  at 375.Â  â€œThe presumption of marriage can be dispelled only by evidence which \r\n  is â€˜clear, distinct and satisfactory.â€™â€ Id. (quoting Jeanes v. Jeanes, \r\n  255 S.C. 161, 177 S.E.2d 537 (1970)).Â  Thus, the family court was required to \r\n  determine if Knox presented enough evidence of a common law marriage to trigger \r\n  the presumption.\r\n        \r\nIn its order, the family court concluded that Knox had failed to prove that \r\n  she and McKinney were married under common law from 1993 to 1998.Â  On appeal, \r\n  because this is an action at law, we are bound by the family courtâ€™s findings \r\n  of fact unless they are without evidence to support them.Â  The presumption of \r\n  a common law marriage is triggered by proof of cohabitation and reputation as \r\n  husband and wife.Â  Knox stated at both hearings that she needed more time for \r\n  discovery and requested an evidentiary trial.Â  By failing to hold a trial, Knox \r\n  was deprived of her right to put up her own witnesses and cross-examine the \r\n  witnesses against her. [2] Â  Thus, the court erred by not \r\n  holding an evidentiary trial to determine the coupleâ€™s marital status from 1993 \r\n  to 1998.Â  \r\nOn cross appeal, McKinney argues the family court erred in determining that \r\n  an evidentiary trial should be held to determine if the parties remained unmarried \r\n  after the January 30, 1998 Waiver Agreement. \r\n        \r\n  \r\n          Because we hold an evidentiary trial \r\n            should be held to determine whether Knox and McKinney were married \r\n            from 1993 to 1998, we affirm the family courtâ€™s determination that \r\n            an evidentiary trial should be held to establish the coupleâ€™s status \r\n            from 1998 to 2002.\r\n          AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, \r\n            AND REMANDED.\r\n          \r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n        \r\n       [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n        to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n       \r\n        [2]  Our supreme court has acknowledged that, â€œ[t]he right to confrontation, \r\n        although historically limited to criminal prosecutions, has been applied \r\n        in the civil context.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Social Servs. ex rel. \r\n        Texas v. Holden, 319 S.C. 72, 78, 459 S.E.2d 846, 849 (1995).Â  In \r\n        determining when the right to confrontation applies, our supreme court \r\n        stated, â€œWhere important decisions turn on questions of fact, due process \r\n        requires an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.â€Â  \r\n        Brown v.

Pleasant, for Appellant.\r\n        Susan Trout Kinard, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this divorce action, Husband appeals from an order of \r\n  the family court asserting the family court erred in (1) apportioning marital \r\n  debt, (2) finding certain property to be transmuted into marital property, (3) \r\n  determining child care costs for child support purposes, (4) requiring Husband \r\n  to pay a percentage of private school tuition, (5) requiring Husband to attend \r\n  anger management, (6) determining Wifeâ€™s income in previous and more recent \r\n  years, (7) determining Husbandâ€™s income, (8) ordering Husband to return an engagement \r\n  ring to Wife, (9) awarding Wife $28,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees, and (10) dismissing \r\n  Husbandâ€™s Rule to Show Cause . We affirm in part, and reverse in part and remand.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHusband and Wife were married on May 11, 1996 and have two daughters, Alex \r\n  who was four and Mimi who was fifteen months at the time of the final hearing.Â  \r\n  They separated in March, 2000, while Wife was pregnant with Mimi.Â Â  On March \r\n  15, 2000, Wife filed this action seeking, among other things, a divorce on the \r\n  ground of physical cruelty, custody, child and spousal support, possession of \r\n  the marital home, equitable division of marital assets and debts, and attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees.Â  Husband answered, denying the material allegations, and counterclaimed \r\n  seeking custody and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nFollowing an October 25, 2001 hearing in a bifurcated trial, the family court \r\n  granted Wife a divorce on the ground of one year continuous separation, and \r\n  incorporated the partiesâ€™ agreement giving Wife custody and providing a partial \r\n  agreement regarding Husbandâ€™s visitation, with the final agreement to be determined \r\n  when the hearing reconvened.Â  The Court reconvened on January 10 and 14, 2002, \r\n  and thereafter issued its order (1) requiring Husband to pay the partiesâ€™ marital \r\n  debt of $9,500 on the Providian credit card debt, (2) finding the Husbandâ€™s \r\n  condominium had been transmuted into marital property and awarding Husband possession \r\n  of the home but finding Wife was entitled to fifty percent equity in the home, \r\n  (3) finding the engagement ring non-marital and awarding Wife ownership and \r\n  possession of it, (4) further setting forth Husbandâ€™s visitation, (5) determining \r\n  retroactive child support and ongoing child support based on previous and current \r\n  incomes of the parties, (6) finding the expenses of a nanny to be reasonable \r\n  child care expenses for child support determinations, (7) ordering Husband to \r\n  pay fifty percent of the cost of private school tuition for the children, and \r\n  (8) ordering Husband to pay $28,000 toward Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has the authority to find the \r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford \r\n  v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad \r\n  scope of review does not, however, require this court to disregard the findings \r\n  of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 \r\n  S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  Neither are we required to ignore the fact that the \r\n  trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate \r\n  their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry \r\n  v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Providian Debt\r\nHusband first contends the family court erred in failing to determine the final \r\n  amount he must pay on the Providian bank card debt.Â  He contends, at the temporary \r\n  hearing, Wife represented there was a $9,500 balance owed to Providian, he was \r\n  ordered to pay $300 per month toward marital debt, and the court failed, in \r\n  the final order, to give him credit for $7,200 he had paid toward the debt.Â  \r\n  He asks this court to find the balance owed by him on the debt to be $2,300.Â  \r\n\r\nThe record shows, following a temporary hearing on April 12, 2000, Husband \r\n  was ordered to pay $300 toward debts listed on Wifeâ€™s financial declaration.Â  \r\n  This amount apparently was not limited to just the Providian debt, and the order \r\n  did not specifically mention a Providian debt.Â  Other than Wifeâ€™s January 2002 \r\n  financial declaration submitted at the final hearing, the only other evidence \r\n  showing the Providian debt is an unsigned, undated financial declaration of \r\n  the Wife during the time of her previous employment, which indicates a Providian \r\n  debt balance of $9,500.Â  Because this document is not signed or dated, it is \r\n  impossible to determine whether the Providian debt was $9,500 at the time of \r\n  the temporary hearing.Â  At any rate, this document shows debt from at least \r\n  four other major credit cards with a total balance of $35,900, not including \r\n  the Providian balance.Â  By the time of the final hearing, Wifeâ€™s financial declaration \r\n  showed a Providian debt balance of $9,500, but listed only two other major credit \r\n  card debts totaling a little over $17,000.Â  Wife testified at the final hearing \r\n  that the only marital credit card debt left was the Providian debt.Â  Thus, even \r\n  if we were to consider this unsigned, undated document as evidence, it shows \r\n  Wife paid down a substantial portion of the credit card debt.Â  Because none \r\n  of the proceedings from the temporary hearing are included within the record, \r\n  it is impossible to determine which of these various debts were purported to \r\n  be marital at the time of the temporary hearing.Â  See Wint v. Wint, \r\n  310 S.C. 48, 50, 425 S.E.2d 48, 50 (Ct. App. 1992) (the burden is on the appellant \r\n  to furnish a sufficient record on appeal from which this court can make an intelligent \r\n  review).Â  In the final order, the family court held it was uncontroverted that \r\n  the Providian debt of $9,500 was marital and Wife had been maintaining that \r\n  debt, â€œtogether with the $300 contribution from [Husband]â€ ordered after the \r\n  temporary hearing.Â  Given the record before us, based on our review of the totality \r\n  of the facts, we find a preponderance of the evidence supports the family courtâ€™s \r\n  determination that Husband should be responsible for the remaining debt owed \r\n  on the Providian card.\r\nII. Transmutation of the Condominium\r\nHusband next contends the family court erred in finding his condominium had \r\n  been transmuted into marital property because Wife only sought a â€œspecial equityâ€ \r\n  in the property, and therefore the family court should not have granted Wife \r\n  relief pursuant to the doctrine of transmutation.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nDuring Wifeâ€™s examination of Husband at trial, Husband testified he bought \r\n  the condominium in 1984 and he had made every mortgage payment on it except \r\n  for one that Wife made from money he had given her.Â  Counsel for Husband sought \r\n  clarification during this line of questioning stating: \r\n\r\n  It has always been their position that the condo is non-marital and they \r\n    were not wanting to try to show transmutation.Â  They may be just showing this \r\n    for a different purpose, but I want to be clear because it will affect my \r\n    questions.Â  And I donâ€™t know if they have reversed that position now or not.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nWifeâ€™s counsel responded as follows: \r\n\r\n  Weâ€™re not interested in possession.Â  We have always put forth a claim as \r\n    a special equity in the condo for the wifeâ€™s contribution.Â  There has been \r\n    a lot of discovery going back and forth about proof of contribution during \r\n    the marriage.Â  And there would be no other reason for those questions and \r\n    the resulting responses unless thatâ€™s what we were doing.Â  And the pleadings \r\n    - -\r\n\r\nAt this point, the court cut counsel off and this line of questioning continued.Â  \r\n  Later on during the hearing, when objecting to the relevance of certain questions \r\n  by Husbandâ€™s attorney, Wifeâ€™s attorney stated, â€œWe are seeking a share of the \r\n  marital home.â€Â  \r\nThereafter, Wife testified that for two years of the marriage, Husband made \r\n  little to no income while he was starting up a new business.Â  During this time, \r\n  Husband had no other source of income.Â  Wife testified she made at least three \r\n  payments herself to the mortgage company during this time.Â  She also stated \r\n  that Husband managed to pay the mortgage and other bills from money Wife gave \r\n  to him.Â  Wife claimed she used her pre-marital â€œnest eggâ€ money of $45,000 and \r\n  incurred $40,000 in debt to pay the bills during this time.Â  She further testified \r\n  she believed she had â€œearned an interest in that condominiumâ€ and she was â€œentitled \r\n  to share in this home [because she] supported [Husband] during the marriage.â€Â  \r\n  The partiesâ€™ tax returns showed Husband earned business income of $4,934 in \r\n  1997 and sustained a net loss of $8,883 in 1998.Â  \r\nHusband cites Calhoun v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. 96, 529 S.E.2d 14 (2000) \r\n  in support of his argument that the family court should not have awarded Wife \r\n  relief pursuant to the doctrine of transmutation.Â  Husband quotes as follows \r\n  from Calhoun:Â  â€œSince the relief sought by petitioner was that of a special \r\n  equity, neither the family court nor the Court of Appeals erred in refusing \r\n  to grant her relief pursuant to the doctrine of transmutation.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 107, 529 S.E.2d at 20.Â  However, in Calhoun, the court found that \r\n  petitioner limited the issue on appeal by the relief she sought when she only \r\n  asked that the market appreciation of the home be included in the marital estate.Â  \r\n  The court held â€œ[a] family court cannot award relief beyond the scope of the \r\n  pleadings.â€Â  Id. at 107, 529 S.E.2d at 20.Â  Because the petitioner in \r\n  Calhoun had only sought a special equity, the family court properly declined \r\n  to afford her relief pursuant to the doctrine of transmutation.\r\nAlthough Wifeâ€™s counsel did state Wife was seeking a â€œspecial equityâ€ in the \r\n  condominium, she also indicated her client was seeking â€œa share of the marital \r\n  home.â€Â  Further, Wife originally sought possession of the â€œmarital homeâ€ in \r\n  her complaint, as well as equitable distribution of marital assets.Â  At the \r\n  time Wifeâ€™s counsel used the term â€œspecial equity,â€ counsel specifically clarified \r\n  that they were no longer seeking possession of the home, and began to \r\n  argue Wifeâ€™s allegations in her pleadings, but was cut off by the court.Â  We \r\n  decline to find an inadvertent misstatement by Wifeâ€™s attorney should preclude \r\n  Wife from pursuing the relief properly requested in her pleadings.\r\nIII.Â  Child Care Costs\r\nHusband next argues the family court erred in allowing $330 per week for child \r\n  care costs because the actual cost was only $300, a portion of the cost was \r\n  attributable to house cleaning, and the evidence showed reasonable day care \r\n  costs were between $173 and $228 per week.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe record shows that both of the partiesâ€™ children suffer from rather severe \r\n  asthma and allergy problems.Â  Husband admitted that when Alex was young, it \r\n  was not recommended that she attend day care because â€œher allergies were so \r\n  bad.â€Â  Wife testified she had a nanny to watch the children and that she did \r\n  not enroll the girls in day care because of their health conditions.Â  Wife stated \r\n  she paid the nanny $300 a week plus $30 for gasoline expenses for a total of \r\n  $330 a week.Â  Husband agreed to employment of the nanny, but merely objected \r\n  to Wife getting full credit for the amount paid to the nanny because he believed \r\n  the nanny also cleaned the house.Â  Wife admitted the nanny did clean on occasion, \r\n  but testified Wife did most of the cleaning, the vacuuming performed by the \r\n  nanny was necessary for two asthmatic children, and because the nanny had one \r\n  or both children with her the entire day, there was little time for her to clean.Â  \r\n  Child support awards are addressed to the sound discretion of the family court \r\n  and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Patel \r\n  v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 531, 599 S.E.2d 114, 122 (2004).Â  The child care \r\n  arrangement is the same as it was before the parties separated, and it contemplates \r\n  the special health needs of the children.Â  Based on the record before us, we \r\n  find a preponderance of the evidence supports the family courtâ€™s determination \r\n  on this issue.\r\nIV.Â  Private School TuitionÂ Â Â  \r\nHusband next asserts the family court erred in requiring him to pay fifty percent \r\n  of the cost of private school tuition for the children.Â  He argues Wife failed \r\n  to specifically request this relief.Â  He further asserts there was no agreement \r\n  by the parties to send the children to private school and there were no special \r\n  circumstances warranting the cost of private school.Â  We agree.Â Â  \r\nThe only evidence of record concerning private school for the children is that, \r\n  at the time of trial, Alex was enrolled in First Scotts Kindergarten K-4 program.Â  \r\n  Wife testified she believed the tuition for the school is $2,400 a year.Â  She \r\n  further stated Alex was attending First Scotts at the time the parties separated \r\n  and she intended to send Mimi there as well.Â  Despite the fact that no mention \r\n  was made of Husband sharing in these costs, the family court ordered Husband \r\n  to be responsible for fifty percent of the cost of private school tuition for \r\n  the children, finding â€œ[t]he parties had established a course of conduct during \r\n  their marriage of having [Alex] enrolled in private kindergarten. . . . â€Â  \r\nIt is clear Wife never requested Husband be required to contribute to private \r\n  school tuition in her complaint.Â  Neither is there any indication that the issue \r\n  of her entitlement to a contribution for private school tuition was raised at \r\n  the hearing such that the issue was tried by consent.Â  See Shirley \r\n  v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 340-341, 536 S.E.2d 427, 435 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting \r\n  when issues not raised in the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent, \r\n  they will be treated as if they had been raised in the pleadings).Â  Husband \r\n  was not, as Wife asserts, placed on notice Wife was seeking private school costs \r\n  for the children merely because Husband knew Alex was attending a private pre-school \r\n  program.Â  â€œDue process requires that a litigant be placed on notice of the issues \r\n  which the court is to consider and the rule that family court pleadings are \r\n  to be liberally construed may not be stretched so as to permit the judge to \r\n  award relief not contemplated by the pleadings.â€Â  Abbott v. Gore, 304 \r\n  S.C. 116, 119, 403 S.E.2d 154, 156 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Accordingly, we find the \r\n  family court erred in ordering Husband to contribute to the childrenâ€™s private \r\n  school tuition.\r\nV.Â  Anger Management\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in ruling he was required to attend anger \r\n  management because there is insufficient evidence to show he has a problem with \r\n  anger.Â  We disagree.\r\nWife initiated this action seeking a divorce on the grounds of physical cruelty.Â  \r\n  At the commencement of the hearing, Wife moved to amend her complaint to seek \r\n  a divorce on the ground of one-year continuous separation and the motion was \r\n  granted without objection.Â  However, Wife still testified to incidences where \r\n  Husband became verbally and physically abusive with her, at times in front of \r\n  their daughter.Â  Wife also admitted she had thrown drinks and soup at Husband \r\n  and had thrown some of Husbandâ€™s artwork off the balcony.Â  The guardian ad litem \r\n  testified to an incident she witnessed when she escorted Wife to retrieve some \r\n  personal property from the marital home and Husbandâ€™s anger escalated during \r\n  the visit.Â  After the incident, the guardian indicated to Wifeâ€™s attorney she \r\n  believed Husband needed anger management counseling.Â  The guardian testified, \r\n  while she thought Husband was a nice person, he directed anger at Wife, and \r\n  she believed Husband needed anger management to deal with it.Â  The family court \r\n  ordered both Husband and Wife to enroll in anger management courses.Â  Based \r\n  on the facts before us, we defer to the family court judge who saw and heard \r\n  the witnesses, and we find a preponderance of the evidence supports the courtâ€™s \r\n  determination that Husband should attend an anger management course.\r\nVI. Â Wifeâ€™s Income\r\nHusband next asserts error in the family courtâ€™s determination of Wifeâ€™s income \r\n  for purposes of determining retroactive and ongoing child support.Â  Specifically, \r\n  he contends the court found Wifeâ€™s gross monthly income in 2000 to be $2,947 \r\n  when it was really $4,895 and further found her current gross monthly income \r\n  to be $3,410 when she actually earns gross monthly income of $6,712.Â  We disagree.\r\nWife testified she earned gross income of $35,366 in 2000.Â  While she had reported \r\n  a higher gross monthly figure on her financial declaration for the April 2000 \r\n  temporary hearing, Wife testified she had not earned as much during the rest \r\n  of the year because she had gone on bed rest with her pregnancy, making much \r\n  less money during that year.Â  She further took a distribution from her IRA that \r\n  year in order to purchase her home, making her income appear higher.Â  Her 2000 \r\n  tax return shows Wife earned wages of $35,366 and took an $18,500 distribution \r\n  from her IRA in the year 2000.Â  We find no error in the courtâ€™s finding on Wifeâ€™s \r\n  gross monthly income for the year 2000.Â  \r\nAs to the current income figure, Wifeâ€™s financial declaration at the final \r\n  hearing showed she was earning $1,594 in salary, received income of $1,116 in \r\n  the form of a forgivable loan, and earned $700 from other sources per month.Â  \r\n  Wife testified she was receiving average commissions of $1,594 a month, received \r\n  a forgivable loan from her new employment accounting for $1,116 per month, and \r\n  received $700 a month in property management fees. Â Thus, the evidence supports \r\n  the courtâ€™s finding that Wife had a gross monthly income of $3,410 at the time \r\n  of the final hearing.Â  Further, Husband fails to show any basis for his assertion \r\n  Wife earned $4,895 a month in addition to the property management income and \r\n  forgivable loan.Â  \r\nVII.Â  Husbandâ€™s Income\r\nHusband next asserts \r\n  the family court erred in determining his income from self-employment, arguing \r\n  the court overstated gross receipts and failed to deduct a sufficient amount \r\n  for ordinary and necessary business expenses.Â  We find the evidence insufficient \r\n  to support the courtâ€™s determination on the gross receipts of the business, \r\n  but find sufficient evidence on the issue of expenses.\r\nSouth Carolina Regulation 114-4720, governing the determination \r\n  of child support, provides in pertinent part as follows:\r\n \r\n  (1) Definition.Â  The guidelines define income as the actual gross income \r\n    of the parent, if employed to full capacity, or potential income if unemployed \r\n    or underemployed. . . .\r\n  (2) Gross Income.Â  Gross income includes income from any source including \r\n    salaries, wages, commissions, royalties, bonuses, rents (less allowable business \r\n    expenses), dividends, severance pay, pensions, interest, trust income, annuities, \r\n    capital gains, social security benefits (but not Supplemental Security Income), \r\n    workersâ€™ compensation benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, disability \r\n    insurance benefits, Veterans benefits and alimony, including alimony received \r\n    as a result of another marriage and alimony which a party receives as a result \r\n    of the current litigation.Â  Unreported case income should also be included \r\n    if it can be identified.\r\n  *Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  *Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  *\r\n  (4) Income From Self-Employment or Operation of a Business.Â  For income from \r\n    self-employment, proprietorship of a business, or ownership of a partnership \r\n    or closely held corporation, gross income is defined as gross receipts minus \r\n    ordinary and necessary expenses required for self-employment or business operation, \r\n    including employerâ€™s share of FICA.Â  However, the court should exclude from \r\n    those expenses amounts allowed by the Internal Revenue Service for accelerated \r\n    depreciation or investment tax credits for purposes of the guidelines and \r\n    add those amounts back in to determine gross income.Â  In general, the court \r\n    should carefully review income and expenses from self-employment or operation \r\n    of a business to determine actual levels of gross income available to the \r\n    parent to satisfy a child support obligation.Â  As may be apparent, this \r\n    amount may differ from a determination of business income for tax purposes.\r\n\r\nS.C. Reg. 114-4720(A) (emphasis added).\r\nThe family court order found Husband earned total commissions of $161,142 in \r\n  2000 and $153,506 in 2001.Â  Husbandâ€™s accounting expert testified Husband earned \r\n  gross income of $64,933 in the year 2000 and $68,243 for the year \r\n  2001.Â  She determined these figures based on the companyâ€™s general ledgers, \r\n  bank statements, and credit card statements.Â  Husband testified, and the business \r\n  tax return shows, Husbandâ€™s company had gross receipts of $133,969 in 2000.Â  \r\n  Wife, on the other hand, testified she suspected Husband was underestimating \r\n  his income and that he had, in the past, failed to report all of his income \r\n  on his tax return.Â  Further, Husband admitted that at one time, when he was \r\n  employed to handle the personal affairs of an elderly woman, he failed to report \r\n  all of that income on his income tax return.Â  While Wife contends she put into \r\n  evidence Plaintiffâ€™s Exhibit # 22, Husbandâ€™s business bank statements through \r\n  the end of 2001 which purportedly show gross receipts â€œfor each of those years,â€ \r\n  the record does not show this specific exhibit is included.Â  Further, the record \r\n  does contain statements from the various business bank accounts, however, these \r\n  statements are so disorganized and voluminous that it is impossible to determine \r\n  whether there is any support for the family courtâ€™s finding on gross receipts \r\n  of the company.Â  While Wife may very well have provided evidence in support \r\n  of the figures used by the family court, this court is unable to verify the \r\n  figures through the record before us.Â  The family court was required to determine \r\n  gross receipts pursuant to S.C. Reg. 114-4720(A)(4).Â  Given the record before \r\n  us, we find it necessary to remand this issue to the family court for redetermination \r\n  of the value of Husbandâ€™s gross receipts during the pertinent years.Â  If needed, \r\n  the family court may take additional testimony on the matter.Â  See Widman \r\n  v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 116, 557 S.E.2d 693, 703 (Ct. App. 2001) (wherein \r\n  this court remanded to the family court for a determination of the value of \r\n  a share of stock where evidence in the record was insufficient to enable appellate \r\n  court to make a determination, and allowed taking of additional testimony by \r\n  the family court to resolve the issue).\r\nAs to the deductible business expenses, the record supports the family courtâ€™s \r\n  finding that Husband pays many of his personal living expenses out of his business \r\n  account and that he is not entitled to some of the expenses he claims.Â  The \r\n  record shows Wife successfully challenged many of these expenses.Â  Further, \r\n  we agree with the family court that Husband failed to produce credible evidence \r\n  on the commingled expenses, and we find he specifically failed to demonstrate \r\n  the evidence of record to support the expenses he now contends were wrongly \r\n  excluded.Â  Accordingly, we find the court properly excluded certain expenses \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Reg. 114-4720(A)(4).\r\nVIII.Â  Engagement Ring\r\nHusband next contends the family court erred in ordering him to transfer the \r\n  engagement ring in his possession to Wife because it was non-marital property.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nAt trial, Husband testified he gave the ring to Wife as an engagement ring.Â  \r\n  He claimed he came into possession of the ring when Wife â€œtook the ring off \r\n  and said â€˜you can have the ring.â€™â€Â  Wife adamantly denied giving the ring to \r\n  Husband.Â  She stated that, after their separation, she and Husband were arguing \r\n  over money and how much he had paid for the ring.Â  She took the ring off her \r\n  finger and asked Husband if that was all he cared about, at which point he took \r\n  the ring, smiled, and walked out the door.Â  \r\nThe family court found the ring was given to Wife prior to the marriage, it \r\n  was non-marital property, and Wife was to have permanent possession and ownership \r\n  of the ring.Â  Husband asserts this was error, contending the family court did \r\n  not have jurisdiction to apportion the non-marital property.Â  â€œAn antenuptial \r\n  gift of an engagement ring is the recipientâ€™s separate property.â€Â  Frank \r\n  v. Frank, 311 S.C. 454, 457, 429 S.E.2d 823, 825 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Husband \r\n  is correct in his assertion that the family court does not have jurisdiction \r\n  to apportion non-marital property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  However, family courts have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine actions \r\n  for â€œdivorce . . . and for settlement of all legal and equitable rights of the \r\n  parties in the actions in and to the real and personal property of the marriage \r\n  . . . .â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(2) (Supp. 2003).Â  Thus, the family court \r\n  clearly has jurisdiction to determine what is and is not marital.Â  Here, the \r\n  court did not â€œapportionâ€ the non-marital property, but merely determined it \r\n  was in fact non-marital and belonged to Wife. \r\n  [1] Â  Accordingly, we hold the family court properly determined Wife was \r\n  entitled to possession and ownership of the ring.Â  \r\nIX.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nHusband contends the family court erred in awarding Wife $28,000 in attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees because (1) the court improperly found much of Wifeâ€™s fees were caused \r\n  by Husbandâ€™s frivolous claim for custody, (2) the fees included $3,600 from \r\n  services of an unnecessary second attorney and, (3) the court improperly awarded \r\n  fees in part based on Husbandâ€™s purported obstructive behavior in refusing to \r\n  allow Wife to retrieve some of her personal effects.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court found Wife had incurred attorneyâ€™s fees and cost of $41,513 \r\n  and Husband should contribute $28,000 toward the fees and costs.Â  The record \r\n  before us is replete with evidence supporting the family courtâ€™s determination \r\n  that Husbandâ€™s claim to custody was frivolous in that he maintained the claim \r\n  for other purposes than obtaining custody of his children.Â  The preponderance \r\n  of evidence also supports the courtâ€™s finding that Husband was obstructive in \r\n  that he refused to allow Wife to retrieve items that were clearly non-marital.Â  \r\n\r\nAs to Husbandâ€™s assertion regarding a second attorney, the record shows Wifeâ€™s \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees affidavit was admitted into evidence without objection.Â  The \r\n  record fails to demonstrate Husband ever challenged the use of two attorneys \r\n  or raised any objection to the fees during the hearing on his motion to reconsider.Â  \r\n  Further, Husband failed to raise any issue concerning attorneyâ€™s fees in his \r\n  motion for reconsideration.Â  As a general rule, an issue may not be raised for \r\n  the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the \r\n  court below to be preserved for appellate review.Â  See Noisette v. \r\n  Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding an issue not \r\n  preserved where the trial court did not explicitly rule on an argument and the \r\n  appellant failed to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the judgment \r\n  on that ground).Â  Because the family court did not have an opportunity to rule \r\n  on this issue, it is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nWe find no error in the award of attorneyâ€™s fees based on Husbandâ€™s arguments \r\n  and therefore affirm the award of these fees to Wife. [2] Â  \r\nX.Â  Dismissal of Husbandâ€™s Rule to Show CauseÂ Â  \r\nHusband finally asserts the family court erred in denying his rule to show \r\n  cause.Â  He contends the evidence introduced at the hearing on the matter showed \r\n  Wife willfully failed to comply with the courtâ€™s order on visitation.Â  We disagree.\r\nFollowing issuance of the final order, Husband sought to have Wife held in \r\n  contempt based on her failure to comply with the courtâ€™s order on visitation.Â  \r\n  The family court dismissed the rule to show cause, finding, due to confusion \r\n  over the court ordered visitation, Wife initially failed to allow some of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  weekday visitations on Tuesday and Thursday during the summer months.Â  However, \r\n  Wife thereafter offered substitute visitation to make up for the missed days, \r\n  and specifically offered Tuesday and Thursday visitation, but Husband refused, \r\n  indicating he would rather take the matter to the court to have Wife held in \r\n  contempt.Â  \r\nâ€œContempt results from the willful disobedience of a court order, and before \r\n  a court may find a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically \r\n  reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€Â  Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, \r\n  557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œA willful act is one which is â€˜done voluntarily \r\n  and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, \r\n  or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; \r\n  that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Id. (citation omitted).Â  A determination of contempt is within the sound \r\n  discretion of the trial judge whose decision will not be disturbed unless the \r\n  judgeâ€™s finding is without evidentiary support or there is an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\n  Id. at 120, 557 S.E.2d at 705.\r\nThe record shows there was much confusion over the visitation issue.Â  There \r\n  was only a partial agreement in the first part of the bifurcated trial.Â  Wife \r\n  testified she did not realize she was in violation of the order, and she thought \r\n  the order provided no extended visitation over the summer months.Â  She further \r\n  stated she tried to comply, offering Husband additional time with the children, \r\n  but Husband refused stating he wished to settle the matter in court.Â  Even Husband \r\n  admitted the final order did not encompass what he thought it was supposed to \r\n  reflect on visitation.Â Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion.\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order below is\r\nARRIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.Â Â  \r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] Apportion means â€œ[t]o divide and distribute proportionally.â€ \r\n  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 99 (6th ed.1990).Â Â Â  \r\n [2] Husband does not challenge the attorneyâ€™s fee award on any other \r\n  basis.Â  Specifically, he does not argue against the award based on the appropriate \r\n  factors.Â  See Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  313, 315 (1991) (wherein court held, in determining the amount of attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees to award, the court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty \r\n  of the case, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counselâ€™s professional \r\n  standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, \r\n  and the customary legal fees for similar services).Â  Nor did he request this \r\n  court reverse and remand the issue based on our reversal of any other issues.Â  \r\n  See Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 427 S.E.2d 665 (1993) (reversing \r\n  and remanding issue of attorneyâ€™s fees for reconsideration where husband argued \r\n  the substantive results achieved by trial counsel were reversed on appeal).Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the award is affirmed based solely on the arguments submitted by \r\n  Husband.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-606","title":"Walker Investment Management Trust v.

Lang, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Michael F. Mullinax, of Anderson, and Roxy Rae Beagley, of Clemson, \r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Carolina First Bank appeals the trial judgeâ€™s decision that \r\n  the Walker Investment Management Trustâ€™s interest in the subject property was \r\n  superior to the interest of Carolina First Bank.Â  We affirm.  \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nDavid and Donna Walker owned 30.79 acres located at the intersection of Lebanon \r\n  Road and Liberty Highway in Anderson County, South Carolina.Â  In September 1999, \r\n  the Walkers created the Walker Investment Management Trust (Trust), naming their \r\n  daughters as the trustees.Â  In October of that same year, the Trust entered \r\n  into a contract of sale with B&amp;B Development (B&amp;B), headed by Joe Blasco \r\n  and Dan Balcer, who intended to build an apartment complex on the property.Â  \r\n  The contract provided that the Trust would convey the property to B&amp;B in \r\n  exchange for five 3-bedroom units and four 2-bedroom units, which would be deeded \r\n  to the Trust upon fifty percent completion of construction.Â  The contract also \r\n  stipulated that B&amp;B would obtain a surety bond in the amount of $765,000 \r\n  (the value of the transaction) as consideration for the contract sometime â€œon \r\n  or before . . . the infrastructure [was] started.â€Â  B&amp;B never obtained the \r\n  surety bond or started building infrastructure.Â  Furthermore, though the deed \r\n  stated that the Trust conveyed the property for $107,765, the Trust never received \r\n  these funds.Â  \r\nThe documents were properly recorded in the Anderson County RMC Office on October \r\n  15, 1999 in the following order: the Trust, the contract, the deed to the trust, \r\n  and the deed to B&amp;B.Â  \r\nIn January 2000, B&amp;B obtained a mortgage on the property for $205,000 through \r\n  Carolina First to buy out Balcerâ€™s interest in the company.Â  The closing attorney \r\n  in this real estate transaction, Michael Spivy, was the same attorney who had \r\n  handled the closing between the Trust and B&amp;B only months before.Â  B&amp;B \r\n  also obtained two wrap-around mortgages on the property, as well as other property \r\n  owned by B&amp;B, from GrandSouth Bank in the amounts of $791,087.84 and $101,251.33.Â  \r\n\r\nGrandSouth began foreclosure proceedings against the property in controversy, \r\n  citing B&amp;B, Blasco Builders, and Carolina First as defendants.Â  Shortly \r\n  thereafter, the Trust intervened by consent order, requesting a declaratory \r\n  judgment as to its rights to the subject property.Â  Following consolidation \r\n  of the suits, B&amp;B and Blasco Builders defaulted, and GrandSouth moved for \r\n  a voluntary dismissal, which was granted by the trial judge.Â  The trial judge \r\n  declared the deed from the Trust to B&amp;B as null and void and set it aside \r\n  in its entirety.Â  The court also restored fee simple title to the property in \r\n  the Trust and declared the Carolina First mortgage as null and void, extinguishing \r\n  the lien relating thereto in full.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor \r\n  equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying action.Â  An issue, \r\n  essentially one at law, will not be transformed into one in equity simply because \r\n  declaratory relief is sought.Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, \r\n  356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  Here, the action was one to construe the real \r\n  estate contract and, therefore, at law.Â  In law actions, the trial court must \r\n  be affirmed when there is any evidence to support its findings.Â  Townes Assoc., \r\n  Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). \r\n\r\nHowever, the relief sought by the Trust for the breach of contract cause of \r\n  action is equitable, as are the other three causes of action.Â  See Brown \r\n  v. Greenwood School Dist. 50 Bd. of Trustees, 344 S.C. 522, 525, 544 S.E.2d \r\n  642, 643 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding that an action to rescind a contract is in \r\n  equity); Bullard v. Crawley, 294 S.C. 276, 278, 363 S.E.2d 897, 898 (1987) \r\n  (â€œAn action to set aside deeds is a matter in equity.â€); Bank of Williston \r\n  v. Alderman, et al., 106 S.C. 386, 391, 91 S.E. 296, 297 (1917) (stating \r\n  that constructive trusts are created when one party obtains money that does \r\n  not equitably belong to him).Â  On appeal of an equitable action, the appellate \r\n  court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of \r\n  the evidence.Â  Townes Assoc., Ltd., 266 S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 775.Â  \r\n  This broad scope of review does not require the appellate court to disregard \r\n  the findings of the trial judge nor does it relieve appellant of the burden \r\n  of convincing the court that the trial judge erred.Â  The trial judge, who saw \r\n  and heard the witnesses, is better able to evaluate their credibility.Â  Calcutt \r\n  v. Calcutt, 282 S.C. 565, 569, 320 S.E.2d 55, 57 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  However, \r\n  the appellate court is not bound by the trial judgeâ€™s legal determinations.Â  \r\n  Swindler v. Swindler, 355 S.C. 245, 249, 584 S.E.2d 438, 440 (Ct. App. \r\n  2003).Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Notice\r\nCarolina First claims that it did not have notice of the Trustâ€™s claim to the \r\n  property because the wording of the contract only provided the Trust a personal \r\n  remedy against B&amp;B or on the surety bond in case of a default.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe contract provides\r\n \r\n  The Seller agrees to convey to the Purchaser 30.79 acres . . . .Â  In consideration \r\n    of the conveyance of said 30.79 acres, the Purchaser agrees to secure a $765,000 \r\n    Surety Bond to secure Sellerâ€™s interest in the property which will be conveyed \r\n    to B&amp;B Development, LLC.Â  Upon 50% completion of said project, B&amp;B \r\n    Development, LLC, agrees to deed to Seller for $1.00 and other consideration, \r\n    5 (five) 3 bedroom units and 4 (four) 2 bedroom units.Â  Once said units are \r\n    deeded then the surety bond is terminated . . . .Â  The Surety Bond is to be \r\n    in place on or before the time that the infrastructure is started. \r\n  . . . .\r\n  If Purchaser fails to complete its obligation under this said contract then \r\n    the Surety Bond would cover any loss to Seller.Â  The Purchaser would keep \r\n    ownership of said land . . .Â  \r\n\r\nThe contract required B&amp;B to purchase a surety bond to protect \r\n  the interests of the Trust.Â  The contract was then properly recorded, putting \r\n  all subsequent creditors on notice of the Trustâ€™s equitable interest.Â  â€œOrdinarily, \r\n  one who takes a security interest in real property with notice of an existing \r\n  third party equity in the property takes subject to the third partyâ€™s interest. \r\n  . . . It is sufficient that one either knows or ought to know some third \r\n  party interest exists.â€Â  South Carolina Fed. Savings Bank v. San-A-Bel Corp., \r\n  307 S.C. 76, 79, 413 S.E.2d 852, 854 (Ct. App. 1992) (emphasis added).Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-7-10 (Supp. 2003).Â  The inclusion of the surety bond requirement \r\n  in the contract alone should have put anyone on notice. Carolina First used \r\n  the same attorney to close their mortgage as B&amp;B and the Trust used to close \r\n  their real estate agreement.Â  Notice to an attorney is notice to the client.Â  \r\n  See Faulkner v. Millar, 319 S.C. 216, 221, 460 S.E.2d 378, 381 \r\n  (1995) (discussing principles of agency).Â  Spivey drafted the contract of sale \r\n  between the Trust and B&amp;B and conducted the closing.Â  He was as familiar \r\n  with the provisions of that contract as the parties were.Â  Balcerâ€™s testimony \r\n  unequivocally states that his understanding of the contract is that â€œthe property \r\n  would be returned back to Mr. Walker . . . if [B&amp;B] did not complete these \r\n  unitsâ€ and purchase the surety bond to protect him.Â  Shortly thereafter, Spivey \r\n  represented to Carolina First that the property was unencumbered.Â  \r\nCarolina First had notice or should have had notice of the Trustâ€™s \r\n  interest in the property.Â  Therefore, its mortgage is subordinate to the rights \r\n  and title in the Trust.\r\nII. Rescission and Setting Aside the Deed\r\nCarolina First claims the trial judge erred in rescinding and setting aside \r\n  the contract because this relief prejudiced the rights of an innocent third \r\n  party, Carolina First.Â  We disagree.\r\nA valid contract consists of contractual intent, followed by an actual meeting \r\n  of the minds of the parties, accompanied by valid consideration.Â  Cobb v. \r\n  Gross, 291 S.C. 550, 553, 354 S.E.2d 573, 575 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Furthermore, \r\n  consideration must be legally sufficient.Â Â Â  The general rule is that for a \r\n  breach of contract to warrant rescission, the breach must be so fundamental \r\n  and substantial as to defeat the purpose of the contract.Â  Gibbs v. G.K.H., \r\n  Inc., 311 S.C. 103, 105, 427 S.E.2d 701, 702 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  In addition, \r\n  to cancel a deed the moving party must show total failure of consideration or \r\n  grossly inadequate consideration.Â  Patterson v. Goldsmith, 292 S.C. 619, \r\n  628, 358 S.E.2d 163, 168 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  In this case, there was a substantial \r\n  breach of the contract because no consideration was ever paid.Â  B&amp;B never \r\n  obtained the surety bond, nor built or conveyed the development units as required \r\n  by the contract.Â  \r\nMost importantly, the acts of an attorney are directly attributable to and \r\n  binding on the client.Â  Greenville Income Partners v. Holman, 308 S.C. \r\n  105, 107, 417 S.E.2d 107, 108 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  No mistake attributable to an \r\n  attorney can be successfully used as a ground for relief, unless it would have \r\n  been excusable if attributable to the client.Â  Simon v. Flowers, 231 \r\n  S.C. 545, 551, 99 S.E.2d 391, 394 (1957).Â  As discussed above, Spivey represented \r\n  Carolina First, just as he had represented B&amp;B in the deed from the Trust.Â  \r\n  He examined B&amp;Bâ€™s title and he closed the loan.Â  Spivey knew of B&amp;Bâ€™s \r\n  agreement with the Trust, that counsel did not represent Walker at the initial \r\n  closing, and that Walker was concerned about protecting his interest.Â  In addition, \r\n  he knew B&amp;B was responsible for purchasing the surety bond and that it failed \r\n  to do so.Â  Yet, he recommended Blasco proceed with the loan and represented \r\n  to Carolina First that its mortgage would have priority.Â  Unfortunately, Carolina \r\n  First is bound by his mistake.Â  Greenville Income Partners, 308 S.C. \r\n  at 107-08, 417 S.E.2d at 108.Â  Therefore, the trial judge had sufficient evidence \r\n  before him to rescind the contract and set aside the deed. \r\nIII. Constructive Trust\r\nCarolina First claims the trial judge erred in finding a constructive trust \r\n  had been created because there was no evidence of fraud, bad faith, abuse of \r\n  confidence, or a violation of a fiduciary duty, which would give rise to an \r\n  obligation in equity to make restitution.Â  We disagree.\r\nA constructive trust arises whenever one party has obtained money, which does \r\n  not equitably belong to him, and which he cannot in good conscience retain or \r\n  withhold from another, who is beneficially entitled to it.Â  Lollis v. Lollis, \r\n  291 S.C. 525, 529, 354 S.E.2d 559, 561 (1987) (citing Bank of Williston v. \r\n  Alderman, 106 S.C. 386, 391, 91 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1917)).Â  Constructive trusts \r\n  do not arise by agreement or from intention, but by operation of law with actual \r\n  or constructive fraud as their essential element.Â  Id.Â  â€œActual fraud \r\n  is not necessary, but such trust will arise whenever the circumstances under \r\n  which property was acquired make it inequitable that it should be retained by \r\n  him who holds legal title.â€Â  Bank of Williston, 106 S.C. at 391, 91 S.E.2d \r\n  at 298.Â  The trial judge in Doe v. Roe, 323 S.C. 445, 452, 475 S.E.2d \r\n  783, 786-87 (Ct. App. 1996), found that duress, abuse of confidence, commission \r\n  of a wrong, and â€œany form of unconscionable conduct, artifice, concealment, \r\n  or questionable meansâ€ can create a constructive trust as well (emphasis added).Â  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, â€œthe trust arises and follows the property of its proceeds.â€Â  \r\n  Bank of Williston, 106 S.C. at 391, 91 S.E.2d at 298.Â  B&amp;B acted \r\n  unconscionably by not purchasing the surety bond, failing to convey the buildings \r\n  or pay their worth as consideration for the contract.Â  This conduct created \r\n  a trust, which follows the property in the lien to Carolina First.Â  Lastly, \r\n  the trial judge had sufficient evidence of unconscionable conduct on the part \r\n  of the attorney who represented both B&amp;B and Carolina First.Â  In fact, before \r\n  the lien agreement with Carolina First, Blasco reminded Spivey that there was \r\n  no bond to protect Walker.Â  Blasco felt that Walker would be taken advantage \r\n  of by the contractâ€™s wording as interpreted by Carolina First because Blasco \r\n  â€œdidnâ€™t have . . . [in] mind at allâ€ that the Trustâ€™s interests would not be \r\n  protected if B&amp;B never purchased the surety bond.Â  Spivey even admitted \r\n  that â€œthe purpose of the surety bond was to be in place at the time anyone else, \r\n  other than B&amp;B and Walker Development Trust, had an interest in that property.â€Â  \r\n\r\nIV. Equitable Lien\r\nCarolina First claims \r\n  that the trial judge erred when he concluded that an equitable lien was created \r\n  because the parties did not intend the property to serve as security for the \r\n  payment of the debt.Â  \r\nBecause we decided a constructive trust was created by the unconscionable conduct \r\n  of B&amp;B and Carolina First through its attorney, we need not address this \r\n  issue.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and SHORT JJ., and CURETON A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-607","title":"State v.

Darwin, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this medical negligence \r\n  claim, appellants Gloria Owenby and her husband John Owenby, appeal the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment and argue that the two-year statute of limitations \r\n  for the claim had not run.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nAfter experiencing \r\n  serious discomfort in her abdominal region for several weeks, Gloria Owenby \r\n  visited a doctor and less than a week later she had surgery to remove a 24-pound \r\n  ovarian tumor, her ovaries, and her gall bladder. Dr. Kyle Kiesau and Dr. Auburn \r\n  Woods performed the surgery on July 21, 1999 at Spartanburg Regional Medical \r\n  Center. \r\nThe chronology of events \r\n  in this case is critical.Â  After her discharge from the hospital on July 27, \r\n  Mrs. Owenby continually experienced a series of health problems for which various \r\n  physicians treated her.Â  On August 10, Dr. Julian Williams examined Mrs. Owenbyâ€™s \r\n  abdominal swelling and referred her again to Dr. Kiesau, an obstetrician/gynecologist.Â  \r\n  Drs. Williams and Kiesau examined Mrs. Owenby August 24 and Dr. Kiesau informed \r\n  Mrs. Owenby that he believed a hematoma resulting from the surgery was causing \r\n  the continued swelling and subsequently approved her to take a planned vacation \r\n  with her husband. Mrs. Owenby described herself as â€œdeathly sickâ€ throughout \r\n  the vacation and visited Dr. Kiesau upon her return on September 17 and September \r\n  24, where he became concerned with her increased swelling.Â  Dr. Kiesau referred \r\n  Mrs. Owenby to Dr. Woods, a general surgeon, and Dr. Woods performed an ultrasound \r\n  on September 27.Â  Dr. Woods determined Mrs. Owenbyâ€™s abdomen was full of fluid, \r\n  opining that she was suffering from a seroma as a result of the surgery. \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nMrs. Owenby visited Dr. Woodsâ€™ \r\n  office with continued abdominal drainage on October 4 and October 6.Â  Dr. Lawrence \r\n  Warren, when performing an ultrasound procedure on October 18, asked the Owenbys \r\n  if the fluid had been tested to see if it was urine, indicating that sometimes \r\n  during surgery, the ureter is damaged by getting small slits or holes in it, \r\n  which creates leakage. [3] Â  Later that same day, Dr. Woods told Mrs. Owenby \r\n  that he had spoken with Dr. Warren and that a test would be scheduled to determine \r\n  if the fluid was urine as Dr. Warren suspected.Â  After abdominal and pelvic \r\n  CT scans were performed on October 19, Dr. Woodsâ€™ office called Mrs. Owenby \r\n  on October 21 and instructed her the tests indicated she should see a urologist \r\n  immediately. \r\nOn October 26, 1999, Mrs. Owenby \r\n  saw an urologist, Dr. Clifton Williams, who told her she had an injured left \r\n  ureter that was leaking and causing urine to drain into her abdomen and that \r\n  it needed to be repaired. On November 2, Dr. Williams attempted to repair Mrs. \r\n  Owenbyâ€™s ureter but was unsuccessful, because, as he discovered during surgery, \r\n  Mrs. Owenbyâ€™s ureter was completely severed, about which he informed Mrs. Owenby \r\n  after the procedure. [4] Â  \r\nMrs. Owenby was asked under oath \r\n  if October 26, 1999 was the first time she recalled being told she â€œhad a ureter \r\n  that apparently had some sort of leak and was causing this excess drainage?â€ \r\n  She responded: â€œOther than what I believe the radiologist, Dr. Warren, told \r\n  me that day, that was the only time I heard that mentioned that I recall.â€Â  \r\n\r\nThe Owenbys filed this action \r\n  for medical negligence on October 31, 2001 based on a ureter injury and served \r\n  Dr. Kiesau on November 1, 2001.Â  Spartanburg Regional, a governmental entity, \r\n  was substituted as a defendant for Dr. Kiesau and moved for summary judgment. \r\n  [5]  Â At the summary judgment hearing, the trial court ruled that the statute \r\n  of limitations had run. This appeal follows.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  In arguing that the trial \r\n    court erred in granting summary judgment based on the running of the statute \r\n    of limitations, Mrs. Owenby submits that she did not discover her injury until \r\n    November 2, 1999 and she filed her claim in a timely fashion.Â  We disagree.\r\n  In an action against a governmental \r\n    entity, the two-year statute of limitations of the South Carolina Tort Claims \r\n    Act applies.Â  S.C. Code Ann.Â  Â§Â§15-78-100(a)â€”110 (Supp. 2003).Â  In examining \r\n    when the statute of limitations began to run, the discovery rule applies.Â  \r\n    Young v. South Carolina Dept. of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, 718, 511 \r\n    S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding that the discovery rule applies to \r\n    actions brought under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act).Â  \r\n\r\n  According to the discovery \r\n    rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when a cause of action reasonably \r\n    ought to have been discovered.Â  The statute runs from the date the injured \r\n    party knows or should have known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that \r\n    a cause of action arises from the wrongful conduct.\r\n  . . . .\r\n  [T]he injured party must act with some promptness where the \r\n    facts and circumstances of an injury place a reasonable person of common knowledge \r\n    and experience on notice that a claim against another party might exist. \r\n    Â Moreover, the fact that the injured party may not comprehend the full extent \r\n    of the damage is immaterial.\r\n\r\n  Id. at 719, 511 S.E.2d at 416 (quoting Dean v. Ruscon Corp., \r\n    321 S.C. 360, 364, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996) (citations omitted) (emphasis \r\n    in original)).Â  See also, Joubert v. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 341 \r\n    S.C. 176, 190, 534 S.E.2d 1, 8 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding that the statute of \r\n    limitations under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act begins to run â€œwhen the \r\n    plaintiff should know that he might have a potential claim against another, \r\n    not when he develops a full-blown theory of recoveryâ€).Â  The date when the \r\n    discovery should have been made is an objective question.Â  Young, 333 \r\n    S.C. at 719, 511 S.E.2d at 416.\r\n\r\n  â€œ[W]hether the particular \r\n    plaintiff actually knew he had a claim is not the test.Â  Rather, courts must \r\n    decide whether the circumstances of the case would put a person of common \r\n    knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his had been invaded \r\n    or that some claim against another party might exist.â€\r\n\r\n  Id.\r\n  The crux of Mrs. Owenbyâ€™s argument \r\n    is that her injury was not discoverable to a person of common knowledge.Â  \r\n    She cites Pederson v. Gould, 288 S.C. 141, 341 S.E.2d 633, 634 (1986) \r\n    for her argument that expert testimony is often needed in medical malpractice \r\n    actions, because the subject matter is outside the scope of common knowledge.Â  \r\n    The Pederson court does find that damage to the ureter that occurs \r\n    during a hysterectomy does not fall under common knowledge exception.Â  Id. \r\n    at 143, 341 S.E.2d at 634.Â  However, the common knowledge exception rule applies \r\n    to the use of expert testimony in medical malpractice cases to determine the \r\n    appropriate standard of care.Â  Id. at 142-43, 341 S.E.2d at 634-35 \r\n    (finding that the trial court did not err in failing to charge the jury as \r\n    to the common knowledge exception).Â  The support is misplaced.Â  The present \r\n    case is about the discovery of an injury.\r\n  As to the discovery of her injury, \r\n    Mrs. Owenby attempts to distinguish her situation from that in Bayle v. \r\n    South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. \r\n    2001). [6] Â  Further she argues \r\n    that the injury to the party in Bayle was easier to link to the car \r\n    accident that caused it.Â  The Bayle court held that the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n    loss, which triggered the statute of limitations, was the death of his wife, \r\n    not the date he learned of a possible latent defect in the road.Â  Id. \r\n    at 122, 739 S.E.2d at 739.Â  The trial court simply cited the discovery rule \r\n    in Bayle, which cites Dean, Young, and Joubert \r\n    all mentioned above.Â  She further argues that this â€œâ€˜simplifiedâ€™ understanding \r\n    of the discovery ruleâ€ is countered by Strong v. Univ. of South Carolina \r\n    School of Medicine, 316 S.C. 189, 447 S.E.2d 850 (1994).Â  She interprets \r\n    Strong as holding injury only is not enough to start the statute of \r\n    limitations, that circumstances sufficient to put the injured party on notice \r\n    are needed. [7] Â  Mrs. \r\n    Owenby argues the trial court relied on her knowledge of the injury only, \r\n    rather than her knowledge that a claim might exist, citing the facts of Strong \r\n    where the plaintiff knew of his blindness in May 1989 but did not know the \r\n    cause until June 1989, when a doctor noted it in the plaintiffâ€™s medical file.Â  \r\n    Id. at 191, 447 S.E.2d at 852.Â  In the instant case, the trial court \r\n    did not determine that the statute of limitations started with Mrs. Owenbyâ€™s \r\n    first knowledge of any injury.Â  Rather, the court determined that she was \r\n    told on October 18, 1999 of the possibility of an injury to her ureter and \r\n    that such an injury could have been caused during surgery.Â  Thereafter, \r\n    she was told that she did indeed have such an injury.Â  At the latest, Mrs. \r\n    Owenby discovered her injury on October 26, 1999.\r\n  Mrs. Owenby says that the circumstances did not \r\n    put her on notice until November 2, 1999. \r\n    [8] Â  To find that she needed to know that her ureter was completely severed, \r\n    as she was told on November 2, does not have foundation in the law, which \r\n    is that understanding the full extent of the injury is immaterial.Â  See \r\n    Young, Â 333 S.C. at 719, 511 S.E.2d at 416. Â By October \r\n    26, 1999, she knew that she had an injury to her ureter and that it was an \r\n    injury that could have been caused during surgery.Â  This was sufficient information \r\n    to put a person of common knowledge on notice that a claim existed.Â  \r\n  Viewed in a light \r\n    most favorable to Mrs. Owenby, the facts of this case make clear that she \r\n    discovered her injury no later than October 26, 1999.Â  Because Mrs. Owenby \r\n    did not file her claim within the applicable statute of limitations, the trial \r\n    court was correct to have granted Spartanburg Regionalâ€™s motion for summary \r\n    judgment.Â  Therefore, the decision of the trial court is\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n  ANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  From September 30 to October 1, Mrs. Owenby was admitted to Spartanburg \r\n    Regional to drain some 5,500 milliliters of fluid after the initial procedure. \r\n    Additional fluid was drained while she was hospitalized and after her \r\n    discharge from the hospital.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  The Owenbys both indicated the fluid looked to be urine and drained \r\n    from at a rate of 1,200 to 1,500 milliliters per day October 6 through October \r\n    13.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  Dr. Williams reattached Mrs. Owenbyâ€™s ureter in a procedure on March \r\n    20, 2000.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  By the date of the hearing, all other defendants had been dismissed.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  She also attempts to distinguish Wiggins v. Edwards, 314 S.C. \r\n    126, 442 S.E.2d 169 (1994) for the same reason.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  Strong reiterates the discovery rule: that the statute of \r\n    limitations begins to run when a person of common knowledge is put on notice \r\n    that some right has been invaded or a claim may exist, not when legal advice \r\n    has been obtained or a full blown theory of recovery has been established.Â  \r\n    316 S.C. at 191, 447 S.E.2d at 852 (citation omitted).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  The length of time it took doctors with expert knowledge to determine \r\n    her injury, as Mrs. Owenby argues, does not bolster the notion that a person \r\n    of common knowledge would have known a claim existed once that person was \r\n    told of the injury. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-611","title":"Mid-South Management  v.

Battle, \r\n  of Conway, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Spartanburg Beach Cove Associates (Spartanburg) and Sherwood \r\n  Development Corporation (Sherwood) dispute their monetary contributions to a \r\n  settlement of lawsuits brought against their joint venture, Beach Cove Associates \r\n  (the â€œjoint ventureâ€).Â  Sherwood and its affiliates (Appellants), appeal an \r\n  order finding Spartanburg and its affiliates (Respondents), are entitled to \r\n  a judgment in the amount of $278,333.33, plus interest.Â  We affirm.  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nBeach Cove Development Corporation (BCD), Spartanburg, and \r\n  Sherwood created the joint venture in 1983 to develop land and sell condominiums \r\n  in Horry County.Â  Originally, Spartanburg had a 50% interest in the joint venture, \r\n  and Sherwood and BCD each had a 25% interest.Â  BCD defaulted as a joint venturer \r\n  sometime in the mid 1980â€™s, before the litigation began, leaving Spartanburg \r\n  with a two-thirds interest, and Sherwood with a one-third interest.\r\nSpartanburg, Sherwood, and BCD entered into a joint venture \r\n  agreement (â€œAgreementâ€) on August 23, 1983.Â  The Agreement described the project \r\n  to be undertaken and defined the role of the venturers.Â  BCD was granted limited \r\n  powers of management.Â  However, after BCD defaulted, Spartanburg became the \r\n  majority venturer, and thus gained control as the managing venturer. \r\nThe management authority was subject to certain \r\n  limitations.Â  The Agreement provided that none of the venturers would have authority \r\n  to act for or assume any obligations or responsibility on behalf of any other \r\n  venturer or the joint venture.Â  Additionally, the Agreement restricted management \r\n  of the joint venture from making certain expenditures without prior authorization \r\n  and provided that venturers could not take actions binding the joint venture \r\n  without the consent of the other venturers.Â  \r\nThe Agreement specified initial contributions, and provisions \r\n  were made for additional capital contributions.Â  Sherwood agreed to use its \r\n  best efforts to obtain loans to provide financing as necessary, and BCD was \r\n  given authorization to require additional contributions from the venturers by \r\n  giving written notice.Â  The Agreement further provided that no venturer would \r\n  be required to make any capital contribution or loan to the joint venture other \r\n  than as provided in this Agreement or as mutually agreed upon by the parties.Â  \r\n  The Agreement also provided for allocation of profits and losses:Â  â€œThe respective \r\n  share of each Venturer in all joint venture income and expenses and each item \r\n  thereof, including depreciation and any investment tax credits, shall be allocated \r\n  to the Venturers in accordance with their Percentage Interest.â€Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFinally, the Agreement contained indemnification \r\n  provisions.Â  The venturers agreed to hold each other harmless from losses resulting \r\n  from, among other things, lawsuits against the joint venture arising out of \r\n  breach of the Agreement.Â  Additionally, upon dissolution the parties agreed \r\n  to fund any negative balances. \r\nPursuant to the Agreement, the condominiums were built, but \r\n  the project was largely unsuccessful.Â  The project encountered serious difficulties \r\n  because of federal tax changes, increased construction costs, and problems with \r\n  management.Â  Numerous capital calls were made and Sherwood paid all of them.Â  \r\n  Additionally, in August 1993, Beach Cove Ocean Resort Homeowners Association, \r\n  Inc., sued the joint venture, alleging construction defects in the condominiums \r\n  and the parking garage.Â  The lawsuit also named numerous other defendants, including \r\n  the builders and suppliers of Beach Cove Ocean Resort.Â  Individual homeowners \r\n  in the condominium project also brought a class action lawsuit against the joint \r\n  venture.Â  \r\nThe joint venture retained the Bellamy Law Firm (Bellamy), \r\n  which advised the joint venture that a trial on the merits could result in a \r\n  significant judgment against it.Â  When mediation failed, Bellamy began working \r\n  on a settlement.Â  A conflict of interest existed in that Sherwood was set up \r\n  as a corporation with no assets, and was thus effectively judgment-proof, whereas \r\n  Spartanburg, a general partnership capable of responding to an adverse judgment, \r\n  was not.Â  Bellamy was aware of the possible conflict and discussed it with the \r\n  venturers.Â  Howell Bellamy, Jr., testified the venturers agreed that Bellamy \r\n  would continue to represent the joint venture and the venturers would deal with \r\n  their differences later.Â  Sherwood initially refused to contribute anything \r\n  toward a potential settlement, but did pay some of the legal fees.\r\nIn January 1997, Mike Gerald, president of Sherwood, and \r\n  Ray Harris, Spartanburgâ€™s corporate attorney, discussed the possibility that \r\n  the lawsuits could be settled if the joint venture authorized Bellamy to offer \r\n  up to $1 million in settlement.Â  As a result, Harris called Bellamy and confirmed \r\n  the joint venture would contribute up to $1 million to settle the lawsuits.Â  \r\n  The minutes from the Sherwood Board of Directors meeting on January 16, \r\n  1997 show that Sherwood approved the authorization to fund the settlement, but \r\n  there was an erroneous assumption that the other defendants would contribute \r\n  approximately $650,000 towards the $1 million settlement, so the joint venture \r\n  would be responsible for only $300,000.Â  The Sherwood board then approved a \r\n  measure to commit $100,000, or one-third of the anticipated amount, toward the \r\n  settlement.Â  This offer was subject to approval by Spartanburg and receipt of \r\n  a full release of Sherwood.Â  However, Harris thought Sherwoodâ€™s offer was unsatisfactory.Â  \r\n  Thus, Spartanburg did not respond and subsequently rejected the offer. \r\nSpartanburg decided to authorize Bellamy to continue with \r\n  the settlement negotiations and â€œdeal with Sherwood at a later time.â€Â  Bellamy \r\n  continued to work on a settlement and in February 1997 all parties to the underlying \r\n  litigation entered into a global settlement in the amount of $5,450,000.Â  The \r\n  joint venture was responsible for $835,000 of the total settlement.Â  Spartanburg \r\n  then issued a capital call requiring Sherwood to contribute $278,333.33, or \r\n  one-third of the joint ventureâ€™s portion.Â  However, Sherwood refused to pay.Â  \r\n  Spartanburg paid the entire amount and sued Sherwood to collect its share of \r\n  the settlement.Â  The joint venture was dissolved as of December 31, 1998.Â  \r\n\r\nThe case was referred to a master-in-equity by a consent \r\n  order of the parties.Â  The claims against Appellants were bifurcated because \r\n  all the other Appellants stood in the shoes of Sherwood in regard to the claims \r\n  asserted in this case.Â  The claims against Sherwood were tried before the master, \r\n  and he issued a preliminary order finding Sherwood was liable for its share \r\n  of the settlement as alleged, plus pre-judgment interest in the amount of $158,302.11, \r\n  for a total of $436,635.44.Â  Sherwood made a motion for reconsideration.Â  In \r\n  August 2003, the master issued an order denying Sherwoodâ€™s motion to the extent \r\n  it sought to reverse his findings of fact and conclusions of law, resolving \r\n  his findings on certain testimony in Spartanburgâ€™s favor, and adopting the preliminary \r\n  order as the final order and judgment against Sherwood.Â  Sherwood now appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an action at law, referred to a master for final judgment, this \r\n  court will correct errors of law, but we must affirm the masterâ€™s factual findings \r\n  unless there is no evidence that reasonably supports those findings. Jefferies \r\n  v. Phillips, 316 S.C. 523, 527, 451 S.E.2d 21, 22-23 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The \r\n  complaint alleges four causes of action against Sherwood, three of which are \r\n  legal claims.Â  Of these, two involve breach of the joint venture Agreement, \r\n  and one is a claim for contribution pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-510 (Supp. \r\n  2003).Â  See Sterling Dev. Co. v. Collins, 309 S.C. 237, 240, 421 \r\n  S.E.2d 402, 404 (1992) (action for breach of contract seeking money damages \r\n  is an action at law); Wallace v. Milliken &amp; Co., 300 S.C. 553, 555, \r\n  389 S.E.2d 448, 449 (Ct. App. 1990), affâ€™d as modified, 305 S.C. 118, \r\n  406 S.E.2d 358 (1991) (actions created by statute are generally legal in nature).\r\nThe fourth issue, quantum meruit, is equitable in nature.Â  \r\n  When both legal and equitable claims are in the same suit, each retains its \r\n  own identity and applicable standard of review.Â  Corley v. Ott, 326 S.C. \r\n  89, 92, 485 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1997).Â  In equity cases, the appellate court may \r\n  find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 544, 590 S.E.2d 338, 345 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSherwood argues \r\n  it is not required to pay its share of the settlement because it did not agree \r\n  to contribute to the settlement.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nPartnership law \r\n  governs relations among joint venturers.Â  Matter of Fox, 327 S.C. 293, \r\n  301, 490 S.E.2d 265, 270 (1997).Â  â€œPractically the only difference between a \r\n  â€˜joint adventureâ€™ and a â€˜partnershipâ€™ is that a partnership is ordinarily for \r\n  the transaction of a general business of a particular kind, while a joint adventure \r\n  relates to a single transaction.â€Â  Wellington v. Crosland, 129 S.C. 127, \r\n  141, 123 S.E. 776, 781 (1924).Â  Accordingly, joint venturers owe each other \r\n  the highest level of fiduciary duty, as in partnerships.Â  Kuznik v. Bees \r\n  Ferry Assoc., 342 S.C. 579, 597-98, 538 S.E.2d 15, 24-25 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n  Also, section 33-41-510(1) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003) provides \r\n  that each joint venturer must contribute toward the joint ventureâ€™s losses according \r\n  to its share of the profits unless there is a contrary agreement between the \r\n  venturers.Â  \r\nIt is unclear from \r\n  the record whether an agreement was ever reached between the parties in regard \r\n  to authorization of the settlement.Â  However, under partnership law, Spartanburg \r\n  does not have to show that Sherwood agreed to contribute to the settlement.Â  \r\n  Each venturer in a joint venture is an agent of the joint venture, and his or \r\n  her acts done in the ordinary course of business bind the joint venture.Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 33-41-310 (1990).Â  Thus, if the settlement was a valid act of the \r\n  joint venture, done in the ordinary course of business, Sherwood must contribute \r\n  its share unless it can show an agreement to the contrary.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  33-41-510(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nThere is evidence \r\n  in the record to support the masterâ€™s finding that authorization of the settlement \r\n  was in the ordinary course of business.Â Â  Although the venturers never voted \r\n  on the settlement, Sherwood offered $100,000 toward the settlement, which represented \r\n  what it believed at the time to be one-third of the joint ventureâ€™s obligation.Â  \r\n  Neither Gerald nor anyone else at Sherwood objected to the settlement, and Gerald \r\n  testified he was present in the courtroom when the settlement was announced \r\n  on the record in open court. \r\nSpartanburg made \r\n  the decision to go forward, believing it had the authority as majority venturer \r\n  to act for the joint venture.Â  Harris, acting as counsel for Spartanburg, made \r\n  the call to Bellamy to authorize the settlement on behalf of the joint venture.Â  \r\n  Once the authorization was made, the obligation became a valid debt of the joint \r\n  venture.Â  Sherwood agreed to pay one-third of any valid joint venture debts \r\n  under the Agreement.Â  Although there is some disagreement as to whether Sherwood \r\n  agreed to fund the settlement, there is no dispute that Spartanburg did not \r\n  agree that Sherwood would be relieved of its responsibility to pay its part \r\n  of the settlement amount.Â  Thus, Sherwood is required under partnership law \r\n  to pay its share of the settlement.Â  \r\nSherwood argues \r\n  section 1.3 of the Agreement, which provides that a venturer is only liable \r\n  for debts or obligations incurred pursuant to the Agreement, absolves it of \r\n  liability for the settlement because it was not an obligation incurred pursuant \r\n  to the Agreement.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nThe settlement \r\n  did not create a new obligation for the joint venture. Â It merely settled a \r\n  contingent liability.Â  The lawsuits were a liability of the joint venture, not \r\n  just Spartanburg, and there was evidence that an adverse judgment could have \r\n  cost more than $13 million.Â  Regardless of the amount eventually agreed upon, \r\n  Sherwood demonstrated it was willing to participate in a settlement by approving \r\n  a contribution of $100,000.Â  Therefore, section 1.3 does not remove Sherwoodâ€™s \r\n  obligation to pay its share.\r\nSherwood also argues \r\n  the settlement payment was not a valid joint venture debt because Spartanburg \r\n  paid the settlement amount out of its own account for tax purposes.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nWhether or not \r\n  parties attempt to characterize payments as something they are not for tax purposes \r\n  does not affect the agreement between the partners.Â  Bray v. Head, 311 \r\n  S.C. 490, 496-97, 429 S.E.2d 842, 845-46 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Spartanburg intended \r\n  the payment to be on behalf of the joint venture.Â  In Kuznik v. Bees Ferry \r\n  Assoc., 342 S.C. 579, 538 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 2000), this court considered \r\n  several factors in determining whether a promissory note was a valid partnership \r\n  obligation.Â  While one of the factors the court considered was how the partnership \r\n  characterized the debt, the court also considered other factors, including capital \r\n  calls from the partnership and testimony from a partner and an attorney for \r\n  the partnership.Â  Id. at 591-92, 538 S.E.2d at 21-22.Â  Applying these \r\n  factors to this case, we find no error in the masterâ€™s conclusion that the settlement \r\n  was a valid partnership obligation.\r\nThe master further \r\n  found that Section 33-41-510(1) of the South Carolina Code created a right of \r\n  contribution in Spartanburg from Sherwood.Â  This is consistent with our holding \r\n  in Kuznik, where we upheld a finding of entitlement to indemnity once \r\n  a valid partnership obligation was found.Â  Thus, without determining whether \r\n  the statute itself created a right of contribution, Spartanburg clearly had \r\n  a common law right of contribution for indemnity.Â  Additionally, the joint venture \r\n  Agreement itself creates a right of indemnity in Spartanburg from Sherwood.Â  \r\n  Pursuant to section 9.4.5 of the Agreement, Sherwood is required to pay its \r\n  share of the settlement in order to remove the negative capital balance that \r\n  was created when the joint venture dissolved. Â \r\nBecause the settlement \r\n  created a valid joint venture obligation, and Sherwood is required to pay its \r\n  share under both partnership law and the Agreement, we need not address the \r\n  quantum meruit claim or the remaining issues in this case.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  Sherwood is liable for one-third of the settlement.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-612","title":"State v.

W.

[1] \r\n FACTS\r\n  Edward Flanary (Husband) married Carolyn Flanary (Wife) in 1980. Both Husband \r\n    and Wife had children from a previous marriage. Initially, Husband worked \r\n    in sales and Wife stayed at home as a homemaker.Â  In 1981, the parties opened \r\n    a retail fabric business, eventually selling their interest in the company \r\n    in 1987.Â  In 1990, Husband and Wife started American Foam and Fabric (American \r\n    Foam) to sell replacement headliners for automobiles.Â  At the time of trial, \r\n    the business had grown from a few part-time employees to ten full-time employees.Â  \r\n    Husband carried most of the responsibility for running and managing the business. \r\n    Wife assisted with the business, receiving a small salary for secretarial \r\n    duties she performed during the day while the children attended school.Â  Wife \r\n    worked regularly at American Foam until 1997 when she quit to take care of \r\n    her father who had been diagnosed with cancer. \r\n  Husband and Wife separated in 1998 and after several failed \r\n    attempts to reconcile. Wife filed for divorce in June 2000 based on a one-year \r\n    separation; however, the case was administratively dismissed for lack of trial \r\n    or other disposition within two hundred and seventy days.Â  In January 2002, \r\n    Husband filed for divorce, which the court granted in September 2002. A hearing \r\n    was held to determine issues related to alimony, equitable division, and attorneysâ€™ \r\n    fees. The family court awarded Wife permanent periodic alimony, divided the \r\n    marital assets, and denied attorneysâ€™ fees to either party. Husband filed \r\n    a motion for reconsideration arguing the court erred in its equitable division, \r\n    which was denied.Â  This appeal follows.\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  Husband \r\n    argues the family court abused its discretion by miscalculating the marital \r\n    estate and failing to grant Husband a greater portion of the estate.Â  We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code lists fifteen factors for the \r\n    court to consider in making an equitable apportionment of marital estates \r\n    and vests the discretion to decide what weight should be assigned to the various \r\n    factors in the family court. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2003).Â  â€œOn \r\n    review, we look to the fairness of the overall apportionment; if the end result \r\n    is equitable, it is irrelevant that we might have weighed specific factors \r\n    differently than the family court.â€Â  Â Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. \r\n    88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œThis court will affirm the \r\n    family court judge if it can be determined that the judge addressed the factors \r\n    under section 20-7-472 sufficiently for us to conclude he was cognizant of \r\n    the statutory factors.â€Â  Id. Â Â \r\n  Husband contends the family court intended to give each party an equal portion \r\n    of the estate and the court omitted certain debt in its calculations; however, \r\n    the courtâ€™s order refutes this claim.Â  The order approximates an equal apportionment \r\n    of assets, yet Husband received a greater debt ratio. While Husband does carry \r\n    a greater load of the marital debt, he also receives income-producing assets \r\n    to assist in extinguishing the debt. All the debt calculations might not have \r\n    been clearly delineated in the courtâ€™s order; however, the entirety of Husbandâ€™s \r\n    debt appears plainly in the order. Furthermore, the family court addressed \r\n    Husbandâ€™s argument in its order denying the motion for reconsideration and \r\n    reiterated the reasons for dividing the estate in such a manner.Â  The court \r\n    listed several factors to compensate for Husbandâ€™s higher debt ratio, including \r\n    awarding American Foam to Husband, imputing income to Wife, assigning a lower \r\n    than actual income to Husband, and allowing Husband an annual credit. \r\n  The law of equitable distribution is premised on providing the family court \r\n    the flexibility to view each case based on individual circumstances peculiar \r\n    to the parties involved and to fashion division of partiesâ€™ assets in a manner \r\n    that is uniquely fair to the parties concerned.Â  Thomas v. Thomas, \r\n    353 S.C. 523, 529, 579 S.E.2d 310, 313 (2003).Â  Equitable division is not \r\n    necessarily equal division. Â Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its \r\n    discretion when determining equitable division of the marital estate.\r\n  AFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\n   ANDERSON, J., concurs.Â  STILWELL, J., dissents in a separate \r\n    opinion.\r\n  STILWELL, J. (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, \r\n    the net result of the division of marital assets and the assignment of marital \r\n    debt is inequitable distribution, not equitable distribution.\r\n  The total amount of gross assets, according to the calculations relied upon \r\n    by the family court, is $1,224,521.Â  The total amount of marital debts is \r\n    $937,777.75, resulting in net equity to be equitably apportioned of $286,743.25.Â  \r\n    Even though Husband received gross assets valued at $961,725, he was assigned \r\n    total marital debts of $880,026, leaving him with a net equity pursuant to \r\n    equitable distribution of $81,699 as compared to Wifeâ€™s net equitable distribution \r\n    valued at $205,044.Â  I am convinced this is not the result intended by the \r\n    court.Â  The wording of the order itself clearly indicates the court wanted \r\n    to make â€œan approximate equal division of the properties,â€ and the requirement \r\n    in the order that the Husband pay down the first mortgage on the marital home \r\n    was designed to â€œequalize the division.â€Â  \r\n  This conclusion is buttressed by the family courtâ€™s final analysis of the \r\n    equitable distribution award when it summarized the results by stating that \r\n    Husbandâ€™s â€œnet marital estate,â€ after calculating the debt assigned to Husband, \r\n    â€œwill be $222,632.39â€ and compared that with â€œWifeâ€™s net estate . . . [of] \r\n    $215,501.28.â€Â  This leads to the inescapable conclusion that there has been \r\n    a mathematical miscalculation, since the sum of these two figures greatly \r\n    exceeds the total value of the net estate.Â  For this reason, I believe the \r\n    result of the family courtâ€™s equitable distribution award was not as intended.\r\n  Even if the family court intended this result, I would favor reversing because, \r\n    in my opinion, this division, which apportions approximately 71% of the net \r\n    marital estate to Wife where there is no marital fault involved, no children \r\n    were born of the union, and Wife is awarded $2,000 per month in alimony, is \r\n    patently unfair and inequitable.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-614","title":"Ashley Villas Homeownersâ€™ Association v.

Evans (the â€œdeveloperâ€) developed the neighborhood in 1974.Â  At \r\n    that time, the developer recorded the original restrictive covenants in the \r\n    Register of Mesne Conveyance (RMC) office for Charleston County.\r\n  The developer built and maintained common recreation \r\n    areas in the neighborhood; however, he deeded the recreation areas to the \r\n    Ashley Villa homeowners in 1976.Â  The homeowners accepted the transfer and \r\n    created the Recreation Association to maintain the areas.Â  The Recreation \r\n    Association was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in March 1976. \r\n  By 1990, the neighborhood had fallen into a state \r\n    of disrepair.Â  As a result, a group of homeowners organized an effort to improve \r\n    the neighborhood.Â  The group sought the votes necessary to amend the original \r\n    covenants and to establish a homeownersâ€™ association to enforce the covenants.Â  \r\n    In December 1994, the group recorded the amended covenants and the creation \r\n    of the Homeownersâ€™ Association in the RMC. \r\n  Initially, the Recreation Association continued \r\n    to own the recreation areas.Â  However, the Recreation Associationâ€™s members \r\n    voted to transfer the recreation areas to the newly created Homeownersâ€™ Association \r\n    because the association lacked the funds necessary to maintain the areas.Â  \r\n    The Homeownersâ€™ Association accepted the transfer in December 1998.\r\n  On August 9, 2000, the Homeownersâ€™ Association brought \r\n    an action to collect past due annual assessments from delinquent homeowners.Â  \r\n    The trial court ordered arbitration and an arbitration hearing was held on \r\n    June 13, 2001.Â  The arbitrator found in favor of the Homeownersâ€™ Association \r\n    and awarded it past due annual assessments and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Respondents \r\n    appealed and the judge granted them a right to a jury trial.Â  The Homeownersâ€™ \r\n    Association then filed a motion for summary judgment, which was denied on \r\n    December 20, 2001.Â  Respondents also filed a motion for summary judgment and \r\n    a hearing was held on September 18, 2003.Â  The trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ \r\n    motion for summary judgment on November 18, 2002.Â  The Homeownersâ€™ Association \r\n    now appeals.\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, we review all ambiguities, \r\n      conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence in a light most favorable \r\n      to the non-moving party.Â  Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., \r\n      349 S.C. 558, 563, 564 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2002).Â  â€œSummary judgment is appropriate \r\n      when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and the \r\n      conclusions and inferences to be drawn from the facts are undisputed.â€Â  \r\n      Etheredge v. Richland Sch. Dist. One, 341 S.C. 307, 311, 534 S.E.2d \r\n      275, 277 (2000).Â  Moreover, summary judgment is proper only when the moving \r\n      party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Jackson v. Doe, \r\n      342 S.C. 552, 555, 537 S.E.2d 567, 568 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n    â€œSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts \r\n      of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  Tupper \r\n      v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997). \r\n      â€œSummary judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as \r\n      to evidentiary facts if there is dispute as to the conclusion to be drawn \r\n      from those facts.â€Â  Id.Â  Summary judgment is a drastic remedy, which \r\n      should be cautiously invoked so that no party will be improperly deprived \r\n      of a trial of the disputed factual issue.Â  Schmidt v. Courtney, 357 \r\n      S.C. 310, 318-319, 592 S.E.2d 326, 331 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Extrinsic Evidence\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\nHomeownersâ€™ Association argues the trial court erred in admitting extrinsic\r\nevidence to explain the terms of the original covenants because the evidence\r\nviolates the parol evidence rule.&nbsp; We\r\nagree.\r\n      The parol evidence \r\n      rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic evidence of agreements or understandings \r\n      contemporaneous with or prior to execution of a written instrument when \r\n      the extrinsic evidence is to be used to contradict, vary, or explain the \r\n      written instrument.â€Â Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards,\r\n      354 S.C. 459, 471, 581 S.E.2d 496, 502 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œThe cardinal rule \r\n      of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention \r\n      of the parties and, in determining that intention, the court looks to the \r\n      language of the contract.â€Â  Friarsgate, Inc. v. First Federal Sav. and \r\n      Loan Assâ€™n of South Carolina, 317 S.C. 452, 457, 454 S.E.2d 901, 905 \r\n      (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œWhen a contract is unambiguous, clear, and explicit, \r\n      it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used, to be \r\n      taken and understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.â€Â  Id.\r\nAshley Villasâ€™\r\noriginal covenants state that the â€œ[c]ovenants shall automatically renew . . .\r\nunless a change in part or in whole shall be agreed upon by a majority vote of\r\nthe homeowners of Ashley Villas.â€\r\nRespondents argue the developer never intended for Ashley Villas to have\r\na homeownersâ€™ association.To\r\nprove the developer did not intend for the language â€œchange in part or in\r\nwholeâ€ to include altering the original covenants to allow for the creation of\r\na homeownersâ€™ association, the trial court allowed an affidavit from Alvie\r\nEvans, an individual involved in the original development of Ashley Villas, to\r\nbe admitted as extrinsic evidence.However,\r\ntaken in the light most favorable to the Homeownersâ€™ Association, the language\r\nof the original covenants was â€œunambiguous, clear, and explicitâ€ in its\r\nâ€œplain, ordinary, and popular sense.â€Therefore,\r\nthe trial court erred in admitting Evansâ€™ affidavit to prove the developerâ€™s\r\nintent.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  Moreover, summary judgment was improper even if the language of the \r\n  original covenants was ambiguous because the determination of a partyâ€™s intent \r\n  is a question of fact.Â  Southern Financial Servs., Inc. v. Middleton, \r\n  349 S.C. 77, 81, 562 S.E.2d 482, 484 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œOnce the court decides \r\n  the language is ambiguous, evidence may be admitted to show the intent of the \r\n  parties.â€Â  Id.Â  Examined in the light most favorable to the Homeownersâ€™ \r\n  Association, there is conflicting evidence as to the developerâ€™s intent.Â  \r\n  Evansâ€™ affidavit stated the developer did not include a homeownersâ€™ association \r\n    in the original covenants because he did not intend for one to be created.Â  \r\n    Phoebe Miller, a past president and current treasurer of the Homeownersâ€™ Association, \r\n    testified the developer did not provide for a homeownersâ€™ association because \r\n    he wanted federal assistance financing.Â  Miller also testified the homeowners \r\n    created a Homeownersâ€™ Association because of new federal guidelines requiring \r\n    a homeownersâ€™ association for federal financing.Â  The conflicting evidence \r\n    of Evansâ€™ affidavit and Millerâ€™s testimony create a genuine issue of material \r\n    fact as to whether the developer intended to qualify for federal financing \r\n    or to exclude a homeownersâ€™ association.Â  Therefore, even if the trial court \r\n    properly admitted the extrinsic evidence, summary judgment was improper because \r\n    a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the developerâ€™s intent.Â  \r\n  \r\n  II. South Carolina Nonprofit Corporation \r\n    Act\r\n  The Homeownersâ€™ Association also contends the trial court erred in holding \r\n    the Recreation Association failed to comply with the South Carolina Nonprofit \r\n    Corporation Act.Â  Specifically, the Homeownersâ€™ Association argues a genuine \r\n    issue of material fact exists as to whether the notice requirements of section \r\n    33-31-1202(c) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003) were satisfied.Â  We \r\n    agree.\r\n  The sale of assets \r\n    by a nonprofit corporation other than in the ordinary course of activities \r\n    is governed by section 33-31-1202 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n    A nonprofit corporation may:\r\n\r\n  [S]ell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, \r\n    of its property, with or without the goodwill, other than in the usual and \r\n    regular course of its activities on the terms and conditions and for the consideration \r\n    determined by the corporationâ€™s board if the proposed transaction is authorized \r\n    by subsection (b).\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-1202(a) \r\n    (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  However, section (c) further states:\r\n\r\n  If the corporation does not have members, or does not have members entitled \r\n    to vote on the transaction, the transaction must be approved by a vote of \r\n    a majority of the directors in office at the time the transaction is approved.Â  \r\n    In addition, the corporation shall provide notice of any directorsâ€™ meeting \r\n    at which such approval is to be obtained in accordance with Section 33-31-822(c).Â  \r\n    The notice also must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the \r\n    meeting is to consider the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of \r\n    all, or substantially all, of the property or assets of the corporation and \r\n    contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of a description of the transaction.\r\n\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-31-1202(c) \r\n    (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\n  If a nonprofit corporation has members entitled to vote, the proposed transaction \r\n    must be approved by the board and by two-thirds of membersâ€™ votes cast or \r\n    a majority of the voting power, whichever is less.Â  S.C.

Â§ 33-31-823(b) (Supp. \r\n    2003).\r\n  At trial, \r\n    Respondents argued the transfer of the recreation area from the Recreation \r\n    Association to the Homeownersâ€™ Association was invalid because the Recreation \r\n    Association failed to comply with the notice requirements of section 33-31-1202(c) \r\n    of the South Carolina Code.Â  Specifically, Respondents alleged some Recreation \r\n    Association members and directors did not receive notice of the transfer or \r\n    vote on the transfer, rendering the transfer invalid.Â  The trial court agreed \r\n    and held the Homeownersâ€™ Association could not charge any assessments because \r\n    it did not own, lease, or have a duty to maintain the recreation areas as \r\n    the transfer was invalid for failure to comply with South Carolina Code section \r\n    33-31-1202.\r\n  Taken in the light most favorable to the Homeownersâ€™ Association, a genuine \r\n    issue of material fact exists as to whether the requisite number of directors \r\n    and members of the Recreation Association received notice and voted on the \r\n    transfer.Â  The parties presented conflicting evidence of the number of Recreation \r\n    Association directors at the time of the transfer.Â  Michael Oshinsky, president \r\n    of the Homeownersâ€™ Association, testified the three directors who voted unanimously \r\n    to transfer the recreation areas to the Homeownersâ€™ Association were also \r\n    the only remaining members of the Recreation Association.Â  Oshinsky testified \r\n    the notice provision of section 33-31-1202 of the South Carolina Code was \r\n    satisfied because the three directors were the only members and their vote \r\n    for the transfer waived the notice requirements.Â  Moreover, evidence suggested \r\n    the Recreational Association had no members after May 3, 1996, which was more \r\n    than four months prior to the September 22, 1996 vote to transfer the property \r\n    to the Homeownersâ€™ Association. \r\n    [2] Â  Therefore, summary judgment was improper.\r\n  REVERSED. \r\n  ANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The Record on Appeal includes a list of members, an itemized category \r\n    report, and check register for the Recreation Association.Â  The last deposit \r\n    for a membership fee was made on May 3, 1995, and because memberships were \r\n    annual the last membership would have expired on May 3, 1996, more than four \r\n    months before the meeting to transfer the recreation areas to the Homeownersâ€™ \r\n    Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-615","title":"State v.

Carlyle Steele, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This case comes before us on appeal from the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  decision reversing and remanding respondentâ€™s conviction in magistrateâ€™s court.Â  \r\n  We reverse the circuit court.1\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent, Michael B. Cunningham, was charged with \r\n  littering and appeared before the magistrate.Â  Waiving his right to counsel \r\n  and to a jury trial, he was found guilty following a bench trial.Â  Cunningham \r\n  appealed to the court of common pleas asserting, among other things, that he \r\n  should receive a new trial because the main witness at the trial â€œdid not testify \r\n  directly, but rather had [the] officer read his statement which was improper \r\n  hearsay.â€Â  \r\nThe magistrate filed a return which included as follows:\r\n\r\nThe State represented \r\n  by Master Deputy, Ben Forrester, presented a sworn statement signed by the victim, \r\n  Mr. V.L. Sloan, about the incident which occurred in his presence on the date \r\n  of May 6, 2002.Â  The victim was present in the courtroom and stated for the \r\n  record that he was the author of that statement.Â  He was also prepared to answer \r\n  any questions that the defendant, Michael Cunningham, might have.Â  He did not \r\n  ask Mr. Sloan anything.Â  This was not improper hearsay.\r\n\r\n*Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  *Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  *\r\n\r\nThe defendant did testify \r\n  in this bench trial merely stating that Mr. Sloan must have been mistaken when \r\n  he stated that he saw the defendant throw a bag of trash out of his truck in \r\n  the early hours of May 6, 2002 while the moon was still in the sky and dawn \r\n  was beginning.Â  The victim was standing by his house not more than 10 feet from \r\n  the road when he saw him throw the trash out.\r\n\r\nOn appeal to the circuit court, Cunninghamâ€™s counsel asserted \r\n  Cunningham was denied the right to confront witnesses against him by admission \r\n  of the hearsay statement, and admission of the hearsay evidence was not cured \r\n  by the right to cross-examination.Â  The State, while not conceding the statement \r\n  was improper hearsay, argued the issue was not properly preserved for appeal, \r\n  as there was no objection below to the reading of the victimâ€™s statement.Â  The \r\n  circuit court agreed that a contemporaneous objection was required, but found \r\n  â€œit would be speculationâ€ to assume there was no objection since there was no \r\n  transcript from the trial.Â  Thereafter, by order dated September 26, 2003, the \r\n  circuit court reversed Cunninghamâ€™s conviction and remanded for a new trial.Â  \r\n  The circuit court judge found the reading of the statement of the witness was \r\n  inadmissible hearsay and, because the return did not address whether an objection \r\n  was made to the reading of the statement, a conclusion by the court that no \r\n  objection was made would involve speculation by the court.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe State appeals, asserting the circuit court erred in reversing \r\n  Cunninghamâ€™s conviction because the record failed to show Cunningham made a \r\n  contemporaneous objection to the admission of the evidence at the trial level.Â  \r\n  We agree.\r\nA circuit court has only appellate jurisdiction over a judgment from magistrate \r\n  court. Â State v. Adler, 278 S.C. 66, 67, 292 S.E.2d 185, 186 (1982).Â  \r\n  In criminal appeals from magistrate court, the circuit court may not conduct \r\n  a trial de novo, but instead reviews for preserved error \r\n  raised by appropriate exception.Â  State v. Henderson, 347 S.C. 455, 457, \r\n  556 S.E.2d 691, 692 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  It is axiomatic that in order to preserve \r\n  an issue for appellate review, a party must make a contemporaneous objection, \r\n  and an issue which is not properly preserved cannot be raised for the first \r\n  time on appeal.Â  State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, \r\n  873 (1994).Â  An issue must be both raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge \r\n  to be preserved for appellate review.Â  State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, \r\n  142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003).\r\nA magistrateâ€™s return is the official record of the trial proceedings, \r\n  and an appellate court may not consider facts not included within the return.Â  \r\n  State v. Brown, 358 S.C. 382, 387-88, 596 S.E.2d 39, 41 (2004).Â  The \r\n  burden is on the appellant to provide a sufficient record from which an appellate \r\n  court can make an intelligent review.Â  State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, \r\n  199, 498 S.E.2d 642, 647 (1998); State v. Freeman, 319 S.C. 110, 122, \r\n  459 S.E.2d 867, 874 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nThe circuit court judge determined, because the return did not \r\n  address whether an objection was made to the reading of the statement, a conclusion \r\n  by the court that no objection had been made would involve speculation by the \r\n  court.Â  However, a conclusion that such an objection was made is equally speculative.Â  \r\n  Here, the only record from the trial level in this case is the magistrateâ€™s \r\n  return.Â  There is simply no evidence of record that Cunningham objected to the \r\n  admission of the evidence at the trial level or that it was in any manner raised \r\n  to or ruled upon by the magistrate.Â  See Roche v. S.C. Alcoholic Beverage \r\n  Control Commâ€™n, 263 S.C. 451, 455, 211 S.E.2d 243, 244 (1975) (the purpose \r\n  of an appeal is to determine whether the trial judge erroneously acted or failed \r\n  to act, and where the appellantâ€™s contentions are not presented or passed on \r\n  by the trial judge, such contentions should not be considered on appeal).Â  As \r\n  previously noted, in criminal appeals from magistrate court, the circuit court \r\n  may review only for preserved error.Â  Further, the magistrateâ€™s return is the \r\n  official record of the trial proceedings, and the circuit court, sitting in \r\n  an appellate capacity, is not allowed to consider any facts not included within \r\n  the return.Â  The return does not reflect any objection was made to the admission \r\n  of the evidence Cunningham challenges on appeal.Â  Because the record failed \r\n  to reflect the issue raised on appeal was raised to the trial court, we hold \r\n  the circuit court erred in reversing Cunninghamâ€™s conviction on that basis.Â  \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the circuit court order is reversed \r\n  and Cunninghamâ€™s conviction is reinstated.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n  1  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-616","title":"Cliffs at Keowee v.

Alexander, of Pickens, for Appellants.\r\nR. Murray Hughes, of Pickens, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Roger and Lynne Oâ€™Donald appeal the trial courtâ€™s order \r\n  granting a permanent injunction to The Cliffs at Keowee Community Association, \r\n  Inc.Â  The injunction prohibited the Oâ€™Donalds from constructing a home that \r\n  did not include a two-car garage as required by the subdivisionâ€™s restrictive \r\n  covenants.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1995, the Oâ€™Donalds purchased lot 27 at The Cliffs at Keowee, \r\n  a new residential subdivision located on Lake Keowee in Pickens County.Â  The \r\n  conveyance was subject to any and all restrictions attached to the property, \r\n  including the â€œDeclaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictionsâ€ established \r\n  by the Association.Â  The Association is the homeowners group for The Cliffs \r\n  at Keowee, and every lot owner is a member.Â  \r\nThe Covenants required the approval of all proposed structures by \r\n  the appropriate committee before beginning construction.Â  Further, the Covenants \r\n  expressly provided that the approval of any proposed plan would not constitute \r\n  a waiver of the right to withhold approval of any similar proposals or plans \r\n  subsequently or additionally submitted for review.Â  \r\nArticle XI of the Covenants, entitled â€œArchitectural Standards,â€ provides in \r\n  paragraph 11.8(c) that all homes are required to have two-car garages:Â  â€œAn \r\n  attached, semi-detached, free-standing or basement level two-car garage[] shall \r\n  be required for each dwelling or residence.â€Â \r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the developer originally retained responsibility for enforcement \r\n  of the Covenants, it transferred this duty to the Associationâ€™s Architectural \r\n  Review Board (ARB) in May of 2000.Â  The Covenants required that the ARB consist \r\n  of three members to be duly constituted.Â Â Â  \r\nIn 2001, the Oâ€™Donalds sought approval from the ARB for plans to \r\n  build a home on their lot, but the request was rejected because the plans did \r\n  not include a two-car garage.Â  The Oâ€™Donalds subsequently proceeded with construction \r\n  without the ARBâ€™s approval.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Association filed suit against the Oâ€™Donalds requesting temporary and permanent \r\n  injunctions to stop construction of the home.Â  The Oâ€™Donalds answered and filed \r\n  counterclaims seeking, among other things, a declaration that the Covenants \r\n  were not enforceable.Â  They also filed a third-party complaint against individual \r\n  ARB members.Â  \r\nIn December of 2001, Judge Henry Floyd granted a temporary injunction prohibiting \r\n  further construction pending a hearing on the merits.Â  By consent of the parties, \r\n  the matter was referred to a special referee, who, after the final hearing, \r\n  granted a permanent injunction to the Association in May of 2003 and denied \r\n  the relief requested by the Oâ€™Donalds.Â  The Oâ€™Donalds filed a motion to alter \r\n  or amend the judgment, which was denied.Â  The Oâ€™Donalds appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by means of an injunction \r\n  is in equity.Â  Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 498 S.E.2d 862 (1998).Â  \r\n  On appeal of an equitable action tried by a judge alone, this Court may find \r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\n  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).Â  \r\n  This broad scope of review does not, however, require an appellate court to \r\n  disregard the findings of the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses and \r\n  was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Widman \r\n  v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 557 S.E.2d 693 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Changed Conditions\r\nThe Oâ€™Donalds first contend the trial court erred in finding the \r\n  subdivision had not been radically and substantially changed so as to make the \r\n  Covenants unenforceable.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder South Carolina law, restrictive covenants can be deemed unenforceable \r\n  where there has been a change of conditions.Â  Inabinet v. Booe, 262 S.C. \r\n  81, 202 S.E.2d 643 (1974).Â  Although there is no hard and fast rule as to what \r\n  constitutes a change of conditions, generally the character of a neighborhood \r\n  must have been radically and substantially altered so as to practically destroy \r\n  the essential objects and purposes of the restrictive covenants.Â  Id. \r\n  at 84, 202 S.E.2d at 645 (citing Pitts v. Brown, 215 S.C. 122, 54 S.E.2d \r\n  538 (1949)).Â  The party seeking to avoid enforcement of the restrictions has \r\n  the burden of proving a change of conditions.Â  Id.Â  \r\nTo support their argument, the Oâ€™Donalds point to several violations \r\n  of the Covenants, such as the fact that three homes were built without two-car \r\n  garages.Â  As noted by the trial court, two of the homes were built without garages \r\n  when the developer retained enforcement power and there are no records as to \r\n  whether or not these homeowners received approval before building their homes.Â  \r\n  Once the ARB was aware of violations following its takeover of enforcement, \r\n  it wrote letters to the homeowners requesting compliance with the Covenants \r\n  or proof that the developer had approved the plans.Â  The Association is currently \r\n  working with these homeowners to resolve the violations.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Oâ€™Donalds also suggest that a two-car, in-line garage in the neighborhood \r\n  was a radical and substantial change from the Covenants that altered the character \r\n  of the subdivision.Â  The homeowners with that garage, however, followed the \r\n  Associationâ€™s process for seeking approval and worked closely with the ARB.Â  \r\n  The ARB eventually approved the two-car, in-line garage because the unique nature \r\n  of the homeownersâ€™ property justified a variance.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOther violations alleged by the Oâ€™Donalds, such as the lack of requisite \r\n  square footage, the lack of paved walkways, the docking of a houseboat on one \r\n  of the lots, and the use of plywood siding, also first occurred when the developer \r\n  had the responsibility of enforcing the Covenants.Â  As William Mahoney, chairman \r\n  of the ARB, testified, â€œall of the plans that [the ARB has] approved since . \r\n  . . July 15, 2000 meet the requirements.â€Â  In addition, the ARB sent compliance \r\n  request letters to the homeowners, and timetables have been set to bring violators \r\n  into compliance.Â  Although some violations do exist in the subdivision, we agree \r\n  with the trial courtâ€™s ruling that they have not fundamentally changed the residential \r\n  character of the neighborhood so as to make the Covenants unenforceable.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nII.Â  Waiver and Estoppel\r\nThe Oâ€™Donalds assert the trial court erred in holding the Association \r\n  neither waived nor is estopped from asserting its right to enforce the Covenants \r\n  because it failed to object to past violations.\r\nâ€œA waiver is a voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment \r\n  of a known right.â€Â  Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Prop. Regime, \r\n  307 S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1992).Â  â€œGenerally, the party claiming \r\n  waiver must show that the party against whom waiver is asserted possessed, at \r\n  the time, actual or constructive knowledge of his rights or of all the material \r\n  facts upon which they depended.â€Â  Id. at 344, 415 S.E.2d at 387-88.Â  \r\n  Further, a partyâ€™s waiver of the right to object to a minor violation of a restrictive \r\n  covenant does not result in waiver of his right to object to a subsequent and \r\n  more substantial violation.Â  Gibbs v. Kimbrell, 311 S.C. 261, 268, 428 \r\n  S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nAs noted above, when the ARB took over enforcement of the Covenants, \r\n  the violations complained of by the Oâ€™Donalds were already in existence.Â  Once \r\n  the ARB learned of the violations, it began the process of bringing those homeowners \r\n  into compliance.Â  The only variance granted by the ARB was for the two-car, \r\n  in-line garage, which was properly approved as required by the Covenants.Â  Moreover, \r\n  the Covenants themselves provide that the granting of a variance does not prevent \r\n  the future enforcement of those restrictions on a homeowner.Â  Thus, we agree \r\n  with the trial court that the Association did not make a voluntary and intentional \r\n  waiver of its right to enforce the Covenants.\r\nThe Oâ€™Donalds also argue that the Association is estopped from enforcing \r\n  the Covenants because it has permitted multiple violations by other homeowners \r\n  without protest.Â  \r\nâ€œEstoppel arises when a party, relying upon what another has said \r\n  or done, changes his position to his detriment.â€Â  Gibbs, 311 S.C. at \r\n  268, 428 S.E.2d at 729.Â  â€œAdditionally, estoppel arises when a party observes \r\n  another dealing with his property in a manner inconsistent with his rights and \r\n  makes no objection while the other changes his position in reliance on the partyâ€™s \r\n  silence; the partyâ€™s silence is acquiescence that estops him from later seeking \r\n  relief.â€Â  Id.\r\nOur review of the record reveals no evidence to suggest that the \r\n  Oâ€™Donalds changed their position in reliance upon the words, actions, or acquiescence \r\n  of the Association.Â  Despite the ARBâ€™s insistence that it intended to enforce \r\n  the Covenants, the Oâ€™Donalds began construction of their home and continued \r\n  until the circuit court issued a temporary injunction against them.Â  The Oâ€™Donalds \r\n  knew they did not have ARB approval, but violated the Covenants and began construction \r\n  anyway.Â  Accordingly, we hold the Association is not estopped from enforcing \r\n  the Covenants.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Composition of the ARB\r\nThe Oâ€™Donalds claim the trial court erred in finding the ARB had \r\n  sufficient authority to enforce the Covenants.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Oâ€™Donalds assert the Covenants require the ARB to consist of at least three \r\n  members.Â  Although their meeting minutes refer only to two members, we conclude \r\n  there is evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s finding that the ARB as then \r\n  constituted had sufficient authority to enforce the restrictions when the Oâ€™Donalds \r\n  sought approval of their construction plans.Â  \r\nWilliam Mahoney, Richard Kraince, and William Carruthers, Jr. all testified \r\n  that they were members of the ARB, with Mr. Mahoney being the chairman.Â  The \r\n  minutes expressly reflect that at least two of the above, Mr. Mahoney and Mr. \r\n  Carruthers, served on the ARB.Â  The minutes also show that any member wishing \r\n  to serve on the ARB could simply contact Mr. Mahoney.Â  Mr. Kraince testified \r\n  he was also on the committee as a volunteer member.Â  Mr. Mahoney confirmed that \r\n  Mr. Kraince was a member of the committee, although his name was not specifically \r\n  listed in the minutes in that capacity.Â  Mr. Mahoney stated that the same minutes, \r\n  which failed to list Mr. Kraince, also failed to reflect that the Oâ€™Donalds \r\n  had attended the board meeting, so the minutes were incomplete.Â  \r\nIn any case, we note the Oâ€™Donalds could have immediately challenged the composition \r\n  of the ARB and thus its power to enforce the Covenants.Â  Instead, they elected \r\n  to build without first obtaining approval from the ARB; consequently, we find \r\n  no error in this regard.Â  \r\nIV.Â  Damages\r\nThe Oâ€™Donalds lastly claim the trial court erred in failing to award \r\n  actual and punitive damages.Â  \r\nAn argument is deemed abandoned on appeal if it is argued in a short, \r\n  conclusory statement without supporting authority.Â  Fields v.

McFarland, all of Columbia; and Solicitor \r\n  John Gregory Hembree, of Conway; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  William Joseph Blom appeals his murder conviction, arguing \r\n  the trial court erred in refusing his requested jury charge on circumstantial \r\n  evidence.Â  We affirm.  [1] \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nLance Neal was at a bar with friends when he received a phone call.Â  When the \r\n  call ended, he said it was from Blom.Â  Neal said he was going out behind a nearby \r\n  restaurant to have a â€œman on man fightâ€ with Blom over Bronna Miller, Blomâ€™s \r\n  girlfriend and the mother of Nealâ€™s child.Â  One of Nealâ€™s friends tried unsuccessfully \r\n  to dissuade him, noting Blom owned a gun. Â Outside, Neal was seen sitting \r\n  in a car with Blom.Â  The two then got out of the car and were talking.Â  One \r\n  State witness testified the two tussled.Â  Witnesses then heard several shots \r\n  and saw Neal run away and Blom drive away.Â  Another bystander saw Neal running \r\n  after the shots were fired and saw him collapse. Â One of Nealâ€™s friends \r\n  ran down and found him lying in a pool of blood. Â Neal died as a result \r\n  of a gunshot wound to the chest. \r\nAfter the shooting, an officer looking for Blomâ€™s car encountered \r\n  John Poston, who said he had seen a man driving a car fitting that description.Â  \r\n  Poston said the man stopped the car, got out, squatted down, and extended his \r\n  hand into some brush on the side of the road.Â  Poston showed the officer the \r\n  location, and police found a gun there, hidden under some pine straw.Â  \r\nThe defense asserted Blom shot Neal in self-defense.Â  The \r\n  defense introduced testimony that Neal was threatening Blom at the scene, that \r\n  Neal had been drinking and was a mean drunk, and that he liked to fight and \r\n  had a reputation for violence and aggression.Â  Blom, in contrast, was a â€œperfect \r\n  gentleman.â€Â  The defense also offered evidence that during the incident, Blomâ€™s \r\n  shirt was torn, his necklace was broken and ripped off, and his body was bruised \r\n  and scratched.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBlom argues the trial court erred in refusing to issue the State \r\n  v. Edwards circumstantial evidence instruction.Â  He contends because there \r\n  was only circumstantial evidence of the exact nature of the confrontation and \r\n  murder, voluntary manslaughter, and self-defense were jury options, the court \r\n  should have instructed the jury that it could find him guilty of murder only \r\n  if the evidence pointed conclusively to his guilt to the exclusion of every \r\n  other reasonable hypothesis.Â  We find no error.\r\nThe evidence presented at trial determines the law to be charged \r\n  to the jury.Â  State v. Taylor, 356 S.C. 227, 231, 589 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2003).Â  \r\n  The trial court is only required to charge the current and correct law and a \r\n  charge that correctly defines the law when read as a whole is proper.Â  State \r\n  v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 302 (2002).\r\nHere, Blom does not dispute the charge issued is essentially the \r\n  one announced and recommended by our supreme court in State v. Grippon, \r\n  327 S.C. 79, 489 S.E.2d 462 (1997).Â  At trial Blom requested the traditional \r\n  circumstantial charge from State v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d \r\n  888 (1989) and State v. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 89 S.E.2d 924 (1955).Â  \r\n  Specifically, he wanted the language that all of the circumstances when taken \r\n  together must â€œpoint conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion \r\n  of every other reasonable hypothesis.â€Â  Edwards, 298 S.C. at 275, 379 \r\n  S.E.2d at 889.Â  On appeal, he argues that because of the abundance of evidence \r\n  of a confrontation and the sketchy eyewitness accounts, the court should have \r\n  issued an Edwards instruction.Â  However, in Grippon, our supreme \r\n  court affirmed a trial courtâ€™s refusal to charge the language in question.Â  \r\n  In Grippon, the appellant argued the trial courtâ€™s omission of the reasonable \r\n  hypothesis language impermissibly lowered the level of proof required for the \r\n  jury to find him guilty.Â  Although the trial court incorrectly believed the \r\n  language had been disapproved, the supreme court noted because the charge given \r\n  otherwise fully covered the law of circumstantial evidence and the trial court \r\n  correctly defined reasonable doubt, omission of the reasonable hypothesis language \r\n  did not affect the burden of proof.Â  Grippon, 327 S.C. at 82-83, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d at 463-64.Â  The supreme court then announced a new recommended charge, \r\n  which does not contain the â€œreasonable hypothesisâ€ language.Â  Id. at \r\n  83-84, 489 S.E.2d at 464.Â  Both the Grippon charge and the Edwards \r\n  charge were proper in South Carolina at the time of Blomâ€™s trial.Â  See \r\n  State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 155-56 &amp; n.13, 508 S.E.2d 857, 868 \r\n  &amp; n.13 (1998). [2] Â  Because \r\n  the trial court here charged the jury with an approved circumstantial evidence \r\n  charge and, as in Grippon, correctly defined reasonable doubt, we find \r\n  no error.Â  State v. Manning, 305 S.C. 413, 417, 409 S.E.2d 372, 375 (1991) \r\n  (announcing recommended reasonable doubt instruction), abrogation in part \r\n  on other grounds recognized by Todd v.

[2] \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nBarrs was indicted on three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct \r\n  with a minor for allegedly molesting the daughter of a couple he was living \r\n  with.Â  Pursuant to a plea agreement with the State, he entered an Alford \r\n  plea to committing a lewd act on a minor and the State nol prossed the remaining \r\n  CSC indictments.Â  The trial judge sentenced him to ninety days, with credit \r\n  for time served while awaiting trial.Â  \r\nDISCUSSIONÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nExcept for certain minor offenses, the circuit court does not have subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to hear a guilty plea unless there has been an indictment, \r\n  a waiver of presentment to the grand jury, or unless the charge is a lesser-included \r\n  offense of the crime charged in the indictment.Â  Hopkins v. State, 317 \r\n  S.C. 7, 9, 451 S.E.2d 389, 390 (1994); see also Odom v. State, \r\n  350 S.C. 300, 302, 566 S.E.2d 528, 529 (2002) (â€œIn the absence of an indictment, \r\n  there must be a valid waiver of presentment for the trial court to have subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction of the offense.â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-10 (2003).Â  Lack \r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived, and may be raised at any time, \r\n  including on the courtâ€™s own motion.Â  Campbell v. State, 342 S.C. 100, \r\n  101-02, 535 S.E.2d 928, 929 (2000).\r\nThe grand jury never indicted Barrs for the lewd act charge and Barrs did not \r\n  waive presentment to the grand jury.Â  Committing a lewd act on a minor is not \r\n  a lesser-included offense of first-degree criminal sexual conduct on a minor.Â  \r\n  Id.; see also S.C.

Savitz, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry \r\n  Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, and Assistant \r\n  Attorney General David Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, \r\n  of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Bruce Miller (Miller) appeals his conviction for armed \r\n  robbery.Â  We affirm. [1]   \r\nFACTS\r\nMiller was convicted of robbing James Holden (Holden) at gunpoint.Â  While on \r\n  his way to work, Holden stopped at a convenience store in Greenville to use \r\n  the phone.Â  A man Holden later identified as Miller asked him for directions \r\n  to the interstate.Â  After Holden gave Miller directions, Miller pointed a gun \r\n  at Holden and demanded money.Â  Holden surrendered $106, and Miller walked behind \r\n  the store, out of view.Â  Miller then drove by, and Holden followed him and recorded \r\n  his license plate number.Â  Several days later, Holden identified Miller as the \r\n  perpetrator from a photographic lineup.Â  Miller was indicted and convicted for \r\n  armed robbery.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMiller asserts two issues on appeal.Â  First, he argues the trial \r\n  court lacked subject matter jurisdiction due to an insufficient indictment.Â  \r\n  Second, he contends the trial court erred in failing to give his proposed jury \r\n  instruction on eyewitness testimony.Â  \r\nI.Â  Sufficiency of the Indictment\r\nMillerâ€™s indictment states:\r\n\r\nThat BRUCE RANDALL MILLER did in Greenville County, on or about the 9th day \r\n  of December, 2001, while armed with a deadly weapon, to wit: handgun, take by \r\n  means of force or intimidation, goods or monies described as: U.S. currency \r\n  from the person or presence of James Holden.Â  This is in violation of Â§16-11-330 \r\n  of the South Carolina Code of Laws (1976) as amended. \r\n\r\nA circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction if: (1) there has \r\n  been an indictment which sufficiently states the offense; (2) there has been \r\n  a waiver of the indictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser included charge of \r\n  the crime charged in the indictment.Â  Locke v. State, 341 S.C. 54, 533 \r\n  S.E.2d 324 (2000).Â  An indictment is sufficient to convey jurisdiction if it \r\n  states the offense with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the \r\n  court to know what judgment to pronounce and the defendant to know what he is \r\n  called upon to answer.Â  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 \r\n  (1998).Â  \r\nMiller complains the indictment is insufficient because it fails \r\n  â€œto allege intent of permanent deprivation or that the taking was done feloniously.â€Â  \r\n  Our supreme court has held:Â  â€œThere is no requirement that an armed robbery \r\n  indictment contain an allegation of an intent to permanently deprive the owner \r\n  of the property.â€Â  Broom v. State, 351 S.C. 219, 221, 569 S.E.2d 336, \r\n  337 (2002).Â  The Broom court found that â€œthe intent to permanently deprive \r\n  is . . . implicit in the definition of armed robbery.â€Â  Id.Â  The court \r\n  defined armed robbery as â€œa robbery while armed with a deadly weapon or while \r\n  the robber alleges, by actions or words, that he is armed with a deadly weapon \r\n  which a person during the commission of the robbery reasonably believes to be \r\n  a deadly weapon.â€Â  Id. at 220-21, 569 S.E.2d at 337 (citing S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A) (Supp. 2001)).Â Â  The definition does not include the word \r\n  â€œfeloniouslyâ€; therefore, feloniously is not required in the indictment.Â  Cf. \r\n  Joseph v. State, 351 S.C. 551, 571 S.E.2d 280 (2002) (finding indictment \r\n  for murder sufficient where it set forth the time, place, and manner of the \r\n  crime, but did not include the defendant â€œâ€˜feloniouslyâ€™ and â€˜wilfullyâ€™ committed \r\n  the murderâ€™â€ and holding â€œthe word â€˜feloniouslyâ€™ is encompassed in the word \r\n  â€˜murderâ€™ because murder is a felony.â€). \r\n Locke lends further support to the Stateâ€™s position that the \r\n  indictment does not need to include â€œfeloniouslyâ€ or â€œintent of permanent deprivation.â€Â  \r\n  In Locke, the supreme court found that â€œthe indictment alleges the substance \r\n  of asportation when it reads, â€˜taking of goods and/or monies from the person \r\n  or presence of.â€™â€Â  341 S.C. at 56, 533 S.E.2d at 325.Â  Millerâ€™s indictment alleged \r\n  that he did â€œtake by means of force or intimidation, goods or monies \r\n  described as: U.S. currency from the person or presence of James Holden.â€Â  \r\n  (Emphasis added).Â  Thus, the language of Millerâ€™s indictment was approved by \r\n  the court in Locke.Â  \r\nII.Â  Proposed Jury Charge\r\nMiller argues the trial court erred in failing to charge his requested instruction \r\n  on the accuracy of eyewitness identification.Â  The trial judge rejected Millerâ€™s \r\n  charge and instead gave the following charge:\r\n\r\nThe state alleges that the defendant, Mr. Miller, is the perpetrator of the \r\n  alleged crime charged.Â  The State has the burden of proving identity beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt.Â  Identification testimony is an expression of belief or \r\n  impression by a witness.Â  You may consider the opportunity a witness had to \r\n  observe the alleged offender at the time of the alleged offense and thereafter \r\n  make an identification.Â  It is for you to determine the accuracy of the identification \r\n  as given by the witness.Â  \r\nYou may consider the credibility of the identification witness as you do any \r\n  other witness.Â  You may consider his or her truthfulness as well as the capacity, \r\n  opportunity, and circumstances of the observation of the matters about which \r\n  he or she testified.Â  Remember the State has the burden of proving identity \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Therefore, if you find that a crime has been committed \r\n  as alleged, but you are not convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant \r\n  was the person who committed the crime, you must find the defendant not guilty.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n The jury charge Miller proposed was a Telfaire charge (United \r\n  States v. Telfaire, 469 F.2d 522 (D.C. Cir 1972)).Â  Contrary to Millerâ€™s \r\n  assertion that South Carolina has recognized the Telfaire charge as a \r\n  â€œmodel instruction,â€ our courts have rejected the Telfaire charge as \r\n  violative of the Constitution of South Carolina.Â  See State v. Patterson, \r\n  337 S.C. 215, 234, 522 S.E.2d 845, 855 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding the Telfaire \r\n  charge â€œis essentially a charge on the facts which is contrary to our constitutional \r\n  prohibition [S.C. Const. Art. V, Â§ 21] against charges to the juries on the \r\n  factsâ€); see also State v. Robinson, 274 S.C. 198, 262 \r\n  S.E.2d 729 (1980) (upholding trial courtâ€™s decision to decline the Telfaire \r\n  charge). \r\nA jury instruction is sufficient if, when considered as a whole, it covers \r\n  the law applicable to the case.Â  State v. Burton, 302 S.C. 494, 397 S.E.2d \r\n  90 (1990).Â  Here, the judgeâ€™s charge was sufficient.Â  As in State v.

[1] Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 2000, a Richland County grand jury indicted Bucky Mitchell on four \r\n  counts: two kidnapping charges and two charges of criminal sexual conduct with \r\n  a minor in the second degree.Â  Prior to opening statements at trial, Mitchell \r\n  entered a negotiated plea of guilty but mentally ill on a single count of criminal \r\n  sexual conduct with a minor and the State dismissed the other charges.Â  The \r\n  lower court accepted Mitchellâ€™s plea and sentenced him to seven years.Â  This \r\n  appeal follows.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMitchell argues that his guilty plea failed to comply with Boykin v. Alabama, \r\n  395 U.S. 238 (1969), which requires guilty pleas be voluntarily and intelligently \r\n  made.Â  We find that Mitchell failed to properly preserve the issue below.Â  Mitchell \r\n  made no objection at the plea proceeding.Â  Failure of a defendant to assert \r\n  that his guilty plea was not knowing and intelligent precludes consideration \r\n  of the issue on appeal.Â  State v.

Henrikson and Mary H. Abel, both of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Patricia Brenda Kiser appeals from the trial courtâ€™s grant \r\n  of summary judgment to the Charleston Lodge No. 242 of the Benevolent and Protective \r\n  Order of the Elks (the Elks) on her breach of contract claim.Â  We affirm.1Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Elks is a private club, which offers community and social events to its \r\n  members and guests.Â  After the Elks changed its policy and began to allow women \r\n  into its membership, several members of the Elks encouraged Kiser to apply for \r\n  membership.Â  The application process for the Elks involves a sponsor member \r\n  proposing the applicant and ensuring the applicant completes the application.Â  \r\n  The sponsoring member gives the application to the lodge secretary who reads \r\n  it before the lodge at a regular session.Â  The investigating committee then \r\n  reviews the application, conducts an investigation of the applicant, and interviews \r\n  the applicant.Â  After completing this process, the investigating committee returns \r\n  the application to the secretary with a favorable or unfavorable report.Â  If \r\n  the report is favorable, the secretary arranges for the publication of the applicantâ€™s \r\n  name in the monthly newsletter with the date on which the applicant is to be \r\n  voted on for membership.Â  At the membership vote, the applicant must receive \r\n  no less than two-thirds â€œyesâ€ votes.Â  If the applicant fails to receive the \r\n  required votes, the applicantâ€™s initiation fee and dues are returned and the \r\n  applicant must wait six months before being voted on again.Â  \r\nKiser completed the application process and received a favorable report from \r\n  the investigating committee.Â  However, she failed to receive the required two-thirds \r\n  vote to be accepted for membership.Â  After a request from the secretary of the \r\n  Elks, the Grand Exalted Ruler issued an executive order waiving the six-month \r\n  waiting period, allowing Kiser and another applicant to be voted on again.Â  \r\n  At the second balloting, Kiser again did not receive the required votes for \r\n  membership.Â  \r\nIn March of 2002, Kiser filed a breach of contract action \r\n  in circuit court claiming the Elks made an offer of membership to her by stating \r\n  the steps for application and membership.Â  Kiser claimed she accepted this offer \r\n  by complying with the required steps in the application process.Â  She asserted \r\n  the Elks breached this contract by denying her membership based on her sex.Â  \r\n  The Elks answered, denying the existence of a contract.Â  \r\nKiser served discovery requests to the Elks on June 7, 2002.Â  \r\n  On June 19, the Elks filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  On June 28, the Elksâ€™ \r\n  attorney requested a thirty-day extension for serving discovery responses, explaining \r\n  he had just received the requests, which had been mailed to his old firmâ€™s address.Â  \r\n  Kiser granted the request.Â  The Elks served its responses to Kiserâ€™s discovery \r\n  requests, which contained objections to some requests, on September 10, 2002.Â  \r\n  On September 20, the court issued an order denying the Elksâ€™ motion for summary \r\n  judgment based on Kiserâ€™s request for additional time to obtain discovery.Â  \r\n  The court granted leave for the Elks to renew its motion for summary judgment. \r\n  Â On March 31, 2003, Kiser filed a motion to compel discovery of some of her \r\n  interrogatories and requests for production.Â  Subsequently, the Elks filed a \r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nBoth motions were heard at the same hearing.Â  The court first \r\n  considered Kiserâ€™s motion to compel.Â  The court denied her requests to obtain \r\n  the names of other women who had applied for membership and not received the \r\n  requisite number of votes and the names of members who either voted on Kiser \r\n  or were members when Kiser came up for vote.Â  The court, however, did require \r\n  the Elks to produce its membership list, which the Elks had previously offered \r\n  to Kiser.Â  The court then considered the Elksâ€™ motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  After hearing the partiesâ€™ arguments, the court granted the Elksâ€™ motion for \r\n  summary judgment based on a finding that as a matter of law no contract existed \r\n  between the parties.Â  The courtâ€™s written order only addressed the grant of \r\n  summary judgment.Â  It did not mention the motion to compel.Â  This appeal followed. \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Osborne \r\n  v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  The evidence and all \r\n  reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to \r\n  the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  â€œIt is well established that summary judgment \r\n  should be granted â€˜. . . in cases in which plain, palpable and indisputable \r\n  facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ.â€™â€Â  Anders v. S.C. Farm \r\n  Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 307 S.C. 371, 373, 415 S.E.2d 406, 407 (Ct. App. 1992) \r\n  (quoting Main v. Corley, 281 S.C. 525, 526, 316 S.E.2d 406, 407 (1984)); \r\n  see Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 425, 529 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2000) \r\n  (stating where a verdict is not reasonably possible under the facts presented, \r\n  summary judgment is proper).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPrematurity of motion for summary judgment \r\n   \r\nKiser argues that she did not have a full and fair \r\n  opportunity to complete discovery because she was denied the opportunity to \r\n  obtain the membership list she requested, and that was required pursuant, to \r\n  her motion to compel. Â We disagree.\r\nSummary judgment is a drastic remedy and must not be \r\n  granted until the opposing party has had a full and fair opportunity to complete \r\n  discovery.Â  Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 112, 410 \r\n  S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991).Â  However, the nonmoving party must demonstrate the likelihood \r\n  that further discovery will uncover additional relevant evidence and that the \r\n  party is â€œnot merely engaged in a â€˜fishing expedition.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  at 112, \r\n  410 S.E.2d at 544.Â  See Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 71, 580 \r\n  S.E.2d 433, 439-40 (2003) (rejecting the plaintiffsâ€™ argument that summary judgment \r\n  was premature because they did not have a full and fair opportunity for discovery \r\n  by holding further discovery was unlikely to create any genuine issue of material \r\n  fact); Bayle v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 128-29, 542 \r\n  S.E.2d 736, 743 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating it was not error to grant summary judgment \r\n  because no further discovery would have contributed to the resolution of the \r\n  case).\r\n\r\n\r\nWe thus must determine whether the additional evidence \r\n  sought by Kiser was relevant to her breach of contract claim.Â  Kiser argues \r\n  on appeal that having the list of names of the current members was relevant \r\n  in proving her claim, but she fails to explain in her brief how the membership \r\n  list is relevant to proving she had a contract with the Elks or that it was \r\n  breached.Â  \r\nTo establish a contract, Kiser must prove three elements:Â  \r\n  an offer, acceptance, and consideration.Â  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., \r\n  354 S.C. 397, 405, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003).Â  In order to have a valid and \r\n  enforceable contract, there must be a meeting of the minds between the parties \r\n  with regard to all essential and material terms of the agreement.Â  Player \r\n  v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891, 893 (1989).Â  â€œThe â€˜meeting \r\n  of mindsâ€™ required to make a contract is not based on secret purpose or intention \r\n  on the part of one of the parties, stored away in his mind and not brought to \r\n  the attention of the other party, but must be based on purpose and intention \r\n  which has been made known or which, from all the circumstances, should be known.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  at 105, 382 S.E.2d at 894.Â  Without the actual agreement of the \r\n  parties, there is no contract, express or implied.Â  Stanley Smith &amp; Sons \r\n  v. Limestone College, 283 S.C. 430, 433, 322 S.E.2d 474, 477 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\n\r\nAs the trial court noted, Kiser admitted she was only \r\n  invited to apply for membership and undergo the voting process.Â  She acknowledged \r\n  that she knew when she went through the process there was a chance she would \r\n  be rejected by the voting membership and that no one guaranteed that simply \r\n  by applying she would become a member.Â  The trial court held, â€œThe [Elks] never \r\n  expressly or impliedly manifested an assent to the most essential and material \r\n  term, i.e., [Kiserâ€™s] Lodge membership as the result of a membership vote. . \r\n  . . [N]either the [Elksâ€™] words nor the application circumstances indicated \r\n  [Kiser] and the [Elks] had the necessary â€˜meeting of the mindsâ€™ to form a contract.â€Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn our examination, the record does not indicate, and \r\n  Kiser has not provided evidence to suggest otherwise, that the membership list \r\n  is relevant to establish the existence of an offer, acceptance, or consideration \r\n  or that a â€œmeeting of the mindsâ€ occurred.Â  When a party fails to establish \r\n  the existence of an element essential to the partyâ€™s case upon which that party \r\n  will bear the burden of proof at trial, â€œthere can be â€˜no genuine issue as to \r\n  any material factâ€™ since a complete failure of proof concerning an essential \r\n  element of the nonmoving partyâ€™s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.â€Â  \r\n  Baughman, 306 S.C. at 116, 410 S.E.2d at 546.Â  Thus, as Kiser has failed \r\n  to demonstrate that further discovery will likely uncover additional evidence \r\n  relevant to her breach of contract claim, we find the trial court did not err \r\n  in granting the Elksâ€™ summary judgment. \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nGrant of summary judgment following the grant of a motion to compel \r\n   \r\nKiser argues that the trial court erred in granting \r\n  the Elksâ€™ motion for summary judgment immediately after granting Kiserâ€™s motion \r\n  to compel.Â  Although at the hearing Kiser argued the motion was not ripe because \r\n  adequate discovery had not been completed, she did not specifically argue the \r\n  trial court should not grant the motion because it had just granted her the \r\n  right to further discovery.Â  She furthermore failed to raise this argument in \r\n  a Rule 59, SCRCP, motion when the order granting summary judgment did not even \r\n  address the motion to compel.Â  Accordingly, we find this argument not preserved \r\n  for our review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 \r\n  S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for \r\n  the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the \r\n  trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); Noisette v. Ismail, \r\n  304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (finding issue was not preserved \r\n  for appellate review where the trial judge did not explicitly rule on the appellantâ€™s \r\n  argument and the appellant made no Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment).Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on our findings, the trial court did \r\n  not err in granting summary judgment to the Elks on Kiserâ€™s breach of contract \r\n  claim. Accordingly, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  1We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-631","title":"Ridgeway v.

Michael Baxley, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-631\r\nHeard October 12, 2004 â€“ Filed December \r\n  15, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJoseph C. Wilson, IV, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nSaulÂ  Gliserman, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:&nbsp; The Litchfield Company of South Carolina Limited \r\n  Partnership (Litchfield) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s denial of its motion to \r\n  compel arbitration.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe relevant facts are not in dispute.Â  On September 18, 1999, Lawrence \r\n  M. Ridgeway, as grantee, entered into a purchase agreement with Heritage-Litchfield, \r\n  Inc., as grantor, to purchase condominium unit 20-101 in the Avian Forest development \r\n  in Georgetown. [1] Â  The purchase agreement contained \r\n  an arbitration clause, which provided as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\nARBITRATIONÂ  In the event that a dispute or claim shall arise with respect \r\n  to any of the terms or provisions of this Master Deed, or a dispute between \r\n  the Grantor or any contractors employed by the Grantor, and any one or \r\n  more Unit Owners, such claims to include but not be limited to claims for \r\n  negligent or improper construction, failure to meet specifications, and other \r\n  claims related to structural improvements, all disputes or claims shall \r\n  be resolved by Binding Arbitration pursuant to Title 15, Chapter 48 (Uniform \r\n  Arbitration Act) of the Code of Laws of South Carolina.Â  All resulting awards \r\n  and determinations made by the arbitrators pursuant to the provisions of this \r\n  section shall be conclusively binding upon all parties hereto and judgment may \r\n  be rendered thereon.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  Litchfield was involved with the sale of the unit \r\n  solely as the real estate broker for Heritage-Litchfield and marketing company \r\n  for the Avian Forest development.Â  \r\nShortly after purchasing unit 20-101, Ridgeway discovered \r\n  that the unit was infested with toxic mold.Â  Ridgeway asserted the mold rendered \r\n  the unit uninhabitable.Â  Ridgeway further asserted that the development lacked \r\n  several promised amenities and the grounds contained several abandoned or derelict \r\n  buildings.Â  According to Ridgeway, the mold infestation and other deficiencies \r\n  have rendered the unit â€œwithout meaningful market value.â€ \r\nRidgeway \r\n  instituted an action against Litchfield alleging that he would not have purchased \r\n  the Avian Forest unit but for the tortious conduct of Litchfield, which caused \r\n  Ridgeway to believe that Litchfield, as opposed to Heritage-Litchfield, was \r\n  the developer of the Avian Forest project.Â  Ridgeway asserted causes of action \r\n  arising from the marketing and promotion of Avian Forest, including unfair trade \r\n  practices, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, fraud, promissory \r\n  estoppel, and civil conspiracy.Â  Litchfield filed an answer and motion to compel \r\n  arbitration based upon the arbitration clause in the purchase agreement entered \r\n  into by Heritage-Litchfield and Ridgeway.Â  Litchfield concedes that it was neither \r\n  a party nor a signatory to the purchase agreement or arbitration clause. [2] Â  The circuit court denied Litchfieldâ€™s \r\n  motion to compel arbitration.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&nbsp;â€œWhether a claim is subject to arbitration is an issue for judicial \r\n  determination, unless the parties have agreed otherwise.â€Â  Vestry and Church \r\n  Wardens of Holy Cross v.

App. 2003) (citation omitted).Â  In deciding whether the \r\n  parties have agreed to submit a particular grievance to arbitration, the court \r\n  should not rule on the merits of the underlying claims.Â  Zabinski v. Bright \r\n  Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001).Â  â€œA motion \r\n  to compel arbitration made pursuant to an arbitration clause in a written contract \r\n  should only be denied where the clause is not susceptible to any interpretation \r\n  which would cover the asserted dispute.â€Â  Id.\r\n&nbsp;â€œDeterminations of arbitrability are subject to de novo review.â€Â  \r\n  Vestry and Church Wardens of Holy Cross, 356 S.C. at 207, 588 S.E.2d \r\n  at 138.Â  However, the factual findings of the trial court will be overruled \r\n  only if there is no evidence reasonably supporting them.Â  Deloitte &amp; \r\n  Touche, LLP v.

App. 2000).Â  Therefore, a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration \r\n  any dispute that he has not agreed to arbitrate.Â  See United Steelworkers \r\n  of Am. v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 582 (1960); Zabinski, \r\n  346 S.C. at 580, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  There is strong state and federal public \r\n  policy favoring arbitration agreements; however, such agreements must not be \r\n  so broadly construed as to encompass claims and parties that were not intended \r\n  by the original contract.Â  See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, \r\n  Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 626 (1985); Towles v. United Healthcare Corp., \r\n  338 S.C. 29, 37, 524 S.E.2d 839, 844 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, â€œarbitration \r\n  rests on the agreement of the parties, and the range of issues that can be arbitrated \r\n  is restricted by the terms of the agreement.â€Â  Zabinksi, 346 S.C. at \r\n  596-597, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  â€œIn determining whether an agreement to arbitrate \r\n  exists, â€˜the court should apply ordinary state-law principles that govern the \r\n  formation of contracts.â€™â€Â  Towles, 338 S.C. at 37, 524 S.E.2d at 844 \r\n  (citation omitted).Â  \r\nLitchfield argues the trial judge erred in refusing to compel arbitration \r\n  because, despite its lack of contractual relationship with Ridgeway, it can \r\n  compel arbitration: (1) as a â€œcontractorâ€ under the arbitration clause of the \r\n  purchase agreement, and (2) as an agent of Heritage-Litchfield.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â \r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLitchfield is a not â€œcontractorâ€ as intended by the arbitration clause. \r\n   \r\nThe arbitration clause of the purchase agreement provides for arbitration \r\n  of disputes between â€œany contractors employed by the Grantor, and any one or \r\n  more Unit Owners, such claims to include but not be limited to claims for negligent \r\n  or improper construction, failure to meet specifications, and other claims related \r\n  to structural improvements.â€Â  Litchfield asserts that the term â€œcontractor,â€ \r\n  according to Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1979), is â€œstrictly applicable \r\n  to any person who enters into a contract, but is commonly reserved to designate \r\n  one who, for a fixed price, undertakes to procure the performance of works or \r\n  services on a large scale. . . .â€ [3] Â Â  Litchfield contends that it is a contractor \r\n  by definition and therefore entitled to compel Ridgeway to arbitrate its dispute.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court that the definition of contractor asserted \r\n  by Litchfield is correct in the broadest sense of the term, but that it is not \r\n  the definition intended by the parties in the arbitration clause.Â Â Â  â€œThe construction \r\n  of a clear and unambiguous contract is a question of law for the court.â€Â  Hawkins \r\n  v. Greenwood Dev. Corp.&nbsp; 328 S.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997) (citation omitted).Â  â€œWhether a contract is ambiguous is to be determined \r\n  from the entire contract and not from isolated portions of the contract.â€ Farr \r\n  v. Duke Power Co.&nbsp; 265 S.C. 356, 362, 218 S.E.2d 431, 433&nbsp;(1975) \r\n  (citation omitted).Â  â€œCommon sense and good faith are the leading touchstones \r\n  of the inquiry.â€Â  Id. at 362, 218 S.E.2d at 434.\r\nIt is \r\n  clear, considering the purchase agreement as a whole, that the term â€œcontractorâ€ \r\n  found in the arbitration clause was intended to include only those parties to \r\n  a contract responsible for furnishing labor and materials for the construction \r\n  of Ridgewayâ€™s condominium unit.Â  The entire body of the purchase agreement concerned \r\n  only the sale of an Avian Forest condominium unit, and the agreement stated \r\n  that Heritage-Litchfield â€œshall cause the Property to be constructed substantially \r\n  in accordance with the Plan and Specifications previously reviewed by the purchaser \r\n  . . . .â€Â  The arbitration clause lists the types of disputes between Ridgeway \r\n  and contractors to include â€œbut not be limited to claims for negligent or improper \r\n  construction, failure to meet specifications, and other claims related to structural \r\n  improvements . . . .â€Â  The purchase agreement did not contemplate any other \r\n  type of contractor besides those responsible for furnishing labor and materials \r\n  for construction.Â  Therefore, Litchfield cannot enforce the arbitration clause \r\n  as a contractor because it did not furnish labor or materials for construction.Â  \r\n\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Litchfield cannot compel arbitration solely as an agent of Heritage-Litchfield.\r\nLitchfield \r\n  argues that under the principles of agency, a non-signatory may invoke an arbitration \r\n  clause as an agent of the signatory. South Carolina courts have yet to address \r\n  the issue of whether a non-signatory can invoke an arbitration clause solely \r\n  as an agent of the signatory.Â  \r\nLitchfield cites South Carolina Public Service Authority v. Great \r\n  Western Coal, Inc., 312 S.C. 559, 437 S.E.2d 22 (1993) in support of the \r\n  proposition that South Carolina allows non-signatories to an arbitration agreement \r\n  to compel arbitration against a signatory.Â  In Great Western Coal, the \r\n  South Carolina Public Service Authority contracted with Great Western Coal, \r\n  including an agreement to arbitrate.Â  The Public Service Authority initiated \r\n  an action against Great Western Coal and its president, Clyde E. Goings, in \r\n  his individual capacity.Â  The court held Goings was entitled to demand arbitration \r\n  of the Public Service Authorityâ€™s claims even though he did not sign the arbitration \r\n  clause.Â  Great Western Coal relies on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals \r\n  in Arnold v. Arnold Corp., 920 F.2d 1269 (6th Cir. 1990) for this proposition, \r\n  stating:Â Â  â€œ[A] party should not be allowed to avoid an arbitration agreement \r\n  by naming nonsignatory parties in his complaint, or signatory parties in \r\n  their individual capacity because this would nullify the rule requiring \r\n  arbitration.â€ Id. at 563, 437 S.E.2d at 24-25 (emphasis in original). \r\n  Thus, Great Western Coal permits only non-signatories who are alter egos \r\n  of a signatory to compel arbitration.Â  In this case, Litchfield cannot compel \r\n  arbitration because it is not an alter ego of the signatory, Heritage-Litchfield, \r\n  Inc.Â  \r\nMoreover, the other jurisdictions that allow a non-signatory to compel \r\n  arbitration under the agency theory have done so only in instances where the \r\n  action against the agent is within the scope of the arbitration agreement as \r\n  contemplated by the signing parties.Â  See, e.g., Long v. Silver, \r\n  248 F.3d 309, 320-21 (4th Cir. 2001) (holding non-signatory could compel arbitration \r\n  because the claims against the non-signatory parent corporation fell within \r\n  the scope of the arbitration clause signed by the employee); Sunkist Soft \r\n  Drinks, Inc. v. Sunkist Growers, Inc., 10 F.3d 753, 758 (11th Cir. 1993) \r\n  (holding that because claims against the non-signatory were â€œintimately founded \r\n  in and intertwined withâ€ a contract containing an arbitration clause, signatory \r\n  was estopped from refusing to arbitrate those claims); J.J. Ryan &amp; Sons, \r\n  Inc. v. Rhone Poulenc Textile, S.A., 863 F.2d 315, 320-21 (4th Cir. 1988) \r\n  (holding that â€œwhen allegations against a parent company and its subsidiary \r\n  are based on the same facts and are inherently inseparable, a court may refer \r\n  claims against the parent to arbitration even though the parent is not formally \r\n  a party to the arbitration agreementâ€); Norcom Elecs. Corp. v. CIM USA Inc., \r\n  104 F.Supp.2d 198, 203 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (quoting Smith/Enron Cogeneration \r\n  Ltd. Pâ€™ship. v. Smith Cogeneration Int'l, Inc., 198 F.3d 88, 97-98 (2d Cir. \r\n  1999)) (â€œ[T]he U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and other circuits \r\n  â€˜have been willing to estop a signatory from avoiding arbitration with a nonsignatory \r\n  when the issues the nonsignatory is seeking to resolve in arbitration are intertwined \r\n  with the agreement that the estopped party has signed.â€™â€); First American \r\n  Title Ins. Corp. v. Silvernell,&nbsp; 744 So.2d 883, 887-88&nbsp;(Ala. 1999) \r\n  (holding that non-signatory real estate agent had no right to compel arbitration \r\n  of purchasersâ€™ claim of conspiracy by agents because the arbitration clause \r\n  defined arbitrable matters as controversies between the insurer and the insured \r\n  purchaser, and the insurer was not part of the conspiracy).\r\nIn this case, the arbitration clause applies to disputes between Ridgeway \r\n  and contractors responsible for furnishing labor and materials for construction.Â  \r\n  Thus, Ridgewayâ€™s claims for unfair trade practices, negligent misrepresentation, \r\n  constructive fraud, fraud, promissory estoppel, and civil conspiracy against \r\n  Litchfield would not fall within the scope of the arbitration clause.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  even if we were to apply an agency theory to allow a non-signatory to enforce \r\n  an arbitration clause, Litchfield would not be permitted to compel arbitration \r\n  because Ridgewayâ€™s causes of action do not fall within the scope of the arbitration \r\n  clause. The order of the circuit court refusing to compel arbitration is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Heritage-Litchfield has declared bankruptcy.Â  \r\n    There is on-going separate litigation between Ridgeway and the Heritage-Litchfield \r\n    insurers.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Subsequent to oral argument, the court received \r\n    correspondence from counsel for Ridgeway stating for the first time that an \r\n    agent of Litchfield was a signatory to the purchase agreement and therefore \r\n    the arbitration clause.Â  Contrarily, both parties asserted the exact opposite \r\n    in front of the trial judge and in their briefs on appealâ€“that Litchfield \r\n    was a non-signatory to the purchase agreement.Â  Despite the revelations of \r\n    counsel for Ridgeway following oral argument, we are bound by the record on \r\n    appeal.Â  Rule 210(a), SCACR.Â  Because the record on appeal conclusively determines \r\n    that Litchfield was a non-signatory to the purchase agreement and arbitration \r\n    clause for purposes of our review, we must treat Litchfield as such.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  We note that this definition has been amended \r\n    to read â€œ1. A party to a contract. 2.

[1]  Â Â \r\n FACTS&nbsp;\r\n  On January 30, 2002, at approximately 9:30 p.m. in \r\n    Knightsville, South Carolina, Ford and a friend, John Long, were riding in \r\n    a sport utility vehicle with the headlights off.Â  Long was driving the vehicle.Â  \r\n    Deputy Randy Botten was traveling in the opposite direction when the vehicle \r\n    ran him off the road.Â  Botten turned his car around and activated his blue \r\n    lights to conduct a traffic stop.Â  The vehicle did not stop and instead increased \r\n    its speed to about 80 to 85 miles per hour.Â  Botten followed the vehicle until \r\n    it turned into a driveway on Central Avenue, near Orangeburg Road, and stopped \r\n    behind a shed.Â  Ford and Long jumped out of the vehicle and fled.Â  Area residents \r\n    found Long in a yard behind the Countryside Mobile Home Park and he was arrested.Â  \r\n    Ford ran to Elaine Mizellâ€™s house on the corner of Central Avenue and Orangeburg \r\n    Road and stole her brown 1982 Toyota truck.Â  At 10:47 p.m., a trooper spotted \r\n    Ford driving Mizellâ€™s truck with the headlights off and traveling 85 miles \r\n    per hour in a 25 mile an hour zone.Â  \r\n  At approximately 9:50 p.m., at 953 Orangeburg Road, \r\n    the home of David and Jennifer Stover, a man entered their house and carried \r\n    their daughter, Trinity, outside.Â  David thought the man was his wife, so \r\n    he went outside to see if she needed help carrying groceries into the house.Â  \r\n    Once outside, David did not see his wifeâ€™s car, but did notice that the interior \r\n    light was on inside his Mustang.Â  David then heard Trinity screaming and saw \r\n    her with a white male.Â  The man tried to run, but fell over a picnic table \r\n    and dropped Trinity.Â  The man then ran towards the woods.Â  David called 911 \r\n    and his brother-in-law, Donald Short.Â  \r\n  As Deputy Joli Murray was responding to Davidâ€™s 911 \r\n    call, a small brown pickup truck drove out of the Countryside Mobile Home \r\n    Park and nearly hit her car head-on.Â  She testified the truck was driving \r\n    erratically.Â  Short also drove to the Stoversâ€™ house after receiving the phone \r\n    call from David.Â  After leaving the Stoversâ€™ house, Short drove around looking \r\n    for a white male and noticed a white male standing next to a small dark Toyota \r\n    truck, looking toward the Stoversâ€™ residence.Â  When he turned in to ask the \r\n    man what he was doing, the man jumped into the truck.Â  Short backed into the \r\n    truck to stop it, but the truck managed to escape.Â  Short then followed the \r\n    truck, which did not have its headlights on and was traveling at about 80 \r\n    miles per hour.Â  Trooper Curtis Burns also pursued the truck until it pulled \r\n    into a yard.Â  The driver exited the truck and ran into the woods.Â  Burns followed \r\n    the man, who was identified as Ford, and caught him in the woods.Â  The truck \r\n    belonged to Mizell.Â  While Ford was at the detention center he took a breathalyzer \r\n    test, which determined he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of \r\n    the collision. \r\n  The police found footprint impressions in the Mizellâ€™s \r\n    and the Stoversâ€™ yards, so officers took Fordâ€™s boots from him at the detention \r\n    center for evidence.Â  The impressions were consistent with the general design \r\n    of Fordâ€™s bootâ€™s outsole.Â  SLED Agent Steven Derrick testified Fordâ€™s boots \r\n    or another boot with the same combined class characteristics could have left \r\n    the impressions.Â  However, he also testified that Fordâ€™s boot is unique and \r\n    is sold by Sears exclusively.Â  Tim Stephenson, an expert in tracking, followed \r\n    the tracks from the picnic table near the Stoverâ€™s house to Mizellâ€™s backyard \r\n    where her truck was parked.Â  Stephenson testified the person took the path \r\n    of least resistance, which is consistent with a person fleeing from the police.Â  \r\n    Stephenson also testified the tracks indicated that the person was unfamiliar \r\n    with the area and was in a hurry.Â  Additionally, he stated it takes about \r\n    7 minutes and 19 seconds to walk the distance from the picnic table to Mizellâ€™s \r\n    truck when walking at a rate of 2.9 miles an hour. \r\n  Ford moved for a directed verdict at the conclusion \r\n    of the Stateâ€™s case, arguing there was no eyewitness testimony or physical \r\n    evidence that placed Ford in the Stoversâ€™ house.Â  The court denied the motion, \r\n    finding there was sufficient evidence to be submitted to the jury.Â  The same \r\n    motion was renewed at the close of the evidence and again denied.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n     When reviewing a denial of a motion \r\n      for directed verdict, we use the same standard as the trial court by viewing \r\n      the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to \r\n      the non-moving party.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 299, 536 S.E.2d \r\n      408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œWhen a motion for a directed verdict is made \r\n      in a criminal case where the State relies exclusively on circumstantial \r\n      evidence, the lower court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence \r\n      of evidence, not with its weight.â€Â  State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, \r\n      409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000).Â  The trial judge must submit the case to \r\n      the jury if there is â€œany substantial evidence which reasonably tends to \r\n      prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly and \r\n      logically deduced.â€Â  State v. Edwards, 298 S.C 272, 275, 379 S.E.2d \r\n      888, 889 (1989).Â  We will reverse the trial court only when there is no \r\n      evidence to support the ruling below.Â  Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife \r\n      &amp; Marine Resources Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 29, 491 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1997).Â Â Â Â  \r\n    \r\n     LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n      Ford argues the trial court erred \r\n        in refusing to grant a directed verdict because the State failed to present \r\n        substantial evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of burglary \r\n        and kidnapping.Â  We disagree.\r\n        The Stateâ€™s evidence against Ford was entirely \r\n          circumstantial. In such cases, in order to survive a motion for directed \r\n          verdict, our supreme court has held the State must present substantial \r\n          circumstantial evidence that â€œreasonably tends to prove the guilt of \r\n          the accused or from which guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.â€Â  \r\n          Edwards, 298 S.C at 275, 379 S.E.2d at 889.Â  \r\n        The State presented substantial circumstantial \r\n          evidence that reasonably tended to prove Ford entered the Stoversâ€™ home \r\n          and abducted their child, and from which a jury could fairly and logically \r\n          deduce his guilt of those crimes.Â  An expert testified that tracks lead \r\n          from the site where Ford stole Mizellâ€™s Toyota to the picnic table where \r\n          he allegedly fell and dropped Trinity.Â  Another expert testified that \r\n          footprint impressions found by the Stoversâ€™ Mustang and behind Mizellâ€™s \r\n          house were consistent with Fordâ€™s boots.Â  Additionally, Short and a \r\n          trooper both saw a truck consistent with Mizellâ€™s stolen Toyota within \r\n          minutes of the time Ford allegedly walked from the Stoversâ€™ home to \r\n          Mizellâ€™s home and Ford was apprehended after he exited Mizellâ€™s truck.Â  \r\n          See State v.

Boggs and William Walker, Jr., both of Lexington, for Appellant.\r\nJonathan M. Robinson and J. Kennedy DuBose, Jr., both of Camden, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Pearl C. \r\n  Bryant sued William M. Conner following an automobile accident in which Bryant \r\n  allegedly suffered injuries.Â  The jury found in favor of Connor.Â  Bryant appeals \r\n  arguing the trial judge erred in permitting Connerâ€™s biomechanical expert to \r\n  testify on medical causation and by failing to disqualify a juror.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis accident occurred while Bryant was \r\n  attempting a left turn into the Lexington Post Office.Â  The cause of the accident \r\n  was disputed at trial.Â  Bryant testified that she had come to a complete stop \r\n  before turning when Conner hit her â€œfull forceâ€ from behind.Â  Conner testified \r\n  that he was either stopped or in the process of stopping when Bryantâ€™s car cut \r\n  over in front of his car.Â  Conner stated that the front of his car caught the \r\n  back of Bryantâ€™s car causing a very slight impact.Â  \r\nImmediately following the accident, Bryant \r\n  requested an ambulance because she claimed her heart was beating rapidly and \r\n  she was concerned about her history of heart problems.Â  Bryant also testified \r\n  that she had excruciating pain in her neck, shoulder, and back following the \r\n  accident.Â  An ambulance transported Bryant to the hospital where her cardiologist, \r\n  Dr. Saunders, examined her.Â  Dr. Saunders performed x-rays on Bryantâ€™s back \r\n  and prescribed medication for muscle spasms.Â  Bryantâ€™s back pain persisted over \r\n  the next several months, and Dr. Saunders referred her to an orthopedist.Â  The \r\n  orthopedist treated Bryant for approximately a month and a half before obtaining \r\n  her MRI results indicating she suffered from a sequestered disk.Â  Upon further \r\n  examination, an orthopedic surgeon diagnosed Bryant with a slippage of the vertebra \r\n  and a herniated disk.Â  After a course of steroid treatments, the orthopedic \r\n  surgeon performed two surgeries on Bryantâ€™s back to correct the slippage of \r\n  her vertebra.Â  \r\nDuring the course \r\n  of the trial, over Bryantâ€™s objection, Conner presented a videotaped deposition \r\n  of Dr. Robert Cargill, a biomechanical engineer.Â  Dr. Cargill testified that \r\n  based on his analysis of the forces involved in the accident, no biomechanical \r\n  mechanism in the collision could have caused Bryantâ€™s back injury.Â  \r\nAlso, during the trial and just after \r\n  Connerâ€™s testimony, a juror notified the trial judge that although she did not \r\n  know Conner personally, she realized that Connerâ€™s stepdaughter and her children \r\n  were good friends.Â  The trial judge asked the juror whether she could be fair \r\n  and impartial.Â  The juror responded, â€œI feel like I can be fair.â€Â  The judge \r\n  decided not to set aside the juror.Â  Before the jury received the case for deliberation, \r\n  Bryantâ€™s counsel requested the trial judge reconsider his decision not to set \r\n  aside the juror, stating that â€œ[the juror] was obviously very emotional, very \r\n  upset, I believe she was crying and very uncomfortable, at least on the appearance, \r\n  from an appearance standpoint, about her continuing role as a juror in this \r\n  case and her ability to be impartial.â€Â  The judge recalled the juror and again \r\n  asked if she felt she could be fair and impartial.Â  The juror responded, â€œI \r\n  feel like I could be fair and impartial, but if somebody feels I canâ€™t be, then \r\n  ---.â€Â  The trial judge declined to disqualify the juror over the objection of \r\n  Bryantâ€™s counsel.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAdmissibility of Biomechanical Expertâ€™s Testimony \r\n   \r\nOn appeal, Bryant does not argue \r\n  that the trial judge erred in permitting Connerâ€™s expert to testify as an expert \r\n  in biomechanical engineering. [1] Â  Rather, Bryant argues that the judge improperly permitted \r\n  the expert to testify on medical causation, which is outside the scope of his \r\n  expertise.Â  \r\nThe qualification of a witness as \r\n  an expert and the admissibility of expert testimony are matters left to the \r\n  sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on \r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion and prejudice to the opposing party.Â  See \r\n  Crawford v. Henderson,&nbsp;356 S.C. 389, 404, 589 S.E.2d 204, 212&nbsp;(Ct. \r\n  App. 2003); Nelson v. Taylor, 347 S.C. 210, 214, 553 S.E.2d 488, 490 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion arises from an error of law or a factual \r\n  conclusion that is without evidentiary support.â€Â  Lee v. Suess,\r\n318 S.C. 283, 285, 457 S.E.2d 344, 345 (1995) (citation omitted).Â  \r\n  â€œPermitting an expert witness to testify beyond the scope of his or her expertise \r\n  can constitute reversible error.â€Â  Pirayesh v. Pirayesh,&nbsp; 359 S.C. \r\n  284, 298, 596 S.E.2d 505, 513&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004). \r\nConner presented the deposition testimony \r\n  of Dr. Cargill to the jury as an expert in the field of accident reconstruction \r\n  and biomechanical engineering.Â  Bryant objected, arguing Dr. Cargill testified \r\n  about medical causation within his deposition, which was outside the scope of \r\n  his expertise. The judge stated that â€œ[h]e will not be qualified to give any \r\n  opinions medically,â€ but noted that: â€œ[h]is opinions that they can accept have \r\n  to be within his field of expertise.Â  Thatâ€™s all.Â  But you canâ€™t keep him from \r\n  saying other things.Â  All I can do is give instructions to the jury.â€Â  Bryant \r\n  consented to the jury instruction stating: â€œIn a perfect world you would keep \r\n  him from saying that, but it is not a perfect world and I understand that.â€Â  \r\n  Bryant made no further objection and Dr. Cargillâ€™s videotaped deposition was \r\n  played for the jury.Â  \r\nDr. Cargill \r\n  testified to the relative changes in velocity of Bryantâ€™s vehicle and the impact \r\n  this would have had on Bryantâ€™s body, including the load on her back.Â  This \r\n  testimony is consistent with the courtâ€™s definition of biomechanics.Â  In addition, \r\n  Dr. Cargill testified:\r\n\r\nThen I compared the forces, \r\n  again, that I calculated or established for her lower back in this accident \r\n  and compared those to everyday forces in the low back.Â  And my conclusion was \r\n  that there was no biomechanical mechanism in this - - in this collision to produce \r\n  the sequestered disk pathology that she was diagnosed with in September of â€™96. \r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Cargill further concluded \r\n  that this accident was a very minor collision and that the change in velocity \r\n  of the vehicles at the time of the collision was very small, at most three miles \r\n  per hour.Â  Dr. Cargill performed a crash test using a change in velocity of \r\n  3.5 miles per hour and determined the weight load exerted on the test dummyâ€™s \r\n  spine to be eighty-five pounds.Â  He opined that the load exerted in every day \r\n  activities such as bending over, lifting a trash can, or running involve heavier \r\n  spine loads than that exerted in the crash test.Â  \r\nIn charging the jury on expert testimony, the trial judge \r\n  stated, â€œto the extent that an expert offers an opinion outside his or her field \r\n  of expertise, you are not bound to accept it.â€Â  No objection was made to this \r\n  jury charge.Â  Generally, a curative instruction, such as the one given in this \r\n  case, is deemed to have cured any alleged error.Â  See State v. Kelsey, \r\n  331 S.C. 50, 70, 502 S.E.2d 63, 73 (1998) (explaining that instruction to disregard \r\n  inadmissible evidence will usually cure any error in its admission); State \r\n  v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 510, 476 S.E.2d 903, 911-12 (1996) (stating \r\n  that when a trial judge sustains a timely objection to testimony and gives the \r\n  jury a curative instruction to disregard testimony, any error is deemed to be \r\n  cured); State v. Patterson,&nbsp; 337 S.C. 215, 226, 522 S.E.2d 845, \r\n  850-51&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999); see also Jackson v. Speed,&nbsp; \r\n  326 S.C. 289, 307, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759&nbsp;(1997).Â  Bryant was required to \r\n  contemporaneously object to the sufficiency of the jury instruction or move \r\n  for a mistrial to preserve the issue for review.Â  See State v. McCord,&nbsp;349 \r\n  S.C. 477, 486, 562 S.E.2d 689, 694&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  Therefore, we decline \r\n  to address this issue on appeal.\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Juror Disqualification\r\nBryant argues the trial judge improperly \r\n  failed to excuse a juror who informed the court during the trial that her children \r\n  were good friends with Connerâ€™s stepdaughter.Â  We find no error.\r\nâ€œThe determination whether a juror \r\n  is disqualified is within the discretion of the trial judge and will not be \r\n  reversed on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence.â€Â  State \r\n  v. Tucker, 320 S.C. 206, 211, 464 S.E.2d 105, \r\n  108 (1995). \r\nSection 14-7-1020 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (Supp. 2003), explains the duties of a trial judge when a party makes a \r\n  motion asserting a juror has an interest in the cause of action or has the appearance \r\n  of bias or prejudice.Â  This section instructs the trial judge to disqualify \r\n  the juror if it appears that the juror is not indifferent.Â  Id.Â  A juror \r\n  who is acquainted with a party typically will not be excused when the failure \r\n  to disclose the relationship is inadvertent and there is an indication that \r\n  the juror has the ability to be fair and impartial.Â  See State v. \r\n  Stone, 350 S.C. 442, 448, 567 S.E.2d 244, 247-48 (2002) (holding removal \r\n  of a juror acquainted with the defendantâ€™s aunt was in error when the juror \r\n  was only casually acquainted with the jurorâ€™s aunt and the juror indicated to \r\n  the trial judge her ability to be fair and impartial); Wilson v. Childs, \r\n  315 S.C. 431, 437, 434 S.E.2d 286, 290 (Ct. App. 1993) (declining to find an \r\n  abuse of discretion when the trial judge refused to excuse jurors due to relationships \r\n  with either a party or the partyâ€™s attorney because the jurors voluntarily disclosed \r\n  the relationships and stated his or her ability to be impartial).Â  \r\nIn the case at bar, the juror voluntarily \r\n  disclosed her relationship to Conner and stated her ability to be impartial.Â  \r\n  The juror notified the trial judge upon her discovery that she knew of Conner \r\n  and later clarified that she did not know Conner personally but knew his stepdaughter.Â  \r\n  Despite the statement from Bryantâ€™s counsel that the juror appeared to be emotional \r\n  and crying, we could discern no independent indication that this juror was acting \r\n  in any such manner.Â  Moreover, on each occasion she was questioned, the juror \r\n  stated that she felt she could be fair and impartial.Â  Thus, we find the trial \r\n  judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to excuse the juror.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Bryantâ€™s issue concerning \r\n  the admission of Connerâ€™s biomechanics expert testimony not to be preserved \r\n  for appeal.Â  Additionally, we find the trial judge did not err in declining \r\n  to excuse a juror based on her relationship with Connerâ€™s stepdaughter.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., \r\n  concur.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The trial judge did not make any specific finding qualifying Connerâ€™s \r\n    witness as an expert in biomechanical engineering or accident reconstruction.Â Â  \r\n    However, Bryant conceded that the witness was a biomechanical engineer expert.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-634","title":"Chart House v.

Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nOtto W. Ferrene, of Hilton Head, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Chart House, Inc., \r\n  appeals an order of the circuit court granting summary judgment to Palmetto \r\n  Bay Club Ownersâ€™ Association, a/k/a Palmetto Bay Club HPR (â€œPalmetto Bay Clubâ€) \r\n  and dismissing Palmetto Bay Club from the case.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 1, 1978, CHE, Inc., entered \r\n  into a twenty-five year ground lease for the Chart House Restaurant property \r\n  at Palmetto Bay Marina on Hilton Head Island.Â  The Appellant, Chart House, Inc., \r\n  is CHEâ€™s successor in interest.Â  Palmetto Bay Marina, a partnership entity, \r\n  was the lessor of the property at that time.Â  The ground lease granted a leasehold \r\n  interest in the Chart House property, â€œtogether with all present and future \r\n  improvements, Lessorâ€™s easements, rights of way, servitudes and appurtenances \r\n  in adjoining and adjacent land . . . .â€Â  This lease was never recorded.Â  \r\nPrior to 1982, Palmetto Bay Marina owned \r\n  the entire marina area.Â  Palmetto Bay Marina split into two separate partnerships \r\n  known as Marina Development Associates and Palmetto Bay Associates.Â  On October \r\n  5, 1982, Palmetto Bay Marina conveyed a portion of the real property adjacent \r\n  to the Chart House tract, including the parcel now owned by Palmetto Bay Club, \r\n  to Marina Development.Â  Palmetto Bay Marina assigned the parcel leased to Chart \r\n  House to Palmetto Bay Associates.Â  \r\nOn October 8, 1982, Marina Development \r\n  and Palmetto Bay Associates granted each other, by means of a cross easement \r\n  agreement, reciprocal easements for ingress, egress, and parking in the area \r\n  between the two properties.Â  This easement was to run with the title to the \r\n  Chart House property.Â  Chart House joined in the agreement â€œfor the sole purpose \r\n  of consenting to the easements, rights and privileges granted pursuant [to the \r\n  agreement] to the extent such easements, rights and privileges affect[ed] the \r\n  Chart House property.â€Â  This document was subsequently recorded.Â  \r\nOn the same date, Chart House entered \r\n  into a â€œFirst Amendment and Modificationâ€ agreement (â€œAmended Agreementâ€) with \r\n  Palmetto Bay Associates, its new lessor.Â  The Amended Agreement referenced both \r\n  the ground lease and the cross easement agreement, and purported to â€œamend and \r\n  modifyâ€ the ground lease.Â  The parties also executed and recorded a â€œMemorandum \r\n  of Lease,â€ which referenced the original ground lease.Â  The Amended Agreement \r\n  substituted Palmetto Bay Associates for Palmetto Bay Marina as lessor.Â  In addition, \r\n  the Amended Agreement contained a section entitled â€œSubstitution of Property,â€ \r\n  which described the leased premises,Â  substituting â€œExhibit Aâ€ of the Amended \r\n  Agreement for â€œExhibit Aâ€ of the ground lease.Â  This section also contained \r\n  a release clause providing that â€œCHE hereby acknowledges and agrees that it \r\n  shall from and after the date hereof have no rights whatsoever in and to any \r\n  real property under the Lease except for the Property described in the attached \r\n  Exhibit â€œA.â€Â  \r\nAt issue is the scope of the effect of \r\n  the release clause.Â  Chart House contends, and Palmetto Bay Club does not deny, \r\n  that the substitution of property was necessary to conform the ground leaseâ€™s \r\n  description of the premises to the redrawn property lines as a result of the \r\n  conveyance from Palmetto Bay Marina to Marina Development.Â  Therefore, Chart \r\n  House argues that the above-referenced language was intended only as a release \r\n  of all claims of interest to the real property under the ground lease.Â  Palmetto \r\n  Bay Clubâ€™s contention is that this language modified not only the ground lease, \r\n  but the cross easement agreement as well, so as to divest Chart House of any \r\n  interest in the ingress/egress and parking easement over the Marina Development \r\n  property.\r\nOn March 28, 2001, Chart House filed \r\n  suit naming several defendants, including Palmetto Bay Club.Â  The complaint \r\n  alleged causes of action for (1) nuisance, (2) breach of covenants, and (3) \r\n  trespass based on Chart Houseâ€™s rights under both the ground lease, as modified \r\n  by the Amended Agreement, and the cross easement agreement.Â  The causes of action \r\n  for nuisance and trespass dealt with parking and named all the defendants.Â  \r\n  However, the cause of action for breach of covenant not to compete named only \r\n  Cross Island Associates, LLC, and its lessee, W.G. Shuckers, Inc., and alleged \r\n  a breach of the covenant not to compete between Chart House and Palmetto Bay \r\n  Marina contained in the ground lease, which prohibited Palmetto Bay Marina or \r\n  its successors from engaging in the restaurant business.Â  \r\nBoth Cross Island and \r\n  Palmetto Bay Club subsequently moved for partial summary judgment on five nearly \r\n  identical grounds, all of which went to the enforceability of the ground lease.Â  \r\n  Palmetto Bay Clubâ€™s motion also contained a sixth ground, as follows: â€œThat \r\n  a finding that any of the above are decided in favor of the movant, result [sic] \r\n  in an order dismissing the movant from the first, second and third causes of \r\n  action.â€Â  Both motions were argued together at Palmetto Bay Clubâ€™s request.Â  \r\n  At the hearing, counsel for Cross Island specified that its motion was directed \r\n  solely at the covenant not to compete contained in the ground lease and the \r\n  effect of the Amended Agreement on the lease.Â  The trial court granted summary \r\n  judgment to both Cross Island and Palmetto Bay Club on the breach of the covenant \r\n  not to compete claim.Â  The court also dismissed both defendants from the action, \r\n  holding that the release language in the Amended Agreement quoted above operated \r\n  to divest Chart House of any interest in any property other than its leasehold.Â  \r\n\r\nChart House filed a \r\n  timely motion to reconsider, which was denied by Judge Gregory. [1] Â  Chart House appealed from the \r\n  order granting summary judgment to Palmetto Bay Club.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is appropriate \r\n  when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the conclusions \r\n  and inferences to be drawn from the facts are undisputed.â€Â  McClanahan v. \r\n  Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 437, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002) (citation \r\n  omitted).Â  Additionally, in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, a reviewing \r\n  court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  \r\n  Id. at 438, 567 S.E.2d at 242.Â  Summary judgment is a drastic remedy.Â  \r\n  Therefore, it â€œshould be cautiously invoked so that a litigant will not be improperly \r\n  deprived of trial on disputed factual issues.â€Â  Cunningham ex rel. Grice \r\n  v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 491, 575 S.E.2d 549, 552 (2003) (citation \r\n  omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n Chart House argues that the trial court \r\n  violated its due process rights in granting summary judgment to Palmetto Bay \r\n  Club based on grounds not pled in its motion.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œIt is an error of law for a \r\n  court to decide a case on a ground not before it.â€Â  Griffin v. Capital Cash, \r\n  310 S.C. 288, 294, 423 S.E.2d 143, 147 (Ct. App. 1992) (citation omitted).Â  \r\n  â€œDue process requires that a litigant be placed on notice of the issues which \r\n  the court is to consider.â€Â  Bass v. Bass, 272 S.C. 177, 180, 249 S.E.2d \r\n  905, 906 (1978).Â  â€œOne of the basic purposes of a notice of motion is to apprise \r\n  the opposing party of the relief sought and the grounds therefore.â€Â  Turbeville \r\n  v. Floyd, 288 S.C. 171, 174, 341 S.E.2d 651, 652 (Ct. App. 1986) (quoting \r\n  Skinner v. Skinner, 257 S.C. 544, 549, 186 S.E.2d 523, 526 (1972)).Â  \r\n  Thus, a court ordinarily may not grant relief beyond the scope of the notice.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  A limited exception to this rule exists when a ground not included \r\n  in the notice of the motion is nevertheless fully argued before the court without \r\n  objection.Â  See Salvo v. Hewitt, Coleman &amp; Assocs., 274 S.C. \r\n  34, 39, 260 S.E.2d 708, 711 (1979).\r\nIn the instant case, Palmetto \r\n  Bay Club moved for summary judgment on grounds substantially similar to those \r\n  in Cross Islandâ€™s motion, and requested that the motions be argued together.Â  \r\n  At the beginning of the hearing, Cross Island made it very clear that its argument \r\n  was limited to the breach of covenant issue in Chart Houseâ€™s second cause of \r\n  action.Â  Neither in the notice of motion nor during the hearing did Palmetto \r\n  Bay Club apprise Chart House that it was arguing the parking easement issue.Â  \r\n  All of the grounds listed in the notice of motion went to the enforceability \r\n  of the ground lease.Â  Palmetto Bay Club did include an averment in its notice \r\n  requesting that a finding in its favor result in its release on all three causes \r\n  of action.Â  However, this vague request did not in any way place Chart House \r\n  on notice of its theory that one provision in the amended lease agreement effectively \r\n  nullified a separate agreement Chart House executed that same day with different \r\n  parties.Â  In other words, although Palmetto Bay Clubâ€™s notice of motion was \r\n  sufficient to apprise Chart House of the â€œrelief sought,â€ it failed to sufficiently \r\n  allege the â€œgrounds therefore.â€Â  See Turbeville, 288 S.C. at 174, \r\n  341 S.E.2d at 652.Â  \r\nBecause summary judgment was granted \r\n  on grounds that were not included in the motion and were not fully argued at \r\n  the hearing, we hold that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment \r\n  and dismissing Palmetto Bay Club from the case.Â  Accordingly, the order of the \r\n  trial court is \r\n REVERSED and REMANDED.  [2] \r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The trial judge, Judge Gerald C. Smoak, Sr., retired \r\n    subsequent to the trial and was replaced by Judge Jackson V. Gregory.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  We decline to address Chart Houseâ€™s remaining issues on appeal.Â  \r\n    See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. \r\n    598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (finding that an appellate court need \r\n    not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-635","title":"Simpson v.

Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, \r\n  all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  In this appeal, we must decide \r\n  whether the circuit court erred in denying the defendantâ€™s motion for a mistrial \r\n  due to alleged juror misconduct.Â  We find no abuse of discretion and therefore \r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMurphy Rivers was indicted for assault with intent \r\n  to kill and tried before a jury.Â  The trial continued over the course of two \r\n  days.Â  On the morning of the second day, defense counsel raised a concern about \r\n  possible juror misconduct that allegedly occurred during the previous dayâ€™s \r\n  proceedings.Â  The following colloquy took place outside the presence of the \r\n  jury:\r\n\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, \r\n  it came to my attention on [sic] yesterday after the close of the testimony \r\n  that a member of the jury had been sleeping throughout a substantial part of \r\n  the trial, and for that reason we would move for a mistrial.\r\nTHE COURT: I would deny that. \r\n  It is a little late to bring it to the Courtâ€™s attention.\r\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: It wasnâ€™t until \r\n  after the jury had left the Court yesterday that people who were in the Courtroom \r\n  advised us of that.\r\nTHE COURT: Bring in the jury.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nRivers moved for a mistrial, which was denied.Â  \r\n  The issue of the allegedly sleeping juror was not raised to or addressed by \r\n  the circuit judge any further.Â  At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found \r\n  Rivers guilty of the crime charged.Â  Rivers now appeals the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  denial of his motion for a mistrial.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a motion for a mistrial \r\n  is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. Creighton v. \r\n  Coligny Plaza Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 334 S.C. 96, 118, 512 S.E.2d 510, 521 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998).Â  Absent an abuse of discretion, the decision of the trial court will \r\n  not be overturned on appeal. Id.Â  The burden is upon the moving party \r\n  to show not only error, but resulting prejudice. State v. Wasson, 299 \r\n  S.C. 508, 510, 386 S.E.2d 255, 256 (1989). In any event, the grant of a mistrial \r\n  is an extreme measure that should not be granted unless absolutely necessary, \r\n  and the trial judge should exhaust all other methods to cure possible prejudice \r\n  before aborting a trial. Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRivers argues the circuit court abused \r\n  its discretion by denying his motion for a mistrial without investigating the \r\n  allegations of juror misconduct.Â  We disagree.\r\nRivers argues that an abuse of discretion \r\n  must be found based on our opinion in State v. Hurd, 325 S.C. 384, 480 \r\n  S.E.2d 94 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In Hurd, the trial court refused the defendantâ€™s \r\n  request to question a juror who appeared to be asleep during portions of closing \r\n  arguments and jury instructions.Â  We reversed the defendantâ€™s conviction, stating \r\n  that a trial court â€œshould at least attempt to make this determination whenever \r\n  a juror appears to be asleep.â€ Id. at 390, 480 S.E.2d at 97.Â  The trial \r\n  court in Hurd made no such inquiry.Â Â  Thus, we held the trial judge â€œshould \r\n  have either determined whether the juror was in fact asleep, recharged the entire \r\n  jury, or replaced the juror.â€ Id.  \r\n The present case is readily distinguishable \r\n  from Hurd.Â  First, and most importantly, Rivers did not request that \r\n  the trial judge conduct any investigation into the matter of alleged juror misconduct.Â  \r\n  Rivers simply accepted the trial judgeâ€™s denial of his motion for a mistrial \r\n  without asking the court to voir dire the juror or undertake further inquiry.Â  \r\n  Because Rivers bore the burden of showing the juror was asleep or otherwise \r\n  engaged in misconduct, his failure to request direct examination of the jurorâ€”unlike \r\n  the defendant in Hurdâ€”waives any complaint on appeal.Â  See State \r\n  v. Smith, 338 S.C. 66, 75, 525 S.E.2d 263, 268 (Ct. App. 1999) (holding \r\n  that defendantâ€™s failure to request that the trial judge investigate allegations \r\n  that a juror was asleep during trial â€œwaives any complaint on appealâ€); see \r\n  also State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 550-51, 514 S.E.2d 584, 589-90 \r\n  (1999) (noting that counsel must request that the trial court investigate juror \r\n  misconduct).\r\nFurther distinguishing the instant case \r\n  is the fact that, in Hurd, the defense counsel reported that he actually \r\n  saw the juror sleeping, and the trial judge agreed there was cause for concernâ€”declaring \r\n  specifically that he â€œnoticed [the juror] nodding off a couple of timesâ€ but \r\n  that the juror â€œwas alert during most of the charge.â€ 325 S.C. at 388-89, 480 \r\n  S.E.2d at 97.Â  Here, on the other hand, defense counsel based his motion solely \r\n  on the statement of an unnamed third party that a juror was asleep.Â  No assertion \r\n  was made that defense counsel or anyone else directly involved in the trial \r\n  witnessed any juror misconduct.Â  It would be difficult indeed to fault the trial \r\n  judge for giving little credence to these unsupported, unverifiable allegations.Â  \r\n  These bare assertions clearly fall well short of the necessary showing to warrant \r\n  the grant of a motion for mistrial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Rivers waived any complaint on \r\n  appeal regarding the alleged juror misconduct by failing to request that the \r\n  trial judge investigate the matter.Â  Moreover, we otherwise find no abuse of \r\n  discretion by the trial judge given the scant grounds raised in support of the \r\n  motion for a mistrial. The ruling of the circuit court is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-637","title":"SCDSS v.

Pachak, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and \r\n  Solicitor Randolph Murdaugh, III, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  A Beaufort County grand jury \r\n  indicted Maurice Wally on one count of burglary in the first degree.Â  Following \r\n  trial, Wally was convicted and sentenced to a term of fifteen years.Â  On appeal, \r\n  Wally argues the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict of not guilty \r\n  on the burglary charge because the State failed to present evidence that Wally \r\n  entered the dwelling with the intent to commit a crime therein.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFacts\r\nAround 4:00 \r\n  a.m. on December 6, 2001, William and Starletta Hairston were asleep in the \r\n  upstairs portion their home when they were awakened by the chirping of their \r\n  alarm system. [2] Â  William got \r\n  out of bed and went to check on his three boys who were sleeping in an adjacent \r\n  bedroom.Â  After ensuring the children were in bed, he went back to his bedroom \r\n  and retrieved a shotgun from a locked compartment behind his bed.Â  Starletta \r\n  turned on the bedroom lights and called the police.Â  \r\nWith the \r\n  shotgun in hand, Mr. Hairston rushed to the top of the stairs where he noticed \r\n  Wally moving from the interior of the house towards the front door.Â  William \r\n  testified he cocked the shotgun to let Wally know he â€œwas ready,â€ and then ordered \r\n  him to stop in his tracks. Â Wally complied and did not move.Â  William then asked \r\n  Wally what he was doing in the house and Wally replied, â€œthe gate told [me] \r\n  to come in.â€Â  William then ordered Wally to get down on the floor where he was \r\n  held at gunpoint until the police arrived and placed him under arrest.Â  \r\nWilliam testified \r\n  Wally did not have anything in his hands when this confrontation took place \r\n  and an inspection of the house the next morning revealed nothing was missing.Â  \r\n  William estimated Wally was in the home for a little over two minutes before \r\n  he was confronted.Â  \r\nAt the close of \r\n  evidence, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict asserting that Wally \r\n  did not attempt to take anything out of the home and the State failed to prove \r\n  he intended to commit a crime in the house.Â  The trial court denied the motion, \r\n  found Wally guilty but mentally ill, and sentenced him to fifteen years imprisonment. \r\n  [3] Â Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nWallyâ€™s sole argument \r\n  on appeal is â€œ[t]he trial court erred in failing to grant a directed verdict \r\n  to the charge of burglary because the state failed to present any substantial \r\n  evidence . . . that appellant entered the dwelling with the intent to commit \r\n  a crime.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn considering \r\n  a motion for directed verdict in a criminal case, all evidence is viewed in \r\n  the light most favorable to the State.â€Â  State v. Smith, 352 S.C. 133, \r\n  136, 572 S.E.2d 473, 474 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  To this end, â€œ[t]he Court of Appeals \r\n  is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, not its weight.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Nesbitt, 346 S.C. 226, 230, 550 S.E.2d 864, 866 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  As such, we can only reverse the trial court if the record contains no evidence \r\n  justifying its ruling.Â  State v. Douglas, 359 S.C. 187, 203, 597 S.E.2d \r\n  1, 9 (Ct. App.Â  2004).Â  Thus, an accused is entitled to a directed verdict when \r\n  the State fails to present evidence of the crime charged.Â  Id.  \r\nA person is guilty of first-degree burglary when \r\n  â€œthe person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime \r\n  in the dwelling, and . . . (3) the entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (2003).Â  Essentially Wally argues that because nothing \r\n  was missing from the house and none of the homeownersâ€™ belongings were in his \r\n  possession when he was caught, there is no evidence he intended to commit a \r\n  crime in the house.\r\nThis assertion, however, is completely without \r\n  merit.Â  As our supreme court noted in State v. Haney, 257 S.C. 89, 91, \r\n  184 S.E.2d 344, 345 (1971), â€œ[a]bsent an admission by the defendant, proof of \r\n  intent necessarily rests on inference from conduct.â€Â  The court went on to explain \r\n  that â€œ[w]hen the building entered is a dwelling house, the weight of authority \r\n  holds that the unexplained breaking and entry in the night is itself evidence \r\n  of intent to commit larceny . . . . The fundamental theory, in the absence of \r\n  evidence of other intent or explanation for breaking and entering, is that the \r\n  usual object or purpose of burglarizing a dwelling house at night is theft.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 91-92, 184 S.E.2d at 345. \r\nConclusion\r\nAccordingly, because intent to commit a \r\n  crimeâ€”i.e., larcenyâ€”can be inferred from the breaking and entering itself, we \r\n  find there is evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Accordingly, we \r\n  find the trial court did not err in failing to grant Wallyâ€™s directed verdict \r\n  motion and as such, the ruling is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Mr. Hairston explained that the alarm would chirp when one of the \r\n    homeâ€™s doors or windows were opened.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  At trial, defense counsel brought to the courtâ€™s attention the fact \r\n    that Wallyâ€™s mental evaluation indicated he had a family history of psychotic \r\n    illness and mental retardation.Â  He also noted Wally received treatment in \r\n    the past for hearing voices and a personality disorder.Â Â  Although the court \r\n    took this history into consideration and sentenced Wally accordingly, Wallyâ€™s \r\n    mental condition is not at issue in this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-639","title":"State v.

Wood and E. Kimberly Berry, both of Greenville,\r\nfor Respondent. \r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; In this action for child support, a father appeals an \r\n  award of both retroactive and prospective child support and attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  to the mother.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nVickie F. Myers (â€œMotherâ€) and Christopher \r\n  C. Cosgrove (â€œFatherâ€) dated and cohabitated intermittently from July 1997 until \r\n  July 1999.Â  In November 1998, the couple had a child. Â Mother brought \r\n  this action on May 2, 2001, pursuant to section 20-7-420 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (Supp. 2003), seeking custody of the minor child, child support, retroactive \r\n  child support, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â Â  \r\nIn a temporary order, the family court ordered \r\n  a paternity test.Â  If the paternity test was positive, Father was ordered to \r\n  pay the costs of the test and child support retroactively from the date the \r\n  action was filed.Â  The test results, which were positive, were mailed to both \r\n  parties on August 16, 2001; however, Father denies having any knowledge of the \r\n  results until January 2002.Â  Also in January 2002, the case was administratively \r\n  stricken from the active trial docket pursuant to the â€œ270 day rule.â€\r\nIn an order dated September 27, 2002, the court \r\n  denied Motherâ€™s first motion to restore the action, in part because discovery \r\n  was not complete.Â  This was due largely to Fatherâ€™s failure to cooperate with \r\n  Motherâ€™s discovery requests.Â  The court gave Mother leave to file another motion \r\n  to restore when discovery was complete.Â  The court granted motherâ€™s second motion \r\n  to restore the action as well as a contemporaneous motion to amend the pleadings.Â  \r\n  The motion to amend sought to include a request for Father to carry life insurance \r\n  for the benefit of their child.Â  The court also found Father waived the mediation \r\n  requirement by his refusal to participate.Â Â Â  \r\nAt the final hearing, Mother testified she is currently \r\n  employed as a legal assistant with a reported gross monthly income of $2,150. \r\n  Health insurance expenses each month for the minor child are $120.Â  Daycare \r\n  initially cost $303 per month but at the time of the final hearing cost approximately \r\n  $275 per month.Â  Mother also has custody of a seven-year-old son from a previous \r\n  relationship for which she receives no child support.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nFather testified he is a part-time tattoo artist \r\n  apprentice with a monthly income of $600. He has completed three and a half \r\n  years of a five-year apprenticeship.Â  He is thirty-two years of age and \r\n  in good health.Â  He reported living expenses of $810.87, including $237 per \r\n  month child support for another child.Â  Father, however, receives periodic gifts \r\n  of cash from his mother, who also pays for the mortgage on his residence, which \r\n  they jointly own.Â  He has not filed a tax return for the last five years.Â  When \r\n  asked why he did not file tax returns, he responded, â€œIâ€™m making six hundred \r\n  dollars ($600) a month. And I do not owe the IRS any monies. You do not have \r\n  to file your income tax if you do not owe any money.â€Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nÂ The family court found Father to be the childâ€™s \r\n  biological father, gave custody to Mother, awarded her child support of $589 \r\n  per month, and required Father to pay retroactive child support from the date \r\n  of the initial filing.Â  The court ordered that back child support be paid in \r\n  two lump sum payments and orderedÂ Â  Father to pay $7,500 of Motherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees and costs.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has \r\n  authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d \r\n  154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to \r\n  disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, \r\n  276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the family \r\n  court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate \r\n  their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers \r\n  v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nI. Child Support\r\nFather claims the family court erred \r\n  in awarding Mother child support of $589 per month based upon an imputed income \r\n  of $2,929 per month.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe amount of a child support award is \r\n  within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on \r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Smith v. Smith, 264 S.C. \r\n  624, 628, 216 S.E.2d 541, 543 (1975). Â In determining the amount of child support, \r\n  crucial factors include: the needs of the children; the incomes, earning capacities \r\n  and assets of the parents; and the health, ages, general physical condition, \r\n  and living expenses of the parents.Â  Bradley v. Bradley, 285 S.C. \r\n  170, 172-73, 328 S.E.2d 647, 648 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  \r\nAt trial, the family court heard an abundance of \r\n  testimony concerning the earning capacities of the parties, much of it conflicting.Â  \r\n  On his financial declaration, Father claimed a gross monthly income of $600 \r\n  per month because he only worked three days a week as a tattoo apprentice.Â  \r\n  He testified the benefit of the apprenticeship is a resulting recommendation \r\n  into a tattoo guild, though he admitted â€œyou donâ€™t have to be a member of the \r\n  [guild to] set up shop and make money tattooing.â€Â  Mother testified Father worked \r\n  both part-time and full-time as a tattoo artist when she was living with him \r\n  and he averaged $150 per day, after expenses.Â  She stated he had a reputation \r\n  in the community as a â€œvery good artist.â€Â  Father, on the other hand, stated \r\n  he usually averaged only $50 per day.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTen years ago, Father \r\n  was employed as a construction worker making approximately $14 per hour.Â  He \r\n  quit this job to follow the Grateful Dead around the country.Â  Even though he \r\n  did not graduate, he received a certificate of completion in 1991 from the Harley \r\n  Davidson mechanicâ€™s program.Â  Furthermore, he was proficient enough in motorcycle \r\n  maintenance to build his own bike out of spare parts.Â  Mother provided current \r\n  occupational employment wage statistics for motorcycle mechanics and highway \r\n  maintenance workers in Florida, where Father currently resides.Â  Construction \r\n  workers with experience can earn $13 per hour, while entry-level mechanics can \r\n  earn as much as $10 per hour.Â  Father, however, testified he was injured in \r\n  â€œseveralâ€ car wrecks, preventing him from doing any work that requires sitting \r\n  or standing.Â  He did not, however, submit any evidence to corroborate these \r\n  statements.Â  He also admitted he was not â€œreally fightingâ€ the denial of his \r\n  disability claim because he did not â€œneed to be living off the state.â€Â  He testified \r\n  he could â€œmake enough to pay for [his] food on the tableâ€ with his salary of \r\n  $150 per week.Â Â  \r\nAlthough this court has authority to find the facts \r\n  in accordance with our own view of the evidence, we are mindful that the family \r\n  court judge was better situated to evaluate witness credibility and assign comparative \r\n  weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers, 349 S.C. at 91, 561 S.E.2d at 613.Â  \r\n  It is abundantly clear from the family courtâ€™s order that the trial judge found \r\n  Fatherâ€™s testimony grossly lacking in the areas of consistency and credibility, \r\n  and from what we can glean from the record on appeal, we agree.Â  Husband contradicted \r\n  himself throughout his testimony about his business, finances and the facts \r\n  of this case. For instance, on direct examination he testified his tattoo business \r\n  failed because he â€œdidnâ€™t have enough business smarts to keep it going.â€Â  On \r\n  cross-examination, however, he claimed the business failed because â€œthe guy \r\n  [he] was going in partnership with [was] tripped out on drugs.Â  And he made \r\n  [them] get kicked out of [their] studio.â€Â  In a deposition, Father stated that \r\n  he was involved in litigation to recoup these business losses.Â  When questioned \r\n  on the matter at trial Father explained he â€œnever pursuedâ€ the lawsuit.Â  In \r\n  fact, he could not even recall the name of the attorney representing him in \r\n  the alleged action.Â  Similarly, at trial, Father denied having knowledge of \r\n  the paternity test results until shortly before trial began, while in his deposition \r\n  he admitted learning of the results in January 2002.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Code defines income \r\n  of a parent as â€œthe actual gross income of the parent, if employed to full capacity, \r\n  or potential income if unemployed or underemployed.â€Â  27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. \r\n  114-4720(A)(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  To determine potential income, â€œthe court should \r\n  determine the employment potential and probable earnings level of the parent \r\n  based on that parentâ€™s recent work history, occupational qualifications, and \r\n  prevailing job opportunities and earning levels in the community.â€Â  27 S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5)(b) (Supp. 2003).Â  For the reasons discussed above, \r\n  we find no error in the family courtâ€™s acceptance of Motherâ€™s testimony regarding \r\n  Fatherâ€™s earning potential for the purposes of calculating child support.\r\nWe likewise find the family courtâ€™s consideration \r\n  of money Father receives from his mother a proper factor in the computation \r\n  of child support.Â  In regard to computing income for the purpose of determining \r\n  child support, the regulations provide:\r\n\r\n(2)(b) In addition to determining potential earnings, the \r\n  court should impute income to any non-income producing assets of either parent, \r\n  if significant, other than a primary residence or personal property . . . .\r\nGross income does not include: . . . \r\n(3)(c) In-kind income; however, the court should count \r\n  as income expense reimbursements or in-kind payments received by a parent from \r\n  self-employment or operation of a business if they are significant and reduce \r\n  personal living expenses, such as a company car, free housing, \r\n  or reimbursed meals.\r\n\r\n27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(2)(b) &amp; (A)(3)(c) \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nFather admitted his mother gave him large \r\n  amounts of cash in 1998, 1999, and 2002 for maintenance of the house they jointly \r\n  own; however, he submitted no evidence that the money was actually spent on \r\n  anything relating to the upkeep of the house.Â  His mother also pays his portion \r\n  of the mortgage, amounting to approximately $5,149.92 per year.Â Â Â  In this case, \r\n  Father admits that by maintaining the house, he is managing an investment for \r\n  his mother.Â  Because Fatherâ€™s personal expenses are substantially reduced by \r\n  the payments he receives for this service, we conclude the money given to Father \r\n  falls under the exception to the general rule that in-kind income is not gross \r\n  income for the purposes of computing child support. \r\nFather argues that because he is not \r\n  obligated to pay taxes on this income, and there is no guarantee he will continue \r\n  receiving these monetary gifts in the future, it should not be considered as \r\n  â€œgross incomeâ€ for the purposes of calculating child support.Â  We are not convinced.Â  \r\n  In Mobley v. Mobley, 309 S.C. 134, 139, 420 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. \r\n  1992), this court held a husbandâ€™s income from employee benefits, including \r\n  housing and utilities, could be treated as income for purposes of determining \r\n  child support payments even though the husband had â€œno tax liability for the \r\n  value of the housingâ€ or any guarantee that he would continue to receive the \r\n  bonuses.\r\nHaving reviewed the record, we find by \r\n  a preponderance of the evidence that Father has a potential to earn significantly \r\n  more income. We therefore affirm the family courtâ€™s determination that Fatherâ€™s \r\n  imputed income is $2,929 per month.Â  Consequently, we uphold the family courtâ€™s \r\n  award of $589 per month in child support.Â Â  \r\nII. Attorneyâ€™sÂ  Fees\r\nFather claims the family court \r\n  erred in awarding Mother $7,500 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe award of attorneyâ€™s fees is within the discretion \r\n  of the court.â€Â  Hardwick v. Hardwick, 303 S.C. 256, 261, 399 S.E.2d \r\n  791, 794 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  In determining whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, \r\n  the court should consider each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees, the \r\n  beneficial results obtained by the attorney, the partiesâ€™ respective financial \r\n  conditions, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. \r\n  v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1992). \r\nWe find no abuse of discretion \r\n  in requiring Father to pay a portion of Motherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family \r\n  court found Mother owed her attorney at least $9,380.50. Â In addition, Mother \r\n  incurred costs of $1,075.70 during the discovery process due to Fatherâ€™s refusal \r\n  to cooperate.Â  Father also failed to comply with court ordered mediation, prolonging \r\n  this litigation.\r\nÂ Fatherâ€™s potential income, \r\n  combined with his earnings for managing the property on which he lives, brings \r\n  his total gross monthly income to an amount greater than Motherâ€™s.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  Father has equity in the Florida residence of approximately $29,000. [2] Â Â Â  \r\nOn the other hand, Mother \r\n  has no assets or savings, and is burdened by considerable debt.Â  She cannot \r\n  afford to pay her attorneyâ€™s fees without substantially impacting the standard \r\n  of living of her and her children.Â  See Pendergast v. Pendergast, \r\n  354 S.C. 32, 40, 579 S.E.2d 530, 534 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Because of Fatherâ€™s conduct, \r\n  including his failure to comply with the mediation order or cooperate with discovery, \r\n  Mother incurred a greater amount of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Mother testified, â€œ[h]e \r\n  just kept saying, â€˜Take me to courtâ€™â€ when she would beg him for money.Â  In \r\n  fact, Father admitted he â€œdidnâ€™t give her any other option other than coming \r\n  to court.â€Â  This court finds his conduct unnecessarily prolonged this litigation.\r\nMotherâ€™s counsel achieved \r\n  beneficial results, as she received a substantial award of child support, which \r\n  we now affirm.Â  As the family courtâ€™s appropriate consideration of the E.D.M. \r\n  factors in determining the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees is apparent from the record, \r\n  we conclude the family court did not err in requiring Father to contribute $7,500 \r\n  toward Motherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nIII. Lump Sum Payments\r\nFather claims the family court \r\n  erred in requiring him to pay attorneyâ€™s fees and retroactive child support \r\n  in large lump sum payments.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court ordered \r\n  Father to pay $2,500 of the attorneyâ€™s fees in a lump sum.Â  It further ordered \r\n  three equal installments of $3,951.67 for retroactive child support.Â  Father \r\n  has a potential income of $2,929 per month and substantial equity in his home.Â  \r\n  He has the ability to pay the past due child support and attorneyâ€™s fees in \r\n  the time allotted and this will not create any undue hardship or burden on him.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we affirm the award of lump sum payments for the attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  and child support.\r\nIV. Life Insurance Award Reservation\r\nFather claims the family court \r\n  erred in reserving an award of life insurance. We agree.Â  \r\nSouth Carolina recognizes \r\n  the availability of life insurance as security for the support obligation.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-160 (Supp.2003).Â  â€œThe family court is within \r\n  its legal authority to require a supporting spouse to maintain a life insurance \r\n  policy naming the child as beneficiary to insure the continued support of the \r\n  minor child.â€Â  Ivey v. Ivey, 286 S.C. 315, 318, 334 S.E.2d 123, 125 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1985).Â  This imposition, however, must be based on compelling reasons, \r\n  such as failure to pay, which make the security a necessity.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAlthough the family court denied \r\n  Motherâ€™s request for Father to maintain life insurance with the child as irrevocable \r\n  beneficiary, the court reserved the right to grant the request in six months. \r\n  A reservation of an award is not standard in child support cases because â€œif \r\n  it subsequently appears security is necessary, the continuing jurisdiction of \r\n  the family court affords ample opportunity to require security by life insurance.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â Â  The family court may reserve an award if there are present or foreseeable \r\n  circumstances warranting the reservation.Â  Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, \r\n  435-36, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  When there are no compelling reasons \r\n  for an award of life insurance as security for the child support obligation \r\n  at the time of trial, and â€œno indication of physical or mental illness, foreseeable \r\n  change in need in the future, or such other extenuating circumstance,â€ reservation \r\n  is not appropriate.Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 363, 384 S.E.2d \r\n  741, 747 (1989).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n Because the record \r\n  does not reflect any specific factual findings to support reservation of the \r\n  grant of life insurance as security for support, we reverse the family courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling on this issue.Â  However, we remand this issue back to the family court \r\n  for additional findings to determine what extenuating circumstances exist, if \r\n  any, to justify a reservation of the award.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the family courtâ€™s \r\n  rulings are hereby \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J. , GOOLSBY andÂ  WILLIAMS, JJ. , concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Current equity in the home is approximately $58,000, split between \r\n    the co-owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-641","title":"State v. holliday","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayUnPubOpinion.cfm?caseNo=2004-UP-641","description":null,"date":"2004-12-20","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE\r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoBodyText\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS OPINION HAS NO PRECEDENTIAL VALUE.Â  IT SHOULD NOT BE \r\n  CITED OR RELIED ON AS PRECEDENT IN ANY PROCEEDING EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BY RULE \r\n  239(d)(1), SCACR.\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nThe State,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent,\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nFranklin Wayne Holliday,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAppellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From York County\r\nJohn C.

Patterson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-643\r\nHeard November 16, 2004 â€“ Filed December 20, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nRivers S. Stilwell and Peter G. Siachos, both of Greenville, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nJoseph A. Mooneyham, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Chevy Chase Bank appeals a \r\n  circuit court order enforcing a settlement agreement entered into between it \r\n  and Marcum Mace.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn September 1996, Marcum \r\n  Mace obtained a second mortgage to finance construction of a residential swimming \r\n  pool.Â  Payments were not to be made on the mortgage until construction of the \r\n  swimming pool was completed and the last payment given to the pool contractor.Â  \r\n  Before construction was complete, Chevy Chase Bank acquired the mortgage and \r\n  began to prematurely assess interest and penalties on the loan.Â  Mace filed \r\n  suit against the Bank, seeking return of the mistaken penalties and interest \r\n  and correction of his credit history.Â  \r\nThe parties held mediation after considerable written \r\n  discovery was taken, including Maceâ€™s credit report, and on September 11, 2001, \r\n  they entered into a written settlement agreement.Â  The Bank agreed to pay Mace \r\n  $20,000 and to refinance the principal loan on his home.Â  The agreement provided \r\n  the refinancing was â€œcontingent upon the submission and approval of an application \r\n  by Mace.â€Â  Mace and a representative of the Bank, as well as both attorneys, \r\n  signed the agreement, but it was neither filed with the court nor entered into \r\n  the record.Â  \r\nIn November 2001, the Bank paid the agreed upon \r\n  $20,000 and sent Mace a credit application.Â  Mace completed the application \r\n  and returned it to the Bank, but it was rejected because Mace used a pencil.Â  \r\n  A second application, completed with a pen, was sent to the Bank on December \r\n  18, 2001.Â  No action was taken on this application until it was rejected in \r\n  February 2002 based on a negative credit history.Â  In August 2002, Mace commenced \r\n  the current litigation by filing a motion to compel settlement.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, Mace argued the Bank improperly \r\n  refused to refinance his home loan.Â  Specifically, Mace asserted the credit \r\n  report given to the Bank at the time the settlement took place showed no substantial \r\n  negative credit history.Â  Although he acknowledged his credit report did contain \r\n  negative history by the time the Bank took action on the application, Mace asserted \r\n  the negative history occurred as Mace â€œallowed some things to go a little bit \r\n  late because he anticipated the refinance and having additional funds with which \r\n  to resolve some credit card bills.â€Â  Mace argued the settlement contemplated \r\n  approval for the refinancing at the time of settlement, not five months later.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Bank presented two reasons why the settlement \r\n  should not be enforced.Â  First, the Bank argued Rule 43(k), SCRCP, specifically \r\n  applied to the settlement, and because the settlement was not filed with the \r\n  court nor entered into the record, it was not enforceable.Â  Alternatively, the \r\n  Bank asserted the condition precedent to the refinancingâ€”submission and approval \r\n  of an applicationâ€”was not met.Â  The Bank averred it considered Maceâ€™s application, \r\n  but was just unable to approve it because of the negative credit history.Â  \r\nOn May 6, 2003, the circuit court issued an order \r\n  granting the motion to compel settlement.Â  The court ruled that Rule 43(k) did \r\n  not apply to the settlement agreement, and the Bank could not, by its own delay, \r\n  prejudice Maceâ€™s application.Â  Accordingly, the court ordered the Bank to grant \r\n  the refinancing.Â  The Bank argues on appeal these rulings were in error.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn action to determine liability under a settlement \r\n  agreement is an action at law.Â  Pruitt v. South Carolina Medical Malpractice \r\n  Liability Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n, 343 S.C. 335, 339, 540 S.E.2d 843, 845&nbsp;(2001).Â  \r\n  â€œ[I]n an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings \r\n  of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without \r\n  evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Townes Assocs., \r\n  Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775&nbsp;(1976).Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Bank first asserts the circuit court erred \r\n  in finding Rule 43(k), SCRCP, did not prevent enforcement of the settlement \r\n  agreement.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nRule 43(k), SCRCP provides:Â  â€œ[n]o agreement between \r\n  counsel affecting the proceedings in an action shall be binding unless reduced \r\n  to the form of a consent order or written stipulation signed by counsel and \r\n  entered in the record, or unless made in open court and noted upon the record.â€Â  \r\n  The Bank argues this rule applies and therefore, the settlement agreement is \r\n  unenforceable because it was neither entered into the record nor filed with \r\n  the court.Â  \r\nWhile it is true the actual agreement was not entered \r\n  into the record, the Bank admitted there was an agreement.Â  Following a comment \r\n  by the trial judge that there was no question the parties entered into an agreement, \r\n  the Bank responded, â€œ[s]ure, Your Honor, and we donâ€™t contend that this isnâ€™t \r\n  a binding settlement by any means.â€Â  A short time later, the Bank again admitted \r\n  the agreementâ€™s existence when it explained, â€œ[w]eâ€™re not trying to get out \r\n  of, of the settlement agreement here, Your Honor.â€Â  Because, Rule 43(k) does \r\n  not apply when an agreement is admitted or has been carried into effect, it \r\n  does not render this settlement unenforceable.Â  See Ashfort Corp. \r\n  v. Palmetto Constr. Group, Inc., 318 S.C. 492, 494 n.1, 458 S.E.2d 533, \r\n  534 n.1 (1995).Â  \r\nThe Bank also contends the circuit court erred \r\n  in failing to rule that a condition precedent to the refinancing had not been \r\n  fulfilled and in ruling that the Bank unreasonably delayed examining Maceâ€™s \r\n  application.Â  Again, we disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina case law defines a condition precedent \r\n  as â€œany fact other than the lapse of time, which, unless excused, must exist \r\n  or occur before a duty of immediate performance arises.â€Â  Worley v. Yarborough \r\n  Ford, Inc., 317 S.C. 206, 210, 452 S.E.2d 622, 624&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994).Â  \r\n  Even assuming a condition precedent exists, the change in Maceâ€™s credit history \r\n  occurred during the delay between the settlement and loan approval.Â  The circuit \r\n  court found the Bank caused the delay, and it would be improper to allow the \r\n  Bank to gain from its wrongdoing.\r\nFurthermore, included in every contract, including \r\n  settlement agreements, is an implied covenant of fair dealing.Â  See Boddie-Noell \r\n  Properties, Inc. v. 42 Magnolia Pâ€™ship, 344 S.C. 474, 484, 544 S.E.2d 279, \r\n  284&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000); see also Allen v. Allen,&nbsp;301 \r\n  S.E.2d 514, 515-16&nbsp;(N.C. Ct. App. 1983).Â  In this case, the court found \r\n  the Bankâ€™s unreasonable delay prejudiced Maceâ€™s application.Â  \r\nIt took over two months from the settlement date \r\n  for the Bank to provide Mace with an application.Â  Although Mace improperly \r\n  completed the first application in pencil, he sent the Bank a proper application \r\n  on December 18, 2001.Â  The Bank took no action on this application for nearly \r\n  two months until it was denied based on Maceâ€™s credit history sometime after \r\n  February 11, 2002.Â  Counsel for the Bank conceded that what amounted to a five-month \r\n  delay between settlement and denial of the loan application was unusual, but \r\n  instead insisted there was no evidence the Bank deliberately delayed reviewing \r\n  the application.Â  While it is difficult to reconstruct the exact reasons for \r\n  the delay, we find there is ample evidence to support the courtâ€™s determination \r\n  that the Bank unreasonably delayed processing Maceâ€™s application.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-644","title":"Ellerbe v.

Pachak, Office of Appellate \r\n  Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, \r\n  Assistant Attorney General Christopher L. Newton, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â  Coleman Ellerbe appeals \r\n  the dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that, since \r\n  his petition failed to expressly allege he exhausted all state administrative \r\n  remedies, the circuit court was required to treat the petition as an application \r\n  for post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn September 1988, Appellant pled \r\n  guilty to murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  In 1995, Appellant \r\n  filed an application for PCR.Â  Following a hearing in March 1996, the application \r\n  was dismissed.Â  In 1999, Appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus \r\n  in the circuit court, claiming his trial attorney induced him into pleading \r\n  guilty by promising him a reduction in his sentence due to the absence of a \r\n  prior criminal record.Â  \r\nThe circuit court dismissed Appellantâ€™s \r\n  petition on two grounds. First, the court concluded that, because Appellant \r\n  failed to allege he had exhausted all available PCR remedies, the petition was \r\n  improper.Â  Second, the court found Appellantâ€™s claims were cognizable \r\n  under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-10 \r\n  to â€“120 (2003), and thus may not be raised in a petition for habeas corpus.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nUpon enactment in 1966, the Uniform Post \r\n  Conviction Procedure Act largely superseded and encompassed the habeas corpus \r\n  procedure provided by statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-10 to â€“120 \r\n  (2003); Gibson v. State, 329 S.C. 37, 41, 495 S.E.2d 426, 428 (1998).Â  \r\n  Although habeas corpus continues to be available as a constitutional remedy, \r\n  it is available only when other remedies, such as PCR, are inadequate or unavailable.Â  \r\n  See S.C. Const. art. 1, Â§ 18; Gibson, 329 S.C. at 41, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  at 428.Â  As such, â€œa matter which is cognizable under the Act may not be raised \r\n  by a petition for a writ of habeas corpus before the circuit or other lower \r\n  courts.â€Â  Simpson v. State, 329 S.C. 43, 46, 495 S.E.2d 429, 431 (1998).Â  \r\n  Furthermore, the Act is â€œbroadly inclusive and will rarely be inadequate or \r\n  unavailable to test the legality of [a] detention.â€Â  Gibson, 329 S.C. \r\n  at 41, 495 S.E.2d at 428; see also Simpson, 329 S.C. at \r\n  45-47, 495 S.E.2d at 430-31.\r\nBecause Appellantâ€™s petition alleges that \r\n  he was convicted in violation of the constitution, his claim is obviously cognizable \r\n  under the Act; thus, Appellant is procedurally barred from petitioning the circuit \r\n  court for a writ of habeas corpus.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(a)(1) \r\n  (2003); Keeler v. Mauney, 330 S.C. 568, 571, 500 S.E.2d 123, 124 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998).Â  â€œIf a person is procedurally barred, his only means of obtaining \r\n  state habeas corpus relief is to file a petition in the original jurisdiction \r\n  of the Supreme Court.â€Â  Keeler, 330 S.C. at 571, 500 S.E.2d at 124.Â  \r\n  The trial court properly dismissed Appellantâ€™s petition on this ground.\r\nAppellant correctly asserts that if a \r\n  petition for a writ of habeas corpus fails to allege that PCR remedies are unavailable, \r\n  inadequate, or have previously been exhausted, the petition should be treated \r\n  as a PCR application.Â  Gibson, 329 S.C. at 42, 495 S.E.2d at 428.Â Â  In \r\n  his petition, Appellant mentioned, albeit vaguely, the dismissal of his previous \r\n  PCR application.Â  Thus, the trial courtâ€™s determination that Appellant had not \r\n  alleged exhaustion of available PCR remedies could be construed as an erroneous \r\n  finding.Â  However, as stated above, the trial court dismissed the petition on \r\n  proper grounds in its additional ruling.Â  Moreover, had the action been treated \r\n  as a PCR application, as Appellant now requests, it would have been similarly \r\n  dismissed as time barred pursuant to the PCR statute of limitations.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (2003).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  ruling is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, CJ., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-645","title":"State v.

[1]   \r\nFACTS\r\nIn August 1989, Best Amusement, Inc., conveyed 2.075 \r\n  acres of property to Samuel L. McMullin and William M. Mattison.Â  In 1992, McMullen \r\n  and Mattison failed to pay taxes on the property. To settle the default, Anderson \r\n  County sold the easternmost acre to Vernon C. Ballard at a tax sale in October \r\n  1993.Â  Exactly one year later, following the statutory redemption period, Ballard \r\n  received his title.\r\nOn April 20, 1994, the federal government filed \r\n  a forfeiture action in the United States District Court for the District of \r\n  South Carolina against McMullen and Mattison for illegal drug activities.Â  The \r\n  complaint alleged McMullen and Mattison began purchasing cocaine from various \r\n  sources in 1984 and used money from cocaine sales to make the down payment on \r\n  the property. The complaint further alleged that the property should be forfeited \r\n  to the United States pursuant to 21 U.S.C.A. Â§ 881(a)(6) (1999).Â  Anderson County \r\n  was notified of the action on April 21, 1994.\r\nOn September 25, 1995, a forfeiture order was entered \r\n  whereby McMullen and Mattison forfeited their interest in the property to the \r\n  United States. On November 19, 1998, the United States Marshal for the District \r\n  of South Carolina sold the property.Â  Alvin K. Benson successfully bid on the \r\n  property and received a deed, releasing the United Statesâ€™ interest in the tract.Â  \r\n  A few months later, on February 26, 1999, the marshal executed a corrected deed \r\n  which specifically excluded the one-acre tract already sold by the County to \r\n  Ballard.Â  In late 2000, Ballard petitioned the circuit court for partition of \r\n  the property.Â  Benson responded, arguing the Marshalâ€™s sale conveyed title to \r\n  the entire property and was superior to Ballardâ€™s deed received from the county \r\n  tax sale.\r\nThe circuit court initially found for Benson.Â  \r\n  Ballard, however, filed a motion to alter or amend the order pursuant to Rule \r\n  52(b), SCRCP.Â  In support of his motion, Ballard submitted an affidavit from \r\n  Nancy Prince Mackey, Aiken County Treasurer, dated January 28, 2003. \r\n  [2] Â  Mackey asserted she conferred with the U.S. Attorney handling the \r\n  forfeiture and both agreed the United Statesâ€™ interest in the property was subject \r\n  to Ballardâ€™s deed.Â  After reviewing the affidavit, the circuit court withdrew \r\n  its earlier order. \r\nIn its final order, the circuit court recognized \r\n  Ballardâ€™s one-acre interest in the property.Â  After determining the property \r\n  could not be practically divided or partitioned, the court ordered it be appraised \r\n  and sold, with proceeds distributed between Benson and Ballard according to \r\n  their respective interests. This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination of title to real property is \r\n  at law.Â  Wigfall v. Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 60, 367 S.E.2d 156, 157 (1988).Â  \r\n  In an action at law tried without a jury, the trial judgeâ€™s factual findings \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or \r\n  controlled by an error of law; however, this court may correct errors of law \r\n  without deference to the lower court.Â  Simmons v. Bellamy, 349 S.C. 473, \r\n  476, 562 S.E.2d 687, 688 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBenson argues he gained title to the entire property, \r\n  including the one-acre tract the County sold to Ballard, by virtue of the 1998 \r\n  Marshalâ€™s sale.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe federal government secured its interest \r\n  in the property pursuant to 21 U.S.C.A. Â§ 881(a)(6) (1999), which provides that \r\n  any property furnished by any person in exchange of controlled substances is \r\n  subject to forfeiture by the United States.Â  When property is subject to forfeiture \r\n  for the violation of law, title vests absolutely in the sovereign at the date \r\n  of the illegal act. 21 U.S.C.A. Â§ 881(h) (1999).\r\nBenson argues that this relation back theory applies \r\n  here; thus, the forfeiture relates back to 1989, when McMullen and Mattison \r\n  used proceeds from controlled substances to purchase the property.Â  The corrected \r\n  deed issued to Benson by the U.S. Marshal, however, added an exclusion for the \r\n  acre that had already been sold by the County to Ballard. This supports the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s finding that the United States never acquired any interest in \r\n  the acre claimed by Ballard.\r\nAs noted previously, Ballard submitted an affidavit \r\n  from Mackey, the Anderson County treasurer, with his motion to reconsider. She \r\n  asserted the propertyâ€™s easternmost acre was sold at a tax sale to Ballard in \r\n  1993 and a deed was conveyed to him in 1994.Â  Since the sale, Ballard has paid \r\n  taxes on the parcel.Â  The remaining 1.075 acres was not sold to Benson until \r\n  1998.Â  Although there was some confusion on the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s part about the \r\n  description of the forfeited property, the matter was clarified in a conference \r\n  between Mackey and the U.S. Attorney handling the forfeiture action. The U.S. \r\n  Attorney agreed with the Mackey that the sale of the one-acre tract predated \r\n  the forfeiture and was not subject to forfeiture. The affidavit also confirms \r\n  that Benson had no interest in the one-acre tract. Â \r\nAssuming for the sake of argument the \r\n  federal government did gain an interest in the entire tract by forfeiture, Ballard \r\n  is protected by the innocent owner defense.Â  Ballard was never given any notice \r\n  of the forfeiture action.Â  At the time the action took place, the federal forfeiture \r\n  statute contained an exception which provided that â€œno property shall be forfeited \r\n  under this paragraph, to the extent of the interest of an owner, by reason of \r\n  any act or omission established by that owner to have been committed or omitted \r\n  without the knowledge or consent of that owner.â€ 21 U.S.C.A. Â§ 881(a)(6) (1999). \r\n  [3] Â  The South Carolina forfeiture statute contains similar language, providing \r\n  that the court may return any seized property to the owner if the owner shows \r\n  that he â€œwas not a consenting party to, or privy to, or did not have the knowledge \r\n  of, the use of the property which made it subject to seizure and forfeiture.â€Â  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§44-53-586 (2002).Â  \r\nWe note the overriding purposes of civil \r\n  drug forfeitures are deterrence and retribution.Â  Forfeitures are viewed by \r\n  the government as a necessary tool to deter drug trafficking, and are not intended \r\n  to punish innocent owners.Â  Michael D. Dautrich, The â€œInnocent Ownerâ€ \r\n  Defense in Civil Drug Forfeitures after United States v. 92 Buena \r\n  Vista Avenue: Still an Uphill Battle for Third-party Claimants, 3 Widener \r\n  J. Pub. L. 995 (1994).Â  With this in mind, we conclude Ballard qualifies as \r\n  an innocent owner as he had neither knowledge of, nor consented to, the illegal \r\n  activity leading to the forfeiture.Â  Though there is no case directly on this \r\n  point in South Carolina, other jurisdictions have held that a bonafide purchaser \r\n  is entitled to protection as an innocent owner.Â Â  See United States \r\n  v. One Single Family Residence Located at 6960 Miraflores Ave, 731 F. Supp. \r\n  1563, 1568 (S.D. Fla. 1990).\r\nBecause Benson failed to prove that the entire \r\n  tract had been forfeited to the United States and conveyed to him, the circuit \r\n  courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The affidavit was made part of the record without \r\n    objection. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Congress struck the innocent owner defense from Â§ 881(a)(6), which \r\n    became effective for any forfeiture commenced on or after 120 days from April \r\n    25, 2000.Â  See Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, Pub.L. No. \r\n    106-185, Â§ 21, 114 Stat. 202, 225 (2000).Â  However, the governmentâ€™s forfeiture \r\n    in this case predated the effective date for elimination of the innocent owner \r\n    defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-647","title":"State v.

Carr, of Charleston. for Appellant.\r\nWilliam P. Hatfield, Robert D. McKissick, of Florence,\r\nfor Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Marion Elizabeth \r\n  Morris appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting Timothy M. Carterâ€™s motion for \r\n  a new trial, arguing the trial court judge abused his discretion in considering \r\n  offers of settlement and in failing to view the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nCarter and Morris were involved in an \r\n  automobile accident on March 30, 2001.Â  At the time of the accident, Carter \r\n  was stopped at an intersection and was immediately preceded by the vehicle driven \r\n  by his wife.Â  After the traffic light turned green, Carter and his wife proceeded \r\n  forward, but both slowed for another vehicle turning in front of them.Â  After \r\n  the other driver made his turn, Carterâ€™s wife moved forward.Â  According to Carter, \r\n  he had taken his foot off the brakes but had not yet pressed the gas when he \r\n  was rear-ended by Morris.Â  \r\nThe impact from the collision caused \r\n  the rear axle of Carterâ€™s vehicle to bend and the back end to fly into the air.Â  \r\n  The front end of Morrisâ€™s car slid underneath Carterâ€™s SUV and sheared the cable \r\n  securing the spare tire underneath.Â  The tire was thrown between seventy-five \r\n  and one hundred feet before it landed in a nearby field.Â  The impact also pushed \r\n  Carterâ€™s vehicle between twenty-five and forty feet forward.Â  Following the \r\n  accident, Carter complained of injuries to his neck, back, and hands. \r\nAt trial, Morris admitted negligence \r\n  but contested the issues of proximate cause and damages.Â  The jury returned \r\n  a verdict in favor of Morris.Â  Carter immediately moved for a new trial under \r\n  the thirteenth juror doctrine and for a new trial absolute based on the gross \r\n  inadequacy of the verdict.Â  Morris opposed the motion, arguing there was contradictory \r\n  evidence regarding to causation and asserting that a new trial based on the \r\n  inadequacy of the verdict was inappropriate because Carter never moved for a \r\n  directed verdict.Â  In deciding the motion, the judge orally set forth the legal \r\n  principles for both the thirteenth juror and the new trial absolute doctrines.Â  \r\n  He further stated:\r\n\r\n The Court has to set aside, not being relevant, \r\n  any negotiation that takes place prior to trial or during the trial, but I canâ€™t \r\n  ignore the fact that I know there were negotiations and the Plaintiff didnâ€™t \r\n  think it was sufficient or adequate.Â  There are substantial offers that have \r\n  been made in this case by the Defendant and of course that doesnâ€™t become an \r\n  issue or question of law for a hearing.Â  But I know in the Defendantâ€™s attempt \r\n  to resolve it, evaluate it, and to make an offer of a substantial sum of money \r\n  and during the discovery period and the exchange of interrogatories and depositions \r\n  that the Defense, in their approach to the case, they had an exposure to liability \r\n  and they donâ€™t make substantial offers if they donâ€™t feel that the Plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  got [sic] a case, legitimate injury of proof as to carpal syndrome. That is \r\n  the crux of the case in the defense.Â  \r\n\r\nNo objection was made to the trial judgeâ€™s discussion \r\n  of settlement negotiations.\r\nThe trial judge granted the motion for \r\n  a new trial without stating under which doctrine.Â  From this order, Morris appeals.Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMorris first argues the \r\n  trial judge abused his discretion and committed an error of law by considering \r\n  settlement negotiations when he granted Carterâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  We \r\n  find this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nGenerally, an issue must be raised to and \r\n  ruled upon by the trial judge in order to be preserved for appellate review. \r\n  Â Talley v. South Carolina Higher Educ. Tuition Grants Comm., 289 S.C. \r\n  483, 487, 347 S.E.2d 99, 101 (1986).Â  A matter that was not raised to or ruled \r\n  upon by the trial court cannot be considered by this court.Â  Id. at 487, \r\n  347 S.E.2d at 101.Â  â€œWhere a question has not been decided by the lower court, \r\n  this court will not consider it on appeal.â€Â  Mason v. Gossett, 303 S.C. \r\n  466, 468, 401 S.E.2d 425, 426 (Ct. App. 1991) (citations omitted).Â  \r\nIn Mason, the appellant \r\n  argued that the trial judge erred in granting a new trial solely on damages, \r\n  as opposed to granting a new trial on damages and liability, because such a \r\n  ruling was in violation of a statute and because the issues were so inextricably \r\n  intertwined that they should be tried together.Â  This court found the issues \r\n  not preserved for appeal because the appellant made no objection to the judgeâ€™s \r\n  grant of a new trial on damages alone and because the arguments raised on appeal \r\n  were not raised to the trial court by Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Id. at 467-68, \r\n  401 S.E.2d at 426.Â Â  The court noted that because the issue concerning the statutory \r\n  violation was not raised, that point of law was not ruled upon.Â  Id. \r\n  at 468, 401 S.E.2d at 426.\r\nSimilarly, in this case, the \r\n  issue concerning improper consideration of settlement negotiations was not raised \r\n  to the trial judge by objection at the time of the statement.Â  After Carter \r\n  moved for a new trial, the judge set forth his reasons for granting the new \r\n  trial on the record.Â Â  The judge reasoned initially that he could not consider \r\n  settlement negotiations because they were irrelevant, but then stated that â€œI \r\n  canâ€™t ignore the fact that I know there were negotiations and the Plaintiff \r\n  didnâ€™t think it was sufficient or adequate.â€Â  Morris did not contemporaneously \r\n  object to the judgeâ€™s consideration of the settlement negotiations.Â  Because \r\n  this particular objection was not ruled upon by the trial court, it is not preserved \r\n  for appeal.Â  See id.; see also Portman v. Garbade, \r\n  337 S.C. 186, 189, 90, 522 S.E.2d 830, 832 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding argument \r\n  that judge improperly considered evidence outside the scope of Rule 12(B)(6) \r\n  when granting the motion to dismiss not preserved for appeal when the issue \r\n  was not raised to or ruled on by the trial judge either by objection or by Rule \r\n  59(e) motion).Â  \r\nMorris also contends the trial judge erred \r\n  by failing to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  party when he granted Carterâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder the thirteenth juror \r\n  doctrine, â€œa trial judge may grant a new trial upon the facts if the judge determines \r\n  the verdict â€˜is contrary to the fair preponderance of the evidence.â€™â€Â  McEntire \r\n  v. Mooregard Exterminating Servs., Inc.,Â  353 S.C. 629, 631, 578 S.E.2d \r\n  746, 74 (Ct. App. 2003) (quoting Dent v. Redd, 270 S.C. 585, 586, 243 \r\n  S.E.2d 460, 460 (1978)).Â  The trial judge weighs the evidence and does not view \r\n  it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  \r\nHowever, the trial court may also grant \r\n  a new trial if the verdict is excessive or inadequate.Â  Rush v. Blanchard, \r\n  310 S.C. 375, 379, 426 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1993).Â  â€œThe trial court should grant \r\n  a new trial based on the excessiveness of the verdict only if the amount is \r\n  not merely different from that which he would have awarded, but is so grossly \r\n  excessive so as to shock the conscience of the court and clearly indicates that \r\n  the figure reached was the result of caprice, passion, prejudice, partiality, \r\n  corruption, or other improper motives.â€ Id. at 379-80, 426 S.E.2d at \r\n  805. The trial judge must consider the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the non-moving party.Â  McEntire, 353 S.C. at 631, 578 S.E.2d at 748.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAs a threshold matter, we must determine \r\n  whether the trial judge granted the motion for a new trial under the thirteenth \r\n  juror doctrine or as a new trial absolute.Â  Neither the judgeâ€™s oral order nor \r\n  his written order specifies under which doctrine he granted the new trial.Â Â  \r\n  However, it is axiomatic that a party must first be found entitled to damages \r\n  before the amount of damages can be determined or challenged as inadequate.Â  \r\n  Therefore, we find the judge could only have granted a new trial based on the \r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine because a new trial absolute based on the gross inadequacy \r\n  of the verdict is improper when the verdict is in favor of the non-moving party.Â Â  \r\n  See Harrison v. Bevilacqua,&nbsp; 354 S.C. 129, 140, 580 S.E.2d \r\n  109, 115&nbsp;(2003) (â€œIf the amount of the verdict is grossly inadequate \r\n  or excessive so as to be the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, or some \r\n  other influence outside the evidence, the trial judge must grant a new trial \r\n  absolute.â€ (emphasis added)); Trivelas v.

Pat Paschal, Jr. and James H. Price, III, both of Greenville, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nKenneth C. Porter, of Greenville ,for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  In this contempt action, Janice \r\n  Elaine Garrett (â€œWifeâ€) claimed Jerry Neill Marsh [1]  (â€œHusbandâ€) violated their separation agreement by improperly \r\n  deducting from her share of rental income monies expended by Husband on improvements \r\n  made without her prior approval. The family court found Husband in contempt \r\n  and ordered him to reimburse Wife for the deductions made in 2001.Â  By motion \r\n  to reconsider, Wife sought to introduce evidence of deductions from rental income \r\n  made during the years 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000.Â  The family court granted \r\n  her request for the years 1999 and 2000, but barred her claims to monies for \r\n  the years 1997 and 1998.Â  The family court found Wifeâ€™s claims were barred by \r\n  res judicata.Â  Wife appeals.Â  Because Husband never pled the defense of res \r\n  judicata, we reverse. [2] Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were \r\n  divorced on November 14, 1996.Â  The final order of divorce incorporated Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  the partiesâ€™ separation agreement by reference.Â  Among other provisions, \r\n  the separation agreement provided for certain assets to be sold and the net \r\n  sale proceeds to be divided between the parties.Â  The agreement also contemplated \r\n  that some of the assets would generate rental income and provided for the rental \r\n  income to be used to pay certain expenses, including necessary maintenance or \r\n  repairs, and for any surplus to be divided between the parties.Â  The agreement \r\n  stipulated that such repairs must first be approved by both parties in writing.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn January of 1999, Wife filed \r\n  a complaint seeking to hold Husband in contempt for his failure to comply with \r\n  certain terms of the separation agreement.Â  Wife alleged, among other things, \r\n  that Husband â€œfailed to account for all the income and expenses on all the properties \r\n  and further performed maintenance and/or repairs which were not approved, by \r\n  both parties in writing.â€Â  At the contempt hearing, the judge permitted Wife \r\n  to present five of the allegations asserted in her complaint, but did not permit \r\n  Wife to present the issue concerning expenses from maintenance and repairs.Â  \r\n  The court stated at the hearing:Â  â€œIf I get an amended ruling, Iâ€™ll hear the \r\n  rest of it.Â  Iâ€™m going to set yâ€™all [sic] to come in at two oâ€™clock on December \r\n  11th, thatâ€™s a Monday.â€Â  In his written order, the court â€œfinds this \r\n  matter should be rescheduled and is rescheduled for December 11, 2000 at 2:00 \r\n  p.m. for the matter to be completely tried with these remaining issues and any \r\n  other issues to be brought up by the parties.â€Â  Following this written order, \r\n  Wife moved to dismiss her rule to show cause and â€œthe remaining issues raised \r\n  therein with prejudice.â€Â  The court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice.Â  \r\n\r\nOn May 8, 2001, Wife filed another \r\n  complaint seeking to hold Husband in contempt for, among other allegations, \r\n  continuing to make repairs to an office building without prior approval by Wife.Â  \r\n  The complaint and amended complaint stated that this issue was â€œpreviously before \r\n  the Court on a Rule to Show Cause.â€Â  At the hearing on contempt, the judge found \r\n  Husband in contempt for deducting from rents due to Wife, monies Husband expended \r\n  on renovations to the office building without the prior approval of Wife.Â  The \r\n  judge did not permit the introduction of any documentation concerning the amounts \r\n  deducted by Husband.Â  After Wifeâ€™s counsel clarified his argument to the judge, \r\n  and Husbandâ€™s counsel conceded that it was improper for Husband to deduct the \r\n  expenses from Wifeâ€™s rental income, Wifeâ€™s counsel stated:Â  â€œI wonâ€™t submit \r\n  those papers then, Your Honor.â€Â  \r\nThe judge found Husband in contempt for \r\n  deducting expenses for repairs from Wifeâ€™s rental income without prior approval \r\n  of Wife.Â  Both Wife and Husband submitted proposed orders.Â  Wifeâ€™s order contained \r\n  figures demonstrating the amounts Husband deducted from Wifeâ€™s rental income \r\n  for the years 1997 through 2001.Â  Husbandâ€™s order contained figures for the \r\n  year 2001 only.Â  The judge accepted the figures as presented by Husband for \r\n  the year 2001 only, and ordered Husband to reimburse Wife $20,120.67.Â  \r\nWife filed a Rule 59(e) motion requesting \r\n  an opportunity to introduce evidence regarding the amount of expenses deducted \r\n  from Wifeâ€™s rental income.Â  At the hearing on the motion, Husband did not dispute \r\n  the figures as presented by Wife for the years 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000.Â  \r\n  Rather, Husband argued that Wifeâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion should be denied because \r\n  of the dismissal with prejudice of Wifeâ€™s 1999 rule to show cause and â€œthe remaining \r\n  issues raised therein.â€Â  The court granted Wifeâ€™s motion for reconsideration \r\n  and found that Wife was entitled to the expenses deducted for the years 1999 \r\n  and 2000, in addition to those from the year 2001 previously ordered.Â  However, \r\n  the court denied the motion with respect to the years 1997 and 1998, finding \r\n  Wifeâ€™s claims to monies owed from those years were barred by the order granting \r\n  Wife a dismissal of her 1999 rule to show cause with prejudice.Â  From this order, \r\n  Wife appeals. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, \r\n  we have authority to find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d \r\n  616, 617 (1981).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to \r\n  disregard the findings of the lower court.Â  Id.Â  Neither are we required \r\n  to ignore the fact that the trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses, was \r\n  in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign weight to their \r\n  testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 \r\n  (1981).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife argues the family court erred in \r\n  denying her motion for reconsideration with respect to monies owed during the \r\n  years 1997 and 1998 on the basis of res judicata because the issue concerning \r\n  expenses for repairs was not raised in any previous proceeding or prior pleading.Â  \r\n  Wife also argues in her reply brief that Husband was precluded from asserting \r\n  res judicata at the Rule 59(e) hearing because he raised this defense for the \r\n  first time at the hearing.Â  We agree.\r\nA case that is dismissed â€œwith prejudiceâ€ \r\n  indicates adjudication on the merits and prohibits subsequent litigation by \r\n  res judicata as if the action had been tried to final adjudication.Â  See \r\n  Nelson v. QHG of South Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 290, 311, 580 S.E.2d \r\n  171, 182 (Ct. App. 2003) (citations omitted).Â  â€œRes judicata requires three \r\n  elements: (1) the judgment must be final, valid and on the merits; (2) the parties \r\n  in the subsequent action must be identical in the first; (3) the second action \r\n  must involve matters properly included in the first action.â€Â  Latimer v. \r\n  Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 385, 602 S.E.2d 32, 37 (2004).Â  â€œRes judicata is an \r\n  affirmative defense that must be pled at trial in order to be pursued on appeal. \r\n  An affirmative defense is waived if not pled.â€ RIM Assocs. v. Blackwell, \r\n  359 S.C. 170, 182, 597 S.E.2d 152, 159 (Ct. App. 2004) (citations omitted).Â  \r\n  Moreover, defenses not presented in the pleadings will not be considered on \r\n  appeal.Â  Id. at 182-83, 597 S.E.2d at 159.\r\nIn this case, Wife asserted in her 1999 \r\n  complaint for contempt that Husband â€œfailed to account for all the income and \r\n  expenses on all the properties and further performed maintenance and/or repairs \r\n  which were not approved, by both parties in writing.â€Â  Wife voluntarily dismissed \r\n  this complaint with prejudice.Â  Wife sought to hold Husband in contempt again \r\n  in her 2001 complaint for continuing to make repairs to an office building without \r\n  prior approval by Wife.Â  Wifeâ€™s complaint and amended complaint stated that \r\n  this issue was â€œpreviously before the Court on a Rule to Show Cause.â€Â  Husband \r\n  answered the 2001 complaint admitting he made repairs to the building but denying \r\n  he was seeking reimbursement for the costs of the repairs.Â  Husband never asserted \r\n  res judicata as a defense to Wifeâ€™s claims in his answer or at the hearing on \r\n  the merits; rather, Husband raised it for the first time on reconsideration.Â  \r\n  As a result, we find Husband waived his right to assert the defense of res judicata.Â  \r\n  See RIM Assocs., 359 S.C. at 182-83, 597 S.E.2d at 159.Â  Â Accordingly, \r\n  we find the judge erred in denying Wifeâ€™s claims for monies owed during the \r\n  years 1997 and 1998.Â  \r\nBecause the parties stipulated the facts \r\n  at the Rule 59(e) hearing and Husband conceded to deducting from Wifeâ€™s rental \r\n  income $14,500 for renovations made without Wifeâ€™s prior approval in 1997 and \r\n  $10,350 in 1998, we find Wife entitled to reimbursement from Husband for those \r\n  funds in addition to the funds from the years 1999, 2000, and 2001 as previously \r\n  ordered.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\n GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Jerry Neill Marsh died while this litigation was pending.Â  The â€œEstate \r\n    of Jerry Neil Marshâ€ has been substituted as a party.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-651","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of \r\n  Columbia; and Solicitor Walter M. Bailey, Jr., of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  John Henry Chancy appeals his \r\n  conviction for attempted armed robbery.Â  He argues the trial court erred by \r\n  denying his motion for a directed verdict and in admitting identification evidence \r\n  that was unduly suggestive and presented a substantial likelihood of misidentification.Â  \r\n  We affirm. [1]   \r\nFACTS\r\nCatherine Winningham worked for Home \r\n  Insurance Agency in Holly Hill.Â  Her office was divided into two distinct offices:Â  \r\n  one room with a waist-high counter where she handled insurance matters, and \r\n  a separate room where Western Union exchanges were handled.Â  The office was \r\n  well lit by both natural and fluorescent lighting.Â  Around 4:00 p.m. on September \r\n  24, 2001, a tall, light-skinned black male and a short black male walked into \r\n  the insurance agency.Â  The tall male stood by the front door while the short \r\n  male approached the counter and asked Winningham for a quote on insurance.Â  \r\n  Winningham walked to her computer to get a quote.Â  When she turned around to \r\n  ask the short male for some information, he jumped over the counter and pointed \r\n  a gun in Winninghamâ€™s face.Â  Winningham began to scream, ignoring the short \r\n  maleâ€™s orders to be quiet and get on the floor.Â  The tall, light-skinned \r\n  male stood approximately seventy-two inches from Winningham for the ten-minute \r\n  duration of the encounter. Winningham testified she got a very good look at \r\n  him.Â  Winninghamâ€™s screams alerted Mary Jane Goodine in the parking lot, and \r\n  the two males fled the building without taking anything.Â  Nearby police officers \r\n  witnessed the two men running from the office and a chase ensued.Â  Alvin William \r\n  Sumpter and John Henry Chancy were arrested a short time thereafter. \r\nWinningham gave police an oral description of the \r\n  two men.Â  She stated the one with the gun had a dark complexion and wore dark \r\n  clothes, and the second man was a tall, light-skinned black man wearing light \r\n  clothes.Â  The next day, police summoned Winningham to the station to view a \r\n  photo lineup.Â  The lineup was comprised of six pictures of black males.Â  Five \r\n  of the men in the photographs had dark skin and one had significantly lighter \r\n  skin.Â Â Â  After viewing the photos for two minutes, Winningham positively identified \r\n  the light-skinned individual, Chancy, as the tall man who stood near the door.Â Â Â  \r\n  Winningham testified she recognized Chancy from the view she had of him â€œin \r\n  the office that day.â€Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt trial, Winningham testified she observed the \r\n  short male wearing a blue shirt and dark jeans and the tall male wearing jeans \r\n  and a light gray sweatshirt.Â  Winningham testified that after the short male \r\n  jumped over the counter, she knew that the man did not want a quote and she \r\n  was going to be robbed.Â  She stated that cash was not kept in the insurance \r\n  office because there was a separate room where it was kept.Â  When asked whether \r\n  the gunman ever asked her for cash or her purse, Winningham stated: â€œHe couldnâ€™t \r\n  get me to stop screaming enough, I donâ€™t think, to ask me anything.â€Â  \r\nMary Jane Goodine testified that as she \r\n  was leaving the insurance agency, she passed the two males entering.Â  She stated \r\n  she was standing in the parking lot when she heard Winningham start to scream.Â  \r\n  Goodine screamed â€œrobbery, robbery, robbery,â€ to get the attention of the nearby \r\n  police officer directing traffic.Â  The two men bumped into Goodine as they ran \r\n  out of the insurance agency.Â  Goodine described the two men to police as a short \r\n  male wearing a blue jogging jacket or shirt and a taller male wearing a dark \r\n  gray sweatshirt.Â  \r\nAt trial, Chancy admitted he was at the \r\n  office and was waiting by the door while a dark-skinned individual spoke with \r\n  Winningham.Â  He stated he wore a gray sweater jacket and black jogging pants.Â  \r\n  Chancy testified he ran out of the office because he panicked, but that he had \r\n  no involvement in the attempted robbery.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nChancy made a pretrial motion to exclude \r\n  Winninghamâ€™s identification arguing the photo lineup was unduly suggestive.Â  \r\n  After hearing in camera testimony and arguments, the trial court denied the \r\n  motion.Â  At the close of the Stateâ€™s case, Chancy moved for a directed verdict, \r\n  arguing there was no evidence of intent to commit a robbery because there was \r\n  no request for money.Â  The trial court denied the motion, finding there was \r\n  substantial circumstantial evidence that Chancyâ€™s intent was to commit a robbery. \r\n  Chancy renewed his motions and objections after all evidence had been presented.Â  \r\n  The jury convicted Chancy of attempted armed robbery.Â  The trial court sentenced \r\n  him to twenty years imprisonment.Â  Chancy appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nChancy argues the trial court \r\n  erred in failing to grant his motion for a directed verdict because there was \r\n  no evidence that the gunman intended to take money or goods or that there was \r\n  any money or goods to take in order to commit a robbery.Â  We disagree. [2] Â  \r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed \r\n  verdict, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the State.Â  State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 583, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 \r\n  (2001); State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 46, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999); \r\n  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998).Â  When ruling \r\n  on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence \r\n  of evidence, not its weight.Â  Burdette, 335 S.C. at 46, 515 S.E.2d at \r\n  531; State v. Wakefield, 323 S.C. 189, 197, 473 S.E.2d 831, 835 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â  â€œIf there is any direct or any substantial circumstantial evidence \r\n  reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must \r\n  find the case was properly submitted to the jury.â€Â  Lollis, 343 S.C. \r\n  at 584, 541 S.E.2d at 256.Â  Conversely, a trial court should grant a motion \r\n  for a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a suspicion the accused \r\n  is guilty.Â  Id. at 584, 541 S.E.2d at 256.Â Â  \r\nâ€œRobbery is defined as the felonious or \r\n  unlawful taking of money, goods or other personal property of any value from \r\n  the person of another or in his presence by violence or by putting such person \r\n  in fear.â€Â  State v. Bland, 318 S.C. 315, 317, 457 S.E.2d 611, 612 (1995).Â  \r\n  It is a felony to commit robbery while armed with a deadly weapon.Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A) (2003).Â  Attempted armed robbery is also a felony.Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(B) (2003) (â€œA person who commits attempted armed robbery \r\n  while armed with a pistol . . . or other deadly weapon, . . . is guilty of a \r\n  felony . . . .â€).Â  Attempted armed robbery is defined as acts towards the commission \r\n  of a robbery with the intent to commit the robbery, but the act falls short \r\n  of actual completion.Â  State v. Hiott, 276 S.C. 72, 80, 276 S.E.2d 163, \r\n  167 (1981).Â  The â€œactâ€ towards the commission of the robbery is to be liberally \r\n  construed, and it is sufficient if the act goes â€œfar enough toward accomplishment \r\n  of the crime to amount to the commencement of its consummation.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Quick, 199 S.C. 256, 259, 19 S.E.2d 101, 102 (1942).\r\nThis court has addressed acts sufficient \r\n  to constitute attempted armed robbery.Â  In State v. Nesbitt, 346 S.C. \r\n  226, 550 S.E.2d 864 (Ct. App. 2001), an armed and masked man approached the \r\n  front door of a convenience store, waiving a gun.Â  The gunman did not point \r\n  the gun at anyone, he did not enter the store, and he fled the scene within \r\n  seconds.Â  Nesbitt was charged and convicted of attempted armed robbery.Â  In \r\n  affirming the trial courtâ€™s denial of Nesbittâ€™s motion for a directed verdict, \r\n  we addressed the intent requirements of attempt crimes:\r\n\r\nAttempt crimes are generally ones of specific intent such \r\n  that the act constituting the attempt must be done with the intent to commit \r\n  that particular crime.Â  State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 532 S.E.2d 283 \r\n  (2000).Â  â€œIn the context of an â€˜attemptâ€™ crime, specific intent means that the \r\n  defendant consciously intended the completion of acts comprising the choate \r\n  offense.Â  In other words, the completion of such acts is the defendantâ€™s purpose.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 397, 532 S.E.2d at 285 (citing United States v. Calloway, \r\n  116 F.3d 1129 (6th Cir. 1997)).Â  Additionally, the State must prove that the \r\n  defendantâ€™s specific intent was accompanied by some overt act, beyond mere preparation, \r\n  in furtherance of the intent, and there must be an actual or present ability \r\n  to complete the crime.Â  State v. Evans, 216 S.C. 328, 57 S.E.2d 756 (1950);Â  \r\n  State v. Quick, 199 S.C. 256, 19 S.E.2d 101 (1942).Â  â€œThe preparation \r\n  consists in devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission \r\n  of the crime; the attempt or overt act is the direct movement toward the commission, \r\n  after the preparations are made.â€Â  Quick, 199 S.C. at 260, 19 S.E.2d \r\n  at 103.\r\n\r\nNesbitt, 346 S.C. at 231, 550 S.E.2d at 866.Â  \r\n  This court determined a jury could infer from the evidence that â€œan armed robbery \r\n  was immediately forthcoming, or that the attempt had begun.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  234, 550 S.E.2d at 868.\r\nViewing the evidence \r\n  in the light most favorable to the State, evidence existed that reasonably tended \r\n  to prove Sumpter and Chancy had the intent to commit armed robbery.Â  Sumpter \r\n  jumped over the counter, pointed a gun at Winningham, and demanded that she \r\n  get down on the floor while Chancy waited by the door.Â  Although Sumpter and \r\n  Chancy fled the scene prior to making a demand for money and any money available \r\n  was located in another room, the act of pointing the gun at Winningham was an \r\n  overt act towards completing the crime of armed robbery.Â  As in Nesbitt, \r\n  the jury in the present case could infer from the evidence that the gunman was \r\n  attempting to commit armed robbery.Â  \r\nBecause the intent to commit armed robbery can \r\n  be inferred from the circumstantial evidence in this case, we find the trial \r\n  court did not abuse its discretion in submitting this case to the jury.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny the motion for a directed verdict is affirmed.\r\nII.\r\nChancy next argues the trial court erred in denying \r\n  his motion to suppress the photo lineup identification because it was unnecessarily \r\n  suggestive and there was a substantial likelihood of misidentification.Â  We \r\n  disagree.\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits \r\n  to review errors of law only. State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 147, \r\n  199 S.E.2d 61, 65 (1973).Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings \r\n  unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 \r\n  S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000).Â  Concerning the admission of evidence, \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s determination will be sustained absent error and resulting \r\n  prejudice.Â  State v. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, 353, 543 S.E.2d 586, \r\n  591 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nA criminal defendant may be deprived of due process \r\n  of law by an identification procedure that is unnecessarily suggestive and conducive \r\n  to irreparable mistaken identification.Â  Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, \r\n  196 (1972).Â  â€œ[T]he central question for determining the admissibility of pretrial \r\n  identification is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the procedure \r\n  was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood \r\n  of misidentification.â€Â  State v. Washington, 323 S.C. 106, 110, 473 S.E.2d \r\n  479, 481 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Consequently, the United States Supreme Court has \r\n  developed a two-prong inquiry to determine the admissibility of an out-of-court \r\n  identification.Â  Neil, 409 U.S. at 198.Â  First, the court must determine \r\n  whether the identification process was unduly suggestive.Â  If the court answers \r\n  this question in the affirmative, then it must determine whether the out-of-court \r\n  identification was nevertheless so reliable that no substantial likelihood of \r\n  misidentification existed.Â  State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 287, 540 S.E.2d \r\n  445, 447 (2000) (citing Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972)).Â  \r\n  Courts should consider the totality of the circumstances when employing the \r\n  test.Â  Neil, 409 U.S. at 199.Â  â€œEven if some degree of suggestiveness \r\n  exists in the pre-trial identification, suppression of the identification is \r\n  not automatically required.Â  Suggestiveness alone does not mandate the exclusion \r\n  of evidence.â€Â  State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 229, 522 S.E.2d 845, \r\n  852 (Ct. App. 1999) (citations omitted).Â  â€œ[R]eliability is the linchpin in \r\n  determining the admissibility of identification testimony.â€ Manson v. Brathwaite, \r\n  432 U.S. 98, 114 (1977).\r\n\r\nThe following factors are to be considered in evaluating the totality of the \r\n  circumstances as to whether an identification is admissible: \r\n  \r\n[T]he opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the \r\n  time of the crime, the witnessâ€™ degree of attention, the accuracy of the witnessâ€™ \r\n  prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the \r\n  witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the \r\n  confrontation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeil, 409 U.S. at 199; Moore, 343 S.C. at 289, 540 S.E.2d \r\n  at 448-49.Â Â  The corrupting effect of a suggestive identification is to be weighed \r\n  against these factors.Â  Manson, 432 U.S. at 114.\r\nThe trial court did not make a separate ruling \r\n  on each prong but found that under the totality of the circumstances, the photo \r\n  lineup was not so unnecessarily suggestive as to result in misidentification.Â  \r\n  The trial court noted that Winningham testified in camera that she identified \r\n  Chancy based on the view she had of him on the day of the attempted robbery. \r\n\r\nWe find no reversible error in the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  holding.Â  However, it is patent the photo lineup was unduly suggestive.Â  Winningham \r\n  was asked to identify a suspect she described as a light-skinned black man from \r\n  six photographs containing only one light-skinned individual.Â  The police officer \r\n  who showed Winningham the photo lineup testified that it was suggestive.Â Â Â  \r\n  The record reveals Chancyâ€™s photo clearly stood out from the others.Â  \r\nEven though the identification process was unduly \r\n  suggestive, no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed.Â  Reviewing \r\n  the Neil v. Biggers factors, we find a high degree of reliability regarding \r\n  the identification.Â  Neil, 409 U.S. at 199.Â  First, Winningham had the \r\n  opportunity to view Chancy at close range for some time.Â  Winningham testified \r\n  she viewed Chancy for at least ten minutes from a distance of seventy-two inches \r\n  on the day of the incident.Â  Second, Winninghamâ€™s attention was acute.Â  She \r\n  testified she got a very good look at Chancy, and she was the victim of the \r\n  crime.Â  Third, Winninghamâ€™s description of Chancy to the police on the day of \r\n  the incident was highly accurate.Â  She described her attacker as a tall, light-skinned \r\n  black man wearing light clothes.Â  Chancy matched this description and was apprehended \r\n  after police witnessed him fleeing the office.Â  Fourth, Winningham exhibited \r\n  a high degree of certainty when she positively identified Chancy after viewing \r\n  the photos for only two minutes.Â Â Â  Lastly, the length of time between the crime \r\n  and the photo lineup was merely one day.Â  \r\nPerhaps the best indication that Winninghamâ€™s identification \r\n  was highly reliable was the testimony of Chancy himself.Â  Chancy freely admitted \r\n  that he entered the office, stood by the door, and witnessed an attempted robbery \r\n  on the day in question.Â  Several police officers witnessed Chancy running from \r\n  the office, and one never lost sight of him until he was apprehended.Â  The only \r\n  reasonable inference that can be drawn from these facts is that Winningham correctly \r\n  identified Chancy.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court properly admitted the \r\n  pretrial identification.\r\nAccordingly, Chancyâ€™s conviction and sentence \r\n  are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues \r\n    on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â Â  Chancyâ€™s co-defendant with whom he was jointly tried appealed this \r\n    same issue.Â  The analysis for this issue follows this courtâ€™s unpublished \r\n    opinion, State v.

Moore, of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nRobert A. McKenzie and Gary H. \r\n  Johnson, II, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This case is an appeal from \r\n  a defense verdict rendered by a jury in a personal injury action arising from \r\n  a motor vehicle accident.Â  We affirm the circuit courtâ€™s denial of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nEnoch Beraho and Patricia Sinclair were involved \r\n  in a motor vehicle accident near the intersection of Rosewood Avenue and Assembly \r\n  Street in Columbia.Â  The basic facts are undisputed: Sinclair was driving west \r\n  on Rosewood Avenue approaching the intersection at Assembly Street.Â  At the \r\n  same time, Beraho was driving north on Assembly Street near the same intersection.Â  \r\n  Sinclair turned right onto Assembly Street, and, at some point shortly thereafter, \r\n  her vehicle collided with the rear end of Berahoâ€™s vehicle.Â  Beraho subsequently \r\n  brought the present personal injury action against Sinclair, seeking an award \r\n  of damages as a result of Sinclairâ€™s alleged negligence. \r\nSinclair denied she caused the accident.Â  At trial, \r\n  she testified the accident occurred immediately after she made a right turn \r\n  from Rosewood Avenue onto Assembly Street and was the result of Beraho having \r\n  stopped his vehicle in the street for no apparent reason.Â  Beraho presented \r\n  a different account: He testified the accident occurred approximately 150 yards \r\n  further down Assembly Street from the Rosewood Avenue intersection, and that \r\n  he did not abruptly stop in the street, but rather he claims he merely slowed \r\n  down near a railroad crossing.\r\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the circuit judge charged \r\n  the jury on the law of negligence and also the statutory prohibition against \r\n  stopping a car in a roadway.Â  The jury returned a special verdict form finding \r\n  that Beraho was 51 percent at fault and that Sinclair was 49 percent at fault.Â  \r\n  Beraho made post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), \r\n  new trial, and a new trial as to damages, all of which were denied by the circuit \r\n  court.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, \r\n  the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably \r\n  can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the \r\n  motions.â€ Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 \r\n  S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002). The motions must be denied by the trial court when the \r\n  evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt. Steinke \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, \r\n  386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999). On appeal from the denial of a motion for a \r\n  directed verdict or JNOV, this court will reverse the trial court only where \r\n  there is no evidence to support the ruling below. Id.; Creech v. South \r\n  Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 29, 491 S.E.2d 571, \r\n  573 (1997).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBeraho claims the circuit court erred \r\n  in denying his motion for JNOV, arguing there is no evidence that supports a \r\n  finding of any liability on the part of the plaintiff.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs noted above, the circuit judge charged \r\n  the jury on the prohibition against stopping a vehicle in a roadway which is \r\n  set out in South Carolina Code section 56-5-2510.Â  This statute provides that:\r\n\r\nNo person shall stop, park, or \r\n  leave standing a vehicle, whether attended or unattended, upon the roadway outside \r\n  a business or residential district when it is practicable to stop, park, or \r\n  leave the vehicle off the roadway. An unobstructed width of the highway opposite \r\n  a standing vehicle must be left for the free passage of other vehicles and a \r\n  clear view of the stopped vehicle must be available from a distance of two hundred \r\n  feet in each direction upon the highway.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2510(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nBeraho never raised \r\n  any objection to the circuit judge charging the jury on this law.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the propriety of this instruction and the ability of the jury to find liability \r\n  based on a violation of this statute is not before this court.Â  We are simply \r\n  left to determine whether there is any evidence to support such a finding of \r\n  liability. \r\nReviewing of the record before \r\n  us, it is clear there is sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude Beraho \r\n  stopped his car in the roadway in violation of section 56-5-2510.Â  Sinclairâ€™s \r\n  testimony that Beraho had completely and abruptly stopped in the middle of the \r\n  road was unequivocal.Â  Berahoâ€™s testimony, on the other hand, was vague and \r\n  conflicting.Â  Most notably, during cross-examination of Beraho, defense counsel \r\n  confronted Beraho with several material inconsistencies in his deposition and \r\n  trial testimony regarding the location of the accident and his memory of what \r\n  occurred immediately before and after the accident. Â The credibility \r\n  of the witnesses and the conclusions and inferences that may be drawn from their \r\n  testimony are matters left to the juryâ€™s consideration.Â  Therefore, we find \r\n  there is sufficient evidence in the record to sustain the circuit courtâ€™s denial \r\n  of Berahoâ€™s motion for JNOV. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find there is sufficient \r\n  evidence to support the juryâ€™s verdict in favor of Sinclair and therefore affirm \r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s denial of Berahoâ€™s motion for JNOV.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2004-UP-656","title":"Blue v.

Hicks Harwell, Jr., Circuit Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-656\r\nSubmitted November 1, 2004 â€“ Filed December \r\n  22, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nKenneth E. Merriman, of Florence, for Appellants.\r\nDaryl James Corbin, of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this action to recover damages \r\n  arising from a construction contract, Larry Harrelson and Nancy Harrelson, d/b/a \r\n  Angle Construction Company (the Harrelsons), appeal the trial judgeâ€™s entry \r\n  of judgment in favor of Victor L. Blue and Gail Blue (the Blues).Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1] \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Blues entered into a construction \r\n  contract with the Harrelsons on April 6, 1999.Â  The Harrelsons agreed to complete \r\n  construction of the Bluesâ€™ home no later than 265 days from the date of the \r\n  contract for a purchase price of $340,000.Â  In addition, the parties negotiated \r\n  a late-fee provision of $120 per day after December 28, 1999, if the home was \r\n  not complete.Â  The Harrelsons never completed the home.Â  During this time period, \r\n  the Blues were also subjected to litigation with the Shaw Lumber Company and \r\n  forced to refinance their home due to the Harrelsonsâ€™ failure to satisfy an \r\n  account that was designated for the Bluesâ€™ construction project.Â  \r\nOn November 22, 2000, the Blues filed this action, alleging breach of contract \r\n  with fraudulent intent, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and civil conversion.Â  \r\n  Underlying these causes of action, the Blues primarily asserted the Harrelsons \r\n  breached the contract by:Â  (1) failing to complete the construction within the \r\n  designated 265-day time period; (2) failing to construct the home in a workmanlike \r\n  manner; and (3) failing to pay the material suppliers and subcontractors involved \r\n  in the project.Â  The Blues sought relief of $150,000 in actual damages and $150,000 \r\n  in punitive damages. \r\nBecause the Harrelsons failed to answer or respond to the pleadings, the trial \r\n  judge entered an order of default on February 14, 2001.Â  This order provided \r\n  that â€œall allegations contained within the Plaintiffsâ€™ pleadings are deemed \r\n  true.â€Â  The judge denied the Harrelsonsâ€™ motion to set aside the entry of default.Â  \r\n  The judge then held a hearing solely on the amount of damages.\r\nThe judge found the \r\n  Blues were entitled to an award of actual damages â€œfor completion costs of construction \r\n  in a proper manner, reputational harms and damages, and emotional distress.â€Â  \r\n  The judge also concluded the Blues were entitled to â€œadditional damages under \r\n  its breach of contract theory given the [Harrelsonsâ€™] violation of the late-fee \r\n  provision for some of the period of time between December 28, 1999, and May \r\n  1, 2001.â€Â  The judge entered judgment in the amount of $50,000 for â€œbreach of \r\n  contract, violation of the late-fee penalty provision, negligence, breach of \r\n  fiduciary duties, and civil conversion.â€Â  The judge denied the Bluesâ€™ \r\n  request for punitive damages.\r\nSubsequently, the Harrelsons filed \r\n  a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  The judge denied the motion \r\n  and affirmed his previous ruling, explaining:\r\n\r\nIn considering damages, the Court based its consideration \r\n  on the causes of action contained in the Plaintiffâ€™s complaint:Â  breach of contract, \r\n  breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, conversion and emotional and reputational \r\n  harm.Â  The Courtâ€™s consideration of damages was also based on the following:Â  \r\n  delay in not complying with the construction completion date which was provided \r\n  for in the contract, injury to the Plaintiffâ€™s credit standing, including refinancing \r\n  with increased interest on the loan, assorted tools, including but not limited \r\n  to, saws, hammers and paint brushes that were charged to the Plaintiffs but \r\n  were never given to them, and those items charged to the building site that \r\n  were not found in the construction.\r\n\r\nThe Harrelsons appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis case presents \r\n  an action at law. See Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 \r\n  S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating an action for a breach of contract \r\n  seeking money damages is an action at law); see also Corley v. Ott, \r\n  326 S.C. 89, 92 n.1, 485 S.E.2d 97, 99 n.1 (1997) (recognizing an action for \r\n  breach of fiduciary duty is an action at law); Advance Intâ€™l, Inc. v. North \r\n  Carolina Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina, 316 S.C. 266, 271, 449 S.E.2d 580, \r\n  583 (Ct. App. 1994), affâ€™d in part and vacated in part, 320 S.C. 532, \r\n  466 S.E.2d 367 (1996) (action alleging, inter alia, fraud and negligence and \r\n  seeking damages is one at law); Blackwell v. Blackwell, 289 S.C. 470, \r\n  471, 346 S.E.2d 731, 732 (Ct. App. 1986)(â€œAn action for damages for conversion \r\n  is an action at law.â€).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, our scope \r\n  of review extends merely to the correction of errors of law.Â  Crary v. Djebelli, \r\n  329 S.C. 385, 388, 496 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1998).Â  Thus, the trial judgeâ€™s factual \r\n  findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless a review of the record discloses \r\n  that there is no evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings. Id.; \r\n  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d \r\n  773, 775 (1976).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nThe Harrelsons argue the trial judge erred \r\n  in failing to dismiss the Bluesâ€™ causes of action for civil conversion, negligence, \r\n  and breach of fiduciary duty.Â  As to each cause of action, the Harrelsons contend \r\n  the Blues failed to prove damages.Â  In conjunction with their civil conversion \r\n  argument, the Harrelsons claim there is no evidence to support the judgeâ€™s finding \r\n  that the Blues were damaged by the Harrelsons charging tools and materials to \r\n  an account with the Shaw Lumber Company, which was designated for the Bluesâ€™ \r\n  construction project. \r\nTo the extent the Harrelsons challenge \r\n  their liability, we find they are precluded from raising these issues due to \r\n  the entry of default. Â Because the Harrelsons were found in default, \r\n  they are deemed to have admitted the truth of the Bluesâ€™ allegations and conceded \r\n  liability.Â  See Roche v. Young Bros., Inc., of Florence, 332 S.C. \r\n  75, 81, 504 S.E.2d 311, 314 (1998) (â€œIt is well settled that by suffering a \r\n  default, the defaulting party is deemed to have admitted the truth of the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  allegations and to have conceded liability.â€); Howard v. Holiday Inns, Inc., \r\n  271 S.C. 238, 242, 246 S.E.2d 880, 882 (1978) (â€œBy defaulting, a defendant forfeits \r\n  his right to answer or otherwise plead to the complaint.Â  In essence, the defaulting \r\n  defendant has conceded liability.Â  However, a defaulting defendant does not \r\n  concede the amount of liability.â€) (citation omitted).\r\nDespite the entry of default, the Harrelsons may \r\n  raise, as they have done, issues regarding the sufficiency of the Bluesâ€™ pleadings \r\n  and their entitlement to damages under each cause of action.Â  See Masters \r\n  v. Rodgers Dev. Group, S.C., 283 S.C. 251, 254, 321 S.E.2d 194, 196 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1984) (holding defendant found in default was not precluded from challenging \r\n  the sufficiency of the plaintiffâ€™s complaint as a basis for judgment); see \r\n  also Mut. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. McKenzie, 274 S.C. 630, 632, 266 \r\n  S.E.2d 423, 424 (1980) (â€œA party seeking a default judgment is entitled to only \r\n  such relief as is framed by his pleading . . . It follows that if a complaint \r\n  fails to state a cause of action, the rendering of a default judgment thereon \r\n  is without authority of law and therefore reversible error.â€).Â  As will be discussed, \r\n  we find the Blues properly pled the alleged causes of action and there is evidence \r\n  to support the trial judgeâ€™s award of damages under each theory.Â  \r\nA.Â  \r\nConversion has been defined as \r\n  the unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods \r\n  or personal chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of the condition \r\n  or the exclusion of the ownerâ€™s rights.Â  Powell v. A.K. Brown Motor Co., \r\n  200 S.C. 75, 78, 20 S.E.2d 636, 637 (1942).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[c]onversion may \r\n  arise by some illegal use or misuse, or by illegal detention of anotherâ€™s personal \r\n  property.â€ Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 667, 582 S.E.2d 432, \r\n  442 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nA review of the Bluesâ€™ complaint \r\n  reveals that they sufficiently pled a cause of action for civil conversion.Â  \r\n  Specifically, the Blues alleged they â€œentrusted funds to the Harrelsons which \r\n  were supposed to have been used solely for satisfaction of labor and materials \r\n  costs involving construction of their home.â€ They further asserted the â€œHarrelsons \r\n  intentionally took the Bluesâ€™ money and used it for their own personal benefit \r\n  to the Bluesâ€™ detriment.â€Â  Finally, the Blues alleged the â€œHarrelsons converted \r\n  approximately $50,000 of the Bluesâ€™ money and have failed to return it to them.â€Â  \r\n\r\nNot only did the Blues properly plead \r\n  a cause of action for civil conversion, there is also evidence in the record \r\n  to support their entitlement to damages under this cause of action.Â  Mr. Blue \r\n  testified concerning their damages, which were outlined in a summary that was \r\n  admitted into evidence.Â  He testified the Harrelsons misused construction \r\n  funds to purchase tools and materials that were not used in the construction \r\n  of the home.Â  Thomas Robertson, a construction inspector, reviewed the invoices \r\n  from the Shaw Lumber Company and confirmed that items were designated for the \r\n  Bluesâ€™ construction projection but were not in fact used for the home.Â  Robertson \r\n  concluded that â€œmissingâ€ construction materials and tools worth $4,632.96 were \r\n  inappropriately charged to the Bluesâ€™ account.Â  Mrs. Harrelson admitted the \r\n  tools, valued at $1,513.22, were never given to the Blues.Â  She also testified \r\n  that she understood that by charging these items to the Shaw Lumber account \r\n  and specifying that they were to be used for the Bluesâ€™ construction, the Blues \r\n  would be subject to litigation if the invoices were not paid.Â  She acknowledged \r\n  the Blues were sued by Shaw Lumber Company and required to satisfy the debt.Â  \r\n  Mr. Blue testified they paid Shaw Lumber Company $55,000 in order to release \r\n  the lien.\r\nB.\r\nTo state a cause of action for negligence, the \r\n  plaintiff must allege facts that demonstrate:Â  (1) a duty of care owed by the \r\n  defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a breach of that duty by negligent act or omission; \r\n  (3) resulting damages to the plaintiff; and (4) the damages proximately resulted \r\n  from the breach of that duty.Â  Thomasko v. Poole, 349 S.C. 7, 11, 561 \r\n  S.E.2d 597, 599 (2002).Â  In their complaint, the Blues alleged the â€œHarrelsons \r\n  owed the Blues a duty to construct the house in a workmanlike manner and failed \r\n  to do so.â€Â  As part of this cause of action, the Blues incorporated other provisions \r\n  of their complaint.Â  In paragraphs six and seven of the complaint, the Blues \r\n  outlined the construction deficiencies and alleged the failure of the Harrelsons \r\n  to correct the deficiencies despite being ordered to do so by the South Carolina \r\n  Residential Builders Commission.Â  Furthermore, the Blues claimed that â€œ[d]ue \r\n  to the Harrelsonsâ€™ negligence, the Blues have incurred and will continue to \r\n  suffer from severe financial, emotional, and repuational harms and damages.â€Â  \r\n  Therefore, we find the Blues sufficiently stated a cause of action for negligence.\r\nThere is also evidence supporting the Bluesâ€™ entitlement \r\n  to damages pursuant to their cause of action for negligence.Â  During the presentation \r\n  of their case, the Blues offered the testimony of Robertson and John Kendall, \r\n  an investigator/inspector with the South Carolina Residential Home Builders \r\n  Commission (the Commission).Â  Kendall testified concerning the deficiencies \r\n  in the Harrelsonsâ€™ workmanship.Â  Based on his inspection, Kendall compiled two \r\n  reports, which listed items that needed to be corrected to the Bluesâ€™ home because \r\n  the work that was performed violated construction standards and building codes.Â  \r\n  The Commission also issued an order, pursuant to its review of the Bluesâ€™ complaint, \r\n  in which it prohibited the renewal of Mr. Harrelsonâ€™s building license until \r\n  the deficient work was corrected.Â  Robertson also testified regarding \r\n  construction items that were either incomplete or not satisfactorily completed.Â  \r\n  As a result of these alleged deficiencies, Robertson testified about the costs \r\n  incurred by the Blues to correct the construction problems, which included warped \r\n  hardwood floors and roof flashing problems.Â  Furthermore, in explaining \r\n  the damage summary exhibit, Mr. Blue testified about the damages that he and \r\n  his wife incurred due to the defective construction.Â Â Â  \r\nC.\r\nIn terms of the Bluesâ€™ cause of action for breach \r\n  of fiduciary duty, â€œit is well-settled equitable rule that anyone acting in \r\n  a fiduciary relationship shall not be permitted to make use of that relationship \r\n  to benefit his own personal interests.â€ Island Car Wash, Inc. v. Norris, \r\n  III, 292 S.C. 595, 599, 358 S.E.2d 150, 152 (Ct. App. 1987); see \r\n  Hendricks v. Clemson Univ., 353 S.C. 449, 458, 578 S.E.2d 711, 715 (2003) \r\n  (â€œHistorically, this Court has reserved imposition of fiduciary duties to legal \r\n  or business settings, often in which one person entrusts money to another.â€).Â  \r\n  In support of this cause of action, the Blues properly alleged that they â€œentrusted \r\n  the Harrelsons with their construction funds; and the parties had a special \r\n  fiduciary relationship during the construction project.Â  Accordingly, the Harrelsons \r\n  had a fiduciary relationship with the Blues and were required to use the construction \r\n  funds solely to satisfy costs involving the Bluesâ€™ project.â€Â  The Blues further \r\n  asserted that the â€œHarrelsons owed the Blues duties of honesty, loyalty, and \r\n  fair-dealing,â€ and that they breached their fiduciary duty â€œby taking their \r\n  construction funds and using the money for purposes other than paying the Bluesâ€™ \r\n  construction costs.â€Â  The complaint further stated, â€œ[a]s a proximate result \r\n  and consequence of the Harrelsonsâ€™ breach of fiduciary duties, the Blues have \r\n  incurred and will continue to suffer from substantial additional construction \r\n  and repair costs, financing and interest expenses, litigation costs, and emotional \r\n  and reputational harms and damages.â€ \r\nAs to damages, there is evidence in the record \r\n  to support the trial judgeâ€™s conclusion that the Blues were entitled to recover \r\n  under their cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  As previously discussed, \r\n  the Blues, through their own testimony and that of Robertson, established that \r\n  the Harrelsons inappropriately charged materials and tools at the Shaw Lumber \r\n  Company and designated them for the Bluesâ€™ construction project.Â  Mrs. Harrelson \r\n  admitted that the tools were never given to the Blues.Â  Although the Harrelsons \r\n  were aware of the financial repercussions to the Blues, they did not satisfy \r\n  the outstanding invoices.Â  Due to the Harrelsonsâ€™ actions, the Blues had to \r\n  pay Shaw Lumber $55,000 to obtain a release of their home and avoid foreclosure.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nII.\r\nThe Harrelsons assert the trial court \r\n  erred in assessing damages based on the penalty provision of the construction \r\n  contract.Â  They contend the provision is unenforceable because it is not based \r\n  on a consideration of actual damages and it is excessive. \r\nThe Harrelsons are correct that where \r\n  a contract provision is not based upon contemplated actual damages, but is intended \r\n  to provide punishment for breach of contract, it is a penalty.Â  See Moser \r\n  v. Gosnell, 334 S.C. 425, 431-32, 513 S.E.2d 123, 126 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œThe \r\n  test for determining whether a stipulation constitutes a penalty is whether \r\n  â€˜the sum stipulated is so large that it is plainly disproportionate to any probable \r\n  damage resulting from breach of the contract.â€™â€ (quoting Tate v. LeMaster, \r\n  231 S.C. 429, 442, 99 S.E.2d 39, 46 (1957))).Â  However, because the Harrelsons \r\n  failed to answer or respond to the Bluesâ€™ complaint, they have waived any challenge \r\n  to this provision. See D &amp; D Leasing Co. of South Carolina, Inc. \r\n  v. Lipson, 305 S.C. 540, 542, 409 S.E.2d 794, 796 (Ct. App. 1991) (â€œUnenforceability \r\n  based on a penalty theory is an affirmative defense that must have been pled.â€).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nIII.\r\nThe Harrelsons argue the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s orders were insufficient under Rule 52(A), SCRCP, to determine the basis \r\n  for the award of actual damages in the amount of $50,000. \r\nRule 52(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure \r\n  provides, â€œ[i]n all actions tried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory \r\n  jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions \r\n  of law thereon.â€Â  Our supreme court has held that:\r\n\r\nthis requirement to be directory and that noncompliance \r\n  would not form the basis for invalidating a judgment.Â  Rather, where a trial \r\n  court substantially complies with Rule 52(a) and adequately states the basis \r\n  for the result it reaches, the appellate court should not vacate the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  judgment for lack of an explicit or specific factual finding.\r\n\r\nNoisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  122, 123-24 (1991)(citations omitted).Â Â  \r\nBecause we find the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  order entering judgment and the order denying a new trial substantially complied \r\n  with the requirements of Rule 52(a), we decline to invalidate the judgment in \r\n  favor of the Blues.Â  In the initial order, the judge made eight specific findings \r\n  of fact and then found the Blues were entitled to actual damages under each \r\n  cause of action.Â  In the order denying the Harrelsonsâ€™ motion for a new trial, \r\n  the judge affirmed his previous ruling and explained the basis for his award \r\n  of damages.Â  See In re: Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 \r\n  S.C. 122, 133, 568 S.E.2d 338, 343 (2002) (â€œWe do not require a lower court \r\n  to set out findings on all the myriad factual questions arising in a particular \r\n  case.Â  But the findings must be sufficient to allow this Court, sitting in its \r\n  appellate capacity, to ensure the law is faithfully executed below.â€) (citation \r\n  omitted).Â  Although the judge did not delineate the amount of damages for each \r\n  cause of action, we find this omission does not mandate an invalidation of the \r\n  judgment in favor of the Blues.Â  As will be discussed, there is evidence to \r\n  support the amount of damages awarded to the Blues.\r\nIV.\r\nFinally, the Harrelsons argue the trial judge erred \r\n  in awarding the Blues $50,000 in damages. \r\nThe plaintiff has the burden of proving damages \r\n  for a breach of contract action.Â  Jackson v. Midlands Human Resources Ctr., \r\n  296 S.C. 526, 528, 374 S.E.2d 505, 506 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Specifically, this \r\n  Court has stated:\r\n\r\nIn a default case, the plaintiff must prove by competent \r\n  evidence the amount of his damages, and such proof must be by a preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.Â  Although the defendant is in default as to liability, the \r\n  award of damages must be in keeping not only with the allegations of the complaint \r\n  and the prayer for relief, but also with the proof that has been submitted.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 529, 374 S.E.2d at 506 (citation omitted).Â Â  \r\n\r\nInitially, we note the Harrelsons assert the Blues \r\n  are only entitled to $4,297.98 in damages, which represents the amount needed \r\n  to complete the construction in excess of the original contract price of $340,000. [2] Â  This assertion, however, confines \r\n  the Bluesâ€™ damages solely to their breach of contract action.Â  Because the Blues \r\n  sought to recover under several other causes of action, as their attorney reiterated \r\n  during the hearing, their damages would not be limited to this amount. \r\nTurning to the testimony and evidence presented \r\n  by the Blues, Mr. Blue testified they suffered $173,990.57 in actual damages.Â  \r\n  These damages were itemized on a summary sheet that was entered into evidence \r\n  during Mr. Blueâ€™s testimony. [3]  \r\n \r\n\r\nThe contract required the Harrelsons to comply \r\n  with â€œall building laws and applicable building codes of Dillon County and of \r\n  the State of South Carolina.â€Â  However, Kendall, who investigated the Bluesâ€™ \r\n  complaint against the Harrelsons for the Commission, concluded that construction \r\n  of the home violated the standard building practices, codes, regulations, and \r\n  standards.Â  Robertson, who the Blues hired as an expert to inspect the construction, \r\n  testified there were problems with several contract items, which included the \r\n  front porch, painting, fixtures, warped hardwood floors, and roof flashing.Â  \r\n  As to the cost of correcting and completing these items, Mr. Blue testified \r\n  they paid $13,138.98.Â  He further stated the cost of completing construction \r\n  on the Bluesâ€™ home was estimated at $9,650 for work on the porches, shower units, \r\n  window screens, light wiring, as well as other items.\r\nIn addition, Mr. Blue testified concerning the \r\n  Harrelsonsâ€™ use of the construction account at Shaw Lumber Company to purchase \r\n  tools and materials not used in the Bluesâ€™ home.Â  Robertson, who had forty-two \r\n  years of experience in construction and held South Carolina General Contractorâ€™s \r\n  and Residential Home Builderâ€™s licenses, examined the Shaw Lumber invoices and \r\n  determined $4,632.96 in missing construction materials and tools was charged \r\n  to an account at Shaw Lumber, which was designated for the Bluesâ€™ construction \r\n  project.Â  Because the Harrelsons did not pay the Shaw Lumber invoices as agreed \r\n  upon by the parties in the contract, Shaw Lumber sued the Blues for the balance \r\n  of the account.Â  The Blues had to pay Shaw Lumber $55,000 to obtain a release \r\n  from this debt.Â  Mrs. Harrelson acknowledged this debt and the financial repercussions \r\n  could have been avoided had the Harrelsons satisfied the charges as stipulated \r\n  by the contract between the parties. \r\nDue to the Shaw Lumber Company debt and resulting \r\n  litigation, the Blues testified their credit rating was adversely affected.Â  \r\n  Additionally, the Bluesâ€™ original mortgage holder, NBSC, began foreclosure.Â  \r\n  The Blues were then forced to obtain financing at a higher interest rate from \r\n  another financial institution.Â  They paid an application fee of $300 and closing \r\n  costs of $3,912.40 to First Citizens Bank where the Blues eventually obtained \r\n  financing for a second mortgage.Â  Aside from the above-outlined tangible damages, \r\n  Mr. Blue also testified they suffered emotional damages in the amount of $50,000.Â  \r\n  Mrs. Blue, a mental health counselor, testified regarding the specifics of the \r\n  emotional damages.Â  She claimed that as result of the financial problems she \r\n  was anxious and had migraine headaches for which she took medication.Â  She further \r\n  testified her husband became irritable, experienced headaches, and had trouble \r\n  sleeping.\r\nFinally, the construction contract provided for \r\n  a late-fee of $120 per day if the Harrelsons failed to complete the Bluesâ€™ home \r\n  in the allotted 265-day time period.Â  Because the project was not completed \r\n  as agreed upon by the parties, Mr. Blue testified the Harrelsons accrued a late \r\n  fee of $58,680.00 for the 489 days between December 28, 1999 and May 1, 2001, \r\n  the day the Blues obtained financing to complete the project.Â  Based on the \r\n  foregoing, we find there is evidence in the record to support the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  award of actual damages to the Blues in the amount of $50,000.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the Blues properly pled each cause \r\n  of action raised in their complaint and presented evidence in support of their \r\n  entitlement to damages.Â  We hold the trial judgeâ€™s order awarding damages to \r\n  the Blues was sufficient and there is evidence to support his award of damages \r\n  in the amount of $50,000.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial judge is\r\n AFFIRMED.Â  \r\n HUFF, KITTREDGE, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Â Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues \r\n    on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, \r\n    SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â Â  The Harrelsons base this amount on the following \r\n    calculation:\r\n  \r\n  Paid by the Blues directly to the HarrelsonsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    $ 266,500.00\r\n  Paid by the Blues to Shaw Lumber CompanyÂ Â Â  Â Â Â &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  55,000.00\r\n  Construction cost paid directly by the BluesÂ Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp;

Bartlett, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2004-UP-657\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2004 â€“ Filed December \r\n  28, 2004\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nThomas L. Bruce, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nRebecca Rush Wray, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Carlos Cannon appeals a family \r\n  court order terminating his parental rights to his minor child, Kelli Cannon.Â  \r\n  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nCarlos Cannon and Pepper \r\n  Smith are the biological parents of the minor child, Kelli Cannon.Â  Kelli was \r\n  born on October 11, 2001.Â  In January 2002, Kelli was placed in foster care \r\n  due to severe abuse by Smith.Â  Subsequently, the family court, by order dated \r\n  November 7, 2002 (the November order), terminated Smithâ€™s parental rights to \r\n  Kelli and further concluded that Cannon had failed to protect or seek medical \r\n  treatment for Kelli.Â  Cannon was ordered to enroll in a family violence intervention \r\n  program and participate in DSS parenting classes.Â  He attended several in-home \r\n  parenting classes through DSS.Â  After those classes were canceled, Cannon was \r\n  referred by DSS to parenting classes at Prevent Child Abuse Carolina.Â  However, \r\n  he never attended those classes. Â Cannon also never attended the family \r\n  violence intervention program as recommended by DSS. \r\nAlthough Cannon did visit Kelli while she was in \r\n  foster care, he never provided any monetary support for her.Â  The November 2002 \r\n  order did not require Cannon to pay child support for Kelli but left it to his \r\n  discretion. [1] Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  the Guardian ad Litem urged Cannon to provide some amount of monetary support \r\n  for Kelli.Â  In January 2003, DSS instituted a Termination of Parental Rights \r\n  action against Cannon for willful failure to support. Â Thereafter, he \r\n  provided Kelli with some clothing and toys valued at no more than $200.00. \r\nA termination of parental rights hearing \r\n  was held on July 11, 2003.Â  The family court terminated Cannonâ€™s parental rights \r\n  based on his willful failure to support Kelli.Â  Cannon appeals this order. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal of a termination of parental rights case, \r\n  this court may review the entire record and make a determination of the facts \r\n  according to our review of the evidence.

However, this court is not required â€œto ignore \r\n  the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better \r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their \r\n  testimony.â€Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 \r\n  (1999).

Â§20-7-1572(4) (Supp. 2003). Under Section 20-7-1572(4), â€œ[f]ailure \r\n  to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution \r\n  to the childâ€™s care.â€Â  A court may consider all relevant issues in determining \r\n  whether the parent has failed to support the child.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§20-7-1572(4) (Supp. 2003). This includes consideration of the parentâ€™s ability \r\n  to provide support and requests for support by the custodian.Â  Id.Â  Moreover, \r\n  these grounds must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 608, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 \r\n  (2003).\r\nIn the present case, it is clear that \r\n  Cannon willfully failed to make any meaningful effort to support his child.Â  \r\n  During the time Kelli was in foster care, Cannon never provided any money for \r\n  her support.Â  Section 20-7-1572(4) states that â€œsupportâ€ can consist of money \r\n  or food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities.Â  Cannon provided Kelli \r\n  with clothing and toys worth no more than $200.00.Â  And although Kelli had been \r\n  in foster care for over a year, Cannon did not make those contributions until \r\n  after DSS filed a termination of parental rights action against him. Additionally, \r\n  Cannon presented no justification for his failure to provide any support for \r\n  Kelli during the above mentioned period. We conclude that Cannonâ€™s contribution \r\n  of a few clothing and toys was not a material contribution to the health and \r\n  welfare of Kelli as required by Section 20-7-1572(4).\r\n Cannon next argues the trial court erred \r\n  in finding he willfully failed to support Kelli because he was never ordered \r\n  to pay child support.Â  We disagree. This court held, in South Carolina Depâ€™t \r\n  of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, that â€œnothing in Â§20-7-1572(4), requires a parent \r\n  be â€˜notifiedâ€™ of her duty to support her child before failure to discharge this \r\n  duty may serve as grounds for termination of parental rights.â€Â  South Carolina \r\n  Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 296, 547 S.E.2d 506, 510 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2001). Clearly, Cannon was required to make a material contribution \r\n  to the support of Kelli, within his means, even without being ordered to pay \r\n  child support.Â  Moreover, the Guardian ad Litem urged Cannon to monetarily contribute \r\n  to Kelliâ€™s support, even if it consisted of no more than â€œfive to ten dollars \r\n  a week.â€Â  For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the trial court that DSS \r\n  has shown by clear and convincing evidence that Cannon willfully failed to support \r\n  Kelli.Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Childâ€™s Best InterestÂ Â Â Â Â  \r\nCannon argues the family court erred in holding that \r\n  terminating his parental rights was in Kelliâ€™s best interest.Â  We affirm. \r\nUnder Section 20-7-1572 of the S.C. Code \r\n  (Supp. 2003), a family court may order the termination of a parentâ€™s parental \r\n  rights if the parent willfully fails to support his minor child and termination \r\n  is in the childâ€™s best interest.Â  For the following reasons, we find the termination \r\n  of Cannonâ€™s parental rights is in Kelliâ€™s best interest. \r\nAs noted above, Cannon willfully failed to provide \r\n  support for Kelli.Â  While he had been employed for four continuous months at \r\n  the time of the termination hearing, his prior employment had been sporadic. \r\n  Additionally, he had only moved into his own apartment shortly before the hearing \r\n  and the Guardian had not had an opportunity to investigate his accommodations. \r\n  He also failed to complete the DSS parenting classes or to attend the family \r\n  violence intervention program.Â  Moreover, the November 2002 family court order \r\n  stated that Cannon failed to protect or seek medical treatment for Kelli after \r\n  she was abused by Smith.Â  Further, Kelli has been in foster care for most of \r\n  her life and is currently in a suitable pre-adoptive placement in a two-parent \r\n  home. Terminating Cannonâ€™s parental rights would free Kelli for adoption. Finally, \r\n  there is evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s finding that Kelli has not bonded \r\n  with Cannon. This court does not take lightly the measure of permanently severing \r\n  the parent-child relationship. However, after a thorough review of the record \r\n  on appeal, we conclude DSS has shown by clear and convincing evidence that that \r\n  termination of Cannonâ€™s parental rights is in Kelliâ€™s best interest. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude that DSS proved by \r\n  clear and convincing evidence that Cannon willfully failed to provide support \r\n  for his minor child, Kelli. We also conclude that termination of Cannonâ€™s parental \r\n  rights is in Kelliâ€™s best interest. Therefore, the order of the family court \r\n  terminating Cannonâ€™s parental rights is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED. [2]   \r\nSTILWELL, J., SHORT, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The November order also held that Cannon had willfully failed to \r\n    provide any support or make any material contribution towards Kelli for a \r\n    period of over ten months while she was in foster care.Â  Moreover, the court \r\n    also found â€œno agency or court prevented him from doing so.â€ The November \r\n    order was not appealed by Cannon, and thus would ordinarily control in this \r\n    case.Â  However, because the rights of a minor are involved, we review this \r\n    case on appeal whether or not the issue is preserved.

Elliott, \r\n  Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and \r\n  Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Olin Earl Young appeals his \r\n  convictions for two counts of felony driving under the influence and two counts \r\n  of reckless homicide.Â  He argues the trial court erred in admitting evidence \r\n  of his refusal to take a breathalyzer test and the results of a blood alcohol \r\n  test. [1] Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nIn 1999, Young caused an automobile \r\n  accident, resulting in the death of two people.Â  All witnesses at the scene, \r\n  including the police officers, testified Young, who suffered injuries to his \r\n  head and chest in the accident, smelled of alcohol and was having difficulty \r\n  walking and talking.Â  Young was arrested at the scene for felony DUI.Â  \r\nAt trial, the jury convicted Young of two counts \r\n  of felony DUI resulting in death and two counts of reckless homicide.Â  The trial \r\n  judge sentenced him to consecutive twenty-five year terms for the two counts \r\n  of felony DUI resulting in death and concurrent ten-year terms for both counts \r\n  of reckless homicide.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Videotape Evidence\r\nYoung claims the trial court erred in admitting \r\n  evidence of his refusal to take the breathalyzer test because the arresting \r\n  officers did not comply with the provisions of section 56-5-2953 of the South \r\n  Carolina Code.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 56-5-2953 requires violators of \r\n  the driving under the influence statute to be videotaped at the incident site \r\n  and the breath test site.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(A) (Supp. 1998). [2] Â  Among other things, the videotaping \r\n  at the breath test site must include the reading of the personâ€™s rights, a twenty-minute \r\n  pre-test waiting period, and the entire testing procedure or the personâ€™s refusal \r\n  to take the test.Â  Id.Â  However, failure to produce a videotape is not \r\n  grounds for dismissal of a DUI, felony DUI, or driving with an unlawful alcohol \r\n  concentration charge if the arresting officer submits a sworn affidavit certifying \r\n  that despite reasonable efforts, the equipment was inoperable and there was \r\n  no other operable breath test facility available in the county.Â  Â§ 56-5-2953(B).Â  \r\n  Here, Youngâ€™s refusal was not videotaped and Young challenges the effectiveness \r\n  of the arresting officerâ€™s affidavit.Â  Young argues surveillance equipment at \r\n  the station that was purchased and installed by the city suffices as â€œvideotaping \r\n  equipmentâ€ for purposes of this statute.Â  At the time of Youngâ€™s arrest, the \r\n  city police department was using this equipment in the hallway for security \r\n  purposes rather than in the Datamaster room.Â  \r\nThe statute provides â€œSLED is responsible for purchasing, \r\n  maintaining, and supplying all necessary videotaping equipment for use at the \r\n  breath test sites.â€Â  Â§ 56-5-2953(D).Â  Additionally, the act creating section \r\n  56-5-2953 stated â€œ[t]he provisions in Section 56-5-2953(A), (B), and (C) take \r\n  effect for each breath test site as soon as the breath test site is equipped \r\n  with a videotaping device.â€Â  Act No. 434, 1998 S.C. Acts Â§ 18, as amended \r\n  by Act No. 97, 1999 S.C. Acts Â§ 1.Â  This language, with minor non-substantive \r\n  changes has since been incorporated into the statute.Â  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 56-5-2953(G) (Supp. 2003).Â  When this incident occurred in August 1999, \r\n  although the city had its own videotaping equipment, SLED had not installed \r\n  videotaping equipment to meet the requirements of this statute.Â  In fact, SLED \r\n  did not install the videotaping equipment in the city Datamaster test site until \r\n  September 2000.Â  Therefore, because the department had not yet been equipped \r\n  by SLED pursuant to the statute, the breath test provisions of subsections (A) \r\n  and (B) are inapplicable to Youngâ€™s case and the trial court properly admitted \r\n  evidence of Youngâ€™s refusal.\r\nII.Â  Blood Alcohol Test\r\nYoung claims the trial court erred in admitting \r\n  the results of his blood alcohol test because the blood was drawn without actual \r\n  consent or compliance with the requirements of the implied consent statute.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nThe implied consent statute prohibits \r\n  the administration of drug or alcohol tests and obtaining drug or alcohol samples \r\n  until the person has been informed in writing of his rights in regards to the \r\n  procedures.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a) (Supp. 1998).Â  Officer Blose advised \r\n  Young of his implied consent rights on two occasions, and Young signed documentation \r\n  to that effect.Â  Young also rejected medical care at the scene and at the police \r\n  station, though he was advised of his rights to medical services.Â  \r\nLater on, however, he â€œask[ed] to go to the hospital.â€Â  \r\n  At the hospital, Dr. Theresa Oldson requested a medical blood alcohol test to \r\n  determine Youngâ€™s degree of impairment and whether that impairment was caused \r\n  by his injuries or alcohol.Â  Additionally, Oldson explained â€œthe biggest reason \r\n  is he had potentially life threatening injuries that often times require surgery \r\n  and most all the time require narcotics and the administration of multiple drugs.Â  \r\n  And it was important for me to know what the alcohol level was or if he had \r\n  been drinking.â€Â  \r\nYoung claims the results of these tests should \r\n  not be admitted as evidence because he was not notified of his implied consent \r\n  rights at the hospital.Â  However, in State v. Hunter, 305 S.C. 560, 561, \r\n  410 S.E.2d 242, 242 (1991), our supreme court found that even if a defendant \r\n  was not afforded the procedural safeguards contained in the implied consent \r\n  statute, those safeguards were inapplicable because the test was conducted for \r\n  the purpose of medical diagnosis and treatment.Â  Here, not only was the test \r\n  performed for purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment, but Young requested \r\n  the treatment.Â  Thus the implied consent statute simply does not apply.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and SHORT, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] In his brief, Young asserted two other evidentiary issues \r\n    as well as a ground for exclusion of his blood test results not addressed \r\n    in this opinion.Â  Young conceded these issues at oral argument.\r\n\r\n \r\n     \r\n[2]  The \r\n    statute is referenced as it existed at the time of Youngâ€™s arrest.Â  It has \r\n    since been amended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
