Fitzer, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this action for separate support and maintenance, the Estate of\r\nJohn S. Cathcart (Estate) appeals the family court's order, arguing the family court\r\nerred in (1) determining any portion of SCANA stock titled to Mary Frances\r\nCathcart (Wife) was not marital property; (2) apportioning to Wife all of the\r\nproperty owned by Wife at the time of filing of the action; (3) failing to award\r\n\nretroactive alimony to John S. Cathcart (Husband) until his death; and (4) failing to\r\naward Estate attorney's fees. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.      Estate's contention the family court erred in determining that any portion of\r\nthe SCANA stock was not marital property is not preserved for review. \"In order\r\nfor an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and\r\nruled upon by the trial court.\" King v. King, 384 S.C. 134, 142, 681 S.E.2d 609,\r\n614 (Ct. App. 2009); see also Barrow v. Barrow, 394 S.C. 603, 615, 716 S.E.2d\r\n302, 309 (Ct. App. 2011) (noting an issue is not preserved for appellate review\r\nwhere it is not addressed in the family court's order, and the party fails to raise it in\r\na Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion); Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 41, 619 S.E.2d\r\n437, 449 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding, when a trial court makes a general ruling on an\r\nissue, but does not address the specific argument raised by a party, that party must\r\nmake a Rule 59(e) motion asking the trial court to rule on the issue in order to\r\npreserve it for appeal, and finding, even though the trial transcript included a\r\ndiscussion of the issue on appeal, the issue was not preserved where the trial court\r\ndid not rule on it). The family court's final order makes several findings\r\nconcerning the SCANA stock; however, it never makes a finding about whether it\r\nis or is not marital property. Contrary to the assertion in its appellate brief, Estate\r\nnever requested a ruling in its motion for reconsideration about whether the\r\nSCANA stock was marital property, never asserted any error in the court’s failure\r\nto make a finding regarding whether any or all of the stock was marital, and never\r\nrequested the court clarify its finding in this regard. Neither was the argument\r\nmade by Estate on appeal argued at the motion for reconsideration.\r\n\r\n2.     After de novo review, we found the trial court did not err in apportioning to\r\nWife all of the property owned by Wife, and apportioning to Estate all of the\r\nproperty owned by Husband. Section 20-3-630(A) of the South Carolina Code\r\ndefines marital property as \"all real and personal property which has been acquired\r\nby the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or\r\ncommencement of marital litigation. . . .,\" excluding, among other things, property\r\nacquired prior to the marriage and property received as inheritance or gift from a\r\nparty other than the spouse. S.C. Code Ann. §20-3-630(A) (Supp. 2012). The\r\nfamily court has discretion to decide what weight to assign various factors\r\nconsidered for equitable apportionment and, on review, this court's role is to\r\nexamine the fairness of the overall apportionment. Sanders v. Sanders, 396 S.C.\r\n410, 418-19, 722 S.E.2d 15, 19 (Ct. App. 2011). This court will affirm the family\r\ncourt if it can determine the family court addressed the factors under the\r\napportionment of marital property statute sufficiently for this court to conclude it\r\nwas cognizant of the factors. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531,\r\n\n537 (Ct. App. 2001). Here, the record shows the family court sufficiently\r\naddressed the factors under the apportionment of marital property statute.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as noted by the family court, our courts have recognized exceptional\r\ncircumstances may make it appropriate to not divide certain property acquired\r\nduring a marriage where the parties cease to contribute to the joint enterprise.\r\n\"Equitable distribution is based on a recognition that marriage is, among other\r\nthings, an economic partnership,\" and \"[u]pon dissolution of the marriage, property\r\naccumulated during the marriage should be divided and distributed in a manner\r\nwhich fairly reflects each spouse's contribution to its acquisition, regardless of\r\nwhich spouse holds legal title.\" Walker v. Walker, 295 S.C. 286, 288, 368 S.E.2d\r\n89, 90 (Ct. App. 1988). \"The ultimate goal of apportionment is to divide the\r\nmarital estate, as a whole, in a manner which fairly reflects each spouse's\r\ncontribution to the economic partnership and also the relative effects of ending that\r\npartnership on each of the parties,\" and \"[t]he family court has wide discretion in\r\ndetermining the contributions made by each spouse to the marital property.\"\r\nLaFrance v. LaFrance, 370 S.C. 622, 652, 636 S.E.2d 3, 19 (Ct. App. 2006),\r\noverruled in part on other grounds by Arnal v. Arnal, 371 S.C. 10, 13 n.4, 636\r\nS.E.2d 864, 866 n.4 (2006). In Wannamaker v. Wannamaker, this court found a\r\nlengthy separation of the parties prior to the institution of marital litigation was a\r\nspecial consideration to be factored into the court's determination of equitable\r\ndistribution. 305 S.C. 36, 41, 406 S.E.2d 180, 183 (Ct. App. 1991). There, we\r\nstated as follows:\r\n\r\n             While we recognize the rule that a spouse need not prove\r\n             that he or she made a material contribution to the\r\n             acquisition of particular property in order to be entitled to\r\n             an equitable interest in it, we hold in this case that the\r\n             special circumstances of the long separation of the parties\r\n             before institution of marital litigation must be factored in\r\n             as a special consideration.\r\n\r\nId. at 41, 406 S.E.2d at 183. Accordingly, we find the wife should not be\r\napportioned an interest in the husband's medical practice, where the husband did\r\nnot begin the practice until eight years after the parties separated and the wife\r\ncontributed nothing to its acquisition or appreciation in value. Id. Although\r\nmarital property generally includes all property acquired by either party prior to the\r\ndate marital litigation is filed, this case presents a unique situation because the\r\nparties were separated for nearly thirty years before instituting marital litigation.\r\nHere, the family court found Wife owned SCANA stock and four real estate\r\n\nproperties at the time the action was filed, and all of the real estate owned by Wife\r\nwas either owned prior to the marriage, was inherited after the separation, or was\r\npurchased with Wife’s own funds post-separation, and none of these properties\r\nwere transmuted. Estate does not challenge these findings. Thus, these real estate\r\nproperties were non-marital. S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-630 (Supp. 2012). The\r\nremaining property owned by Wife at the time this action was filed was SCANA\r\nstock. Wife's testimony indicates she acquired much of her SCANA stock through\r\nher own efforts and gifts from her mother, as well as through stock splits and\r\nreinvestment of dividends. Though there is evidence Husband transferred to\r\nWife's account some SCANA stock previously held in his name and some held\r\njointly by Husband and Wife, and Husband additionally gave Wife money from\r\ntime to time which may have been used by Wife to purchase SCANA stock, the\r\nevidence concerning these contributions by Husband are negligible in comparison\r\nto the total SCANA stock held by Wife at the time of filing. Additionally, as noted\r\nby the family court, Husband never attempted to make any claim to the SCANA\r\nstock, but apparently was satisfied with the financial arrangement between him and\r\nWife, and Husband's consistent behavior throughout the years of lengthy\r\nseparation demonstrated Husband's intent concerning the division of their assets.\r\nAfter reviewing the entire record and in consideration of the special circumstance\r\nof a separation spanning over thirty years during which time there was no longer\r\nan economic partnership between Husband and Wife, we find Estate has failed to\r\nmeet its burden of convincing us the family court's determination in this regard was\r\nin error.\r\n\r\n3.      We find Estate's argument that the family court erred in failing to award\r\nretroactive alimony from the date of filing to the date of Husband's death is not\r\npreserved. \"In order for an issue to be preserved for appellate review, it must have\r\nbeen raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.\" King, 384 S.C. at 142, 681 S.E.2d\r\nat 614. During the hearing, the family court declined to rule on whether it could\r\naward retroactive alimony to Estate after Husband was deceased. Following the\r\nhearing, both parties submitted memoranda arguing their respective positions. In\r\nits final order, the family court stated, \"Plaintiff, now deceased, has no need for\r\nsupport.\" Although it denied alimony, it did not specifically rule on the issue of\r\nwhether a court can award retroactive alimony to a deceased party. Estate did not\r\nraise the issue of retroactive alimony in its motion for reconsideration. However, it\r\nattempted to raise it at the reconsideration hearing, and Wife objected, arguing it\r\nwas not raised in the motion. Estate conceded, noting the exceptions set forth in its\r\nmotion for reconsideration were geared more toward equitable division and stating\r\n\"I think [Wife] is correct. I'm not saying that we are asking the Court to now today\r\naward retroactive alimony.\" The family court did not rule on this issue, stating\r\n\nEstate withdrew the request for alimony after Wife objected based on preservation.\r\nAccordingly, this issue is not preserved. See also TNS Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nRevenue, 331 S.C. 611, 617, 503 S.E.2d 471, 474 (1998) (\"An issue conceded in a\r\nlower court may not be argued on appeal.\").\r\n\r\n4.      As to Estate's assertion the family court erred in failing to award attorney's\r\nfees, Estate concedes that if this court affirms the family court's order, the denial of\r\nattorney's fees would be appropriate. Because we affirm the family court order,\r\nthere is no basis for reversal of the family court's order concerning attorney's fees.\r\n\r\n5.    Given our affirmance of the issues raised by Estate, we need not reach\r\nWife's additional sustaining ground.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the family court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, THOMAS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-132","title":"Ferguson v.

Falkner Wilkes, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n            Kenneth C. Porter, Porter & Rosenfeld, of Greenville, for\r\n            Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Karen Wise Ferguson (Wife) appeals a divorce decree, arguing\r\n(1) her alimony award was insufficient and (2) an asset purchased by Bruce\r\nFerguson (Husband) should have been included in the marital estate. We affirm in\r\npart and remand in part.\r\n\n1.     The family court granted Wife alimony in the amount of $550 per month,\r\nbut further provided that alimony would end either two years from the date of the\r\nsigning of the divorce decree or upon Husband's retirement, whichever occurred\r\nlater. Wife argues she should have received an award of permanent periodic\r\nalimony. We remand this matter to the family court for further findings of fact and\r\nto reconsider whether Wife should have been awarded permanent alimony.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was undisputed that Husband was approaching retirement age, the\r\nfamily court also found (1) he had substantial marital assets in the six-figure range,\r\n(2) the parties were married approximately twenty years, and (3) both were at fault\r\nin the breakup of the marriage. Husband also had substantial nonmarital assets.\r\nThe family court found Wife was in relatively poor health, had substantial\r\nrecurring medical expenses, and was not likely to be able to work full-time. In\r\naddition, although Wife had acquired some nonmarital assets through an\r\ninheritance, these had been transmuted into marital property. The family court\r\nshould have considered all these circumstances in setting the alimony award. See\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2012) (enumerating certain factors that \"the\r\ncourt must consider\" and weigh appropriately in making an award of alimony or\r\nseparate maintenance and support) (emphasis added). We are unable to determine\r\nfrom the appealed order how these and other factors prompted the family court to\r\nallow Husband to cease paying alimony at some future time without petitioning the\r\nfamily court. Moreover, in setting the alimony at $550 per month, the family court\r\ndid not explain how the amount itself would reflect the expectation that Husband\r\nwould retire. See Sharps v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 78, 535 S.E.2d 913, 917 (2000)\r\n(\"As a general rule, a court hearing an application for a change in alimony should\r\nlook not only to see if the substantial change was contemplated by the parties, but\r\nmost importantly whether the amount of alimony in the original decree reflects the\r\nexpectation of that future occurrence.\"). Notably, the family court does not\r\nexplain how Wife, who had no other ascertainable source of income, was to\r\nprovide for her needs after cessation of her alimony payments. Cf. Roof v. Steele,\r\n396 S.C. 373, 387-88, 720 S.E.2d 910, 918-19 (Ct. App. 2011) (affirming the\r\nfinding that supported spouse demonstrated a change of circumstances warranting\r\nan increase in her alimony and noting the modest amount of alimony awarded did\r\nnot consider her needs should she lose coverage under the supporting spouse's\r\nemployer's health insurance plan even though the parties acknowledged the\r\npossibility of such a loss in their settlement agreement). Because we are unable to\r\njustify the family court's award of alimony based on the record, we remand this\r\nmatter for further findings of fact. See Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 415-16,\r\n440 S.E.2d 884, 886-87 (1994) (reversing and remanding the issues of alimony and\r\n\nequitable division because the family court failed to examine all the relevant\r\nstatutory factors); Grumbos v. Grumbos, 393 S.C. 33, 48, 710 S.E.2d 76, 84 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2011) (remanding the issue of attorney's fees to the family court because,\r\namong other reasons, the order lacked specific findings to support the amount\r\nawarded).\r\n\r\n2.    Wife further argues that some gold Husband purchased with an inheritance\r\nand valued at $69,000 had been transmuted and should have been included in the\r\nmarital estate. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe basis for Wife's argument that the gold had been transmuted appears to be\r\nHusband's decision to place the gold in a safe deposit box that was in both parties'\r\nnames. She contends that the use of the jointly held safe deposit box was\r\ntantamount to \"the placing of the gold in joint names,\" which, she asserts, \"is prima\r\nfacie proof of Husband's intent to make the gold marital in nature\" and at least\r\nshifts the burden to Husband to show that he did not intend to make the gold a\r\nmarital asset. For title to be an indication of transmutation, however, the property\r\nallegedly transmuted must itself be titled jointly. See Peterkin v. Peterkin, 293\r\nS.C. 311, 313, 360 S.E.2d 311, 312-13 (1987) (noting three circumstances under\r\nwhich transmutation may occur, including that the property is titled jointly);\r\nSanders v. Sanders, 396 S.C. 410, 416, 722 S.E.2d 15, 17 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"[T]he\r\nact of depositing an inheritance into the parties' joint account does not\r\nautomatically render the inherited funds to be marital property.\").\r\n\r\nWife also argues that Husband told her that his inheritance would fund their\r\nretirement and, in reliance on this promise, she allowed her own inheritance to be\r\ntransmuted. We have not found any authority for the proposition that a statement\r\nof future intent regarding an individually owned asset mandates a finding that the\r\nasset has been transmuted. Here, the gold retained a separate identity, was never\r\ncommingled with marital assets, and was never actually \"utilized\" by the parties in\r\nsupport of the marriage or in a manner evidencing the parties' intent to make it\r\nmarital property. See Smith v. Smith, 386 S.C. 251, 268, 687 S.E.2d 720, 729 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2009) (noting circumstances under which nonmarital property is transmuted\r\ninto marital property). Moreover, the only evidence Wife presented about\r\nHusband's promise and her reliance on his assurance was her own testimony;\r\nHusband never admitted that he agreed his inheritance would be used for the\r\nparties' retirement. Based on these circumstances, we decline to disturb the family\r\ncourt's refusal to include the Husband's gold in the marital estate. See Nestberg v.\r\nNestberg, 394 S.C. 618, 623, 716 S.E.2d 310, 313 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating that\r\n\nalthough an appellate court has the authority to make its own findings of fact when\r\nreviewing a family court order, it commonly defers to the family court's factual\r\nfindings of credibility because the family court \"is in a superior position to assess\r\nthe demeanor of witnesses\"); Pirri v. Pirri, 369 S.C. 258, 270, 631 S.E.2d 279, 286\r\n(Ct.

We affirm\r\npursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1. As to whether the trial court erred in admitting a photograph of the victim into\r\nevidence: State v.

Edwards, 194 S.C. 410, 410,\r\n10 S.E.2d 587, 588 (1940) (finding photograph depicting the presence of maggots\r\nin and around the murder victim's body was properly admitted).\r\n\r\n2. As to whether the trial court erred in admitting testimony concerning an alleged\r\nthreat: State v. Lewis, 293 S.C. 107, 110, 359 S.E.2d 66, 67-68 (1987) (\"[I]f an out-\r\nof-court statement is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and is\r\notherwise competent, it is admissible.\"); State v.

Khoury, of Folks Khoury & DeVenny, LLC,\r\n             of Lancaster, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Alvenia Lowe Brewer (Wife) appeals the family court's order\r\ngranting the parties a divorce and equitably dividing their marital property. She\r\nargues the family court erred in (1) failing to equitably divide the parties' personal\r\nproperty, (2) awarding her only a one-half interest in the marital home, (3)\r\n\ndetermining Theodore Roosevelt Brewer's (Husband's) Detroit residence (Detroit\r\nco-op) was not transmuted into marital property, and (4) finding Wife's credit card\r\ndebt was nonmarital. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\"In appeals from the family court, [appellate courts] review[] factual and legal\r\nissues de novo.\" Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667\r\n(2011). Nonetheless, \"de novo review neither relieves an appellant of\r\ndemonstrating error nor requires us to ignore the findings of the family court.\"\r\nLewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 388-89, 709 S.E.2d 650, 654 (2011). The burden is\r\nupon the appellant to convince the appellate court that the preponderance of the\r\nevidence is against the family court's findings. Id. at 388, 709 S.E.2d at 653.\r\n\r\n1.    Personal Property\r\n\r\nThe parties have settled the issue of the division of their personal property, and the\r\nfamily court approved their settlement agreement in an order dated March 20,\r\n2013.\r\n\r\n2.    Marital Home\r\n\r\nWife asserts the family court erred in finding she was entitled only to a one-half\r\ninterest in the marital home. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSubsection 20-3-620(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012) sets forth fifteen\r\nfactors for the family court to consider in apportioning marital property. Those\r\nfactors include, but are not limited to: the duration of the marriage and the ages of\r\nthe parties; \"[t]he contribution of each spouse to the acquisition, preservation,\r\ndepreciation, or appreciation in value of the marital property, including the\r\ncontribution of the spouse as homemaker\"; any liens or debts; and each party's\r\nincome, health, and nonmarital property. Id. These statutory factors are intended\r\nto \"guide the family court in exercising its discretion over apportionment of marital\r\nproperty.\" Sanders v. Sanders, 396 S.C. 410, 418, 722 S.E.2d 15, 19 (Ct. App.\r\n2011). Appellate courts do not re-weigh the apportionment factors but review the\r\noverall apportionment for fairness. Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 299-300,\r\n372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\n\r\nWe find the family court's apportionment of the marital home was fair, and we\r\naffirm. The findings of fact reflected in the family court's order indicate it\r\nconsidered and weighed the appropriate statutory factors. See Sanders, 396 S.C. at\r\n\n418, 722 S.E.2d at 19 (recognizing statutory factors guide the family court in\r\napportioning marital property). Specifically, the family court found the marriage\r\nlasted nine years, and both parties were retired at the time of the marriage and in\r\ntheir seventies at the time of the divorce. The family court further noted the parties\r\nenjoyed similar retirement incomes, with Husband receiving approximately $282\r\nmore per month than Wife, but Wife's health was good while Husband's was\r\ndeclining. With regard to the marital home, the family court noted Husband had\r\nowned the sixteen-and-a-half-acre home site since 1979, and both parties had\r\ncontributed personal monies and secured a mortgage to fund construction of the\r\nmarital home. The family court stated that, at the time Wife filed for divorce, the\r\nparties owed $114,318 on the first mortgage loan. The parties stipulated to a value\r\nof $220,000 for the marital home.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Wife argues she contributed more money toward constructing the\r\nmarital home than Husband. While this assertion may be true, it ignores Husband's\r\nother contributions. The parties testified they paid $250,000 for construction of the\r\nhome and $35,000 for subsequent improvements, for a total of $285,000.\r\nHowever, between personal funds and a second mortgage, the parties claimed to\r\nhave paid a total of $310,600 to build and improve the marital home.1 Husband\r\ntestified he contributed the land plus $75,000 of his own funds. Wife testified she\r\ncontributed a total of $90,000 of her own funds. Both parties signed the mortgage\r\nloan in the amount of $145,600. We find Wife has not shown her contributions to\r\nthe construction of the marital home were significantly greater than Husband's.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we find the family court's overall apportionment of marital property,\r\nincluding the share each party received of the equity in the marital home, was fair.\r\nSee Johnson, 296 S.C. at 299-300, 372 S.E.2d at 113 (restricting appellate review\r\nof equitable apportionment to a determination of whether the family court's awards\r\nwere fair overall). The record indicates the parties made roughly equal\r\ncontributions to the marital estate. However, because the parties failed to provide\r\nthe family court with values for the vehicles and personal property, we are unable\r\nto compare the precise values of the total awards.\r\n\r\nAlthough different in content, the awards appear fair. The record reflects Husband\r\nreceived all real property and some personal property, including two non-operating\r\nvehicles, but also more than $166,000 in marital debt. Even though the family\r\ncourt awarded him both the marital home and the nonmarital Detroit co-op, neither\r\n\r\n1   We recognize this claim results in an unexplained overpayment of $25,600.\r\n\nproperty was owned \"free and clear.\" The parties owed more than $114,000 on the\r\nmarital home, and the Detroit co-op was subject to a monthly maintenance fee of\r\n$305. Furthermore, the family court ordered Husband to take out an additional\r\nloan to pay Wife $52,841 for her equity in the marital home. As a result, Husband\r\nreceived a net award of approximately $54,000, plus the Detroit co-op, two non-\r\noperating vehicles, and some furnishings.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Wife received no real property, more personal property than\r\nHusband, and no marital debt. She received four vehicles, at least one of which\r\nwas operational; some furnishings; $52,841 in cash for her equity in the marital\r\nhome; and her nonmarital credit card debt of approximately $24,000.\r\n\r\nEach party received a net award of marital property totaling approximately\r\n$50,000, plus unvalued personal property. Accordingly, we find the family court\r\ndid not err in apportioning the equity in the marital home equally between the\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n3.    Detroit Co-op\r\n\r\nNext, Wife asserts the family court erred in holding the Detroit co-op was not\r\ntransmuted into marital property. We disagree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, marital property \"means all real and personal property which has been\r\nacquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of\r\nfiling or commencement of marital litigation.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-630(A)\r\n(Supp. 2012). \"[P]roperty acquired by either party before the marriage\" does not\r\nqualify as marital property. S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-630(A)(2) (Supp. 2012). \"The\r\n[family] court does not have jurisdiction or authority to apportion nonmarital\r\nproperty.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-630(B) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\nNonetheless, nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property if it:\r\n\r\n            (1) . . . becomes so commingled with marital property as\r\n            to be untraceable; (2) . . . is jointly titled; or (3) . . . is\r\n            utilized by the parties in support of the marriage or in\r\n            some other manner so as to evidence an intent by the\r\n            parties to make it marital property. Transmutation is a\r\n            matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts of each case.\r\n            The spouse claiming transmutation must produce\r\n\n             objective evidence showing that, during the marriage, the\r\n             parties themselves regarded the property as the common\r\n             property of the marriage. The mere use of separate\r\n             property to support the marriage, without some additional\r\n             evidence of intent to treat it as property of the marriage,\r\n             is not sufficient to establish transmutation.\r\n\r\nPool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 88, 467 S.E.2d 753, 756 (Ct. App. 1996) (citations\r\nomitted), aff'd as modified, 329 S.C. 324, 494 S.E.2d 820 (1998).\r\n\r\nWe affirm. We find Wife failed to produce evidence the Detroit co-op was\r\ntransmuted into marital property, and she makes no argument that the Detroit co-op\r\nwas commingled to the point of being untraceable or that it was jointly titled. She\r\nargues only that the parties' use of the property demonstrated an intent to make it\r\nmarital. We find the evidence Wife provides amounts to mere use rather than\r\ntransmutation.\r\n\r\nIn Murray v. Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 156-57, 439 S.E.2d 312, 314 (Ct. App. 1993),\r\nthe husband acquired a home prior to marrying the wife. The parties lived in the\r\nhome throughout their seventeen-year marriage. Id. at 157, 439 S.E.2d at 315.\r\nFinding the wife \"failed to produce evidence that any appreciable amount of\r\nmarital funds was expended on\" improving the marital home, this court held the\r\nhome remained the nonmarital property of the husband. Id. at 158, 439 S.E.2d at\r\n315. It did, however, affirm the family court's award to the wife of a special equity\r\nin the appreciation in value of the marital home during the marriage. Id. at 161-62,\r\n439 S.E.2d at 317.\r\n\r\nIn Pruitt v. Pruitt, 389 S.C. 250, 262, 697 S.E.2d 702, 708 (Ct. App. 2010), the\r\nhusband built a home on land owned by his grandmother. Before completing the\r\nhome, he married the wife and they moved into the home. Id. at 262, 697 S.E.2d at\r\n708-09. The wife assisted him in completing the construction of the home. Id. at\r\n262, 697 S.E.2d at 709. However, the husband claimed he paid for the\r\nconstruction of and improvements to the home from his personal funds, and the\r\nwife failed to present evidence to the contrary. Id. at 262-63, 697 S.E.2d at 708-\r\n09. At some point during the marriage, the husband alone received title to the\r\nproperty through a gift from his family, making the home and land his nonmarital\r\nproperty. Id. at 262 n.3, 697 S.E.2d at 709 n.3. Although the parties lived in this\r\nhome during their nineteen-year marriage, these facts demonstrated mere use of the\r\nproperty rather than transmutation. Id. at 263, 697 S.E.2d at 709.\r\n\nIn the case at bar, Wife bases her transmutation argument upon (1) her subjective\r\nbelief that Husband added her name to the deed and (2) the parties' use of the\r\nDetroit co-op for temporary lodging and storage. Pursuant to Murray and Pruitt,\r\nwe find the evidence in the case at bar demonstrates mere use of the property and\r\nnot an intent to transmute it into marital property.2 Accordingly, the family court\r\ndid not err in finding the Detroit co-op remained Husband's nonmarital property.\r\n\r\n4.       Wife's Credit Card Debt\r\n\r\nFinally, Wife asserts the family court erred in finding her credit card debt was\r\nnonmarital. We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn addition to liens and other encumbrances upon the parties' marital and\r\nnonmarital property, a family court tasked with equitably apportioning the marital\r\nestate must consider \"any other existing debts incurred by the parties or either of\r\nthem during the course of the marriage.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-620(B)(13)\r\n(Supp. 2012); compare S.C. Code Ann. § 20-5-60 (1985) (\"A husband shall not be\r\nliable for the debts of his wife contracted prior to or after their marriage, except for\r\nher necessary support and that of their minor children residing with her.\").\r\nSubsection 20-3-620(B)(13) \"creates a presumption that a debt of either spouse\r\nincurred prior to marital litigation is a marital debt and must be factored in the\r\ntotality of equitable apportionment. The presumption is rebuttable.\" Hardy v.\r\nHardy, 311 S.C. 433, 436, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\n\r\n               . . . For purposes of equitable distribution, \"marital debt\"\r\n               is debt incurred for the joint benefit of the parties\r\n               regardless of whether the parties are legally jointly liable\r\n               for the debt or whether one party is legally individually\r\n               liable. The same rules of fairness and equity that apply\r\n               to the equitable distribution of marital property also\r\n               apply to the equitable division of marital debts.\r\n\r\nKing v. King, 384 S.C. 134, 143, 681 S.E.2d 609, 614 (Ct. App. 2009) (citations\r\nand quotation marks omitted). However, \"[m]arital debt, like marital property,\r\nmust be specifically identified and apportioned in equitable distribution.\" Wooten\r\nv. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 546, 615 S.E.2d 98, 105 (2005).\r\n\r\n2   Wife does not argue that she is entitled to a special equity.\r\n\nWe find Wife failed to present sufficient evidence of her credit card debt to\r\nidentify it as a marital debt. See id. Debt incurred by an individual prior to\r\nmarriage, like property acquired by an individual prior to marriage, is not\r\npresumed to be part of the marital estate. § 20-3-620(B)(13); § 20-3-630(A)(2)\r\n(providing \"property acquired by either party before the marriage\" is not marital\r\nproperty). Furthermore, when the family court equitably apportions the marital\r\nestate, it must specifically identify and apportion any marital debt. Wooten, 364\r\nS.C. at 546, 615 S.E.2d at 105. These provisions implicitly require the party\r\nasserting a marital debt to supply the family court with evidence adequate for the\r\nfamily court to determine (1) the party or parties incurred a debt (2) of an\r\napproximate amount (3) to a certain creditor (4) during the marriage and (5) that it\r\nbenefited the marriage.\r\n\r\nWe find Wife failed to present sufficient evidence for the family court to make this\r\ndetermination and, in turn, fulfill its obligation under Wooten to \"specifically\r\nidentify\" the debt. Wife's financial statement indicates she paid $900 per month on\r\na balance of $24,000 for \"Misc. Credit Cards.\" When asked whether that debt\r\n\"arose during the marriage,\" Wife answered affirmatively. Although Wife\r\nconceded she possessed the credit cards before she married Husband, she\r\nmaintained, \"We used those credit cards [during the marriage].\" She explained the\r\ncards were used for household purchases. According to Husband's testimony, Wife\r\ncarried her own credit cards and did \"[w]hat she wanted\" with them.3\r\n\r\nDespite Wife's contention to the contrary, the family court did not find her $24,000\r\nin credit card debt was nonmarital. The family court was simply unable to\r\ndetermine whether any portion of the debt was marital or nonmarital.

Wayne\r\n            Floyd, of West Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n            Attorney General Alan Wilson, Assistant Attorney\r\n            General Julie Kate Keeney, both of Columbia, for\r\n            Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Andrew Torrence appeals his conviction of voluntary\r\nmanslaughter for the shooting death of Zach Chaplin. He argues the circuit court\r\nerred when it did not charge the jury on involuntary manslaughter because there is\r\n\nevidence in the record showing Torrence did not intend to inflict great bodily harm\r\nor death. We affirm.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning hours of September 28, 2008, Torrence and Chaplin got into a\r\nphysical altercation while at a bar. Although Torrence initially exited the bar after\r\nthe fight, he decided to go back in with his gun to make a citizen's arrest and detain\r\nChaplin for the earlier assault. He testified he brought the gun with him as a\r\ndeterrent against any further violence and had no intent to shoot the gun.\r\nHowever, while Torrence was conducting the alleged citizen's arrest, Chaplin\r\ncharged him from across the bar. Torrence admitted he fired the gun twice at\r\nChaplin. Both bullets struck Chaplin, and he died from complications of his\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\nAt trial for murder, the court charged voluntary manslaughter but refused\r\nTorrence's request to charge involuntary manslaughter. The jury found Torrence\r\nguilty of voluntary manslaughter, and the court sentenced him to twenty-five years\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe law to be charged is determined from the evidence presented at trial. State v.\r\nGibson, 390 S.C. 347, 355, 701 S.E.2d 766, 770 (Ct. App. 2010). The trial court\r\ncommits reversible error if it refuses a request for a jury instruction on a lesser-\r\nincluded offense that is supported by the evidence. 390 S.C. at 355-56, 701 S.E.2d\r\nat 770.\r\n\r\nInvoluntary manslaughter is defined as the unintentional killing of another without\r\nmalice while (1) engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending to cause\r\ndeath or great bodily harm or (2) engaged in a lawful activity with reckless\r\ndisregard for the safety of others. State v. Smith, 391 S.C. 408, 414, 706 S.E.2d 12,\r\n15 (2011). Generally, a charge of involuntary manslaughter is inappropriate where\r\nthe defendant admits he or she intentionally fired a gun. See State v. Pickens, 320\r\nS.C. 528, 531-32, 466 S.E.2d 364, 366-67 (1996) (holding defendant not entitled to\r\ninvoluntary manslaughter charge because defendant admitted intentionally\r\nshooting the gun); Gibson, 390 S.C. at 357-58, 701 S.E.2d at 771-72 (holding\r\ndefendant not entitled to charge of involuntary manslaughter because \"the essence\r\nof involuntary manslaughter is the involuntary nature of the killing\" and he\r\nintentionally fired the gun); State v. Morris, 307 S.C. 480, 484, 415 S.E.2d 819,\r\n821-22 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding defendant not entitled to involuntary\r\nmanslaughter charge because the act must be unintentional and defendant\r\nintentionally fired the gun).\r\n\nWe reject Torrence's argument that the word \"unintentional\" in the involuntary\r\nmanslaughter definition should mean the defendant's intent to cause the\r\nconsequence of death or serious bodily harm when he fired the gun. Instead, we\r\nconsider the word \"unintentional\" to relate to the defendant's intent to voluntarily\r\nfire the gun. See Bozeman v. State, 307 S.C. 172, 177, 414 S.E.2d 144, 147 (1992)\r\n(explaining involuntary manslaughter charge inappropriate even though defendant\r\n\"only meant to shoot over the victim's head\" because he intended to shoot the gun).\r\nTherefore, because there is no evidence that Torrence did not intentionally fire his\r\ngun at Chaplin, he was not entitled to a charge of involuntary manslaughter.\r\nMoreover, this case does not fall under either prong of the involuntary\r\nmanslaughter definition because: (1) firing a gun is considered conduct naturally\r\ntending to cause death or great bodily harm; and (2) Torrence was not acting\r\nlawfully by brandishing the gun in a bar. See id. 307 S.C. at 177, 414 S.E.2d at\r\n147 (observing that firing a gun \"naturally tends to cause death or bodily harm\");\r\nState v. Rivera, 389 S.C. 399, 403, 699 S.E.2d 157, 159 (2010) (agreeing with\r\nState's argument that brandishing a weapon was unlawful conduct naturally\r\ntending to cause death or great bodily harm); S.C. Code Ann. § 16-23-465 (2003)\r\n(unlawful to carry a firearm onto the premises of a building selling alcoholic\r\nliquors).\r\n\r\nTorrence cites cases from North Carolina in support of his claim that the facts\r\nwarrant a charge of involuntary manslaughter. However, we must analyze this\r\ncase under the law as it currently exists in South Carolina. Under South Carolina\r\nlaw, the facts of this case require us to find that a charge of involuntary\r\nmanslaughter was not supported by the evidence. Therefore, the circuit court's\r\nrefusal to charge involuntary manslaughter is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and GEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-154","title":"State v.

Closser, of Smith & Koontz P.A., of\r\n           Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Tim McGee appeals the circuit court's order dismissing his\r\ncomplaint and entering judgment in favor of David Thornton and Thornton\r\nBrothers Construction (collectively, Thornton). We affirm.\r\n\n1. As to whether the circuit court erred by finding McGee was the general\r\ncontractor on the project, we find the record supports the circuit court's finding.\r\nSee Townes Assocs., Ltd., v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773,\r\n775 (1976) (\"In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the\r\nfindings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be\r\nwithout evidence which reasonably supports the judge's findings.\"). At trial, the\r\nhomeowner testified that he hired McGee to supervise the construction of the\r\nhome. Similarly, McGee testified that he was hired by the homeowner to\r\n\"oversee\" construction. Additionally, McGee admitted that he hired, supervised,\r\nand paid the subcontractors on the project. See S.C. Code Ann. § 40-59-20(6)\r\n(2011) (defining a residential builder as \"one who constructs, superintends, or\r\noffers to construct or superintend the construction, repair, improvement, or\r\nreimprovement of a residential building or structure\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n2. As to whether the circuit court erred in finding McGee's action to recover\r\ndamages under the contract was barred by section 40-59-30(B) of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2011), we affirm. Section 40-59-30(B) prohibits an unlicensed\r\nresidential builder from enforcing a residential construction contract. McGee\r\nconcedes that he does not have a residential home builder's license. However, he\r\ncontends the statute is intended to protect homeowners and, consequently, does not\r\napply to disputes between a contractor and subcontractor. This court has\r\npreviously interpreted the effect of section 40-59-30(B) in the context of a dispute\r\nbetween a home owner and a residential builder. See Lenz v. Walsh, 362 S.C. 603,\r\n608 S.E.2d 471 (Ct. App. 2005). This court noted that in such a dispute, \"because\r\nthe statute is plain and unambiguous, it should be applied literally; thus, where a\r\nbuilder has no license, he may not enforce the contract.\" Id. at 607, 608 S.E.2d at\r\n473 (citing Duckworth v. Cameron, 270 S.C. 647, 649, 244 S.E.2d 217, 218\r\n(1978)). However, there is no South Carolina case law interpreting the effect of\r\nthe statute on a dispute between a contractor and a subcontractor. We find the\r\nopinion of the Michigan Court of Appeals in Utica Equipment Co. v. Ray W.\r\nMalow Co., 516 N.W.2d 99 (Mich. Ct. App. 1994), instructive on this issue. In\r\nUtica, the court concluded a similar statutory prohibition in the Michigan\r\nResidential Builders Act was \"all inclusive\" and \"does not treat the status of the\r\ndefendant as an important consideration.\" Id. at 100; see also Mich. Comp. Laws\r\nAnn. § 339.2412 (2008) (barring an unlicensed residential builder from bringing\r\nany action for compensation for the performance of an act or contract for which a\r\nlicense is required). Applying this interpretation to the appellant-subcontractor's\r\naction, the court held the statute prohibited the unlicensed appellant-subcontractor\r\nfrom bringing an action against the respondent-contractor for breach of contract.\r\nId. Similar to the Michigan statute, section 40-59-30(B) only looks to the licensure\r\n\nstatus of the person or firm bringing the action to enforce a residential building\r\ncontract. See § 40-59-30(B) (precluding an action to enforce a residential building\r\ncontract by \"a person or firm who first has not procured a license or registered with\r\nthe commission and is required to do so by law\"). Because McGee did not have a\r\nresidential builders license, we find section 40-59-30(B) precluded him from\r\nbringing an action to enforce a residential construction contract.\r\n\r\n3. As to whether McGee can recover under a negligence theory of recovery, we\r\nfind the economic loss rule precludes McGee from recovering in tort. \"The\r\npurpose of the economic loss rule is to define the line between recovery in tort and\r\nrecovery in contract.\" Sapp v. Ford Motor Co., 386 S.C. 143, 147, 687 S.E.2d 47,\r\n49 (2009). The economic loss rule bars recovery in tort for loss of the expected\r\nbargain from the base transaction or for damage to the property purchased. Id.; 7\r\nS.C. Jur. Architects & Engineers § 31 (2013). In this instance, McGee seeks\r\ncompensation for the cost of repairs to the home and for Thornton's alleged double-\r\nbilling. We find these damages were economic losses. Moreover, because McGee\r\nwas not the home buyer in this instance, we find the narrow exception to the\r\neconomic loss rule recognized in the residential home context does not apply in\r\nthis case. See Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber & Mfg. Co., 299 S.C. 335, 347, 384\r\nS.E.2d 730, 737-38 (1989) (recognizing a builder may be liable to a home buyer in\r\ntort despite the fact the buyer suffered only economic losses where the builder has\r\nviolated a legal duty); id. at 347, 384 S.E.2d at 737 (\"The 'economic loss rule' will\r\nstill apply where duties are created solely by contract. In that situation, no cause of\r\naction in negligence will lie.\").\r\n\r\n4. As to whether the circuit court erred in dismissing the case after all the evidence\r\nhad been presented, we find this issue abandoned on appeal. See Pack v. S.C.\r\nDept. of Transp., 381 S.C. 526, 532, 673 S.E.2d 461, 464 (Ct. App. 2009) (finding\r\nan issue abandoned because the appellant failed to provide supporting authority).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and GEATHERS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-157","title":"State v.

On appeal, Herrmann argues the trial court erred by: (1)\r\nrefusing to instruct the jury that the testimony of an informer who provides\r\nevidence against the defendant for expected gain, the hope of reward, or for\r\npersonal advantage or vindication must be examined and weighed by the jury with\r\ngreater care than the testimony of an ordinary witness; and (2) refusing to\r\nreconsider the forty-five year sentence imposed when, at sentencing, Herrmann\r\nfailed to fully argue mitigation facts in support of a sentence of thirty years. We\r\nfind no error of law in the trial court's decision, nor do we find any prejudice;\r\ntherefore, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities: State v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 195, 624 S.E.2d 443, 445 (Ct. App.\r\n2005) (\"An appellate court will not reverse the trial court's decision regarding jury\r\ninstructions unless the trial court abused its discretion.\"); State v. Burkhart, 350\r\nS.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 303 (2002) (noting in order \"to warrant reversal, a\r\ntrial judge's refusal to give a requested [jury] charge must be both erroneous and\r\nprejudicial\" to the defendant); State v. Mattison, 388 S.C. 469, 478, 697 S.E.2d\r\n578, 583 (2010) (\"In reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the court's\r\njury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.\"); State\r\nv. Campbell, 297 S.C. 24, 26, 374 S.E.2d 668, 669 (1988) (\"It is elementary that in\r\nthe course of the trial of a criminal case, the trial judge must refrain from all\r\ncomment which tends to indicate his opinion as to the weight or sufficiency of\r\nevidence, the credibility of witnesses, the guilt of the accused, as to the\r\ncontroverted facts.\"); State v. Gowan, 178 S.C. 78, 86, 182 S.E. 159, 162 (1935)\r\n(\"Generally speaking, any instruction is erroneous which unduly emphasizes the\r\nright of the jury to pass upon the weight and effect of the testimony of any\r\nparticular witness, whether it be the defendant, or any other witness.\"); S.C.

As to whether the trial court erred in denying Mack's motion to quash: State v.\r\nShoemaker, 276 S.C. 86, 88, 275 S.E.2d 878, 879 (1981) (affirming the trial court's\r\ndecision to deny a motion to quash because the defendant knew the crime she was\r\nbeing prosecuted for and there was no indication the defendant was unfairly\r\nprejudiced); State v.

Stewart, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Sylvester Golden and Golden Property, LLC (collectively,\r\nGolden Property) appeal the circuit court's (1) denial of their motions for a directed\r\nverdict on Martha Lynne Angradi and Donald Scott McLorie's (collectively, the\r\npurchasers) fraud claim; (2) denial of their motion for judgment notwithstanding\r\nthe verdict (JNOV) on the purchasers' fraud claim; and (3) ruling precluding\r\nMr. Golden from testifying that the house at issue passed an inspection before the\r\npurchasers bought the home. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. We affirm the circuit court's denial of Golden Property's motions for a directed\r\nverdict on the purchasers' fraud claim. Initially, we note that Golden Property has\r\npresented numerous arguments in favor of their assertion that the circuit court\r\nerred in denying their directed verdict motions. However, the only argument\r\nGolden Property raised at trial in support of their directed verdict motions was that\r\nthe purchasers had no right to rely on Mr. Golden's representations because Mr.\r\nGolden was not the owner of the house. Accordingly, the remainder of Golden\r\nProperty's arguments on appeal are not preserved for our review. See Holly Woods\r\nAss'n of Residence Owners v. Hiller, 392 S.C. 172, 189, 708 S.E.2d 787, 796 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2011) (holding \"the appellant's failure to raise a particular issue in its directed\r\nverdict motion precludes appellate review of that issue\"); see also Rule 50(a),\r\nSCRCP (\"A motion for a directed verdict shall state the specific grounds\r\ntherefor.\").\r\n\r\nAs to Golden Property's argument that is preserved, namely that the purchasers had\r\nno right to rely upon Mr. Golden's representations because he was not the owner of\r\nthe home, we find the circuit court did not err in denying Golden Property's\r\ndirected verdict motions. In the context of fraud, \"[t]he right to rely must be\r\ndetermined in light of the plaintiffs['] duty to use reasonable prudence and\r\ndiligence under the circumstances in identifying the truth with respect to the\r\nrepresentations made to [them].\" Armstrong v. Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 219, 621\r\nS.E.2d 368, 375 (Ct. App. 2005). In the instant case, we find that evidence\r\nsupported a finding that the purchasers reasonably relied upon his representations\r\nregarding the condition of the house. Specifically, it is undisputed that Mr. Golden\r\nassembled the house, and evidence supported a finding that he represented himself\r\nas the owner of the house. Further, although he was not on the title to the house,\r\nMr. Golden had a financial interest in selling the home based on his relationship\r\nwith the owner, Edgar Lail. Specifically, Mr. Golden testified that Lail purchased\r\nthe house for less than its value and agreed to pay Mr. Golden \"some remaining\r\n\nfunds whenever the house sold.\" Pursuant to this agreement, Lail paid him\r\n$11,900 upon the sale of the house. Mr. Golden's ongoing relationship with Lail\r\nwas more akin to a partnership than that of merely a listing agent and seller.\r\nAccordingly, evidence supported a finding that the purchasers reasonably relied\r\nupon Mr. Golden's representations concerning the house. Based on the above\r\nevidence, the circuit court did not err in denying Golden Property's motions for a\r\ndirected verdict on the purchasers' fraud claim.\r\n\r\n2. We affirm the circuit court's denial of Golden Property's JNOV motion. The\r\nfacts cited above supporting the denial of Golden Property's motions for a directed\r\nverdict on the purchasers' fraud claim also support the jury's verdict in favor of the\r\npurchasers on their fraud claim. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in\r\ndenying Golden Property's JNOV motion. See Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279,\r\n300, 536 S.E.2d 408, 419 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"A motion for JNOV may be granted\r\nonly if no reasonable jury could have reached the challenged verdict. The jury's\r\nverdict will not be overturned if any evidence exists that sustains the factual\r\nfindings implicit in its decision.\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n3. Golden Property's claim that the circuit court erred in precluding Mr. Golden\r\nfrom testifying that the house at issue passed an inspection by Greenville County\r\nauthorities is not preserved for appellate review. Golden Property failed to proffer\r\ntestimony regarding a satisfactory inspection of the house during trial and solely\r\nrelied upon the circuit court's in limine ruling in presenting their case. Our\r\nsupreme court and this court have emphasized that even when the circuit court\r\ngrants a motion in limine, it is not a final ruling on the admissibility of the\r\nevidence. Accordingly, the party opposing the motion must subsequently proffer\r\nthe evidence during trial in order to preserve the issue for appellate review. See\r\nS.C. Dep't of Highways & Pub. Transp. v. Galbreath, 315 S.C. 82, 83 n.2, 431\r\nS.E.2d 625, 627 n.2 (Ct. App. 1993) (noting that our \"[s]upreme [c]ourt has\r\nindicated that even where a motion in limine is granted, it is not the final ruling on\r\nthe admissibility of the evidence,\" and that, accordingly, the party opposing a\r\nmotion in limine that is granted must subsequently proffer the evidence during trial\r\nto preserve the issue for appellate review).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-172","title":"Charleston County DSS v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. As to whether the family court erred in finding the notice sent to Mother at her\r\nGeorgia address notified Mother of the trial:1 Rule 5(b)(1), SCRCP (providing in\r\npart, when service is required upon a party, it \"shall be made by delivering a copy\r\nto him or by mailing it to him at his last known address or, if no address is known,\r\nby leaving it with the clerk of court\"); id. (providing \"[s]ervice by mail is complete\r\nupon mailing of all pleadings and papers subsequent to service of the original\r\nsummons and complaint\"); NCNB S.C. v. Floyd, 303 S.C. 261, 264, 399 S.E.2d\r\n794, 796 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding the defendant was properly served under Rule\r\n5(b)(1), SCRCP, when the address to which the notice was mailed was the last\r\naddress known to the plaintiff).2\r\n\r\n\r\n1 While the family court's final order terminating Mother's parental rights states\r\nthat: \"[t]he last address that [Mother] provided to the Department of Social\r\nServices . . . is in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina[,]\" this does not affect the merits\r\nof this issue because the Department sent notice of the trial to Mother at her\r\nGeorgia address, the same address where Mother was personally served with the\r\nsummons and complaint, and the record contains evidence that Mother's address\r\nhas not changed since the commencement of the termination of parental rights\r\naction.\r\n2 While Mother and the Department of Social Services contend otherwise, Rule\r\n17(a), SCRFC, which is entitled \"Failure to File Answer,\" does not apply to the\r\ncircumstances of this case because Mother filed an answer. See Rule 17(a),\r\nSCRFC (\"In domestic relations matters, even though the defendant does not file an\r\nanswer, notice of the time and date of the merits hearing shall be given to the\r\ndefendant. If the defendant is not represented by counsel, notice as required by this\r\nrule shall be sufficient if mailed to the defendant at his last known address, by\r\ncertified mail, return receipt requested. The defendant may be heard at the merits\r\n\n2. As to whether the family court abused its discretion in denying Mother's motion\r\nfor a continuance: S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 51, 413 S.E.2d\r\n835, 838 (1992) (\"The granting or denial of a continuance is within the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial [court] and is reviewable on appeal only when an abuse of\r\ndiscretion appears from the record.\"); id. at 51-52, 413 S.E.2d at 838 (\"[T]he denial\r\nof a motion for a continuance on the ground that counsel has not had time to\r\nprepare is rarely disturbed on appeal.\"); State v.

Traywick, of Traywick Law Offices, LLC, of\r\n        Isle of Palms, and James E. Sterling, of Smith, Jordan,\r\n        Lavery & Lee, P.A., of Piedmont, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n        Sarah B. Nielsen and Thad H. Westbrook, of Nelson\r\n        Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP, of Columbia, for\r\n        Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: In this lender liability case, Appellant Angela Drexler (Drexler)\r\nseeks review of the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to Respondent\r\nCitiMortgage, Inc. (CitiMortgage) on the ground that Drexler's claims against\r\nCitiMortgage are barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel. CitiMortgage\r\nseeks dismissal of Drexler's appeal on the ground that she did not timely serve her\r\nNotice of Appeal. We decline to dismiss the appeal and affirm the circuit court's\r\norder.\r\n\r\n1. As to the timeliness of Drexler's appeal (Drexler's issue # 11), we conclude that\r\nshe timely served the Notice of Appeal. See Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR (requiring\r\nservice of the notice of appeal within thirty days after receipt of written notice of\r\nentry of the order or judgment but stating that when a timely post-trial motion has\r\nbeen made, \"the time for appeal for all parties shall be stayed and shall run from\r\nreceipt of written notice of entry of the order granting or denying such motion\").\r\n\r\nWhile we do not condone counsel's submission of the consent order to Judge\r\nJefferson, the consent order does not express an intent on the part of Drexler or\r\ncounsel to withdraw the Rule 59(e) motion. Further, Drexler was not judicially\r\nestopped from proceeding on the Rule 59(e) motion because the representation in\r\nquestion, i.e., that CitiMortgage was no longer a party to the action, was in the\r\nnature of a conclusion of law rather than an assertion of fact. See Cothran v.\r\nBrown, 357 S.C. 210, 215, 592 S.E.2d 629, 631 (2004) (stating that South Carolina\r\nhas adopted the doctrine of judicial estoppel as it relates to matters of fact, not\r\nlaw); Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 251, 489 S.E.2d 472, 477\r\n(1997) (\"[T]he doctrine [of judicial estoppel] does not apply to conclusions of law\r\nor assertions of legal theories.\").\r\n\r\nMoreover, Drexler did not benefit from the representation in question; the consent\r\norder was void in the absence of the consent of CitiMortgage, who, by virtue of the\r\npending Rule 59(e) motion, was still a party to the action. See Se. Hous. Found. v.\r\nSmith, 380 S.C. 621, 640, 670 S.E.2d 680, 690 (Ct. App. 2008) (indicating that a\r\nRule 59(e) motion removes the finality of the challenged judgment). Therefore,\r\njudicial estoppel would not apply even if the representation in question had been\r\none of fact. Cothran, 357 S.C. at 216, 592 S.E.2d at 632 (holding that for the\r\ndoctrine of judicial estoppel to apply, the party taking the position must have been\r\nsuccessful in maintaining a previous position and have received some benefit from\r\nit).\r\n\nEven if Judge Young's ruling that Drexler effectively withdrew her Rule 59(e)\r\nmotion had been binding on her, the thirty-day period for serving the Notice of\r\nAppeal would have begun on March 7, 2012, when Drexler received written notice\r\nof the entry of the order in which Judge Young made this ruling. See De Leon v.\r\nMarcos, 659 F.3d 1276, 1281 (10th Cir. 2011) (holding that the appellant was\r\nentitled to tolling of the time period for filing his notice of appeal, despite the fact\r\nthat he withdrew his Rule 59 motion, because the district court issued an order\r\nacknowledging the withdrawal); United States v. Rodriguez, 892 F.2d 233, 236 (2d\r\nCir. 1989) (\"[A] timely motion staying the finality of a judgment will toll the\r\nperiod for appeal at least until the motion is withdrawn, and probably until the\r\ndistrict court takes some official action to acknowledge the withdrawal of the\r\nmotion.\"); Brae Transp., Inc. v. Coopers & Lybrand, 790 F.2d 1439, 1442 (9th Cir.\r\n1986) (holding that the date of withdrawal of the appellant's Rule 59 motion was\r\nApril 1, 1985, the date on which the district court issued an order declaring the\r\nRule 59 motion withdrawn, rather than March 12, 1985, the date on which the\r\nappellant filed its \"Notice of Intention to Dismiss Action,\" and, thus, the district\r\ncourt did not err in recognizing that the time for appeal began to run on April 1);\r\nGardner v. Newsome Chevrolet-Buick, Inc., 304 S.C. 328, 330, 404 S.E.2d 200,\r\n201 (1991) (\"Since our Rules of Procedure are based on the Federal Rules, where\r\nthere is no South Carolina law, we look to the construction placed on the Federal\r\nRules of Civil Procedure.\"); see also Nadeau v. Nadeau, 861 P.2d 754, 757 (Haw.\r\nCt. App. 1993) (\"[T]he motion's tolling effect continued until the family court's . . .\r\norder granted Father's motion to withdraw it. Our decision is based on the facts\r\nthat the motion [for reconsideration] could not be withdrawn without the family\r\ncourt's approval and jurisdictional matters require certainty.\").\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, Drexler timely served her Notice of Appeal.\r\n\r\n2. As to whether the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment without\r\ngiving Drexler an opportunity to engage in discovery (Drexler's issue # 3), we\r\naffirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authority: Dawkins v.\r\nFields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 439 (2003) (holding that when the\r\nnonmoving party requests a delay in ruling on a summary judgment motion until\r\nfurther discovery may be completed, the party \"must demonstrate the likelihood\r\nthat further discovery will uncover additional relevant evidence and that the party\r\nis not merely engaged in a fishing expedition\" (citation and quotation marks\r\nomitted)).\r\n\r\n3. As to the circuit court's conversion of the motion to dismiss into a summary\r\njudgment motion (Drexler's issue # 2), Drexler was not prejudiced by this\r\n\nprocedure. All facts that were material to the questions of res judicata and\r\ncollateral estoppel were contained within the public records attached to the motion\r\nto dismiss and CitiMortgage's memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss.\r\n\r\nIn any event, because the circuit court filed the order granting summary judgment\r\nover four months after CitiMortgage filed the motion to dismiss and almost three\r\nmonths after CitiMortgage filed its memorandum in support of the motion, Drexler\r\nhad an opportunity to introduce evidentiary matters of her own. Cf. Pitts v.\r\nJackson Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 352 S.C. 319, 329, 574 S.E.2d 502, 506 (Ct. App.\r\n2002) (recognizing the circuit court's implicit conversion of a motion to dismiss\r\ninto a summary judgment motion by considering materials outside the pleadings\r\nwhen the parties had ample opportunity to introduce additional evidentiary matters\r\nwithin the six months between the filing of the memorandum to which the outside\r\nmaterials were attached and the filing of the order dismissing certain claims).\r\n\r\n4. As to the party identity element of res judicata (Drexler's issue # 7), we affirm\r\npursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: Beall v. Doe, 281\r\nS.C. 363, 369 n.1, 315 S.E.2d 186, 189 n.1 (Ct. App. 1984) (\"A final judgment on\r\nthe merits in a prior action will conclude the parties and their privies under the\r\ndoctrine of res judicata in a second action based on the same claim as to issues\r\nactually litigated and as to issues which might have been litigated in the first\r\naction.\" (emphasis added)); Yelsen Land Co. v. State, 397 S.C. 15, 22, 723 S.E.2d\r\n592, 596 (2012) (\"For purpose of res judicata . . . the concept of privity rests not on\r\nthe relationship between the parties asserting it, but rather on each party's\r\nrelationship to the subject matter of the litigation.\" (citing Richburg v. Baughman,\r\n290 S.C. 431, 434, 351 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1986))); Richburg, 290 S.C. at 434, 351\r\nS.E.2d at 166 (\"The term 'privy', when applied to a judgment or decree, means one\r\nso identified in interest with another that he represents the same legal right.\"); cf.

D.S.C. 2011) (defining a real party in interest\r\nin the context of Rule 17 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as a \"person who\r\npossesses the right to enforce the claim and who has a significant interest in the\r\nlitigation\"); id. (\"[T]here is a general view, which has been accepted in this\r\njurisdiction and others, that a loan servicer is a 'party in interest' and has standing\r\nby virtue of its pecuniary interest in collecting payments under the terms of the\r\nnote and mortgage.\" (citations omitted)).\r\n\r\n5. As to the subject matter element of res judicata (Drexler's issue # 8), we affirm\r\npursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: Rule 60(b),\r\nSCRCP (\"[T]he procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be by\r\n\nmotion as prescribed in these rules or by an independent action.\" (emphasis\r\nadded)); Michau v.

Judy, 383 S.C. 1, 10, 677 S.E.2d 213, 218 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2009) (\"[I]dentity of the subject matter of the two suits rests not in their\r\nforms of action or the relief sought, but rather, in the combination of the facts and\r\nlaw that give rise to a claim for relief.\"), aff'd, 393 S.C. 160, 712 S.E.2d 408\r\n(2011); Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 24(1) (1982) (\"When a valid and\r\nfinal judgment rendered in an action extinguishes the plaintiff's claim pursuant to\r\nthe rules of merger or bar . . . the claim extinguished includes all rights of the\r\nplaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the\r\ntransaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose.\"); id.\r\n§ 25 (stating that the plaintiff's claim is extinguished even when the plaintiff is\r\n\"prepared in the second action (1) [t]o present evidence or grounds or theories of\r\nthe case not presented in the first action, or (2) [t]o seek remedies or forms of relief\r\nnot demanded in the first action\").\r\n\r\n6. As to Drexler's issues # 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b),\r\nSCACR, and the following authorities: State v. Stanko, Op. No. 27224 (S.C.

Tire Kingdom appealed the denial to the full\r\ncommission, which dismissed the appeal as interlocutory. We affirm.1\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\nIn September 2010, the single commissioner signed a consent order involving Tire\r\nKingdom and Respondent Megan Haley. Under the order, Tire Kingdom was to\r\npay Haley temporary total disability, but the full extent of its liability was to be\r\nheld in abeyance. Tire Kingdom was also to pay certain medical bills and choose\r\nthe authorized treating physicians.\r\n\r\nIn April 2011, Tire Kingdom requested a hearing, alleging Haley reached\r\nmaximum medical improvement and refused medical treatment. Tire Kingdom\r\nsought to terminate compensation and credit for alleged overpayments. On July 7,\r\n2011, the commission sent a notice to the law firm then representing Haley and to\r\ncounsel for Tire Kingdom that a hearing was scheduled for July 26, 2011. On July\r\n20, 2011, Haley's attorney advised the commission that the parties settled the\r\nmatter on a clincher. Tire Kingdom confirmed the message, and the commission\r\nremoved the hearing from its docket.\r\n\r\nHaley's attorney later advised Tire Kingdom that Haley would not accept the\r\nagreement and returned all settlement documents to Tire Kingdom's attorney. Tire\r\nKingdom then moved for an order from the commission requiring Haley to execute\r\nthe clincher agreement. The single commissioner denied the motion in a summary\r\norder. Tire Kingdom requested review by the full commission, which dismissed its\r\nappeal as interlocutory.\r\n\r\n1.     Tire Kingdom argues the full commission erred in dismissing its appeal as\r\ninterlocutory because (1) the order it sought to appeal involved the merits of the\r\ncase and (2) the order affected a substantial right. We disagree.\r\n\r\nUnder section 42-17-50 of the South Carolina Code (1985 and Supp. 2012), the\r\ncommission shall review a workers' compensation award upon a timely application\r\nfor review. Under 8 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-701 (2012), either or both of the\r\nparties may request commission review of a decision by a single commissioner.\r\n\r\nRegarding settlement agreements, this court has stated:\r\n\r\n             [Section 42-9-390 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n             2012)] requires settlement agreements to be in writing\r\n             and filed with the Commission. The requirement that a\r\n             settlement agreement be committed to writing necessarily\r\n             anticipates that the agreement will also be signed by the\r\n\n            parties and that it will not be binding until they have done\r\n            so. While closing papers which reflected the agreement\r\n            of the parties had in fact been prepared in this instance,\r\n            they were never signed; and until they were signed, the\r\n            papers represented nothing more than a settlement\r\n            proposal.\r\n\r\nMackey v. Kerr-McGee Chem. Co., 280 S.C. 265, 271, 312 S.E.2d 565, 568 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1984) (emphases added).2 We found nothing in the record on appeal\r\nindicating the agreement had been signed by the parties and filed with the\r\ncommission. Tire Kingdom had only a settlement proposal, which conferred no\r\nenforceable rights. Moreover, it still has the option to request another hearing\r\nbefore the commission to terminate compensation and receive credit for\r\noverpayments.\r\n\r\n2.    In any event, we reject Tire Kingdom's second argument, i.e., that the\r\ncommission erred in failing to find Haley entered into a binding agreement to\r\ndispose of her case.\r\n\r\nCiting the current version of section 42-9-390 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n2012), Tire Kingdom correctly argues there is no longer any requirement that the\r\ncommission approve a settlement if the claimant and employer are represented by\r\ncounsel. Section 42-9-390, however, still requires the employer to \"file a copy of\r\nthe settlement agreement with the commission.\" This requirement also appears in\r\n8 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-803 (2012), which includes specific instructions on\r\nhow the filing is to be accomplished. The record contains no evidence that Tire\r\nKingdom complied with the statute or the regulation; therefore, there was no\r\nbinding agreement that could be enforced by the commission.\r\n\r\n3.    Finally, Tire Kingdom complains that the orders of both the single\r\ncommissioner and the full commission did not include sufficient findings of fact\r\nand conclusions of law for meaningful review by this court. We disagree.\r\n\r\n2 The version of section 42-9-390 appearing in the 2012 Supplement to the South\r\nCarolina Code was in effect during this litigation. Under the version of the statute\r\nin effect when Mackey was decided, all settlement agreements had to be approved\r\nby the commission. The present version of the statute does not require approval by\r\nthe commission if each party is represented by an attorney; however, in such a\r\ncase, the employer must still file a copy of the agreement with the commission.\r\n\nWe found no evidence in the record that Haley executed the clincher agreement or\r\nthat Tire Kingdom filed it with the commission. Without these formalities, the\r\nagreement cannot be enforced. The absence of specific findings of facts in the\r\norders of the single commissioner and the full commission does not prevent\r\nmeaningful review by this court. See Aristizabal v. I.J. Woodside-Div. of Dan\r\nRiver, Inc., 268 S.C. 366, 370-71, 234 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1977) (stating the hearing\r\ncommissioner must make a specific, express finding \"[i]f a material fact is\r\ncontested\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, THOMAS, and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-167","title":"State v.

Muller, of\r\n            Rosen, Rosen & Hagood, LLC, of Charleston, for\r\n            Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Henry Swinton, Jr., Leroy Swinton, Earsilee Nesbit, Jack\r\nSwinton, Charles Swinton, Nathaniel Swinton, and James Swinton (collectively,\r\n\nthe Swintons) appeal from a condemnation proceeding, in which the master-in-\r\nequity granted the Commissioners of the Public Works of the Town of Mount\r\nPleasant (CPW) a water and sewer easement across the Swintons' property. On\r\nappeal, the Swintons argue the testimony of CPW's expert on the easement's value\r\nwas inadmissible. The Swintons contend CPW's failure to present any admissible\r\nevidence on the value of the Swintons' property required the master to grant their\r\nmotion for a directed verdict and accept the Swintons' valuation of their property as\r\na matter of law. We affirm.\r\n\r\nThe master did not err in denying their directed verdict motion. Initially, we note\r\nthe Swintons frame their appeal as one from the denial of a directed verdict\r\nmotion. Although the Swintons' motion at the close of the evidence was couched\r\nas a \"directed verdict\" motion, governed by Rule 50, SCRCP, this was a non-jury\r\naction. Because Rule 50, by its nature, is only applicable to jury trials, the proper\r\nmotion was a motion for involuntary non-suit under Rule 41, SCRCP. See\r\nWaterpointe I Prop. Owner's Ass'n, Inc. v. Paragon, Inc., 342 S.C. 454, 458, 536\r\nS.E.2d 878, 880 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting that a motion styled as a directed verdict\r\nin non-jury action was a motion for non-suit under Rule 41(b), SCRCP, and\r\ntherefore reviewing as such); see also Rule 41(b), SCRCP (\"After the plaintiff in\r\nan action tried by the court without a jury has completed the presentation of his\r\nevidence, the defendant[] . . . may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon\r\nthe facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.\"). Therefore, the\r\nSwintons' appeal is from the master's factual findings as a judge in a non-jury\r\naction at law. See Sea Cabins on the Ocean IV Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v. City of\r\nN. Myrtle Beach, 337 S.C. 380, 388, 523 S.E.2d 193, 197 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding\r\nan action brought by a property owner against a municipality for the taking of the\r\nowner's property without just compensation is an action at law); see also\r\nNormandy Corp. v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 386 S.C. 393, 402, 688 S.E.2d 136, 141\r\n(Ct. App. 2009) (\"Condemnation actions are actions at law.\"). In an action at law\r\ntried without a jury, the master's findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless\r\nthey are found to be without evidence reasonably supporting them. See Stanley v.\r\nAtl. Title Ins. Co., 377 S.C. 405, 409, 661 S.E.2d 62, 64 (2008).\r\n\r\nThe master was within his discretion to consider CPW's expert testimony in\r\nrendering his decision. See Fields v. Reg'l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25-\r\n26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005) (holding the admission or exclusion of an expert's\r\ntestimony is within the sound discretion of the court and will not be overturned\r\nabsent an abuse of discretion). We further find the Swintons suffered no prejudice\r\nby the master's consideration of CPW's expert testimony as the record clearly\r\nreflects that the master afforded the expert's testimony less weight based on the\r\n\ndate the appraisal occurred. See id. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509 (\"To warrant reversal\r\nbased on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the\r\nerror of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., that there is a reasonable\r\nprobability the [decision] was influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack\r\nthereof.\").\r\n\r\nIn addition, the master specifically held that he accepted the Swintons' valuation of\r\nthe property, not CPW's valuation, in determining the amount of just\r\ncompensation. At no point in the order does the master state he relied upon CPW's\r\nexpert's valuation in rendering his decision. Rather, the master held,\r\n\r\n             In determining the just compensation for the easement\r\n             herein, this Court accepts the Landowner's valuation of\r\n             the parent tract of land of $100,000.00 per acre but finds\r\n             that this value must be reduced to $85,000.00 per acre\r\n             based on the fact that the Landowners' property is\r\n             situated in the rear of a subdivided tract of land and has\r\n             no frontage along Canyon Lane.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). The clear language of the order states the master relied upon the\r\nSwintons' valuation but reduced the valuation based on the location of the property\r\nin relationship to the entire tract and the lack of direct access to the frontage road.\r\nWe find this reduction reasonable based on the circumstances and because the\r\naward was within the range of evidence presented to the court. See Stanley, 377\r\nS.C. at 409, 661 S.E.2d at 64 (finding that in an action at law tried without a jury,\r\nthe master's findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless they are found to be\r\nwithout evidence reasonably supporting them).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, WILLIAMS, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2013-UP-170","title":"Lawson v.

Neal, III, of Columbia, for \n\r\n            Respondent/Appellant. \n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This consolidated appeal arises from a final order of divorce and\r\nfrom an order finding the parties' mediation agreement is not binding. On appeal,\r\nRespondent/Appellant Ann Altman (Wife) argues the family court erred by finding\r\nno binding agreement exists between the parties. Appellant/Respondent James\r\n\nAltman (Husband) argues the family court erred by: (1) finding Husband's pension\r\nis both a marital asset and income; (2) finding the 81-acre Peak Property is marital\r\nproperty; (3) valuing the 8.57-acre Peak Property; (4) finding Husband did not seek\r\ncontribution from Wife for any debt in his name; (5) finding the Twisted Hill\r\nproperty is nonmarital; (6) awarding the lake lot to Wife; (7) accepting Wife's\r\nappraisal of the 8.57-acre Peak Property instead of Husband's appraisal; and (8)\r\nequitably dividing the marital estate. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR,\r\nand the following authorities:\r\n\r\n1.

Greenwood Sch. Dist. 50, 365 S.C. 629, 634,\r\n620 S.E.2d 65, 67 (2005) (\"In order for a contract to be valid and enforceable, the\r\nparties must have a meeting of the minds as to all essential and material terms of\r\nthe agreement.\"); Rule 6(g), ADR Rules (\"Upon the parties reaching an agreement,\r\nthe mediator shall provide a Memorandum of Agreement to the parties, attorneys\r\nof record, and guardians ad litem of record. It is the obligation of the parties to\r\nseek approval of the agreement by the family court.\").\r\n\r\n2.

Code Ann. § 20-3-620(B)(13) (Supp. 2012)\r\n(stating in apportioning marital property, the court must consider \"liens and any\r\nother encumbrances upon the marital property, which themselves must be\r\nequitably divided, or upon the separate property of either of the parties, and any\r\nother existing debts incurred by the parties or either of them during the course of\r\n\nthe marriage\"); Kennedy v. Kennedy, 389 S.C. 494, 502, 699 S.E.2d 184, 188 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2010) (\"Section 20-3-620(B)(13) creates a rebuttable presumption that a debt\r\nof either spouse incurred prior to the beginning of marital litigation is a marital\r\ndebt and must be factored in the totality of equitable apportionment.\").\r\n\r\n7.
