McDuffie Stone, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lawrence W. Morris appeals the imposition of restitution by the circuit court.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nMorris and his brother entered an unoccupied but furnished home in the nighttime.Â  The home had been burgled sometime that day or in the previous week. Â While Morris was in the home, the police arrived.Â  Morris ran out the back door, leaving his vehicle in the yard. \r\nThe State indicted Morris for â€œwillfully and unlawfully enter[ing] the dwelling of [the victim] without consent and with the intent to commit a crime therein . . . in the nighttime.â€Â  At a guilty plea hearing, Morris denied taking anything from the house and explained he was there to purchase drugs.Â  The trial court accepted his plea on that basis, stating: Â â€œThe crime does not have to be stealing but a crime. Â And youâ€™ve admitted to doing that so I will accept the guilty plea.â€Â  The court sentenced Morris to six years under the Youthful Offenders Act (YOA). Â \r\nTen days later, a different judge presided over a restitution hearing.Â  Morris argued he should not have to pay restitution because he had not admitted to stealing any property.Â  The victim testified approximately $159,000 worth of personal property was missing from the house.Â  Morrisâ€™ ex-girlfriend testified Morris admitted breaking into a home. Â She further testified she saw numerous items at Morrisâ€™ house that she believed were stolen.Â  Morris did not admit to her that he stole the items. Â \r\nThe trial court found it did not have to make a specific finding about the amount stolen or that â€œthe defendant stole each one of these itemsâ€ in order to impose restitution.Â  The court concluded Morris was involved in the theft of the property from the home and ordered Morris to pay $200 per month while on YOA parole, amounting to approximately $12,500. Â Morris appeals the restitution order.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMorris argues the trial court erred in ordering restitution because he did not admit to stealing any of the items and therefore his conviction did not support the award of restitution.Â  We disagree.Â  The trial judge has broad discretion in determining the manner, method, and amount of restitution.Â  State v. Cox, 326 S.C. 440, 442, 484 S.E.2d 108, 109&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  South Carolina Code Section 17-25-322 governs this issue and permits the trial court to take a number of things into account, including: Â 1) the financial resources of the defendant and the victim; 2) the ability of the defendant to pay restitution; 3) the anticipated rehabilitative effect on the defendant; 4) the effects on the victim of the defendantâ€™s criminal acts; and 5) the mental, physical, and financial well-being of the victim.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-322(B) (2003).Â  The judge must make specific findings of the underlying facts and circumstances on the record. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-322(C) (2003).\r\nAt the restitution hearing, the trial court heard the testimony of the defendant and the victim.Â  The court found: Â â€œfor purposes of this restitution hearing, [Morris] was involved in the theft of . . . items from that house . . . .â€Â  The court acknowledged the victim claimed losses of $159,000 and concluded it was not necessary to make a specific finding as to the value of items stolen.Â  The court considered Morrisâ€™ support obligation to his child, and other factors, and found Morris would be unable to pay restitution of $159,000.Â  The court thus ordered $200 per month during parole, totaling approximately $12,500.Â  We find the court sufficiently considered the statutory factors in imposing restitution and discern no abuse of discretion.

Weinberg, Jr., of Sumter, for Respondent Whitakerâ€™s Trust. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  CompTrust AGC (â€œCompTrustâ€) and Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. cross-appeal from a judgment in an action seeking to recover payment from an underlying workersâ€™ compensation case.Â  CompTrust contends the trial court erred in failing to extend the liability of Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. to Whitakerâ€™s Trust.Â  Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. contends the trial court erred in admitting evidence of a previous workersâ€™ compensation case and failing to instruct the jury on two requested charges.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe Whitaker family runs Whitakerâ€™s, Inc., a company classified as a cabinet manufacturer for workersâ€™ compensation purposes.Â  The Whitaker family also maintains a trust, Whitakerâ€™s Trust, which is a separate entity set up by the Whitaker family purportedly for the benefit of the Mormon church.Â  Edsel Whitaker and his son Whit Whitaker are trustees.Â  In 1999, Whitakerâ€™s Trust owned approximately one hundred rental units, along with a farm, a warehouse, and the Mayesville plant, which Whitakerâ€™s Inc. leased from Whitakerâ€™s Trust.Â  Whitakerâ€™s Trust does not have any employees.Â  \r\nAlthough classified as a cabinet manufacturer, Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. was used as a real estate management service for Whitakerâ€™s Trust.Â  Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. oversaw the management of Whitakerâ€™s Trust properties for a fee of $48,000 per year. \r\nOver the years, Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. also oversaw the construction of several apartment buildings for Whitakerâ€™s Trust.[2]Â  The Whitakers employed Judy Jernigan at various times over the course of ten years.Â  Jernigan is a friend of the Whitaker family, and began her working relationship with them on a contractual basis while employed full-time with a construction company.Â  In the early years, Jernigan worked for the Trust apartments.Â  She was paid in full by the Trust after completing odd jobs such as landscaping, cleaning around the apartments, getting the apartments ready to be shown to potential tenants, and painting a pool at one of the apartment complexes.Â  During the relevant period for purposes of this appeal, Jernigan was employed by Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. to work on an apartment project called Jernigan Trail.Â  Jernigan Trail is a twenty-four unit apartment building Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. constructed for Whitakerâ€™s Trust.Â  Jernigan performed various duties at the job site, including answering the phone, receiving and signing for deliveries, sending and receiving faxes, making sure that subcontractors showed up for work, and escorting various county inspectors out to the job site.Â  \r\nOn July 8, 1999, Jernigan was injured on this job site while using a lull to unload roof trusses from a delivery truck.Â  Subsequently, Jernigan filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim with CompTrust, Whitakerâ€™s Inc.â€™s workersâ€™ compensation carrier.Â  CompTrust listed Jernigan as a clerical employee.Â  CompTrust provided workersâ€™ compensation benefits to Jernigan; however, upon receiving Jerniganâ€™s claim for workersâ€™ compensation, CompTrust performed an investigation and determined that Jernigan was either not an employee of Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. or had been misclassified as a clerical employee.Â  CompTrust paid Jerniganâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation benefits and medical treatment under a â€œreservation of rights.â€Â  \r\nCompTrust instituted this action, which included both legal and equitable claims, against Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. and Whitakerâ€™s Trust, seeking to recover funds it paid as a result of Jerniganâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of CompTrust and against Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. for breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and negligent misrepresentation.Â  CompTrust was awarded $98,468.14 for reimbursement of workersâ€™ compensation benefits, $120,914.04 in total medical benefits, $15,952.00 in additional expenses, and $150,000.00 in punitive damages.Â  The trial court did not submit CompTrustâ€™s equitable claims against Whitakerâ€™s Trust to the jury.Â  Post trial, the trial court denied Whitakerâ€™s, Inc.â€™s motion for a new trial, granted Whitakerâ€™s, Inc.â€™sÂ  motion for a new trial nisi (reducing the additional expenses from $15,952.00 to $4,074.40), and denied CompTrustâ€™s equitable causes of action against Whitakerâ€™s Trust.Â  Both parties appeal.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CompTrust Appellate Issues \r\nAs CompTrust frames the issues, its cause of action against Whitakerâ€™s Trust for equitable subrogation turns on whether Whitakerâ€™s Trust was either the de facto employer or statutory employer of Jernigan.[3]\r\nConcerning the argument that Whitakerâ€™s Trust was the de facto employer of Jernigan, CompTrust cites no authority, case law or otherwise, to support this contention.Â  CompTrust merely refers to various dealings of the Whitakers and concludes that Whitakerâ€™s Trust â€œis nothing but a sham.â€Â  In the absence of citation to supporting legal authority, we must consider this issue abandoned.Â  See Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 312 S.C. 102, 106 n.3, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 n.3 (Ct. App. 1993) (stating issues raised in a brief but not supported by authority are deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal).\r\nTurning to the statutory employment argument, we concur with the trial court that CompTrust has failed to prove Whitakerâ€™s Trust was the statutory employer of Jernigan.Â  \r\nSection 42-1-400 of the South Carolina Code (1976) provides that an owner is liable to a worker of a contractor or subcontractor who is injured while performing or executing any work that is a part of the ownerâ€™s trade, business or occupation.Â  Specifically, this section states:\r\n\r\n  When any person, in this section and 42-1-420 and 42-1-430 referred to as â€œowner,â€ undertakes to perform or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person (in this section and 42-1-420 to 42-1-450 referred to as â€œsubcontractorâ€) for the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the work any compensation under this Title which he would have been liable to pay if the workman had been immediately employed by him.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400.Â  Whether a worker is a statutory employee is a question of law for the court.Â  Glass v. Dow Chem. Co., 325 S.C. 198, 202, 482 S.E.2d 49, 51 (1997).Â Â  Our courts have outlined three factors to consider when determining whether the activity constitutes work which is part of the ownerâ€™s trade, business, or occupation: (1) whether the activity is an important part of the trade or business, (2) whether the activity is a necessary, essential, and integral part of the trade, business or occupation, or (3) whether the activity has been performed by employees of the employer.Â  Id. at 201, 482 S.E.2d at 50.Â  \r\nThe evidence shows Whitakerâ€™s Trust hired Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. to perform both management and construction duties.Â  The record indicates Jernigan was hired to work mainly in construction, although she also had clerical duties.[4]Â  Jernigan was injured while performing her construction duties.Â  Therefore, the question we must determine is whether Whitakerâ€™s Trust was in the trade, business, or occupation of construction.Â  See Harrell v. Pineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 322, 523 S.E.2d 766, 771 (1999) (â€œ[A]n owner should not be able to avoid workersâ€™ compensation liability by subcontracting out the work of their business.â€).\r\nThe record is not clear on this critical issue.Â  It appears that at the time of Jerniganâ€™s injury, Whitakerâ€™s Trust owned about one hundred apartment units.Â  We are not certain how many of these units were constructed by Whitakerâ€™s Trust.Â  Part of our uncertainty is based on the evasive testimony given by the Whitakers.Â  Nevertheless, we feel it would be inappropriate to speculate by holding that construction was an important or integral part of the business of Whitakerâ€™s Trust. \r\nWhitakerâ€™s Trust, through its trustees, contracted work out to various professionals.Â  Here, Whitakerâ€™s Trust hired Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. to build apartments.Â  The evidence establishes that Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. employed Jernigan and that Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. was in the business of constructing residential dwellings.Â  The record does not establish that Whitakerâ€™s Trust was in the construction business; rather, Whitakerâ€™s Trust was the legal vehicle for holding title to various properties.Â  It was Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. that engaged in the construction and management oversight of the properties.Â  We fully recognize the improper conduct and gamesmanship of Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. vis-Ã -vis its workersâ€™ compensation policy with CompTrust, but this nefarious conduct does not warrant the leap that Whitakerâ€™s Trust is the statutory employer of Jernigan.Â  \r\nA number of cases applying the Glass factors are analogous to the case at hand.Â  See Wilson v. Duke Power Co., 273 S.C. 610, 616-17, 258 S.E.2d 101, 104-05 (1979) (finding construction work performed for owner-developer of property was not part of his trade, business or occupation, and he was therefore not a statutory employer); see also Raines v. Gould, Inc., 288 S.C. 541, 543, 343 S.E.2d 655, 657 (Ct. App. 1986) (stating that ordinarily, in determining workersâ€™ compensation employee-employer relationship, construction work, such as building a factory structure or making electrical installations, is considered outside the trade or business of a manufacturer).Â Â  Nor may we discern from the record that this is a case where, by size and nature of its business, Whitakerâ€™s Trust is accustomed to carrying on a more or less ongoing program of construction.Â  See Raines, 288 S.C. at 545, 343 S.E.2d at 658 (â€œIf however a business by its size and nature is accustomed to carrying on a more or less ongoing program of construction . . . construction work delegated to a contractor may be considered a part of its trade or business.â€). Â \r\nIn asserting the existence of a statutory employer relationship under section 42-1-400, CompTrust accepted the burden of setting forth evidence to prove its case.Â  We find, as did the trial court, that CompTrust has failed to meet its burden of showing Whitakerâ€™s Trust was in the trade, business, or occupation of construction under the Glass factors.Â  Because Whitakerâ€™s Trust is not in the business of construction, we find no error in the holding of the trial court that Jernigan was not a statutory employee of Whitakerâ€™s Trust.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. Appellate Issues \r\nA. Â Admission of Evidence \r\nWhitakerâ€™s, Inc. contends the trial court erred in allowing into evidence the fact that another insurance company successfully sued Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. in a previous lawsuit for misclassifying employees for workersâ€™ compensation purposes.[5]Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe trial court has considerable latitude in ruling on the admissibility of a defendantâ€™s prior bad acts.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 155-56, 485 S.E.2d 903, 911 (1997).Â  Evidence is relevant and admissible if it tends to establish or make more or less probable some matter at issue and to bear directly or indirectly thereon.Â  Assoc. Mgt., Inc. v. E.D. Sauls Constr. Co., 279 S.C. 219, 221, 305 S.E.2d 236, 237 (1983).Â  Absent a clear abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law, the trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Peterson v. Natâ€™l R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 399, 618 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2005).Â  \r\nIn finding the evidence relevant and admissible, the trial court cited Rule 404(b), SCRE, which governs the admissibility of â€œother crimes, wrongs, or acts.â€Â  The trial court reasoned that the information regarding the prior lawsuit was admissible to show Whitakerâ€™s, Inc.â€™s classification of Jernigan as a clerical employee was not the result of a mistake or accident, but rather showed intent to misclassify.Â  Rule 404(b) states:Â  \r\n\r\n  Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts.Â  Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.Â  It may, however, be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.[6]\r\n\r\n Even though such evidence may be relevant, it may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\nAt trial, one of the claims brought against Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. was for breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  To prove breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, a plaintiff must show, among other things, a fraudulent intent relating to the breaching of the contract. Â Floyd v. Country Squire Mobile Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 51, 53-54, 336 S.E.2d 502, 503-04 (Ct. App. 1985). â€œFraudulent intent is normally proved by circumstances surrounding the breach.â€Â  Id. at 54, 336 S.E.2d at 503-04.\r\nThe record shows that Jernigan was misclassified as a clerical worker.Â  Whitakerâ€™s, Inc.â€™s claims to the contrary find no traction in this record.Â  Several witnesses, including Jernigan, testified Jernigan was misclassified as a clerical worker.Â  Whether Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. mistakenly or intentionally misclassified Jernigan was clearly relevant.Â  The measuring stick for Rule 403 admissibility is whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  The trial court acted well within its discretion in admitting the prior lawsuit in which Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. misclassified an employee.Â  Moreover, the evidence against Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. on this issue was overwhelming even without evidence of the prior lawsuit.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jury Charge \r\nWhitakerâ€™s, Inc. contends the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury regarding the laws and regulations concerning an employerâ€™s ability to stop payment of compensation benefits under the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. sought these charges to show that CompTrust could have moved to stop payment to Jernigan once it had completed its investigation into the improper classification of Jernigan.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œWhen instructing the jury, the trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.â€Â  Cohens v. Atkins, 333 S.C. 345, 349, 509 S.E.2d 286, 289 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œWhen a request to charge is timely made and involves a controlling legal principle, a refusal by the trial court to charge the request constitutes reversible error.â€Â  Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. 547, 555, 481 S.E.2d 444, 448 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  A jury charge that is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.Â  Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 392, 574 S.E.2d 215, 220 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, the appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  Daves v. Cleary, 355 S.C. 216, 224, 584 S.E.2d 423, 427 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œTo warrant reversal for refusal to give a requested instruction, the refusal must have not only been erroneous, but prejudicial as well.â€Â  Cohens, 333 S.C. at 349, 509 S.E.2d at 289.Â  \r\nThe first Request to Charge made by Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. comes from the case of Halks v. Rust Engâ€™g Co., 208 S.C. 39, 45-46, 36 S.E.2d 852, 855 (1946).Â  The request stemmed from a situation where a carrier disputed a claim under the theory that the claimant was no longer due compensation.Â  Specifically, Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. requested the trial court charge the following:Â  \r\n\r\n  Rule 12 of the Commission contemplates that if the insurance carrier desires to stop further payment of compensation under a temporary award, application should be made to the Commission for permission to do so.Â  Notice should be given to the employee.Â  The question can then be determined by the Commission.Â  Where there is a disagreement between the parties as to the right to discontinue further weekly compensation, the matter will be placed on the calendar for a hearing.Â  If it is determined that the carrier is entitled to discontinue further payments of total temporary disability, the question of any permanent disability or disfigurement would then be ripe for determination.Â  But apart from the foregoing requirements we do not think the right of a claimant to further compensation can be adjudicated without notice to him and an opportunity afforded for a hearing, if he desires to contest the issue.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the second Request to Charge involved the duties of the workersâ€™ compensation commission when a claimant is no longer due compensation.Â  It stated: \r\n\r\n  (F) After the one-hundred-fifty-day period has expired, the commission shall provide by regulation the method and procedure by which benefits may be suspended or terminated for any cause, but the regulation must provide for an evidentiary hearing and commission approval prior to termination or suspension unless such prior hearing is expressly waived in writing by the recipient or the circumstances identified in Section 42-9-260(B)(1) or (B)(2) are present.Â  Further, the commission may not entertain any application to terminate or suspend benefits unless and until the employer or carrier is current with all payments due.\r\n  (B) Once temporary disability payments are commenced, the payments may be terminated or suspended immediately at any time within the one hundred fifty days if:\r\n  (1) the employee has returned to work; however, if the employee does not remain at work for a minimum of fifteen days, temporary disability payments must be resumed immediately; or\r\n  (2) the employee agrees that he is able to return to work and executes the proper commission form indicating that he is able to return to work.Â  \r\n\r\n    See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-260(B) &amp; (F) (Supp. 2006).Â  The trial court refused these requests and found that the subject matter of the requests was ancillary to the issues in the case, the law would only confuse the jury, and it would treat this issue as a matter of law after the jury determined the damages.Â  The trial court also found that the issue raised in the requested charges was not properly â€œframed by the pleadings.â€Â  \r\nThe issue of whether CompTrust should have moved to stop payment to Jernigan once it had completed its investigation into the improper classification of Jernigan constituted an affirmative defense that must have been specifically pled under Rule 8(c), SCRCP.Â  Because Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. failed to do so, and for the reasons stated by the trial court, there was no error in refusing these requests to charge.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe judgment of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  There are numerous inconsistencies in the testimony concerning Whitakerâ€™s, Inc.Â Â  For example, Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. disputed the contention that Whitakerâ€™s, Inc. built apartments for Whitakerâ€™s Trust even though Whitakerâ€™s Trust acknowledged this fact it its brief.Â  The Whitakers also provided inconsistent testimony as to Judy Jerniganâ€™s role at Whitakerâ€™s, Inc.Â  \r\n[3]Â  CompTrust seemingly raises this as two separate issues: equitable subrogation and restitution.Â  CompTrustâ€™s restitution claim, however, is merely a method of recovery for its equitable subrogation claim.Â  \r\n[4]Â  The exact nature of Jerniganâ€™s job was, of course, a hotly contested issue at trial.Â  Our reading of the record leads us to believe Jernigan was hired to be the â€œproject managerâ€ of Jernigan Trail when Whit Whitaker could not be there.Â Â  \r\n[5]Â  See Wassau v. Whitakerâ€™s, Inc., Op. No. 2001-UP-156 (filed February 7, 2001) (finding that the Defendant had attempted to avoid payment of workersâ€™ compensation premiums by classifying certain employees as â€œindependent contractorsâ€).Â  \r\n[6]Â  The South Carolina rule limits the use of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts to those enumerated in State v.

Miller, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 07-UP-200\r\nSubmitted April 2, 2007 â€“ Filed May 3, 2007\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        James Furtick, of Bennettsville, pro se Appellant.Â  \r\n        Nikole D. Haltiwanger, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  James Furtick appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order regarding access to his prison records pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (S.C. Code Ann. Section 30-4-10 et seq.).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAs an inmate in the South Carolina Department of Corrections, Furtick filed a request with the Departmentâ€™s Director of Executive Affairs for â€œcopies ofâ€ his â€œcomplete prison recordâ€ . . . â€œfrom the year 1968 through the present, excluding medical records.â€Â  It is not clear from the record what correspondence was then exchanged between the parties, but an unsatisfied Furtick filed a complaint with the circuit court.Â  He also wrote to the Director of Executive Affairs inquiring about the lack of response to his request.Â  Furtick filed a motion for summary judgment, and that motion was heard on March 10, 2006.Â  \r\nThe circuit court issued an order stating that Furtickâ€™s â€œrequest was not sufficiently clear so that the SCDC could properly respond . . . .â€Â  The court provided that Furtick should have thirty days to submit a written request to the Department â€œspecifically identify[ing] the information which he is requesting . . . so that the SCDC will be able to determine the exact documents which [he] is requesting.â€Â  The courtâ€™s order further required Furtick to pay twenty-five cents per copy.Â  \r\nFurtick raises several issues on appeal, alleging error on the part of the circuit court as follows:Â  (1) in determining that his FOIA request was not sufficiently clear, (2) in dismissing his claim when a motion to compel was pending, (3) in ruling Furtick had to purchase his prison records before he could inspect them, (4) in dismissing his case with prejudice, and (5) by not granting Furtickâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  â€œSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2005).Â  â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€Â  George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFurtick first claims the court erred in finding that his request was not sufficiently clear.Â  We disagree.Â  At the hearing on Furtickâ€™s motion for summary judgment, the Department indicated there had been correspondence back and forth between Furtick and the Department regarding his request.Â  Furtick, while continuing to request his entire prison file, seemed to focus on obtaining information regarding his â€œwork creditsâ€ relating to the calculation of his release date.Â  According to the Department, Furtickâ€™s correspondence was â€œconfusingâ€ and requests for production filed by Furtick asked for information by generally referencing certain statutes, making it difficult to determine which documents would be responsive.Â  Based on this discussion, it appears Furtickâ€™s request was broad and lacked specificity.Â  Therefore, the courtâ€™s determination was not in error.\r\nFurtick also claims the court erred in dismissing his motion for summary judgment when his motion to compel discovery was still pending.Â  As Furtick failed to move for a continuance or ask the court to hold its ruling on his summary judgment motion in abeyance, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Degenhart v. Knights of Columbus, 309 S.C. 114, 118, 420 S.E.2d 495, 497 (1992).\r\nFurtick argues that it was error for the court to require that he pay for his records before he had the opportunity to inspect them. Â Section 30-4-30(a) of the South Carolina Code (Rev. 2007) provides â€œ[a]ny person has a right to inspect or copy any public record of a public body, except as otherwise provided by Â§ 30-4-40, in accordance with reasonable rules concerning time and place of access.â€Â  Nothing in the statute provides that records must be â€œsent toâ€ a person for inspection, and the statute does not mandate special consideration for inmates.Â  In addition, Furtick has the means to access the records he seeks.Â  He is simply required to make a sufficiently specific request and pay a fee for copying as provided by law.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-30(b) (Rev. 2007) (â€œThe public body may establish and collect fees not to exceed the actual cost of searching for or making copies of records.â€).[2]\r\nFurtick further contends the court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment.Â  The denial of a motion for summary judgment is generally not appealable.Â  See Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 476, 443 S.E.2d 379, 380 (1994) (â€œThis Court has repeatedly held that the denial of summary judgment is not directly appealable.â€).Â  Consequently, this issue is not properly before us for review.Â  \r\nFinally, Furtick contends the court erred in dismissing his claim with prejudice.Â  We disagree.Â  â€œA dismissal with prejudice acts as an adjudication on the merits and therefore precludes subsequent litigation just as if the action had been tried to a final adjudication.â€Â  Laughon v. Oâ€™Braitis, 360 S.C. 520, 527, 602 S.E.2d 108, 111 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The court heard from both Furtick and the Department, and the resulting order disposed of all the underlying matters in the suit.Â  Consequently, no purpose would be served by allowing Furtick to relitigate matters determined by the courtâ€™s order.Â  Should either side not comply with the courtâ€™s mandate, the aggrieved party can file a rule to show cause regarding the other partyâ€™s failure to comply with the order.\r\nBased on all of the foregoing, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â The standard charge imposed by the Department for copying is twenty-five cents per page.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-201","title":"State v.

Reid Cox, Jr., Special Referee \r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-202\r\nSubmitted April 2, 2007 â€“ Filed May 4, 2007Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Laâ€™Keabian D. Shaw, of Fountain Inn, for Appellants.\r\n        James E. Bryan, Jr. and Thomas J. Thompson, both of Laurens, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Laura Johnson Young (â€œRespondent Youngâ€) and Eldon Johnson Thomas (â€œAppellant Thomasâ€) originally brought this partition action as plaintiffs seeking the sale of real property.Â  An Order for Default was entered and the matter was transferred to a special referee, who ordered the property to be sold after finding it could not be divided in kind.Â  Appellant Thomas belatedly tried to oppose the partition by sale, arguing the property could, instead, be divided in kind, and she attempted to change her Â position from a plaintiff to a defendant.Â  Appellant Thomas has now joined with one of the defendants, Minnie Johnson, Jr. (â€œAppellant Johnsonâ€), and together Appellants challenge the orders of the referee.[1]Â  We affirm.[2]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis partition action involves two tracts of property located in Laurens County, South Carolina.Â  Tract One is approximately five acres; Tract Two is 70.4 acres.Â  The property was acquired in the 1950s by Minnie Johnson, Sr. and his wife, Pearlie Mae Johnson.Â  The parties to this action are their descendants.Â  Respondent Young and Appellant Thomas are two of their daughters, and Appellant Johnson is one of their sons.\r\nMinnie Johnson, Sr. died intestate on July 25, 1983, leaving as his heirs at law his wife, eleven living children, and a predeceased son who was survived by three children.Â  Upon her husbandâ€™s death, Pearlie Mae Johnson owned a two-thirds interest in the two tracts and the remaining interest was held in various proportions by their eleven living children and the three children of their deceased son.Â  Â Â \r\nOn February 18, 1993, Pearlie Mae Johnson died testate, specifically devising her interest in a residence and the five-acre Tract One to Respondent Young, subject to a life estate to be held by one of Pearlie Maeâ€™s grandsons as long as he met certain terms and conditions.Â  These terms and conditions were not met, however, and this circumstance, along with other factors, caused the ownership of both tracts of land to come into question.[3]Â  \r\nOn January 25, 2005, Respondent Young and Appellant Thomas filed this partition action.Â  They alleged the property could not be divided in kind and requested a judicial sale instead, with the proceeds to be divided among the parties according to their ownership interests.Â  A circuit court judge appointed a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the unknown defendants, designated as John Doe and Richard Roe.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nFive months later, an Order for Default was filed on June 29, 2005 after none of the defendants responded to the complaint.Â  On the same date, an Order of Reference was issued, transferring the action to a referee.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nThe referee held a hearing on October 10, 2005 attended by Respondent Young (as plaintiff) and several defendants, including Appellant Johnson.Â  Appellant Thomas, the other named plaintiff in the action, did not attend the hearing.Â  Before the decision to sell the property was formally made, however, the referee discovered the unknown defendants, John Doe and Richard Roe, could not be located for proper service, and the referee ordered service by publication in a ruling dated October 10, 2005.[4]Â  Issuance of the final order was delayed until service was completed.Â  \r\nIn the meantime, a dispute arose between Respondent Young and Appellant Thomas concerning the feasibility of dividing the subject property.Â  On October 16, 2005, Appellant Thomas notified her attorneys, who also represented Respondent Young, that she no longer wished to be represented by them.Â Â Â  \r\nAppellant Thomas retained new counsel and belatedly joined with her brother, Appellant Johnson (a named defendant), in asking the court not to sell the property.Â  Specifically, on November 10, 2005, Appellants filed an Answer and Counterclaim opposing a sale of the property and seeking, instead, a partition in kind.Â  On the same day, Laâ€™Keabian D. Shaw filed a Notice of Representation, stating she now represented Appellants.Â Â Â  Appellant Johnson had not previously filed an answer to the complaint in this action, and this filing came more than four months after the filing of the Order for Default and a month after his attendance at the merits hearing.Â  In addition, no court order was requested or obtained by Appellant Thomas authorizing the substitution of counsel or the alteration of her status as a plaintiff.Â  On December 8, 2005, Appellants also filed an Amended Answer and Counterclaim.Â  The primary difference between the two versions is that the amended pleading asserted service of process was insufficient as to Appellant Thomas.Â Â Â  \r\nOn December 14, 2005, the special referee issued his formal, written ruling in the matter determining the interests of the parties and ordering a sale of both Tract One and Tract Two.Â  The same day, Appellant Thomas prepared an Amended Complaint, requesting the dismissal of the complaint pursued by Respondent Young.Â  She also requested a partition in kind, asserting the property could be divided and should not be sold.Â  It is not clear from the record whether the Amended Complaint was ever served.\r\nThe referee thereafter issued an order on December 16, 2005, finding the filing of subsequent pleadings, specifically the Answer and Counterclaim and the Amended Answer and Counterclaim, was improper.Â  The referee stated all of the named defendants in this action had either accepted service of the original pleadings or were personally served, and the unknown defendants were served by publication.Â  In addition, Appellant Thomas was one of the two named plaintiffs when the action commenced and she still remained a plaintiff until removed by order of the court, so she could not file responsive pleadings as a defendant.Â  The referee stated Appellant Thomas could not litigate this action by being both a plaintiff and a defendant.Â  Since Appellant Thomas was and remained a plaintiff, there was no requirement that she be served with the pleadings, and Appellant Johnson was duly served and was in default and therefore he could not now file responsive pleadings.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA partition action is an equitable action heard by a judge alone; therefore, upon review an appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Anderson v. Anderson, 299 S.C. 110, 113, 382 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1989).Â  While this permits us a broad scope of review, we do not, however, disregard the findings of the special referee, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility.Â  See, e.g., Klutts Resort Realty, Inc. v. Downâ€™Round Dev. Corp., 268 S.C. 80, 91, 232 S.E.2d 20, 26&nbsp;(1977).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Amended ComplaintÂ  \r\nAppellants first contend the â€œreferee erred in not allowing Appellant Thomas to amend her complaint.â€Â  \r\nRule 15(a), SCRCP outlines the following procedure for amending a pleading:\r\n\r\n  A party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before or within 30 days after a responsive pleading is served . . . .Â  Otherwise a party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party . . . .\r\n\r\nâ€œA motion to amend is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and the party opposing the motion has the burden of establishing prejudice.â€Â  Kelly v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 316 S.C. 319, 323, 450 S.E.2d 59, 61&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994).Â  â€œThe prejudice Rule 15 envisions is a lack of notice that the new issue is going to be tried, and a lack of opportunity to refute it.â€Â  Pool v. Pool, 329 S.C. 324, 328-29, 494 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1998), quoted in Tanner v. Florence County Treasurer, 336 S.C. 552, 559, 521 S.E.2d 153, 156 (1999).\r\nAppellants contend Appellant Thomasâ€™s Amended Complaint dated December 14, 2005 should have been allowed because it was allegedly filed less than thirty days after a responsive pleading was filed.Â  On November 10, 2005, Appellants jointly filed an Answer and Counterclaim asserting the subject property could be equitably divided among the parties and should not be sold.Â  They filed an Amended Answer and Counterclaim on December 8, 2005.Â  When these responsive pleadings were filed, however, Appellant Johnson was already in default and Appellant Thomas was still one of the two named plaintiffs in the case.Â  Therefore, the responsive pleadings Appellants now rely on were improper on their face.\r\nWhile Rule 21, SCRCP does permit an existing plaintiff to become a defendant, this change generally must be accomplished by motion served on the opposing parties and approved by court order.Â  Appellant Thomasâ€™s Amended Complaint may have been allowed only pursuant to a motion to amend, which was never filed.Â  Consequently, there can be no error in this regard.[5]\r\nII. Answer and Counterclaim \r\nAppellants next contend the â€œreferee erred in dismissing the Answer and Counterclaim filed by Appellant Minnie Johnson, Jr.â€Â  They argue the pleading was timely because the Order for Default was obtained based on an affidavit that incorrectly stated all of the defendants had been served and the pleading was filed before the completion of service by publication.\r\nIn declining to allow the belated filing of responsive pleadings, the referee concluded Appellant Johnson â€œwas duly and legally served with the pleadings and was in default when the matter was heard and therefore [he] cannot now file responsive pleadings.â€Â  We find no error in the refereeâ€™s determination.Â  \r\nThe complaint in this case was filed with the Clerk of the Laurens County Court on January 25, 2005.Â  The Order for Default was filed on June 29, 2005.Â  Appellant Johnson attended the hearing on the merits in this matter on October 10, 2005; however, he did not attempt to file responsive pleadings in the case until November 10, 2005, which was a month after the hearing in the matter, more than four months after the filing of the Order for Default, and nearly ten months after the filing of the original complaint.Â  Â Â \r\nIn her brief, Respondent Young admits there was an error in the original affidavit requesting the entry of default to the extent it stated all defendants had been served when in fact, all of the named defendants had been served, but the unknown defendants had not been served by publication.Â  In light of this circumstance, the referee did not issue his final order until service by publication addressed to the unknown defendants was completed.Â  Â Â \r\nThe record contains an affidavit of service from a process server stating Appellant Johnson was served with a copy of the complaint on April 30, 2005.Â  The referee specifically found in his final order filed December 14, 2005 that Appellant Johnson had been â€œpersonally served with the [complaint].â€Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the refereeâ€™s determination that Appellant Johnson failed to file a responsive pleading in this case for more than thirty days after receiving service of the complaint.Â  Appellant Johnson was, therefore, in default when he belatedly filed his responsive pleading in November 2005, and the referee did not err in excluding the pleading on the basis it was untimely.Â  \r\nIII. Ethical Violations of Counsel \r\nAppellants assert they â€œshould be relieved from the orders of the special refereeâ€ due to the fact that â€œcounsel for Respondent Young also represented Appellant Thomas in this matter now on appeal.â€Â  They argue Respondent Young and Appellant Thomas had competing interests because Respondent Young sought a partition by sale on the basis a partition in kind was not possible, whereas Appellant Thomas disagreed and desired a partition in kind.Â  Appellants contend counselâ€™s representation violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, particularly Rule 1.9(a) of Rule 407, SCACR, which states:Â  â€œA lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that personâ€™s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.â€Â  \r\nThis issue has not been preserved for our review as there is no evidence in the record that the issue was ever both raised to and ruled on by the special referee; rather, it appears to be asserted for the first time on appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  This court is not the appropriate forum to either institute a disciplinary matter or allege a new civil action.Â  \r\nIV. Order of ReferenceÂ  \r\nAppellants lastly assert the Order of Reference should be set aside because the order was entered before the unknown defendants John Doe and Richard Roe were served by publication.Â  \r\nThis allegation was not preserved for our review.Â  Appellants did not assert this issue before the referee and have raised it for the first time on appeal.Â  In fact, Appellant Thomas was still maintaining her status as a plaintiff at the time the Order of Reference was issued and it was actually her attorney who moved for the default judgment and the Order of Reference that she now, belatedly, seeks to invalidate. Â See Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497 S.E.2d at 733 (holding an issue that is not both raised to and ruled upon by the trial court is not preserved for appeal).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Appellant Johnson died while this appeal was pending and a personal representative appears on his behalf.Â  For simplicity, we shall refer to Appellant Johnson directly as the party.\r\n[2]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] Pearlie Mae Johnsonâ€™s will provided one of her grandsons, Herbert J. Goodjoins, Jr., was to have the residence and Tract One for use during his lifetime as long as he occupied the property, maintained adequate insurance coverage, paid the taxes, and kept the property in good repair.Â  The will further provided if Goodjoins failed to abide by these terms and conditions, died, or no longer desired to live on the property, Pearlie Mae Johnsonâ€™s interest in the home and Tract One was to be transferred to Respondent Young in fee simple.Â  The referee found Goodjoins failed to maintain the property as required by the will, resulting in Pearlie Mae Johnsonâ€™s interest going to Respondent Young in fee simple.Â  We note Goodjoinsâ€™s last name also appears in the record as Goodjohn, but the former version appears in the captions of the orders on appeal so it is retained here.Â Â Â  \r\n[4] Â Service by publication was completed on October 26, 2005.Â  Â Â \r\n[5]Â  There is a question, moreover, regarding whether the referee expressly ruled on this issue.Â  In his order of December 16, 2005 the referee found Appellantsâ€™ belated filing of an Answer and Counterclaim and an Amended Answer and Counterclaim was improper.Â  The referee did not specifically discuss Appellant Thomasâ€™s Amended Complaint.Â  Counsel for Appellants sent a letter to the referee asking him to amend the December 16, 2005 order to rule on this issue, but there is nothing further in the record on this point.Â  In any event, there is no merit to this issue because there is no indication in the record that Appellant Thomas timely moved for permission to file the Amended Complaint as required by the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-203","title":"State v.

Frampton, both of Summerville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lareese Glover (â€œGloverâ€) brought this action against her brother Albert A. Glover (â€œAlbertâ€) and the Dorchester County Delinquent Tax Collector (â€œTax Collectorâ€) to set aside a tax deed issued to Albert, to recognize a constructive trust, and to confirm a prescriptive easement.Â  The circuit court dismissed the complaint for lack of standing and failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action as provided by Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  Glover appeals.Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe following facts are taken from Gloverâ€™s amended complaint and, under our standard of review, are presumed to be true for purposes of evaluating whether the complaint states a claim for relief.Â  The property at issue consists of approximately 5.9 acres located in Dorchester County, South Carolina.Â  Part of the acreage has been used for a softball field for members of the nearby Pigeon[2] Bay Community, and Glover has operated a concession stand on the property since 1981.Â  Â Â \r\nThere is no continuous chain of title for the subject property in the Dorchester County real estate records.Â  It appears the property was part of a tract of land conveyed by deed dated June 29, 1920, from William H. Johnston et al. to Thomas Glover, an uncle of Glover and Albert.Â  Thomas died in the 1940s, and the property was thereafter placed in the name of his surviving wife, Daisey Glover, as they had no children.Â  After Daisey died intestate around 1960, Thomasâ€™s brother, Samuel Glover, paid the taxes on the property for the benefit of the Pigeon Bay Community until his death in 1997.Â  Samuel is the father of Glover and her brother Albert.Â  Â Â \r\nGlover further alleges that after the death of her father, Samuel, in 1997, his children[3] paid the real estate taxes on the property each year for the benefit of the Pigeon Bay Community.Â  She asserted â€œthe [p]roperty â€˜passedâ€™ by custom, over time, in a gradual and informal way into the hands of Samuel Glover in trust for the benefit of the entire Pigeon Bay Community.â€Â  According to Glover, the property â€œhas been dedicated for the use of the [Pigeon] Bay Community in general for recreation, and it was improved and used as a community softball field from time immemorial.â€Â  Glover stated that, with the consent of her father, Samuel, and the Pigeon Bay Community, in 1981 â€œshe began to have exclusive use of an area of the [p]ropertyâ€ to run a concession stand.Â  \r\nIn the meantime, the property remained indexed and listed in the name of Daisey Glover. Â At some point, Albert contacted the Tax Collector regarding the subject property and asked that the address for tax bills be changed to his address.Â  In 2002, the Tax Collector mailed a notice of delinquent taxes on the property for the year 2001 to â€œGlover Daisey c/o Albert Glover 344 Pigeon Bay Road Summerville, SC 29483.â€Â  \r\nThe Tax Collector sold the property to Albert on October 7, 2002.Â  On March 5, 2004, the Tax Collector executed a tax deed conveying the property to Albert as the sole owner.Â  A legal description of the property was included in the deed, along with the following notation:Â  â€œNo derivation on record.â€Â  \r\nGlover brought this action against Albert and the Tax Collector in 2005, alleging claims for (1) fraud in the procurement of a tax deed, (2) constructive trust, and (3) a prescriptive easement.[4]Â  Glover essentially alleged that her family paid the real estate taxes on the property for many years until her brother Albert contacted the Tax Collector and had the address for sending tax notices changed so that the notices would be sent to him.Â  Glover contended Albert thereafter failed to pay the taxes and then purchased the property at a tax sale, thus depriving Glover and others of their interests in the property.Â  Glover asserted Albertâ€™s bidding at the tax sale was fraudulently done to obtain a clear title to the property in violation of the rights of his cotenants.Â  The circuit court dismissed the complaint in its entirety as to both Albert and the Tax Collector.Â  Glover appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA motion to dismiss a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, must be based solely on the allegations set forth on the face of the complaint.â€Â  Overcash v. S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., 364 S.C. 569, 572, 614 S.E.2d 619, 620&nbsp;(2005).Â  â€œThe motion will not be sustained if the facts alleged and the inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nâ€œ[A] judgment on the pleadings is considered to be a drastic procedure by our courts.â€Â  Russell v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 86, 89, 406 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1991); see also United Educ. Distribs., LLC v. Educ. Testing Serv.,&nbsp;350 S.C. 7, 13, 564 S.E.2d 324, 328&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œTherefore, pleadings in a case should be construed liberally and the Court must presume all well pled facts to be true so that substantial justice is done between the parties.â€Â  Overcash, 364 S.C. at 572, 614 S.E.2d at 620.Â  &nbsp;\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Standing\r\nOn appeal, Glover first contends the circuit court erred in granting the motion to dismiss because she did not have standing to maintain her suit.\r\nâ€œStanding to sue is a fundamental requirement in instituting an action.â€Â  \r\n    Joytime Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 639, 528 S.E.2d 647, 649&nbsp;(1999).Â  â€œGenerally, a party must be a real party in interest to the litigation to have standing.â€Â  Sloan v. Friends of the Hunley, Inc., 369 S.C. 20, 28, 630 S.E.2d 474, 479&nbsp;(2006).Â  â€œA real party in interest is one who has a real, material, or substantial interest in the subject matter of the action, as opposed to one who has only a nominal or technical interest in the action.â€Â  Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. Charleston County Elec. Commâ€™n, 336 S.C. 174, 181, 519 S.E.2d 567, 571&nbsp;(1999) (citation omitted).\r\nTo have standing, a plaintiff must establish (1) prejudice from a particularized injury that is not merely a matter of general interest common to all members of the public; (2) a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complaint of; and (3) a likelihood, as opposed to speculation, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.Â  Sea Pines Assâ€™n for the Prot. of Wildlife, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. &amp; Cmty. Servs. Assocs., 345 S.C. 594, 600-01, 550 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2001).\r\nAs a threshold matter, the circuit court found Gloverâ€™s action should be dismissed for lack of standing because she â€œhas failed to satisfy her burden of demonstrating a particularized harm sufficient to justify maintaining this law suit.â€Â  The court stated Glover alleged that both she and Albert, together with other members of the Pigeon Bay Community, held â€œbeneficial titleâ€ to the property through the actions of their father, Samuel Glover, and the transfer of the tax deed was improper because the property was held in a constructive trust for the benefit of members of the Pigeon Bay Community.Â  Â Â \r\nThe court remarked, â€œ[Gloverâ€™s] standing appears to arise out of her claim that she is a â€˜residentâ€™ of this Community.Â  [Glover] fails, however, to allege any particular injury either she or the Community has suffered as a result of [Albert] holding the title to this Property.Â  [Glover] also fails to demonstrate a causal connection between [Albertâ€™s] actions and any injury whatsoever; and, although she does ask that the deed be voided, she does not address how this outcome redresses any injury.â€Â Â Â  \r\nIn examining the four corners of Gloverâ€™s amended complaint, which is all we are concerned with at this preliminary stage in the proceedings, we find her allegations are sufficient to confer standing.Â  Although Glover admittedly had some apparent contradictions[5] in her pleadings, Glover did allege that she and Albert were co-owners or cotenants and that Albert had fraudulently procured a tax deed in order to establish clear title to the property and become the sole owner, thus depriving her of her interest in the property in running a concession stand.Â  In addition, Glover alleged she and the other members of the Pigeon Bay Community were deprived of their interests in seeing the property maintained for public use as a softball field and recreation area.Â  Thus, we hold Glover has standing to proceed as she has alleged a particularized injury, i.e., that she was being deprived of both her right to run the concession stand and her ownership interest in the property, and she has alleged a causal connection between Albertâ€™s procurement of the tax deed and her resulting injury.Â  \r\nII.Â  Failure to State a Cause of Action\r\nGlover next contends the circuit court erred in dismissing all of her claims for failure to state a cause of action under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.\r\nA.Â  Fraud in the Procurement of a Tax Deed \r\nAs noted by the circuit court, the Supreme Court of South Carolina recognized a cause of action for fraud in the procurement of a tax deed in Matthews v. Montgomery, 193 S.C. 118, 7 S.E.2d 841 (1940).Â  In Matthews, the plaintiff alleged the defendant fraudulently arranged for the defendantâ€™s son to purchase the defendantâ€™s property at a tax sale in order to place it out of the reach of the plaintiff and other potential creditors.Â  Id. at 128-29, 7 S.E.2d at 846. Â At the time the tax deed was procured, the plaintiff had filed a lawsuit against the defendant for a debt, and judgment in favor of the plaintiff was imminent.Â  Id. at 129, 7 S.E.2d at 846.Â  \r\nOur supreme court stated it was necessary â€œto differentiate between attacking the deeds for alleged fraud . . . and attacking them for alleged irregularities in the tax sale and proceedings.â€Â  Id. at 128, 7 S.E.2d at 846.Â  The court observed no fraud was alleged on the part of the tax collector, and the regularity of the governmental tax procedure â€œis no more of an obstacle to a suit to set aside the deeds for fraud than would the regularity and legality in form and execution of a conveyance by voluntary act of the parties interpose a shield which would protect it from attack if the requisites of fraudulent intent are present.â€[6]Â  Id. at 131, 7 S.E.2d at 847.Â  The court concluded the plaintiffâ€™s complaint asserted a claim for fraud in the procurement of a tax deed.Â  Id. at 134, 7 S.E.2d at 848.\r\nIn the current case, the circuit court, citing Matthews, among others, stated, â€œAlthough limited in number, the cases in which South Carolina courts have addressed fraud in the procurement of a tax deed all arise out of a creditor seeking recovery for fraudulent conveyance.â€Â  The court noted Glover â€œis not a creditor, [Albert] is not a debtor, and no property has been transferred to avoid a debt.Â  As such, this cause of action should be dismissed.â€Â  Â Â \r\nWe find no language in Matthews that purports to limit its application to creditors.Â  Moreover, the circuit court pointed to no specific cases expressly limiting the application of the claim in this manner.Â  The fact that fraud in the procurement of a tax deed was originally applied in a case involving the rights of creditors does not prevent its application in other factual situations.Â  Cf. Boyd v. BellSouth Tel. Telegraph Co., 369 S.C. 410, 420, 633 S.E.2d 136, 141&nbsp;(2006) (stating â€œ[r]egardless of whether an easement implied by prior use was originally recognized in a water drainage situation, this does not prevent its application in other circumstancesâ€).Â  \r\nIn addition, we find dismissal is not appropriate because there are competing inferences arising from the allegations in the complaint, such as whether Glover was a cotenant, a co-owner, or an heir.Â  See Jensen v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 297 S.C. 323, 334, 377 S.E.2d 102, 108 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œ[W]here the allegations of the complaint give rise to competing inferences on a question of material fact, dismissal of the case under Rule 12(b)(6) is not appropriate.â€).Â  Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of Gloverâ€™s claim for fraud in the procurement of a tax deed.\r\nB.Â  Constructive Trust\r\nâ€œA constructive trust will arise whenever the circumstances under which property was acquired make it inequitable that it should be retained by the one holding the legal title.â€Â  Lollis v. Lollis,&nbsp;291 S.C. 525, 529, 354 S.E.2d 559, 561&nbsp;(1987).Â  â€œA constructive trust results from fraud, bad faith, abuse of confidence, or violation of a fiduciary duty which gives rise to an obligation in equity to make restitution.â€Â  Id. (citing Searson v. Webb, 208 S.C. 453, 38 S.E.2d 654 (1946)).Â  â€œFraud is an essential element, although it need not be actual fraud.â€Â  Id. \r\nIn asserting her claim for a constructive trust, Glover alleged (1) the property â€œha[d] been dedicated for the use of the [Pigeon] Bay Community in general for recreation, and it was improved and used as a community softball field from time immemorialâ€; (2) in 1981 Glover began to have exclusive use of a portion of the property to run a concession stand with the consent of Samuel Glover and the Pigeon Bay Community; (3) Glover and Albert â€œare members of the [Pigeon] Bay Community and hold beneficial title interests in the [p]roperty by and t[h]rough the actions taken by their father, Samuel Glover, for the benefit of the Pigeon Bay Communityâ€; and (4) the tax deed transferring the property to Albert is improper because any acquisition by Albert â€œinured to the members of the [Pigeon] Bay Community under a constructive trust.â€Â  \r\nThe circuit court noted â€œ[t]he only allegations of the existence of a fiduciary relationship are unclear references to the parties being â€˜co-tenants.â€™Â  [Glover] alleged that [Albert], as a co-owner, breached this duty by buying the [p]roperty at the tax sale.â€Â  The court based its dismissal of Gloverâ€™s claim for a constructive trust on its finding â€œco-tenants generally owe no duty to each other as to property taxes absent a contractual agreement; each co-tenant is responsible for paying taxes with a right of contribution from the others.â€Â  The court further found that, â€œ[e]ven assuming [Glover and Albert] were co-tenants at some time in the past, such relationship would have ended when [Glover] took sole possession of the concession stand in 1980 [sic] . . . .â€Â  \r\nIn her amended complaint, Glover essentially alleged Albert committed fraud in obtaining the property at the tax sale by representing to the Tax Collector that he was a bona fide purchaser for value when in fact he was a co-owner of the property.Â  Glover further alleged Albert, as a co-owner, contacted the Tax Collector and changed the address for tax notices so that the notices would be sent to him, and then he intentionally allowed the property to lapse so that he could clear any other claims to the property by purchasing it at the tax sale in his name only.Â  \r\nWe hold these allegations of fraud are sufficient to state a claim for a constructive trust.Â  â€œA constructive trust arises against one who by fraud, actual or constructive, by duress or abuse of confidence, by commission of a wrong or by any form of unconscionable conduct, artifice, concealment, or questionable means and against good conscience, either has obtained or holds the right to property which he ought not in equity and good conscience hold and enjoy.â€ Â Halbersberg v. Berry, 302 S.C. 97, 106, 394 S.E.2d 7, 13 (Ct. App. 1990) (emphasis added).\r\nAlthough the circuit court focused on whether Glover had properly alleged a fiduciary relationship, we find she did assert fraud, which is a basis on which to impose a constructive trust.Â  See Lollis,&nbsp;291 S.C. at 529, 354 S.E.2d at 561&nbsp;(â€œA constructive trust results from fraud, bad faith, abuse of confidence, or violation of a fiduciary duty which gives rise to an obligation in equity to make restitution.â€ (emphasis added)); Searson, 208 S.C. at 459, 38 S.E.2d at 657 (â€œA constructive trust, unlike an express trust, is not a fiduciary relation, although the circumstances which give rise to a constructive trust may or may not involve a fiduciary relation[.]â€ (citation omitted) (emphasis added)).Â  Thus, we reverse the dismissal of Gloverâ€™s claim for a constructive trust.Â  Cf. Searson, 208 S.C. at 461-62, 38 S.E.2d at 659 (holding, construing the pleadings liberally, the plaintiff sufficiently alleged a claim for a constructive trust against her first cousin where the two orally agreed to purchase property jointly, but the defendant thereafter obtained title in his own name without the plaintiffâ€™s knowledge).\r\nC.Â  Prescriptive Easement\r\nTo set forth a claim for a prescriptive easement, a party must establish:Â  (1) the continued and uninterrupted use or enjoyment of the right for a period of twenty years, (2) the identity of the thing enjoyed, and (3) the use must have been adverse or under a claim of right.Â  Horry County v. Laychur,&nbsp;315 S.C. 364, 367, 434 S.E.2d 259, 261&nbsp;(1993); see also Jones v. Daley,&nbsp;363 S.C. 310, 316, 609 S.E.2d 597, 599-600&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).\r\nIn her amended complaint, Glover alleged that she has an easement by prescription to operate a concession stand on the property because she has exclusively operated the concession stand at community softball games for more than twenty years, the stand is clearly identified by an existing structure on the property, and she was using the property under a valid claim of right.Â  Glover averred she â€œbelieved that her use of the [p]roperty was a right given to her by family members as heirs of an owner of the [p]roperty or, alternatively, that her use was a right being claimed by her as a member of the class of beneficiaries for whom the subject [property] was being held in trust.â€Â Â Â  \r\nThe circuit court ruled Gloverâ€™s first source for a claim of right failed as a matter of law because she â€œalso specifically alleges that she and her brother are not â€˜heirsâ€™â€ and â€œ[n]o right can arise from the grant of an heir when there are no heirs.â€Â  As to the second source for a claim of right, i.e., a beneficial interest, the court ruled Glover and her brother both would hold a beneficial interest according to the complaint, and they could not hold a beneficial interest along with other members of the Pigeon Bay Community and have a claim of right sufficient to satisfy the elements for a prescriptive easement.Â  \r\nWe hold Gloverâ€™s allegations satisfy the pleading requirements at this stage to set forth a cause of action for a prescriptive easement as she has alleged a continuous and uninterrupted use of the property to operate a concession stand for twenty years, the stand is clearly identifiable, and she has used the property under an asserted claim of right.Â  Although Glover did allege at one point she was not an heir of Daisy Glover, she also alleged she and her brother were co-owners of the property and she had acquired a right to the property through family members who were heirs.Â  In addition, the fact that others also had a beneficial interest in the property does not affect the sufficiency of the pleadings.Â  Consequently, we reverse the dismissal of the claim for a prescriptive easement.Â  See Russell, 305 S.C. at 89, 406 S.E.2d at 339 (â€œWhen a fact is well pleaded, any inference of law or conclusions of fact that may properly arise therefrom are to be regarded as embraced in the averment.â€); id. (â€œMoreover, a complaint is sufficient if it states any cause of action or it appears that the plaintiff is entitled to any relief whatsoever.â€). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude Glover does have standing to bring this action and her complaint sufficiently alleges the elements of her claims for (1) fraud in the procurement of a tax deed, (2) the imposition of constructive trust, and (3) the existence of a prescriptive easement.Â  Consequently, the order directing the dismissal of Gloverâ€™s complaint for lack of standing and the failure to properly state her claims is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.[7]\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  â€œPigeonâ€ also appears as â€œPidgeonâ€ in some of the documents in the Record on Appeal referring to the Pigeon Bay Community and nearby Pigeon Bay Road.Â  For consistency, we shall use the former spelling.\r\n[3]Â  Glover is one of eight children born to Samuel and Alma Glover.Â  \r\n[4] Glover initially brought this action against Albert alleging fraud in the procurement of a tax deed and to establish a prescriptive easement.Â  Albert moved to dismiss, asserting Glover (1) lacked standing to bring the action, (2) failed to plead fraud with sufficient particularity, (3) failed to set forth facts sufficient to constitute causes of action, and (4) failed to name all necessary parties.Â  Glover filed an amended complaint, adding the Tax Collector as a necessary party and pleading the elements of fraud, thus remedying two of the alleged deficiencies.Â  Glover also added a claim for a constructive trust.Â  \r\n[5] Â The circuit court noted Glover alleged that neither she nor Albert were â€œheirsâ€ of Daisey Glover.Â  Although Glover did allege at one point that she and her brother were not heirs of Daisey Glover, this does not vitiate her allegation that she has some kind of ownership interest in the property along with her brother as the two allegations are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\r\n[6] Â The circuit court similarly observed in the case before us that Glover â€œdoes not appear to actually allege the Delinquent Tax Collector did anything improper in the process.â€Â  We note Glover added the Tax Collector as a party only after Albert moved to dismiss the complaint based partly on the alleged failure to join all indispensable parties.Â  Glover alleges in her amended complaint that the Tax Collector was given false information from Albert that caused the Tax Collector to issue a tax deed.Â  Glover affirmatively stated, however, the Tax Collector did not do anything improper in following the statutes governing tax sales and stated this would not prevent the deed from being voidable due to fraud in its procurement.Â Â Â  \r\n[7]Â  We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  In her brief, Glover requested that, in the event we upheld the circuit courtâ€™s order, we remand this case with instructions to the circuit court to grant her leave to amend her complaint â€œto properly assert the status of her father, Samuel Glover, as an heir of Thomas Glover; and, if necessary, to also amend so as to assert her own interests as a potential subsequent heir in order to proceed in a manner seeking to fully clear title to the property.â€Â  Since we are reversing the dismissal of the complaint and remanding for further proceedings, Glover should address any motions she deems appropriate to the circuit court, which may hear them in its own discretion.Â  An amendment of the pleadings might be desirable to clarify any perceived contradictory portions therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-208","title":"State v.

(Father) to their children.Â  This appeal involves only the termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights to his two minor children.Â  The family court found Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated because Father willfully failed to visit the children for a period of six months, and willfully failed to support the children for a period of six months.Â  Additionally, the family court found termination was in the best interest of the children.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2006).Â  After a thorough review of the record, pursuant to Ex Parte Cauthen, 291 S.C. 465, 354 S.E.2d 381 (1987), we affirm[1] the family courtâ€™s ruling and grant counselâ€™s petition to be relieved.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-211","title":"State v.

Propst, of Fort Mill, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Thomas Thorne appeals the family courtâ€™s order terminating his parental rights from T.J. (â€œChildâ€).Â  Thorne argues the family court erred in finding (1) Thorne willfully failed to visit Child, (2) Thorne willfully failed to support Child, (3) Thorne abandoned Child, (4) Child was in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months, and (5) termination of parental rights (â€œTPRâ€) was in the best interest of Child.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nIn a TPR case, the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before the family court grants TPR, the alleged grounds for the termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, however, we should not necessarily disregard the findings of the family court, because the family court is in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nThe family court may order TPR if â€œ[t]he child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has willfully failed to support the child.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2006).Â  Willful conduct is conduct that â€œevinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties . . . because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992).Â  From January 2003, when the South Carolina Department of Social Services (â€œDSSâ€) took Child into emergency custody, until September 2003, when Thorne was incarcerated, Thorne did not support Child.Â  Thorneâ€™s only defense is that he was not required to support Child because there was not a child support order in place requiring him to do so.Â  As the father of Child, Thorne was obligated to support Child regardless of the existence or nonexistence of a court order mandating he support Child.Â  Stinecipher v. Ballington, 366 S.C. 92, 620 S.E.2d 93 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding father was not relieved of his duty to support his child merely because childâ€™s custodial parents never requested support).Â  The family court did not err in finding Thorne willfully failed to support Child for six months. \r\nThe family court also did not err in finding TPR was in the best interest of Child.Â  Both a DSS caseworker and Childâ€™s Guardian ad Litem testified that Child was doing well with Childâ€™s foster family.Â  Child has been with this foster family for over four years, and they wish to adopt Child.Â  Conversely, Child has had almost no interaction with Thorne, both before and after Thorneâ€™s imprisonment.Â  The family court correctly found TPR was in the best interest of Child.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the family court did not err in finding Thorne willfully failed to support Child for six months and that TPR was in the best interest of Child.[2]Â  The family courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, KITTREDGE, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Because we find the family court did not err in finding Thorne willfully failed to support Child for six months, we decline to address Thorneâ€™s remaining assignments of error.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (proscribing that the family court may grant TPR â€œupon a finding of one or moreâ€ of the statutory grounds outlined in section 20-7-1572, and a finding that TPR is in the best interest of the child); Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. King, 369 S.C. 96, 101, 631 S.E.2d 239, 241 (2006) (â€œBecause one statutory ground for TPR has been met, the only issue remaining for us to consider is whether termination is in the best interest of the child.â€). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-212","title":"State  v.

Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (2002).Â  South Carolina law also allowed an insurer to exclude coverage in excess of the minimum liability coverage.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-9-20(5)(d) (2002) (proscribing that if an insurer chooses to provide excess liability coverage, the excess coverage â€œshall not be subject to the provisions of [the Act].â€).Â  Accordingly, American National was entitled to exclude coverage in excess of the statutory minimum liability coverage of $15,000.Â  \r\nIn this case, the policy American National issued to Ramsey excluded liability coverage for family members living with the insured.Â  This exclusion was triggered because at the time of the accident the decedent shared a home with the insured, the decedentâ€™s brother.Â  This exclusion was void, however, because it violated section 38-77-30 of the South Carolina Code (2002), which provides that an insured includes a resident relative.Â  \r\nThe question before the circuit court was whether the exclusion was void only to the extent it excludes minimum liability coverage provided by statute, or void as to the entire policy.Â  American National argued the exclusion was void only to the extent of the statutory minimum liability coverage, and, therefore, American National owed Ramsey $15,000, which American National already paid.Â  Ramsey argued the exclusion was void to the full policy limits, and, therefore, American National owed Ramsey $235,000 (the $250,000 Policy limit minus the $15,000 statutory minimum limit American National already paid Ramsey).Â  The circuit court ruled the exclusion was void only to the extent of the statutory minimum liability coverage.Â  \r\nWe concur with the circuit court.Â  In Hansen v. USAA, 350 S.C. 62, 565 S.E.2d 114 (Ct. App. 2002), we held that excess coverage beyond the statutory minimum liability coverage is governed by the terms of the contract.Â  Hansen controls this case.[2]Â  Thus, American National could (and did) exclude excess coverage beyond the statutory minimum liability coverage of $15,000.Â  Because American National has already paid Ramsey the statutory minimum liability of $15,000, it has satisfied its obligation to Ramsey under the policy.Â  \r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n[2]Â  Ramsey argues Hansen is distinguishable because in Hansen the policy expressly provided that the insurer would cover the statutory minimum liability coverage, while in this case the policy does not.Â  Hansen is not distinguishable for this reason because the policy at issue in this case provides that American National will cover the statutory minimum liability coverage:\r\n\r\n  CONFORMITY WITH STATE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS\r\n  When we certify this policy as proof under a state financial responsibility law, it will comply with that law to the extent of the coverage and limits of liability required by that law. \r\n\r\n(emphasis in original). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-216","title":"State v.

Taggart, of Columbia, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Tina Jean N. (Mother) appeals from the family courtâ€™s order terminating her parental rights to her minor child based on a finding that the child was harmed and it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nMother and Clifford S. (Father) were never married; however, their relationship produced a child.Â  The child, born in December 2001, has always remained in the custody of Mother.Â  Father exercised very limited visitation with the child.Â  In October 2004, he sought to increase his visitation with the child.Â  \r\nOn February 7, 2005, Father picked the child up for the childâ€™s first overnight visit with Father.Â  While in Fatherâ€™s custody, the child was taken to a farm where Father frequently worked.Â  The child was seen getting up off the ground with a bull calf running away. Â It was assumed the calf had kicked the child.Â  Father did not take the child to a doctor for any medical care.Â  On February 8, he returned the child to Mother.Â Â  \r\nMother examined the child after learning about the possible incident with the calf and found a quarter size bruise.Â  The child was sore, but behaved normally.Â  The following day, Mother took the child to a previously scheduled ENT visit for follow-up regarding an ear infection.Â  Dr. Brown noticed numerous bruises to the childâ€™s face and lower arms.Â  Mother explained the bruises were caused when the child was trampled by the calf.Â  Dr. Brown noted his suspicion of abuse, but indicated he did not believe it was the situation.Â  Â \r\nOn February 10, 2005, Father again picked the child up for an overnight visit.Â  He kept the child until February 12, when he returned the child to Mother.Â  Father believed the time to be 12 to 12:30 p.m. when he returned the child.Â  Mother believed it was between 2 and 2:30 that afternoon.Â  When the child was returned, Mother found the child had been burned on its arm and back.Â  Father explained the burn occurred when the child fell into a bath of exceedingly hot water.Â  \r\nAt 3:39 Mother called her family doctor, Dr. Ardis. Â During the conversation, she relayed the fact the child had bruising that was getting worse and that the child had been burned.Â  Dr. Ardis instructed her to take the child to the emergency room at Palmetto Health Baptist in Easley.Â  The child arrived at the hospital at approximately 4:00 p.m. with life threatening injuries.Â  \r\n The child had five broken ribs; a â€œbucket handleâ€ fracture of her forearm; internal bleeding around her liver and adrenal gland; second degree burns to her arm; burns to the left side of her abdomen; scabs on her face and ear; areas behind her ear where hair had been pulled out; â€œslash burnsâ€ to her face; a massive bruise to her buttocks; a one-inch tear to her perineum; and numerous other bruises, scars, and scabs throughout her body.Â  The child required a blood transfusion due to the massive injuries she sustained.Â  Also found was a loop scar, which is emblematic of abuse by whipping with a belt or cord.Â  Due to the extreme injuries, the child was air lifted to Greenville Memorial Hospitalâ€™s Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).Â  \r\nThe child was taken into protective custody and a probable cause hearing was held on February 14.Â  The child remained in the hospital for thirteen days, until February 25, when the child was placed with a foster care home.Â  The Department of Social Services (DSS) brought this action for termination of parental rights (TPR) against Mother and Father on the ground that the child has been harmed as defined in section 20-7-490, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.Â  Hearings were held over multiple days which resulted in extensive testimony regarding the injuries sustained by the child.\r\nDr. Michael Avant, a pediatric critical care physician that treated the child at Greenville Memorial Hospital, testified to the childâ€™s terrible injuries.Â  He explained that several of the injuries were older than a week, and others were inflicted within forty-eight hours of the child arriving at the hospital.Â  He also testified the child was in pain when she arrived and needed â€œsignificant pain management.â€ Â Â \r\nDr. Avant stated he learned the reasons given by the parents for the injuries were the child fell into a hot bath causing the burns and was kicked by a calf causing the bruising.Â  Dr. Avant explained the injuries suffered by the child were not consistent with falling in a tub or being kicked by a calf.Â  He testified the injuries were â€œnonaccidental.â€Â  \r\nDr. Avant averred the child would have been in obvious need of immediate medical attention from the number and extent of injuries.Â  Regarding Motherâ€™s delay in seeking medical care after the child was allegedly returned home at 2:00 in the same condition he witnessed at the hospital, Dr. Avant opined:Â  â€œThis child obviously needed medical attention immediately.Â  You know, to me these were impressive injuries that should have resulted in alarm.Â  Any delay I would have to question.â€Â  \r\nIn discussing some of the specific injuries, Dr. Avant stated he believed the tear to the childâ€™s perineum was caused by something being forced into the child or either a very severe straddle injury, neither of which would be consistent with a kick by a calf. Â He testified some of the scars on the childâ€™s legs looked like cigarette burns that were more than a couple days old.Â  Finally, he testified the burns on the childâ€™s arm and abdomen clearly were not caused by a fall into a tub of water, but instead looked like â€œit [was] poured down her.â€ \r\nDr. Nancy Henderson, the medical director of the trauma center at Greenville Hospital System, testified she reviewed the childâ€™s medical records and found the previous fifty-one visits to physicians to be â€œconcerning.â€Â  She was surprised Mother would not have taken the child to see a doctor after the alleged incident with the calf given Motherâ€™s history of reporting a wide variety of ailments.Â  Â \r\nDr. Henderson was bothered by the amount and frequency of doctorâ€™s visits as well as whether a true need existed for some of the childâ€™s medications.Â  She was also â€œvery concerned that maybe some of the symptoms that [were] being shared to the physicians were not there.â€Â  Dr. Henderson testified that because the child was later doing so well without any medication, there was concern that either the ailments did not exist or were being exaggerated.Â  Finally, she opined Munchausen by Proxy was a real possibility as an explanation for the complete resolution of the childâ€™s medical problems once the child was removed from Motherâ€™s care. \r\nDr. Lori Carnsew evaluated the child after she was removed from the parents and again shortly before the hearing on May 16, 2005.Â  She stated the child was healing and was no longer taking the medications she was prescribed while in Motherâ€™s care.Â  Additionally, she stated: â€œThere are no signs currently of any illnesses.â€Â  \r\nNext Dr. Carnsew testified regarding a couple of the childâ€™s injuries.Â  She testified there were areas behind the childâ€™s ears where hair was missing and either slowly growing back or still missing.Â Â  She stated the only explanation for the missing hair was that it was pulled out.Â  Finally, she testified the child had a â€œlooped scarâ€ on her back.Â  She testified a looped scar is â€œpretty much a hallmark of child abuseâ€ and â€œitâ€™s made with an electrical cord or some kind of cord being folded in half and used as a whip.â€Â  \r\nAnn Moser, a nurse in the PICU, testified the child was in excruciating pain and had to receive morphine due to her injuries.Â  Moser recounted statements made by the child which were admitted pursuant to section 19-1-180 of the South Carolina Code.Â  â€œSeveral asked, you know, what happened or if she had a boo-boo or whatever.Â  And at one point she had said, â€˜My momma did it.Â  Mommy did it.â€™â€Â  \r\nMoser opined that the injuries suffered by the child were not at all consistent with being kicked or trampled by a calf or resulted from a fall.Â  Â Moser testified the injuries were, in her experience, the result of abuse.Â  In addressing Motherâ€™s delay in seeking medical care from 2:30 until 3:39, Moser stated unequivocally:Â  â€œAnything longer than one minute or two minutes to look at her, I believe would have been neglect.â€Â  \r\n The child also made statements to three additional nurses while in Greenville Memorial Hospitalâ€™s PICU.Â  Caroline Cullinane testified the child told her â€œMommy did itâ€ when she was asked about her hurt arm.Â  Jenny Rohr testified the child told her that â€œmy mommyâ€ caused the â€œboo-booâ€ on her belly and nose.Â  When asked about her arm, Rohr stated the child told her that her mommy and daddy did it.Â  Brenda Dawley, the third nurse, explained:Â  â€œI said, how did you get that owie on your nose? . . . And she answered me, â€˜Mommy.â€™â€Â  Dawley then continued:Â  â€œAnd I said, did your â€“ â€˜Your mommy did that?â€™ And she said, â€˜Yes.â€™Â  I said, â€˜Well, why would she do that?â€™ And she said, â€˜Because she hates me.â€™â€\r\n Mother also presented several witnesses.Â  Motherâ€™s father testified that Mother and the child have a loving relationship.Â  He further testified that the child called most women mama if the child heard someone else call them by that name.Â  Several witnesses testified the child was a happy, cheerful girl that was well cared for by Mother and had a great relationship with Mother. Â \r\nDenise Sudlek, a friend of Mother and formerly a registered nurse, testified the bruises and other injuries were not visible when she saw the child the week before February 12.Â  She also stated she was the person who recommended Mother keep a journal of bruises and scrapes the child received because then Mother would be able to show the doctor how things happened and the doctor could help determine if something was wrong.Â  However, on cross-examination, she admitted having concerns about the number of doctor visits to which the Mother took the child.Â  Additionally, Sudlek was worried about the behavior of the child in which the child would repeatedly get up from the table to tell her mother that she loved her.Â  Sudlek explained, based on her experience, the behavior occurred because the child was â€œeither very insecure because of things that were going on around them or that they were being abused.â€Â  Finally, in discussing the testimony that the child indicated â€œMommyâ€ was the one that hurt her, Sudlek offered that children as young as the child â€œdonâ€™t know how to lie.â€Â  \r\nDr. Karen Ardis, a family practice physician in the office in which the child was routinely seen, testified she received the call from Mother at 3:39 p.m. that the child had been hurt.Â  Dr. Ardis described the call:\r\n\r\n  She said she was calling about [the child] that she had been kicked by a calf several days ago and had bruising.Â  She then said that the bruising she thought was getting worse.Â  And she said, yes, it is worse.Â  Itâ€™s open and draining now.Â  Then she said, but Iâ€™m not calling about the bruising, [the child] had fallen into a tub of hot water exceedingly hot water and burned herself.Â  She said and some of them look like they are second degree burns and Iâ€™m not sure what I should do.Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Ardis advised Mother to take the child to the hospital.Â  She testified if Mother waited more than five minutes after seeing this child to seek medical assistance then it would be medical neglect.Â  \r\nMother reiterated the claim that the child was kicked by a calf around February 7 while in the custody of Father.Â  She also stated Father told her the child fell into a bath of exceedingly hot water, which caused the burns.Â  She then asserted the child was not crying, though she was hurting, when Father brought her home on February 12.Â  Mother examined the child, became frantic, and gathered items to take with the child to the hospital.Â  Mother also stated the child played with her toy lawn mower and climbed onto the sofa to rest.Â  Mother stated it was immediately after viewing the child and gathering the childâ€™s blanket and doll that they headed out to the doctor. Â She stated it was after she had left the home that she called Dr. Ardis.Â  \r\nFatherâ€™s parents testified the child ate breakfast on February 12 before she returned home to Mother.Â  However, the childâ€™s paternal grandfather testified he did not run a bath the night the child allegedly fell into a bath of hot water.Â  He also stated he did not know the child had been burned until later.Â  \r\nThe Guardian ad Litem testified the child has been healing and doing well since being removed from Motherâ€™s custody.Â  She testified the child is no longer on the many medicines prescribed while in Motherâ€™s custody, nor is she suffering from any of the ailments such as chronic vomiting, asthma, or lactose intolerance. \r\n The guardian also testified regarding some of the childâ€™s behaviors since she was placed into protective custody.Â  She stated the child would hit her doll and when asked why she would say because the â€œbaby peed in its pants.â€Â  In addition, the guardian testified the child has never asked for her mother or shown signs of being homesick in the months she has been out of Motherâ€™s custody.Â  Finally, the guardian testified unequivocally that the termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights was in the best interest of the child. \r\nThe court issued a very detailed thirty-one page order in which the court recounted the testimony of the experts and other witnesses.Â  The court found there was clear and convincing evidence Mother harmed the child as defined in section 20-7-490 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  In addition, the court found clear and convincing evidence that because of the severity and repetition of the abuse it was unlikely the home could be made safe. The family court determined it was in the childâ€™s best interest that Motherâ€™s parental rights be terminated.Â  The court then ordered the parental rights of Mother be terminated and the child be placed in the custody of DSS.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSection 20-7-1578 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) mandates that the TPR statutes â€œmust be liberally construed in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from the custody and control of their parents by terminating the parent-child relationship.â€Â  See also Joiner v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000) (overruling prior cases calling for strict construction of the TPR statutes).Â  In a termination of parental rights case, the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œThe interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interest and the parental rights conflict.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578.Â  Grounds for termination of parental rights must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 608-09, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003) (citing Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982)).\r\nâ€œUpon review, the appellate court may make its own finding from the record as to whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination.â€Â  Headden, 354 S.C. at 609, 582 S.E.2d at 423.Â  The reviewing court, however, is not required â€œto ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 (1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Ground for Termination\r\nMother contends the family court erred in finding her parental rights could be terminated pursuant to section 20-7-1572(1) of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  She maintains DSS failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence the abuse was at the hands of Mother and instead, the abuse only occurred during a single incident while the child was in the care and custody of Father.Â  Finally, Mother asserts there had been no repetitive abuse of any prior instances of abuse indicating Motherâ€™s home could not be made safe once Father was not involved.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-1572(1) states:\r\n\r\n  The family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child:\r\n  (1) The child . . . has been harmed as defined in Section 20-7-490, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.Â  In determining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the parentâ€™s previous abuse or neglect of the child or another child in the home may be considered . . . .\r\n\r\nâ€œChild abuse or neglectâ€ or â€œharmâ€ is defined as occurring:\r\n\r\n  when the parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the childâ€™s welfare:\r\n  (a) inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental injury or engages in acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of physical or mental injury to the child, including injuries sustained as a result of excessive corporal punishment . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-490(2) (2005).\r\nMother points to three cases to argue that DSS failed to prove the ground for termination by clear and convincing evidence.Â  First, Mother cites Greenville County Department of Social Services v. Bowes, 313 S.C. 188, 437 S.E.2d 107 (1993).Â  In Bowes, the court found DSS failed to prove the same ground alleged in the instant case because it failed to prove the child was abused by clear and convincing evidence.Â  The court found DSS never offered any evidence â€œthe bruising in February 1991 was the result of abuse but submitted only the removal order which found physical abuse based on this incident.â€Â  Id. at 193, 437 S.E.2d at 110.Â  However, this case is easily distinguished given the abundant evidence presented over multiple days regarding the severe abuse suffered by the child.Â  Â Â Â \r\nNext, Mother points this court to South Carolina Department of Social Services v. Brown, 317 S.C. 332, 454 S.E.2d 335 (Ct. App. 1995), and Shake v. Darlington County Department of Social Services, 306 S.C. 216, 410 S.E.2d 923 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  In Brown, a child died while in the custody of the father and the mother was at work. Â All evidence indicated the mother could not have played a role in the abuse that lead to the childâ€™s death.Â  Brown, 317 S.C. at 338, 454 S.E.2d at 338.Â  Additionally, no evidence was ever presented showing the mother abused the deceased child or other children in the home or neglected any child after it was previously abused by the father.Â  Id.Â  Finally, this court found the home could be made safe for the remaining children through the removal of the father, the only one shown to have abused the deceased child.Â  Id. at 339, 454 S.E.2d at 338-39.\r\nIn Shake, this court affirmed the family courtâ€™s refusal to terminate the motherâ€™s parental rights when then only evidence in the record indicated the child was abused in a solitary incident involving excessive corporal punishment by the motherâ€™s boyfriend when the mother was not at home.Â  Shake, 306 S.C. at 220, 410 S.E.2d at 925.Â  As will be discussed below, the case at hand does not involve a single isolated incident or only one parent as abuser with the other parent being an innocent party based on the record.\r\nBased on the horrific facts discussed above, the only conclusion that can be reached is that the child suffered extreme abuse and harm.Â  The testimony clearly indicates much of the harm originated at times when Mother was in full custody of the child.Â  First and foremost, the child identified â€œmommyâ€ as the person that caused several of her injuries.Â  Four different witnesses testified the child told them that various injuries, from scabs on her face to arm injuries, were caused by Mother.Â  All witnesses testified the child was not capable of lying.Â  The testimony was admitted by the court pursuant to section 19-1-180 of the South Carolina Code (2006), and the admissibility of the testimony has not been challenged on appeal.\r\nWhile some of the harm obviously occurred at the hands of Father, Mother was also abusive.Â  The loop scar was clearly a sign of prior abuse which did not originate while the child was in Fatherâ€™s custody.Â  Other bruises, scabs, and scars were described by medical experts as older than two or three days, meaning that they likely occurred while in the custody of Mother. Moreover, the testimony by numerous individuals graphically detailed the childâ€™s injuries on February 12 and several experts testified it would have been impossible for the child to travel from Greenville to Easley in that condition.Â  Therefore, the above cases can be distinguished because there is clear and convincing evidence Mother abused the child.\r\nIn addition to the injuries detectible on February 12, there was evidence the abuse and neglect was ongoing for years.Â  Testimony by numerous medical personnel indicated it was likely Mother was manufacturing medical problems in order to seek treatment for the child.Â  In three years, the child was seen over fifty-one times by doctors.Â  The complaints ranged from acid reflux to asthma to chronic diarrhea and vomiting.Â  The child was placed on numerous medications to alleviate the symptoms, usually based in part on the histories given by Mother.Â  However, since being removed from Motherâ€™s custody, the symptoms have all resolved and the child has not required any of the prior medications.\r\nFinally, even if many of the injuries resulted from events out of Motherâ€™s control, numerous witnesses testified it was medical neglect to delay the child receiving medical treatment.Â  If the story told by the parents is to be believed, many of these injuries occurred on February 7 at the latest.Â  To wait until February 12 to seek medical attention is clearly neglect.Â  Even if the injuries resulted from events prior to the child being returned to Motherâ€™s custody at 2:30 in the afternoon on February 12, to wait over an hour until 3:39 to seek any medical advice was inexcusable and in the testimony of many witnesses, including several defense witnesses, it was blatant medical neglect.Â  \r\nThe family courtâ€™s thirty-one page order fully detailed the testimony and the evidence relied on in terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  Based on the voluminous record before us, we find there was abounding evidence supporting a finding by the family court that the child â€œhas been harmed as defined in Section 20-7-490, and because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months.â€Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Best Interest of the Child\r\nMother argues the best interest of the child are not served through TPR, but are served by being reunited with Mother.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn a termination of parental rights case, the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 133, 538 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  If the parentâ€™s and childâ€™s interests conflict, the childâ€™s interest prevails.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578.\r\nThe brutality of the abuse and the long term effects of the abuse are sufficient reasons to justify terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  Moreover, the child is thriving in her current situation.Â  After being removed from Motherâ€™s custody, the child has become free from numerous medications, which may not have been necessary.Â  In addition, the testimony indicates the child is healing, both emotionally and physically, from her injuries. Further, the guardian and others testified that the termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights is in the best interest of the child. Â Therefore, it is clear from our reading of this record that the best interest of this child is served by terminating Motherâ€™s parental rights to the child.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased upon our own view of this record, we find clear and convincing evidence supports the family courtâ€™s determination that Mother abused the child, the home could not be made safe, and termination of Motherâ€™s parental rights was in the best interest of the child.Â  Accordingly, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-222","title":"State v.

Urbanic, of Charleston and Cynthia Polk, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Nowell S. Lesser, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This is a workersâ€™ compensation case.Â  Rayford Butler (â€œClaimantâ€) was injured on July 5, 2000 when he lifted a brake drum while working for the South Carolina Department of Education (â€œthe Departmentâ€).Â  The single commissioner found 35% permanent partial disability to Claimantâ€™s spine.Â  An appellate panel of the full commission affirmed and adopted the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  The circuit court affirmed the commission to the extent it found Claimant suffered a 35% permanent partial disability to his neck.Â  The circuit court reversed the commissionâ€™s order to the extent no other compensable injury was found and remanded the case for a determination of the extent of additional permanent partial disability due to permanent injuries to Claimantâ€™s lower back.Â  The Department appeals and we reverse.[1]\r\nI.\r\nAfter Claimantâ€™s accident, he was treated by Southeastern Spine Institute for the following symptoms: low back pain radiating down his left leg to the foot, left neck pain that radiates in the left thumb and index finger, and numbness and pain in his left hand and forearm.Â  Claimant was initially treated by Dr. Jeffrey Wingate who prescribed physical therapy, epidural injections, and anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxing drugs.Â  Claimant also had a CT myelogram which revealed a L3-4 foraminal bulge as a result of an annular tear which displaces the L4 nerve root.Â  When Claimantâ€™s symptoms persisted, Dr. Wingate referred Claimant to Dr. Leonard Forrest.Â  Dr. Forrest scheduled Claimant for a nerve conduction study.Â  The nerve conduction study, performed by Dr. Robert Richardson on April 6, 2001, showed no evidence of cervical or lumbar radiculopathy.Â  \r\nA functional capacity evaluation conducted on October 4, 2001, revealed that â€œthe patient manifested some self-limiting behaviorâ€ and â€œit might be reasonable to allow him to work at a Light level for three hours per day, ramping up to an 8-hour per day as tolerated.â€Â  Further, it noted â€œif allowed to work at the Sedentary level, it may be likely that he will be able to tolerate the 8-hour day.â€Â  \r\nClaimant was seen by George Cogar, Ph.D., for a psychological evaluation on November 20, 2001.Â  Cogar opined that if Claimantâ€™s sleep were improved that his depression and response to pain would improve.Â  He recommended a drug to help Claimant sleep.Â  Cogar saw Claimant several more times and, on April 10, 2002, noted, â€œI would indicate he is at maximum psychological improvement and I will continue to see him prn.â€Â  \r\nOn May 13, 2002, Claimant was seen by Dr. Jeffrey Faaberg of the Crowfield Pain Center.Â  Dr. Faaberg found Claimant to be at MMI.Â  Specifically, regarding Claimantâ€™s cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbar spine, he opined, â€œTotal whole person impairment . . . is therefore 20%.â€Â  Dr. Faaberg also added â€œan additional 5% whole person impairment secondary to significant major depressive findings mentioned by George Cogar Ph.D. in his psychological evaluation.â€\r\nOn March 1, 2002, Dr. Forrest reported that Claimant was at MMI.Â  Dr. Forrest ascribed Claimant a â€œ5% permanent impairment rating for his neck and a 5% permanent impairment rating for the low back.Â  The sum total is therefore a 10% permanent impairment rating for [Claimant].â€Â  Dr. Forrest also found that Claimant â€œcould work a sedentary level beginning at any time and do that on a full time basis.â€Â  On January 20, 2003, Dr. Forrest again stated, â€œ[Claimant] remains at maximum medical improvement as previously defined.â€Â  On August 25, 2003, Dr. Forrest found, â€œthere is no definite weakness in the extremities.â€Â  \r\nOn October 31, 2003, after Claimant complained of increased pain in his neck, upper back, and arms, Dr. Forrest suggested Claimant have a surgical evaluation.Â  In this regard, Dr. Donald Johnson saw Claimant on December 3, 2003 and recommended surgery.Â  On February 24, 2004, Claimant underwent a fusion at C6-7.Â  On June 3, 2004, Dr. Johnson stated, â€œI do think in regards to his cervical spine [Claimant] has reached maximum medical improvement . . . he has sustained a 25% impairment to the whole person.â€Â  The June 3, 2004 report further noted, â€œIf [a CAT scan of Claimantâ€™s lumbar spine] is normal I would place him at maximum medical improvement in regards to his lumbar spine also.â€Â  An August 18, 2004 addendum to the June 3, 2004 report by Dr. Johnson opines that a CT myelogram was conducted on June 14, 2004 and showed â€œsome degenerative changes at 4-5 with minimal stenosis.â€Â  Dr. Johnson then opined, â€œI would continue to place him at maximum medical improvement and feel my note of June 3, 2004 is appropriate.â€Â  \r\nOn November 9, 2004, Claimant testified before the single commissioner that he continues to suffer from numbness in his left arm and hand; pain in his hips, legs, shoulders, neck and low back; headaches; and depression.Â  \r\nThe single commission ordered and an appellate panel of the commission affirmed that the Department pay Claimant â€œpermanent partial disability benefits equal to 35% to the spine at a compensation rate of $267.18.â€Â  The commission further found that â€œClaimantâ€™s injury is confined to his spine and no other body parts are compensable.â€Â  \r\nThe circuit court affirmed the commissionâ€™s order to the extent it found Claimant â€œsustained a 35% permanent partial disability to his neck.â€Â  The circuit court reversed, however, â€œto the extent that it found no other compensable injury[.]â€Â  The circuit court found the commissionâ€™s ruling of no other compensable injuries was not supported by the substantial evidence, and specifically noted the undisputed evidence that Claimant sustained permanent injuries to his low back.Â  Further, the circuit court determined the commission erred by: (1) considering only the medical evidence relating to Claimantâ€™s neck injuries; (2) finding that Claimantâ€™s injuries were confined to his spine; and (3) disregarding the significant permanent restrictions imposed by Dr. Forrest.Â  \r\nII.\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  â€œIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.â€Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  This court reviews facts based on the substantial evidence standard.Â  Thompson v. S.C. Steel Erectors, 369 S.C. 606, 612, 632 S.E.2d 874, 877 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Under the substantial evidence standard, the appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2006).Â  The appellate court may reverse or modify the Commissionâ€™s decision only if the Claimantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Id.Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\n  III.\r\nThe Department argues the circuit court incorrectly found that (1) the commissionâ€™s award only applied to Claimantâ€™s cervical spine and (2) that the commission only considered the medical evidence relating to Claimantâ€™s neck injuries.Â  We agree.\r\nIn its order, the commission specifically stated, â€œthe Claimant suffered an admitted injury to his neck and back . . . .â€Â  The commission also noted Claimantâ€™s testimony of â€œshooting pain in his neck and back.â€Â  Moreover, the commission specifically awarded Claimant â€œpermanent partial disability benefits equal to 35% to the spine . . . .â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  The commission did not differentiate between Claimantâ€™s neck and lower back.Â  The award for Claimantâ€™s spine injury contemplates both his neck and lower backâ€”contrary to the circuit courtâ€™s finding. \r\nThe commission referred to both Dr. Johnsonâ€™s June 3, 2004 and August 18, 2004 reports, which were written after Claimantâ€™s surgery.Â  As noted by the commission, on June 3 Dr. Johnson found Claimant to be at maximum medical improvement with a 25% whole person impairment rating.Â  The commission also stated that on August 18, Dr. Johnson found some degenerative changes but continued to opine Claimant was at MMI.Â  The August 18 report, which the commission clearly referred to in its order, states Claimant reached MMI and refers back to Dr. Johnsonâ€™s June 3 report.Â  These reports, when read together, provide substantial evidence supporting the commissionâ€™s finding.\r\nIV.\r\nThe circuit court found the commission erred by failing to make any reference to the permanent work restrictions recommended for Claimant by Dr. Forrest in a questionnaire for Claimantâ€™s Social Security hearing.Â  The Department argues the circuit court erred in making this finding.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe questionnaire and restrictions referred to by the circuit court were made by Dr. Forrest on December 18, 2003.Â  Dr. Johnsonâ€™s finding of MMI was made several months later on June 3, 2004 and after Claimantâ€™s surgery on February 24, 2004.Â  Therefore, the evidence supports the commissionâ€™s findings.Â  The circuit court reweighed the evidence to come to a different findingâ€”an action not permitted by the standard of review.Â  \r\nV.\r\nThe circuit court found the commission erred in finding Claimantâ€™s injuries were confined to his spine and that no other injuries were compensable.Â  The Department argues the circuit court made findings outside the scope of review.Â  We agree.\r\nThe single commissionerâ€™s order shows that the commission reviewed the medical evidence and found that Claimantâ€™s only compensable injury was to his spine.Â  The order states that â€œ[t]he medical evidence supports a C5 injury with some radicular symptoms in the arm which comes from the neck injury.Â  Medical evidence does not demonstrate other injuries to the arms or legs.â€Â  \r\nAlthough Claimant consistently reported pain and numbness in his upper and lower extremities, no doctor found these areas to be injured.Â  In fact, on August 25, 2003, Dr. Forrest found â€œno definite weakness in the [Claimantâ€™s] extremities.â€Â  As we read the medical evidence, the pain and numbness in Claimantâ€™s extremities is a symptom of his spinal injury.Â  In any event, the record substantially supports the commissionâ€™s finding.Â  The circuit court erred in conducting its own review of the evidence and concluding otherwise.Â  \r\n\r\n  VI.\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we reverse the circuit court.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-227","title":"State v.

Smith, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAjerenal Danley, Matthew C. Robertson and Cynthia Burns Polk, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This is a workersâ€™ compensation case.Â  The claimant, Ericka L. Jones, alleged she suffered a mental-mental injury arising out of and in the course of her employment as a caseworker for the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS).Â  The single commissioner denied the claim, finding the greater weight of the evidence did not support a finding that Jonesâ€™s emotional condition arose out of and in the course of her employment.Â  The appellate panel and circuit court affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  Jones appeals to this court. Â We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nJones was hired by DSS on July 31, 2000, as a Human Service Specialist II, commonly referred to as a caseworker.Â  Before working at DSS, Jones suffered from a neuromuscular disorder that caused physical problems; however, there is no evidence that she experienced any prior mental health or substance abuse problems or had received any mental health treatment.\r\n \r\nOne of the cases in which Jones was involved concerned a teenage girl who had been placed in foster care.Â  In September 2001, Jones initiated a pickup order for the girl after she ran away from her foster home.Â  Several months later, Jones met with the police, intending to give them information to help them locate the girl.Â  Instead, she learned the police had known of the girlâ€™s whereabouts but had ignored the pick up order because they were investigating the murder of a drug dealer with whom the girl was allegedly involved.Â  Sadly, Jones also learned during the meeting that the girl had been found murdered on the railroad tracks in Lincolnville.\r\nJones maintains her mental problems began after she learned of the girlâ€™s murder.Â  She initially attempted to deal with her anguish by discussing it with her mother and grandmother.Â  In July 2002, she began discussing the stress of her job with her family physician.\r\nShortly thereafter, Jones was assigned to work on a case involving a woman whose child was in the custody of DSS.Â  In August 2002, DSS received a fax stating the woman had made death threats against Jones and Jonesâ€™s mother.Â  Jones was frightened by the threat, prompting the DSS Office of Investigations to issue instructions that Jones was not to have any further contact with the woman.Â  Jones discussed this incident with her mother, her neurologist, and her family physician.\r\nOn December 9, 2002, Jones suffered a sudden and complete mental breakdown after being required to testify in court on some of her supervisorâ€™s cases.Â  Notwithstanding the prior instructions that Jones was to avoid contact with the woman who had threatened her, the particular case involving that individual was included among the matters on which Jones was to appear.Â  Although the woman had not been served and the case was eventually continued for that reason, a DSS paralegal acknowledged that Jones was not made aware of the defect in service and that service or lack of it is usually not ascertained until the call of the corresponding case.Â  In addition, the DSS attorney was dissatisfied with the court treatment plan that was prepared by the supervisor on another case and became argumentative with Jones during her testimony.Â  This in turn, made Jones angry, defensive, and disgusted.Â  Further complicating matters, Jonesâ€™s pager went off in court alerting her to emergencies in two of her other cases.\r\n \r\nAs Jones was leaving the courtroom after the hearing, she began feeling weak, losing her vision, and dropping her files on the floor.Â  The following morning, her family took her to the emergency room at St. Francis Hospital.Â  On December 1, 2003, DSS terminated Jonesâ€™s employment in accordance with its attendance and leave policy.Â  Jones remains unable to work and under active psychiatric and psychological care.\r\nOn June 7, 2004, Jones applied for workersâ€™ compensation benefits, alleging she sustained a mental-mental injury arising out of and in the course of her employment with DSS.Â  The State Accident Fund denied Jones sustained a compensable injury by accident.\r\nThe matter came before the single commissioner for a hearing on August 13, 2004.Â  By order dated December 3, 2004, the single commissioner found Jones failed to prove she â€œwas operating under unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment at any time during the course of her employment with the [DSS].â€Â  The single commissioner also stated â€œthe greater weight of the evidence does not support a finding that the claimantâ€™s emotional condition arises out of and in the course of her employment with [DSS].â€\r\nAfter a hearing on April 26, 2005, the appellate panel issued a summary order dated May 16, 2005, upholding and adopting the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  The circuit court heard Jonesâ€™s petition for judicial review on June 8, 2005, and, in a form order filed May 15, 2006, denied the appeal.[1]Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAlthough an appellate court â€œmay not substitute [its] judgment for that of the full commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact,â€ it â€œmay reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.â€[2]Â  â€œWhile the appellate courts are required to be deferential to the full commission regarding questions of fact, this deference does not prevent the courts from overturning the full commissionâ€™s decision when it is legally incorrect.â€[3]\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWe agree with Jonesâ€™s argument that the commission committed an error of law in failing â€œto consider the combined or cumulative effect of the series of unusual and extraordinary untoward events that led up to [her] mental breakdown.â€Â  In our view, Jones is entitled to a finding by the commission as to whether or not the combination of factors that she cited constituted an unusual or extraordinary condition of her employment, even though each of these factors, when considered individually, would arguably be an accepted hazard in her particular job.\r\nA claimant can recover workers compensation benefits for mental or nervous disorders resulting from â€œ â€˜emotional stimuli or stressors . . . incident to or aris[ing] from unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment.â€™ â€[4]Â  Notably, in Shealy v. Aiken County, the supreme court held various circumstances of the claimantâ€™s work as a deep-cover narcotics agent, when combined over several months, could be unusual or extraordinary conditions notwithstanding that they may all be typical of the claimantâ€™s employment.[5] \r\n \r\nIn the present case, the record shows the issue of whether various stressors in Jonesâ€™s job, when considered together, caused her mental-mental injury was presented to both the single commissioner and the circuit court.Â  The single commissionerâ€™s order, however, which is the only order in the record giving more than a summary treatment to the case, failed to address this issue and instead focused on whether each of the various events leading up to Jonesâ€™s injury was in itself unusual or extraordinary or could have been a proximate cause of her breakdown.[6]Â  That is to say, despite the assertions by Jonesâ€™s attorney at the hearings before both the single commissioner and the circuit court, no findings of fact were made regarding whether the combination of the events cited in this case, all of which took place within less than a year of each other, constituted an unusual or extraordinary condition of employment proximately causing Jonesâ€™s present condition.Â  \r\n \r\nBased on the foregoing, we remand this matter to the commission for a determination of (1) whether the combination of the circumstances alleged to have caused Jonesâ€™s condition constituted an unusual or extraordinary condition of her employment; and (2) if so, whether the combination of these factors proximately caused her mental-mental injury.[7]Â  In making these determinations, the commission shall confine its review to the present record.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  On May 22, 2006, Jones moved under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, for reconsideration and a â€œwritten order.â€Â  This motion was denied, and judgment in the case was entered on June 20, 2006.\r\n[2]Â  Grant v. Grant Textiles, 372 S.C. 196, ___, 641 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2007).\r\n[3]Â  Id.Â  at 66.Â  Although the fact that the full commission issued only a summary order was not made an issue in the present appeal, we note that in Grant, the supreme court, citing section 1-23-350 of the South Carolina Code (2005) went on to â€œreverse the full commission for its issuance of a conclusory order.â€Â  Id. at ___, 641 S.E.2d at 872.\r\n[4]Â  Powell v. Vulcan Materials Co., 299 S.C. 325, 327, 384 S.E.2d 725, 726 (1989) (quoting Stokes v. First Natâ€™l Bank, 298 S.C. 13, 22, 377 S.E.2d 922, 927 (Ct. App. 1988)); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (1976) (providing workers compensation coverage for â€œ[s]tress . . . unaccompanied by physical injury and resulting in mental illness or injuryâ€ only if â€œit is established that the stressful employment conditions causing the mental injury were extraordinary and unusual in comparison to the normal conditions of employmentâ€).\r\n[5]Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 459, 535 S.E.2d 438, 444 (2000). Â \r\n[6]Â  Moreover, the single commissionerâ€™s order, in evaluating the impact of several of the events on Jonesâ€™s emotional stability, appears to have ignored undisputed evidence that was proffered to explain why a particular occurrence was particularly stressful to her.Â  For example, although the single commissioner also found â€œthe greater weight of the credible evidence shows that the claimant was not chastised by the court on December 9, 2002,â€ he did not call into question the evidence she presented that the DSS attorney became argumentative with her while she was testifying.Â  In fact, the single commissioner acknowledged that â€œcaseworkers are sometimes chastised by the attorney in the usual course of their employment.â€Â  Similarly, the single commissioner, while appearing to find it significant that Jones was not the case manager responsible for the foster child who was later found murdered and had only limited contact with the girl, nevertheless acknowledged that it was Jones who initiated the pickup order that the police ignored.Â  Finally, although the single commissioner may have been technically correct that Jones â€œhad sufficient informationâ€ that the woman who had threatened her â€œmost probably would not be in courtâ€ when Jones was scheduled to testify, it appears undisputed that Jones could not have been completely certain that she would not have to confront the woman until the call of the case.\r\n[7]Â  See Sigmon v. Dayco Corp., 316 S.C. 260, 262-63, 449 S.E.2d 497, 498-99 (Ct.

Babb, of Calabash, pro se, Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn L. Weaver, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The circuit court dismissed Brenda Babbâ€™s appeal of a magistrateâ€™s court conviction for failure to register a vehicle.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 11, 2004, Babb was convicted in magistrateâ€™s court of failure to register a vehicle. Â On February 18, 2004, Babb filed a notice of appeal with the circuit court.Â  On February 24, 2004, Babb filed a motion for new trial with the magistrate.[2]Â  The motion included no accompanying statement of service on Horry County.Â  The notice of appeal included a certificate of service indicating it was served on the county.Â  The county denies receipt, averring it first received notice via facsimile on March 16, 2004. Â \r\nThe county then faxed a copy of the notice of appeal to the magistrate.Â  Babb never served the notice of appeal on the magistrate.Â  In a return filed March 30, 2004, the magistrate first addresses the motion, denying it as untimely served.Â  \r\n \r\nThe circuit court dismissed the appeal due to Babbâ€™s failure to timely serve the notice of appeal on the magistrate. Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBabb argues the circuit court erred in dismissing her appeal for untimely service on the magistrate because she filed a motion for new trial with the magistrate, staying the time to serve her notice of appeal.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn appeal from a magistrate court conviction must be served on the magistrate within ten days of sentence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-30 (1985).Â  The circuit court cannot relieve one convicted before a magistrate who has failed to timely serve the magistrate.Â  Gibbes v. Beckett, 84 S.C. 534, 536, 66 S.E. 1000, 1001 (1910).Â  Babb never served the notice of appeal on the magistrate and the county did not provide the magistrate with a copy until March 16, 2004, at the earliest.Â  \r\n \r\nBabb argues, however, her motion for new trial stayed the time to serve the notice of appeal.Â  We disagree.Â  Babb relies on Rule 29(a), SCRCrimP, which provides in relevant part: â€œpost trial motions shall be made within ten (10) days after the imposition of the sentence.Â  In cases involving appeals from convictions in magistrateâ€™s or municipal court, post trial motions shall be made within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment disposing of the appeal.â€Â  Rule 29(a), SCRCrimP.Â  However, section 22-3-1000 of the South Carolina Code governs the issue in this case.Â  Section 22-3-1000 requires a post-trial motion for new trial, following a conviction in magistrateâ€™s court, to be made within five days of judgment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-1000 (2007).Â  We find support for this proposition from our supreme courtâ€™s holding in State v. Sullivan, 310 S.C. 311, 426 S.E.2d 766 (1993).Â  In Sullivan, the court reiterated the general tenet of applying a specific rule over a general rule.Â  Id. at 314, 426 S.E.2d at 768. Â In Sullivan, the general rule considered was section 18-3-30, which governed appeals in general.Â  The court held because section 22-3-1000 dealt specifically with motions for new trial, rather than appeals in general, section 22-3-1000 prevailed.Â  Id.Â  Because Babbâ€™s motion for new trial was not served on the magistrate until February 19 at the earliest, more than five days after judgment, it was not timely served.Â  Only a timely served motion for a new trial extends the time for filing a notice of appeal. Â See generally Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 15, 602 S.E.2d 772, 775 (2004) (discussing effects of post-trial motions).\r\nFinally, Babb argues the circuit court erred in rejecting her contention that because we have a unified judicial system, the filing of the notice of appeal with the circuit court equates to service on the magistrate.Â  We disagree.Â  Our judicial system is defined as a unified judicial system.Â  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 1.Â  The magistrate courts are included in this system.Â  State ex rel. McLeod v. Crowe, 272 S.C. 41, 46, 249 S.E.2d 772, 775 (1978).Â  However, section 18-3-30 specifically addresses the burden upon an appellant to perfect an appeal from magistrate court providing:Â  â€œ[t]he appellant shall . . . serve notice of appeal upon the magistrate . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-30 (1985).Â  The unification of our court system does not relieve an appellant of the statutory mandate.Â  We find no error.Â  \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Babb argues she filed the motion for new trial on February 19, 2004.Â  For purposes of this appeal, either filing date results in the same disposition. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-245","title":"Evans v.

Benjamin Aplin, and Legal Counsel Tommy Evans, Jr., all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Maxie Doyal Evans, III, appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order refusing to set aside his parole revocation warrant.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nEvans was convicted of safecracking, burglary in the second degree, possession of tools of a crime, and grand larceny.Â  He was paroled on January&nbsp;4, 2000. Â The South Carolina Parole Board permitted Evansâ€™ parole to be transferred to Georgia pursuant to the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision (S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 24-21-1100 - 1220) (Rev. 2007). Â While in Georgia, Evans was arrested for possession of a firearm by a felon.Â  He was convicted of the charge and incarcerated in federal prison in Georgia.Â  The South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services (the Department) issued a warrant for Evansâ€™ arrest for various parole violations, including his weapons conviction. Â However, the warrant was not executed. Â Instead, a detainer was filed against Evans pursuant to which the federal prison system agreed to detain Evans upon his release so he could be taken into custody by the Department.Â  Evans was apprised of the existence of the warrant, and he signed an agreement waiving his preliminary hearing on the parole violation charges. Â \r\nAfterward, Evans began filing complaints with the prison insisting he could not be detained for parole violations by South Carolina authorities after his release from federal prison. Â He believed the agreement he signed was actually a revocation of his parole in South Carolina, as a result of which he was serving his parole revocation concurrently with his federal sentence.Â  Because the warrant and his parole revocation were still outstanding, Evans was not eligible to participate in some federal pre-release programs. Â \r\nEvans filed a motion with the Richland County circuit court to â€œVacate and Set Asideâ€ his parole violation warrant. Â The circuit court dismissed Evansâ€™ motion, finding the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the parole violation warrant and that jurisdiction to determine whether parole has been violated and should be revoked lies with the Department.Â  The court also held that Evans had not been deprived of any constitutional rights. Â Evans then filed a â€œComplaintâ€ against the Department in Richland County circuit court claiming the agency had breached contractual duties owed to him. Â The circuit court construed Evansâ€™ complaint as a motion to reconsider, which it denied. Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s final order was filed May 25, 2006.Â  The Department argues that Evans filed his notice of appeal on July 27, 2006, which would fall outside the 30 day limitation provided for in South Carolina Appellate Court Rule 203(b).Â  If so, this court is without jurisdiction to hear Evansâ€™ complaint. Â Elam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 14-15, 602 S.E.2d 772, 775 (2004) (â€œThe requirement of service of the notice of appeal is jurisdictional, i.e., if a party misses the deadline, the appellate court lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal . . . .â€).Â  Evans contends he received the courtâ€™s order on June 1, 2006 and mailed his notice of appeal to the Department and the court by certified mail on June 29 and 30, respectively.Â  The documents in Evansâ€™ appellate file support his contention and demonstrate that he did everything possible to timely file his notice of appeal.Â  Consequently, we elect to address his claims on the merits.\r\nEvans raises numerous issues in his pro se appeal that in sum and substance amount to two arguments. Â First, he contends that the parole agreement is a contract, and the Department violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicit therein when it did not â€œacceptâ€ his waiver, causing his probation revocation to run concurrent with his federal sentence.Â  He next argues he has been denied procedural due process because his parole violation warrant was not immediately executed and a revocation hearing conducted.\r\n \r\nFirst, there is no contractual relationship between the Department and Evans based upon his parole agreement.Â  The extension of parole to an inmate is gratuitous.Â  See State v. De La Cruz, 302 S.C. 13, 16, 393 S.E.2d 184, 186 (1990) (â€œ[T]he ability to obtain parole is a matter of legislative grace.â€).Â  While the offer of parole will no doubt be accepted by most prisoners, there is simply no consideration exchanged between the parties.Â  See Armstrong v. Collins, 366 S.C. 204, 222, 621 S.E.2d 368, 377 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œThe required elements of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and valuable consideration.â€).Â  Because there is no contract formed under such circumstances, the Department could not breach any contractually based duties that Evans contends arose in his favor.\r\nFurthermore, a plain reading of the â€œWaiver of Preliminary Hearingâ€[2] signed by Evans indicates Evans admitted to a violation of his parole and waived his right to a preliminary hearing. Â Such a hearing is held to determine if there is probable cause to believe that the parolee has committed acts that would constitute a violation of parole conditions.Â  See Russell v. Cooper, 263 S.C. 526, 530, 211 S.E.2d 655, 657 (1975).Â  This preliminary hearing is not a final determination and does not result in a decision regarding parole revocation.Â  See Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 484-89 (1972) (discussing the â€œtwo important stagesâ€ of parole revocation: Â â€œ(a) Arrest of Parolee and Preliminary Hearingâ€ and â€œ(b) the Revocation Hearingâ€).Â  The waiver does not intimate that Evans forfeited his parole thereby causing the revocation to be served simultaneously with his federal sentence.Â  It simply indicates Evans waived his right to the initial preliminary hearing.Â  To construe the waiver as more is overreaching.\r\nFinally, the United States Supreme Court has made clear that an inmateâ€™s due process rights are not violated under these conditions.Â  In Moody v. Daggett, 429 U.S. 78 (1976), Moody was on parole for a 1962 federal rape charge.Â  Id. at 80. Â He was then convicted for murder.Â  Id.Â  The parole board prepared a parole violation warrant that it did not execute, instead placing a detainer on Moody.Â  Id. at 80-81.Â  The court concluded:Â  â€œThe issue before us here, . . . , is not whether a Morrissey-type[3] hearing will ever be constitutionally required in the present case, but whether a hearing must be held at the present time, before the parolee is taken into custody as a parole violator.Â  We hold that there is no requirement for an immediate hearing.â€Â  Moody, 429 U.S. at 86.Â  Likewise, there is no requirement that Evans receive an immediate hearing or that his parole revocation run concurrently with his federal sentence.Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]  The documentâ€™s full title is â€œOS Waiver of Preliminary Hearing (Form4-7) on Parole or Conditional Release Revocation and Agreement to Return.â€\r\n[3]  Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 488-89, established the minimum requirements for due process with respect to parole revocation:Â  (a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole; (b) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation); (e) a neutral and detached hearing body such as a traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or lawyers; and (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-246","title":"Blue v.

Ingle, the president of University, sent a letter to Blue stating: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tUpon the recommendation of Dr. Linda Hollandsworth, Director of Advisement and Retention, I am pleased to offer you the position of Assistant Director of First Year Programs and Academic Advising (Student Services Program Coordinator II) at Coastal Carolina University. Â The salary for this position will be $32,500 on a twelve-month basis and the appointment will begin on August 2, 2004.Â  This classified position is subject to state regulations and the University policies as outlined in the Policies and Procedures Manual.\r\n\tWe feel most fortunate in having an individual with your background and talent joining us at Coastal Carolina University.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBlue accepted the offer of employment and reported for work on August 2, 2004.Â  On November 5, 2004, Dr. Linda Hollingsworth notified Blue by letter that her employment â€œwill terminate during [the] probationary period, effective December 31, 2004.â€Â  \r\n \r\nAsseverating the June 10, 2004 letter established a contract between University and Blue, Blue brought this action alleging a breach of employment contract and seeking the payment of wages called for under the terms of the agreement.Â  It is undisputed that Blue was paid for her employment, including accrued vacation days, through December 31, 2004 and that she performed no services for University following December 31, 2004.Â  University filed a motion for summary judgment.Â  The trial judge granted Universityâ€™s motion for summary judgment holding the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used in the letter did not create a contract of employment for a specified term.[2]Â  The court also found Blue was paid all wages due and granted summary judgment on the issue of wages.Â  This appeal follows. \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005).Â  Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP;Â  Helms Realty, Inc., 363 S.C. at 340, 611 S.E.2d at 488.Â  To determine whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006).Â  When plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBlue argues the trial court erred in failing to find the June 10, 2004 letter created a contract of employment for a term of one year.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina has long recognized the doctrine of employment at-will.Â  Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 471, 611 S.E.2d 905, 910-11 (2005).Â  This doctrine provides that a contract for permanent employment is terminable at the pleasure of either party when unsupported by any consideration other than the employerâ€™s duty to provide compensation in exchange for the employeeâ€™s duty to perform a service or obligation.Â  See Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Coop., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 334, 516 S.E.2d 923, 925 (1999).Â  This doctrine allows either party to terminate the employment â€œfor any reason or no reasonâ€ without being subject to a claim for breach of contract.Â  Horton v. Darby Elec. Co., Inc., 360 S.C. 58, 67, 599 S.E.2d 456, 460 (2004);Â  Burns v. Universal Health Servs, Inc., 361 S.C 221, 233, 603 S.E.2d 605, 611 (Ct. App. 2004).Â \r\n \r\nAn employer and employee may contractually alter an at-will employment relationship, and as a result limit the ability of either party to terminate the employment relationship without incurring liability.Â  Id. at 233-34, 603 S.E.2 at 612 (citations omitted).Â  In order to prove the existence of a definite contract of employment, the employee must establish all of the elements of a contract.Â  Prescott, 335 S.C. at 336, 516 S.E.2d at 926.Â  An employment contract must contain the following three elements: 1) a specific offer; 2) communication of that offer to the employee; and 3) performance of job duties in reliance on the offer.Â  Id.\r\nBlue claims the language in the letter, â€œthe salary for this position will be $32,500 on a twelve-month basis and the appointment will begin on August 2, 2004,â€ constituted a specific offer of employment for a twelve-month term at the specified salary.Â  In the alternative, Blue claims the letter creates an ambiguity as to whether University made a specific offer of employment for a twelve-month term, thereby making summary judgment improper.Â  To be binding, an offer of employment must be definite and â€œbe one which is intended of itself to create legal relations on acceptance.â€Â  Id. at 336-37, 516 S.E.2d at 926 (citation omitted).Â  We find Blue has failed to establish Universityâ€™s June 10, 2004 letter was a definite offer of employment such as to alter her at-will employment status.Â  The plain and ordinary meaning of the language used in the letter did not create a term of employment for twelve months; but, rather indicated the salary for the position and the start date of employment.[3]Â   \r\nBlue further argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on her claim for damages under the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act.Â  We disagree.\r\nBlue contends Universityâ€™s withholding of wages due to her pursuant to the terms of her employment contract violates the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act and seeks damages under the Act.Â  The Payment of Wages Act is remedial legislation designed to protect working people and assist them in collecting compensation wrongfully withheld.Â  Abraham v. Palmetto Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1, 343 S.C. 36, 50, 538 S.E.2d 656, 664 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Because we have already determined Blue was an at-will employee, subject to termination at the pleasure of University, and there is no dispute as to whether Blue is owed wages for her services prior to termination, the trial court properly granted summary judgment on this issue.\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In addition to the plain language used in the letter, the court found a specific reference in the letter, â€œ[t]his classified position is subject to state regulations and the University policies as outlined in the Policies and Procedures Manual,â€ further indicated University did not intend to create a contract of employment for a specified term.Â  State law, regulations, and University policies all provide that a newly hired classified employee must complete a probationary period of twelve monthsâ€™ duration for non-instructional personnel.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-17-310, et. seq., S.C. Code Regs. 19-700 et. seq., Coastal Carolina University Policies and Procedures Manual Sections 1246 et. seq., 1246.02(B), 1227 et seq., 1227.0601, 1247 et. seq., 1247.01(A).Â  Additionally, the state law, regulations, and University policies all provide that an employee that performs unsatisfactorily during the probationary period must be terminated before becoming a covered employee and may not avail herself to any grievance procedures.Â  Id.\r\n[3] Â Both University and the trial court find further reliance for the at-will status of Blue in the letterâ€™s reference to Universityâ€™s Policies and Procedures Manual.Â  Because we find the letter is clear and unambiguous we need not look to the Policies and Procedures Manual for further reliance.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-247","title":"State v.

Ernest Kinard, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2007-UP-249\r\nSubmitted May 1, 2007 â€“ Filed May 22, 2007\r\nAndrew F. Lindemann, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nBarry B. George, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Dixie Lawn Services, Inc. (Dixie) appeals the juryâ€™s verdict finding Dixie vicariously liable for injuries Jason Tedder (Tedder) suffered in a motor vehicle accident.Â  Specifically, Dixie argues the driver, John Fowler, a Dixie employee, was acting outside the scope of his employment at the time of the accident; Tedderâ€™s attorney made inappropriate remarks during closing argument; the trial court erred in admitting medical expenses without evidence of a connection with the accident; and a new trial was warranted because the damages award was excessive.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 14, 2001, Tedder and a co-worker were returning to work in a pick-up truck when they were rear-ended by Fowler at approximately one oâ€™clock in the afternoon.Â  Tedderâ€™s head allegedly struck the rear windshield of the truck he occupied.Â \r\n \r\nAt the time of the accident, Fowler was driving a vehicle owned by Dixie, a business that provided lawn and landscaping services.Â  Fowler was an employee of Dixie and a permissive user of the vehicle.Â  According to Tedder, immediately following the accident Fowler stated he was on his way to work and regretted the accident.Â  On cross-examination, Tedder read a statement from his deposition, quoting Fowler saying, â€œOh, man, Iâ€™m sorry, I was adjusting my radio, I didnâ€™t even see you.â€Â  During the deposition, Tedder did not remember any other statements made by Fowler following the wreck.Â \r\n \r\nTedder brought suit against Dixie.Â  The jury heard testimony from Tedderâ€™s chiropractor, Tedder, and a medical records custodian.Â  Following Tedderâ€™s presentation of evidence, Dixie moved for a directed verdict on the ground Tedder failed to prove Fowler was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident.Â  The trial court relied on three facts when denying the motion: the accident occurred in the middle of the day; Fowler was driving Dixieâ€™s vehicle; and Tedderâ€™s testimony that Fowler said he was on his way to work.Â  The trial court determined it was a jury issue whether Fowler was within the scope of his employment.Â  The jury returned a verdict for Tedder in the amount of $54,927.15.Â \r\n \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Scope of Employment\r\nDixie argues the trial court erred by not directing a verdict or issuing a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because Tedder failed to prove Fowler was within the scope of employment at the time of the accident.Â  We disagree.\r\n \r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, this Court must employ the same standard as the trial court by viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 299-00, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000) (citing Steinke v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999); Gastineau v. Murphy, 331 S.C. 565, 503 S.E.2d 712 (1998)).Â  The trial court must deny the motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict when the evidence yields more than one inference.Â  Welch, 342 S.C. at 300, 536 S.E.2d at 418 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nGenerally, a master is liable for his servantâ€™s torts when the servant is acting within the scope of employment.Â  See Bolin v. Bostics, 235 S.C. 319, 322, 111 S.E.2d 557, 558 (1959).Â  A servant acts within the scope of employment if the action is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of his employment and the action furthers the masterâ€™s business.Â  Id. (quoting Adams v. S.C. Power Co., 200 S.C. 438, 441, 21 S.E.2d 17, 19 (1942)).\r\nBolin illustrates the general rule that an employee driving to and from work is usually acting solely for the employeeâ€™s benefit.Â  235 S.C. at 323, 111 S.E.2d at 559.Â  In Bolin, a salesman was driving his own car to his place of business in order to report at the required time.Â  Id. at 321-22, 111 S.E.2d at 558.Â  The court found that the salesmanâ€™s actions did not bring him under special exceptions to the general rule that driving to and from work is outside the scope of employment.Â  Id. at 324, 111 S.E.2d at 559.Â  \r\n \r\nConversely, in Hamilton v. Miller, 301 S.C. 45, 47-48, 389 S.E.2d 652, 53-54 (1990), an employeeâ€™s action was found within the scope of Â employment when the employee drove her supervisorâ€™s vehicle to pick up her supervisorâ€™s son from the dentist.Â  Although the employer was an insurance agency, the employer allowed the employee to run errands for her supervisor.Â  Id. at 47, 389 S.E.2d at 653.Â  In determining that the employee was acting within the scope of her employment, the court was persuaded by evidence that the employee was driving the supervisorâ€™s vehicle, the accident occurred at approximately five oâ€™clock in the afternoon during regular office hours, and the employee was being paid her hourly wage at the time of the accident.Â  Id. at 48, 389 S.E.2d at 654.\r\nIn this case the accident occurred at approximately one oâ€™clock in the afternoon during regular business hours in the landscaping business.Â  Fowler was driving a vehicle owned by Dixie, was a Dixie employee, and was a permissive user of the vehicle.Â  Tedder testified that, following the accident, Fowler approached him and said, â€œIâ€™m sorry.Â  I was on my way to work and I was adjusting my radio and I never saw you.â€Â  Tedder testified Fowler stated he had not been at work for a few weeks and Dixie would be mad that he wrecked the truck.Â  \r\n \r\nGiven our limited scope of review and the specific facts of this case, the issue of whether Fowler was within the scope of employment was properly submitted to the jury and the juryâ€™s verdict should not be disturbed.Â  Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying Dixieâ€™s motion for a directed verdict and motion for a judgment not withstanding the verdict based on scope of employment.\r\nII. Closing Arguments\r\nDixie argues Tedderâ€™s closing argument deprived Dixie of a fair trial and a new trial is warranted.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA trial court is allowed broad discretion in dealing with the range and propriety of closing argument to the jury.â€ Â Oâ€™Leary-Payne v. R.R. Hilton Head, II, Inc.,&nbsp;371 S.C. 340, 352, 638 S.E.2d 96, 102&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (petition for certiorari pending) (citing State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 195-96, 562 S.E.2d 320, 325 (Ct. App. 2002)). Â The trial courtâ€™s rulings regarding content of a closing argument will not ordinarily be disturbed. Â Oâ€™Leary-Payne, 371 S.C. at 352, 638 S.E.2d at 102 (citing State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 17, 482 S.E.2d 760, 766 (1997)); State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 324, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 (1996) (â€œThe trial courtâ€™s discretion will not be overturned absent a showing of an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law that prejudices the defendant.â€). \r\n \r\nDuring Tedderâ€™s closing argument, trial counsel addressed the issue of whether Fowler was, at the time of the accident, actively working for and furthering the interest of Dixie.Â  Throughout closing argument, Tedderâ€™s attorney indicated Dixie could have provided evidence regarding Fowlerâ€™s employment.Â  Dixieâ€™s attorney contemporaneously objected that Tedderâ€™s attorney was shifting the burden of proof.Â  The trial court responded: â€œThey [Dixie] donâ€™t have the burden of proof.Â  He [Tedder] does.Â  But he [Tedder] can argue conjecture, and so forth, and circumstantial evidence.â€Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nAfter further objection from Dixie, the trial court again instructed the jury that Dixie did not have the burden of proof and informed Tedderâ€™s attorney the court would require him to sit down if he again referenced what Dixie did or did not do.Â  Following another comment, Dixieâ€™s attorney objected again, and the trial court instructed Tedderâ€™s attorney to sit down.Â  Following closing arguments, the trial court repeatedly instructed the jury that Tedder, as the plaintiff, had the burden of proof.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tThe trial court properly used discretion to cure any possible confusion concerning the burden of proof.Â  Thus, the denial of Dixieâ€™s motion for a new trial was not an abuse of discretion. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nIII. Admission of Medical Bills\r\nDixie argues the trial court erred in admitting evidence of medical bills incurred by Tedder, when Tedderâ€™s testimony regarding the bills was the only evidence linking the bills and the accident.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error prejudicing the defendant.Â  Wright v. Craft, 371, S.C. 1, ___, 640 S.E.2d 486, 503&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (citing State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 77, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000)). Â â€œIf the facts and circumstances proved give rise to a reasonable inference of a causal connection between a plaintiffâ€™s present condition and the earlier accident, the absence of medical testimony need not be conclusive.â€Â  Howle v. PYA/Monarch, Inc.,&nbsp;288 S.C. 586, 596, 344 S.E.2d 157, 162&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986) (citing Gambrell v. Burleson, 252 S.C. 98, 165 S.E.2d 622 (1969); Grice v. Dickerson, Inc., 241 S.C. 225, 127 S.E.2d 722 (1962)).Â  \r\n \r\nIn Howle, the Plaintiff testified prior to the accident she did not have vision problems and following the accident she did have vision problems.Â  288 S.C. at 597, 344 S.E.2d at 162.Â  As to emotional problems, the Plaintiff testified she was never hospitalized for emotional problems prior to the accident, while doctors testified she was upset and depressed following the accident.Â  Id. at 597, 344 S.E.2d at 163.Â  We held that, although the Plaintiff might have presented additional testimony to establish the casual connection between the accident and her visual and emotional problems, a common sense connection that was more than â€œmere temporal sequenceâ€ existed to support her claim.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\nIn this case, a chiropractor testified Tedder would not have problems with his neck if the accident had not occurred.Â  During a description of the accident, Tedder asserted that his head was thrown into the truckâ€™s rear windshield.Â  He distinguished prior injuries as unrelated to his current neck pain.Â  Tedder stated he would not have incurred the medical expenses if the accident had not occurred. \r\n \r\nDixie objected to admission of the medical bills for lack of foundation, and the trial court made the following explanatory statement to the jury:\r\n\r\n\tThe fact that a medical bill is presented certainly indicates that the bill was incurred.Â  Okay, the Plaintiff [Tedder] has the burden of showing that it was incurred as a direct result of the particular accident.Â  Thatâ€™s all.Â \r\n\t\r\n\tIt would be better to have somebody from the medical center to say that was the bill, but, you know, it is in.Â  Yâ€™all have heard the facts.Â  You will decide whether this bill and the other bills that are going to come in arose out of this accident or not.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nEvidence points to more than a mere temporal sequence connecting the medical bills with the accident.Â  Certainly, testimony from a physician linking the bills and the accident would have strengthened Tedderâ€™s case, but this failure does not prevent the medical bills from being properly admitted into evidence.Â  Thus, based on the reasonable inference of their nexus to the accident, the trial court did not err in admitting the medical bills.\r\nIV. New Trial \r\nDixie argues the trial court erred in failing to grant a new trial absolute or a new trial nisi due to the alleged excessiveness of the verdict.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA new trial absolute should be granted only if the verdict is so grossly excessive that it shocks the conscience of the court and clearly indicates the amount of the verdict was the â€˜result of caprice, passion, prejudice, partiality, corruption, or other improper motives.â€™ â€ Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, __, 640 S.E.2d 486, 505&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Smalls v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Educ., 339 S.C. 208, 215, 528 S.E.2d 682, 686 (Ct. App. 2000)).Â  For a new trial absolute to be warranted, the verdict must be so grossly excessive as to clearly indicate the influence of an improper jury motive. Â Wright, 372 S.C. at __, 640 S.E.2d at 505 (citation omitted). Â A trial courtâ€™s failure to grant a new trial absolute will be reversed if the courtâ€™s discretion was abused. Id. at __, 640 S.E.2d at 505 (citations omitted).\r\nA new trial nisi is only warranted when compelling reasons justify invading the juryâ€™s province in awarding its verdict.Â  Bailey v.

Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 61, 427 S.E.2d 673, 675-76 (1993).Â  Absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law, the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny a motion for a new trial nisi will not be disturbed upon review of the trial record.Â  Bailey, 318 S.C. at 14, 455 S.E.2d at 691.Â  \r\n \r\nIn the case at hand, Tedderâ€™s complaint requested relief of $70,000.00.Â  Tedderâ€™s medical bills totaled $4,927.15.Â  Total recovery was not achieved according to Tedderâ€™s chiropractor.Â  Tedder testified he suffers from neck pain twenty-four hours a day and experiences spells of dizziness and nausea.Â  Tedder will likely continue to suffer from injuries related to the accident.Â  Thus, the juryâ€™s verdict does not shock the conscience and is within the range provided in the record.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s denial of Dixieâ€™s motion for a new trial absolute or a new trial nisi was not an abuse of discretion.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the evidence presented, the trial court properly submitted to the jury the issue of whether Fowler was acting within the scope of his employment.Â  The trial court cured any improper burden shifting in Tedderâ€™s closing argument and reinforced those corrections as he charged the jury.Â  Admission of medical bills that had a reasonable causal connection with the accident was not an abuse of discretion.Â  The trial court did not err by denying Dixieâ€™s motions for a new trial absolute and a new trial nisi because the verdict was consistent with evidence in the record.\r\nAccordingly, the juryâ€™s verdict awarding damages in the amount of $54,927.15 and the trial courtâ€™s rulings are \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-250","title":"State v.

Enterprises and T.O.E. Residential, LLC (collectively T.O.E.) appeal the trial courtâ€™s order permanently enjoining T.O.E. from using two lots for commercial purposes in violation of restrictive covenants.Â  T.O.E argues the trial court erred by not balancing the equities of the parties and in not finding conditions had changed sufficiently so as to nullify the restrictive covenants.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nKen Buffington, Louis Sheppard, Mary Williams, Brian Meece, and Shirley Jones (collectively Residents) owned lots in the Forest Acres Subdivision in Easley when this action was commenced.Â  The Forest Acres Subdivision is shown on a plat recorded on October 3, 1960. Restrictive covenants for the subdivision were also recorded on October 3, 1960. The restrictive covenants state â€œ[n]o lot shall be used except for residential purposes.â€ However, multiple lots are specifically excluded from the operation of the covenants. In addition, all lots marked â€œReservedâ€ on the plat are unaffected by the covenants.&nbsp; The parties agreed the covenants apply to only 62 of the 110 lots in the subdivision.Â \r\n \r\nTOE owns a Toyota dealership that borders Forest Acres Subdivision.&nbsp; Between 2003 and 2004, it purchased a portion of lot 9, as well as lots 10, 11, and 12 in the subdivision.&nbsp; Moreover, TOE leases the remainder of lot 9.Â  A portion of lot 9 is marked reserved on the plat, lots 10 and 12 are included in the covenants, and lot 11 is specifically excluded from the covenants.&nbsp;Â  TOE acquired these lots to expand the parking lot for its dealership and has already paved all of lot 9.&nbsp;Â  \r\n \r\nResidents brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration of their rights, as well as an order permanently enjoining T.O.E. from using lots 9, 10, or 12 for non-residential purposes. The trial court found that the restrictive covenants did not apply to lot 9 because the lot was marked &quot;reserved&quot; on the plat. Additionally, the trial court concluded T.O.E failed to offer sufficient evidence of changed conditions to warrant invalidating the covenants. Ultimately, the trial court permanently enjoined T.O.E from using lots 10 and 12 for non-residential purposes.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA declaratory judgment action is neither legal nor equitable in nature, but it takes on the tenor of the underlying action.â€Â  Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assâ€™n v. Marshland Trust, Inc.,&nbsp;358 S.C. 655, 661, 596 S.E.2d 380, 382-83&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (citation omitted). Â â€œAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is in equity.â€ S.C. Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302&nbsp;(2001) (citing Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 3 n.2, 498 S.E.2d 862, 864 n.2 (1998)).Â  \r\n \r\nWhen reviewing an action tried by a judge alone in equity, the appellate court â€œhas jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775&nbsp;(1976) (citation omitted).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, an appellate court should not ignore the findings of the trial court because the trial judge was in a better position to evaluate witness credibility.Â  Seabrook Island,&nbsp;358 S.C. at 661, 596 S.E.2d at 383.Â  Although, a party may bring a declaratory judgment action to invalidate a restrictive covenant based on a change of conditions, the party bringing the action bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  Menne v. Keowee Key Prop. Owners Assoc, Inc., 368 S.C. 557, 564, 629 S.E. 2d 690, 694 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nI.&nbsp; Balancing the Equities of the Parties\r\nT.O.E. argues the trial court erred by failing to balance the equities in favor of T.O.E.Â  We disagree.\r\nAn injunction, as all equitable remedies, is granted as a matter of sound judicial discretion; however, the right of the plaintiff to an injunction in the enforcement of a restrictive covenant traditionally receives special treatment.Â  See Houck v. Rivers, 316 S.C. 414, 418, 450 S.E.2d 106, 109&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994).Â  \r\n \r\nâ€œThe rules applicable to the construction of contracts are applicable to the construction of covenants in deeds.â€Â  Id. at 416, 450 S.E.2d at 108&nbsp;(citation omitted).Â  â€œAs voluntary contracts, restrictive covenants will be enforced unless they are indefinite or contravene public policy.â€Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  â€œCovenants that restrict the free use of property must be strictly construed against limitations upon the propertyâ€™s free use.â€ Â Hyer v. McRee, 306 S.C. 210, 212, 410 S.E.2d 604, 605&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1991) (citation omitted). Further, where doubt exists, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the free use of the property.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nAlthough, T.O.E. and Residents agree that the covenants apply to lots 10 and 12, T.O.E. argues the trial court erred in not balancing the equities of the parties, and thereby, invalidating the covenantsâ€™ application to those lots.Â  We acknowledge that Siau v. Kassel, 369 S.C. 631, 641, 632 S.E.2d 888, 893 (Ct. App. 2006), states that based on Houck, a trial court is not required to balance the equities of the parties before enforcing restrictive covenants.Â  However, even were we to balance the equities in this case, equity clearly favors Residents. \r\n \r\nIn arguing that the equities favor terminating the restrictive covenants, T.O.E. claims it will have to relocate its dealership due to pressure from Toyota ifÂ  itÂ  is not allowed to use the land in question for parking. T.O.E. presented testimony that it has already spent over $700,000 on the property.Â  Further, T.O.E. points to the presence of commercial buildings within the subdivision: a motel, a bowling alley, a furniture store, and a Chinese restaurant.\r\n \r\nHowever, these commercial buildings are on lots in the subdivision and an area excluded from the restrictive covenants. Moreover, Residents assert that prior to the lawsuit that they did not realize the commercial buildings were part of the subdivision.Â \r\n \r\nThe evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that while T.O.E. has presented evidence of a potential financial loss, the Residents loss of the character of their subdivision outweighs T.O.E.â€™s financial concerns.Â  See Houck, 316 S.C. at 419, 450 S.E.2d at 109 (stating that a restrictive covenant will be enforced irrespective of the financial damage potentially caused by enforcement of the covenant). SeeÂ­ Also Circle Square Company v. Atlantis Development Company, 267 S.C. 618, 630, 230 S.E. 2d 704, 709 (1976) (Equity will enforce restrictive covenants made for the benefit of an ownerâ€™s land if they remain of substantial value, even though, because of changed conditions, hardship will be visited on the servient estate). Accordingly, the trial court did not err in enforcing the covenants inasmuch as the equities clearly favor the enforcement of the restrictive covenants.\r\nII.&nbsp; Changed Conditions\r\nT.O.E. argues the trial court erred by not finding that changed conditions do not exist to the extent to require nullification of the restrictive covenants.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œTo defeat enforcement of covenants restricting the use of land, changed conditions must be so radical as to practically destroy the essential objects and purposes of the covenants.â€Â  Shipyard Property Ownersâ€™ Assâ€™n v. Mangiaracina, 307 S.C. 299, 308, 414 S.E.2d 795, 801&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1992) (citation omitted); see also Inabinet v. Booe, 262 S.C. 81, 84, 202 S.E.2d 643, 645&nbsp;(1974). Â This change in conditions is also described as such Â a â€œchange in the character of the neighborhood as to render the enforcement of the covenant valueless to the covenantee and oppressive and unreasonable as to the covenantor.â€Â  Dunlap v. Beaty, 239 S.C. 196, 209, 122 S.E.2d 9, 15-16&nbsp;(1961).\r\nAgain, T.O.E. presented evidence of the existence of a motel, a bowling alley, a furniture store, and a Chinese restaurant within the subdivision. However, these commercial buildings existed in areas specifically excluded from the restrictive covenants and apparently within the scheme of the subdivisionâ€™s planned development. This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Residents did not even realize these areas were part of their subdivision. Therefore, the plan of the subdivision and restrictive covenants have, in fact, worked as designed for over 40 years.Â  The commercial areas were allowed to exist, but only on specified lots, and the rest of the lots enjoyed a typical subdivision appearance.Â  Thus, T.O.E has not carried its burden of showing that conditions in the subdivision have changed to the extent that the covenants no longer served the purpose for which they were recorded.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n\r\nBEATTY and WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-253","title":"Rochester v.

McDuffie Stone, III, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Phillip Miller appeals from his conviction for murder, arguing the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nErnest Aiken, Jr., was shot and killed on April 28, 2003.Â  Police arrested Miller for the crime, and three eyewitnesses testified against Miller at trial.Â  According to two of the witnesses, the victim had punched Miller prior to being shot.Â  Based on this evidence, the State requested the jury be charged on voluntary manslaughter.Â  Defense counsel objected to this lesser-included charge.Â  With counselâ€™s permission, the trial court engaged in a colloquy with Miller explaining to Miller his right to have the lesser-included crime charged and the different penalties each crime carried.Â  Miller assured the trial court that he and his counsel had discussed â€œthose kinds of thingsâ€ and after those discussions, Miller decided that he did not want a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter.Â \r\n \r\nPursuant to Millerâ€™s wishes, the trial court did not charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter.Â  The jury convicted him of murder, and he was sentenced to thirty years in prison.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMiller argues the trial court erred by refusing to charge the jury on voluntary manslaughter because there was evidence the victim had punched Miller before getting shot.Â  Specifically, Miller argues that neither the defense nor the solicitor should be allowed to insist that an instruction on a lesser-included offense not be given where it is undisputed there is evidence of that lesser-included offense.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina appellate courts do not follow the plain error rule.Â  See State v. Vanderbilt, 287 S.C. 597, 598, 340 S.E.2d 543, 543-44 (1986) (â€œIssues not properly preserved at trial may not be raised for the first time on appeal.â€) overruling State v. Griffin, 129 S.C. 200, 124 S.E. 81 (1924) (holding that the supreme court will take notice, on defendantâ€™s behalf, of an error in the admission of evidence apparent on the record even though no objection was made). Even in death penalty cases, our supreme court only reviews cases for preserved errors.Â  See State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 60-71, 406 S.E.2d 315, 323-29 (1991) (abolishing in favorem vitae review in capital cases).Â  Furthermore, case law clearly states that an issue cannot be raised on appeal even though another party objects. Â State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 123, 481 S.E.2d 118, 124 (1997) (finding issues not preserved where defendant failed to join in co-defendantâ€™s objections).\r\nHere, not only did Miller make no objection to the manslaughter charge, he specifically requested that no such charge be given.

Qualey, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Frances Pritchett appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s decision ordering a partition by sale instead of adopting the Report of the Commissioners, which recommended a partition in kind.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nI.\r\nIn the 1940s, when Frank Marvin was a child, his parents owned a large tract of property adjacent to the TooGooDoo Creek located in the town of Hollywood in Charleston County.Â  In the mid 1960s, Marvinâ€™s parents sold the property to Buist Hanahan.Â  In the late 1960s, Hanahan also purchased a smaller interior tract.Â  In the mid 1970s, Hanahan offered to sell the entire 235 acre tract (the Property) to Marvin.Â  The Property was once a part of the Ripponton Plantation and was known as â€œSummer Houseâ€ and also â€œWalnut Hill.â€Â  Marvin was unable to purchase the Property alone and asked his friend William Woodward to join him in acquiring the Property.Â  Woodward agreed, and he and his wife, Frances Pritchett, contributed half of the money for the purchase.Â  Later, Pritchett and Woodward divorced, and Pritchett acquired their half-interest in the Property.Â \r\n \r\nIn 2001, because of Pritchett and Marvinâ€™s inability to agree as to how the Property would be managed, Marvin filed a complaint requesting the partition of the Property in kind or, in the alternative, for the public sale of the Property.Â  The matter was referred to a master-in-equity.Â  On May 13, 2003, the master issued a writ of partition appointing five commissioners.Â  On October 30, 2003, the master issued an order extending the time for the commissionersâ€™ report.Â  On March 19, 2004, the master executed an order by consent of all parties to reduce the number of commissioners from five to three.Â  On the same day, the three commissioners submitted the Report of Commissioners (the Report), which recommends partition in kind.Â  The Report concludes partition in kind is possible and practical and proposes dividing the property into two parcels of equal value.Â  According to the Report, Marvin would receive the Northeastern tract, which contained forty percent of the Property, and Pritchett would receive the Southeastern tract, which contained sixty percent of the Property.Â  To accomplish an overall equal division in terms of value, the unique characteristics of the Property required an unequal division in terms of acreage.[1]Â  \r\n \r\nOn March 31, 2004, Marvin submitted objections to the Report.Â  On April 13, 2003, Commissioner John Thomas submitted a Minority Report of Commissioners and Pritchett submitted an affidavit in favor of the Report.Â  On November 17, 2004, a consent order for continuance was filed.Â  On January 19, 2005, the master issued an order of temporary remand to the partition commission ordering the commissioners to assess values to the two partitioned parcels.Â  \r\n \r\nOn March 7, 2005, the master held a hearing regarding the matter at which Commissioner Kenneth Krawcheck and Commissioner Thomas both of whom testified regarding their respective opinion on the partition of the Property.Â  On April 28, 2005, the master conducted an additional hearing at which Pritchett, Marvin, Commissioner Walton Flowers, and experts for both sides testified.Â \r\n \r\nAt the conclusion of the witness testimony, the master made an oral ruling that he would reject the Report but granted the parties sixty days to negotiate a buyout before the master would sell the Property at a judicial sale.Â  On January 4, 2006, the master entered an order rejecting the Report, finding it â€œerroneous, unfair, unjust and inequitableâ€ for failing to: (1) place a monetary value on the property beyond a 2000 appraisal; (2) provide for â€œoweltyâ€[2] because of the discrepancy in the sizes of the two parcels; (3) determine the specific acreage sizes for the proposed partition of land; and (4) make findings as to the equitable division of the property other than the conclusory decision that the division was fair and equitable.Â  The master ordered a public sale of the Property. Â This appeal follows.\r\nII.\r\nAn action for partition is equitable in nature.Â  Wilson v. McGuire, 320 S.C. 137, 140-41, 463 S.E.2d 614, 616 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  â€œIn an appeal of an equitable action tried before a Master authorized to enter final judgment, this court must review the entire record and make its own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Ellis v. Smith Grading &amp; Paving, Inc., 294 S.C. 470, 473, 366 S.E.2d 12, 14 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nIII.\r\nPritchett contends the master erred in failing to adopt the Report and ordering a partition by sale.Â  First, Pritchett argues the master did not follow the proper standard of review because the evidence does not show the Report is â€œerroneous, unfair, unjust, and inequitable.â€Â  Further, Pritchett maintains the master erred by ordering the disfavored remedy of public sale when the greater weight of the evidence shows the Property can be divided in kind and the master did not find that partition in kind was not practicable or expedient. Â We agree. \r\n \r\nA partition procedure must be fair and equitable to all parties of the action.Â  Zimmerman v. Marsh, 365 S.C. 383, 386, 618 S.E.2d 898, 900 (2005).Â  Partition in kind is preferred over a judicial sale of the property. Â Cox v. Frierson, 316 S.C. 469, 470, 451 S.E.2d 392, 393 (1994); see also Pinckney v. Atkins, 317 S.C. 340, 345, 454 S.E.2d 339, 342 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding partition in kind is favored when it can be fairly made without manifest injury to all co-tenants).Â  The party seeking partition by sale carries the burden of showing partition in kind is not practicable or expedient.Â  Anderson v. Anderson, 299 S.C. 110, 114, 382 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1989).Â  In partition proceedings, the court may order the sale of the property and a division of the proceeds to the parties when a partition cannot be fairly and equally made.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-100 (2005).Â  \r\n\r\nThe return of a majority of the commissioners may not be rejected unless the division is clearly shown to be erroneous, unfair, unjust and inequitable.Â  Wilson v. McGuire, 320 S.C. 137, 142, 463 S.E.2d 614, 617 (Ct. App. 1995). Â In order to overturn the valuation made by the commissioners in partition, the valuation must be shown to be â€œso grossly incorrect and unequal as to justify an inference that the commissioners acted from an unfair and improper motive.â€Â  Parrott v. Barrett, 81 S.C. 255, 260, 62 S.E. 241, 242 (1908).\r\nThe master stated the Report is erroneous, unfair, unjust, and inequitable but did not make any specific findings regarding what makes it so.Â  The master focuses on the fact that the Report does not provide any specific values of the parcels.Â  In Wilson, 320 S.C. at 142, 463 S.E.2d at 617, this court found the trial courtâ€™s criticisms concerned the value of the allocated parcels, not the feasibility of dividing the tract in-kind, and we found no competent evidence in the record that any tracts were less valuable than others.Â  \r\n \r\nHere, although the Report does not specify monetary values for the individual parcels, it does provide the two parcels are equal in value.Â  The Report proposes to divide the Property â€œsixty-fortyâ€ to achieve the very thing the master says the Report is lackingâ€”an equality of value.Â  According to the commissioners, because of the topography of the property, a sixty-forty percent division ensures that each party will have an equal share.Â  Certainly, the commissioners were in a good position to make this division.Â  These commissioners were chosen by the parties and the master for their unique expertise not only in real estate, but particularly real estate in this area.Â  In fact, the parties hired Commissioner Flowers in 2000 to appraise the Property.Â  Accordingly, Flowers was intimately familiar with the unique characteristics of this land and the factors that would indicate its value.Â  With these things in mind, we conclude a monetary value was not necessary for the commissioners to divide the Property equally among the parties.\r\nÂ It is also important to note that Marvin has not provided any evidence in monetary terms of a disparity between the parcels as divided by the Commission.Â  Although Marvinâ€™s expert, Tommy Harnett, testified the parcels are not equal based on the factors considered by the Commission, he maintained if the Property were divided, the master should adopt the Reportâ€™s division.Â  Pritchettâ€™s expert, Michael Robinson, testified that the two parcels are equal in value.Â  Based on our examination of the Report and the evidence contained in the record, we do not find the Report erroneous, unfair, unjust, and inequitable or so grossly incorrect and unequal as to justify interference.Â  \r\n \r\nMoreover, for the master to order partition by sale, the master must find partition in kind is not practicable or expedient.Â  The burden is on the party seeking partition by sale to show partition in kind is not practicable or expedient, which Marvin has not shown here.Â  In fact, the master stated, â€œIâ€™m not sure that the partition in kind is not practicable or expedientâ€ and â€œI have no doubt this property can be subdivided under any stretch of the imagination.Â  Itâ€™s 235 acres.Â  Iâ€™m certain it can be divided.â€Â  See Wilson, 320 S.C. at 142, 463 S.E.2d at 617 (â€œ[E]ven if the trial court had a reasonable basis to believe the appellantsâ€™ parcels were more valuable than other parcels, the more appropriate course would have been to recommit the matter to the commissioners to adjust the acreage to be received by the appellants or to have the appellants account for the difference in value by a cash payment and/or deduction from their share of the home place sale proceeds.â€).Â  The division of the Property proposed by the Report is actually very similar to the division Marvin submitted.Â  The evidence does not establish that the parcels are unequal or that the Report is â€œerroneous, unfair, unjust, and inequitable.â€Â  Accordingly, the master should have confirmed the Report.\r\nIV.\r\nThe master abused his discretion in rejecting the Report, and the masterâ€™s order is reversed.Â  We remand for entry of judgment in accordance with the Report.\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., GOOLSBY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The unique characteristics include the amount of water frontage, the old homestead site, the amount of marshland, and a drainage easement.Â \r\n \r\n[2] Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary defines â€œoweltyâ€ as â€œequality as achieved by a compensatory sum of money given after an exchange of parcels of land having different values or after an unequal partition of real property.â€Â  1130 (7th ed. 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-256","title":"SCDSS v.

N.-F. (Child). This appeal arises from the family courtâ€™s termination of Fatherâ€™s parental rights on June 1, 2006, for the following statutory grounds: (1) Child has been out of the home for six months and Father has failed to visit Child; and (2) Child has been out of the home and Father failed to support Child for a period of six months prior to the commencement of the termination of parental rights (TPR) proceedings.Â \r\n \r\nChild was born on February 4, 1997, and resided with his mother until the Department of Social Services (DSS) took him into custody on July 17, 2002. At the time, DSS was unaware of Fatherâ€™s identity and believed someone else was Childâ€™s father.Â \r\n \r\nOn September 8, 2004, DSS instituted this action seeking termination of parental rights and named Father, a Minnesota resident, as defendant.Â  Father submitted to a paternity test, which revealed he was Childâ€™s father.Â  While the TPR action was pending, Heidi Shustarich, the biological aunt of another child involved in the case who is Childâ€™s brother and a resident of Minnesota, filed a third-party petition requesting custody of her biological nephew and Child.Â  On October 10, 2005, the family court ordered the two children continue residing with Shustarich but custody remain with DSS.Â  Additionally, the family court ordered that Father not have visitation with Child because Child was unaware of Fatherâ€™s existence; however, the family court noted Father could â€œfile any appropriate pleadings and/or motions in the matter and take any appropriate action.â€Â  Further, the order provided, â€œthis [c]ourt will not issue a formal order that [Father] pay child support for the minor child . . . .Â  This [o]rder does not relieve [Father] of any moral and/or legal obligation of child support.â€Â \r\n \r\nDuring the TPR hearing on May 9, 2006, Father testified he did not seek visitation because he did not know where Child was until October of the previous year.Â  He stated the family court ordered he could not have any visitation with child.Â  He also testified Shustarichâ€™s residence where Child resided was three blocks away from him, but he still did not see Child.Â \r\n \r\nAs to paying child support, he testified he wanted to pay, but he was â€œnot given any of [his] God-given rights to see this child.â€Â  Further, he stated the court never ordered him to pay child support and DSS asked him only once, in November 2004, to submit a financial report.Â \r\n \r\nFather testified he sometimes babysat Child when Child was an infant.Â  He explained Childâ€™s mother asked him to watch Child for three days but did not return for a week.Â  At that point, he â€œset the rule down . . . [that she] prove the child is mine or please do not bother me anymore because I have [another] child that I need to take care of.â€Â  He testified he never heard from either Child nor his mother until this action.Â  \r\n \r\nPaula Achenbach, Childâ€™s therapist, testified she believed even if Child met Father, Child could not live with Father.Â  She stated Child was in a pre-adoptive home and it would make his reactive attachment disorder worse.Â  \r\n \r\nDenise Hudson, a foster care worker for DSS, testified she sent a treatment plan to Father.Â  The treatment plan provided Father have a psychological evaluation, attend anger management and parenting classes, and maintain employment as well as clean and stable housing.Â  She also testified there was a six month period after Father received the results of the paternity test in February of 2005, but before the family court ordered no visitation; however, Father did not visit Child.\r\n \r\nFollowing the hearing, the family court found, pursuant to section 20-7-1572(3) and (4) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005), Child had been removed from Fatherâ€™s home for more than six months, and Father failed to visit or support Child.Â  The family court also found termination to be in Childâ€™s best interest and, therefore, terminated Fatherâ€™s parental rights.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a TPR case, â€œthe appellate court has jurisdiction to examine the entire record to determine the facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence.â€ Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003) (citing Richland County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1998)).Â  In our examination, the best interest of the child is our paramount consideration.Â  Roe, 353 S.C. at 579, 578 S.E.2d at 735.Â  Additionally, the grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 254, 519 S.E.2d 351, 354 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 747-48 (1982) (holding â€œ[b]efore a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidenceâ€)).Â  â€œOur broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact the trial judge was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.â€Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 293, 547 S.E.2d 506, 509 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nFather argues the family court erred by terminating his parental rights for failure to visit Child.Â  Specifically, Father argues Section 20-7-1572(3) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) provides a TPR proceeding may be commenced if a child has lived outside the home for six months and the parent has willfully failed to visit â€œbut it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from visiting by the party having custody or by court order.â€Â Â  He contends a court order prevented him from visiting Child.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-1572 governs actions for TPR in South Carolina and provides â€œ[t]he family court may order termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the [statutory] grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child.â€Â  In this case, the family court found termination was proper because Father failed to visit Child for a period of six months after removal.\r\nAlthough the October 2005 order provided for no visitation between Father and Child, the order did state Father could seek visitation by filing the appropriate pleadings or motions.Â  Father did not take any affirmative action to see Child.Â  Â Further, by Fatherâ€™s own admission, he definitively knew he was Childâ€™s father in February 2005, but did not seek any visitation with Child.Â  Therefore, from February until the family court entered its order on October 10, 2005, Father could have attempted to gain visitation with Child but did not do so.[2]Â  Accordingly, the record supports the family courtâ€™s finding that Father willfully failed to visit Child.[3]\r\nFurthermore, we find evidence in the record supports the family courtâ€™s finding that TPR is in the best interest of Child.Â Â  Child is in a pre-adoptive home with his half-sibling, and his foster parents intend to adopt Child once he is freed for adoption.Â  Childâ€™s therapist testified Fatherâ€™s parental rights should be terminated so Child will have stability in his life.Â  Additionally, Father knew he could have been Childâ€™s father but did nothing to establish any contact for almost ten years.Â \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the order of the family court is  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE, J., and CURETON, A.J.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The hearing occurred on August 30, 2005, and it is unclear from the record if the family court ordered no visitation at this time or if no visitation was mandated by the October order.Â  However, even if no visitation was ordered in August, six months elapsed from when paternity was established on February 15 until August 30.Â  \r\n \r\n[3] Because we find one of the statutory grounds for termination was met, we need not address the other grounds.Â  See Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Pritchett, 296 S.C. 517, 519, 374 S.E.2d 500, 501 (Ct.
