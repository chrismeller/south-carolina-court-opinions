Freeman appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s acceptance of the accounting\r\n  performed by Cordell Porter.Â  Freeman contends the master erred in: (1) appointing\r\n  Porter because he was biased in favor of Respondents; (2) failing to give proper\r\n  notice of when the accounting would take\r\n  place, thereby depriving Freeman of an opportunity to submit additional\r\n  information to Porter for the purposes of an accounting; (3) awarding damages based on a flawed accounting;\r\n  (4) finding Freemanâ€™s commissions were limited to the funds actually received;\r\n  and (5) allowing Respondents to amend their complaint. Â We affirm.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nIn late 1994, Gregory Ayers, Thomas L. Brown, Everette Fuller,\r\n  Bill Chandler (collectively Respondents), and Freeman formed a general\r\n  partnership called Reidville Investment Properties.Â  Reidville Investment\r\n  Properties was succeeded by Reidville Investment Properties, LLC (Reidville),\r\n  which engaged in the real estate development business.Â  Reidville sought to\r\n  develop property into a residential subdivision known as Abner Creek Station\r\n  (Abner Creek).Â  In order to develop Abner Creek, Reidville obtained a loan in\r\n  excess of $1,000,000.Â  Each of the individual Respondents and Freeman were\r\n  personally liable for the entire amount under the terms of the loan.Â   \r\nReidville selected Freeman as manager due to his background in\r\n  accounting and business management.Â  Freeman was licensed by South Carolina as\r\n  an accounting practitioner and held himself out to be an accounting and bookkeeping\r\n  professional.Â  Freeman maintained all books and records of Reidville,\r\n  controlled the outflow of money, balanced the checkbook, received the bank\r\n  statements, and had the responsibility of all bookkeeping activities.Â  Reidvilleâ€™s\r\n  operating agreement entitled Freeman to a ten percent commission from the sale\r\n  of all lots in Abner Creek.\r\nAbner Creek was not successful.Â  The sales of lots in Abner Creek arranged\r\n  by Freeman were based upon small cash payments with mortgages for the remainder\r\n  of the purchase price. Â He subordinated these mortgages to those of the\r\n  financing banks.Â  Freeman never collected the second mortgages owed to\r\n  Reidville, and some of them ended up being uncollectible.Â  In 1998 and 1999,\r\n  the other members of Reidville became concerned about Freemanâ€™s sparse\r\n  reporting of the financial situation and repeatedly requested to be provided\r\n  with a balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and other financial\r\n  information.Â  Freeman provided very little of this information and resigned as\r\n  manager in May 1999. Â \r\nReidville then retained Cordell Porter to undertake the task of\r\n  sorting and maintaining Reidvilleâ€™s books and records.Â  The records Porter received\r\n  from Freeman were in disarray.Â  Many documents were missing and Porter\r\n  discovered that many checks written on behalf of Reidville had no invoice or\r\n  documentation justifying the expense.Â  Bank statements and cancelled checks\r\n  were missing.Â  After reviewing the documentation Freeman had provided, Porter further\r\n  discovered certain dividends from investments had been deposited into Freemanâ€™s\r\n  personal accounts.Â  An additional bank account in Reidvilleâ€™s name, of which\r\n  the other partners had no knowledge, was also discovered.Â  This account reflected\r\n  numerous deposits and withdrawals with no substantiation as to where the funds\r\n  came from or why the withdrawals were made.Â   \r\nAdditionally, Respondents were forced to personally pay loans and interest\r\n  payments that were called because of Reidvilleâ€™s lack of funds.Â  Freeman did\r\n  not contribute to these payments.Â  Also, Reidville sold a 225 acre tract of\r\n  land, known as the Runion Tract, in order to avoid foreclosure.[1]\r\nRespondents brought this action against Freeman, seeking inter alia, an accounting and actual and punitive damages for breach of his\r\n  fiduciary duties to Reidville.Â  Freeman answered and counterclaimed for fees\r\n  and expenses he claimed were due under the operating agreement as well as\r\n  wages.Â  The matter was referred to a master by consent of the parties.Â   \r\nPrior to the hearing, Respondents filed a motion and proposed\r\n  amended complaint identical to the original complaint except for the addition\r\n  of an equitable subrogation cause of action.Â  On the day of the hearing, the\r\n  master denied the motion, but told the parties he would reconsider the motion\r\n  at the end of the hearing.Â  At the end of the hearing, the master granted the\r\n  motion to amend.Â  The master also indicated he was considering whether an\r\n  accounting was necessary, given the work that had already been done to\r\n  reconstruct the books.Â  Respondents suggested that if a further accounting was\r\n  required, Porter should be the accountant due to his familiarity with the\r\n  books.Â  The master asked both attorneys to submit letters concerning the\r\n  necessity of having someone perform an accounting and to recommend an individual\r\n  to perform the task.Â  Ultimately, the master found Freeman had breached his\r\n  fiduciary duty and the individual Respondents were entitled to equitable\r\n  subrogation against Freeman.Â  The master further ordered Porter to perform an\r\n  accounting on behalf of the court.Â   \r\nAfter Porter issued his final report, the master adopted the accounting\r\n  in his order.Â  Freeman filed a rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, claiming that he did\r\n  not have the opportunity to participate in the accounting and seeking to\r\n  present new evidence.Â  The master denied the motion, finding that Freeman knew\r\n  the accounting by Porter was taking place, but failed to participate in it.Â \r\n  Further, he held Freeman sought to introduce materials which were not new and which\r\n  had been available at the time of the hearing.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Accounting\r\nFreeman contends the accounting was improper for the following\r\n  reasons: (1) the appointment of Porter was improper because Porter was biased\r\n  in favor of the Respondents; (2) Freeman was not given proper notice of the\r\n  accounting thereby depriving him of his right to submit additional evidence; and\r\n  (3) the master erred in awarding damages based on this flawed accounting.Â Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â   \r\nA.Â  Appointment of Porter\r\nFreeman\r\n  asserts the master erred in appointing Porter to perform the accounting because\r\n  Porter had previously been used as a witness for the Respondents and was\r\n  therefore biased in Respondentsâ€™ favor.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt\r\n  the close of trial, the master noted that both sides had requested an\r\n  accounting. Â He also expressed concern that retaining an accountant would be an\r\n  added expense to the parties, and that he was considering using Porter in that\r\n  capacity.&nbsp; Counsel for Freeman stated he had no problem with the work\r\n  Porter had done so far, but he did express reluctance to use him for the\r\n  accounting since he had testified in favor of Reidville.&nbsp;  \r\nThe\r\n  master then requested counsel to submit letters concerning the\r\n  accounting.&nbsp; Counsel for Reidville thereafter sent a letter to the court\r\n  expressing a preference to have Porter perform the accounting.&nbsp; Subsequently,\r\n  counsel for Freeman submitted a letter agreeing that an accounting was needed;\r\n  however, counsel neither objected to the use of Porter nor suggested anyone in\r\n  the alternative. Â By order dated July 6, 2004, the master issued the final\r\n  order with Porterâ€™s accounting attached thereto.&nbsp; Counsel for Freeman\r\n  filed a motion to alter or amend the order, but did not raise any issue\r\n  regarding the appointment of Porter.\r\nWe\r\n  hold that Freeman cannot now challenge the propriety of appointing Porter to\r\n  perform the accounting.&nbsp; Freeman never objected to the use of Porter and he\r\n  failed to suggest an alternative accountant.&nbsp; See Gambrell v.\r\n    Gambrell, 295 S.C. 457, 460, 369 S.E.2d 662, 664 (Ct. App. 1988) (holding\r\n  Wife could not complain of any alleged omission in the family courtâ€™s equitable\r\n  division where the trial judge left it up to the parties to petition the court\r\n  for a determination of the division scheme of certain assets and Wife failed to\r\n  do this); cf. Hough v. Hough, 312 S.C. 344, 347, 440 S.E.2d 387,\r\n  389 (Ct.App.1994) (finding litigant may not sit back and fail to offer evidence\r\n  on a matter and then be heard to complain on that issue); Honea v. Honea,\r\n  292 S.C. 456, 357 S.E.2d 191 (Ct.App.1987) (explaining the burden is on\r\n  appellant to show the trial court committed reversible error and a party cannot\r\n  sit back at trial without offering proof, then come to the appellate court\r\n  complaining of the insufficiency of evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  findings).Â  Moreover, even if we were to construe Freemanâ€™s counselâ€™s statement\r\n  at the close of trial as an objection to Porter performing the accounting, the\r\n  master did not rule on this issue in his order. Because Freeman failed to raise\r\n  this issue in his Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, it is not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526\r\n  S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (â€œIf the losing party has raised an issue in the lower\r\n  court, but the court fails to rule upon it, the party must file a motion to\r\n  alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue for appellate\r\n  reviewâ€).\r\nB.Â \r\n  Notice of accounting\r\nFreeman\r\n  also asserts he was not given proper notice of when the accounting would take\r\n  place nor was he given an opportunity to submit additional information to\r\n  Porter for the purposes of an accounting.Â  Because these arguments were not\r\n  raised at the first opportunity, we find they are not preserved for our review.\r\nOn\r\n  September 26, 2003, the master sent a letter to both parties advising them that\r\n  Porter had been selected as the accountant.Â  Despite this notice, Freeman chose not to participate.Â  On\r\n  May 4, 2004, the master adopted Porterâ€™s accounting; however, a final order was\r\n  not signed until July 6, 2004.Â  Freeman lodged no objection to the accounting\r\n  during this two-month period.Â  Because Freeman failed to raise any objections prior\r\n  to the masterâ€™s issuance of a final order, the issues regarding notice are not\r\n  preserved for our review.[2]Â  See In re Beard, 359 S.C.\r\n  351, 361, 597 S.E.2d 835, 840 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding issue not raised prior\r\n  to trial courtâ€™s final order was not preserved for review).\r\nII.Â  Commissions \r\nFreeman\r\n  contends the master erred in holding that the commissions due on the sale of\r\n  the lots under the agreement were limited to the funds actually received by\r\n  Reidville as opposed to the sales price of the lots sold.Â  Specifically, Freeman\r\n  contends he is due commissions on the lots sold even where the money was not\r\n  collected, and from the sale of the Runion Tract.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe agreement\r\n  sets out the commission to be paid Freeman in the following terms:Â   \r\n\r\n\t(a) Property\r\n  Development:Â  Development of the property shall be under the direction of\r\n  William E. Freeman.Â  He will be paid a 10% commission on the sale of all \r\n\tlots as a development and management fee.Â  This development and\r\n  management agreement, separately written, shall run for an initial period of\r\n  five (5) years with renewal to be by mutual consent.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nPartnership\r\n  agreements are construed pursuant to the rules of contract interpretation.[3]Â  See, Kuznik v. Bees Ferry Associates, 342 S.C. 579, 538 S.E.2d 15\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and\r\n  give legal effect to the partiesâ€™ intentions as determined by the contract\r\n  language. Â United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\r\n  307 S.C. 102, 105, 413 S.E.2d 866, 868 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  When a contract is unambiguous a court must construe\r\n  its provisions according to the terms the parties used, as understood in their\r\n  plain, ordinary, and popular sense. Â C.A.N. Enters., Inc. v. S.C. Health\r\n    &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586\r\n  (1988).\r\nAs for the sale of the Runion tract, the partnership\r\n  agreement unambiguously provided for commissions based on the sale of lots only.Â \r\n  The Runion Tract was a single, two hundred twenty-five acre tract of land,\r\n  which had not been developed and only partially divided.Â  This sale was forced\r\n  in order to avoid a foreclosure, and resulted in a loss to Reidville.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the Runion tract was sold as a single parcel by Reidville, not subdivided and\r\n  sold as part of the Abner Creek development.Â  Therefore, the sale of the Runion\r\n  Tract does not fit the definition of a lot as contemplated in the partiesâ€™\r\n  agreement.Â  Accordingly, the master did not err in failing to award Freeman a commission\r\n  from the sale of the Runion Tract.Â  Â Â \r\nFreeman claims he\r\n  is owed additional commissions on the dollar amounts of the sale, regardless of\r\n  what was eventually collected by Reidville.Â  We disagree.Â  As the evidence\r\n  showed, Freeman, by agreeing to allow purchasers to give subordinate second\r\n  mortgages, collected very little money on the sale of many lots.Â  Freeman\r\n  should not be allowed commissions on money never received by Reidville.Â  The\r\n  agreement contemplated commissions based on the sale of lots, clearly envisioning\r\n  commissions based on the receipt of money.Â  Accordingly, the master did not err\r\n  in limiting Freemanâ€™s commissions to a percentage of money actually received.\r\nIII.Â  Amended Complaint\r\nFinally,\r\n  Freeman contends the master erred in granting the Respondentsâ€™ motion to amend\r\n  their complaint to allow a claim for equitable subrogation.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  motion to amend was made July 3, 2003, and the\r\n  hearing was held July 17 and 18, 2003.Â  Â The amended complaint added a\r\n  claim for equitable subrogation which related to the loan and interest payments\r\n  Freeman failed to make beginning in 1999 and also to the balance of the loan\r\n  which Respondents were forced to pay, even though Freeman was an equal\r\n  guarantor.Â   \r\nRule\r\n  15, SCRCP, provides the complaint may only be amended by leave of the court and\r\n  â€œleave to amend shall be freely given when justice requires and does not\r\n  prejudice any other party.â€ Â A motion to amend is within the sound discretion\r\n  of the court, and the opposing party has the burden of establishing prejudice. Â Foggie\r\n    v. CSX Transp., Inc., 315 S.C. 17, 22, 431 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1993).Â  The\r\n  only time such an amendment should not be granted is when granting it would\r\n  prejudice the other party, and the prejudice envisioned is the lack of notice\r\n  an issue is going to be tried and a lack of opportunity to refute it.Â  Parker\r\n    v. Spartanburg Sanitary Sewer Dist., 362 S.C. 276, 286, 607 S.E.2d 711, 716\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â   \r\nBy Freemanâ€™s own\r\n  admission, he knew equitable subrogation would be an issue prior to trial; in\r\n  fact he had been examined in prior depositions on this very issue.Â  Freeman\r\n  also acknowledged he knew Respondents were pursuing the loan payments.Â  The\r\n  master was advised Freeman had been asked about those payments at his\r\n  deposition prior to the trial.Â  Freeman had the opportunity to question\r\n  witnesses about the issue after the motion to amend had been filed.Â  The master\r\n  stated at the beginning of the hearing that the issue would be revisited, thus\r\n  clearly putting Freeman on notice the issue may be tried.Â  Accordingly, Freeman\r\n  suffered no prejudice in allowing Respondents to amend their complaint, and the\r\n  master did not abuse his discretion in allowing the amendment.Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the masterâ€™s order is\r\n  hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., and CURETON,\r\n  A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Reidville owned the 225 acre Runion Tract\r\n  independent of the property being developed as Abner Creek.Â  The sale of the\r\n  Runion Tract resulted in a $100,000 loss to Reidville.\r\n[2] Â Due to our disposition of the primary issue in this\r\n  matter, we need not address Freemanâ€™s argument that the master erred in\r\n  awarding damages based on a flawed accounting.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993)\r\n  (stating the appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution\r\n  of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n[3] While Reidville was converted from a partnership to\r\n  an LLC, the commissions were still governed by the former partnership\r\n  agreement.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-359","title":"Allen v.

Brown, F. Drake Rogers, Russell G. Hines, all of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation case, Ronnie Robinson appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order.Â  Robinson contends the circuit court erred in finding he had reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) as of July 16, 2001, in finding he did not sustain a psychological overlay injury as a result of his physical injuries, and in failing to order additional medical care and treatment.Â  Robinson also argues it was improper for the circuit court to address the issue of whether he had sustained his burden of proving a period of temporary total disability (TTD) from February 11, 2001 to July 16, 2001.Â  Finally, Robinson contends the circuit court erred in considering facts and issues not in the record.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. [1]Â  \r\n \r\n\r\nFACTS \r\nOn July 9, 2000, Robinson was injured while unloading plastic containers from a truck owned by Respondent Anderson News Company. Â Â The containers were stacked in the back of a truck and fell onto Robinson striking him on the right side of his head, neck, and chest, knocking him to the ground.[2]Â  The next day, Robinson reported the incident to Respondent Anderson who sent him to Doctorâ€™s Care where he was seen by Dr. Richard Rhodes. Â Pursuant to a MRI performed in August 2000, Dr. Rhodes diagnosed Robinson with a herniated disc, returned him to work with the restriction that he not lift anything, and referred him to Dr. George Khoury, a neurologist.Â \r\n \r\nDr. Khoury saw Robinson on September 7, 2000.Â  After reviewing the previous MRI, Dr. Khoury recommended Robinson â€œtry some conservative treatmentâ€ starting with anti-inflammatory medications and injections. Â Dr. Khoury referred Robinson to Trident Hospital where he received two cervical epidural steroid injections which, according to Robinson, did not help his pain.Â Â \r\n \r\nRobinson was next referred to Dr. Joseph Marzluff, a neurologist, who saw Robinson on November 8, 2000.Â Â  After reviewing the previous MRI, Dr. Marzluff opined that the MRI showed â€œdegenerative changes, but no significant disc herniation.â€Â  Dr. Marzluff suggested Robinson undergo physical therapy but stated, beyond that, he had â€œnothing specific to offerâ€ at that time and discharged him to return to work with the restriction that he refrain from lifting anything weighing over ten pounds.Â  Robinson then tried physical therapy, but returned to Dr. Marzluff on November 29, 2000.Â  Dr. Marzluff noted Robinson continued to be symptomatic of neck pain and planned to do a myelogram and post-myelogram CT with the possibility of â€œa discography following that with the thought that surgery might be beneficial if we can see some significant abnormalities.â€Â Â \r\n \r\nRobinson was next referred to Dr. Steven C. Poletti by Pat Botti, Robinsonâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation nurse case manager.Â  Based on his review of the MRI, Dr. Poletti diagnosed Robinson with â€œ[c]entral disc herniation, C3-4, with osteophyte/possible symptomatic disc degeneration at C5-6.â€Â Â Â  Dr. Poletti suggested the same treatment plan recommended by Dr. Marzluff.Â Â Â  Dr. Poletti gave Robinson an impairment rating â€œin the range of 10% if treated inoperativelyâ€ with permanent restrictions â€œof no heavy overhead lifting greater than 35 to 40 pounds, and no constant driving.â€ \r\n \r\nDr. Poletti ordered a second MRI, which was taken on January 8, 2001.Â Â Â  Dr. Polettiâ€™s review of the second MRI revealed â€œC5-6 disc degeneration with posterior protrusion and modic end plate changes consistent with advanced degeneration.â€Â  Dr. Poletti suggested surgery and concluded if Robinson chose not to undergo surgery he would be at MMI and his impairment rating would be 10% but if Robinson chose to have the surgery, it would be premature to place him at MMI.Â  Robinson never had the surgery.Â  \r\n \r\nRobinson was involved in a second work-related accident on February 11, 2001, when a car he was riding in was rear-ended by another vehicle. Â Robinson was seen by Doctorâ€™s Care on February 14, 2001, and was discharged with the restrictions that he not lift more than ten pounds; not lift anything over his head; perform ground level work only; not engage in repeated bending, stopping, squatting, pushing, jerking, twisting, or bouncing; and not engage in repetitive hand activities for extended periods of time.Â  Robinsonâ€™s discharge instructions further indicated his treatment was to consist of taking pain killers twice a day and applying ice to the affected areas.Â  However, Robinson was not released to work because he had been terminated for poor job performance the previous day, February 13, 2001. Â \r\nRobinson continued to be seen by Doctorâ€™s Care until he was again referred to Dr. Khoury on April 4, 2001; however, there is no indication that the visit ever occurred.Â  Following Robinsonâ€™s termination, Respondents refused to provide any further treatment. Â However, Robinson did return to Dr. Marzluff on May 9, 2001, complaining of neck and lower back pain.Â Â Â  Dr. Marzluff found Robinson had â€œdiffuse range of motion of the neck in all directionsâ€ but noted â€œ[n]o specific motor or sensory deficit.â€Â  Dr. Marzluff later discharged Robinson, with no permanent impairment rating and at MMI as of July 16, 2001.Â  On the same day, May 9, 2001, Robinson saw chiropractor Dr. Bernie Miller. Â Robinson saw Dr. Miller from May 9, 2001, until December 29, 2001, incurring bills in excess of $6,000.00. Â \r\nRobinson filed a Form 50 Employeeâ€™s Notice of Claim and Request for Hearing on September 5, 2002, alleging injuries to his head, right shoulder, right upper extremity, neck, back, and chest, arising out of the July 9, 2000 accident.Â  Robinson alleged he was in need of additional medical treatment for his injuries, and he was entitled to TTD payments from â€œJuly 9, 2000 to present.â€Â  On October 4, 2002, Respondent Anderson and its carrier, the Hartford, (collectively Respondents) filed a Form 51 Employerâ€™s Answer to Request for Hearing admitting Robinson suffered a compensable work-related injury, to his neck only, on July 9, 2000.Â  Respondents denied Robinson was in need of additional medical care and denied he was entitled to TTD benefits.\r\nRobinson filed a second Form 50 on September 5, 2002, alleging injuries to his left lower extremity, neck, and back arising out of the February 11, 2001 accident.Â  Robinson alleged he was in need of additional medical treatment for his injuries and that he was entitled to TTD payments from â€œFebruary 22, 2001 to present.â€Â  Respondents filed their Form 51 on October 4, 2002, admitting Robinson suffered a compensable work-related incident on February 11, 2001.Â  Respondents alleged, however, that the injury was only a minor injury to the back and denied Robinson was entitled to any additional medical care or TTD benefits as a result of the injury.Â  \r\n \r\nOn December 5, 2002, Robinson once again returned to Dr. Poletti who obtained another MRI.Â  The MRI taken on January 9, 2003 showed â€œa left sided disc protrusion at the C6-7 level with prominent left neuroforaminal narrowing.â€Â  Dr. Poletti noted â€œ[t]he C6-7 level does show marked disc abnormalityâ€ that was â€œincreased from the previousâ€ visits. Â Dr. Poletti opined Robinson was a candidate for surgery, but it was not something he had to do.Â  Specifically, Dr. Poletti recommended surgery only if Robinson were to reach the point where he cannot live with the problem as it is.Â  Robinson was to follow up with Dr. Poletti as needed.\r\nThe accidents were consolidated into one claim that was heard before a single commissioner on March 3, 2003.Â  On July 23, 2003, the single commissioner issued a Decision and Order finding that Robinson was not at MMI for either accident.Â  The single commissioner found that prior to the second accident, Dr. Poletti had mentioned surgery as an option, and Robinson would have had this recommended surgery but for Respondentsâ€™ refusal to authorize the procedure.Â  The single commissioner found that Robinson is in need of further medical treatment for the physical injuries as well as a resulting psychological overlay injury.Â  The single commissioner also found Robinson was entitled to TTD benefits for 22 days following the July 9, 2000 accident and from February 11, 2001 to the present and continuing from the second accident.Â  Finally, the single commissioner found Respondents were responsible for all of Robinsonâ€™s past care and treatment, whether from authorized or unauthorized medical providers. Â \r\nBoth parties appealed the Order of the single commissioner to the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (the commission).Â  Respondents appealed the findings of the single commissioner that Robinson had reached MMI in July of 2001; Robinson wanted the surgery in July of 2001 and Respondents refused to authorize the procedure; a compensable psychological overlay injury existed; Robinson was entitled to the full award of TTD benefits, maintaining that Robinson was only entitled to TTD for 22 days following the first accident; and Respondents were responsible for unauthorized treatment and evaluation before MMI and all treatment and evaluation before MMI.Â  Robinson appealed only the finding allowing Respondents an offset for any unemployment benefits received after February 11, 2001.Â  \r\n \r\nBy Order dated June 29, 2004, the commission affirmed in part and reversed in part the Order of the single commissioner.Â  The commission reversed the finding of fact that Robinson wanted surgery prior to the second accident and that Respondents refused to authorize the procedure.Â  The commission also deleted the finding that this surgery was needed at the time to lessen Robinsonâ€™s disability.Â  The commission also deleted the finding of a compensable claim of psychological overlay injury.Â  The commissionâ€™s order specifically found Robinson reached MMI as of July 16, 2001, based on the medical evidence.Â  The commission found Robinson was neither entitled to, nor in need of, additional medical treatment nor are Respondents responsible for any unauthorized medical expenses or medical expenses incurred after MMI unless specifically authorized.Â  The commission upheld the finding that Respondents were entitled to offset TTD benefits with any contemporaneous unemployment benefits.Â  Finally, the case was remanded for a determination of what, if any, permanent disability Robinson has suffered.\r\nRobinson appealed the Order of the commission to the circuit court contending the commissionâ€™s findings amounted to an error of law and were not based on substantial evidence in the record.Â  Robinson argued the Order of the single commissioner should be reinstated, except for the portion allowing the carrier to offset TTD with unemployment benefits.Â  The circuit court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case to the single commissioner. \r\n \r\nSpecifically, the circuit court found there was substantial evidence to support a finding that Robinson reached MMI as of July 16, 2001, with regard to any injuries sustained from the two accidents; the commission did not err in finding Respondents are not responsible for all unauthorized treatment before MMI and all treatment after MMI; there was substantial evidence to support a finding that Robinson has not suffered a compensable psychological overlay injury; and the commission erred in allowing Respondents to offset TTD benefits with unemployment benefits.\r\nThe circuit court went on to find Robinsonâ€™s representations of employability may provide evidence of an ability to work during the periods of time which he received TTD benefits and, therefore, remanded the case to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission for a finding of whether Robinson can sustain his burden of proving a period of TTD, from the period of February 11, 2001 to July 16, 2001, despite representing himself to the Employment Security Commission as able and willing to work during this period.Â  The circuit court also ordered the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission to make a determination of what amount of permanent disability or loss of use Robinson suffered, if any.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify a decision of an agency if the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of that agency are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  Bursey v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Under the scope of review established in the APA, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â Â  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 619, 611 S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nâ€œThe findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 492, 541 S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001).Â Â Â  Accordingly, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. Â Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Instead, review of issues of fact is limited to determining whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Â Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 289, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610-1 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œOn appeal, this court must affirm an award of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission in which the circuit court concurred if substantial evidence supports the findings.â€Â  Solomon v. W.B. Easton, Inc., 307 S.C. 518, 520, 415 S.E.2d 841, 843 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached to justify its action.â€Â  Howell v. Pacific Columbia Mills, 291 S.C. 469, 471, 354 S.E.2d 384, 385 (1987).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; MMI and Additional Medical Care and Treatment \r\n\r\nRobinson contends the commission erred in finding he reached MMI as of July 16, 2001, and in failing to order additional medical care and treatment that would tend to lesson his period of disability.Â Â Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nMMI is a term used to indicate that a person has reached such a plateau that in the physicianâ€™s opinion there is no further medical care or treatment which will lessen the degree of impairment. Â Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 467, 622 S.E.2d 577, 585 (Ct. App. 2005). Â Â However, the fact that a claimant has reached MMI does not preclude a finding the claimant still may require additional medical care or treatment. Â Dodge v. Bruccoli, Clark, Layman, Inc., 334 S.C. 574, 579-80, 514 S.E.2d 593, 596 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  MMI is a factual determination left to the discretion of the commission.Â  Gadson v. Mikasa Corp, 368 S.C. 214, 224, 628 S.E.2d 262, 268 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Substantial evidence supports the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Robinson reached MMI as to his physical injuries as of July 16, 2001, and is in need of no additional medical treatment.Â  \r\n \r\nAfter the January 8, 2001 MRI, Dr. Poletti suggested Robinson have surgery and concluded that, if Robinson chose not to undergo surgery he would be at MMI and his impairment rating would be 10% and if Robinson chose to have the surgery, it would be premature to place him at MMI.Â  Robinson never had the surgery and there is no indication in the record that he wanted the surgery.Â  Dr. Poletti testified he never received communication from Robinson asking for the surgery.Â  While there are letters written by Robinsonâ€™s attorney indicating that Robinson wanted the surgery, these letters were never submitted as evidence and were only shown to the circuit court on May 31, 2005, in correspondence regarding a proposed order.Â  Furthermore, none of the doctorsâ€™ notes indicate Robinson requested the surgery.Â  \r\n \r\nOn July 16, 2001, Dr. Marzluff indicated Robinson had been discharged from his care with no permanent impairment rating, and had reached MMI.Â  And while an injury at the C6-7 is still present, Dr. Poletti testified in his deposition that the C6-7 level injury was not mentioned previously and stated â€œI can say that the disc herniation at C6-7 is most probably not related to the original accident.â€Â  Dr. Poletti also confirmed that the C6-7 herniation had not been apparent in any of the prior MRI scans that he reviewed and that he could not state within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the surgery he had recommended to Robinson for the C6-7 level was at all related to the original accident.Â  Accordingly, substantial evidence exists to support the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Robinson reached MMI as of July 16, 2001.Â  \r\n \r\nII.&nbsp; Psychological Overlay Injury\r\nRobinson contends the circuit court erred in affirming the commission on the issue of his psychological overlay injury.Â  We agree. \r\n \r\nThe single commissioner found that Robinson was in need of treatment for a psychological overlay injury. Â In its order, the commission deleted the sentence dealing with the psychological overlay injury from the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  However, the commission failed to make specific findings of facts to support its decision on the issue of the psychological overlay injury.Â  â€œThe findings of fact of an administrative body must be sufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court to determine whether the findings are supported by the evidence and whether the law has been properly applied to those findings.â€Â  Able Communications, Inc. v. South Carolina Public Service Comâ€™n, 290 S.C. 409, 411, 351 S.E.2d 151,152&nbsp;(1986).Â  Where, as here, an order fails to specifically state the findings of fact relied on in reaching the determination it â€œis impossible for an appellate court to review the order for error, since the reasons underlying the decision are left to speculation.â€ Id. at 411, 351 S.E.2d at 152. Â Accordingly, it was error for the circuit court to affirm the commission on the issue of Robinsonâ€™s psychological overlay injury.\r\nMental injuries are compensable if they are induced either by physical injury or by unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment. Â Getsinger v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 335 S.C. 77, 81, 515 S.E.2d 104, 106 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing generally Kennedy v. Williamsburg County, 242 S.C. 477, 131 S.E.2d 512 (1963) and Stokes v. First Natâ€™l Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 50, 410 S.E.2d 248, 250 (1991)).Â  Though, all parties agree that Robinson suffers from psychological problems, Respondents argue these problems stem from a third accident that injured the C6-7 level identified for the first time by Dr. Poletti after the January 9, 2003 MRI.Â  \r\n \r\nFrom our reading of the record, it appears that no evidence was presented to show that Robinsonâ€™s psychological problems stem from anything other than his work-related accidents.Â  Robinson saw psychologist Dr. Lewis Waid beginning January 13, 2003.Â  Dr. Waid diagnosed Robinson with depression stemming from the two work-related injuries and subsequent loss of employment.Â  Dr. Waid stated that Robinsonâ€™s pain is directly related to his medical problems. Â Specifically, Dr. Waid stated: â€œIt is my opinion to absolutely a degree of certainty that these â€“ his state of psychological difficulties at this time and pain stem from those two accidents and to a certain extent certainly some stressors that have followed in the context of those accidents.â€Â  While it is true Robinsonâ€™s first noted complaint was not until October 28, 2002, at the office of Dr. Miller, this was still before any mention of a C6-7 level problem.Â  The only evidence presented indicates Robinsonâ€™s psychological injuries stem from his work-related accidents, and there was absolutely no evidence that Robinsonâ€™s psychological problems stem from the alleged third accident.Â  Furthermore, Dr. Waid testified that Robinson is not at MMI concerning his psychological overlay injury.Â  \r\n \r\nWhile our reading of the record would result in a different outcome on the issue of the psychological overlay injury than the one reached by the commission, the â€œduty to determine facts is placed solely on the Commission and the court reviewing the decision of the Commission has no authority to determine factual issues but must remand the matter to the Commission for further proceedings.â€Â  Fox v. Newberry County Memorial Hosp., 319 S.C. 278, 280, 461 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1995) (citing Drake v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 241 S.C. 116, 127 S.E.2d 288 (1962)). Â Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court and remand this issue to the commission to make specific findings of fact to support its determination that Robinson did not suffer a compensable psychological overlay injury.Â  If the commission is unable to do so, they should reinstate the single commissionerâ€™s finding as to the psychological overlay injury and, given Dr. Waid testimony that Robinson has not reached MMI concerning his psychological overlay injury, determine the additional medical treatment needed for his psychological injury.Â  \r\n \r\nIII.&nbsp; Temporary Total Disability\r\nRobinson argues Respondents failed to preserve for appeal the issue of whether Robinson sustained his burden of proving a period of TTD from February 11, 2001 to July 16, 2001, despite representing himself to the Employment Security Commission as able and willing to work during that period.Â  We disagree.\r\nRobinson argues that it was improper for the circuit court to make such a ruling.Â  However, Robinson failed to move to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  At no time prior to this appeal did Robinson argue that it was improper for the circuit court to rule on the issue of TTD. Therefore, this argument is not preserved for our review.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 460, 535 S.E.2d 438, 444-45 (2000).Â  \r\n \r\nIV.&nbsp; Use of Improper FactsÂ  \r\n\r\nRobinson contends Respondents improperly presented issues and facts outside of the record both through their briefs and in oral arguments.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nAfter a hearing, the single commissioner left the record open for thirty days to permit Respondents to take the deposition of Dr. Poletti.Â  Specifically, the single commissioner stated: â€œIâ€™m going to leave it open for thirty days with this stipulation, that no testimony from this hearing may be used to craft questions for Dr. Poletti, either direct questions asked at this hearing or indirectly in the way of hypotheticals posed to Dr. Poletti.â€Â  Robinson now claims improper testimony was elicited from Dr Poletti using information gleaned from the initial hearing.Â  However, this issue is not preserved.Â  \r\n \r\nInitially, while it is true that Robinson objected to some instances of alleged improper questioning, Robinson never raised the issue of the single commissionerâ€™s, commissionâ€™s, or circuit courtâ€™s use of these improper facts until after the hearing before the circuit court.Â  And though the circuit court never ruled on the issue, Robinson failed to raise the issue in a Rule 59(e) motion, as required.Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 460, 535 S.E.2d at 444-45.Â  Furthermore, most of the instances complained of were never objected to during the testimony.Â  See Webb v. CSX Transp., Inc., 364 S.C. 639, 655, 615 S.E.2d 440, 449 (2005) (stating that failure to contemporaneously object precluded CSX from raising issue on appeal).Â  \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the circuit court erred in affirming the commission on the issue of Robinsonâ€™s psychological overlay injury, we reverse the circuit court and remand this issue to the commission to make specific findings of fact to support its determination that Robinson did not suffer a compensable psychological overlay injury or to reinstate the single commissionerâ€™s finding as to Robinsonâ€™s psychological overlay injury.Â  All other issues are affirmed.Â  For the reasons stated herein, the circuit courtâ€™s decision is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Robinson missed a total of twenty-two days of work stemming from this accident.

State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974), a belated direct appeal of his guilty plea to first degree burglary.Â  The PCR judge otherwise found Petitionerâ€™s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel without merit and denied the petition.\r\nWe first address the belated direct review.Â  In this regard, Petitioner assigns error to the plea judgeâ€™s acceptance of his plea.Â  A review of the guilty plea proceeding refutes the position Petitioner advances on appeal.Â  Petitioner was advised of his rights, and he pled guilty freely and voluntarily.Â  We further find the record supports a factual basis for the acceptance of the plea.Â  Petitionerâ€™s challenge to the Stateâ€™s factual recitation of â€œother things leading up to that day as to why it happenedâ€ does not negate Petitionerâ€™s acceptance of and admission to the commission of the indicted charge of burglary in the first degree.Â  (R.10).Â  We finally note the lack of any objection by Petitioner to the guilty plea proceeding.Â  We find no merit to Petitionerâ€™s belated direct review and affirm.\r\nThe PCR judge otherwise denied relief.Â  We have reviewed the record in connection with Petitionerâ€™s claims of a coerced guilty plea and ineffective assistance of counsel, and we find evidence to support the denial of PCR.Â  Accordingly, Petitionerâ€™s application for a writ of certiorari from the denial of his petition is denied.Â \r\n \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.  \r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2007-UP-364","title":"Alexanderâ€™s Land Company v.

Carter, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Alexanderâ€™s Restaurant Company, Inc. (Purchaser) appeals the trial judgeâ€™s decision denying its request for specific performance of an option to purchase real estate.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn 1996, M&amp;M&amp;K Corporation (Seller) operated a restaurant called Alexanderâ€™s (the Restaurant) on Hilton Head Island.Â  IFBIFB Corporation (Owner) owned the premises upon which the Restaurant was located (the Premises).Â  Rodger Keyes is the sole shareholder of both corporations.Â  At the time, Seller leased the Premises from Owner.Â \r\n \r\nOn November 25, 1996, Purchaser entered into a complex business deal with Seller and Owner, for the sale of both the Restaurant and the Premises that would extend over a three to five year period.Â  The framework for the deal and the partiesâ€™ obligations were provided in an Asset Acquisition Agreement (the Agreement) to which three additional agreements related to the transaction were attached as exhibits: a Personal Property Lease (the Lease); a Sublease (the Sublease); and, a Restated Commercial Lease (the Restated Lease).[1]  \r\nThe Agreement provided for the purchase of the Restaurant business for a total of $1,300,000.00.Â  Under the Agreement, Purchaser was to take possession of the Restaurant, the Date of Possession, on December 2, 1996[2] and was to purchase and close on the Restaurant, the Closing Date, on December 1, 1999.Â  However, the Agreement gave Purchaser the right to extend the Closing Date for two, one year periods.Â  If Purchaser intended to extend the Closing Date, it had to give Seller written notice ninety days in advance of the Closing Date, September 1 of each year.Â  \r\n \r\nDuring this period, while Purchaser maintained possession of the Restaurant but not yet purchased the business, Purchaser rented the Restaurant from Seller, as provided under the Lease.Â  The Lease contained identical dates as the Agreement, such that if Purchaser extended the Closing Date for the purchase of the business, the Lease would likewise be extended.Â  \r\n \r\nSince the Restaurant was situated on leased premises, Purchaser also had to obtain Sellerâ€™s right to lease the Premises from Owner.Â  The parties executed the Sublease which likewise contained identical dates as the Agreement and the Lease, such that the Purchaser had to extend the Sublease if it extended the Closing Date of the purchase of the business.Â  When Purchaser closed on the purchase of the business, the Restated Lease would take place of the Sublease.[3] Â \r\nParagraph 22.16 of the Sublease contained an option (the Option) allowing Purchaser to purchase the Premises.Â  The Option likewise contemplated notice and closing dates similar to the Agreement, Lease, and Restated Lease.Â  The first time Purchaser could exercise the Option was, â€œnot earlier than ninety (90) days prior to the commencement of the first renewal term,â€ i.e. September 1, 1999. Â The last time Purchaser could exercise the Option was, â€œnot later than ninety days prior to the end of the second renewal term,â€ i.e. September 1, 2001.Â  The Option also contained a condition precedent requiring Purchaser to have â€œconsummated the purchase of [Sellerâ€™s] business,â€ before it could exercise the Option.[4]Â  \r\n \r\nFrom December 16, 1996 to August 26, 1999, the parties operated according to the terms of the Agreement, Lease, and Sublease.Â  On August 26, 1999, providing Seller ninety days notice, Purchaser extended the Closing Date on the purchase of the business, and thereby extended the Lease, Sublease and Option contained in the Sublease, for one-year.Â  In 2000, Purchaser did not provide ninety days written notice to extend the Closing Date, the Lease, Sublease or Option.Â  In November 2000, the parties began negotiating a modification of the Agreement to allow Purchaser to extend the Closing Date through December 1, 2001.Â  \r\n \r\nThe parties did not reach a compromise and Purchaser did not close on December 1, 2000, as required by the Agreement.Â  Accordingly, Seller sent notice of default on December 4, 2000, triggering Purchaserâ€™s thirty-day cure period under the Agreement.Â  On December 13, Seller waived the default, and the parties reinstated the Agreement, Lease, and Sublease. Â Seller additionally extended all of the agreementsâ€™ respective terms to provide a Closing Date of December 1, 2001.Â  \r\n \r\nIn summer 2001, the parties again began negotiating a modification, and resulting extension, of the Closing Date on the purchase of the business, Lease, Sublease, and Option.Â  On August 9, Terry Finger, the attorney for Purchaser, wrote Cary Griffin, the attorney for Seller and Owner, indicating Purchaser wished to exercise the Option to purchase the Premises but wanted to extend the Closing Date on the purchase of the business for an additional four years.Â  Griffin replied by letter dated August 14, indicating the Option to purchase the Premises was dependant on the purchase of the business such that Purchaser could not exercise the Option in 2001 without also purchasing the business in 2001.Â  Griffin also reminded Finger of the upcoming notice deadlines, as contemplated in the Agreement.Â  Griffin did suggest that perhaps at a later date and after a discussion with his clients that both purchases could be extended.Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\tOn August 27, Finger faxed a memo to Griffin:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThis confirms our recent phone conversations.Â  [Peterson] and his partners will exercise option on property and we would like to follow up on [Peterson and Keyesâ€™] recent conversation about extending remainder for 3-5 yrs.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nOn September 5, Griffin wrote Finger, informing him the Option had expired on September 1, 2001, â€œno notice has been received as to the exercise of the Option to Purchase. . . . Hence, the Option to Purchase, on its face, is extinguished.â€Â  Griffin later testified that at the time of the September 5 letter, he did not know Fingerâ€™s August 27 memo had been received by his office.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nGriffin and Finger attempted to resolve the problem.Â  On November 15, 2001, Finger tendered the earnest money deposit required in the Option.Â  Griffin returned the check, reiterating his position the Option had expired.Â  By mutual agreement, the parties closed on the Restaurant on December 7, 2001.Â  As a result, Purchaser owned the Restaurant and leased the Premises pursuant to the Restated Lease.Â  However, Purchaser reserved its right to litigate the issue of whether the Option expired.Â  \r\n \r\nPurchaser filed a complaint against Owner, Seller, and Keyes (collectively Defendants).Â  Purchaser asked for specific performance of the Option.Â  In addition, Purchaser sought a declaratory judgment defining the rights of the parties pursuant to the Agreement, Lease, and Sublease.Â  Furthermore, Purchaser alleged unfair and deceptive trade practices, sought damages for breach of contract, and asked for quantum meruit recovery of the improvements it made to the Premises.Â  \r\n \r\nDefendants answered, denying liability.Â  The trial judge held a hearing, at which the parties presented evidence.Â  Defendants argued the Option expired because (1) Purchaser failed to satisfy the condition precedent of purchasing the Restaurant before attempting to exercise the Option and (2) Purchaser failed to tender the earnest money deposit before the Option deadline of September 1, 2001.Â  Purchaser asked for the relief requested in its complaint.Â  Moreover, Purchaser contended Defendants should be equitably estopped from arguing the Option expired and Defendants did not comply with the default provision in the Agreement.Â  \r\n \r\nThe trial judge found in favor of Defendants, holding Purchaser failed to satisfy the condition precedent to exercise the Option and Purchaser did not properly exercise the Option because it did not tender the earnest money deposit.Â  Purchaser moved for reconsideration, and the trial judge issued an amended order correcting minor factual inaccuracies.Â  Subsequently, the trial judge issued a separate order awarding attorneysâ€™ fees to Defendants.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.Â  Hardy v. Aiken,&nbsp;369 S.C. 160, 164-65, 631 S.E.2d 539, 541&nbsp;(2006).Â  An appellate court must look to the â€œmain purposeâ€ of a suit to determine its characterization.Â  Williams v. Wilson, 349 S.C. 336, 340, 563 S.E.2d 320, 322&nbsp;(2002); Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 544, 590 S.E.2d 338, 345&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, characterization of an action as equitable or legal depends on the plaintiffâ€™s â€œmain purposeâ€ in bringing the action.Â  Ins. Finâ€™l Servs., Inc. v. S.C. Ins. Co., 271 S.C. 289, 293, 247 S.E.2d 315, 318&nbsp;(1978).Â  Whether the action is one at law or in equity is determined by the nature of the pleadings and the character of the relief sought.Â  In re Estate of Holden, 343 S.C. 267, 278, 539 S.E.2d 703, 709&nbsp;(2000).\r\nIn this case, Purchaser, as plaintiff, clearly requested equitable relief in the nature of specific performance and equitable estoppel.[5]Â  See Campbell v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 262-63, 603 S.E.2d 625, 627&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (recognizing an action for specific performance is one in equity); McDaniel v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 325 S.C. 405, 409, 481 S.E.2d 155, 157&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (holding estoppel is equitable in nature).Â  Purchaserâ€™s primary cause of action seeks specific performance, while it secondarily asks for damages from breach of contract.Â  Moreover, Purchaserâ€™s request for relief seeks a declaratory judgment and specific performance based on the rights as declared.Â  Furthermore, at trial, Purchaser characterized the action as one for specific performance of the Option.Â  \r\n \r\nOn appeal of an action in equity, tried by the judge alone, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Grosshuesch v. Cramer, 367 S.C. 1, 4, 623 S.E.2d 833, 834&nbsp;(2005).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require the appellate court to disregard the findings of the trial judge.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369&nbsp;(2002).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Exercise of the Option\r\n&nbsp;Purchaser contends the trial judge erred in finding Purchaser had not properly exercised the Option because it did not: 1) tender the earnest money or 2) satisfy the condition precedent that it purchase the business prior to the exercise of the Option.Â  Additionally, Purchaser argues if it were required to perform the condition precedent of closing on the business prior to exercising the Option, the court should have found that such failure to perform was subject to the default and right to cure provisions in the Sublease.Â  \r\n \r\nA.&nbsp; Earnest Money and Condition Precedent\r\nOption contracts are strictly construed in favor of the optioner and against the optionee.Â  Cotter v. James L. Tapp Co., 267 S.C. 647, 653, 230 S.E.2d 715, 717 (1976).Â  â€œIf the option requires performance in a certain manner, time is of the essence and exact compliance with the terms of the option are required.â€Â  Id. at 653, 230 S.E.2d at 717-18.Â  â€œIf the option contract specifically makes the tender of the purchase price a condition precedent to the optionâ€™s exercise, then the plain language of the contract controls and actual tender is required.â€Â  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 110-11, 531 S.E.2d 287, 293 (2000).Â  However, in situations when the option contract does not specifically make tender a condition precedent, a court should â€œconsider the context in which the contract was made and attempt to effectuate the intent of the contracting parties.â€Â  Id. at 111, 531 S.E.2d at 293-94.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Defendants contend and the trial judge held that Purchaserâ€™s written notice of its intent to exercise the Option on August 27, 2001, absent the tender of earnest money, did not comply with the exact terms of the Option as required by South Carolina law.Â  Thus, a review of South Carolina law on the exercise of options aids the court in determining this case. \r\n \r\nIn Cotter v. James L. Tapp Co. the supreme court held written notice was insufficient to exercise an option.Â  267 S.C. at 655, 230 S.E.2d at 719.Â  Landlord leased Tenant space in a large shopping center and provided Tenant an option to lease adjacent areas that Tenant could exercise at any time during the first five years of the lease.Â  Id. at 650-51, 230 S.E.2d at 716.Â  The option could be extended â€œupon the payment by tenantâ€ of an additional monthly fee.Â  Id.Â  The option to extend contained no notice requirement for its exercise.Â  Id.Â  On February 13, 1975, Tenant sent a letter indicating their wish to exercise the option but included no payment.Â  By March 1, 1975, the end of the first five years of the lease, Landlord received no payment from Tenant to extend the option.Â  The supreme court held Landlord was entitled to exact compliance with the terms of the option; and, therefore the fact Tenant gave notice prior to March 1 was completely irrelevant when the option required payment for its exercise.Â  Id. at 653-54, 230 S.E.2d at 718.Â  The court stated, â€œthere is simply no way to equate a requirement to pay money with the giving of notice.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nConversely, in Conner v. Alvarez, the supreme court held written notice was sufficient to exercise an option.Â  285 S.C. 97, 105-106, 328 S.E.2d 334, 339 (1985).Â  Renter of house held an option to credit the first yearâ€™s rent towards the purchase price of the house, renewable at the end of the year and all subsequent years.Â  Id. at 98-99, 328 S.E.2d at 335.Â  The option provided for a re-appraisal at the time the Renter sought to exercise the option but was silent as to notice.Â  Id.Â  Renterâ€™s attorney sent notice of intent to exercise the option on February 2, 1979, acknowledging the need to re-appraise the house.Â  Id. at 100, 328 S.E.2d at 335-36.Â  The supreme court held that the written notice was sufficient to exercise the option.Â  Id. at101-102, 328 S.E.2d at 336-37.\r\nThe supreme court clarified the seemingly contradictory case law in Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 340 S.C. 98, 531 S.E.2d 287 (2000).Â  In Ingram, Tenant entered into a ten year commercial lease for a restaurant. The lease contained a provision giving Tenant the right to purchase the property at any time during the lease term for a sum certain based on an amortization schedule.Â  Id. at 103, 531 S.E.2d at 289.Â  The ten year lease term would terminate on February 28, 1994.Â  In the fall of 1993, Tenant represented to Landlord that he would not be exercising his option, yet on February 22, 1994, Tenant provided written notice to Landlord that he intended to exercise his option to purchase the property.Â  Id. at 103, 531 S.E.2d at 289-90. Â Landlord notified Tenant that Landlord relied on Tenantâ€™s previous representation he would not exercise his option and further advised that the property had to be purchased on or before the close of business on February 28, 1994.Â  Id. at 103-104, 531 S.E.2d at 290.Â  Tenant never tendered any portion of the purchase price prior to the end of the lease, but rather sent a letter on March 8, 1994 indicating that he was ready, willing, and able to close on March 10, 1994.Â  Id.Â  Landlord responded he would not close and Tenant sued for specific performance.Â  The trial court denied specific performance and on appeal this court reversed the decision holding written notice of Tenantâ€™s intent to exercise the option, without actual tender of the purchase price, was sufficient to fulfill the terms of the option contract.Â  Id. at 104, 531 S.E.2d at 290.Â  Landlord appealed.Â  The supreme court reversed finding that the written notice was insufficient to exercise the option.Â  Id. at 108, 531 S.E.2d at 292.Â  \r\n \r\nGenerally, when an option, by its express terms, requires the payment of the purchase money or a part thereof accompany the optioneeâ€™s election to exercise the option, the payment is a condition precedent.Â  77 Am. Jur. 2d Vendor and Purchaser Â§ 48 (2000).Â  However, in Ingram this court awarded specific performance to the tenant based on the general rule of option contracts, or the â€œWilliston rule,â€ which states: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tEspecially in cases of options for the sale of land, most courts interpret the option as conditioned upon the giving of a promise to pay the price for the land, that is, as calling for the formation of a bilateral contract rather than for tender of the actual performance, which would be required for acceptance in a unilateral contract.\r\n\r\nIngram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., 328 S.C. 399, 406, 493 S.E.2d 856, 860 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting 1 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts Â§ 5:18, 738-739 (4th ed. 1990)).Â  Thus, this court found when tenant provided notice â€œhe bound himself to a bilateral and executory contract for the sale of land.â€Â  Id. at 407, 493 S.E.2d at 860.Â  \r\n \r\nThe supreme court did not discount such a general rule; rather the court rejected the notion that only one rule applies in all contexts, stating â€œthe Court of Appeals correctly cited the general rule for the exercise of an option contract.Â  However, this rule is not applicable to every circumstance.â€Â  Ingram, 340 S.C. at 109, 531 S.E.2d at 293.Â  Instead, the supreme court found, when the option contract does not explicitly require the payment of the purchase price as a condition, to determine if payment is necessary it is important to look at both the specific language used in the option contract and the context in which it was made.Â  Id.Â  It is in such a holding that the supreme court reconciles the previous South Carolina case law on option contracts.Â  Both Conner and Cotter were decided on a factual basis. \r\n \r\nThe language used in the lease in Ingram did not explicitly require payment as a condition, but rather required payment â€œat any time during the terms [of the lease].â€Â  Id. at 108, 531 S.E.2d at 292. Â Thus, the supreme court looked to the context in which the contract was made and attempted to effectuate the intent of the parties.Â  The court found the use of a lease had â€œpractical significanceâ€ to the landlord because of new zoning ordinances within the town.Â  Id. at 110, 531 S.E.2d at 293.Â  The restaurant could only operate at the leasehold site because it was grandfathered and risked losing such status if the restaurant failed to remain in operation.Â  Moreover, the court found that the landlord should not be forced to wait for tenant to exercise his option at some â€œreasonable timeâ€ and thereby cause a loss in business profits, potential leases and grandfathered status.Â  Id.Â  Thus, the supreme court found mere written notice of an intent to exercise was not sufficient to exercise the option.Â  Id. \r\n \r\nIn the instant case, the Option does not explicitly require payment as a condition to the exercise of the Option.Â  The Option reads, in part: \r\n \r\n\r\n\t22.16 Option to Purchase.Â  Subject to the condition precedent set forth below, [Owner] grants to [Purchaser], during the first and second renewal term [the] option to purchase . . . the Premises upon the following terms and conditions:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a) A purchase price of ONE MILLION SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND NO/00 ($1,650,000.00).\r\n\t\t(b) The Option must be exercised in writing not later than ninety days prior to the end of the second renewal term and not earlier than ninety (90) days prior to the commencement of the first renewal term.Â  Failure to exercise the option shall cause it to automatically expire without further action by [Owner].\r\n\t\t(c) Upon the exercise of the Option, [Purchaser] shall deposit an earnest money deposit with [Owner] in an amount equal to FORTY-ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND NO/00 ($41,250.00) . . . .\r\n\t\t. . . .\r\n\t\t(d) Closing shall occur within ninety (90) days from the date of exercise of the Option.\r\n\t\t(e)Â Â Â Â  At Closing, TENANT shall deliver a general warranty deed free and clear of all encumberances, . . .\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tAs a condition precedent to the exercise of this Option, [Purchaser] must have consummated the purchase of [Sellerâ€™s] business, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the [Agreement] . . . .\r\n\r\nSubsection (b) states what is explicitly required to exercise the option.Â  Subsection (b) states, (1) how the option is to be exercised, â€œexercised in writing;â€ (2) when the option is to be exercised, â€œnot later than ninety days prior to the end of the second renewal term and not earlier than ninety (90) days prior to the commencement of the first renewal term;â€ and, (3) what occurs if the option is not exercised, â€œFailure to exercise the option shall cause it to automatically expire without further action by [Owner].â€Â  Subsection (c) states what is required once the option is exercised, â€œUpon the exercise of the Option, [Purchaser] shall deposit an earnest money deposit with [Owner] in an amount equal to FORTY-ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND NO/00 ($41,250.00).â€Â  \r\n \r\nSince it is not clear from the language of the Option that payment of the earnest money was a condition for the exercise of the Option, the court must look at both the specific language used in the Option and the context in which it was made.Â  The Option is arranged as a time-table, first requiring an exercise of the option, then a deposit of earnest money, and finally a closing.Â  Moreover, if Defendants intended the earnest money be paid on the date the Option was exercised Defendants knew how to make such a requirement.Â  In fact, Defendants made such a requirement in the â€œWalkaway Optionâ€ contained in the Addendum to the Agreement.Â  The Walkaway Option states: \r\n \r\n\r\n\t30.&nbsp; Walkaway Option.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary, and subject to the conditions and procedures set forth below, the Seller grants to Purchaser a â€œWalkaway Optionâ€ upon the following terms and conditions: \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a)&nbsp; The amount required to exercise the Walkaway Option shale be One Hundred Fifty Thousand and N0/00 Dollars ($150,000.00),\r\n\t\twhich shall be paid in certified funds on the date the Walkaway Option is exercised. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  Likewise, the September 5, 2001 letter from Defendantâ€™s attorney suggests notice was all that was required to exercise the Option.Â  The letter reads, â€œno notice has been received as to the exercise of the Option to Purchase. . . . Hence, the Option to Purchase, on its face, is extinguished.â€Â  \r\n \r\nFurthermore, unlike the facts in Ingram, the Defendants did not risk such losses as business profits, potential leases and grandfathered status.Â  In this case, the lease term had not run, Purchaser was contractually bound to continue to pay rent and to purchase the business at the end of the year.Â  As for the condition precedent requiring Purchaser â€œhave consummated the purchase of [Sellerâ€™s] businessâ€ prior to the exercise of the Option, it is clear Purchaser had not purchased the business as of the date it exercised the Option.Â  Because we find Purchaser properly exercised the Option, but for the condition precedent, we address whether Purchaser was entitled to notice of default and a thirty day right to cure.Â  \r\n \r\nB.&nbsp; Notice of Default \r\nPurchaser argues if it were required to perform the condition precedent of closing on the business prior to exercising the Option, the court should have found that such failure to perform was subject to the default and right to cure provisions in the Sublease.Â  Defendants contend they had no duty to give notice of default and opportunity to cure because Purchaserâ€™s failure to exercise the Option was not a default.Â  \r\n \r\nWhen a contract is clear and unambiguous, the construction thereof is a question of law for the court.Â  Stribling v. Stribling, 369 S.C. 400, 404, 632 S.E.2d 291, 293 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  However, if a contract is ambiguous, or capable of more than one construction, the question of what the parties intended becomes one of fact.Â  Middleborough Horizâ€™l Prop. Regime Council of Co-Owners v. Montedison S.p.A., 320 S.C. 470, 477, 465 S.E.2d 765, 770&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).\r\nIn construing a contract, the main concern of the court is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties as determined by the contract language.Â  Schulmeyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 353 S.C. 491, 495, 579 S.E.2d 132, 134&nbsp;(2003).Â  When one construction of a contract makes the contract unusual or extraordinary, while another construction, equally consistent with the language employed, would make it reasonable, fair, and just, the latter construction must prevail.Â  Farr v. Duke Power Co., 265 S.C. 356, 362, 218 S.E.2d 431, 434 (1975).Â  All contracts should receive a sensible and reasonable construction, instead of a construction which will lead to absurd consequences or unjust results.Â  Walters v. Summey Bldg. Sys., Inc., 311 S.C. 507, 510-11, 429 S.E.2d 854, 856 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  Further, an interpretation which gives reasonable meaning to all contract provisions will be preferred to one which leaves a portion of the writing useless, meaningless or inexplicable.Â  17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 377 (2004); see also 11 Williston on Contracts Â§32:5 (4th Ed.) (â€œAn interpretation which gives effect to all provisions of the contract is preferred to one which renders a portion of the writing superfluous, useless or inexplicable.â€) \r\n \r\nReading the default provisions of the Sublease indicates a clear understanding that a failure of a condition precedent would be considered a default.Â  Paragraph 22.17 of the Sublease provides, in part[6]: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tA material breach or a default, as well as a failure of condition precedent, with respect to the obligation by any party or its assigns and guarantors to perform under this Sublease shall be a breach or default under the Asset Acquisition Agreement [ ] and Personal Property Lease [ ].Â  A material breach or a default, as well as a failure of condition precedent, with respect by any party to perform under the Asset Acquisition Agreement or under the Personal Property Lease shall be a breach or a default under this Sublease.\r\n\r\nThe Sublease contains only two condition precedents.Â  The first condition precedent is found in Paragraph 2, Term, which provides, in part: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tSUBTENANT shall have the ability to renew the Lease for two one (1) year renewal terms. Â Provided, however, as a condition precedent to the option for either renewal term, SUBTENANT must also extend the Closing Date for the same period as the renewal term under the Asset Acquisition Agreement dated the 29th day of November, 1996Â Â Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe second condition precedent is found in Paragraph 22.16, Option to Purchase, which states, in part, â€œ[a]s a condition precedent to the exercise of this Option, SUBTENANT must have consummated the purchase of TENANTS business, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Asset Acquisition Agreement.â€Â  \r\n \r\nA failure of either condition precedent noted above is a default under the Sublease, as provided for under Paragraph 22.17 of the Sublease.Â  As provided in the Sublease, under Paragraph 16.1(f), Default: Default by SUBTENANT:\r\n\r\n\tUpon the occurrence of any one or more of the following events, â€¦, then there shall be an â€œEvent of Defaultâ€: if SUBTENANT fails in the performance of any of the other covenants or conditions hereof and fails to cure such non-performance within thirty (30) days after the receipt of written notice from the TENANT specifying the non-performance.[7]Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nBecause we find Purchaser properly exercised the Option, but for the condition precedent of closing on the business, we hold the Defendantâ€™s should have given Purchaser notice of default and the thirty day right to cure period provided under Paragraph 16.1(f) of the Sublease. Â Therefore, we find specific performance was appropriate and remand to the trial court for an order enforcing the Option. \r\n \r\nII.&nbsp; Attorney Fees \r\nIn the event Purchaser won on appeal, Purchaser sought reversal of the trial judgeâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees to Defendants and requested this court to remand the issue to the trial court for a determination of appropriate attorneysâ€™ fees to be awarded Purchaser.Â  \r\n \r\nDefendants were granted $65,000.00 in attorneysâ€™ fees pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement and Sublease.Â  Paragraph 9 of the Agreement reads, â€œ[i]n the event that litigation arises with respect to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and litigation expenses from the non-prevailing party or parties.â€Â  The Sublease contains the identical provision under Paragraph 22.18, but with the substitution of â€œSubleaseâ€ for â€œAgreement.â€Â  \r\n \r\nBecause we reverse and remand for an order enforcing the Option, we find the Defendants are not the prevailing party and therefore, under the agreements are not entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Therefore, we reverse the award and remand for a determination of appropriate attorneysâ€™ fees.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Statute of Frauds\r\nLastly, Defendants argue, as an additional sustaining ground, Purchaser attempted to orally modify a contract without a writing in conformance with the Statute of Frauds.Â  This issue was raised but not ruled upon below, and we decline to address the issue.Â  See Iâ€™On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (holding when reversing a lower courtâ€™s decision it is within an appellate courtâ€™s discretion as to whether to address any additional sustaining grounds); see also Gecy v. Bagwell, 372 S.C. 237, 243-44, 642 S.E.2d 569, 572 (2007) (declining to address an additional sustaining ground); and Vaught v. A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons, Inc., 366 S.C. 475, 485, 623 S.E.2d 373, 378 (2005) (reversing the lower court and declining to discuss additional sustaining grounds). \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Purchaser properly exercised the Option, but for the condition precedent, and as such Defendantâ€™s should have given Purchaser notice of default and the thirty day right to cure period contemplated within the agreements.Â  Therefore, we find specific performance was appropriate and remand to the trial court for an order enforcing the Option.Â  Accordingly, we also find Defendants are not the prevailing party and, therefore, reverse the award and remand for a determination of appropriate attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  In light of our disposition, we need not address Purchaserâ€™s remaining issues.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340-41, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address a remaining issue when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ. concur.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The parties expressly evidenced their intent for all agreements to be construed as one comprehensive transaction in the Agreement, â€œ[t]he Exhibits and other documents referred to in this Agreement are an integral part of this Agreement.â€\r\n[2] The parties later amended the Agreement to define the Date of Possession as December 16, 1996.Â  \r\n \r\n[3] The Restated Lease provided for a one hundred and twenty month term commencing on December 1, 1996.Â  In addition, Purchaser had the right to renew the Restated Lease for one ten-year term.Â  \r\n \r\n[4] In the event Purchaser had purchased the business, the Restated Lease also contained an option to purchase with similar terms to the Option in the Sublease.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\n[5] Purchaser voluntarily dismissed its unfair trade practices claim and did not appeal the denial of quantum meruit relief.\r\n[6] The Lease contains the exact language as the Sublease in Paragraph 19, Breach and/or Default, but with the substitution of â€œLeaseâ€ for â€œSubleaseâ€ and â€œSublease Agreementâ€ for â€œPersonal Property Lease.â€ The Agreement also contains a similar provision in Paragraph 9, Default, which reads, in part, â€œ[t]he parties agree that a default and/or a failure of condition under this Agreement shall constitute an event of default and/or failure of condition under the Personal Property Lease, the Sublease Agreement and/or the Restated Lease, and vice versa.â€Â  \r\n \r\n[7] The Lease and Agreement likewise contemplate a notice requirement in the event of default and a right to cure period for a failure of a condition precedent.Â  The Lease provides under Paragraph 10(f), Default by Lessee: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tUpon the occurrence of any one or more of the following events, â€¦, then there shall be an â€œEvent of Defaultâ€: if Lessee fails in the performance of any of the other covenants or conditions hereof and fails to cure such non-performance within thirty (30) days after the receipt of written notice from Lessor specifying the non-performance.\r\n\r\nUnder Paragraph 9, Default, of the Agreement, it reads: â€œShould any party default in performance under this Agreement, then the non-defaulting party, after providing notice of default and a ten (10) day cure opportunity to cure said default, may seek all available remedies under South Carolina law.â€Â  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
