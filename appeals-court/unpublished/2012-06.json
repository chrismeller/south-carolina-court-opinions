Swerling of Columbia, Katherine Carruth Goode\r\n        of Winnsboro for Appellant.\r\n\r\n        Attorney General Alan McCrory Wilson, Chief Deputy\r\n        Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Senior Assistant\r\n        Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n        Attorney General William M. Blitch, Jr., all of Columbia,\r\n        and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for\r\n        Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Jack Harrison, Jr., was indicted for misrepresenting identity to a\r\nlaw enforcement officer, possession of marijuana, and possession with intent to\r\ndistribute (PWID) methamphetamine. He pled guilty to the charge of\r\nmisrepresenting his identity, and was convicted of the marijuana and\r\nmethamphetamine charges. Harrison appeals asserting the trial court erred in (1)\r\nadmitting evidence obtained as a result of a traffic stop because the basis of the\r\nstop was a ruse and the officers did not have reasonable suspicion or probable\r\ncause; (2) admitting the marijuana and methamphetamine evidence because the\r\nofficers exceeded the appropriate parameters for a warrantless search; and (3)\r\nadmitting the methamphetamine evidence because the State failed to establish a\r\ncomplete chain of custody. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.      We find no error in the trial court's admission of evidence obtained as a\r\nresult of the traffic stop. First, we note trial counsel did not argue to the trial court\r\nthat the stop, being based upon the broken windshield, was an improper basis or\r\nwas some type of ruse. We further note Harrison did not object to the trial court's\r\nruling that the traffic stop provided an independent basis for the stop, such that a\r\nreasonable suspicion analysis for an investigatory stop was not necessary. Thus, it\r\nis questionable whether this argument is properly preserved. See State v.\r\nStahlnecker, 386 S.C. 609, 617, 690 S.E.2d 565, 570 (2010) (holding an objection\r\nmust be made on a specific ground, and for an issue to be properly preserved it has\r\nto be raised to and ruled on by the trial court). Regardless, we find no error, as\r\nthere is sufficient evidence that the traffic stop was proper based upon the officer's\r\nobservation of a cracked windshield. See State v. Banda, 371 S.C. 245, 252, 639\r\nS.E.2d 36, 40 (2006) (\"The decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the\r\npolice have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.\"); see\r\nalso State v. Corley, 392 S.C. 125, 126-27 n.2, 708 S.E.2d 217, 217-18 n.2 (2011)\r\n(Corley II) (noting, where officer observed certain actions by defendant raising\r\nofficer's suspicion and causing officer to follow defendant in car, and officer\r\ninitiated traffic stop after observing defendant failing to use a turn signal, the\r\ntraffic violation served as an independent basis for the vehicle stop); State v.\r\nCorley, 383 S.C. 232, 240, 679 S.E.2d 187, 191-92 (Ct. App. 2009) (Corley I),\r\naff'd as modified, 392 S.C. 125, 708 S.E.2d 217 (2011) (holding a minor traffic\r\nviolation arrest would not be rendered invalid by the fact it was a \"mere pretext for\r\na narcotics search\").\r\n\r\n2.     We find no error in the trial court's admission of the marijuana and\r\nmethamphetamine evidence based on Harrison's argument the officers exceeded\r\nthe appropriate parameters for a warrantless inventory search. First, we again find\r\nit questionable whether Harrison's appellate argument regarding the opening of\r\n\nclosed containers resulting from inventory searches and the requirement of a\r\ndepartment policy on the matter, is preserved for review, as it is not clear that trial\r\ncounsel raised this argument to the trial court. Even assuming, as Harrison\r\ncontends, the specific grounds are apparent from the record, it is clear that the trial\r\ncourt did not rule on the issue of opening closed containers during inventory\r\nsearches and the requirement of policies on the matter. See State v. Dunbar, 356\r\nS.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003) (holding, in order for an issue to be\r\npreserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the\r\ntrial court; issues not so raised and ruled upon in the trial court will not be\r\nconsidered on appeal). Additionally, when trial counsel moved to suppress the\r\ndrug evidence based upon the officers' failure to obtain a search warrant, and the\r\ntrial court ruled that the can simply fell apart, thus indicating there was no search\r\nof the can, trial counsel did not argue against the court's ruling, but apparently\r\naccepted this basis for denying the motion to suppress. Trial counsel never argued\r\nto the trial court that the evidence did not support the court's determination that the\r\ncan simply fell apart, nor did he argue that the can only fell apart because the\r\nofficer improperly shook the can. Thus, these arguments made by Harrison on\r\nappeal are not preserved for review. See State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 16, 482\r\nS.E.2d 760, 765 (1997) (noting an issue is not preserved for review if the objecting\r\nparty accepts the judge's ruling and does not contemporaneously make an\r\nadditional objection). At any rate, we find the evidence in the record supports the\r\ntrial court's ruling that the can simply fell apart, thereby revealing the drugs in\r\nquestion. See State v. Winkler, 388 S.C. 574, 583, 698 S.E.2d 596, 601 (2010)\r\n(noting the admission or exclusion of evidence is within the discretion of the trial\r\ncourt and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion; an abuse of\r\ndiscretion occurs when the trial court's conclusions either lack evidentiary support\r\nor are controlled by an error of law).\r\n\r\n3.      We find no error in the trial court's admission of the methamphetamine\r\nevidence based on Harrison's argument the State failed to establish a complete\r\nchain of custody of the substance from the time it was seized until it was analyzed.\r\nIn regard to the argument concerning the four-month period the evidence was at\r\nSLED, the law provides a party offering fungible items such as drugs or blood\r\nsamples into evidence must establish a complete chain of custody as far as\r\npracticable. State v. Hatcher, 392 S.C. 86, 91, 708 S.E.2d 750, 753 (2011). The\r\npolice need not account for every hand-to-hand transfer of a fungible item; rather,\r\nit is sufficient if the evidence demonstrates a reasonable assurance the condition of\r\nthe item remains the same from the time it was obtained until the time it is\r\nintroduced at trial. Id. at 94, 708 S.E.2d at 754. As to Harrison's assertion the trial\r\ncourt abused its discretion in admitting the evidence based upon admittedly\r\n\ninaccurate information presented by the State concerning the custody of the\r\nevidence on May 9 and 10, 2006, while in custody of officers with the Saluda\r\nCounty Sheriff's Office, we likewise find no error. Harrison contends there is\r\ninconsistency in the evidence as to who placed the item in the drop box and when,\r\nand the trial court therefore abused its discretion in admitting the evidence. This\r\nargument does not involve a missing link in the chain. Rather, it involves a\r\ndiscrepancy in regard to the evidence. \"Courts have abandoned inflexible rules\r\nregarding the chain of custody and the admissibility of evidence in favor of a rule\r\ngranting discretion to the trial courts.\" Id. Whether the chain of custody has been\r\nestablished as far as practicable depends on the unique factual circumstances of\r\neach case. Id. \"The ultimate goal of chain of custody requirements is simply to\r\nensure that the item is what it is purported to be.\" Id. at 95, 708 S.E.2d at 755.\r\nFurther, where the identity of persons handling a specimen is established, our\r\ncourts have found evidence regarding its care goes only to the weight of the\r\nfungible item as credible evidence, and \"[w]here there is a weak link in the chain\r\nof custody, as opposed to a missing link, the question is only one of credibility and\r\nnot admissibility. \" State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419, 424, 544 S.E.2d 835, 837\r\n(2001); see also State v. Johnson, 318 S.C. 194, 196, 456 S.E.2d 442, 444 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1995) (holding, although a discrepancy existed as to the dates the evidence\r\ncustodian received the drug evidence from the detective, no evidence was\r\npresented to indicate the drugs were not within the control of identifiable people\r\nduring the entire time, and a reconciliation of the discrepancy was not necessary to\r\nestablish the chain of custody, but merely reflected upon the credibility of the\r\nevidence rather than its admissibility). Here, the identity of persons handling the\r\nevidence was established and there was no evidence presented to indicate the\r\nfungible item was not within the control of identifiable people during the entire\r\ntime. The discrepancy in regard to the evidence did not render the drug evidence\r\ninadmissible, but reflected only on the credibility of the evidence. Accordingly,\r\nwe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the chain of custody\r\nsufficient under the unique facts of this case.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Harrison's convictions are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and HUFF and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-349","title":"SCDSS v.

Falkner Wilkes, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n             David James Brousseau, of McIntosh, Sherard, &\r\n             Sullivan, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Richard Allen Shehan (Husband) appeals from an order of the\r\nfamily court (1) finding Angela Jo Branyon Shehan (Wife) entitled to equitable\r\ndistribution of certain assets that were subject to an antenuptial agreement between\r\nthe parties, and (2) awarding Wife attorney fees and costs. We affirm.\r\n\n1.     After de novo review, we find the trial court did not err in finding a change\r\nof circumstances existed warranting the agreement not be enforced as to certain\r\nproperty that may have otherwise been covered by the agreement. In appeals from\r\nthe family court, an appellate court reviews factual and legal issues de novo.\r\nSimmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011). \"De novo\r\nreview permits appellate court fact-finding, notwithstanding the presence of\r\nevidence supporting the trial court's findings.\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 390,\r\n709 S.E.2d 650, 654-55 (2011). However, while this court has the authority to find\r\nfacts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, \"we\r\nrecognize the superior position of the family court judge in making credibility\r\ndeterminations.\" Id. at 392, 709 S.E.2d at 655. Further, de novo review does not\r\nrelieve an appellant of his \"burden to demonstrate error in the family court's\r\nfindings of fact.\" Id. \"Consequently, the family court's factual findings will be\r\naffirmed unless appellant satisfies this court that the preponderance of the evidence\r\nis against the finding of the [family] court.\" Id. (alteration in original) (internal\r\ncitation and quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nFirst, we find no merit to Husband's assertion that the record does not support the\r\nfamily court's finding that Husband used his income to purchase assets, while Wife\r\nprimarily used her income to support the family's general living expenses. The\r\nrecord is replete with evidence that Wife's income was predominantly used on\r\nmedical and dental bills, clothing, groceries, childcare, school supplies, family\r\nvacations, gifts, and furnishings for the home, and that she was unable to purchase\r\nreal property because she did not have the money to do so. Additionally, there is\r\nevidence Husband used his income for the acquisition of real property and farm\r\nequipment, as well as to purchase items for the sole enjoyment of his hobbies.\r\nConsidering the family court judge's superior position in making credibility\r\ndeterminations, we find Husband has not met his burden of demonstrating error in\r\nthe family court's findings of fact.1\r\n\r\nWe further find no error in the family court's determination that a change in\r\ncircumstances warranted invalidating the provisions of the agreement as to certain\r\nproperty. Our courts have adopted the following test to determine whether a\r\nprenuptial agreement should be enforced: \"(1) Was the agreement obtained through\r\nfraud, duress, or mistake, or through misrepresentation or nondisclosure of material\r\nfacts? (2) Is the agreement unconscionable? (3) Have the facts and circumstances\r\nchanged since the agreement was executed, so as to make its enforcement unfair\r\n\r\n1 We note the trial court made a credibility finding in favor of Wife concerning her\r\nallegation of physical cruelty by Husband, even though Husband denied the same.\r\n\nand unreasonable?\" Hardee v. Hardee, 355 S.C. 382, 389, 585 S.E.2d 501, 504\r\n(2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where the change in circumstances\r\nrelied upon to avoid enforcement of an antenuptial agreement is completely\r\nforeseeable to the party seeking to avoid enforcement, our courts have found the\r\nfacts and circumstances at the time of enforcement have not changed to the extent\r\nthat enforcement of the agreement is unfair or unreasonable. See id. at 390-91, 585\r\nS.E.2d at 505 (holding our supreme court upheld this court's determination that the\r\nfacts and circumstances of wife's worsening health had not changed to such an\r\nextent that it was unreasonable or unfair to enforce the agreement where wife had\r\nserious health problems at the time she signed the antenuptial agreement, the\r\nagreement specifically noted wife's health problems, it was completely foreseeable\r\nto wife that her health would worsen, and wife's attorney advised her not to sign\r\nthe agreement because of her health problems).\r\n\r\nA review of the antenuptial agreement in this matter shows it generally\r\ncontemplated both parties would be able to acquire assets. More importantly, the\r\nagreement specifically states that \"[e]ach of the parties recognize the obligation of\r\nmutual support and agree that nothing contained herein is an attempt to interfere\r\nwith that obligation.\" (emphasis added). The evidence shows that, contrary to this\r\nagreement, Husband did not provide mutual support to the marriage. Rather, he\r\nfocused much of his income on purchasing assets held in his name alone, while\r\nWife's income was primarily consumed by non-asset producing support of the\r\nfamily. Further, we disagree with Husband's assertion that the change in\r\ncircumstances was completely foreseeable because, as noted, the prenuptial\r\nagreement anticipates that both parties would be able to acquire assets after the\r\nmarriage, and both parties would provide \"mutual support\" to the marriage. The\r\nevidence shows Husband did not live up to the provision of mutual support in the\r\nagreement and Wife was foreclosed from acquiring her own assets as a result.\r\nThus, we find the facts and circumstances have changed since execution of the\r\nprenuptial agreement so as to make enforcement of the provision concerning\r\nacquisition of property by the parties during the marriage unfair and unreasonable.\r\n\r\nBecause our analysis concerning the change in circumstances is dispositive, we\r\nneed not address the court's alternate rulings on transmutation and special equity.\r\nSee Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\nS.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining\r\nissues when disposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\n2.     As to Husband's contention the family court erred in awarding attorney fees\r\nand costs to Wife, we likewise find no reversible error.2 The decision to award\r\nattorney's fees is within the family court's sound discretion, and although appellate\r\nreview of such an award is de novo, the appellant still has the burden of showing\r\nerror in the family court's findings of fact. Chisholm v. Chisholm, 396 S.C. 507,\r\n510, 722 S.E.2d 222, 223-24 (2012). In deciding whether to award attorney fees\r\nand costs, the court should consider the following factors: (1) the ability of the\r\nparty to pay his or her own fees; (2) beneficial results obtained; (3) the financial\r\nconditions of the parties; and (4) the effect a fee award will have on the party's\r\nstandard of living. E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816\r\n(1992).\r\n\r\nWe first note that Husband fails to point out how he \"prevailed on the majority of\r\nissues,\" as he contends, and we find no support for this conclusory assertion in the\r\nrecord before us. Additionally, as previously noted, we decline to reverse the\r\nfamily court's decision to invalidate provisions of the agreement as to certain\r\nproperty and the award of a portion of that property to Wife. Here, the family\r\ncourt properly considered the E.D.M. factors and determined an award of attorney\r\nfees and costs was appropriate. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the\r\ncourt's decision to award Wife attorney fees and costs.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the family court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and HUFF and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Husband does not challenge on appeal the reasonableness of the amount of fees\r\nawarded, but only the family court's decision to award Wife attorney fees and\r\ncosts.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-354","title":"Grostick v.

We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.\r\n\r\nAs to the denial of Deborah's motion for partial summary judgment, \"an order\r\ndenying summary judgment is never reviewable on appeal.\" Bank of N.Y. v.\r\nSumter Cnty., 387 S.C. 147, 154, 691 S.E.2d 473, 477 (2010).\r\n\r\nAs to the denial of Deborah's motion for sanctions, her lawyer's question opened\r\nthe door to Minor's testimony. Further, the trial court's jury charge cured any\r\nprejudice Minor's testimony may have caused her. See Manios v. Nelson, Mullins,\r\nRiley & Scarborough, LLP, 389 S.C. 126, 144, 697 S.E.2d 644, 653 (Ct.

See Austin v. Stokes-\r\nCraven Holding Corp., 387 S.C. 22, 42, 691 S.E.2d 135, 145 (2010) (\"When we\r\nreview a trial judge's . . . denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, we\r\nreverse only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling is\r\ngoverned by an error of law.\"). Her argument on appeal that Minor is judicially\r\nestopped from denying he was the driver is not preserved. See Pikaart v. A & A\r\nTaxi, Inc., 393 S.C. 312, 324, 713 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2011) (\"A matter may not be\r\npresented for the first time on appeal; rather, it must have been both raised to and\r\nruled upon by the court below.\").\r\n\r\nAs to the evidentiary rulings Deborah challenges, we find no abuse of discretion in\r\nany of these rulings. See Fields v. Reg'l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 25,\r\n609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005) (stating a trial court's decision to exclude evidence will\r\nnot be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion). Additionally, Deborah's\r\nargument on appeal that the death certificate and coroner's report were admissible\r\nin their entirety under Rule 803(9), SCRE, is not preserved. See State v. Dunbar,\r\n356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694 (2003) (per curiam) (\"A party may not\r\nargue one ground at trial and an alternate ground on appeal.\").\r\n\r\nFinally, as to the denial of Deborah's motion for new trial, her argument on appeal\r\nregarding the thirteenth juror doctrine is not preserved. See Pikaart, 393 S.C. at\r\n\n324, 713 S.E.2d at 273.

Johnson appeal the Administrative Law\r\nCourt's (ALC) decision finding them in violation of section 12-21-4090(C) of\r\nthe South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) and fining Johnson $1,000. The\r\nappellants argue the ALC abused its discretion in reaching its decision. We\r\naffirm.1\r\n\r\n       We find the ALC did not abuse its discretion in finding American\r\nLegion and Johnson violated section 12-21-4090(C). The statute is clear in\r\nrequiring \"both the organization and promoter [to] deposit a loan equal to\r\nfifty percent of the deficit.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 12-21-4090(C) (Supp. 2011);\r\nsee also Kennedy v. S.C. Ret. Sys., 345 S.C. 339, 346, 549 S.E.2d 243, 246\r\n(2001) (\"The first question of statutory interpretation is whether the statute's\r\nmeaning is clear on its face. If a statute's language is plain and unambiguous,\r\nand conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing\r\nrules of statutory interpretation and the court has no right to look for or\r\nimpose another meaning.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Here, it was\r\nundisputed that Johnson alone made the deposits into the account. Also,\r\nevidence supports the ALC's determination that testimony about the\r\npurported loan between Johnson and American Legion lacks credibility.\r\nFurther, we find section 12-21-4090(C) is not unconstitutionally vague\r\nbecause \"men of common intelligence\" would not need to guess about what\r\nthe statute means or how to apply it. See Toussaint v. State Bd. of Med.\r\nExam'rs, 303 S.C. 316, 320, 400 S.E.2d 488, 491 (1991) (\"A law is\r\nunconstitutionally vague if it forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms\r\nso vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess as to its\r\nmeaning and differ as to its application.\").\r\n\r\n     We also find the ALC did not abuse its discretion in imposing a fine on\r\nJohnson. Contrary to Johnson's assertion, the ALC fined him $1,000, not\r\n$2,000. Because Johnson argues his fine should not exceed $1,500, this issue\r\nneeds no further consideration. Accordingly, the ALC's decision is\r\n\r\n\r\n1   We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-360","title":"Giove v.

DeWitt, of Law Office of Diane P. DeWitt, of\r\n            Beaufort, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n            Effie Mae Mitchell, pro se, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Christopher Mitchell (Husband) appeals the family court's\r\ndivorce decree, arguing the family court made a mathematical error in equitably\r\ndividing the marital property. Specifically, Husband asserts the family court erred\r\nin ordering him to pay Wife $160,133 \"to equalize the property division\" because\r\n\nthe actual result, wherein Wife received seventy percent of the marital estate, was\r\ninequitable. Husband also argues the family court erred in failing to apportion the\r\ndebt attached to a jointly held credit card. We affirm as modified.\r\n\r\n1. We find the family court made a mathematical error in its division of the marital\r\nestate. \"In appeals from the family court, [appellate courts] review[] factual and\r\nlegal issues de novo.\" Simmons v. Simmons, 392 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666,\r\n667 (2011). Nonetheless, \"de novo review neither relieves an appellant of\r\ndemonstrating error nor requires us to ignore the findings of the family court.\"\r\nLewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 388-89, 709 S.E.2d 650, 654 (2011). In equitably\r\ndistributing a marital estate, the family court must:\r\n\r\n             . . . (1) identify the marital property, both real and\r\n             personal, to be divided between the parties; (2) determine\r\n             the fair market value of the identified property; (3)\r\n             apportion the marital estate according to the\r\n             contributions, both direct and indirect, of each party to\r\n             the acquisition of the property during the marriage, their\r\n             respective assets and incomes, and any special equities\r\n             they may have in marital assets; and (4) provide for an\r\n             equitable division of the marital estate, including the\r\n             manner in which the distribution is to take place.\r\n\r\nGardner v. Gardner, 368 S.C. 134, 136, 628 S.E.2d 37, 38 (2006). The language\r\nof the order indicates the family court intended to divide the marital estate equally\r\nbetween Husband and Wife.1 We find the total value of the marital estate is\r\n$385,916.30. Half of the total value, and the total amount each party is entitled to\r\nreceive, is $192,958.15. Wife received $110,162 in marital property, which is\r\n$82,796.15 less than $192,958.15. Husband received $275,754.30 in marital\r\nproperty, which is $82,796.15 more than $192,958.15. If Husband pays Wife\r\n$82,796.15, the parties' shares will be equal: each party will receive exactly half\r\n\r\n1 To the extent Husband seeks an unequal apportionment of the marital estate, this\r\nissue is not preserved. \"To preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue cannot\r\nbe raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon\r\nby the [family] court.\" Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 212, 634 S.E.2d 51, 54 (Ct. App.\r\n2006). Moreover, Husband concludes in his brief that, alternatively, this court\r\nshould \"modify [t]he Final Decree of Divorce so as to equally divide the marital\r\nestate and credit card debt.\"\r\n\nthe total value of the marital estate. Accordingly, we reduce the lump sum\r\nHusband must pay Wife to $82,796.15 and order him to pay this amount to Wife\r\nwithin one hundred twenty days from the date this opinion. In addition, we strike\r\nthe separate award of $5,133 the family court imposed to balance the values of the\r\nparties' automobiles.\r\n\r\n2. We find the family court erred in failing to equitably apportion the Visa debt.\r\nAs a threshold matter, we find the Visa debt was marital in nature.\r\n\r\n             For purposes of equitable distribution, \"marital debt\" is\r\n             debt incurred for the joint benefit of the parties regardless\r\n             of whether the parties are legally jointly liable for the\r\n             debt or whether one party is legally individually liable.\r\n             The same rules of fairness and equity that apply to the\r\n             equitable distribution of marital property also apply to\r\n             the equitable division of marital debts.\r\n\r\nKing v. King, 384 S.C. 134, 143, 681 S.E.2d 609, 614 (Ct. App. 2009) (internal\r\ncitations and quotation marks omitted). Marital debt includes \"any other existing\r\ndebts incurred by the parties or either of them during the course of the marriage.\"\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-620(13) (Supp. 2011). This provision \"creates a\r\npresumption that all debts[,] regardless of who created them[,] are marital debts.\"\r\nHardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 437, 429 S.E.2d 811, 814 (Ct. App. 1993). The\r\nparty who claims a spouse's debt was not marital bears the burden of proving his\r\nassertion. Id. The March 8, 2006 bill for the Visa debt reflects an outstanding\r\nbalance of $2,497.08, as well as a monthly finance charge of $29.98, for a total of\r\n$2,542.06. The evidence in the record suggests one or both parties increased the\r\nbalance on the Visa debt in a short period of time but does not indicate which party\r\ndid so. Wife offered no proof beyond her own testimony that the Visa debt\r\nbelonged to Husband alone. No evidence suggests which party incurred the\r\ncharges or who benefited from them.\r\n\r\n3. We apportion the Visa debt equally between the parties, subject to the following\r\nterms. Although marital debt is part of the marital estate, we address the Visa debt\r\nseparately from the rest of the estate to avoid confusion. As of March 8, 2006,\r\nshortly before Husband filed for divorce, the total Visa debt was $2,542.06.\r\nDividing that amount equally between Husband and Wife, each party's share of the\r\ndebt is $1,271.03. However, at trial, the parties agreed Husband had made no\r\npayments toward the debt, while Wife had made payments that reduced the debt to\r\n\n$1,809.47. Based upon these facts, we find Wife made payments of at least\r\n$732.59 toward the Visa debt. We further find Husband allowed this joint debt to\r\nlanguish for three years during pendency of the suit while Wife attempted to pay it\r\ndown. As Husband observed in his motion for reconsideration, one result of the\r\nfailure to pay the Visa debt was the entry of a judgment against both parties. In\r\nview of our findings concerning the parties' payments toward this debt during the\r\npendency of their divorce action, we require Wife to pay the remaining $538.44 of\r\nher share of the debt as it existed at the time Husband filed suit. We require\r\nHusband to pay his full share, as well as any additional outstanding charges and\r\ninterest that may have been imposed in the interim. If Husband alone pays off the\r\nentire amount of the judgment relating to the Visa debt, he may deduct the $538.44\r\napportioned to Wife from the $82,796.15 he owes her.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the order of the family court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., SHORT, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-365","title":"King v.

Tyler, both of Sweeny,\r\n             Wingate & Barrow, PA, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Appellants appeal from an order of the special referee denying\r\ntheir counterclaim against Respondent for an accounting of the profits of King's\r\nFuneral Home. On appeal, Appellants argue (1) the circuit court's order of\r\nreference required the special referee to direct an accounting of King's Funeral\r\nHome; (2) the special referee should have estopped Patricia King from asserting an\r\naccounting was not proper; and (3) the record does not support the factual findings\r\nof the special referee. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1. As to Appellants' argument that the circuit court's order of reference required\r\nthe special referee to direct an accounting of King's Funeral Home, we find the\r\nissue of whether Appellants were entitled to an accounting was a new and separate\r\nmatter than the issue addressed in the order of reference of whether Patricia King\r\nwas entitled to an accounting. Furthermore, we find the order of reference is not\r\nreasonably susceptible to Appellants' interpretation as requiring the special referee\r\nto direct an accounting of King's Funeral Home. See Hailey v. Hailey, 357 S.C. 18,\r\n25, 590 S.E.2d 495, 498 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"As a general rule, judgments are to be\r\nconstrued like other written instruments.\" (internal quotation marks omitted));\r\nPetition of White, 299 S.C. 406, 412, 385 S.E.2d 211, 215 (Ct. App. 1989) (\"The\r\ndeterminative factor is the intent of the parties or the court, as gathered, not from\r\nan isolated part of the contract or judgment but from all its parts.\"); id. (providing\r\nif the language employed within a contract or judgment is plain and unambiguous,\r\nthere is no room for construction or interpretation and the effect thereof must be\r\ndeclared in light of the literal meaning of the language used).\r\n\r\n2. As to Appellants' argument that the special referee should have estopped\r\nPatricia King from asserting an accounting was not proper, we find the doctrine of\r\njudicial estoppel inapplicable because Patricia King did not take inconsistent\r\npositions in the same or related proceedings. See City of N. Myrtle Beach v. E.\r\nCherry Grove Realty Co., Op. No. 27113 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 11, 2012)\r\n(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 13 at 44, 52) (\"Judicial estoppel is an equitable concept\r\nthat prevents a litigant from asserting [a] position inconsistent with, or in conflict\r\nwith, one the litigant has previously asserted in the same or related proceeding.\"\r\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); id.

Hiester Constr. Co., 389\r\nS.C. 504, 519, 698 S.E.2d 822, 830 (Ct.

Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 215-16, 592 S.E.2d 629,\r\n632 (2004))).\r\n\r\n3. As to Appellants' argument that the record does not support the factual findings\r\nof the special referee, we find Appellants are not entitled to an accounting because\r\nthe preponderance of evidence supports the special referee's findings that the\r\nfuneral home business operated by Patricia King is a new and separate business\r\nentity from the funeral home business operated by Chris King, and no fiduciary\r\nrelationship exists between Appellants and Patricia King. See Consignment Sales,\r\nLLC v. Tucker Oil Co., 391 S.C. 266, 272, 705 S.E.2d 73, 76-77 (Ct.

We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities:\r\n\r\nWe find the master did not err in holding Funny failed to establish the Property\r\nwas the land conveyed to Nancy Funny in the 1910 deed. See Hoogenboom v. City\r\nof Beaufort, 315 S.C. 306, 313, 433 S.E.2d 875, 880 (Ct.

We\r\n\nfind that when Hughes presented her checks to the Bank, it had the option under its\r\ndisclosure agreement to use any funds that Hughes had on deposit with the Bank to\r\nsetoff against the debt and pay the checks. We affirm.\r\n\r\nAs to Hughes's argument that the trial court erred concerning the Bank's right of\r\nsetoff, we find the Bank had a right of setoff against Hughes's certificates of\r\ndeposit to pay the checks presented. \"If the depositor is indebted to the bank, the\r\nbank has the right to offset the indebtedness by the deposit . . . .\" Lee v. Marion\r\nNat'l Bank, 167 S.C. 168, 200, 166 S.E. 148, 160 (1932). The agreement states\r\nthat the Bank may offset funds from any or all accounts that the depositor has with\r\nthe Bank.\r\n\r\nAs to Hughes's argument that the Bank transferred her funds before the overdraft\r\nwas posted, we find that the order of posting did not affect the Bank's right of\r\nsetoff. The agreement states that the Bank \"may determine in our discretion the\r\norder that we process and post credits, debits, and holds to your account. We may\r\ncredit, authorize, accept, pay, . . . in any order at our option.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where the contract's language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone\r\ndetermines the contract's force and effect.\" McGill v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     As to Williams's breach of contract action, we find the trial court did not err\r\nin granting summary judgment on this issue because Williams's employment was\r\nat-will. See Mathis v. Brown & Brown of S.C., Inc., 389 S.C. 299, 309, 698 S.E.2d\r\n773, 778 (2010) (\"In South Carolina, employment at-will is presumed absent the\r\ncreation of a specific contract of employment.\"); id. at 310, 698 S.E.2d at 778\r\n(emphasis added) (\"An at-will employee may be terminated at any time for any\r\nreason or for no reason, with or without cause.); White v.

Florian, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\n       PER CURIAM: Cornelius Barton appeals the Administrative Law\r\nCourt's (ALC) dismissal of his inmate disciplinary action, arguing the ALC\r\nerred in using a facially unconstitutional statute to dismiss his appeal, and the\r\nDepartment of Corrections (the Department) denied him due process in\r\nfailing to provide him a written notice of his charges. We affirm1 pursuant to\r\nRule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n      1.    As to whether the ALC erred in dismissing Barton's appeal: Rule\r\n220(c), SCACR (\"The appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision\r\nor judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.\");\r\nSlezak v.

As to whether the Department denied Barton due process in\r\nfailing to provide him a written notice of his charges: S.C. Code Ann. § 1-\r\n23-610(B) (Supp. 2011) (explaining that an appellate court may only reverse\r\na decision of the ALC if the substantive rights of the appellant have been\r\nprejudiced).\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 Barton's conviction and resulting punishment did not involve the loss of\r\naccrued good time credits or the opportunity to earn good time credits.\r\nTherefore, the ALC was permitted to hear the appeal and erred in basing the\r\ndecision to dismiss on section 1-23-600(D) of the South Carolina Code\r\n(Supp. 2011). However, because no liberty interest was implicated by\r\nBarton's appeal, the ALC was not required to hold a hearing and did not\r\nabuse its discretion in summarily dismissing the appeal. See Sullivan v. S.C.\r\nDep't of Corr., 355 S.C. 437, 445 n.5, 586 S.E.2d 124, 128 n.5 (2003)\r\n(recognizing that a condition of confinement could implicate a state-created\r\nliberty interest but holding that \"these interests will generally be limited to\r\nfreedom from restraint which imposes atypical or significant hardship on the\r\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life\" (internal quotation\r\nmarks and alterations omitted)); see also Skipper v.

Ronald Stanley, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Kirk Thomson and Christine Thomson sued Charles Woods and\r\nAngie Woods, seeking specific performance of a real estate sales contract or, in the\r\n\nalternative, damages for breach of contract. The trial judge heard the matter and\r\nissued an order finding in favor of the Woods. The Thomsons appeal. We affirm.\r\n\r\nThe Woods contracted to purchase the Thomsons' home for $1,400,000, including\r\nan earnest money payment of $50,000. The contract specifically noted the Woods\r\nwould pay cash and no financing was required. Although the Thomsons were\r\nready, willing, and able to perform, the Woods never paid the earnest money and\r\nultimately refused to buy the house.\r\n\r\nThe Thomsons filed this action for specific performance of the contract. In the\r\nalternative, they requested damages for breach of contract, including prejudgment\r\ninterest and attorney's fees. Following a nonjury hearing, the trial judge granted\r\njudgment to the Woods on both causes of action, ruling (1) the contract was\r\nunenforceable for lack of valuable consideration, (2) the Thomsons were precluded\r\nfrom specific performance because they had a remedy at law, (3) the Thomsons did\r\nnot prove their damages on their breach of contract claim, and (4) the Thomsons\r\ncould not recover real estate taxes and homeowners' association dues because they\r\ndid not allege entitlement to special damages in their pleadings. The Thomsons\r\nthen filed this appeal.\r\n\r\n1. The Thomsons argue the trial judge erred in denying their request for specific\r\nperformance, asserting they met the prerequisites for this relief and taking issue\r\nwith the trial judge's determination that they had an adequate legal remedy. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nThe only reason given in the appealed order for denying specific performance to\r\nthe Thomsons was the availability of an adequate remedy at law. In response to\r\nthis ruling, the Thomsons argue that the trial judge's finding that they failed to\r\nprove their damages on their breach of contract claim amounted to proof that they\r\nhad to resort to equitable relief. To the contrary, however, \"[i]n an action for\r\nbreach of a contract to purchase real estate, general damages may be measured by\r\nthe difference between the contract price and the fair market value of the property\r\nat the time of the breach. Bannon v. Knauss, 282 S.C. 589, 593, 320 S.E.2d 470,\r\n472 (Ct. App. 1984). Here, the Thomsons could have presented an appraisal or\r\nother evidence of the fair market value of their home at the time they learned the\r\n\nWoods did not intend to close on the purchase.1 Their failure to present such\r\nevidence does not entitle them to a finding that they have no adequate remedy at\r\nlaw. Cf. Nutt Corp. v. Howell Road, LLC, 396 S.C. 323, 329-30, 721 S.E.2d 447,\r\n450-51 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating the possibility that the statute of limitations may\r\nhave barred a legal remedy to the plaintiff was not a ground in itself on which to\r\ngrant an equitable remedy and citing authority from other jurisdictions that a\r\nplaintiff who failed to pursue an available legal remedy in a responsible manner is\r\nnot entitled to equitable relief).\r\n\r\n2. The Thomsons next argue the trial judge, in violation of the parol evidence rule,\r\nerred in admitting testimony from the Woods about their inability to obtain the\r\nnecessary funds for the purchase of the home. They also contend the evidence was\r\nirrelevant because there was no financing contingency in the contract. We reject\r\nthese arguments. When the Thomsons' attorney objected to this testimony, both\r\nthe trial judge and counsel for the Woods agreed the presentation was only a\r\nproffer \"for whatever probative value it may have.\" There is no mention of the\r\nWoods' financial circumstances in the appealed order, which indicates the trial\r\njudge, then, either chose to reject the proffered testimony or found it was not\r\nrelevant to his disposition of the matter. The Thomsons, then, have failed to show\r\nthey were prejudiced by the disputed testimony. See Campbell v. Jordan, 382 S.C.\r\n445, 453, 675 S.E.2d 801, 805 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"To warrant a reversal based on\r\nthe admission of evidence, the appellant must show both error and resulting\r\nprejudice.\").\r\n\r\n3. The Thomsons also challenge the ruling that they were not entitled to recover\r\nhomeowner association dues, real estate taxes, and attorney's fees. We find no\r\nerror. As we have previously noted, general damages in an action for breach of a\r\ncontract to purchase real estate are measured by the difference between the contract\r\nprice and the fair market value of the property at the time of the breach. The trial\r\njudge, then, correctly ruled that association dues and taxes were special damages\r\nthat needed to be \"particularly alleged and proved.\" Kline Iron & Steel Co. v.\r\n\r\n1Although the Thomsons were competent to testify about the value of their\r\nproperty, they testified only about their revised asking price and the price they\r\nwould accept for their home.\r\n\nSuperior Trucking Co., 261 S.C. 542, 547, 201 S.E.2d 388, 390 (1973). Nowhere\r\nin their complaint did the Thomsons assert a claim for homeowner association dues\r\nor real estate taxes. Furthermore, although the sales contract provided for\r\nattorney's fees and costs in the event of a breach and the Thomsons requested\r\nattorney's fees in their prayer for relief, the trial judge did not rule on this issue and\r\nthe Thomsons made no post-trial motion to have their request for attorney's fees\r\nand costs addressed. See Talley v. S.C. Higher Educ. Grants Comm., 289 S.C. 483,\r\n487, 347 S.E.2d 99, 101 (1986) (holding an issue that was raised below but not\r\nruled upon by the trial judge was not preserved for appeal because the appellant\r\ndid not move before the lower court to amend the judgment).\r\n\r\n4. Finally, we agree with the Thomsons that the trial judge erred in holding the\r\ncontract was unenforceable for lack of consideration based on (1) the undisputed\r\nfact that the Woods never made the earnest money deposit and (2) the Thomsons'\r\nfailure to show any forbearance, detriment, or loss or responsibility given, suffered,\r\nor undertaken on their part. Here, the Thomsons agreed to sell their home to the\r\nWoods at a negotiated price. Such an agreement amounted to a bilateral contract,\r\nwhich \"exists when both parties exchange mutual promises.\" Sauner v. Pub. Serv.\r\nAuth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 405, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003); see also Rickborn v.\r\nLiberty Life Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 291, 304, 468 S.E.2d 292, 300 (1996)\r\n(acknowledging \"there was a meeting of minds, and the exchange of promises\r\nqualified as consideration\"). Because, however, the Thomsons did not prove their\r\ndamages for breach of contract and have not presented an argument on appeal that\r\nwould adequately support their entitlement to specific performance, we affirm the\r\naward of judgment to the Woods.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n      WILLIAMS, THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-381","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n\nFACTS\r\n\r\nAfter the previous owner of real property (the Property) defaulted on a mortgage\r\nloan and failed to pay property taxes, the lender and the Horry County Delinquent\r\nTax Collector (Tax Collector) commenced separate collection proceedings. In\r\nNovember of 2003 Gary Player, a/k/a Gerald Player, purchased the Property at a\r\ntax sale. Three months later, Ronald Fitzjohn purchased the Property from the\r\nlender following a foreclosure sale.\r\n\r\nFive years after the tax sale, Fitzjohn filed an action against Player to set aside the\r\ntax sale for alleged defects in the tax sale proceedings. On March 20, 2009, the\r\ncircuit court dismissed the complaint. Fitzjohn did not appeal the dismissal.\r\nInstead, on April 14, 2009, Fitzjohn filed a \"Motion to Alter or Amend,\" citing to\r\nRule 60, SCRCP.1 In his motion, Fitzjohn renewed his objection to the circuit\r\ncourt's decision to convert Player's motion to dismiss to a motion for summary\r\njudgment. He also argued the circuit court erred in applying section 12-51-90(C)\r\nto the facts of his case, because the two-year statute of limitations would have\r\nexpired in November 2005, prior to the enactment of section 12-51-90(C) in 2006.\r\nOn July 9, 2009, the circuit court found Fitzjohn properly brought his motion under\r\nRule 60(b). Nonetheless, the circuit court denied relief because the motion \"failed\r\nto state any claim for relief pursuant to Rule 60.\" As to the retroactive application\r\nof section 12-51-90(C), the circuit court found that the adoption of section 12-51-\r\n90(C) did not modify and, in fact, was consistent with the existing two-year statute\r\nof limitations as set forth in section 12-51-160.\r\n\r\nOn August 3, 2009, Fitzjohn filed his Notice of Appeal from the July 9, 2009\r\norder. His sole issue on appeal is whether the circuit court erred in \"holding that\r\nthe two year statute of limitations period under S.C. Code Ann. § 12-51-160(C)\r\n[sic] and S.C. Code Ann. § 12-51-90(C) acted to bar the Fitzjohn action where the\r\ntrue owner was not named in the tax sale action.\" His arguments under that issue\r\npoint to purported defects in the tax sale proceedings. According to Fitzjohn, the\r\nTax Collector's failure to notify remainderman Terry Andrew Lewis of the tax sale\r\nrendered Player's tax title to the Property void.\r\n\r\n1 Motions to alter or amend typically fall under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, and must be\r\nfiled within ten days from the date the movant receives notice of the judgment.\r\nMotions pursuant to Rule 60, which are subject to less stringent filing deadlines,\r\nare usually designated as motions for relief from judgment.\r\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"Whether to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound\r\ndiscretion\" of the circuit court. Raby Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 17-18,\r\n594 S.E.2d 478, 482 (2004). An appellate court reviews such a decision for an\r\nabuse of discretion. Id. at 18, 594 S.E.2d at 482.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWe affirm because Fitzjohn's arguments on appeal are not properly before this\r\ncourt. A trial court's finding that a motion is made under Rule 60(b) becomes the\r\nlaw of the case if not appealed. Williams v. Watkins, 384 S.C. 319, 323 n.2, 681\r\nS.E.2d 914, 916 n.2 (Ct. App. 2009). The law is clear that the filing of a Rule 60\r\nmotion does not stay the time for filing an appeal. Stearns Bank Nat'l Ass'n v.\r\nGlenwood Falls, LP, 375 S.C. 423, 426, 653 S.E.2d 274, 275 (2007); see also\r\nWilliams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 251, 553 S.E.2d 496, 509 (Ct. App. 2001)\r\n(Shuler, J., dissenting) (recognizing \"motions made pursuant to Rule 60, SCRCP\r\ndo not affect the finality of the judgment under attack and thus do not toll the time\r\nfor appeal\").\r\n\r\nFitzjohn did not appeal the March 20, 2009 order, which decided the issue of\r\nalleged defects in the tax sale proceedings. Accordingly, that order is now the law\r\nof the case. See Williams, 384 S.C. at 323 n.2, 681 S.E.2d at 916 n.2. Moreover,\r\nalthough Fitzjohn timely appealed the July 9, 2009 order, his argument on appeal\r\ndoes not challenge the findings of fact or conclusions of law contained within that\r\norder.2 As a result, that order, too, is the law of the case. See Judy v. Martin, 381\r\nS.C. 455, 458-59, 674 S.E.2d 151, 153 (2009) (holding an unappealed ruling is the\r\nlaw of the case and may not be reviewed on appeal).\r\n\r\nThe sole error Fitzjohn argues in this appeal is that the circuit court erred in failing\r\nto find the tax sale was defective and the tax deed void because the Tax Collector\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2Although Fitzjohn included a copy of the formal order with his Notice of Appeal,\r\nonly the Form 4 order reflecting the denial of his motion appears in the record on\r\nappeal.\r\n\nfailed to give proper notice to the remainderman.3 This ruling is contained in the\r\nMarch 20, 2009 order and, therefore, is not properly before this court on appeal.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., THOMAS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Without ruling on the merits of Fitzjohn's argument, we observe South Carolina\r\nlaw permits taxes to be assessed only against the current possessory interest. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. §§ 12-37-610, -740(1) (2000 & Supp. 2011); see also Stamper v.

We affirm as modified in\r\npart.                               FACTS\r\n\r\n       In 1987, six individuals formed a general partnership (Partnership)1 for\r\nthe purpose of purchasing property to operate motels. The partners entered\r\ninto a signed partnership agreement in 1989.\r\n\r\n      Partnership's main function was the operation of two hotels, Bon Villa\r\nand Queens Inn Motel. At formation, Partnership held an interest in several\r\nreal properties: (1) a leasehold interest in lots 3 and 4, Block 15, Hotel\r\nSection of Myrtle Beach, where Bona Villa was located; (2) a leasehold\r\ninterest in lots 5 and 6, Block 2, Hotel Section of Myrtle Beach, where\r\nQueens Inn Motel was located; and (3) a fee simple interest in lot 9, Block\r\n19, Hotel Section of Myrtle Beach, which was used as a parking lot for Bon\r\nVilla. Currently, Partnership's assets include (1) a fee title to lot 9, Block 19,\r\nHotel Section and (2) a leasehold interest in lots 3 and 4, Block 15, Hotel\r\nSection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1Partnership has been called at various times Coral Seas, Bon Villa, and\r\nQueens Inn Motel Partnership.\r\n\n      The parties have presented the court with extensive legal arguments\r\nand factual information regarding the relationships between the partners and\r\nPartnership's prior complex litigation. The parties involved include: (1)\r\nJariam Nandwani (John), an original member of Partnership who died in\r\n1990; (2) Kenny and Sammy, John's sons who operate J's, LLC and JNV,\r\nLLC; (3) Chanderlal Navlani, an original member of Partnership who died\r\nDecember 19, 2004, in India, survived by his wife, Geeta, and two children,\r\nKumari Navlani and Jitender Navlani; (4) Respondent, an original member of\r\nPartnership; and (5) Ernest Rabon, the accountant for Partnership since 1989.\r\n\r\n      Partnership had very little structure. The hotel operations were\r\nmanaged by a managing partner, who made both the governance and day-to-\r\nday decisions for Partnership. No partnership meetings were held; however,\r\neach partner had access to Partnership's books and records maintained by the\r\naccountant. Partnership has had three managing partners since its inception:\r\n(1) Vishu T. Bhambhani from 1988 to 1991; (2) Respondent from 1991 to\r\nAugust 1996; and (3) Chanderlal Navlani from August 1996 to October 1999,\r\nwhen he left the United States for India. No partner took over as the\r\nmanaging partner following Navlani's departure to India, nor did any partner\r\ndirect the hotel operations or management of Partnership's real property\r\ninterest. The current members and their respective interests are as follows:\r\nKenny (8.75%), Sammy (8.75%), Respondent (15%), Jitender Navlani\r\n(10%), Geeta Navlani (20%), Rita N. Lilani (10%), Manu and Haroo\r\nManglani (17.5%), Ashok Dawani (5%), and Bhaju Ahuja (5%).2\r\n\r\n      This action was commenced October 13, 2000, by Appellants to collect\r\non two promissory notes. The complaint was twice amended prior to trial,\r\nadding two limited liability companies owned by Appellants, along with\r\nadded claims for dissolution of Partnership and for rent due from Partnership.\r\nIn response, Respondent, individually and as a partner of Partnership, filed a\r\nsecond amended answer, amended counterclaim, and amended third-party\r\ncomplaint with defenses and claims against Appellants, Partnership, and the\r\n\r\n2 The original partners and respective interests were Vishu T. Bhambhani\r\n(15%), John (20%), Chanderlal Navalani (25%), Respondent (15%), Ashok\r\nDawani (5%), and Bhagu Ahuja (5%).\r\n\nindividual partners. The action was referred by consent to a master-in-equity\r\nAugust 12, 2002, and later referred to the special referee August 25, 2009.\r\n\r\n       The special referee issued an order ending the action, dissolving\r\nPartnership, and selling Partnership's property. Both Appellants and\r\nRespondents filed Rule 52 and Rule 59, SCRCP motions for amendment or\r\nalteration to the final order. Motions were heard and the special referee\r\nissued two supplemental orders. The final order and supplemental orders\r\nmade the following rulings: (1) Appellants' claim for collection on the\r\n$50,000 Nandwani note was barred by the statute of limitations; (2)\r\nAppellants' claim for collection on the $160,000 Nandwani note and\r\nmortgage was granted, but in a reduced amount; (3) claims for unpaid rent\r\nagainst Partnership were barred by the statute of limitations; (4) Partnership\r\nshould be dissolved; (5) Respondent's claim for collection on the $133,000\r\nNavlani Note and mortgage was granted; (6) Respondents claim for\r\ncollection of $60,000 on an assignment was granted; and (7) Partnership was\r\ngranted judgment against Appellants for breach of fiduciary duty in the\r\namount of $631,838. This appeal followed and involves four promissory\r\nnotes issued by Partnership, prior litigation between Appellants and\r\nRespondent, and the purchase of lots 3 and 4.\r\n\r\n     I.    Promissory Notes\r\n\r\n      To fund its business ventures, Partnership borrowed money from\r\nseveral partners, who provided promissory notes as a form of guarantee. The\r\nnotes include two notes belonging to John (Nandwani notes), and two\r\nbelonging to Navlani (Navlani notes). Both men are now deceased. The\r\nspecial referee considered the validity of these notes and the right of the\r\nparties to collect on these notes.\r\n\r\n     The partnership agreement states:\r\n\r\n                   The undersigned parties shall contribute in\r\n           percentage of their ownership above [the percentages\r\n           listed in footnote 3] in any additional capital that they\r\n           may deem to be necessary for the operation of the\r\n\n           Partnership. Any such contribution of additional\r\n           capital will be first agreed upon by majority of the\r\n           Partners.\r\n\r\n                 Each Partner agrees to make such loans to the\r\n           PARTNERSHIP in an amount determined by\r\n           applying his percentage ownership interest in the\r\n           PARTNERSHIP to the total additional loan required.\r\n\r\n      Additionally, the partnership agreement states \"heirs of a deceased\r\nPartner may succeed to the deceased Partner's interest and continue as\r\nPartners in the Partnership.\"\r\n\r\n           A.    Nandwani Notes\r\n\r\n      On December 25, 1987, Partnership executed and delivered a\r\npromissory note made payable to Ashok T. Bhambhani for $160,000. The\r\nnote was secured by a mortgage on Partnership's interest in all of its real\r\nproperty. The note was personally guaranteed by Respondent, John, Navlani,\r\nAshok Dawani, and Bhaug Ahugja. On May 19, 1988, Ashok T. Bhambhani\r\nassigned the note and the mortgage to John. In April 1989, John assigned\r\n$60,000 of the note to Navlani.\r\n\r\n      In April of 1989, Partnership executed and delivered a promissory note\r\nto John for $50,000. The note was secured by a mortgage and personally\r\nguaranteed by Respondent, Navlani, Manu Manglani, and Ashok Dawani.\r\nJohn died in 1990 and was survived by his wife and Appellants.\r\n\r\n      Appellants discovered the $160,000 note and a copy of the $50,000\r\nnote following the probating of John's estate in 1990, which was handled by\r\nthe New York superior court. John's estate was re-opened by Kenny, as\r\nadministrator, and the estate assigned both notes to John's wife, Kenny, and\r\nSammy on July 18, 2005. The wife then assigned her interest in the notes to\r\nKenny and Sammy in a subsequent transaction on the same day.\r\n\n            B.    Navlani Notes\r\n\r\n      On December 25, 1987, Partnership issued a promissory note for\r\n$133,000 to Ashok T. Bhambhani. The note was secured by a mortgage on\r\nPartnership's interest in all real property. On May 19, 1988, Ashok T.\r\nBhambhani assigned the note and mortgage to Navlani. In April of 1989,\r\nPartnership issued a promissory note for $47,000 to Navlani secured by a\r\nmortgage. The note was guaranteed by five members of Partnership,\r\nincluding Respondent and John.\r\n\r\n      Navlani died in India on December 19, 2004, and was survived by his\r\nwife and two children. Navlani's will devised his entire estate to his wife and\r\nchildren. An application for informal probate was filled out on May 22,\r\n2008, in Horry County, but was never filed with the probate court. Navlani's\r\nheirs assigned their interests in both notes to Respondent on December 31,\r\n2004.       C. Special Referee's Findings on the Notes\r\n\r\n      Both Appellants and Respondent sought a determination from the\r\nspecial referee of their rights to enforce and collect on the notes. Appellants\r\nargued for full payment of both Nandwani notes. Respondent, individually,\r\nasserted a right to both Navlani notes and the $60,000 assignment of the\r\n$160,000 Nandwani note.\r\n\r\n      In regards to the Nandwani notes, the validity of the assignment of the\r\nnotes by the estate to Appellants was not contested by Respondent at trial.\r\nSammy testified he informed Navlani, in his capacity as managing partner,\r\nabout the two notes. Sammy further stated Navlani told him both notes were\r\nvalid and payable. Kenny testified that on June 1, 1999, Partnership made a\r\npartial payment on both of the Nandwani notes by Partnership check. The\r\ncheck was made payable to Kenny in the amount of $6,000.3 Respondent\r\n\r\n3 The check was signed by Navlani and the subject line of the check stated\r\n\"principal plus interest 456[,]395-6,000= 450,395 Balance.\" Appellants\r\npresented a handwriting expert who confirmed the check was written by\r\nNavlani.\r\n\nobjected to the testimony regarding statements Navlani made to Sammy, on\r\nground that the testimony violated the Dead Man Statute. The special referee\r\ndid not consider the testimony regarding communication between the two in\r\nhis decisions.\r\n\r\n      The special referee determined (1) the collection claims for the $50,000\r\nNandwani note and the $47,000 Navlani Note were both barred by the statute\r\nof limitations and (2) the $160,000 Nandwani note and the $133,000 Navlani\r\nnote are Partnership debts. In an amended order, the special referee found\r\nRespondent was entitled to the $60,000 assignment of the $160,000\r\nNandwani note.\r\n\r\n     II.   Prior Litigation\r\n\r\n      In 1996, members of Partnership sued Respondent for breaching his\r\nfiduciary duties to partners by misappropriating funds and improperly\r\nutilizing Partnership assets. The master ruled Partnership was entitled to\r\nreimbursement of $447,909 and dismissed the action for breach of fiduciary\r\nduty and civil conspiracy with prejudice based on a failure of proof. This\r\ncourt in Navlani v. Bhambhani, Op. No. 2000-UP-384 (Ct. App. filed May\r\n30, 2000), affirmed the master.\r\n\r\n     In 1999, JVN, Inc. sued Partnership to collect on promissory notes\r\nissued by Partnership to JVN. Respondent, as an individual and on behalf of\r\nPartnership, filed counterclaims and a third-party complaint alleging\r\nmismanagement by Navlani, as managing partner. The master-in-equity\r\nfound Navlani breached his fiduciary duty as a result of his acts and\r\nomissions while serving as managing partner.          The master's order\r\nincorporated a settlement agreement between Appellants and Respondent for\r\nissues arising from the business relationship between JVN, Inc. and\r\nRespondent.\r\n\r\n     The special referee determined matters unknown to Respondent during\r\nthe previous lawsuits, partnership assets, and ownership interests of\r\nindividual partners were matters specifically reserved for a latter hearing.\r\n\nThe special referee also found Respondent's allegations against Appellants\r\nfor breach of fiduciary duty were not barred in this case.\r\n\r\n     III. Purchase of Lots 3 and 4\r\n\r\n     Partnership held a leasehold interest on lots 3 and 4, on Block 15 of\r\nHotel Section in Myrtle Beach, where it operated Bon Villa. Partnership\r\nbegan leasing the property on September 30, 1988, from Billy and Bonita\r\nSmith. In the late 1990s, the property went into receivership because\r\nPartnership was not paying the property taxes, as required under the lease\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\n     In 1998, the Smiths offered to sell the lots to Partnership, but\r\nPartnership was unable to purchase the property because of financial reasons.\r\nThe Smiths then offered to sell the lots to Appellants. Sammy testified\r\nNavlani was aware of the offer made to Appellants. He also testified no other\r\npartner was informed of the offer, including Respondent who resided within\r\nminutes of Sammy's home. On June 2, 1999, Appellants, acting on behalf of\r\nJ's LLC, purchased the fee title to lots 3 and 4 for $800,000. Upon the\r\npurchase of the land, J's LLC became the landlord for Partnership, pursuant\r\nto Partnership's lease agreement with the Smiths.\r\n\r\n     In February of 2000, J's LLC commenced an eviction action against\r\nPartnership for the failure to pay the 1999 property taxes, pursuant to the\r\nleasehold agreement. The eviction notice was mailed by certified mail to\r\nManu Manglani, a general partner of Partnership, at his last known address in\r\nNew York. A copy of the return receipt was signed and returned by\r\nManglani. At trial, Manglani denied signing the return, but confirmed he\r\nowns the apartment located at the address where the letter was mailed and has\r\npreviously received mail at the address.4 Additionally, he admitted his\r\ntenants have previously forwarded him mail delivered to the apartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4At trial, Manglani denied ever receiving any mail for Partnership purposes.\r\nHe said the accountant would fax any documents concerning Partnership.\r\n\nAppellants contend service was also made by posting notice at Bon Villa and\r\nthrough publication in the Myrtle Beach Herald in Horry County.5\r\n\r\n     No one appeared on behalf of Partnership at the eviction hearing, and\r\nthe magistrate issued a warrant of ejection against Partnership on March 13,\r\n2000. Following the eviction, Appellants demolished Bon Villa. Respondents\r\nasserted a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against Appellants for their (1)\r\ninvolvement in the acquisition of the fee title to the real property upon which\r\nPartnership assets were situated, (2) ejectment suit against Partnership, (3)\r\ndemolition of Partnership's building, and (4) self-dealing with regard to the\r\nnonpayment of taxes on Partnership's property.\r\n\r\n     The special referee determined Appellants breached their fiduciary duty.\r\nThe special referee ordered a judgment in the amount of $631,838, the last\r\nrecorded value of Bon Villa, be made in favor of Partnership against\r\nAppellants for breach of fiduciary duty.6 This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                                  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      I.    Notes\r\n\r\n            A.      Dead Man's Statute\r\n\r\n      Appellants maintain the Dead Man's Statute is not applicable because\r\nPartnership and Respondent, the parties against whom Navlani's statements\r\nwere being asserted, were not defending the action as Navalni's \"executor,\r\nadministrator, heir-at-law, next of kin, assignee, legatee, devisee[,] or\r\nsurvivor.\" In the alternative, Appellants contend Respondent opened the door\r\nto Sammy's testimony about Navalni by not objecting to the admission of\r\nother evidence barred by the Dead Man's Statute. We disagree.\r\n\r\n5 The special referee made the factual determination that no evidence showed\r\na notice was placed at Bon Villa.\r\n6 In the first two orders, the special referee directed lots 3 and 4 be transferred\r\nor conveyed to Partnership. He later vacated that finding on \"the basis that\r\nnot all parties with interest in said lots were made parties to the action.\"\r\n\n      In reviewing the admission or exclusion of evidence, the trial court's\r\nruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.\r\nHofer v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. 503, 513, 381 S.E.2d 736, 742 (1989). \"An abuse\r\nof discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual\r\nconclusion without evidentiary support.\" Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363\r\nS.C. 460, 467, 611 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2005). \"To warrant reversal based on\r\nthe admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the\r\nerror of the ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable\r\nprobability the jury's verdict was influenced by the wrongly admitted or\r\nexcluded evidence.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      The South Carolina Dead Man's Statute, section 19-11-20 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (1985), provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n                 [N]o party to an action or proceeding, no\r\n           person who has a legal or equitable interest which\r\n           may be affected by the event of the action or\r\n           proceeding, no person who, previous to such\r\n           examination, has had such an interest, however the\r\n           same may have been transferred or come to the party\r\n           to the action or proceeding, and no assignor of\r\n           anything in controversy in the action shall be\r\n           examined in regard to any transaction or\r\n           communication between such witness and a person at\r\n           the time of such examination deceased, insane or\r\n           lunatic as a witness against a party then prosecuting\r\n           or defending the action as executor, administrator,\r\n           heir-at-law, next of kin, assignee, legatee, devisee or\r\n           survivor of such deceased person or as assignee or\r\n           committee of such insane person or lunatic, when\r\n           such examination or any judgment or determination\r\n           in such action or proceeding can in any manner affect\r\n           the interest of such witness or the interest previously\r\n           owned or represented by him . . . .\r\n\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       The statute \"prohibits any interested person from testifying concerning\r\nconversations or transactions with the decedent if the testimony could affect\r\nhis or her interest.\" Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 151, 485 S.E.2d 903,\r\n909 (1997). This statute is viewed as the exception to the general rule on\r\nwitness competency and has been found to require a restrictive reading on\r\nwhich the party requesting its use bear the burden. Id.\r\n\r\n      The special referee properly determined Appellants' testimony\r\nconcerning their conversations with Navlani were not admissible under the\r\nDead Man's Statute. Navlani's heirs were parties to the case and hold a\r\npartnership interest in Partnership. As heirs, they have a present and vested\r\ninterest in the $50,000 Nandwani note and the determination of whether they\r\nbreached their fiduciary duty to Partnership. In regards to the Respondent, it\r\nis well established that an \"assignee . . . stands in the shoes of its assignor . . .\r\n.\" Singletary v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 316 S.C. 199, 201, 447 S.E.2d 869,\r\n870 (Ct. App. 1994). Thus, it was proper for the special referee to disregard\r\nthe communications under the Dead Man's Statute.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, Respondent did not open the door to this testimony by\r\nfailing to object to other evidence. From a plain reading of the statute, the\r\nopen door exception is triggered when a party admits evidence first, thereby\r\nallowing the subject matter into the trial. Hanahan, 326 S.C. at 151, 485\r\nS.E.2d at 908. However, a party's failure to make a Dead Man's Statute\r\nobjection to other evidence his opponent admits does not fall within that\r\nexception. Accordingly, we affirm the special referee's decision.\r\n\r\n             B.    Statute of Limitations\r\n\r\n      Appellants contend the statute of limitations does bar their collection\r\nclaim to the $50,000 Nandwani note because of partial payment made in June\r\n1999. We disagree.\r\n\n      Generally, an action to enforce the obligation to pay must be\r\ncommenced within three years. S.C. Code Ann. § 15-3-530 (2005).7\r\nHowever, if payment is made towards the note after the applicable limitations\r\nhas passed, the cause of action to enforce payment on a note begins to accrue\r\nagain. Wolfe v. Brannon, 211 S.C. 282, 286, 44 S.E.2d 833, 835 (1947).\r\nNote 2 of section15-3-530 states \"[p]atrial payment on a note within the\r\n[three-year] period immediately preceding the bringing of an action therein\r\nwill remove the bar of the statute.\" (citing Zaks v. Elliot, 106 F.2d 425, 427\r\n(1939)). A cause of action against the obligor accrues upon demand. Section\r\n36-3-122 of the South Carolina Code (2003)8.\r\n\r\n       Appellants presented (1) a copy of the $50,000 note, (2) Navlani's\r\nledger entries, (3) Sammy's testimony of Partnership's partial payment, (4) a\r\ncopy of a $6,000 check from Partnership's account dated June 2, 1999, and\r\n(5) a handwriting expert to testify to Navlani's signature. At trial, Partnership\r\nand Respondent's arguments relied heavily on the fact the accounts did not\r\nshow a debt for the $50,000 note and that Rabon was not aware of the $6,000\r\npayment being made.\r\n\r\n      The promissory note was signed in April 1989 and the $6,000 check\r\nwas written on June 1, 1999. The special referee found Rabon's lack of\r\nknowledge of the check being written as a significant factor in deciding this\r\nissue. Rabon testified he had access to Partnership's bank accounts and tax\r\nreturns to provide accounting services to Partnership, yet he did not know\r\nabout the promissory note or the check. Rabon stated he monitored and\r\nmaintained Partnership's accounts for tax returns based on whichever partner\r\nbrought the books and records to him. Navlani was the partner providing the\r\nrecords to Rabon during this time period.\r\n\r\n7 §15-3-530 was amended in 1988 to reduce the limitations period from six to \n\r\nthree years. . \n\r\n8 Section 36-3-118 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) was amended in \n\r\n2008 to affirmatively state the scope of Article 3 of the commercial code,\n\r\nincluding the statute of limitations. 2008 South Carolina Laws Act 204 (S.B. \n\r\n936) Official Comment 1. At the commencement of this action section 15-3-\r\n530 provided the statute of limitations for both secured and unsecured notes.\n\r\n\n      The special referee was presented with contradictory evidence from\r\nboth parties. Under our scope of review, this court \"must affirm the special\r\nreferee's factual findings, unless there is no evidence that reasonably supports\r\nthose findings.\" Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773\r\n(Ct. App. 1997). The special referee found no documented payments were\r\nmade on the note, as the note did not appear on the accounts as debts or\r\nmoney paid or owed by Partnership, and the accountant was not aware of the\r\ndebt. Therefore, we affirm, relying on the special referee and his advantage\r\nto make credibility determinations of the witnesses before him.\r\n\r\n            C.    Guarantor Liability\r\n\r\n     Appellants contend both Nandwani notes contain personal guaranties\r\nand the special referee should have addressed these guarantees in the\r\namended order. We agree.\r\n\r\n      \"A guaranty of payment is an absolute or unconditional promise to pay\r\na particular debt if it is not paid by the debtor at maturity.\" AMA Mgmt.\r\nCorp. v. Strasburger, 309 S.C. 213, 219, 420 S.E.2d 868, 872 (Ct. App.\r\n1992). \"It is a personal obligation running directly from the guarantor to the\r\ncreditor which is immediately enforceable against the guarantor upon default\r\nof the debtor.\" Id.; see Peoples Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Myrtle Beach Ret.\r\nGrp., Inc., 300 S.C. 277, 280, 387 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1989). \"Unless the debt\r\ninstrument or the instrument of guaranty prohibits assignment, an assignment\r\ndoes not release the guarantor, who is discharged only when the underlying\r\ndebt has been paid or otherwise satisfied in full.\" AMA Mgmt. Corp., 309\r\nS.C. at 219, 420 S.E.2d at 872.\r\n\r\n       Because the members of Partnership signed the notes both as members\r\nand guarantors, the Nandwani notes include both partnership liability and\r\nguarantor liability. The special referee erred in only addressing partnership\r\nliability in the amended order. Under a guarantor analysis, the $50,000\r\nNandwani note is still barred by the statute of limitations; thus any guarantor\r\nclaims would also be time-barred. In regards to the $160,000 note, which the\r\nspecial referee determined to be properly payable, both Appellants and\r\n\nRespondent have the right to pursue the claim for payment against the\r\nindividuals who signed the promissory note as guarantors. Therefore, we\r\nmodify the referee's order and find the guarantors are liable for the $160,000\r\nnote.       D.    Principal Amounts Owed on the Nandwani Notes\r\n\r\n     Appellants argue the special referee erred in finding the amounts\r\npayable on both Nandwani notes. They contend the evidence does not\r\nsupport the finding they are only entitled collect $53,000 on the $160,000\r\npromissory note and nothing on the $50,000 note. We disagree.\r\n\r\n      \"In an action at law, the appellate court will correct any error of law,\r\nbut it must affirm the special referee's factual findings unless there is no\r\nevidence that reasonably supports those findings.\" Roberts, 327 S.C. at 483,\r\n486 S.E.2d at 773.\r\n\r\n       The special referee provided a thorough explanation of his ruling in the\r\norder. The special referee's determination was based on a careful review of\r\nPartnership's records, exhibits, the testimony of Rabon, the record of\r\nprincipal paid on the $160,000 Nandwani note, a $9,000 loan made to the\r\nPartnership by Appellants, and the decision the $50,000 note was barred by\r\nthe statute of limitations, as discussed in the previous section.\r\n\r\n      Two significant decisions went into the special referee's determination\r\nof the amount payable on the $160,000 note. The first is a $25,000 payment\r\non September 9, 1993, to Kenny. The special referee's order determining the\r\nreduction of the $25,000 was based on the evidence presented by defendant's\r\nexhibits 50, 52, and 60. The record contains only exhibit 60, which shows a\r\npayment of $25,000 for \"note pay.\" No evidence in the record contradicts\r\nthe referee's finding that the $25,000 was applied to the outstanding debt for\r\nthe promissory note, and without the other exhibits, this court may conclude\r\nthe $25,000 check was for the payment of the $160,000 note. See Rule\r\n210(h), SCACR (stating the appellate court will not consider any fact that\r\ndoes not appear in the record on appeal); see also State v. Carlson, 363 S.C.\r\n\n586, 608, 611 S.E.2d 283, 294 (Ct. App. 2005) (stating the appellant bears\r\nthe burden of presenting a sufficient record to allow review).\r\n\r\n       The second decision by the special referee is the application of the\r\n$6,000 check to the payment of the outstanding debt on the $160,000 note.\r\nWhile the accountant had no accounting record of the check, the check was\r\nwritten and credit of payment should be credited towards the payment of\r\nPartnership's outstanding debt. Because the check was not traceable to the\r\ndebt barred by the statute of limitations on the $50,000 note, as discussed\r\npreviously, the special referee correctly applied the amount paid on the debt\r\nto the $160,000 note.\r\n\r\n      Evidence in the record supports the determination that John did assign\r\n$60,000 of the $160,000 note to Navlani's heirs. The exhibits cited in the\r\norder for this finding were not included in the record on this appeal. See\r\nRule 210, SCACR (stating the appellate court will not consider any fact\r\nwhich does not appear in the record on appeal); see also Carlson, 363 S.C. at\r\n608, 611 S.E.2d at 294 (stating the appellant bears the burden of presenting a\r\nsufficient record to allow review). However, the signed assignment of\r\n$60,000 of the $160,000 Nandwani note is in the record and can be relied on\r\nby this court. Because evidence supports the assignment from John to\r\nNavlani, this increases the principal owed to the Navlani heirs and reduces\r\nthe amount payable to Appellants. Accordingly, we affirm the special\r\nreferee's decision on this matter.\r\n\r\n           E.    Assignable Rights of the Navlani Notes\r\n\r\n      Appellants argue the special referee erred in determining the Uniform\r\nCommercial Code (UCC) did not apply to the question of whether the\r\nNavlani notes were assignable under the probate code. They contend the\r\nUCC establishes whether the promissory note is negotiable. They further\r\nassert that because the Navlani notes were not properly assigned, the Navlani\r\nheirs did not have a transferable interest in the notes at the time the notes\r\nwere assigned to Respondent. We disagree.\r\n\n      The special referee and Respondent cite section 62-3-101 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (2009) for the proposition that real property transfers at death\r\nfrom the decedent directly to his heirs or devisees. Section 62-3-101 states:\r\n\r\n            Upon the death of a person, his real property\r\n            devolves to the persons to whom it is devised by his\r\n            last will or to those indicated as substitutes for them\r\n            in cases involving lapse, renunciation, or other\r\n            circumstances affecting the devolution of testate\r\n            estates, or in the absence of testamentary disposition,\r\n            to his heirs, or to those indicated as substitutes for\r\n            them in cases involving renunciation or other\r\n            circumstances affecting the devolution of intestate\r\n            estates, subject to the purpose of satisfying claims as\r\n            to exempt property rights and the rights of creditors,\r\n            and the purposes of administration, particularly the\r\n            exercise of the powers of the personal representative\r\n            under §§ 62-3-709, 62-3-710, and 62-3-711, and his\r\n            personal property devolves, first, to his personal\r\n            representative, for the purpose of satisfying claims as\r\n            to exempt property rights and the rights of creditors,\r\n            and the purposes of administration, particularly the\r\n            exercise of the powers of the personal representative\r\n            under §§ 62-3-709, 62-3-710, and 62-3-711, and, at\r\n            the expiration of three years after the decedent's\r\n            death, if not yet distributed by the personal\r\n            representative, his personal property devolves to\r\n            those persons to whom it is devised by will or who\r\n            are his heirs in intestacy, or their substitutes, as the\r\n            case may be, just as with respect to real property.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Appellants argue the assignment of the note occurred\r\nprior to the expiration of the three-year period for devolving the interest, thus\r\nmaking the notes improperly assigned by Navlani's heirs in their transfer to\r\nRespondent.\r\n\n      The special referee also cited section 62-3-101 for the proposition that\r\nthe notes had devolved to the named heirs because the three-year period had\r\npassed by the time this case was before him. A plain reading of the statute\r\ndoes not bear out this portion of the special referee's analysis. The statute\r\ncontemplates (1) real property passing to heirs at the time of a decedent's\r\ndeath and (2) personal property passing by (a) the opening of an estate or (b)\r\nestate property being passed to heirs in the absence of a personal\r\nrepresentative's action after the accrual of a three year period. In this case,\r\nthe determination of whether Navlani's heirs had a right to assign their\r\ninterest in the notes is dependent on whether the promissory notes, secured by\r\nBon Villa, were real or personal property for the purpose of probate.\r\n\r\n      Real property is \"[l]and and anything growing on, attached to, or\r\nerected on it, excluding anything that may be severed without injury to the\r\nland. Real property can be either corporeal (soil and buildings) or\r\nincorporeal (easements).\" Black's Law Dictionary 1337 (9th ed. 2009).\r\nIncorporeal property is an in rem proprietary right that includes\r\nencumbrances like leases, mortgages, and servitudes. Id. at 1336. \"A\r\nmortgagee has both an in personam claim against the mortgagor on the debt\r\nor obligation and an in rem action against the security.\" Ralph E. Boyer,\r\nSurvey of the Law of Property 513 (3d ed. 1981).\r\n\r\n      The probate code does not define real property. However, section 12-\r\n37-10 of the South Carolina Code (2000) defines real property for the\r\npurpose of assessment of property taxes to mean \"not only land, city, town\r\nand village lots but also all structures and other things therein contained or\r\nannexed or attached thereto which pass to the vendee by the conveyance of\r\nthe land or lot.\" Furthermore, in section 31-3-20(14) of the South Carolina\r\nCode (2007), the phrase real property for the housing authority includes\r\n\"lands, lands under water, structures and any and all easements, franchises\r\nand incorporeal hereditaments and every estate and right therein, legal and\r\nequitable, including terms for years and liens by way of judgment, mortgage\r\nor otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n      Because a mortgage is real property in South Carolina, the Navlani\r\nheirs had the right to assign the notes under section 62-3-101 prior to the\r\n\nestate being probated under the intestacy statute. Therefore, we affirm the\r\nspecial referee's decision to uphold the assignment by the Navlani heirs to\r\nRespondent.\r\n\r\n      II.   Prior Litigation\r\n\r\n            A.    Res Judicata/Collateral Estoppel\r\n\r\n      Appellants contend because Respondent could have raised the breach\r\nof fiduciary duty claim and issues concerning the eviction of Partnership in\r\nthe prior suit with JVN, Respondent is barred by res judicata on the breach of\r\nfiduciary duty claim and is further barred by collateral estoppel from bringing\r\nthese issues against Appellants in this lawsuit. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment on the merits in a\r\nprior action will preclude the parties from re-litigating any claims actually\r\nlitigated or those that might have been litigated in the first action. Hilton\r\nHead Ctr. of S.C., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d\r\n176,176 (1987). To establish res judicata, three elements must be shown: (1)\r\nidentity of the parties; (2) identity of the subject matter; and (3) adjudication\r\nof the issue in the former suit. Sealy v. Dodge, 289 S.C. 543, 545, 347\r\nS.E.2d 504, 504 (1986). \"Res judicata also bars subsequent actions by the\r\nsame parties when the claims arise out of the same transaction or occurrence\r\nthat is the subject of a prior suit between those parties.\" Sub-Zero Freezer\r\nCo. v. R.J. Clarkson Co., 308 S.C., 188, 190-91, 417 S.E.2d 569, 571 (1992).\r\n\r\n      In this action, Respondent pled a breach of fiduciary duty against\r\nAppellants based on their involvement with the purchase, ownership, and\r\noperation of lots 3 and 4 in connection with Appellants' membership in\r\nPartnership. Additionally, Respondent pled the damages resulting from such\r\nbreach to Partnership's assets and ownership of those assets to Partnership\r\nand partners, individually. In the prior order from the JVN action, the trial\r\ncourt found \"the issues of ownership of the various lots, whether owned or\r\nleased, which were partnership assets as of 1996, are specifically not\r\naddressed in the Settlement Agreement or this Order.\" \"Neither are the\r\n\nvarious partners' equity and percentage of ownership in these lots addressed\r\nherein and the same shall be determined at a later [h]earing.\"\r\n\r\n      The special referee correctly determined res judicata did not bar\r\nRespondent in this action because (1) the trial court's order in the JVN action\r\ndid not address Partnership property, (2) Appellants' breach of fiduciary duty\r\nhad not occurred at the time of the counterclaim, and (3) the time for\r\nadditional pleadings had passed under Rule 15, SCRCP.\r\n\r\n       The trial court's order in the JVN action provided that a separate\r\nhearing would determine issues of ownership of Partnership's assets. The\r\nbreach of fiduciary duty raised in this appeal is one arising out of the property\r\nexcluded from the trial court's order and settlement agreement. Additionally,\r\nthe breach of the fiduciary duty pled in this case involves the eviction of\r\nPartnership and the failure of Appellants to notify the other partners under\r\ntheir obligations of good faith and loyalty. Litigation with JVN commenced\r\nin 1999, prior to the eviction and ejectment by J's and Appellants. While the\r\nparties are comprised of the same individuals, the subject matter before the\r\ntrial court was a separate and distinct cause of action.\r\n\r\n       \"Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, also known as issue\r\npreclusion, when an issue has been actually litigated and determined by a\r\nvalid and final judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent\r\naction whether on the same or a different claim.\" Zurcher v. Bilton, 379 S.C.\r\n132, 135, 666 S.E.2d 224, 226 (2008). \"While the traditional use of collateral\r\nestoppel required mutuality of parties to bar relitigation, modern courts\r\nrecognize the mutuality requirement is not necessary for the application of\r\ncollateral estoppel where the party against whom estoppel is asserted had a\r\nfull and fair opportunity to previously litigate the issues.\" Snavely v.\r\nAMISUB of S.C., Inc., 379 S.C. 386, 398, 665 S.E.2d 222, 228 (Ct. App.\r\n2008) (emphasis added) (citing Beall v. Doe, 281 S.C. 363, 370-71, 315\r\nS.E.2d 186, 190-91 (Ct. App. 1984)). \"[H]owever, to assert collateral\r\nestoppel successfully, the party seeking issue preclusion still must show that\r\nthe issue was actually litigated and directly determined in the prior action and\r\nthat the matter or fact directly in issue was necessary to support the first\r\njudgment.\" Beall, 281 S.C. at 371, 315 S.E.2d at 191 (emphasis added).\r\n\n       In this case, Respondent did not have a full and fair opportunity to\r\nlitigate the breach of fiduciary duty within the factual context of evicting\r\nPartnership in the prior litigation. A fiduciary duty can be held by more than\r\none person and in more than one circumstance. The fact the issue of a\r\nfiduciary duty was litigated previously does not stop another from breaching\r\nhis or her own fiduciary duty later. Thus, the breach being claimed in this\r\ncase is a separate issue warranting a separate determination. Therefore, we\r\nfind the special referee correctly found neither res judicata nor collateral\r\nestoppel barred Respondent's claim for breach of fiduciary duty.\r\n\r\n            B.    Settlement Agreement\r\n\r\n      Appellants argue the express terms of the settlement agreement bar the\r\nclaims against them in this case. The record supports the special referee's\r\ninterpretation and finding that matters regarding partnership assets and\r\nownership interests were \"reserved to be determined at a later hearing.\"\r\nTherefore, we affirm the special referee's determination that Appellants'\r\nbreach of fiduciary duty was not barred by the settlement agreement.\r\n\r\n      III. Property\r\n\r\n            A.    Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\n\r\n      Appellants argue the special referee erred in determining they breached\r\ntheir fiduciary duty to Partnership when J's purchased lots 3 and 4.\r\nAppellants suggest the evidence in the record does not support a breach of\r\nfiduciary duty. We disagree.\r\n\r\n      \"A claim of breach of fiduciary duty is an action at law [,] and the trial\r\njudge's findings will be upheld unless without evidentiary support.\" Jordan v.\r\nHolt, 362 S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d 129, 131 (2005). \"Partners are\r\nfiduciaries [to each other] and their relationship is one of mutual trust and\r\nconfidence, imposing upon them requirements of loyalty, good faith, and fair\r\ndealing.\" Redwend Ltd. P'ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 475, 581 S.E.2d\r\n496, 505 (Ct. App. 2003); accord Few v. Few, 239 S.C. 321, 336, 122 S.E.2d\r\n\n829, 836 (1961). \"A fiduciary relationship is founded on the trust and\r\nconfidence reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of another.\"\r\nEllis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 519, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004);\r\nRegions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 670, 582 S.E.2d 432, 444 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2003). \"Parties in a fiduciary relationship must fully disclose to each\r\nother all known information that is significant and material, and when this\r\nduty to disclose is triggered, silence may constitute fraud.\" Ellie, Inc.v.\r\nMiccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 100, 594 S.E.2d 485, 497 (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting\r\nAnthony v. Padmar, Inc., 320 S.C. 436, 449, 465 S.E.2d 745, 752 (Ct. App.\r\n1995)).\r\n\r\n      South Carolina case law recognizes the fiduciary duty owed between\r\npartners. Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 252, 599 S.E.2d 467, 473 (Ct. App.\r\n2004). The court held in Lawson v. Rogers:\r\n\r\n           The law holds each member of a partnership to the\r\n           highest degree of good faith in his dealings with\r\n           reference to any matter which concerns the business\r\n           of the common engagement, and each partner, being\r\n           the agent of the firm, must be held to the same\r\n           accountability as other trustees, in all matters which\r\n           affect the common interest. The relationship of a\r\n           partnership is fiduciary in character and imposes on\r\n           the members the obligation of refraining from taking\r\n           any advantage of one another by the slightest\r\n           misrepresentation or concealment.\r\n\r\n312 S.C. 492, 498-99, 435 S.E.2d 853, 857 (1993); see also Edwards v.\r\nJohnson, 90 S.C. 90, 99, 72 S.E. 638, 642 (1911) (stating each member of a\r\npartnership is held to the highest degree of good faith in his dealings with\r\nreference to any matter concerning the business of the common engagement,\r\nand each partner, being an agent of the firm, must be held, during the\r\nexistence of the relation, to the same accountability as other trustees in all\r\nmatters affecting the common interest).\r\n\n       Appellants contend they acted within the confines of the law in their\r\npurchasing of lots 3 and 4 and did not breach their fiduciary duty to\r\nPartnership. Kenny testified Mrs. Smith approached him with the offer to\r\nsell the lots only after Partnership refused to purchase the lots. Following the\r\npurchase, the Appellants argue they were entitled to evict Partnership under\r\nthe leasehold agreement and section 27-37-10 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(2007).9 Furthermore, they contend they should not be held liable for the\r\ndemolition of Bon Villa because proper ejectment occurred.\r\n\r\n      In this case, Appellants' undisclosed purchase of the property was\r\nintimately connected with Partnership's purpose and function. Kenny's\r\ntestimony that Mrs. Smith contacted him does not lessen his duty Partnership\r\nbecause the line of communication between Kenny and Mrs. Smith existed\r\ndue to his role in Partnership. Mrs. Smith stated in her deposition that she\r\nknew Appellants because of their involvement with the payment of\r\nPartnership's taxes in the past. The option to purchase was made through a\r\npartner relationship and is statutorily guarded under section 33-41-540 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (2006).            Furthermore, Appellants were aware\r\nPartnership had been interested in purchasing the fee tail previously and\r\nowed a duty to inform all of the partners of the opportunity, as provided in\r\nthe statute. Appellants, as fiduciaries, violated their obligations of mutual\r\nloyalty, good faith, and fair dealing. Redwend Ltd. P'ship, 354 S.C. at 475,\r\n581 S.E.2d at 505.\r\n\r\n       The more troubling breach of fiduciary duty by Appellants is their\r\ninaction regarding the notification of the eviction process and the demolition\r\nof Bon Villa. Appellants, as members of Partnership, are in a fiduciary\r\nrelationship requiring they disclose to each partner all information that is\r\nsignificant and material. Ellie Inc., 358 S.C. at 100, 594 S.E.2d at 497. J's\r\ndoes not have this duty, but Appellants are held to a higher standard. As\r\ndiscussed with the notice requirements for the Rule to Show Cause, infra,\r\nfailure to show proof of delivery is not an automatic failure of service under\r\nRule 4; however, when applied to the duties required of partners, this is a\r\n9 Section 27-37-10 states a tenant may be ejected when \"the terms or\r\nconditions of the lease have been violated.\"\r\n\nsubstantial breach of a fiduciary duty. Appellants were informed of\r\nsignificant and substantial information affecting the interest of Partnership\r\nand failed to act with good faith and loyalty towards the other partners.\r\nStrong evidence of Appellants' bad faith is Appellants' decision not to pay the\r\n1999 property taxes or seek payment of taxes by Partnership or its other\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n      Appellants' brief argues in great detail that the special referee erred in\r\nfinding \"no evidence [Respondent] acted with unclean hands against\r\n[Appellants],\" which they asserted as a defense to the breach of fiduciary\r\nduty claimed by Respondent. Neither the special referee's finding nor this\r\nequitable defense by Appellants affect Appellants' fiduciary duty owed to\r\nPartnership. To sustain an equitable defense of unclean hands, there must be\r\n(1) inequitable conduct by the plaintiff, (2) related directly to the subject\r\nmatter of the litigation, which (3) causes prejudice or injury to the defendant.\r\nThis court's holding in Navlani v. Bhambhani is independent of Appellants'\r\nbreach of fiduciary duty in this case. Appellants' decisions to purchase lots 3\r\nand 4 and then evict Partnership were not legally connected with\r\nRespondent's mismanagement of money or the court ordered repayment of\r\nfunds to Partnership. Accordingly, evidence supports the special referee's\r\nfinding that Appellants breached their fiduciary duty toward Partnership and\r\nthe partners.\r\n\r\n            B.    Judgment for $631,838\r\n\r\n       Appellants argue the special referee erred in finding Partnership is\r\nentitled to a judgment of $631,838 for breach of Appellants' fiduciary duty.\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\n      A party cannot complain about the valuation of an asset by a court\r\nwhen the party fails to present a valuation. S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. M & T\r\nEnters. of Mt. Pleasant, LLC, 379 S.C. 645, 672, 667 S.E.2d 7, 22 (Ct. App.\r\n2008). \"Generally, in order for damages to be recoverable, the evidence\r\nshould be such as to enable the court or jury to determine the amount thereof\r\nwith reasonable certainty or accuracy.\" Whisenant v. James Island Corp.,\r\n277 S.C. 10, 13, 281 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1981). \"While neither the existence,\r\n\ncausation nor amount of damages can be left to conjecture, guess or\r\nspeculation, proof with mathematical certainty of the amount of loss or\r\ndamage is not required.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      \"Ordinarily a property owner, who is familiar with his property and its\r\nvalue, may give his estimate of its value or the damage inflicted upon it even\r\nthough he is not an expert.\" Barton v. Superior Motors, Inc., 309 S.C. 491,\r\n494, 424 S.E.2d 524, 526 (Ct. App. 1992); see also Abercrombie v.\r\nAbercrombie, 372 S.C. 643, 647, 643 S.E.2d 697, 699 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n(recognizing general rule in South Carolina that a property owner is\r\ncompetent to offer testimony as to the value of his property).\r\n\r\n           The fact [the special referee] heard the evidence and\r\n           was more familiar than we with the evidentiary\r\n           atmosphere at trial gives [the special referee], we\r\n           think a better informed view than we have. This is\r\n           particularly true when the elements of damage are\r\n           intangibles and the appraisal depends somewhat on\r\n           the observation of the [witnesses] and evaluation of\r\n           their testimony.\r\n\r\nJordan, 362 S.C. at 207, 608 S.E.2d at 132.\r\n\r\n       Testimony in the record supports the special referee's view that Bon\r\nVilla was worth $631,838 based on the 1997 federal tax return. Appellants\r\nsuggest the evidence in the record does not support such a finding on the\r\ngrounds (1) Partnership did not have a successful business venture with Bon\r\nVilla; (2) a portion of Partnership's properties had been condemned by the\r\ncity of Myrtle Beach; (3) the lease agreement provided the definition of\r\nabandonment, which Appellants assert had occurred; and (4) Partnership's\r\nassets were valued at $241,254 in 2000, as discussed in a prior opinion by\r\nthis court.\r\n\r\n     Appellants reference both the condemnation action and the valuation of\r\nproperty discussed in Navlani v. Bhambhani. Appellants did produce\r\nevidence of the condemnation action and provided testimony at the trial of\r\n\nthe condemnation and the state of the property at the time J's evicted\r\nPartnership. However, Appellants provided no evidence to support a\r\ndifferent fair market value of the property at the time of condemnation or the\r\ndemolition of Bon Villa. Furthermore, Appellants reference to this court's\r\nholding in Navlani v. Bhambhani for the value of the property is misplaced.\r\nThe $241,250 figure in that case is the value of the disbursements taken by\r\nRespondent, not the value of the property. Also, the accounting for the\r\nfiduciary breach in that case is not the same because the values of the\r\nbuildings were not the subject of the assets being discussed by the court.\r\nTherefore, we affirm the special referee's determination that Respondent is\r\nentitled to a judgment of $631,838, as evidence exists in the record to support\r\nhis decision.\r\n\r\n            C.     Service of Rule to Show Cause for Eviction\r\n\r\n       Appellants contend evidence fails to support the finding that the\r\npartners and Partnership were not properly notified of the eviction of\r\nPartnership from lots 3 and 4. Appellants argue they served the eviction\r\naction on Partnership by three methods, which demonstrates adequate\r\nnotification was given and the requirements for the eviction's Rule to Show\r\nCause were met. The special referee found no evidence to support the Rule\r\nto Show Cause was affixed to the Bon Villa. Therefore, the special referee\r\ndetermined by the preponderance of the evidence, the ruling on the\r\nAppellants' breach of fiduciary duty could not be changed. This court need\r\nnot reach this issue because the determination does not affect whether\r\nAppellants are liable for breach of fiduciary duty. See Futch v. McAllister\r\nTowing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n(providing an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its\r\ndetermination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      Based on all of the foregoing, the order of the special referee is\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\nFEW, C.J., and THOMAS and KONDUROS, J.J., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-386","title":"State v.

Myers, of Lexington, for\r\n        Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Thomas Hilliard appeals his voluntary manslaughter conviction,\r\narguing the circuit court erred in allowing his prior convictions for obstructing a\r\npolice officer and burglary to be used to impeach his testimony pursuant to Rule\r\n609(a)(2), SCRE. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1.     As to whether the circuit court erred by allowing Hilliard to be impeached\r\nwith his prior second degree burglary conviction, we find the circuit court did not\r\nerr because the record reflects the second degree burglary conviction involved the\r\ntaking of another's personal property. Initially, we find this issue is properly before\r\nthe court. See State v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 266, 269, 460 S.E.2d 409, 411 (Ct. App.\r\n1995) (concluding that when a party has obtained a final ruling on the admissibility\r\nof impeachment evidence, the party \"does not lose his right to challenge on appeal\r\nthe admissibility of the evidence by eliciting the evidence during direct\r\nexamination\"). As to the merits, we find the circuit court did not err in allowing\r\nthe prior burglary conviction in as impeachment evidence pursuant to Rule\r\n609(a)(2), SCRE, because the record reflects this particular crime involved\r\ndishonesty. See Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE; State v. Bryant, 369 S.C. 511, 517, 633\r\nS.E.2d 152, 155-56 (2006) (noting that a conviction for \"robbery, burglary, theft,\r\nand drug possession, beyond the basic crime itself, is not probative of\r\ntruthfulness.\" (citing United States v. Smith, 181 F. Supp. 2d 904 (N.D. Ill. 2002)));\r\nHunter v. Staples, 335 S.C. 93, 103-04, 515 S.E.2d 261, 267 (Ct. App. 1999)\r\n(finding that the issue of whether prior burglary conviction could be admitted as\r\ncrime of dishonesty pursuant to Rule 609(a)(2) was unpreserved but noting the\r\ncircuit court did not have enough information to \"determine the nature of the\r\nburglary\" because defendant failed to present the indictment). Here, the record\r\nreflects Hilliard's prior burglary offense involved the taking of coins from another's\r\nresidence. Hilliard did not object to this characterization of the crime at trial.\r\nBased on this evidence, the circuit court found Hilliard's prior conviction for\r\nburglary was a crime of dishonesty pursuant to Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE.\r\nAccordingly, we find the circuit court did not err in allowing Hilliard to be\r\nimpeached with the previous burglary conviction because there was adequate,\r\nunopposed evidence submitted that the crime involved dishonesty. See generally\r\nState v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 425, 578 S.E.2d 32, 43 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"It is the\r\nlarcenous element of taking property of another which makes the action\r\ndishonest.\").\r\n\r\n2.     As to whether the circuit court erred by allowing Hilliard to be impeached\r\nwith his prior conviction for obstructing a police officer, we find the circuit court\r\nerred. However, we find this error to be harmless. The Georgia conviction for\r\n\nobstructing a police officer was not a crime of dishonesty, and therefore, the circuit\r\ncourt erred by not conducting the probative versus prejudicial analysis as required\r\nby Rule 609(a)(1). See Al-Amin, 353 S.C. at 426, 578 S.E.2d at 43 (noting crimes\r\nnot involving dishonesty require the court to conduct a probative versus prejudicial\r\nanalysis prior to admission). However, we find this error was harmless because the\r\noverwhelming evidence indicated Hilliard intentionally struck the victim's face and\r\ncaused the victim to fall to the ground. See State v. Johnson, 363 S.C. 53, 60, 609\r\nS.E.2d 520, 524 (2005) (\"[T]he error is harmless if the error could not have\r\nreasonably affected the outcome of the trial.\"). Hilliard's counsel only briefly\r\nelicited the testimony in an attempt to lessen the impact, and the State did not elicit\r\nany further testimony concerning the prior conviction. Accordingly, under the\r\nfacts of this case, we find the wrongful admission of the prior obstructing a police\r\nofficer charge was harmless.

McDaniel, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\r\n        R. Daniel Addison, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\n      PER CURIAM: Margaree Maple appeals the Appellate Panel of the\r\nWorkers' Compensation Commission's (the Appellate Panel) denial of her\r\nclaim for temporary total disability (TTD) benefits. She argues (1) the\r\nAppellate Panel erred in holding she refused an offer of suitable employment;\r\n(2) the single commissioner erred in sua sponte directing and admitting the\r\ndepositions of Dr. Roger Gaddy and Star Connor; and (3) the Appellate Panel\r\nerred in adopting a proposed order. We affirm in part and remand for further\r\nfindings.\r\n\r\n      Under the Administrative Procedures Act, this \"court may affirm the\r\ndecision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2011). The court may \"reverse or modify\r\nthe decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced\r\nbecause the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are\"\r\naffected by an error of law, not supported by substantial evidence, or affected\r\nby an abuse of discretion. Id.\r\n\r\n       1.    As to whether the Appellate Panel erred in holding Maple refused\r\nan offer of suitable employment, we remand for further findings. In light of\r\nthe disputed facts and issues in this case, the Appellate Panel must determine\r\nwhether, when, and for how long Maple was disabled within the meaning of\r\nthe Workers' Compensation Act. The Appellate Panel must also determine\r\nwhen and for how long Maple refused an offer of suitable employment.\r\nLastly, the Appellate Panel must determine how those findings affect Maple's\r\nentitlement to TTD benefits. Without all of those findings, the order is\r\ninsufficient to enable a meaningful review of whether the Appellate Panel\r\nerred in determining Maple was not entitled to any TTD benefits. See\r\nMartinez v. Spartanburg Cnty., 394 S.C. 224, 230, 715 S.E.2d 339, 342 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2011) (\"The findings of fact made by the Appellate Panel must be\r\nsufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court to determine whether the\r\nevidence supports the findings.\"); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-200 (1985)\r\n(providing that an employee does not become entitled to compensation\r\nbenefits until the eighth calendar day of disability resulting from an injury,\r\nand the employee's entitlement to compensation benefits dates back to the\r\nfirst day of that disability if the disability lasts for more than fourteen\r\ncalendar days (emphasis added)); S.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-120 (1985)\r\n(providing that \"disability\" is defined as \"incapacity because of injury to earn\r\n\nwages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury in the same or\r\nany other employment\" (second emphasis added)); S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-\r\n10(A) (1985) (providing that an employee is entitled to TTD benefits \"[w]hen\r\nthe incapacity for work resulting from an injury is total\"); S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n42-9-190 (1985) (providing that an employee is not entitled to any\r\ncompensation during the period the employee refuses an offer of suitable\r\nemployment); Last v. MSI Constr. Co., 305 S.C. 349, 351, 409 S.E.2d 334,\r\n336 (1991) (providing that \"the fact that a claimant is unemployable for\r\nreasons other than his injury is not dispositive\" of whether a claimant is\r\ndisabled; rather, \"[t]he issue is whether a claimant has suffered some loss of\r\nearning capacity as a direct result of his work-related injury\"); Shealy v.\r\nAlgernon Blair, Inc., 250 S.C. 106, 112, 156 S.E.2d 646, 649 (1967) (\"The\r\nobject of the act is to relieve an injured workman from the loss or impairment\r\nof his capacity to earn wages. [T]he fact that after the injury the employee\r\nhas not worked and has therefore earned no wages is not in itself\r\ndeterminative of the extent of loss of his earning capacity.\" (citations and\r\ninternal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in opinion)).\r\n\r\n      2.    As to the direction and admission of the depositions, we affirm.\r\nSingle commissioners generally have greater procedural latitude than circuit\r\ncourt judges to arrive at a fair determination of the facts, and in this case,\r\nabsolutely nothing in the record indicates the single commissioner directed\r\nthe depositions or left the record open in disregard of her professional\r\nresponsibilities. See Burns v. Joyner, 264 S.C. 207, 212, 213 S.E.2d 734, 736\r\n(1975) (holding that although the single commissioner \"participated actively\r\nin the case,\" it is the single commissioner's \"responsibility to arrive at a fair\r\ndetermination of the facts and not merely to serve as an umpire calling a\r\ncontest between competing attorneys\"). Moreover, the direction and\r\nadmission of the depositions did not violate Maple's due process rights, and\r\neven if those actions contravened applicable statutes and regulations, the\r\nerror was harmless. Prior to the hearing before the commissioner, Maple\r\nknew she was terminated for falsifying a doctor's note. She also had notice\r\nthat Heritage wished to depose Dr. Gaddy, and she explicitly \"welcomed\"\r\nMs. Connor's deposition. Lastly, Maple cross-examined Dr. Ross and Ms.\r\nConnor during their depositions. Therefore, Maple has failed to show the\r\ndirection and admission of the depositions prejudiced her. See § 1-23-380(5)\r\n\n(providing that this court may reverse or modify an agency's decision only \"if\r\nsubstantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       3.   As to the adoption of the proposed order, we affirm. First, the\r\nAPA explicitly contemplates the adoption of proposed orders. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 1-23-350 (2005) (\"A final decision or order adverse to a party in a\r\ncontested case shall be in writing or stated in the record. A final decision\r\nshall include findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated.\r\nFindings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a\r\nconcise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings.\r\nIf, in accordance with agency rules, a party submitted proposed findings of\r\nfact, the decision shall include a ruling upon each proposed finding.\").\r\nSecond, no law precludes the Appellate Panel from making a \"consensus\r\ndecision\" by adopting an order prepared by a party. Third, the Appellate\r\nPanel's \"ver batim,\" signatured adoption of the single commissioner's\r\nfindings and conclusions \"based on review of the record as a whole and the\r\noral arguments of the parties\" is sufficient to constitute a ruling on each\r\nproposed finding.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED IN PART, AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\n\r\n      WILLIAMS, THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-389","title":"Ulfers v.

Feeley, of Summerville, for Respondent\r\n           Fred Ulfers.\r\n\r\n       PER CURIAM: In this appeal of an order to quiet a tax title to real\r\nproperty in Dorchester County, South Carolina, the master-in-equity ordered\r\nthat fee simple title to the subject property be confirmed in Respondent Fred\r\nUlfers, who with his now deceased wife, Yvonne Ulfers, purchased the\r\nproperty at a tax sale in 2004. Henry S. Capers, the record owner of the\r\nsubject property until the filing of the tax deed, appeals. We reverse.\r\n\n      Capers has operated a business on the subject property since he\r\npurchased it in 1989. In 2004, as a result of Capers' failure to pay the 2003\r\ntaxes on the property, the Dorchester County Treasurer issued an execution to\r\nSuzanna Davis, the Delinquent Tax Collector for Dorchester County. The\r\ntaxes remained unpaid, and the property was sold at a public tax sale on\r\nOctober 4, 2004, to the Ulfers.\r\n\r\n       Capers did not redeem the property, so in January 2006 Davis executed\r\nand delivered a tax title conveying the property to the Ulfers, who filed the\r\ndeed and commenced this action seeking to quiet their title to the subject\r\nproperty and other relief. Capers answered in February 2008, denying the\r\nmaterial allegations of the complaint and counterclaiming to have the tax sale\r\nset aside on numerous grounds, including his assertion that certain statutorily\r\nrequired procedures in conjunction with the levy and sale were not followed.\r\nYvonne Ulfers died after commencement of the lawsuit, and Fred Ulfers\r\nobtained leave of court to amend the complaint to reflect his status as her\r\npersonal representative and sole devisee. Davis, in her capacity as the\r\nDelinquent Tax Collector for Dorchester County, was also made a party to\r\nthis action.\r\n\r\n       After a bench trial in the matter, the master quieted and confirmed title\r\nto the subject property in Ulfers, terminated Capers' interest in the property,\r\nand dismissed Davis with prejudice. Following an unsuccessful attempt to\r\nalter or amend the judgment, Capers filed this appeal.\r\n\r\n1. We first note the controversy before us involves equitable matters. See\r\nFox v. Moultrie, 379 S.C. 609, 613, 666 S.E.2d 915, 917 (2008) (\"An action\r\nto quiet title is one in equity.\"); Folk v. Thomas, 344 S.C. 77, 80, 543 S.E.2d\r\n556, 557 (2001) (\"An action to set aside a tax deed is in equity.\"). Hence, our\r\nstandard of review allows us to determine facts according to our own view of\r\nthe preponderance of the evidence, subject to the caveat that we are not\r\nrequired to disregard factual findings by the master, who saw and heard the\r\nwitnesses and was therefore in a better position to assess their credibility and\r\ndemeanor. King v. James, 388 S.C. 16, 24, 694 S.E.2d 35, 39 (Ct. App.\r\n2010).\r\n\n2. Among the required procedures that Capers maintained were not followed\r\nwas the first notice of delinquent property taxes pursuant to South Carolina\r\nCode section 12-51-40(a) (Supp. 2011).1 Capers disputes the master's\r\nstatement that Davis mailed the first notice to him strictly according to the\r\nrequirements of section 12-51-40(a), arguing no evidence in the record\r\nsupported this finding. We agree. Davis testified her office did not handle\r\nthe mailing of the notice to Capers, but instead relied on an outside\r\ncontractor. No representative of the contractor testified during the hearing.\r\nFurthermore, the contractor worked from a delinquent taxpayer list that Davis\r\ndid not compile. Davis did not have the list when she testified, nor could she\r\nproduce a copy of the letter that she claimed was mailed to Capers. Davis\r\nfurther conceded she had no way of verifying whether the letter purportedly\r\nsent to Capers contained the language required by section 12-51-40(a). We\r\ntherefore hold the master erred in finding that Davis complied with section\r\n12-51-40(a). In so holding, we do not take issue with the master's assessment\r\nof Davis's credibility; rather, our conclusion that the finding was in error is\r\nbased on Davis's admitted lack of personal knowledge relating to the mailing\r\nof this statutorily required notice and the failure to call a witness who could\r\nhave provided this information.\r\n\r\n3. The South Carolina Supreme Court has stated that \"[a]ll requirements of\r\nlaw leading up to tax sales are intended for the protection of the taxpayer\r\nagainst surprise or the sacrifice of his property and are regarded as mandatory\r\nand are strictly enforced.\" Tanner v. Florence Cnty. Treasurer, 336 S.C. 552,\r\n563, 521 S.E.2d 153, 158-59 (1999). \"Failure to give the required notice is a\r\nfundamental defect in the tax proceedings which renders the proceedings\r\nabsolutely void.\" Id. at 563, 521 S.E.2d at 159 (citing Donohue v. Ward, 298\r\nS.C. 75, 78, 378 S.E.2d 261, 265 (Ct. App. 1989)). Similarly, the failure to\r\nprove compliance with the mailing requirement imposed by section 12-51-\r\n40(a) renders the proceedings at issue in this appeal void, and the master\r\nerred in refusing to set aside the tax sale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1  Subsection 12-51-40(a) has not been changed since 2000; therefore, the\r\ncited version was in effect when the tax sale took place and when this matter\r\nwas pending before the master.\r\n\n4. The master further held that because Capers filed his counterclaim after\r\ntwo years had passed from the date of the tax sale, he was time-barred by\r\nsection 12-51-160 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) from attempting\r\nto recover his property. Capers argues this ruling was error for several\r\nreasons, among them, that no party had raised the statute of limitations as an\r\naffirmative defense to this action as required by Rule 8(c), SCRCP. We\r\nagree with this argument. Although it has been noted that section 12-51-160\r\n\"appears to operate as a statute of repose,\" within the same opinion this court\r\nhas expressly declined to rule as to whether or not it should be treated as\r\nsuch. Corbin v. Carlin, 366 S.C. 187, 192 n.2, 620 S.E.2d 745, 748 n.2 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2005). Moreover, in a decision issued after the briefs in this matter\r\nwere filed, this court applied section 12-51-160 as a statute of limitations,\r\ndiscussing at some length the policy behind such statutes. King, 388 S.C. at\r\n26, 694 S.E.2d at 40. We see no reason to depart from this view, considering\r\nthe severity of the forfeiture at issue in this appeal, and therefore hold the\r\nmaster should not have invoked section 12-51-160 when neither Ulfers nor\r\nDavis raised it as an affirmative defense.\r\n\r\n5. Capers argued several other grounds for setting aside the tax sale,\r\nincluding deficiencies in the tax title issued to Ulfers, inadequate proof that\r\nDavis followed the statutory requirements for advertising the property for the\r\ntax sale, concerns about the language in the second required notice, and\r\nassorted equitable concerns. Because, however, we have held that proof of\r\nthe first notice was inadequate and that this inadequacy alone warranted\r\nsetting aside the tax sale, we do not address Capers' other grounds.

Dore, Dore Law Firm, P.A., of Beaufort, for\r\n            Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: Andrew Singleton appeals from an order finding he held real property\r\nin Beaufort County in trust for his siblings, Arthur and Bernice Singleton, and\r\nrequiring that he transfer a one-third interest to each of them. Andrew conceded at\r\noral argument that a trust exists. However, he disputes the identities of the\r\n\nbeneficiaries. Andrew argues all of the extended family members now living on\r\nthe property are beneficiaries because he allowed them to live on the property. The\r\nmaster-in-equity found the only beneficiaries were Andrew, Arthur, and Bernice.\r\nWe agree with the master.\r\n\r\nThere were several theories advanced as to how the trust was created. However,\r\nthere is no theory of the trust under which it could have been created after 1959.\r\nAt that time, the only possible beneficiaries were the siblings and their parents,\r\nwho are now deceased. There is no evidence in the record that Andrew was given\r\nthe duty or power to increase the class of beneficiaries. Accordingly, we affirm the\r\nmaster's finding that the trust existed for the benefit of Andrew, Arthur, and\r\nBernice.\r\n\r\nAndrew's argument that the extended family members living on the property are\r\nindispensable parties under Rule 19, SCRCP, is unpreserved because it was not\r\nraised to the master either during the trial or in a post-trial motion. See Kiriakides\r\nv. Atlas Food Sys. & Servs., Inc., 343 S.C. 587, 596, 541 S.E.2d 257, 262 (2001)\r\n(stating \"defense of failure to join indispensable parties is waived if not raised at\r\ntrial\"); Cromer v.

App. 1987)\r\n(stating failure to join a \"necessary party is not jurisdictional\" and, therefore,\r\ncannot be raised for the first time on appeal).\r\n\r\nFinally, we find an additional sustaining ground for affirming the master's decision\r\nto order that an interest in the property be conveyed to Arthur and Bernice. The\r\nsiblings orally agreed Andrew would convey two-thirds of the property to Arthur\r\nand Bernice. The statute of frauds is satisfied as to this agreement to convey real\r\nproperty by a deed signed in 1995 by all three siblings that conveys a one-third\r\ninterest each to Arthur and Bernice.1 See S.C. Code Ann. § 32-3-10(4) (2007) (An\r\noral contract to convey real property may be enforced if \"the agreement upon\r\nwhich such action shall be brought or some memorandum or note thereof shall be\r\nin writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith . . . .\"); Player v.\r\nChandler, 299 S.C. 101, 106, 382 S.E.2d 891, 895 (1989) (\"The writing must\r\nreasonably identify the subject matter of the contract, sufficiently indicate a\r\ncontract has been made between the parties, and state with reasonable certainty the\r\nessential terms of the agreement.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1   The deed was improperly executed, and Andrew did not record it.\r\n\nAccordingly, the relief in the master's order requiring the conveyance of two-thirds\r\nof the title to Arthur and Bernice is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nHUFF and SHORT, JJ., concur.\n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-392","title":"Hardwick v.

On appeal,\r\nHardwick argues: (1) due process and/or public policy require that a purported\r\nsettlement agreement be in writing to be enforceable; (2) the circuit court erred in\r\n\nfinding an oral agreement as a matter of law where triable issues of fact existed as\r\nto the sufficiency of the offer and acceptance; and (3) the circuit court erred in\r\naltering and/or adding terms to the purported agreement. We affirm as modified.\r\n\r\n1.     As to Hardwick's due process argument, we find this issue unpreserved\r\nbecause Hardwick raised the issue for the first time in his Rule 59(e), SCRCP\r\nmotion. See McClurg v. Deaton, 380 S.C. 563, 579-80, 671 S.E.2d 87, 96 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2008), aff'd, 395 S.C. 85, 716 S.E.2d 887 (2011) (holding a party may not\r\nraise an issue for the first time in a motion to reconsider, alter or amend a\r\njudgment).\r\n\r\n2.     As to Hardwick's argument that triable issues of fact existed as to the\r\nsufficiency of the offer and acceptance, we find the circuit court did not err in\r\nfinding that the parties had reached settlement. See Pee Dee Stores, Inc. v. Doyle,\r\n381 S.C. 234, 241, 672 S.E.2d 799, 802 (Ct. App. 2008) (\"In South Carolina\r\njurisprudence, settlement agreements are viewed as contracts.\"); Sherman v. W & B\r\nEnterprises, Inc., 357 S.C. 243, 250, 592 S.E.2d 307, 310 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"When\r\nthe existence of a contract is questioned and the evidence either conflicts or gives\r\nrise to more than one inference, the issue of the contract's existence becomes a\r\nquestion for the finder of fact.\"). Specifically, Hardwick's demand letter\r\nconstituted an offer to settle the case for the policy limits, and Jones' response letter\r\nconstituted an acceptance of the offer. See Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C.\r\n648, 660, 582 S.E.2d 432, 439 (Ct. App. 2003) (\"A contract is an obligation which\r\narises from actual agreement of the parties manifested by words, oral or written, or\r\nby conduct.\"); Roberts v. Gaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 483, 486 S.E.2d 771, 773 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1997) (\"The necessary elements of a contract are an offer, acceptance, and\r\nvaluable consideration.\"). See also Erhardt v. Duff, 729 So. 2d 529, 530 (Fla. Dist.\r\nCt. App. 1999) (\"[W]e hold the execution of the release was implicit as part of the\r\ntender, and not an additional element of the agreement.\").\r\n\r\n3.    As to whether the circuit court erred in altering the terms of the settlement,\r\nwe affirm as modified. To the extent the circuit court's ruling can be interpreted as\r\nadding additional terms to the parties' settlement agreement, we find the only\r\ncondition to the settlement agreement was that Hardwick could no longer pursue\r\nany legal action against Jones personally for injuries arising out of the May 29,\r\n2009, accident.1 Indeed, this condition was the consideration for Jones' acceptance\r\nof Hardwick's offer to settle.\r\n\r\n1Specifically, Hardwick argues Jones added additional terms and conditions to the\r\nsettlement agreement when Jones listed lienholders on the settlement check that\r\n\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, PIEPER, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas issued after the court's original order was filed. Although the circuit court\r\nindicated at the motion to reconsider hearing that it was not going to tell Jones\r\nspecifically how to write the check, its subsequent order did not specifically\r\naddress this issue. Therefore, we take this opportunity to emphasize the circuit\r\ncourt's finding that the only term or condition to the parties' settlement agreement\r\nwas that Hardwick would no longer be able to pursue Jones personally.\r\nAccordingly, Hardwick should be the only payee listed on the settlement check\r\nbecause no other terms or conditions to the settlement existed.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-393","title":"State v.

As to the proffer agreement, we find this evidence did not constitute improper\r\nbolstering because Horlbeck, not the State, was the first party to mention the\r\nproffer agreement and the witness' obligations pursuant to the agreement.\r\nFurthermore, the record does not indicate that the State vouched for or made any\r\nassurances of the witness' veracity. See State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 630, 545\r\nS.E.2d 805, 818 (2001) (\"A witness' testimony concerning a plea agreement with\r\nthe prosecution does not necessarily constitute improper [bolstering].\"); id.\r\n(\"Improper [bolstering] occurs when the prosecution places the government's\r\nprestige behind a witness by making explicit personal assurances of a witness'\r\nveracity, or where a prosecutor implicitly vouches for a witness' veracity by\r\nindicating information not presented to the jury supports the testimony.\" (citation\r\nomitted)); id. at 631, 545 S.E.2d at 819 (finding the prosecution did not improperly\r\nbolster the witness' testimony because the solicitor did not go into the details of the\r\nplea agreement until after the defense attacked the credibility of the witness on\r\ncross-examination and the solicitor did not imply special knowledge or express a\r\npersonal belief as to the truth of witness' testimony).\r\n\r\n2. As to the letter accompanying the proffer agreement, we find the issue\r\nunpreserved because Horlbeck expressly stated he had no objection to the State's\r\nmotion to enter the letter into evidence. See State v. Byers, 392 S.C. 438, 444, 710\r\nS.E.2d 55, 58 (2011) (\"For an objection to be preserved for appellate review, the\r\nobjection must be made at the time the evidence is presented . . . .\" (citation\r\nomitted)); State v.

We reverse and\r\nremand.\r\n\r\n1. Equitable Division\r\n\r\nWife argues the family court made numerous errors in its equitable division of the\r\nmarital estate that together resulted in a substantial unfairness to Wife. We agree.\r\n\r\nWe find the family court erred in placing a value of $1,161.13 on the parties'\r\ntimeshare and assigning this value to Wife. Wife listed the value of the Palace\r\nResorts timeshare as the same as its debt, and Husband acknowledged the debt.\r\n\r\nThe family court assigned the value of the parties' First National bank account with\r\na balance of $1,689.01 to Wife. This account held the security deposits from the\r\ntenants of the parties' rental properties. The family court's order appears to not\r\nrecognize that these funds would be returned to the tenants upon their vacating the\r\nproperties or would be transferred to the new owners of the rental properties once\r\nthey were sold.\r\n\r\nThe family court erred in ordering Husband to reimburse Wife for only half of the\r\ncosts of the prescriptions in the amount of $368.00. When Wife paid for medical\r\nexpenses, she filed claims with Husband's insurance provider, which then issued\r\nreimbursement checks to Husband because he was the named insured. Wife is\r\nentitled to all of the funds the insurance provider paid to reimburse the expenses\r\nshe paid.\r\n\r\nIn its order the family court provided Husband was to reimburse Wife $530.50 for\r\nproperty taxes. Wife submitted into evidence the receipt for $1,268.69 she paid for\r\nthe taxes on the marital home. Although we believe the family court intended to\r\ndivide the bill equally, it erred in the amount it ordered Husband to pay.\r\n\r\nThe family court erred in failing to consider the parties' payment to the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. On the date of filing, the First National business checking\r\naccount contained a balance of $27,680. The check for the parties' IRS payment of\r\n$18,507, which had been written before the filing, cleared the account on April 24,\r\n2009. Using the balance on the date of filing, the family court awarded Husband\r\n$20,340 from the checking account and ordered Wife to pay husband within 90\r\ndays of the filing of the order. It made no provision for the IRS payment, which\r\nwas a marital debt.\r\n\nThe family court appears to have failed to recognize Husband had already received\r\nsubstantial sums of money from the parties' money market account after the date of\r\nthe filing. Although Husband admitted in his affidavit Wife transferred\r\napproximately $10,000 from their money market account to him after the filing of\r\nthis action, the family court valued the account at the full amount as of the date of\r\nthe filing of this action and ordered Wife to pay Husband this amount.\r\n\r\nWe find the family court erred in failing to award Wife the undisputed items of\r\npersonal property on her Exhibit 18, which Husband conceded she could have. In\r\naddition, by giving Wife only the listed items and Husband the remaining items of\r\npersonal property, the family court awarded Husband a disproportionate amount of\r\nthe personal property.\r\n\r\nIn light of the above errors, we remand the matter to the family court for\r\nreconsideration of its equitable division of the marital estate. Although we do not\r\nnecessarily find reversible error in Wife's remaining issues, the family court may\r\nreconsider these issues on remand.\r\n\r\n2. Attorney's Fees\r\n\r\nBased on our remand of the equitable division issue, we reverse and remand the\r\nissue of attorney's fees as well. See Eason v. Eason, 384 S.C. 473, 482, 682 S.E.2d\r\n804, 808 (2009) (holding the family court should reconsider the issue of attorney's\r\nfees on remand based on the appellate court's disposition of another issue on\r\nappeal).

The jury awarded actual and punitive damages in favor of\r\nLarry and actual damages in favor of his parents for Larry's medical bills. After\r\nboth sides filed post-trial motions, the trial court entered separate judgments in\r\nfavor of Larry and his parents. Alpine Towers appeals the trial court's decision to\r\ndeny its motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict\r\n(JNOV) as to actual and punitive damages, and its motion for a new trial due to an\r\nalleged error as to apportionment. Larry appeals the trial court's ruling requiring\r\nhim to elect between his three causes of action. We affirm the denial of Alpine\r\nTowers' motions. However, we hold the trial court incorrectly interpreted the\r\njury's verdict and erred in requiring Larry to elect. We remand to the trial court\r\nwith instructions to enter judgment in Larry's favor against Alpine Towers in the\r\namount of $3,400,500.00 actual damages and $1,110,000.00 punitive damages.1\r\n\r\n       I.      Facts\r\n\r\nOn May 5, 2006, the senior students at Fort Mill High School (Fort Mill)\r\nparticipated in a spring fling recreational field day. During field day, Larry fell\r\nmore than twenty feet from the climbing tower to the ground. When he hit the\r\nground, Larry broke a vertebra and was rendered a permanent paraplegic. He was\r\nseventeen.\r\n\r\nAlpine Towers originally sold the climbing tower to Carowinds amusement park\r\nnear Charlotte, North Carolina. Fort Mill bought the tower from Carowinds in July\r\n2004 and hired Alpine Towers to move it, install it, and train Fort Mill's faculty to\r\nsafely use it. Fort Mill's contract with Alpine Towers identifies Alpine Towers as\r\n\"seller\" and provides: \"Installation includes all hardware, materials, . . . labor, . . .\r\ndesign work, . . . and staff training.\" The wooden climbing tower is fifty feet tall,\r\nhas three sides, and is shaped liked an hourglass. The central safety feature of any\r\n\r\n\r\n1   The judgment in favor of Larry's parents is not affected by this appeal.\r\n\nclimbing tower is the belay system.2 Alpine Towers designed the belay system on\r\nthis climbing tower to include four participants—the climber, a primary belayer, a\r\nback-up belayer, and a faculty supervisor. The system requires the climber to wear\r\na harness, which is secured to a climbing rope. The rope passes through a pulley at\r\nthe top of the tower and down to a belay device secured to the ground at the base\r\nof the tower. The rope is threaded through the belay device, which uses bends in\r\nthe rope to create friction to control the speed at which the rope passes through the\r\ndevice. As the climber ascends, the belayer guides the rope through the belay\r\ndevice to keep the rope taut. If the climber falls from the tower while climbing, the\r\nbelayer uses the friction the belay device creates on the rope to keep the rope from\r\npassing back through the device, and thus protects the climber from falling all the\r\nway to the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter a successful climb, or in the event the climber falls before completing the\r\nclimb, the belayer lowers the climber to the ground in a controlled fashion by\r\nguiding the rope back through the belay device. The friction created on the rope\r\nallows the belayer to control the speed of the climber's descent.3 Because of the\r\nhourglass shape of the tower, a climber being lowered to the ground by the belayer\r\nis suspended in air, away from the side of the tower.\r\n\r\nAshley Sexton, a senior at Fort Mill, served as Larry's primary belayer. Fort Mill\r\ntrained Ashley to belay as a part of the Junior ROTC program. Larry had never\r\nbeen trained in belaying or climbing, but successfully climbed to the top of the\r\ntower. Ashley testified that while she was lowering Larry to the ground \"the rope .\r\n. . got[] tight in the [belay device] almost as if it were stuck\" and would not move.\r\nNeither Ashley nor anyone at Fort Mill had been taught what to do if the rope\r\nbecame stuck in the belay device. When Ashley tried to free the rope, she lost the\r\nassistance of the device, was unable to control the rope, and Larry fell more than\r\ntwenty feet to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Alpine Towers' instruction manual defines \"belay\" as \"the rope or technique . . .\r\nthat is used to protect a climber from falling to the ground.\" See also Merriam-\r\nWebster Collegiate Dictionary 111 (11th ed. 2004) (defining belay as \"the securing\r\nof a person or a safety rope to an anchor point (as during mountain climbing)\").\r\n3 Alpine Towers' CEO explained that \"not very much\" strength is required to hold a\r\nclimber in the air because the weight is transferred through the belay device to the\r\nrope attached to the ground, so that a lightweight belayer can easily lower even a\r\nheavy climber.\r\n\nAlpine Towers designed the belay system on the climbing tower and trained Fort\r\nMill's faculty how to use it. Alpine Towers provided no notice or warning to Fort\r\nMill's faculty that the climbing rope could get stuck in the belay device it designed\r\ninto the system. Alpine Towers also provided no training or instruction on how the\r\nbelayer or faculty supervisor should handle the situation if it did. Alpine Towers\r\nchose not to incorporate into the design a readily available, automatically locking\r\nbelay device Larry's experts testified would have stopped Larry's fall. Alpine\r\nTowers did not train Fort Mill's faculty to require the faculty supervisor to stand\r\ndirectly beside the belayer, which Alpine Towers admitted at trial should always be\r\ndone to ensure that proper procedures were followed in the climb and to assist the\r\nbelayers in the event of a situation like the one that resulted in Larry's fall. When\r\nLarry fell, no back-up belayer was present, and no faculty supervisor was close\r\nenough to assist Ashley.\r\n\r\n    II.       Procedural History\r\n\r\nAll of Larry's damages were caused by the broken back he suffered as a result of\r\nhis fall. Larry asserted three causes of action presenting three alternative theories\r\nof Alpine Towers' liability for those damages: (1) Alpine Towers was strictly liable\r\nfor the manufacture and sale of a defective and unreasonably dangerous product;\r\n(2) Alpine Towers negligently designed the climbing tower without adequate\r\nsafety equipment, instructions, and warnings;4 and (3) Alpine Towers was\r\nnegligent in failing to properly train Fort Mill's faculty on how to safely use the\r\nclimbing tower, particularly in failing to train the faculty to teach student belayers\r\nto safely use the belay system.\r\n\r\nLarry also filed suit against Ashley for negligence. Larry's parents filed suit\r\nagainst Alpine Towers and Ashley for Larry's medical bills. Larry and his parents\r\nsettled with Fort Mill before filing suit and dismissed Ashley as a defendant before\r\ntrial. The jury returned a verdict for Larry on each cause of action. It awarded\r\n$500.00 for strict liability,5 $900,000.00 in actual damages and $160,000.00 in\r\n\r\n4 Because Alpine Towers did the \"design work\" for the installation of the tower at\r\nFort Mill, Larry's negligent design theory includes allegations of negligence in\r\nfailing to design the tower to meet the specific safety needs of Fort Mill.\r\n5The jury originally returned a verdict on the strict liability cause of action in favor\r\nof Larry, but with zero damages. After the trial court instructed the jury that it\r\nmust either award damages to Larry or find in favor of Alpine Towers, it returned a\r\n$500.00 award.\r\n\npunitive damages for negligent design of the tower, and $2,500,000.00 in actual\r\ndamages and $950,000.00 in punitive damages for Alpine Tower's negligence in\r\ntraining Fort Mill's faculty. The jury also returned a verdict for Larry's parents for\r\n$240,000.00 in actual damages.\r\n\r\nAlpine Towers filed a post-trial motion seeking (1) judgment notwithstanding the\r\nverdict as to all causes of action and punitive damages, (2) a new trial, (3) an order\r\nrequiring Larry to elect between the three causes of action, (4) set-off of the\r\nsettlement paid by Fort Mill, and (5) apportionment under the Contribution Among\r\nJoint Tortfeasors Act. The trial court denied the JNOV, new trial, and\r\napportionment motions. The court required Larry to elect between his causes of\r\naction and ordered that the settlement from Fort Mill be set-off against Larry's\r\nrecovery from Alpine Towers. Larry also filed a post-trial motion asking the trial\r\ncourt to enter judgment in the cumulative amount of the damage awards rather than\r\nrequire him to elect. The court denied Larry's motion and ordered that judgment be\r\nentered in the amount of $2,500,000.00 in actual damages and $950,000.00 in\r\npunitive damages on the negligent training cause of action.\r\n\r\n   III.        Alpine Towers' Appeal\r\n\r\n          A.     Directed Verdict and JNOV—Actual Damages\r\n\r\n\"In ruling on motions for directed verdict and JNOV, the trial court is required to\r\nview the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the\r\nlight most favorable to the party opposing the motions.\" McMillan v. Oconee\r\nMem'l Hosp., Inc., 367 S.C. 559, 564, 626 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2006). \"When we\r\nreview a trial judge's . . . denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, we\r\nreverse only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling is\r\ngoverned by an error of law.\" Austin v. Stokes-Craven Holding Corp., 387 S.C.\r\n22, 42, 691 S.E.2d 135, 145 (2010).\r\n\r\nIn its motions for directed verdict and JNOV, Alpine Towers contested all liability\r\nissues, including the sufficiency of the evidence supporting each of Larry's causes\r\nof action. In its Statement of Issues on Appeal, Alpine Towers contends only that\r\nthe trial court should have granted its motions because the chain of causation was\r\nbroken as a matter of law. Specifically, Alpine Towers contends the chain of\r\ncausation was broken by (1) \"the intervening and superseding negligent acts of\r\nFort Mill High School and Ashley Sexton in failing to follow the warnings,\r\ndirections, and instructions for proper use of the Tower\" and (2) \"the intervening\r\nand superseding negligent acts of Fort Mill High School in failing to undertake its\r\n\nindependent duty to properly supervise its students.\" However, because both Larry\r\nand Alpine Towers address in their briefs the sufficiency of the evidence\r\nsupporting each of Larry's causes of action, we do as well. We find ample\r\nevidence to support the jury's verdict as to each. We also find ample evidence that\r\nAshley's negligence and any negligence by Fort Mill was foreseeable to Alpine\r\nTowers, and thus their negligence does not break the chain of causation from\r\nAlpine Towers' tortious conduct.\r\n\r\n             1.    Strict Liability\r\n\r\nIn his strict liability theory, Larry focused on Alpine Towers' design of the\r\nclimbing tower to incorporate a belay device called Trango Jaws. The Trango\r\nJaws is operated manually and requires the belayer to properly position the\r\nclimbing rope in the Trango Jaws to create the friction necessary to stop the rope\r\nand then control the rate of the climber's descent. Larry's expert witness in\r\nbiomechanics and sports safety, Gerald George, Ph.D., testified that the Trango\r\nJaws relies on the absence of human error to safely belay a climber. He explained\r\nthat it was feasible to use an alternative design for the climbing tower\r\nincorporating a belay device called a GriGri.6\r\n\r\nThe GriGri is a mechanical device that, when properly threaded, does not rely on\r\nthe absence of human error. In the event the belayer loses control of the rope, the\r\nGriGri automatically stops the rope, and thus protects the climber from falling to\r\nthe ground. Larry's climbing wall safety expert, Dan Hague, testified that the\r\nGriGri \"locks up automatically, . . . you're not relying on the actions of the belayer\r\nto lock the device up.\" He emphasized that the automatic stopping feature of the\r\nGriGri is particularly important when students are belaying climbers because of the\r\nheightened likelihood of human error. To account for this foreseeable risk, Hague\r\n\"always uses the GriGri with kids.\" In Hague's opinion, \"this injury would not\r\nhave occurred had a GriGri been in use that day.\" As a normal part of its business,\r\nAlpine Towers sells the GriGri for a variety of uses, including on its own climbing\r\ntowers. Dr. George testified that without incorporating a \"fail-safe\" belay device\r\nsuch as the GriGri into the design of a climbing tower used for students, the\r\nclimbing tower is defective and unreasonably dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 The GriGri costs approximately $75, and the Trango Jaws costs approximately\r\n$24. The CEO of Alpine Towers testified the difference in cost is an\r\n\"inconsequential amount of money.\"\r\n\nAlpine Towers' argument that the evidence in support of Larry's strict liability\r\ncause of action is insufficient is that there is no evidence the tower \"was in a\r\ndefective condition, unreasonably dangerous to the user . . . when it left the hands\r\nof the defendant.\" See Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 539, 462 S.E.2d\r\n321, 326 (Ct. App. 1995). However, the evidence discussed above amply supports\r\nthe jury's finding that it was. Moreover, the GriGri qualifies as a \"reasonable\r\nalternative design\" as required under Branham v. Ford Motor Co., 390 S.C. 203,\r\n225, 701 S.E.2d 5, 16 (2010). The trial court correctly denied Alpine Towers'\r\ndirected verdict and JNOV motions as to strict liability.\r\n\r\n             2.     Negligent Design\r\n\r\n\"A negligence theory imposes the additional burden on a plaintiff 'of\r\ndemonstrating the defendant . . . failed to exercise due care in some respect, and,\r\nunlike strict liability, the focus is on the conduct of the seller or manufacturer, and\r\nliability is determined according to fault.'\" Branham, 390 S.C. at 210, 701 S.E.2d\r\nat 9 (quoting Bragg, 319 S.C. at 539, 462 S.E.2d at 326). In his negligent design\r\ntheory, Larry also relied on the evidence that Alpine Towers should have used the\r\nGriGri in designing a climbing tower to be used by students, particularly student\r\nbelayers. However, in addition to evidence that the tower was defective and\r\nunreasonably dangerous without the GriGri, Larry presented evidence that Alpine\r\nTowers failed to exercise reasonable care in the design. Specifically, Larry\r\npresented evidence that Alpine Towers conducted a ten-year study ending in 1999\r\nthat concluded the majority of accidents on its climbing towers were caused by\r\nhuman error, specifically belayers dropping their climbers. Despite this\r\nknowledge, Alpine Towers chose not to design for human error by including a\r\nbelay device that would automatically lock and prevent the rope from passing back\r\nthrough the device, thus preventing a fall to the ground such as the one Larry\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Larry's experts testified to several breaches of Alpine Towers' duty of\r\nreasonable care in designing the warnings and instructions on the tower. In\r\nparticular, Larry's experts testified faculty supervisors should be instructed to\r\nremain within reaching distance of active belay ropes. Alpine Towers' employee\r\nJohn Mordhurst conceded this instruction was necessary. Mordhurst testified a\r\nfaculty supervisor should be at each belay point, and \"[t]hey should be . . . in a\r\nposition to intervene to grab a rope, . . . so they should be right next to the belayers\r\nand belay monitors.\" In the 1997 edition of Alpine Towers' instruction manual for\r\nthe climbing tower, the section entitled \"The Belay System\" includes this\r\nrequirement: \"[P]rograms should require staff to check the belayer's and climber's\r\n\nsystems prior to climbing and lowering; . . . the staff member should stand directly\r\nbeside the climber.\" However, Alpine Towers omitted the statement containing\r\nthis requirement from the 2004 edition of the instruction manual, the edition it\r\nprovided to Fort Mill.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Dr. George testified Alpine Towers should have placed end user\r\nwarnings on the tower for someone like Larry, who climbed for the first time\r\nwithout any instruction, and Ashley, who never received an instruction manual.\r\nDr. George explained this was necessary to ensure an inexperienced climber such\r\nas Larry will know the dangers of climbing and understand how the belay system\r\nis designed to work before deciding to begin a climb. This evidence amply\r\nsupports the jury's finding that Alpine Towers failed to exercise reasonable care in\r\ndesigning a defective and unreasonably dangerous climbing tower. Therefore, the\r\ntrial court was correct to deny Alpine Towers' motions as to negligent design.\r\n\r\n             3.    Negligent Training\r\n\r\nIn his negligent training theory, Larry presented evidence that despite knowing\r\nFort Mill's faculty would not be doing most of the belaying, but rather would be\r\nteaching students to belay, Alpine Towers did not instruct the faculty how to teach\r\nbelaying. Larry proved several key facts in support of this claim. First, Alpine\r\nTowers uses a written syllabus when it conducts classes to teach adults how to\r\nbelay. However, it did not provide the syllabus to Fort Mill to enable Fort Mill to\r\neffectively teach students. Second, the belay system designed by Alpine Towers\r\nrelies on a faculty supervisor to ensure the students are properly belaying the\r\nclimbers. In addition to Mordhurst's testimony as to where the faculty supervisor\r\nshould be positioned, the CEO of Alpine Towers, Joe Lackey, testified, \"the staff\r\nmember should stand directly behind the climber, . . . not thirty feet away.\" The\r\nobvious purpose of this requirement is to enable the supervisor to keep the students\r\nfrom making errors and, if they do, to prevent the tragic consequences Larry\r\nsuffered. However, Larry presented evidence that Alpine Towers did not teach this\r\nto the faculty at Fort Mill. One member of Fort Mill's faculty who attended the\r\nAlpine Towers course testified he did not recall being told that a faculty supervisor\r\nshould stand beside the belayer. When asked why the requirement that \"the staff\r\nmember should stand directly beside the climber\" in the 1997 instruction manual\r\nwas not included in the 2004 edition, Lackey responded, \"I'm not sure why it was\r\ntaken out.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, despite knowing that Fort Mill would be teaching students to belay and\r\nthat students were more susceptible to making belaying errors than adults, Alpine\r\n\nTowers did not teach Fort Mill that it should test the students' competency before\r\nallowing them to belay a climber. Hague testified \"as a matter of course in my\r\nindustry, participants are tested,\" including whether they are \"able to . . . belay in a\r\ncompetent manner, catch falls, lower somebody . . . off a climb.\" He explained:\r\n\r\n             In a climbing setting you have to be able to assess\r\n             whether or not the group as a whole is making progress. .\r\n             . . Since we're talking about life safety here and not about\r\n             math, if someone is not learning at the same rate as the\r\n             group, you can't just move to the next topic. You have to\r\n             slow down. You have to be able to address that one\r\n             person until everybody's caught up. In addition, at the\r\n             end of the training, there needs to be some type of\r\n             discrete competency test.\r\n\r\nAlpine Towers has several employees who serve on the standards committee for\r\nthe Association for Challenge Courses Technology, which Lackey called a\r\n\"climbing society.\" Despite evidence of this standard climbing industry practice,\r\nAlpine Towers did not teach Fort Mill that it needed to test, how the tests should be\r\nconducted, or what particular skills should be tested.7\r\n\r\nThis evidence provides ample support for the jury's finding that Alpine Towers\r\nwas negligent in failing to properly train the Fort Mill faculty on how to safely use\r\nthe tower, and thus the trial court properly denied Alpine Towers' motions as to\r\nnegligent training.\r\n\r\nWe affirm the trial court's decision to deny Alpine Towers' motions for directed\r\nverdict and JNOV as to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting all three of\r\nLarry's causes of action.\r\n\r\n             4.     Intervening Causation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 Ashley testified she was not given a written test, but was required to do a\r\n\"demonstration\" and be watched by a faculty member to make sure she \"knew how\r\nto do it.\" There was no evidence, however, that Alpine Towers took any steps to\r\nensure Fort Mill gave an adequate test of her competency. In fact, Alpine Towers'\r\ninstruction manual says only that students \"will demonstrate proficiency in\r\nbelaying before being permitted to belay.\"\r\n\nThe test for whether a subsequent negligent act by a third party breaks the chain of\r\ncausation to insulate a prior tortfeasor from liability is whether the subsequent\r\nactor's negligence was reasonably foreseeable. \"For an intervening act to break the\r\ncausal link and insulate the tortfeasor from further liability, the intervening act\r\nmust be unforeseeable.\" McKnight v. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 385 S.C. 380, 387, 684\r\nS.E.2d 566, 569 (Ct. App. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The trial\r\ncourt properly charged the jury as follows:\r\n\r\n             The chain of causation between a defendant's negligence\r\n             and the injury itself may be broken by the independent\r\n             intervening acts or omissions of another person over\r\n             whom the defendant had no control. In order to decide\r\n             whether an intervening act breaks the chain of causation,\r\n             you must determine whether the intervening act or\r\n             omission was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. If\r\n             the intervening act or omission was a probable\r\n             consequence of the defendant's negligence, the defendant\r\n             is responsible for the plaintiff's injuries. If, however, you\r\n             find that the intervening act or omission was not\r\n             foreseeable, the defendant is not liable.\r\n\r\nBy finding in favor of Larry, the jury necessarily found the actions of Ashley and\r\nFort Mill were foreseeable, and therefore the chain of causation was not broken to\r\ninsulate Alpine Towers from liability. There is ample evidence to support this\r\nfinding. See Cody P. v. Bank of Am., N.A., 395 S.C. 611, 621-22, 720 S.E.2d 473,\r\n479 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"Only in rare or exceptional cases may the question of\r\nproximate cause be decided as a matter of law. . . . If there may be a fair difference\r\nof opinion regarding whose act proximately caused the injury, then the question of\r\nproximate cause must be submitted to the jury.\" (internal quotation marks and\r\ncitations omitted)).\r\n\r\nLarry presented evidence that Alpine Towers knew Fort Mill would be using high\r\nschool students to belay climbers, that adolescents are more susceptible to belaying\r\nerrors than adults, and that Alpine Towers conducted a study concluding human\r\nerror is the most common cause of falls to the ground from climbing towers. Dr.\r\nGeorge testified Alpine Towers \"knew or should have known . . . of these risks.\"\r\nHe stated it was not merely foreseeable, but \"almost predictable,\" that high school\r\nstudents would not follow proper procedures for belaying climbers. Hague\r\ntestified that he has trained \"thousands and thousands\" of people in belaying over\r\nfifteen years, including \"many hundreds\" of adolescents, he takes different\r\n\napproaches to training depending on the maturity level of the belaying student,\r\nadolescents \"routinely do not\" follow procedures, and Alpine Towers \"could easily\r\nforesee that adolescents aren't going to follow all the procedures.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, the primary risk associated with the use of a climbing tower is that the\r\nbelayer, back-up, or faculty supervisor might make an error belaying the climber.\r\nEach of Larry's theories of recovery focused on the allegation that Alpine Towers\r\nfailed to design for and train against human error in belaying and the supervision\r\nof students belaying. This is not a \"rare or exceptional\" case in which the issue of\r\nproximate cause may be decided as a matter of law. Alpine Towers' argument that\r\n\"the intervening and superseding negligent acts of Fort Mill High School and\r\nAshley Sexton\" broke the chain of causation fails because there is ample evidence\r\nin the record that precisely the same human error that resulted in Larry's injury was\r\nnot only foreseeable to Alpine Towers, but was actually foreseen. Accordingly, we\r\nfind the trial court properly submitted the question of proximate cause to the jury,\r\nand we affirm its decision to deny Alpine Towers' motions for directed verdict and\r\nJNOV as to intervening causation.\r\n\r\n         B.     Directed Verdict and JNOV—Punitive Damages\r\n\r\nAlpine Towers also argues the trial court erred in denying its directed verdict and\r\nJNOV motions as to punitive damages. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"When ruling on a directed verdict motion as to punitive damages, the circuit court\r\nmust view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom\r\nin the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" Hollis v. Stonington Dev.,\r\nLLC, 394 S.C. 383, 393-94, 714 S.E.2d 904, 909 (Ct. App. 2011) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). This court applies the same standard as the circuit court.\r\n394 S.C. at 394, 714 S.E.2d at 910. \"The issue of punitive damages must be\r\nsubmitted to the jury if more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the\r\nevidence as to whether the defendant's behavior was reckless . . . .\" Mishoe v.\r\nQHG of Lake City, Inc., 366 S.C. 195, 201, 621 S.E.2d 363, 366 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\"Recklessness implies the doing of a negligent act knowingly; it is a conscious\r\nfailure to exercise due care. If a person of ordinary reason and prudence would\r\nhave been conscious of the probability of resulting injury, the law says the person\r\nis reckless . . . .\" Berberich v. Jack, 392 S.C. 278, 287, 709 S.E.2d 607, 612 (2011)\r\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nLarry made two separate claims for punitive damages against Alpine Towers: (1)\r\nfor reckless behavior in its design of the climbing tower and (2) for reckless\r\n\nbehavior in its failure to properly train the Fort Mill faculty on how to safely use\r\nthe climbing tower. The jury awarded punitive damages on each claim, so we\r\naddress each independently.\r\n\r\nAs to Larry's claim for punitive damages based on Alpine Towers' reckless\r\nbehavior in designing the tower, Larry presented evidence that Alpine Towers\r\nknew the majority of accidents occurring on its climbing towers were caused by\r\nhuman error by belayers and back-up belayers. Mordhurst conceded that of the\r\nthree options for a belay device in the design of a climbing tower, \"the GriGri has\r\n[the] highest likelihood of arresting the fall\" of a climber and thus protecting him\r\nfrom falling to the ground if the belayer loses control of the rope. Lackey testified\r\nthe additional cost of a GriGri is \"inconsequential.\" Alpine Towers' decision to\r\ndesign its climbing tower to incorporate the Trango Jaws instead of the GriGri\r\nunder these circumstances is sufficient evidence Alpine Towers was \"conscious of\r\nthe probability of resulting injury\" from its negligence, and therefore was reckless.\r\nThe trial court was correct to submit the issue of punitive damages for reckless\r\ndesign to the jury. 392 S.C. at 287, 709 S.E.2d at 612.\r\n\r\nAs to Larry's claim for punitive damages based on Alpine Towers' reckless\r\nbehavior in failing to properly train the Fort Mill faculty, in addition to the\r\nevidence discussed above, Alpine Towers knew Fort Mill would be using student\r\nbelayers, whom Alpine Towers knew to be less attentive to following procedures\r\nand more susceptible to errors in belaying than adults. Nevertheless, Alpine\r\nTowers (1) chose not to train Fort Mill's faculty to teach others, particularly\r\nstudents; (2) did not include in the training materials given to Fort Mill the syllabus\r\nAlpine Towers uses to teach belaying; (3) removed from its training manual the\r\nspecific instruction for faculty supervisors to \"stand directly behind the climber\";\r\n(4) did not teach Fort Mill to follow the industry practice of testing belayers on the\r\nbasic skills of belaying before allowing them to belay climbers; and (5) did not\r\ninform Fort Mill it had the option of an automatically locking belay device such as\r\nthe GriGri to compensate for the greater risk posed by the use of student belayers.\r\nThis also is sufficient evidence Alpine Towers was \"conscious of the probability of\r\nresulting injury\" from its negligence, and therefore was reckless. The trial court\r\nwas correct to submit the issue of punitive damages for reckless training to the\r\njury. Id.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the trial court's decision to deny Alpine Towers' directed\r\nverdict and JNOV motions as to punitive damages.\r\n\r\n          C.    Apportionment of Fort Mill's Fault\r\n\nAlpine Towers contends it is entitled to a new trial because the trial court did not\r\nallow the jury to consider the fault of Fort Mill when it apportioned fault under\r\nsection 15-38-15 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011).8 However, our ruling\r\naffirming the jury's award of punitive damages makes it unnecessary to address\r\nthis issue as the apportionment statute \"does not apply to a defendant whose\r\nconduct is determined to be . . . reckless.\" § 15-38-15(F).\r\n\r\n    IV.   Larry's Appeal\r\n\r\nLarry appeals the trial court's post-trial ruling entering judgment in his favor in the\r\namount of $2,500,000.00 in actual damages and $950,000.00 in punitive damages.\r\nHe contends the trial court erred in interpreting the verdicts as \"three awards\" and\r\nrequiring him to elect which cause of action would be his remedy. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"Election of remedies involves a choice between different forms of redress\r\nafforded by law for the same injury . . . . It is the act of choosing between\r\ninconsistent remedies allowed by law on the same set of facts.\" Taylor v.\r\nMedenica, 324 S.C. 200, 218, 479 S.E.2d 35, 44-45 (1996). Larry asserted three\r\ncauses of action, but sought only one remedy—damages—for only one injury—a\r\nbroken back. When a plaintiff seeks only one remedy, there is nothing to elect.\r\nSee Adams v. Grant, 292 S.C. 581, 586, 358 S.E.2d 142, 144 (Ct. App. 1986)\r\n(\"Where a plaintiff presents two causes of action because he is uncertain of which\r\nhe will be able to prove, but seeks a single recovery, he will not be required to\r\nelect.\").\r\n\r\nThe trial court in this case recognized that Larry's three causes of action sought\r\nonly one remedy. In its post-trial order, the court wrote:\r\n\r\n              Here, both products liability claims and the negligence\r\n              claim represent three theories for recovery for the same\r\n              injury and damages—personal injuries sustained by\r\n              [Larry] in his fall. [Larry] had one fall and all his injury\r\n              and damages flow therefrom regardless of the number of\r\n              acts of omission or commission of [Alpine Towers].\r\n\r\n8 After the jury's verdict as to liability, the trial court required it to apportion fault\r\nbetween Alpine Towers and Ashley. The jury determined that Ashley was 60% at\r\nfault and Alpine Towers was 40% at fault. The jury was not asked to consider the\r\nfault of Fort Mill.\r\n\nBecause Larry sought only one remedy, the doctrine of election of remedies does\r\nnot apply. \"As its name states, the doctrine applies to the election of 'remedies' not\r\nthe election of 'verdicts.'\" Austin, 387 S.C. at 57, 691 S.E.2d at 153 (defining a\r\n\"'remedy' as '[t]he means by which . . . the violation of a right is . . . compensated.'\"\r\n(quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1163 (5th ed. 1979))).\r\n\r\nThis court addressed a similar situation in Creach v. Sara Lee Corp., 331 S.C. 461,\r\n502 S.E.2d 923 (Ct. App. 1998). The plaintiff in Creach \"bit down on a hard\r\nsubstance in a steak biscuit made by Sara Lee Corporation,\" \"experience[d] severe\r\npain,\" and had to undergo \"extensive dental work.\" 331 S.C. at 463, 502 S.E.2d at\r\n923-24. She sued Sara Lee and others \"alleging negligence, breach of warranty,\r\nand strict liability.\" 331 S.C. at 463, 502 S.E.2d at 923. After a verdict for Creach\r\non all three causes of action, Sara Lee asked the trial judge to require her to elect\r\nher remedy. The judge refused to do so, and this court affirmed, holding \"while\r\nthe complaint stated three different causes of action, only one recovery was sought\r\nand only one recovery was awarded. Under these circumstances, no election was\r\nrequired.\" 331 S.C. at 464, 502 S.E.2d at 924 (citing Taylor, 324 S.C. at 218, 479\r\nS.E.2d at 44-45). Creach supports our holding that because Larry sought one\r\nremedy for one injury, the trial court erred in requiring him to elect.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the trial court and this court must ensure that Larry does not receive\r\na double recovery. See Collins Music Co. v. Smith, 332 S.C. 145, 147, 503 S.E.2d\r\n481, 482 (Ct. App. 1998) (\"It is well settled in this state that there can be no double\r\nrecovery for a single wrong and a plaintiff may recover his actual damages only\r\nonce.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The determination of whether a verdict\r\ngrants a double recovery begins with the trial court's responsibility to interpret the\r\nverdict in order to ascertain the jury's intent. The trial court interpreted the jury's\r\nverdict in this case to be \"three awards,\" and therefore \"inconsistent\" because it\r\nallowed Larry a double recovery. We find the trial court erred in its interpretation\r\nof the verdict.\r\n\r\nThe error arose from the verdict form. Because Larry asserted three causes of\r\naction, the trial court correctly fashioned the verdict form to require the jury to\r\nwrite its verdict for each cause of action. However, because Larry sought only one\r\nremedy—damages—and because the amount of those damages could not vary\r\nfrom one cause of action to another, the trial court should have required the jury to\r\nwrite one amount for Larry's actual damages, and should not have permitted the\r\njury to write a damages amount for each of the three causes of action. The use of\r\n\nthe three blanks for damages in the verdict form left the verdict ambiguous as to\r\nthe amount of damages the jury intended to award.\r\n\r\nTo determine the jury's intent in an ambiguous verdict, the court should consider\r\nthe entire proceedings, focusing on the events and circumstances that reasonably\r\nindicate what the jury intended. See Durst v. S. Ry. Co., 161 S.C. 498, 506, 159\r\nS.E. 844, 848 (1931) (stating \"the construction of a verdict should, and can, depend\r\nupon, not only the language used by the jury, but other things occurring in the trial\r\nmay be, and should be, properly regarded in determining what a jury intended to\r\nfind\"); Howard v. Kirton, 144 S.C. 89, 101, 142 S.E. 39, 43 (1928) (stating it is\r\n\"the duty of the trial judge to decide what the verdict meant, and, in reaching his\r\nconclusion thereabout, it was his duty to take into consideration not only the\r\nlanguage of the verdict, but all the matters that occurred in the course of the trial\");\r\nsee also 75B Am. Jur. 2d Trial § 1545 (2007) (\"In the interpretation of an\r\nambiguous verdict, the court may make use of anything in the proceedings that\r\nserves to show with certainty what the jury intended, and, for this purpose,\r\nreference may be had, for example, to the pleadings, the evidence, the admissions\r\nof the parties, the instructions, or the forms of verdict submitted.\").\r\n\r\nTo correctly interpret the verdict in this case, the trial court was required to\r\nconsider several indications of the jury's intention as to damages. First, the court\r\nshould have considered its own conclusion that Larry sought only one remedy—\r\ndamages—and that all of his damages flowed from the broken back resulting from\r\nhis fall from the tower. Thus, it was not possible for the damages to vary from one\r\ncause of action to another. Second, after the jury returned the verdicts, Larry made\r\na motion asking the court to inquire of the jury whether it meant for the damages\r\nawarded to be cumulative. Alpine Towers did not object to the request. While the\r\njury was still in the courtroom, the judge asked the forelady if the jury intended the\r\nverdicts to be cumulative.\r\n\r\n             The Court: . . . Before you leave, I've got one last\r\n             question. On the three causes of action you have\r\n             awarded different amounts of damages. . . . Was it the\r\n             jury's intention to award those cumulatively, that is they\r\n             add up to [$3.4 million and $500.00] . . . or did you\r\n             simply mean that the damages as to each cause of action\r\n             were to be separate . . . .\r\n\r\n             Forelady: Ask me that again.\r\n\n             ...\r\n\r\n             The Court: . . . You have ordered [$500.00] on one,\r\n             [$900,000.00] on one, and [$2.5 million] on one. Is it the\r\n             jury's intention that those are to be added, that is\r\n             cumulative, or is the jury's intention that as to each cause\r\n             of action that award applies only to that cause of action?\r\n\r\n             Forelady: It's cumulative.\r\n\r\n             The Court: Okay. How about . . . as to the punitive, you\r\n             had [$160,000.00] and [$950,000.00], which adds up . . .\r\n             to [$1.1 million] [sic]. Is it the same for that also?\r\n\r\n             Forelady: It's cumulative.\r\n\r\nThe trial court then asked each side separately if there was \"anything else before\r\nthe jury's dismissed?\" Both Larry and Alpine Towers answered that they had\r\nnothing further, and the trial court dismissed the jury.9\r\n\r\nIn the context that Larry sought, and could obtain, only one damages award for the\r\nsame injury, this dialogue adequately demonstrates the jury intended the damage\r\namounts written in the three blanks on the verdict form to be added together for a\r\ntotal award to Larry of $3,400,500.00 actual damages and $1,110,000.00 punitive\r\ndamages. However, there was more to indicate this was the jury's intention.\r\nDuring deliberations the jury sent a note to the court stating the jurors were\r\n\r\n9 The trial court found, and Alpine Towers argues on appeal, that Larry should\r\nhave sought further inquiry into the jury's intent and that his failure to do so\r\nforecloses his argument that the jury intended the verdicts to be cumulative. We\r\ndisagree. Larry is the party who initially asked the court to inquire whether the\r\njury intended the verdict to be cumulative. Larry's counsel stated to the court \"you\r\ncan either inquire of the jury here in the courtroom or you can send them out,\r\nwhatever you're comfortable with.\" Alpine Towers' counsel stated, \"I wouldn't\r\noppose that request.\" The trial court then made the decision to ask only the\r\nforelady. The forelady's answer, \"It's cumulative,\" was the answer Larry was\r\nlooking for, and therefore Larry had no reason to inquire further on that subject.\r\nAlpine Towers, who at that point did have reason to inquire further, said nothing.\r\nTherefore, to the extent the lack of further inquiry should be considered, we\r\nbelieve it should be held against Alpine Towers.\r\n\ndeadlocked as to whether to award $4.5 million or $5 million and asking for\r\nsuggestions. The court responded that it had no suggestions. The total amount of\r\ndamages awarded, including the amount awarded to Larry's parents, was $4.75\r\nmillion,10 which is between the two amounts listed in the note. Further, the court\r\nshould have considered that it gave the jury no basis on which to find different\r\ndamage awards on different causes of action. In fact, the only place in the\r\ndamages instruction where the court differentiated between the causes of action at\r\nall was to explain to the jury it may award punitive damages only on the\r\nnegligence theories of recovery.\r\n\r\nThis court has stated that \"it is the duty of the court to sustain verdicts when a\r\nlogical reason for reconciling them can be found.\" Daves v. Cleary, 355 S.C. 216,\r\n231, 584 S.E.2d 423, 430 (Ct. App. 2003). In fulfilling this duty, we may not\r\nsubstitute our judgment for that of the jury. See Lorick, 153 S.C. at 319, 150 S.E.\r\nat 792 (stating the court has a right to give \"effect to what the jury unmistakably\r\nfound\" but cannot \"invade the province of the jury\"). The jury's verdict in this case\r\nis readily reconciled as we have explained. We can discern no other way to\r\ninterpret the verdict consistent with the applicable law and the facts of this case,\r\nnor can we find in the record any reason to believe this interpretation does not\r\nreflect the intent of the jury. Moreover, during arguments on post-trial motions,\r\ncounsel for Alpine Towers explained to the trial court what he believed the jury\r\ndid:         Let me tell you what I think happened. . . . [When they\r\n             sent the note asking for suggestions,] they advised that\r\n             they had arrived at a general block of the amount of the\r\n             damages that they wanted to give to compensate Mr.\r\n             Keeter. What they then did because the verdict form is\r\n             listed in such a way that it says actual damages and\r\n             punitive damages leaving both blank that they went\r\n             through and parceled out the total amount of\r\n             compensatory damages that they wanted to award . . . .\r\n             And the damages for all three claims are identical . . . ,\r\n             there is no differentiation on the damages . . . . [T]hey\r\n\r\n\r\n10At the point of the trial when the jury sent this note, the court had not instructed\r\nthe jury it must award damages on the strict liability claim or find for the\r\ndefendant. Thus, the $500.00 damages awarded on that cause of action is not\r\nincluded in this figure.\r\n\n             arrived at a larger figure then they parceled it up to fill in\r\n             the blanks.11\r\n\r\nInterpreting the verdict based on \"all the matters that occurred in the course of the\r\ntrial,\" Howard, 144 S.C. at 101, 142 S.E. at 43, we disagree with the trial court and\r\nfind the jury did not make an \"inconsistent damages award.\" See 75B Am. Jur. 2d\r\nTrial § 1556 (2007) (\"In order for a verdict to be deemed inconsistent, there must\r\nbe inconsistencies within each independent action rather than between verdicts in\r\nseparate and distinct actions.\"). Rather, we find that the jury intended the amounts\r\nto be added together for a total verdict in Larry's favor of $3,400,500.00 actual\r\ndamages and $1,110,000.00 punitive damages. Accordingly, we hold the trial\r\ncourt erred in its interpretation of the verdicts and judgment should have been\r\nentered in the cumulative amount of actual and punitive damages the jury wrote on\r\nthe verdict form for each of Larry's causes of action.\r\n\r\n     V.      Conclusion\r\n\r\nFor the reasons explained above, we affirm the trial court's decision to deny Alpine\r\nTowers' motions for directed verdict, JNOV, and for a new trial. We reverse the\r\ntrial court's interpretation of the jury verdict and remand with instructions that\r\njudgment be entered against Alpine Towers in favor of Larry Keeter in the amount\r\nof $3,400,500.00 actual damages and $1,110,000.00 punitive damages.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: I concur with the majority as to Alpine Towers' appeal. As to\r\nLarry's appeal, I concur in result. I agree that this case does not involve the need to\r\nelect remedies or an inconsistent verdict. I write separately to clarify that\r\nquestioning the entire jury and then conforming the jury's verdict to the jury's\r\nintent are the best practices for ensuring a valid verdict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11In fairness to counsel, the statement was made as part of his argument that the\r\nverdicts were inconsistent. However, we believe the statement accurately explains\r\nwhy the jury put different damage amounts in different blanks.\r\n\nFirst, when a party raises a question about the jury's intent for the verdict, the best\r\npractice is to poll all of the jurors or allow the foreperson to answer the court's\r\nquestions after consulting with the entire jury. Lorick & Lowrance, Inc. v. Julius\r\nH. Walker Co., 153 S.C. 309, 314-15, 150 S.E. 789, 791 (1929). The need to\r\nclarify the jury's intent almost invariably arises when the language used on the\r\nverdict form is problematic. Without an inquiry of the remaining jurors,\r\nquestioning only the foreperson unnecessarily risks that the jury's precise intent\r\nwill remain unknown. This danger is heightened by the likelihood of arguments\r\nthat the foreperson misunderstood the court's questions or provided a response not\r\nreflecting the entire jury's intent.\r\n\r\nSecond, if the initial inquiry shows the jury's intent differs from what the jury\r\nwrote on the verdict form, the best practice is to either send the jury back to\r\nconform the verdict to the jury's intent or have the correction made in open court\r\nwith the jury's consent. Id. at 314-15, 150 S.E. at 791. After the jury is\r\ndischarged, the court may construe the verdict in a manner that diverges from the\r\nlanguage used by the jury only when the surrounding circumstances make the\r\njury's intent unmistakable and the court's construction reflects that intent. Id. at\r\n319-20, 150 S.E. at 792-93.\r\n\r\nI disagree with the majority's statement in footnote 9 that Larry had no reason to\r\nseek further inquiry of the jury's intent after the foreperson testified the actual and\r\npunitive damages amounts were cumulative. The movant has the most incentive to\r\nask the court to send the jury back to conform the verdict to the jury's intent or\r\nhave the correction made in open court with the jury's consent. These practices\r\nbest ensure the verdict reflects the jury's intent, and a verdict rendered in\r\naccordance with them is nearly impossible to attack by arguing the jury's intent is\r\nunclear. See Billups v. Leliuga, 303 S.C. 36, 39, 398 S.E.2d 75, 76 (Ct. App. 1990)\r\n(stating \"a jury verdict should be upheld when it is possible to do so and carry into\r\neffect the jury's clear intention,\" and holding the jury's intent was clear despite\r\n\"some confusion in the jury's initial written verdict\" because the foreperson\r\ntestified as to the jury's intent, the clerk published the jury's intent after the\r\nforeperson put the intent in writing, and the remaining jurors were polled to ensure\r\ntheir intent complied with the published intent); cf. Joiner v. Bevier, 155 S.C. 340,\r\n351, 354-55, 152 S.E. 652, 656-57 (1930) (stating the court has the \"duty to\r\nenforce a verdict, not to make it\" and holding that despite some initial difficulty in\r\ngetting the jury to render a verdict proper in form, the jury's intent was \"entirely\r\nclear\" when the verdict after a second set of deliberations \"corresponded exactly\"\r\nwith the special findings obtained prior to sending the jury back to deliberate).\r\nMoreover, if the above practices are not used, the movant risks having to meet its\r\n\nburden of establishing that the jury's intent is absolutely clear using solely the\r\nsurrounding circumstances of the case. Lorick, 153 S.C. at 319-20, 150 S.E. at\r\n792-93. Here, the jury did not conform the verdict to its intent, nor was the jury\r\npolled.12 Therefore, because the burden to establish the jury's intent remains on\r\nLarry as the movant,13 he must establish the jury's intent was unmistakable based\r\non the surrounding circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nDespite the uphill battle undertaken in this case to establish the jury's intent, I agree\r\nto remand for an entry of judgment against Alpine Towers in favor of Larry for\r\n$3,400,500.00 actual damages and $1,110,000.00 punitive damages. The\r\nsurrounding circumstances of this case make the jury's intent unmistakable. Taken\r\ntogether, the forelady's testimony, the jury note, the jury charge, the total damages\r\nawarded, and the single injury alleged can lead to only one conclusion: the jury\r\nintended to award Larry $3,400,000 in actual damages14 and $1,110,000 in\r\npunitive damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12In fairness to Larry, he asked the trial court to determine whether the verdict in\r\nhis favor was intended to be cumulative. He suggested to the trial court, \"[E]ither\r\ninquire of the jury . . . in the courtroom or . . . send them out.\" The trial court\r\ninstead only questioned the foreperson in the presence of the other jurors.\r\n13 In discussing the movant's incentive and burden, I am not referring to our rules\r\nof preservation. This issue is preserved because Larry sufficiently raised it to the\r\ntrial court by seeking to clarify the jury's intent in the above-suggested manner\r\nbefore the jury was discharged and the trial court ruled on his motion.\r\n14This amount omits the damages awarded for the strict liability claim because the\r\njury note was sent before the jury re-deliberated the strict liability claim.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
