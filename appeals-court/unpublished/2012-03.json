Dickson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.  2012-UP-149\r\n  Heard February 15, 2012 – Filed March 7,\r\n2012  \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        John Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Appellate Defender Elizabeth\r\n          Franklin-Best, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  This appeal arises out of Respondent\r\n  William Kirkland's conviction for criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor, first\r\n  degree, for which he received a sentence of twenty-five years suspended upon\r\n  service of one year in prison and five years of probation.  Kirkland served 85%\r\n  of his one-year sentence and was released to the community supervision program\r\n  (CSP).  Kirkland subsequently violated CSP and the court sentenced him to one\r\n  year in prison.  After serving one year, Kirkland was released and began a\r\n  five-year probation term.  Kirkland violated probation and was sentenced to\r\n  five years in prison.  Kirkland did not appeal from either the imposition or\r\n  revocation of regular probation.  After serving 85% of that five-year sentence,\r\n  he was again released to CSP.  Kirkland came before the court for a second\r\n  violation of CSP, which is the subject of the present appeal.  The circuit\r\n  court found Kirkland did not violate CSP, terminated CSP and/or probation, and\r\n  ordered Kirkland to check himself into a drug rehab facility under penalty of\r\n  contempt.  The State appeals, arguing the court abused its discretionin discharging Kirkland from his entire\r\n  sentence and in failing to dismiss Kirkland's argument as barred by the\r\n  doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.  We reverse and remand to\r\n  the circuit court with instructions to reinstate Kirkland to CSP.\r\n1.  As to\r\n  the State's argument that the circuit court erred in discharging Kirkland from\r\n  his entire sentence, we find the circuit court erred as a matter of law in\r\n  discharging Kirkland from his sentence, CSP, and residual probation because\r\n  Kirkland had served less than seven years of a twenty-five year sentence.  See State v. McGrier, 378 S.C. 320, 331, 663 S.E.2d 15, 21 (2008) (finding\r\n  &quot;revocations for successive CSP violations should not extend or exceed the\r\n  term of incarceration that was originally ordered for the underlying\r\n  offense&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-560(D) (2007)[1] (&quot;The maximum aggregate amount\r\n  of time the prisoner may be required to serve when sentenced for successive\r\n  revocations may not exceed an amount of time equal to the length of\r\n  incarceration imposed for the original 'no parole offense.'&quot;); see also State v. Picklesimer, 388 S.C. 264, 271, 695 S.E.2d 845, 849 (2010)\r\n  (Beatty, J., concurring) (&quot;It is important to recognize that the sentence\r\n  in McGrier was a no parole straight sentence of three years, not\r\n    a split sentence.&quot;).  We also emphasize that reversal is appropriate\r\n  because Kirkland did not appeal from the erroneous imposition of regular\r\n  probation following Kirkland's service of a one-year term for his first\r\n  violation of CSP.  See S.C. Dep't of Motor Vehicles v. McCarson,\r\n  391 S.C. 136, 145 n.9, 705 S.E.2d 425, 429 n.9 (2011) (noting an unappealed\r\n  ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).  \r\n2.  As to\r\n  the State's arguments regarding the doctrines of res judicata and collateral\r\n  estoppel, we find these arguments unpreserved for appellate review.  See State v. Jennings, 394 S.C. 473, 481, 716 S.E.2d 91, 95 (2011)\r\n  (&quot;For an issue to be properly preserved, it has to be raised to and ruled\r\n  on by the trial court.&quot;).\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  KONDUROS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \r\n[1] Section 24-21-560(D) was amended effective June 11,\r\n  2010.  See Act No. 237, 2010 S.C.

Laury's motion for summary judgment on causes of action related to\r\n  injuries Harwell suffered from a dog bite.  On appeal, Harwell argues the trial\r\n  court erred by failing to (1) address her cause of action for negligence; (2)\r\n  address her argument that Laury's property was not in a fit and habitable\r\n  condition because it was unfenced; (3) interpret the legislative intent of the\r\n  statute providing liability for dog bites; and (4) permit a cause of action for\r\n  negligent leasing or entrustment of real property.  We find no error of law in\r\n  the trial court's decision to grant summary judgment, and therefore, we affirm\r\n  pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:  Nicholson v. Nicholson, 378 S.C. 523, 537, 663 S.E.2d 74, 82 (Ct.

Brandt, of Walhalla, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Grady L. Beard, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:    In this workers' compensation case, Donna McCall appeals from the order of the Appellate Panel of the South\r\n  Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (Commission) affirming the single\r\n  commissioner's finding that her claim for repetitive trauma injury (RTI) to her\r\n  bilateral wrists was barred because she had failed to give timely notice\r\n  pursuant to section 42-15-20 of the South Carolina Code.  We affirm in part,\r\n  reverse in part, and remand. \r\nInitially, McCall contends the\r\n  Commission erred in admitting into evidence the medical records of Dr. Felipe Amaya,\r\n  a neurologist she consulted in 1999.  McCall\r\n  argues Dr. Amaya, at the time of the\r\n  hearing, was &quot;incompetent to testify as to any professional opinions&quot;\r\n  because his license to practice medicine had been permanently revoked and he\r\n  was no longer licensed to practice in any state.  Furthermore, McCall argues Dr.\r\n  Amaya's records were inadmissible because section\r\n  42-1-172 of the South Carolina Code, which governs compensability of RTI, requires\r\n  medical evidence &quot;offered by a licensed and qualified physician.&quot;\r\nThe Commission used Dr.\r\n  Amaya's records for the limited purpose of determining whether McCall's notice\r\n  was timely under section 42-15-20.  See S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-330 (2005)\r\n  (stating that while the rules of evidence do not apply in contested cases\r\n  before the Commission, &quot;[i]rrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious\r\n  evidence shall be excluded&quot;).  Section 42-1-172 was not invoked because\r\n  the Commission did not reach the question of whether McCall's RTI was\r\n  compensable.  See Michau v. Georgetown Cnty., Op. No. 27604 (S.C.\r\n  Sup. Ct. refiled February 1, 2012) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 4 at 26).  Consequently,\r\n  we find no error in the admission of Dr. Amaya's records under the more relaxed\r\n  admissibility provisions of section 1-23-330.\r\nAs to the timeliness of\r\n  McCall's notice, there was no substantial evidence to support the Commission's\r\n  finding that McCall &quot;discovered or could have discovered her condition was\r\n  compensable as early as 1999, when she was diagnosed with carpal tunnel\r\n  syndrome.&quot;  We disagree with the Commission's finding that Dr. Amaya's\r\n  letter of December 10, 1999 was sufficient to establish that McCall was\r\n  &quot;diagnosed&quot; with her current condition—or, for that matter, that she\r\n  was diagnosed with any condition.  The December\r\n  10, 1999 letter from Dr. Amaya to McCall's family physician was a general &quot;assessment&quot;\r\n  at a time when McCall was seeking treatment for tremors and was not experiencing\r\n  symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.  Dr. Amaya noted the absence of carpal\r\n  tunnel syndrome symptoms as follows: &quot;mild right [carpal tunnel syndrome],\r\n  now without [symptoms].&quot;  Further, Dr. Amaya did not notify McCall of his assessment\r\n  of carpal tunnel syndrome.  McCall continued to work until 2007, one year\r\n  following her fall at work.  She sought no medical treatment for the gradual\r\n  development of pain in her arms and hands, and Dr. David Rogers, who diagnosed\r\n  McCall's carpal tunnel syndrome on November 29, 2007, was the first doctor who notified\r\n  her that she had carpal tunnel syndrome. \r\nEven had McCall been\r\n  diagnosed with RTI in 1999, it was unclear at that time what notice, if any,\r\n  she would have been obligated to provide.  In 1999, the South Carolina Code\r\n  contained no reference to RTI.  Further, the common law had not yet determined\r\n  whether RTI was an injury by accident, which required notice pursuant to\r\n  section 42-15-20, or an occupational disease, which required notice within\r\n  ninety days of disability.  See Pee v. AVM, Inc., 352 S.C. 167,\r\n  173, 573 S.E.2d 785, 788 (2002) (&quot;Whether a repetitive trauma injury is\r\n  compensable either as an injury by accident or an occupational disease has not\r\n  been squarely addressed by this Court.&quot;).  Notably, in 2005, this court\r\n  applied section 42-15-20 to a claimant's RTI and held &quot;[n]otice begins to\r\n  run when the employee becomes disabled and could discover with\r\n  reasonable diligence his condition is compensable.&quot;  Bass v.\r\n    Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 481, 617 S.E.2d 369, 383 (Ct. App. 2005) (emphases\r\n  added).           \r\nMoreover, McCall's\r\n  admission—&quot;she knew the job caused the problems&quot;—was insufficient to\r\n  support the Commission's finding that she had reason to believe she had a\r\n  &quot;compensable&quot; condition prior to either her carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis\r\n  on November 29, 2007 or her inability to work resulting from carpal tunnel\r\n  syndrome.  In 2007, the legislature added subsection (C) to section 42-15-20,\r\n  effective July 1, 2007, which states, in pertinent part: &quot;In the case of repetitive trauma, notice must be given by\r\n  the employee within ninety days of the date the employee discovered, or could\r\n  have discovered by exercising reasonable diligence, that his condition is\r\n  compensable . . . .&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 42-15-20(C) (Supp. 2011).  This\r\n  court interpreted subsection (C) in King v. International Knife and\r\n    Saw-Florence:  &quot;[A] work-related repetitive trauma injury does not\r\n  become compensable, and the ninety-day reporting clock does not start, until\r\n  the injured employee discovers or should discover he qualifies to receive\r\n  benefits for medical care, treatment, or disability due to his condition.&quot; \r\n  395 S.C. 437, 444, 718 S.E.2d 227, 231 (Ct. App. 2011).  The court found a\r\n  distinction existed between work-related aches and pains and a compensable\r\n  condition:\r\n\r\n  [A]\r\n    mere work-related ache does not constitute a compensable condition, regardless\r\n    of whether the employee later develops an injury.  The Act requires an injured\r\n    employee to be diligent, not prescient.  King's condition was not compensable\r\n    until it either required medical care or interfered with his ability to perform\r\n    his job, whichever occurred first.\r\n\r\nId. at 445,\r\n  718 S.E.2d at 231.\r\nTherefore, McCall's obligation\r\n  to provide notice under section 42-15-20(C) was triggered only after her RTI required medical care or interfered with her ability\r\n  to perform her job—neither of which occurred prior to her diagnosis on November 29, 2007.  Because McCall gave notice of her RTI on January 30, 2008—well within the ninety-day period\r\n  required under section 42-15-20(C)—we reverse\r\n  the Commission's conclusion that McCall failed to provide timely notice of her\r\n  RTI and remand for a determination of compensability pursuant to section\r\n  42-1-172.\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-154","title":"Collins v.

White, of Goose Creek, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this Workers' Compensation case, Appellants, South\r\n  Carolina Department of Education-Transportation Division (Employer) and State\r\n  Accident Fund (Carrier), seek review of the circuit court's order affirming the\r\n  Workers' Compensation Commission's decision regarding the provision and payment\r\n  of home healthcare services for Respondent Veronica Collins. \r\nOn appeal, Appellants argue\r\n  the circuit court erred in: (1) finding Collins's refusal to enter an assisted\r\n  living facility was not unreasonable; and (2) ordering Appellants to compensate\r\n  Collins's friend and care-provider, Sharon Bryant, $400 per week for providing\r\n  in-home services to Collins. \r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refusal to Enter Assisted\r\n  Living \r\nCollins suffers from incomplete\r\n  paraplegia and incontinence following work-related spinal trauma and subsequent\r\n  lumbar spine surgery.  On May 25, 2006, May 22, 2007, and July 20, 2007, Dr. Joseph\r\n  Nolan, Collins's primary physician, prescribed 24-hour, home-based care to provide\r\n  Collins assistance with the activities of daily living.  On September 26, 2007,\r\n  Appellants responded by offering to place Collins in an assisted living\r\n  facility.  Collins, who is the sole caregiver for her two minor children,\r\n  refused to enter the facility, testifying that moving would do\r\n  &quot;irreparable damage&quot; to her children and would require her to place\r\n  them in foster care.  Appellants contend it was &quot;unreasonable&quot; for Collins\r\n  to refuse to move into the facility and stated it is Carrier's right to direct\r\n  medical care. \r\nAppellants are required to\r\n  provide lifetime care for Collins, who is totally and permanently disabled:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    cases in which total and permanent disability results, reasonable\r\n      and necessary nursing services, medicines, prosthetic devices, sick travel,\r\n    medical, hospital, and other treatment or care shall be paid during the life of\r\n    the injured employee, without regard to any limitation in this title including\r\n    the maximum compensation limit.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-15-60(C)\r\n  (Supp. 2011) (emphases added).  Furthermore, the Commission is authorized to\r\n  determine whether &quot;circumstances justify&quot; the employee's refusal to\r\n  submit to medical services directed by an employer.  S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  42-15-80(A) (Supp. 2011).\r\nWe find substantial evidence\r\n  supports the circuit court's finding that Collins was not unreasonable in\r\n  refusing to move into an assisted living facility.  Importantly, we note that\r\n  Collins's physician repeatedly prescribed in-home services, and as the\r\n  circuit court noted, no doctor recommended that Collins go into an assisted\r\n  living facility.  To the contrary, Dr. Nolan specifically stated, on May 22, 2007 and July 20, 2007, that Bryant should continue providing services to\r\n  Collins.  Substantial evidence supports the Commission's determination that Collins\r\n  &quot;did not unreasonably refuse medical treatment in not going into an\r\n  assisted living facility home.&quot;  Accordingly, the circuit court properly\r\n  upheld the Commission's determination that Collins's refusal to enter an\r\n  assisted living facility was not unreasonable.\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment for In-home\r\n  Services\r\nDespite Dr. Nolan's May 25, 2006\r\n  order for 24-hour, in-home services, Appellants provided no in-home\r\n  assistance.  Instead, Collins's friend, Sharon Bryant, moved in with Collins\r\n  and provided 24-hour assistance with driving, cooking, shopping, cleaning,\r\n  bathing, lifting, taking medication, and dressing.  On May 22, 2007, Dr. Nolan wrote a letter summarizing\r\n  Collins's medical status and reiterated the need for 24-hour, in-home\r\n  assistance:\r\n\r\n  Ms.\r\n    Collins has a significant impairment of mobility and needs a wheelchair for\r\n    ambulation.  She has problems with balance and experiences regular urinary\r\n    incontinence.  She has a significant history of falls.  Ms. Collins is unable\r\n    to perform her activities of daily living, and requires 24 hour assistance.\r\n  Ms.\r\n    Sharon Bryant has been assisting Ms. Collins and should continue to do so.  It\r\n    is necessary that Ms. Collins have a caregiver at home in order to keep her\r\n    from being situated in an assisted living facility.\r\n\r\nOn July 20, 2007, Dr. Nolan\r\n  documented Collins's deteriorating condition and stated:\r\n\r\n  Due to\r\n    her profound physical limitations, Ms. Collins requires a motorized wheelchair\r\n    for mobility.  . . .  Ms. Collins also requires home health care for assistance\r\n    with her personal need[s] and activities of daily living.  Ms. Sharon Bryant\r\n    has been providing this care for Ms. Collins and should continue to do so.\r\n\r\nAll of\r\n  the above are medically necessary for Ms. Collins's long-term care.\r\nAt the hearing before the\r\n  single Commissioner on April 7, 2008, Collins testified that since her spinal\r\n  fusion surgery in December 2004, no one—other than Sharon Bryant—had provided\r\n  any home care services.\r\nOn appeal, Carrier contends there\r\n  was no evidence before the court regarding an appropriate rate of compensation\r\n  for a home healthcare worker.  The record, however, includes evidence that an\r\n  assisted living facility would cost $3,100 per month.  We find Carrier's\r\n  argument to be without merit, and we affirm the circuit court's order requiring\r\n  Appellants to compensate Bryant, at a rate of $400 per week, for providing\r\n  24-hour, in-home care from May 25, 2006, the date Dr. Nolan first ordered such\r\n  care, through June 4, 2008.&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION&nbsp;\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the circuit court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-155","title":"State v.

Matthews, Administrative Law\r\nCourt Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2012-UP-161\r\n  Submitted February 1, 2012 – Filed March\r\n7, 2012\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Jasmine Hudson, pro se.\r\n        Christopher D. Florian, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jasmine\r\n  Hudson appeals the Administrative Law Court's (ALC) order, which affirmed the South Carolina Department\r\n  of Corrections's (the Department) decision finding Hudson guilty of assault\r\n  and/or battery of an inmate with means and/or intent to kill or injure.  On\r\n  appeal, Hudson argues the ALC erred in finding (1) the Department's disciplinary\r\n  proceedings did not violate his due process rights and (2) substantial evidence\r\n  existed for the hearing officer to find Hudson guilty as charged.  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.&nbsp; We find Hudson's\r\n  arguments regarding the Department's holding of a second hearing on his charge\r\n  after the first hearing failed to result in a verdict are without merit and not\r\n  preserved for our review.  Hudson's argument that the Department violated its\r\n  disciplinary policies by failing to present additional evidence at the second\r\n  hearing is without merit.  The policy cited by Hudson specifically states that\r\n  it only applies &quot;if the disciplinary conviction was overturned due to\r\n  insufficient evidence.&quot;  Hudson's first hearing failed to result in a\r\n  verdict due to a procedural error, not insufficient evidence.  Additionally, to\r\n  the extent Hudson's argument can be read to encompass other grounds for\r\n  challenging the second hearing held by the Department, such arguments are not\r\n  preserved for our review.  Hudson did not include other grounds for his\r\n  challenge to the second hearing in his grievances filed with the Department. \r\n  Further, the ALC does not specifically address any arguments regarding the\r\n  second hearing in its order, and it is not clear from the ALC's order that\r\n  Hudson raised this issue to the ALC.  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved\r\n  for review.  See Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 379, 527\r\n  S.E.2d 742, 755 (2000) (finding issues not raised to and ruled upon by the ALC\r\n  ordinarily are not preserved for review).    \r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; We find the ALC properly found\r\n  substantial evidence existed for the hearing officer to find Hudson guilty.  This\r\n  court may affirm the decision of the ALC if it is supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.  S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-610(B)(e) (Supp.\r\n  2010).  &quot;Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that, considering the\r\n  record as a whole, a reasonable mind would accept to support an administrative\r\n  agency's action.&quot;  Al-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 380, 527 S.E.2d at 756.  \r\nHere, substantial evidence\r\n  exists to support the ALC's findings.  The Department presented evidence to\r\n  support Hudson's disciplinary conviction for assault and/or battery of an\r\n  inmate with means and/or intent to kill or injure.  Captain Ricky Grimes\r\n  testified he initially identified Hudson as a suspect in the attack after the\r\n  victim described one of the perpetrators as having gold teeth.  After observing\r\n  Hudson's gold teeth, Captain Grimes presented the victim with a picture of\r\n  Hudson, and the victim identified Hudson as the director of the attack.    \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-162","title":"Mullins v.

Alexander, of Pickens, for Guardian\r\n          ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  John\r\n  and Jane Doe and James and Diane Youngblood cross-appeal the family court's\r\n  final order granting the adoption of Child to the Youngbloods and requiring\r\n  visitation with Child's biological siblings, who were adopted by the Does.  The\r\n  Does argue the family court erred in (1) holding the Youngbloods had standing\r\n  to adopt Child, (2) granting the adoption without the consent of the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS), and (3) finding Child's adoption\r\n  by the Youngbloods was in her best interests.  The Youngbloods argue the family\r\n  court erred in (1) granting visitation and (2) finding they were not entitled\r\n  to attorney's fees.  We affirm\r\n  in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with\r\n  this opinion.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nDSS removed Child, who was\r\n  born in February 2006, and her four older siblings from the custody of their\r\n  biological parents.  While an action to terminate her biological parents'\r\n  parental rights was pending, DSS placed her in a foster home for several months\r\n  and then transferred her to the foster care of the Youngbloods on October 12,\r\n  2007.  Although separated, the siblings visited each other from time to time\r\n  during their foster care.\r\nOn April 17, 2008, the\r\n  Youngbloods received a letter from DSS informing them that adoption was Child's\r\n  permanent care plan.  DSS gave the Youngbloods ninety days to seek a home study\r\n  if they desired to be considered as candidates for Child's adoption.  The\r\n  letter also notified them that Child &quot;may be moved for the purposes of\r\n  adoption once an approved resource has been identified,&quot; and &quot;it will\r\n  be the first priority of [DSS] to reunite and place [Child with her siblings]\r\n  for the purpose of adoption.&quot;  The Youngbloods timely submitted the\r\n  materials to DSS for a home study.\r\nDSS notified the Youngbloods\r\n  on March 17, 2009, that their home study was approved but Child and her\r\n  siblings would be placed together with the Does, who had indicated to DSS in\r\n  January 2009 that they were interested in adopting all five siblings.  Ten days'\r\n  notice of removal was given on May 5, 2009, and the children were removed and placed\r\n  in the Does' custody for the purpose of adoption that June.  The Youngbloods\r\n  challenged Child's removal, seeking a fair hearing from a DSS committee.[1] \r\n  However, the Youngbloods filed a petition with the family court to adopt Child\r\n  before their administrative appeal was decided.  The Does responded with a\r\n  formal petition of their own, seeking the adoption of all five siblings.[2]\r\nThe family court, in a\r\n  temporary order issued following a July 29 hearing, granted the Youngbloods immediate\r\n  custody of Child during the pendency of the adoption proceedings.  The\r\n  temporary order also required reasonable visitation between Child and her\r\n  siblings and denied DSS's motion to dismiss the petition due to the\r\n  Youngbloods' failure to exhaust their available administrative remedies.  The\r\n  family court issued a second temporary order a few months later, which ordered\r\n  mediation, bonding assessments, and discovery, and detailed a plan for\r\n  visitation during the pendency of the proceedings.\r\nA final hearing on the\r\n  adoption was held before the family court in September 2010.  Dr. Mary Cumming,\r\n  a family counselor retained by the guardian ad litem[3] (GAL) for a bonding assessment, testified in favor of adoption by the\r\n  Youngbloods.  After conducting four visits with the Youngbloods and one with\r\n  the Does, Dr. Cumming recommended that Child not be removed from the\r\n  Youngbloods' home because she was doing well in a &quot;fragile and important\r\n  part of development.&quot;  She emphasized, however, that Child would learn a\r\n  lot from both families and that both families loved Child.  Other concerns of\r\n  Dr. Cumming were that Child &quot;seemed exhausted&quot; from her interactions\r\n  with the Does, and the Does' &quot;chaotically enmeshed&quot; family system\r\n  faced huge challenges with the responsibilities they had taken on.  Given Child's\r\n  strong temperament, Dr. Cumming opined the structure and space provided by the\r\n  Youngbloods would better suit her.\r\nAlso testifying in favor of\r\n  adoption by the Youngbloods was Dr. David Cannon, a clinical psychologist, who\r\n  was involved in the proceedings to terminate Child's biological parents'\r\n  parental rights.  He appeared under subpoena issued by the Youngbloods.  Dr.\r\n  Cannon noted he never assessed the families for the purposes of the adoption\r\n  proceedings, and he had no detailed knowledge of the families.  His opinion,\r\n  however, was that removing Child from the Youngbloods' home and uniting her\r\n  with her siblings was not worth the risk.  He viewed this case as &quot;one of\r\n  those cases where [a] child is obviously . . . better off left in the location\r\n  she regards as her home and with the people she regards as her parents and has\r\n  obviously bonded with.&quot;\r\nIn addition to recommending\r\n  that Child remain with the Youngbloods, Drs. Cumming and Cannon both\r\n  recommended sibling visitation.  Dr.&nbsp;Cumming concluded that Child\r\n  &quot;should have free and liberal visitation&quot; with flexibility in the\r\n  schedule &quot;as she grows older.&quot;  She emphasized it would be\r\n  detrimental for Child to no longer have a relationship with her siblings.  Dr.\r\n  Cannon did not &quot;see the logic behind&quot; placing the Child with the\r\n  Does, &quot;especially if there [were] arrangements for [Child] to have regular\r\n  visitation with [her] four other siblings.&quot;\r\nDr. Deborah Otto-Sunderman, a\r\n  counselor the Youngbloods hired for Child, also testified for the Youngbloods. \r\n  After observing Child routinely, Dr. Otto-Sunderman's overall recommendation was\r\n  that removal from the Youngbloods' home and adoption by the Does would be a great\r\n  risk because of Child's secure primary care attachment with the Youngbloods.  Thus,\r\n  adoption by the Youngbloods, she testified, was in Child's best interests.\r\nThe Does retained two\r\n  experts, Meredith Thompson-Loftis and Dr.&nbsp;Craig Horn, to testify at the\r\n  hearing.  Thompson-Loftis, a counselor who observed Child and her siblings and\r\n  assessed the sibling bond, explained &quot;a lot of research [showed] that the\r\n  sibling bond is almost equal to if not greater than that of a parental\r\n  bond&quot; but noted her opinion that &quot;it's more of on a case by case\r\n  basis.&quot;  She concluded Child had &quot;multiple bonds at the primary\r\n  status,&quot; including the bond with her siblings.  Her recommendation was\r\n  that Child needed to be with her siblings.  Dr. Horn, a clinical psychologist,\r\n  gave similar testimony although he never had contact with the parties\r\n  involved.  After reviewing documents provided to him, he pointed out that young\r\n  children like Child had the ability to adjust and children placed together had\r\n  fewer emotional behavioral problems, especially when their biological parents\r\n  are no longer present.  He explained removing Child from the Youngbloods' home\r\n  would not create a risk for attachment disorder.\r\nFinally, the GAL and DSS\r\n  officials testified.  The GAL presented his report and opinion regarding Child's\r\n  best interests, recommending Child be adopted by the Does.  The GAL was\r\n  concerned about the &quot;antagonistic relationship and pending law suit\r\n  between the prospective parents.&quot;  But in the event the family court found\r\n  in favor of the Youngbloods, the GAL recommended sibling visitation.  Helena\r\n  Turner, who sat on the DSS committee that placed the siblings with the Does,\r\n  testified the committee determined Child's interests were best served by her\r\n  placement with her siblings and searched for a &quot;family for them to\r\n  transition into.&quot;  She noted it was also DSS policy to do so.  Deborah\r\n  Thompson, another committee member, explained that DSS would not have placed Child\r\n  with the Does if they were concerned she would not &quot;successfully\r\n  transition[] into a placement with her siblings.&quot;\r\nThe Youngbloods also\r\n  introduced evidence of the Does' teenage son's Facebook profile.  On his\r\n  profile were the results of many quizzes, some designed to identify historical\r\n  figures he was most similar to, including the dictator Adolf Hitler, the\r\n  assassin Gavrilo Princip, and the serial killer Herbert Mullin.  The\r\n  Youngbloods communicated their concerns about the Facebook profile to DSS, but\r\n  neither the GAL nor DSS, after an investigation, were troubled by the\r\n  postings.  The Does filed a slander lawsuit, claiming Mrs. Youngblood called their\r\n  son a sex predator and a Nazi.  Furthermore, the Does challenged the relevancy of\r\n  the postings at the hearing; however, the family court overruled their\r\n  objection.  The family court asked the Does' son at the final hearing if he had\r\n  removed the postings, and he had not.  Nevertheless, the family court found his\r\n  explanation for the postings to be &quot;plausible and palatable.&quot;\r\nIn its final order, the\r\n  family court found the Youngbloods had standing to adopt, noting that the\r\n  Youngbloods had informed DSS of their desire to adopt Child, obtained approval\r\n  to adopt generally, and properly challenged Child's removal from their\r\n  custody.  It pointed out that the foster care contract did not voluntarily end.\r\nAs to the adoption of Child,\r\n  the family court concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n  I have\r\n    carefully considered all evidence presented.  I am cognizant of the legal\r\n    presumption in favor of keeping siblings together, and I agree with that policy\r\n    in most cases.  This is not, however, a typical case.  I have weighed the pros\r\n    and cons of allowing [Child] to grow up in the same home as her brothers and\r\n    sisters.  I have likewise weighed the benefits of allowing her to remain in her\r\n    current home with her current parental figures verses the potential harm to her\r\n    if she is permanently removed from [the Youngbloods' care].  In the final\r\n    analysis, I am persuaded that adoption by [the Youngbloods] is in [Child's]\r\n    best interest and welfare, both from a near-term and long-term perspective.\r\n\r\nThe family court placed the\r\n  greatest weight on the testimony of Drs.&nbsp;Cumming and Cannon, who both\r\n  recommended that Child remain with the Youngbloods.  In determining which\r\n  family would better serve Child's best interests, the family court also\r\n  referred to the Does' &quot;lack of sound parental judgment in handling [the]\r\n  matter,&quot; which included the slander lawsuit.\r\nAlthough the adoption was\r\n  decided in favor of the Youngbloods, the family court, pursuant to section\r\n  63-3-530(A)(44) of the South Carolina Code (2010), found continued visitation\r\n  &quot;with the Doe family&quot; was in the best interests of all siblings,\r\n  including Child.  The court-ordered schedule included visitation every other\r\n  weekend, every other spring break, every other Thanksgiving break, and the\r\n  second half of every Christmas break, dividing Christmas Day.  Finally, the\r\n  family court found that neither the Youngbloods nor the Does &quot;should be\r\n  ordered to pay or contribute to the attorney's fees and costs of the\r\n  other&quot;; however, the Does were ordered to pay 67% of the GAL's attorney's\r\n  fees, while the Youngbloods were responsible for the remainder.  The family\r\n  court denied both the Youngbloods' and the Does' motions for reconsideration;\r\n  however, it corrected its order pursuant to Rule 60(a), SCRCP, amending the\r\n  order to give the Does three full weeks of visitation during the summer, compared\r\n  to the Youngbloods' two full weeks.  This cross-appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family\r\n  court, this court reviews factual and legal issues de novo.  Simmons v.\r\n    Simmons, 399 S.C. 412, 414, 709 S.E.2d 666, 667 (2011); see also Lewis\r\n      v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 386, 709 S.E.2d 650, 652 (2011).  An appellate\r\n  court &quot;has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its view of\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence&quot; and is not required &quot;to disregard\r\n  the findings of the family court.&quot;  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. 56,\r\n  61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652 (2006).  We recognize the family court, which saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and\r\n  assign comparative weight to their testimony.  Lewis, 392 S.C. at 385,\r\n  709 S.E.2d at 652.  Thus, the burden is upon the appellant to convince this\r\n  court that the family court erred in its findings.  Id.  &quot;This\r\n  degree of deference is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best\r\n  interests of a minor child.&quot;  Ex parte Morris, 367 S.C. at 62, 624\r\n  S.E.2d at 652.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing and Consent\r\nThe Does argue\r\n  the Youngbloods lack standing to petition the family court for the adoption of\r\n  Child.  Furthermore, the Does contend DSS's consent to adopt, which the Youngbloods\r\n  did not have, was required by law.  We disagree.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing\r\n&quot;Any South\r\n  Carolina resident may petition the [family] court to adopt a child.&quot;  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. § 63-9-60(A)(1) (Supp. 2011).  This\r\n  provision is limited, however, once a child is &quot;placed by DSS in another\r\n  home for the purposes of adoption.&quot;  Michael P. v. Greenville Cnty.\r\n    Dep't of Soc. Servs., 385 S.C. 407, 415, 684 S.E.2d 211, 215 (Ct. App.\r\n  2009) (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-60(B) (2010)).  After a child is\r\n  placed in a pre-adoptive home, a former foster parent, in order to maintain\r\n  standing to intervene, must show he suffered an injury-in-fact that is\r\n  concrete, particularized, actual, and imminent; that is causally connected to\r\n  the conduct of DSS; and that will likely &quot;be redressed by a favorable\r\n  decision.&quot;  Id. at 416, 684 S.E.2d at 215.  Because Child was\r\n  placed with the Does by DSS for adoption, we find the Youngbloods were former\r\n  foster parents when they petitioned the family court for adoption, and the\r\n  broad window to petition the family court under section 63-9-60(A)(1) had\r\n  closed.  However, this does not end our analysis.\r\nIn Michael P.,\r\n  this court considered the standing of former foster parents who intervened in\r\n  an adoption after the child was placed in a pre-adoptive home.  Michael P.,\r\n  385 S.C. at 410, 684 S.E.2d at 212-13.  Although this court generally noted\r\n  that &quot;foster parents' procedural and due process rights . . . are more\r\n  limited than the rights of legal parents,&quot; we never addressed precisely\r\n  what those rights were, finding only that &quot;[a]ny rights [the former foster\r\n  parents] had with regard to [the child] ended after they chose not to\r\n  administratively challenge the removal of [the child] from their care.&quot;  Id. at 416-18, 684 S.E.2d at 215-17.  The Youngbloods, however, administratively challenged\r\n  Child's removal from their home and requested to adopt Child before DSS found a\r\n  home willing to adopt the sibling group.  Without evidence of a waiver, we must\r\n  determine, unlike in Michael P., what legal interest the Youngbloods had\r\n  in petitioning to adopt once Child was placed with the Does.  We find, given\r\n  the unique facts of this case, that DSS's denial of consent gives the\r\n  Youngbloods the standing to petition the family court for Child's adoption.\r\nB.&nbsp; Consent\r\nThe consent of\r\n  DSS, or any child-placing agency, is required when the &quot;authority to\r\n  execute a consent or relinquishment has been vested legally in&quot; it after\r\n  &quot;the parental rights of both the [child's] parents have been judicially\r\n  terminated.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-310(B) (2010); see also S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  63-9-750(B)(2) (2010) (providing that the family court has the duty to find\r\n  that &quot;all necessary consents or relinquishments for the purpose of\r\n  adoption have been obtained&quot;).  When a child-placing agency does not provide its consent to a\r\n  person eligible under section 63-9-60, it has &quot;an affirmative duty to\r\n  inform the person who is denied consent of all of his rights for judicial\r\n  review of the denial.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-310(D) (2010). \r\n  Therefore, reading the plain language of section 63-9-310(D), we find that any\r\n  person who is initially eligible to adopt under section 63-9-60 and who is aggrieved\r\n  by a child-placing agency's decision to deny them consent to adopt a specific\r\n  child may petition the family court to review the child-placing agency's\r\n  decision in order to determine whether it was in the child's best interests.  See,\r\n    e.g., Michael P., 385 S.C. at 414-15, 684 S.E.2d at 215\r\n  (&quot;Whenever possible, legislative intent should be found in the plain\r\n  language of the statute itself.&quot;).\r\nHowever, the\r\n  denial of consent and the mere failure to obtain consent, as was the case in Michael\r\n    P., require some distinction.  Indeed, no foster parent, whose rights are\r\n  defined by contract, has a right to adopt a specific child in the legal custody\r\n  of a child-placing agency.  Michael P., accordingly, presents an example\r\n  of how the limited legal rights of a foster parent can be waived if the foster\r\n  parent declines a child-placing agency's invitation to apply for a home study or\r\n  fails to administratively challenge the child's removal.  Our holding is\r\n  limited to the recognition of the statutory right of a &quot;person who is\r\n  denied consent&quot; of a child-placing agency to petition the family court\r\n  &quot;for judicial review of the denial.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-310(D) (2010).  In addition to deciding whether consent was\r\n  in fact denied, the family court must determine what best serves the interests\r\n  of the child and whether consent was properly obtained.  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. § 63-9-750(B) (2010)\r\n  (detailing the findings the family court must make in granting an adoption\r\n  after a final hearing).  \r\nThe denial of\r\n  consent by a child-placing agency assumes a timely application for the adoption\r\n  of a specific child by an eligible family.  When the Youngbloods applied to\r\n  adopt Child, they were residents of South Carolina and Child had not been\r\n  placed for the purpose of adoption.  Moreover, by DSS's own admission, the\r\n  Youngbloods properly applied to adopt Child but were denied consent because\r\n  &quot;the sibling group of five [was] placed together.&quot;  Aggrieved by\r\n  DSS's decision and without an administrative remedy, the Youngbloods properly\r\n  sought review by the family court, pleading in their petition that DSS's\r\n  determination was not in the best interests of Child and seeking the protection\r\n  of the family court.  See 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-150(A)(2) (Supp.\r\n  2011) (&quot;A person is not entitled to appeal [DSS's] decision to deny its\r\n  consent or refuse approval of the applicant for adoption of a\r\n  specific child.&quot;).\r\nResolution and\r\n  permanency are crucial in determining the best interests of a child in the\r\n  adoption context, and the role of a child-placing agency in making that\r\n  determination should not be ignored or even diminished.  Michael P., 385 S.C at 417, 684 S.E.2d at 216 (&quot;A child deserves resolution and permanency in his or her\r\n  life.&quot;) (quoting In re Michael Ray T., 525 S.E.2d 315, 323 (W. Va. 1999)).  But in the rare instances when an adoption is contested, we\r\n  hold the family court has the authority to review the agency's decision\r\n  regarding consent.  Judicial review will ensure that the decision is in the\r\n  best interests of the child and not arbitrary.  Accordingly, we find the\r\n  Youngbloods had standing to petition the family court for Child's adoption.\r\nII.&nbsp; Child's Best Interests\r\nBoth the Does and\r\n  the Youngbloods challenge the family court's determination of Child's best\r\n  interests.  Specifically, the Does argue the adoption by the Youngbloods was\r\n  not in Child's best interests, and the Youngbloods object to the scope of the family\r\n  court's grant of sibling visitation.  Like\r\n  the family court, we recognize Child's interests are best served in maintaining\r\n  the relationships she developed over her young life; however, we agree with the\r\n  Youngbloods that the family court's broad grant of sibling visitation was\r\n  inconsistent with the evidence presented at the hearing.\r\nIn adjudicating a\r\n  contested adoption, the family court must determine whether the child-placing\r\n  agency's consent was properly obtained—a duty intertwined, as we noted above,\r\n  with the paramount task of finding whether &quot;the best interests of the\r\n  adoptee are served by the adoption.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-750(B)(6) (2010).  Here, the family court found that\r\n  adoption by the Youngbloods best served Child's interests, and considering that\r\n  the family court is in the best position to make credibility determinations, we\r\n  affirm.  Indeed, the testimony of both Drs. Cumming and Cannon, which the\r\n  family court found most credible and weighed heavily, supports Child's adoption\r\n  by the Youngbloods.  Both experts concluded Child was in a fragile period of\r\n  her development and removal from the Youngbloods' home would pose a risk to her,\r\n  and all experts, including the Does', acknowledged the existence of a bond between\r\n  the Youngbloods and Child.\r\nIt follows that placing\r\n  Child with the Does would sever a bond that was developed over a substantial\r\n  period of Child's life.  The Youngbloods and Child would not be entitled under\r\n  law to maintain their relationship, and each would be dependent on the\r\n  discretion of the Does—a legitimate risk given the relationship between the two\r\n  families that was observed by the GAL.  Thus, from our &quot;review [of] the\r\n  cold record,&quot; we find the Does fail to meet their burden of convincing\r\n  this court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the family court erred in\r\n  finding adoption by the Youngbloods was in Child's best interests.  Altman v. Griffith, 372 S.C. 388, 393, 642 S.E.2d 619, 622 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nWe, like the family\r\n  court, are mindful of the Does' contention that &quot;the policy of this State [is]\r\n  to reunite [a] child with [her] family in a timely manner, whether or not [she]\r\n  has been placed in the care of the State voluntarily.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-1-20(D) (2010).  Moreover, we recently held the separation of\r\n  siblings in custody disputes &quot;should be avoided unless there are exceptional\r\n  circumstances present.&quot;  Moeller v. Moeller, 394 S.C. 365, 374, 714\r\n  S.E.2d 898, 903 (Ct. App. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In Moeller,\r\n  we found no exceptional circumstances to support the separation of two children\r\n  from their half-sibling.  Id. at 375, 714 S.E.2d at 903.  That case,\r\n  however, was a custody case between two biological parents, and the father did\r\n  not risk losing visitation after we found the mother was entitled to custody.  Id.; see also Patel v.\r\n    Patel, 359 S.C. 515,\r\n  528-29, 599 S.E.2d 114, 121 (2004) (finding that separating siblings in order\r\n  for one to complete high school in another state was not an abuse of\r\n  discretion).  By accepting\r\n  the testimony of Drs. Cumming and Cannon, we must also defer to the family\r\n  court's finding that &quot;[t]his is not . . . a typical case.&quot;  The risk\r\n  of completely severing a key relationship in Child's life is an exceptional\r\n  circumstance to consider.  Thus, we affirm the family court's decision that\r\n  adoption by the Youngbloods was in Child's best interests.\r\nThe Youngbloods,\r\n  however, contend that the family court erred in determining the schedule of\r\n  sibling visitation.[4] \r\n  Their exception to the visitation schedule regards its scope, and they point\r\n  out the order's reference to the Doe family as a whole and its grant of a significant\r\n  amount of time when Child will be apart from a legal parent.  These arguments,\r\n  however, were never raised to the family court before its ruling.  In fact, the\r\n  Youngbloods, who proposed no schedule, indicated during the final hearing that\r\n  they were willing to accept sibling visitation as a condition if they were\r\n  granted the adoption.  Moreover, the record does not show whether the\r\n  visitation schedule was challenged by the Youngbloods until their motion for\r\n  reconsideration.  Thus, we find the issues raised by the Youngbloods are not\r\n  preserved for our review.  See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C.\r\n  406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (noting the preservation rules exist\r\n  &quot;to enable the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all\r\n  relevant facts, law, and arguments&quot;).\r\nThis court cannot\r\n  ignore the best interests of Child.  Our standard of review in appeals from the\r\n  family court requires a de novo review of the family court's decision, and appellate\r\n  courts are consistent in holding that &quot;procedural rules are subservient to\r\n  the court's duty to zealously guard the rights of minors.&quot;  Joiner v. Rivas,\r\n  342 S.C. 102, 107, 536 S.E.2d 372, 374 (2000).  Despite the Youngbloods'\r\n  failure to properly raise their objections to the family court, we are compelled\r\n  on review to assess the family court's order in light of the record as a whole,\r\n  and we find the visitation schedule, as ordered, is not supported by evidence.\r\nThe temporary\r\n  orders of the family court show an evolution of the visitation schedule early\r\n  in the litigation.  The family court first ordered &quot;reasonable\r\n  visitation&quot; between Child and her siblings but later established a\r\n  specific schedule, finding a definite schedule necessary because of the\r\n  strained relationship between the Youngbloods and the Does.  The follow-up\r\n  order included visitation for three Saturdays a month until the end of 2009, as\r\n  well as five hours on Christmas Day.  The schedule shifted to visitation every\r\n  other weekend beginning January 1, 2010, and that frequency was continued throughout\r\n  the proceedings.  Thus, relevant to visitation, the only evidence before the\r\n  family court at the hearing was the temporary schedule, as well as the\r\n  testimony of the experts that visitation generally was in Child's best\r\n  interests if the adoption was granted in the Youngbloods' favor.\r\nIn light of the\r\n  expert testimony, we find a preponderance of the evidence proves that sibling\r\n  visitation is in the best interests of Child; however, the evidence supporting\r\n  the specific schedule is insufficient.  The schedule established in the final\r\n  order significantly expanded visitation to include entire holiday breaks and\r\n  multiple summer weeks, but no testimony or proposal showed that schedule was appropriate. \r\n  Because we are unable to make an adequate determination of how Child's best\r\n  interests are affected by the frequency of visitation, we reverse the family\r\n  court's schedule.  We remand the matter for an evidentiary hearing solely to\r\n  determine the proper scope of sibling visitation.\r\nIII.&nbsp;Attorney's Fees\r\nThe Youngbloods\r\n  contend the family court erred in denying their motion for attorney's fees and\r\n  in ordering them to pay one-third of the GAL's attorney's fees because they\r\n  prevailed on the merits.  We disagree.\r\nThe authority for\r\n  a family court to award attorney's fees must be found in a statute, and two statutes enable the family court's authority\r\n  in the adoption context.  See, e.g., Baxter\r\n    v. Martin Bros., Inc., 368 S.C. 510, 514, 630 S.E.2d 42, 44 (2006)  First, the family court may generally\r\n  assess attorney's fees &quot;for or\r\n  against a party to an action brought in or subject to the jurisdiction of the\r\n  family court.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-3-530(A)(38) (2010).  A party,\r\n  however, must request the attorney's fees in a pleading or a motion for pendente\r\n  lite relief.  Id.  Second, the adoption statutes specifically authorize the payment of attorney's\r\n  fees in adoption proceedings to a child-placing agency or person as long as the\r\n  fees are not provided as &quot;consideration for giving a consent or\r\n  relinquishment of a child for the purpose of adoption.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-310(F) (2010).  Although the more specific statute generally\r\n  controls, the contested nature of this action presents a unique set of facts,\r\n  adding an element of judicial review to a statutorily-defined adoption procedure. \r\n  We hold, therefore, that section 63-3-530(A)(38) gives the family court the\r\n  discretion to award attorney's fees if the parties properly requested them.[5]  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515,\r\n  533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004) (&quot;An award of attorney's fees rests within\r\n  the sound discretion of the [family court] and should not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion.&quot;).\r\nGiven the applicability of\r\n  section 63-3-530(A)(38), the family court, in deciding whether to award\r\n  attorney's fees, should consider &quot;(1) the party's ability to pay his/her\r\n  own attorney's fee; (2) [the] beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3)\r\n  the parties' respective financial conditions; [and] (4) [the] effect of the\r\n  attorney's fee on each party's standard of living.&quot;  E.D.M. v. T.A.M.,\r\n  307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992) (citing Glasscock v.\r\n    Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161 n.1, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 n.1 (1991)).  We find\r\n  the family court properly exercised its discretion in declining to award\r\n  attorney's fees to the Youngbloods.  The family court's analysis, which\r\n  included consideration of each of the E.D.M. factors, is supported by the\r\n  evidence of the Youngbloods' financial standing compared to the fees and costs billed\r\n  by their attorney.  Although the Youngbloods have less income than the Does, Child\r\n  is the only minor child in the Youngbloods' care.  Moreover, the Does' attorney\r\n  submitted an affidavit of fees and costs totaling $36,377.29.  An additional\r\n  $19,910.00 would substantially affect the standard of living for a family with\r\n  five minor children and who are routinely visited by Child.  Given this\r\n  evidence and the deference we give in reviewing the decisions made within a\r\n  family court's discretion, the beneficial results obtained by the Youngbloods'\r\n  attorney do not require a reversal.\r\nThe Youngbloods\r\n  also argue the family court erred in requiring them to pay one-third of the\r\n  GAL's attorney's fees.  The compensation of a GAL, including the payment of any\r\n  attorney's fees, is authorized by a separate statutory scheme.  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. § 63-9-310(F)(4) (2010) (providing for the\r\n  compensation of GALs in adoptions); S.C. Code Ann. § 63-9-720&nbsp;(2010) (providing for GALs\r\n  in adoptions); S.C. Code Ann. §§ 63-3-810\r\n  to&nbsp;-870 (2010) (governing the appointment and compensation of GALs in\r\n  private actions).  Although\r\n  the family court divided the GAL fees between the Youngbloods and the Does, it\r\n  is unclear from the record on appeal how the issue was raised.  The record fails\r\n  to even imply the Youngbloods challenged the issue before the family court, and\r\n  they did not move for the family court to alter or amend the final order on the\r\n  issue.  Thus, the issue is not preserved for this court's review.  See, e.g., Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 217, 634 S.E.2d 51, 57 (Ct. App. 2006)\r\n  (finding that an issue not raised to the family court was not preserved for\r\n  appellate review).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Youngbloods' appeal of the removal was ultimately\r\n  decided in DSS's favor after the fair hearing committee found that the\r\n  Youngbloods were afforded due process.  No evidence shows the fair hearing\r\n  committee's decision was appealed to the Administrative Law Court.\r\n[2] The uncontested adoption of Child's four siblings, to\r\n  which DSS consented, was granted on May 4, 2010.  The Does' petition to adopt\r\n  Child was consolidated with the Youngbloods' petition, and the Does were\r\n  designated as intervenors.\r\n[3] The GAL was appointed on September 18, 2007, in the\r\n  wake of the siblings' removal from their biological parents' home.  The family\r\n  court ordered the GAL to stay on during the adoption proceedings.\r\n[4] Although\r\n  the family court has the authority to grant sibling visitation, we note no\r\n  South Carolina appellate court has addressed the specific issue of a family\r\n  court's authority to order visitation between a child and her biological\r\n  siblings when their legal relationship is severed by an adoption.  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-3-530(A)(44)\r\n  (2010) (effective May 27, 1998).  We decline to address that authority here when the issue was neither\r\n  disputed in the proceedings before the family court nor raised on review.  See,\r\n    e.g., Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 217, 634 S.E.2d 51, 57 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006) (finding that an issue not raised to the family court was not preserved\r\n  for appellate review); Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, 632, 576 S.E.2d\r\n  156, 166 (2003) (reiterating that rulings that are not appealed are the law of\r\n  the case).  \r\n[5] We note the only evidence in the record showing that\r\n  the parties requested attorney's fees from each other was a reference in the\r\n  family court's final order.  The petition for adoption filed by the Youngbloods\r\n  requested attorney's fees against DSS, not the Does.  However, because neither\r\n  side appeals the family court's discretion to award attorney's fees, we decline\r\n  to address whether they were properly requested.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-173","title":"SCDSS v.

Simpson, of Rock Hill, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n        Rosalee Davis, of Lancaster, for Guardian ad\r\n          Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Jacqueline\r\n  C. (Mother) appeals from the family court's final order granting termination of\r\n  parental rights (TPR) to her minor child (Child), arguing the family court\r\n  erred in: (1) terminating parental rights when the Department of Social\r\n  Services' (DSS) complaint did not contain sufficient underlying factual\r\n  circumstances to support the grounds of TPR; (2) applying a recently amended\r\n  statute to prevent extension of a permanency plan longer than eighteen months\r\n  after Child entered foster care; (3) granting TPR on the fifteen of twenty-two\r\n  months ground and the ground that Child was in foster care for eighteen months\r\n  when these grounds were not pled or in existence at the time of DSS's\r\n  complaint; and (4) failing to provide the notice required by section\r\n  63-7-1680(G) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011).  We affirm.[1]  \r\nAs to Mother's\r\n  issue regarding the sufficiency of the pleadings: &quot;A petition for [TPR] must set forth the: . . .\r\n  (6) grounds on which [TPR] are sought and the underlying factual\r\n  circumstances.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-2540(6) (2010).  Here, the TPR\r\n  complaint contains sufficient factual pleadings to apprise Mother of the action\r\n  pending against her.  Moreover, this issue was never raised to the family\r\n  court.  Accordingly, this argument is without merit.  \r\nAs to Mother's\r\n  issue regarding the extension of a\r\n  permanency plan longer than eighteen months: If at the permanency plan hearing,\r\n  the family court determines custody of the child should not yet be returned, &quot;but\r\n  that the child may be returned to the parent within a specified reasonable time\r\n  not to exceed eighteen months after the child was placed in foster care, the\r\n  court may order an extension of the [placement] plan.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  63-7-1700(F) (Supp. 2011).  The amended statute would apply because it was\r\n  effective at the time of the TPR hearing.  This section restricts the family\r\n  court from extending a plan to reunify the parents with Child past a period of\r\n  eighteen months.  Because extending a placement plan of reunification would\r\n  exceed this limit, the family court did not err.  Accordingly, we affirm.\r\nAs to Mother's\r\n  issue regarding the failure to provide\r\n  the notice required by statute: &quot;The court shall include in its order and\r\n  shall advise defendants on the record that failure to remedy the conditions\r\n  that caused the removal within six months, may result in termination of\r\n  parental rights . . . .&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 63-7-1680(G) (Supp. 2011). \r\n  Here, the family court followed the law at the time it adopted the placement\r\n  plan, and Mother received warning that failure to comply could result in TPR. \r\n  Accordingly, this issue is without merit.\r\nAs to Mother's\r\n  remaining issues: Mother failed to\r\n  challenge two of the statutory grounds for TPR and the finding that TPR was in\r\n  Child's best interest.  Therefore, these findings are the law of the case.  See Transp. Ins. Co. &amp; Flagstar Corp. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 389\r\n  S.C. 422, 431, 699 S.E.2d 687, 691 (2010) (&quot;An unappealed ruling is the law\r\n  of the case and requires affirmance.&quot;); see also S.C. Code Ann. §&nbsp;63-7-2570\r\n  (Supp. 2011) (stating the family court may order TPR upon finding one or more\r\n  of eleven statutory grounds is satisfied and also finding TPR is in the best\r\n  interest of the child).  Moreover, the record supports terminating Mother's\r\n  parental rights on the grounds set forth in the family court's order and the\r\n  finding that TPR is in Child's best interest.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  THOMAS, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-174","title":"Ellison v.

Appellants argue the\r\n  trial court erred in permitting the reading and admission of Dr. T. Rhett\r\n  Spencer, Jr.'s deposition because Dr. Spencer's testimony failed to satisfy the\r\n  &quot;most probably&quot; rule.  However, Appellants objected only after subsequent\r\n  questioning and the conclusion of direct examination.  Therefore, this issue is\r\n  unpreserved.  See&nbsp;Lindsey v.

Theodore Gentry, both\r\n          of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: James\r\n  Agnew and Virginia Agnew, d/b/a Agnew Arabians (Agnew Arabians), appeal the\r\n  circuit court's ruling denying their motion for entry of default and allowing\r\n  Century 21 Real Estate, LLC, (Century 21) to file a late answer, arguing the\r\n  circuit court (1) erroneously relied upon Rule 55(c), SCRCP, instead of Rule\r\n  6(b), SCRCP, and (2) failed to find good cause in support of its ruling.  We\r\n  affirm.[1].  \r\n1.  We\r\n  disagree with Agnew Arabians that the circuit court erroneously relied upon\r\n  Rule 55(c), SCRCP, for its ruling.  Although the order entered by the circuit\r\n  court does not explicitly reference the rule relied upon for its ruling, the\r\n  hearing transcript indicates the court acknowledged that Rule 55(c), SCRCP, did\r\n  not apply because default had not yet been entered.  Accordingly, this argument\r\n  is without merit.  \r\n2.  Rule 6(b), SCRCP, states that &quot;[w]hen by these\r\n  rules . . . an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified\r\n  time, . . . the court . . . may at any time in its discretion . . . upon motion\r\n  made after the expiration of the specified period, for good cause shown, permit\r\n  the act to be done.&quot;  A circuit court's decision to allow an enlargement\r\n  of time pursuant to Rule 6(b), SCRCP, is within the discretion of the circuit\r\n  court and will not be disturbed &quot;unless there is a clear showing of an\r\n  abuse of discretion.&quot;  Mauro v. Clabaugh, 299 S.C. 184, 191, 383\r\n  S.E.2d 244, 249 (Ct. App. 1989).  \r\nWe find the circuit\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion by denying Agnew Arabians' motion for the\r\n  entry of default and allowing Century 21 to file a late answer.  Although the\r\n  circuit court included no specific finding of good cause in its order denying\r\n  the motion for entry of default, the evidence presented by Century 21 supported\r\n  the circuit court's ruling.  Century 21 submitted an affidavit indicating that,\r\n  after reviewing the third-party complaint, it sent a letter to Agnew Arabians\r\n  requesting that it dismiss them from the action because none of the allegations\r\n  involved Century 21.    Without responding to the letter, Agnew Arabians\r\n  filed a motion for the entry of default.  Shortly after receiving the motion\r\n  and before the court entered default, Century 21 filed its answer.  After\r\n  determining Agnew Arabians would suffer no prejudice from allowing Century 21\r\n  to file an answer and that the entry of default would be too harsh a sanction\r\n  given the circumstances, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by\r\n  denying Agnew Arabians' motion to enter default and allowing Century 21 to file\r\n  a late answer.  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  KONDUROS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-183","title":"SCDSS v.

McKnight, of Charleston, for\r\n          Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: A and J, LLC owned an option to purchase\r\n  one of several mortgages held by KG Rescue, LLC.  When A and J exercised the\r\n  option, KG Rescue refused to transfer the mortgage, so A and J sued KG Rescue\r\n  for breach of contract.  While the lawsuit was pending, KG Golf Acquisition,\r\n  LLC, which owned the property encumbered by the mortgages, paid KG Rescue in\r\n  order to satisfy the mortgages.  KG Rescue used the money from that transaction\r\n  to repay loan debts it owed to Jessco Homes, Inc.,[1] Steeplechase, LLC, and Jeff Stahl,\r\n  one of KG Rescue's members. \r\nA and J later obtained\r\n  a money judgment against KG Rescue, but KG Rescue lacked funds to pay the\r\n  judgment.  A and J then filed this action against Respondents, asking the\r\n  master-in-equity to hold them liable for the judgment, either as KG Rescue's\r\n  partners or by piercing KG Rescue's corporate veil.  A and J also argued KG\r\n  Rescue's payments to Stahl, Jessco Homes, and Steeplechase were fraudulent and\r\n  should be set aside.  Finally, it argued KG Rescue's members owed A and J a\r\n  fiduciary duty to ensure that KG Rescue paid A and J's judgment before its\r\n  other debts.     \r\nIn ruling for\r\n  Respondents, the master-in-equity made several key findings of fact.  First,\r\n  the master found the payments KG Rescue made to Stahl, Jessco Homes, and\r\n  Steeplechase were repayments of loans they had made to KG Rescue.  Therefore,\r\n  the master found, KG Rescue's payments to Stahl, Jessco Homes, and Steeplechase\r\n  were supported by consideration.  The master also found that Respondents had no\r\n  actual intent to defraud A and J, and that KG Rescue's members did not engage\r\n  in self-dealing or act in conscious disregard of A and J's breach of contract\r\n  claim.  Finally, the master found Respondents were not KG Rescue's partners.\r\nHaving conducted\r\n  our own review of the record on appeal, we agree with the master's findings and\r\n  adopt them.  Considering those findings under the applicable law, we discover\r\n  no error in the master's rulings.  See Colleton Cnty.

Beard and Nicolas L. Haigler, both\r\n          of Columbia, for Respondents-Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In\r\n  this Workers' Compensation case, Brenda\r\n  Thigpen appeals from an order of the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina\r\n  Workers' Compensation Commission (Commission) reversing the single commissioner's\r\n  finding that Thigpen's claim for bi-lateral carpal tunnel syndrome was compensable\r\n  as a work-related repetitive trauma injury (RTI).  Lexington Medical Center\r\n  (Employer) and Companion Third Party Administrators (Carrier) appeal the\r\n  Commission's affirmance of the single commissioner's finding that Thigpen gave\r\n  timely notice, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 42-15-20.  We affirm the\r\n  Commission's order in its entirety.\r\nFACTS\r\nThigpen works as\r\n  a housekeeper at Lexington Medical Center where she is responsible for the\r\n  daily cleaning of eighteen patient rooms and public areas.  Her work activities include mopping, scrubbing,\r\n  changing bed linens, vacuuming, moving furniture, and bagging trash.  Thigpen\r\n  began experiencing &quot;numbness, sleepiness, [and] pain in the tip of [her]\r\n  finger&quot; while working on April 30, 2008.  She notified her supervisor of\r\n  these symptoms and, two months later, she saw her family physician, Dr. William\r\n  Korman, for concerns regarding hypertension and hand pain.  Dr. Korman\r\n  suspected carpal tunnel syndrome was causing Thigpen's hand pain, and he\r\n  referred Thigpen to Dr. Daniel Westerkam for nerve conduction studies.\r\nOn July 9, 2008,\r\n  Dr. Westerkam performed nerve conduction studies; thereafter, he informed\r\n  Thigpen that she had &quot;moderate&quot; carpal tunnel syndrome on the right\r\n  side and &quot;mild&quot; carpal tunnel syndrome on the left side.  On July 31,\r\n  2008, Thigpen filed an accident report with Employer stating she had developed\r\n  carpal tunnel symptoms in both wrists and her symptoms had started two months\r\n  earlier.  On September 24, 2008, Thigpen filed a Form 50 alleging she had\r\n  developed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as a result of work-related RTI to\r\n  her wrists.  \r\nAfter Thigpen's\r\n  symptoms worsened, Dr. Korman referred her to orthopedic surgeon Michael\r\n  Ugino.  On October 14, 2008, Dr. Ugino performed a right carpal tunnel\r\n  release.  On October 31, 2008, Employer filed a Form 51 contending: (1) Thigpen\r\n  had failed to give timely notice of her alleged RTI; and (2) Thigpen's carpal\r\n  tunnel syndrome was the result of a pre-existing disability that was unrelated\r\n  to her work activities.  On January 5, 2009, Dr. Ugino released Thigpen to\r\n  return to regular-duty work.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice of\r\n  Repetitive Trauma Injury\r\nOn appeal,\r\n  Employer contends the Commission erred in finding Thigpen had given timely\r\n  notice, pursuant to section 42-15-20, which states:  \r\n\r\n  In the\r\n    case of repetitive trauma, notice must be given by the employee within ninety\r\n    days of the date the employee discovered, or could have discovered by\r\n    exercising reasonable diligence, that his condition is compensable, unless\r\n    reasonable excuse is made to the satisfaction of the commission for not giving\r\n    timely notice, and the commission is satisfied that the employer has not been\r\n    unduly prejudiced thereby.  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-15-20(C)\r\n  (Supp. 2011); see also King v. International Knife and Saw-Florence,\r\n  395 S.C. 437, 444, 718 S.E.2d 227, 231 (Ct. App. 2011) (&quot;[A] work-related [RTI]\r\n  does not become compensable, and the ninety-day reporting clock does not start,\r\n  until the injured employee discovers or should discover he qualifies to receive\r\n  benefits for medical care, treatment, or disability due to his condition.&quot;).  \r\nWe agree with the\r\n  Commission's finding that &quot;notice\r\n  began to run at the earliest when [Thigpen] went to the doctor on June 27,\r\n  2008.&quot;  Because Thigpen provided notice on July 31, 2008 by filing an\r\n  accident report, we affirm the Commission's determination that notice was\r\n  timely.\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensability\r\n  of Repetitive Trauma Injury\r\nThigpen contends\r\n  the Commission erred in determining her claim for RTI is not compensable\r\n  because no causal connection exists between her work activities and the\r\n  development of her carpal tunnel syndrome.\r\nCompensability\r\n  of RTI is determined pursuant to section 42-1-172:  \r\n\r\n  (A) &quot;Repetitive\r\n    trauma injury&quot; means an injury which is gradual in onset and caused by the\r\n    cumulative effects of repetitive traumatic events.  Compensability of a repetitive\r\n      trauma injury must be determined only under the provisions of this statute.\r\n  (B) An\r\n    injury is not considered a compensable repetitive trauma injury unless a\r\n    commissioner makes a specific finding of fact by a preponderance of the\r\n    evidence of a causal connection that is established by medical evidence\r\n      between the repetitive activities that occurred while the employee was engaged\r\n      in the regular duties of his employment and the injury.\r\n  (C) As\r\n    used in this section, &quot;medical evidence&quot; means expert opinion or\r\n    testimony stated to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, documents,\r\n    records, or other material that is offered by a licensed and qualified medical\r\n    physician.\r\n  (D) A repetitive\r\n    trauma injury is considered to arise out of employment only if it is\r\n    established by medical evidence that there is a direct causal relationship\r\n      between the condition under which the work is performed and the injury.\r\n\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. § 42-1-172(A)-(D) (Supp. 2011) (emphases added).  \r\nBoth Dr. Korman and Dr. Ugino\r\n  distinguished &quot;causation&quot; of Thigpen's carpal tunnel syndrome from\r\n  the potential &quot;aggravation&quot; of an underlying condition.  Dr. Korman,\r\n  who stated he was not an expert on carpal tunnel syndrome, testified that\r\n  Thigpen's job duties could &quot;potentially exacerbate&quot; her carpal tunnel\r\n  syndrome.  Dr. Ugino, the orthopedic surgeon who performed Thigpen's surgery,\r\n  testified that he had not given any opinion on the causation of Thigpen's\r\n  carpal tunnel syndrome, he could not say what caused it, and he could not state\r\n  how long the condition had been present.  Dr. Ugino stated: &quot;[I'm] not\r\n  certain as to the causation of her carpal tunnel syndrome, but her job\r\n  activities, if she does a lot of repetitive flexion, extension activities most\r\n  probably can aggravate any preexisting problems.&quot;  \r\nWe affirm the\r\n  Commission's determination that Thigpen failed to demonstrate, by medical\r\n  evidence, the existence of a direct causal connection between the repetitive\r\n  activities of her work and her carpal tunnel syndrome.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the Commission's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-197","title":"State v.

Dickerson, 395 S.C. 101, 116, 716 S.E.2d 895, 903 (2011) (&quot;The\r\n  admission of evidence is within the circuit court's discretion and will not be\r\n  reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.&quot;); State v.\r\n    Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 378, 580 S.E.2d 785, 794 (Ct. App. 2003) (&quot;A\r\n  trial judge's decision regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial\r\n  effect of evidence should be reversed only in exceptional circumstances.  We .\r\n  . . are obligated to give great deference to the trial court's judgment\r\n  [regarding Rule 403].&quot; (internal citation omitted)).\r\nThe decision of the trial\r\n  court is AFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and HUFF and SHORT,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-198","title":"Rouse v.

(the Progressive\r\n  Church), and Respondents Elder Roscoe Black, Arthur Alford, William Stephens,\r\n  Aquilera Black, Antonio Black, and Aderia Black, individually and as trustees\r\n  for the Progressive Church of Bishopville (the Bishopville Congregation).  On\r\n  appeal, the Progressive Church argues: (1) it is the owner of the disputed\r\n  property; (2) it has standing to bring this suit; and (3) neutral principles of\r\n  law require that it be declared owner of the disputed property. We affirm. \r\n1.&nbsp; As to the ownership of\r\n  the property, we apply a neutral principles of law approach and find the Progressive\r\n  Church failed to meet its burden of demonstrating error in the trial court's\r\n  determination that the Bishopville Congregation is the owner of the disputed\r\n  property. See Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 392, 709 S.E.2d 650,\r\n  655 (2011) (stating the trial court's factual findings will be affirmed unless the\r\n  appellant satisfies the court that the preponderance of the evidence is against\r\n  the trial court's findings); All\r\n    Saints Parish Waccamaw v. Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of S.C., 385 S.C. 428, 445, 685 S.E.2d 163, 172 (2009)\r\n  (&quot;[W]here a civil court can completely resolve a church dispute on neutral\r\n  principles of law, the First Amendment commands it to do so.&quot;); Crystal\r\n    Pines Homeowners Ass'n v.

Code Ann. § 42-9-400 (2003)[1] (setting out what an employer or insurance carrier must prove to receive\r\n  reimbursement); Bartley, 392 S.C. at 306, 709 S.E.2d at 622 (&quot;[T]his\r\n  Court must affirm the findings of fact made by the Commission if they are supported\r\n  by substantial evidence.&quot;).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and HUFF and SHORT, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Section 42-9-400 was amended in 2007.  2007 S.C.

Kinsey appeals the family court's equitable distribution of the marital\r\n  estate, including evidentiary issues and the family court's determination that\r\n  The Kinsey Corporation was not marital property.  We affirm.\r\n1.&nbsp; We find no error in the family court awarding\r\n  Husband 60% of the marital estate and Wife 40%.  See Doe v. Doe,\r\n  370 S.C. 206, 213-14, 634 S.E.2d 51, 55 (2006) (stating the appellate court\r\n  looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment, and it is irrelevant that\r\n  this court might have weighed specific factors set forth in Section 20-3-620(B)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) differently than the family court); Fitzwater\r\n    v. Fitzwater, ___ S.C. ___, ___, 721 S.E.2d 7, 12 (Ct. App. 2011) (stating\r\n  while a 50-50 division is considered guidance for an appropriate division, it\r\n  is not mandatory).  The family court made detailed findings on each of the\r\n  factors set forth in section 20-3-620(B).  It emphasized at the hearing on\r\n  Wife's motion to alter or amend it did not rely on Wife's marital misconduct in\r\n  determining the division.  The family court also carefully considered the\r\n  parties' indirect and direct contributions, including that over the course of\r\n  the marriage, Husband earned 86.07% of the income while Wife earned 13.93%.  Wife\r\n  failed to meet her burden of proving the family court's division of the marital\r\n  estate was against the preponderance of the evidence.  See Lewis v.\r\n    Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 392, 709 S.E.2d 650, 655 (2011) (stating the burden is\r\n  on the appellant to demonstrate the family court's findings are against the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence).  \r\n2.&nbsp; As to Wife's argument the family court erred\r\n  in admitting into evidence and relying upon evidence of Wife's paramour's\r\n  wealth, we find no reversible error.  See Divine v. Robbins, 385\r\n  S.C. 23, 37, 683 S.E.2d 286, 293 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating to warrant reversal\r\n  based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the complaining party must\r\n  prove both error and resulting prejudice).  Although the family court allowed Husband\r\n  to testify as to what Wife told him was her paramour's net worth, the court\r\n  specifically stated at the hearing on Wife's motion to alter or amend and in\r\n  its order on the motion that wife's adultery and her paramour's wealth did not\r\n  affect its decision to divide the property 60-40.  We find Wife failed to\r\n  establish any prejudice from the admission of the evidence.  \r\n3.&nbsp; We\r\n  find no merit to Wife's argument the family court erred in finding she\r\n  abandoned the marital residence.  The family court did not consider desertion\r\n  as a fault ground for divorce.  In addition, Wife does not assert on appeal\r\n  that she is entitled to a credit due to Husband's decision to pay the mortgage\r\n  through the equity line.  We find no indication this statement affected the\r\n  family court's decision; thus, we find no error.  See McCall v.\r\n    Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;[W]hatever\r\n  doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.&quot;).\r\n4.&nbsp; We find the family court did not err in\r\n  including in the marital estate the automobile Wife's son drove.  Wife does not\r\n  challenge the family court's valuation or allocation of the value of the\r\n  vehicle to her.  She only asserts the vehicle was not marital property.  Because\r\n  the vehicle was owned by Husband at the time of the commencement of this\r\n  action, it was marital property.  See S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-630(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2011) (defining marital property as &quot;all real and personal property\r\n  which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is\r\n    owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . .&quot;)\r\n  (emphasis added).  \r\n5.&nbsp; We find Wife's argument that the family court\r\n  erred in failing to require Husband to first utilize the money in the Kinsey\r\n  Rental Account for expenses associated with the parties' beach house before any\r\n  other marital funds were used is conclusory and therefore abandoned.  See Bennett v. Investors Title Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 578, 599, 635 S.E.2d 649,\r\n  660 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding appellants' abandoned issue where they failed to\r\n  cite any case law for a proposition and made only conclusory arguments in\r\n  support).\r\n6.&nbsp; We find Wife failed to support with authority her\r\n  argument the family court erred in giving Husband complete control for the\r\n  listing and sale of the parties' properties; thus, this issue is abandoned.  See Bennett, 370 S.C. at 599, 635 S.E.2d at 660 (finding appellants'\r\n  abandoned issue where they failed to cite any case law for a proposition and\r\n  made only conclusory arguments in support).  We furthermore find no error.  The\r\n  parties had already experienced difficulties reaching agreements in selling the\r\n  marital assets.  As the family court noted, both parties would benefit from\r\n  achieving the maximum price and neither party was motivated to sell the\r\n  properties for less than the maximum value.  We find Wife failed to meet her\r\n  burden of proving error.  See Lewis, 392 S.C. at 392, 709 S.E.2d\r\n  at 655 (stating the burden is on the appellant to demonstrate the family\r\n  court's findings are against the preponderance of the evidence).  \r\n7.&nbsp; We find Wife also failed to support with\r\n  authority her argument the family court erred in failing to order that the\r\n  money held in escrow be paid to the parties, and thereafter the parties be\r\n  required to pay proportionally toward expenses associated with the remaining\r\n  properties of the parties.  This issue is abandoned.  See Bennett,\r\n  370 S.C. at 599, 635 S.E.2d at 660 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding appellants'\r\n  abandoned issue where they failed to cite any case law for a proposition and\r\n  made only conclusory arguments in support).  In the alternative, given the\r\n  parties' histories, we find the family court did not err in putting in place a\r\n  mechanism to ensure the payment of marital debt until the assets could be sold See Lewis, 392 S.C. at 392, 709 S.E.2d at 655 (stating the burden is on the\r\n  appellant to demonstrate the family court's findings are against the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence).  \r\n8.&nbsp; We find the family court did not err in\r\n  holding The Kinsey Company had not been transmuted into marital property and\r\n  that Wife was not entitled to a special equity in the business.  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. § 20-3-630(A)(2) (Supp. 2011) (stating property acquired prior to the\r\n  marriage is generally considered nonmarital); S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-630(A)(5)\r\n  (Supp. 2011) (stating marital property does not include &quot;any increase in\r\n  value in nonmarital property, except to the extent that the increase resulted\r\n  directly or indirectly from efforts of the other spouse during marriage&quot;); Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110-11 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988) (stating although nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital\r\n  property, the spouse claiming nonmarital property has been transmuted must\r\n  produce objective evidence showing the parties themselves regarded the property\r\n  as the common property of the marriage); id. at 295-96, 372 S.E.2d at\r\n  111 (&quot;The mere use of separate property to support the marriage, without\r\n  some additional evidence of intent to treat it as property of the marriage, is\r\n  not sufficient to establish transmutation.&quot;).  Husband formed The Kinsey\r\n  Company in 1994.  Wife never owned any stock in the corporation or served as an\r\n  officer.  Although The Kinsey Company significantly increased in value over the\r\n  course of the marriage, as the family court noted, Husband's efforts during the\r\n  late 1990's housing boom were the primary reason for the growth of the\r\n  company.  While Wife worked as the exclusive interior designer for The Kinsey\r\n  Company, she did this work through other companies where she was an employee\r\n  until forming her own company, Palmetto Interiors, in 2001.  The record\r\n  supports the family court's ruling Wife was sufficiently compensated for her\r\n  services to The Kinsey Company and Wife did not provide any benefit to the\r\n  company that could not have been obtained through another decorator.  See Arnal v. Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 294, 609 S.E.2d 821, 835 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (finding husband was not entitled to special equity interest where he was\r\n  compensated for work and his work amounted to very little time actually spent); Webber v. Webber, 285 S.C. 425, 429, 330 S.E.2d 79, 81 (Ct. App. 1985)\r\n  (holding evidence did not show wife's contribution to business was material\r\n  when she did not contribute funds to start the business and she did not\r\n  contribute very much uncompensated service to the business).  In addition, we\r\n  find no evidence Husband co-mingled marital funds with those from The Kinsey\r\n  Company.  Accordingly, we find Wife failed to prove Husband intended for The\r\n  Kinsey Company to be a marital asset.  \r\n9.&nbsp; We\r\n  find no merit in Wife's argument the family court erred in ordering her to\r\n  return certain items of personal property to the Edisto House.  The court did\r\n  not accuse Wife of &quot;stripping&quot; the house, but merely required her to\r\n  return marital property to the house unless the parties agreed otherwise.  Wife\r\n  contends the family court erred in granting relief not requested.  Because she\r\n  failed to raise this contention to the family court in her motion to alter or\r\n  amend, it is not preserved.  See In re Estate of Timmerman, 331\r\n  S.C. 455, 460, 502 S.E.2d 920, 922 (Ct. App. 1998) (&quot;When a party receives\r\n  an order that grants certain relief not previously contemplated or presented to\r\n  the trial court, the aggrieved party must move, pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  to alter or amend the judgment in order to preserve the issue for appeal.&quot;).\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ.,  concur.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2012-UP-213","title":"State v.
