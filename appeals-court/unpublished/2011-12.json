Franklin C. Reaves, pro se, of\r\n          Chadbourn, North Carolina.\r\n        Douglas C. Baxter and Mason A. Summers, both\r\n          of Myrtle Beach; and Robert T. King, of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Franklin C. Reaves appeals the denial of\r\n  his motion to reconsider the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to Respondents.Â  Reaves argues the circuit court erred\r\n  in granting summary judgment based on a violation of the statute of limitations\r\n  applicable to the recovery of land sold at tax sales when he did not receive\r\n  the statutory notice of delinquent taxes and, in the alternative, paid the\r\n  taxes for the period during which the property was sold.[1] Â We dismiss the appeal as\r\n  moot. [2]\r\nReaves's issues\r\n  on appeal stem from his claim that Respondents failed to give him notice of the\r\n  delinquent property taxes as required in section 12-51-40 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 1997).Â  Assuming without deciding that Reaves's claim of lack of\r\n  notice is supported by evidence and would entitle him to relief, the remedy\r\n  would consist of setting aside the tax sale of the property at issue.Â  See Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht\r\n    Sales, Inc., 342 S.C. 352, 364-65,\r\n  536 S.E.2d 698, 704 (Ct. App. 2000) (&quot;[A]ll\r\n  conditions governing tax sales are mandatory and strictly enforced. . . . [and\r\n  an appellate court] will set aside tax sales where the requisite statutory\r\n  conditions of [section] 12-51-40 have not been complied with by public\r\n  officials.&quot;).Â  However, subsequent to the tax deed being issued, the\r\n  purchaser at the tax sale reconveyed the property to Reaves.Â  Therefore, setting aside the tax sale and consequently cancelling\r\n  the deed from the property record would have no practical legal effect, and\r\n  this appeal is moot.Â  See Sloan v.\r\n    Greenville Cnty., 380 S.C. 528, 535, 670\r\n  S.E.2d 663, 667 (Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;An\r\n  appellate court will not pass judgment on moot and academic questions; it will\r\n  not adjudicate a matter when no actual controversy capable of specific relief\r\n  exists.Â  A case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical\r\n  legal effect upon the existing controversy.&quot;).Â  \r\nAPPEAL\r\n  DISMISSED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  WILLIAMS, and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]The\r\n  circuit court's order separately granted Respondents' motion for summary\r\n  judgment as to Reaves's claim for damages resulting from Respondents' failure\r\n  to give him notice on the basis of the statute of limitations from the South\r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act.Â  Reaves did not appeal that portion of the circuit\r\n  court's order.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-528","title":"State v.

Hiser, all of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Thomas\r\n  J. Owens appeals the denial of his workers' compensation claim by the Appellate Panel of the\r\n  South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission (the Appellate Panel), arguing\r\n  the Appellate Panel erred in finding he did not suffer a compensable injury\r\n  arising out of and in the course of his employment.Â  Specifically, Owens\r\n  contends his injury was compensable because it resulted from unusual or\r\n  excessive exertion caused by rapidly ascending one hundred feet of stairs in\r\n  approximately two and a half minutes during the heat of the day.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nAn employee may receive\r\n  workers' compensation benefits for an injury &quot;arising out of and in the\r\n  course of employment.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160(A) (Supp. 2010).Â  However, heart attacks &quot;arising\r\n  out of and in the course of employment unaccompanied by physical injury are not\r\n  considered compensable if they result from any event or series of events which\r\n  are incidental to normal employer/employee relations . . . , except when these\r\n  actions are taken in an extraordinary and unusual manner.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann.Â  Â§ 42-1-160(C) (Supp. 2010); see also Black v.\r\n    Barnwell Cnty.,&nbsp;243 S.C. 531, 535, 134 S.E.2d 753, 755&nbsp;(1964) (&quot;The\r\n  general rule has been adopted in this State that a coronary attack suffered by\r\n  an employee constitutes a compensable accident . . . if it is induced by\r\n  unexpected strain or over-exertion in the performance of the duties of his\r\n  employment, or by unusual and extraordinary conditions in the employment.&quot;).Â  In\r\n  order to prove a heart attack occurring at work constitutes a compensable\r\n  injury, the claimant must show (1) the employee's exertion during the\r\n  performance of his duties at work was unusual and extraordinary and (2) a\r\n  causal connection existed between the exertion during his employment and the\r\n  heart attack.Â  Black, 243 S.C. at 535-36, 134 S.E.2d at 755.Â  &quot;If the\r\n  evidence was conflicting upon these issues, or either of them, such conflicts\r\n  in the evidence could only be resolved by the [Appellate Panel], the\r\n  fact-finding body.&quot;Â  Id. at&nbsp;536, 134 S.E.2d at 755.\r\nWe find substantial evidence\r\n  supports the Appellate Panel's finding that Owens did not suffer a compensable\r\n  injury arising out of and in the course of his employment.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann.

Detwiler and Ian D. McVey, both\r\n          of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Creative\r\n  Communication Services (CCS) appeals the amount of damages the trial court\r\n  awarded on its claim for negligent misrepresentation against PAD Able, Inc. d/b/a Harold R. Beard Agency (PAD\r\n  Able).Â  It argues the trial court erred\r\n  in applying the doctrine of mitigation of damages in favor of a defaulting\r\n  defendant.Â  CCS asserts the doctrine is an affirmative defense, which must be\r\n  pleaded.\r\nAlthough Rule 8(c) of the\r\n  South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure does not specifically list mitigation\r\n  of damages as an affirmative defense, it requires the defendant to affirmatively\r\n  set forth in addition to the listed defenses &quot;any other matter\r\n  constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.&quot;Â  \r\nUnder our former code\r\n  pleading, the South Carolina Supreme Court recognized mitigation of damages\r\n  must be pleaded and proved by the party asserting it.Â  White v. Metcalf,\r\n  174 S.C. 350, 356, 177 S.E. 371, 374 (1934).Â  More recently, our courts have\r\n  recognized the burden of proof lies on the party asserting mitigation.Â  See Sloan Constr. Co. v. Southco Grassing, Inc., Op. No. 27061 (S.C. Sup.\r\n  Ct. filed Oct. 31, 2011) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 38 at 32, 40) (&quot;The\r\n  defendant has the burden of establishing the plaintiff's lack of due diligence\r\n  in mitigating damages.&quot;); Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 262, 599\r\n  S.E.2d 467, 478 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating the party who claims damages should\r\n  have been minimized has the burden of proving they could reasonably have been\r\n  avoided or reduced); cf. Youmans v. S.C.

App. 2008) (stating defendant asserting\r\n  an affirmative defense bears the burden of its proof).Â  Generally, the failure\r\n  to plead an affirmative defense constitutes a waiver of that defense.Â  Earthscapes\r\n    Unlimited, Inc. v. Ulbrich, 390 S.C. 609, 615, 703 S.E.2d 221, 224 (2010).Â \r\n  A party cannot benefit from an affirmative defense that was never pleaded.Â  Id. at 616, 703 S.E.2d at 225.\r\nWe find the trial court erred\r\n  in applying the doctrine of mitigation of damages sue sponte.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  matter is remanded to the trial court for a recalculation of damages.[1]Â  \r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We further note PAD Able failed to file a\r\n  Respondent's Brief with this court.Â  Rule\r\n  208(a)(4), SCACR, provides in part: &quot;Upon the failure of respondent to\r\n  timely file a brief, the appellate court may take such action as it deems\r\n  proper.&quot;Â  Such action may include reversal.Â  Turner v.

Adams, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  James Anthony Tucker appeals his\r\n  convictions for assault and battery with intent to kill (ABWIK) and armed\r\n  robbery.Â  Tucker argues the trial court erred in admitting irrelevant testimony\r\n  and improperly instructing the jury during trial.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1. We find the\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the victim's testimony\r\n  regarding the changes in his lifestyle after the defendant attacked him.Â  Generally,\r\n  &quot;[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible,&quot; and &quot;[e]vidence which\r\n  is not relevant is not admissible.&quot;Â  Rule 402, SCRE.Â  Evidence is relevant\r\n  if it has &quot;any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\n  consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable\r\n  than it would be without the evidence.&quot;Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  Additionally,\r\n  among the essential elements of ABWIK, the State must prove intent.Â  State\r\n    v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 15, 479 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1996).Â  &quot;Such intent may\r\n  be shown by acts and conduct from which a jury may naturally and reasonably\r\n  infer intent.&quot;Â  Id. at 16\r\n  n.4, 479 S.E.2d at 52 n.4.Â  Here, in presenting the victim's testimony\r\n  regarding new precautions he had taken since he was attacked, the State introduced\r\n  evidence tending to show the victim's impression that Tucker intended to kill\r\n  the victim.Â  The victim's testimony suggests he took these precautions to\r\n  protect his own life in the future because he believed Tucker intended to kill\r\n  him during the initial attack.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in\r\n  admitting the victim's testimony.Â  \r\n2.

Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 414, 405 S.E.2d 377, 380 (1991).Â  In the instant\r\n  case, the trial court conducted a sufficient inquiry into the basis of Goodman's\r\n  complaints against his counsel.Â  The trial court inquired regarding counsel's\r\n  preparations for trial, his communications with Goodman, and general experience\r\n  with criminal cases and determined Goodman's counsel was adequately prepared to\r\n  go forward with the case.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in denying Goodman's motion to relieve counsel.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although Goodman argues on appeal the trial court\r\n  violated his right to proceed pro se, a review of the record reveals Goodman\r\n  did not move to proceed pro se at trial.Â  Accordingly, this argument is not\r\n  preserved for review.Â  See S.C.

Franklin-Best, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General John\r\n  W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Mark R. Farthing, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Isaac McDuffie\r\n  Stone, III, of Bluffton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Naomi\r\n  Bonnie Adams appeals her conviction for neglect of a vulnerable adult resulting\r\n  in great bodily injury.Â  On appeal, Adams contends the trial court erred in denying her motion for a directed\r\n  verdict because the State failed to present any evidence regarding the standard\r\n  of care necessary for a diabetic with a brain tumor and the State failed to\r\n  present any evidence the ostensive neglect caused the victim to suffer great\r\n  bodily injury.Â  Adams also argues the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce photographs of the victim\r\n  that were unduly prejudicial and not supported by medical testimony.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\n1.&nbsp; We\r\n  find the trial court did not err in denying Adams's motion for a directed\r\n  verdict on both grounds.Â  See State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292,\r\n  625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006) (stating that when ruling on a motion for a directed\r\n  verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of\r\n  evidence, not its weight); id. at 292-93, 625 S.E.2d at 648 (finding the\r\n  case was properly submitted to the jury if the appellate court finds any direct\r\n  evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove\r\n  the guilt of the accused); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 43-35-85(E) (Supp. 2009) (&quot;A\r\n  person who knowingly and willfully abuses or neglects a vulnerable adult\r\n  resulting in great bodily injury is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction,\r\n  must be imprisoned not more than fifteen years.&quot;);&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  43-35-10(6) (Supp. 2009) (defining neglect as &quot;the failure or omission of\r\n  a caregiver to provide the care, goods, or services necessary to maintain the\r\n  health or safety of a vulnerable adult including, but not limited to, food,\r\n  clothing, medicine, shelter, supervision, and medical services&quot;).Â  Here,\r\n  evidence exists that Adams committed neglect of a vulnerable adult based on the\r\n  statutory definition of neglect, which does not require the showing of a\r\n  standard of care supported by expert medical testimony.Â  Evidence shows Adams\r\n  failed to provide the victim adequate clothing and failed to monitor her\r\n  glucose level or fluid intake, leading to hospitalization.Â  The combination of\r\n  hypertension, dehydration, and low blood sugar was serious enough to result in\r\n  an extended stay in the intensive care unit. Â Accordingly, because the evidence\r\n  presented supports the trial court's decision to submit the case to the jury,\r\n  the trial court did not err in denying Adams's directed verdict motion.Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; We find the\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the State to introduce photographs of the victim.Â  See&nbsp;State v. Torres, 390 S.C.\r\n  618, 622-23, 703 S.E.2d 226, 228 (2010) (&quot;The relevance, materiality, and\r\n  admissibility of photographs are matters within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court and a ruling will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of\r\n  discretion.&quot; (citation and quotations omitted)); id. at 623, 703\r\n  S.E.2d at 229 (&quot;It is well settled in this state that [i]f the photograph\r\n  serves to corroborate testimony, it is not an abuse of discretion to admit\r\n  it.&quot; (citation and quotations omitted)).Â  The photographs the trial court allowed were corroborative of the\r\n  testimony regarding the victim's condition.Â  Thus, the trial court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.

Bright Ariail, of Charleston, for\r\n  Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Leslie\r\n  Roth appeals the trial court's distribution of funds held pursuant to an escrow\r\n  agreement.Â  He argues the trial court erred in holding he was not\r\n  entitled to the funds remaining in escrow.Â  \r\n&quot;When the language of a contract is clear,\r\n  explicit, and unambiguous, the language of the contract alone determines the\r\n  contract's force and effect, and the court must construe it according to its\r\n  plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.&quot; Â Moser v. Gosnell, 334 S.C.\r\n  425, 430, 513 S.E.2d 123, 125 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The escrow agreement clearly\r\n  provided that any excess funds left after payment for each punch list item were\r\n  to be returned to Baron L. McCaskill, III and Blane O. Ruschak (Purchasers).Â \r\n  It also provided that any funds remaining in escrow after a year were to be\r\n  returned to Purchasers without the need for further action on the part of Purchasers,\r\n  Seller, or Escrow Agent.Â  The escrow agreement did not provide for any funds\r\n  remaining in escrow to be given to Roth.Â  It is irrelevant whether Purchasers\r\n  included items that were outside of the escrowed items or cost more than the\r\n  allowed amount because Roth was not entitled under the agreement to any excess\r\n  funds remaining after the punch list items were completed.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court's order is \r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nHUFF, PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Purchasers argue the appeal is moot because Roth\r\n  failed to stay the trial court's order providing for the escrow agent to\r\n  release the funds to Purchasers' attorneys.Â  A case becomes moot when some\r\n  event occurs making it impossible for the reviewing court to grant effectual\r\n  relief and the judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon\r\n  the existing controversy.Â  Linda Mc Co. v.

Couch, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2011-UP-554\r\nHeard October 19, 2011 â€“ Filed December 9,\r\n  2011Â Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWilliam S.F. Freeman, of Greenville, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\nRobert Lawrence Reibold, of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Sign-N-Ryde, LLC, appeals the dismissal\r\n  of its claims against Larry King Chevrolet, LLC, for false light invasion of\r\n  privacy, breach of implied warranty, and violation of the South Carolina\r\n  Regulation of Manufacturers, Distributors and Dealers Act.Â  We affirm.\r\n1. As to the dismissal of the\r\n  cause of action for false light invasion of privacy, we agree with Sign-N-Ryde\r\n  that dismissal of this claim at the pleading stage solely on the ground that it\r\n  has not yet been recognized as an actionable tort is premature.Â  See Madison\r\n    v. Am. Home Prods. Corp., 358 S.C. 449, 451, 595 S.E.2d 493, 494 (2004)\r\n  (&quot;As a general rule, important questions of novel impression should not be\r\n  decided on a motion to dismiss.&quot;).Â  Nevertheless, we hold the dismissal\r\n  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, on the ground that the complaint did not\r\n  allege Larry King Chevrolet publicized facts specifically about Sign-N-Ryde was\r\n  proper.Â  See Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 652E (1977) (stating\r\n  a party is subject to liability for false light invasion of privacy if that\r\n  party &quot;gives publicity to a matter concerning another that places\r\n  the other before the public in a false light&quot; (emphasis added)).Â  Here, Sign-N-Ryde\r\n  asserted only that Larry King Chevrolet &quot;caused the cars to be identified\r\n  in the system as stolen&quot;; there is no allegation in the complaint that Larry\r\n  King Chevrolet made any representations concerning Sign-N-Ryde. \r\n2. We hold the trial court\r\n  correctly dismissed Sign-N-Ryde's claim for breach of warranty of merchantability\r\n  based on the absence of any allegation that the vehicles were mechanically\r\n  defective.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-314 (2003) (stating that for goods\r\n  to be merchantable, they must (1) pass without objection in the trade under the\r\n  contract description; (2) if fungible, be of fair average quality; (3) be fit\r\n  for the ordinary purposes for which they are used; (4) run, within variation\r\n  permitted by the sales agreement, of even kind, quality, and quantity within\r\n  each unit and among all units involved; (5) be adequately contained, packaged,\r\n  and labeled as the agreement may require; and (6) when applicable, conform to\r\n  other warranties from course of dealing or trade usage); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  36-2-315 (2003) (providing a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is\r\n  implied if &quot;the seller at the time of contracting has reason to\r\n  know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that\r\n  the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or\r\n  furnish suitable goods&quot; (emphasis added)).Â  The vehicles involved in this\r\n  action were purchased by Sign-N-Ryde from a third party that in turn had obtained\r\n  them from Larry King Chevrolet; therefore, no buyer-seller relationship existed\r\n  between Sign-N-Ryde and Larry King Chevrolet.Â  Moreover, Larry King Chevrolet\r\n  acknowledged in its brief that it did not seek dismissal of a separate cause of\r\n  action arising from Sign-N-Ryde's assertion that it &quot;was an innocent\r\n  holder in due course who gave valuable consideration for title to the\r\n  vehicles.&quot;Â  Because we affirm the dismissal of the breach of warranty\r\n  claims based on Sign-N-Ryde's failure to allege any problems with the vehicles\r\n  other than title defects, we need not address Sign-N-Ryde's argument that the\r\n  trial court, in dismissing these claims, incorrectly relied on North Carolina\r\n  law to hold that privity was required.Â  See Futch v.

Barnette of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Allen Armfield appeals his conviction for\r\n  second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  Armfield argues the trial\r\n  court erred in admitting his statement into evidence and refusing to give the\r\n  jury his requested jury charge.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.Â  We find the\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Armfield's statement to\r\n  police.Â  A trial court's factual findings as to the voluntariness of a\r\n  statement will not be disturbed on appeal unless they constitute an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 243, 471 S.E.2d 689, 695 (1996).Â  Among these circumstances, the court may\r\n  consider police coercion; the length of interrogation; its location; its\r\n  continuity; and the defendant's maturity, education, and mental health.Â  State\r\n    v. Goodwin, 384 S.C. 588, 601, 683 S.E.2d 500, 507 (Ct. App. 2009) (citing Winthrow\r\n      v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, 693 (1993)).Â  Here, the evidence presented\r\n  establishes Armfield freely and voluntarily gave his statement to police.Â \r\n  Initially, Armfield's interview with police lasted only forty minutes and\r\n  within ten minutes Armfield had confessed to police.Â  Additionally, when\r\n  Armfield arrived at the interview, he was neither confined to the interview\r\n  room nor was he under arrest.Â  Further, Armfield admits he was never threatened\r\n  with physical harm.Â  Moreover, as a fifty-three-year-old man with twelve years\r\n  of education, Armfield's personal characteristics do not present any\r\n  circumstances that would make him more susceptible to making an involuntary\r\n  statement due to coercion.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not err in\r\n  admitting Armfield's statement.\r\n2.Â  Because the trial court\r\n  is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina, we\r\n  find the trial court did not err in refusing Armfield's improper bolstering\r\n  jury charge.Â  State v.

Williams and J. Jay Hulst, both of Moncks Corner,\r\n          for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellants Alan Fiddie and Joyce Fiddie (collectively\r\n  Appellants) appeal from the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\n  Respondents on Appellants' adverse possession claim.Â  On appeal, Appellants\r\n  argue the trial court erred in failing to apply the presumption of ouster and\r\n  that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Appellants ousted\r\n  Respondents and adversely possessed the disputed property. We affirm.\r\n1. As to the grant of summary judgment\r\n  in favor of Respondents, we find there is no genuine issue of material fact as\r\n  to whether Appellants held the disputed property in an actual, open, notorious,\r\n  exclusive, continuous, and hostile manner that amounted to an ouster of\r\n  Respondents. Appellants' subjective belief that Respondents had to ask their\r\n  permission to come on the property did not create a genuine issue of material\r\n  fact. See Rule 56(c), SCRCP (stating summary judgment is proper where no\r\n  genuine issue exists as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled\r\n  to judgment as a matter of law); Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381\r\n  S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009) (noting cases with a heightened\r\n  burden of proof require the nonmoving party to submit more than a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence to withstand a motion for summary judgment);Â  Jones v.\r\n    Leagan, 384 S.C. 1, 10-11, 681 S.E.2d 6, 11 (Ct. App. 2009) (finding an\r\n  adverse possession claim requires the claimant to prove by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence his possession of the disputed property was continuous, hostile,\r\n  actual, open, notorious, and exclusive for the statutory period); Wells v.\r\n    Coursey, 197 S.C. 483, ___, 15 S.E.2d 752, 755 (1941) (&quot;In order that\r\n  one of several cotenants may acquire title by adverse possession as against the\r\n  others, his possession must be such an actual, open, notorious, exclusive and\r\n  hostile character as to amount to an ouster to the other cotenants. . . . The\r\n  acts relied on to establish an ouster must be of an unequivocal nature, and so\r\n  distinctly hostile to the rights of the other cotenants that the intention to\r\n  disseize is clear and unmistakable.&quot;); Jones, 384 S.C. at 13-14,\r\n  681 S.E.2d at 12 (&quot;[T]he determination of whether possession is open and\r\n  notorious is made from the viewpoint of the legal owner exercising ordinary\r\n  diligence, not from the viewpoint of the adverse possessor.&quot;).Â  \r\n2. As to whether the trial court erred\r\n  in failing to apply the presumption of ouster, we find the issue is not\r\n  preserved for our review. See Shirley's Iron Works, Inc. v. City of\r\n    Union, 387 S.C. 389, 400, 693 S.E.2d 1, 6 (Ct. App. 2010) (&quot;[F]or an\r\n  issue to be preserved for appeal, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by\r\n  the trial court.&quot;); Church v. McGee, 391 S.C. 334, 347, 705 S.E.2d\r\n  481, 488 (Ct. App. 2011) (&quot;Post-trial\r\n  motions are not necessary to preserve issues that have already been ruled on;\r\n  they are used to preserve those that have been raised to the trial court but\r\n  not yet ruled on by it.&quot;); Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C.\r\n  9, 24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (stating a party must file a Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP, motion when &quot;an issue or argument has been raised, but not ruled\r\n  on, in order to preserve it for appellate review&quot;).\r\n3. As to the remaining issues raised on\r\n  appeal, we decline to address Appellants' arguments, as they are not necessary\r\n  to the decision of this appeal.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an\r\n  appellate court need not review remaining issues on appeal when its\r\n  determination of a prior issue is dispositive).

Reed, of Columbia, for\r\n          Appellants.\r\n        Mindy Westbrook Zimmerman, of Newberry,\r\n          for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Billy\r\n  and Donna Norton appeal the trial court's ruling in favor of Wayne Turner on\r\n  their negligence cause of action arising from the delivery and set-up of their\r\n  mobile home.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\n1) Duty:Â  The Nortons\r\n  argue the trial court erred in ruling they presented insufficient evidence that\r\n  Turner was an agent of Newberry Home Center (NHC).Â  &quot;An agent is one\r\n  appointed by a principal as his representative and to whom the principal\r\n  confides the management of some business to be transacted in the principal's\r\n  name, or on his account, and who brings about or effects legal relationships\r\n  between the principal and third parties.&quot; Â Colleton Cnty. Taxpayers\r\n    Ass'n v. Sch. Dist. of Colleton Cnty., 371 S.C. 224, 239, 638 S.E.2d 685,\r\n  693 (2006) (quoting Thompson v. Ford Motor Co., 200 S.C. 393, 414, 21\r\n  S.E.2d 34, 43 (1942)).Â  The trial court did not find Turner was not acting on\r\n  behalf of NHC, but rather was explaining there was insufficient evidence Turner\r\n  was acting pursuant to a separate agreement with the Nortons.Â  There is no\r\n  evidence in the record whether Turner was an employee of NHC or an independent\r\n  contractor.Â  We find no error in that ruling.Â  \r\nThe Nortons argue that even\r\n  as an agent of NHC, Turner can be held liable for his own negligent acts.Â  The\r\n  court recognized this principle of law in its order on Turner's motion to alter\r\n  or amend.Â  \r\nFinally, the Nortons assert under\r\n  this issue that because Turner undertook the responsibility of moving and\r\n  setting up the Nortons' home, he owed them a duty of care.Â  The Turners never\r\n  argued to the trial court a duty by undertaking.Â  This issue is not preserved.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733\r\n  (1998) (&quot;It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time\r\n  on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review.&quot;).\r\n2)Â  Breach of Duty:Â  The\r\n  Nortons assert Turner breached his duty of care by not properly setting up the\r\n  mobile home and completing the trim work, and the home was damaged as a\r\n  result.Â  The record is devoid of any evidence of the scope of Turner's\r\n  responsibilities in the delivery and set up of the home.Â  Although Mr. Norton\r\n  stated three men worked for Turner, the trial court may not have believed this\r\n  testimony.Â  &quot;The fact that testimony is not contradicted directly does not\r\n  render it undisputed.&quot;Â  Okatie River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern Site Prep,\r\n    L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 338, 577 S.E.2d 468, 474 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The\r\n  Nortons provided no clarification if the other men working with Turner were\r\n  Turner's employees or NHC's employees.Â  In addition, Mr. Norton stated one of\r\n  the other men was supposed to work on the trimming.Â  &quot;An employee may not\r\n  generally be held liable to a third party for a fellow employee's acts unless he\r\n  or she was directly involved in some way that would support the imposition of\r\n  liability.&quot;Â  27 Am. Jur. 2d Employment Relationship Â§ 410 (2004).Â  \r\nThere is no evidence Turner\r\n  prepared the home for transport and chose to move the home without plastic over\r\n  the open side.Â  In addition, we find no error in the trial court's ruling that\r\n  there was no evidence in the record to support the Nortons' claims that\r\n  Turner's acts proximately damaged the home.Â  As fact finder, the trial court\r\n  was free to disregard Mr. Norton's opinion that the move caused the damage.Â  See Okatie River, L.L.C., 353 S.C. at 338, 577 S.E.2d at 474 (&quot;The\r\n  court is not required to accept undisputed evidence as establishing the truth\r\n  where there is reason for disbelief.&quot;).Â  Furthermore, &quot;expert\r\n  evidence is required where a factual issue must be resolved with scientific,\r\n  technical, or any other specialized knowledge. . . .Â  [A] lay witness may only\r\n  testify as to matters within his personal knowledge and may not offer opinion\r\n  testimony which requires special knowledge, skill, experience, or training.&quot;\r\n  Â Watson v.

Geoffrey Levy, both of\r\n          Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jerry\r\n  Pryor appeals the trial court's order granting summary judgment to William\r\n  Portnoy and Charleston Aluminum, LLC., (collectively Respondents) in which the\r\n  court held Pryor's claims were barred by the statute of limitations.Â  \r\n1) As to Pryor's\r\n  argument Respondents' failure to establish the date of execution for the Charleston\r\n  Aluminum Trading Company Operating Agreement creates a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact, we find this issue was neither raised to nor ruled on by the\r\n  trial court.Â  Accordingly, it is not preserved.Â  See Wilder Corp. v.\r\n    Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;It is axiomatic\r\n  that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review.&quot;); Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124\r\n  (1991) (holding that where a trial court does not explicitly rule on an\r\n  argument raised, and appellant makes no Rule 59(e) motion to obtain a ruling,\r\n  the appellate court may not address the issue).\r\n2) As to Pryor's argument\r\n  the trial court failed to properly apply the scintilla of evidence rule and\r\n  view the evidence and draw all inferences therefrom in the light most favorable\r\nto Pryor, we find no error in the trial court's ruling.Â  \r\nThe record contains notes\r\n  from Pryor's attorney and email correspondence between Pryor and his attorney\r\n  indicating that in late March and early April of 2004, Pryor and the attorney\r\n  discussed how he had been replaced at Charleston Aluminum and the business had\r\n  undergone a reinvention &quot;probably to exclude him.&quot;Â  In his\r\n  deposition, Pryor admitted the discussions were based upon his belief he had\r\n  been wrongfully deprived of his ownership interest in Charleston Aluminum.Â  \r\nPryor claimed in an affidavit\r\n  he first became aware of the Operating Agreement for Charleston Aluminum, which\r\n  excluded his ownership interest, in June, 2006.Â  He stated, &quot;At no point\r\n  prior to June 2006, did I engage in any discussions with my attorneys or anyone\r\n  else about a possible cause of action against William Portnoy or Charleston\r\n  Aluminum for recovery of my ownership interest in Charleston Aluminum.&quot;Â  &quot;[A]\r\n  court may disregard a subsequent affidavit as a 'sham,' that is, as not\r\n  creating an issue of fact for purposes of summary judgment, by submitting the\r\n  subsequent affidavit to contradict that party's own prior sworn statement.&quot;\r\n  Â Cothran v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 218, 592 S.E.2d 629, 633 (2004).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the statute of limitations began to run when Pryor became aware he had been\r\n  wrongfully deprived of his ownership interest in Charleston Aluminum even if he\r\n  and his attorney did not discuss possible causes of action against Respondents\r\n  for recovery of his ownership interest in Charleston Aluminum at that time.Â  See Epstein v. Brown, 363 S.C. 372, 376, 610 S.E.2d 816, 818 (2005) (stating\r\n  the statute begins to run at the point of discovery of facts and not when\r\n  advice of counsel is sought or a full-blown theory of recovery is developed).Â  \r\nPryor also argues his April,\r\n  2004 discussions with his attorney did not trigger the running of the statute\r\n  of limitations given the lack of evidence establishing Pryor's claims actually\r\n  existed at that time.Â  This argument is the same as his first issue.Â  As stated\r\n  above, Pryor did not raise this argument to the trial court.Â  Accordingly, it\r\n  is not preserved.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-565","title":"Griggs v.

Glover, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Employee\r\n  Solutions, Inc. and AIG Claims Services (collectively Employer) appeal the\r\n  circuit court's order affirming the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina\r\n  Workers' Compensation Commission's (Appellate Panel) denial of Employer's\r\n  request for reimbursement from the South Carolina Second Injury Fund (Fund).Â \r\n  On appeal, Employer argues the Appellate Panel erred in finding (1) Welch's Reactive\r\n  Airways Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS) was a\r\n  work-related injury and (2) Welch's Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) did\r\n  not hinder his ability to seek employment. We affirm.[1]\r\nThe\r\n  purpose of the Second Injury Fund is to provide a financial incentive to\r\n  employers &quot;to hire handicapped persons, or to retain employees who become\r\n  partially disabled in the course and scope of their employment.&quot;Â Â  State\r\n  Workers' Comp. Fund v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 313 S.C. 536, 538, 443\r\n  S.E.2d 546, 547&nbsp;(1994).Â  &quot;It is designed to compensate employees\r\n  fully for subsequent injuries without penalizing employers for employing\r\n  them.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Section 42-9-400(a) of the South Carolina Code (2000)\r\n  permits the Fund to reimburse employer for workers' compensation claims when an\r\n  employee suffers from a permanent physical impairment and liability was\r\n  substantially increased due to a subsequent injury or aggravation of the permanent\r\n  physical impairment.Â  The employer must establish that when the claim is made\r\n  for reimbursement &quot;the employer had knowledge of the permanent physical\r\n  impairment at the time that the employee was hired, or at the time the employee\r\n  was retained in employment after the employer acquired such knowledge.&quot; Â§\r\n  42-9-400(c).Â  However, the employer may qualify for reimbursement upon proof\r\n  that the employer did not have knowledge of the permanent physical impairment\r\n  due to employee's concealment of the impairment or the impairment was unknown\r\n  to the employee.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  substantial evidence exists to support\r\n  the Appellate Panel's finding that RADS was a work-related injury and not a permanent\r\n  physical impairment.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5)(e) (Supp. 2010)\r\n  (providing this court must affirm a decision of the Appellate Panel if it is\r\n  supported by substantial evidence).Â  In fact, no evidence exists in the record\r\n  indicating Welch ever suffered from other pulmonary diseases.Â  His medical\r\n  records from 1982, 1983, 1987, 1993, and 1997 all indicated Welch's lungs were\r\n  functioning normally and without any chronic illnesses.Â  Additionally, Dr.&nbsp;Eric\r\n  Moore, Dr. Wayne C.

Kittrell, Chief Administrative\r\n  Law Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2011-UP-569\r\nHeard December 8, 2011 â€“ Filed December\r\n  20, 2011Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nGregory Samuel Forman, of Charleston, for Appellant/Respondent.\r\nStephen L. Brown, Wilbur E. Johnson, and Russell G. Hines, all of\r\n  Charleston, for Respondent/Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this cross-appeal, Appellant/Respondent Dr. Robin Bowers appeals from an order\r\n  of the Administrative Law Court (the ALC) affirming Bowers' termination as a\r\n  tenured professor at Respondent/Appellant College of Charleston (the College).Â \r\n  Bowers argues on appeal that the College denied him due process and there is no\r\n  evidence to support the College's decision to terminate his employment.Â  On\r\n  cross-appeal, the College argues the ALC erred by enforcing an automatic stay\r\n  which required the College to pay Bowers' wages during the pendency of his\r\n  appeal to the ALC.Â  We affirm.\r\n1.Â  As to Bowers' argument that the College's grievance procedures\r\n  denied him due process by placing an impermissible limitation on his counsel's\r\n  participation, we find the issue unpreserved because Bowers did not object to\r\n  the grievance procedures at either the prehearing conference or the hearing\r\n  itself.Â  See Lee Cnty. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Trs. v. MLD Charter Sch.\r\n    Acad. Planning Comm., 371 S.C. 561, 566, 641 S.E.2d 24, 27 (2007)\r\n  (&quot;[An appellate court] has a limited scope of review and cannot consider\r\n  issues that were not raised to and ruled on by the administrative\r\n  agency.&quot;).\r\n2.Â  As to Bowers' argument that the complaints, text messages, and\r\n  deposition were unreliable evidence and admitted upon an unlawful procedure, we\r\n  find the issue unpreserved.Â  In regard to the complaints and text messages, we\r\n  find the issue unpreserved because Bowers did not object to the admission of this\r\n  evidence.Â  See Burke v. AnMed Health, 393 S.C. 48, 54, 710 S.E.2d\r\n  84, 87 (Ct. App. 2011) (providing a contemporaneous objection to the admission\r\n  of evidence is typically required to preserve issues for appellate review).Â  As\r\n  to the deposition of Raven Ray, the hearing committee informed the parties at\r\n  the beginning of the hearing that Ray did not feel comfortable testifying\r\n  unless her attorney was present.Â  The committee stated it had no objection to\r\n  Ray's attorney observing the proceedings, but it would only allow Ray's\r\n  attorney to do so if both parties agreed.Â  Bowers objected, and therefore the\r\n  committee decided it would not allow Ray's attorney to be present.Â  Later in\r\n  the proceedings, Bowers objected to the admission of Ray's deposition into\r\n  evidence.Â  The committee decided to admit the deposition, finding Bowers had an\r\n  opportunity to question Ray by either agreeing to allow her attorney to observe\r\n  the proceedings or by submitting counter affidavits. Â Bowers' attorney\r\n  responded by saying she was unaware at the time she objected to Ray's attorney\r\n  being present that the alternative was the committee would allow Ray's\r\n  deposition in as evidence and Bowers would not have an opportunity to\r\n  cross-examine Ray.Â  The committee explained it lacked subpoena power and again offered\r\n  Bowers the opportunity to have Ray testify in the presence of her attorney.Â  After\r\n  Bowers and his attorney discussed the matter, Bowers' attorney told the\r\n  committee Bowers did not wish to delay the proceedings any further by having\r\n  Ray testify and they were ready to continue.Â  The committee then asked Bowers\r\n  if he would prefer to have Ray's deposition admitted into evidence rather than\r\n  have her testify in the presence of her attorney.Â  Bowers responded by\r\n  restating his objection to Ray's attorney being present and stated he just\r\n  wanted to move along with the proceedings because he did not believe he would\r\n  get much out of having Ray testify.Â  Bowers' attorney then said to Bowers,\r\n  &quot;Sure, it's your case.&quot;Â  We find Bowers waived his prior objection to\r\n  the admissibility of the deposition by deciding he wanted to move along the\r\n  proceedings when the committee yet again presented Bowers the option and\r\n  opportunity to have Ray testify.Â  See CFRE, LLC v. Greenville Cnty.\r\n    Assessor, __ S.C. __, 716 S.E.2d 877, 885 (2011) (holding CFRE waived on\r\n  appeal its claim that the trial court erred by not sanctioning property tax\r\n  assessor for its failure to formally respond to CFRE's interrogatories and\r\n  production requests, where the trial court offered to continue the proceedings\r\n  and order a formal response from the assessor, but CFRE declined the court's\r\n  invitation and agreed that a continuance would be unlikely to produce anything\r\n  further).\r\n3.Â  As to Bowers' argument that he was not required to preserve\r\n  issues related to his right to counsel or evidentiary procedures, we find the\r\n  exception to the general rule of error preservation noted in Ex parte\r\n    Jackson, 381 S.C. 253, 672 S.E.2d 585 (Ct. App. 2009), is not applicable in\r\n  this case because Bowers had counsel present and actively representing him at\r\n  all times during the prehearing conference and the hearing itself.Â  See id. at 261 n.3, 672 S.E.2d at 589 n.3 (holding a pro se litigant could not be\r\n  expected to raise the issue of whether he was entitled to counsel).\r\n4.Â  As to Bowers' argument that the College denied him due process\r\n  by not allowing him to confront Ray at the hearing, we find no error because Bowers'\r\n  inability to cross-examine Ray was a result of his own conduct.Â  Ray agreed to appear\r\n  and testify at the hearing so long as her attorney could be present.Â  Although\r\n  the hearing committee explained to Bowers that Ray's attorney would be present\r\n  in an observatory role only, Bowers did not agree to allow Ray's attorney to be\r\n  present during her testimony.Â  Thus, Bowers' inability to cross-examine Ray was\r\n  not a denial of due process.Â  See Zaman v. S.C. State Bd. of Med.\r\n    Exam'rs, 305 S.C. 281, 285, 408 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991) (holding a party\r\n  cannot complain of a violation of due process if the party has recourse to a\r\n  constitutionally sufficient administrative procedure, but merely fails to take\r\n  advantage of it); In re Vora, 354 S.C. 590, 600, 582 S.E.2d 413, 418\r\n  (2003) (&quot;Due process is not violated where a party is not given the\r\n  opportunity to confront witnesses so long as there has been a meaningful\r\n  opportunity to be heard.&quot;).\r\n5.Â  As to Bowers' argument that the record contains no evidence\r\n  that his communications or actions towards Ray met the College's definition of\r\n  &quot;sexual harassment,&quot; we find Ray's deposition, Bowers' text messages\r\n  to Ray, and the lyrics of the poem posted on the internet, all provided evidence\r\n  from which the College could reasonably find Bowers in violation of the College's\r\n  sexual harassment policy.Â  See Risher v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp;\r\n    Envtl. Control, 393 S.C. 198, 210, 712 S.E.2d 428, 434 (2011) (holding\r\n  &quot;substantial evidence&quot; sufficient to support a finding of the ALC is\r\n  evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds\r\n  to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached); Spruill v.\r\n    Richland Cnty. Sch. Dist. 2, 363 S.C. 61, 65, 609 S.E.2d 524, 526 (2005)\r\n  (providing the appellate court traditionally defers to an agency's construction\r\n  of its own regulation and the appellate court will not overturn such construction\r\n  absent compelling reasons); ESA Servs., LLC v.

App. 2011) (holding a reviewing court may\r\n  reverse or modify decisions that are controlled by error of law or are clearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the record as a whole).[1]\r\n6.Â  As to the College's argument that the ALC erred by enforcing\r\n  an automatic stay pursuant to ALC Rule 34, we find no error because enforcement\r\n  of the stay merely held Bowers in the same position that he was in prior to his\r\n  termination, on suspension with pay, pending the final decision of the ALC.Â  See ALC Rule 34 (&quot;The filing of an appeal from the final decision of an agency\r\n  shall stay the final decision of that agency . . . .&quot;); Santee Cooper\r\n    Resort, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv.

Emerson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  This appeal arises out of Respondent Charleston County School District Board of\r\n  Trustees' (the Board's) denial of Appellant Drayton Hall Charter Elementary\r\n  School's (Drayton Hall's) application to convert a neighborhood public school\r\n  into a charter school.Â  Drayton Hall\r\n  appealed the denial by the Board to the Administrative Law Court (ALC), which\r\n  affirmed.Â  On appeal, Drayton Hall argues the Board:Â  (1) violated its own\r\n  policies and procedures by holding a second vote after its initial vote to deny\r\n  the application failed; (2) violated section 59-40-70(C) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2010) by failing to show the grant of charter school status would\r\n  adversely affect other students in the district; and (3) violated section\r\n  59-40-70(C) by improperly finding the charter school application violated the\r\n  spirit and intent of state law.Â  We affirm.\r\n1.&nbsp; As to Drayton Hall's\r\n  contention that the Board violated its own policies and procedures by holding a\r\n  second vote at a subsequent public hearing after the first motion to deny\r\n  Drayton Hall's application resulted in a tie vote, we find the Board complied\r\n  with the statutory mandate to rule upon the application within thirty days.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-70(B) (Supp. 2010) (&quot;The school board of trustees\r\n  from which the applicant is seeking sponsorship shall rule on the application\r\n  for a charter school in a public hearing, upon reasonable public notice, within\r\n  thirty days after receiving the application.&quot;).Â  Furthermore, we find the\r\n  result of a tie vote on a Board member's motion to deny the application\r\n  resulted in no action on the application and did not constitute an approval of\r\n  the application.[1]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-40-70(B) (&quot;Once the application has been approved by the school board\r\n  of trustees, the charter school may open at the beginning of the following\r\n  year.&quot;); see also Robert's Rules of Order Â§44, 392 (&quot;On a tie vote, a motion requiring a\r\n  majority vote for adoption is lost, since a tie is not a majority.&quot;).Â  Because\r\n  the result of the tie vote was that no action was taken by the Board, we find\r\n  the motion to deny the application made at the subsequent Board meeting did not\r\n  constitute a motion to reconsider.Â  See Board Policy #9365 (&quot;An item or issue decided by the\r\n    Board shall not be placed on the agenda for reconsideration for six months\r\n  except by a member of the prevailing side or by a member not present when the\r\n  issue was decided.&quot;) (emphasis added); Robert's Rules of Order Â§10, 106-07\r\n  (&quot;If a main motion that interferes with a desired action has\r\n    been adopted, . . . the vote on [a motion to reconsider] can be made for a\r\n  limited time during the same session . . . .&quot;) (emphasis added).\r\n2.&nbsp; As to Drayton Hall's\r\n  remaining arguments on appeal, we find no error of law and substantial evidence\r\n  in the record on appeal to support the findings of the ALC.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B)(d)-(e) (Supp. 2010) (providing the standard of\r\n  appellate review of an appeal from a final decision of an administrative agency\r\n  is whether the findings of the ALC are supported by substantial evidence or\r\n  affected by other error of law); Sanders\r\n    v.

Thomas Mikell, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This appeal arises out of a jury verdict\r\n  awarding Respondent Christopher T. Godley $10,000 in actual damages and $40,000\r\n  in punitive damages against Appellant Helene Dowling.Â  On appeal, Dowling\r\n  argues the trial court erred in:Â  (1) directing a verdict for Godley regarding\r\n  his cause of action for trespass; (2) allowing arborist testimony of the\r\n  commercial value of the trees where the trees were noncommercial; (3) failing\r\n  to direct a verdict for Dowling on the issue of actual damages; and (4) failing\r\n  to direct a verdict for Dowling on the issue of punitive damages.Â  We affirm.\r\n1.&nbsp; As to Dowling's argument that the\r\n  trial court erred in granting a directed verdict on Godley's cause of action\r\n  for trespass, we find this argument unpreserved for appellate review.Â  See Johnson v. S.C. Dep't of Probation, Parole, &amp; Pardon Servs., 372\r\n  S.C. 279, 283, 641 S.E.2d 895, 897 (2007) (&quot;Because court rules require\r\n  the appealing party to prepare the record on appeal, see Rule 210(a),\r\n  SCACR, South Carolina courts have traditionally held the appealing party\r\n  accountable for failing to present the court with an adequate record on appeal\r\n  for review.&quot;); Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d\r\n  731, 733 (1998) (&quot;[A]n issue cannot be raised for the first time on\r\n  appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review.&quot;).\r\n2.&nbsp; As to Dowling's argument that the\r\n  trial court erred in allowing testimony from an arborist, we find this argument\r\n  abandoned on appeal.Â  See Ahrens v. State, 392 S.C. 340, 357, 709 S.E.2d 54, 63 (2011) (stating\r\n  that issues raised on appeal but not argued in the brief are deemed abandoned\r\n  and will not be considered by the appellate court).Â  Additionally, because\r\n  Dowling did not object to the arborist's testimony, we find this issue\r\n  unpreserved for appellate review.Â  See Burke v. AnMed Health, 393\r\n  S.C. 48, 54, 710 S.E.2d 84, 87 (Ct. App. 2011) (&quot;A contemporaneous\r\n  objection is typically required to preserve issues for appellate\r\n  review.&quot;); S.C.

Richland Cnty., 394 S.C. 154, 714 S.E.2d 869, 879 (2011)\r\n  (&quot;To warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the\r\n  appealing party must show both the error of the ruling and prejudice.&quot;).Â  \r\n3.&nbsp; As to Dowling's\r\n  remaining arguments regarding damages, we note Dowling made post trial motions\r\n  arguing there was no basis for the actual damages awarded by the jury and that\r\n  Dowling did not have the ability to pay the excessive punitive damages award.Â \r\n  We decline to address the merits of the appeal regarding damages because\r\n  Dowling's appellate brief fails to reveal a challenge to the denial of Dowling's\r\n  post trial motions.[1]Â  See Jones v.

Vance Stricklin, Jr., of West Columbia;\r\n  and Katherine Carruth Goode, of Winnsboro, for Appellant.\r\nDeborah Harrison Sheffield, of Columbia; and\r\n  David R. Gravely, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent Glenn Emmett Williams.\r\nM. Brian Magargle, of Columbia, for Respondent\r\n  Landmark Builders of the Triad, Inc.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This\r\n  family court action concerns whether the family court erred in refusing Lisa\r\n  Williams' (Mother's) request that it issue a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO).Â  We reverse and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n Glenn\r\n  Emmett Williams (Father) and Mother were divorced in May 2008.Â  The marriage\r\n  resulted in one child (Child).Â  By agreement of the parties, approved by the\r\n  family court, Mother was granted primary custody, Father was given secondary\r\n  custody, physical placement of Child was to be with Mother, and visitation was\r\n  established.Â  Father was required to pay child support and to continue to\r\n  maintain health and dental insurance coverage for Child.\r\n In\r\n  September 2008, Father filed an amended complaint seeking custody of Child and\r\n  attorney's fees among other relief.[2]Â \r\n  Mother filed an answer and counterclaim seeking sole custody, modification of\r\n  the summer visitation schedule, half of the private school tuition, and\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  Additionally, Mother sought an order holding Father in\r\n  contempt for not paying or reimbursing medical expenses and requiring Father to\r\n  forward the &quot;Explanation of Benefits&quot; from the health insurer\r\n  for claims for Child.[3]Â  She requested the family\r\n  court issue a QMCSO to require Father's employer and health insurer to provide\r\n  her with direct access to Child's insurance benefits and information.\r\n In\r\n  February 2009, Mother filed an amended answer, which included a third-party\r\n  counterclaim against Father's employer, Landmark Builders of the Triad, Inc.,\r\n  seeking an order interpreting the prior orders as QMCSOs, issuing a QMCSO, finding\r\n  Father and the Employer in contempt, and awarding attorney's fees.Â  Landmark\r\n  filed an answer to the third-party complaint, denying that any prior order it\r\n  had received was a QMCSO.Â  \r\nAt the outset of trial, the family court continued the\r\n  third-party action and heard the issues solely between Mother and Father.Â  Father's\r\n  counsel stated Father had no problem with the family court entering a QMCSO.Â \r\n  Father also testified that he agreed with issuing a QMCSO.Â  However, he\r\n  believed the order only needed to provide for Child to continue receiving\r\n  insurance coverage if Father was terminated from his employment.Â  He believed\r\n  Mother wanted any order issued to give her control over Father's insurance\r\n  options.Â  Father testified he had no objection to the QMCSO draft that said\r\n  that Child &quot;has a right to health care.&quot;Â  Following trial, the family\r\n  court denied Mother's request for a QMCSO, finding Father had &quot;fulfilled\r\n  his responsibilities under all previous orders.&quot; Additionally, the family\r\n  court denied Mother's request for attorney's fees and ordered her to pay $3,500\r\n  of Father's attorney's fees.[4]Â \r\n  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate court reviews decisions of\r\n  the family court de novo.Â  Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 390, 709 S.E.2d\r\n  650, 654-55 (2011).Â  The appellate court generally defers to the factual\r\n  findings of the family court regarding credibility because the family court is\r\n  in a better position to observe the witness and his or her demeanor.Â  Id. at 390-92, 709 S.E.2d at 654-55.Â  The party contesting the family court's\r\n  decision bears the burden of demonstrating the family court's factual findings\r\n  are not supported by the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id. at 392, 709\r\n  S.E.2d at 655.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; QMCSO\r\nMother argues the family court erred in failing to\r\n  issue a QMCSO. Â She maintains the family court erred in requiring her to show\r\n  Father had not complied with the existing order for it to issue a QMCSO for\r\n  Child.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\n&quot;A stipulation is an agreement,\r\n  admission, or concession made in judicial proceedings by\r\n  the parties or their attorneys and is binding upon those who make them.Â  The\r\n  court must accept stipulations as binding upon the parties.&quot;Â  McCrea v.\r\n    City of Georgetown, 384 S.C. 328, 332, 681 S.E.2d 918, 921&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2009) (citation omitted).Â  \r\nBecause Father and his counsel conceded to\r\n  the family court issuing a QMCSO, the family court erred in failing to do so.Â \r\n  Our search of jurisprudence revealed nothing to support the family court's\r\n  reliance on Father's fulfilling his obligation under the current order as a\r\n  basis for denying Mother's request.Â  Accordingly, we reverse\r\n  and remand for the family court to issue an order that satisfies the\r\n  requirements for a QMCSO.Â  See 29 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1169(a)(2)(A) (2009)\r\n  (defining a QMCSO).\r\nII.&nbsp; Attorney's Fees\r\nMother maintains the family court erred in awarding\r\n  Father attorney's fees and in failing to award her attorney's fees because the\r\n  family court failed to consider the required factors in determining whether to\r\n  award attorney's fees, only considering the beneficial results obtained by\r\n  Father.Â  We agree.\r\nThe family court has discretion in\r\n  deciding whether to award attorney's fees. Â Donahue v. Donahue,\r\n  299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989); see also Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 394, 709 S.E.2d 650, 656\r\n  (2011) (&quot;[T]he decision\r\n  to award attorney fees [] rests within the sound discretion of the family\r\n  court.&quot;).Â  In deciding whether to award attorney's fees, the family court\r\n  should consider (1) each party's ability to pay his or her own fee; (2) the\r\n  beneficial results obtained by the attorney; (3) the parties' respective\r\n  financial conditions; and (4) the effect of the fee on each party's standard of\r\n  living.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â \r\n  In determining reasonable attorney's fees, the six factors the family court\r\n  should consider are &quot;(1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case;\r\n  (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of\r\n  counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained;\r\n  [and] (6) customary legal fees for similar services.&quot;Â  Glasscock v.\r\n    Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).Â  \r\nAlthough it noted all of the appropriate factors to\r\n  consider when determining what amount of fees are reasonable, the family court\r\n  only considered the beneficial results factor when making its decision of whether to award attorney's fees.Â  Additionally, by determining the family court should\r\n  have entered a QMCSO, the beneficial results have changed.Â  Accordingly, in\r\n  light of the above, we reverse the family court's award of attorney's fees and remand\r\n  the issue to the family court to consider all of the appropriate factors when\r\n  determining whether to award either party attorney's fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Father agreed to the issuing of a QMCSO, the\r\n  family court erred in failing to issue one.Â  Additionally, the family court\r\n  failed to consider all of the appropriate factors when making its decision of\r\n  whether to award attorney's fees.Â  Further, based on our determination that the\r\n  family court erred in failing to issue a QMCSO, the beneficial results have\r\n  changed.Â  Accordingly, the family court's decision is\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and THOMAS and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Father filed his original complaint in July 2008 as\r\n  an attempt to prevent Mother from removing Child from public school and placing\r\n  him in a private school, which included homeschooling three days a week.Â \r\n  Father also filed a motion for temporary relief to preserve the status quo as\r\n  to Child's school placement.Â  While the family court was reviewing\r\n  jurisdictional issues relating to Father's request, the court ordered Child\r\n  attend the same school as he did the previous year.Â  During litigation, the\r\n  private school Mother wanted Child to attend became an unviable option and\r\n  Mother sought to move Child to a different private school.Â  Father did not\r\n  object to the new private school and dropped all of his claims except for\r\n  attorney's fees for Mother's counterclaims.\r\n[3] Mother had sought an Explanation of Benefits from the\r\n  health insurer, which had told her &quot;the Plan Administrator (usually the\r\n  employer) is responsible for validating a QM[CS]O. . . . It is the Plan\r\n  Administrator's role to determine whether the QM[CS]O is valid and meets\r\n  applicable state and federal requirements.&quot;Â  The following month, Mother's\r\n  attorney sent, via certified mail, Father's employer, Landmark Builders of the\r\n  Triad, Inc., a letter requesting it treat the divorce decree and order\r\n  approving the custody agreement as QMCSOs.\r\n[4] Father's affidavit for reimbursement for attorney's\r\n  fees and costs incurred prior to trial amounted to $19,325.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-579","title":"State v.

Wilson, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Zakei H. appeals the family court's\r\n  order imposing restitution in the amount of $587.00 as a condition of his\r\n  probation resulting from his delinquency adjudication arising from his\r\n  admission of possession of stolen property.Â  Zakei H. was arrested and\r\n  ultimately adjudicated delinquent after being found in possession of a damaged\r\n  moped that had been stolen the previous day.Â  Zakei H. argues the family court\r\n  erred in (1) imposing restitution as a condition of his probation, (2)\r\n  admitting a repair estimate submitted by the victim for his damaged moped, and\r\n  (3) ordering restitution in the amount of $587.00.Â  We affirm[1] pursuant to\r\n  Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; As to whether the family court\r\n  erred in imposing restitution as a condition of Zakei H.'s probation based upon\r\n  his conviction of possession of stolen property:Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7805(A)(3) (current version at S.C. Code Ann.

Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor William B.\r\n          Rogers, Jr., of Bennettsville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â James\r\n  Arthur Norton was convicted of criminal domestic violence of a high and\r\n  aggravated nature (CDVHAN) and assault and battery of a high and aggravated\r\n  nature (ABHAN).Â  He received concurrent ten-year sentences, suspended upon the\r\n  service of five years' imprisonment and five years' probation. Â Norton appeals, arguing the trial court erred in\r\n  permitting Captain Thomas to testify to medical observations and conclusions\r\n  beyond the scope of his expertise.Â  We affirm.\r\n1. Error in\r\n  Admitting Testimony\r\nWe find the trial court erred\r\n  in admitting Captain Thomas's testimony that TPI[1] appeared in the photographs without first requiring\r\n  him to be qualified as an expert witness or to establish his firsthand\r\n  knowledge of the facts upon which his opinion was based.Â  Lay witnesses are\r\n  permitted to offer testimony in the form of opinions or inferences if the\r\n  opinions or inferences are rationally based on the witness's perception, will\r\n  aid the jury in understanding testimony, and do not require special knowledge.Â \r\n  Rule 701, SCRE.Â  Our supreme court has confirmed that &quot;a lay witness may\r\n  only testify as to matters within his personal knowledge and may not offer opinion\r\n    testimony which requires special knowledge, skill, experience, or\r\n  training.&quot;Â  Watson v. Ford Motor Co., 389 S.C. 434, 446, 699 S.E.2d\r\n  169, 175 (2010) (emphasis added).Â  Testimony from an expert witness instead of\r\n  a lay witness &quot;is required where a factual issue must be resolved with\r\n  scientific, technical, or any other specialized knowledge. Â Expert testimony\r\n  differs from lay testimony in that an expert witness is permitted to state an\r\n  opinion based on facts not within his firsthand knowledge.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n  445-46, 699 S.E.2d at 175.Â  Here, Captain Thomas's testimony indicates he\r\n  applied specialized knowledge he gained from his training and experience to\r\n  photographs of Victim.Â  The content and dates of the photographic exhibits\r\n  indicate the pictures were taken on either four or five different occasions\r\n  during the week following the incident.Â  Aside from testimony that Captain\r\n  Thomas interviewed Victim the day after the incident and accompanied her to her\r\n  home to view the initial crime scene, no evidence suggested Captain Thomas\r\n  viewed Victim's injuries during that week.Â  When he viewed the photographs at\r\n  trial, Captain Thomas concluded his testimony on direct examination by stating,\r\n  &quot;And in these photographs there is evidence of [TPI].&quot;Â  We find the\r\n  development and appearance of TPI, as described by Captain Thomas, required\r\n  special medical knowledge.Â  To render this opinion, Captain Thomas applied special\r\n  knowledge of TPI to photographs of Victim in varying conditions that he did not\r\n  personally observe.Â  This testimony from a lay witness is inadmissible under\r\n  Rule 701. Â Accordingly, the trial court erred in admitting it.Â  \r\n2. Harmless Error\r\nNonetheless, any error in\r\n  admitting this testimony was harmless.Â  &quot;[O]ur appellate courts have\r\n  consistently held that a trial court should only be reversed when an error is\r\n  prejudicial and not harmless.&quot;Â  State v. White, 371 S.C. 439, 447,\r\n  639 S.E.2d 160, 164 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  &quot;The determination of prejudice must\r\n  be based on the entire record[,] and the result will generally turn on the\r\n  facts of each case.&quot;Â  State v. Sweat, 362 S.C. 117, 128-29, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 508, 514 (Ct. App. 2004) (internal citation and quotation marks\r\n  omitted).Â  An error is harmless if it could not have reasonably affected the\r\n  result of the trial.Â  State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 93-94, 180 S.E.2d 888,\r\n  889-90 (1971).Â  However, the admission of a lay witness's opinion testimony\r\n  concerning the ultimate issue in a case is not harmless.Â  State v. Ellis,\r\n  345 S.C. 175, 178, 547 S.E.2d 490, 491 (2001).Â  Here, the jury convicted Norton\r\n  of CDVHAN and ABHAN.Â  To secure these convictions, the State had to prove\r\n  Norton assaulted and seriously injured Victim.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-25-65 (Supp. 2010) (indicating CDVHAN consists of either &quot;(1) an\r\n  assault and battery which involves the use of a deadly weapon or results in\r\n  serious bodily injury to the victim; or (2) an assault, with or without an\r\n  accompanying battery, which would reasonably cause a person to fear imminent\r\n  serious bodily injury or death&quot;); State v. Geiger, 370 S.C. 600, 605-06,\r\n  635 S.E.2d 669, 672 (Ct. App. 2006) (stating ABHAN is &quot;an unlawful act of\r\n  violent injury accompanied by circumstances of aggravation&quot; such as the infliction\r\n  of serious bodily injury or a difference in gender).Â  We find that, even had\r\n  the trial court excluded Captain Thomas's TPI testimony, the State presented overwhelming\r\n  evidence of Norton's guilt of both offenses.Â  As to strangulation specifically,\r\n  Victim identified the pictures, which contained graphic images of Victim's\r\n  bruises blooming and beginning to fade during the week following the attack, as\r\n  showing her injuries from strangulation.Â  Victim testified Norton punched or choked\r\n  her into unconsciousness at least twice.Â  The cashier recalled hearing\r\n  &quot;hitting&quot; noises from inside the bathroom after Norton followed\r\n  Victim into that room.Â  She and a police officer described Victim as hysterical\r\n  and crying when they discovered her cowering on the bathroom floor.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  we find Captain Thomas did not express an opinion concerning the ultimate issue\r\n  in this case.Â  Captain Thomas opined only that the bruising evident in the\r\n  photographs was TPI.Â  Although he related facts supporting the State's theory\r\n  that Victim was strangled, he never expressed an opinion as to whether Norton\r\n  assaulted and seriously injured Victim, either by strangling or by other\r\n  means.Â  Accordingly, Norton suffered no prejudice from Captain Thomas's\r\n  testimony, and any error in admitting it was harmless.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  THOMAS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The term &quot;TPI&quot; appears to be a typographical\r\n  error or misunderstanding of the term &quot;petechiae.&quot;Â  For continuity,\r\n  we use the term in the record.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-587","title":"Trinity Investments, LLC v.

Walter\r\n          Wilkins, III, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Lorenzo\r\n  R. Nicholson appeals his convictions for trafficking cocaine and possession of\r\n  a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  He argues the trial court\r\n  erred in denying his motion to suppress the cocaine and the weapon because the\r\n  police found them at his house as a result of a search warrant for which the\r\n  probable cause was obtained during an unconstitutional protective sweep.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n&quot;In criminal cases, the\r\n  appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  We are bound by the trial\r\n  court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500 (Ct. App. 2003) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  On appeals from a motion to suppress based on Fourth Amendment\r\n  grounds, the court applies a deferential standard of review and will reverse if\r\n  there is clear error. Â State v. Tindall, 388 S.C. 518, 522, 698 S.E.2d\r\n  203, 206 (2010).Â  However, this deference does not bar this court from\r\n  conducting its own review of the record to determine whether the trial judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision is supported by the evidence. Â Id.Â  The arresting officers are\r\n  permitted in the circumstances of an in-home arrest &quot;to take reasonable\r\n  steps to ensure their safety after, and while making, the\r\n  arrest.&quot;Â  Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 333-34 (1990) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    Fourth Amendment permits a properly limited protective sweep in conjunction\r\n    with an in-home arrest when the searching officer possesses a reasonable belief\r\n    based on specific and articulable facts[,] [together with the rational\r\n    inferences from those facts,] Â that the area to be swept harbors an individual\r\n    posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 337.Â  \r\nThe record supports the trial\r\n  court's finding that the protective sweep was reasonable.Â  Arresting officers attested they tried to arrest Nicholson for armed\r\n  robbery, pursuant to a warrant, at the front door of his house.Â  The officers\r\n  stated they entered Nicholson's house\r\n  while trying to handcuff him because he was uncooperative and backed into his\r\n  house.Â  The officers asserted Nicholson remained uncooperative after being\r\n  handcuffed and, in addition, asked to read the arrest warrant, delaying the\r\n  departure from the house.Â  Moreover, their statements indicated that his sister's\r\n  arrival at the front door contributed to Nicholson's unsettling behavior. Â The officers testified they were concerned dangerous\r\n  persons were in the house, like a passenger from a car waiting in Nicholson's\r\n  driveway with its engine running and the operator in the driver's seat, one of\r\n  Nicholson's codefendants in the armed robbery who was out on bond, or others\r\n  staying at the house.Â  They also considered a protective sweep was necessary\r\n  for their safety considering the crime for which Nicholson was being arrested\r\n  and his disappearance from view before opening the door.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  officers' description of the protective sweep giving them probable cause for a\r\n  search warrant indicated it was limited. Â Therefore, the protective sweep did\r\n  not violate Nicholson's Fourth Amendment rights, and the trial court properly\r\n  denied Nicholson's motion to suppress the cocaine and the weapon.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, PIEPER,\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2011-UP-589","title":"State v.

Sutton, 340 S.C. 393,\r\n  397-98, 532 S.E.2d 283, 285 (2000).Â  Here, the State presented evidence Liberto\r\n  threatened and charged towards the victim causing him to retrieve a weapon in\r\n  self-defense; therefore, the circuit court did not err in denying Liberto's\r\n  directed verdict motion.Â  Additionally, despite Liberto's inability to carry\r\n  out one of the threats against the victim because of the absence of the\r\n  victim's family, the State presented evidence that Liberto assaulted the victim\r\n  prior to ever making a threat concerning the victim's family.Â  Thus, the State\r\n  presented sufficient evidence to support affirming the magistrate court's\r\n  denial of Liberto's directed verdict.Â  \r\n2. Â As to Liberto's issue concerning the circuit court improperly\r\n  considering the jury's finding of guilt, Liberto failed to raise this issue to\r\n  the circuit court; therefore, it is not preserved for our review.Â  See City\r\n    of Columbia v.
