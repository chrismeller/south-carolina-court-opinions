Burch, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.\r\n2005-UP-427\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2005 â€“ Filed July 5, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Patricia Frierson, of\r\n        Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Andrew C. English, III and\r\n        Jason M. Bobertz, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; In this\r\nlandlord/tenant dispute, tenant Patricia Frierson appeals an order of the\r\ncircuit court affirming the magistrate courtâ€™s judgment in favor of the\r\nlandlord, Stone Ridge Apartments.&nbsp; We affirm.1\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nFrierson brought this action against\r\nStone Ridge Apartments (landlord) in magistrateâ€™s court alleging causes of\r\naction for wrongful eviction and intentional infliction of emotional distress.2&nbsp; In her complaint, Frierson\r\nmaintained landlord refused to make repairs that affected her health and safety,\r\nthat because of this non-compliance she withheld her rent, that she was\r\nsubsequently wrongfully evicted from her apartment, and that landlord reported\r\nher failure to pay rent to a credit bureau thereby making it impossible for\r\nFrierson to rent another apartment for almost a year. &nbsp;Landlord answered,\r\nasserting a general denial, and counterclaimed for rental payments due pursuant\r\nto a previous order of the court ejecting Frierson from the premises.&nbsp;\r\nFollowing a trial in magistrateâ€™s\r\ncourt on November 12, 2002, the magistrate ruled in favor of landlord,\r\ndismissing Friersonâ€™s complaint and ordering Frierson to pay $1,517 for past\r\ndue rent.&nbsp; In his order, the magistrate found Frierson failed to meet her\r\nburden of proof that landlord jeopardized her health and safety in any\r\nway.&nbsp; He further determined Frierson failed to give landlord proper notice\r\nof her concerns and therefore waived any right to withhold rent on that\r\nbasis.&nbsp; Frierson moved for a new trial based on newly discovered\r\nevidence.&nbsp; The magistrate denied the motion, finding the alleged newly\r\ndiscovered evidence presented at the motion hearing could have been made\r\navailable before the trial and was therefore not new evidence, but simply\r\nadditional evidence gathered after the trial.&nbsp;\r\nFrierson appealed to the circuit\r\ncourt.&nbsp; Following a hearing on the matter, the circuit court affirmed the\r\nmagistrate court.&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Frierson contends the\r\ntrial judge erred in (1) determining she failed to give landlord notice; (2)\r\nrefusing to admit the proffered testimony of a witness; and (3) refusing to\r\nconsider her causes of action for willful non-compliance and intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress.&nbsp; Landlord asserts these issues are not\r\nproperly preserved for our review as Frierson failed to raise them by exception\r\nin her notice of appeal to the circuit court.&nbsp; We agree with landlord.\r\nIn her notice of appeal, Frierson\r\nset forth her exceptions as follows:\r\n\r\n  During the bench trial on November\r\n  12, 2003, it quickly became apparent that [the magistrate] was biased against\r\n  the Plaintiff, Pro Se and my case had already been decided.&nbsp; That nothing\r\n  I said and no evidence I presented would make a difference.&nbsp; The Judgeâ€™s\r\n  bias against me was clearly evident in his condescending demeanor and the\r\n  manner in which he addressed meâ€“no eye contact, head hung down, disinterest\r\n  in my testimony, not reading any of my documents and refusing to call a\r\n  witness on my behalf.&nbsp; Photographs supporting my pleadings were totally\r\n  ignored and, I had to ask for the Judgeâ€™s attention several times during the\r\n  trial.&nbsp; And, to further exasperate the situation, there is no record of\r\n  the trial.&nbsp; In open court, [the magistrate] inserted a cassette into the\r\n  recorder then later, turned it over.&nbsp; A motion for a new trial was filed\r\n  within the 5 days allowed.&nbsp; No record of the bench trial was available.\r\n  [The magistrate] should have\r\n  recused himself because of bias.\r\n  [The magistrateâ€™s] intemperate\r\n  conduct and bias against the Appellant made it impossible to get a full and\r\n  fair trial.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing before the circuit\r\ncourt, the attorney for landlord noted Friersonâ€™s sole exception raised to the\r\ncourt was that of bias.&nbsp; Frierson stated as follows:\r\n\r\n  In my notice of appeal, as\r\n  [landlordâ€™s attorney] so correctly stated, that the allegations of bias, I\r\n  would like to withdraw all allegations of bias and proceed based on the return\r\n  that the judge submitted. . . . I was upset.&nbsp; I was emotionally\r\n  upset.&nbsp; And I withdraw all allegations of bias . . . .\r\n\r\nAfter reading the return and\r\nFriersonâ€™s notice of appeal, the circuit court judge addressed Frierson\r\nsaying, â€œ[Y]ou have stated to the court that youâ€™re withdrawing any of the\r\nappeal grounds for bias and I donâ€™t believe that leaves anything on the actual\r\nwritten record here stating the grounds of appeal.â€&nbsp; Frierson disagreed,\r\nstating that the issues she intended to present were all in the notice of\r\nappeal, but they were â€œemotionally rattled off,â€ and she specifically\r\nbelieved the body of the appeal addressed the magistrateâ€™s refusal to call a\r\nwitness on her behalf.&nbsp;\r\nWe agree with landlord that the\r\nissues raised by Frierson on appeal are not properly preserved for our review as\r\nthey were not raised by exception to the circuit court.&nbsp; See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 18-7-20 (Supp. 2004) (in appeals from magistrate courts to circuit\r\ncourts, â€œ[t]he appellant, within thirty days after written notice of judgment\r\n. . . shall serve a notice of appeal, stating the grounds upon which the\r\nappeal is founded.â€) (emphasis added).&nbsp; The gravaman of Friersonâ€™s\r\nexceptions on appeal to the circuit court was that the magistrate was biased\r\nagainst her.&nbsp; While she did state in her exceptions that the magistrate â€œrefus[ed]\r\nto call a witness on her behalf,â€ she raised this as an example of the\r\nmagistrateâ€™s bias against her, and did not assert by way of exception that the\r\nmagistrate committed legal error in failing to call this witness.&nbsp; Further,\r\nin the hearing before the circuit court, Frierson failed to make any argument or\r\ncite any law supporting her position that the magistrate erred in not allowing\r\nthis witness to be called.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find the only issue raised by\r\nexception to the circuit court was withdrawn by Frierson, and the issues raised\r\nbefore this court on appeal are not properly preserved.&nbsp; See South\r\nCarolina Wildlife &amp; Marine Res. Depâ€™t v. Kunkle, 287 S.C. 177, 179\r\nn.2, 336 S.E.2d 468, 469 n.2 (1985) (noting a reviewing court may not rule on\r\nissues not raised in the lower court).&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAt any rate, we find judgment in\r\nfavor of landlord was proper.&nbsp; The current action had roots in the prior\r\neviction of Frierson.&nbsp; On July 24, 2001, landlord filed an eviction action\r\nagainst Frierson and the magistrate issued an order of ejectment which provided,\r\nâ€œSome exterior maintenance concern was work[ed]-out and Mrs. Frierson agreed .\r\n. . to pay rents . . . .â€&nbsp; The order noted Frierson was to pay her June\r\nrent by July 30, 2001 and her July and August rent by August 6, 2001, and gave\r\nthe landlord the right to proceed with ejectment if Frierson defaulted.&nbsp;\r\nFrierson never appealed this order nor raised the issue of non-compliance with\r\nthe ejectment order.&nbsp; Rather, she instituted this complaint one year later,\r\nasserting causes of action that were or may have been raised in the eviction\r\nproceeding.&nbsp; Because Frierson did not appeal the order of ejectment, her\r\ncurrent action is precluded by the doctrine of res judicata.3&nbsp; See Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of\r\nConway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999) (citations omitted) (â€œRes\r\njudicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the claims arise out\r\nof the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior action\r\nbetween those parties.&nbsp; Under the doctrine of res judicata, â€˜[a] litigant\r\nis barred from raising any issues which were adjudicated in the former suit and\r\nany issues which might have been raised in the former suit.â€™â€).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order\r\nbelow is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., and\r\nCURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n2 Frierson also alleges she is entitled to judgment based on\r\nrespondentâ€™s â€œwillful noncompliance.â€&nbsp; This is apparently in\r\nreference to respondentâ€™s alleged failure to make certain repairs that are\r\nrelated to her cause of action for wrongful eviction.\r\n3 This court may affirm based on any ground appearing in the\r\nrecord.&nbsp; See Rule 220(c), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm\r\nany ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on\r\nAppeal.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-428","title":"Harrison v.

Harrison, Sr. (Husband) appeals the grant of a divorce\r\nto Robertha Harrison (Wife) on the ground of habitual drunkenness, the failure\r\nof family court to award an in-kind distribution of certain marital assets, and\r\nthe family courtâ€™s determination that he was entitled to only 25 per cent of\r\nthe marital estate.&nbsp; Husband also alleges the family court failed to divide\r\nan asset that was found to have been transmuted into marital property.&nbsp; We\r\naffirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties married in 1971.&nbsp;\r\nAt the time of the final hearing, all three children born of the marriage were\r\nemancipated.&nbsp; During the first ten and a half years of the marriage, Wife\r\nworked as a teacherâ€™s aide and school bus driver.&nbsp; She later returned to\r\nschool, obtaining an undergraduate degree from Francis Marion College\r\nin 1988 and a masterâ€™s degree from the University of South Carolina in 1994.&nbsp;\r\nAt the time of the final hearing, she was teaching first grade and was forty\r\nhours from obtaining a doctorate degree in education.&nbsp; Husband worked as a\r\nmaintenance supervisor in the hotel industry for the past 32 years.&nbsp;\r\nHusband earned more income than did Wife until her graduation from\r\ncollege.&nbsp;\r\nOn August 29, 2002, Wife filed for\r\ndivorce on the grounds of physical cruelty and habitual drunkenness.&nbsp; She\r\nalso sought an equitable division of the marital property.&nbsp; Husband\r\nanswered and counterclaimed for separate support and maintenance and an\r\nequitable division of the marital property.\r\nThe family court granted Wife a\r\ndivorce on the ground of habitual drunkenness, finding Husbandâ€™s condition â€œled\r\nto the breakup of the marriageâ€ and â€œadversely affected the partiesâ€™\r\nfinancial condition.â€&nbsp; In addition, the family court found the following\r\nitems were marital property: â€œ[R]eal estate located at 1272 Newman Branch Road\r\n. . . valued at $8,400.00; real estate located at 1370 Newman Branch Road . . .\r\nvalued at $52,000.00; [Wifeâ€™s] retirement account valued at $45,000.00; Safe\r\nFederal Credit Union account balance&nbsp; . . . valued at $8,791.13â€ and\r\nvarious vehicles valued at a total of $24,850.00, bringing the total value of\r\nthe marital estate to $139,041.13.&nbsp; After considering Wifeâ€™s earnings\r\nover the course of the marriage of $459,692.00 or 62.5 per cent, Husbandâ€™s\r\nearnings of $275,899.00 or 37.5 per cent, and other statutory factors, including\r\nHusbandâ€™s marital misconduct, the family court awarded Wife 75 per cent of the\r\nmarital estate and Husband 25 per cent of the marital estate.&nbsp; With respect\r\nto the equitable division, the family court divided all the assets in-kind\r\nexcept for the marital home, which was to be sold with the proceeds divided in\r\nproportion to the allocation.&nbsp; In addition, Wife was to pay $13,170.00 from\r\nher portion of the proceeds to Husband to effectuate the final division.&nbsp;\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp; Husband first contends the\r\nfamily court erred in finding Wife was entitled to a divorce on the ground of\r\nhabitual drunkenness.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nWife testified that, about nine\r\nyears before the final hearing, Husband would leave the house on Fridays,\r\nSaturdays, and Sundays and come back â€œin a rage for some reason.â€&nbsp; She\r\nfurther testified that, just before the parties separated, Husband would do this\r\nfive to six days a week, coming home drunk between ten and eleven oâ€™clock at\r\nnight from his job and then questioning her about who had been at the\r\nhouse.&nbsp; Wife also stated Husband would not allow her to sleep whenever he\r\ncame in drunk.&nbsp; Specifically, she noted that (1) when Husband came in\r\ndrunk, he would â€œrant and rave, slam, knock things down until he gets tired\r\nand goes to sleepâ€; (2) if she attempted to go outside to avoid the situation,\r\nHusband would follow her; (3) if she sought refuge in her car, Husband would\r\nthreaten to burn the car up; and (4) when she stayed in the house, Husband would\r\nfollow her into every room and not allow her to sit in a chair or lie in a bed\r\nto sleep.&nbsp; Husbandâ€™s behavior when drunk negatively affected Wifeâ€™s job\r\nbecause she had to rise early to go to work.&nbsp; We hold this evidence is\r\nsufficient to support the grant of a divorce to Wife on the ground of habitual\r\ndrunkenness.[2]\r\n2.&nbsp; We reject Husbandâ€™s\r\nargument that the family court erred in failing to award an in-kind distribution\r\nof the marital property.&nbsp;\r\nThe only asset not divided in-kind\r\nwas the former marital residence at 1272 Newman Branch Road, which was to be\r\nsold and the proceeds divided between the parties according to percentage each\r\nwas to receive in the equitable division.&nbsp; This asset was valued at\r\n$52,000.00, which far exceeded the value of Husbandâ€™s award in the marital\r\nestate.&nbsp; The family court was aware of Husbandâ€™s preference to have the\r\nhome awarded to him in the distribution and asked Husbandâ€™s attorney:&nbsp;\r\nâ€œIf he had to pay her some money, some equity to get the marital home would he\r\nhave the means to do that?â€&nbsp; Because it appears the Husband had no cash\r\nassets of his own and because Wife received all the cash assets in the equitable\r\ndistribution, we hold the family courtâ€™s decision to order a sale of the\r\nmarital residence was proper in view of the courtâ€™s inquiry and the attendant\r\ncircumstances.[3]\r\n3.&nbsp; Husband next challenges the\r\nfamily courtâ€™s decision to award him only 25 per cent of the marital\r\nassets.&nbsp; We find no abuse of discretion.[4]\r\nHere, the family court set forth\r\nseveral reasons to support the percentage in the marital estate that it awarded\r\neach party, namely (1) Husbandâ€™s misconduct throughout the marriage, both with\r\nregard to his habitual drunkenness and infliction of physical abuse; (2) the\r\nfact that over the course of the marriage Wife earned 62.5 per cent of the\r\npartiesâ€™ total income; and (3) the recognition that two of the assets in the\r\nmarital estate, the property at 1272 Newman Branch Road and a Black Farmersâ€™\r\nSettlement, had originally been received by Wife.&nbsp; Husband argues the\r\nfamily court failed to consider the length of the marriage, the fact that Wife\r\nearns almost twice what he earns, the fact that he was the primary breadwinner\r\nduring the early part of the marriage, and the fact that Wife had retirement\r\nbenefits and he did not.&nbsp; The family court, however, stated it applied all\r\nthe statutory criteria for deciding how to apportion the marital estate; and,\r\nalthough reasonable minds may differ as to what weight should be given to the\r\nfactors cited by Husband, we, as an appellate court, cannot say the family court\r\nfailed to give these factors proper consideration.[5]&nbsp;\r\n4.&nbsp; Finally, Husband claims the\r\nfamily court neglected to divide the $50,000 Black Farmerâ€™s Settlement.&nbsp;\r\nWe disagree.\r\nThe record shows Wife deposited the\r\nfunds into the partiesâ€™ Safe Credit Union account on July 21, 2000.&nbsp; In\r\naddition, Wife testified that the parties had spent most of the money to pay off\r\ndebts, remodel their home, repair one of Husbandâ€™s vehicles, and help their\r\nchildren.&nbsp; In addition, she estimated that only about four or five thousand\r\ndollars was left of the settlement when she filed for divorce.&nbsp; Based on\r\nthese statements and the other evidence of record, it is reasonable to infer\r\nthat what remained of the settlement was in the Safe Credit Union account, which\r\nthe family court included as an asset in the marital estate and divided\r\naccordingly.&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving\r\nthe issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule\r\n215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; See Fisher v. Fisher, 276 S.C. 375, 377, 278\r\nS.E.2d 780, 781 (1981) (holding the wife established a prima facie\r\ncase of habitual drunkenness by proving the husband drank every weekend and\r\nfrequently during the week); Rooney v.

Westmoreland Clarkson, all of Columbia, for Respondent.&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Timothy\r\nFarmer appeals a finding that he is a sexually violent predator.&nbsp; We\r\naffirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nWhen Timothy Farmer was fifteen, he\r\npled guilty to three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a\r\nminor, one count of first- degree assault with intent to commit criminal sexual\r\nconduct with a minor, and one count of committing a lewd act on a minor.&nbsp;\r\nBy order of the court, Farmer was committed to the Department of Juvenile\r\nJustice for an indeterminate period of time not to exceed his twenty-first\r\nbirthday.\r\nWhile incarcerated, Farmer\r\nparticipated in therapy for sex offenders including a four-phase treatment\r\nprogram.&nbsp; However, for disputed reasons, Farmer was ejected from the final\r\nphase of that program.&nbsp; Before Farmerâ€™s release from custody, the State\r\nfiled a petition under the Sexually Violent Predator Act[2] to commit Farmer to the Department of Mental\r\nHealth until such time as the department deemed his release safe for the\r\npublic.&nbsp; The circuit court found probable cause to have Farmer held and\r\ntested by a psychiatrist.\r\nThe State proceeded against Farmer,\r\nand a jury found him to be a sexually violent predator pursuant to the\r\nAct.&nbsp; He was subsequently committed to the Department of Mental Health.\r\nFarmer now argues that the trial\r\njudge erred in denying his motion for directed verdict and in allowing certain\r\ntestimony from the Stateâ€™s psychiatric expert.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œOn an appeal from the trial courtâ€™s\r\ndenial of a motion for a directed verdict, the appellate court may only reverse\r\nthe trial court if there is no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.â€&nbsp;\r\nIn re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 646, 550 S.E.2d 311, 315 (2001).&nbsp; â€œIn\r\nruling on a motion for directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the\r\nexistence of evidence, not its weight.â€&nbsp; Id. at 647, 550 S.E.2d at 315.&nbsp;\r\nâ€œThe admission of evidence is\r\nwithin the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an\r\nabuse of discretion.â€&nbsp; State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564\r\nS.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).&nbsp; â€œAn abuse of discretion arises in cases\r\nwhere:&nbsp; (1) the judge issuing the order was controlled by some error of\r\nlaw; or (2) the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal,\r\nconclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€&nbsp; Elliott\r\nv. Richland County, 327 S.C. 175, 179, 489 S.E.2d 195, 197&nbsp;(1997).&nbsp;\r\nLAW AND DISCUSSION\r\nFarmer alleges the circuit court\r\nerred in failing to grant a directed verdict and by allowing inadmissible\r\nevidence.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nI.&nbsp; Directed Verdict\r\nFarmer alleges the circuit court\r\nerred in denying a motion for a directed verdict because the State failed to\r\nprove an essential element under the Act, specifically that he suffered from a\r\nmental abnormality.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nSection 44-48-30(1) of the Act\r\ndefines a sexually violent predator as â€œa person who (a) has been convicted of\r\na sexually violent offense, and (b) suffers from a mental abnormality or\r\npersonality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual\r\nviolence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and\r\ntreatment.â€&nbsp;\r\nFarmer does not contest that he was\r\nconvicted of a sexually violent offense, but argues the State did not\r\ndemonstrate he suffers from a mental abnormality or personality order.&nbsp; Dr.\r\nBarnard-Dupree, the Stateâ€™s expert witness in forensic psychiatry, testified\r\nthat in her opinion Farmer suffered from pedophilia.&nbsp; She testified that a\r\ndiagnosis of pedophilia is appropriate under DSM-IV[3] guidelines when an individual has (1) a period of\r\nat least 6 months recurrent, intense, sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges,\r\nor behavior involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children\r\n(generally 13 or younger), (2) the fantasies, urges, or behaviors cause\r\nclinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other\r\nimportant areas of functioning, and (3) the person is at least 16 years of age\r\nand at least 5 years older than the children involved.&nbsp;\r\nFarmer maintains he does not satisfy\r\nthis definition because he was less than 16 at the time of the offenses.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, Dr. Barnard-Dupree concluded Farmer â€œcontinues to suppress and deny\r\nhis impulses and feelings consistent with sexual deviancy; that makes him meet\r\nthe criteria for pedophilia at the current time.â€&nbsp; In her opinion Farmer\r\nsuffered from pedophilia â€œbased on his psychological testing showing he\r\ncontinues to have these feelings and urges even though he denies it.â€&nbsp;\r\nFarmer also argues the proof of pedophilia was inadequate because there was no\r\ntestimony the urges and fantasies lasted for six months.&nbsp; However, Dr.\r\nBarnard-Dupree unequivocally stated Farmer fit the diagnosis guidelines provided\r\nfor pedophilia.&nbsp;\r\nFinally, Farmer attacks the accuracy\r\nof Dr. Barnard-Dupreeâ€™s evaluation; however, any deficiency in the doctorâ€™s\r\ndetermination was subject to cross-examination and impacted her\r\ncredibility.&nbsp; The weight to be given her testimony was a matter for the\r\njury.&nbsp; State v. Tisdale, 338 S.C. 607, 618, 527 S.E.2d 389, 395 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2000).&nbsp;\r\nAfter examining the record, we find\r\nsufficient evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s decision to submit this issue\r\nto the jury.\r\nII.&nbsp;\r\nAdmission of Evidence\r\nFarmer also argues the circuit court\r\nerred when it refused to grant his motion for a new trial based on the\r\nintroduction of testimony about additional psychiatric testing.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.&nbsp;\r\nFarmer was granted funds to procure\r\nthe opinion of another psychiatrist.&nbsp; He was interviewed and tested by Dr.\r\nWilliam H. Burke.&nbsp; Neither Farmer nor the State called Dr. Burke to testify\r\nand, in fact, Farmer made a motion in limine that the report by Dr. Burke be\r\nexcluded.&nbsp; The court did not rule on this motion, as the State said it did\r\nnot intend to admit the report.&nbsp;\r\nDuring the cross-examination of Dr.\r\nBarnard-Dupree, Farmerâ€™s counsel challenged the doctorâ€™s credibility by\r\nasking if she had performed a variety of different tests in her evaluation of\r\nFarmer.&nbsp; Farmerâ€™s counsel admitted later he used the information from Dr.\r\nBurkeâ€™s report to ask about possible tests that could have been performed by\r\nDr. Barnard-Dupree but were not.&nbsp;\r\nOn redirect, the State asked Dr.\r\nBarnard-Dupree if anyone else had performed a static-99 evaluation.&nbsp; She\r\nanswered that somebody had, and it showed Farmer was at medium to high risk for\r\nre-offending.&nbsp; Farmerâ€™s counsel objected when the State began to ask this\r\nquestion.&nbsp;\r\nThe State argued that the questions\r\nby Farmerâ€™s counsel â€œopen[ed] the doorâ€ to testimony regarding the results\r\nof tests performed by Dr. Burke.&nbsp; The court concluded the State could â€œask\r\n[Dr. Barnard-Dupree] if sheâ€™s aware subsequent to her examination as to\r\nwhether or not those tests were done and by whom.â€&nbsp; However, the court\r\nstated, â€œI donâ€™t think you can have her testify about the results of those\r\ntests.&nbsp; Iâ€™m not going to allow you to do that anyway.â€\r\n&nbsp;The State then asked Dr.\r\nBarnard-Dupree if a static-99 and penile plethysmograph test were performed by\r\nanother psychologist and she answered affirmatively.&nbsp; She explained the\r\ntests, stated she had viewed the other psychologistâ€™s opinion, and testified\r\nthere was nothing that would contradict her own opinion.&nbsp;\r\nIn post-trial motions, Farmer\r\nrequested a new trial based in part on speculation caused by reference to Dr.\r\nBurkeâ€™s report.&nbsp; The State argued Farmer failed to timely object, or\r\nrequest the testimony be stricken from the record and a curative instruction\r\ngiven.&nbsp; The motion was denied.&nbsp;\r\nThe issue of Dr. Barnard-Dupreeâ€™s\r\ntestimony must be considered in two parts.&nbsp; First, the State asked Dr.\r\nBarnard-Dupree whether additional tests had been performed by another party, and\r\nFarmerâ€™s counsel objected.&nbsp; However, as the trial judge observed, Farmer\r\nopened the door for questioning about Dr. Burkeâ€™s additional testing.&nbsp;\r\nâ€œWhere one party introduces evidence as to a particular fact or transaction,\r\nthe other party is entitled to introduce evidence in explanation or rebuttal\r\nthereof, even though [the] latter evidence would be incompetent or irrelevant\r\nhad it been offered initially.â€&nbsp; State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508,\r\n513, 316 S.E.2d 395, 399 (1984).&nbsp; Furthermore, â€œ[t]he scope of redirect\r\nrests in the discretion of the trial court.â€&nbsp; Id.;\r\nsee also State v. Beam, 336 S.C. 45, 53, 518 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1999) (permitting redirect examination about the performance of a test when\r\ndefendantâ€™s counsel opened the door by asking about the existence of such a\r\ntest and its superiority).&nbsp;\r\nThe second part of the contested\r\ntestimony includes Dr. Barnard-Dupreeâ€™s statement that nothing in the results\r\nof Dr. Burkeâ€™s tests would contradict her own opinions.&nbsp; With this\r\nstatement, Dr. Barnard-Dupree likely went beyond the scope of the trial courtâ€™s\r\nlimitation.&nbsp; See U.S. v. Tran Trong Cuong, 18 F.3d 1132, 1143\r\n(4th Cir. 1994) (holding that an expert could not bolster his own testimony by\r\nstating that the results of other tests, not in evidence, were â€œessentially\r\nthe sameâ€ as his own opinion).&nbsp; However, Farmer did not contemporaneously\r\nobject to that testimony, and therefore, the issue is not preserved for our\r\nreview.&nbsp; See State v.

Colonial Ins. Co. of California,&nbsp;342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376,\r\n378&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Maddux Supply Co. v. Safhi, Inc., 316\r\nS.C. 404, 406, 450 S.E.2d 101, 102 (Ct. App. 1994)).&nbsp; Moreover, an\r\nappellate court will not disregard the fact that the trial court is in a better\r\nposition to determine the credibility of witnesses.&nbsp; Cherry v. Thomasson,\r\n276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).&nbsp; It is not for the appellate\r\ncourt to weigh the evidence.&nbsp; Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs.,\r\nInc., 343 S.C. 587, 594, 541 S.E.2d 257, 261 (2001).&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Damages award\r\nFripp claims the trial court erred\r\nin awarding Cavalier $31,300 plus interest, or, in the alternative, by failing\r\nto set-off this award with amounts attributable to Cavalierâ€™s defective and\r\nincomplete workmanship.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nFripp argued at trial and on appeal\r\nthat it was not obligated to pay Cavalier the final 10% because Cavalier did not\r\ncomplete the job as specified in the contract.&nbsp; Fripp placed particular\r\nemphasis on the presence of cracks in the poolâ€™s concrete, especially around\r\nthe drain, and problems with tiles used in the pool.&nbsp; The trial court,\r\nhowever, found Cavalier performed the work within a reasonable time, that â€œ[a]ll\r\nconditions precedent to the duty of Fripp Company to pay were performed by\r\nCavalier or otherwise fulfilledâ€ and Cavalier sustained a readily\r\nascertainable amount of damages of $31,300.&nbsp; In addition, the trial court\r\nawarded prejudgment interest at 8 3/4%.&nbsp; This decision was based on several\r\nfactors, including the trial courtâ€™s determination that the testimony of\r\nCavalier employees was more credible than the testimony of Dennis Robinson, the\r\nproject director and agent of Fripp.&nbsp;\r\nFor example, Robinson conveyed in a\r\nmemo to Cavalier that he put $20,000 into escrow to cover the final 10% due\r\nunder the contract.&nbsp; However, at trial, he admitted the money was never\r\nplaced in an actual escrow account.&nbsp; In addition, Robinson claimed Fripp\r\nincurred costs as a result of Cavalierâ€™s alleged failure to perform under the\r\ncontract.&nbsp; At trial he only presented one invoice for repairs in the amount\r\nof $2,879 and even admitted that, although $1,430 was used to replace tiles that\r\nhad allegedly fallen off the pools, the remainder of the invoice was for pool\r\nservice and other matters unrelated to Cavalierâ€™s performance.&nbsp; There was\r\nalso some question as to the authenticity of photos admitted by Fripp to show\r\nalleged cracks in the pools in question.[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn the other hand, Mark Horton, a\r\nCavalier employee, testified that he was unaware of problems with the\r\ntile.&nbsp; In fact, while explaining in detail the method of installing\r\ndecorative tile, he insisted that it was not â€œpossible for tile at the water\r\nlevel to fall out as its alleged that it did,â€ unless the tile was â€œforcibly\r\nremoved, pried, hit, knocked, or something.â€&nbsp; Horton also noted that\r\nCavalier repaired the items listed on the punch list, a list of items in need of\r\nrepair, before D.H.E.C. would issue approval.&nbsp; James Lloyd, president of\r\nCavalier with over 40 years of experience in the construction of pools, denied\r\nthe existence of cracks in the concrete and around the drain and testified as to\r\nthe industry standard regarding the acceptable tolerance for cracks.&nbsp; Lloyd\r\ncommented that none of the cracks in the photographs presented by Fripp appeared\r\nmore than one-eighth of an inch wide, the industry standard.&nbsp; Lloyd, whose\r\ntestimony the trial court found more credible, insisted that there was nothing\r\nâ€œremaining to be done to those pools pursuant to the contract.â€&nbsp; He\r\nacknowledged some problems arose with the pool, but all were covered under the\r\nwarranty and were separate and distinct from the requirements under the\r\ncontract.&nbsp;\r\nFripp also argues that the amount\r\nawarded should be set-off by the cost of repairs which it incurred.&nbsp; The\r\ntrial court held â€œ[i]f and to the extent that any defect requiring repair\r\nexists, the defect resulted from errors and omissions by Fripp Company and is\r\nnot the responsibility of Cavalier.â€&nbsp; Furthermore, Fripp did not make a\r\ndemand for a set-off in its answer, or in a counterclaim.&nbsp; See, e.g.,\r\nEllie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 102, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App.\r\n2004) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time\r\non appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be\r\npreserved for appellate review.â€).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court concluded that Frippâ€™s\r\nacceptance of the pool was not a condition precedent to Cavalierâ€™s obligation\r\nto perform under the contract and, thus, as a matter of law, Fripp breached the\r\nterms of the contract by not performing.&nbsp; â€œA condition precedent entails\r\nsomething that is essential to a right of action, as opposed to a condition\r\nsubsequent, which is something relied upon to modify or defeat the action.â€&nbsp;\r\nWorley v. Yarborough Ford, Inc., 317 S.C. 206, 210, 452 S.E.2d 622,\r\n624&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994).&nbsp; In contract law, the term connotes any fact\r\nother than the lapse of time, which, unless excused, must exist or occur before\r\na duty of immediate performance arises.&nbsp; Ballenger Corp. v. City of Columbia,\r\n286 S.C. 1, 5, 331 S.E.2d 365, 368 (Ct. App. 1985).&nbsp; The question of\r\nwhether a provision â€œin a contract constitutes a condition precedent is a\r\nquestion of construction dependent on the intent of the parties to be gathered\r\nfrom the language they employ.â€&nbsp; Id. at 5, 331 S.E.2d at 368.&nbsp; After reviewing the\r\nagreement, we hold as a matter of law that the agreement contains no express\r\nprovision or condition that makes Frippâ€™s acceptance of the pool a condition\r\nprecedent to its obligation to perform.&nbsp; Likewise, we conclude as a matter\r\nof law that such a condition precedent should not be implied from the facts of\r\nthis case.&nbsp; Generally, â€œa condition precedent may not be implied when it\r\nmight have been provided for by the express agreement.â€&nbsp; Worley,\r\n317 S.C. at 210, 452 S.E.2d at 625 (further citations omitted).\r\nThough Horton admitted that the\r\ncracks in the concrete on the photographs submitted by Fripp were not â€œthe\r\nbest workmanship that [he had] ever seenâ€ and that â€œ[t]here [were] some\r\nsubstantial problems with this concrete and the cracking and with the drain,â€\r\nthe contract was not conditioned on the acceptance of the work by Fripp.&nbsp;\r\nThe contract was entirely conditioned on â€œcompletion of each pool marsit[e]\r\nand approval by D.H.E.C.â€&nbsp; Cavalier completed the pools on March 28,\r\n2000.&nbsp; D.H.E.C. conducted its final inspection and issued final approval\r\nfor all four pools on April 14, 2000.&nbsp; Therefore, Cavalier fulfilled the\r\nconditions precedent under the contract, and Fripp breached by failing to pay\r\nthe final 10%.&nbsp;\r\nOver the term of the poolsâ€™\r\nconstruction, Cavalier submitted certain change orders, provided for in the\r\ncontract and subsequently accepted by Fripp, which affected the final amount due\r\nby $4,800.&nbsp; The trial court added this amount to the $27,500, which was\r\nstated in the contract and prayed for by Cavalier in its complaint, and arrived\r\nat an award of $31,300.&nbsp; The trial courtâ€™s calculation is in error since\r\nthe award should be $32,300.&nbsp; However, because neither party objected to\r\nthis amount, the issue is not preserved for our\r\nreview.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBased on the trial courtâ€™s\r\nfindings of fact, which depend so heavily upon the credibility of witnesses, we\r\nfind sufficient evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s\r\nruling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nII. Prejudgment interest\r\nFripp claims the trial court erred\r\nin awarding prejudgment interest because a sum certain was not established prior\r\nto trial.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nSection 34-31-20(A) of the South\r\nCarolina Code (1987) provides â€œ[i]n all cases of accounts stated and in all\r\ncases wherein any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained and, being due,\r\nshall draw interest according to law, the legal interest shall be at the rate of\r\neight and three-fourths percent per annum.â€&nbsp; Prejudgment interest is\r\nallowed on an obligation to pay money â€œfrom the time when, either by agreement\r\nof the parties or operation of law, the payment is demandable, if the sum is\r\ncertain or capable of being reduced to certainty.â€&nbsp; Wayne Smith\r\nConst., Co., Inc. v. Wolman, Duberstein, and Thompson, 294 S.C. 140, 146-47,\r\n363 S.E.2d 115, 119 (Ct. App. 1987). [3]&nbsp;\r\nâ€œAs a general rule, prejudgment interest is not appropriate when a plaintiff\r\nseeks to recover unliquidated damages. . . [h]owever, the fact that the sum due\r\nis disputed does not render the claim unliquidated for the purposes of an award\r\nof prejudgment interest.â€&nbsp; Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Employee Res.\r\nMgmt., Inc., 176 F.Supp.2d 510, 540-41 (2001); Wayne Smith Const., Co.,\r\nInc., 294 S.C. at 146-47, 363 S.E.2d at 119.&nbsp; In Wayne Smith\r\nConstruction Co., Inc., this court held that â€œ[t]he mere fact that the\r\npartnership disagreed with Smith Construction regarding the amount of the\r\nreimbursable costs did not preclude an award of prejudgment interest.&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 147, 363 S.E.2d at 119.&nbsp; Furthermore, â€œ[t]he right of a party to\r\nprejudgment interest is not affected by rights of discount or set-off claimed by\r\nthe opposing party.â€&nbsp; Lee v. Thermal Engâ€™g Corp., 352 S.C. 81,\r\n89, 572 S.E.2d 298, 302 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCavalier expressly sought damages\r\nfor breach of contract in its complaint.&nbsp; Moreover, it presented evidence\r\nat trial of the amounts owed.&nbsp; Therefore, Cavalier presented a claim that\r\narose â€œby agreement of the parties,â€ was â€œdemandable,â€ and was â€œcapable\r\nof being reduced to certaintyâ€ in the amount of\r\n$27,500.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn the alternative, assuming for the\r\nsake of argument that this court finds the prejudgment interest award proper,\r\nFripp argues the trial court erred in its calculation of prejudgment\r\ninterest.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe trial court ordered â€œthat\r\n[Cavalier] shall have judgment against [Fripp] in the amount of $40,279.77,\r\ntogether with interest at the rate of eight and three quarters (8 3/4%) percent\r\nper annum on that amount from May 2, 2003, until the date of judgment.â€&nbsp;\r\nFripp argues that section 34-31-20 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) only\r\nprovides for interest on the principle balance of an account on a per annum\r\nbasis; it does not allow for compounding interest with the principle.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, this court recognizes that the statute does not preclude a trial court,\r\nacting within its discretion, from awarding compound interest.&nbsp; See,\r\ne.g., J.C. White Lumber Co., Inc. v. Allen, 306 S.C. 183, 186, 410\r\nS.E.2d 588, 590 (Ct. App. 1991); Harmon v. Bank of Danville, 287 S.C.\r\n449, 454, 339 S.E.2d 150, 154 (Ct. App. 1985); Fisher v. Carolina Door\r\nProducts, Inc., 286 S.C. 5, 9-10, 331 S.E.2d 368, 370-71 (Ct. App.\r\n1985).&nbsp; Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s award of compounded prejudgment\r\ninterest was appropriate, as it was within the trial courtâ€™s\r\ndiscretion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED. [4]\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL and WILLIAMS,\r\nJJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Cavalier also filed suit against SCN Group, LLC, but it is not a\r\nparty to this appeal.\r\n[2] Robinson testified that the photographs depicted a pool area with\r\na grey deck, though he admitted the deck at the pools on his golf course were\r\nadobe or tan.\r\n[3] Though Fripp cites to Southern Welding Works v. K &amp; S\r\nConstruction Co., 286 S.C. 158, 332 S.E.2d 102 (Ct. App. 1985) for its basis\r\nin arguing against the prejudgment award, Fripp misstates the holding in that\r\ncase.&nbsp; This court in Southern Welding simply reiterated the\r\nlong-standing rule that prejudgment interest is allowed â€œif the sum is certain\r\nor capable of being reduced to certainty.â€&nbsp; 286 S.C. at 164, 332\r\nS.E.2d at 106 (emphasis added).\r\n[4] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-440","title":"State v.

Burch, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-450\r\nHeard June 17, 2005 â€“ Filed July 15, 2005\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nLouis David Nettles, of Florence, for Appellant.Â  \r\nTimothy Matthew Ammons, of Dillon, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  South Carolina Farm Bureau Insurance Company appeals a trial courtâ€™s order finding Ashley Brunsonâ€™s injuries were covered under the underinsured motorist provision of her motherâ€™s automobile insurance policy.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nAshley Brunson was a passenger in an automobile owned by Megan Hickey when it was involved in an accident.Â  Brunson suffered injuries as a result of the accident and sought coverage under the underinsured motorist portion of a policy issued to her mother, Connie Long, by South Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (Farm Bureau).Â  \r\nPart II of Longâ€™s policy describes her uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.Â  This section provides:Â  â€œWe will pay damages for bodily injury or property damage a covered person is legally entitled to collect from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.â€Â  Part II also provides definitions for various terms used in Part II.Â  This section defines a â€œcovered personâ€ as â€œa. you and any family member; b. any other person occupying your covered auto; c. any legal representative for damages sustained by persons described in a. or b. above, under any wrongful death statute.â€Â  Longâ€™s policy also contains a separate definition section for the entire policy.Â  This section defines â€œyouâ€ and â€œyourâ€ as â€œthe named insured shown on the Declarations; and the spouse if a resident of the same household.â€Â  This section also defines â€œfamily memberâ€ as â€œa person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who is a resident of your household.Â  This includes a ward or foster child.â€Â  \r\nOnly Longâ€™s name appeared under â€œNamed Insuredâ€ on the policyâ€™s declaration sheet.Â  The only vehicle included on the policyâ€™s declaration sheet was a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer.Â  The declaration sheet listed Brunson as a â€œDriver Listed on the Vehicle.â€Â  \r\nAfter Brunson submitted her claim for coverage, Farm Bureau informed her she was not entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under Longâ€™s policy.Â  Brunson filed suit against Farm Bureau seeking a declaratory judgment to determine coverage under the policy.Â  The trial court determined the language in the policy was ambiguous because it did not address the rights and responsibilities of a listed driver.Â  Due to this ambiguity, the trial court held as a matter of law that the policy afforded underinsured motorist benefits to listed drivers.Â  Farm Bureau filed a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, which the trial court denied.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â \r\nDoe v. South Carolina Med. Malpractice Liab. Joint Underwriting Assâ€™n,\r\n347 S.C. 642, 645, 557 S.E.2d 670, 672 (2001) (quoting Felts v. Richland County,\r\n303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991)).Â  â€œAn action to determine coverage under an insurance policy is an action at law.â€Â  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wilson,\r\n344 S.C. 525, 528-29, 544 S.E.2d 848, 849 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, our review extends only to the correction of error of law.Â \r\nKemp v. Rawlings, 358 S.C. 28, 34, 594 S.E.2d 845, 848 (2004).Â  Therefore, we will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact unless they are wholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â \r\nMcInnis v. McInnis, 348 S.C. 585, 589, 560 S.E.2d 632, 634 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n1.&nbsp; Ambiguity \r\n    Farm Bureau argues the trial court erred in finding the language in Longâ€™s policy ambiguous, and thus, it erred in interpreting the language in the policy to find underinsured motorist coverage for Brunsonâ€™s injuries.Â  Specifically, Farm Bureau asserts Brunson does not meet the definition of â€œcovered personâ€ based on the definition of â€œcovered personâ€ and â€œyouâ€ in the policy.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n    â€œInsurance policies are subject to the general rules of contract construction.â€Â \r\n    Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Carl Brazell Builders, Inc., 356 S.C. 156, 162, 588 S.E.2d 112, 115 (2003).Â  Thus, the court must give the policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe meaning of a particular word or phrase is not determined by considering the word or phrase by itself, but by reading the policy as a whole and considering the context and subject matter of the insurance contract.â€Â \r\n    Stewart v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 341 S.C. 143, 151, 533 S.E.2d 597, 601 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œWhen a contract is unambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have used.â€Â \r\n    Hardee v. Hardee, 355 S.C. 382, 387, 585 S.E.2d 501, 503 (2003).Â  â€œAn insurerâ€™s obligation under a policy of insurance is defined by the terms of the policy itself and cannot be enlarged by judicial construction.â€Â  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wilson,\r\n    344 S.C. 525, 530, 544 S.E.2d 848, 850 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The courtâ€™s function is â€œto enforce an insurance contract as made by the parties, and not to rewrite or to distort, under the guise of judicial construction, contracts, the terms of which are plain and unambiguous.â€Â  Stewart, 341 S.C. at 151, 533 S.E.2d at 601.Â  Therefore, the courtâ€™s province is not to construe contracts broader than the parties have elected to make them or to award benefits where none were intended.Â  Id.  \r\n    Since Brunson is not a named insured on the declaration page of the policy, Brunson does not fall within the definition of â€œyou.â€Â  Furthermore, since Brunson is not a resident of her motherâ€™s household, she does not meet the definition of â€œfamily member.â€Â  Because the accident at issue did not involve the 1999 Blazer, Brunson is not a covered person under sub-section (b) of the definition.Â  Finally, no wrongful death statute is implicated, so subsection (c) is not relevant.Â  Thus, under the clear language of the policy, Brunson does not qualify as a named insured.\r\n    The failure to define â€œdriver listed on the vehicleâ€ does not render the policy ambiguous in the face of the clearly defined provisions of the policy.Â  Recently, in Ex parte United States Auto. Assâ€™n, Op. No. 3977 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Apr. 18, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 17 at 78), we addressed a similar issue of whether the failure to define the term â€œoperatorâ€ in a policy created an ambiguity and determined that it did not.Â  Id. at 83.Â  After reviewing cases from other jurisdictions, we adopted the majority rule and held that â€œlisting an individual as an operator on the declarations page of an insurance policy does not make that individual a named insured.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n    Because Brunson does not fit within the parameters of the â€œcovered person,â€ she is not entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under the policy.\r\n    2.&nbsp; Additional Sustaining Ground\r\n    At oral argument Brunson argued the policy was ambiguous because it failed to specify whether the relevant definitions were to be applied at the time the policy was issued or at the time of the accident.Â  The trial court did not consider this particular issue, but because the matter is raised as an additional or alternative sustaining ground, we may consider it.Â  Iâ€™On L.L.C.&nbsp;v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000).Â  However, this ground is not argued in Brunsonâ€™s brief and was raised for the first time at oral argument.Â  Therefore, Brunson abandoned the additional sustaining ground by failing to raise it in the appellate brief.Â  Id. at 420, 526 S.E.2d at 723.Â  Even if Brunson did not abandon the additional ground, it would be unjust and unwise for us to rule on this issue under these circumstances, and we decline to do so.Â  \r\n    CONCLUSION\r\n    We find the trial court erred in finding the language in Longâ€™s policy ambiguous as to whether underinsured motorist benefits are available to a listed driver.Â  Thus, we find the trial court erred in determining that the definition of â€œyouâ€ contained in the policy includes a listed driver.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s order is \r\n    REVERSED.\r\n    ANDERSON, STILWELL, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-451","title":"SCDSS v.

Lindemann, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Alexander and Etta Harris, individually and as parents of Anita Harris, initiated this medical malpractice action in 1996.Â  Following years of delay and numerous continuances, the case was called for trial a final time on July 22, 2002, at which time the Harrises sought another continuance or, alternatively, a dismissal.Â  The trial court refused a further continuance but granted the Harrisesâ€™ request for a dismissal.Â  The Harrises appeal from the dismissal of their action.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nAfter filing this medical malpractice suit in 1996, the Harrises obtained a voluntary dismissal in 1999 pursuant to Rule 41(a), SCRCP.Â Â  In 2000, the Harrises refiled the action.Â  In 2001, on the motion of the Harrises, the court struck the case from the jury roster for 180 days.Â  The case was subsequently returned to the jury roster and called for trial on June 3, 2002.Â  Counsel for the Harrises did not appear for trial.Â  The trial court contacted the Harrisesâ€™ counsel who, by way of a conference call, informed the judge that he was in a criminal trial in Atlanta, Georgia, and could not appear.[1]Â Â Â  \r\nAt that time, the court found the â€œPlaintiffâ€™s attorney has obtained various extensions and voluntary dismissals and this Court finds no excuse to again delay trial on the eve of a scheduled trial date.â€Â  Rather than dismiss the case, the trial court, by an order dated June 6, 2002, continued the case again and set the case for a date certain trial on July 22, 2002.Â  Additionally, that order stated discovery was ended and no witnesses, lay or expert, could be added to the witnesses already listed in the answers to interrogatories.Â  Although it is admitted that the July 22 trial date was known to the parties, it appears that the order ending discovery was not sent to the parties.Â Â  Â \r\nWhen the case was called for trial on July 22, the Harrisesâ€™ attorney motioned the court to set aside its previous June 6, 2002, order, reopen discovery, and establish a new scheduling order in light of newly discovered evidence and the need for additional discovery.Â  The court heard extensive argument on the motion and ultimately denied it.Â  When asked if he was ready to go forward, the Harrisesâ€™ attorney answered, â€œNo, your honor.â€Â  He further stated, â€œWeâ€™d just ask the court if the court would grant us a continuance on this, and if the court does not grant a continuance, we have no choice but to take a voluntary dismissalâ€”or an involuntary dismissal of this case.â€Â  The court denied the request for the continuance and stated, â€œweâ€™ll either go forward or youâ€™re taking an involuntary non-suit.â€Â  The Harrisesâ€™ attorney again stated â€œit is our position weâ€™re taking an involuntary non-suit if the court refuses to grant a continuance.â€Â  After asking again whether plaintiffs were ready for trial and being told no, the court told them, â€œYour motion for an involuntary non-suit is granted.â€Â  The Harrises now appeal.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWe begin with the fundamental appellate precept that a party may not challenge on appeal a ruling that he requested. Rule 201(b) of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules provides: â€œOnly a party aggrieved by an order, judgment or sentence may appeal.â€ (emphasis added); see also Beaufort Realty Co., Inc. v. Beaufort County, 346 S.C. 298, 301, 551 S.E.2d 588, 589 (Ct. App. 2001) (noting that â€œ[t]he word â€˜aggrievedâ€™ [in Rule 201(b)] refers to a substantial grievance, a denial of some personal or property right, or the imposition on a party of a burden or obligationâ€).Â  In this case, the Harrises effectively waived any and all assignments of error or any colorable claim that they have otherwise suffered a substantial grievance when they requested, and the trial court granted, their request for a dismissal.\r\nIn any event, we find no merit in the Harrisesâ€™ various arguments.Â  First, we find the Harrisesâ€™ assertion that the trial court improperly, sua sponte dismissed the case to be incorrect.Â  As noted, the trial court simply acquiesced in the Harrisesâ€™ request for a dismissal when the court refused another continuance.Â  But cf. Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C. 201, 211, 493 S.E.2d 826, 832&nbsp;(1997) (holding that a trial judge possesses the inherent power to dismiss actions sua sponte for a partyâ€™s failure to prosecute his claim); Crout v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank, 278 S.C. 120, 123-24, 293 S.E.2d 422, 423-24&nbsp;(1982) (affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision to dismiss the case with prejudice when a motion for continuance was denied and appellant was unprepared to try the case when called for trial).\r\nThe next assignment of error stems from the trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant an additional continuance when the case was called for trial on July 22.Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of the Harrisesâ€™ continuance request.Â  Reiland v. Southland Equip. Serv., Inc., 330 S.C. 617, 637, 500 S.E.2d 145, 155-56 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding that a trial judgeâ€™s ruling on a motion for a continuance will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion).Â  We further note that when requesting a continuance on the basis of a lack of material evidence, the moving party must show not only the absence of some material evidence, but also due diligence on his part to obtain it.Â  Hudson v. Blanton, 282 S.C. 70, 74, 316 S.E.2d 432, 434 (Ct. App. 1984). [2]&nbsp; \r\nWere we to accept the Harrisesâ€™ contention that the\r\nso-called material evidence had been disclosed in June 2002, we would be\r\nconstrained to join the able trial judge in finding that they failed to exercise\r\ndue diligence to obtain the evidence.&nbsp; This failure is especially\r\nsignificant considering the age of this case, the repeated delays, the courtâ€™s\r\nwillingness to set the trial as a date certain,[3] \r\nthe clear prior warning by the court that this case would be tried on that\r\nspecific date, and the Harrisesâ€™ counselâ€™s position a month earlier in June\r\nthat the case was ready for trial but for his being called for trial in\r\nAtlanta.&nbsp; The denial of the motion for yet another continuance was proper.\r\nThe Harrises finally allege the\r\ncourt erred in excluding any expert witnesses not disclosed in discovery before\r\nJune 6, 2002.&nbsp; This issue is not preserved for our review.&nbsp;\r\nIn Gold Kist, Inc. v. Citizens and Southern National Bank of South Carolina,\r\n286 S.C. 272, 280-81, 333 S.E.2d 67, 73&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1985), we considered the\r\nexclusion of deposition testimony.&nbsp; In that case, the trial court excluded\r\nthe testimony because the proponent of the testimony made only a bare assertion\r\nthe witness was living at the time in Georgia and desired the deposition\r\ntestimony be admitted under then Circuit Court Rule 87(d)(3).[4]&nbsp; Id.  at 281, 333 S.E.2d at 73.&nbsp; We\r\nupheld the trial courtâ€™s ruling in part because: &nbsp; \r\n\r\nGold Kist failed to establish a sufficient record on which\r\nadequate review of the issue could be made. Gold Kist did not set forth in the\r\ntranscript of record a proffer of the evidence it sought to introduce. Assuming arguendo \r\nthe court erred in excluding the deposition, without the proffer we cannot\r\ndetermine the prejudicial nature of the error. Without a showing of prejudice,\r\nthe Court will not reverse a judgment for alleged error in the exclusion of\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nThis court considered a similar situation in Ward v. Epting, 290 S.C. 547, 351 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  There, the trial court limited redirect examination of an expert witness.Â  Id. at 559, 351 S.E.2d at 874.Â  The court noted the appellant did not proffer any evidence and stated: â€œIf counsel fails to make an offer of proof as to excluded evidence, or fails to include an offer of proof in the record, there is nothing to review.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn this case, the Harrises also failed to proffer the evidence.Â  The failure to proffer evidence makes it impossible for this court to determine if any real prejudice resulted from the exclusion.Â  For this reason, the issue of the exclusion of the expert witnesses is not preserved.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the order of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Presumably, the Harrisesâ€™ case would have proceeded to trial but for the purported unavailability of their counsel.Â  Subsequent events revealed that the case was not ready for trial in June 2002. \r\n\r\n[2] We, of course, recognize that the medical records would be important to a\r\nplaintiff in a medical malpractice case, but it is not clear to us when the\r\nHarrises came to possess the records.&nbsp; The Harrisesâ€™ counsel informed the\r\ntrial court that he did not receive the records from the Respondents until June\r\n2002, just prior to the calling of the case.&nbsp; However, the Respondentsâ€™\r\nattorney countered that the Harrises received a copy of the medical records\r\nbefore the suit was filed and that he had additionally sent another copy of the\r\nrecords while the action was pending.&nbsp; The court weighed these competing\r\narguments and stated: â€œIt appears to me thereâ€™s a difference of opinion\r\nabout whether or not youâ€™ve had these records, and this might not have reached\r\nthe stage that it has, had you taken the time, effort and energy to involve\r\nyourself with this case . . . .â€&nbsp; He further questioned, â€œHow . . .\r\ncould you be surprised at anything, and if you didnâ€™t have the medical\r\nrecords, why havenâ€™t you taken the necessary steps to have the court order\r\nthem?&nbsp; The 2000 case has been around for two years.&nbsp; Why havenâ€™t you\r\nfiled a motion to compel if you needed these records?â€&nbsp; \r\n[3] We note: \r\n\r\n  \r\nThe court bears a great responsibility when signing a scheduling order which grants [a date certain trial], because it directly impacts upon the rights of other litigants. When we review the denial of a continuance in the exercise of the courtâ€™s discretion under these circumstances, we are mindful of the responsibility which the parties and their counsel assume by seeking and receiving a day-certain status. It is incumbent upon them to lay aside other business, and give priority in their preparation to that which they have asked the court to prioritize.\r\n  \r\n\r\nHundley ex rel. Hundley v.

Thomas, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No.Â  2005-UP-454\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2005 â€“ Filed July 19, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDexter Cumbee, of Hardeeville, for Appellant.\r\nJack M. Scoville, Jr., of Georgetown, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Dexter Cumbee appeals the dismissal of his action for conversion against Georgetown County.[1]Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 7, 1991, Georgetown County Sheriffâ€™s deputies searched Cumbeeâ€™s car wash for drugs pursuant to a search warrant.Â  Drugs were found at the car wash and hidden in a motorbike at the carwash.Â  Cumbee was arrested and his 1984 Oldsmobile Ciera was also searched.Â  No drugs were found in the car, but it was towed to the Sheriffâ€™s Department impoundment lot.Â  Cumbee was convicted of the drug charges, and he served seven years in prison.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter his release from prison on June 23, 2000, Cumbee contacted the Georgetown County Sheriffâ€™s Department regarding his car.Â  Cumbee was informed that no one knew the location of his car or what happened to it.Â  On February 5, 2002, Cumbee brought the underlying action for conversion against the Sheriffâ€™s Department, and he filed an amended complaint on May 17, 2002.Â  In both complaints, Cumbee alleged that the Sheriffâ€™s Department had his car on August 12, 1991, and inquired about gaining title to an abandoned vehicle.Â  Cumbee claimed that he never abandoned the car, that the car should have been turned over to his relatives, and that the Sheriffâ€™s Department converted the car to its own use and still had it.Â  Cumbee sought damages including the return of the car or its fair market value, fair rental value of the car for the time period it was in the custody of the Sheriffâ€™s Department, costs, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Sheriffâ€™s Department moved to dismiss the action, arguing: the complaint failed to state a cause of action; the action was barred by the statute of limitations; service of process was insufficient; and Cumbee sued the wrong defendant.Â  Cumbee argued that he did not have any knowledge that the Sheriffâ€™s Department failed to turn his car over to a family member until he was released from prison.Â  Thus, he argued, the statute of limitations on his cause of action against the Sheriffâ€™s Department was tolled until after he was released from prison.Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted the Sheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  The court determined that Cumbeeâ€™s cause of action against the Sheriffâ€™s Department accrued on August 7, 1991.Â  The court found that â€œ[w]hile the statute of limitations is normally an affirmative defense, it may properly be the basis of a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6) if the facts supporting the motion appear on the face of the complaint.â€[3]Â  The court found that Cumbeeâ€™s action was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn review of a motion to dismiss on the pleadings, â€œthe appellate tribunal applies the same standard of review that was implemented by the trial court.â€Â  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 233, 553 S.E.2d 496, 500 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, the trial court must base its ruling solely on allegations set forth in the complaint.Â  Viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, if the facts and inferences reasonably drawn from the facts alleged in the complaint would entitle the plaintiff to relief under any theory, the motion to dismiss should be denied.Â  Bergstrom v. Palmetto Health Alliance, 358 S.C. 388, 395, 596 S.E.2d 42, 45 (2004).Â  The complaint should not be dismissed merely because the court doubts the plaintiff will prevail.Â  Id.  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nCumbee argues the circuit court erred in granting the Sheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€™s motion for summary judgment[4] because his cause of action was not barred by the statute of limitations.Â  He asserts that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until he discovered the car was missing upon his release from prison.[5]Â  We disagree.\r\nIn determining whether a statute of limitations bars a cause of action, we must first determine when the cause of action arose.Â  Under the â€œdiscovery rule,â€ a statute of limitations begins to run on the date when the underlying cause of action reasonably ought to have been discovered, or when a â€œparty knows or should have known by the exercise of reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises from the wrongful conduct.â€Â  Bayle v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 123, 542 S.E.2d 736, 740 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Determining when an injured party should have known that a cause of action arose is an objective determination.Â  Courts must determine â€œwhether the circumstances of the case would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded, or that some claim against another party might exist.â€Â  Young v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 333 S.C. 714, 719, 511 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1999).Â Â Â Â  \r\nCumbee argues he did not know and could not have known through the exercise of due diligence that he had a cause of action against the Sheriffâ€™s Department until after he got out of jail and made a demand for his car in June 2000.Â  Viewing the allegations in the complaint objectively, it is clear that Cumbee knew his car was at the Sheriffâ€™s Department when he was arrested, and he failed to make other arrangements for the car.Â  Accordingly, we find Cumbee should have discovered the cause of action on August 7, 1991.Â  We agree with the circuit courtâ€™s finding that the cause of action arose on that date.Â  \r\nWe now turn to whether the cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  Cumbee alleged in his complaint that the Sheriffâ€™s Department took control over his car in August 1991.Â  The statute of limitations for â€œan action for taking, detaining, or injuring goods or chattels including an action for specific recovery of personal propertyâ€ is three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (4) (2005).Â  At the time Cumbeeâ€™s car was impounded in 1991, the statute of limitations could be tolled for a minor plaintiff, someone incarcerated with less than a life sentence, or someone determined to be insane.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-40 (Supp. 1990).Â  The â€œperiod within which the action must be brought cannot be extended:Â  (a) more than five years by any such disability, except infancy; nor (b) in any case longer than one year after the disability ceases.â€Â  Id.Â  This section was amended in 1996 to delete incarceration as a disability that would toll the statute.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-40 (2005). \r\nWe find the statute of limitations expired prior to Cumbee filing the underlying cause of action under both the 1991 and the post-1996 versions of the tolling statute.Â  It is clear from the pleadings that the cause of action arose on August 7, 1991, Cumbee was incarcerated until June 23, 2000, and the underlying lawsuit was filed, at the earliest, on February 2, 2002.Â  Applying the law in place when Cumbee filed his 2002 complaint, no tolling provision existed for inmates and the three-year statute of limitations would have expired on August 7, 1994.Â  Under the law in place at the time the cause of action accrued in 1991, the three-year statute of limitations for Cumbeeâ€™s action would have been tolled for five years.Â  Under that statute, Cumbee had a total of eight years after the accrual date in which to file his lawsuit.Â  Thus, the statute of limitations would have expired by August 7, 1999.Â  \r\nViewing the facts and reasonable inferences from the facts on the face of the pleadings, it is clear that the statute of limitations expired before Cumbee filed the underlying action.Â  Thus, the facts alleged in Cumbeeâ€™s complaint would not have supported relief under any theory.Â  Accordingly, it was appropriate for the circuit court to grant the Sheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause the statute of limitations expired prior to the filing of the underlying action, the circuit courtâ€™s order granting the Sheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€™s motion to dismiss is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n HEARN, C.J., BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Although the caption on the appeal indicates that Cumbee sued Georgetown County, it is clear from the record that the underlying action concerns the activities of the Georgetown County Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  Accordingly, we refer to the respondent in this appeal as the Georgetown County Sheriffâ€™s Department for clarity. \r\n[2] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[3] Â The defense of the running of the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that normally must be asserted in an answer.Â  Rule 8(c), SCRCP.Â  It is not clear from the record whether the Sheriffâ€™s Department filed an answer asserting the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.Â  Although it appears that a court may grant a motion to dismiss based upon the statute of limitations where the facts alleged in the complaint reveal the statute has run, Cumbee does not challenge the circuit courtâ€™s finding to that effect.Â  See Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, 367-68, 353 S.E.2d 697, 699 (1987) (reversing the circuit courtâ€™s grant of a motion to dismiss based upon the statute of limitations where the defense was not apparent from the face of the complaint); Citizens &amp; S. Natâ€™l Bank of S.C. v. Constr. Enter., 309 S.C. 500, 504, 424 S.E.2d 530, 532 (Ct. App. 1992) (reversing the circuit courtâ€™s grant of judgment on the pleadings based on the defendantâ€™s affirmative defense of the statute of limitations where the complaint raised issues of fact regarding the time limit and the plaintiffs were not required to file a reply to the affirmative defenses); Brown v. Lexington County, 283 S.C 27, 28-29, 320 S.E.2d 498, 499 (Ct. App. 1984) (affirming the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of an action where the complaint revealed on its face that the statute of limitations had run).Â  Thus, it is the law of the case.Â  ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 241, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997) (holding that an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).Â  \r\n[4]Â  Although the circuit court granted the Sheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€™s motion to dismiss, Cumbee argues on appeal that the court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment.Â  It does not appear from the record that the court considered outside affidavits or any matters other than Cumbeeâ€™s pleadings and the arguments of the parties.Â  See Rule 12(b), SCRCP (stating that when a court considers matters outside the pleadings in ruling on a motion to dismiss, the motion should be treated as one for summary judgment). Therefore, we will treat this appeal as one from the grant of a motion to dismiss based solely upon the pleadings.Â  \r\n[5]Â  Cumbee also argues the Sheriffâ€™s Department was the constructive bailee of his car and therefore had an obligation to return it to him.Â  However, this argument was never raised before the circuit court.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for appellate review and we decline to address it.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (holding that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court may not be considered on appeal). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-455","title":"Williams v.

(â€œthe Businessâ€), Wifeâ€™s familyâ€™s business at Pawleys Island.Â  During Wifeâ€™s motherâ€™s struggle with a serious illness and after her eventual death, Wife spent a considerable amount of time and effort running and maintaining the Business.Â  Husband attended school and worked at various jobs during the marriage.Â  At the time of the divorce, the couple owned 80 % of the Business, with 70% in Wifeâ€™s name and 10% in Husbandâ€™s.\r\nThe couple first separated in July 2001.Â  Wife filed an action for divorce, alleging Husband wasted large sums of their assets, presumably on illegal drugs, and physically abused her.[2]Â  In December 2001, the couple briefly attempted reconciliation and the initial divorce action was dismissed.Â  By April 2002, however, they were again separated.Â  Shortly thereafter Wife re-filed for divorce based on the prior physical abuse and Husbandâ€™s continued wasteful spending of the coupleâ€™s assets.\r\nFollowing a lengthy trial, Wife was granted a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s separation.Â  In its final order, the family court determined, inter alia, that the value of the Business was $90,269.66, making the coupleâ€™s interest in the entity worth $72,215.72.Â  The family court divided the marital property, including the Business, awarding 91% to Wife and 9% to Husband.Â  These two aspects of the family courtâ€™s order, the valuation of the business and the apportionment of the overall marital property, were then appealed by Husband. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has authority to determine facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 328, 526 S.E.2d 241, 244-45 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  This court, however, is not required to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings, nor should we ignore the fact that the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their testimony.Â  Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 1999); Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 453, 486 S.E.2d 516, 519 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI. Valuation of the Business\r\nHusband argues the trial court erred in basing the Businessâ€™s value on the â€œstockholdersâ€™ equityâ€ value listed on the Businessâ€™s 2002 income tax assessment.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œIn dividing marital property, the family court must identify both real and personal property and determine the fair market value of the identified property.â€Â \r\nPerry v. Estate of Perry, 323 S.C. 232, 237, 473 S.E.2d 860, 863 (Ct. App. 1996). Â When a court is met with the task of valuing a business, each case must be decided on the facts and circumstances of that particular case; thus, the court is not restricted to any one method of valuation.Â \r\nBelk of Spartanburg, S.C., Inc. v. Thompson,\r\n337 S.C. 109, 116, 522 S.E.2d 357, 360 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, no matter what valuation method is utilized, the court must still obtain what it considers to be the fair market value of the ongoing business.Â \r\nRGM v. DEM, 306 S.C. 145, 152, 410 S.E.2d 564, 568 (1991).Â  Fair market value is defined as what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for a business.Â  Reid v. Reid, 280 S.C. 367, 373, 312 S.E.2d 724, 727 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  This value is determined by valuing the assets as part of a â€œgoing businessâ€ and not as liquidated assets.\r\nWoodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 214, 363 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  \r\nIn the present case, the family court utilized the â€œstockholdersâ€™ equityâ€ value, as listed on the Businessâ€™s 2002 income tax assessment, for the purpose of equitable distribution.Â  â€œStockholdersâ€™ equity,â€ also known as â€œbook value,â€ includes the capital a business receives in exchange for stock and essentially amounts to a businessâ€™s total assets less its total liabilities.Â  As opposed to â€œbook value,â€ â€œmarket valueâ€ contemplates the price a business would most likely sell for on the current market.Â  The market value of a business can be greater or less than the businessâ€™s â€œbook valueâ€ or â€œstockholdersâ€™ equity.â€Â  Accordingly, we reverse the family courtâ€™s valuation of the Business and remand this issue for proper determination of the Businessâ€™s fair market value.\r\nII. Equitable Distribution of the Marital Property\r\nHusband argues the family courtâ€™s apportionment of the marital property, granting 91% to Wife, was an abuse of discretion.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) requires the family court to consider fifteen factors in apportioning marital property, including the duration of the marriage, any marital misconduct on the part of either party, the contributions of both parties to the marital property, and the income of both spouses.Â  In reviewing the family courtâ€™s distribution of marital property, an appellate courtâ€™s role is to examine the fairness of the apportionment as a whole.Â  Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 24, 553 S.E.2d 251, 255 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nThe family court adequately addressed several of the statutory factors in determining an equitable distribution of the marital property, but it is clear that the foundation of the courtâ€™s determination was the perceived marital misconduct on the part of Husband.Â  The bulk of the family courtâ€™s analysis of equitable distribution relied on the following considerations:\r\n\r\nThe marriage ended because of [Husbandâ€™s] misconduct.Â  [Husband] is an intelligent and well-educated man who has basically wasted his life to this point trying to get by through manipulation and guile.Â  He has never held a job for an extended period.Â  He has been convicted of both Driving Under the Influence and Distribution of Cocaine.Â  He has continued to use illegal drugs and wasted substantial marital assets during this marriage.Â  He has physically abused [Wife] and tried to alienate the partiesâ€™ children from their mother.Â  [Husband] is a good example of the â€œme firstâ€ generation whose prime motivation in all things is self-gratification.Â  After observing [Husband] at trial, and particularly during his testimony, the court finds him to be totally lacking in credibility. . . . The only wonder in this marriage is that it took [Wife] so long to get up the courage to leave him.\r\n\r\nIt is readily apparent that the family court was not impressed by Husbandâ€™s behavior, nor did it find his testimony the least bit credible.Â  We initially note that this view of Husbandâ€™s character and the credibility of his testimony is certainly supported by the evidence in the record.Â  Several allegations regarding Husbandâ€™s drug use, frivolous spending habits, and abusive personality were asserted at trial, and Husband conclusively refuted none.Â  However, despite Husbandâ€™s despicable behavior and what appears to be his complete lack of integrity, the law regarding the proper consideration of marital misconduct in determining an equitable distribution of marital property is well established.Â  While marital misconduct or fault remains a powerful consideration in apportioning marital property,[3] the purposes of equitable distribution are not punitive; thus, no degree of misconduct justifies a severe penalty.Â  See, e.g., Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 235-36, 512 S.E.2d 539, 546 (Ct. App. 1999) (lowering a wifeâ€™s award of 75% of the marital property, finding it â€œunjustifiably punitiveâ€ on the husband notwithstanding his fault in the dissolution of the marriage); see also Noll v. Noll, 297 S.C. 190, 196, 375 S.E.2d 338, 342 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œFault is a factor for the court to consider in an equitable division award although it does not justify a severe penalty.â€).Â  While we concur with the family courtâ€™s assessment of Husbandâ€™s behavior and agree with the consideration of such in distributing the marital assets, we nevertheless find a division of 91% to Wife and 9% to Husband punitive in nature.Â  Because we remand the present case for determination of the Businessâ€™s fair market value, we also invite reconsideration of the overall apportionment of the marital estate taking into account all the enumerated factors of section 20-7-472.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the family courtâ€™s order is\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Husband earned a degree in golf course management from a local technical college.\r\n[2] Husband was convicted of driving under the influence and distribution of cocaine prior to the marriage.Â  Wife was aware of the convictions prior to marrying Husband.Â  Also, an altercation ensued in July 2001 when Wife announced she was leaving Husband.Â  As a result, Husband was arrested for domestic violence.\r\n[3] As long as the marital misconduct occurs prior to one of the three enumerated occurrences listed in Section 20-7-472(2) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004), it is a valid consideration in equitable distribution even if it is not relied upon as a ground for divorce.Â  Accordingly, we give no credence to Husbandâ€™s assertions that the coupleâ€™s brief reconciliation rendered consideration of his misconduct improper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-456","title":"Myers v.

Caldwell, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2005-UP-456\r\nHeard June 16, 2005 â€“ Filed July 19, 2005\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Cheryl Turner Hopkins, of Florence, for Appellant.\r\nStephanie P. McDonald, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Gladys Myers (Wife) appeals a family court order that requires Wife and Joe Myers (Husband) to resolve the division of a certificate of deposit or submit to a new trial regarding the equitable division of their marital property.Â  We reverse. \r\n    In its February 26, 2004 divorce decree, the family court ordered Husband to pay Wife $250.00 per month in alimony and ordered the coupleâ€™s marital property to be divided pursuant to an agreement between the parties.Â  The order indicated the parties agreed to the assets included in the list of marital property.Â  The list included the coupleâ€™s accounts, one of which was â€œthe Seaboard Trust CD Account #1980-81 in the amount of $37,012.41.â€Â  According to the order, Wife was to receive the entire amount of the Seaboard Trust CD account.Â  The order also provided that Husband, who maintained that two of their accounts were non-marital,[1] would provide documentation to establish the accounts were non-marital, or the court would deem them marital property and subject the accounts to an equitable division.Â  Neither party made any post-trial motions.\r\n    On May 7, 2004, Wife filed a rule to show cause after Husband failed to comply with the family courtâ€™s order.Â  On June 21, 2004, after deciding the Husband did not understand the terms of the agreement, the family court judge gave the parties 30 days to investigate the source of the Seaboard Trust CD and to submit a consent order resolving the division.Â  The judge further ruled that if the parties were unable to resolve the division, the equitable division portion of the order was to be set aside and a new trial was to be ordered on the issue of equitable division.Â  This appeal followed.\r\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n        â€œOn appeal from an order of the family court, this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Hopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 304, 540 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2000).Â  Nevertheless, this broad scope of review does not require this court to ignore the findings of the family court.Â  Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 58, 552 S.E.2d 329, 334 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œNeither are we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, â€œ[t]he apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 58, 606 S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n        LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n            Wife argues the family court abused its discretion when it sua sponte ordered a new trial on the issue of equitable division at a hearing on a rule to show cause.Â  We agree.\r\n            â€œThe [family] courtâ€™s order as it affects distribution of marital property shall be a final order not subject to modification except by appeal or remand following proper appeal.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004).Â  â€œFailure to challenge the ruling â€˜is an abandonment of the issue and precludes consideration on appeal.â€™â€Â \r\n            Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 338, 491 S.E.2d 583, 588 (Ct. App. 1997) (quoting Biales v. Young, 315 S.C. 166, 168, 432 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1993)).Â  â€œThe unchallenged ruling, â€˜right or wrong, is the law of the case and requires affirmance.â€™â€Â  Id. (quoting Buckner v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 161, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970)).Â  Furthermore, this court has held that â€œa family court judge does not have the authority to alter or amend a judgment, sua sponte, once the judgment is more than 10 days old.â€Â  Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 157, 543 S.E.2d 224, 229 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n            Husband did not object to the family courtâ€™s classification of the Seaboard Trust CD as marital property and consented to its inclusion as marital property in the settlement agreement.Â  Husband cannot now object, nor could he at the rule to show cause hearing because he failed to file any timely post-trial motions.[2]Â  See, e.g., Wood v. Wood, 298 S.C. 30, 32, 378 S.E.2d 59, 61 (Ct. App. 1989) (â€œThe failure to challenge the valuation of the residence in the prior appeal forecloses Dr. Wood from challenging it now.â€).Â  Husbandâ€™s failure to file any post-trial motions and the family courtâ€™s lack of continuing jurisdiction in the matter precluded the family court from vacating its prior order.[3]  \r\n            REVERSED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., BEATTY, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Husband claimed that the Hilliard Lyons Account #61427207 in the amount of $77,908.31 and the Hilliard Lyons Account #61427908 in the amount $45,602.38 were non-marital assets.\r\n[2] The family court judge even commented at the hearing, â€œSo thereâ€™s no motion to amend the order or anything?â€Â  \r\n[3] Although a court may relieve a party from final judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, Husband did not file a Rule 60 motion.Â  See, e.g., Deidun, 362 S.C. at 63, 606 S.E.2d at 498 (granting Rule 60 relief to a husband, who made a Rule 60 motion and who had justifiablyâ€”yet mistakenlyâ€”relied on his accountantâ€™s figures, in a matter that did not adversely impact the wife).Â  Without a timely motion, Husband is not entitled to relief.Â  See Rodman (Fried) v. Rodman, 361 S.C. 291, 294-96, 604 S.E.2d 399, 401-02 (Ct. App. 2004) (discussing the timeliness of motions under Rule 60(b)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-457","title":"State v.

Wilson,&nbsp;345\r\nS.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829&nbsp;(2001).&nbsp; We are bound by the trial\r\ncourtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.&nbsp; State v.\r\nQuattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000).&nbsp;\r\nThis same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in\r\ndetermining the admissibility of evidence.&nbsp; Wilson,&nbsp;345 S.C. at\r\n6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.&nbsp; On review, we are limited to determining whether the\r\ntrial judge abused his discretion.&nbsp; See State v. Rochester,\r\n301 S.C. 196, 200, 391 S.E.2d 244, 247 (1990).&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPorter argues the trial court erred\r\nin admitting Nilesâ€™ testimony regarding the statements and Yarboroughâ€™s\r\ntestimony about his meetings with Niles.&nbsp; Porter contends Niles was acting\r\nas a government agent at the time he elicited incriminating statements from\r\nPorter, violating Porterâ€™s right to counsel.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nAlthough we question whether Porter\r\nadequately preserved this issue for appeal, Porterâ€™s conviction is otherwise\r\naffirmable.&nbsp; See State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393,\r\n440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (stating a contemporaneous objection is necessary to\r\npreserve an issue for appellate review).&nbsp;\r\nThe Sixth Amendment right to counsel\r\napplies to communications between an accused and agents of the government\r\ndeliberately eliciting incriminating statements.&nbsp; U.S. Const. amend.

United States, 377 U.S. 201, 206 (1964).&nbsp; In United States v.\r\nHenry, the court found three factors relevant in determining whether a\r\nfellow inmate was an agent of the government, deliberately eliciting\r\nincriminating statements:&nbsp; 1) whether the informant was acting as an\r\ninformant for the government; 2) whether the informant was ostensibly no more\r\nthan a fellow inmate; and 3) whether the accused was in custody at the\r\ntime.&nbsp; 447 U.S. 264, 270 (1980).\r\nIn Henry, the government paid\r\nan accusedâ€™s fellow inmate to obtain incriminating statements about a\r\ncrime.&nbsp; Id. at 266.&nbsp; The inmate was allegedly told to be alert\r\nto any statements made by Henry but not to initiate conversation or question\r\nHenry regarding the crime.&nbsp; Id. at 268.&nbsp; The court in Henry\r\nnonetheless held that intentionally creating a situation likely to induce an\r\naccused to make incriminating statements without the assistance of counsel was\r\nsufficient to constitute a violation of the accusedâ€™s right to counsel.&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 274.&nbsp;\r\nIn this case, we need not determine\r\nwhether Porterâ€™s right to counsel was violated regarding admission of the\r\nsecond statement because we find the admission of the first statement, which was\r\nmade prior to any contact between Niles and Yarborough, did not violate Porterâ€™s\r\nright to counsel, and admission of the second statement was cumulative to the\r\nfirst statement.&nbsp; At the time Porter made his first statement, Niles was\r\nnot acting as a government agent.&nbsp; The information Niles related to\r\nYarborough regarding Porterâ€™s first statement was not gleaned in contravention\r\nof Porterâ€™s right to counsel.&nbsp; Niles merely heard Porterâ€™s statements\r\nand opportunistically reported them to the officer investigating Porterâ€™s\r\ncase.&nbsp;\r\nAssuming, without so finding, that\r\nNiles was acting as a government agent and deliberately elicited the second\r\nstatement from Porter, we find no error in its admission.&nbsp; The admission of\r\nimproper evidence is harmless where it is cumulative to other evidence.&nbsp; State\r\nv. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 635, 541 S.E.2d 833, 836 (2001).&nbsp; Evidence\r\nconcerning Porterâ€™s second statement was merely cumulative to Nilesâ€™\r\ntestimony regarding the first statement.&nbsp; Therefore, the decision of the\r\ntrial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.&nbsp;\r\nANDERSON, STILWELL, and WILLIAMS,\r\nJJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We decide this case\r\nwithout oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-458","title":"State v.

Rutledge Martin, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Barbara R.\r\n        Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Willie\r\nWeaver appeals his conviction for possession of crack cocaine, arguing the trial\r\ncourt erred in failing to suppress evidence found during the search of his\r\nperson.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 3, 2002, Aiken Public\r\nSafety officer Brad Terry, while on patrol of an area known for drugs, observed\r\nWeaver standing in a roadway holding a beer can.&nbsp; Officer Terry watched\r\nWeaver dispose of the beer can.&nbsp; As Weaver placed the can in the trash,\r\nOfficer Terry noticed a â€œshiny metal objectâ€ in Weaverâ€™s right hand and\r\nthat Weaver placed his right hand, along with the object, in his pocket.&nbsp;\r\nWeaver proceeded to join three other men at a neighborhood â€œgrocery store.â€ [1]&nbsp;\r\nOfficer Terry stopped his patrol\r\ncar, exited the vehicle, and approached Weaver and the other men to inform\r\nWeaver a city ordinance prohibited drinking beer on the street.&nbsp; Officer\r\nTerry also asked the men â€œif anybody had any dope,â€ to which Weaver replied\r\nâ€œno just beer.â€&nbsp; Officer Terry told the men to remain at the â€œgrocery\r\nstoreâ€ and â€œeverything would be cool.â€&nbsp; Officer Terry testified he\r\nnoticed Weaverâ€™s hand remained in his pocket throughout the conversation,\r\nwhich appeared â€œunnaturalâ€ to Officer Terry.\r\nOfficer Terry told Weaver to remove\r\nhis hand from his pocket.&nbsp; Weaver failed to comply with the request.&nbsp;\r\nOfficer Terry repeated the request â€œmore than one time,â€ but Weaver failed\r\nto comply.&nbsp; Officer Terry then called for backup because he â€œbegan to\r\nfear that it may be some type of a weapon.â€&nbsp; After calling for backup,\r\nOfficer Terry retrieved his weapon and ordered Weaver to remove his right hand\r\nfrom his pocket.&nbsp; Weaver complied with Officer Terryâ€™s request and\r\nremoved his hand from his pocket, but Weaver was no longer holding the â€œshiny\r\nmetal objectâ€ Officer Terry had seen earlier.&nbsp;\r\nOfficer Terry then informed Weaver\r\nhe was under arrest for failing to comply with a lawful order of a police\r\nofficer.[2]&nbsp; After handcuffing\r\nWeaver, Officer Terry performed a search of Weaverâ€™s right pocket.&nbsp; A set\r\nof keys, a bottle opener, and .21 grams of crack cocaine fell out of Weaverâ€™s\r\npocket as a result of the search.&nbsp; Officer Terry charged Weaver with\r\npossession of crack cocaine, failure to comply with a lawful order, and\r\ndisorderly conduct.&nbsp;\r\nAt trial, Weaver moved to suppress\r\nthe evidence seized from the search.&nbsp; Weaver argued he had no duty to\r\ncomply with Officer Terryâ€™s request to remove his hand from his pocket,\r\ntherefore, rendering his arrest and subsequent search incident to that arrest\r\nunlawful.&nbsp; Additionally, Weaver claimed Officer Terry did not articulate\r\nany reasonable suspicion that Weaver was armed other than the presence of a\r\nshiny metal object in his hand.&nbsp; As a final ground for his motion, Weaver\r\nasserted Officer Weaver did not have probable cause to arrest him for drinking\r\nin public because the only evidence presented was that Weaver had in his\r\npossession a beer can.&nbsp; Based on these three grounds, Weaver contended the\r\nevidence obtained relating to possession of crack cocaine should be\r\nsuppressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe trial court denied the motion to\r\nsuppress, ruling Officer Terry had a reasonable suspicion that a crime was afoot\r\nbecause Weaver was seen holding a beer can and walked away when he saw Officer\r\nTerry.&nbsp; Moreover, the trial court held probable cause existed to arrest\r\nWeaver for failure to obey a lawful order and drinking in a public place.&nbsp;\r\nThe jury convicted Weaver of\r\npossession of crack cocaine.&nbsp; The trial court sentenced Weaver to eighteen\r\nmonths imprisonment, suspended to time served of forty-two days, and two years\r\nprobation.&nbsp; This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate\r\ncourt sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of\r\nthe trial court unless clearly erroneous.&nbsp; State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829\r\n(2001).&nbsp; The trial courtâ€™s factual findings on whether evidence should be\r\nsuppressed due to a Fourth Amendment violation are reviewed only for clear\r\nerror.&nbsp; State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 666\r\n(2000).&nbsp; â€œOn appeal from a suppression hearing, this court is bound by\r\nthe circuit courtâ€™s factual findings if any evidence supports the findings.â€\r\nState v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 349, 592 S.E.2d 344, 347 (Ct. App.\r\n2004), cert. denied (Nov. 19, 2004).&nbsp; â€œIn an appeal from a motion\r\nto suppress evidence based on Fourth Amendment grounds, an appellate court may\r\nconduct its own review of the record to determine whether the evidence supports\r\nthe circuit courtâ€™s decision.â€ Abdullah, 357 S.C. at 349-50, 592\r\nS.E.2d at 347; State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500-01\r\n(Ct. App. 2003) (holding appellate review of Fourth Amendment search and seizure\r\ncases is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s\r\nfindings).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWeaver alleges the trial court erred\r\nin failing to suppress the evidence of crack cocaine.&nbsp; He argues the search\r\nwas an illegal, warrantless search that was not authorized by any exception to\r\nthe Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.&nbsp; Specifically, Weaver asserts he\r\nwas not required to comply with Officer Terryâ€™s request to remove his hand\r\nfrom his pocket because his actions could not have been construed as rising to\r\nthe level of reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot.&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, he contends any evidence obtained as a result of the search should\r\nhave been excluded.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United\r\nStates Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to be secure from\r\nunreasonable searches and seizures; however, an officer may make an\r\ninvestigatory stop if the officer has a reasonable articulable suspicion based\r\non objective facts that the person is engaged in criminal activity.&nbsp; Terry\r\nv. Ohio, 392 U.S.   1, 30 (1968).\r\nâ€œGenerally, a warrantless search\r\nis per se unreasonable and thus violative of the Fourth Amendmentâ€™s\r\nprohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.â€ State v. Bultron,\r\n318 S.C. 323, 331, 457 S.E.2d 616, 621 (Ct. App. 1995).&nbsp; â€œHowever, a\r\nwarrantless search will withstand constitutional scrutiny where the search falls\r\nwithin one of a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions to\r\nthe Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.â€ Id.\r\nat 331-32, 457 S.E.2d at 621.&nbsp; These exceptions include:&nbsp; (1) search\r\nincident to a lawful arrest;&nbsp; (2) â€œhot pursuit;â€&nbsp; (3) stop and\r\nfrisk;&nbsp; (4) automobile exception;&nbsp; (5) â€œplain viewâ€\r\ndoctrine;&nbsp; (6) consent; and (7) abandonment.&nbsp; State v. Dupree,\r\n319 S.C. 454, 456-57, 462 S.E.2d 279, 281 (1995).&nbsp; â€œ[P]robable cause for\r\na warrantless arrest generally exists â€˜where the facts and circumstances\r\nwithin the arresting officerâ€™s knowledge are sufficient for a reasonable\r\nperson to believe that a crime has been or is being committed by the person to\r\nbe arrested.â€™â€&nbsp; State v. Moultrie, 316 S.C. 547, 552, 451 S.E.2d\r\n34, 37 (Ct. App. 1994) (quoting United States v. Miller, 925 F.2d 695,\r\n698 (4th Cir. 1991)).&nbsp;\r\nA search may be conducted incident\r\nto an arrest â€œonly if it is substantially contemporaneous with the arrest and\r\nis confined to the immediate vicinity of the arrest.â€&nbsp; Shipley v.\r\nCalifornia, 395 U.S. 818, 819 (1969); State v. Brown, 289 S.C. 581,\r\n587, 347 S.E.2d 882, 885 (1986).&nbsp; In Chimel v. California, 395 U.S.\r\n752 (1969), the United States Supreme Court established search incident to\r\narrest and stated:\r\n\r\n  When an arrest is made, it is\r\n  reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to\r\n  remove any weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest\r\n  or effect his escape. Otherwise, the officerâ€™s safety might well be\r\n  endangered, and the arrest itself frustrated. In addition, it is entirely\r\n  reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on\r\n  the arresteeâ€™s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction.\r\n  And the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or\r\n  evidentiary items must, of course, be governed by a like rule.\r\n\r\nId. at 762-63.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn Nesbit v. Commonwealth,\r\n424 S.E.2d 239 (Va. Ct. App. 1992), the Virginia Court of Appeals addressed a\r\nfactually analogous situation.&nbsp; In Nesbit, a police officer, on\r\npatrol in a high crime area, observed the defendant drinking a beer in a public\r\nplace in violation of a city ordinance.&nbsp; Id. at 239.&nbsp; The\r\nofficer stopped Nesbit intending to charge him with a violation of the\r\nordinance.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; However, before a citation could be issued,\r\nthe officer noticed the defendant kept his hand in his right pantsâ€™ pocket,\r\nand suspected the defendant might have a weapon.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; When the\r\nofficer asked the defendant to remove his hand from his pocket, the defendant\r\nrefused.&nbsp; Id. at 239-40.&nbsp; After a brief struggle, a pill bottle\r\ncontaining crack cocaine fell onto the roadway.&nbsp; Id. at 240.&nbsp;\r\nThe officer placed Nesbit under arrest, charging him with possession with intent\r\nto sell cocaine and obstructing justice.&nbsp; Id. at 239.&nbsp; Nesbit\r\nwas never charged with the original violation of drinking in public.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nNesbit appealed his convictions for\r\npossession with intent to sell cocaine and obstructing justice.&nbsp; As one of\r\nhis grounds for appeal, Nesbit asserted the police officer lacked authority to\r\nempty his pockets or, in the alternative, lacked authority to conduct a limited\r\npat-down search for weapons.&nbsp; The Virginia Court of Appeals affirmed the\r\ntrial courtâ€™s denial of Nesbitâ€™s motion to suppress, holding the officerâ€™s\r\nactions â€œwere justified and involved no unlawful seizure as alleged by\r\nappellant.â€&nbsp; Id. at 240.&nbsp; In reaching this conclusion, the\r\ncourt reasoned that the officer encountered appellant in a high-crime area,\r\nappellant declined to remove his hand from his pocket where a weapon could have\r\nbeen hidden, and appellant struggled with the officer and attempted to\r\nflee.&nbsp; Id.\r\nIn the instant case, Weaver argues\r\nthe search of his pocket was unlawful because Officer Terry had no reasonable\r\nsuspicion to detain him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We agree with the trial courtâ€™s\r\nfinding that Weaverâ€™s actions provided Officer Terry with reasonable suspicion\r\nthat a crime was afoot in that Weaver was in violation of the municipal\r\nordinance prohibiting public drinking.&nbsp; Officer Terry personally observed\r\nWeaver standing in the road holding a can of beer, which he disposed of when he\r\nsaw Officer Terry.&nbsp; At that point, Officer Terry was justified in making an\r\ninvestigatory stop of Weaver and had the authority to order Weaver to show his\r\nhands.&nbsp; When Weaver failed to comply with the lawful order, Officer Terry\r\nhad sufficient probable cause to place him under arrest.[3]&nbsp; As a result, Officer Terryâ€™s search of\r\nWeaverâ€™s pocket was a lawful search incident to arrest.&nbsp; Accordingly, we\r\nhold the trial court did not err in denying Weaverâ€™s motion to suppress\r\nevidence obtained as a result of that search.[4]&nbsp; See State v. Trane, 57 P.3d 1052, 1062 (Utah\r\n2002)(holding trial court properly denied defendantâ€™s motion to suppress\r\ncocaine found on defendantâ€™s person during a search incident to a lawful,\r\nwarrantless arrest where defendant refused to comply with officerâ€™s order to\r\nsubmit to frisk after officer found defendant to be intoxicated in public and\r\ndisturbing the peace).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons,\r\nWeaverâ€™s conviction and sentence for possession of crack cocaine are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY and SHORT, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] The â€œgrocery storeâ€ apparently was also the residence of one\r\nof the men.&nbsp;\r\n[2] Aiken Municipal Code section 22-3(b) provides â€œit shall be\r\nunlawful for any person to wilfully fail or refuse to comply with a lawful order\r\nor direction of a city public safety officer, while such officer is about the\r\nduties of his office within the city or upon properties owned by the city.â€\r\n[3]&nbsp; We note, however, that had Officer Terry lacked the\r\nreasonable suspicion to stop and detain Weaver initially, Weaverâ€™s failure to\r\ncomply with the order to remove his hand from his pocket would neither have\r\ngiven Officer Terry the requisite probable cause to arrest Weaver nor authority\r\nto conduct a valid search incident to arrest.&nbsp; Cf. United States\r\nv. Burton, 228 F.3d 524, 526 (4th Cir. 2000) (vacating federal conviction\r\nfor possession of a firearm by a felon based on courtâ€™s conclusion that â€œofficerâ€™s\r\nsearch was not supported by a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and\r\ntherefore constituted an illegal searchâ€ where defendant did not exhibit\r\nevasive or suspicious behavior and there was no indication that he was engaging\r\nin any illegal activity at the time he was approached and questioned by the\r\narresting officer).\r\n[4] Although the Aiken ordinance authorizing an arrest for failure to\r\ncomply with an officerâ€™s lawful order appears to be overbroad and vague, this\r\nalone is not dispositive of the issue on appeal.&nbsp; Weaverâ€™s appellate\r\ncounsel did not challenge the validity of the ordinance in his brief.&nbsp;\r\nFurthermore, even assuming arguendo that the ordinance is unconstitutional, it\r\nwould not change the outcome of our decision.&nbsp; See Michigan v.\r\nDeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 40 (1979) (holding, in case involving possession of\r\na controlled substance, evidence should not have been suppressed where it was\r\nobtained after a search incident to an arrest in reliance on a municipal\r\nordinance even if the ordinance had been subsequently declared\r\nunconstitutional).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-459","title":"Seabrook v.

Eberle, Melissa F.\r\n        Brown, of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\n        Robert Papa, of Charleston,\r\n        and Stephen Paul Bucher, of North\r\n        Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; In this\r\ndomestic action, Guy Simmons appeals the family courtâ€™s determination that he\r\nand Mary Seabrook were married at common law.&nbsp; Simmons argues the family\r\ncourt erred in: (1) finding the parties were married at common law; and (2)\r\nfailing to find judicial estoppel precludes Seabrook from claiming the parties\r\nwere married at common law.&nbsp; We affirm.[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFACTS\r\nGuy Simmons and Mary Seabrook had an\r\non-and-off relationship beginning in 1966 in the Charleston, South Carolina area.&nbsp; After an initial break-up with Simmons,\r\nSeabrook married Harold Seabrook.&nbsp; In 1969, Seabrook left Harold, and she\r\nand her three children from prior relationships moved in with her cousin.&nbsp;\r\nSeabrook and Simmons rekindled their relationship and began residing together\r\nthat same year.&nbsp; The parties moved to an apartment on Norman\r\nStreet.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, the parties had an argument and Simmons left\r\nthe apartment for a brief period; however, he returned to the Norman Street\r\napartment in 1971, the same year that Seabrookâ€™s divorce from Harold was\r\nfinalized.&nbsp; Although the Norman Street apartment was crowded, as\r\nSeabrook had relatives staying there, Simmons and Seabrook shared a\r\nbedroom.&nbsp;\r\nIn 1972, while the couple resided at\r\nthe Norman Street apartment, the\r\ncoupleâ€™s first child, Guydetra, was born.&nbsp; Around that time, Simmons\r\npurchased a home at 26 Addlestone to which he moved his mother and\r\nsiblings.&nbsp; Simmons received mail at the Addlestone address but remained\r\nliving with Seabrook in the Norman Street apartment.&nbsp; In January 1974, the coupleâ€™s second\r\nchild, Mark, was born.&nbsp;\r\nSimmons and Seabrook, along with the\r\ntwo children, moved to a new apartment on Fludd\r\nStreet when Guydetra was in the second grade.&nbsp; The couple moved again to a\r\nhome Simmons purchased on Endo Drive three years later.&nbsp; This was the coupleâ€™s primary\r\nresidence until the couple separated in 1999.&nbsp; Seabrook still resides at\r\nthe Endo Drive\r\nhome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn the summer of 1998, Seabrook\r\nfiled for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.&nbsp; Seabrook\r\nindicated she was divorced in the filings.&nbsp; In January 2000, Seabrook filed\r\nfor divorce from her common law marriage to Simmons.&nbsp; Simmons answered\r\ndenying a common law marriage existed, and he argued judicial estoppel barred\r\nSeabrook from alleging a common law marriage due to her assertion in her\r\nbankruptcy filings.&nbsp;\r\nA hearing was held in family court\r\nto determine whether a common law marriage existed.&nbsp; Simmons testified that\r\nhe never resided with Seabrook or considered her his wife, and he presented\r\ntestimony from witnesses to that effect.&nbsp; Numerous witnesses, including\r\nSeabrook and the partiesâ€™ two children, testified that Simmons resided at the Endo\r\nStreet house with Seabrook and the children for nearly thirty years, that\r\nSimmons maintained his clothes and the safe containing his cash there, that\r\nSeabrook introduced Simmons as her husband, and that the parties sometimes\r\nreferred to each other as husband and wife.&nbsp; When Seabrookâ€™s daughter\r\nfrom a prior relationship had a family court hearing, Simmons provided an\r\naffidavit in which he identified himself as her step-father and claimed that he\r\nhad lived with her and Seabrook for more than twenty-six years.&nbsp; Simmons\r\ndirected Seabrook to pay all of his bills by signing his name on checks from his\r\nbank accounts.&nbsp; Seabrook identified Simmons as her husband or common law\r\nhusband and beneficiary on life insurance applications in 1994 and 1995.&nbsp;\r\nAlthough Simmons indicated that he was single in an insurance application in\r\n1986, he identified Seabrook as his spouse and beneficiary on an insurance\r\napplication in 1987.&nbsp; Simmons also applied in 1986 to change his life\r\ninsurance policy to add a spouse rider, and Seabrook signed the application as\r\nâ€œMary G.S. Simmons.â€&nbsp; Further, Seabrook was identified as the â€œdaughter-in-lawâ€\r\nand representative payee for the supplemental security income for Simmonsâ€™\r\nmother, Anna Hart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAfter the hearing, the family court\r\nfound a valid common law marriage existed and found the doctrine of judicial\r\nestoppel to be inapplicable in the case.&nbsp; The family court denied Simmonsâ€™\r\nmotion to alter or amend the judgment.&nbsp; This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court,\r\nthe appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its\r\nview of the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp; Rutherford\r\nv. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992); Owens v.\r\nOwens, 320 S.C. 543, 546, 466 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App. 1996).&nbsp; This\r\nbroad scope of review does not, however, require the appellate court to\r\ndisregard the findings of the family court.&nbsp; Stevenson v. Stevenson,\r\n276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).&nbsp; Neither is the court\r\nrequired to ignore the fact the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses,\r\nwas in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative\r\nweight to their testimony.&nbsp; Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525,\r\n280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).[2]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSimmons argues the family court\r\nerred in finding he and Seabrook were married at common law.&nbsp; First,\r\nSimmons contends the evidence does not support the family courtâ€™s finding of a\r\nvalid common law marriage. Second, Simmons alleges the family court erred in\r\nfailing to find judicial estoppel precluded Seabrook from claiming the parties\r\nwere married at common law.&nbsp; We find both of Simmonsâ€™ arguments to be\r\nwithout merit.\r\nI.&nbsp; Common Law Marriage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSimmons contends the evidence does\r\nnot support the family courtâ€™s finding of a valid common law marriage.&nbsp;\r\nWe disagree.\r\nA party moving for a determination\r\nof a common law marriage has the burden of proving the existence of a common law\r\nmarriage by the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp; Barker v. Baker, 330\r\nS.C. 361, 369, 499 S.E.2d 503, 507 (Ct. App. 1998).&nbsp; In South\r\nCarolina, a strong but rebuttable presumption exists â€œin favor of marriage by\r\ncohabitation, apparently matrimonial, coupled with social acceptance over a long\r\nperiod of time.â€&nbsp; Id. at\r\n367, 499 S.E.2d at 507.&nbsp;\r\nA â€œcommon lawâ€ marriage is\r\nformed when a man and woman exhibit a present intent to enter into a marriage\r\ncontract.&nbsp; Tarnowski v. Lieberman, 348 S.C. 616, 619, 560 S.E.2d\r\n438, 440 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; â€œIt is essential to a common law marriage that\r\nthere shall be a mutual agreement between the parties to assume toward each\r\nother the relation of husband and wife.â€&nbsp; Johnson v. Johnson, 235\r\nS.C. 542, 550, 112 S.E.2d 647, 651 (1960).&nbsp; Because it is often difficult\r\nto ascertain direct evidence of the partiesâ€™ mutual intent where there is no\r\npublic declaration of the contract of marriage, â€œthe existence of a common-law\r\nmarriage frequently is proved by circumstantial evidence.â€&nbsp; Barker,\r\n330 S.C. at 368, 499 S.E.2d at 507.&nbsp; Circumstantial evidence of a common\r\nlaw marriage includes where the parties have cohabitated for a period of time\r\nand where the parties have â€œheld themselves out as husband and wife.â€&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence\r\npresented in this case supports the family courtâ€™s determination that a valid\r\ncommon law marriage existed between Seabrook and Simmons.&nbsp; The family court\r\nsaw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their\r\ncredibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.&nbsp; We find no\r\nreason to disregard the findings of the family court.&nbsp; The evidence clearly\r\nestablishes that after Seabrookâ€™s 1971 divorce from Harold, the parties\r\nintended to be married, held themselves out as married, cohabitated together for\r\na substantial period of time, and had two children.&nbsp; Thus, under the\r\npreponderance of the evidence standard and under the more lenient any evidence\r\nstandard, there was evidence to support the family courtâ€™s finding of a common\r\nlaw marriage.\r\nII.&nbsp; Judicial Estoppel\r\nSimmons alleges the family court\r\nerred in failing to find judicial estoppel precluded Seabrook from claiming the\r\nparties were married at common law.&nbsp; Specifically, Simmons argues the\r\nassertion Seabrook made in her bankruptcy filings that she was divorced\r\nprecluded her from arguing the parties were married at common law.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.&nbsp;\r\nJudicial estoppel is an equitable\r\nconcept that prevents a litigant from asserting a position inconsistent with, or\r\nin conflict with, one the litigant has previously asserted in the same or a\r\nrelated proceeding.&nbsp; Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C.\r\n242, 251, 489 S.E.2d 472, 477 (1997).&nbsp; Judicial estoppel is limited to\r\ninconsistent statements of fact.&nbsp; Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, 353\r\nS.C. 31, 42, 577 S.E.2d 202, 208 (2003).&nbsp; The application of judicial\r\nestoppel is discretionary and must be determined according to the facts of each\r\nindividual case.&nbsp; Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 83, 552 S.E.2d\r\n767, 772 (Ct. App. 2001).&nbsp; The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure the\r\nintegrity of the judicial process and to prevent manipulation of the judicial\r\nsystem by the litigants.&nbsp; Quinn v. Sharon Corp., 343 S.C. 411, 414,\r\n540 S.E.2d 474, 475 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nOur state supreme court has\r\ndelineated the following necessary elements for the doctrine of judicial\r\nestoppel to apply:\r\n\r\n  (1) two inconsistent positions\r\n  taken by the same party or parties in privity with one another; (2) the\r\n  positions must be taken in the same or related proceedings involving the same\r\n  party or parties in privity with each other; (3) the party taking the position\r\n  must have been successful in maintaining that position and have received some\r\n  benefit; (4) the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to\r\n  mislead the court; and (5) the two positions must be totally\r\n  inconsistent.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nCothran v. Brown, 357 S.C.\r\n210, 215-16, 592 S.E.2d 629, 632 (2004).\r\nIn the late 1990s, the relationship\r\nbetween Seabrook and Simmons deteriorated, and Simmons spent a substantial\r\namount of time away from the home.&nbsp; Seabrook began experiencing financial\r\ndifficulties, and she testified that she consulted Simmons about whether she\r\nshould file for bankruptcy.&nbsp; According to Seabrook, Simmons told her that\r\nhe did not have to file any documents along with her bankruptcy application\r\nbecause their finances were separate and they were â€œcommon law divorced.â€&nbsp;\r\nSeabrook testified that because she did not know any better, she then put her\r\nstatus as â€œdivorcedâ€ on her bankruptcy filings.&nbsp; Simmons testified that\r\nbecause his finances were separate from Seabrookâ€™s, her filing bankruptcy did\r\nnot affect him in any way.&nbsp;\r\nCharles Summerall testified\r\nregarding bankruptcy filings.&nbsp; Sumerall stated that if Seabrook was married\r\nat the time she filed for bankruptcy, the law required her to fill out the\r\nsection indicating the income and assets of her spouse so that the bankruptcy\r\ncourt could determine her disposable income available for repaying\r\ncreditors.&nbsp; However, Nathan Davis, an attorney who primarily practiced\r\nbankruptcy law, testified that Seabrook was required to list Simmonsâ€™ income\r\nand assets only if he provided a â€œwealth of incomeâ€ for her support.&nbsp;\r\nHe also noted that since Simmons was not a creditor of Seabrookâ€™s, her\r\ndischarge of all but five percent of her debt had no impact on him.&nbsp;\r\nIn ruling on the judicial estoppel\r\nissue, the family court found that Simmons was not affected in any way by the\r\npayment or discharge of Seabrookâ€™s debts and that Simmons and Seabrook were\r\nnot â€œin privity in any way with regard to the bankruptcy and this domestic\r\ncase.â€&nbsp; The court noted that the partiesâ€™ relationship had\r\nsubstantially deteriorated when Seabrook filed the bankruptcy case, and Seabrook\r\nâ€œdid not understand the legalities of common law marriage nor of how a common\r\nlaw marriage ended.â€&nbsp; Thus, the court held that Seabrook did not â€œmaliciously\r\nor intentionally mislead the bankruptcy court in her filing.â€&nbsp; The court\r\ndenied Simmonsâ€™ motion to dismiss based upon judicial estoppel.&nbsp;\r\nThe evidence in the record supports\r\nthe family courtâ€™s findings.&nbsp; Seabrook testified that she believed\r\nSimmons when he told her that they were â€œcommon law divorced.â€&nbsp; There\r\nwas no evidence that Seabrook intentionally misled the bankruptcy court when she\r\nacted under her erroneous assumption.&nbsp; Moreover, the bankruptcy action was\r\nnot related to the divorce action.&nbsp; Further, we give greater weight to the\r\nfamily courtâ€™s findings as it viewed the witnesses and was able to judge their\r\ncredibility.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find the family court did not err in denying\r\nSimmonsâ€™ motion to dismiss based upon judicial estoppel.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the family court correctly\r\nfound judicial estoppel does not preclude Seabrook from claiming the parties\r\nwere married at common law.&nbsp; Moreover, reviewing the finding of a common\r\nlaw marriage under either the preponderance of the evidence or the any evidence\r\nstandard of review, the evidence in this record clearly supports a finding the\r\nparties were married at common law.&nbsp; Therefore, the order of the family\r\ncourt is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY and SHORT, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the\r\nissues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule\r\n215, SCACR.&nbsp;\r\n[2]&nbsp; There is some question regarding the standard of review in\r\ncommon law marriage cases.&nbsp; Although the line of cases from family court\r\napply the traditional family court preponderance of the evidence standard of\r\nreview, a line of cases from probate court apply the legal any evidence\r\nstandard.&nbsp; See Barker v. Baker, 330 S.C. 361, 370, 499 S.E.2d\r\n503, 508 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding that in an action at law, where the existence\r\nof a common law marriage is a question of fact, the court is bound by the lower\r\ncourtâ€™s factual findings and credibility determinations); Richland Memâ€™l\r\nHosp. v. English, 295 S.C. 511, 513, 369 S.E.2d 395, 396 (Ct. App. 1988)\r\n(holding the issue of common law marriage sounds in law); Weathers v. Bolt,\r\n293 S.C. 486, 488, 361 S.E.2d 773, 774 (Ct. App. 1987) (noting that the review\r\nin the case was limited to a determination of whether or not there was any\r\nevidence to support the findings of the trial judge).&nbsp; Thus, when applying\r\nthe probate court standard of review, we must affirm if any evidence supports\r\nthe lower courtâ€™s findings.&nbsp; Tarnowski v. Lieberman, 348 S.C. 616,\r\n619, 560 S.E.2d 438, 440 (Ct. App. 2002).&nbsp; In the present case, we have\r\napplied the preponderance of the evidence standard.&nbsp; However, we find the\r\nfacts in the record are such that the family court may be affirmed under either\r\nstandard.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-460","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Edgar Lewis Clements, III, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Phillip Woods appeals his convictions for first-degree burglary, assault with intent to commit first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and assault with intent to commit third-degree criminal sexual conduct.Â  He argues the trial court erred in admitting his self-incriminating statements because they were obtained in violation of his Miranda[1] rights.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn August 4, 2001, Woods and Denise Martin were working the 11:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. shift at the Oaks Residential Facility in Timmonsville, South Carolina.Â  Woodsâ€™ duties included monitoring the menâ€™s hallway, and he was not permitted to enter the womenâ€™s hallway.Â  Although it was against regulation, Woods told Denise Martin that he needed to go to his home less than a mile away at 12:30 a.m.Â  When he left, Denise Martin noticed that Woodsâ€™ car was still parked in the facilityâ€™s parking lot.Â  Shortly thereafter, she attempted to take some clean laundry to a female residentâ€™s room.Â  Martin heard strange noises coming from the room, and she attempted to push the door open.Â  Someone wearing latex gloves grabbed the door and closed it.Â  Denise Martin called police, and Officer Karlos Moody arrived around 12:49 a.m.Â  Woods reappeared at work at the same time.Â  \r\nOfficer Moody found the resident lying on the edge of her bed with her underpants pulled down.Â  A greasy substance had been rubbed on her buttocks, and her window was open.[2]Â  The area was searched.Â  Eventually, Woods, who was pacing and nervous while the police performed their duties, accompanied Officer Moody to the police station to provide a written statement.Â  Denise Martin also later went to the police station to provide a statement.Â  In his initial written statement, on a form titled â€œVOLUNTARY STATEMENT (NOT UNDER ARREST),â€ Woods stated that he left the facility after midnight, stayed home until 12:30, and then went back to work.Â  Shortly after Woods provided the written statement, Lieutenant Michael Martin returned from the facility and, with Officer Moody present, advised Woods of his Miranda rights.Â  According to Lieutenant Martin and Officer Moody, Woods understood these rights and Woods signed a written waiver.Â  Woods gave a tape-recorded statement, orally confessing to the incident.Â  He told police he put on latex gloves, entered the residentâ€™s room from the outside, applied butter on the residentâ€™s buttocks, and ultimately decided against raping her.Â  Woods said he was preparing to leave the room when Denise Martin tried to enter. \r\nWoods was arrested and charged with burglary and attempted sexual assault.Â  The grand jury formally charged Woods with burglary in the first-degree, attempted criminal sexual conduct in the first-degree, and attempted criminal sexual conduct in the third-degree.Â  The trial court held a pre-trial hearing to determine the voluntariness of the initial statements as well as the admissibility of the oral, audio-recorded statement.Â  The trial court determined that Woods was not in custody at the time he gave his written statement and, therefore, it was voluntarily given.Â  The court also found that Woods was properly advised of his Miranda rights and that he voluntarily waived those rights at the time he gave his oral, taped statement.Â  Thus, the court found that both the written and oral statements were admissible.Â Â  \r\nThe trial proceeded, and a jury convicted Woods of all three charges.Â  The trial court sentenced Woods to twenty-five years on the burglary charge and concurrent terms of twenty-five years for the attempted criminal sexual conduct in the first-degree and ten years for attempted criminal sexual conduct in the third-degree.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate court sits to review criminal cases for errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  This court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  Our supreme court has stated:\r\n\r\nThis same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases. For instance, in order for a confession to be admissible, the State must prove a voluntary waiver of the defendantâ€™s Miranda rights by a preponderance of the evidence.Â  On review, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  \r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted).Â  \r\nThis court does not take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence; rather, it must determine whether the trial courtâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 5, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  Likewise, the trial courtâ€™s â€œresolution of the issue of voluntariness of a statement will not be disturbed on appeal absent an error of law.â€Â  State v. Creech, 314 S.C. 76, 84, 441 S.E.2d 635, 639 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWoods argues the trial court erred in admitting both his oral and written statements because he had not been advised of his Miranda rights when he gave his written statement and he never waived his Miranda rights when he gave his oral statement.Â  We consider whether Woods properly preserved the issues raised on appeal.Â  \r\nThe appellate court cannot consider issues that are raised for the first time on appeal.Â  State v. Morris, 307 S.C. 480, 485, 415 S.E.2d 819, 822 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  â€œWhere an objection and the ground therefor is not stated in the record, there is no basis for appellate review.â€Â  Id. at 485, 415 S.E.2d at 823.Â  Furthermore, a defendant cannot raise a ground for suppression for the first time on appeal.Â  See State v. Brannon, 347 S.C. 85, 89, 552 S.E.2d 773, 774 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding suppression issue not preserved where appellant failed to join in on his co-defendantâ€™s objection and further failed to raise the suppression issue himself).\r\nIn addition, if the ruling was initially made in an in limine proceeding, an objection must be renewed when the evidence is admitted.Â  State v. Gagum, 328 S.C. 560, 564-65, 492 S.E.2d 822, 824 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Failure to renew the objection precludes appellate review.Â  State v. Wannamaker, 346 S.C. 495, 499, 552 S.E.2d 284, 286 (2001). \r\nAfter the jury was selected in this case, the State moved to have a Jackson v. Denno[3] hearing to determine the admissibility of Woodsâ€™ statements.Â  Both Lieutenant Martin and Officer Moody testified that Woods understood his Miranda rights and the rights he was waiving by giving a statement.Â  Woods did not argue that the statements were taken in violation of his Miranda rights, and he failed to move to suppress the statements.Â  The State later introduced both statements during the trial without objection.Â Â Â  \r\nWoods raises these issues for the first time on appeal.Â  His failure to object to the admissibility of the statements at trial renders the issues not preserved. Â See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003) (holding that an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order for it to be preserved for appellate review).Â  Accordingly, we may not address them.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe issues Woods raises are not properly before this court.Â  Accordingly, Woodsâ€™ convictions and sentences are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Miranda v.

Samuels, of Lexington, for Appellant.\r\nEdward P. Martin, Jr., of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Tracy Lee Whitworth was injured in an automobile accident while he was transporting a large piece of equipment to a jobsite.Â  He filed a claim for workersâ€™ compensation, which the single commissioner and full commission denied.Â Â  The circuit court affirmed the commissionâ€™s denial, and Whitworth appeals, arguing his injury fell within an exception to the â€œgoing and comingâ€ rule.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nWhitworth was employed as a window installer by Window World, Inc.Â  To complete some installations, Whitworth needed to install coil (an aluminum wrap) around the windows, which required the use of a large piece of equipment called a breaker.[1]Â  Whitworth transported the breaker to each jobsite because the coil could not be measured and fabricated at the shop.Â  \r\nWindow World paid Whitworth an extra ten dollars for each window he installed that required a metal break, but did not compensate him for travel time or expenses.Â  The company required installers to have their own trucks and prohibited installers from leaving breakers on the jobsite.Â  \r\nWhitworth was scheduled to install windows at the home of Elaine McLauren on November 22, 2000, but he rescheduled the job to observe Thanksgiving Day with his brother.Â  Whitworth began work on November 25 and worked for two days but was unable to finish the job due to rain.Â  Whitworth planned to return to the McLauren home on November 27, and he needed a breaker to complete the installation.Â Â  Window Worldâ€™s breaker was not available for Whitworthâ€™s use, but the owner of Window World made arrangements with Whitworthâ€™s brother so that Whitworth could use his brotherâ€™s breaker and trailer.Â  While transporting the breaker in the trailer to McLaurenâ€™s home, Whitworth was injured in an automobile accident.Â  He reported the accident the same day. \r\nThe owners of Window World, upon their return from vacation, fired Whitworth for failing to complete the McLauren job before November 27, when he was scheduled to begin another job.Â  Both the McLauren and the other scheduled jobs would have required Whitworth to bring the breaker to the jobsite.Â  Although he had been fired, Whitworth completed the McLauren job after his accident.[2]Â Â  Based on his injuries, Whitworth filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim.\r\nThe single commissioner found that Whitworth failed to prove his accident fell within an exception to the going and coming rule.Â  Based on this finding, the single commissioner concluded that Whitworth did not sustain an injury in the course of his employment and was not entitled to receive workersâ€™ compensation.Â  The full commission affirmed the order of the single commissioner, as did the circuit court.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGenerally, whether a causal connection exists between employment and an injury is a question of fact for the full commission.Â  Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 159, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999) (citation omitted).Â  â€œThe [full commissionâ€™s] decision must be affirmed if the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.â€Â  Id. at 160, 519 S.E.2d at 105.Â  On the other hand, an appellate court may reverse or modify a decision of the full commission if the decision is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 288-89, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610-11 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Substantial evidence is that which, in viewing the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the full commission reached.Â  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 183, 528 S.E.2d 435, 440 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nWhitworth argues that his injuries were compensable because he was charged with a work-related duty when he was injured in the accident.Â  We agree.[3]Â  \r\nGenerally, an employee who is going to or coming from the place the work will be performed is not engaged in performing any service growing out of or incidental to employment, and, therefore, an injury sustained by accident at such a time does not arise out of and in the course of employment.Â Medlin v. Upstate Plaster Service, 329 S.C. 92, 95, 495 S.E.2d 447, 449 (1998) (citing McDaniel v. Bus Terminal Rest. Mgmt. Corp., 271 S.C. 299, 247 S.E.2d 321 (1978)). â€œHowever, South Carolina has recognized a number of exceptions to this rule.Â  Among these are: . . . (2) Where the employee, on his way to or from his work, is still charged with some duty or task in connection with his employment . . . .â€ Medlin, 329 S.C. at 95-96, 495 S.E.2d at 449 (citing Sola v. Sunny Slope Farms, 244 S.C. 6, 135 S.E.2d 321 (1964)).Â  The duty need not be one the employee was expressly hired to perform; rather, it should be consistent with the contract of hire and pertain or be incidental to employment.Â  Wright v. Wright, 306 S.C. 331, 333, 411 S.E.2d 829, 830 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  \r\nThis court has noted that â€œno exact formula can be laid down which will automatically solve every case,â€ but the doctrines and rules of workersâ€™ compensation are â€œbuilt on a common framework designed to compensate employees when their employment proximately causes their injuries.â€Â  Stough v. Westinghouse Savannah River Co., 311 S.C. 129, 131 n.1, 427 S.E.2d 716, 717 n.1 (Ct. App. 1993) (citations omitted) (finding compensable injury even when the case did not â€œfall neatly within the so-called â€˜going to and coming from rule,â€™ the â€˜dual purpose doctrine,â€™ or the â€˜special errand rule.â€™â€).\r\nIn Wright, this court held a situation similar to Whitworthâ€™s fell under exceptions to the going and coming rule. 306 S.C. at 333-34, 411 S.E.2d at 830.Â  Wright involved a self-employed contractor who used his own truck primarily for work and to carry his tools, who was paid per unit installed, and who was not compensated for mileage or hotel expenses.Â  Id. at 332, 411 S.E.2d at 829.Â  The contractor was injured in an accident while commuting from a Charlotte, North Carolina jobsite to his home in Easley, South Carolina.Â  Id. at 333, 411 S.E.2d at 830.Â  Relying on the duty and task exception to the going and coming rule,[4] we found the contractorâ€™s injuries arose while in the course and scope of employment because he â€œwas commuting in his truck which was used primarily for business, was commuting to maximize his profits, and was taking an employee home at the time of the accident.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn this case, Whitworth was required to bring a borrowed breaker to the jobsite.Â  This requirement was a duty or task precipitated by the unavailability of Window Worldâ€™s breaker and the policy of Window World that disallowed leaving breakers at jobsites.Â  Similar to the contractor in Wright, Whitworth was using his truck for work, specifically to bring a special piece of equipment to the jobsite.[5]Â  \r\nBecause Whitworth was charged with a duty or task connected with his employment when he was injured, Whitworthâ€™s situation falls within an exception to the general rule that injuries sustained while going to or coming from work do not arise in the course of a workerâ€™s employment.Â  Therefore, Whitworthâ€™s injuries are compensable, and we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s ruling and remand the case to the full commission for determination of benefits.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] A breaker is approximately ten feet long and weighs about three hundred pounds. \r\n[2] Because of his injuries, Whitworth needed his nephewâ€™s assistance to complete the job.Â  \r\n[3] Because we agree that Whitworthâ€™s injury falls under the â€œduty or taskâ€ exception to the going and coming rule, we decline to address his other arguments.Â  \r\n[4]Â  Our court also ruled in favor of compensation based on the first exception to the going and coming rule, which states: â€œWhere, in going to and returning from work, the means of transportation is provided by the employer, or the time that is consumed is paid for or included in the wages.â€ Medlin, 329 S.C. at 95-96, 495 S.E.2d at 449 (citing Sola v. Sunny Slope Farms, 244 S.C. 6, 135 S.E.2d 321 (1964)).\r\n[5] We note that Whitworthâ€™s duty to transport the breaker to the jobsite is easily distinguished from the situation in Gallman v. Springs Mills, 201 S.C. 257, 22 S.E.2d 715 (1942), where our supreme court found an employee, who was injured while carrying tools on his walk to work, was not still charged with some duty or task.Â  Unlike the handheld tools being transported in Gallman, Whitworth was transporting a large piece of specialized equipment that was absolutely necessary to complete the window installation.Â  Moreover, it was the arrangements made by Whitworthâ€™s boss that allowed Whitworth to borrow the breaker and trailer.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2005-UP-472","title":"Roddey v.

Carlisle Roddeyâ€™s claims for abuse of process, civil conspiracy, and unfair trade practices act violations.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts of this case were set into motion in 1995 when the countyâ€™s landfill permit expired and the State ordered the landfill closed.Â  The county was required by law to develop a plan for the disposal of its solid waste before it could close the landfill.Â  Roddey served as Chester County Manager and Supervisor at this time.Â  The county entered into negotiations with NationsWaste, whereby NationsWaste would acquire the landfill and a large tract of adjoining land to build a new regional landfill, which would meet the requirements of State law.Â  Although a final agreement had not been approved, on May 6, 1996, the county council passed an ordinance authorizing the sale and lease of the landfill pursuant to the final agreement and directing the County Supervisor, the Clerk and other appropriate officials to consummate the transactions covered by the agreement.Â  This ordinance provided it would become effective upon approval of the final agreement.Â  \r\nUltimately, on June 3, 1996, a Letter of Intent was sent from the county to NationsWaste.Â  The letter noted the countyâ€™s desire to continue negotiating the terms of a possible public-private partnership to operate the old landfill and to develop, construct, and operate a regional solid waste disposal site.Â  The Letter of Intent read:Â  â€œThis letter will confirm that . . . Chester County, subject to acceptable terms and conditions, intends to enter into an agreement with NationsWaste . . . to provide for long-term solutions to solid waste issues facing Chester County . . . .â€Â  The letter then set forth many of the salient terms and continued: \r\n\r\nAssuming that all remaining issues are satisfactorily addressed, the County anticipates that the Agreement will be executed within the next few weeks.Â  It is understood, however, that until the Agreement is finalized and executed, neither the County nor NationsWaste will be obligated to perform the terms and conditions outlined herein.\r\n\r\nAfter the Letter of Intent was issued, NationsWaste purchased more than 900 acres of land surrounding the landfill site.Â  Roddey admitted he knew NationsWaste was trying to acquire the land and he told the companyâ€™s representative, â€œIâ€™d been trying to buy 15 acres . . . and I was having a â€“ we were having an awful time with it, but if they could buy it, go do it.â€ Â \r\nAfter the Letter of Intent was sent, Chester County Council voted against the regional landfill agreement with NationsWaste.Â  Immediately after the countyâ€™s vote not to enter into an agreement with NationsWaste, Bill Nelson, principal stockholder of NationsWaste, told Michael Locklair, a past county councilman, that â€œhe would ruin Carlisle Roddey.Â  He would never win another election as long as he lived.â€Â  \r\nOn March 6, 1997, NationsWaste filed a civil action against Chester County and against Roddey, individually, as chairman of the county council, and as county supervisor.Â  This action asserted causes of action for promissory estoppel, quantum meruit, misfeasance, and ultra vires acts.Â  Among other things, the lawsuit accused Roddey of acting for â€œpersonal gain.â€Â  The suit received media attention by the local newspaper.Â  On April 4, 1997, NationsWaste voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit.Â  \r\nAround the same time, County Councilman James Thomas Funderburk, Jr., a supporter of the NationsWaste proposal, made criminal allegations against Roddey to fellow members of county council, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Â  Funderburk alleged Roddey had been involved in fraud related to the landfill bidding process.Â  He also claimed Roddey had been receiving bribes and kickbacks from one of the countyâ€™s vendors.Â  Roddey hired an attorney to defend him against these criminal allegations and incurred attorneyâ€™s fees of $16,861.30.Â  No charges were ever filed against him.Â  \r\nRoddey responded by filing a civil action against NationsWaste and Tom Funderburk alleging causes of action for:Â  1) civil conspiracy, 2) abuse of process, 3) malicious prosecution, 4) defamation or slander per se, 5) unfair trade practices, and 6) tortious interference with prospective economic advantage.Â  \r\nOn the charge of civil conspiracy, the jury found both NationsWaste and Funderburk jointly and severally liable for actual damages of $25,000 and punitive damages of $50,000; found NationsWaste liable for abuse of process for $10,000 in actual damages and $20,000 in punitive damages; found against NationsWaste for Unfair Trade Practices Act violations for $25,000 in actual damages and $50,000 in punitive damages; and, found in NationsWaste favor on the remaining causes of action.[1]Â  On Roddeyâ€™s post-trial motion, the trial court struck the punitive damages awarded under the UTPA cause of action, trebled the actual damages awarded for this action, and awarded Roddey $172,099.75 in attorneyâ€™s fees against NationsWaste under the UTPA.Â  The court denied the motions filed by NationsWaste and Funderburk.Â  NationsWaste appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn considering a directed verdict or a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) motion, the appellate court, like the trial court, is required to view the evidence and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  The motions must be denied when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Id.Â  Neither the trial court nor the appellate court has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony or evidence.Â  Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 308, 566 S.E.2d 529, 532 (2002).\r\nLAW AND DISCUSSION\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfair trade practices act violationsÂ  \r\nNationsWaste argues the trial court erred in denying its motions for directed verdict and JNOV on Roddeyâ€™s claim for an unfair trade practices act violation.Â  We agree.Â \r\n\r\n  Section 39-5-140 of the South Carolina Code provides: \r\n\r\nAny person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice declared unlawful by Â§ 39-5-20 may bring an action individually, but not in a representative capacity, to recover actual damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-140 (1985).\r\nWe question whether Roddey was in fact the appropriate person to bring a claim for violation of the UTPA against NationsWaste.Â  However, as we find Roddeyâ€™s claim fails on other grounds, we need not address this issue.Â Â Â  \r\nSection 39-5-140 only protects a â€œperson who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal.â€Â  Roddey alleged NationsWaste committed an unfair trade practice against him by bringing an unfounded lawsuit.Â  However, as the lawsuit was dismissed before Roddey obtained an attorney and he incurred no legal fees, he did not suffer an â€œascertainable lossâ€ as a result of the lawsuit.Â Â  \r\nInstead, Roddey relies on the attorney fees he paid to defend himself against the criminal investigation as the ascertainable loss that supports this cause of action.Â  The criminal investigation, however, was based on allegations made by Funderburk.Â  Although there is evidence that NationsWaste conspired with Funderburk to ruin Roddey and Funderburk made the allegations in furtherance of that conspiracy, as discussed below, there is no evidence in the record that NationsWaste or any of its employees or agents made any defamatory statements against Roddey as an unfair method of competition â€œin the conduct of any trade or commerceâ€ as prohibited by the UTPA.[2]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20(a) (1985) (â€œUnfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.â€).Â  As Roddey failed to present any evidence that he suffered an ascertainable loss, his claim for violation of the UTPA must fail as a matter of law.Â  \r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abuse of Process \r\nNationsWaste argues there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of abuse of process.Â  We agree.\r\nThe tort of abuse of process â€œprovides a remedy for one damaged by anotherâ€™s perversion of a legal procedure for a purpose not intended by the procedure.â€ Food Lion v. United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Intâ€™l. Union, 351 S.C. 65, 69, 567 S.E.2d 251, 253&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002), cert. dismissed (June 10, 2004).Â  In order to establish a claim for abuse of process, the plaintiff must prove two essential elements:Â  1) an ulterior purpose, and 2) a willful act in the use of the process not proper in the conduct of the proceeding.Â  Id.Â  at 71, 567 S.E.2d at 253.Â  â€œAn allegation of an ulterior purpose or â€˜bad motiveâ€™ standing alone, is insufficient to assert a claim for abuse of process.Â  Id.Â  at 74, 567 S.E.2d at 255.Â  Thus, to establish a claim for abuse of process, the plaintiff must prove not only that the lawsuit was brought for an ulterior purpose, but that willful acts were taken through which the process was misapplied or abused.Â  Id.  \r\nRoddey testified he believed the suit was filed to embarrass him and bring the county back to the negotiation table.Â  Roddey also presented testimony by James Gatson and Henry Strange of NationsWasteâ€™s use of the threat of litigation to intimidate them.Â  In addition, Roddey presented testimony through Michael Locklair, a past county councilman, that NationsWasteâ€™s president, Bill Nelson, had said â€œhe would ruin Carlisle Roddey.â€Â  \r\nAlthough Roddey presented evidence of the first element of abuse of process, an ulterior purpose, he failed to establish any willful acts through which NationsWaste misapplied or abused the judicial process.Â  NationsWaste merely commenced a lawsuit, which it dismissed less than a month later.Â  As Roddey failed to establish this essential element of the tort, his claim for abuse of process fails as a matter of law.Â  See Food Lion, 351 S.C. at 74, 567 S.E.2d at 255 (quoting W. Page Keeton et al. Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts Â§ 121 at 897 (5th ed. 1984)) (â€œâ€˜[E]ven a pure spite motive is not sufficient where process is used only to accomplish the result for which it was created.â€™â€).Â  \r\nFurthermore, Roddey failed to establish he suffered any damages due to NationsWaste commencing the lawsuit against him.Â  As stated above, NationsWaste dismissed the lawsuit before Roddey answered and Roddey did not incur any legal fees in defending the action.Â  Thus, the trial court erred in denying NationsWasteâ€™s motions for directed verdict and JNOV on Roddeyâ€™s claim for abuse of process.Â Â  \r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Civil conspiracy \r\nNationsWaste next argues the trial court erred in denying its motions for directed verdict and JNOV on Roddeyâ€™s claim for civil conspiracy.Â  He asserts Roddeyâ€™s civil conspiracy claim is impermissible because there is insufficient evidence of an agreement to injure him.Â  We disagree.\r\nA civil conspiracy is a combination of two or more parties joined for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and thus causing special damage.Â  Peoples Fed.

Planning Corp., 358 S.C. 460, 470, 596 S.E.2d 51, 56-57 (2004).Â  A conspiracy may be inferred from the very nature of the acts done, the relationship of the parties, the interests of the alleged conspirators, and other circumstances.Â  Id.Â  Importantly, a civil conspiracy is an act, which is by its very nature covert and clandestine and usually not susceptible of proof by direct evidence.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAs stated above, Michael Locklair testified that NationsWasteâ€™s president, Bill Nelson had declared â€œhe would ruin Carlisle Roddey.â€ Even after the negotiations between NationsWaste and Chester County fell through, Nelson stayed in close communications with Funderburk.Â  In a memorandum dated November 26, 1996 to Funderburk, Nelson wrote, â€œI have enclosed a copy of the litigation actions being recommended to us should we be unable to get folks to see the importance of this project.â€Â  NationsWaste subsequently filed its lawsuit against Chester County and Roddey individually.Â  In the lawsuit, NationsWaste alleged:Â  \r\n\r\nIn the alternative, if Defendant Roddey did not act on behalf of Chester County in his failure to negotiate in good faith with NationsWaste and to comply with the requirements of and fulfill the intent of the May 6, 1996 ordinance, Defendant Roddey acted outside the scope of his authority and, upon information and belief, for his personal gain in refusing to pursue in good faith the finalizing of the agreement with\r\nNationsWaste.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nThe allegation that Roddey was acting for his personal gain was echoed in Funderburkâ€™s complaint to SLED about irregularities in the bid proposal for the solid waste services contract for Chester County.Â  Funderburk also filed a complaint with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Roddey had received kickbacks from the Countyâ€™s purchase of cleaning supplies.Â  Neither investigation resulted in any criminal charges against Roddey.Â  \r\nFunderburkâ€™s former wife, Carol Funderburk, testified Nelson and her husband met and or spoke on the telephone nearly every day about Roddey and the landfill.Â  She stated she overheard them discussing â€œgetting rid of Carlisle Roddey.â€Â  She also overheard them discussing the lawsuit and Funderburk declaring the lawsuit would hurt Roddey through bad publicity.Â  She stated Funderburk told her that with NationsWasteâ€™s money they were able to hire people, like lawyers, and â€œdo what they needed to do.â€Â  In addition, she stated she overheard her husband make repeated statements that Roddey was a liar and embezzler.Â  When asked at trial if she believed Funderburk and NationsWaste were working together to get rid of Roddey, she testified, â€œYes, sir, I do.â€Â  \r\nRoddey presented evidence ofÂ  Nelsonâ€™s vow to exact revenge against Roddey.Â  Carol Funderburkâ€™s testimony suggests a concerted action between her husband and NationsWaste to exact that revenge.Â  Because a civil conspiracy is by its nature done secretly and is not susceptible to direct evidence, we believe this circumstantial evidence is sufficient to support the trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant either a directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  \r\nNationsWaste also argues Roddeyâ€™s claim for civil conspiracy fails because Roddey impermissibly uses the same facts to support the civil conspiracy and other causes of action and Roddey failed to establish any special damages.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAs a unique feature of the tort of civil conspiracy, â€œan action for civil conspiracy will not lie if a plaintiff has obtained relief through other avenues.â€Â  Kuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs., 342 S.C. 579, 610, 538 S.E.3d 15, 31 (Ct. App. 2000), cert. dismissed (January 1, 2004).Â  The supreme court explained, â€œWhere the particular acts charged as a conspiracy are the same as those relied on as the tortious act or actionable wrong, plaintiff cannot recover damages for such act or wrong, and recover likewise on the conspiracy to do the act or wrong.â€Â  Todd v. South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 276 S.C. 284, 293, 278 S.E.2d 607, 611 (1981) (quoting 15A C.J.S. Conspiracy Â§ 33, at 718).Â  However, a plaintiff may join as alternate claims as many claims, legal or equitable, as he has against the opposing party, even if the claims are inconsistent.Â  Harper v. Ethridge, 290 S.C. 112, 118, 348 S.E.2d 374, 377 (Ct. App. 1986); See Rule 8(e)(2), SCRCP (â€œA party may set forth two or more statements of a cause of action or defense alternatively or hypothetically . . . regardless of consistency and whether based on legal or on equitable grounds or on both.â€).\r\nRoddeyâ€™s claim for civil conspiracy included evidence of the combined actions of Funderburk and NationsWaste.Â  His inclusion of similar allegations in his other causes of actions does not make his claim for civil conspiracy fail as a matter of law.Â  Furthermore, as we have reversed the juryâ€™s only other verdicts in Roddeyâ€™s favor against NationsWaste for abuse of process and violation of the UTPA, Roddeyâ€™s only relief against NationsWaste is through his claim for civil conspiracy.\r\nAccordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s denial of NationsWasteâ€™s motions for directed verdict and JNOV.Â  \r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damages \r\nNationsWaste also argues the trial court erred in failing to grant a new trial nisi remittitur because Roddey did not prove any damages.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court alone has the power to grant a new trial nisi when it finds the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate or excessive.Â  Oâ€™Neal v. Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 527, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993).Â  The denial of a motion for a new trial nisi is within the trial courtâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  On appeal of the denial of a motion for a new trial nisi, this court will reverse only when the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive requiring the granting of a new trial absolute.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWhen deciding a motion to grant a new trial, the court must look at the testimony and inferences raised in favor of the nonmoving party.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 302-03, 536 S.E.2d 408, 420 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œThe trial court must set aside a verdict only when it is shockingly disproportionate to the injuries suffered and thus indicates that passion, caprice, prejudice, or other considerations not reflected by the evidence affected the amount awarded.â€Â  Id.Â  at 302, 536 S.E.2d at 420.Â  A juryâ€™s determination of damages is entitled to substantial deference by this court.Â  Knoke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t. of Parks, Recreation &amp; Tourism, 324 S.C. 136, 141, 478 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1996).\r\nRoddey presented evidence that due to the conspiracy between NationsWaste and Funderburk he lost his position as county manager and supervisor and his health suffered.Â  In addition, after losing his bid for reelection as county manager and supervisor, Roddey sought employment with the Chester Metropolitan Water and Sewer District as a grant writer.Â  Mike Medlin, the executive director of the water district, testified that Funderburk told him that if Roddey was hired, Funderburk would attack Medlin and the district in the press.Â  Medlin explained these threats were the primary reason he did not hire Roddey.Â  Roddey also presented as evidence of his damages the legal fees he incurred defending himself in the criminal investigation that was commenced based on Funderburkâ€™s allegations.Â  It was within the province of the jury to find that Funderburk made these threats to Medlin and allegations of criminal conduct in furtherance of his conspiracy with NationsWaste to ruin Roddey.Â  We find the evidence supports the juryâ€™s award of $25,000 in actual damages.Â  Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  \r\nNationsWaste also argues the trial court erred in failing to strike the juryâ€™s award of punitive damages.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order to recover punitive damages, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence the defendantâ€™s conduct was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of the plaintiffâ€™s rights.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-33-135 (2005); Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 221, 479 S.E.2d 35, 46 (1996).Â  The trial court should conduct a post-trial review of punitive damages to determine whether the award of punitive damages was proper.Â  Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 111, 406 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991). In conducting such a review the trial court may consider the following factors:\r\n\r\n(1) defendantâ€™s degree of culpability; (2) duration of the conduct; 3) defendantâ€™s awareness or concealment; (4) the existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood the award will deter the defendant or others from like conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; (7) defendantâ€™s ability to pay; and finally, (8) . . .Â  â€œother factorsâ€ deemed appropriate.\r\n\r\nGamble, 305 S.C. at 111-12, 406 S.E.2d at 354.Â  The trial court is not required to make findings of fact for each factor to uphold a punitive damage award.Â  McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys., 321 S.C. 340, 468 S.E.2d 633 (1996).Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. at 306, 536 S.E.2d at 422.Â  The trial judge has considerable discretion regarding the amount of damages both actual or punitive awarded.Â  Id.Â  at 305, 536 S.E.2d at 421.\r\nAs stated above, we find the evidence supports the juryâ€™s finding of a civil conspiracy between NationsWaste and Funderburk to â€œruinâ€ Roddey.Â  We hold Roddey established by clear and convincing evidence that NationsWasteâ€™s acts in engaging in this conspiracy were willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of Roddeyâ€™s rights.Â  Considering the Gamble factors, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to strike the juryâ€™s award of $50,000 in punitive damages.Â  \r\n5.Â  Inadmissible testimony\r\nNationsWaste argues the trial court erred by allowing in the testimony of Carol Funderburk.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nNationsWaste asserts the court erred in admitting this testimony because Funderburk was basing her testimony on a telephone conversation between her husband and Nelson, president of NationsWaste, and she could not hear Nelsonâ€™s side of the conversation.Â  NationsWasteâ€™s argument is contained in three paragraphs that contain no citation to law and little explanation on why this evidence would be inadmissible.Â  Therefore, this issue is deemed abandoned on appeal, because it is argued only in a short, conclusory statement without supporting authority.Â  See Fields v. Melrose Ltd. Partnership, 312 S.C. 102, 106 n.3, 439 S.E.2d 283, 285 n.3 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Motions for mistrial \r\nNationsWaste alleges the court erred by making prejudicial comments and not granting the subsequent motions for a mistrial.Â  We disagree.\r\nA judge has the inherent authority and responsibility to maintain order in the courtroom.Â  State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 317-18, 479 S.E.2d 517, 521 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  A trial court has wide discretion in granting or denying a mistrial, and the trial courtâ€™s discretion will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of a legal error resulting in prejudice to the moving party.Â  Williams v. Riedman, 339 S.C. 251, 283, 529 S.E.2d 28, 44-45 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nThe testimony of Tom Funderburk was filled with difficulties.Â  Repeatedly, Funderburk would continue to talk after an objection was made but before the court had made a ruling.Â  Finally, the court informed him that when an objection was raised he could not speak.Â  Funderburk also repeatedly testified as to hearsay evidence, prompting the court to instruct him on hearsay.Â  In addition, when the trial stopped for the day, the court allowed Funderburkâ€™s counsel to speak to his client before court returned to explain what testimony was and was not permissible.Â  \r\nThe next day, Funderburk continued offering testimony that the court ruled was hearsay.Â  Funderburk also continued to interrupt the court while it considered objections.Â  In one instance, Funderburk disregarded the courtâ€™s decision that testimony was hearsay and replied, â€œIt came out through the F.B.I. anyway.â€Â  When the court instructed the jury to disregard the comments, Funderburk blurted out, â€œLet me say this.Â  Itâ€™s been testified in this courtroom this weekâ€”.â€Â  The court interrupted the witness and stated, \r\n\r\nNo, sir, Mr. Funderburk.Â  You donâ€™t tell anything unless you . . . are responding to a question. . . .This is not a county council meeting.Â  Youâ€™re not talking to the press.Â  Youâ€™re not in the principalâ€™s office.Â  Youâ€™re in a court of law. . . .Â  Youâ€™re going to follow our rules.Â  Is there any part of that you donâ€™t understand?\r\n\r\nThe court then ordered a ten-minute recess.Â  During the time the jury was out, NationsWaste moved for a mistrial.Â  The court expressed its frustration at having its directions repeatedly disregarded, apologized to Funderburk, and then denied the motion.Â  When the jury returned, the court offered a curative instruction, advising the jury they were the sole fact finders and telling them he had apologized to Funderburk.Â  \r\nWe find the trial courtâ€™s curative instruction sufficiently addressed the comments it had made.Â  Based on our examination of the record, we hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying NationsWasteâ€™s motion for mistrial.Â  \r\nNationsWasteâ€™s other motion for mistrial involved the rebuttal testimony of Lowell Spires.Â  Spires worked for the landfill company that has a contract with Chester County.Â  After the defense stated it had no further questions for him, Spires stated, â€œI want somebody to ask me about Clay Young one more time.â€Â  When the court told Spires he would not be able to testify further, Spires stated:Â  â€œIâ€™ll honor the courtâ€™s request.Â  I sure would love to tell the jury what the real deal about Mr. Young was though.â€Â  The court responded: â€œI kind of sort of think they got the real deal on Mr. Young, but thank you very much, Mr. Spires.â€Â  NationsWaste moved for a mistrial because the courtâ€™s comment â€œcast a real question over the credibility of Mr. Young given the context within . . . which the exchange took place.â€Â  \r\nThe court denied the motion and explained the comment â€œwas simply an affirmation of Mr. Youngâ€™s testimony and that [the jury] had heard it.Â  They had heard his testimony and they had their opportunity to assess and apprise him and that I felt that they already understood the real deal on Mr. Young.â€Â  \r\nConsidering our limited standard of review and inability to judge the trial courtâ€™s tone in its remarks, we find no abuse of discretion in the courtâ€™s denial of NationsWasteâ€™s motion for mistrial.Â  \r\n7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s testimony \r\nFinally, NationsWaste argues the trial court erred in refusing to admit testimony from its attorney regarding the basis for the March 1997 civil action. Â We find no reversible error.Â  \r\nThe trial court ruled that NationsWasteâ€™s attorney could not offer any opinion testimony because she was not designated as an expert witness.Â  She was, however, allowed to testify as to factual basis of the lawsuit.Â  She testified that NationsWaste purchased property in order to close the old county landfill properly and establish the Catawba Regional Landfill that it believed the county ordinance authorized it to do.Â  After Chester County failed to enter into the agreement with NationsWaste, it was left with the contaminated land.Â Â  She stated NationsWaste requested she file the lawsuit because it had no other recourse to recoup the money it had spent on acquiring the land and on the project.Â  She stated NationsWaste only wanted to be made whole and she was only trying to accomplish this wish by drafting the lawsuit.Â  She denied NationsWaste told her of any reason for filing the lawsuit other than to recover the money spent for the property and on the project.Â  She testified she named Roddey individually as an alternative theory of liability in the event Chester County argued that it had not authorized him to enter into the agreement with NationsWaste.Â  She explained that in alleging Roddey was acting for personal gain in refusing to finalize the agreement, she was referring to Roddeyâ€™s shifting position for his political reelection.Â  She denied that the lawsuit was an attempt to intimidate Roddey and stated the lawsuit was meant to get NationsWasteâ€™s money back.Â  \r\nThe attorney testified she relied on the letter of intent in making her decision to file the suit against Chester County and Roddey individually.Â  She asseverated that in filing the lawsuit, she complied with Rule 11, SCRCP, which she explained required her to assure herself there was a meritorious basis for the claim.Â Â  \r\nConsidering the attorneyâ€™s entire testimony, we find she was in fact able to testify about the factual basis of the lawsuit, including her own view as to the merits of the suit.Â  Thus, we conclude NationsWaste was not prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s exclusion of evidence.Â  Accordingly, we find no reversible error in the trial courtâ€™s rulings concerning her testimony.Â  See Otis Elevator, Inc. v. Hardin Const. Co. Group, 316 S.C. 292, 299, 450 S.E.2d 41, 45 (1994) (absent a showing of prejudice, an appellate court will not reverse for an alleged error in the exclusion of evidence). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe verdict against NationsWaste on Roddeyâ€™s UTPA cause of action and the trial courtâ€™s award of treble damages and attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to the Act are REVERSED.Â  The verdict against NationsWaste on Roddeyâ€™s claim for abuse of process is also REVERSED.Â  The verdict and damages awarded on Roddeyâ€™s claim for civil conspiracy are AFFIRMED.[3]Â  \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] The jury also found in Roddeyâ€™s favor against Funderburk on the claims of malicious prosecution awarding $16,861.30 in damages, defamation/slander per se, awarding $25,000 in damages, tortuous interference with prospective economic advantage, awarding $12,000.Â  Funderburk is not a party to this appeal.Â  \r\n[2] The jury, in fact, found in favor of NationsWaste in Roddeyâ€™s claim for defamation against the company.Â  \r\n[3] We need not address NationsWasteâ€™s remaining issues.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
