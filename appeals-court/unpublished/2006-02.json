Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-067\r\nSubmitted January, 1 2006 â€“ Filed February 1, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Richard Alexander Murdaugh, of Hampton, for Appellant.\r\n        Derek Farrell Dean, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is a slip and fall case.Â  Carrigg alleged that while dining at a restaurant owned by Cusch, Inc., d/b/a T-Bonz Restaurant (T-Bonz), she slipped on water on the floor leading to the restroom and fell, injuring herself.Â  The circuit court granted T-Bonzâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  In order to recover for injuries sustained in a fall caused by a foreign substance on the storekeeperâ€™s floor, a customer must prove either that the foreign substance was placed on the floor by the storekeeper or that the storekeeper had actual or constructive notice of the foreign substance on the floor and failed to remove it.Â  Wintersteen v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, 35, 542 S.E.2d 728, 729 (2001).Â  No evidence in the record indicates that employees of T-Bonz caused the water to be placed on the floor, or that anyone at T-Bonz had actual knowledge of the water.Â  Thus, negligence can be established only by a showing of constructive knowledge.Â  We hold that Carrigg is unable to demonstrate constructive notice pursuant to the following authorities:Â  Gillespie v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 302 S.C. 90, 91, 394 S.E.2d 24, 25 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding that the mere fact that water was on the floor and within the vision of store employees is not enough to establish constructive knowledge); Young v. Meeting Street Piggly Wiggly,&nbsp;288 S.C. 508, 510, 343 S.E.2d 636, 637-38&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986) (holding that a merchantâ€™s liability may not be based solely on the presence of moisture on the floor); Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 165-66, 580 S.E.2d 440, 442 (2003) (holding that to impose a duty on merchants to continuously inspect and maintain floors to ensure their freedom from foreign substances would effectively render them insurers of customer safety).Â  \r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find that Carriggâ€™s arguments to the effect that T-Bonz either created an unreasonably dangerous condition by failing to cover the entire floor with the mats or was on notice of the dangerous condition as evidenced by its policy of placing the mats on the floor are not properly preserved for appeal.Â  See Elam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 23, 602 S.E.2d 772, 779-780 (2004) (holding that issues and arguments are preserved for appellate review only when they are raised to and ruled on by the lower court).Â  In any event, we find the arguments fail on the merits pursuant to the following authorities: Olson, 354 S.C. at 166, 580 S.E.2d at 443 (holding that merchants are not required to make floors more slip-resistant when they are wet); Wintersteen, 344 S.C. at 37, 542 S.E.2d at 731 (holding that in slip-and-fall cases involving foreign substances, courts in this state have rejected a â€œduty to preventâ€ rule, thus requiring a plaintiff to prove actual or constructive notice).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-068","title":"Cooke v.

Jeffords, of Florence; John S. Nichols, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        George M. Hearn, Jr., of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Toni Cooke (Wife) appeals from the order of the family court identifying, valuing, and apportioning the marital property and awarding Wife $15,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and $15,000 in expert fees.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nRichard C. Cooke (Husband) and Wife married in August of 1984.Â  At the time of their marriage Husband was a twenty-four year old farmer and Wife was an eighteen year old high school senior.Â  Husbandâ€™s father was in the nursing home business.Â  Shortly after the couple married, Husband took and passed the test to become a nursing home administrator.Â  Wife graduated from high school and worked part-time at a drug store and went to college, until she gave birth to the coupleâ€™s son, Richard, in 1986.Â  In 1989, the couple entered into an agreement to operate McCoy Memorial Nursing Center (McCoy).Â  Wife returned to college and graduated in 1991.Â  She began taking the test to become a nursing home administrator, which she ultimately passed in 2002.Â  \r\nIn 1992, the couple formed Cooke Management Company, which they used to manage McCoy and one of Husbandâ€™s fatherâ€™s facilities.Â  In 1994, the coupleâ€™s daughter, Avonlea, was born.Â  That same year the couple formed A&amp;R Enterprises to manage and lease McCormick Health Care and Fountain Inn Nursing Home.Â  The couple continued to manage those nursing homes in addition to several others until their separation in November of 2000.Â  \r\nIn February 2001, Wife commenced an action seeking separate maintenance and support, joint custody, determination of child support, alimony, equitable apportionment of the marital property, and an award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  The family court issued a temporary injunction and restraining order prohibiting the parties from disposing of or encumbering marital property.Â  In May 2002, the family court granted the couple a divorce based on one yearâ€™s continuous separation and approved a joint custody agreement awarding custody of their son to Husband and custody of their daughter to Wife.Â  In its order, the family court also retained jurisdiction over all other issues raise by the parties in their pleadings awaiting completion of discovery.Â  \r\nThe family court held a hearing on the remaining issues in July of 2003 and issued a final order in September 2003.Â  In its order, the family court: (1) approved a settlement agreement between the parties regarding alimony and division of the business property; (2) identified, valued and apportioned the remaining marital property; (3) determined the child support obligations of both parties; and (4) ordered Husband to pay $15,000 toward Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and $15,000 toward Wifeâ€™s expert fees.Â  Both parties filed motions pursuant to Rules 59 and 60, SCRCP, requesting the family court alter or amend its order.Â  The family court reduced the value of the â€œbootâ€ Husband received as a result of a bank merger by the amount Husband used to pay taxes, changed an award of the â€œFord Farmâ€ to the Husband with credit to Wife, and ordered Husband pay the mortgages on two tracts of property awarded to the Wife.Â  It denied all of the other requests made by the parties in their motions.Â  Wife appealed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from an order of the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Hopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 304, 540 S.E.2d 454, 456 (2000).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to ignore the findings of the family court.Â  Haselden v. Haselden, 347 S.C. 48, 58, 552 S.E.2d 329, 334 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  â€œNeither are we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Equitable Apportionment\r\nWife argues the family court erred in apportioning 45% of the marital estate to her and 55% to Husband.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) requires the family court to consider fifteen factors in apportioning marital property, but allows the court to weigh those factors as it deems appropriate.Â  In reviewing the family courtâ€™s equitable apportionment, an appellate courtâ€™s role is to examine the fairness of the apportionment as a whole.Â  Bragg v. Bragg, 347 S.C. 16, 24, 553 S.E.2d 251, 255 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The family courtâ€™s apportionment will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  at 23, 553 S.E.2d at 255.Â  â€œThis court will affirm the family court judge if it can be determined that the judge addressed the factors under section 20-7-472 sufficiently for us to conclude he was cognizant of the statutory factors.â€Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nThe family courtâ€™s order indicates it considered all of the appropriate factors, and we find the family court fairly apportioned the marital property as a whole.Â  At the time of the trial, Husband was 43, while Wife was 37.Â  Their marriage lasted for 17 years.Â  Both Husband and Wife have college degrees and are certified nursing home administrators.Â  Both have experienced health problems in the past, but as the family court found, neither have problems that affect their ability to work.Â  We agree with the family courtâ€™s determination that Husband earns approximately $180,000 per year based on his earnings for 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002.Â  As part of an agreement between the parties, Wife will discontinue her employment at Bradford Gardens, however she will receive $325,000 in lump sum alimony payable by Husband over a period of five years.Â  Although Husband alleged Wife committed adultery, the family court found that the marriage was broken simply because the parties grew apart.Â  \r\nThe parties entered into a custody agreement in which their son would live with Husband and their daughter would live with Wife.Â  In light of this arrangement, the family court ordered Husband to pay Wife $200 per month in child support in addition to paying for 70% of daughterâ€™s private school tuition and maintaining health insurance for both children.Â  \r\nThe family court required the parties to be responsible for any debt associated with the property they received, other than two tracts Wife received that Husband is to pay the mortgages.Â  \r\nThe family court determined Husbandâ€™s earnings were triple Wifeâ€™s over the course of the marriage.Â  This determination is supported by Husbandâ€™s testimony that he contributed 76% of the income during the marriage, as compared to Wifeâ€™s 24% and a schedule introduced by Husband detailing the partiesâ€™ earnings.Â  Wife does not contest this fact, but simply argues she made more indirect contributions in addition to her direct financial contributions.Â  However, Husband contends he and Wife shared the household duties and his mother cared for their son while Wife worked.Â  \r\nIn Pool v. Pool, we addressed a comparable situation in which the family court awarded 60% of the marital property to the husband. 321 S.C. 84, 88, 467 S.E.2d 753, 756 (Ct. App. 1996) affâ€™d as modified by 329 S.C. 324, 494 S.E.2d 820 (1998).Â  Similar to this case, the husband made 71% of the direct financial contributions to the marriage and the parties offered contradictory testimony concerning their indirect contributions.Â  In upholding the family courtâ€™s decision, we found, â€œThe court assessed the credibility of the parties in weighing their testimony concerning their indirect contributions to the marriage and concluded the parties contributed equally in terms of indirect contributions.â€Â  Id. at 87-89, 467 S.E.2d at 755-56.Â  Considering the contributions and the other factors, we concluded the overall apportionment was fair.Â  Id.Â  at 89, 467 S.E.2d at 756.\r\nIn the instant case, similar to Pool, we find the family court assessed the credibility of the parties concerning the contributions to the marriage.Â  In addition, the court thoroughly addressed the other applicable factors.Â  Thus, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion in apportioning 55% of the marital property to Husband and 45% to Wife.\r\nII.Â  Life Insurance \r\n Wife argues the family court erred in awarding her only $109,080.45 from the proceeds of the life insurance policy on Husbandâ€™s father.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nDuring the marriage, Husbandâ€™s father, Carlyle Cook took out several policies on his life.Â  One policy, which had a face value of $450,000, named Husband as the owner of the policy and primary beneficiary.Â  Husband testified at the final hearing that McCoy, which he and his father jointly owned, paid the premiums.Â  In June 2002, just after the coupleâ€™s divorce, but prior to the family courtâ€™s identification of the marital property, Husbandâ€™s father died as a result of an accident.Â  Husband, as primary beneficiary, received $484,802 in proceeds from the policy.Â  In its final order, the family court determined because McCoy paid the premiums on the policy and Husband owned a 50% interest in McCoy, only one-half of the proceeds from the policy were marital property.Â  The Wifeâ€™s 45% share of this amount was $109,080.45.Â  On Wifeâ€™s motion to alter or amend, the family court held that even if the entire death proceeds were included in the marital estate, based on the contributions of the parties in acquiring the funds, the award of $109,080.45 to Wife was appropriate and should not be modified.Â Â  \r\nSection 20-7-472 vests the family court, not this court, with discretion to decide what weight to assign each factor in considering equitable apportionment of the marital estate.Â  When reviewing the family courtâ€™s equitable apportionment, â€œthis Court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment.Â  If the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant that this Court might have weighed specific factors differently than the trial judge.â€Â  Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988) (citation omitted).\r\nHere, as noted above, the family court considered all of the relevant factors in making its initial apportionment of the marital estate.Â  In its order on the Wifeâ€™s motion to alter or amend, the court focused on the contribution of the parties to the acquisition of the life insurance proceeds in apportioning the proceeds as a marital asset.Â  In her brief, the wife made no argument that such an apportionment was inequitable.[1]Â  An appellant has the burden of convincing this court that the family court committed error in its findings.Â  Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 117, 557 S.E.2d 693, 703 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Therefore, we hold that as the family court considered all of the relevant factors, we find no abuse of discretion in its award to Wife of $109,080.45 as her share of the life insurance proceeds. \r\nIII. Valuation of Certificate of Deposit and â€œBootâ€ \r\nWife argues the family court erred in valuing a certificate of deposit (CD) at Carolina Community Bank and the cash â€œbootâ€ received by Husband after the merger of Carolina Community Bank and First Bank of North Carolina.Â  Wife asserts the family court erred in finding Husband used funds from these accounts to pay the coupleâ€™s 2000 income tax liabilities.Â  She contends Husband offered no evidence other than his own testimony to support his assertion, and thus, the family court erred in reducing the value of these assets to reflect the alleged tax payments.Â  We disagree. \r\nAt trial, Husband and Wife both submitted financial declarations including the CD valued at $31,934 and the boot money of $90,000.Â  However, on Husbandâ€™s declaration, he indicated he used the proceeds from the CD and $33,120 of the proceeds from the boot to pay the coupleâ€™s 2000 income tax liability.Â  In addition, Husband stated during his testimony that he used the proceeds from the CD and a portion of the boot to pay the tax liability.Â  \r\nAlthough Husband only cites to his own assertions as evidence of payment, Wife does not offer any evidence to the contrary.Â  Thus, given our deference for the family court, which saw and heard the witness at trial, we find no error by the family court in choosing to believe Husbandâ€™s assertions.Â  See Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 516, 586 S.E.2d 136, 139 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony).Â  \r\nIV. Attorneyâ€™s Fees and Costs \r\nWife argues the family court abused its discretion in only awarding her $15,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and $15,000 in expert witness fees.Â  She maintains because she obtained a favorable result and incurred $58,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and $61,000 in expert fees, she should have been awarded these amounts.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 20-7-420(38) (Supp. 2005) of the South Carolina Code provides that attorneyâ€™s fees may be awarded in an action brought in family court.Â  â€œAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge and should not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004).Â  In determining what amount of attorneyâ€™s fees should be awarded, the court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; the time necessarily devoted to the case; the professional standing of counsel; the contingency of compensation; the beneficial results obtained; and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991). \r\nIn its order, the family court noted Wife had already been awarded $25,000 at a prior hearing.Â  It acknowledged Wife received a favorable result in that she received a greater portion of the marital property than originally proposed by Husband and she received a portion of the life insurance proceeds from Husbandâ€™s fatherâ€™s policy.Â  Considering each partyâ€™s financial condition and ability to pay, the family court noted Husband earned on average $190,000 in the two years prior to the commencement of the marital litigation, while Wife is entitled to receive a substantial lump sum alimony award.Â  \r\nIn addition, the family court considered the reasonableness of the fees charged.Â  In its order, the family court called attention to several errors made by Wifeâ€™s expert in valuing Husbandâ€™s ownership interest in various nursing home businesses.Â  During cross-examination, Wifeâ€™s expert admitted he omitted a debt owed by A &amp; R and misvalued a mortgage owed by another entity.Â  In addition, Wifeâ€™s expert admitted to using incorrect ownership percentages for another business.Â  The family court also mentioned some of the charges in the bill submitted by Wifeâ€™s attorney were incurred as a result of the contempt proceeding against both Husband and Wife.Â  In the order finding both Husband and Wife in contempt, the family court instructed both parties to pay their own attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Thus, as the family court stated in its order, these fees â€œshould not be considered in the total attorneyâ€™s fees award as they have been previously denied.â€Â  \r\nBased on our review, the family court properly considered the appropriate factors in awarding Wife $15,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees and $15,000 in expert fees.Â  Accordingly, we do not find the family court abused its discretion in making these awards, rather than awarding Wife the entire amount of fees she incurred.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above reason, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and WILLIAMS, JJ., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â \r\n\r\n[1] At oral argument, Wife did argue for the first time that the family court should not have apportioned the proceeds separately from the remainder of the marital estate.Â  We find this argument was not properly presented to this court.Â  See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Social Servs. v. Basnight, 346 S.C. 241, 250, 551 S.E.2d 274, 278 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating an appellant may not use oral argument as a vehicle to argue issues not argued in the appellantâ€™s brief.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-069","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Eric Simpson appeals a conviction of trafficking in crack cocaine, arguing, inter alia, that the trial court erred in admitting testimony that implied Simpson was a high-level drug trafficker.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn August 2002, agents from the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services served a probation warrant on Sharon Smith at her documented residence.Â  Several minutes after knocking on the front door, the agents were met by Vernon Mormon, Smithâ€™s live-in boyfriend, who granted the agents permission to enter and told them Smith was in the back bedroom.Â  After a brief struggle, during which Smith attempted to hold the bedroom door closed, the agents apprehended Smith.Â  In her hand was a pipe containing a partially smoked rock of crack cocaine.Â  Behind the bedroom door, agents found three rifles.\r\nAfter finding the firearms, the agents performed a security search of the residence.Â  The search yielded small baggies of crack cocaine in both the hallway and near the entrance to a bathroom.Â  An agent entered the bathroom and spotted a third baggie of crack cocaine and some money lying in a clothes hamper.Â  In total, over 18 grams of crack cocaine were found in close proximity of the bathroom.Â  After noticing a pair of shoes under the shower curtain, the agent found Eric Simpson hiding in the bathroomâ€™s shower.Â  Both Simpson and Smith were arrested.\r\nSimpson was subsequently indicted by a Spartanburg grand jury for trafficking in crack cocaine and tried by a jury in December 2004.Â  At trial, the State presented Smithâ€™s testimony to establish the crack cocaine found in the residence belonged to Simpson.Â  According to Smith, Simpson, her regular crack cocaine dealer, stopped by that evening to sell Smith some crack cocaine shortly before the agents arrived to execute the warrant.Â  Smith testified that, as a mere user, she would never have that amount of crack cocaine in her possession.Â  She acknowledged, however, that earlier that evening she purchased a small amount of the drug from another neighborhood dealer, which she promptly consumed to â€œtide [her] overâ€ until Simpson arrived. \r\nSimpson was convicted and sentenced to ten years incarceration.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\n1. Rule 404(b), SCRE\r\nSimpson contends the trail court erred in admitting evidence that implied he was a high-level trafficker, arguing such implication is a violation of Rule 402 and Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for appellate review.\r\nAt trial, Doug Harwell, a narcotics officer for the Spartanburg Department of Public Safety, testified generally to the amount of drugs typically carried by different levels of drug traffickers.Â  Defense counsel objected on the grounds the officer was not qualified to give expert testimony.Â  This objection was later withdrawn.\r\nâ€œAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 120-121, 481 S.E.2d 118, 123 (1997).Â  â€œWhere an objection and the ground therefor is not stated in the record, there is no basis for appellate review.â€Â  State v. Morris, 307 S.C. 480, 485, 415 S.E.2d 819, 823 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  â€œThe objection should be sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error so that it can be reasonably understood by the trial judge.â€ State v. Holliday, 333 S.C. 332, 338, 509 S.E.2d 280, 283 (Ct. App. 1998) (quoting McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 344, 479 S.E.2d 67, 75 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\nNot only was the objection to the testimony in question withdrawn, it was based on entirely different grounds as those raised in Simpsonâ€™s appellate brief.Â  Because there was no contemporaneous objection to this testimony on the grounds asserted on appeal, we conclude this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\n2. Hearsay Testimony\r\nSimpson also argues the trial court erred in admitting testimony from Officer Harwell relating to his prior experiences with user-level drug addicts because the testimony was hearsay.Â  Again, we find this issue is not preserved for appellate review.\r\nThe subject of Harwellâ€™s experience dealing with drug addicts was first raised by the defense on cross-examination.Â  The issue was addressed again briefly by the State on re-direct, but the defense made no objection on the ground of hearsay.Â  For the reasons discussed in section one, we conclude this issue is likewise not preserved for our review.\r\nThe ruling of the trial court is therefore\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-070","title":"State v.

Carpenter, Jr., and Francis M. Mack, of Columbia, for Appellants. \r\n        John D. Kassel, and William D. Robertson, III, of Columbia, for Respondents. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Charles E. Strickland and Preferred Home Inspections, Inc. (collectively Strickland) appeal from the circuit court order denying their motion to compel arbitration.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nJohn and Lillian Seibert lived in Wilton, Connecticut, prior to February of 2000.Â  On February 1, 2000, John Seibert moved to South Carolina and took a job with Capital City Insurance.Â  Capital City Insurance is located in Columbia, South Carolina.Â  In November of 1999, the Seibert family came to Columbia to â€œsee if [they] wanted to make this move.â€Â  Seibert decided to take the job, and he and his wife contacted a real estate agent to find a house.Â  John Seibert moved from Connecticut into an apartment in the Columbia area for a short time.Â  The Seiberts bought a home in Lexington County and Lillian joined John shortly thereafter.Â  \r\nIn connection with the real estate transaction, and prior to closing, John Seibert contracted with Strickland to perform a home inspection.Â  Stricklandâ€™s company is located in Richland County, South Carolina.Â  The home inspection agreement contained an arbitration provision.Â  \r\nStrickland performed the inspection on April 18, 2000.Â  After completing the inspection, he handed the report to John and Lillian, who were both at the site with him.Â  The report was also faxed and mailed to the residence in Connecticut.Â  Seibert paid for the inspection with a check drawn on a Connecticut bank.Â  \r\nThe underlying dispute in this case arose from the Seibertsâ€™ purchase of the home in Lexington County, which was clad with synthetic stucco siding.Â  John and Lillian Seibert filed an action against Strickland and other defendants on May 21, 2001.Â  The centerpiece of the Seibertsâ€™ suit involves a myriad of alleged problems associated with the synthetic stucco exterior.Â  \r\nStrickland and Preferred Home Inspections moved to dismiss the Complaint and to compel arbitration.Â  It is undisputed that the arbitration provision is unenforceable under South Carolina law because the provision was not capitalized or prominently rubber-stamped on the contract, and thus fails to meet the requirements of section 15-48-10(a) of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  See Blanton v. Stathos, 351 S.C. 534, 538-39, 570 S.E.2d 565, 567 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Arbitration was therefore sought pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1 to 16 (2003), on the basis that the home inspection agreement evidenced a transaction involving interstate commerce.Â  The circuit court denied the motion to compel arbitration, finding insufficient evidence of interstate commerce to invoke the federal act.Â  This appeal follows. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe question of the arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination, unless the parties provide otherwise.â€Â  Stokes v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 606, 609, 571 S.E.2d 711, 713 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001)).Â  â€œDeterminations of arbitrability are subject to de novo review.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nStrickland contends the circuit court erred in finding the arbitration provision unenforceable because the transaction did not involve interstate commerce, and therefore did not trigger the FAA.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIt is undisputed that the arbitration provision in this case is unenforceable under South Carolina law.Â  Nevertheless, because of the policy favoring arbitration, an arbitration provision may be enforceable under the FAA.Â  Soil Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way Envtl., Inc.,&nbsp;323 S.C. 454, 458, 476 S.E.2d 149, 151&nbsp;(1996).Â  â€œFor the Federal Act to apply, the commerce involved in the contract must be interstate or foreign.â€Â  Id. at 460, 476 S.E.2d at 152.Â  The scope of the FAA is coextensive with the broadest permissible exercise of the federal Commerce Clause power.Â  Towles v. United Healthcare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 36, 524 S.E.2d 839, 843 (Ct. App. 1999); see also 9 U.S.C. Â§ 2, U.S. Const. art. I, Â§ 8, cl. 3.Â  â€œIn all cases, determination of whether a transaction involves interstate commerce depends on the facts of the case.â€Â  Thornton v. Trident Med. Ctr., L.L.C.,&nbsp;357 S.C. 91, 95-96, 592 S.E.2d 50, 52&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nâ€œTo ascertain whether a transaction involves commerce within the meaning of the FAA, the court must examine the agreement, the complaint, and the surrounding facts.â€Â  Towles, 338 S.C. at 36, 524 S.E.2d at 843.Â  This determination is made irrespective of whether the parties contemplated an interstate transaction.Â  Munoz v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 538-39, 542 S.E.2d 360, 363 (2001).Â  The court should focus on what the terms of the contract specifically require for its performance, looking to the essential character of the contract.Â  Thornton, 357 S.C. at 96, 592 S.E.2d at 52.Â Â  \r\nStrickland first argues the transaction involves interstate commerce because the parties are domiciled in different states.Â  We begin by noting that the Seiberts alleged they were residents of Lexington County in their complaint.Â  Residence is a question of fact and is generally determined by a partyâ€™s intent.Â  Ferguson v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co., 254 S.C. 235, 238, 174 S.E.2d 768, 769 (1970).Â  â€œThe act and intent as to domicile, not the duration of the residence, are the determining factors.â€Â  Id. at 238-39, 149 S.E.2d at 769.Â  \r\nBecause only John Seibert signed the inspection contract, we need not consider Lillianâ€™s domicile.Â  At the time John Seibert signed the contract, he had accepted a job in South Carolina and had been living in an apartment in South Carolina for two months.Â  The inspection contract related to the purchase of a home, indicating that John Seibert intended his residence to be in South Carolina.Â  \r\nMoreover, the mere fact that the parties to a contract are from different states is not alone sufficient to trigger the FAA.Â  See, e.g., Timms v. Greene, 310 S.C. 469, 473, 427 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1993) (holding that although one of the parties was domiciled in Delaware, the contract itself did not involve interstate commerce).Â  Contracts involving the sale of real estate have been held not to trigger the FAA when, despite the fact that the contracting parties were domiciled outside this state, there was no nexus between the contract and interstate commerce.Â  Soil Remediation Co., 323 S.C. at 460, 476 S.E.2d at 152 (citing Matthews v. Fluor Corp., 312 S.C. 404, 440 S.E.2d 880 (1994).Â  Accordingly, something more than the domicile of the parties is required to â€œinvolve interstate commerce.â€[1]Â  \r\nStrickland next attempts to rely on the fact that the Seibertsâ€™ check to pay for the inspection was drawn on an out-of-state bank, and that a copy of the report was sent to the Seibertsâ€™ Connecticut residence.Â  We find these facts insufficient to establish a nexus between the contract and interstate commerce.Â  The focus of the determination is on what the terms of the contract specifically require for performance, looking to its essential character.Â  Thornton, 357 S.C. at 96, 592 S.E.2d at 52.Â  Performance of the contract must require activity involving interstate commerce.Â  Id. at 97, 592 S.E.2d at 53.Â  Factors involving interstate commerce that are only incidental to the nature of the contract need not be considered.[2]Â  Id. at 96, 592 S.E.2d at 52.Â  \r\nHere, performance of the contract did not require any activity outside of this state.Â  The location of the bank on which the check was drawn is merely incidental to the nature of the contract.Â  Moreover, the mere fact that copies of the report were sent to Connecticut is of no account because the original report was delivered to the Seiberts in South Carolina.Â  We therefore find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s determination that the transaction was essentially a local one lacking a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce to trigger the FAA.Â  The denial of the motion to compel arbitration isÂ Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. Â \r\n\r\n[1] The cases Strickland cites for the proposition that citizenship in different states is sufficient all involve contracts that required some form of interstate transfer to be performed.Â  See, e.g., Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,&nbsp;388 U.S. 395, 401, (1967) (contract related to acquisition of a multi-state paint business); Ideal Unlimited Servs. Corp. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc.,&nbsp;727 F.Supp. 75, 77&nbsp;(D.P.R. 1989) (contract involved shipment of goods across state lines).Â  Although some federal cases seem to suggest that mere diversity of citizenship is sufficient, that rule has not been adopted in the Fourth Circuit.Â  \r\n[2] Munoz, which arguably could be read to hold that mere domicile in different states is sufficient, does not require this construction because the contract in Munoz was an installment contract and security agreement secured by a home mortgage to finance a home improvement project.Â  Thus, performance of the project required interstate transfer of both payments and building materials.Â  Munoz, 343 S.C. at 536, 542 S.E.2d at 362.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-072","title":"McCrea v.

Graham, of Florence, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        Charles A. Harris, Jr., of Cheraw, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Lakefhia McCrea brought suit against Jafer Gheraibeh for injuries and property damages suffered in an automobile collision.Â  After receiving a verdict in her favor, McCrea appeals seeking a new trial.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMcCrea and Gheraibeh were involved in an automobile collision in which Gheraibeh ran a red light and struck McCreaâ€™s vehicle on the driverâ€™s side door.Â  McCrea was taken to the emergency room to be examined, but she was released.Â  She had no cuts or bruises, and the x-rays performed were normal.Â  \r\nMcCrea later saw her personal physician.Â  Her physician ordered additional x-rays as well as an MRI.Â  These tests were normal.Â  McCrea attended physical therapy for pain to her back and left side.Â  The therapy was provided by Macleod Physical Therapy, which is also where McCrea worked at the time of the accident.Â  \r\nMcCrea brought suit against Gheraibeh seeking compensation for her alleged injuries and damage to her vehicle.Â  At trial, Gheraibeh admitted liability for the accident, but challenged McCreaâ€™s testimony regarding the amount of damages.Â  McCrea did not offer the testimony of any of the treating doctors.Â  She entered a summary of her medical bills showing a total of $9,393.67.Â  \r\nAs for the property damage, McCrea testified she purchased the car using financing and admitted the cash price was $1,000 less than she paid.Â  She asserted the value of the car was $7,145.83, which constituted the balance remaining on her loan.Â  Gheraibeh argued the car would depreciate faster than the loan balance and that the excessive mileage she put on the car commuting at least 60 miles a day would decrease the carâ€™s value.Â  \r\nThe jury returned a verdict in McCreaâ€™s favor.Â  The jury awarded her $5,985 in personal injury damages and $5,000 in property damages.Â  McCrea made post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), new trial absolute, and new trial nisi additur.Â  The court denied the motions and entered judgment on McCreaâ€™s behalf for $6,887.25, after reducing the verdict amount by an offset of $4,097.75 previously paid.Â  McCrea appeals numerous issues involving jury voir dire and selection, the admission of evidence, the failure to give a jury instruction regarding the collateral source rule, and the denial of motions for JNOV and for a new trial.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Voir Dire\r\nMcCrea contends the trial court erred in refusing further voir dire of potential jurors regarding any bias stemming from â€œmass media campaignsâ€ favoring tort reform.Â  She contends the court should have asked prospective jurors their opinions regarding tort reform, their involvement in political causes or campaigns, or their belief regarding the appropriateness of bringing a lawsuit for damages in an automobile wreck.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe manner and scope of voir dire is largely within the discretion of the trial judge.Â  Crosby v. Southeast Zayre, Inc., 274 S.C. 519, 521, 265 S.E.2d 517, 519 (1980); State v. Middleton, 266 S.C. 251, 256-57, 222 S.E.2d 763, 765 (1976), vacated by 429 U.S. 807 (1976); Norris v. Ferre, 315 S.C. 179, 181, 432 S.E.2d 491, 492 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  On appeal, this court will rely on the judgment of the trial judge who is able to observe the character and demeanor of the jurors, unless the record firmly establishes an abuse of discretion.Â  See Wilson v. Childs, 315 S.C. 431, 437-38, 434 S.E.2d 286, 290 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nThe trial court properly asked questions to determine whether any juror held an underlying bias against any of the parties or their claims.Â  The court determined the jurors could act fairly.Â  The purpose of voir dire is not to probe every possible aspect of the juror, but to seek a fair and impartial jury.Â  Based on the questions asked by the court, we find no abuse of discretion in refusing to ask McCreaâ€™s remaining questions.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Batson\r\nMcCrea asserts the trial court erred in failing to grant her Batson[1] motion because strikes used by Gheraibehâ€™s attorney were impermissible and racially motivated.Â  She maintains the â€œrace-neutralâ€ explanation given by Gheraibehâ€™s counsel was mere pretext.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring the seating of the jury, Gheraibehâ€™s attorney struck three out of six African-American jurors including Mr. Green, an African-American male with dreadlocks.Â  After the use of peremptory strikes was completed, McCreaâ€™s counsel challenged the use of Gheraibehâ€™s strikes as racially discriminatory.Â  In response, the court properly held a Batson hearing to determine the reason for the strikes.Â  Gheraibehâ€™s attorney explained that Mr. Greenâ€™s â€œappearance including - - including the dreadlocksâ€ gave him some pause.Â  \r\nIn Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995), the United States Supreme Court held that â€œthe prosecutorâ€™s proffered explanation in this case--that he struck juror number 22 because he had long, unkempt hair, a mustache, and a beard--is race neutral and satisfies the prosecutionâ€™s step two burden of articulating a nondiscriminatory reason for the strike.â€Â  Id. at 769.Â  The court explained that long unkempt hair is not characteristic to any particular race.Â  Id.\r\nIn light of Purkett, we believe counselâ€™s concern regarding Mr. Greenâ€™s appearance and his dreadlocks is a racially neutral explanation for the strike.Â  The main justification was his appearance and the â€œvery long dreadlocksâ€ which supplied counselâ€™s uneasiness towards Mr. Green.Â  Just as long hair is generally â€œout of the norm,â€ so are very long dreadlocks.Â  The decision to wear an alternative hairstyle is not specific to any race, and therefore, no discriminatory intent is inherent in the explanation.Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Impeachment Using Collision Report\r\nMcCrea next asserts the trial court improperly denied her motion for a mistrial after Gheraibehâ€™s attorney referenced an accident report regarding a wreck occurring subsequent to the collision in this case.Â  We disagree.\r\nGheraibehâ€™s attorney stated: â€œThe officer who investigated that accident showed . . . estimated damage . . . of $7,000.â€Â  McCrea objected, and the court sustained McCreaâ€™s objection to the introduction of the testimony.Â  The court further issued a curative instruction for the jury not to consider that information.\r\nâ€œAn instruction to disregard incompetent evidence usually is deemed to have cured the error in its admission unless on the facts of the particular case it is probable that notwithstanding such instruction or withdrawal the accused was prejudiced.â€Â  State v. Simpson, 325 S.C. 37, 43, 479 S.E.2d 57, 60 (1996) (citing State v. Craig, 267 S.C. 262, 227 S.E.2d 306 (1976)).Â  We find the curative instruction was more than sufficient to cure any harm caused by the statement by Gheraibehâ€™s attorney.Â  Additionally, there was other evidence entered into the record without objection regarding the subsequent accident.Â  Consequently, McCrea cannot show prejudice resulting from the failure of the court to declare a mistrial. \r\nIV.Â Â Â  Collateral Source Rule\r\nMcCrea next contends the trial court erred by not giving a jury instruction regarding the collateral source rule once testimony was elicited regarding McCreaâ€™s lack of insurance benefits. [2]Â  We disagree.\r\nThe testimony McCrea contends required a jury instruction on the collateral source rule barely intimated that she had previously had health insurance.Â  Additionally, there is no evidence in the record of the amount, if any, paid by insurance on McCreaâ€™s behalf.Â  While the collateral source rule is sometimes warranted, the trial judge is allowed discretion in determining an appropriate charge based on the evidence presented in the trial.Â  See Smith&nbsp; v. Ridgeway Chems., Inc., 302 S.C. 303, 307, 395 S.E.2d 742, 744 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  JNOV and New Trial\r\nMcCrea maintains the trial court should have granted her motion for JNOV on the grounds that the only evidence in the record supports an award of the full amount of damages she requested.Â  She further contends that the trial court should have granted her a new trial because her award was grossly inadequate in light of the evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.â€Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  In the instant case, McCrea presented her testimony and a summary of the doctorâ€™s bills into evidence in support of her claim for personal injury damages.Â  Additionally, she testified regarding the amount she paid for her car, the amount remaining on the loan, and her opinion regarding the carâ€™s value.\r\nHowever, Gheraibeh extensively cross-examined McCrea regarding the necessity of some of the medical expenses.Â  He had McCrea admit that all the tests performed by various doctors, including x-rays and an MRI, returned normal.Â  McCrea admitted she was in previous automobile accidents in which she suffered soft-tissue injuries and was in a subsequent vehicle collision.Â  While he did not present a definite dollar amount for her damages, Gheraibehâ€™s attorney argued an appropriate amount would be the cost of her emergency room visit and of her doctors, but not the physical therapy.Â  \r\nIn addition, Gheraibeh challenged McCreaâ€™s valuation of her vehicle.Â  She admitted she paid $1,000 more than the cash price in order to receive financing.Â  She also stated that she has traveled about 60 miles roundtrip each day to work for several years.Â  When asked about the mileage on the vehicle, she was unable to give a figure, but admitted it could be close to 100,000 miles.Â  Finally, Gheraibeh argued the vehicle may have depreciated faster than the balance on McCreaâ€™s financing was being paid, causing the car to be worth less than was owed.Â  Based upon the evidence in the record and Gheraibehâ€™s extensive cross-examination of McCrea, we find the trial court properly denied McCreaâ€™s motion for JNOV.\r\nFurthermore, the award given McCrea was not so shockingly disproportionate to the injuries suffered that it indicated â€œpassion, caprice, prejudice, partiality, corruptionâ€ or other considerations not reflected by the evidence.Â  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 404, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  McCrea contends her evidence showed she sustained $9,393.67 in medical expenses, lost $2,898.55 as a result of being off work, and suffered pain and suffering as a result of the collision.Â  The juryâ€™s award of $5,985 is hardly â€œde minimusâ€ as claimed by McCrea.Â  It is clearly not the result of passion, caprice or prejudice. \r\nAs to her vehicle damage, McCrea presented the figure of $7,145.83 as the debt remaining after financing and as her opinion regarding the value of the vehicle.Â  The jury awarded $5,000 in damage and this figure could easily represent the juryâ€™s opinion that the vehicle was depreciating faster than McCrea was reducing the amount owed.Â  Accordingly, we refuse to hold the juryâ€™s award was grossly inadequate.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on all of the foregoing, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Batson v.

Sheffield, all of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Kay Biser appeals a trial court order refusing to add parties previously dismissed from the suit.Â  Because we find the dismissed parties are protected by Section 15-78-70 of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, we affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThis case is founded on allegations of medical negligence arising from a procedure performed at the Medical University of South Carolina (hereinafter â€œMUSCâ€) by Dr. John Kratz on Dr. Christopher Biser.Â Â Â  Because the facts surrounding the medical procedure are immaterial to our current determination, we do not recount them here, except to say that Biser did not survive.Â  His wife, in her individual capacity and as the personal representative of her husbandâ€™s estate, brought a medical negligence suit against MUSC, University Medical Associates (hereinafter â€œUMAâ€), John Kratz, M.D., and Andrea Shaer, M.D.Â Â  \r\nPrior to trial, the defendants moved for summary judgment.Â  At the same time, Biser brought a motion to compel against the defendants for failure to comply with discovery requests.Â  The trial court took the unusual step of dismissing all of the defendants without prejudice except for MUSC, while also requiring the original defendants to comply with the discovery requests.Â  The trial court further ordered, that â€œif during the course of discovery, Plaintiffs are able to discover evidence which supports their position in the Complaint, they may upon motion, move to amend to add the parties, Defendants Dr. Kratz, Dr. Shaer, and UMA.â€Â  \r\nThe dismissal was rooted in the trial courtâ€™s understanding of Section 15-78-70 of the South Carolina Code (2005) and the holding in Proveaux v. Medical University of South Carolina, 326 S.C. 28, 482 S.E.2d 774 (1997).Â  Proveaux held that a physician employed by MUSC is immune from suit under the provisions of section 15-78-70, notwithstanding MUSC and the physicianâ€™s relationship with UMA.Â  Id. at 30-32, 482 S.E.2d at 775-76.Â  \r\nBiser did not appeal the dismissal of UMA, Dr. Kratz, and Dr. Shaer, but did move to add Dr. Kratz and UMA after discovering evidence detailing the close relationship between MUSC and UMA and new evidence suggesting Dr. Kratz was not an employee of MUSC but UMA.Â  Essentially, Biser argued UMA and MUSC are separate organizations so the tort claims cap would not apply to UMA.Â  Kratz argued in reply that he was employed by MUSC, not UMA and supported his position by arguing that UMA fits within subsection 70(c) as a â€œpractice plan.â€Â  The court denied the motion to amend and concluded Proveaux applied because UMA does not perform any activity that would make it liable for Dr. Kratzâ€™s actions.Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAlthough this appeal is brought to us as a motion to amend, we review it as a grant of summary judgment to Dr. Kratz and UMA.Â  This is the proper standard of review because these parties were originally named but dismissed without prejudice.Â  In addition, the dismissing order specifically contemplated they could be returned to the suit if facts were uncovered in discovery to justify them as parties.Â  As a general rule, amendment is strongly favored and should be applied liberally when it does not cause prejudice.Â  Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328 S.C. 201, 218, 493 S.E.2d 826, 835-36 (1997).Â  The prejudice Rule 15 envisions is a lack of notice that the new issue is going to be tried and a lack of opportunity to refute it.Â  Tanner v. Florence County Treasurer, 336 S.C. 552, 559, 521 S.E.2d 153, 156 (1999).Â  The party opposing the amendment has the burden of establishing prejudice.Â  Foggie v. CSX Transp., Inc., 315 S.C. 17, 22, 431 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1993).\r\nWhile a motion to amend should be liberally granted, the court also ruled Kratz and UMA were immune from suit and not proper parties under Proveaux.Â  This served as the real reason to deny the amendment; therefore, we must examine whether the court correctly ruled as a matter of law that they were not proper parties to the litigation.Â  \r\nIn reviewing an order for summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Town of Awendaw, 359 S.C. 29, 34, 596 S.E.2d 482, 485&nbsp;(2004).Â  When determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.\r\nLAW AND DISCUSSION\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Kratz\r\nBiser argues the court erred when it refused to add Dr. Kratz as a defendant.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 15-78-70 of the South Carolina Code (2005) states: \r\n\r\n  (a)Â  This chapter constitutes the exclusive remedy for any tort committed by an employee of a governmental entity.Â  An employee of a governmental entity who commits a tort while acting within the scope of his official duty is not liable therefor except as expressly provided for in subsection (b).\r\n   (b) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to give an employee of a governmental entity immunity from suit and liability if it is proved that the employeeâ€™s conduct was not within the scope of his official duties or that it constituted actual fraud, actual malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving moral turpitude.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nBiser does not contend Dr. Kratz committed fraudulent, malicious, or intentional actions, or any crime involving moral turpitude.Â  Instead, Biser argues the statute should not apply to Dr. Kratz because it appears he was an employee of UMA, which was a private entity providing medical care and treatment.Â Â Â  \r\nInitially, it is necessary to understand that UMA is the MUSC-authorized faculty practice plan.Â  Faculty members at MUSC do not solely teach students, they also deliver medical care in the course of their teaching.Â  This means that extensive amounts of money are generated by faculty members for the treatment they provide in the course of their employment at MUSC.Â  MUSC has authorized UMA as the faculty practice plan, and in that capacity, UMA performs billing and collection functions for the faculty physicians.Â  Faculty members are paid through MUSC and also receive separate pay checks from UMA for services rendered in their professional capacity to patients.Â  \r\nSubsection (c) of section 15-78-70 addresses the existence of physician immunity when part of their income is received from a practice plan.Â  It states, in pertinent part, the following: \r\n\r\n  The provisions of this section in no way shall limit or modify the liability of a licensed physician or dentist, acting within the scope of his profession, with respect to any action or claim brought hereunder which involved services for which the physician or dentist was paid, should have been paid, or expected to be paid at the time of the rendering of the services from any source other than the salary appropriated by the governmental entity or fees received from any practice plan authorized by the employer whether or not the practice plan is incorporated and registered with the Secretary of State.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  This section clearly establishes that physician immunity exists even when the physician receives money from a practice plan.\r\nProveaux v. Medical University of South Carolina, 326 S.C. 28, 482 S.E.2d 774 (1997), addressed this provision and clearly established that a faculty member at MUSC retains the immunity provided by section 17-78-70 when they receive part of their compensation through UMA.Â  In Proveaux, the physician received his annual income from two sources: MUSC and UMA.Â  Id. at 31, 482 S.E.2d at 775-76.Â  The supreme court found that because MUSC had to approve the maximum compensation of all physicians, the defendant-physician qualified for immunity under section 15-78-70(c).Â  Id. at 32, 482 S.E.2d at 776.Â  \r\nProveaux is directly on point and requires this court to find that Dr. Kratz qualifies for immunity under section 15-78-70.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in either dismissing him from the case or refusing to amend the complaint to include him as a defendant.\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UMA\r\nBiser argues the court erred when it denied the motion to add UMA as a defendant.Â  We disagree.\r\nProveaux does not directly address the potential liability of UMA; however, after reviewing the legislative intent behind section 15-78-70 and UMAâ€™s ability to control and direct the actions of Dr. Kratz, we find UMA cannot be found liable for Dr. Kratzâ€™s actions. \r\nA partial purpose of section 15-78-70 is to shield government physicians from personal liability arising from the medical care they deliver as government physicians.Â  Although Dr. Kratz is clearly covered, Biser seeks to escape the liability limits created by the Tort Claims Act by holding UMA liable for Kratzâ€™s actions.Â  However, UMA was created to bill and collect revenue generated by faculty physicians in the course of their work.Â  See Baird v. Charleston Cnty, 333 S.C. 519, 536, 511 S.E.2d 69, 78 (1999) (â€œUMA is described as a non-profit corporation formed as a billing and collection agent for the clinical practice of medicine at MUSC.Â  UMA is an operation of MUSCâ€™s Clinical Practice Plan.â€) (citations omitted).Â  Section 15-78-20(g) of the South Carolina Code (2005) recognizes that â€œgovernmental entities, in order to attract qualified physicians . . . , must be able to offer an affordable compensation and employment package, including liability insurance.â€Â  \r\nThe impact of allowing suits to proceed against UMA, which is not protected by the state Tort Claims Act, would be to eviscerate the careful balance between liability and immunity created by the Act.Â  A successful plaintiff could pursue an unlimited recovery against UMA.Â  This unlimited recovery would negatively impact the compensation paid through UMA for the services the faculty physicians perform as employees of MUSC.Â  The result would be that the objectives of 15-78-20(g) and 15-78-70(c) would be either diminished or obliterated.Â  \r\nAdditionally, although Biser argues UMA is the â€œrealâ€ employer of Dr. Kratz, an examination of his relationship with UMA demonstrates that it does not exercise the level of control we normally associate with an employee-employer relationship.Â  Control is the general test used to determine if a worker is an employee.Â  Nelson v.

Storey (collectively â€œStiversâ€) appeal from an order of the circuit court denying their motion to compel arbitration for the time being and allowing the parties to conduct discovery on issues related solely to the agreement to arbitrate.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nR.J. Casale, who resides in California, purchased a 1994 Jaguar XJS from Stivers, a car dealership in South Carolina.Â  Because Casale lived so far away from the dealership, the transaction occurred via facsimile.Â  After the purchase, Casale filed an action against Stivers asserting nine causes of action, all of which essentially arise from Casaleâ€™s claim that Stivers had misrepresented the condition of the car.Â  \r\nStivers moved to stay the action and to compel arbitration.Â  Attached to the motion to compel were an affidavit from Tommy Storey, who is the salesman who completed the sale, and a copy of the Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement, the second page of which contained an arbitration agreement.[1]Â  Storey stated that he faxed the purchase agreement to Casale and received the agreement back via fax with Casaleâ€™s signature on it.Â  In response to Stiversâ€™ motion to compel, Casale submitted an affidavit in which he claims to have only received the first page of the agreement.\r\nThe circuit court issued a Form 4 Order with the following ruling: â€œMotion to compel arbitration is denied at this point in time with parties free to conduct discovery on issues related solely to agreement of acceptance to arbitrate.â€Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nStivers argues the circuit court erred in denying its motion to stay and to compel arbitration because the arbitration agreement is binding against Casale.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, Casale argues this issue is not immediately appealable.Â  However, section 15-48-200 of the South Carolina Code permits the immediate appeal from an order denying an application to compel arbitration.Â  Furthermore, in Towles v. United Healthcare Corp., 338 S.C. 29, 35, 524 S.E.2d 839, 842-43 (Ct. App. 1999), our court considered the appealability of a circuit court order which stated: â€œ[D]efendantsâ€™ motion to compel arbitration is denied, at this time, with leave to refile it at the completion of discovery in this action.â€Â  Our court concluded such an order was immediately appealable.Â  Likewise, we find the order in this case, which denies Stiversâ€™ motion until further discovery can be conducted, is subject to immediate review.\r\nHowever, even though this order is immediately appealable, we find that Stiversâ€™ particular argument â€“ that the arbitration agreement is binding against Casale â€“ is not preserved for our review.Â  In the Form 4 order denying Stiversâ€™ motion to compel, the circuit court did not make a ruling on whether Casale would be bound to arbitrate his causes of action against Stivers.Â  Rather, the court permitted the parties to conduct further discovery on the limited issue of whether Casale accepted the arbitration agreement.Â  After receiving this order, Stivers did not make a Rule 59(e) motion requesting the circuit court make a ruling on whether the arbitration agreement was binding on Casale.Â  Thus, this issue is not preserved for review.Â  Summersell v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Pub. Safety, 337 S.C. 19, 22, 522 S.E.2d 144, 145-46 (1999) (â€œ[W]here an issue presented to the circuit court in a civil case is not explicitly ruled upon in the final order, the issue must be raised by an appropriate post-trial motion to be preserved for appellate review.â€). \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The actual agreement is only one page with two sides.Â  However, if both sides were faxed, the document would have been two pages long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-075","title":"Beaufort v.

Cordell Maddox, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-075\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2006 - Filed February 9, 2006Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Eric J. Erickson, of Beaufort, for Appellant.\r\n        William B. Harvey, III, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Quais Shuler appeals his conviction for driving under the influence, arguing the trial court erred in (1) denying him the opportunity to have a character witness testify in his defense and (2) refusing to charge the jury on good character and reputation.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOfficers pulled Shuler at 2 a.m. after observing him speeding, swerving, and running through a red light.Â Â  Shuler admitted to the officers that he had consumed five drinks, but refused to take a blood alcohol test when it was offered.Â  The officers testified they gave Shuler three field sobriety tests and that he failed two of them.Â  Shuler was charged with driving under the influence.\r\nAt trial, Shuler testified he drank five beers during the day, and then went to a nightclub from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m.Â  Shuler denied drinking any alcohol while at the nightclub.Â  Shuler admitted to speeding and swerving, but denied running a red light.Â  \r\nShuler attempted to call a witness who would testify regarding Shulerâ€™s good character and reputation for veracity.Â  The trial court declined to allow such testimony because the character witness would not be testifying that Shulerâ€™s character was inconsistent with driving under the influence.Â  Shuler made no attempt to proffer the character witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  \r\nWhile discussing jury instructions, Shuler submitted a request to charge the jury as follows:\r\n\r\n  An accused, when charged with a crime, has the right of proving his general good character.Â  He may introduce evidence of his good character which is inconsistent with the crime charged against him.\r\n  Evidence of the general good character of the accused is for the purpose of showing the improbability that the defendant would have committed the crime charged.Â  The good character of the accused is like all other evidence in the case and is entitled to such effect and weight as you, the jury, may determine.\r\n  Good character evidence alone may create a reasonable doubt as to the commission of the crime charged.Â  Thus, under some circumstances, a person might be entitled to a verdict of not guilty when his good reputation is taken into consideration even though a verdict of guilty might be authorized without the evidence of good character.\r\n\r\nThe trial court refused this request to charge because, again, the character witness was purportedly going to testify about Shulerâ€™s propensity for truthfulness rather than a character trait of Shuler that was inconsistent with driving under the influence.Â  \r\nThe jury found Shuler guilty of driving under the influence.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 377, 580 S.E.2d 785, 793 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nShuler argues the trial court erred in refusing to allow his character witness to testify.Â  We find this argument is not preserved for appeal because Shuler failed to proffer his witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 46, 599 S.E.2d 448, 454 (2004) (finding appellant failed to preserve argument regarding excluded witness because testimony of witness was not proffered).Â  \r\nMoreover, this is not a situation where we can overlook the failure to proffer testimony because clear prejudice would result from the ruling.Â  See, e.g., State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 258 n.1, 391 S.E.2d 551, 554 n.1 (1990) (reaching the merits of appellantâ€™s argument regarding the trial courtâ€™s failure to allow his â€œblood spattersâ€ expert to testify despite the fact that no proffer of the testimony was offered because â€œdepriving the jury of expert testimony regarding the blood spatters clearly hampered its ability to evaluate the facts before it in this case.â€).Â  Pursuant to Rule 608 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence:\r\n\r\n  The credibility of a witness may be . . . supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject to these limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and (2) the evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\nNothing in the record indicates the city attacked Shulerâ€™s character for truthfulness.Â  Thus, the trial court did not err in refusing to allow Shuler to present testimony regarding his reputation for veracity.Â  See also State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 473, 523 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1999) (explaining that a defendant does not have an automatic right to introduce evidence of his character for truthfulness simply because he testifies in his defense).\r\nShuler next argues the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury regarding his good character and reputation for truthfulness.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.â€Â  State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001).Â  Because no witness testified regarding Shulerâ€™s good character and Shuler failed to proffer the testimony of his character witness, there is no evidence in the record to support such a charge.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to include this charge in its jury instruction.Â \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-076","title":"Kay v.

Guess, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-076\r\nHeard February 6, 2006 -Â  Filed February 9, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Stephen D. Schusterman, of Rock Hill, for Appellant.\r\n        Michael Benjamin Smith and Thomas F. McDow, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this appeal from a final divorce order, Ben Franklin Kay (Husband) argues the family court erred in (1) determining Husband was capable of representing himself and (2) awarding Tammy Matthews Kaye (Wife) a special equity interest in property the partiesâ€™ purchased during the course of their marriage.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on June 21, 1980, and separated on September 6, 2001.Â  Wife sought a divorce on the grounds of adultery and one year continuous separation. \r\nWhen Wife initiated this action, Husband retained counsel.Â  However, his counsel was relieved on May 27, 2004 on the grounds that Husband failed to communicate with her after requests, thereby rendering representation unreasonably difficult.Â  In the order relieving Husbandâ€™s counsel, the family court scheduled a final hearing for June 17, 2004, and specifically found that Husbandâ€™s â€œfailure to obtain counsel shall not be a reason for a continuance of the final hearing.â€Â  \r\nThe final hearing was not actually held until October 5, 2004, and at the hearing, Husband appeared pro se.Â  The family court asked Husband if he planned to hire an attorney, and Husband explained that he could not afford one.Â  After ascertaining that Husband was forty-four years old, had a ninth grade education, and worked most of his adult life, the family court found Husband was capable of representing himself.Â  \r\nWife testified that during the marriage, she inherited a house from her aunt.Â  Wife sold this house and used the $25,000 in proceeds to purchase property at 1955 Pfaff Drive, which the parties used for rental income.[1]Â  Wife also presented testimony regarding Husbandâ€™s adultery and the special needs of the partiesâ€™ younger daughter.\r\nAfter Wife presented her case, the family court explained to Husband that he too could call witnesses.Â  Husband declined to do so.\r\nThe family court granted the divorce on the ground of one year continuous separation, though it noted that Wife proved Husband committed adultery, and ordered Husband to pay child support for the partiesâ€™ younger daughter. The court also divided the marital property equally between the parties, and granted Wife a $25,000 special equity interest in the 1955 Pfaff Drive property.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen considering an appeal from an order of the family court, our court may find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, however, we recognizeÂ  that the family court judge saw and heard the witnesses and was therefore in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband first argues he was denied due process because the trial court erred in determining Husband was capable of representing himself.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for our review as Husband never lodged an objection to appearing pro se.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).\r\nHusband next argues the trial court erred in granting Wife a special equity interest in the 1955 Pfaff Drive property.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt trial, Wife testified that her aunt had houses in Charlotte, and before her aunt died, she sat down with Wife and Wifeâ€™s sister, Debra, and said: â€œThe will is made out to where [the houses] go to Debra, but Debra, I want you to give [Wife] her half.â€Â  Wife testified that Debra followed through with their auntâ€™s wishes, and after Debra inherited the houses, she gifted one to Wife.Â  Wife then sold the house, made $25,000, and used the money to buy the 1955 Pfaff Drive property.Â  \r\nHusband did not present any testimony at the hearing,[2] and for the first time on appeal, he claims the parties purchased the property in Charlotte from Debra.Â  Because the only evidence in the record indicates Wife used proceeds from property she inherited to purchase the 1955 Pfaff Drive property, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s decision to award Wife a special equity interest in that property.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992) (explaining that the appellate courts consider the preponderance of the evidence when reviewing family court orders); see also Hough v. Hough, 312 S.C. 344, 347, 440 S.E.2d 387, 387 (Ct. App. 1994) (finding that husband could not complain on appeal about the valuation of the coupleâ€™s household goods when he presented no evidence regarding their valuation to the family court).\r\nAccordingly, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The partiesâ€™ marital home was also located on Pfaff Drive.\r\n[2] When the trial court announced that it was awarding a special equity interest to Wife, Husband did not request the right to re-open the testimony; rather, Husband only stated his intention to appeal the ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-077","title":"South Carolina Department of Social Services v.

[2] \r\nFACTS\r\nWillie Doe (Father) is the biological father of Brittany.Â  For the first twelve years of her life, Brittany had little contact with Father and lived with her mother.Â  When Brittanyâ€™s mother died in 2002, Brittany began living with Father and his wife, Vivian Doe, in South Carolina.Â  On September 22, 2003, the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) brought this action seeking custody of Brittany, alleging that Father sexually abused her.Â  DSS moved to allow the minor child to testify outside the presence of Father at trial.Â  \r\nIn consideration of the motion, expert testimony was presented by the childâ€™s therapist, who testified that requiring the child to testify in the presence of Father, a police officer, would be traumatic and might cause a regression in her functioning.Â  The therapist testified that the child had expressed anxiety about testifying in front of Father, saying she â€œdidnâ€™t know if she could handle [it]â€ because she was afraid of Father.Â  \r\nWithout objection from either party, the family court judge also heard testimony in camera with only the minor child and the guardian ad litem present.Â  The family court judge observed that the child was â€œextremely articulate in expressing her concerns about testifying with [Father] present.â€Â  The judge further noted that the child expressed, without solicitation, that this matter was a very serious concern for her and that she felt like she could testify more fully and freely if Father were absent.Â  Finding that she was afraid to testify in front of Father, and that requiring testimony under those circumstances would potentially negatively affect the child, the family court judge granted the motion to permit the child to testify outside Fatherâ€™s presence.Â Â Â  \r\nOnce the motion was granted, counsel for both parties agreed on the procedure for taking the childâ€™s testimony.Â  It was agreed that during the childâ€™s testimony at trial, Father would remain in an adjacent room in which he would be able to hear the proceedings via a speaker, and to knock on the door to stop the proceedings should he need to consult with his attorney.Â  The child then testified regarding the allegations, describing episodes of fondling, masturbation, and intercourse.Â  DSS presented corroborating testimony, and Father presented witnesses who testified on his behalf.Â  \r\nThe family court judge found that Father sexually abused his daughter and granted custody to DSS.Â  Father was ordered to pay child support and his name was entered in the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nFather argues his confrontation rights were violated by allowing his daughter to testify outside his presence, limiting his challenge on appeal to the claim that â€œthe evidence did not justify any legally sufficient necessity for doing so.â€Â  In criminal cases, the right of an accused to confront, face to face, witnesses against him at trial is constitutionally protected.[3]Â  Coy v. Iowa, 487 U.S. 1012, 1016 (1988); U.S. Const. amend. VI; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14.Â  â€œHistorically, the right of confrontation and cross examination has been held to apply in criminal prosecutions.â€&nbsp; State ex rel. Medlock v. Nest Egg Soc. Today, Inc.,&nbsp;290 S.C. 124, 130, 348 S.E.2d 381, 385&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986).Â  The right of confrontation has additionally found limited application in civil cases.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Social Services on Behalf of State of Tex. v. Holden, 319 S.C. 72, 78-79, 459 S.E.2d 846, 849-850 (1995).Â  The area of child abuse and neglectâ€”family court intervention proceedingsâ€”is one area where the right of confrontation is implicated.Â  The standard for criminal cases involving child witnesses, while not directly applicable, was found by our supreme court to provide useful guidance in establishing a standard for intervention proceedings in family court.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Social Services v. Wilson, 352 S.C. 445, 455, 574 S.E.2d 730, 735 (2002).\r\nThe Wilson court set forth the following guidelines.Â  First, the family court must make case-specific findings of need for special accommodations, and place those findings on the record.Â  Id.Â  The court may consider the childâ€™s age, mentality, and any other pertinent information, and should consider the testimony of the child and other relevant witnesses in making its determination.Â  Id.Â  Second, if the child witness is allowed to testify outside the defendantâ€™s presence, arrangements must be made to ensure that testimony is given in an environment that indicates the seriousness of the matter.Â  Id.Â  The defendant must be able to hear the childâ€™s testimony, and to confer with counsel, who must be able to cross-examine the child witness.Â  Id. at 455-56, 574 S.E.2d at 735.Â  \r\nBecause no objection was raised at trial to the procedure used during testimony in this case,[4] the only issue is whether the family courtâ€™s findings complied with Wilson.Â  The family court made case-specific findings on the record.Â  Although the findings could have been more fully developed, we find they were sufficient to satisfy the Wilson standard.Â  The judge considered expert testimony that the childâ€™s functioning and ability to testify would be adversely affected by the physical presence of Father in the courtroom.[5]Â  The judge considered the childâ€™s age, her concerns that she would not be able to testify freely with Father present, and the fact that her academic performance, which had suffered during the period the alleged incidents occurred but had progressively improved since then, might be adversely affected.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in the family court judgeâ€™s decision to permit the child to testify outside the presence of Father. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the family court complied with the Wilson standard in permitting the minor child to testify outside of Fatherâ€™s presence.Â  We thus find no abuse of discretion, and the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â We find the use of the name Doe is appropriate in light of the allegations and findings of sexual abuse.\r\n[2] Â Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[3] Â Even in criminal cases, however, this right must occasionally give way to considerations of public policy, such as the trauma suffered by a child victim of sexual abuse when testifying in the presence of the defendant.Â  Maryland v. Craig,&nbsp;497 U.S. 836, 857 (1990).Â  \r\n[4] Â The procedure used during trial was suggested by Fatherâ€™s attorney.Â  \r\n[5] Â Father did not object to the therapistâ€™s qualification as an expert witness.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-078","title":"Ballard v.

Goodson, of Fountain Inn, for Appellants.\r\n        W.

Hartman, of Greenville, Guardian ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Gerald Ballard and Linda Ballard (Grandparents) appeal from the family courtâ€™s order refusing to terminate the parental rights of their son, Jerald Wayne Ballard, Jr. (Father) and Maria Barbee Ballard (Mother) and in altering the previously ordered visitation schedule.Â  We affirm.\r\nFacts\r\nMother and Father were married in October of 1997.Â  On June 17, 1998, Christopher Wayne Ballard, was born to Mother and Father. Christian Marie Pearl Ballard was born on November 21, 2000.Â  Father began using drugs early in the marriage.Â  Eventually, Mother began using drugs. Â Mother and Father separated and reconciled numerous times.Â  In July of 2001, Mother asked Grandparents â€œto watch over the kids for [her] to go to the hospital and get some help to get clean.â€\r\nThere were approximately fifteen months, June 2002 to September 2003, when Mother had no contact with the children. Â According to Mother, when she was released from the hospital, Grandparents prevented her from seeing the children.Â  Mother attempted two interventions by the court to enforce her visitation rights.Â  Neither of these attempts were successful.Â  Mother admitted this period of time where she was out of contact with her children occurred during a time in which she was actively addicted to drugs.Â  It was difficult for Mother to maintain employment and an appropriate lifestyle. Â Mother claims she tried to speak to her children during this period of time.Â  The evidence is contradictory as to whether the children were being prevented from speaking to Mother.\r\nOn March 28, 2002, the family court granted custody of Christopher and Christian to Grandparents, with supervised visitation to Mother and Father from 1:00 p.m. until 4:00 p.m. every Sunday. Â The judge ordered that visitation was to be supervised by Margie Ballard, the paternal great-grandmother of the children.Â  The judge ordered Mother and Father to each pay $56.00 per week as child support.Â  Grandparents had custody of the minor children on a de facto basis since July 24, 2001.\r\nMother and Father paid no child support from January of 2002 until October of 2002.Â  According to the testimony, Father was not paying child support because he had already given up his parental rights in his mind by executing papers provided by Grandparents to this effect. Â Mother was incarcerated at least two times for failing to pay child support.\r\nOn December 31, 2002, the Grandparents brought this action for termination of parental rights of Mother and Father and for the adoption of Christopher and Christian.\r\nNeither Mother nor Father retained legal counsel or filed any responsive pleadings prior to September 24, 2003. Â Further, Father executed a document consenting to the termination of his parental rights and to adoption by Grandparents. Â This matter was scheduled for a hearing on September 24.Â  By order dated October 1, 2003, the court continued this matter because Mother had hired an attorney and informed the court she opposed termination of her parental rights. Â Motherâ€™s attorney filed an answer and counterclaim seeking increased visitation with the minor children.\r\nAt the final hearing, the family court judge heard numerous witnesses for each party, including testimony by the guardian ad litem and submission of a guardian ad litem report.Â  The court received documentary evidence.Â  Father was not present at the hearing and did not participate in any way.Â  The family court denied termination of parental rights of Mother and Father and altered the visitation schedule established by the March 28, 2002 order.Â  Grandparents filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied. \r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn a termination of parental rights (TPR) case, the paramount consideration is the best interests of the children.Â  See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Sims, 359 S.C. 601, 598 S.E.2d 303 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Grounds for TPR must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 513 S.E.2d 358 (1999); see also Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 747-48 (1982) (â€œBefore a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.â€).\r\nIn a TPR case, the appellate court may review the record and make its own findings of whether clear and convincing evidence supports termination.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 519 S.E.2d 351 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, our broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings below or ignore the fact that the trial judge was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nDiscussion\r\nI.Â  Termination of Parental Rights\r\nA.Â  Father\r\nGrandparents argue the family court erred by failing to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights where Father consented to the termination and adoption and â€œhad no contact with the minor children since birth.â€Â  We find this issue is not preserved for review.\r\n In declining to terminate Fatherâ€™s rights, the family court held: â€œI do find that the [Grandparents] have established their right to terminate the parental rights of [Father] and the minor children, but for the reasons expressed herein, the Court determines that it is not appropriate to terminate the natural fatherâ€™s parental rights, inasmuch as the parental rights of the natural mother have not been terminated.â€Â  In their Rule 59(e) motion, Grandparents fail to raise any issues regarding the family courtâ€™s ruling as to Father.Â  The issue regarding Fatherâ€™s consent to the termination is therefore not preserved for appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (requiring appellants to make a rule 59(e) motion requesting the trial court to rule upon an issue the trial court neglected in order to preserve the argument for appellate review).Â  Furthermore, in their brief to our court, Grandparents merely make a cursory argument regarding the family courtâ€™s failure to terminate Fatherâ€™s parental rights, and they cite to no authority for their position.Â  Thus, their arguments as to Father are deemed abandoned.Â  See State v. Addison, 338 S.C. 277, 285, 525 S.E.2d 901, 906 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œConclusory arguments constitute an abandonment of the issue on appeal.â€).Â  \r\nB.Â  Mother\r\nGrandparents argue the family court erred in failing to terminate Motherâ€™s parental rights.Â  Grandparents claim they proved Mother willfully failed to visit or support the minor children for periods in excess of six months.\r\nSection 20-7-1572(3) and (4) of the South Carolina Code provides:\r\nThe family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child:\r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n  (3) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to visit the child.Â  The court may attach little or no weight to incidental visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from visiting by the party having custody or by court order.Â  The distance of the childâ€™s placement from the parentâ€™s home must be taken into consideration when determining the ability to visit;\r\n  (4) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to support the child.Â  Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care.Â  A material contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means.Â  The court may consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3) &amp; (4) (Supp. 2005).Â  The court must find willfulness both in the failure to visit and the failure to support.\r\nWhether a parentâ€™s failure to visit or support a child is â€œwillfulâ€ within the meaning of Â§ 20-7-1572 is a question of intent to be determined from all the facts and circumstances in each case.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 413 S.E.2d 835 (1992).Â  The trial judge is given wide discretion in making this determination.Â  Id.Â  However, the element of wilfulness must be established by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 296 S.E.2d 338 (1982); South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 519 S.E.2d 351 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  A parentâ€™s conduct which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties may fairly be characterized as â€œwillfulâ€ because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.Â  Hamby v. Hamby, 264 S.C. 614, 216 S.E.2d 536 (1975).\r\nIn the instant case, the judge heard the testimony of Grandparents, the paternal great-grandmother, Mother, and a number of other witnesses.Â  The great-grandmotherâ€™s testimony showed that there were a couple of times when Mother tried to visit with the children around July of 2002 but there was some obstacle that prevented the visit, such as when great-grandmotherâ€™s sister was in the hospital. Â According to the great-grandmother and Mother, since September of 2003, Mother has exercised her visitation regularly.\r\nGrandparents admit to having notice of Motherâ€™s filing of a pro se motion for violation of visitation in November of 2002, even though they state in their testimony that the period that Mother failed to visit was from June of 2002 to September of 2003.Â  During this time, Mother telephoned three or four times and left messages on Grandparentsâ€™ voice mail, saying â€œhello, tell the children I love them.â€\r\nMother testified that she made child support payments in 2001, 2002, and 2003, as is demonstrated by the payment history submitted into evidence.Â  Â She denied willfully failing to pay support.Â  Over this three year period of time, Mother paid over $6000 in child support, even though during much of this time she was unemployed.Â  During this time, Grandparents required no support from Father. Â There is nothing in the record to indicate Grandparents specifically requested support from either Mother or Father.Â  Section 20-7-1572(4) specifically states that the court â€œmay consider all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the ability of the parent to provide support.â€Â  As of the date of the hearing in this case, although she was still in arrears, Mother was making steady routine child support payments.Â  The payment records indicate Mother has been consistent in making payments once she obtained employment.\r\nThe guardian ad litem stated: â€œI think [Motherâ€™s] extremely tenacious and sheâ€™s gone a lot further than a lot of others that Iâ€™ve seen in the same situation.â€ Â The guardian declared: â€œIâ€™ve been doing Guardian work for seven years and I think sheâ€™s probably the most rehabilitat[ed] defendant Iâ€™ve ever met.Â  She is completely convincing.Â  Sheâ€™s completely honest and forthright.Â  She doesnâ€™t hide anything from me.â€Â  The guardian felt Mother had been â€œtotally honestâ€ with her.\r\nThe court held: â€œI find that it is not appropriate to terminate the parental rights of [Mother], in and to her children by the facts presented at this hearing.Â  I find [Mother] has fully rehabilitated herself as to prior drug problems.â€Â  The judge further declared: â€œ[Mother] has presented a strong case that she has totally turned her life around and has made excellent progress in her life.Â  She is now working full-time at Wal-Mart.Â  She has been drug free for many months.Â  She is fully participating in an intensive lifestyle changing program at her church, which appears to be very successful.â€Â  The judge noted: â€œ[T]he guardian ad litem in this case states that she has not seen such a total turn around in a case such as this in her entire seven (7) years of guardian ad litem experience.â€ Â The judge stated â€œthe payment records indicate that [Mother] has been consistent in making payments once she obtained employment.â€ Â The judge found: â€œ[O]n these facts, there has been no willful failure to visit by [Mother] nor is there a willful failure to provide support.â€\r\nThe family court judge did not err in finding Grandparents did not prove, by clear and convincing evidence, the willful failure to visit or the willful failure to provide support to the minor children.\r\nII.Â  Visitation Schedule\r\nGrandparents argue the family court erred â€œin altering the previously ordered visitation schedule.â€Â  Grandparents claim the court further erred in failing to alter the visitation schedule to accommodate the activities of the minor children because, on motion to alter or amend, Grandparents â€œshowed modification of the visitation schedule by the court interfered with activities of at least one of the minor children.â€\r\nThe court held: â€œI find it appropriate that visitation for [Mother] shall be increased from the present three (3) hours on alternating Sundays to three (3) Saturdays per month from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m.Â  Visitation should be accomplished on the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Saturdays of the month.Â  The [Grandparents] and [Mother] shall exchange the child for visitation purposes at the Hardees Restaurant in Fountain Inn , South Carolina . . . .â€Â  It is within the courtâ€™s discretion to alter the visitation schedule in light of the dramatic change in circumstances.Â  Mother has a good job at Wal-Mart and has rehabilitated herself in a significant way.\r\nThe record does not disclose any conflicting extracurricular activities of the minor children from the expanded visitation ordered by the court.Â  Therefore, it is appropriate for the court to deny the reconsideration motion of the Grandparents.\r\nConclusion\r\nAccordingly, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-079","title":"Ffrench v.

maintenance (the Decree).Â  On appeal, Wife contends the family court erred in failing to grant a continuance and in finding Wife owed Adolph Ffrench (Husband) $59,770.82 pursuant to the Decree.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife married on May 2, 1975, and the couple separated on June 11, 2002.Â  Wife filed a complaint in the family court requesting a decree of separate maintenance.Â  Husband and Wife reached an agreement (the Agreement) on September 30, 2002 that provided, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  [Wife] agrees to give [Husband] forty nine (49 %) percent her [sic] share in the Corporation [Bevad], Inc.Â  The corporation [sic] sole asset is the property located at 308 Whitehurst Way, Columbia, SC 29229 with an approximate value of $110,000.00.Â  The parties agree to share the proceeds of the sale: 51% to [Wife] and 49 % to [Husband].\r\n\r\nThe family court held a hearing, at which Husband and Wife presented the Agreement to the court for approval.Â  On February 7, 2003, the family court issued the Decree, which provided, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  The marital residence which is titled in the corporate name of Bevad, Inc., shall be sold and the net proceeds of the sale shall be divided between the parties.Â  [Wife] shall receive fifty one (51 %) percent of the net proceeds of sale and [Husband] shall receive forty nine (49 %) percent of the net proceeds of sale.\r\n\r\nThe Decree incorporated the Agreement, which the family court attached.Â  On March 28, 2003, Bevad, Inc. sold the property at Whitehurst Way and received $121,981.28 in net proceeds.Â  Wife signed the settlement statement as the president of Bevad, Inc. \r\nOn October 9, 2003, Husband and Wife again appeared before the family court, this time to receive a final divorce decree.Â  Wife testified at this hearing that all financial matters had been dealt with by the Decree, and further affirmed that â€œ[t]hereâ€™s nothing left to be exchanged . . . .â€Â  On cross-examination, Husbandâ€™s attorney asked Wife about the sale of the property.Â  Wife explained it had been sold in March of 2003, and Husband received his share of the proceeds in April of 2003.Â  Furthermore, she testified a check was written to him from Bevad, Inc., and he cashed the check.[2]Â  The family court granted a divorce, but did not address the issue of outstanding financial obligations between the parties.\r\nOn August 4, 2004, Husband filed a complaint and rule to show cause in the family court, alleging Wife violated the Decree.Â  On August 9, 2004, the family court issued a rule to show cause, ordering Wife to appear and explain why she should not be held in contempt of the Decree.Â  The family court held a hearing on August 24, 2004, at which Wife appeared pro se. \r\nAt the hearing, Husband testified he received no money from the sale of the property and no one else owned an interest in the property.Â  Wife asserted she deposited $27,005.04 of the proceeds in Husbandâ€™s bank account with South Carolina Federal Credit Union.Â  However, she also indicated she took $24,000 of that money out of the account and transferred it into a certificate of deposit (COD) in Husbandâ€™s name.Â  A bank statement shows a deposit of $27,000.00, and a withdrawal four days later of $24,000.00.Â  Wife admitted she authorized the transfer to the COD, but she provided no documents evidencing the COD at the hearing. \r\nAs an explanation for why she only transferred $27,000 to Husband, Wife initially asserted she had to pay all of the people from whom she borrowed the money to buy the property.Â  She explained she had proof of these loans, but did not bring it to court.Â  Later at the hearing, Wife testified the corporation owned the property, she only owned fifty-one percent of the corporation, the coupleâ€™s son owned the other forty-nine percent of the corporation, and their son received his proceeds.[3]\r\nOn September 14, 2004, the family court issued an order finding Wife in willful contempt of the Decree.Â  The order stated: â€œThe parties testified that although the former marital home was titled in the name of Bevad, Inc. that this was a corporation completely owned by [Husband and Wife], and this property was used as the marital residence and it was in their control.â€Â  The order further stated the terms of the Decree were clear and unambiguous, and Wife was required under its terms to pay Husband forty-nine percent of the sale proceeds, which equaled $59,770.82.\r\nThe family court sentenced Wife to ten days in the Richland County Detention Center, suspended upon the payment of $59,770.82 to Husband by November 1, 2004, and attorneysâ€™ fees to Husband by December 1, 2004.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife contends the family court erred in denying her a continuance at the contempt hearing.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nAn issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.Â  Floyd v. Floyd,&nbsp;365 S.C. 56, 73, 615 S.E.2d 465, 474&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  At the contempt hearing, the following colloquy took place between the family court and Wife:\r\n\r\n  The court: Did you have time to get an attorney?\r\n  Ms. Ffrench: No; I did not, I got papers on Thursday night, I was at the hospital on Friday, and I have documentation to prove that.Â  My blood pressure was 180/106, I was having trembling in my arm, andâ€”\r\n  The court: Okay.\r\n  Ms. Ffrench: So, I brought what I have to prove to the court.\r\n  The court: Okay; you may proceed.\r\n\r\nEven assuming Wife properly raised the issue of a continuance to the family court, she did not assert a legal basis for this motion, and the judge did not make a ruling.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nWife also argues the family court erred in finding she owed $59,770.82 in accordance with the Decree.Â  Specifically, Wife argues the family court erred in interpreting the Decree.Â  We disagree.\r\nA contempt hearing lies in equity, and an appellate court may thus make its own findings of fact.Â  See Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 340, 491 S.E.2d 583, 589&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997) (â€œInasmuch as this [action for contempt] is an action in equity, we may make our own findings of fact.â€).Â  â€œHowever, we are not required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996).\r\nWife testified at the contempt hearing that her son owned forty-nine percent of Bevad, Inc., and she had to pay people who loaned her money to purchase the property.Â  However, Wifeâ€™s testimony is the only evidence of either of these assertions. Â Based on its findings, the family court clearly gave Wifeâ€™s testimony no credence.Â  Wife previously testified that Husband cashed a check written to him from Bevad, Inc.Â  In the contempt hearing, however, she testified the proceeds of the sale were put into a checking account to which she had access.Â  Wife never offered any explanation for the inconsistencies in these two statements.Â  Wifeâ€™s equivocations support the family courtâ€™s refusal to give any credibility to her bald assertion that her son owns an interest in Bevad, Inc., or that she had to pay creditors with respect to the sale of the property.Â  We find the family court properly disregarded Wifeâ€™s testimony in interpreting the Decree.Â  We therefore hold the family court did not err in finding Wife owed $59,770.82 in accordance with the Decree.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Husband did not appear at this hearing, but his attorney appeared on his behalf.\r\n[3] In the record on appeal, Wife included the affidavit of her son, Bradley M. Ffrench, corroborating this testimony.Â  However, Rule 210(c), SCACR, provides â€œ[t]he Record [on Appeal] shall not . . . include matter which was not presented to the lower court or tribunal.â€Â  Therefore, we give this affidavit no efficacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-081","title":"Johnson v.

Hughston, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-0081\r\nHeard February 7, 2006 â€“ Filed February 10, 2006\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Kirsten L. Barr, of Mt. Pleasant, for Appellants.\r\n        Stephen B. Samuels, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â In this Workersâ€™ Compensation case, the employer, Santee Cooper, and its insurance carrier, South Carolina Public Service Authority (collectively referred to as Santee Cooper) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the appellate panelâ€™s rulings that Robert David Johnson (1) sustained a compensable back injury caused by the repetitive trauma of his job at Santee Cooper; (2) gave timely notice to Santee Cooper of his back injury; and (3) was entitled to temporary disability benefits.Â  We affirm.\r\nFacts\r\nIn 1991, Johnson began working as an Equipment Operator I with Santee Cooper.Â  He was eventually promoted to Equipment Operator III.Â  That job required operating heavy equipment used to clear the right of way for power lines.Â  Johnson had a part-time seasonal job with Rickenbaker Cotton Gin and was a volunteer firefighter.Â  At Rickenbaker, Johnson ran the office, did paperwork on the bale weights, and occasionally drove a truck.\r\nIn March of 2000, Johnson underwent back surgery.Â  The surgery was not claimed under Workersâ€™ Compensation.Â  Johnson returned to work with no restrictions in May of 2000.\r\nAround late September or early October of 2001, Johnson was transferred to the â€œVersatileâ€ crew.Â  A Versatile is similar to a log skidder with big tires and a big cutting deck.Â  Johnsonâ€™s job required operating the Versatile on â€œrough swampy areas.â€Â  A month or two after Johnson started on the Versatile, about November 2001, he informed David Duke, his crew leader, he was having â€œextreme back painâ€ and asked Duke to take him off the Versatile.Â  He told Duke he thought running the Versatile was causing his back pain because of the way it rocks and bounces all the time.Â  According to Johnson, Duke refused to take him off the Versatile, telling Johnson he had no one else to run it.\r\nJohnsonâ€™s back problems worsened.Â  On December 7, 2001, he returned to Dr. Kenneth S. Kammer, the surgeon who performed his first back surgery.Â  At that time, Johnson was having â€œextreme back pain.â€Â  Dr. Kammer advised Johnson he would need another operation and gave him a letter to take to Santee Cooper advising he would be out for surgery.Â  A day or two later, Johnson gave the letter to Duke.Â  He also gave the letter to Benjamin Baggette, a â€œ[s]upervisor right of way clearing,â€ who â€œsent it to medical.â€\r\nJohnson had his surgery on January 3, 2002.Â  After his surgery, Johnson retained a lawyer.Â  His attorney mailed a letter to the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission and Santee Cooper filing Johnsonâ€™s claim on February 27, 2002.\r\nOn March 4, 2002, Johnson had a meeting at Santee Cooper with Baggette, Duke, and Joe Hutchinson.Â  Hutchinson is a senior safety specialist with Santee Cooper.Â  At the meeting, Hutchinson asked Johnson about making a Workersâ€™ Compensation claim.Â  Johnson told the men he hurt his back operating the Versatile and that was the reason for his claim.Â  Johnson stated he had told Duke the previous fall about the Versatile bothering his back and asked Duke to take him off the Versatile.\r\nSantee Cooper filed a 12-A listing the date of injury as December 7, 2001, with notice being given at the safety meeting on March 1, 2002.Â  Santee Cooper denied the claim based on lack of notice.\r\nDr. Kammer kept Johnson out of work or on light duty until at least January 2003.Â  Johnson was restricted to no lifting greater than thirty pounds.Â  His job description required lifting up to fifty pounds.Â  Johnson was unable to return to work as an equipment operator because of his work restrictions.Â  Santee Cooper had no work within his restrictions.Â  Johnson returned to light duty work at Rickenbaker Cotton Gin on August 8, 2002.\r\nThe single commissioner determined the claim was compensable and found: â€œ[D]ue to the repetitive trauma attendant to his operation of the â€œVersatile,â€ [Johnson] suffered compensable injuries by accident to his lower back and left leg (radiculopathy). This injury was an aggravation of a pre-existing condition.â€Â  The commissioner awarded causally related medical treatment and temporary disability compensation from January 3, 2002 through December 18, 2002.Â  The single commissioner made no conclusions of law.Â  The appellate panel affirmed with modifications.Â  The appellate panel added Conclusions of Law.Â  The panel amended the award of temporary partial disability during the period when Johnson had not reached maximum medical improvement, but had returned to light duty work at his second job.Â  The circuit court affirmed the order of the appellate panel in its entirety.\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe substantial evidence rule of the Administrative Procedures Act governs the standard of review in a Workersâ€™ Compensation decision.Â  Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 593 S.E.2d 491 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  An appellate court must affirm the findings of fact made by the appellate panel if they are supported by substantial evidence and not controlled by legal error.Â  Tiller v. National Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 513 S.E.2d 843 (1999); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 594 S.E.2d 272 (2004).Â  The findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001).Â  It is not within our province to reverse findings of the appellate panel which are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Broughton v. South of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 520 S.E.2d 634 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nDiscussion\r\nI.Â  Repetitive Trauma Injury\r\nSantee Cooper argues the circuit court erred in affirming the appellate panelâ€™s finding that due to the repetitive trauma of operating the Versatile, Johnson suffered a compensable injury to his back.Â  Santee Cooper claims â€œ[t]here is absolutely no evidence in the record that [Johnson] suffered any back injury while working for Santee Cooper.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, a repetitive trauma injury is compensable under the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  See Pee v. AVM, Inc., 352 S.C. 167, 573 S.E.2d 785 (2002).Â  Further, back injuries caused by repetitive trauma are compensable when supported by substantial evidence.Â  See White v. Medical University of South Carolina, 355 S.C. 560, 586 S.E.2d 157 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Repetitive trauma injuries have a gradual onset caused by the cumulative effect of repetitive traumatic events or â€œmini-accidents.â€Â  Schurlknight v. City of North Charleston, 352 S.C. 175, 574 S.E.2d 194 (2002).Â  It is well established that causation can be proven by both expert and lay testimony.Â  Tiller v. National Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 513 S.E.2d 843 (1999).Â  Indeed, lay testimony of the employee unsupported by any medical evidence can be sufficient to support the finding of a causal connection.Â  Id.; Arnold v. Benjamin Booth Co., 257 S.C. 337, 185 S.E.2d 830 (1971).\r\nThere is substantial evidence to support the appellate panelâ€™s finding that, â€œ[d]ue to the repetitive trauma of operating the Versatile, [Johnson] aggravated his pre-existing back condition.â€\r\nFollowing Johnsonâ€™s first back surgery in March 2000, he was cleared to work full duty with no restrictions by Dr. Kammer.Â  Johnson had no complaints throughout the remainder of 2000 and most of 2001.Â  About one or two months after Johnson began working on the Versatile in the fall of 2001, Johnson started â€œhaving extreme, more harder back pain . . .Â  in the low of [his] backâ€ and experienced some numbness in his left leg.Â  The pain â€œc[a]me on gradually.â€Â  Johnson told Duke he was having â€œback painsâ€ and â€œwanted to get off of [the Versatile].â€Â  Johnson specifically informed Duke his back pain was caused by â€œ[r]unning the Versatile, because [of] the way it rocks and bounces on me all the time . . . [o]n the rough terrain on the right-of-ways itâ€™s more bouncier, itâ€™s not more comfortable than the tractors.â€Â  Duke confirmed the Versatile was a â€œbumpy ride.â€\r\nJohnson saw Dr. Kammer regarding his back problems on December 7, 2001.Â  After an examination, Dr. Kammer immediately recommended back surgery.Â  The exacerbation of the back pain by Johnsonâ€™s job is documented in Dr. Kammerâ€™s report of December 7, 2001:\r\n\r\n  He is a heavy equipment operator for Santee Cooper and works heavy equipment mostly in a sitting position. . . . He understood that the primary purpose of surgery [in 2000] was to get rid of the sciatic pain but that it would not necessarily prevent future back pain especially in a heavy industrial job. . . . His pain is primarily exacerbated by long periods of sitting . . . He has not missed any work but he has a lot of discomfort at work.\r\n\r\nDr. Kammer signed off on a Santee Cooper Industrial Work Availability Form (IWA) on July 17, 2002.Â  The IWA contained a question asking whether the injury was work-related.Â  The form was marked â€œyes.â€Â  The form had a space after the word â€œyesâ€ for a brief description, in which was written â€œBack pain.â€Â  On July 22, 2002, an internal Santee Cooper e-mail was sent from Lynne Jamison to Baggette noting receipt of â€œIWA from Dr. Kammerâ€ and stating â€œ[t]he IWA also indicated that his back pain was work related.â€Â  Santee Cooper pointed out that two earlier IWAs indicated the problem was not work-related.Â  However, Duke admitted he may have checked that the problem was not work-related on these two earlier forms. \r\nSubstantial evidence supports the appellate panelâ€™s finding that Johnson sustained a compensable injury to his back as a result of the repetitive trauma of operating the Versatile in his job at Santee Cooper.\r\nII.Â  Statutory Notice\r\nSantee Cooper maintains the appellate panelâ€™s finding that Johnson satisfied the statutory notice requirement is not supported by substantial evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 42-15-20 of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act requires that every injured employee or his representative give the employer notice of a job-related accident within ninety days after its occurrence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985).Â  In applying section 42-15-20 to a repetitive trauma injury, the appellate panel shall determine the statutory notice requirement from the time of disablement of the claimant.Â  Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 617 S.E.2d 369 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Notice begins to run when the employee becomes disabled and could discover with reasonable diligence his condition is compensable.Â  Id.Â  The burden is upon the claimant to show compliance with the notice provisions of section 42-15-20.Â  Id.\r\nJohnson testified that, a month or two after Johnson started on the Versatile, he informed Duke he was experiencing back pain and asked Duke to take him off the Versatile.Â  Johnson declared that Duke denied his request.Â  On March 4, 2002, Johnson attended a meeting at Santee Cooper with Baggette, Duke, and Hutchinson.Â  At the meeting, Hutchinson asked Johnson about his injury, how it happened, and about making a Workersâ€™ Compensation claim.Â  When Hutchinson asked Johnson whether he told anyone at Santee Cooper about hurting his back, Johnson responded: â€œI spoke with David Duke about it . . . [and] asked him to take me off the machine.â€Â  According to Johnson, Duke â€œverified that [Johnson] asked him to take [Johnson] off of [the Versatile]â€ in the fall before the surgery.Â  In addition, Baggette stated that, at the meeting, Johnson advised Baggette that in the fall of 2001 he told Duke about the Versatile bothering his back.Â  Baggette further professed that Duke â€œverified . . . that that fall before [Johnson] had the surgery he had told Duke about the Versatile bothering his back.â€Â  Although Duke did not deny he and Johnson had a conversation in October 2001 about the Versatile hurting Johnsonâ€™s back, Duke stated he did not â€œrecallâ€ Johnson reporting this information to him.\r\nOn cross-examination, the following colloquy occurred between defense counsel and Johnson:\r\n\r\n  Q:Â  When you took [Duke Dr. Kammerâ€™s December 7, 2001] letter, did you tell him then that your problems were work related or that your surgery was caused by your employment at Santee Cooper? \r\n  A.Â  Not right then at that point in time.Â  It was a couple weeks later that I talked to him about that. . . . It was before surgery right after I gave him that letter.\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . . \r\n  Q.Â  What specifically did you tell [Duke]?\r\n  A.Â  That I wantâ€”this oneâ€™s going to be covered under Workmenâ€™s Comp. and he was going to look into it.\r\n\r\nSubstantial evidence supports the appellate panelâ€™s finding that Johnson gave timely notice to Santee Cooper of his injury.\r\nIII.Â  Temporary Disability Benefits\r\nSantee Cooper argues the appellate panel erred in awarding Johnson temporary disability benefits because â€œthere is no evidence to support a finding that [Johnson] was incapable of earning his pre-accident wages after April 29, 2002.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nThe appellate panel awarded Johnson temporary disability benefits from January 3, 2002 through December 18, 2002.Â  It is undisputed that Johnson was under work restrictions during the period from January 3, 2002 through December 18, 2002.Â  On July 17, 2002, Dr. Kammer filled out Santee Cooperâ€™s own IWA form.Â  Dr. Kammer wrote: â€œThis employee has been unable to work since January â€˜02 [and] will be able to return to full-duty work on possibly January â€™03.â€Â  Dr. Kammer further noted: â€œLight duty only.Â  May not lift or carry more than thirty pounds (30 lbs.).Â  Will reassess patient in Decemberâ€™02.â€Â  On the same form, Duke noted a fifty pound lifting requirement and indicated no light duty work was available.\r\nJohnson was on light duty and Santee Cooper offered no employment within Johnsonâ€™s restrictions.Â  Santee Cooper contends, notwithstanding its failure to offer suitable employment, that â€œ[h]aving failed to make any effort to secure employment, [Johnson] cannot satisfy his burden of proof that he is entitled to any temporary disability compensation.â€Â  This assertion is meritless.\r\nThe Workersâ€™ Compensation Act provides that the employer must either offer suitable employment within the injured workerâ€™s capacity, or pay temporary total disability compensation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-190 (1985); Last v. MSI Constr. Co., 305 S.C. 349, 409 S.E.2d 334 (1991).Â  An employer is required to pay temporary compensation â€œ[w]hen the incapacity for work resulting from an injury is total.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10 (Supp. 2005).Â  The term â€œdisabilityâ€ is defined as â€œincapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury in the same or any other employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-120 (1985).Â  â€œDisability is presumed to continue until the employee returns to work.â€Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-502(B)(2) (Supp. 2005); 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-506(A) (Supp. 2005).Â  Temporary total disability benefits are available up until the date of maximum medical improvement.Â  See Hendricks v.

Miller, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-082\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2006 â€“ Filed February 10, 2006Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        David Lloyd Thomas, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia, and Solicitor Robert Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this bond estreatment case, Safety National, Surety for South Carolina Bonding Company (Safety National), appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order finding that Abdul Dunham violated the terms of his bond and ordering a partial estreatment of the bond to the State.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nDunham was arrested and charged with trafficking in crack cocaine and possession with intent to distribute marijuana.Â  Shortly thereafter, Dunham was released from custody when the South Carolina Bonding Company signed a $65,000 surety bond on September 30, 2002.Â  \r\nOn May 12, 2003, the circuit court issued a bench warrant for Dunhamâ€™s arrest when, after proper notice, he failed to appear in court on that date.Â  On June 10, 2003, the circuit court issued a conditional order to estreat Dunhamâ€™s bond unless the South Carolina Bonding Company appeared on July 11, 2003, to show cause why the bond should not be remitted in whole or in part.Â  At the hearing, Dunhamâ€™s counsel claimed that Dunham, who lived in New Jersey, did not appear in court on the scheduled date because he did not receive a roll call notification card until after he was supposed to appear.Â  Counsel further explained that three days later, on May 15, 2003, Dunham appeared in court for another scheduled roll call.Â  Based on these circumstances, counsel argued that Dunham had complied with the conditions of his bond and, thus, the bond should not be estreated.\r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court ordered that $20,000 of the bond be estreated to the State on the ground Dunham failed to comply with the conditions of the bond.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSafety National asserts the circuit court erred in confirming a partial estreatment of Dunhamâ€™s bond against the South Carolina Bonding Company.Â  In support of this assertion, Safety National argues the circuit court failed to consider the requisite factors before reaching its decision.Â  Additionally, Safety National contends that Dunhamâ€™s failure to appear at a single roll call was insignificant given Dunham appeared three days later and the only cost incurred by the State in this case was the issuance of a bench warrant.Â Â  \r\nSection 38-53-70 of the South Carolina Code outlines the procedure governing bond forfeitures.Â  This section provides:\r\n\r\n  If a defendant fails to appear at a court proceeding to which he has been summoned, the court must issue a bench warrant for the defendant.Â  If the surety fails to surrender the defendant or place a hold on the defendantâ€™s release from incarceration, commitment, or institutionalization within thirty days of the issuance of the bench warrant, the bond shall be forfeited.Â  At any time before execution is issued on a judgment of forfeiture against a defendant or his surety, the court may direct that the judgment be remitted in whole or in part, upon conditions as the court may impose, if it appears that justice requires the remission of part or all of the judgment.Â  In making a determination as to remission of the judgment, the court shall consider the costs to the State or any county or municipality resulting from the necessity to continue or terminate the defendantâ€™s trial and the efforts of law enforcement officers or agencies to locate the defendant.Â  The court in its discretion may permit the surety to pay the estreatment in installments for a period of up to six months . . . . If at any time during the period in which installments are to be paid the defendant is surrendered to the appropriate detention facility and the surety complies with the re-commitment procedures, the surety is relieved of any further liability.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-70 (Supp. 2005).\r\nâ€œThe issue of whether a bond forfeiture should be remitted, and if so, to what extent, is vested in the discretion of the trial judge.â€Â  Ex parte Polk, 354 S.C. 8, 11, 579 S.E.2d 329, 330 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œ[T]he exercise of that discretion by the trial judge will not be set aside unless it is made to appear that it was abused.â€Â  State v. Holloway, 262 S.C. 552, 555, 206 S.E.2d 822, 823 (1974).Â  â€œAmong the factors to be considered in determining whether and to what extent relief will be granted are (1) the purpose of the bond; (2) the nature and wilfulness of the default; [and] (3) any prejudice or additional expense resulting to the State.â€Â  State v. Workman, 274 S.C. 341, 343, 263 S.E.2d 865, 866 (1980).\r\nWe find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a partial estreatment of Dunhamâ€™s bond.Â  Dunhamâ€™s release on bond was conditioned upon his appearance in court on the dates set by the State.Â  Although Dunhamâ€™s counsel claimed Dunham appeared in court on May 15, 2003, this appearance was three days after the scheduled date of May 12, 2003.Â  Because Dunham failed to appear on the scheduled date, he violated a condition of his bond.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-20 (2003) (â€œEvery appearance recognizance or appearance bond will be conditioned on the person charged personally appearing before the court specified to answer the charge or indictment and to do and receive what shall be enjoined by the court, and not to depart the State, and to be of good behavior toward all the citizens thereof, or especially toward any person or persons specified by the court.â€).\r\nAs a result of Dunhamâ€™s default, Safety National became liable and, in turn, subject to forfeiture of the bond.Â  See Pride v. Anders, 266 S.C. 338, 341, 223 S.E.2d 184, 186 (1976) (â€œ[T]he obligation of appellant-surety was not to the State to produce defendants at the time to be later set, but was rather an obligation to answer, to the extent of the penalty, for the default of the defendants, as principals, in the event they did not appear on the date set for trial.Â  When the defendants defaulted by their failure to appear, the liability of the appellant, as surety, became fixed.â€); Ex parte Polk, 354 S.C. at 11, 579 S.E.2d at 330 (â€œAs guarantor, the surety on an appearance bond undertakes the risk of forfeiture in the event the defendant does not appear for trial.â€).\r\nThe question then becomes to what extent relief should have been granted due to the default.Â  Despite the circuit courtâ€™s failure to specifically enunciate either orally or in its written order the requisite factors, we find the court properly exercised its discretion in partially estreating the bond.Â  We believe implicit in the courtâ€™s ruling was a consideration of the factors.Â  First, Dunhamâ€™s failure to appear at the scheduled date or at the hearing date violated the purpose of the appearance bond.Â  Secondly, Safety National offered no explanation as to why Dunham was not transported from New Jersey to South Carolina on the date of the bond estreatment hearing.Â  Finally, we reject Safety Nationalâ€™s assertion that the State was not prejudiced by Dunhamâ€™s failure to appear at a single roll call.Â Â  Dunhamâ€™s failure to appear on May 12, 2003, in conjunction with Safety National failure to present Dunham at the hearing, created a delay for the State sufficient to constitute prejudice.Â  Holloway, 262 S.C. at 557, 206 S.E.2d at 824 (â€œCertainly, prejudice to the State appears when a defendant, without excuse, fails to appear at the time set for trial, thereby obstructing and delaying the orderly administration of justice.â€).Â  Furthermore, given the circuit court only estreated $20,000 of the $65,000 bond, we find the amount estreated was not so excessive to constitute an abuse of discretion.\r\nAccordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-083","title":"Powell v.

Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 417, 586 S.E.2d 111, 113 (2003) (â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached to justify its action.â€ (quoting Howell v. Pacific Columbia Mills, 291 S.C. 469, 354 S.E.2d 384 (1987))).Â  Thus, the mere presence of some evidence supporting the position of an appellant does not entitle the appellant to a reversal of the Commissionâ€™s decision.Â  It is the absence of substantial evidence supporting the Commissionâ€™s decision that entitles an appellant to relief.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981) (finding that the Commissionâ€™s decision will not be overturned unless unsupported by substantial evidence). \r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reviewed the record and conclude substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s determination that the employer failed to establish that it offered suitable employment to the claimant.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-084","title":"McKee v.

Harrill and Andrew G. Melling, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant Jesse C. Brown appeals the Master-in-Equityâ€™s order declaring Respondent Caroline C. McKee the owner of a twenty-seven acre tract of land.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThis action involves a dispute between Brown and McKee over the ownership of a twenty-seven-acre tract of land in Lexington County.Â  The tract lies between Brownâ€™s and McKeeâ€™s properties.Â  Brownâ€™s land is north of the tract, and McKeeâ€™s parcel is to the south.Â  McKeeâ€™s land includes some 340 acres which she inherited from her parents in 1973.Â  Brown has sold his land with the exception of the twenty-seven acres which he claims.Â  \r\nMcKee commenced this action to quiet title claiming to be the legal owner of the parcel.Â  She additionally claimed the land through adverse possession and acquiescence.Â  The matter was referred to a Lexington County Master-in-Equity.Â  The master found that McKee was the record owner of the tract, and that even if Brown had ever owned the property, McKee had proven ownership by adverse possession and acquiescence.Â  \r\nMcKee presented documentation dating back to 1929 which demonstrated her predecessors in title divided the property she now owns into four tracts.Â  The northern-most of the four tracts was a fifty-acre parcel which borders Brownâ€™s land.Â  The deeds refer to a family home place, or â€œold dwelling,â€ situated approximately 200 yards from a family cemetery.Â  McKee and witness Franklin Corley each testified that their uncle, O.C. Crout, lived in the home place in the 1930s and 1940s.Â  Both McKee and Corley remembered visiting their uncle at the home place.Â Â Â  \r\nMcKee entered into evidence a plat worksheet from 1929 which references the 1929 deed that conveyed the fifty-acre parcel from Sarah Crout to O.C. Crout.Â  Grover and Gladys Corley purchased the 340 acres, which included the disputed parcel, in 1948.Â  In 1969, Grover Corley leased the home place and surrounding property to a motorcycle club. Â After the land passed to McKee, she employed Westvaco, Inc. to plant, grow, and harvest timber on the disputed tract.Â  In 1978, Westvaco clear cut the twenty-seven acres and planted six-inch seedling pine trees.Â  \r\nA deed in Brownâ€™s chain of title lists the property as consisting of 139 acres and belonging to Thad Shealy.Â  In 1949, Shealy conveyed 157 acres to J. Collie Amick, ostensibly selling more land than he had received.Â  The 1949 plat states that it copies a 1920 plat, yet it inexplicably changes the southern boundary of the 139-acre parcel, increasing the tract to 157 acres.Â  All deeds after 1949 refer to Brownâ€™s tract as consisting of 157 acres.\r\nBrown and McKee are both in their late 60s or early 70s, and they both grew up around the property in question.Â  As long as either party can recall, a fence has existed along the northern boundary of the twenty-seven acres and the southern boundary of Brownâ€™s land.Â  Brown subdivided and sold all of his property north of the fence prior to this lawsuit.Â  However, heÂ  never attempted to subdivide or sell the disputed tract. Indeed, McKee introduced the deeds and surveys showing that Brown has sold over 150 acres of his property.Â  \r\nThe property in question has been surveyed numerous times throughout the years.Â  In 1988 George Todd performed a survey of McKeeâ€™s land and provided her with a plat.Â  Todd discovered a discrepancy in the tax maps, which indicated Brown owned the twenty-seven acre tract.Â  \r\nSubsequently, Brown hired Mike Arant to survey the disputed tract.Â  Arant testified that Brown directed him to prepare a survey of a specific tax map parcel; he was not asked to research ownership issues.Â  In performing the survey, Arant placed two markers along the southern boundary of the disputed parcel.Â  He then discovered a survey which indicated McKeeâ€™s father, Grover Corley, was the owner of the twenty-seven acres.Â  Arant testified that he determined McKee was the rightful owner of the property, and upon informing Brown of his discovery, Arant was told not to complete his survey.Â  Arant did not remove the two markers which he claims he erroneously placed along the southern boundary.Â  \r\nIn 2001, McKee hired Cobb to survey her property.Â  Cobb did not utilize the deeds given to McKee or Brown, and he did not refer to the 1920 survey of Brownâ€™s property or the 1929 survey of McKeeâ€™s land.Â  Cobb relied on the property markers erroneously placed by Arant.Â  Ultimately he redrew the tax map, omitting the home place from McKeeâ€™s property and leaving her with 308 acres.Â  McKee disagreed with Cobbâ€™s survey and commenced this action against Brown.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nInitially, Brown asserts this is an appeal from an equitable action and that this Court may find facts in accordance with our own view of the evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe instant case involves an action at law, not equity.Â  As stated by this Court in Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 331 S.C. 398, 416, 503 S.E.2d 191, 200 (Ct. App. 1998), â€œWhile an action to quiet title is usually one in equity, the main purpose of the complaint determines the character of the action.â€Â  â€œThe determination of title to real property is a legal issue.â€Â Â  Wigfall v. Fobbs, 259 S.C. 59, 367 S.E.2d 156 (1988) (citing May v. Jeter, 245 S.C. 529, 141 S.E.2d 655 (1965); Capell v. Moses, 36 S.C. 559, 15 S.E. 711 (1892)); see also Eldridge, 331 S.C. 398, 503 S.E.2d 191.Â  â€œTherefore, in a case tried without a jury, the factual findings of a judge regarding title will not be disturbed on appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Wigfall at 60-61, 367 S.E.2d at 157; see also Townes Assâ€™n v. The City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976) (â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€).\r\n Accordingly, our inquiry is limited whether the evidence reasonably supports the masterâ€™s findings.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTitle\r\nMcKee presented evidence that she inherited 340 acres from her parents.Â  Absent the disputed tract, she would be left with only 308 acres.Â  Brownâ€™s chain of title, in contrast, reveals that Thad Shealy was deeded 139 acres and later conveyed the identical tract which inexplicably contained 157 acres rather than 139.Â  The survey performed by Todd establishes McKee as the owner of the tract.Â  The survey by Arant was not completed, and Arantâ€™s error in placing survey markers causedÂ  Cobbâ€™s survey to go awry.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the evidence showed that the home place was referenced in McKeeâ€™s chain of title, was occupied and leased by McKeeâ€™s ancestors, and was located on the twenty-seven acres.Â  Due to an apparent error in the tax assessors office, both partiesâ€™ paid taxes on the land.Â  Therefore, the payment of taxes does not help either partyâ€™s claim.Â  The evidence amply supports the masterâ€™s ruling that McKee is the legal owner of the disputed tract.\r\nAdverse Possession\r\nThe master found that in addition to her claim by chain of title, McKee had proved ownership by adverse possession both under color of title and by demonstrating proof of actual, open, notorious, hostile, continuous, and exclusive possession of the property for the statutory period. Â \r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-220 (1976), \r\n\r\n  Whenever it shall appear (a) that the occupant or those under whom he claims entered into possession of premises under claim of title, exclusive of any other right, founding such a claim upon a written instrument as being a conveyance of the premises in question or upon the decree or judgment of a competent court and (b) that there has been a continued occupation and possession of the premises, or of some part of such premises, including in such instrument, decree or judgment under such claim for ten years, the premises so included shall be deemed to have been held adversely[.]\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-220 (1976).\r\nMcKee established through her chain of title that, at the very least, she possessed the land by color of title.Â  She further demonstrated continued occupation of the land for at least ten years.Â  McKee has been harvesting and growing trees on the twenty-seven acres since 1982.Â  Under section 15-67-230, â€œland shall be deemed to have been possessed and occupied . . . when it has been usually cultivated or improved.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-67-230 (1976).Â  Therefore, having met both (a) and (b) of section 15-67-220, â€œthe premises so included shall be deemed to have been held adversely.â€Â  \r\nIn addition, the master detailed evidence of actual, open, notorious, hostile, continuous, and exclusive possession by McKee for ten years or more.Â  See Miller v. Leaird, 307 S.C. 56, 413 S.E.2d 841 (1992) (outlining the elements of adverse possession).Â  Brown and another witness testified they planted trees on the tract in 1958.Â  However, any claim of adverse possession by Brown fails to survive McKeeâ€™s use of the land since 1982.Â  Thus, the evidence reasonably supports the masterâ€™s findings. \r\nAcquiescence\r\nFinally, the master ruled that if Brown ever had owned the disputed tract, McKee proved her acquiescence claim, which was pled in the alternative.Â  \r\nKnox v. Bogan, 322 S.C. 64, 71-72, 472 S.E.2d 43, 47 (Ct. App. 1996), provides:\r\n\r\n  It is well established that if adjoining landowners occupy their respective premises up to a certain line which they mutually recognize and acquiesce in for a long period of timeâ€”usually the time prescribed by the statute of limitationsâ€”they are precluded from claiming that the boundary line thus recognized and acquiesced in is not the true one.Â  In other words, such recognition of, and acquiescence in, a line as the true boundary line, if continued for a sufficient length of time, will afford a conclusive presumption that the line thus acquiesced in is the true boundary line.\r\n\r\nEvidence established that both McKee and Brown treated the fence line as the true property boundary for more than ten years.Â  Moreover, Brown subdivided and sold all of his property up to the fence line.Â  McKee clear cut the land and planted trees with no objection by Brown.Â  This evidence reasonably supports the masterâ€™s finding that the parties treated the fence line as the boundary.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThe record contains sufficient evidence to support the masterâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Accordingly, the masterâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., ANDERSON, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-085","title":"State v.

Kehl, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an appeal from an order of the trial court granting summary judgment to State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), and denying summary judgment to Fatima Shaikh.Â  The trial court found Shaikh was not entitled to $25,000 in personal injury protection (PIP) from her motherâ€™s State Farm automobile insurance policy because her injury was precluded by an unambiguously other owned vehicle exclusion in that policy.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 18, 2003, Shaikh was severely injured in an automobile accident while driving her 2000 Honda CR-V.[2]Â  The adverse driverâ€™s insurer paid Shaikh the policy limits of $50,000.Â  Because Shaikhâ€™s medical expenses and lost wages exceeded $86,000, she sought $25,000 in PIP from her motherâ€™s State Farm automobile insurance policy (the Policy).Â  Shaikh resided with her mother, but the Policy did not cover her Honda.Â  Rather, the Policy covered her motherâ€™s 1995 Ford Taurus, which was not involved in the accident.Â  \r\nShaikh made a claim for PIP coverage under the Policy, which State Farm denied.Â  State Farm argued her claim was precluded by a provision of the Policy that excluded PIP coverage for a resident relative injured while driving a vehicle owned by the resident relative but not covered under the Policy.Â  Shaikh disagreed, and brought a declaratory judgment action against State Farm.Â  Shaikh alleged she was entitled to the PIP coverage under the Policy, and her claim was not precluded by any provisions of the Policy.Â  State Farm answered, and both parties moved for summary judgment.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to State Farm and denied summary judgment to Shaikh.Â  This appeal followed. Â Â  Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005).Â  Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  On appeal, all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  When a motion for summary judgment presents a question as to the meaning of a written contract, the question is one of law if the language employed by the contract is plain and unambiguous.Â  MCG Mgmt. of Charleston, Inc. v. Kinghorn Ins. Agency, 336 S.C. 542, 546, 520 S.E.2d 820, 822 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nShaikh argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to State Farm, because the exclusion in the Policy does not unambiguously preclude her from recovering PIP coverage under the Policy.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nInsurance policies must conform to general rules of contract construction.Â  Coakley v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 363 S.C. 147, 152, 609 S.E.2d 537, 540 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Accordingly, an insurance policy should be given its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.Â  Id.Â  The meaning should not be tortured to allow for coverage that was not intended by the parties.Â  Id.Â  Thus, an unambiguous policy must be construed according to the terms used by the parties.Â  Century Indem. Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 565, 561 S.E.2d 355, 358 (2002).Â  However, an ambiguous policy must be â€œconstrued liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer.â€Â  Diamond State Ins. Co. v. Homestead Indus., Inc., 318 S.C. 231, 236, 456 S.E.2d 912, 915 (1995).Â  In construing an insurance policy, all of its provisions must be considered together and â€œread as a whole, giving appropriate weight to all provisions.â€Â  Yarborough v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., 266 S.C. 584, 592, 225 S.E.2d 344, 349 (1976).Â  Therefore, courts should consider the entire policy to determine the meaning of its provisions; the construction that reasonably gives effect to the whole instrument and each of its various parts will be adopted.Â  MCG Mgmt. of Charleston, Inc. v. Kinghorn Ins. Agency, 336 S.C. 542, 548, 520 S.E.2d 820, 823 (Ct. App. 1999). Â \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In South Carolina, PIP coverage is not statutorily mandated, and may be excluded by insurance carriers.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-144 (2002); Smith v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 313 S.C. 236, 239, 437 S.E.2d 142, 144 (Ct. App. 1993) (â€œSouth Carolina does not require any PIP coverage under its automobile insurance laws and has no public policy regarding such coverage.â€).Â  The provision at the center of this dispute is one such PIP coverage exclusion.Â  The provision states:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    What Is Not Covered Under [PIP]\r\n    THERE IS NO COVERAGE . . . \r\n    FOR BODILY INJURY . . .Â  \r\n    SUSTAINED WHILE OCCUPYING OR THROUGH BEING STRUCK BY A VEHICLE OWNED BY OR LEASED TO YOU, YOUR SPOUSE OR ANY RELATIVE, WHICH IS NOT INSURED FOR THIS COVERAGE UNDER THIS POLICY . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe relevant portion of this provision is â€œthere is no coverage . . . for bodily injury sustained while occupying . . . a vehicle owned by . . . any relative, which is not insured for [PIP] coverage under [the Policy].â€Â  \r\nWe find this provision unambiguously excludes PIP coverage for a resident relative who is injured while driving a vehicle owned by a resident relative but not covered by the insurance policy offering the PIP coverage.Â  We must consider this provision as it applies to Shaikh.Â  First, because Shaikh resided with her mother, she was a resident relative under the Policy.Â  Second, because Shaikh was injured while driving her Honda, she sustained bodily injury while occupying a vehicle not covered by the Policy.Â  The Policy insured her motherâ€™s Ford, not Shaikhâ€™s Honda, as evidenced by the fact that the Ford was described on the declarations page of the Policy, while the Honda was not.Â  Consequently, Shaikh falls under the exclusionary provision, and is not entitled to the $25,000 in PIP coverage under the Policy.Â  \r\nThe order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Shaikhâ€™s Honda was insured by Interstate Indemnity Company.Â  Her policy with Interstate Indemnity Company did not provide PIP coverage.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-087","title":"State v.

Miller, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-087\r\nHeard November 9, 2006 â€“ Filed February 10, 2006\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJessica Ann Salvini, of Greenville; for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Senior Assistant Attorney General Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  John J. Rivera appeals his conviction for criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor, first degree.Â  He contends the trial court erred in:Â  (1) denying his motion to sever the two indictments charging him with CSC with a minor, first degree, and lewd act upon a child; (2) denying one of his voir dire requests; (3) admitting certain testimony of three State witnesses; and (4) denying his motion for a mistrial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nSince June of 1998, the victim lived with her mother, Melissa Gail Duncan, and her younger brother in Greenville, South Carolina.Â  The victim has a learning disability, and at the time of trial, she was ten years old.Â  Mrs. Duncan is still married to the victimâ€™s father, Brad Duncan, and he sporadically lived with the family over this time frame.Â Â  \r\nMrs. Duncan has been a waitress at Waffle House since December of 1998, and it was while working that she met John Rivera.Â  Rivera was already a regular Waffle House customer when Mrs. Duncan began working, and the two of them quickly began a friendly relationship.Â  During a time of separation between Mr. and Mrs. Duncan, Mrs. Duncan began a romantic relationship with Rivera in April of 2000.Â  In May of 2000, Rivera moved into Mrs. Duncanâ€™s mobile home and lived there with the family until January of 2001 when the couple amicably ended their relationship.Â  During the time of their relationship, Rivera watched the children while Mrs. Duncan worked, and no problems were reported to, or observed by, Mrs. Duncan.Â  \r\nBeginning in February of 2001, Mrs. Duncan hired Margaret Hunter to baby-sit her children while she was at work.Â  In July of 2001, Mrs. Duncan and Rivera reconciled and began seeing each other again.Â  On July 31, 2001, Rivera, Mrs. Duncan, the victim, and her brother went to Stone Mountain, Georgia.Â  Due to the late hour of their return from this trip, everyone stayed at Riveraâ€™s house in Travelers Rest, South Carolina. Rivera watched the children while Mrs. Duncan worked the following day.Â  \r\nOn August 4, 2001, Hunter baby-sat the victim while Mrs. Duncan worked.Â  The victim told Hunter that Rivera had been abusing her because, as she testified at trial: â€œ[M]y private part . . . was hurting so bad that I told her what was the matter.â€Â  When Mrs. Duncan arrived to pick up her daughter, Hunter instructed the victim to tell Mrs. Duncan about the abuse.Â  The victim explained that on multiple occasions Rivera had made her take off her clothes, fondled her, forced her to fondle him, and forced both oral and vaginal sex.Â  She also informed Mrs. Duncan that Rivera: â€œ[P]ut white stuff all over me,â€ and the white stuff was â€œfrom his private part down there.â€Â  The victim further stated that Rivera had shown her pornographic pictures on the internet, and asked her if she wanted to perform similar acts.Â  \r\nMrs. Duncan took her daughter to the hospital emergency room, but no examination was performed because too much time had elapsed since the last alleged abuse.Â  The hospital called the Travelers Rest Police Department, which referred Mrs. Duncan to the Child Advocacy Center.Â  On August 14, 2001, the victim was examined and interviewed at the Child Advocacy Center and also began receiving counseling.Â  Subsequently, the victim was interviewed by the Greenville County Sheriffâ€™s Office on October 16, 2001.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nUltimately, a Greenville County grand jury indicted Rivera for CSC with a minor, first degree, and committing a lewd act upon a child.Â  After the jury found Rivera guilty of both charges, the trial court sentenced him to eighteen years imprisonment.[1]Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Severance of the Trial\r\nRivera argues the trial court erred when it refused to sever the indictments against him into two separate trials.Â  Specifically, he contends that consolidation of the two indictments was improper because the alleged sexual misconduct took place on different occasions and possibly in different places.Â  We disagree.\r\nA motion for severance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 164, 478 S.E.2d 260, 265 (1996); State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 350, 573 S.E.2d 856, 860 (Ct. App. 2002). The courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Tucker, 324 S.C. at 164, 478 S.E.2d at 265; Simmons, 352 S.C. at 350, 573 S.E.2d at 860. \r\nWhere the offenses charged in separate indictments are of the same general nature involving connected transactions closely related in kind, place and character, the trial court has the power, in its discretion, to order the indictments tried together if the defendantâ€™s substantive rights would not\r\nbe prejudiced.Â  State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 315, 479 S.E.2d 517, 519, (Ct. App. 1996); Simmons, 352 S.C. at 350, 573 S.E.2d at 860.Â  â€œFurther, joinder of offenses in one trial is â€˜proper if the offenses (1) are of the same general nature or character and spring from the same series of transactions, (2) are committed by the same offender, and (3) require the same or similar proof.â€™â€ Simmons, 352 S.C. at 351, 573 S.E.2d at 861 (quoting State v. Carter, 324 S.C. 383, 386, 478 S.E.2d 86, 88 (Ct. App. 1996)).Â  â€œ[O]ffenses are considered to be of the same general nature where they are interconnected.â€Â  Simmons, 352 S.C. at 350, 573 S.E.2d at 860.\r\nApplying the foregoing to the facts of this case, we find the joinder of the two offenses was proper.Â  The two indictments levied against Rivera, CSC with a minor, first degree, and committing a lewd act upon a child, are of the same general nature in that they are interconnected.Â  They arose from an on-going series of events in a pattern of sexual abuse, i.e., â€œa single criminal course of conduct.â€Â  City of Greenville v. Chapman, 210 S.C. 157, 161, 41 S.E.2d 865, 867 (1947).Â  Moreover, these acts were committed by the same offender and were proved by the same evidence and witnesses.Â  Finally, we discern no evidence in the record that any right of Rivera was prejudiced by the consolidation of these indictments.Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to sever the indictments.\r\nII.Â  Voir Dire\r\nRivera contends the trial court erred in denying his request to voir dire the potential jury panel as to their personal beliefs regarding whether or not a minor child could make up a story of sexual abuse without having experienced it.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIn general, the scope of voir dire and the manner in which it is conducted are within the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion.Â  To constitute reversible error, a limitation on questioning must render the trial â€˜fundamentally unfair.â€™â€ State\r\nv. Hill, 361 S.C. 297, 308, 604 S.E.2d 696, 702 (2004), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 1977 (2005) (citations omitted).Â  Our supreme court has stated:\r\n\r\nA juror should not, prior to trial, be required to assert which witnesses he will believe nor what type of witness he will believe. This is true because a juror should believe those witnesses whose credibility appeal to him after he has heard all of the testimony.Â  The question invades the province of the jury to determine individual credibility in the context of the entire case.Â  \r\n\r\nState v. Adams, 279 S.C. 228, 235, 306 S.E.2d 208, 212 (1983), overruled, in part, on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991). \r\nDuring voir dire, Rivera submitted three questions for the court to ask the jury.Â  The court agreed to question the jury on all but the following request:Â  â€œIs there any member of the jury panel who does not believe a child could make up a story of sexual abuse without having experienced it?â€Â  \r\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to submit this question to the jury.Â  In declining the request, the court properly exercised its discretion in that it questioned the jury with two of Riveraâ€™s other requests.Â  Furthermore, we believe, as did the trial court, that the question at issue invaded the province of the jury on a credibility question.Â  Thus, we find the courtâ€™s limitation of Riveraâ€™s questions did not render the trial â€œfundamentally unfair.â€\r\nIII.Â  Admissibility of Evidence\r\nRivera asserts the trial court erred when it admitted the testimony of State witnesses pursuant to hearsay exceptions to the South Carolina Rules of Evidence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe admission or exclusion of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.â€Â \r\nState v. Foster, 354 S.C. 614, 620-21, 582 S.E.2d 426, 429 (2003). â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.â€Â  Id. at 621, 582 S.E.2d at 429.Â  To warrant reversal, an appellant must show not only an alleged error, but also resulting prejudice.Â  State v. Fulton, 333 S.C. 359, 363-64, 509 S.E.2d 819, 821 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\nA.Â  Â Â Â  Admissibility of Testimony Pursuant to South Carolina Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B)\r\n\r\nRivera contends the trial court erred, when pursuant to Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE, it admitted the testimony of two State witnesses, Sandy Fehrman and Ty Bracken, regarding the victimâ€™s prior consistent statements.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder the hearsay exception noted in Rule 801(d)(1)(D), SCRE, a corroborating witnessâ€™s testimony in a criminal sexual conduct case is generally limited to the time and place of the incident.Â Â  However, an alternate exception noted in Rule 801(d)(1)(B) states: \r\n\r\nA statement is not hearsay if . . . [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is consistent with the declarantâ€™s testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive; provided, however, the statement must have been made before the alleged fabrication, or before the alleged improper influence or motive arose.\r\n\r\nThe declarant, the victim in this case, testified, and Rivera cross- examined her by stating: \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q:\r\n         And did you talk about what you talked about today with Sandy\r\n          [Fehrman]?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         Okay.Â  And did she help you get ready to talk today?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:\r\n         Okay.Â  And do you know the police ladyâ€™s name?Â \r\n          [Ty Bracken]\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         I forgot.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         Okay.Â  Did she help you to get ready to talk today?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Okay.Â  And did you â€“ did she talk to you about what you talked about a lot today?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n         . . .\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:\r\n         Okay.Â  [Name of victim], did a lot of people talk to you to tell you how to talk today?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Yes.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe trial court found this line of questioning clearly implied that there had been a recent fabrication and, therefore, the door had been opened to the 801(d)(1)(B) hearsay exception.Â  \r\n\r\nIn discussing Rule 801(d)(1)(B), our supreme court has stated: \r\n  \r\nThe plain language of Rule 801(d)(1)(B) only permits evidence of a prior consistent statement when the witness has been charged with recent fabrication or improper motive or influence.Â  Although questioning a witness about a prior inconsistent statement does call the witnessâ€™s credibility into question, that is not the same as charging the witness with â€œrecent fabricationâ€ or â€œimproper influence or motive.â€ \r\n  \r\n\r\nState v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 124, 551 S.E.2d 240, 245 (2001)(quoting Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE).Â  â€œ[E]vidence of a prior consistent statement is only permitted when the elements of Rule 801(d)(1)(B) are met.â€Â  Foster, 354 S.C. at 621, 582 S.E.2d at 430.Â  â€œThis rule renders a hearsay statement potentially admissible if it is consistent with the declarantâ€™s trial testimony and â€˜is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.â€™â€ State v. Jeffcoat, 350 S.C. 392, 396, 565 S.E.2d 321, 323 (Ct. App. 2002)(quoting Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE).Â  â€œWhen all requirements of the rule are met, the whole of the prior statement, including specific details, is admissible in evidence.â€Â  Jeffcoat, 350 S.C. at 396, 565 S.E.2d at 323.\r\nWe agree with the trial courtâ€™s assessment that defense counselâ€™s cross-examination of the victim implied improper influence or coaching, particularly by asking the victim, â€œdid a lot of people talk to you to tell you how to talk todayâ€ as well as whether Fehrman and Bracken helped her â€œget ready to talk today.â€Â  Because defense counsel â€œopened the door,â€ we affirm the courtâ€™s decision to admit the witnessesâ€™ testimony pursuant to Rule 801(d)(1)(B).Â  See Jeffcoat, 350 S.C. at 397, 565 S.E.2d at 324 (affirming trial courtâ€™s decision to admit testimony of minor victimâ€™s mother and post-trauma therapistâ€™s testimony regarding victimâ€™s out-of-court statements concerning sexual abuse pursuant to Rule 801(d)(1)(B) where defense counsel â€œraised the issue of improper influence or â€˜coachingâ€™ by asking Victim whether she â€˜practicedâ€™ before testifying and whether anyone had told the Victim what to sayâ€); see also State v. Beam, 336 S.C. 45, 52, 518 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œ[W]hen a party introduces evidence about a particular matter, the other party is entitled to explain it or rebut it, even if the latter evidence would have been incompetent or irrelevant had it been offered initially.â€).Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in allowing Fehrman and Bracken to testify to the victimâ€™s prior consistent statements.\r\nAlternatively, Rivera contends if we find that his line of questioning â€œopened the doorâ€ to the above hearsay exception, the testimony of Bracken and Fehrman was still improper because it was not consistent with the declarantâ€™s testimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nBracken testified:Â  â€œShe [the victim] also stated that he had put her finger â€“ his finger in her crotch and touched me for a long time.â€Â  Rivera contends that this was inconsistent because the victim never testified to this fact.Â  Although Rivera generally raised the issue of consistency in a conference held outside of the jury, he did not specify which statements he felt would be inconsistent, and he made no objection to the consistency of either Brackenâ€™s or Fehrmanâ€™s testimony at the time their statements were offered.Â  Thus, we do not believe this issue is preserved for our review.Â  State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 611-12, 486 S.E.2d 762, 765 (Ct. App. 1997) (recognizing that a ruling during an in camera hearing still requires losing party to renew his or her objection at trial when the evidence is presented in order to preserve the issue for appeal); see also State v. Johnson, 324 S.C. 38, 41, 476 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1996) (noting a contemporaneous objection is required at trial to preserve an issue for appellate review); State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (stating an issue that is not properly preserved cannot be raised for the first time on appeal); State v. Black, 319 S.C. 515, 521-22, 462 S.E.2d 311, 315 (Ct. App. 1995) (stating failure to object when evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to raise issue on appeal).\r\nEven if this issue were preserved for appeal, we find any inconsistency in the testimony was harmless.Â  In light of the other testimony in the record that established the necessary elements for the crimes charged, there is no evidence that the defendant was prejudiced.Â  See State v. Whisonant, 335 S.C. 148, 156, 515 S.E.2d 768, 772 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding â€œ[a]n improper introduction of hearsay evidence constitutes reversible error only if its admission is prejudicial to the defendantâ€); State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 194, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990) (stating â€œ[e]rror is harmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trialâ€).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Admissibility of Testimony Pursuant to South Carolina Rule of Evidence 803(4)\r\n\r\nRivera argues the trial court erred when pursuant to Rule 803(4), SCRE, it admitted the testimony of State witness, Dr. Nancy Henderson, regarding the victimâ€™s statements made to her during a medical examination.Â  Specifically, Rivera contends that because Dr. Henderson did not provide a diagnosis based on medical conclusions or a physical examination of the victim and relied exclusively on the victimâ€™s statements to her, there was no diagnosis made which would trigger this hearsay exception. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe hearsay exception noted in Rule 803(4) states: \r\n  \r\nThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness:Â  Statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment; provided, however, that the admissibility of statements made after commencement of the litigation is left to the courtâ€™s discretion.\r\n  \r\n\r\nRule 803(4) requires only that the statements be provided for the purpose of medical diagnosis.Â  We agree with the trial court that the statements the victim provided to Dr. Henderson were for the purpose of diagnosis.Â  The victimâ€™s statements regarding how and when she was abused provided the doctor with specific areas to focus on, and specific conditions to search for when she performed the diagnostic physical exam.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this testimony.Â  See State v. Burroughs, 328 S.C. 489, 501, 492 S.E.2d 408, 414 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œCertainly, a statement that the victim had been raped or that the assailant had hurt the victim in a particular area would be pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of the victim.â€).Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, Rivera claims that Dr. Henderson testified to statements made to her by the victim that were not necessary for medical diagnosis.Â  Rivera cites the following statements:Â  â€œShe [the victim] also said that he [Rivera] put his finger on her chest.Â  And also that he wanted her to put her hand down his pants, but she didnâ€™t.â€Â  Rivera never made any objection to this testimony, and therefore, this issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  See Johnson, 324 S.C. at 41, 476 S.E.2d at 682 (noting a contemporaneous objection is required at trial to preserve an issue for appellate review); Black, 319 S.C. at 521-22, 462 S.E.2d at 315 (stating failure to object when evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to raise issue on appeal).\r\nIV.Â  Mistrial\r\nRivera contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial resulting from the Stateâ€™s expert witness, Laurie Pinckney, revealing the name of the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse in violation of the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound\r\ndiscretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Vazsquez, 364 S.C. 293, 299, 613 S.E.2d 359, 362 (2005). Â â€œâ€˜The power of a court to declare a mistrial ought to be used with the greatest caution under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causesâ€™ stated into the record by the trial judge.â€Â  State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 354, 573 S.E.2d 856, 862 (Ct. App. 2002)(quoting State v. Kirby, 269 S.C. 25, 28-29, 236 S.E.2d 33, 34 (1977)).Â  â€œA mistrial should only be granted when â€˜absolutely necessary,â€™ and\r\na defendant must show both error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial.â€Â  Simmons, 352 S.C. at 354, 573 S.E.2d at 862.Â  â€œA mistrial should be ordered only when an incident is so grievous that prejudicial effect cannot be removed.â€Â  Vazsquez, 364 S.C. at 299, 613 S.E.2d at 362.\r\nPinckney, by the courtâ€™s direction, was limited to discussing the alleged sexual assault in terms of time and place and was not permitted to identify Rivera.Â  Pinckney was questioned on direct examination and answered as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q:\r\n         And, again, pursuant to the Court rules, just answer very specifically.Â  Did she [the victim] tell you where she had been abused?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n         She stated that it was while her mom was â€“ while John [Rivera] was baby sitting her.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nRivera objected and the jury was removed from the courtroom. Rivera then moved for a mistrial.Â  The judge denied this motion, but did offer Rivera an opportunity to suggest a curative instruction.Â  Rivera suggested an instruction that was given to the jury.Â  Rivera did not object to the sufficiency of the instruction.[2]  \r\nBecause Rivera suggested and accepted the curative instruction, we find this issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  See State v. Moyd, 321 S.C. 256, 263, 468 S.E.2d 7, 11 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating if objecting party accepts ruling of trial court and does not contemporaneously object to sufficiency of curative instruction or move for mistrial, error deemed cured and issue not preserved for appellate review).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in:Â  declining to sever the indictments; refusing Riveraâ€™s voir dire request; and admitting certain testimony under hearsay exceptions.Â  We also affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of Riveraâ€™s motion for a mistrial.Â  Based on the foregoing, Riveraâ€™s conviction and sentence for CSC with a minor, first degree, are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Although the jury convicted Rivera of both charges, the trial court granted Riveraâ€™s motion to set aside the conviction for lewd act upon a child on the ground the State failed to prove every element of the charge.Â  Therefore, only the charge of CSC with a minor, first degree is at issue in this appeal.\r\n[2] Rivera only submitted a specific curative instruction once his motion for mistrial was denied.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-088","title":"Meehan v.

Sean Faulkner, of Greenville, Harold P. Threlkeld and J. Calhoun Pruitt, Jr., of Anderson, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  John Thomas Meehan, Jr. appeals the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of his action for lack of standing pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe respondents, Jerry Andrew Meehan (Jerry) and Janet Elizabeth Kelly Dorado (Janet), and the appellant, John Thomas Meehan, Jr. (Meehan), are the children of Mary Meehan (Mother), who is not a party to this action.Â  Mother owned several large parcels of real estate located in Pendleton, South Carolina.Â  Two of those parcels, the Dickson Place tract and the Harris Place tract, are directly involved in this dispute.Â  The Dickson Place property contains approximately 115 acres and the Harris Place property consists of 70.2 acres.Â  In May of 1983, Mother conveyed fee simple title to Dickson Place to Jerry.Â  In 2003, Mother conveyed fee simple title to Harris Place to Jerry and Janet.Â  \r\nIn May 2003, Jerry conveyed his entire interest in Dickson Place plus an additional 18.6 acres to Lebanon Road, LLC, for the purchase price of $554,000.Â  Lebanon Road simultaneously granted GrandSouth Bank a first mortgage on the property acquired from Jerry.[1]Â  After mortgaging the Harris Place property, Jerry and Janet re-conveyed the property back to Mother who then sold the property to Robert Newton.Â  At no time did Meehan acquire an interest in either Dickson Place or Harris Place.\r\nMeehan claims Mother made numerous verbal and written representations to him that he would receive Dickson Place as his sole property either during Motherâ€™s lifetime or upon her death.Â  Meehan relies on a 2001 letter in which Mother promised him Dickson Place.Â  He also claims Jerry and Janet mortgaged Harris Place against Motherâ€™s wishes.Â  According to Meehan, Mother stated that she wanted the Harris Place property to be divided equally between her three children.Â  \r\nMeehan filed this action to set aside the deeds of conveyance to Jerry and Janet from Mother based on fraud, duress, and undue influence.Â  Meehan also sought a constructive trust for his benefit on Dickson Place and Harris Place because Mother promised or intended to convey an interest in both to him.Â  The circuit court dismissed, finding Meehan lacked the standing necessary to bring the actions.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, a defendant may move to dismiss based on a failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  Flateau v. Harrelson, 355 S.C. 197, 201, 584 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  A trial judge may dismiss a claim when the defendant demonstrates the plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action in the pleadings.Â  Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 233, 553 S.E.2d 496, 500 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Generally, in considering a 12(b)(6) motion, the circuit court must base its ruling solely upon allegations set forth on the face of the complaint. Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 300, 457 S.E.2d 601, 602-03 (1995).Â  Upon review of a dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the appellate court applies the same standard of review implemented by the circuit court.Â  Doe v. Marion, 361 S.C. 463, 470, 605 S.E.2d 556, 560 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMeehan argues the circuit court erred in dismissing his action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  Specifically, Meehan contends the circuit court erred in finding he lacked the standing necessary to maintain the action.[2]Â  We disagree.\r\nTo have standing, one must have a personal stake in the subject matter of the lawsuit; one must be a real party in interest. Â Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. Charleston County Election Commâ€™n, 336 S.C. 174, 181, 519 S.E.2d 567, 571 (1999).Â  â€œA real party in interest is one who has a real, material, or substantial interest in the subject matter of the action, as opposed to one who has only a nominal or technical interest in the action.â€Â  Anchor Point, Inc. v. Shoals Sewer Co., 308 S.C. 422, 428, 418 S.E.2d 546, 549 (1992).Â  A private person does not have standing unless he has sustained, or is in immediate danger of sustaining, prejudice from an executive or legislative action.Â  Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 530, 511 S.E.2d 69, 75 (1999).Â  â€œSuch imminent prejudice must be of a personal nature to the party laying claim to standing and not merely of general interest common to all members of the public.â€Â  Id. at 530, 511 S.E.2d at 75 (citing Citizens for Lee County, Inc. v. Lee County, 308 S.C. 23, 416 S.E.2d 641 (1992)).Â  Moreover, the injury in fact cannot be a â€œprospective concern of future harm.â€Â  Beaufort Realty Co. v. S.C. Coastal Conservation League, 346 S.C. 298, 303, 551 S.E.2d 588, 590 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nIn Sea Pines Association for Protection of Wildlife, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, our supreme court set out the three â€œirreducible constitutional minimums of standing.â€Â  345 S.C. 594, 601, 550 S.E.2d 287, 291 (2001) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559-61 (1992) (internal citations omitted)).Â  First, the plaintiff must have suffered an â€œinjury in fact.â€Â  The court defined â€œinjury in factâ€ as â€œan invasion of a legally protected interestâ€ which is â€œconcrete and particularizedâ€ and â€œactual or imminent,â€ not â€œconjectural or hypothetical.â€Â  Second, a causal connection must exist between the alleged injury and the conduct from which the plaintiff complains.Â  The injury must be â€œtraceable to the challenged action of the defendant,â€ and not â€œthe result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.â€Â  Third, it must be â€œlikelyâ€ rather than merely â€œspeculative,â€ that the injury will be â€œredressed by a favorable decision.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere, Meehan does not satisfy the â€œirreducible constitutional minimumâ€ of standing.Â  Meehan fails to satisfy both the first and second prongs of the Lujan test.Â  First, Meehan cannot establish an injury in fact.Â  Meehan admits he did not own the Dickson Place or Harris Place properties at the time Mother transferred them to Jerry and Janet.Â  Moreover, Meehan admits Mother did not own the properties at the time she wrote the 2001 letter in which she promised to devise Dickson Place to Meehan.Â  The only interest Meehan claims in the properties is the mere possibility that Mother might have given the Dickson Place property to him in the future.Â  Therefore, the mere expectancy or future interest in the properties fails to satisfy the Lujan requirement that the injury be â€œconcrete and particularizedâ€ and â€œactual or imminent,â€ not merely â€œconjectural or hypothetical.â€Â  \r\nSecond, Meehan fails to establish a causal connection between his alleged injury and the conduct of Jerry and Janet.Â  The injury complained of is that Jerry and Janet committed unlawful acts against a third partyâ€”Motherâ€” or that Mother conveyed the property to Meehanâ€™s siblings in contravention of the 2001 letter promising him the property.Â  Therefore, if Jerry and Janet committed the acts alleged by Meehan in his complaint, only Mother could seek redress for those tortious actions; or, in the alternative, because it was Mother who promised Meehan the property, he might have a claim against Mother, but not one against his siblings.Â  As a result, the injury Meehan complains of is merely the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.Â  Because Meehan has not suffered an injury in fact and has failed to establish a causal connection between his injury and the conduct of Jerry and Janet, we find no error in the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion that Meehan lacks the standing necessary to maintain.\r\nMeehan next argues the complaint adequately sets forth a claim against Jerry and Janet for intentional interference with inheritance rights.Â  We find this issue not preserved for appellate review.[3]\r\nâ€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â Â  An argument is not preserved for review when it is presented it to the court for the first time in a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  Hickman v. Hickman, 301 S.C. 455, 457, 392 S.E.2d 481, 482 (1990).Â  A party cannot use Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to present to the trial court an issue the party could have raised prior to judgment but did not. Â Id.\r\nIn this case, Meehan neither alleged a cause of action for intentional interference with inheritance rights in his amended complaint, nor sought to proffer any further amendment to the complaint at the hearing.Â  The first mention of an allegation supporting an action for intentional interference with inheritance rights came in Meehanâ€™s Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nAdditionally, Meehan argues the circuit court erred in dismissing his action rather than affording him the opportunity to add Mother as an indispensable party.Â  Again, we find this issue not preserved for appellate review.\r\n\r\nRule 15(a), SCRCP, provides, in part:\r\n  \r\nA party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before or within 30 days after a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive pleading is required and the action has not been placed upon the trial roster, he may so amend it at any time within 30 days after it is served.Â  Otherwise a party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, a party seeking to amend his pleadings at trial must proffer the amendment before the court, and must obtain a ruling from the circuit court denying the amendment.Â  See Keels v. Pierce, 315 S.C. 339, 343, 433 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nHere, Meehan did not seek to add Mother as a party, nor did he proffer any amendment to the circuit court at the hearing.Â  Meehan simply stated to the court â€œif we go on, Iâ€™ll have to amend the complaint anyway.â€Â  Even assuming this could be construed as an oral motion to amend, and we do not believe it can, Meehan did not receive a ruling from the circuit court.Â  Therefore, the issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nLastly, Meehan alleges the circuit court erred in considering an affidavit of Mother in ruling on the dismissal.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt is well settled that in considering a Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP motion, the circuit court must base its ruling solely upon the allegations set forth in the pleadings.Â  Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 457 S.E.2d 697 (1995).Â  If the circuit court considers matters outside of the pleadings, the 12(b)(6) motion will be converted to one for summary judgment under Rule 56, SCRCP.Â  See Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.\r\nThere is no evidence that the circuit court relied on Motherâ€™s affidavit in dismissing Meehanâ€™s action under Rule 12(b)(6).Â  The affidavit was introduced pursuant to Motherâ€™s contemporaneous Motion to Quash the Deposition Subpoena of Meehan.Â  While there was some dialogue between the circuit court and Meehanâ€™s attorney concerning the affidavit, nothing indicates the circuit court considered the contents of the affidavit when it dismissed the action.Â  The findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the order dismissing the action make no reference to the affidavit or the facts contained in the affidavit, and Meehan cannot point to any evidence that the circuit court relied on the affidavit of Mother.Â  Therefore, the action was not converted to a motion for summary judgment, and the circuit court correctly dismissed the action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of Meehanâ€™s action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Lebanon Road thereafter conveyed approximately 42.6 acres of the Dickson Place property to Coastal Plains Development Co., an entity not a party to this action.Â  The remainder of Dickson Place is currently owned by Lebanon Road.\r\n[2] We need not address the other Respondents, Lebanon Road, LLC, and GrandSouth Bancorporation, as any liability they may incur is derivative to that of Jerry and Janet.Â  Because we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s finding that Meehan lacked the standing to bring the action against Jerry and Janet, we also affirm the dismissal of the remaining Respondents.\r\n[3] South Carolina has yet to recognize intentional interference with inheritance rights as a valid cause of action.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-089","title":"Walls v.

Edward Welmaker, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nUnpublished Opinion No. 2006-UP-089\r\nHeard November 9, 2005 â€“ Filed February 10, 2006\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nWeston Trey Merck, of Piedmont, for Appellant-Respondent.\r\nThomas Elihue Dudley, III, of Greenville, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Contractor Teddy Walls appeals the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of his mechanicâ€™s lien action for failing to timely file his notice and certificate of mechanicâ€™s lien and foreclosure action where the notice and action were erroneously brought in the name of Crafts Unlimited Contractors, Inc., a corporation Walls formed after entering into the construction contracts.Â  Reed Porter &amp; RAF, LLC filed a cross-appeal asserting the trial court erred in denying their request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We reverse the dismissal of Wallsâ€™ action and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 28, 2003, Teddy Walls, as the Owner of Crafts Unlimited, a sole proprietorship, entered into two construction contracts with Reed Porter &amp; RAF, LLC (Reed/Porter).Â  One contract price was $150,000.00.Â  The other was $740,000.00.Â  In December of 2003, Walls incorporated his business under the name Crafts Unlimited Contractors, Inc (the Corporation).Â  Walls was terminated from the projects in January of 2004. Although Walls performed the work under the contracts doing business as Crafts Unlimited, the sole proprietorship, he filed a notice and certificate of mechanicâ€™s lien that he had signed on behalf of the Corporation on February 24, 2004.Â  The Corporation subsequently brought this action on May 4, 2004 seeking foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien as well as claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.Â  In its answer, Reed/Porter asserted the corporation lacked standing to bring the action as it could not establish an agreement with Reed/Porter to perform work.Â  \r\nOn June 7, 2004, Walls filed an amended summons and complaint and lis pendens under his own name, doing business as Crafts Unlimited, asserting claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Reed/Porter moved for partial summary judgment on the claim for foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  It asserted as the Corporation did not contract to provide labor and materials, it never acquired any lien rights. \r\nThe trial court found that it was undisputed that the Corporation did not contract to provide labor and materials, and therefore never acquired any lien rights upon which to base a lien claim.Â  It ruled Walls, the current plaintiff, was a different, distinct entity from the Corporation.Â  It held that since it had been more than ninety days since Walls had done any work on the subject property, the error in naming the wrong party could not be cured.Â  Thus, as Walls did not timely file a notice of mechanicâ€™s lien, the mechanicâ€™s lien action must be dismissed.\r\nAs an additional sustaining holding, the court held that since the entity that filed the mechanicâ€™s lien was not properly licensed, it lacked standing to assert such a lien or lawsuit.Â  The court denied Reed/Porterâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWalls argues the trial court erred in holding his notice of mechanicâ€™s lien and foreclosure action were not timely filed.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAs a mechanicâ€™s lien is purely statutory, the requirements of the statute must be strictly followed.Â  Muller v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 303 S.C. 137, 140, 399 S.E.2d 430, 432 (Ct. App. 1990), overruled on other grounds by Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 532 S.E.2d 868 (2000).Â  If any one of these requirements is not met, the lien against the property is dissolved.Â  Id.Â  at 141, 399 S.E.2d at 432.Â  However, as the mechanicâ€™s lien statutes are remedial, they are to be given a liberal construction. Â Clo-Car Trucking Co. v. Clifflue Estates of S.C., 282 S.C. 573, 575-76, 320 S.E.2d 51, 53 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\nThe mechanicâ€™s lien statutes set forth the time limits in which a person seeking to enforce a mechanicâ€™s lien must serve and file the notice and certificate of lien and foreclosure action.Â  Section 29-5-90 of the South Carolina Code provides the time limits for serving and filing the notice and certificate of lien: \r\n\r\n[A mechanicâ€™s] lien shall be dissolved unless the person desiring to avail himself thereof, within ninety days after he ceases to labor on or furnish labor or materials for such building or structure, serves upon the owner or, in the event the owner cannot be found, upon the person in possession and files in the office of the register of deeds or clerk of court of the county in which the building or structure is situated a statement of a just and true account of the amount due him, with all just credits given, together with a description of the property intended to be covered by the lien sufficiently accurate for identification, with the name of the owner of the property, if known, which certificate shall be subscribed and sworn to by the person claiming the lien or by someone in his behalf and shall be recorded in a book kept for the purpose by the register or clerk who shall be entitled to the same fees therefor as for recording mortgages of equal length. . . . \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-90 (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nA suit to enforce the lien must be commenced within six months of the cessation of labor. S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-120 (1991). \r\nIn the present case, Walls filed his amended summons and complaint and lis pendens within six months of his cessation of labor.Â  Thus, he complied with section 29-5-120 in timely commencing his suit to enforce the mechanicâ€™s lien.Â Â  The amended action, however, was served and filed well after the 90-day time limit set forth in section 29-5-90 for serving and filing the notice of mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Therefore, we must decide whether the notice served and filed on February 24, 2004 meets the requirements of the statute to preserve Wallsâ€™ lien.Â  \r\nWalls, â€œthe person desiring to avail himselfâ€ of the lien, signed the notice himself, albeit on behalf of the Corporation.Â  He also signed the affidavit of mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Walls merely captioned the notice with the Corporationâ€™s name.\r\n\r\nWhere the purpose of the requirement that a particular statement be included in the claim of lien has been achieved and no one is prejudiced, technical requirements should not stand in the way of achieving the purposes of the mechanicâ€™s lien law.Â  Even though a claim contains some defect or error it will be upheld where the owner is informed of the claim and not misled by it or prejudiced.Â  \r\n\r\n53 Am.Jur. 2d Mechanicâ€™s Liens Â§ 235 (1996).\r\nReed/Porter presented no evidence that it was misled by this caption or that it was prejudiced in any manner.Â  In fact, it is impossible to discern how it could have been misled considering the documents were signed by Walls and the Corporationâ€™s name is the same as the name of Wallsâ€™ sole proprietorship.Â  We find under the facts of this case, Walls timely perfected his mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  \r\nAs an additional holding, the trial court held that since the entity that filed the mechanicâ€™s lien, the Corporation, was not properly licensed, it lacked standing to assert such a lien or lawsuit.Â  The Corporation, however, is no longer a party in this suit.Â  Walls, who is properly licensed, is the only party seeking to enforce the lien.Â Â  The Corporationâ€™s lack of a license has no bearing on Wallsâ€™ claim against Reed/Porter.\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Wallsâ€™ action to foreclose the mechanicâ€™s lien is \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.[2]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] As we reverse the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Wallsâ€™ foreclosure action, we need not address Reed/Porterâ€™s claims that it was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-090","title":"State v.

Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Solicitor Robert Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this bond estreatment case, Safety National, Surety for South Carolina Bonding Company (Safety National), appeals the circuit courtâ€™s decision ordering a partial estreatment of Alfredo Hernandezâ€™s bond.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nHernandez, a foreign national, was arrested in South Carolina for grand larceny.Â  On October 31, 2002, Hernandez was released from custody when the South Carolina Bonding Company signed a $4,000 surety bond.Â  \r\nOn March 26, 2003, the circuit court issued a bench warrant for Hernandezâ€™s arrest when, after proper notice, he failed to appear in court on that date.Â  On June 10, 2003, the circuit court issued a conditional order to estreat Hernandezâ€™s bond unless the South Carolina Bonding Company appeared on July 11, 2003, to show cause why the bond should not be remitted in whole or in part.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, counsel informed the court that the United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services picked up Hernandez on March 11, 2003, and ultimately deported him.Â  As a result, counsel argued the court should not estreat the bond because the bond company could not bring Hernandez into court on the scheduled date.Â  In response, the State asserted that Safety National assumed the risk of forfeiture by signing a bond for a non-citizen. \r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the court estreated $2,000 of the $4,000 bond on the ground Hernandez violated the conditions of his bond.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nSafety National argues the circuit court erred in partially estreating Hernandezâ€™s bond.Â  Because the federal government detained and deported Hernandez, Safety National contends it was impossible to bring Hernandez into court.Â  Thus, Safety National asserts it was no longer bound to perform its obligation under the bond contract.\r\nSection 38-53-70 of the South Carolina Code outlines the procedure governing bond forfeitures.Â  This section provides:\r\n\r\nIf a defendant fails to appear at a court proceeding to which he has been summoned, the court must issue a bench warrant for the defendant.Â  If the surety fails to surrender the defendant or place a hold on the defendantâ€™s release from incarceration, commitment, or institutionalization within thirty days of the issuance of the bench warrant, the bond shall be forfeited.Â  At any time before execution is issued on a judgment of forfeiture against a defendant or his surety, the court may direct that the judgment be remitted in whole or in part, upon conditions as the court may impose, if it appears that justice requires the remission of part or all of the judgment.Â  In making a determination as to remission of the judgment, the court shall consider the costs to the State or any county or municipality resulting from the necessity to continue or terminate the defendantâ€™s trial and the efforts of law enforcement officers or agencies to locate the defendant.Â  The court in its discretion may permit the surety to pay the estreatment in installments for a period of up to six months . . . . If at any time during the period in which installments are to be paid the defendant is surrendered to the appropriate detention facility and the surety complies with the re-commitment procedures, the surety is relieved of any further liability.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-70 (Supp. 2005).\r\nâ€œThe issue of whether a bond forfeiture should be remitted, and if so, to what extent, is vested in the discretion of the trial judge.â€Â  Ex parte Polk, 354 S.C. 8, 11, 579 S.E.2d 329, 330 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œ[T]he exercise of that discretion by the trial judge will not be set aside unless it is made to appear that it was abused.â€Â  State v. Holloway, 262 S.C. 552, 555, 206 S.E.2d 822, 823 (1974).Â  â€œAmong the factors to be considered in determining whether and to what extent relief will be granted are (1) the purpose of the bond; (2) the nature and wilfulness of the default; [and] (3) any prejudice or additional expense resulting to the State.â€Â  State v. Workman, 274 S.C. 341, 343, 263 S.E.2d 865, 866 (1980).Â  â€œIf bond is forfeited because of ignorance or unavoidable impediment rather than willful default, the trial court may, on affidavit showing cause or excuse, remit the forfeiture in full or in part.â€Â  State v. Boatwright, 310 S.C. 281, 283, 423 S.E.2d 139, 140 (1992) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-180 (1985)).\r\nWe find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a partial estreatment of Hernandezâ€™s bond.Â  Hernandezâ€™s release on bond was conditioned upon his appearance in court on the date set by the State.Â  Because Hernandez failed to appear on the scheduled date, it is undisputed that he violated the principle condition of his bond.Â  Additionally, Hernandez violated the â€œgood behaviorâ€ condition of the bond given he was deported.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-20 (2003) (â€œEvery appearance recognizance or appearance bond will be conditioned on the person charged personally appearing before the court specified to answer the charge or indictment and to do and receive what shall be enjoined by the court, and not to depart the State, and to be of good behavior toward all the citizens thereof, or especially toward any person or persons specified by the court.â€).\r\nAs a result of Hernandezâ€™s default, Safety National became liable and, in turn, subject to forfeiture of the bond.Â  See Pride v. Anders, 266 S.C. 338, 341, 223 S.E.2d 184, 186 (1976) (â€œ[T]he obligation of appellant-surety was not to the State to produce defendants at the time to be later set, but was rather an obligation to answer, to the extent of the penalty, for the default of the defendants, as principals, in the event they did not appear on the date set for trial.Â  When the defendants defaulted by their failure to appear, the liability of the appellant, as surety, became fixed.â€); Ex parte Polk, 354 S.C. at 11, 579 S.E.2d at 330 (â€œAs guarantor, the surety on an appearance bond undertakes the risk of forfeiture in the event the defendant does not appear for trial.â€).\r\nThe question then becomes to what extent relief should have been granted due to the default.Â  Despite the circuit courtâ€™s failure to specifically enunciate either orally or in its written order the requisite factors, we find the court properly exercised its discretion in partially estreating the bond.Â  We believe implicit in the courtâ€™s ruling was a consideration of the factors.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFirst, Hernandezâ€™s failure to appear at the scheduled date or at the hearing date violated the purpose of the appearance bond.Â  Secondly, although Safety National claimed it could not apprehend Hernandez, it did not present any evidence to show that Hernandezâ€™s default was â€œan uncontrollable circumstance that arose through no faultâ€ on its part.Â  Reyes v. State, 31 S.W.3d 343, 346 (Tex. Ct. App. 2000) (affirming trial courtâ€™s order forfeiting bail bond where defendant had been deported to Mexico and did not appear in court on the scheduled date given Appellants did not establish â€œthe circumstances arose through no fault of the principalâ€); see Hillsborough County v. Roche Surety &amp; Cas. Co., 805 So. 2d 937, 939 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2001) (ordering bond forfeited where principal had fled to Mexico when the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service had revoked his work permit and the surety did not satisfy the requirement that it â€œsubstantially attempted to procure or cause the apprehensionâ€ of the principal). \r\nFurthermore, we find Safety Nationalâ€™s reliance on Taylor v. Taintor, 83 U.S. 366 (1872) and State v. Boatwright, 310 S.C. 281, 423 S.E.2d 139 (1992) is misplaced.\r\nIn Taylor, the defendant was arrested and charged for a crime committed in Connecticut.Â  He was then released on bond at which time he returned to New York, the state of his residence.Â  Shortly thereafter, he was extradited to Maine where he was tried and convicted of another charge.Â  Because the defendant failed to appear in court for his trial in Connecticut, the trial court forfeited the bond.Â  Taylor, 83 U.S. at 369.Â  On appeal, the surety claimed it had no notice of the charges against the defendant in Maine and, therefore, it could not be obligated on the bond because the performance of the bond had been rendered impossible.Â  Id.Â  The United States Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the trial court.Â  The Court found the surety was not discharged from liability given the defendantâ€™s default was not effectuated by an act of the State, but rather the defendantâ€™s own actions that could have been prevented by the surety.Â  Id. at 373.\r\nIn Boatwright, the defendant was arrested and charged with forgery.Â  He was subsequently released on an appearance bond.Â  Prior to the trial of his case, the defendant pled guilty to a charge in Georgia.Â  He was extradited and released from South Carolina to the Georgia authorities.Â  As a result, the defendant failed to appear for his forgery trial in South Carolina.Â  After a hearing, the circuit court estreated one-half of the bond amount.Â  \r\nOn appeal, the surety argued the State should have been estopped from estreating any part of the bond because the release of the defendant to Georgia prevented him from appearing in court.Â  Additionally, the surety asserted the circuit court erred in estreating a portion of the bond because the defendantâ€™s failure to appear was not willful.Â  Boatwright, 310 S.C. at 283, 423 S.E.2d at 140.Â  Our supreme court affirmed the decision of the circuit court.Â  Although the court recognized that a â€œsurety should be released from liability when estreatment is ordered for non-appearance after defendant has been extradited,â€ it relied on the fact that the bond was estreated not only for the defendantâ€™s non-appearance but also for his violation of the â€œgood behaviorâ€ condition of the bond.Â  Id. at 283, 423 S.E.2d at 140.Â  Thus, the court found the bond had been properly estreated due to the breach of the bond contract.Â  Id.Â  The court further concluded the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in estreating only half of the bond given the Stateâ€™s extradition aided in preventing the defendant from appearing on the scheduled date.Â  Id. at 283, 423 S.E.2d at 141.\r\nIn relying on Boatwright, Safety National merely references the following statement, â€œ[w]hen extradition is accomplished, the surety is no longer able to perform his obligation under the contract to deliver the defendant to court.â€Â  Id. at 283, 423 S.E.2d at 140.Â  Although this quote is accurate, it does not reflect the basis for the courtâ€™s decision.\r\nIn our view, the precedent established in Boatwright and Taylor supports the circuit courtâ€™s decision rather than Safety Nationalâ€™s argument.Â  The Boatwright decision stands for the proposition that bond is contractual in nature and the principle of estoppel does apply, however, any violation of the contract, i.e., the conditions of the bond, provides the Stateâ€™s right to bond estreatment.Â  Taylor stands for a corollary principle that the Stateâ€™s action must create the violation of the bond in order for the surety to be exonerated from liability.\r\nIn the instant case, it is undisputed that Hernandez, through no action of the State, violated the appearance condition and the good behavior condition of the bond.Â  Therefore, regardless of any government involvement in deportation, the breach of the bond contract supported the estreatment.Â  Moreover, as in Boatwright, the circuit court took into consideration the circumstances surrounding the detainment and deportation in deciding only to estreat one-half of Hernandezâ€™s bond.Â  \r\nTurning to the final factor in bond estreatment analysis, we find the State was prejudiced by Hernandezâ€™s failure to appear on the scheduled date.Â  Hernandez failure to appear on March 26, 2003, in conjunction with Safety Nationalâ€™s failure to present Hernandez at the hearing, created a delay for the State sufficient to constitute prejudice.Â  Holloway, 262 S.C. at 557, 206 S.E.2d at 824 (â€œCertainly, prejudice to the State appears when a defendant, without excuse, fails to appear at the time set for trial, thereby obstructing and delaying the orderly administration of justice.â€).Â  Furthermore, given the circuit court only estreated $2,000 of the $4,000 bond, we find the amount estreated was not so excessive to constitute an abuse of discretion.\r\nWe acknowledge the disposition of this case may seem harsh.Â  However, in view of the statutory guidelines and the above-outlined precedent, we are constrained to find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion.\r\nAccordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial

(collectively Defendants) filed a cross-appeal asserting the trial court erred in denying their request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We reverse the dismissal of Wallsâ€™ action and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 8, 2003, Teddy Walls, as the Owner of Crafts Unlimited, a sole proprietorship, entered into a contract with Ryan Arnold for construction of a restaurant, the Red Brick CafÃ©, in a strip mall owned by RAF Enterprises.Â  The contract price was $62,000.00.Â  Wallsâ€™ last day of work on the project was December 22, 2003.Â  In December of 2003, Walls incorporated his business under the name Crafts Unlimited Contractors, Inc (the Corporation).Â  Although Walls performed the work under the contract doing business as Crafts Unlimited, the sole proprietorship, he served and filed a notice and certificate of mechanicâ€™s lien he signed on behalf of the Corporation against RAF Enterprises on February 24, 2004.Â  The Corporation subsequently brought this action against RAF Enterprises seeking foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien as well as claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.Â  In its answer, RAF Enterprises claimed Walls contracted with The Red Brick CafÃ©, Inc and not RAF Enterprises.Â  Thus, it asserted The Red Brick CafÃ©, which was the proper party to the action, was not named as a party.Â  Furthermore, it alleged the Corporation was not a party to the written agreement and thus lacked standing to bring the action as it could not establish an agreement with it to perform work.Â  \r\nOn June 7, 2004, Walls filed an amended summons and complaint and lis pendens under his own name, formerly doing business as Crafts Unlimited, asserting claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  In this complaint, he named RAF Enterprises, Ryan Arnold, and Red Brick CafÃ©, Inc. as defendants.[2]Â  The Defendants moved for partial summary judgment on the claim for foreclosure of the mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  \r\nThe trial court found it was undisputed the Corporation did not contract to provide labor and materials, nor did Walls produce any document evidencing a novation wherein the Defendants agreed that its contract was to be assigned to the Corporation.Â  The court held the Corporation never acquired any lien rights upon which to base a lien claim.Â  The court noted that Wallsâ€™ counsel admitted that Walls mistakenly used the corporate name when filing the mechanicâ€™s lien. It ruled Walls, the current plaintiff, was a different, distinct entity from the Corporation.Â  It held that since it had been more than ninety days since Walls had done any work on the subject property, the error in naming the wrong party could not be cured.Â  Thus, as Walls did not timely file a notice of mechanicâ€™s lien, the mechanicâ€™s lien action must be dismissed.\r\nAs an additional sustaining ground, the court held that since the entity that filed the mechanicâ€™s lien was not properly licensed, it lacked standing to assert such a lien or lawsuit.Â  The court denied the Defendantsâ€™ request for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWalls argues the trial court erred in holding his notice of mechanicâ€™s lien and foreclosure action were not timely served and filed.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAs a mechanicâ€™s lien is purely statutory, the requirements of the statute must be strictly followed.Â  Muller v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 303 S.C. 137, 140, 399 S.E.2d 430, 432 (Ct. App. 1990), overruled on other grounds by Myrtle Beach Hosp., Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 341 S.C. 1, 532 S.E.2d 868 (2000).Â Â  If any one of these requirements is not met, the lien against the property is dissolved.Â  Id. at 141, 399 S.E.2d at 432.Â  However, as the mechanicâ€™s lien statutes are remedial, they are to be given a liberal construction. Â Clo-Car Trucking Co. v. Clifflue Estates of S.C., 282 S.C. 573, 575-76, 320 S.E.2d 51, 53 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\nThe mechanicâ€™s lien statutes set forth the time limits in which a person seeking to enforce a mechanicâ€™s lien must serve and file the notice and certificate of lien and foreclosure action.Â  Section 29-5-90 of the South Carolina Code provides the time limits for serving and filing the notice of lien: \r\n\r\n[A mechanicâ€™s] lien shall be dissolved unless the person desiring to avail himself thereof, within ninety days after he ceases to labor on or furnish labor or materials for such building or structure, serves upon the owner or, in the event the owner cannot be found, upon the person in possession and files in the office of the register of deeds or clerk of court of the county in which the building or structure is situated a statement of a just and true account of the amount due him, with all just credits given, together with a description of the property intended to be covered by the lien sufficiently accurate for identification, with the name of the owner of the property, if known, which certificate shall be subscribed and sworn to by the person claiming the lien or by someone in his behalf and shall be recorded in a book kept for the purpose by the register or clerk who shall be entitled to the same fees therefor as for recording mortgages of equal length. . . . \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-90 (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nA suit to enforce the lien must be commenced within six months of the cessation of labor.Â  S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-120 (1991). \r\nIn the present case, Walls filed his amended summons and complaint and lis pendens within six months of his cessation of labor.Â  Thus, he complied with section 29-5-120 in timely commencing his suit to enforce the mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  The amended action, however, was served and filed well after the 90-day time limit set forth in section 29-5-90 for serving and filing the notice of mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Therefore, we must decide whether the notice served and filed on February 24, 2004 meets the requirements of the statute to preserve Wallsâ€™ lien.Â  \r\nWalls, â€œthe person desiring to avail himselfâ€ of the lien, signed the notice himself, albeit on behalf of the Corporation.Â  He also signed the affidavit of mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  Walls merely captioned the notice with the Corporationâ€™s name.\r\n\r\nWhere the purpose of the requirement that a particular statement be included in the claim of lien has been achieved and no one is prejudiced, technical requirements should not stand in the way of achieving the purposes of the mechanicâ€™s lien law.Â  Even though a claim contains some defect or error it will be upheld where the owner is informed of the claim and not misled by it or prejudiced.Â  \r\n\r\n53 Am.Jur. 2d Mechanicâ€™s Liens Â§ 235 (1996).\r\nThe Defendants presented no evidence that they were misled by this caption or that they were prejudiced in any manner.Â  In fact, it is impossible to discern how they could have been misled considering the documents were signed by Walls and the Corporationâ€™s name is the same as the name of Wallsâ€™ sole proprietorship.Â  We find under the facts of this case, Walls timely perfected his mechanicâ€™s lien.Â  \r\nAs an additional holding, the trial court held that since the entity that filed the mechanicâ€™s lien, the Corporation, was not properly licensed, it lacked standing to assert such a lien or lawsuit.Â  The Corporation, however, is no longer a party in this suit.Â  Walls, who is properly licensed, is the only party seeking to enforce the lien.Â  The Corporationâ€™s lack of a license has no bearing on Wallsâ€™ claim against the Defendants.\r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Wallsâ€™ action to foreclose the mechanicâ€™s lien is \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.[3]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Synovus Financial Corporation, d/b/a The National Bank of South Carolina was also named as a defendant.Â  The bank is not a party to this appeal.Â  \r\n[3] As we reverse the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Wallsâ€™ foreclosure action, we need not address the Defendantsâ€™ claims that they were entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-096","title":"Smith v.

Wayne Floyd, of W. Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam T. Toal, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Larry Bloome appeals from an order finding he was not the owner of 9.9 acres of land in Orangeburg County, alleging that he is the owner of the land because he paid the purchase price, he has title by adverse possession, and he is entitled to money under the betterment statute.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAda Johnson died in 1992, devising all of her property to Fred Johnson, who then died in 1993.Â  After his death, Louise Smith, a resident of New York, was appointed as the personal representative of Fredâ€™s estate and became the sole heir of a 9.9-acre piece of land located in Orangeburg County.Â  Ada owned the land originally, but Fred inherited it when she died. \r\nSmith testified that before Ada died she told her she was going to sell some of the property, but then Ada became sick, and as a result, she did not pursue it any further.Â  Smith further testified she knew that Bloome, her distant cousin, kept animals on the land; however, Bloome began building a house on the land without her prior knowledge.Â  Smith said she was going to give Bloome the one-acre section of land on which he built his house, but Bloome failed to hire a surveyor and then became rude to her, so she told him he had to buy the land from her.Â  When Bloome refused to pay Smith for the land she sent a realtor to make him pay rent, which he also refused to do. \r\nOn January 16, 2001, Smith brought an action in Magistrateâ€™s Court to evict Bloome as a tenant from the property.Â  Bloome counterclaimed, alleging he was the owner of the land because he paid the purchase price, he had title by adverse possession, he had greatly increased the value of the property when he built a house on it, Smith was unjustly enriched, and Smith should be estopped from asserting Bloome did not own the property.Â  After being transferred to the Court of Common Pleas per Bloomeâ€™s motion, a hearing was held on December 5, 2001.Â  On May 10, 2002, the judge entered a judgment for Smith and ordered that Bloome be ejected from the premises.Â  Bloome filed a Motion for Rehearing, Reconsideration and for a New Trial on May 23, 2002, which was denied by an Order filed on November 10, 2004.Â  On December 14, 2004, Bloome filed his Notice of Appeal with this court.Â  Subsequently, on December 30, 2004, Bloome filed a motion to stay ejection in the Court of Common Pleas.Â  The judge issued an order on February 28, 2005, staying ejectment, but requiring Bloome to pay $750 per month into escrow pending the outcome of the appeal. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â \r\nTownes Assoc., Ltd. v.

Leaird, 307 S.C. 56, 61, 413 S.E.2d 841, 844 (1992).Â  Bloome claims that he occupied the property for the ten-year statutory period; however, the trial judge found that Bloomeâ€™s possession was not hostile because he lived on the property with Adaâ€™s permission and Smith continued Bloomeâ€™s permissive use for a period of time after she inherited the land.Â  Therefore, the trial judge was correct in finding that Bloome did not gain possession of the land by adverse possession.\r\nBloome argues the trial court erred when it ruled that he did not own the land because he paid the purchase price for the land.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt trial, Bloome testified that he purchased the 9.9 acres of land from Ada before she died and he had two receipts from her for the sale of the land.Â  However, the trial judge determined that Ada did not write the receipts because the handwriting on the receipts differed from a sample of Adaâ€™s signature that was admitted at trial as an exhibit.Â  Furthermore, the judge stated that even if he accepted the authenticity of the receipts, they did not describe the property to be conveyed nor did they show the purchase price.Â  Additionally, the judge held that because Bloome did not have a deed to the land and has never had a deed to the land, or any other written document signed by Ada, he failed to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10(4) (1991).Â  Thus, the trial judge was correct in finding that Bloome did not acquire the property by paying the purchase price.Â Â Â  \r\nBloome argues the trial court erred when it ruled that he was not entitled to reimbursement for his substantial improvements to the property under the betterments statute.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo recover under the betterments statute, â€œit is incumbent on [Bloome] not merely to show the value of his improvements, but he must present evidence from which the jury can find a special verdict stating the value of the land without the improvements and the value of the land with the improvements . . . .â€Â  Hall v. Boatwright, 58 S.C. 544, 547, 36 S.E. 1001, 1002 (1900).Â  At trial, Bloome presented evidence of the value of his house; however, he failed to present evidence of the value of the land without the improvements or the value of the land with the improvements.Â  Additionally, the betterments statute requires for Bloome to have believed that he was the exclusive owner of the land.Â  Id. at 547-548, 36 S.E. at 1002-1003.Â  The trial judge found that Bloome knew that he did not have a deed to the land and that he could have checked with the Register of Deeds to determine if a deed had been recorded.Â  Therefore, the trial judge was correct in holding that Bloomeâ€™s claim failed under the betterments statute.Â  \r\nBloome argues the trial court erred when it ruled that he had to pay $750 a month to stay ejection from the property during the appeal.Â  \r\nRule 203(d)(2)(B), SCACR, requires an appellant to file along with their notice of appeal, a â€œcopy of the order(s) and judgment(s) which are to be challenged on appeal.â€Â  Bloome filed a motion to stay ejection in the trial court after he filed his notice of appeal with this court.Â  Bloome did not file an amended notice of appeal with this court subsequent to the trial courtâ€™s ruling on the motion to stay; therefore, this issue is not properly before us.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-097","title":"Wall v.

Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJohn Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  On July 12, 2002, John D. Griffith pled guilty to one count of criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature (CDVHAN) and two counts of criminal domestic violence (CDV) third offense.Â  He was sentenced to seven years, suspended upon the service of three years with three years of probation for the CDVHAN, and concurrent terms of eighteen months on each of the CDV third offense charges.Â  Following a probation revocation hearing, the court revoked Griffithâ€™s probation and reinstated the balance of his suspended sentence.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn April 2, 2004, a probation arrest warrant was issued charging Griffith with violating the terms of his probation.Â  Specifically, the warrant affidavit alleged there was probable cause to believe Griffith committed the offense of CDV on April 2, 2004.Â  It further alleged Griffith had failed to pay supervision fees and court costs as instructed, and that he failed to follow the advice and instructions of his supervising agent.Â  \r\nA probation revocation hearing was held on April 22, 2004, at which time Griffith appeared without counsel.Â  The probation revocation court noted the State was recommending revocation of his probation and that Griffith had four years remaining on his original sentence.Â  Because Griffith was exposed to being returned to prison, the court asked Griffith why he did not have an attorney.Â  Griffith stated that he did not have the funds to secure counsel, but had inquired at the public defenderâ€™s office and was told he did not qualify for a public defender based on the wages he had been earning.Â  Griffith stated he was willing to waive his right to counsel.Â  The court then stated:\r\n\r\nDo you understand that a lawyer would represent you better than you would represent yourself, sir, because a lawyer, he or she, would know whatever defenses you may have in fact or in law to these charges.Â  And also because a lawyer would probably have a working relationship with probation or with the Court that may be able to work a better arrangement for you than you could work yourself.Â  And then finally, because a lawyer would know of any defenses you have, any legal defenses, a lawyer would be able to assert those for you and you might not even be aware of them.Â  Are you aware of all those things, sir?\r\n\r\nGriffith indicated he was aware of that, but still wished to go forward without an attorney.Â  The court found Griffith was aware of his right to and the benefits of counsel and determined he had made a knowing waiver of counsel.Â  \r\nAlong with a CDV charge, Griffith was charged with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon, all stemming from an April 2, 2004 incident after Griffith followed his wife, their two children and a neighbor in the neighborâ€™s car and allegedly swerved his car toward the vehicle in which they were riding.Â  Griffith claimed he did not swerve his car into the other car, but was merely attempting to wave to his children in the car when his car veered over a little toward the other car.Â  He maintained it was simply an accident, and he did not try to run the other car off the road.Â  He further denied being in arrears on the fees and costs.Â  Griffith presented his wife on his behalf, who testified Griffith was not trying to run her off the road that day, but was only waving at the children.Â  She claimed she had not hesitated to press charges against him in the past and would have done so again had he attempted to hurt her.Â  \r\nThe probation agent countered that the reporting officer indicated the wife refused to sign a statement â€œbecause she was scared to, and stated she had enough problems with the suspect and did not want her name on anything.â€Â  The State maintained the wifeâ€™s testimony was given out of fear, and that the amount of violence involved in the initial charge supported this position and showed the wife was â€œcovering for Mr. Griffith.â€Â  The agent further noted the complainant in this charge was actually a third individual who was in another car and witnessed the incident, believing it to be a deliberate act which warranted her calling the police.Â  \r\nThe court found Griffith was in violation of the terms of his probation and revoked his probation, requiring him to serve his remaining four years.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Griffith asserts the court erred in finding he waived his right to counsel because the court failed to warn him of the dangers of self-representation.Â  He thus contends the court did not comply with the mandates of Huckaby v. State, 305 S.C. 331, 408 S.E.2d 242 (1991) and Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975).Â Â  \r\nWe first note the State argues this issue is not preserved for our review because Griffith failed to raise the issue below and the court did not rule upon it.Â  We disagree.Â  Our supreme court has held â€œ[a] notable exception to [the] general rule requiring a contemporaneous objection is found when the record does not reveal a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel.Â  The pro se defendant cannot be expected to raise this issue without the aid of counsel.â€Â  State v. Rocheville, 310 S.C. 20, 25 n.4, 425 S.E.2d 32, 35 n.4 (1993) (citation omitted).Â  Accordingly, we find the issue is properly before us on appeal.\r\nWe find, however, no merit to Griffithâ€™s assertion that the court erred in finding a valid waiver of his right to counsel.Â  â€œThe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of our Constitution guarantee that a person brought to trial in any state or federal court must be afforded the right to the assistance of counsel before he can be validly convicted and punished by imprisonment.â€Â  Faretta, 422 U.S. at 807.Â  The right to counsel attaches in probation revocation hearings and the requirements for waiving the right to counsel in a probation revocation hearing are the same requirements as apply when a defendant desires to waive his right to counsel in a trial.Â  Salley v. State, 306 S.C. 213, 215, 410 S.E.2d 921, 922 (1991).Â  \r\nâ€œFaretta requires that a defendant â€˜be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation so that the record will establish he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.â€™â€Â  Wroten v. State, 301 S.C. 293, 294, 391 S.E.2d 575, 576 (1990) (quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835).Â  As part of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the requirement that an accused be apprised of that right, the record must demonstrate that the probation revocation judge conducted a hearing to determine whether a request to proceed pro se was accompanied by a knowing and intelligent waiver.Â  Huckaby, 305 S.C. at 335, 408 S.E.2d at 244.Â  The record must reflect that the defendantâ€™s decision to represent himself was made with an understanding of the risks of self-representation, and that the defendant was made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.Â  Id. â€œWhile a specific inquiry by the trial judge expressly addressing the disadvantages of a pro se defense is preferred, the ultimate test is not the trial judgeâ€™s advice but rather the defendantâ€™s understanding.â€ Wroten v. State, 301 S.C. at 294, 391 S.E.2d at 576.Â  â€œIf the record demonstrates the defendantâ€™s decision to represent himself was made with an understanding of the risks of self-representation, the requirements of a voluntary waiver will be satisfied.â€Â  Id.Â  (citations omitted).Â  In the absence of a specific inquiry by the probation revocation judge to determine whether the defendant has made his decision to proceed pro se â€œwith eyes open,â€ the appellate court will look to the record to discern whether there are facts to show the defendant had sufficient background or was apprised of his rights by some other source so as to constitute a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel.Â  Salley, 306 S.C. at 215, 410 S.E.2d at 922.\r\nHere, the court informed Griffith that a lawyer â€œwould represent [him] betterâ€ than he could represent himself, that a lawyer would know what defenses he may have in fact or in law to the charges, a lawyer would have a relationship with the court and probation that could result in a better arrangement than Griffith may be able to attain on his own, a lawyer would be better able to assert any legal defenses Griffith might have, and that Griffith might not even be aware of available defenses.Â  Although the court did not use the words â€œdangersâ€ or â€œdisadvantagesâ€ in informing Griffith of his rights, it is clear the court explained to Griffith that he would lose the specific benefits of counsel if he proceeded pro se.Â  Implicit in this explanation was that Griffith would be disadvantaged by not having an attorney represent him in the matter.\r\nThis is not like Huckaby, wherein the probation revocation judge asked two questions, merely apprising Huckaby of his right to counsel and asking if he wished to waive the right.Â  Huckaby, 305 S.C. at 336, 408 S.E.2d at 245.Â  Further, unlike the situation in Huckaby, the record in the case at hand does not reflect that Griffith was under the impression the revocation hearing was a mere informal procedure conducted as a formality to have probation continued.Â  Id.Â  Here, the trial judge specifically asked Griffith why he did not have counsel representing him on the matter in light of the fact that the State was recommending revocation of his probation and that Griffith had four years remaining on his original sentence and thus was exposed to prison time.\r\nThe record before us reflects that Griffithâ€™s decision to represent himself was made with an understanding of the risks of self-representation, and that he was made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.Â  Accordingly, the requirements of a voluntary waiver have been satisfied and we find Griffithâ€™s waiver of counsel to be valid.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Griffithâ€™s revocation of probation is\r\nAFFIRMED. 1\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-100","title":"Anderson v.

Graham, of Conway, for Appellants.\r\nJohnnyÂ  Morant, of Georgetown, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Linda Greene and Frank Greene, III appeal the order of the circuit court affirming the probate courtâ€™s dismissal of their claims against the estate of Deloris Anderson for rents collected by Anderson and for fraud.Â  We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nAnderson was the Greenesâ€™ aunt.Â  When Andersonâ€™s father, Frank Greene Sr., passed away on October 8, 1980, he left as his only heirs at law Anderson and the Greenes, whose father, Frank Greene, Jr., had predeceased Frank Sr.Â  Although Frank Sr.â€™s estate was never formally administered, the Greenes presented three deeds dated July 23, 1981 purporting to divide Frank Sr.â€™s estate.Â  One deed was ostensibly signed by Anderson and Linda to convey their interest in two lots to Frank III, one deed was ostensibly signed by Anderson and Frank III to convey their interest in a lot to Linda, and the final deed was ostensibly signed by Linda and Frank III conveying their interest in a lot to Anderson.Â  The mailing address on the deeds to Linda and Frank III was listed as in care of Anderson at her address.Â  The Greenes lived out of state at this time.Â  At the hearing, they claimed to have no knowledge of the deeds and denied ever signing any of them.Â  \r\nIt was not until after Andersonâ€™s death that another relative discovered the deeds and informed the Greenes that they existed.Â  Although Anderson rented all of the properties, she never shared any of the rents with the Greenes.Â  The Greenes filed a claim against Andersonâ€™s estate seeking $117,522.70 for their share of the rents.Â  The personal representative of Andersonâ€™s estate denied the claim.Â  \r\nThe probate court found that because the Greenes testified that their signatures on the deeds into them were forged, the deeds were not genuine and were â€œmerely bogus documents.â€Â  Thus it held the Greenes could not prove title to the properties through the deeds.Â  In addition, the court ruled that because Frank Sr.â€™s estate had never been probated and there had not been any quiet title action, the Greenes could not establish their title to the property as Frank Sr.â€™s heirs.Â  On the Greenesâ€™ claim for fraud, the court ruled they had failed to establish all of the essential elements for the cause of action.Â  Thus, the probate court denied the Greenesâ€™ claims against Andersonâ€™s estate.Â  The circuit court affirmed the probate courtâ€™s order.Â  This appeal followed. Â Â \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard of review \r\nThe Greenes first argue the circuit court applied the incorrect standard of review in deciding the appeal of the probate courtâ€™s order.Â  We disagree. \r\nOn appeal from the final order of the probate court, the circuit court should apply the same standard of review that the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals would apply on appeal.Â  In re Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 361, 434 S.E.2d 254, 257 (1993).Â  This appeal involves a claim for money due from an estate and a claim for fraud.Â  As the circuit court correctly held, both are actions at law.Â  See Howard v. Mutz, 315 S.C. 356, 362, 434 S.E.2d 254, 258 (1993) (stating a claim for money due from an estate sounds in law); Perry v. Heirs at Law and Distributees of Charles Gadsden, 313 S.C. 296, 301, 437 S.E.2d 174, 177 (Ct.App.1993) affâ€™d as modified by 316 S.C. 224, 449 S.E.2d 250 (1994) (stating fraud is an action at law unless an equitable remedy is sought).Â  Thus, we hold the circuit court did not err in applying the standard of review for an action at law.Â  \r\nThis standard of review provides: â€œon appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â \r\nTownes Associates, Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  However, the appellate court may correct errors of law without deference to the lower court.Â  State ex rel Condon v. City of Columbia, 339 S.C. 8, 13, 528 S.E.2d 408, 410 (2000).\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ownership of property \r\nThe Greenes next argue the probate court erred in denying their creditorâ€™s claim because they had not established an ownership interest in the properties. \r\nWe agree with the Greenes that the probate court committed an error of law by holding that the deeds into the Greenes were invalid due to the forged signatures.Â  â€œWhere the signature of one grantor on a deed is genuine but the signature of the other grantor is a forgery, the deed is only partially valid and is effective to convey only the interest of the grantor whose interest is genuine.â€ 23 Am.Jur.2d Deeds Â§ 164 (2002).Â  Neither party challenges the probate courtâ€™s conclusion that the Greenesâ€™ signatures on the deed were forged.Â  However, there was no evidence presented at the hearing that Andersonâ€™s signatures on the deeds were also forged.Â  Thus, while the transfers of the Greenesâ€™ interests through the deeds were invalid, the transfers of Andersonâ€™s interests to the Greenes were valid and effectively conveyed her interests.Â  \r\nIn addition, we find the probate court erred in holding the Greenes failed to establish title or ownership to real property absent probate of Frank Sr.â€™s estate, a quiet title suit, or a confirmation of title action. \r\nTitle to real property vests in the heir or heirs immediately on the death of the intestate, subject to probate administration.Â  Carter v. Wroten, 187 S.C. 432, 435, 198 S.E. 13, 15 (1938); S.C. Jur. Descent &amp; Distribution, Â§ 24 (1998).Â  â€œIn fact the proof of death of an intestate decedent raises the presumption that his real property descended to his heirs.â€Â  28 S.C. Jur. Descent &amp; Distribution Â§ 24 (citing Pinkney v. Knowles, 112 S.C. 7, 10, 99 S.E. 354, 355 (1919)).Â  From the record it appears the Greenes and Anderson were Frank Sr.â€™s heirs at law, that Frank Sr. owned the disputed properties, and that he died intestate.Â  We find the probate court committed an error of law in holding the Greenes could not establish their rights to the properties absent probate administration of Frank Sr.â€™s estate or action to quiet title or confirm title.Â  However, as it is unclear whether the Greenes and Anderson were Frank Sr.â€™s only heirs, the court on remand should determine the Greenesâ€™ intestate interests in the properties and Andersonâ€™s intestate interests that passed to the Greenes through the deeds. \r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fraud \r\nFinally, the Greenes argue the probate court erred in finding they failed to establish a cause of action for fraud.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nIn order to establish actual fraud, a party must prove:Â  \r\n  \r\n(1) a representation; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) either knowledge of its falsity or reckless disregard of its truth or falsity; (5) intent that the representation be acted upon; (6) the hearerâ€™s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the hearerâ€™s reliance on its truth; (8) the hearerâ€™s right to rely thereon; and (9) the hearerâ€™s consequent and proximate injury.\r\n  \r\n\r\nSorin Equip. Co. v. The Firm, Inc., 323 S.C. 359, 365, 474 S.E.2d 819, 823 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  To establish constructive fraud, the party must establish all elements of actual fraud except the element of intent.Â \r\nArdis v. Cox, 314 S.C. 512, 516, 431 S.E.2d 267, 269 (Ct. App.1993).Â  The failure to prove any element of fraud is fatal to the action.Â \r\nSorin Equip Co., 323 S.C. at 366, 474 S.E.2d at 823. Furthermore, â€œ[f]raud cannot be presumed; it must be proved by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence.â€Â  Foxfire Village, Inc. v. Black &amp; Veatch, Inc., 304 S.C. 366, 374, 404 S.E.2d 912, 917 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\nThe probate court held the Greenes failed to establish the element of misrepresentation.Â  The Greenes maintained that they knew nothing about the deeds or the rents collected by Anderson until after Andersonâ€™s death.Â  We agree with the probate court that the record is entirely devoid of any evidence of any type of representation, either verbal or by conduct made to them by Anderson.Â  \r\nThe Greenes correctly assert that â€œacts, conduct, or supression of the truth may constitute fraud.â€Â  See Carter v. Boyd Constr., 255 S.C. 274, 178 S.E.2d 536 (1971).Â  However, â€œ[n]on-disclosure becomes fraudulent concealment only when it is the duty of the party having knowledge of the facts to make them known to the other party to the transaction.â€Â  Lawson v. Citizens &amp; S. Natl.Â  Bank of S.C., 259 S.C. 477, 481-82, 193 S.E.2d 124, 126 (1972).Â  Although the Greenes assert â€œDeloris Anderson had an implicit duty to advise the Appellants of their ownership[,]â€ they fail to set forth any basis upon which such a duty to disclose arose.Â  See Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 673-74, 582 S.E.2d 432, 445-46 (Ct. App. 2003) (stating the duty to disclose may arise from (1) a preexisting fiduciary relationship; (2) where in the particular transaction in question one party expressly reposes a trust and confidence in the other or where from the circumstances of the case, the nature of their dealings, or their position towards each other, such a trust and confidence in the particular case is necessarily implied; and (3) â€œwhere the very contract or transaction itself, in its essential nature, is intrinsically fiduciary and necessarily calls for perfect good faith and full disclosure without regard to any particular intention of the partiesâ€).Â  \r\nNot only did the Greenes fail to present any evidence of a representation, they also failed to present evidence of their detrimental reliance or their right to rely.Â  Accordingly, we agree with the probate court that the Greenesâ€™ claim of fraud fails as a matter of law.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the probate courtâ€™s denial of the Greenesâ€™ claims for fraud.Â  We reverse the circuit courtâ€™s affirmance of the probate courtâ€™s order holding the Greenes may not maintain a claim for money due from Andersonâ€™s estate and remand for further proceedings.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-101","title":"Huggins v.

[1]  \r\nFACTS\r\nHuggins and Christopher W. Catledge were divorced in 2000.Â  In accordance with the partiesâ€™ joint custody agreement, Catledge was granted primary custody of their son Christian.Â  At the time of the hearing in this action, Christian was seven.Â  In September of 2003, Huggins brought the current action seeking a change of custody.Â  In her complaint, Huggins requested a guardian ad litem be appointed.Â  After a temporary hearing on July 8, 2004, the family court sent a letter to Catledgeâ€™s attorney with instructions for preparation of an order.Â  In this letter, the court denied Hugginsâ€™ request for appointment of the guardian.Â  The record on appeal, however, does not contain any order from this hearing.Â  \r\nAfter a final hearing, the family court issued an order holding the change of circumstances relied upon by Huggins was insufficient to justify a change of custody.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280 S.E.2d 541 (1981).Â  Our broad scope of review does not relieve appellant of her burden to convince this Court that the family court committed error.Â  Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guardian ad Litem\r\nHuggins argues the family court erred in refusing to appoint a guardian ad litem.Â  We first question whether this issue is properly before this court.Â  After the temporary hearing, the family court sent a letter to the parties stating that it was denying the request for appointment of a guardian.Â  Although the court instructed Catledgeâ€™s attorney to prepare an order, it does not appear from the record that any such order was ever entered.Â  \r\nAn order is not final until it is written and entered by the clerk of court. Â First Union Natâ€™l Bank of S.C. v. Hitman, Inc., 306 S.C. 327, 411 S.E.2d 681 (Ct. App. 1991), affâ€™d, 308 S.C. 421, 418 S.E.2d 545 (1992).Â  Until an order is written and entered by the clerk of court, the judge retains discretion to change his mind and amend his ruling accordingly.Â  Id.Â  An oral ruling is not a final ruling on the merits nor is it binding on the parties until it has been reduced to writing, signed by the judge, and delivered for recordation.Â  Bayne v. Bass, 302 S.C. 208, 394 S.E.2d 726 (Ct.App.1990) The Decree must be in writing and until such time the judge may modify, amend or rescind such an oral ruling.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe family court in its letter even cautioned:Â  â€œAs always, I reserve the right to change or modify this decision prior to signing the order.â€Â  Accordingly, we find that as Huggins failed to secure a final ruling on request for appointment of a guardian, she may not raise this issue on appeal.Â  \r\nFurthermore, we find no reversible error in the family courtâ€™s denial of the request for appointment of a guardian.Â  \r\n\r\nSection 20-7-1545 provides:\r\n  \r\nIn a private action before the family court in which custody or visitation of a minor child is an issue, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem only when it determines that:\r\n(1) without a guardian ad litem, the court will likely not be fully informed about the facts of the case and there is a substantial dispute which necessitates a guardian ad litem; or\r\n(2) both parties consent to the appointment of a guardian ad litem who is approved by the court . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1545 (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).\r\nIn private actions, a guardian â€œfunctions as a representative of the court, appointed to assist the court in making its determination of custody by advocating for the best interest of the children and providing the court with an objective view.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 287, 555 S.E.2d 386, 389 (2001).Â  However, the family court judge, not the guardian, is the ultimate decision-maker with respect to visitation and the best interest of the child.Â  Arnal v. Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 609 S.E.2d 821 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\nIn its letter, the court stated it was temporarily denying the request for a guardian noting that it could not make a finding that it would not be fully informed of the facts without such an appointment.Â  The parties presented numerous witnesses who testified as to Christianâ€™s education, dental care, and home life, and the new stability in the motherâ€™s life.Â  The family court, which was the ultimate decision maker with regards to the custody of the child, was able to make its decision based on the evidence presented.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in its denial of Hugginsâ€™ request for appointment of a guardian.Â  \r\n2.Â  Change of custody\r\nHuggins argues the family court erred in failing to find a change of circumstances sufficient to warrant a change of custody and in holding it was in Christianâ€™s best interests to stay with his father.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nBecause the best interest of the child is the overriding concern in all child custody matters, when a non-custodial parent seeks a change in custody, the non-custodial parent must establish the following:Â  (1) there has been a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child and (2) a change in custody is in the overall best interests of the child.Â  Latimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 602 S.E.2d 32 (2004).Â  As the one seeking the change of custody, Huggins bears the burden of establishing both of these criteria.Â  Id.Â  In reaching a determination as to custody, the family court should consider how the custody decision will impact all areas of the childâ€™s life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, educational, familial, emotional, and recreational aspects.Â  Additionally, the court must assess each partyâ€™s character, fitness, and attitude as they impact the child.Â  Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 330, 536 S.E.2d 427, 430 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nHuggins asserts several changed circumstances that she claims justify a change of circumstances.Â  Since the original custody agreement, Huggins has remarried and established a more stable home environment.Â  She and her new husband have a child, who was nineteen months old at the time of the hearing.Â  Remarriage alone is not sufficient to warrant a change in custody.Â  Fisher v. Miller, 288 S.C. 576, 344 S.E.2d 149 (1986).Â  Catledge has also moved since the divorce.Â  The supreme court held, â€œ[A] change in Fatherâ€™s residence is not itself a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of Child, which justifies a change in custody.â€Â  Latimer, 360 S.C. at 382, 602 S.E.2d at 35.\r\nHuggins contends that she has now taken a job that allows her to spend more time with the child than the father can.Â  Huggins works until 3:30 each day and would be able to be with Christian until his bedtime.Â  Catledge is currently working third shift, from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m, Sunday through Thursday.Â  On the nights he works, Christian and Catledgeâ€™s daughter from a prior relationship spend the night at Catledgeâ€™s motherâ€™s home.Â  Catledgeâ€™s mother testified the children love staying with her overnight.Â  Although Catledge may be away from the children while they sleep, he is available to care for them during normal waking hours.Â  \r\nHuggins also contends that Catledge neglected Christianâ€™s dental care.Â  At his visit on June 13, 2002, Christian was diagnosed as having four cavities in his back teeth.Â  The dentistâ€™s records clerk testified that children usually do not lose these teeth until they are ten to twelve years old.Â  Christian missed the next scheduled appointment a month later and did not return to the dentist until over a year later.Â  At that time, in addition to one new cavity, the four original cavities remained with one in need of a possible pulpectomy[2].Â  Catledge testified that the dentist told him that he had an option of delaying treatment if the cavities were not causing the child any pain.Â  In addition, Catledge stated the delay was due to his trying to obtain insurance cards from Huggins so he could take Christian to the dentist.Â  Christian has since had the cavities filled one at a time and is having regular dental visits.Â  The family court concluded that the childâ€™s dental needs were not neglected by the father.Â  \r\nFinally, Huggins contends the fact that Christian failed first grade is grounds for a change of custody.Â  Christianâ€™s teacher testified that although the child was well behaved in class, he was a slow learner who did better in math than in reading.Â  His performance was inconsistent with his doing better one six-weeks and then not as well the next six-weeks.Â  She stated that there were times when he needed extra help at home and Catledge always responded to her requests for extra help, including coming in for conferences.Â  Catledge authorized the child to enroll in the programs available to assist Christian and Christian successfully completed these programs.Â  However, at the end of the year, Christian was right on the borderline and after conferencing, the teacher and Catledge decided to hold the child back.Â  The teacher testified there was nothing that could have been done over the summer that would have enabled the child to be promoted to second grade.Â  \r\nHuggins admitted that she had no contact with Christianâ€™s school until after she learned that he would not be promoted.Â  At this point she contacted a tutor for the child, although Catledge hired someone else to tutor him.Â  In addition, after Catledge informed her no summer school was available, Huggins discovered an available summer school program, which Catledge enrolled the child in.Â  However, Catledge allowed the child to miss one week of the four-week class to go to church camp.Â  Huggins acknowledged that at the time of the hearing, the child was doing fine in school with no extra tutorial help.Â  We find no evidence that Catledge was neglectful of the childâ€™s educational needs.Â  \r\nThe child attends church with Catledge at the same church Hugginsâ€™ parents attend.Â  Catledge testified the child is in the R.A. program and would be playing on the basketball team.Â  Catledge will be coaching.Â  \r\nThe family court noted that both parties acknowledge that the other party is a fit parent.Â  It held, â€œ[The child] is doing well in the care of his father in an environment where he is comfortable and surrounded by family and friends.Â  Disrupting that custodial arrangement would not be in his best interests.â€Â  An appellate court â€œshould be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that of the trial court.â€Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  Considering the record as a whole, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s denial of Hugginsâ€™ request for a change of custody.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order of the family court denying Hugginsâ€™ request for a change of custody based on a change of circumstances is \r\n AFFIRMED.Â  \r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] There is no evidence in the record that the child actually had a pulpectomy.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-102","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Raymond Jackson appeals his conviction for distribution of crack cocaine.Â  He argues the trial court erred in denying a directed verdict of acquittal because the State did not present sufficient evidence of his guilt.Â  We review the refusal of a directed verdict in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Creech, 314 S.C. 76, 441 S.E.2d 635 (Ct. App. 199).Â  In a criminal case, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not with its weight.Â  State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 535 S.E.2d 126 (2000).Â  The trial court must submit the case to the jury â€œif there is any substantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn this case, the State presented ample evidence reasonably tending to prove Jacksonâ€™s guilt.Â  Two police officers testified to the controlled drug purchase that led to the arrest of Jackson for distribution of crack cocaine.Â  The officers hired another individual to perform the purchase; that individual wore a wire during the transaction, which recorded Jackson, and identified Jackson in court as the purchaser of the crack cocaine.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying Jacksonâ€™s motion for directed verdict.Â  Accordingly, after a thorough review of the record and Jacksonâ€™s brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), and State v. Williams, 305 S.C. 116, 406 S.E.2d 357 (1991), we dismiss[1] defendantâ€™s appeal and grant counselâ€™s motion to be relieved. \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-103","title":"State v.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Christina Theos Adams, of Anderson; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Johnny Knight was convicted of possession of methamphetamine (or â€œcrankâ€) and sentenced to two years imprisonment, suspended upon the service of two years probation.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 3, 2003, Deputy Stanley Jones, Jr., from the Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Department noticed a vehicle weaving on the road, and he stopped the vehicle.Â  After the female driver failed the field sobriety test, Deputy Jones arrested her for driving under the influence.Â  A search incident to arrest produced crank.Â  Deputy Jones also ordered the passenger, Knight, to get out of the vehicle.Â  Jones noticed a large bulge in Knightâ€™s left pants pocket, and he feared it was a weapon.Â  After frisking Knight, Jones determined the object felt metallic, and he retrieved brass knuckles from Knightâ€™s pocket.Â  Knight was arrested for possession of a concealed weapon.Â  Pursuant to a search incident to arrest, Jones discovered two grams of crank hidden inside a cigarette package in Knightâ€™s right pocket.Â  An arrest warrant was later issued, charging Knight with possession of crank.Â  The magistrate did not issue a warrant for possession of a concealed weapon because the statute provides an exception for brass knuckles where there is no evidence they were carried in furtherance of a crime.[1]Â  \r\nOn February 10, 2004, a hearing was held on Knightâ€™s motion to suppress the crank.Â  Deputy Jones testified regarding the events leading up to Knightâ€™s arrest, and he stated he did not know at the time of Knightâ€™s arrest that carrying brass knuckles without intent to commit a crime was excepted from the concealed weapon statute.Â  In response to questioning by the solicitor, Deputy Jones affirmed there was no evidence that Knight was using the brass knuckles in furtherance of a crime.Â  Knight then moved to suppress the crank evidence, arguing mere possession of brass knuckles, without an intent to commit a crime, was not a crime under the concealed weapon statute.Â  Therefore, he argued, there was no probable cause for the arrest.Â  Finding â€œunder the totality of the circumstances,â€ there was evidence that would cause a prudent person to believe that Knight had committed the offense of carrying a concealed weapon in furtherance of the crime of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, the trial court held the arrest was valid and denied the motion to suppress.Â  \r\nIn lieu of pleading guilty, Knight elected to have a bench trial because he wanted to preserve the suppression issue for appeal.Â  The parties agreed the State could summarize the testimony of Deputy Jones for the court instead of having Jones testify.Â  The State summarized Deputy Jonesâ€™s testimony for the court.Â  Although Knight stipulated the substance found was crank, he renewed his objection to the search that led to the discovery of the crank evidence.Â  Knight did not present any evidence after the court denied his motion for a directed verdict.Â  The trial court found Knight guilty as charged and sentenced him to two years imprisonment, suspended upon the service of two years probation.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  The trial courtâ€™s factual findings on whether evidence should be suppressed due to a Fourth Amendment violation are reviewed only for clear error.Â  State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d 661, 666 (2000).Â  â€œOn appeal from a suppression hearing, this court is bound by the circuit courtâ€™s factual findings if any evidence supports the findings.â€ State v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 349, 592 S.E.2d 344, 347 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied (Nov. 19, 2004).Â  Our review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is â€œlimited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding.â€Â  State v. Green, 341 S.C. 214, 219 n.3, 532 S.E.2d 896, 898 n.3 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nKnight stipulates the brass knuckles were validly seized pursuant to a Terry[2] search.Â  He argues, however, that there was no probable cause to arrest him for possession of a concealed weapon, and therefore, the search incident to the arrest was unlawful.Â  The State argues that probable cause existed to arrest Knight for possessing the brass knuckles in furtherance of a crime and that, even if the arrest were illegal, the crank was admissible pursuant to inevitable discovery.Â  Because Knight stipulates that Deputy Jones had probable cause to conduct a Terry frisk for weapons, the only question we must address is whether his arrest, and thus, the subsequent search incident to arrest, was valid.Â  \r\nProbable cause for a warrantless arrest exists when, considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding the information at the officerâ€™s disposal, there was sufficient information to cause a reasonable person to believe that criminal activity has been or is being committed.Â  State v. Goodwin, 351 S.C. 105, 110, 567 S.E.2d 912, 914 (Ct. App. 2002); see State v. Moultrie, 316 S.C. 547, 552, 451 S.E.2d 34, 37 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œ[P]robable cause for a warrantless arrest generally exists â€˜where the facts and circumstances within the arresting officerâ€™s knowledge are sufficient for a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been or is being committed by the person to be arrested.â€™â€(quoting United States v. Miller, 925 F.2d 695, 698 (4th Cir. 1991))).Â  â€œThe burden of establishing probable cause and the existence of circumstances constituting an exception to the general prohibition against warrantless searches is upon the prosecution.â€Â  State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 132, 620 S.E.2d 737, 740 (2005).\r\nThe concealed weapon statute provides that it is illegal for a person to carry a â€œdeadly weapon usually used for the infliction of personal injuryâ€ concealed on his person.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-460 (2003).Â  However, the section further provides that it does not apply to â€œrifles, shotguns, dirks, slingshots, metal knuckles, or razors unless they are used with the intent to commit a crime or in furtherance of a crime.â€Â  Id.Â  There are no South Carolina cases discussing this exception to the concealed weapon statute or what constitutes evidence that the weapon was used with â€œthe intent to commit a crime or in furtherance of a crime.â€Â  \r\nThe parties do not dispute that the mere possession of brass knuckles, without more, does not violate the concealed weapon statute.Â  Thus, we must focus our analysis on whether probable cause existed for a warrantless arrest of Knight pursuant to the portion of the statute criminalizing possession of concealed brass knuckles when used in furtherance of a crime.Â  \r\nReviewing the evidence and the totality of the circumstances surrounding the information at Deputy Jonesâ€™s disposal, we find there was not sufficient information to cause a reasonable person to believe that Knight was concealing brass knuckles in furtherance of a crime.Â  The only evidence presented at trial was the testimony of Deputy Jones, and he affirmatively testified there was no evidence the brass knuckles were being used in furtherance of a crime. Although the State argues the trial court properly considered the totality of the circumstances and found the nexus between weapons and drugs gave rise to probable cause to believe Knight possessed the brass knuckles in furtherance of drug transportation, there is no evidence to support that finding.[3]Â  Based on the only information presented at trial, the State failed to meet its burden of proving probable cause existed.Â  Thus, the arrest was illegal, and the crank discovered in the search incident to the illegal arrest should have been suppressed. \r\nHowever, the State further argues:Â  (1) even if the arrest were illegal, the crank was admissible due to inevitable discovery; and (2) the search was reasonable under the circumstances because there was a heightened sense of danger when Deputy Jones discovered the occupants of the vehicle had both weapons and crank.Â  We disagree.\r\nCiting State v. Smith, 329 S.C. 550, 495 S.E.2d 798 (Ct. App. 1998), the State asserts the discovery of the brass knuckles warranted a further weapons frisk â€œwhich would inevitably lead to discovery of the crank.â€Â  Under the inevitable discovery doctrine, evidence that may have been obtained in violation of a defendantâ€™s constitutional protections may, nevertheless, be admitted at trial if it would have been discovered inevitably by some other lawful means.Â  See Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 448 (1984) (â€œExclusion of physical evidence that would inevitably have been discovered adds nothing to either the integrity or fairness of a criminal trial.â€).Â  In Smith, this court noted that under the â€œplain feel doctrine,â€ the officer validly seized a baggy containing drugs he felt during a Terry pat-down for weapons because the officer could determine the object was contraband as soon as he felt the baggy, without additional manipulation, and the defendant admitted that the bag contained his â€œreefer.â€Â  Smith, 329 S.C. at 560-61, 495 S.E.2d at 803-04.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n Smith is inapplicable in the present case.Â  Although discovery of the brass knuckles may have led to a reasonable search to insure Knight had no further weapons, it would not have led to the â€œinevitable discoveryâ€ of the crank.Â  According to Deputy Jonesâ€™s testimony, the crank was discovered inside a cigarette box in Knightâ€™s pocket.Â  Deputy Jones could not have discovered via the â€œplain feel doctrineâ€ that the cigarette box concealed crank.Â  The search of the cigarette box exceeded the bounds of the Terry search.Â  See State v. Abrams, 322 S.C. 286, 289, 471 S.E.2d 716, 718 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting that the limited purpose of Terry was satisfied when the officer discovered there were no weapons on Abrams, and the further search of a Tylenol bottle concealing crack cocaine was impermissible and the drugs should have been suppressed).Â  Thus, we find no merit to the Stateâ€™s argument that the crank concealed in Knightâ€™s cigarette box would have inevitably been discovered during the weapons pat-down.\r\nDespite the Stateâ€™s argument that there is a nexus between drugs and weapons that would lead to probable cause, no evidence was presented in this case that would support probable cause to arrest Knight for possessing a concealed weapon in furtherance of a crime.Â  Because the testimony elicited by the State amounted to a denial of probable cause to arrest Knight, we find the Stateâ€™s argument unavailing.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThere was no evidence in the present case that Knight possessed the brass knuckles in furtherance of a crime.Â  Thus, Knight was unlawfully arrested and the search incident to arrest was invalid.Â  The trial court erred in failing to suppress the crank found as a result of the invalid search.Â  Accordingly, Knightâ€™s conviction and sentence are\r\n REVERSED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  It is illegal for a person to carry a concealed deadly weapon.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-460 (2003).Â  However, the section further provides that it does not apply to â€œ. . . metal knuckles . . . unless they are used with the intent to commit a crime or in furtherance of a crime.â€Â  Id.  \r\n[2]Â  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 27 (1968) (noting that an officer must have a reasonable suspicion that an individual is armed and dangerous before conducting a pat-down or frisk of the person).\r\n[3]Â  In support of this argument, the State relies on United States v. Pasquarille, 20 F.3d 682, 686-88 (6th Cir. 1994) (finding probable cause existed to search a van, based on the law enforcement officerâ€™s perspective, where the van and driver met an informantâ€™s description of someone selling cocaine); State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 390-93, 577 S.E.2d 498, 501-02 (Ct. App. 2003) (discussing whether an officer had a reasonable suspicion to conduct a pat- down or frisk of a suspect reasonably believed to be armed); and State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 248-50, 525 S.E.2d 535, 539-40 (Ct. App. 1999) (upholding a stop and frisk where the police officer had a reasonable suspicion that Blassingame fit the description of an armed suspect).Â  These cases are factually distinguishable from the present case because they address whether the initial stop or frisk was supported by probable cause based on the officerâ€™s reasonable belief that he was in danger, that the suspect had weapons, or that a crime was being committed.Â  These cases do not address whether a search incident to arrest was supported by probable cause where the officer mistakenly believed the suspectâ€™s actions were criminal or where there was no indication that the suspectâ€™s actions constituted a crime.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-110","title":"SCDSS v.

James Hoffmeyer, of Florence, for Appellant.Â  \r\nNewton I. Howle, Jr., of Darlington, for Respondent.\r\nRichard Edward Conner, Jr., of Hartsville, for Guardian Ad Litem.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Robin Smalls appeals a family court order terminating her parental rights as to her sons Dontravis (DOB:Â  8/20/92) and Deandre (DOB:Â  10/26/93).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe South Carolina Department of Social Services filed a complaint seeking to terminate Smallsâ€™ parental rights based on the following contentions:Â  1) the children were removed from and have lived outside of Smallsâ€™ home for a period of at least six months without Smalls remedying the conditions that caused the removal, 2) the children have been in foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months, 3) Smalls has willfully failed to support the children or make a material contribution to the childrenâ€™s care, and 4) termination is in the best interests of the children.Â  \r\nThe family court held a hearing on March 1, 2005.Â  DSS caseworker Mae Stradford testified the children have been in foster care since 1994.[2]Â  The parental rights of the father have previously been terminated.Â  Smalls was under a court order to pay child support of $21.34 per week.Â  At the time of the hearing, Smalls was $1,053.72 in arrears in support payments.Â  Smalls made her last payment in April 2004.Â  Smalls visited the children on July 28, 2004 and on January 22, 2005.Â  Stradford testified Smalls had not done anything to remedy the conditions causing removal, including failure to follow her treatment plan as to employment, housing, and counseling.Â  Smalls was last employed in the spring of 2004, has recently moved numerous times, and last saw her counselor in July 2004.Â  \r\nDontravis suffers from cerebral palsy and â€œattention deficit, hyperactive activity disorder,â€ and currently resides in a therapeutic foster home where he has lived since 1994, when he was seventeen months old.Â  The foster parents intend to adopt Dontravis.Â  Deandre suffers from attention deficit disorder and resides in a foster home where he has been since 1994, when he was three months old.Â  He likewise is in the process of being adopted.Â  \r\nStradford testified the children were in loving homes, had their own rooms, and were much closer to their foster parents than to their mother.Â  Both sets of foster parents provided nurturing homes and had stable employment.Â  The childrenâ€™s basic needs of food, medical care, and education were being met.Â  \r\nOn cross-examination, Stradford admitted she knew that in 2003 Smalls began caring for another son, Deshawn (approximately sixteen years old), and daughter, Matia (approximately ten years old), taking sole responsibility for Deshawnâ€™s medication.Â  Stradford also admitted she did not visit Smalls often.Â  She explained, however, that she had been to Smallsâ€™ home six or seven times over a twelve-month period and Smalls was not home or had moved without notification to DSS.Â  Stradford met with Smalls three times during that period.Â  \r\nAs to Smallsâ€™ failure to attend counseling, Stradford recognized that Smallsâ€™ counselor was in Florence and Smalls lived in Hartsville, creating a transportation problem.Â  Stradford explained that DSS provided transportation for counseling and on one occasion, Stradford sent a driver to Smallsâ€™ home to transport her to a scheduled counseling session and Smalls was not at her residence.Â  \r\nNancy Gregg and her two daughters, Chanell and Tamiko, testified on Smallsâ€™ behalf.Â  Chanell testified she has known Smalls for thirteen or fourteen years, Smalls baby-sits Chanellâ€™s daughter, and Smalls keeps a clean house.Â  Chanell testified Smalls spends a lot of time with Matia and Deshawn, helping with homework, ensuring Deshawn takes his medication, and picking the children up every day from the school bus.Â  Chanell pays Smalls $50 per week for babysitting services.Â  Tamiko testified in a like manner regarding Smallsâ€™ lifestyle.Â  Smalls baby-sits Tamikoâ€™s two children overnight while Tamiko works third shift.Â  Tamiko claimed she did not pay Smalls for babysitting services.Â  Nancy also testified Smalls was a good mother.Â  Nancy explained that Smalls has a two-bedroom apartment and a pullout couch.Â  Nancy admitted, â€œon any given day there would be four or five childrenâ€ in the apartment.Â  \r\nSmalls testified she missed appointments with the counselor when she moved.Â  She explained she earned a parenting certificate and tried to do everything required by the treatment plan.Â  As to child support, she testified she paid regularly until she lost her job in April 2004.Â  She lost her job due to her move to Hartsville and resulting lack of transportation.Â  Smalls still has a valid certified nursing assistant certificate and explained her job search since then:Â  â€œWhen I moved back to Hartsville, I was looking for a job in that same career, doing like nursing homes, but I called one but it was . . . too far to even . . . walk. . . .â€Â  She also applied to a few fast food restaurants.Â  Transportation allegedly remains the main impediment to Smallsâ€™ employment.Â  As to visitation, Smalls testified she would sometimes call DSS to set up a visit, but she did not have a telephone to receive return calls.Â  She recently purchased a cellular phone but has never called Dontravis or Deandre.Â  Smalls testified she no longer receives AFDC assistance, but does receive food stamps, a utility check, and free living accommodations.Â  \r\nThe family court terminated Smallsâ€™ parental rights to Dontravis and Deandre.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn a termination of parental rights\r\n(TPR) case, the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration.â€Â  Doe v. Baby Boy Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 579, 578 S.E.2d 733, 735 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Before a parentâ€™s rights may be terminated, the alleged grounds for termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Department of Soc. Servs. v. Mrs. H, 346 S.C. 329, 333, 550 S.E.2d 898, 901 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own determination of whether the grounds for termination are supported by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Id.Â  However, our broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court or ignore the fact that the family court was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe family court terminated Smallsâ€™ parental rights upon finding:Â  (1) the children lived outside the home for a period of at least six months and Smalls willfully failed to provide support, 2) the children lived in foster care for fifteen of the last twenty-two months, and (3) termination was in the best interests of the children.Â  Smalls appeals, raising three issues. \r\nSmalls first argues the family court erred in finding she willfully failed to pay child support.Â  Smalls contends her failure to pay child support was not willful but due to her loss of employment.Â  The family court may order termination of parental rights upon a finding of the following:\r\n\r\nThe child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to support the child.Â  Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material contribution to the childâ€™s care.Â  A material contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parentâ€™s means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child according to the parentâ€™s means.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) (Supp. 2005).Â  Whether a parentâ€™s failure to support a child is willful is a question of intent to be determined from all the facts and circumstances in each case.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 52, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992).Â  The trial judge is given wide discretion in making this determination.Â  Id.Â  However, the element of willfulness must be established by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Id.Â  â€œParental conduct â€˜which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties may fairly be characterized as â€˜willfulâ€™ because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.â€™â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Smith, 343 S.C. 129, 137, 538 S.E.2d 285, 289 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Broome, 307 S.C. at 53, 413 S.E.2d at 839).\r\nThe family court found Smalls voluntarily left her employment to move to Hartsville, and that she received some money from babysitting.Â  There is also evidence Smalls received financial support from family members and money from other sources, such as a â€œutility check.â€Â  However, Smalls made no child support payments after April 2004.Â  Furthermore, Smalls has made only sporadic attempts to secure employment to improve her ability to pay child support.Â  We find support to justify the courtâ€™s finding that Smallsâ€™ failure to pay child support constitutes willfulness sufficient to justify termination.Â  \r\nSmalls next argues the family court erred in terminating parental rights based on the children living outside the home for fifteen of the last twenty-two months because Smalls has not had the opportunity to live with the children since 1994 and it has been DSSâ€™s plan to terminate her parental rights since that time.Â  Our statutory scheme provides a ground for termination of parental rights where the child has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2005).Â  As the children have been in foster care since 1994, there is clear and convincing evidence to support the family courtâ€™s finding to that effect.Â  \r\nFinally, Smalls argues the family court erred in finding termination was in the best interest of the children.Â  We disagree.Â  Having found at least one ground on which the family court properly terminated Smallsâ€™ parental rights, we need only determine that termination of Smallsâ€™ rights is in the best interest of the children.Â  The interests of the child shall prevail if the childâ€™s interests and the parental rights conflict.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs.&nbsp;v. Parker, 336 S.C. 248, 259, 519 S.E.2d 351, 356 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Dontravis and Deandre have resided with their foster parents since infancy, for over twelve years.Â  Both foster families have expressed interest in adoption.Â  Although the children know their mother, their contact with her has been sporadic and infrequent.Â  The guardian agreed termination was in the best interest of the children.Â  We find clear and convincing evidence that termination is in the best interest of the children.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the family courtâ€™s termination of Smallsâ€™ parental rights as to Dontravis and Deandre is\r\n\r\n    AFFIRMED.\r\n    \r\n    GOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; For background facts of the removal of the children, refer to South Carolina Department of Social Services v.

Co. v. Collins, 309 S.C. 237, 240, 421 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1992).Â  In an action at law tried without a jury, the trial courtâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless those findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co. of California, 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nZeigler asserts the trial court applied an incorrect measure of damages.Â  He contends Perkinsâ€™ recovery is limited by her ownership interest in the property.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe property on which the Windjammer 3000 was located had been owned by Stephan Bash, who died intestate.Â  In 1986, his heirs executed a deed delineating the ownership interest of each heir.Â  Under this deed Perkins received 1.785% ownership in the property.Â  Perkins testified that she and her sister subsequently inherited their motherâ€™s 1.785% interest.[2]Â  \r\nThe Supreme Court of Mississippi recognized that within insurance law, there are two lines of cases regarding whether a co-tenant may insure the entire property and receive all insurance proceeds.Â  Sullivan v. Estate of Eason, 558 So.2d 830, 833 (Miss. 1990).Â  It noted:Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œThe general rule, sustained by the great weight of authority, is, in the absence of anything in the instrument creating the estate, or of agreement to that effect, between the parties, no duty rests upon the one or the other to insure for the benefit of the remainderman or his cotenant, and insurance taken by one with an insurable interest in the property, who pays the premiums thereon out of his own funds, is a personal indemnity to the insured. . . .\r\n\r\nId. at 833 (quoting Bell v. Barefield, 122 So. 318, 319 (Ala. 1929) (alteration in original).Â  The other line of cases holds that one securing insurance for the benefit of the other insurable interests in property holds the proceeds in trust for those interests.Â  Id.\r\nAlthough the second line of cases requires cotenants to share in insurance proceeds, these cases do not afford Zeigler a defense to payment of the full amount of damages.Â  At the most, Perkins would be considered to be holding the proceeds in trust for her cotenants.[3]Â  \r\nIn South Carolina Insurance Company v. Price, 315 S.C. 212, 432 S.E.2d 508 (Ct. App. 1993), the named insured obtained insurance on property owned by BroSis, a partnership consisting of the named insured and his siblings.Â  After the building burned down, the insurance company brought an action claiming that it was liable only for the named insuredâ€™s share of the value of the building.Â  This court relied on the Valued Policy Statute, which holds, â€œThe amount of insurance must be fixed by the insurer and insured at or before the time of issuing the policy.Â  In case of total loss by fire the insured is entitled to recover the full amount of insurance.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-75-20 (2002).Â  Thus, this court held that the insurer was obligated to pay the full value of the building rather than the named insuredâ€™s fractional share.Â  Id.Â  at 213, 432 S.E.2d at 508-09.\r\nUnder the lease, Zeigler was required to insure the premises, which he failed to do.Â  Thus, as a remedy for breach of this provision of the lease, Perkins is entitled to the amount she would have received from the insurance.Â  See South Carolina Fed. Sav. Bank v. Thornton-Crosby Dev. Co., 303 S.C. 74, 77, 399 S.E.2d 8, 10 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œIn a breach of contract action, damages serve to place the nonbreaching party in the position he would have enjoyed had the contract been performed.â€).Â  We find no error in the masterâ€™s determination that Perkinsâ€™ recovery from Zeigler should not be limited in proportion to her fractional ownership interest in the property.Â  Accordingly, the order of the master awarding Perkins $150,000[4] in damages is \r\n AFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In his order, the master noted that Anatha Bash, one of the heirs of Stephen Bash, testified that the family had given the land and building to Perkinsâ€™ mother to be used without any compensation being given to any other heirs.Â  Perkins, thus, had total use of the building in question with approval of the heirs of Stephen Bash.Â  Zeigler presented no evidence challenging this testimony.\r\n[3] As this is not a dispute between the cotenants over the proceeds of the policy, we take no position as to which line of cases this court would follow in such a dispute and whether Perkins would have to share the proceeds. \r\n[4]Â  In her Respondentâ€™s brief, Perkins appears to request this court increase the amount of the damages the master awarded her.Â  As Perkins failed to appeal this award, we decline to address this request.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-112","title":"State v.

Mersereau, of Charleston, for Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: David Brunson appeals several aspects of a family court order that arise from a change of custody dispute with Chantalle Brunson.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nDavid Brunson (Father) and Chantalle Brunson[1] (Mother) married in 1994.Â  They have one child, Kristen (Child), born on January 17, 1995.Â  In 1999, the parties divorced based on one yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  The divorce order approved the partiesâ€™ custody agreement, which awarded joint custody of Child with Motherâ€™s residence being the primary residence.Â  It also required the Brunsons to attend joint counseling sessions.Â  Further, the agreement required Mother to notify Father of her intention to move within sixty days of the move. Â Less than two months after the divorce, Mother and Child relocated without disclosing their whereabouts. \r\nBased on Motherâ€™s disappearance, Father filed a complaint on May 6, 1999, seeking modification of custody, visitation, and child support.Â  Father alleged he was deprived of visitation and that Mother violated the terms of the court order by not providing notice of her intention to move.Â  Father indicated that he did not know Motherâ€™s exact whereabouts and was unable to personally serve the pleadings.Â  Because Father asserted he had no information about Motherâ€™s whereabouts other than in the Charleston, South Carolina, area, he was granted permission to serve Mother via publication in the local Post and Courier newspaper.Â  \r\nDuring the initial merits hearing on November 4, 1999, which was not attended by Mother, Judge Jefferson found Mother in violation of the prior order and awarded physical custody to Father.Â  She also included an unusual provision in the order that allowed Mother to challenge the order within five days of personal service.Â  Mother challenged the order in a timely fashion by filing a motion to vacate.Â  The court held a lengthy hearing that extended over several days and resulted in Mother retaining physical custody.Â  \r\nThe family court judge heard testimony from Dr. Diane Hamrick, a psychologist.Â  The prior court order required the Brunsons to attend joint counseling sessions with the caveat that â€œunder no circumstances are any of the discussions in these therapy sessions to be admitted into evidence in the Family Court of South Carolina . . . .â€Â  During one of the counseling sessions, Father made a comment that Dr. Hamrick interpreted as a threat on Motherâ€™s life.Â  As a result, Dr. Hamrick withdrew from counseling the Brunsons and reported the threat to the guardian ad litem.Â  Fatherâ€™s exact words and his intent remain in dispute.Â  Father contends his intention was to arrange a date when he said he wished that he had let a friend â€œtake her out when he wanted to.â€Â  Dr. Hamrick, however, recalls Father saying he knew someone who would â€œget rid of her for him.â€Â  \r\nBased on representations in the motion, affidavits, and testimony that Father could not determine Motherâ€™s whereabouts when he requested to serve process by publication, the Judge found that Father and his attorney â€œdeliberately failed to disclose . . . information to the court.â€Â  The court cited an affidavit signed by Father, in which he stated a Charleston area P.O. Box address was â€œthe only address [he had] for her [at the time].â€Â  During the motion to vacate hearing, he further described the â€œextensive measuresâ€ taken to locate Mother and Child.Â  The family court judge determined that at the time the affidavit was signed and the hearings were conducted, Father was aware of a specific address in Colorado that Mother recently used.Â  Father contends this address was an old address and was not valid when he signed the affidavit and gave his testimony.Â  \r\nMother contends she left the Charleston area because of Fatherâ€™s threats and intimidation.Â  Judge Jefferson continued custody with Mother and awarded her $5,000.00 in attorney fees.Â  Further, the judge found Father violated the divorce decree by failing to comply with a mutual restraining order.\r\nDuring the motion to vacate hearing, Fatherâ€™s attorney moved for the judge to recuse herself on the grounds that she was biased against him and that she made up her mind on the merits of the case before the conclusion of the testimony.Â  The judge denied the motion.Â  \r\nAfter concluding all proceedings related to the motion to vacate, the judge recused herself on October 6, 2000.Â  The judge then sent a copy of her order on the motion to vacate to the grievance committee as her complaint against Fatherâ€™s counsel.Â  \r\nJudge Wylie presided over the subsequent trial on the merits and ultimately awarded Mother sole custody of Child, denied the partiesâ€™ requests for attorneysâ€™ fees, and declined to hold Father in contempt. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  This does not require the appellate court, however, to disregard the findings of the family court, which saw and heard the witnesses.Â  McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 591, 506 S.E.2d 1, 5 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nâ€œIn order for a court to grant a change of custody based on changed circumstances, the party seeking the change must meet the burden of showing changed circumstances occurring subsequent to the entry of the order in question.â€Â  Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 330, 536 S.E.2d 427, 430 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€˜â€œ(T)he change of circumstance relied on for a change of custody must be such as would substantially affect the interest and the welfare of the child, not merely the parties, their wishes or convenienceâ€â€™ Id. (quoting Sharpe v. Sharpe, 256 S.C. 517, 521, 183 S.E.2d 325, 327 (1971)).Â  This change of circumstances must amount to a material change of conditions.Â  Bolding v. Bolding, 278 S.C. 129, 130, 293 S.E.2d 699, 700 (1982) (emphasis added).\r\nCustody decisions are matters left largely to the discretion of the trial court.Â  Stroman v. Williams, 291 S.C. 376, 378, 353 S.E.2d 704, 705 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs either when the court is controlled by some error of law or where the order, based upon findings of fact, lacks evidentiary support.Â  McKnight v. McKnight, 283 S.C. 540, 543, 324 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jurisdiction \r\nFather contends the family court judge did not have jurisdiction to allow Mother to challenge the initial order by petitioning the family court for review within five days of personal service.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA portion of a judgment that is not appealed presents no issue for determination by the reviewing court and constitutes, rightly or wrongly, the law of the case.â€Â  Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., 358 S.C. 298, 320, 594 S.E.2d 867, 878 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  It is a fundamental rule of law that an appellate court will affirm a trial courtâ€™s ruling if the offended party does not challenge that ruling.Â  Biales v. Young, 315 S.C. 166, 168, 432 S.E.2d 482, 484 (1993).Â  Failure to challenge the ruling â€œis an abandonment of the issue and precludes consideration on appeal.â€Â  Id. at 168, 432 S.E.2d at 484.Â  \r\nThe judgeâ€™s order dated December 21, 1999, allowed Mother to challenge her ruling.Â  Specifically, the judge stated she â€œheard only one part of the story regarding issues raised by the pleadingsâ€ and, as a result, provided Mother with an opportunity to challenge the order and â€œreview its decision.â€Â  Father did not appeal this order.Â  Since Father did not challenge any part of this order, it is the law of the case and may not be altered on appeal.\r\nII.Â  The Order of Publication\r\nFather argues the judge erred by finding the order of publication defective.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe judge found the original order of publication defective because of misrepresentations Father made to the court.Â  An order of publication is properly issued when it is supported by an affidavit alleging that the affiant has exercised due diligence and was unable to find the person to be served.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-710 (2005).Â  â€œThe [statute] does not specify the character of the facts and circumstances which must be stated in the affidavit or the quantity of evidence necessary to satisfy the officer before ordering publication.Â  It simply requires that it must appear to [the issuing officerâ€™s] satisfaction . . . [and] when he is satisfied, in the absence of fraud or collusion, it is final.â€Â  Yarbrough v. Collins, 293 S.C. 290, 292-93, 360 S.E.2d 300, 301 (1987).Â  \r\nIn this case, the judge found that Father and his attorney possessed information regarding Motherâ€™s whereabouts, namely a letter from a private investigator, which supplied recently used addresses in Colorado.Â  Concluding that the decision to allow notice by publication was based on deception, the family court determined the order was defective.Â  Because there is evidence in the record to support the judgeâ€™s conclusion, it will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Recusal\r\nFather contends the judge erred by not recusing herself.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA judge should disqualify [herself] in a proceeding in which [her] impartiality might reasonably be questioned,â€ including, but not limited to, instances where she has a personal bias or prejudice against a party.Â  Murphy v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 331, 461 S.E.2d 39, 42 (1995).Â  â€œIt is not enough for a party to allege bias; a party seeking disqualification of a judge must show some evidence of bias or prejudice.â€Â  Christensen v. Mikell, 324 S.C. 70, 74, 476 S.E.2d 692, 694 (1996).Â  However, such â€œbias must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in [decisions] based on information other than what the judge learned from [her] participation in the case.â€Â  Roper v. Dynamique Concepts, Inc., 316 S.C. 131, 139, 447 S.E.2d 218, 223 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  â€œ[R]eversal is mandated only where there is evidence of judicial prejudice.â€Â  Felder v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 327 S.C. 21, 26, 489 S.E.2d 191, 194 (1997).Â  Evidence of judicial prejudice may be established by showing that the record does not support the courtâ€™s findings.Â  Ellis v. Procter &amp; Gamble Distrib. Co., 315 S.C. 283, 285, 433 S.E.2d 856, 857 (1993).\r\nFather failed to provide evidence of extra-judicial bias or prejudice.Â  Furthermore, a review of the record shows the courtâ€™s interaction with Fatherâ€™s counsel did not rise to the level of demonstrating bias.Â  The record also supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the judgeâ€™s decision to deny the request for recusal.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Hamrickâ€™s Testimony \r\nFather argues the family court judge erred by admitting Dr. Hamrickâ€™s testimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe public policy protecting confidential communications must be balanced against the public interest in the proper administration of justice.â€Â  Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 89, 615 S.E2d 465, 483 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  To warrant a reversal based on the admission of evidence, the appellant must show both error and resulting prejudice.Â  Commerce Ctr. Of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen Assocs. Inc., 347 S.C. 545, 556 S.E.2d 718 (Ct. App. 2001). Â \r\nThe prior court order providing for counseling sessions clearly stated that â€œunder no circumstances are any of the discussions in [the] therapy sessions to be admitted into evidence in the Family Court of South Carolina . . . .â€Â  The parties agreed to the counseling as part of the resolution of the custody issue.Â  It is unreasonable, and we believe against public policy, to allow these sessions to provide an open forum for one parent to make threats or to otherwise intimidate the other parent.\r\nWe find the confidentiality provision in question here was intended to facilitate candid discourse between Father and Mother with the ultimate goal of protecting Childâ€™s best interests.Â  Neither the judge, nor the parties could have contemplated these counseling sessions would protect illegal activity or statements such as making a threat on anotherâ€™s life.Â  Public policy mandates that we take such an approach.Â  Furthermore, Father has not shown prejudice resulted from admitting Dr. Hamrickâ€™s statement.Â  Even if Fatherâ€™s statement was not proven to be a threat, the record shows other instances of Fatherâ€™s abusive, threatening and harassing behavior. \r\nV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneysâ€™ Fees \r\nFather argues the judge erred in awarding Mother attorneysâ€™ fees resulting from the motion to vacate.Â  We agree.\r\nÂ There is no indication in the order the family court took into account the factors of either E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812 (1992), or Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991).Â  This court finds both partiesâ€™ contributed to the events leading up to the motion to vacate the December 19, 1999 order.Â  Fatherâ€™s conduct and deception and the manner in which Mother left South Carolina contributed to the necessity for court intervention.Â  Therefore, both parties are responsible for paying their own fees.\r\nVI.Â  Divorce Decree\r\nFather argues the judge erred in finding Father violated the divorce decree. Â We disagree.\r\nThe family court found Father violated the divorce decree, which contained a mutual restraining order prohibiting the parties from harassing each other.Â  This finding was specifically based on Father threatening Motherâ€™s life and confronting her at her place of residence.Â  The family courtÂ  did not order any specific sanction as a result of this finding.Â  \r\nâ€œThe trial judge was in a superior position to judge the witnessâ€™ demeanor and veracity, and therefore, [her] findings should be given broad discretion.â€Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  Upon review of the record, there is evidence to justify the courtâ€™s finding that Father violated the divorce decree by threatening Motherâ€™s life and harassing Mother at her place of residence.Â  \r\nVII.Â  Vacating the Default Order\r\nFather argues the family court erred by vacating her earlier order giving custody to Father.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe family court vacated the earlier order based upon reasons discussed in Sections I and II.Â  Based on our earlier findings, we affirm the family court.\r\nVIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gross Misrepresentations \r\nFather argues the family court erred by finding Father and his counsel made gross misrepresentations to the court.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe court based this particular finding on, among other things, evidence that Father and his counsel had possession of a letter from Dr. Hamrick regarding the threat before the initiation of this case and failed to disclose the letter or the information contained in it.Â  \r\nThe judge, â€œwho saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.â€Â  McElveen 332 S.C. at 591, 506 S.E.2d at 5.Â  Here, Father has failed to meet his burden to convince this court that the family court judge erred in her factual findings.Â  See generally, DuBose v. DuBose, 259 S.C. 418, 192 S.E.2d 329 (1972).Â  The order contains findings of fact regarding various misrepresentations and incomplete disclosures, which prompted the court to make its ruling.Â  Because there is evidence in the record to support her findings, the judgeâ€™s decision will not be disturbed.Â  \r\nIX.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Custody \r\nFollowing the trial on the merits, Judge Wylie concluded Childâ€™s best interests would be served by Mother receiving sole custody and Father having visitation privileges.Â  Father argues that because Mother did not present any pleadings seeking sole custody, the court erred in granting such relief.Â  We disagree.\r\nEither party seeking a change in custody must show facts substantially affecting the childâ€™s best interests and well being.Â  See Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 330, 536 S.E.2d 427, 430 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The family court considered how its custody decision would impact all areas of Childâ€™s life, including physical, psychological, spiritual, educational, familial, emotional, and recreational aspects.Â  See Hollar v. Hollar, 342 S.C. 463, 472, 536 S.E.2d 883, 888 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nâ€œWhen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings . . . [and] failure [to so] amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues.â€Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP.Â  â€œAn appellant has a duty to provide this Court with a record sufficient for review of the issues on appeal.â€Â  State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 17, 518 S.E.2d 278, 283 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The record Father provided does not include any of Motherâ€™s testimony.Â  Therefore, we are left to look at the judgeâ€™s order to determine whether Mother asked for sole custody.Â  Because the order clearly shows Mother did testify (â€œ[m]otherâ€™s testimony made it clear to the Court that she would like . . . her common law husband [to be Childâ€™s] father.â€), we are left to infer that she did seek custody.Â  Therefore, we hold the issue of custody was tried by the consent of both parties and does not need to be formally pled to be considered by this court.\r\nMother represents herself in this appeal and did not supply this court with a brief or contribute to the record on appeal.Â  Although we do not expressly know what Mother pled at trial, we do know that custody was the crux of the case and the focus of the December 3, 2003 order.Â  The trial judge considered all of the appropriate factors used to determine whether circumstances changed sufficiently to alter custody.Â  The family court ultimately decided that Father did not prove a sufficient change of circumstances and Mother did prove a substantial change of circumstances.Â  The family court found that the social, educational, spiritual, medical, familial, and recreational aspects of Childâ€™s life continue to develop successfully in Motherâ€™s care.Â  Additionally, Mother has remarried and is able to devote herself full time to caring for Child.Â  Child is enrolled in private school and active in Girl Scouts, tee ball, music, and dance.Â  Mother proved that the move to Colorado has been beneficial for the child.Â  \r\nFather concedes the child is doing well academically and socially, but argues the Mother moved to Colorado to alienate him from the child.Â  The family court found that Mother left after difficulties exchanging Child for visitation with Father.Â  Fatherâ€™s conduct included bullying and spiteful conduct in an effort to intimidate Mother.\r\nÂ While this court does not condone Motherâ€™s failure to comply with the notice provisions of the initial order, it does appear that the Child is thriving due to Motherâ€™s efforts.Â  This fact along with Fatherâ€™s conduct are significant changes warranting the family courtâ€™s determination it was in Childâ€™s best interest to award Mother sole custody of Child with visitation to Father.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s decision is\r\n AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part.[2]\r\nSTILWELL, KITTREDGE, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Mother currently goes by the name Chantalle Irland.Â  She is representing herself pro se and did not file a brief for this appeal.\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-116","title":"Hart v.

Hart, the husband, appeals a family court order issued pursuant to a rule to show cause brought by Cynthia Hart, the wife.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn October 5, 2004, the parties appeared before the family court to request approval of an agreement they had reached concerning the division of their property and other matters incident to their divorce.[2]Â  The agreement required, among other things, that the husband deliver to the wife various items of personal property and compensate her for her equitable interest in his business by paying monthly installments secured by a note and non-interest-bearing second mortgage on his primary residence.Â  The wife was to assume responsibility for the costs associated with the preparation and filing of the mortgage and all costs associated with extinguishing the mortgage when the husband satisfied the debt.Â  The family court approved the agreement and filed an order to that effect on October 7, 2004.Â  \r\nThe following month, the family court issued a rule to show cause against the husband based on a complaint filed by the wife alleging in pertinent part that the husband failed to return certain items, the husband returned other items in damaged condition, and the husband failed to execute the note and mortgage prepared by her attorney.Â  \r\nA hearing on the rule to show cause took place March 10, 2005.Â  Both parties testified.Â  In addition, the husband called attorney Dean Porter as an expert witness regarding problems with the mortgage as drafted by the wifeâ€™s attorney.Â  \r\nSeveral weeks later, the family court issued an order on the rule to show cause.Â  In the order, the family court (1) found the husband had violated the agreement by failing to deliver various personal effects to the wife, but held a finding of contempt in abeyance pending his return of a mattress set and a Bombay entertainment center; (2) ordered the husband to pay the wife $200 â€œfor the value of damaged propertyâ€; (3) ordered the husband to execute the note and mortgage; and (4) ordered the husband to pay $500 toward attorney fees and costs incurred by the wife in pursuing the contempt action.Â  The husband appeals this order.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  At the outset, we note the wife has not filed a brief in this appeal.Â  Although we recognize this failure is not necessarily a stipulation of error in the appealed order,[3] we nevertheless â€œmay take such action as [we] deem proper,â€[4] including reversing the judgment below.[5]Â  We find it appropriate to avail ourselves somewhat of this prerogative given the substantial issues of fact raised in this appeal and the authority of this court to take its own view of the evidence in an equity matter.[6]  \r\n2.Â  The husband takes issue with the family courtâ€™s finding that, contrary to the partiesâ€™ agreement, he failed to return the wifeâ€™s dive equipment.Â  We agree with the husband that the preponderance of the evidence does not support this finding.Â  \r\nâ€œExhibit A,â€ which is referenced in the order approving the partiesâ€™ agreement, listed â€œdive equipmentâ€ as one of the personal effects that the husband was to deliver to the wife.Â  The agreement, however, did not enumerate the specific items of diving gear that the wife was to receive.Â  The family court determined the husband returned only the wifeâ€™s diving fins and still needed to return her wet suit, dive mask and snorkel.Â  Although it appears from the record that the wife offered some testimony suggesting she had owned a ladies wet suit, dive mask, and snorkel, another exhibit referenced in the order lists the dive equipment as an item bought by the husband as a gift to the wife during the marriage and values it at $200.Â  When the husband presented his case, he testified that he purchased the wife only a set of fins for about $180.Â  He acknowledged he and the wife had gone diving on their honeymoon in Greece, but explained they used rented equipment and had not dived since that time.Â  The record does not reflect that the wife presented any reply evidence refuting the husbandâ€™s assertions.Â  \r\n3.Â  We disagree with the husband that the family court â€œerred in finding that he failed to return the â€˜leather top end table.â€™â€Â  The family court made no such finding; therefore, no error occurred.Â  \r\nAt the hearing, the wife acknowledged the husband had provided her a leather top end table, but stated it was not the leather top end table she was expecting to receive.Â  The husband, however, testified that the leather top end table he returned to the wife was the only such table of which he was aware and that neither party owned a table fitting the description of the item that the wife claimed belonged to her.\r\nAccording to the appealed order, the family court recounted the wifeâ€™s testimony and noted the item in dispute appeared on one of the exhibits referenced in the order approving the agreement.Â  There is no finding in the appealed order, however, that the husband â€œfailedâ€ to return the correct table.Â  \r\nFurthermore, the family court neither imposed a finding of contempt against the husband for his alleged failure to give the wife the desired table nor made avoidance of such a finding conditional on the return of the item.\r\n4.Â  We agree with the husband that the family court erred in ordering him to pay $200 to the wife for â€œdamaged property.â€Â  In her complaint on the rule to show cause, the wife alleged the husband damaged eleven items that he was supposed to return to her:Â  a red velvet chair, a green animal print chair, the glass door of an entertainment center, a coffee table, a dryer, three end tables, a green room rug, her bicycle tires, and the frame and glass from a print.Â  Contrary to the wifeâ€™s allegations, however, the family court specifically found the husband had not damaged the coffee table, rug, or picture frame and made no finding that he had damaged any of the remaining items.Â  Because there are no findings that the husband was responsible for any of the alleged damage, it follows that he should not have to pay anything to the wife.\r\n5.Â  We disagree with the husband that the family court erred in finding that the Bombay entertainment center was part of the â€œBombay setâ€ he had agreed to return to the wife.Â  According to literature from the Bombay Company that the wife submitted into evidence, the four pieces that the wife acknowledged the husband returned to her were from the â€œHaberdasherâ€ collection and the entertainment center was called a â€œHaberdashers Entertainment Cabinet.â€Â  The husband testified only that he thought the entertainment center was separate from the other pieces of furniture, but gave no specific facts as to why he believed this.Â  According to our view of the preponderance of evidence, then, it was reasonable for the family court to find the entertainment center was part of the set of furniture that the husband was to return to the wife.\r\n6.Â  Regarding the note and mortgage, the husband argues â€œto the extent the courtâ€™s finding indicates the ex-husband is somehow responsible for the problems with the note and mortgage, there is simply no factual basis to sustain that finding.â€Â  We do not interpret the appealed order as finding the husband to be at fault regarding the problems with the preparation of the note and mortgage; therefore, we do not address this issue.\r\n7.Â  The husband claims the family court erred in failing to grant his claim for payment of attorney Porterâ€™s fees.Â  Because, however, the appealed order does not rule on this request and the husband did not raise this issue in a Rule 59(e) motion, he failed to preserve this issue for appellate review.[7]\r\n8. Â Finally, the husband argues the family court erred in awarding attorney fees to the wife and in denying attorney fees to him.Â  In view of the beneficial results obtained by the husband in this appeal, we remand this issue to the family court for further consideration.[8]\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  The partiesâ€™ divorce decree had already been filed.\r\n[3]Â  State v.

Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 546-47, 615 S.E.2d 98, 105-06&nbsp;(2005).Â  When a debt is incurred after the initiation of marital litigation, it may be considered marital in nature and apportioned accordingly if it was incurred for marital purposes.Â  Id.Â  Thus, whether jurisdiction exists depends on the factual determination of the credit line as marital or nonmarital.Â  Bowen v. Bowen, 345 S.C. 243, 247, 547 S.E.2d 877, 879 (Ct. App. 2001) (stating family court has jurisdiction to determine if property is nonmarital; once it determines it nonmarital, there is no continuing jurisdiction over said property).\r\nWife alleged she used the proceeds of the equity line of credit to reduce marital credit card debt when she refinanced the marital residence during the pendency of the action.Â  She asserts the net effect of refinancing was that marital debt and assets remained the same.Â  Both parties submitted all pertinent materials to the arbitrator including information about the refinance.Â  The arbitrator circulated a proposed order.Â  Husband challenged that portion of the arbitratorâ€™s order.Â  The arbitrator acknowledged Husbandâ€™s arguments and concluded the credit line was a marital debt.Â  We find no error.\r\nIn the alternative, Husband argues the family court erred in refusing to set aside the arbitration award due to the arbitratorâ€™s treatment of the equity line of credit.[2]Â  We disagree. \r\nArbitration agreements in South Carolina are governed by the Uniform Arbitration Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-10 through -240 (2005).Â  The Arbitration Act provides that a â€œwritten agreement to submit any existing controversy to arbitration . . . is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-10(a) (2005).Â \r\nThis court has found the Arbitration Act applies to agreements to arbitrate equitable apportionment claims.Â  Swentor v. Swentor, 336 S.C. 472, 477-78, 520 S.E.2d 330, 333&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nIn this case, as in Swentor, the parties agreed to submit equitable distribution issues to arbitration.Â  The family courtâ€™s ordinary power to approve settlement agreements after a review for fairness does not exist where the parties agree to binding arbitration.Â  Id. at 482, 520 S.E.2d at 336.Â  â€œTo allow a family court judge to set aside an arbitration award because the judge found the award to be unfair would severely undermine the finality of arbitration agreements.â€Â  Id. at 483, 520 S.E.2d at 336.\r\nThe family court may vacate an arbitration award only upon one of the statutory grounds set forth\r\nin South Carolina Code section 15-48-130,[3] or for â€œmanifest disregard or perverse misconstruction of the law.â€Â  Lauro v. Visnapuu, 351 S.C. 507, 516, 570 S.E.2d 551, 556 (Ct.

Ervin, both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Appellants Jeff and Shonya Young sued respondent Tracy Greene and his brother Ted, alleging Tracy collided with their vehicle on July 15, 2000, when Tracy, while driving his brotherâ€™s truck, turned left in front of them.Â  The Youngs seek to recover damages for severe personal injuries they allegedly received from the automobile accident.Â  The jury returned a verdict for the Greenes.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s instructing the jury it could find for the Greenes.Â  The Youngs contend the Greenesâ€™ counsel admitted liability, leaving only the question of the amount of damages for the jury to determine.Â  In this case, however, the record shows the Greenes only admitted simple negligence.[2]Â  \r\nâ€œLiability encompasses all elements of a negligence claim, including damages proximately caused by the alleged negligence.â€ Â Hinds v. Elms, 358 S.C. 581, 585, 595 S.E.2d 855, 857&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004). Â â€œA determination of negligence, standing alone, is a far cry from a determination of liability.â€Â  Id.Â  The plaintiff must also prove proximate cause in a negligence action.Â  Hurd v. Williamsburg County, 363 S.C. 421, 611 S.E.2d 488&nbsp;(2005).Â  The issue of proximate cause is generally a question for the jury and, if more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the trial judge must submit the issue to the jury.Â  Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40&nbsp;(1984).Â  \r\nBecause the Greenes admitted only simple negligence, the Youngs were still required to prove that negligence proximately caused their injuries and they were required to prove the amount of damages they suffered as a result.Â  \r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  We find no error in the trial judgeâ€™s denial of the Youngsâ€™ motion for a new trial where the jury could reasonably conclude the Greenesâ€™ negligence was not a proximate cause of the alleged damages.Â  \r\nThe trial judge may grant a new trial absolute when, sitting as the thirteenth juror, she concludes the juryâ€™s verdict is not supported by the evidence.Â  Duncan v. Hampton County Sch. Dist. No. 2,&nbsp; 335 S.C. 535, 517 S.E.2d 449&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999).Â  Although the Greenes neither testified nor presented any witnesses, the trial judge found many contested issues in the trial that could justify a verdict for the Greenes.Â  Evidence is not rendered undisputed simply because there is no direct evidence contradicting it.Â  There still remains a question of its inherent probability, the credibility of the witnesses, and the inferences to be drawn from the evidence.Â  Vereen v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 306 S.C. 423, 412 S.E.2d 425&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1991).Â  \r\nDr. William Endicott, the Youngsâ€™ dentist, testified he briefly examined the Youngs on the 17th or 18th of July 2000.Â  Although he usually treats emergency cases right away, Endicott first treated the Youngs on September 13, 2000, approximately two months after the accident.Â  Dr. Jeff Benjamin, the Youngsâ€™ neurologist, testified he started treating Shonya Young on October 27, 2000, and Jeffrey Young on November 22, 2000, approximately three to four months after the accident.Â  Dr. Benjamin testified Jeffrey complained to him of pain in his lower back and neck.Â  \r\nOn July 23, 2000, Jeffrey suffered injuries in a fight and received medical attention in a hospital emergency room.Â  The hospital report reveals someone struck Jeffrey in the head with a stick, causing him to lose consciousness.Â  The report also reveals he denied any neck or back pain at the time, even though the automobile accident occurred a week prior.Â  Â Â \r\nAlthough both doctors opined the July 15, 2000 automobile accident caused the Youngsâ€™ injuries, the doctors also admitted they based their determinations about the relationship between the injuries and the accident largely upon information supplied by the Youngs.Â  The July 23, 2000 incident appears in the medical records; however, the record on appeal does not indicate the Youngs discussed the incident with either doctor and neither of the Youngs testified at trial.Â  \r\nOfficer Michael Marsh, who responded to the scene of the accident, testified he generally remembered when people were seriously injured.Â  Moreover, his report indicates the Youngs did not go to the hospital immediately after the accident.Â  \r\nThe testimony at trial created an issue of fact regarding the truthfulness of the Youngsâ€™ alleged injuries.Â  The facts above could reasonably lead the jury to conclude the Youngs suffered no injuries as a result of the July 15, 2000 accident.Â  See Ross v. Paddy, 340 S.C. 428, 532 S.E.2d 612&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000) (noting even where the evidence is uncontradicted, the jury may believe all, some, or none of the testimony, and where the credibility of a witness has been questioned, the matter is properly left to the jury to decide); Burns v.

Rowland, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The family court granted Marlene Yochem (Wife) a divorce from Robert Yochem (Husband) on the ground of adultery, divided the partiesâ€™ assets, and awarded Wife attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Husband appeals, arguing the family court erred in (1) apportioning the marital estate and ordering that Wife receive $48,529.29 from the sale of the marital home to repay her original investment of nonmarital funds, (2) awarding Wife permanent periodic alimony of $1,000.00 per month, and (3) ordering Husband to pay $12,500.00 towards Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  We affirm.[1]  \r\nI.Â  Apportionment of Assets (Marital Home)\r\nHusband first contends the family court erred in failing to consider all of the factors enumerated in section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code in apportioning the partiesâ€™ estate.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2005).Â  Specifically, Husband argues the court placed undue emphasis on Wifeâ€™s contribution of $48,529.29 of nonmarital property toward the acquisition of the partiesâ€™ first home (the Crooked Pond home) and, after its sale, incorrectly assumed the money was placed into the partiesâ€™ second home (the Chinaberry home).Â  Husband asserts the court â€œignored the $47,000 nonmarital contribution from Husbandâ€™s retirement, as well as all the personal labor [H]usband expended on both the Crooked Pond and Chinaberry houses.â€Â  Husband finally contends any nonmarital funds Wife contributed were transmuted.Â  As a result, Husband maintains he should be awarded one half of the net proceeds from the sale of the Chinaberry home.\r\nOn appeal from an order of the family court, an appellate court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Hopkins v. Hopkins,&nbsp;343 S.C. 301, 304, 540 S.E.2d 454, 456&nbsp;(2000).Â  Where, however, the evidence is disputed, an appellate court may adhere to the findings of the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157&nbsp;(1996).\r\nPursuant to section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code, in making an equitable division of marital assets and debts, the family court must give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriate to the list of enumerated factors, including the duration of the marriage and the ages of the parties, marital misconduct or fault, the value of the marital property and each spouseâ€™s contribution, the income and earning potential of each spouse, the health of each spouse, and such other factors that the court deems relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nThe family court does not have jurisdiction to apportion nonmarital property.Â  Id. Â§ 20-7-473.Â  Nonmarital property includes property acquired by either party before the marriage.Â  Id.Â  Nonmarital property may be transmuted into marital property if (1) it becomes so commingled with marital property that it is untraceable, (2) it is jointly titled, or (3) it is utilized in support of the marriage so as to evidence an intent by the parties to make it marital property.Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 569 S.E.2d 393 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Transmutation is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts in the case, and the party claiming transmutation of nonmarital property must produce enough objective evidence that, during the marriage, the parties regarded the disputed property as marital.Â  Hatfield v. Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 489 S.E.2d 212 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\nIn this case, the family court determined an equal division of all marital assets was appropriate, except for the Chinaberry home, which had been the partiesâ€™ marital residence.Â  The court stated the Chinaberry home was to be sold and Wife repaid her investment of nonmarital funds of $48,529.29, with the parties to equally split the remaining net proceeds.Â  The court reviewed the statutory factors, noting this was a marriage of long duration that ended with the partiesâ€™ divorce on the ground of Husbandâ€™s adultery, and that Wife, who was 56, had suffered the removal of ninety percent of her stomach and thus had limited income potential due to her disability.Â  Husband, meanwhile, had misrepresented his inability to work, which was revealed after Wife hired a private investigator.Â  \r\nThe evidence shows the parties were married on July 30, 1993, in Hershey, Pennsylvania.Â  A week later, on August 5, 1993, they signed a Real Estate Agreement that stated the parties intended to relocate to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, and purchase real estate using equity that Wife received in the sale of property from her prior marriage.Â  The settlement statement from the purchase of the partiesâ€™ Crooked Pond home shows a cash down payment of $48,529.29 was made on the $202,500.00 residence and it is undisputed those funds were supplied by Wife.Â  Wife testified that when the parties purchased the Chinaberry home, she made a cash payment of $39,630.72, as indicated on the settlement statement, and that additional nonmarital funds went towards remodeling the home.Â  The family court stated it was satisfied that Wifeâ€™s nonmarital property was used to create equity in the current marital residence in the amount of $48,529.29 and that this amount could be traced to the current home.Â  \r\nAlthough Husband argued Wife had either already received her nonmarital investment back or, alternatively, that her nonmarital investment was subsequently transmuted, the family court believed Wifeâ€™s evidence and concluded the intent of the parties was that Wifeâ€™s contribution of nonmarital funds from her prior marriage was to remain nonmarital.Â  Husband was, in any event, to receive an equal share of the net proceeds from the sale of the Chinaberry home after Wife received her funds, so the family court did not, contrary to Husbandâ€™s assertion, ignore his alleged contributions of funds and personal labor.Â  The court adequately reviewed the statutory factors before making its award and, although the evidence was conflicting, we hold the overall apportionment was fair and Husband has shown no clear error amounting to an abuse of discretion.Â  See Woodall, 322 S.C. at 10, 471 S.E.2d at 157 (stating where the evidence is disputed, an appellate court may adhere to the findings of the trial judge, who was in a better position to evaluate credibility); Bragg v. Bragg,&nbsp;347 S.C. 16, 23, 553 S.E.2d 251, 255&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThe [family courtâ€™s] apportionment of marital property will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€); Terwilliger v. Terwilliger, 298 S.C. 144, 147, 378 S.E.2d 609, 611&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1989) (â€œResolving questions of credibility is a function of the family court judge who heard the testimony.â€); Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988) (stating an appellate court looks to the fairness of the overall apportionment and if the end result is fair, it is irrelevant if an appellate court might have weighed specific factors differently). Â Â Â Â \r\nII.Â  Alimony\r\nHusband next asserts the family court erred in awarding Wife permanent periodic alimony of $1,000.00 per month.Â  \r\nThe amount of alimony to be awarded is within the broad discretion of the family court and should not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Rimer v. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 524, 605 S.E.2d 572, 574 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs either when a court is controlled by an error of law or where the factual findings lack evidentiary support.Â  Id.\r\nSection 20-3-130(C) of the South Carolina Code lists the factors a family court should consider when deciding whether and how much alimony to award, including the duration of the marriage, the educational background of each spouse, the employment history and earning potential of each spouse, the standard of living established during the marriage, and the current and reasonably anticipated expenses and needs of both spouses.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2005).Â Â  \r\nThe family court was primarily concerned with Wifeâ€™s future ability to pay for her health insurance coverage because the coverage she had through Husband would be unavailable after the divorce.Â  The court set the award at $1,000.00 per month so she would have enough after taxes to purchase her own health insurance.Â Â  Â \r\nWe find given her pre-existing health condition and lack of income, Wife would need alimony to cover this cost.Â  The trial court noted Wife was in poor health and unable to work due to her disability.Â  Moreover, the court expressly found Husbandâ€™s testimony that he was unable to work was not credible based on surveillance conducted by Wifeâ€™s private investigator, which showed him engaged in activities at several job sites and transporting and instructing employees.Â  The court further noted Husbandâ€™s lifestyle established that he was receiving income from working, as he could not support the lifestyle he was enjoying without additional income beyond the retirement funds he was receiving.Â Â Â  \r\nOur review of the record supports the courtâ€™s findings.Â  For example, despite his protestations as to his lack of income, at the time of trial Husband had an option on a million-dollar residence.Â  In addition, Wife demonstrated Husbandâ€™s continuing employment in the home improvement field although he had denied working.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the family courtâ€™s award of $1,000.00 monthly alimony to Wife.\r\nIII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees and Costs\r\nHusband lastly contends the family court erred in ordering him to pay $12,500.00 of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  Specifically, Husband argues there is no evidence to support the courtâ€™s conclusions that Wife was unable to pay and that it would detrimentally affect Wifeâ€™s standard of living to require her to pay them in full.Â  Husband contends Wife is in a better position to pay the fees since she is to receive $48,529.29 more from the marital estate.Â  Husband further states if he should prevail on appeal, the award necessarily should be reversed.Â  Finally, Husband contends since evidence of the attorneyâ€™s fees was submitted by affidavit, the family court deprived him of the opportunity to conduct cross-examination regarding the fees.\r\nThe family court is authorized to make an award of attorneyâ€™s fees and other costs pursuant to statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-120 (1985) &amp; id. Â§ 20-3-130 (Supp. 2005).Â  â€œIt is well settled that an award of attorneyâ€™s fees is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion.â€Â  Smith v. Smith,&nbsp;308 S.C. 492, 496, 419 S.E.2d 232, 234-35&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1992).\r\nInitially, we note Husband does not expressly challenge the amount of Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs; rather, he only argues that he should not be required to pay a portion thereof.Â  We find, however, no abuse of discretion in this case.Â  \r\nIn deciding whether to make an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the court should consider the contingency of compensation, beneficial results obtained, the abilities of the parties to pay, their respective financial conditions, and the effect of the attorneyâ€™s fees on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161-62 n.1, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 n.1 (1991) (citing Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 320 S.E.2d 706 (1984)).\r\nWifeâ€™s fees were in excess of $20,000.00.Â  The family court found Wife did not have the ability to pay her own attorneyâ€™s fees due to her disability, which involved the loss of ninety percent of her stomach, her loss of income, and the need for financial support.Â  Moreover, Husband had the ability to assist with Wifeâ€™s expenses in light of his retirement income and the ability to earn income from his self-employment.Â  The court also noted Wife had received beneficial results and had prevailed on her claim for a divorce on fault grounds, alimony, and the equitable division.Â  We conclude the record amply supports these findings.Â  \r\nTo the extent Husband further contends the family court erred by having the parties submit affidavits of attorneyâ€™s fees, thus depriving him of the opportunity to conduct cross-examination, we find Husband does not indicate where in the record he made a contemporaneous objection on this basis that was ruled on by the court.Â  See, e.g., Watson ex. rel. Watson v. Chapman, 343 S.C. 471, 540 S.E.2d 484 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating a contemporaneous objection must be both made to and ruled on by the trial court to preserve an alleged error for appellate review) (citing Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997)).Â  The parties attempted to submit affidavits during the trial and the family court asked that they be held until the end of the trial.Â  Thereafter, each of the parties submitted their affidavits without making any objections as to this procedure.Â  Accordingly, we find no reversible error in this instance.Â  Cf. Clark v. Ross, 284 S.C. 543, 571, 328 S.E.2d 91, 108 (Ct. App. 1985) (holding the trial court erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees and expenses based on an unserved affidavit without affording the opposing party the opportunity to question the affidavit and the information it contained).Â Â Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.  \r\nGOOLSBY, HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the Court in its decision, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2006-UP-124","title":"Madera Utilities v.

McIntyre, S.C. Dept. of Health &amp; Environmental Control, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Madera Utilities appeals a circuit court order affirming an administrative law judgeâ€™s decision denying its motion to add parties to the action under Rule 19(a), SCRCP.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn October 1985, Madera Utilities purchased the right to operate the Heatherwood Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) in Central, South Carolina.Â  Madera operated the facility under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) in September 1998.Â  Among other things, the permit required Madera to complete certain construction projects and eliminate discharge from the facility by September 1, 2000 in accordance with a schedule of compliance.Â  Madera did not challenge the permitâ€™s terms at the time of issuance.Â  \r\nMadera failed to comply with the NPDES permit by neglecting to eliminate the facilityâ€™s discharge by September 1, 2000.Â  In response, on September 28, 2001, DHEC issued an administrative order that outlined the violations, set a new schedule of compliance, and imposed a $5,000 fine.Â  Following receipt of this order, Madera requested a contested case hearing before an administrative law judge.Â  In its Prehearing Statement, Madera asserted that in order to reach a full and fair resolution of the dispute, Pickens County, the City of Clemson, and the owners of the property on which the WWTF is located should be added as parties.\r\nIn a pre-hearing order, the ALJ treated this request as a motion to join necessary parties under Rule 19(a), SCRCP.Â  The order stated that while the requested parties may have interests that relate to the action, Madera was the permit holder and operator of the treatment facility.Â  Accordingly, the ALJ denied the motion.Â  \r\nAt the outset of the hearing before the ALJ, Madera stipulated that it did not comply with the NPDES permit or the accompanying schedule of compliance.Â  During the hearing Madera asserted that it was impossible for it to comply with the order because: â€œ1.) Madera does not have the financial resources to complete the construction required to eliminate its discharge; and 2.) Madera does not own the real property on which the facility is situated and thus cannot undertake the required construction without the permission of the propertyâ€™s owner . . . .â€Â  \r\nMr. Rogers, the secretary and sole remaining officer of Madera, explained during the hearing that Maderaâ€™s non-compliance with the permit and subsequent order was not willful.Â  Specifically, he asserted that Madera made attempts to obtain financing in order to make the necessary improvements to the WWTF, but was unable to obtain funds because it does not own the property on which the facility is located.Â  Mr. Rogers also informed the court that Madera was in discussions with the Pickens County Regional Authority and the City of Clemson regarding a possible purchase or assumption of the facility.Â  \r\nFollowing the hearing, the ALJ issued an order in favor of DHEC dismissing Maderaâ€™s arguments as insufficient to warrant relief from the permitâ€™s enforcement.Â  Madera appealed this decision to the Board of Health and Environmental Control who affirmed and adopted the ALJâ€™s order.Â  This decision was subsequently appealed to the circuit court, which denied the appeal without an opinion.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMaderaâ€™s sole contention in its appeal to this court is that the previous tribunals erred in failing to join Pickens County, the City of Clemson and the property owners as necessary parties under Rule 19(a), SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 19(a), SCRCP provides that a party shall be joined in an action if:\r\n\r\n(1) [I]n his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in his absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the record, and the ALJâ€™s ruling on this issue in particular, we conclude that neither the ALJ nor the other tribunals erred in refusing to add the requested parties.Â  As the ALJ noted, while the City of Clemson, Pickens County, and the landowners may have interests that relate to the current action, Madera is the permit holder and the operator of the facility that is subject to regulation.Â  As such, Madera has not shown how failure to join the parties would impair or impede their ability to protect their interests or subject them to the possibility of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations.\r\nAFFIRMED.
