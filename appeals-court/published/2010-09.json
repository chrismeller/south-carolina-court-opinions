Moss, of Beaufort, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tM.

After two days, she went to the area emergency room where it was\r\n  discovered that chylothorax was leaking into her pleural cavity and her\r\n  diaphragm was not functioning properly.Â  One treating physician indicated these\r\n  problems were likely a result of her recent surgery in which damage to the\r\n  thoracic artery and phrenic nerve are possible complications.Â  Fletcher was\r\n  treated and did make improvements although she still suffers from significant\r\n  fatigue that she testified she did not experience prior to the surgery.\r\nFletcher\r\n  brought this medical malpractice claim against MUSC alleging Dr. Brothers and\r\n  Dr. Rios were negligent in performing the surgery and she was not properly\r\n  advised of the risks associated with subclavian bypass.Â  At trial, Dr. Thomas\r\n  Wood testified on Fletcher's behalf and stated he believed Drs. Brothers and\r\n  Rios had deviated in the standard of care during Fletcher's surgery and that as\r\n  a physician, he thought it was a good idea to advise patients of the risks\r\n  associated with medical procedures.Â  Dr. Thomas Appleby testified as an expert\r\n  for MUSC and opined he did not believe Drs. Brothers and Rios had deviated from\r\n  the standard of care in performing Fletcher's operation and that it was the\r\n  standard of care to advise patients of the risks associated with any surgical\r\n  procedure.Â  Fletcher testified she would not have undergone subclavian bypass\r\n  had she known the procedure was not guaranteed to resolve her symptoms and that\r\n  it could turn out the way it did.Â  The circuit court granted a directed verdict\r\n  in favor of MUSC on both claims, and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis \r\n\r\n&quot;A directed verdict should be granted where the evidence\r\n  raises no issue for the jury as to the defendant's liability.&quot;Â  Guffey\r\n    v. Columbia/Colleton Reg'l Hosp., Inc., 364 S.C. 158, 163, 612 S.E.2d 695,\r\n  697 (2005).Â  On review, an appellate court will affirm the granting of a directed\r\n  verdict in favor of the defendant when there is no evidence on any one element\r\n  of the alleged cause of action. Â Id. Â &quot;In a medical malpractice\r\n  action, the plaintiff must establish proximate cause as well as the negligence\r\n  of the physician.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nI.&nbsp; Medical Malpractice â€“\r\n  Negligence in Performance of Procedure\r\nFletcher\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in granting MUSC's directed verdict motion when\r\n  Dr. Wood opined Dr. Brothers and Dr. Rios deviated from the standard of care in\r\n  performing her surgery.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn a medical malpractice action the plaintiff must establish\r\n  &quot;(1) 'the generally recognized practices and procedures which would be\r\n  exercised by competent practitioners in a defendant doctor's field of medicine\r\n  under the same or similar circumstances,' and (2) a departure by the defendant 'from the\r\n  recognized and generally accepted standards, practices and procedures . . . .'&quot; Â Jones v. Doe,\r\n  372 S.C. 53, 61, 640 S.E.2d 514, 518 (Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Cox v. Lund,\r\n  286 S.C. 410, 414, 334 S.E.2d 116, 118 (1985)).Â  Furthermore the plaintiff must\r\n  present evidence that the defendant's failure to adhere to the standard of care\r\n  proximately caused the complained of injury.Â  Id.Â  &quot;The probative\r\n  value of expert testimony stands or falls upon an evidentiary showing of the\r\n  facts upon which the opinion is, or must logically be, predicated.&quot;Â  Ward\r\n    v. Epting, 290 S.C. 547, 563, 351 S.E.2d 867, 876 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\nIn the present case, Dr. Wood testified the standard\r\n  of care in a subclavian bypass surgery is to preserve the phrenic nerve and\r\n  thoracic duct.Â  With respect to MUSC's deviation from the standard of care, he\r\n  opined:\r\n\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; Do\r\n  you have an opinion, Doctor, as to whether or not Dr. Brothers and Dr. Rios,\r\n  the agents of MUSC, in performing this surgery deviated from the standard of\r\n  care?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; I\r\n  think so.Â  I think they did.\r\n\r\nHowever,\r\n  Dr. Wood testified on cross-examination that complications such as trauma to\r\n  the phrenic nerve and damage to the thoracic duct could have occurred during\r\n  this procedure even in the absence of any surgical negligence.Â  He also\r\n  testified:\r\n\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; Do\r\n  you see anything in there [the operative note and records] that indicates that\r\n  Dr. Brothers used any improper technique to do this operation?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; No.\r\n\r\nEssentially,\r\n  Fletcher asks us to conclude that the occurrence of a complication is itself\r\n  evidence of negligence.Â  However, South Carolina does not recognize the\r\n  doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.Â  Snow v. City of Columbia, 305\r\n  S.C. 544, 555 n.7, 409 S.E.2d 797, 803 n.7 (Ct. App. 1991) (&quot;In an action\r\n  for negligence, the plaintiff must prove by direct or circumstantial evidence\r\n  that the defendant did not exercise reasonable care.Â  South Carolina's\r\n  rejection of res ipsa loquitur is consistent with its general adherence\r\n  to fault based liability in tort.&quot;).Â  Simply no evidence establishes how Dr. Brothers or Dr. Rios deviated from the standard of care.Â  Unfortunately,\r\n  two of the risks associated with this procedure did befall Fletcher.Â \r\n  Nevertheless, we are not permitted to speculate that misfortune was the result\r\n  of negligence in the absence of any evidence as to how the physicians deviated\r\n  from the standard of care. \r\nBowie v. Hearn,\r\n  292 S.C. 223, 355 S.E.2d 550 (Ct. App. 1987) (Bowie I), addresses this\r\n  very point.Â  This case was reversed based on the particular facts presented,\r\n  but the reasoning employed by the court of appeals is instructive.Â  Bowie sued\r\n  the physician who delivered him via cesarean section because he was cut on the\r\n  cheek during the procedure, resulting in a scar.Â  Id. at 224-25, 355\r\n  S.E.2d at 551.Â  Bowie's expert testified the standard of care required the\r\n  physician not to cut the baby.Â  Id. at 226, 355 S.E.2d at 552.Â  In\r\n  analyzing the sufficiency of this testimony, the court alluded to another\r\n  oft-cited medical malpractice case and stated:\r\n\r\n\tUnder\r\n  the plaintiff's reasoning in this case [Bowie I] the doctors in Cox[2] could simply have testified that normally colons are not perforated during\r\n  colonoscopies, the standard of care, therefore, is a doctor should not\r\n  perforate the colon, and to do so violates the standard of care.Â  Such\r\n  reasoning would, in effect, make a doctor an insurer of perfect result in every\r\n  surgical procedure.Â  A doctor is not an insurer of health and negligence may\r\n  not be inferred. \r\n\r\nId. at 227, 355 S.E.2d at 552.[3]\r\nThe\r\n  analysis in Bowie I is precisely on point with this case, and we discern\r\n  no factual basis that would cause the reasoning in that case to be inapplicable\r\n  to the facts presented here.Â  Therefore, we affirm the circuit court's granting\r\n  of a directed verdict as Fletcher presented no evidence, only speculation, that\r\n  MUSC's agents deviated from the standard of care.\r\nII.&nbsp; Medical Malpractice â€“ Lack\r\n  of Informed Consent\r\nFletcher also\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in granting MUSC's directed verdict motion\r\n  with respect to her informed consent claim.Â  We agree.\r\nAlthough the circuit court's decision rested on its conclusion that\r\n  Fletcher failed to present any evidence regarding proximate cause, we will\r\n  address the elements of duty and breach first as they are preconditions to a\r\n  finding of proximate cause, and MUSC raises them as additional sustaining\r\n  grounds.[4]\r\nUnder the doctrine of informed consent, a physician has a duty to\r\n  disclose &quot;(1) the diagnosis, (2) the general nature of the contemplated\r\n  procedure, (3) the material risks involved in the procedure,\r\n  (4) the probability of success associated with the procedure, (5) the prognosis\r\n  if the procedure is not carried out, and (6) the existence of any alternatives\r\n  to the procedure.&quot;Â  Hook v. Rothstein, 281 S.C. 541, 547, 316\r\n  S.E.2d 690, 694-95 (Ct. App. 1984). Â Because the question of whether a physician has acted unreasonably\r\n  often involves the exercise of medical judgment in most cases, expert medical\r\n  testimony is necessary to establish negligence in failing to adequately disclose\r\n  the information necessary for a patient to give informed consent.Â  Id. at 551, 316 S.E.2d at 697. Â &quot;Indeed, our [s]upreme [c]ourt has held that\r\n  in any 'area beyond the realm of ordinary lay knowledge, expert testimony will\r\n  usually be necessary to establish both the standard of care and the defendant's\r\n  departure therefrom.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Kemmerlin v. Wingate,\r\n  274 S.C. 62, 65, 261 S.E.2d 50, 51 (1979)).\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, Fletcher provided a modicum of expert testimony that MUSC's\r\n  agents deviated from the accepted standard of care, which allows her to withstand\r\n  a motion for directed verdict.Â  Fletcher's expert, Dr. Wood, testified as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; Doctor,\r\n  in your opinion should Dr. Brothers have informed Mrs. Fletcher of the risks\r\n  associated with the thoracic duct and the phrenic nerve, prior to surgery?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; I\r\n  think it is a good idea.Â  I believe in informing the patient what the risks\r\n  are.Â  I don't see anything wrong with it.\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; Do\r\n  you believe that is a deviation from the standard of care, -- that it should be\r\n  done by every physician?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; From\r\n  what I could tell from the notes, there was no opportunity for him to because\r\n  he wasn't there.\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; There\r\n  wasn't any information?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; Well,\r\n  I don't think that she had a full explanation what was going to go on.Â  And of\r\n  course, everybody hopes that every operation goes as slick as it can and that\r\n  everything goes perfect, but sometimes that doesn't happen.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  primary expert testimony on this point was proffered testimony from MUSC's\r\n  expert, Dr. Appleby.Â  Over the course of several pages of testimony, including\r\n  references to his deposition, Dr. Appleby testified a physician should discuss\r\n  risks with his patient.Â  He further testified he considered damage to the\r\n  phrenic nerve and thoracic duct to be risks of this procedure.Â  \r\n\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; And\r\n  is it your opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that a [doctor]\r\n  needs to explain the material risks associated with the subclavian bypass\r\n  surgery to his patient before performing it?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; I\r\n  believe they should discuss risks, yes.\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; And is it your opinion, to a\r\n  reasonable degree of medical certainty, that a thoracic duct injury and a phrenic nerve injury are material risks associated with this procedure?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; They are low but definite risks.\r\n\r\nWith\r\n  respect to whether the failure to inform Fletcher of these particular risks was\r\n  a deviation from the standard of care, Dr. Appleby stated:\r\n\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; And if a physician fails to inform his patient undergoing a \r\n\tsubclavian bypass surgery that the phrenic nerve and/or the thoracic duct \r\n\tmay be damaged, is that a deviation of the standard of care?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; Not as long as he's talked about generalized risks, is what I \r\n\twould say.&nbsp; I think the standard of care mandates that you have to talk \r\n\tto the patient about risks.&nbsp; The specifics of that risk is up to the \r\n\tphysician, the physician's judgment, and the patient and how their \r\n\trelationship is &quot;maturing,&quot; I\r\n  guess.Â  \r\n\r\nOn a\r\n  directed verdict motion, we are to view the evidence presented in the light\r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  See J.T. Baggerly v. CSX\r\n    Transp., Inc., 370 S.C. 362, 368, 635 S.E.2d 97, 100 (2006) (&quot;When\r\n  reviewing the grant of a directed verdict, the evidence and all reasonable\r\n  inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party\r\n  against whom the verdict was directed.&quot;).Â  The testimony regarding the\r\n  standard of care and any deviation in this case is equivocal. Nevertheless, Fletcher\r\n  presented some evidence the standard of care is to inform a patient of potential\r\n  damage to the thoracic duct and phrenic nerve and that to fail to do so is a\r\n  deviation from that standard.[5]\r\nHaving\r\n  determined Fletcher presented at least some evidence establishing the first two\r\n  elements of her claim, the standard of care (duty) and deviation from it\r\n  (negligence), we move to the third and final element in any negligence claim,\r\n  proximate cause.Â  We disagree with the circuit court's reasoning that because\r\n  Fletcher failed to present expert testimony that the lack of information\r\n  proximately caused her injuries, she could not succeed in her claim.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court was correct in holding Fletcher had the burden to show any\r\n  deviation from the standard of care was the proximate cause of her injury.Â  Hook,\r\n  281 S.C. at 564, 316 S.E.2d at 704.Â  To do so, Fletcher must show a reasonable\r\n  person, having been properly informed, would have elected not to have the\r\n  procedure.Â  Id. at 565, 316 S.E.2d at 705.Â  However, the circuit court\r\n  misinterpreted that requirement to mean that expert testimony must establish\r\n  this point.Â  \r\nIn Hook,\r\n  the court rejected the subjective test and adopted the objective, reasonable\r\n  man test for discerning proximate cause.Â  The court cited a Maryland case to\r\n  support its decision.\r\n\r\n\t[I]f a subjective [test] were applied, the testimony of the\r\n  plaintiff as to what he [or she] would have hypothetically done would be the\r\n  controlling consideration. Thus, proof of causation under a subjective [test]\r\n  would ultimately turn on the credibility of the hindsight of a person seeking\r\n  recovery after he had experienced a most undesirable result. Â Such a test puts\r\n  the physician in &quot;jeopardy of the patient's hindsight and bitterness.&quot;\r\n  Â Furthermore, in cases where the plaintiff dies as a result of an unforewarned\r\n  collateral consequence, the subjective [test] would bar recovery on an informed\r\n  consent claim altogether. \r\n\r\nHook, 281 S.C. at 565, 316 S.E.2d at 705 (quoting Sard\r\n  v. Hardy, 379 A.2d 1014, 1025 (Md. 1977)).\r\nWhile Hook adopted the objective test, nothing indicates the reasonable man\r\n  test requires expert testimony.Â  As in most cases, the determination of whether\r\n  a reasonable person, knowing the risks, would have had the procedure is a\r\n  question left to the fact-finder.Â  This notion is supported by the cases Hook relies upon in adopting the objective test.Â  See Canterbury v. Spence,\r\n  464 F.2d 772, 791 (C.A.D.C. 1972) (stating the objective test requires the\r\n  fact-finder to interpret the plaintiff's testimony through the filter of\r\n  reasonableness in determining the proximate cause issue); Woolley v.\r\n    Henderson, 418 A.2d 1123, 1132 (Me. 1980) (agreeing with trial court's\r\n  instruction to the jury to employ the objective standard in considering\r\n  proximate cause); Sard, 379 A.2d at 1026 (stating the plaintiff's\r\n  testimony is relevant although not determinative and alluding to no expert\r\n  testimony regarding causation).\r\nAssuming\r\n  expert testimony was not required to establish proximate cause in this informed\r\n  consent claim, we must next consider whether any evidence was presented that\r\n  would support a finding by the jury that Fletcher, using the reasonable person\r\n  standard, would not have moved forward with her subclavian bypass had she been\r\n  advised of the risks.Â  Dr. Appleby testified:\r\n\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; Doctor,\r\n  do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty whether a\r\n  well-informed patient, one that was told of a phrenic nerve injury and\r\n  chylotorax, whether that patient, given the condition that Mrs. Fletcher had,\r\n  would have elected to have this procedure done?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; I\r\n  do.Â  I think it was a reasonable operation to offer and I think it was a\r\n  reasonable choice by the patient.\r\n\r\nFletcher's\r\n  own testimony on the matter at least raises some issue with respect to the\r\n  reasonableness of proceeding with the surgery having known of the risks\r\n  involved.Â  \r\n\r\n\tQ.&nbsp; Okay.Â \r\n  Now, had you known the risks or had you known what has occurred to you now and\r\n  the risk of that, would have had this surgery?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; No,\r\n  I wouldn't have.Â  There was â€“ why put myself through something that wasn't even\r\n  a guarantee that it was going to stay fixed?Â  I mean, less than a year later, I\r\n  was back seeing Dr. Elliott for a very similar reason.Â  I still have that\r\n  artery problem under my arm, and I guess I will die with it because I certainly\r\n  am not going to put myself under the knife again.Â  It's just everything that I\r\n  have been through since I had that surgery did not make it worthwhile.Â  Had I known\r\n  that there was no guarantee that it was a fix-it, and if I had been told what\r\n  happens to a phrenic nerve and all these other things, I wouldn't â€“ I would not\r\n  have been willing to take that, risk.\r\n\r\nFletcher's\r\n  testimony is not determinative under an objective standard, but it is some evidence\r\n  that proceeding with the surgery was unreasonable in light of the risks and\r\n  potential outcome.Â  The jurors could weigh this evidence against their own\r\n  experiences and in light of Dr. Appleby's testimony to arrive at a conclusion\r\n  concerning what a reasonable person would have done under the circumstances. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the circuit court's granting of a directed\r\n  verdict on Fletcher's claim of medical malpractice in performance of her\r\n  surgery.Â  We reverse the granting of a directed verdict with respect to her\r\n  informed consent claim and remand that issue for a new trial.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nGeathers and \r\nlockemy, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Dr. Rios\r\n  married and took the surname Marlowe after Fletcher's surgery.\r\n[2] Cox v. Lund,\r\n  286 S.C. 410, 334 S.E.2d 116 (1985).Â  In Cox, the supreme court found\r\n  evidence showing the defendant physician had deviated from the standard of care\r\n  in failing to properly clear the patient's colon for a colonoscopy was\r\n  sufficient evidence to send the malpractice action to the jury when the\r\n  patient's colon was perforated during the procedure.\r\n[3] The supreme court\r\n  found the defendant-physician's testimony that he took three or four swipes\r\n  with his scalpel was enough evidence of negligence to withstand summary\r\n  judgment when testimony showed the procedure for a cesarean was to make a\r\n  series of progressively deepening incisions.Â  Bowie v. Hearn, 294 S.C.\r\n  344, 345-46, 364 S.E.2d 469, 469-70 (1988) (BowieÂ  II). Â No\r\n  self-incriminating testimony from Dr. Brothers in this case suggests a\r\n  deviation in the standard of care.\r\n[4] The circuit\r\n  court stated:Â  &quot;We still have to get to the third prong [proximate\r\n  cause].Â  I don't quarrel with anything that you said, I don't disagree with\r\n  that.Â  That's what I just said, assuming everything you've said, no question he\r\n  set a standard, no question that he said that if you didn't do it, that it was\r\n  a departure.Â  The question that you asked was, did it proximately cause an\r\n  injury in this case?Â  No.Â  No expert has testified that it did.&quot; \r\n[5] In Stallings\r\n  v. Ratliff, 292 S.C. 349, 351-52, 356 S.E.2d 414, 416 (Ct. App. 1987), the\r\n  plaintiff presented expert testimony indicating the defendant-physician had a\r\n  duty to disclose the risk of a perforated esophagus during the procedure\r\n  performed.Â  The court stated that when testimony conflicted regarding whether\r\n  that information was conveyed to the patient, the jury could infer the\r\n  deviation from the standard of care and a &quot;ritual incantation of certain\r\n  words&quot; from the expert that it constituted a deviation was not necessary.Â  Id. at 353, 356 S.E.2d at 417.Â  Therefore, while Dr. Appleby's answer to\r\n  the deviation question was a qualified no, it is not fatal to Fletcher's claim\r\n  at the directed verdict stage.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4733","title":"SCDSS v.

Wilson, Jr., of Summerville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tBenjamin Andre LaFond, of Summerville, for Guardian ad Litem.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.:Â The Department of Social Services\r\n  (DSS) filed an intervention action against Randy S. (Father) and Dawn S.\r\n  (Mother).Â  Subsequently, Mother consented to a finding that she neglected her\r\n  two minor children (Children).Â  Following a merits hearing, the family court\r\n  issued an order (1) finding Father neglected or abused Children; (2) awarding\r\n  custody of Children to his sister, Sandra B. (Aunt); (3) only allowing Father\r\n  supervised visitation with Children; and (4) permitting DSS to close its case.Â  We reverse and remand. \r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nFather\r\n  and Mother are married and are the biological parents of Children.Â Â  At the\r\n  time of the removal, Children were four years old and three weeks old.Â  \r\nDSS\r\n  became involved in this case on June 2, 2006, when it investigated a report of physical\r\n  neglect and abandonment.Â  According to DSS, Mother abused drugs and left\r\n  Children with a neighbor and did not return, while Father did not protect\r\n  Children from the threat posed by Mother's substance abuse.[1]Â \r\n  DSS arrived at Father and Mother's home with law enforcement.Â  According to\r\n  Father, DSS wanted to place Children in DSS custody; however, DSS agreed to\r\n  allow Aunt to take custody of Children.Â  DSS offered safety plans to Mother and\r\n  Father.Â  Thereafter, DSS instituted a treatment plan for Mother and Father.Â \r\n  Father agreed to the March 6, 2007 treatment plan ordering him to (1) complete\r\n  parenting classes and follow any DSS recommendations and (2) continue\r\n  supervised visitation with Children.[2]Â  \r\nOn\r\n  March 13, 2007, DSS filed a complaint for intervention.Â  On April 19 and 20,\r\n  2007, a merits hearing was conducted.Â  On June 15, 2007, Father made a motion\r\n  requesting the family court return Children because DSS had not filed a\r\n  petition for removal pursuant to section 63-7-1660(A) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (2010).Â  According to Father, despite DSS's characterization of this as an\r\n  intervention action, Children were actually removed from his home.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  on August 20, 2007, the family court issued its order from the April merits\r\n  hearing.Â  The family court's order reflected DSS, Mother, and Father agreed to\r\n  the &quot;findings and the treatment plan&quot; and temporary custody of\r\n  Children would remain with Aunt.Â  The order also indicated DSS, Mother, and\r\n  Father agreed Mother and Father would (1) receive supervised visitation; (2)\r\n  refrain from the influence of drugs or alcohol during visitation; and (3)\r\n  cooperate with any requested drug testing.Â  Subsequently, on November 9, 2007,\r\n  the family court denied Father's motion to return Children, stating: &quot;The\r\n  previous order was based on parties' agreement.Â  Additionally, [Mother] admits\r\n  drug use in the last two weeks and that she continues to stay in Father's\r\n  home.&quot;Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 22, 23, and 27, 2008, the family court conducted a second merits\r\n  hearing.Â  Following the hearing, the family court issued a merits order finding\r\n  Mother and Father neglected Children.Â  The family court found Children were\r\n  neglected and &quot;could not be protected without removal from the home and\r\n  intervention and services.&quot;Â  The family court also found Mother and Father\r\n  were entitled to supervised visitation.Â  However, after three consecutive\r\n  months of negative hair strand drug tests, Mother could have unsupervised\r\n  visitation.Â  Further, the family court awarded Aunt custody of Children and\r\n  permitted DSS to close its case.Â  Father filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion,\r\n  which the family court denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFather contends Children were improperly removed from\r\n  his custody and the family court erred in failing to follow the proper statutory\r\n  procedure following removal.Â  Father argues as a result the family court erred\r\n  in finding the case warranted both intervention and removal when DSS had only filed\r\n  an action for intervention.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nDSS has the\r\n  statutory duty to investigate all reports of suspected child abuse and\r\n  neglect.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-900 (2010).Â  Upon investigation, if DSS\r\n  determines a preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion a child is\r\n  abused or neglected, it may petition the family court for authority to offer\r\n  services with or without removal of the child from the parents' home.Â  \r\nPursuant\r\n  to section 63-7-1650(A) of the South Carolina Code (2010), DSS may\r\n  &quot;petition the family court for authority to intervene and provide\r\n  protective services without removal of custody if [DSS] determines by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence that the child is an abused or neglected child\r\n  and that the child cannot be protected from harm without intervention.&quot;Â \r\n  The family court is then required to hold a hearing within thirty-five days.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1650(C) (2010).Â  After the hearing, the family court may\r\n  intervene and provide protective services if &quot;the allegations of the petition\r\n  are supported by a preponderance of the evidence including a finding that the\r\n  child is an abused or neglected child as defined in [s]ection 63-7-20 and the\r\n  child cannot be protected from further harm without intervention.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1650(E) (2010).Â  Child abuse or neglect occurs when a parent\r\n  &quot;inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or mental\r\n  injury or engages in acts or omissions which present a substantial risk of\r\n  physical or mental injury to the child, including injuries sustained as a\r\n  result of excessive corporal punishment.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-20(4)(a)\r\n  (2010).\r\nSection\r\n  63-7-1660(A) of the South Carolina Code (2010) grants DSS authority to petition\r\n  the family court to remove a child from custody of a parent if DSS\r\n  &quot;determines by a preponderance of evidence that the child is an abused or\r\n  neglected child and that the child cannot be safely maintained in the home in\r\n  that he cannot be protected from unreasonable risk of harm affecting the\r\n  child's life, physical health, safety, or mental well-being without\r\n  removal.&quot;Â  As with intervention, the family court is also required to hold\r\n  a hearing within thirty-five days of receipt of the petition to determine whether\r\n  removal is necessary.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1660(D) (2010).Â  The family court\r\n  shall not order that a child be removed from the custody of the parent unless\r\n  the allegations in the petition are supported by a preponderance of evidence\r\n  including a finding that the child is an abused or neglected child as previously\r\n  defined and &quot;that retention of the child in or return of the child to the\r\n  home would place the child at unreasonable risk of harm affecting the child's\r\n  life, physical health or safety, or mental well-being and the child cannot\r\n  reasonably be protected from this harm without being removed.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 63-7-1660(E) (2010).Â Â  If the family court removes custody of the child,\r\n  the court's order shall contain a finding of whether DSS made reasonable\r\n  efforts to prevent removal and a finding of whether continuation of the child\r\n  in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-7-1660(G) (2010).Â  Pursuant to section 63-7-1660(G)(1)-(4):\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  order shall state: (1)\r\n  the services made available to the family before the removal of the child and\r\n  how they related to the needs of the family; (2)\r\n  the efforts of the agency to provide these services to the family before\r\n  removal; (3)\r\n  why the efforts to provide services did not eliminate the need for removal; and (4)\r\n  whether the efforts to eliminate the need for removal were reasonable . . . .Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nHowever, if DSS's &quot;first\r\n  contact with the child occurred under such circumstances that reasonable\r\n  services would not have allowed the child to remain safely in the home, the\r\n  court shall find that removal of the child without services or without further\r\n  services was reasonable.&quot;Â  Â§ 63-7-1660(G)(4).Â  \r\nIf\r\n  there is not time to apply for a court order pursuant to section 63-7-1660, law\r\n  enforcement may take emergency protective custody (EPC) of a child without the\r\n  consent of the child's parents if &quot;the officer has probable cause to\r\n  believe that by reason of abuse or neglect the child's life, health, or\r\n  physical safety is in substantial and imminent danger if the child is not taken\r\n  into emergency protective custody.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-620(A)(1)\r\n  (2010).Â  When an officer takes a child into EPC, the officer is required to\r\n  notify DSS immediately, which then has the responsibility of notifying the\r\n  parent unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.[3]Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-630 (2010).Â  Within twenty-four hours after a child is\r\n  taken into EPC, DSS is required to conduct a preliminary investigation to determine\r\n  whether EPC was proper and whether a means to avoid removal from the home\r\n  exists.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-640 (2010).Â  If DSS determines probable cause\r\n  exists that a &quot;child's life, health, or physical safety is in imminent and\r\n  substantial danger&quot; because of abuse or neglect, DSS may assume legal\r\n  custody of the child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-660 (2010).Â  DSS is then required\r\n  to initiate a removal proceeding pursuant to section 63-7-1660 on or before the\r\n  next working day after initiating the investigation.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-7-700(B)(1) (2010).Â  The family court is then required to hold a probable cause\r\n  hearing within seventy-two hours of the time the child was taken into EPC and\r\n  conduct a merits hearing within thirty-five days.Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-7-710(A), (E) (2010).Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the family court conducts a hearing pursuant to section 63-7-1650 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2010) or section 63-7-1660 of the South Carolina Code (2010) and\r\n  finds the child should remain in the home, the family court must review and\r\n  approve a treatment plan &quot;designed to alleviate any danger to the child\r\n  and to aid the parents so that the child will not be endangered in the future.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1670(A) (2010).Â  If a child is removed from the home, the\r\n  family court must approve a placement plan, which DSS must submit in writing to\r\n  the family court at the removal hearing or within ten days after the removal\r\n  hearing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-1680(A) (2010).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court is then required to conduct a permanency planning hearing &quot;no\r\n  later than one year&quot; following removal of a child.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  63-7-1700(A) (2010).Â  &quot;At the initial permanency planning hearing, the\r\n  court shall review the status of the child and the progress being made toward\r\n  the child's return home or toward any other permanent plan approved at the\r\n  removal hearing.Â  The family court's order is required to make specific\r\n  findings in accordance with this section.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we note that pursuant to section 63-7-1650, DSS brought this child abuse and/or\r\n  neglect proceeding as an action for intervention.Â  At the time DSS filed its\r\n  complaint, Children were not in Father and Mother's custody, and at no point\r\n  did DSS move to amend its complaint to seek relief pursuant to the removal\r\n  statute, section 63-7-1660.Â  \r\nWhen law enforcement arrived at Father's home, rather than have\r\n  law enforcement take Children into EPC, Father agreed to place Children with\r\n  relatives.&nbsp; Subsequently, Father filed a motion requesting the family\r\n  court return Children to his custody, arguing Children were improperly removed\r\n  from his home when DSS did not file a petition for removal.&nbsp; Despite DSS's\r\n  contention that this was only an intervention action, we find the evidence\r\n  supports a finding that Children were removed from Father's custody.\r\nAs a\r\n  result, we find the family court erred in granting custody of Children to Aunt\r\n  and allowing DSS to close its case because intervention does not contemplate\r\n  placement of children with third parties.Â  Instead, the statute specifically\r\n  states its purpose is to &quot;intervene and provide protective services without removal.&quot;Â  Â§ 63-7-1650(A) (emphasis added).Â  Because DSS in actuality\r\n  initiated a removal action instead of an intervention action, it was required\r\n  to follow the statutory procedures for removal and file a petition with the\r\n  family court after Children were taken into EPC.Â  Then, the family court would\r\n  have conducted a probable cause hearing within seventy-two hours and determined\r\n  whether probable cause existed for DSS to assume legal custody of Children.Â  If\r\n  the family court determined probable cause existed to remove Children from the\r\n  home, a merits hearing should have been conducted within thirty-five days.Â  Here,\r\n  Children were out of the home for almost eleven months before a merits hearing\r\n  was held on April 20, 2007.Â  By following the comprehensive scheme outlined in\r\n  the statutes, Father would have been afforded the safeguards the statutes are\r\n  designed to provide.Â  See S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Wilson,\r\n  352 S.C. 445, 452, 574 S.E.2d 730, 733&nbsp;(2002) (&quot;The statutory\r\n  proceeding is a civil action aimed at protection of a child, not a criminal\r\n  action geared toward punishing a defendant.&quot;) (internal quotation marks\r\n  omitted).\r\nWe\r\n  recognize the unique procedural posture before this court and the fact that\r\n  Children have been out of Father's home for over four years.Â  As a result, an\r\n  immediate change in custody may not be proper under the facts of this case\r\n  because the best interests of Children is the paramount consideration.Â  See Pountain v. Pountain, 332 S.C. 130, 135-36, 503 S.E.2d 757, 760&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 1998) (&quot;In all child custody controversies, the welfare and best\r\n  interests of the children are the\r\n  primary, paramount, and controlling considerations of the court.&quot;).Â  Therefore, DSS is granted custody, exercising\r\n  its full discretion as to placement as in every other removal case.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we remand the case to the family court for a permanency planning hearing\r\n  pursuant to section 63-7-1700 of the South Carolina Code (2010).Â  A permanency\r\n  planning hearing will allow all parties and the guardian ad litem an\r\n  opportunity to update the family court on what has occurred in the four years\r\n  Children have been out of Father's custody.Â  This will also give DSS an\r\n  opportunity to offer Father further services, if necessary, and give Father the\r\n  opportunity to present evidence of compliance and a plan for Children if they are\r\n  returned.Â Â  We urge the\r\n  family court to conduct a hearing as expeditiously as possible, including\r\n  presentation of a new guardian ad litem report and updated home evaluation on\r\n  Father's residence.Â  If necessary, the family court may, inter alia,\r\n  change custody, modify visitation, and approve a treatment plan offering\r\n  additional services to Father. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we reverse the family court's order granting custody of\r\n  Children to Aunt and allowing DSS to close its case.Â  We remand the case for a\r\n  permanency planning hearing.Â  DSS is granted custody of Children pending\r\n  further order of the family court.[4]\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Father admitted Mother has a substance abuse\r\n  problem.Â  \r\n[2] Mother also agreed to the treatment plan.Â  \r\n[3] We are cognizant of the fact that DSS is often\r\n  present when law enforcement takes a child into EPC.Â  \r\n[4] In light of our decision, we need not address\r\n  Father's remainingÂ  issues on appeal.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing\r\n    of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n  (explaining this court need not review remaining issues on appeal when its\r\n  determination of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4734","title":"Marchant v.

Â Husband further indicated the company was paying rent\r\n  temporarily on a property located beside the business and allowing him and the\r\n  oldest child to live there in exchange for making improvements to the\r\n  property.Â  \r\nHusband argued Wife\r\n  was underemployed. Wife was not working at the time of the final hearing.Â  She\r\n  took the civil service exam after the parties separated, but did not pursue\r\n  employment based on the exam.Â  Wife earned a degree in journalism from the\r\n  University of South Carolina in 1986 and obtained her teaching certificate\r\n  shortly thereafter.Â  However, Wife never used her teaching certificate and was\r\n  primarily, by agreement of the parties, a stay-at-home mother.Â  She did work\r\n  intermittently for her father's law practice as a receptionist, in a daycare,\r\n  and at the produce business Husband started with his cousin.Â  Wife testified\r\n  she had been taking prerequisite courses at an area college and would enter the\r\n  two-year radiology program in the fall.Â  According to Wife, she would be\r\n  attending school full-time and students are discouraged from working outside of\r\n  their studies and clinical work.Â  The school would guarantee her placement, and\r\n  her projected income would be somewhere between $30,000 and $40,000. Â \r\nThe family court\r\n  did not impute income to Husband based on the loans from his employer and did\r\n  not treat Husband's employer-provided residence or vehicle as income except to\r\n  value the use of the company truck at $300 per month.Â  Additionally, the family\r\n  court imputed income to Wife in the amount of $1,732 per month.Â  Based on these\r\n  incomes, the family court ordered Husband to pay Wife $375 in alimony and $108\r\n  in child support per month.Â  The family court also ordered Husband to pay\r\n  $2,000 of Wife's $12,000 attorney's fees.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nstandard\r\n  of review\r\nWhile the appellate court may take its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence in family law issues, &quot;[q]uestions concerning alimony rest\r\n  within the sound discretion of the family court judge whose conclusion will not\r\n  be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  Degenhart v. Burriss,\r\n  360 S.C. 497, 500, 602 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Questions concerning\r\n  child support are likewise ordinarily committed to the discretion of the family\r\n  court.Â  Blackwell v. Fulgum, 375 S.C. 337, 347, 652 S.E.2d 427, 432 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007).Â  The family court also has discretion in determining attorney's\r\n  fees to be awarded.Â  Eason v. Eason, 384 S.C. 473, 481, 682 S.E.2d 804,\r\n  808 (2009).Â  \r\nI.&nbsp; Husband's Income\r\nWife\r\n  claims the family court erred in failing to find Husband was voluntarily\r\n  underemployed and impute income to him based upon loans, a truck, and a\r\n  residence provided by his employer.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhile\r\n  Wife alluded to the fact Husband was capable of earning more, she did not\r\n  request a finding that Husband was voluntarily underemployed.Â  The testimony\r\n  regarding his past income was elicited primarily to aid in establishing the\r\n  parties' standard of living during the marriage.Â  Furthermore, the family court\r\n  did not rule on this point.Â  Consequently, Wife was required to file a Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP, motion to seek a ruling on this point, and she failed to do so.Â \r\n  A point not raised to and ruled upon by the family court will not be considered\r\n  on appeal. Â Smith v. Smith, 386 S.C. 251, 273, 687 S.E.2d 669, 732 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2009); Feldman v. Feldman, 380 S.C. 538, 545, 670 S.E.2d 669, 672\r\n  (Ct. App. 2008) (finding issue of whether Wife's and Boyfriend's relationship\r\n  was tantamount to marriage not preserved for appellate review when issue was\r\n  not ruled upon and Husband failed to make a Rule 59(e) SCRCP, motion).\r\nWife also claims the family court erred in not including $27,000\r\n  from Husband's company and the use of a company car and home in Husband's\r\n  income.Â  Husband admitted to receiving pay advances or loans from his employer\r\n  to aid in his paying his child support and alimony obligations during the pendente\r\n    lite stage of this proceeding.Â  He testified there were no formal documents\r\n  associated with the loans but he was nevertheless obligated to repay them based\r\n  on a handshake deal with his partners.Â  The employer's records show when\r\n  advances were made and in what amount.Â  The family court believed Husband's\r\n  explanation for the additional funds, and we give deference to its findings on\r\n  credibility.Â  See Terwilliger v. Terwilliger, 298 S.C. 144, 147,\r\n  378 S.E.2d 609, 611 (Ct. App. 1989) (&quot;Resolving questions of credibility is a function of the\r\n  family court judge who heard the testimony.&quot;). Â Under these circumstances, we conclude the\r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion in failing to impute the loans to Husband\r\n  as income.\r\nWith respect to the allowance for a company truck, Husband\r\n  declared a benefit in the amount of $300 per month for use of the vehicle.Â  Declaring\r\n  the use of the company truck as income is appropriate in accordance with the\r\n  South Carolina Child Support Guidelines (the Guidelines).Â  &quot;[T]he court\r\n  should count as income expense reimbursements or in-kind payments received by a\r\n  parent from self-employment or operation of a business if they are significant\r\n  and reduce personal living expenses, such as a company car, free housing, or\r\n  reimbursed meals.&quot;Â  Mobley v. Mobley, 309 S.C. 134, 139, 420 S.E.2d\r\n  506, 510 (Ct. App. 1992) (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(3)(C) (Supp.\r\n  2009)).Â  \r\nThe payment for the vehicle is $596 per month, with the business\r\n  paying property taxes and insurance on the vehicle as well.Â  According to\r\n  Husband's testimony, the truck was not his property and was not solely for his\r\n  use.Â  However, it appears the truck was primarily for Husband's business and\r\n  personal use.Â  Nevertheless, at the conclusion of the term of the loan for the\r\n  truck, the truck will belong to the company, not Husband.Â  Additionally, while\r\n  Husband was the primary user of the truck, the truck was occasionally utilized\r\n  by the other members of the company.Â  Consequently, we find support in the\r\n  record for declaring a benefit to Husband less than the full amount of the\r\n  truck's monthly payment and therefore discern no abuse of discretion.\r\nConcerning his employer-provided housing, Husband's testimony\r\n  revealed he was occupying a rental property being paid for by the company and\r\n  was making improvements to the property while living there for six months.[3] Â The property was located next door\r\n  to the business and according to Husband would eventually be purchased by the\r\n  company.Â  Husband also testified he would start making monthly rental payments\r\n  of $800 the following month.Â  \r\nWhile this arrangement is somewhat suspect, questions of\r\n  credibility are left to the discretion of the family court.Â  See Terwilliger,\r\n  298 S.C. at 147, 378 S.E.2d at 611.Â  If this situation were to continue, an\r\n  analysis of whether it constitutes in-kind income would be required.Â  However, because\r\n  Husband testified he would begin paying rent, we again discern no abuse of\r\n  discretion in the family court's decision not to impute the provision of the\r\n  residence as income.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Wife's Income\r\nWife argues the family court erred in\r\n  imputing income to her based on a wage of ten dollars per hour and a forty-hour\r\n  work week.Â  We agree in part and modify the family court's award to reflect our\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence presented in the record.\r\n&quot;Whether termed voluntary\r\n  underemployment, imputation of income, or the failure to reach earning\r\n  potential, the case law is clear that when a payor spouse seeks to reduce\r\n  support obligations based on his diminished income, a court should consider the\r\n  payor spouse's earning capacity.&quot; Â Gartside v. Gartside, 383 S.C.\r\n  35, 44, 677 S.E.2d 621, 626 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  Likewise, it is proper to\r\n  consider a supported spouse's earning capacity and impute income to a spouse\r\n  who is underemployed or unemployed.Â  See Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C.\r\n  515, 532, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123 (2004) (affirming the family court's imputing\r\n  minimum wage income to Wife, who had been out of the workforce for twenty years\r\n  but was capable and energetic).Â  &quot;However, courts are reluctant to invade\r\n  a party's freedom to pursue the employment path of their own choosing or impose\r\n  unreasonable demands upon parties.&quot;Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C.\r\n  481, 489, 477 S.E.2d 727, 731 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Â &quot;Nonetheless, even\r\n  otherwise unreviewable career choices are at times outweighed by countervailing\r\n  considerations, particularly child support obligations.&quot; Â Id.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the evidence adduced at trial indicated Wife had worked sporadically\r\n  and infrequently during the marriage.Â  She had worked in her father's office,\r\n  as a day-care worker, and in her Husband's company, all for a brief time.Â  Wife\r\n  was by-and-large a stay-at-home mother as agreed upon by the parties.[4]Â \r\n  She had obtained her bachelor's degree in journalism and her teaching certificate\r\n  prior to the marriage but had never used it.Â  According to Husband's vocational\r\n  rehabilitation expert, Wife was capable of earning a gross income of around\r\n  $28,000 per year with minimal additional training if she were willing to work\r\n  in the field of education.[5]Â \r\n  However, Wife indicated she had no desire to teach and instead hoped to obtain\r\n  a degree in radiology, in which she would be guaranteed job placement.\r\nThe\r\n  family court did not impute income to Wife that would be the equivalent of a\r\n  teacher's salary, so that particular point is not before this court.Â  Instead,\r\n  the family court imputed a lower amount to mother of approximately four hundred\r\n  dollars per week.Â  This figure came from using a forty-hour work week and the ten\r\n  dollars per hour Wife earned while working at her father's law firm.Â  The\r\n  figures were based on the family court's determination that Wife had not\r\n  displayed a pattern indicating she would complete her radiology degree.\r\nWe believe the family court abused its\r\n  discretion in imputing this level of income to Wife.Â  According to the\r\n  Guidelines, &quot;[i]n order to impute income to a parent who is unemployed or\r\n  underemployed, the court should determine the employment potential and probable\r\n  earnings level of the parent based on that parent's recent work history,\r\n  occupational qualifications, and prevailing job opportunities and earning\r\n  levels in the community.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5)(B) (Supp.\r\n  2009).Â  The family court imputed\r\n  income to Wife based on a full-time job earning ten dollars per hour and at the\r\n  same time was encouraging Wife to complete her radiology program.Â  Wife had\r\n  custody of the parties' younger child and testified her radiology coursework\r\n  would require her to attend school full time.Â  Furthermore, Wife had no real\r\n  recent work experience and her prior employment had been primarily working for\r\n  family.Â  Considering Wife's parental and educational commitments and her lack\r\n  of recent work experience, the family court imputed too much income to Wife.Â  \r\nRecognizing Wife had shown a lack of initiative in finding\r\n  any employment, we affirm the family court's imputation of income based on a\r\n  forty-hour work week, but at the rate of $5.85 per hour, the minimum wage at\r\n  the time of the family court hearing.Â  This results in Wife having imputed income\r\n  of $1,014 per month.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Child Support/Children's\r\n  Health Expenses\r\nWife argues the family court's computation of child support was\r\n  erroneous in light of the pa rties' true incomes.Â  We agree.Â  Based on our\r\n  modification of Wife's income, we adjust Father's child support obligation to\r\n  $171 per month.Â  This figure is proper pursuant to the Guidelines substituting\r\n  Wife's new income of $1,014 in the calculation. \r\nIV.&nbsp; Alimony\r\nWife\r\n  contends the family court erred in awarding her only $375 per month in\r\n  alimony.Â  Again, based on our modification of Wife's income, we agree.\r\n\r\n\tSection\r\n  20-3-130(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) sets forth twelve factors which must be weighed when determining\r\n  alimony. In deciding whether to award alimony, the family court must consider:\r\n\t(1) the duration of the marriage and the\r\n  ages of the parties at the time of the marriage and at separation; (2) the\r\n  physical and emotional condition of each spouse; (3) the educational background\r\n  of each spouse and the need for additional education; (4) the employment\r\n  history and earning potential of each spouse; (5) the standard of living\r\n  established during the marriage; (6) the current and reasonably anticipated\r\n  income of each spouse; (7) the current and reasonably anticipated expenses of\r\n  each spouse; (8) the marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) the\r\n  custody of any children; (10) marital misconduct or fault; (11) the tax\r\n  consequences of the award; (12) the existence of support obligations to a\r\n  former spouse; and (13) such other factors the court considers relevant.\r\n\r\nSmith v. Smith, 386 S.C. 251, 265-66, 687 S.E.2d 720,\r\n  728 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  &quot;The\r\n  family court may weigh these factors as it deems appropriate.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  record illustrates the family court considered the relevant factors in awarding\r\n  alimony.Â  In fact, the family court weighed the factors and gave Wife\r\n  permanent, periodic alimony even though rehabilitative alimony, which was not\r\n  pled, was likely more appropriate.Â  The court noted the duration of the\r\n  marriage and that both parties were in good health and capable of contributing\r\n  to their own financial well-being.Â  The court recognized Wife had custody of\r\n  one child and Husband had custody of the other.Â  The parties had little or no marital\r\n  or non-martial property, and the court considered Husband's fault in the\r\n  break-up of the marriage.Â  That appears to be one of the primary reasons for\r\n  the award of permanent, periodic alimony.Â  The family court also considered the\r\n  parties' lifestyle during the marriage and noted they had always spent more\r\n  than they earned. Â \r\nEssentially,\r\n  the family court gave proper consideration to the various factors.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we find the family court abused its discretion only to the extent it based its\r\n  award on imputing to Wife income of $1,732 per month.Â  Because we have reduced\r\n  that amount, we believe she is entitled to an adjustment in her alimony award\r\n  so that Husband shall now pay Wife $500 per month.\r\nV.&nbsp; Attorney's Fees\r\nThe family court ordered Husband to pay $2,000 of Wife's $12,000\r\n  attorney's fees.Â  Wife argues on appeal the family court failed to make findings\r\n  with respect to each Glasscock[6] factor and abused its discretion in not awarding her more attorney's fees\r\n  because she does not have income to pay her fees.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;In determining whether [or not] to award attorney's fees,\r\n  the court should consider each party's ability to pay his or her own fees, the\r\n  beneficial results obtained by counsel, the parties' respective financial\r\n  conditions, and the effect of the fee on the\r\n  parties' standard of living.&quot; Â Eason v. Eason, 384 S.C. 473, 481-82, 682 S.E.2d 804,\r\n  808 (2009) (citing E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d\r\n  812, 816 (1992)).Â  In determining the amount of attorney's fees to award, the\r\n  court should consider the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services\r\n  rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case, counsel's professional\r\n  standing, the contingency of compensation, the beneficial results obtained, and\r\n  the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock, 304 S.C. at\r\n  161, 403 S.E.2d at 315.\r\nFirst, the family court's failure to include specific findings as\r\n  to each Glasscock factor does not require reversal of an attorney's fee\r\n  award, as long evidence in the record supports each factor.Â  See Townsend\r\n    v. Townsend, 323 S.C. 309, 318, 474 S.E.2d 424, 430 (1996).Â  In this case,\r\n  the record contains Wife's attorney's fees affidavit and itemization of costs.Â \r\n  While the affidavit could have been more specific, it does state that Wife's\r\n  counsel has always had a domestic law practice and one-hundred percent of her\r\n  work was in family law cases.Â  The affidavit further notes the court is aware\r\n  of the litigation and what has been required to handle the dispute between the\r\n  parties.Â  Furthermore, the affidavit contains the time spent on the matter and\r\n  the charge per hour.Â  The affidavit addresses counsel's standing, the fees for\r\n  such services, and the time devoted to the case.Â  The family court reviewed\r\n  this information and found the fees to be &quot;in the ballpark.&quot;Â  \r\nThe family court found Wife's attorney had obtained beneficial\r\n  results for her in getting the divorce on the grounds of adultery and securing\r\n  permanent, periodic alimony for Wife.Â  The court also remarked that neither\r\n  party was really in a position to pay their attorney's fees but that Husband\r\n  had a little more disposable income than Wife.Â  While we are modifying the\r\n  amount of income imputed to Wife, the adjustment is not so significant as to\r\n  warrant a change in the attorney's fees award in light of the totality of the\r\n  circumstances.Â  Accordingly, the family court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  failing to award Wife more attorney's fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude the family court did not abuse\r\n  its discretion in declining to impute additional income to Husband, and we find\r\n  the issue of Husband's voluntary underemployment is not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  With respect to Wife's income, we find the family court abused its\r\n  discretion in imputing monthly income of $1,732 to Wife, and we modify that amount\r\n  to $1,014.Â  Based on the alteration to Wife's income, we likewise modify\r\n  Husband's child support and alimony obligations to $171 per month and $500 per\r\n  month respectively, retroactive to the date of the family court's final order.Â \r\n  Finally, we affirm the family court's award of attorney's fees.Â  Accordingly\r\n  the judgment of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.\r\ngeathers and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Husband admits\r\n  not having sex with Wife by his choice during both pregnancies.Â  \r\n[2] Husband\r\n  testified Wife told him at the time they separated she would be going back to\r\n  work and he believed after that time his alimony obligation would cease.Â  \r\n[3] The\r\n  improvements were financed through loans or advances from the company, but\r\n  Husband was apparently responsible for overseeing the work.Â  \r\n[4] Husband\r\n  testified he had asked Wife to seek employment in the latter years of their\r\n  marriage.\r\n[5] Wife would need\r\n  to take six credit hours of classes and pass the Praxis examination to obtain a\r\n  current teaching certificate.Â  We also note that securing a teaching job in the\r\n  current economic climate with no experience is less than a certainty.\r\n[6] Glasscock v.

Crews, Inc.'s policy was invalid and remanded the matter\r\n  to the commission to order Liberty Mutual to begin paying benefits and\r\n  providing treatment to the claimant, William R. Crews.[1]Â \r\n  Liberty Mutual appeals.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nCrews\r\n  was in the business of installing handrails and performed installation work for\r\n  Architectural Railings and Grilles (ARG).Â  Initially, he operated as a sole\r\n  proprietorship and was insured under ARG's workers' compensation policy. Â Later,\r\n  ARG notified him that he would have to obtain his own workers' compensation\r\n  coverage.Â  As a result, Crews incorporated his business in 2003 and contacted\r\n  independent insurance agent Tim Loadholt of the Loadholt Agency to obtain\r\n  workers' compensation coverage.\r\nLoadholt\r\n  procured workers' compensation insurance for Crews through the Assigned Risk\r\n  Pool by submitting an application to the National Council on Compensation\r\n  Insurance (NCCI).[2]Â \r\n  Crews obtained financing from a premium financing company to pay for coverage. Â The\r\n  premium financing company paid the premiums in advance for the entire year and\r\n  then received installment payments from Crews.Â  Crews' coverage was assigned to\r\n  Liberty Mutual.\r\nLiberty\r\n  Mutual issued the policy using estimated payroll information provided by Crews\r\n  and Loadholt to compute the premiums.Â  Because neither Crews nor Liberty Mutual\r\n  would know the exact payroll exposure until the end of the policy term, the\r\n  premiums were estimates until the completion of an actual audit.Â  In order to\r\n  complete the audit, Liberty Mutual needed actual payroll and tax documentation\r\n  to verify the exposure.Â  The central issue in this appeal is Crews' alleged\r\n  noncompliance with Liberty Mutual's audit requests.\r\nOn\r\n  September 22, 2003, Liberty Mutual issued Crews a policy covering the period beginning\r\n  August 8, 2003, and ending August 8, 2004.Â  This policy will be identified here\r\n  as the &quot;013 Policy.&quot;[3]Â \r\n  On May 11, 2004, Liberty Mutual sent Crews and Loadholt a renewal quote for the\r\n  policy period beginning August 8, 2004, and ending August 8, 2005.Â  The renewal\r\n  quote related to a policy that would have been assigned a different number had\r\n  it been issued.Â  That policy will be referred to as the &quot;014\r\n  Policy.&quot;Â  \r\nOn\r\n  August 2, 2004, towards the end of the term of the 013 Policy, Liberty Mutual\r\n  sent Crews a mail form audit request in order to determine whether Crews owed\r\n  additional premium payments on this policy or was entitled to a refund of\r\n  estimated premiums he had already paid.Â  If the audit showed the actual premium\r\n  should have been higher than what was originally estimated, Crews' coverage was\r\n  still effective during the policy period; however, Liberty Mutual would be\r\n  entitled to an additional payment to cover the increased exposure.\r\nThe\r\n  quoted premium for the 014 Policy was due before coverage on that policy was\r\n  scheduled to begin.Â  Because Crews did not timely pay the premium, Liberty\r\n  Mutual did not issue the policy and voided the renewal quote. Â Crews paid the\r\n  quoted amount three days later.Â  As a result, Liberty Mutual issued a third\r\n  policy covering the period from August 11, 2004,f through August 11, 2005.Â \r\n  Like the 013 Policy, this policy, which was assigned a different number and\r\n  will be referred to as the &quot;024 Policy,&quot; was financed so that the\r\n  whole year's premium was paid in advance.\r\nLiberty\r\n  Mutual did not receive a response to the mail form audit request it sent Crews\r\n  on August 2, 2004, and sent another request on August 30, 2004.Â  Because Liberty\r\n  Mutual received no response to the follow-up request, on October 14, 2004, it\r\n  issued an estimated audit to Crews indicating neither party owed money to the\r\n  other but this determination was subject to revision once Crews sent the\r\n  requested information with proper tax documentation.Â  On the same day, Liberty\r\n  Mutual sent Crews a separate letter, advising that the 024 Policy &quot;has\r\n  been canceled&quot; effective November 18, 2004.Â  The letter further stated the\r\n  reason for the cancellation was &quot;non-compliance with plan rules,&quot;\r\n  explaining Crews failed to comply with auditing or loss prevention service\r\n  department requests.Â  The letter further advised in block letters the policy\r\n  would not be reinstated and suggested Crews submit another application to NCCI\r\n  for workers' compensation coverage.Â  In a deposition, Cindy Thiel, a senior\r\n  customer account representative with Liberty Mutual Involuntary Market\r\n  Operations, further clarified that the auditing request with which Crews\r\n  allegedly failed to comply concerned the 013 Policy.\r\nIn\r\n  response to a telephone call from Crews, Liberty sent an additional mail form\r\n  audit report to him on October 22, 2004.Â  This mailing was documented in a\r\n  timeline prepared by Thiel.Â  According to the the timeline, this form was for\r\n  the 013 Policy. Â The Loadholt Agency faxed the completed audit form to Liberty\r\n  Mutual on November 12, 2004; however, no supporting tax documentation was\r\n  included.\r\nOn\r\n  November 19, 2004,[4] Liberty Mutual sent a letter to Crews requesting tax documentation.Â  Contrary\r\n  to Liberty Mutual's assertion on appeal that the purpose of the request was to\r\n  do a final premium calculation for the 024 Policy, the letter contained the\r\n  following warning:Â  &quot;If the proper documentation is not sent along with\r\n  your mail audit your current policy may be canceled for non-compliance\r\n  with audit.&quot; (Emphasis added.)\r\nThe\r\n  Loadholt Agency alleged it faxed the requested documents to Liberty Mutual on\r\n  December 21, 2004; however, Liberty Mutual denied receiving the documents and\r\n  the only fax verification report in the record pertaining to that time\r\n  indicated that the transmission had failed.Â  Moreover, Thiel testified that on\r\n  December 8, 2004, Liberty Mutual sent another follow-up request on the 024\r\n  Policy and, on December 23, 2004, issued &quot;the final warning letter for the\r\n  024 term.&quot; Â On January 25, 2005, Liberty Mutual sent Crews an estimated\r\n  audit on the 024 Policy in which it advised that the policy was cancelled on\r\n  November 18, 2004, and that neither party owed anything to the other.Â  The\r\n  correspondence further advised that the calculations were subject to revision\r\n  when Crews submitted a report of actual amounts and proper tax documentation.Â  On\r\n  November 17, 2004, the NCCI received a notice that the 024 Policy had been\r\n  cancelled on October 21, 2004, and under applicable regulations, it would have\r\n  considered coverage cancelled thirty days after that date.[5]\r\nCrews suffered a\r\n  serious workplace injury on February 2, 2005.Â  Liberty Mutual acknowledged receiving\r\n  a fax containing the tax documents on the same day.Â  By letter dated February\r\n  4, 2005, however, Liberty Mutual advised Crews it was denying his claim for\r\n  benefits because his workers' compensation policy had been cancelled effective\r\n  November 18, 2004.Â  On February 14, 2005, Liberty Mutual issued a revised audit\r\n  bill, showing that based on the documents he submitted the day of his accident,\r\n  Crews owed an additional $1,347 on the 013 Policy and would receive an invoice\r\n  for this amount under separate cover.\r\nCrews filed a Form\r\n  50 on December 20, 2005.Â  The single commissioner heard the matter on July 27,\r\n  2006, and by order dated April 10, 2007, upheld Liberty Mutual's cancellation\r\n  of the 024 Policy for &quot;[Crews'] lack of substantial compliance with\r\n  reasonable audit requirements for the 013 policy.&quot;Â  In addition, the\r\n  single commissioner found although ARG was Crews' statutory employer, it had\r\n  relied in good faith on what it believed to be a valid Certificate of Insurance\r\n  and, based on this finding, allowed its carrier to transfer liability to the Uninsured\r\n  Employers' Fund (the Fund).\r\nIn a\r\n  divided decision, the appellate panel affirmed the single commissioner.[6]Â \r\n  Pursuant to a petition for judicial review filed by Crews, the circuit court\r\n  issued an order on May 8, 2008, reversing the appellate panel's order and\r\n  remanding the matter to the commission with instructions to find that Liberty\r\n  Mutual was responsible for paying Crews' workers' compensation benefits.Â  The\r\n  court further determined Liberty Mutual's cancellation of the 024 Policy was\r\n  invalid based on the following findings:Â  (1) none of the circumstances under\r\n  which the assigned risk plan allows cancellation of a policy was present in\r\n  this case, (2) Crews complied to the best of his ability with Liberty's Mutual's\r\n  audit procedures, and (3) any breach by Crews affected only the 013 Policy and\r\n  not the 024 Policy.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\nI.&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in holding\r\n  Liberty Mutual could not cancel the 024 Policy based on Crews' alleged\r\n  noncompliance with an audit request on the 013 Policy?\r\nII.&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in\r\n  finding Crews substantially complied with Liberty Mutual's audit requirements?\r\nIII.&nbsp; Did the circuit court err in\r\n  failing to uphold the appellate panel's findings that Liberty Mutual provided\r\n  Crews sufficient notice that the policy was to be cancelled and reason for\r\n  cancellation of the policy?\r\nIV.&nbsp; Was the purported cancellation\r\n  ineffective because of Liberty Mutual's alleged failure to return any unearned\r\n  premium to Crews?\r\nV.&nbsp; Should Liberty Mutual be estopped\r\n  from denying coverage?\r\nVI.&nbsp; Should ARG be allowed to transfer\r\n  liability to the Fund?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  an appeal from the workers' compensation commission, &quot;neither this Court\r\n  nor the circuit court may substitute its judgment for that of the Commission as\r\n  to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but it may reverse when the\r\n  decision is affected by an error of law.&quot;Â  Hopper v. Terry Hunt Constr.,\r\n  373 S.C. 475, 479, 646 S.E.2d 163, 164 (Ct. App. 2007), aff'd, 386 S.C.\r\n  310, 680 S.E.2d 1 (2009); see also Grant v. Grant Textiles, 372\r\n  S.C. 196, 201, 641 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2007) (stating appellate review of a\r\n  workers' compensation decision &quot;is limited to deciding whether the\r\n  commission's decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled\r\n  by some error of law&quot;).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp; Cancellation of the 024\r\n  Policy\r\nLiberty\r\n  Mutual argues the appellate panel correctly found it properly cancelled the 024\r\n  Policy, noting that the policy expressly advised as follows: &quot;If requested\r\n  information is not made available in a timely fashion, your premium will be\r\n  estimated and your policy may be canceled.&quot;Â  It further cites provisions\r\n  in the policy under which insureds are required to &quot;keep records of\r\n  information needed to compute premium&quot; and &quot;will provide us with\r\n  copies of those records when we ask for them.&quot; Â Liberty Mutual points to a\r\n  provision in the Assigned Risk Plan under which an employer's failure to comply\r\n  with reasonable audit requirements is a ground for cancellation of a workers'\r\n  compensation policy.Â  Finally, Liberty Mutual contends the circuit court\r\n  improperly decided the matter as a question of law when it should have focused\r\n  on whether substantial evidence supported the appellate panel's finding that\r\n  cancellation was proper.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  the circuit court noted, both Loadholt and Thiel testified that Crews was in\r\n  full compliance with the policy requirements of the 024 Policy.Â  Although Thiel\r\n  asserted the plan rules in the NCCI manual required Liberty Mutual to cancel\r\n  any current policy due to noncompliance with an audit request for a prior\r\n  policy, we found no rules with this precise language in the record.Â  Moreover,\r\n  as the circuit court noted:Â  &quot;There is no provision of the Plan requiring\r\n  or allowing cancellation of a current policy due to an alleged failure to\r\n  comply with the requirements of a previous policy, Policy 013 in this\r\n  case.&quot; Â We believe the circuit court's interpretation of the Assigned Risk\r\n  Plan is correct as a matter of law, and based on this interpretation, the\r\n  court's reversal of the appellate panel's order was proper.\r\nThe\r\n  Assigned Risk Plan specifies five circumstances allowing a carrier to cancel an\r\n  insurance policy: (1) the employer is not in good faith entitled to workers'\r\n  compensation coverage, (2) the employer has failed to comply with reasonable\r\n  health, safety, or audit and loss prevention requirements, (3) the employer has\r\n  violated one or more of the terms under which the insurance was issued, (4) the\r\n  employer refuses to allow the assigned carrier reasonable access to its\r\n  facilities or its files and records for audit or inspection, and (5) the\r\n  employer refuses to disclose to the assigned carrier the full nature and scope\r\n  of the assigned carrier's exposure.Â  The only circumstance applicable here was\r\n  Crews' alleged failure to comply with reasonable audit requirements.Â  We hold\r\n  that under the terms of both the 024 Policy and the Assigned Risk Plan, Crews'\r\n  alleged noncompliance with an audit request for the 013 Policy does not\r\n  constitute a failure to comply with a &quot;reasonable&quot; audit request for\r\n  the 024 Policy.\r\nAs\r\n  to audit requirements, the Plan requires carriers &quot;to complete a final\r\n  audit and to bill for any additional premium or refund any excess premium paid\r\n  during the policy year.&quot;Â  The wording of this provision indicates that\r\n  settlement of any discrepancies between the amount paid by an insured for the\r\n  policy period and the amount owing for the corresponding term is to be handled\r\n  directly between the carrier and the insured, without adjustments to any\r\n  subsequent policies between them.Â  That is exactly what happened here; once\r\n  Liberty Mutual completed the final audit on the 013 Policy, it advised Crews it\r\n  would be sending him an invoice for the surcharge.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  contrary to Liberty Mutual's contention that &quot;NCCI rules speak to coverage\r\n  under the plan and do not differentiate between separate policies,&quot; the\r\n  payroll audit provision of the plan provides that &quot;[f]ailure by the\r\n  employer to allow a preliminary or final audit will result in the cancellation\r\n  of the policy for noncompliance with policy terms and conditions.&quot;Â \r\n  Here, the audit pertained to the 013 Policy; thus, any noncompliance on Crews'\r\n  part would affect only his coverage under that policy.\r\nAs\r\n  support for its position, Liberty Mutual cites Budget Premium Co. v.\r\n    American Casualty Co., 483 N.E.2d 389, 391 (Ill. App. 3d Dist. 1985), for\r\n  the proposition that &quot;[s]uccessive policies issued by the same insurer to\r\n  the same insured, for the same or similar coverage are considered renewal\r\n  policies.&quot;Â  The quoted passage, however, is from a section of the Illinois\r\n  Code.Â  We have not found, nor has Liberty Mutual directed to our attention, any\r\n  analogous statute in the South Carolina Code.Â  Moreover, case law from our\r\n  jurisdiction suggests otherwise.Â  See Webb v. S.C. Ins. Co., 305\r\n  S.C. 211, 213, 407 S.E.2d 635, 636 (1991) (holding a policy renewal is a new\r\n  contract &quot;unless (1) the expiring policy mandates the same terms shall\r\n  remain in effect and (2) the terms of the policy do not change upon\r\n  renewal&quot;).Â  In the present case, Thiel herself admitted Crews was in\r\n  compliance with the terms of the 024 Policy when it was cancelled by Liberty\r\n  Mutual and agreed the 024 Policy was a separate policy from the 013 Policy.Â  We\r\n  therefore agree with the circuit court that Crews' alleged noncompliance with\r\n  an audit request to determine what he owed on the 013 Policy was not a valid\r\n  reason for Liberty Mutual to cancel the 024 Policy.\r\nII.&nbsp; Substantial Compliance\r\nAs\r\n  an additional ground for reversing the appellate panel's decision, the circuit\r\n  court noted Crews had complied to the best of his ability with Liberty Mutual's\r\n  audit request.Â  In response, Liberty Mutual contends Crews' compliance efforts\r\n  were insufficient because of provisions in the Assigned Risk Plan that\r\n  purportedly prohibit reinstatement of coverage if an item correcting a\r\n  deficiency is received more than sixty days from the date of cancellation.Â \r\n  Based on this argument, Liberty Mutual asserts its receipt of the tax\r\n  documentation the same day Crews was injured did not warrant reinstatement of\r\n  his coverage.Â  We disagree with Liberty Mutual's position that Crews'\r\n  compliance efforts were insufficient.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court has recognized that although none of the provisions\r\n  of the Assigned Risk Plan have been promulgated as regulations, the Plan\r\n  &quot;has the force of law&quot; because it has been approved by the Director\r\n  of the Department of Insurance.Â  Avant v. Willowglen Acad., 367 S.C.\r\n  315, 318-19, 626 S.E.2d 797, 799 (2006).Â  Furthermore, because the focus of the\r\n  Plan is on assigned risk insurance, its provisions prevail over workers'\r\n  compensation regulations, which address workers' compensation generally.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  Assigned Risk Plan allows a carrier to initiate cancellation procedures if it\r\n  determines one of the five conditions enumerated above exists; however, Plan\r\n  rules specify the carrier must first provide an opportunity to cure.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the Plan requires a servicing carrier &quot;[t]o work with and assist the . . .\r\n  employer . . . on problems relating to coverage and service under the\r\n  Plan.&quot;Â  It follows that a carrier is to adopt a flexible approach when\r\n  dealing with an insured who is unable to strictly comply with the policy terms\r\n  but is making reasonable efforts to do so.\r\nTo\r\n  determine whether Crews substantially complied with the audit request, the\r\n  critical time period is the interval between August 2, 2004, when Liberty\r\n  Mutual issued its initial mail form audit request for the 013 Policy, and\r\n  November 18, 2004, the date the 024 Policy was scheduled to be cancelled.Â  During\r\n  that interval, Crews had not yet filed his 2003 tax returns for his business;\r\n  therefore, he was unable to send the tax documentation that Liberty Mutual\r\n  requested. Â Nevertheless, he completed and returned the audit form several days\r\n  before the scheduled cancellation.Â  Only after Liberty Mutual cancelled the 024\r\n  Policy did it notify him additional documents were necessary.Â  Because Liberty\r\n  Mutual had time to notify Crews before the scheduled cancellation that he\r\n  needed to provide additional information but failed to give such notice until\r\n  after it cancelled the 024 Policy, we agree with the circuit court that Liberty\r\n  Mutual did not act reasonably in providing an opportunity for cure, as it was\r\n  required to do under the terms of the Assigned Risk Plan.Â  Furthermore, as the\r\n  circuit court noted, Liberty Mutual advised Loadholt the cancellation would\r\n  stand even if the fax transmission of the tax documents had been successful.Â \r\n  This finding is consistent with Liberty Mutual's position that its reason for\r\n  sending a request on November 19, 2004, for tax documentation was for a final\r\n  audit of the now-cancelled 024 Policy rather than for purposes of reinstating\r\n  it.[7]Â  \r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp; Notice of Cancellation\r\nLiberty\r\n  Mutual next argues the record has substantial evidence supporting the appellate\r\n  panel's finding that it gave the statutorily required notice to Crews. Â Assuming\r\n  without deciding that this argument is correct, we hold it is not a reason to\r\n  reverse the circuit court's decision.\r\nUnder\r\n  section 38-75-730(c) of the South Carolina Code (2002 &amp; Supp. 2009), an\r\n  insurer may cancel a policy &quot;for any reason by furnishing to the insured\r\n  at least thirty days' written notice of cancellation, except where the reason\r\n  for cancellation is nonpayment of premium, in which case not less than ten\r\n  days' written notice must be furnished.&quot;Â  This provision, however, must be\r\n  read in conjunction with the portions of the Assigned Risk Plan concerning when\r\n  and how an assigned risk carrier may cancel a policy.Â  We have already\r\n  concluded (1) the circuit court correctly ruled Liberty Mutual could not cancel\r\n  Crews' current policy because of his alleged noncompliance with audit requests\r\n  for his former policy and (2) in the alternative, Liberty Mutual did not comply\r\n  with Plan requirements that it provide Crews an opportunity to cure the deficiencies\r\n  in the information he sent at its request.Â  It follows, then, that because\r\n  Liberty Mutual's cancellation of Crews' insurance policy was not permitted\r\n  under the Assigned Risk Plan, its compliance with statutory notice requirements\r\n  about the cancellation is of no effect.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Failure to Return Unearned Premiums\r\nLiberty\r\n  Mutual next argues the circuit court should have upheld the finding by the\r\n  single commissioner and the appellate panel that its failure to return unearned\r\n  premiums to Crews did not render its cancellation of Crews' workers'\r\n  compensation policy ineffective.Â  The issue of whether Liberty Mutual should\r\n  have returned unearned premiums to Crews to effect cancellation of his\r\n  insurance policy does not affect our prior determination that Liberty Mutual\r\n  could not cancel the 024 Policy because of Crews' failure to provide\r\n  information for the 013 Policy.Â  Likewise, the issue of unearned premiums would\r\n  have no impact on our ruling that Crews was entitled to an opportunity to cure\r\n  any deficiencies in his response to the audit requests before his policy could\r\n  be cancelled.Â  Because these two reasons are sufficient to uphold the circuit\r\n  court's decision to reverse the appellate panel's order, we decline to address\r\n  the arguments concerning the obligation of an insurer under the Assigned Risk\r\n  Plan to return unearned premiums to an insured following the cancellation of a\r\n  policy.Â  See Weeks v. McMillan, 291 S.C. 287, 292, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  289, 292 (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;Where a decision is based on alternative\r\n  grounds, either of which independent of the other is sufficient to support it,\r\n  the decision will not be reversed even if one of the grounds is\r\n  erroneous.&quot;).\r\nV.&nbsp; Estoppel\r\nLiberty\r\n  Mutual further argues it should not be estopped from denying coverage.Â  In the\r\n  appealed order, the circuit court noted that estoppel was one of the questions\r\n  presented in Crews' petition for judicial review; however, based on the court's\r\n  decision that Liberty Mutual's cancellation of the 024 Policy was invalid for\r\n  other reasons, it declined to rule on this issue.Â  We likewise hold it is\r\n  unnecessary in this appeal to address the question of whether the doctrine of\r\n  estoppel should prevent Liberty Mutual from denying coverage for Crews'\r\n  injury.Â  See Futch\r\n    v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n  591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not address remaining issues\r\n  when a decision on a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nVI.&nbsp; Transfer of Liability from ARG\r\n  to the Fund\r\nFinally,\r\n  the Fund contends that, in the event this court holds in favor of Liberty\r\n  Mutual, we should reverse the appellate panel's decision to allow ARG to\r\n  transfer its own liability to the Fund. Â Because we have upheld the circuit\r\n  court's decision that Liberty Mutual's cancellation of the policy was invalid,\r\n  we need not address this argument.Â  See Colleton County Taxpayers\r\n    Ass'n v. Sch. Dist. Of Colleton County, 371 S.C. 224, 242, 638 S.E.2d 685,\r\n  694 (2006) (&quot;[A]n issue that is contingent, hypothetical, or abstract is\r\n  not ripe for judicial review.&quot;); Hitter v. McLeod, 274 S.C. 616,\r\n  619, 266 S.E.2d 418, 420 (1980) (declining to rule on an issue that was not\r\n  ripe for adjudication and noting it &quot;presents [the court] with nothing\r\n  more than a vehicle for rendering an advisory opinion&quot;).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the\r\n  circuit court's ruling Liberty Mutual is the liable party for workers'\r\n  compensation benefits in this case; however, our holding is based solely on our\r\n  determinations that Liberty Mutual could not cancel Crews' current policy\r\n  because of auditing difficulties with his prior policy and that Liberty Mutual\r\n  could not cancel either policy without giving Crews a reasonable opportunity to\r\n  cure any alleged noncompliance.Â  Because neither ARG nor the Fund would be\r\n  responsible for paying workers' compensation benefits in this case, we decline\r\n  to address the Fund's argument that it should not have been required to assume\r\n  liability in the first instance.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â For purposes of this appeal, the interests of W.R.\r\n  Crews, Inc., and William R. Crews are essentially the same; therefore, the name\r\n  &quot;Crews&quot; will refer interchangeably to either party or to both parties\r\n  collectively.\r\n[2]Â  An &quot;assigned risk pool&quot; is a group of\r\n  servicing carriers who enter into an assigned risk agreement &quot;with respect\r\n  to the equitable apportionment among them of insurance which may be afforded to\r\n  applicants who are in good faith entitled to, but who are unable to procure,\r\n  insurance through ordinary methods.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-73-540(A)(1)\r\n  (2002).Â  In 2000, the NCCI filed the South Carolina Workers Compensation\r\n  Assigned Risk Plan with the South Carolina Department of Insurance, which has\r\n  adopted and followed the Plan.Â  Rodriguez v. Romero, 363 S.C. 80, 85,\r\n  610 S.E.2d 488, 490 (2005).\r\n[3]Â  The policies discussed are identified by the last\r\n  three digits of the corresponding policy numbers.\r\n[4]Â  As noted earlier, Liberty Mutual had already advised\r\n  Crews in its October 14, 2004 correspondence it intended to cancel his 024 Policy\r\n  effective November 18, 2004.\r\n[5]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-406(F)(2) (1990)\r\n  (&quot;Insurance expiration, termination or cancellation shall not be effective\r\n  until after thirty days from the date of receipt by NCCI of the NCCI [Policy\r\n  Termination/Cancellation/Reinstatement Notice]&quot;).\r\n[6]Â  One member of the appellate panel stated she would\r\n  reverse the transfer of liability to the Fund on the ground that ARG's carrier\r\n  should pay in the first instance before liability could be transferred.\r\n[7]Â  Moreover, if in fact Liberty Mutual's only reason\r\n  for its November 19, 2004 correspondence was to gather information for a final\r\n  audit of the 024 Policy rather than to give Crews another chance to remedy the\r\n  deficiency in the information so that his coverage could be reinstated, Liberty\r\n  Mutual arguably would have violated the Assigned Risk Plan.Â  Under the Plan\r\n  provisions, &quot;[i]f an item correcting a fault which resulted in\r\n  cancellation is received on or within sixty (60) days after the\r\n  effective date of cancellation, the carrier shall reinstate insurance\r\n  with a lapse in coverage . . . .&quot;Â  (Second emphasis added.)\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4736","title":"Holst v.

Â Swan was transferring containers from a container pad\r\n  onto trucks for transport.[1]Â \r\n  Holst instructed Swan to move all of the containers in stacks two, three, and\r\n  four of the pad.Â  After Swan moved all of the containers out of stack two, he\r\n  picked up the four containers from stack one and lowered them into stack two. Â Holst\r\n  was standing in stack two and was crushed to death by the containers.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSwan testified he was unaware\r\n  Holst was in the second stack when he grounded the containers from stack one. Â He\r\n  further testified he did not have visibility of the ground in stack two from\r\n  the operator's cab of the crane. Â Â Swan stated that while Holst did not\r\n  instruct him to move the containers from stack one into stack two, it was\r\n  protocol and a safety procedure to move the four containers out of stack one. Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe crane was designed and\r\n  manufactured by KCI Konecranes VLC Corporation, a Finnish company, and was\r\n  purchased by the SCSPA in 1997.Â  The crane was built according to the SCSPA's\r\n  specifications and shipped to Charleston for erection.Â  The SCSPA maintained\r\n  the crane, and it was inspected by an independent consulting firm during its\r\n  operation. Â The crane's operator's cab was designed to have as much glass as\r\n  possible to increase visibility for the crane operator.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn February 18, 2005, Jean Holst,\r\n  individually and as personal representative of the Estate of William Edward\r\n  Holst, Jr., filed suit alleging negligence, breach of warranty, and strict\r\n  liability for defective design against KCI.[2]Â \r\n  On May 8, 2008, KCI filed a motion for summary judgment. Â KCI asserted there\r\n  were no genuine issues of material fact as to the claimed defective and\r\n  unreasonably dangerous condition of the crane.Â  KCI also asserted additional\r\n  grounds for summary judgment including comparative negligence and assumption of\r\n  the risk. Â Holst maintained the crane was defectively designed because of\r\n  visibility limitations from the operator's cab.Â  Furthermore, Holst proposed mounting\r\n  a closed-circuit video camera on the edge of the crane's trolley as a feasible\r\n  design alternative to increase the operator's visibility.Â  Holst also argued\r\n  KCI failed to warn crane users about the crane's sight limitations.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe circuit court granted summary\r\n  judgment, and determined Holst's defective design and failure to warn claims\r\n  failed as a matter of law. Â The circuit court found there was no competent\r\n  evidence the crane was negligently designed or that the crane's design did not\r\n  meet consumer expectation or social utility tests.Â  Furthermore, the circuit\r\n  court concluded that Holst failed to present competent evidence that the\r\n  warnings supplied by KCI were inadequate. The circuit court also noted Holst's\r\n  proposed alternative design was not mandated, was not used on any rubber-tired\r\n  gantry (RTG) crane operating in the world, and its absence did not make the\r\n  crane unreasonably dangerous for its intended use.The circuit court did not address KCI's additional\r\n  grounds for summary judgment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary\r\n  judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard of review as the\r\n  trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Companion Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v.\r\n  Airborne Exp., Inc., 369 S.C. 388, 390, 631 S.E.2d 915, 916 (Ct. App. 2006).Â \r\n  &quot;Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of\r\n  material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&quot;\r\n  Â Â Wilson v. Moseley, 327 S.C. 144, 146, 488 S.E.2d 862, 865\r\n  (1997). Â In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the evidence and all\r\n  inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light\r\n  most favorable to the non-moving party. Â Id.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n  I.&nbsp; Weighing the Evidence\r\n  Holst argues the circuit court erred in\r\n    weighing the evidence instead of finding that material questions of fact\r\n    existed.Â  Specifically, Holst maintains the circuit court improperly weighed\r\n    conflicting testimony (1) as to whether the crane was defective and\r\n    unreasonably dangerous, (2) as to whether the crane complied with applicable\r\n    standards, and (3) comparing the crane to other cranes on the market. Â We\r\n    disagree.Â  \r\n  A.&nbsp; Expert Testimony\r\n  In a product liability action under both negligence\r\n    and strict liability theories, the plaintiff must establish &quot;(1) that he\r\n    was injured by the product; (2) that the product, at the time of the accident,\r\n    was in essentially the same condition as when it left the hands of the\r\n    defendant; and (3) that the injury occurred because the product was in a\r\n    defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user.&quot;Â  Allen v. Long\r\n      Mfg. NC, Inc., 332 S.C. 422, 426, 505 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Furthermore,\r\n    &quot;to survive summary judgment, it is crucial that a plaintiff also\r\n    demonstrate that a feasible, or workable, design alternative exists under the\r\n    circumstances.&quot; Disher v. Synthes (U.S.A.), 371 F. Supp. 2d 764,\r\n    771 (D.S.C. 2005).Â  &quot;In determining whether an alternative design is\r\n    practical or feasible, courts will look to see whether a risk-utility analysis\r\n    has been conducted to weigh the benefits of any new design against the costs\r\n    and potentially adverse consequences of the design.&quot; Â Id. at\r\n    771-72.\r\n  In support of her allegation that the\r\n    crane was defectively designed, Holst relied on the opinions of two engineering\r\n    experts.Â  Dr. George Pearsall testified the crane was &quot;unreasonably\r\n    dangerous because the operator did not have an obstruction free visibility to\r\n    see if anyone was below the load block even shortly before he dropped the\r\n    load.&quot;Â  Richard Leonard testified crane operators should have sight of the\r\n    areas they are working over, and that it was feasible to mount a closed-circuit\r\n    video camera on the crane's trolley to improve visibility. Â Furthermore, Pearsall\r\n    concluded that if the crane had been equipped with a camera it would have been\r\n    &quot;much more likely that the operator would have seen Mr. Holst there and\r\n    certainly would not have dropped the container on him.&quot;Â  While Pearsall\r\n    and Leonard both concluded that video cameras would increase visibility from\r\n    the operator's cab, they conceded cameras would not eliminate the crane's blind\r\n    spot. Â Pearsall and Leonard also admitted they knew of no other\r\n    manufacturers that installed cameras on RTG crane trolleys, and they agreed the\r\n    crane met industry standards and regulations. Â Leonard also testified he had\r\n    never seen an RTG crane operator's cab with greater visibility than the crane's\r\n    cab. Â \r\n  We find the testimony offered by Holst's\r\n    experts was not sufficient to prove the crane was defective and unreasonably\r\n    dangerous.Â  Neither Pearsall nor Leonard conducted a risk-utility analysis\r\n    regarding their proposed design alternative. Â Not only did Pearsall and Leonard\r\n    testify the proposed camera design would not eliminate the blind spot, they\r\n    also failed to weigh the benefits of installing cameras against the costs and\r\n    potentially adverse consequences. Â Moreover, Arun Bhimani and Allen Palmer, KCI's\r\n    engineering experts, concluded the presence of video camera monitors in the crane\r\n    operator's cab could distract operators and create a hazard.Â  Because Holst\r\n    failed to produce evidence of a feasible design alternative or that a\r\n    risk-utility analysis was conducted, she cannot establish the crane was\r\n    defective and unreasonably dangerous as a matter of law.Â  \r\n  B.&nbsp; Applicable Standards\r\n  Holst contends the circuit court\r\n    improperly weighed evidence when it determined KCI complied with the American\r\n    Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) B30.2-1.5.1(b) standard.Â  ASME B30.2-1.5.1(b)\r\n    provides:\r\n  \r\n\tThe arrangement of the cab should allow the operator a\r\n  full view of the load block in all positions.Â  This is an important and\r\n  desirable condition, but it is recognized that there are physical arrangements\r\n  that may make this impossible, and, when the load block is in these positions,\r\n  the operator shall be aided by other means such as, but not limited to,\r\n  closed-circuit TV, mirrors, radio, telephone or a signalperson.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe circuit court determined\r\n  KCI complied with this standard, and noted the crane's operator's cab was\r\n  surrounded in glass and positioned below steel structures to give the operator\r\n  an enhanced view. Â Furthermore, the circuit court found the operator had a full\r\n  view of the load block in all positions.[3] Â Â The circuit court noted that even assuming the load block was not visible, at\r\n  least three other means were provided to aid the operator. Â Swan had access to\r\n  a telephone, an intercom with a loudspeaker, and a two-way radio.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHolst also argues the crane\r\n  did not comply with International Organization for Standardization (ISO)\r\n  standards. Â Section 8566-1 of the ISO requires that crane operator cabs\r\n  have &quot;maximum visibility consistent with structural requirements and\r\n  operational safety.&quot; Additionally, the ISO standards require cabs be\r\n  &quot;placed and the size and the location of the window openings so chosen as\r\n  to allow the driver supervision of loading and of loads transfer operations\r\n  from his seat.Â  For some cranes this may necessitate provisions for moving or\r\n  rotating the cab or other means.&quot;Â  Â Here, while a blind spot\r\n  prevented the crane operator from seeing the ground while lowering the\r\n  containers, the operator had &quot;other means&quot; which allowed him to\r\n  supervise the loading and transfer. Â The crane was equipped with a two-way\r\n  radio, telephone, and intercom which allowed Swan to communicate with Holst.Â  Thus,\r\n  the circuit court did not err in finding KCI complied with applicable safety\r\n  standards.Â \r\n  \r\n  C.&nbsp; Other Cranes on the Market\r\n  \r\nFinally, Holst maintains the\r\n  circuit court erred in improperly weighing the testimony comparing the crane to\r\n  other cranes on the market.Â  The circuit court determined &quot;the\r\n  uncontradicted testimony is that no crane on the market had better visibility\r\n  from the operator's cab&quot; than KCI's crane. Holst maintains Mi-Jack,\r\n  another RTG crane manufacturer, produces a crane with a &quot;variable\r\n  elevating cabin&quot; that moves up and down along the side of the crane\r\n  instead of left and right on the trolley at the top of the crane. Â Holst notes Palmer\r\n  testified that &quot;in limited conditions&quot; an operator in a cab that\r\n  could move up and down &quot;may have better visibility&quot; than the operator\r\n  of a cab that is fixed at the top of the trolley.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLeonard testified he had never\r\n  seen an RTG operator's cab with greater visibility than the crane's cab.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Holst failed to present evidence of how the Mi-Jack design would prove the\r\n  design of the crane was defective. While Palmer testified the Mi-Jack crane\r\n  &quot;may have better visibility&quot; in certain circumstances, the record\r\n  does not contain any evidence that the Mi-Jack design eliminated the crane's blind\r\n  spot. Â Moreover, Holst failed to provide evidence the Mi-Jack crane was similar\r\n  enough to the crane to warrant a comparison.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit\r\n  court did not improperly weigh testimony in determining the evidence in the\r\n  record was insufficient to sustain Holst's claim that the crane was defective\r\n  and unreasonably dangerous.Â \r\n  \r\n  II.&nbsp; Industry Custom\r\n  Holst argues the circuit court erred in applying the\r\n    wrong legal standard regarding industry custom in negligence and strict\r\n    liability tort cases.Â  Specifically, Holst alleges the circuit court based its\r\n    grant of summary judgment on the crane's conformity with industry custom. Â We\r\n    disagree.Â  \r\n  The circuit court found a determination of\r\n    whether or not a product was defective and unreasonably dangerous involved \r\n  \r\n\ta\r\n    balancing act to consider whether (1) the product sold must be dangerous to an\r\n    extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary user who\r\n    purchases it (&quot;consumer expectation test&quot;) and (2) the danger\r\n    associated with the use of the product outweighs the utility of the product\r\n    (&quot;social utility test&quot;).\r\n\r\n  (citing Bray v. Marathon Corp., 356 S.C. 111,\r\n    588 S.E.2d 93 (2003); Bragg, 319 S.C. at 544, 462 S.E.2d at 329). Â In\r\n    its application of these tests, the circuit court considered industry standards\r\n    and practices, the warnings provided by KCI, the operator cab's design compared\r\n    to other cranes on the market, and the feasibility and utility of installing video\r\n    cameras on the crane.Â  \r\n  While the circuit court considered industry\r\n    custom in determining Holst failed to produce competent evidence that the crane\r\n    was defective and unreasonably dangerous, it was only one factor considered by\r\n    the court.Â  Because this court has given weight to conformity with industry\r\n    custom, we find the circuit court did not err in considering conformity with\r\n    industry custom as one factor in its analysis.Â  See Bragg, 319\r\n    S.C. at 544, 462 S.E.2d at 329 (&quot;While conformity with industry practice\r\n    is not conclusive of the product's safety, the cases where a member of industry\r\n    will be held liable for failing to do what no one in his position has ever done\r\n    before will be infrequent.&quot;). \r\n  III.&nbsp; Court Cases\r\n  Holst argues the circuit court erred in\r\n    applying inapplicable legal standards from Bell Helmets, 926 F.2d 331, Mitchell\r\n      Distributing Co., 270 S.C. 29, 240 S.E.2d 511, and Bragg, 319 S.C.\r\n    531, 464 S.E.2d 321.Â  We disagree.\r\n  In Bell Helmets, the Fourth Circuit\r\n    Court of Appeals held the testimony of the plaintiff's expert in a Kentucky\r\n    products liability case did not establish a defect, and therefore, the expert's\r\n    testimony should not have been considered by the jury. Â 926 F.2d at 338. Â The\r\n    expert in Bell Helmets proposed a design alternative for the subject\r\n    helmet that would accommodate high and low impact accidents. Â Id. at\r\n    335. Â In making its ruling, the Fourth Circuit considered evidence that no\r\n    other manufacturer in the industry had designed or manufactured a helmet like\r\n    the expert's prototype helmet, and that the subject helmet conformed to\r\n    industry standards. Â Id. at 333, 335. Â Holst argues the circuit court\r\n    erred in relying on Bell Helmets because of Kentucky's rebuttable\r\n    presumption statute. Â We disagree.Â  The rebuttable presumption statute was not\r\n    considered by the Fourth Circuit in its determination that the expert's\r\n    testimony was insufficient for submission to the jury.Â  In fact, the Fourth\r\n    Circuit expressed its &quot;puzzlement&quot; over the need for a statute, and\r\n    found the lower court did not err in failing to submit the statute to the jury\r\n    because a defendant always carries a presumption in his favor when the burden\r\n    of proof is placed on the plaintiff.Â  Id. at 333.Â  \r\n  \r\nHolst also contends the circuit court erred\r\n  in relying on Mitchell.Â  In Mitchell, our supreme court affirmed\r\n  the lower court's grant of summary judgment in favor of a crane's distributor on\r\n  the basis that the subject crane was not defective.Â  270 S.C. at 35-36, 240\r\n  S.E.2d at 513-14.Â  In concluding the plaintiff offered insufficient evidence to\r\n  establish a defect, the supreme court noted the absence of an optional safety\r\n  device does not render a product defective unless the product is unreasonably\r\n  dangerous without the device.Â  Id.Â  Holst argues that because KCI designed\r\n  and manufactured the crane, Marchant v. Lorain Division of Koehring (Marchant\r\n  II), 272 S.C. 243, 251 S.E.2d 189 (1979), not Mitchell, provides the\r\n  applicable standard.Â  In Marchant II, our supreme court reversed the\r\n  trial court's grant of summary judgment against a crane manufacturer where there\r\n  was evidence the manufacturer knew of the crane's tendency to double-block, and\r\n  the manufacturer sold an optional anti-two blocking device. Â 272 S.C. at 245,\r\n  251 S.E.2d at 191. Â The court noted the affidavit of a design engineer was\r\n  sufficient evidence to create a jury issue regarding whether the crane was\r\n  unreasonably dangerous without the incorporation of a safety device. Â Id. at 247, 251 S.E.2d at 191-92.Â  The design engineer stated that the two-blocking\r\n  syndrome was predictable based on the crane's design.Â  Id. Â Here, unlike\r\n  in Marchant II where the crane's tendency to malfunction was documented,\r\n  the evidence indicates that no such incident like the one which occurred in\r\n  this case had ever occurred.Â  Furthermore, in Marchant II, the\r\n  manufacturer sold an optional safety device; while in this case, the video\r\n  camera alternative proposed by Holst has never been used on a RTG crane. Â Moreover,\r\n  evidence in the record establishes that the proposed video camera would not\r\n  eliminate the crane's blind spot. Thus, viewing this case under the holding in Marchant\r\n  II, we find Holst is not entitled to relief.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHolst also argues the circuit\r\n  court erred in relying on dicta in Bragg to support the proposition that\r\n  conformity with industry custom is an appropriate basis for granting summary\r\n  judgment. In Bragg, the court considered the plaintiff's expert's\r\n  testimony that no one in the industry had designed or manufactured the type of\r\n  special disconnect couplings he proposed. 319 S.C. at 544, 462 S.E.2d at 329. Â The\r\n  court affirmed the directed verdict and held that &quot;conformity with industry\r\n  practice is not conclusive of the product's safety,&quot; and &quot;industry\r\n  standards are relevant to show both the reasonableness of the design and that\r\n  the product is dangerous beyond the expectations of the ordinary\r\n  consumer.&quot;Â  Id. at 543-44, 462 S.E.2d at 328-29. Â We find the\r\n  court's holding in Bragg was not dicta because conformity with industry\r\n  custom was an issue before the court.Â  See Nash v. Tindall Corp.,\r\n  375 S.C. 36, 40, 650 S.E.2d 81, 83 (Ct. App. 2007) (holding dicta is a statement\r\n  on a matter not necessarily involved in the case).Â  Moreover, in the present\r\n  case, the circuit court did not rely solely on conformity with industry custom in\r\n  determining there was no competent evidence by which a reasonable jury could\r\n  conclude the crane was defective.Â  Conformity with industry custom was only one\r\n  factor the circuit court considered in reaching its decision. Thus, the circuit\r\n  court did not err in relying on Bragg.Â \r\n  \r\n  IV.&nbsp; Summary Judgment\r\n  \r\nHolst argues the circuit court\r\n  erred in granting summary judgment on her strict liability and negligence claims\r\n  for defective design, and her negligence claim for failure to warn.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â \r\n  \r\n  A.&nbsp; Strict Liability\r\n  \r\nHolst contends the circuit\r\n  court improperly granted summary judgment on her strict liability claim because\r\n  Pearsall and Leonard testified the crane was defective and unreasonably\r\n  dangerous. Â As discussed above, we find the circuit court properly\r\n  determined KCI was entitled to summary judgment on Holst's strict liability\r\n  claim.\r\n  \r\n  B.&nbsp; Negligence â€“ Defective\r\n    Design\r\n  \r\nHolst argues genuine issues of\r\n  material fact exist as to whether KCI exercised due care in designing the crane. Â &quot;Under a negligence theory, the plaintiff bears the additional\r\n  burden of demonstrating the defendant (seller or manufacturer) failed to\r\n  exercise due care in some respect, and, unlike strict liability, the focus is\r\n  on the conduct of the seller or manufacturer, and liability is determined\r\n  according to fault.&quot;Â  Bragg, 319 S.C. at 539, 462 S.E.2d at 326.Â  Holst\r\n  contends KCI did not consider (1) installing video cameras on its cranes, (2) placing\r\n  the cab on any part of the crane other than the trolley, or (3) the\r\n  &quot;variable elevating cabin&quot; manufactured by Mi-Jack.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe find Holst failed to\r\n  present a material question of fact as to whether KCI exercised due care in\r\n  designing the crane. Â Evidence in the record indicates KCI designed a crane cab\r\n  which, compared to its competitors, greatly increased the crane operator's\r\n  visibility. Â Pursuant to requests from its users that KCI increase the\r\n  visibility from the operator's cab, KCI minimized the areas of the cab that did\r\n  not contain glass and increased the height of the crane.Â  Ilpo Hakala, the KCI\r\n  engineer who designed the crane, testified the crane's operator's cab had\r\n  increased visibility compared to its competitors. Â Moreover, Leonard testified\r\n  he had never seen a RTG cab with better visibility than the crane's cab.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhile Holst contends KCI was\r\n  negligent because it did not consider installing video cameras on the crane, the\r\n  undisputed evidence in the record is that the crane's blind spot cannot be\r\n  eliminated. Â Holst's experts testified that even with a video camera, the crane's\r\n  blind spot is unavoidable. Additionally, the crane's design included safety\r\n  measures which allowed the operator to communicate with personnel on the ground\r\n  in compliance with the ASME standard.Â  The crane's cab had a full view of the\r\n  load block as required by the ASME, and was equipped with a telephone, horn,\r\n  and intercom to allow the operator to communicate with personnel on the ground. Â Furthermore, although Holst argues KCI was negligent in failing to\r\n  consider the variable-elevating cabin of the Mi-Jack, there is no evidence in\r\n  the record the Mi-Jack design would eliminate the crane's blind spot. Â Finally,\r\n  the mere fact that a video camera and closed-circuit television system could\r\n  have been installed on the crane does not establish a design defect.Â  See Disher, 371 F. Supp. 2d at 770 (concluding every product on the market\r\n  could be &quot;made stronger&quot; or &quot;more safe,&quot; but the mere fact\r\n  that the product could be stronger or safer does not establish a design defect\r\n  or an unreasonably dangerous condition, as a matter of law). Â \r\n  \r\n  C.&nbsp; Negligence â€“ Failure to\r\n    Warn\r\n  \r\nHolst also argues KCI was\r\n  negligent in failing to warn users about the crane's blind spot.Â  Holst argues\r\n  KCI failed to conduct a formal training meeting with personnel from the SCSPA\r\n  to disclose the crane's blind spots.Â  Furthermore, Holst argues the crane's\r\n  Operation and Maintenance Manual (Manual) does not mention the blind spot.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\tA supplier and manufacturer of a product are liable\r\n  for failing to warn if they know or have reason to know the product is or is\r\n  likely to be dangerous for its intended use; they have no reason to believe the\r\n  user will realize the potential danger; and, they fail to exercise reasonable\r\n  care to inform of its dangerous condition or of the facts which make it likely\r\n  to be dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLivingston v. Noland Corp., 293 S.C. 521, 525, 362 S.E.2d 16, 18 (1987).Â \r\n\r\n\r\nWe find Holst's negligence\r\n  claim for failure to warn fails because the evidence in the record reflects KCI\r\n  provided proper warnings regarding the crane.

White, of Goose Creek, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tMargaret Mary Urbanic, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.:Â \r\n  This is a workers' compensation case.Â  At issue in this appeal is the award to\r\n  the claimant, Franklin Hutson, following his attainment of maximum medical\r\n  improvement (MMI), that limited his recovery to correspond with a thirty-percent\r\n  loss of use to his back.Â  We affirm in part and remand this matter to the\r\n  commission for further proceedings.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn 1997, Hutson began working as a crane operator for\r\n  the State Ports Authority (SPA).Â  He had extensive prior experience in this\r\n  line of work and attained an average weekly salary of $1,730.Â  On October 21,\r\n  2004, Hutson was injured while attempting to remove a container from a ship.Â \r\n  SPA admitted the injury and paid Hutson benefits.\r\nIn December 2004, Hutson began treatment with Dr.\r\n  Stovall, an orthopaedic surgeon.Â  On June 27, 2005, Dr. Stovall determined\r\n  Hutson reached MMI and discharged him, noting that surgical intervention would\r\n  not help him.Â  Dr. Stovall assigned Hutson an impairment rating of ten percent of\r\n  the whole person for his injury.Â  He also noted that Hutson's permanent work\r\n  restrictions would include lifting no more than thirty-five pounds on an\r\n  occasional basis and no more than twenty-five pounds on a frequent basis, but\r\n  otherwise opined that Hutson &quot;should be able to carry on a moderate level\r\n  of activity at medium work capacity.&quot;\r\nOn July 29, 2005, Hutson filed a request before the\r\n  South Carolina Workers' Compensation Commission seeking continuation of his\r\n  benefits.Â  Hutson maintained he was permanently and totally disabled because of\r\n  the effect of his injury on his back and right leg.Â  On August 9, 2005, SPA\r\n  filed a response denying Hutson was permanently disabled and admitting that\r\n  only Hutson's back injury was compensable.Â  On August 31, 2005, the State\r\n  Accident Fund, on behalf of SPA, filed a Form 21 in which it sought to stop\r\n  compensation on the ground that Hutson had reached MMI.Â  The Fund also\r\n  requested credit for overpayment of temporary total compensation.\r\nWhen the matter first came before the single\r\n  commissioner, Hutson had not yet completed the training at the South Carolina\r\n  Vocational Rehabilitation Center that his vocational consultant had recommended.Â \r\n  The matter was continued pending either Hutson's completion of the program or a\r\n  determination that he was unable to undergo further training. \r\nThe single commissioner heard the matter on August 1,\r\n  2006.Â  Hutson testified he was forty-four years old and had finished high\r\n  school.Â  He further testified he had studied business management, culinary\r\n  arts, and food sanitation at Trident Tech, but never received a degree or\r\n  certificate.Â  For most of his adult life, he had worked as a crane operator,\r\n  and the only other significant experience he had was work as a rigger.Â  He was\r\n  unable to return to either line of work under the restrictions that were\r\n  imposed as a result of his injury.Â  Hutson described at length how the pain he\r\n  experienced from his injury affected his day-to-day living.Â  He acknowledged\r\n  that when he was twelve, his hand was injured when someone shot him with a\r\n  high-powered rifle.Â  The accident resulted in a loss of coordination and\r\n  several unsuccessful surgeries, but did not affect his ability to perform his\r\n  work as a crane operator before his accident.\r\nHutson also testified that, as his vocational\r\n  consultant had recommended, he made several visits to Vocational\r\n  Rehabilitation, but was not offered any type of education, training, or other\r\n  help.Â  Although Hutson estimated he made three visits, the single commissioner\r\n  found the program was commenced and completed on October 9, 2005.Â  Hutson\r\n  stated he then made unsuccessful applications for positions in a variety of\r\n  settings, including a grocery store, a plumbing company, and a landscaping business.\r\nIn response to questions from his attorney about his\r\n  future plans, Hutson stated he wanted to start a business of his own and was\r\n  looking into a restaurant business.Â  He testified he had studied culinary arts\r\n  and other food-related courses at Trident Tech, and his family had been in the\r\n  restaurant business &quot;all their lives.&quot;Â  He further noted that\r\n  cooking, a pursuit that he enjoyed, was &quot;not as strenuous as manual\r\n  labor,&quot; and surmised he could make a decent salary if he could supervise\r\n  others to work for him.Â  The single commissioner himself questioned Hutson\r\n  about his plans to pursue a career in the food service industry, asking Hutson\r\n  if he was sure he could run a restaurant.Â  Hutson answered he was\r\n  &quot;sure&quot; he could, but was unable to say how much money he could earn.Â \r\n  On redirect examination, however, Hutson testified that one reason he decided\r\n  on a plan to open a restaurant was to try to move up to a higher income\r\n  bracket.\r\nBy order dated January 11, 2007, the single\r\n  commissioner found Hutson had reached MMI on June 27, 2005.Â  The commissioner\r\n  further found Hutson failed to prove a loss of earning capacity to qualify for\r\n  compensation under the general disability statutes; however, he found Hutson\r\n  suffered a thirty-percent loss of use to his back and awarded compensation for\r\n  a scheduled loss.Â  In addition, the Fund was awarded a credit for overpayment\r\n  of temporary total benefits.\r\nHutson moved for reconsideration.Â  The single\r\n  commissioner held a second hearing, but declined to alter his ruling.Â  Hutson\r\n  appealed the single commissioner's decision to the appellate panel, which, in a\r\n  2-1 vote, affirmed the single commissioner.Â  Hutson then petitioned for\r\n  judicial review. Â Following a hearing on March 11, 2008, the court of common\r\n  pleas affirmed the appellate panel's order.[2]\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tWas there substantial evidence to support a finding \r\n\t\t\tthat Hutson was capable of running a restaurant and therefore\r\n  could not receive compensation for partial disability?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tB. \r\n\t\t\tWas the decision to limit Hutson's\r\n  recovery to loss of use of his back an error of law?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tC.\r\n\t\t\tShould the matter have been remanded to the \r\n\t\t\tcommission for findings of fact regarding Hutson's current\r\n  earning capacity or the extent of his injuries?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;In\r\n  workers' compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.&quot;Â  DeBruhl v. Kershaw County Sheriff's Dep't, 303 S.C. 20, 24, 397 S.E.2d\r\n  782, 785 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  &quot;Our standard of review requires that we\r\n  determine whether the circuit court properly found the Commission's findings of\r\n  fact are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.&quot;Â  Doe v.\r\n    S.C. Dep't of Disabilities and Special Needs, 377 S.C. 346, 349, 660 S.E.2d\r\n  260, 262 (2008).Â  &quot;While a finding of fact of the commission will normally\r\n  be upheld, such a finding may not be based upon surmise, conjecture, or\r\n  speculation, but must be founded on evidence of sufficient substance to afford\r\n  a reasonable basis for it.&quot;Â  Edwards v. Pettit Constr. Co., 273\r\n  S.C. 576, 579, 257 S.E.2d 754, 755 (1979).Â  &quot;Under the scope of review\r\n  established in the APA, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of\r\n  the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but\r\n  may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.&quot;Â  Bass\r\n    v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 467, 617 S.E.2d 369, 376 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Evidence of wage loss \r\nIn\r\n  his order, the single commissioner noted that had Hutson not made assurances\r\n  that he was capable of running a restaurant, he would have been found to be\r\n  permanently and totally disabled.Â  On appeal, Hutson does not take issue with\r\n  the denial of compensation for total disability; however, he asserts he is\r\n  entitled to recover for partial disability.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder\r\n  the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act, &quot;a claimant may proceed\r\n  under Â§ 42-9-10 or Â§ 42-9-20 to prove a general disability; alternatively, he\r\n  or she may proceed under Â§ 42-9-30 to prove a loss, or loss of use of, a\r\n  member, organ, or part of the body for which specific awards are listed in the\r\n  statute.&quot;Â  Fields v. Owens Corning Fiberglas, 301 S.C. 554, 555,\r\n  393 S.E.2d 172, 173 (1990).[3]Â \r\n  &quot;It is well-settled that an award under the\r\n  general disability statutes must be predicated upon a showing of a loss of\r\n  earning capacity, whereas an award under the scheduled loss statute does not\r\n  require such a showing.&quot;Â  Id.Â  A reversal of the finding that\r\n  Hutson could not recover under section 42-9-20, then, would require a showing\r\n  by Hutson that the record lacked substantial evidence to support the appellate\r\n  panel's determination that he failed to show a loss of earning capacity\r\n  resulting from his injury.Â  We hold, however, that there was substantial\r\n  evidence in the record to support the finding that Hutson was capable of\r\n  running a restaurant and that this finding in turn precluded an award under\r\n  section 42-9-20.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Hutson contends the only evidence to support the finding that he could\r\n  run a restaurant was his own testimony, which he describes as\r\n  &quot;speculative.&quot;Â  He further argues the commissioner and the appellate\r\n  panel disregarded the only expert evidence in the record, namely, the written\r\n  statement of his vocational consultant.Â  We do not agree with these arguments.\r\nFirst,\r\n  as the South Carolina Supreme Court has stated:Â  &quot;[W]hile medical\r\n  testimony is entitled to great respect, the fact finder may disregard it if\r\n  there is other competent evidence in the record.&quot;Â  Tiller v. Nat'l\r\n    Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 340, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999).Â \r\n  We see no reason not to apply this rule to other expert testimony.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  we disagree with Hutson's position that the vocational consultant's opinion was\r\n  the only expert assessment of his ability to work.[4] According to his notes, Dr. Stovall opined that Hutson &quot;should be able to\r\n  carry on a moderate level of activity at the medium work capacity&quot; and\r\n  assigned only weight-lifting restrictions.Â  In addition, on the advice of his\r\n  attorney, Hutson consulted another physician, who indicated that Hutson could\r\n  return to work on light duty.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  also agree with the circuit judge that Hutson's testimony regarding his plans\r\n  to work in the restaurant business was not speculative.Â  Hutson stated (1) he\r\n  had studied culinary arts and food sanitation at Trident Technical College; (2)\r\n  his family had been in the restaurant business for many years, so he was aware\r\n  of the demands of the work and the initial investment necessary to invest in an\r\n  establishment; (3) since his release from treatment he had been working on the\r\n  restaurant project, researching locations, getting menu selections, and pricing\r\n  equipment; and (4) he could perform in a supervisory capacity as well as work\r\n  the register.Â  We do not believe that the fact that Hutson had never actually\r\n  attempted to handle the day-to-day tasks of running a restaurant necessarily makes\r\n  his statements speculative.Â  Cf. Sellers v. Pinedale Residential Ctr.,\r\n  350 S.C. 183, 191-92, 564 S.E.2d 694, 699 (Ct. App. 2002) (rejecting the\r\n  employer's argument that evidence of the claimant's future earnings was too\r\n  speculative, that evidence consisting of (1) the claimant's demonstrated\r\n  interest, aptitude, and ability to become an electrician, (2) his stated\r\n  ambition to become a master electrician, and (3) his demonstrated work ethic).Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  we concur in the single commissioner's decision to emphasize the fact that the\r\n  testimony about Hutson's ability to work in a restaurant came from Hutson\r\n  himself, who had the burden of proving his case.Â  Cf. Smith v.\r\n    Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 296, 298, 465 S.E.2d 96, 97 (Ct. App. 1995) (affirming\r\n  the denial of benefits for the claimant's alleged psychological problems even\r\n  though she received benefits for permanent partial disability for a physical\r\n  injury and noting &quot;[t]he claimant has the burden to prove such facts as\r\n  will render the injury compensable&quot;). Â This emphasis seems especially\r\n  appropriate considering the efforts by the single commissioner to allow Hutson\r\n  to qualify or otherwise explain his testimony about his ability to pursue a\r\n  career in the restaurant business.Â  Moreover, Hutson also admitted he drove\r\n  himself to the hearing and took care of his household chores.Â  Although these\r\n  admissions alone may not support a finding that he could manage a restaurant,\r\n  they would not undermine it.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitation of Hutson's recovery to loss of use of his\r\n  back\r\nHutson\r\n  alleges error in the determination that his recovery should be limited to the\r\n  loss of use of his back, pointing to statements by the single commissioner both\r\n  during the hearing and in his order that he had intended to take into account\r\n  his belief that Hutson's injury affected his right leg as well as his back and\r\n  the combination of the two injuries would enable Hutson to recover under section\r\n  42-9-20 as well as section 42-9-30. Â As we have previously determined, the\r\n  record has substantial evidence to support the appellate panel's finding that\r\n  Hutson did not prove a loss of earning capacity that would enable him to\r\n  receive compensation benefits under section 42-9-20.Â  We agree with Hutson,\r\n  however, that he may be entitled to additional compensation under section\r\n  42-9-30 for the symptoms he was experiencing with his leg after his accident.\r\nAlthough &quot;an\r\n  award under general disability statutes must be predicated upon a showing of a\r\n  loss of earning capacity, . . . an award under the scheduled loss statute does\r\n  not require such a showing.&quot;Â  Fields, 301 S.C. at 555, 393 S.E.2d at\r\n  173.Â  &quot;An award under the scheduled loss statute, however, is premised\r\n  upon the threshold requirement that the claimant prove a loss, or loss of use\r\n  of, a specific 'member, organ, or part of the body.' &quot;Â  Id. at 556,\r\n  393 S.E.2d at 173 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30(22) (Supp. 2009)).Â  Although\r\n  most of the reported decisions concerning claims for more than one scheduled\r\n  injury focus on whether the claimant is eligible to recover under one of the\r\n  general disability statutes, the South Carolina Supreme Court has expressed its\r\n  approval of awarding compensation for multiple scheduled losses under section\r\n  42-9-30.Â  See Lail v. Georgia-Pacific Corp. 285 S.C. 234, 236,\r\n  328 S.E.2d 911, 912 (1985) (reversing an award for loss of use of the hand and\r\n  remanding the matter to the commission for factual findings regarding the percentage\r\n  of loss of use of the thumb and third finger and referencing the\r\n  &quot;legislative plan providing scheduled amounts for loss of use of thumbs\r\n  and fingers&quot;).Â  \r\nIn his order, the\r\n  single commissioner made a finding of fact that Hutson suffered radicular\r\n  symptoms in his right leg that affected the functioning of the limb.Â  He\r\n  reiterated this finding when, in commenting on Hutson's assurances that he was\r\n  capable of running a restaurant, he indicated that but for this testimony, he\r\n  would have found Hutson to be permanently and totally disabled &quot;with\r\n  affects to the right leg.&quot;Â  Given this finding, which neither the SPA nor\r\n  the Fund has appealed, we hold Hutson has established at least a prima facie\r\n  case for compensation for the injury to his leg pursuant to section 42-9-30 and\r\n  remand the matter to the commission for further findings of fact on this matter\r\n  based on the present record.Â  See Sigmon v. Dayco Corp., 316 S.C.\r\n  260, 262, 449 S.E.2d 497, 498 (Ct. App. 1994) (noting that only the commission\r\n  is authorized to make findings of fact in workers' compensation cases and\r\n  remanding the matter to the commission for a determination anew based on the\r\n  present record of the claimant's right to workers' compensation benefits).\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remand\r\nFinally,\r\n  Hutson argues the court of common pleas should have remanded the matter to the\r\n  commission for findings of fact regarding his current earning capacity or the\r\n  extent of his injuries.Â  In view of our decisions to affirm the finding that he\r\n  is not entitled to benefits under section 42-9-20 and to remand the issue of\r\n  additional compensation for his leg injuries pursuant to section 42-9-30, we\r\n  decline to address this issue.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335\r\n  S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not\r\n  address remaining issues when its decision on a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the finding that Hutson failed to show a loss of earning capacity that\r\n  would have entitled him to compensation under section 42-9-20 following his\r\n  attainment of MMI.Â  We hold, however, Hutson may be entitled to additional\r\n  compensation under section 42-9-30 for injuries to his leg and therefore remand\r\n  this case to the commission for further findings of fact on this issue.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J, and PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  In her order, the circuit judge noted the single\r\n  commissioner assigned a thirty-percent impairment to the &quot;whole\r\n  person.&quot;Â  The single commissioner, however, found Hutson suffered a thirty\r\n  percent loss of use of his back. \r\n[3]Â  Section 42-9-10 of the South Carolina Code (1985\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2009) describes various criteria that satisfy the requirements for\r\n  a finding that a claimant is totally disabled and the method for computing the\r\n  compensation to which a totally disabled claimant is entitled.Â  Section 42-9-20\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (1985) gives the method for computing compensation\r\n  for partial disability.Â  In section 42-9-30 of the South Carolina Code (1985\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2009), the legislature provides a detailed schedule of varying time\r\n  periods of compensation for particular injuries.Â  This section was amended in\r\n  2007; however, the changes do not affect the merits of this appeal.Â  \r\n[4]Â  Hutson may have misinterpreted the vocational\r\n  consultant's opinion regarding his ability to work.Â  In his brief, he asserts\r\n  that the vocational consultant indicated that &quot;upon successful completion\r\n  of a vocational training program, . . . his earnings would be between $5.15 and\r\n  $6.50 an hour.&quot;Â  The consultant actually stated that without a\r\n  vocational rehabilitation plan, she was &quot;of the opinion that Mr. Hutson\r\n  will encounter very significant difficulty re-entering the competitive job\r\n  market and will be relegated to at or near minimum wage ($5.15 - $6.50 per\r\n  hour).&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4738","title":"SC Farm Bureau v.

(Irons Poultry), and at his\r\n  employer's direction, Kennedy drove the company's manure truck to a restaurant\r\n  to tell the owner he could pick up some chicken feed at his employer's farm.Â \r\n  After delivering the message, Kennedy paused in the restaurant parking lot to\r\n  talk to his half-brother, Teddy Robinson, who worked at the restaurant.Â  While\r\n  Kennedy was talking to Robinson, an accident occurred on the highway adjacent\r\n  to the parking lot, and one of the vehicles careened into the parking lot,\r\n  striking Kennedy and Robinson who were standing behind the manure truck.Â  The\r\n  vehicle that struck Kennedy was a pickup truck driven by George Counts.Â \r\n  Kennedy sustained injuries with medical costs and lost wages totaling more than\r\n  $64,000; however, he settled with Counts' insurance company for $50,000 in\r\n  exchange for a covenant not to execute.Â  Kennedy then made a demand for the\r\n  full amount of UIM coverage available under Irons Poultry's policy with Farm\r\n  Bureau.Â  The policy provided UIM coverage in the amount of $50,000 per\r\n  individual, and $100,000 per occurrence.Â  Farm Bureau denied Kennedy coverage,\r\n  claiming Kennedy was not entitled to UIM coverage under the policy because he\r\n  was not occupying Irons Poultry's manure truck at the time of the accident as\r\n  required by the policy to qualify for UIM coverage.Â  Farm Bureau's policy\r\n  defined &quot;occupying&quot; as &quot;having actual physical contact with an\r\n  auto while in, upon, entering, or alighting from it.&quot;Â Â Â  \r\nOn April 21, 2004, Farm Bureau filed a declaratory judgment action\r\n  to determine if Kennedy was entitled to UIM coverage under Farm Bureau's\r\n  commercial auto policy issued to Irons Poultry.Â  Kennedy filed a motion for\r\n  summary judgment, asserting he was entitled to coverage under the policy\r\n  because the evidence conclusively proved he was pinned between the manure truck\r\n  and Counts' truck, thus establishing he was &quot;upon&quot; the truck.Â  The\r\n  case was set for a non-jury trial on May 11, 2005.Â  Before trial, Kennedy\r\n  requested Judge Saunders hear his motion for summary judgment.Â  Judge Saunders\r\n  granted the motion in an order dated June 16, 2005.[2]Â  Farm Bureau\r\n  filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied.Â  Farm Bureau then filed\r\n  an appeal with this court.Â  After oral arguments on the case, this court found\r\n  a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Kennedy was pinned or\r\n  knocked against the manure truck.Â  Therefore, in an unpublished opinion, this\r\n  court reversed the circuit court's decision granting summary judgment to\r\n  Kennedy, and remanded the case to the circuit court for a hearing on the\r\n  merits.[3]Â \r\n  Kennedy filed a Petition for Rehearing with this court, which was denied. \r\nUpon remand from this court, the non-jury trial was conducted on\r\n  July 15 and 17, 2008.[4]Â \r\n  Several months later, Judge Hayes filed his order finding Kennedy was entitled\r\n  to UIM coverage because he was momentarily pinned against the manure truck\r\n  during the accident; therefore, he was &quot;upon&quot; the insured vehicle and\r\n  &quot;occupying&quot; it according to the policy.[5]Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â \r\nStandard of Review\r\nDeclaratory judgment actions are neither\r\n  legal nor equitable; therefore, the standard of review is determined by the\r\n  nature of the underlying issue.Â  Hardy v. Aiken, 369 S.C. 160, 164, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 539, 541 (2006).Â  &quot;When the purpose of the underlying dispute is to\r\n  determine whether coverage exists under an insurance policy, the action is one\r\n  at law.&quot;Â  Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Hamin, 368 S.C. 536, 540, 629\r\n  S.E.2d 683, 685 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  &quot;In an action at law tried without a\r\n  jury, the appellate court will not disturb the trial court's findings of fact\r\n  unless they are found to be without evidence that reasonably supports those\r\n  findings.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFarm Bureau\r\n  argues the trial court erred in finding Kennedy was occupying the manure truck\r\n  when he was hit by the pickup truck because he was not upon the manure truck at\r\n  the time of the accident.Â  We agree.\r\nThe general rules of contract construction apply to insurance\r\n  policies.Â  MGC Mgmt. of Charleston, Inc. v. Kinghorn Ins. Agency, 336\r\n  S.C. 542, 548, 520 S.E.2d 820, 823 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  &quot;[T]he law is clear\r\n  that, in construing an insurance contract, all of its provisions must be\r\n  considered together.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;Therefore, the court must\r\n  consider the entire contract between the parties to determine the meaning of\r\n  its provisions, and that construction will be adopted which will give effect to\r\n  the whole instrument and each of its various parts, so long as it is reasonable\r\n  to do so.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;This court must enforce, not write,\r\n  contracts of insurance and we must give policy language its plain, ordinary,\r\n  and popular meaning.&quot;Â  Id. at 548-49, 520 S.E.2d at 823.Â  &quot;An\r\n  insurer's obligation under a policy of insurance is defined by the terms of the\r\n  policy itself, and cannot be enlarged by judicial construction.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;[A]mbiguous or conflicting terms in an insurance policy must be construed\r\n  liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;However, if the intention of the parties is clear, courts have no\r\n  authority to torture the meaning of policy language to extend or defeat\r\n  coverage that was never intended by the parties.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nFarm\r\n  Bureau's policy defined &quot;occupying&quot; as &quot;having actual physical\r\n  contact with an auto while in, upon, entering, or alighting from it.&quot;Â  In\r\n  this case, Kennedy was not getting in or out of the manure truck at the time of\r\n  the accident.Â  He was standing near the truck when he was hit.Â  Kennedy argues\r\n  the pickup truck hit him and briefly pinned him against the manure truck.Â  The\r\n  issue now before us is whether the impact of the pickup truck pushing Kennedy\r\n  into the manure truck was enough for Kennedy to have been &quot;upon&quot; the\r\n  manure truck so as to fall under the policy.Â  Two South Carolina cases have\r\n  dealt with similar issues, but neither is the exact issue presented in this\r\n  case.\r\nIn McAbee v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 249 S.C. 96,\r\n  98-99, 152 S.E.2d 731, 732 (1967), our supreme court was presented with the\r\n  sole question of whether the insured, while standing on the ground with his\r\n  back against a parked truck in an effort to keep a tractor from rolling against\r\n  him, was &quot;upon&quot; the truck within the meaning of the policy.[6]Â  The court stated it did not think\r\n  the meaning of the word &quot;upon&quot; is restricted to &quot;on top\r\n  of,&quot; such as a person resting the weight of his or her body upon the\r\n  vehicle or being supported by the vehicle.Â  Id. at 100, 152 S.E.2d at\r\n  732.Â  The court noted that according to Webster's Third New International\r\n  Dictionary, &quot;[o]ne of the common and ordinary meanings of the word 'upon'\r\n  is that of 'contact with'.&quot;Â  Id.; see S.C. Prop. &amp;\r\n    Cas. Guar. Ass'n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518 n.2, 548 S.E.2d 880, 883 n.2\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (stating that McAbee discussed that the term &quot;upon&quot;\r\n  was synonymous with &quot;contact with&quot;).Â  The court stated that because\r\n  the policy contained no restrictions as to how or in what manner the insured\r\n  was to be upon the vehicle, the court thought &quot;it reasonable to conclude\r\n  that the parties contemplated a construction of the word that would include\r\n  actual physical contact with the vehicle the insured was using.&quot;Â  Id. at 100, 152 S.E.2d at 732-33.Â  Therefore, the court held the insured was in\r\n  actual physical contact with the vehicle and was &quot;upon&quot; it within the\r\n  meaning of the policy provision when he placed his back against the vehicle in\r\n  an attempt to protect himself from the rolling tractor.Â  Id. at 100, 152\r\n  S.E.2d at 733.Â Â Â  \r\nThis\r\n  case is distinguishable from McAbee because in McAbee, the\r\n  insured had his back to the truck and was pushing against it when he was\r\n  crushed to death.Â  Therefore, the insured was physically touching the truck\r\n  when he was killed.Â  Here, Kennedy was near the manure truck when he was hit by\r\n  the other vehicle and asserts he was pushed into the manure truck by the pickup\r\n  truck.Â  Therefore, Kennedy was not physically touching the truck when he was\r\n  first hit by the pickup truck. \r\nIn South\r\n  Carolina Property and Casualty Guaranty Ass'n v. Yensen, 345 S.C. 512, 518,\r\n  548 S.E.2d 880, 883 (Ct. App. 2001), this court held the owner of a disabled\r\n  car, Yensen, was not &quot;occupying&quot; a tow truck when a car struck him as\r\n  he stood alongside his disabled car.Â  The court found Yensen was not an &quot;insured&quot;\r\n  entitled to UIM benefits under the tow truck owner's policy, even though he\r\n  intended to occupy the tow truck for a ride, because at the time of the\r\n  accident he was not in, upon, getting in, on, out or off the truck, and no\r\n  causal connection existed between the truck and the injuries.Â  Id. at\r\n  518-20, 548 S.E.2d at 883-84.Â  The tow truck's policy defined\r\n  &quot;insured&quot; as &quot;anyone else 'occupying' a covered auto.&quot;Â  Id. at 517, 548 S.E.2d at 883.Â  According to the policy, &quot;occupying&quot; was\r\n  defined as &quot;in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  Therefore, this court determined Yensen was not occupying the tow truck as the\r\n  policy defined that term.Â  Id. at 518, 548 S.E.2d at 883.Â  The court\r\n  found that under the plain meaning of the words, Yensen was not &quot;in, upon,\r\n  getting in, on, out or off&quot; the tow truck at the time of the accident.Â  Id. at 518-19, 548 S.E.2d at 883.Â  While the court noted there was some testimony Yensen\r\n  intended to leave the scene in the tow truck, he was not &quot;in or on&quot; or\r\n  in the process of getting into the truck at the time of the accident.Â  Id.Â  \r\nYensen is\r\n  also distinguishable from this case because in Yensen the court noted\r\n  Yensen may or may not have intended to get into the tow truck, which was the insured\r\n  vehicle from which he was seeking coverage.Â  In this case, Kennedy had driven\r\n  the manure truck to the restaurant and was intending to leave the restaurant in\r\n  the manure truck; therefore, there was no question of his intent to depart in\r\n  the insured vehicle.Â  However, like Yensen, Kennedy was not &quot;in, upon,\r\n  getting in, on, out or off&quot; the manure truck at the time of the accident.Â \r\n  Kennedy had departed the truck, gone inside the restaurant, and then returned\r\n  to the parking lot to talk to Robinson near the vehicle.Â  Although there was\r\n  testimony Kennedy was headed back to the manure truck when he was hit, he was\r\n  not &quot;getting in&quot; the truck when he was struck by Counts' pickup truck.Â Â  \r\nIn Yensen, this court noted that in Whitmire v.\r\n  Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 254 S.C. 184, 191-92, 174 S.E.2d 391, 394-95\r\n  (1970),[7] our supreme court &quot;held that where a passenger was struck while within two\r\n  or three feet of the car he had immediately 'alighted from,' that passenger may\r\n  collect uninsured motorist coverage from the insurer of the car he had been\r\n  riding in.&quot;Â  Yensen, 345 S.C. at 519, 548 S.E.2d at 883-84. Â Yensen\r\n  argued Whitmire was controlling because Yensen intended to occupy the\r\n  tow truck and, thus, he should have been able to collect insurance from the tow\r\n  truck's insurance provider.Â  Id.Â  This court found Whitmire was\r\n  distinguishable because there, the plaintiff had unquestionably been occupying\r\n  the car, whereas in Yensen, at most, Yensen's intent to occupy the tow\r\n  truck was expressed after the accident and during litigation.Â  Id. at\r\n  519, 548 S.E.2d at 884. Â This court stated it was reluctant to extend Whitmire to the facts in Yensen because Yensen was not &quot;still engaged in the\r\n  completion of those acts reasonably to be expected from one getting out of an\r\n  automobile under similar conditions.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Whitmire,\r\n  254 S.C. at 191, 174 S.E.2d at 394).Â  In Whitmire, the court noted\r\n  &quot;[t]he words 'in' and 'upon' encompass situations where a person has some\r\n  physical contact with the vehicle at the time of injury.&quot;Â  254 S.C. at\r\n  191, 174 S.E.2d at 394.\r\nHere, if Kennedy had been hit soon after he had alighted from the\r\n  manure truck, under Whitmire, he would have been deemed to have been\r\n  &quot;occupying&quot; the truck; however, Kennedy had gone inside the\r\n  restaurant, returned to the parking lot, and was standing near the truck\r\n  talking when the accident occurred.Â  Therefore, he was not\r\n  &quot;occupying&quot; the truck as a result of having recently alighted from\r\n  the truck because of the intervening act of going into the restaurant.Â  \r\nWhile McAbee and Yensen are helpful, they are not dispositive of the issue in this\r\n  case.Â  Therefore, we look to other jurisdictions for guidance on this issue.Â \r\n  Many states have been faced with a similar issue and some have adopted tests to\r\n  determine whether a person is &quot;occupying&quot; a vehicle as to have\r\n  coverage under an insurance policy.Â  In Utica Mutual Insurance Co. v.\r\n    Contrisciane, 473 A.2d 1005, 1009 (Pa. 1984), the Pennsylvania Supreme\r\n  Court established a four-part test to determine whether a person engaged in the\r\n  lawful use of an insured vehicle will be considered to be &quot;occupying&quot;[8] that vehicle within the meaning of\r\n  the policy: \r\n\r\n\t(1) there is a causal relation or connection between the injury\r\n  and the use of the insured vehicle; \r\n\t(2) the person asserting coverage must be in a reasonably close\r\n  geographic proximity to the insured vehicle, although the person need not be\r\n  actually touching it; \r\n\t(3) the person must be vehicle oriented rather than highway or\r\n  sidewalk oriented at the time; and \r\n\t(4) the person must also be engaged in a transaction essential to\r\n  the use of the vehicle at the time.\r\n\r\nSee also Loyd v. State Auto. Prop. &amp; Cas.\r\n  Co., 265 S.W.3d 901, 905 (Mo. Ct. App. W.D. 2008) (stating the four-part\r\n  test &quot;does express reasonable and sensible considerations to determine\r\n  whether a person is occupying a vehicle,&quot; but declining to adopt the test); Cuevas v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 130 N.M. 539, 541 (N.M. Ct.\r\n  App. 2001) (citing the Utica test, and noting it has been adopted in the\r\n  majority of jurisdictions and &quot;is broader and is concerned with whether 'the\r\n  person claiming benefits was performing an act (or acts) which is (are)\r\n  normally associated with the immediate â€˜useâ€™ of the [vehicle]'&quot; (quoting Utica,\r\n  473 A.2d at 1009)); Downing v. Harleysville Ins. Co., 602 A.2d 871, 874\r\n  (Pa. 1992) (applying the Utica test); General Accident Ins. Co. of\r\n    Am. v. Olivier, 574 A.2d 1240, 1241 (R.I. 1990) (finding the Utica test persuasive); Roden v. Gen. Cas. Co. of Wisc., 671 N.W.2d 622, 627-28\r\n  (S.D. 2003) (noting a majority of the jurisdictions have adopted the four-part\r\n  test established in Utica and finding &quot;the four-part test set forth\r\n  above should be utilized in this jurisdiction when determining whether or not\r\n  an individual is 'occupying' the insured vehicle under the policy\r\n  definitions&quot;).\r\nIn Moherek\r\n  v. Tucker, 230 N.W.2d 148, 151-52 (Wis. 1975), the Supreme Court of\r\n  Wisconsin adopted a different test to determine whether an injured party was\r\n  &quot;occupying&quot; the vehicle.[9]Â \r\n  The test considered whether the party was vehicle-oriented or highway-oriented\r\n  at the time of the injury.Â  Id.; Kreuser by Kreuser v. Heritage Mut.\r\n    Ins. Co., 461 N.W.2d 806, 808 (Wis. Ct. App. 1990) (&quot;In Moherek,\r\n  the supreme court established a test to determine whether or not an injured\r\n  party was 'occupying' the vehicle. The test considers whether the party was\r\n  vehicle-oriented or highway-oriented at the time of the injury.&quot;).Â \r\n  &quot;[A] person has not ceased 'occupying' a vehicle until he has severed his\r\n  connection with it â€“ i.e., when he is on his own without any reference to it.Â \r\n  If he is still vehicle-oriented, as opposed to highway-oriented, he continues\r\n  to 'occupy' the vehicle.&quot;Â  Moherek, 230 N.W.2d at 151 (quoting Allstate\r\n    Ins. Co. v. Flaumenbaum, 308 N.Y.S.2d 447, 462 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1970)).Â  In Kreuser,\r\n  the court of appeals noted the &quot;vehicle-orientation&quot; test considers\r\n  the nature of the act engaged in at the time of the injury and the intent of\r\n  the person injured, and added a third consideration: whether the injured person\r\n  was within the reasonable geographical perimeter of the vehicle.Â  461 N.W.2d at\r\n  808.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn Wickham\r\n  v. Equity Fire and Casualty Co., 889 P.2d 1258, 1261 (Okl. Ct. App. 1994),\r\n  the Oklahoma Court of Appeals discussed the Kreuser and Utica tests and declined to adopt a bright-line test.Â  Instead, the court held that\r\n  &quot;the determination of whether the policy definition of 'occupying' is\r\n  satisfied should be left to a case-by-case analysis, depending on the\r\n  circumstances of the accident, the use of the vehicle, the relevant terms of\r\n  the coverage at issue, and any underlying public policy considerations.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  Therefore, the court found a man who was struck by another car while fixing the\r\n  tire on a car was &quot;occupying&quot; the vehicle.[10]Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nSimilarly, in United Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. v. Pierce,\r\n  283 N.E.2d 788, 791 (Ind. Ct. App. 1972), the Indiana Court of Appeals determined\r\n  that Pierce was &quot;upon&quot; his vehicle when he cut his hand on the fender\r\n  of his car because he was pushing on the front fender in an attempt to push it\r\n  out of the snow.[11]Â \r\n  The court noted &quot;[t]he majority of 'in or upon' cases appear to rely\r\n  primarily upon physical support.&quot;Â  Id. at 790.Â  Almost ten years\r\n  later, in Michigan Mutual Insurance Co. v. Combs, 446 N.E.2d 1001, 1007\r\n  (Ind. Ct. App. 1983), the court of appeals held the claimant, who was working\r\n  on the insured vehicle's engine and resting his knees on the bumper, was\r\n  &quot;upon&quot; the insured vehicle when he was hit by another vehicle.[12]Â  The court noted the application of\r\n  the &quot;physical contact&quot; rule relied upon in Pierce could unduly\r\n  restrict coverage in some factual settings and serve to expand coverage beyond\r\n  the contemplation of the contracting parties in other settings.Â  Id. at\r\n  1005.Â  The court also noted that in Robson v. Lightning Rod Mutual Insurance\r\n    Co., 393 N.E.2d 1053, 1055 (Ohio Ct. App. 1978), the Ohio Court of Appeals held\r\n  in cases in which a gray area existed concerning whether a person was &quot;in\r\n  or upon, entering into or alighting from&quot; an insured vehicle, the\r\n  determination of whether the vehicle was &quot;occupied&quot; should be based\r\n  on an analysis of the relationship between the vehicle and the claimant within\r\n  a reasonable geographic perimeter.Â  The Robson court also rejected the physical\r\n  contact rule.Â  Id.Â  However, in Combs, the court found that both the\r\n  physical contact rule and the Robson claimant-vehicle relationship\r\n  analysis supported coverage for the claimant because he was in physical contact\r\n  with the car and his actions evidenced a relationship with the vehicle and its\r\n  operation.Â  Combs, 446 N.E.2d at 1007. Â Â Â Â Â \r\nOther courts have declined to find coverage when, as in this case,\r\n  the injured person was not touching the insured vehicle at the time of the\r\n  accident.Â  In Rednour v. Hastings Mutual Insurance Co., 661 N.W.2d 562,\r\n  567 (Mich. 2003), Rednour argued he was &quot;upon&quot; a car when he was\r\n  pinned against it after being struck by another car.Â  Rednour admitted he was\r\n  not touching his friend's car and was approximately six inches from the car\r\n  when the other vehicle struck him.Â  Id. at 563.Â  The Michigan court\r\n  noted that &quot;physical contact by itself does not, however, establish that a\r\n  person is 'upon' a vehicle such that the person is 'occupying' the\r\n  vehicle.&quot;Â  Id. at 567.Â  The court held that under the policy's definition\r\n  of &quot;occupying,&quot; Rednour was not occupying the insured automobile when\r\n  he was injured.[13]Â  Id. at 568.Â  \r\nIn State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Farmers\r\n  Insurance Co., 569 S.W.2d 384, 384-85 (Mo. Ct. App. 1978), the insured was\r\n  beside his friend's car, walking towards the car door when another car\r\n  rear-ended the car. Â At the time of the impact, the insured was completely\r\n  outside the car and was not touching any part of the car; however, the force of\r\n  the impact moved the car and caused it to collide with the insured.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The court stated it found no cases in which the claimant's reason for being\r\n  outside the automobile was unrelated to the operation of the vehicle itself\r\n  that held the &quot;upon&quot; requirement was met when the claimant was not in\r\n  contact with the vehicle immediately prior to the accident.Â  Id. at\r\n  385-86.Â  Therefore, the court determined the insured was not\r\n  &quot;occupying&quot; the vehicle at the time of the accident and was not\r\n  covered by the insurance policy.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn Kelleher v. American Mutual Insurance Co. of Boston, 590\r\n  N.E.2d 1178, 1180 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992), Kelleher argued he was\r\n  &quot;occupying&quot; the insured vehicle when he was struck by another car\r\n  because he was &quot;upon&quot; the vehicle he had just exited.Â  The court\r\n  noted:\r\n\r\n\t[I]n determining whether a claimant is &quot;upon&quot; an insured\r\n  vehicle, courts have invariably required some physical contact with the\r\n  vehicle, or at a minimum, the performance of an act directly related to the\r\n  vehicle, such as the changing of a tire. Such a requirement is consistent with\r\n  the commonly understood definition of &quot;upon&quot;, that of &quot;on.&quot;\r\n\r\nId.Â  The court then determined:\r\n\r\n\t[N]o facts indicate[d] that Kelleher was either &quot;in,&quot;\r\n  &quot;upon,&quot; &quot;entering into&quot; or &quot;alighting from&quot; the\r\n  insured motor vehicle at the time he was struck; instead, the uncontroverted\r\n  facts demonstrate that the operation of the Larson vehicle had come to an end,\r\n  Kelleher had completed the act of leaving the vehicle, and he was approximately\r\n  four feet away from it when the accident occurred.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 1181.Â  Therefore, the court found\r\n  &quot;Kelleher had completely severed his relationship with the vehicle&quot;\r\n  and did not qualify as an insured under the policy.Â  Id. at 1180-81.Â  \r\nIn Miller v. Mabe, 947 S.W.2d 151, 154 (Tenn. Ct. App.\r\n  1997), the Tennessee court found that, at the time of the accident, Miller was\r\n  neither getting into the van nor getting out of it, and although he was\r\n  utilizing the lights from the van, he was not using the van itself at the time\r\n  of the accident.Â  Therefore, the court determined there was no &quot;causal\r\n  relation&quot; between Miller's use of the van and his being struck by Mabe's\r\n  vehicle.Â  Id.Â  Miller was standing in the middle of the road three or\r\n  four feet from his van, closer than the decedent in another case, but far\r\n  enough away that he could not be considered &quot;upon&quot; the vehicle.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Miller's attention was focused on using the limb to work the cable wire through\r\n  the tree branches and was not focused on his van; therefore, the activity was not\r\n  &quot;essential&quot; to the use of the van.Â  Id.Â  Consequently, under\r\n  the criteria established in Utica, Miller was not &quot;occupying&quot;\r\n  his work van at the time of his accident, and therefore, was not covered under\r\n  the uninsured motorist provision of his employer's policy.Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  reaching our decision in this case, we need not adopt a bright-line test, as\r\n  adopted by some foreign jurisdictions, because we can rely on the South\r\n  Carolina cases of Yensen and McAbee.Â  Therefore, based on Yensen and McAbee, we conclude the trial court in this case erred in finding\r\n  Kennedy was &quot;upon&quot; the manure truck when he was hit by the pickup\r\n  truck and momentarily pinned to the manure truck because he was not &quot;in,\r\n  upon, getting in, on, out or off&quot; the manure truck at the time of the\r\n  accident.Â  He had departed the truck, gone inside the restaurant, and returned\r\n  to the parking lot to talk to his half-brother near the vehicle when he was hit\r\n  by the pickup truck.Â  As a result, there was no causal connection between\r\n  Kennedy's use of the manure truck and his being struck by Counts' pickup\r\n  truck.Â  Hence, Kennedy was not occupying his employer's truck at the time of\r\n  the accident, and is not entitled to UIM coverage from his employer's policy. Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the trial court's order is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWILLIAMS and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Most of the facts of this case were stipulated in an\r\n  agreement entered into by the parties in May 2005.\r\n[2]&nbsp; In his order, Judge Saunders stated, &quot;There was\r\n  irrefutable testimony by eyewitnesses, [Kennedy], and medical documentation\r\n  that indicated [Kennedy] was momentarily pinned between the rear of the manure\r\n  truck and the rear of [Counts'] truck.Â  [Farm Bureau] presented no evidence to\r\n  dispute the fact that [Kennedy] was pinned against the manure truck and\r\n  therefore did not meet the scintilla of the evidence burden to make this a genuine\r\n  issue of material fact.&quot;\r\n[3] &nbsp;S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kennedy, Op.\r\n  No. 2006-UP-423 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 19, 2006).\r\n[4]&nbsp; During the trial, Kennedy's counsel stated, &quot;We\r\n  have never alleged that there was any collision from the Counts truck with the\r\n  manure truck. . . . [T]here was a collision in the Counts truck to [Kennedy's]\r\n  leg and momentarily pinned him against the manure truck.&quot;\r\n[5]&nbsp; Judge Hayes made the following findings of fact in\r\n  his order: (1) &quot;The engine to the insured vehicle [Kennedy] was driving was\r\n  running and a dog was inside&quot;; (2) &quot;[Kennedy], prior to the\r\n  collision, rested his hand on the insured vehicle&quot;; and (3) &quot;The\r\n  vehicle driven by George Counts pushed and momentarily pinned [Kennedy] against\r\n  the insured vehicle causing injury.&quot;Â  Kennedy testified the keys were\r\n  still in the ignition and his dog was in the truck.Â  Kennedy also testified\r\n  that he was leaning on the truck when he saw the pickup truck coming at him.Â \r\n  Then, he said he took his hand off the truck and ran from the pickup truck\r\n  before he was pinned to the manure truck by the pickup truck.Â  Robinson stated\r\n  in his deposition that he and Kennedy &quot;took out running&quot; when they saw\r\n  Counts' truck headed in their direction.Â  Robinson said he was hit first by\r\n  Counts' truck, so he did not see Kennedy get hit, but he did hear Kennedy\r\n  hollering in pain and saw him lying next to him on the ground. Ronald Long, who\r\n  witnessed the accident, testified that for a second it appeared Kennedy was\r\n  pinned between the pickup truck and the manure truck.\r\n[6]&nbsp; The Nationwide policy insured against injury\r\n  &quot;while in or upon, entering or alighting from&quot; the motor vehicle.Â  McAbee,\r\n  249 S.C. at 98, 152 S.E.2d at 732. \r\n[7] Â The policy in Whitmire defined\r\n  &quot;occupying&quot; as &quot;in or upon or entering into or alighting\r\n  from&quot; the insured vehicle.Â  Whitmire, 254 S.C. at 188, 174 S.E.2d\r\n  at 393.\r\n[8]Â  The Utica policy provided, &quot;'occupying'\r\n  means in or upon or entering into or alighting from.&quot;Â  Utica, 473\r\n  A.2d at 1008.\r\n[9] Â The policy in Moherek defined\r\n  &quot;occupying&quot; as &quot;in or upon, entering into or alighting\r\n  from&quot; the insured vehicle.Â  Moherek, 230 N.W.2d at 149.\r\n[10]Â  The Equity policy defined &quot;occupying&quot; as\r\n  &quot;in, on, getting in or on, or getting off or out of&quot; the insured\r\n  vehicle.

Geathers, Administrative Law\r\n  Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4739\r\nHeard May 19, 2010 â€“ Filed September 15,\r\n  2010Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry McMaster, Assistant Attorney General J.C.\r\n  Nicholson, III, Assistant Attorney General Natalie Armstrong, all of Columbia,\r\n  for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tChristian Stegmaier, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.:Â  The\r\n  South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) appeals an order from the\r\n  Administrative Law Court (ALC) finding (1) Respondent Margaret O'Shea did not\r\n  have to be licensed as a private investigator in order to work as a court\r\n  appointed mitigation specialist on death penalty cases and (2) the files in\r\n  O'Shea's possession were not subject to SLED's review because they were\r\n  protected by the work product doctrine.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn 2001, following a thirty-year career as an\r\n  investigative reporter covering high profile stories and court cases, O'Shea began\r\n  working as a death penalty mitigation specialist. Â Based on advice that a\r\n  professional license would be a good credential for obtaining work in her new\r\n  field, she applied to SLED for a private investigator's license.\r\nCurrently, there are about six individuals doing death\r\n  penalty mitigation work, four or five of which are licensed as private\r\n  investigators.Â  According to O'Shea, her work as a death penalty mitigation\r\n  specialist includes: compiling social histories, gathering documents and other\r\n  information, interviewing family members of clients and other individuals, and\r\n  analyzing the material she acquires to help attorneys for capital defendants\r\n  develop strategies.Â  Although her work is geared toward the penalty phase of a\r\n  capital case, she occasionally participates in the guilt phase.Â  She rarely, if\r\n  ever, testifies.\r\nO'Shea described herself as &quot;self-employed,&quot;\r\n  with death penalty mitigation work as her primary job.Â  She is usually contacted\r\n  directly by an attorney desiring her services. Â If she agrees to take the case,\r\n  counsel then requests the presiding judge to appoint her.Â  She charges by the\r\n  hour according to the fee approved by the presiding judge.Â  The approved fees are\r\n  paid by the Office of Indigent Defense.Â  It is undisputed that O'Shea does not\r\n  work exclusively for any one attorney or law firm. Â Nevertheless, she considers\r\n  herself part of each defense litigation team that uses her services.\r\nIn 2007, after she had worked as a death penalty\r\n  mitigation specialist for about six years, O'Shea was unable to renew her\r\n  private investigator's license because of financial problems resulting mainly\r\n  from medical problems that prevented her from working.Â  As a result, her\r\n  license lapsed on September 16, 2007.Â  When she was able to resume working, she\r\n  did not renew her license; however, she notified SLED that she was working on\r\n  only one case and was not gathering any new information.\r\nLater, however, a SLED agent contacted O'Shea to\r\n  arrange an inspection of her records, explaining this was a routine procedure\r\n  that should have been done every two years.[1]Â \r\n  O'Shea initially intended to comply with the request until SLED demanded access\r\n  to all of her records for the past year.Â  O'Shea refused to comply with this demand\r\n  because of the volume of paper involved.Â  She contacted the attorneys with whom\r\n  she had worked in the past year, all of whom took the position that the files\r\n  in her possession belonged to counsel and were protected by the work product\r\n  doctrine.Â  O'Shea offered to provide invoices with names redacted, but SLED did\r\n  not respond to this offer.\r\nOn October 24, 2007, O'Shea applied to renew her\r\n  license. Â SLED refused to authorize the renewal for several reasons, among them\r\n  O'Shea's prior refusal to allow an inspection of her records.Â  In December\r\n  2007, O'Shea, now represented by counsel, filed this action in the ALC, seeking\r\n  an order directing SLED to renew her license or, in the alternative, an order\r\n  declaring that death penalty mitigation specialists were not subject to the\r\n  licensure requirements that applied to private investigators.\r\nThe ALC heard the matter on April 24, 2008, and issued\r\n  a final order on June 4, 2008, holding (1) O'Shea was not required to be\r\n  licensed as a private investigator in order to work as a death penalty\r\n  mitigation specialist; (2) regardless of whether any licensing requirements\r\n  applied to O'Shea, the files in her possession were protected by the attorney\r\n  work product doctrine; (3) SLED needed to obtain a court order to inspect an\r\n  individual's files while investigating whether that person is operating a\r\n  private investigation business without a license if the subject asserts the\r\n  files are privileged; and (4) because O'Shea did not need a private\r\n  investigator's license to work as a death penalty mitigation specialist, there\r\n  was no need for SLED to review the files in her possession.Â  Following an\r\n  unsuccessful attempt to alter or amend the ALC's decision, SLED filed its\r\n  notice of appeal.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the ALC err in finding O'Shea\r\n  did not have to be licensed as a private investigator because she worked as a\r\n  death penalty mitigation specialist?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the ALC err in holding\r\n  O'Shea's files were entitled to protection under the work product doctrine?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  standard of review for judicial review of a final decision of an ALC is set\r\n  forth in section 1-23-610 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009).Â  Under\r\n  Paragraph (B) of this section, \r\n\r\n\tThe review of the administrative law judge's order must be\r\n  confined to the record. The court may not substitute its judgment for the\r\n  judgment of the administrative law judge as to the weight of the evidence on\r\n  questions of fact. The court of appeals may affirm the decision or remand the\r\n  case for further proceedings; or, it may reverse or modify the decision if the\r\n  substantive rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the finding,\r\n  conclusion, or decision is:\r\n\t(a) in violation of constitutional or\r\n  statutory provisions; \r\n\t(b) in excess of the statutory authority\r\n  of the agency; \r\n\t(c) made upon unlawful procedure; \r\n\t(d) affected by other error of law; \r\n\t(e) clearly erroneous in view of the\r\n  reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or \r\n\t(f) arbitrary or capricious or\r\n  characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of\r\n  discretion. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Licensing Requirements\r\nSLED\r\n  challenges the ALC's ruling that O'Shea did not need to be licensed as a\r\n  private investigator in order to work as a death penalty mitigation specialist,\r\n  arguing the court misinterpreted portions of the statutory law on licensing and\r\n  registration requirements for private investigators.Â  We disagree.\r\nChapter\r\n  18 of Title 40 of the South Carolina Code is entitled &quot;Private Security\r\n  and Investigation Agencies.&quot;Â  Under this chapter, &quot;[a] person who\r\n  desires to operate a private investigation business in this State must apply\r\n  for a Private Investigation License from SLED and pay an annual license fee\r\n  which must be set by SLED regulation.&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-18-70(A) (Supp.\r\n  2009). Â Under section 40-18-140(3), however, the provisions of Chapter 18 do\r\n  not apply to &quot;an attorney-at-law while in the performance of his\r\n  duties.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  ALC relied on section 40-18-140(3) in ruling O'Shea did not need to be licensed\r\n  as a private investigator in order to work as a death penalty mitigation\r\n  specialist.Â  Citing ABA Guidelines, law review articles, and other authority,\r\n  the court noted (1) a mitigation specialist is recognized as an essential component\r\n  of a capital defense team and (2) the mitigation specialist's only role is to\r\n  assist attorneys in the defense of death penalty cases.Â  Based on this recognition,\r\n  the ALC reasoned that in her work as a death penalty mitigation specialist, O'Shea\r\n  was acting as an agent of the attorney representing the capital defendant and\r\n  her performance would be monitored by extensive judicial oversight.Â  Though acknowledging\r\n  O'Shea's work was on a case-by-case basis, the ALC nevertheless found she was\r\n  no less an agent of defense counsel, who requested her appointment, than a\r\n  salaried paralegal, investigator, or associate.Â  Based on the finding that\r\n  O'Shea was acting as an agent for defense counsel while performing her duties\r\n  as a mitigation specialist, the ALC found she was exempt from the licensing\r\n  requirements of Chapter 18 pursuant to section 40-18-140(3).\r\nIn challenging\r\n  this ruling, SLED argues only that the ALC failed to consider section\r\n  40-18-80(D) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009).[2] This paragraph provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tA person is exempt from the registration\r\n  and licensing requirements of this section when the employer is not a\r\n  private investigation business and the employee is exclusively employed by that\r\n  employer. Â The exemption from registration and licensing requirements applies\r\n  only to work performed for the exclusive employer. Â If the person, during the\r\n  period of his exclusive employment, performs or is available to perform\r\n  investigative work for a different employer or more than one employer, the\r\n  person must obtain a private investigation license or registration pursuant to \r\n\tthis\r\n    section.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\n  Â A careful examination of section 40-18-80, however, reveals there are no\r\n  licensing requirements whatsoever within that section.Â  Therefore, under section 40-18-80(D), an individual\r\n  performing private investigation work for a single employer is exempt from\r\n  registration requirements.Â  The question before us is one of licensing and not\r\n  registration.Â  This section is therefore not applicable here.\r\nThe inclusion of\r\n  the term &quot;licensing requirements&quot; in the first sentence of section\r\n  40-18-80(D) could suggest the legislature intended that the exemption in\r\n  section 40-18-80(D) would apply to registration and licensing requirements within\r\n  Chapter 18 rather than within only section 40-18-80.Â  Nevertheless, the\r\n  appearance of the word &quot;chapter&quot; elsewhere in several statutes within\r\n  Chapter 18â€”including section 40-18-80 itselfâ€”indicates otherwise, i.e., that\r\n  the legislature intended for the exemption in section 40-18-80 to be only from\r\n  whatever registration or licensing requirements were provided within that\r\n  particular section rather than other sections within Chapter 18.Â  Because, as\r\n  we have stated earlier, section 40-18-80(D) includes only registration provisions,\r\n  it follows that, regardless of whether it overrides any exemption O'Shea could\r\n  claim under section 40-18-140(3), it does not subject her to any licensing requirements.\r\nIn\r\n  holding section 40-18-80(D) does not subject individuals who perform\r\n  investigatory work for multiple law firms to any specific licensing\r\n  requirements, we are following the established principle that &quot;[w]here [a]\r\n  statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite\r\n  meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has\r\n  no right to impose another meaning.&quot;Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C.\r\n  79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  Here, although section 40-18-80(D) references\r\n  licensing requirements within the section, we do not believe the incongruity between\r\n  this reference and the absence of any such requirements within the defined\r\n  language presents a sufficient basis to reject the plain meaning of the statute\r\n  in its present form on the ground that it would lead to an absurd result.Â  See Kiriakides v. United Artists Commc'ns, 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d\r\n  364, 366 (1994) (stating courts will reject the plain meaning of the language\r\n  in a statutory provision &quot;when to accept it would lead to a result so\r\n  plainly absurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature\r\n  or would defeat the plain legislative intention&quot;).\r\nII.&nbsp; Work Product\r\n  Doctrine\r\nThe issue of whether O'Shea's files are protected by the work\r\n  product doctrine arose in the context of whether they were subject to\r\n  inspection by SLED as part of O'Shea's application to have her private\r\n  investigator's license reinstated.Â  Because we have determined that O'Shea is\r\n  not required to be licensed as a private investigator in order to work as a\r\n  death penalty mitigation specialist, a ruling on this issue is not necessary in\r\n  deciding this appeal.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not\r\n  address remaining issues when a decision on a prior issue is dispositive).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the ALC's determination that O'Shea is not required to be licensed as a\r\n  private investigator in order to work as a death penalty mitigation\r\n  specialist.Â  Because this affirmance renders any ruling on the applicability of\r\n  the work product doctrine unnecessary to the resolution of this appeal, we\r\n  decline to address this issue.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  In its brief, SLED indicates that, pursuant to its\r\n  protocol, a lapsed license automatically triggers a field visit by a SLED\r\n  regulatory agent to the private investigator's office to inspect the\r\n  investigator's file.\r\n[2]Â  During oral argument, counsel for SLED acknowledged\r\n  SLED did not dispute the ALC's determination that section 40-18-140(3) exempts\r\n  not only attorneys but also their employees from licensing requirements and\r\n  further conceded that an investigator who worked for only one law firm did not\r\n  need a private investigator's license.Â  Moreover, we agree with the ALC that\r\n  the legislature has recognized, at least implicitly, that an individual\r\n  performing investigatory duties under the supervision of an attorney does not\r\n  need a private investigator's license.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-18-70(E)(9)(b)\r\n  (Supp. 2009) (allowing SLED to issue a private investigator's license to a\r\n  person who &quot;has at least three years' experience . . . as an investigator\r\n  for a law firm . . .&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4740","title":"McNair v.

Â Although the\r\n  lease does not state a rental amount, the parties agree United Energy was to\r\n  pay rent of $500 per month during the initial lease term.[1]Â  \r\nRegarding\r\n  the duration of the arrangement and the rent to be paid, the lease provides as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n\t4.Â  The term of this lease shall commence on July 1,\r\n  2002, and extend for a period of five years from that date, together with the\r\n  right to renew said lease for three additional five-year periods upon the\r\n  condition that upon each of said renewals, the monthly rent shall be increased\r\n  by 10% of the monthly rent of the preceding period.Â  Such rental shall be paid\r\n  monthly and in advance and, in the event of a failure of the Lessee to pay any\r\n  monthly rent for a period of thirty (30) days after having been notified by the\r\n  Lessor that the rent was in default, the Lessor shall have the right to declare\r\n  the lease forfeited and terminated by the Lessee.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  lease includes the following provision regarding termination:\r\n\r\n\t5. Â Lessee shall have the right to terminate this\r\n  lease at any time by giving written notice to the Lessor of Lessee's election\r\n  to terminate and upon the giving of such notice Lessee shall have no further\r\n  liability or obligation of any kind to Lessor hereunder except as follows:\r\n  Lessee shall be liable for the payment of the monthly rental for the time\r\n  remaining in the then-current five year period.\r\n\r\nJames\r\n  McNair died on October 19, 2004, and McNair inherited the property.Â  In 2005,\r\n  McNair began receiving the monthly rental payments of $500 from United Energy.Â \r\n  McNair, however, believed the fair market rental value of the property was\r\n  $5,000 per month and claimed to have received an offer to lease the property for\r\n  $3,500 per month.\r\nOn\r\n  July 3, 2007, after the end of the first five-year lease term, United Energy\r\n  paid McNair $500 in rent.Â  By letter dated July 12, 2007, McNair's attorney advised\r\n  United Energy that the lease had expired and it was now a holdover tenant.Â  The\r\n  letter further instructed United Energy to vacate the premises before the end\r\n  of the month or renegotiate the lease.Â  By letter dated July 17, 2007, counsel\r\n  for United Energy advised McNair's attorney that his client had exercised its\r\n  right to extend the lease for an additional five-year period.Â  Acknowledging\r\n  that the rent was to increase by ten percent upon extension of the lease,\r\n  counsel enclosed a check of $50 to McNair as additional rent and advised in a\r\n  letter sent with the payment that it was &quot;made within the time allowed (30\r\n  days) to cure.&quot;Â  Counsel for McNair responded by returning the check for\r\n  the additional rent to United Energy's attorney along with a letter advising\r\n  that McNair would begin eviction proceedings after August 1, 2007.\r\nOn\r\n  August 20, 2007, McNair filed an application for ejectment with the summary\r\n  court for Aiken County.Â  In his application, he asserted the rental term had\r\n  ended.Â  A magistrate heard the matter the following month, and on October 3,\r\n  2007, she issued an order holding (1) the lease unambiguously contained an\r\n  option for the lessee to renew the lease but (2) the lease expired on June 30,\r\n  2007, because United Energy had not taken any affirmative action to exercise\r\n  its option.Â  The magistrate further held she lacked jurisdiction to entertain\r\n  the equitable defenses United Energy sought to present at the hearing.\r\nUnited\r\n  Energy appealed the magistrate's order, and the circuit court heard the matter\r\n  on January 8, 2008.Â  The circuit court later issued an order reversing the\r\n  magistrate's refusal to adjudicate the equitable matters that United Energy\r\n  raised and ordered a trial de novo in the magistrate's court.\r\nOn\r\n  August 7, 2008, the matter came before another magistrate for a second\r\n  hearing.Â  A few days later, the magistrate issued an order holding (1) the\r\n  lease includes an option to renew, (2) United Energy demonstrated its intent to\r\n  continue the lease arrangement beyond the initial five-year term by spending\r\n  more than $600,000 on improvements, and (3) based on Kiriakides v. United\r\n    Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364 (1994), United\r\n  Energy had exercised its option to renew the lease.\r\nMcNair\r\n  appealed the magistrate's decision to the circuit court, which heard the matter\r\n  and affirmed the magistrate's order, holding (1) United Energy renewed the\r\n  lease for a second five-year term, (2) the lease did not expire on June 30,\r\n  2007, and (3) the magistrate properly relied on Kiriakides as the\r\n  controlling authority.Â  McNair appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nWhereas the circuit court maintains a broad scope of\r\n  review in deciding an appeal of a magistrate's order, this court, when\r\n  reviewing the circuit court's adjudication of an appeal of an ejectment\r\n  proceeding in magistrate's court, does so under a more limited standard, under\r\n  which (1) findings of fact are to be upheld if there is any supporting evidence\r\n  and (2) absent an error of law, the circuit court's holding is to be affirmed.Â  Bowers v. Thomas, 373 S.C. 240, 244, 644 S.E.2d 751, 753 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).Â  Moreover, as with any other appeal before this court, the respondent\r\n  may argue any additional reasons why we should affirm the appealed ruling,\r\n  &quot;regardless of whether those reasons have been presented to or ruled on by\r\n  the lower court.&quot;Â  I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C.\r\n  406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000).Â  This court may in its discretion review\r\n  the additional reasons presented by the respondent and &quot;if convinced it is\r\n  proper and fair to do so, rely on them or any other reason appearing in the\r\n    record to affirm the lower court's judgment.&quot;Â  Id. at 420, 526\r\n  S.E.2d at 723 (emphasis added).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, McNair alleges the circuit court erred in (1) rewriting the parties'\r\n  contract to make it a twenty-year lease instead of a five-year lease with an\r\n  option for three renewals, (2) ignoring pertinent statutory authority\r\n  concerning the expiration of a tenancy of a term of years, (3) applying case\r\n  law concerning a tenant's default in paying rent rather than a decision\r\n  concerning a tenant's attempt to exercise an option to continue the lease\r\n  beyond the purported end of the lease period, and (4) considering parol\r\n  evidence and equitable defenses.Â  We hold none of these arguments provides\r\n  sufficient reason to reverse the circuit court's decision.\r\nI.&nbsp; Rental Term\r\nCiting Cotter\r\n  v. James L. Tapp Co., 267 S.C. 647, 230 S.E.2d 715 (1976), and other cases\r\n  concerning option contracts, McNair argues that in order to exercise its right\r\n  to renew the lease for a second term, United Energy was required to tender the increased\r\n  rent for July 2007 on or before June 30, 2007, the date the initial lease term\r\n  was scheduled to expire.Â  McNair correctly points out the lease in the present\r\n  case expressly provides for an initial term of five years with the right to\r\n  renew for three additional five-year periods. Â We disagree, however, with the\r\n  suggestion that the provisions in the lease regarding the terms under which the\r\n  lessee can exercise this right are not distinguishable from corresponding\r\n  provisions in the lease at issue in Cotter.\r\nCotter concerned a lease with two options: (1) a five-year option for the tenant to\r\n  lease additional space and (2) a renewal option under which the tenant could\r\n  renew the first option &quot;for an additional three years 'upon the payment by\r\n  tenant of thirty cents ($0.30) per sq. ft. per year for said expansion area,\r\n  payable monthly as an option cost.' &quot; Â Id. at 650, 230 S.E.2d at\r\n  716.Â  The central dispute was whether the tenant had exercised the renewal\r\n  option merely by giving written notice to the landlord without paying the stated\r\n  option cost.Â  Id. at 651, 230 S.E.2d at 716-17.Â  Holding notice alone\r\n  was insufficient to exercise the option to renew, the court adhered to the rule\r\n  that &quot;if the option requires performance in a certain manner, time is of\r\n  the essence and exact compliance with the terms of the option [is]\r\n  required.&quot;Â  Id. at 653, 230 S.E.2d 717-18.\r\nHere, however, the only provisions concerning conditions to be\r\n  fulfilled before the termination of any lease period appear in Paragraph Five\r\n  of the lease.Â  Under this paragraph, United Energy has the right to &quot;terminate\r\n  this lease at any time&quot; upon written notice to McNair; however, it remains\r\n  responsible &quot;for the payment of the monthly rental for the time remaining\r\n  in the then-current five year period.&quot;Â  Therefore, under the terms of this\r\n  lease, the burden is then on United Energy to notify McNair only if it intends\r\n  to terminate at the end of a five-year term rather than to give notice to\r\n  McNair if it intends to extend the lease beyond the end of that term.Â  In the\r\n  event United Energy desires to renew for an additional term, the lease provides\r\n  that the monthly rent is increased upon the renewal for an additional term, not\r\n  that renewal is contingent on United Energy's tender of increased rent before\r\n  the end of the initial term of the lease. Â In other words, whereas the renewal\r\n  option at issue in Cotter could be exercised &quot;upon payment by the tenant&quot; of the option cost, the lease in the present case expressly\r\n  provides for an increase in the monthly rent only &quot;upon each of said\r\n  renewals.&quot;Â  Furthermore, because the lease does not require advance notice\r\n  or satisfaction of any other conditions before the expiration of the initial\r\n  term, we hold United Energy's continued occupation of the premises was\r\n  sufficient to keep the lease in effect for an additional term.Â  See 49\r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Landlord and Tenant, Â§ 166, at 186 (2006) (&quot;Where there\r\n  is a general privilege to extend a lease, holding over by a tenant may be\r\n  sufficient, even without any notice to the lessor, to extend the lease under\r\n  the option.&quot;); 52 C.J.S. Landlord and Tenant Â§ 111, at 174 (2003)\r\n  (&quot;[W]here the lease requires no notice, an option to extend or renew may\r\n  be exercised by holding over, without any notice being given by the\r\n  tenant.&quot;).Â  \r\nFurthermore, assuming without deciding that McNair is correct that\r\n  United Energy could exercise its renewal option only by the payment of the\r\n  increased rent before the expiration of the current lease term, we believe the\r\n  record supports a determination that United Energy fulfilled this requirement.Â \r\n  This determination is based on our re-examination of the record in view of\r\n  representations by counsel for McNair during oral argument.\r\nThis\r\n  court requested counsel for McNair to support his client's position that the lease\r\n  requires United Energy to tender the increased rent before the end of the\r\n  initial lease term to renew the lease for a second term.Â  In response, counsel directed\r\n  the court's attention to the stated consideration in the lease of $500 cash in\r\n  hand that had already been paid to James McNair when the parties executed the\r\n  lease, explaining that these funds were to be applied toward the rent for July\r\n  2002, the first month during the lease term.Â  According to the ledger included\r\n  in the record, however, United Energy made an additional payment of $500 before\r\n  the early part of July 2002 as well as for each succeeding month thereafter\r\n  through June 2007.Â  From this schedule we further conclude: (1) on June 7,\r\n  2007, United Energy paid McNair $500 and McNair accepted the payment; (2) as of\r\n  June 30, 2007, the last day of the initial lease term, United Energy paid $500 more\r\n  than what it owed on the lease at that time; (3) although as of July 1, 2007, United\r\n  Energy owed $50 in rent because of the increase that took effect after the renewal\r\n  of the lease for a second term, it made an additional payment of $500 that was\r\n  accepted by McNair during the first week of July 2007; and (4) therefore, by\r\n  July 12, 2007, the date McNair gave notice that he considered the lease to have\r\n  expired, United Energy had paid McNair $450 in excess of what was due for July\r\n  2007.Â  Under these circumstances, we hold McNair's own actions indicate he did\r\n  not view the $50 that United Energy owed as of July 1, 2007, as a fatal defect\r\n  in United Energy's exercise of its option to renew the lease for a second\r\n  term.Â  Cf. J.R. Kemper, Annotation, Necessity for Payment or Tender\r\n    of Purchase Money Within Option Period in Order to Exercise Option, in Absence\r\n    of Specific Time Requirement for Payment, 71 A.L.R. 3d 1201, 1215 (1976)\r\n  (noting courts have held that payment or tender is not necessarily a condition\r\n  precedent to the optionee's exercise of an option if the parties to the option\r\n  agreement had &quot;by their own actions or conduct, indicated that such was\r\n  also their interpretation and understanding&quot;).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  in the same section of the lease that requires the rental increase upon renewal\r\n  of a five-year term is language that grants United Energy thirty days to cure a\r\n  default after it has been notified by McNair that it is in arrears.Â  As\r\n  indicated above, we find that although the lease provides the monthly rent\r\n  would increase by ten percent in the event of a renewal for an additional term,\r\n  this increase is not, under the terms of the parties' agreement, a condition\r\n  precedent for the renewal to take effect.Â  United Energy's payment of the $50\r\n  increase within the thirty-day period following notice from McNair's attorney to\r\n  vacate the premises or renegotiate the lease is therefore in compliance with\r\n  the terms of the parties' agreement.Â  See Litchfield Co. of S.C. v.\r\n    Kiriakides, 290 S.C. 220, 225, 349 S.E.2d 344, 347 (Ct. App. 1986)\r\n  (&quot;Because the lease set[s] forth the acts which would result in default,\r\n  and the mode of terminating the tenancy, the parties' rights are to be\r\n  determined by a fair construction of the contract, not by statutory ejectment principles.&quot;)\r\n  (citing Biber v. Dillingham, 111 S.C. 502, 504, 98 S.E.2d 798, 799\r\n  (1919)).\r\nII.&nbsp; Statutory Law\r\nMcNair also contends the circuit court erred in disregarding\r\n  section 27-35-110 of the South Carolina Code (2007), arguing that under this\r\n  statute, the absence in the lease of any notice requirement for renewal beyond\r\n  the initial five-year term is of no effect.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder section 27-35-110, &quot;[w]hen there is an express\r\n  agreement, either oral or written, as to the term of the tenancy of a tenant for\r\n  a term or for years such tenancy shall end without notice upon the last day of\r\n  the agreed term.&quot;Â  In this case, the lease was to &quot;extend for a\r\n  period of five years&quot; from July 1, 2002, the date the term commenced;\r\n  however, the lease further allows for renewal for three additional five-year\r\n  rental periods.Â  United Energy's tenancy, then, would have ended on &quot;the\r\n  last day of the agreed term&quot; only if it did not renew the lease for an\r\n  additional term.Â  See Jordan v. Sec. Group, 311 S.C. 227, 230,\r\n  428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993) (&quot;Where the language of a contract is plain and\r\n  capable of legal construction, that language alone determines the\r\n  instrument's force and effect.&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  Because we have\r\n  determined the lease was renewed for a second term pursuant to the terms of the\r\n  parties' agreement, United Energy's tenancy did not automatically end pursuant\r\n  to section 27-35-110.\r\n\r\nIII.&nbsp; Remaining\r\n  Issues\r\nMcNair also contends the circuit court incorrectly applied case\r\n  law concerning a tenant's default in paying rent rather than case law\r\n  concerning the exercise of an option and should not have considered parol\r\n  evidence and equitable defenses.Â  Because\r\n  any determination of the merits of these arguments would not affect our holding\r\n  that United Energy had exercised its option to renew the lease according to the\r\n  lease terms, we decline to address them.Â  See Futch v. McAllister\r\n    Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999)\r\n  (stating an appellate court need not discuss remaining issues if the\r\n  disposition of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold\r\n  the parties' lease did not end on the stated date for the termination of the\r\n  initial lease term based on our determination that United Energy's actions were\r\n  sufficient to renew the lease for an additional term.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nFEW, C.J.,\r\n  concurs.Â  PIEPER, J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., concurring:\r\nI\r\n  concur in the majority opinion.Â  I write separately only to clarify for the\r\n  bench and bar what I see as a continued misconception about the authority of\r\n  magistrates to determine equitable defenses that may arise from time to time in\r\n  matters otherwise properly within their jurisdiction.Â  Pursuant to section\r\n  22-3-10 of the South Carolina Code (2007), magistrates have concurrent civil\r\n  jurisdiction &quot;in all matters between landlord and tenant and the\r\n  possession of land. . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§22-3-10(10) (2007).Â  The State\r\n  Constitution of 1868 provided &quot;[t]hat justice may be administered in a\r\n  uniform mode of pleading without distinction between law and equity,&quot; thus\r\n  abolishing the historical distinction between courts of law and courts of\r\n  chancery.Â  See S.C. Const. of 1868, art. V, Â§ 3, reprinted in S.C. Code Vol. I (1922); see also Rule 2, SCRCP (&quot;There shall be\r\n  one form of action to be known as 'civil action.'&quot;).Â  Despite the merger\r\n  of courts of law and equity, magistrates were still constitutionally prohibited\r\n  from deciding equitable cases until more than a century later.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Const. art. V, Â§ 21 (1962), amended by S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 26 (1973)\r\n  (&quot;Magistrates shall have jurisdiction in such civil cases as the General\r\n  Assembly may prescribe:Â  Provided, such jurisdiction shall not extend .\r\n  . . to cases in chancery.&quot;) (emphasis in original).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1973, the General Assembly ratified an amendment rewriting Article 5 of the\r\n  South Carolina Constitution.Â  See Act No. 132, 1973 S.C. Acts 161-166.Â \r\n  The constitutional prohibition against magistrates deciding cases in equity was\r\n  removed and replaced by a shortened provision entrusting magistrate court\r\n  jurisdiction solely to the General Assembly.Â  See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§\r\n  26 (&quot;The General Assembly shall provide for [magistrates'] terms of office\r\n  and their civil and criminal jurisdiction.&quot;).Â  Today, there are no longer\r\n  any constitutional or statutory provisions that prohibit magistrates from\r\n  deciding equitable defenses.Â  Although I concur with the majority that we need\r\n  not address the application of any equitable defenses, I merely wish to clarify\r\n  that the magistrate had jurisdiction to consider United Energy's equitable\r\n  defenses because these defenses arose as part of the dispute between a landlord\r\n  and a tenant, which is within the jurisdiction of the magistrate court pursuant\r\n  to section 22-3-10.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 22-3-10(10).Â  \r\nAs\r\n  the sixteen-time world heavyweight wrestling champion Ric Flair once said,\r\n  &quot;Space Mountain may be the oldest ride in the park, but it has the longest\r\n  line.&quot;Â  The same holds true for equity.Â  For justice to be rendered in\r\n  cases properly before a magistrate, equitable and legal principles must\r\n  &quot;ride together&quot; and be applied according to applicable established\r\n  principles.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Paragraph Two of the lease describes the use to be\r\n  made of the premises &quot;for consideration paid and the monthly rental hereinafter specified,&quot; but no monthly rental appears in any of the eight paragraphs\r\n  following Paragraph Two.

Prince, the beneficiary and owner of the policy, appeals the trial\r\n  court's grant of summary judgment to Liberty Life Insurance Company, finding\r\n  the statute of limitations barred the action.Â  Prince argues his cause of action\r\n  as beneficiary could not have accrued until the insured died and the fact that\r\n  he is also the owner of the policy does not change that.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1986, Prince\r\n  obtained an insurance policy in the amount of $100,000 on the life of his\r\n  brother from Argus Life Insurance Company.Â  The following year, Prince took out\r\n  a second policy in the amount of $800,000 on the life of his brother from\r\n  Argus.Â  Prince was the owner and beneficiary under both policies.Â  Liberty\r\n  subsequently assumed the billing, collection, and claims payment\r\n  responsibilities for both policies.\r\n In June 1997,\r\n  Prince mailed Liberty checks to pay the premiums for each policy.[1]Â \r\n  On July 1, 1997, Liberty sent Prince a letter returning both checks and stating\r\n  both policies lapsed in 1996; the $100,000 policy had lapsed because it lost\r\n  all value once it was overloaned, and the $800,000 policy lapsed for nonpayment\r\n  of premiums.Â  After a series of correspondence between Liberty and Prince,\r\n  Liberty brought a declaratory judgment action in 1999 against Prince and a\r\n  creditor/assignee of the $800,000 policy pertaining only to that policy.Â \r\n  Prince counterclaimed for reinstatement of the policy, asserting Liberty had\r\n  failed to properly notify him the policy was about to lapse.Â  Prince ultimately\r\n  prevailed, and Liberty reinstated his policy after he paid the back premiums.\r\nOn February 3, 2003,\r\n  Prince requested Liberty reinstate the $100,000 policy as well.Â  Liberty\r\n  refused to reinstate the policy, informing Prince the statute of limitations\r\n  had expired on any claim regarding the policy.Â  On August 6, 2003, Prince's\r\n  brother died.Â  On December 7, 2005, Prince brought a cause of action against\r\n  Liberty contending it wrongfully terminated the $100,000 policy and seeking\r\n  reinstatement of the policy upon payment of back premiums.Â  Liberty answered\r\n  contending the statute of limitations had run, barring the claim.\r\nOn\r\n  February 21, 2009, Liberty moved for summary judgment asserting the statute of\r\n  limitations barred the action.Â  Liberty also maintained the claim was a\r\n  compulsory counterclaim in the action regarding the $800,000 policy and\r\n  Prince's failure to raise the claim during that cause of action waived the claim.Â \r\n  Prince opposed summary judgment arguing his cause of action as beneficiary did\r\n  not exist until his brother died in 2003, and thus, the statute of limitations\r\n  did not bar his cause of action filed in 2005.\r\nFollowing\r\n  a hearing on the motion, the trial court granted Liberty summary judgment\r\n  solely on the ground the statute of limitations had lapsed.Â  The court found\r\n  Prince's cause of action accrued no later than July 1997.Â  The trial court\r\n  found because Prince's claim as owner of the policy was barred once the statute\r\n  of limitations expired in 2000, when the insured died in 2003, Prince had no\r\n  benefits to convey to himself as beneficiary.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe purpose of\r\n  summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases not requiring the\r\n  services of a fact finder.&nbsp; George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548\r\n  S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).&nbsp; When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment\r\n  motion, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under\r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as\r\n  to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\r\n  of law.&nbsp; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860\r\n  (2002).&nbsp; In determining whether a genuine issue of fact exists, the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from it must be viewed in the\r\n  light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Sauner v. Pub. Serv.\r\n    Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).&nbsp; \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPrince contends the\r\n  trial court erred finding the action was barred by the statute of limitations and\r\n  his right as beneficiary to challenge the cancellation of the policy was no\r\n  better than the right he had as owner to challenge the cancellation.Â  He maintains\r\n  this was error because his claim as beneficiary did not accrue until his\r\n  brother's death and he brought this claim within three years of that.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nAn action for breach of contract\r\n  must be commenced within three years.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(1) (2005).Â \r\n  Under &quot;the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when a\r\n  cause of action reasonably ought to have been discovered.&quot;Â  Dean v.\r\n    Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 363, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996). Â The\r\n  discovery rule applies to breach of contract actions.Â  Santee Portland\r\n    Cement Co. v. Daniel Int'l Corp., 299 S.C. 269, 273, 384 S.E.2d 693, 695\r\n  (1989), overruled on other grounds by Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs.,\r\n    Inc. v. Crane Nat'l Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 462\r\n  S.E.2d 858 (1995).\r\nWhen an insured\r\n  reserves the right in his policy to change the beneficiary, the named\r\n  beneficiary does not have a vested right during the insured's lifetime.Â  Horne\r\n    v. Gulf Life Ins. Co.,&nbsp;277 S.C. 336, 338, 287 S.E.2d 144,\r\n  146&nbsp;(1982).Â  &quot;Instead, the named beneficiary has a mere expectancy;\r\n  the complete control of the policy remains in the insured.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  In Shuler v. Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, 184\r\n  S.C. 485, 491, 193 S.E. 46, 48 (1937), the supreme court found the\r\n  beneficiary's bringing of an action while the insured was still alive was\r\n  premature because the beneficiary could still be changed.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  &quot;[w]hen an insurance policy does not reserve to the insured the right to\r\n  change the beneficiary, 'the beneficiary, upon the issuance of the policy,\r\n  acquires a vested interest\r\n  in the proceeds of the insurance when available according to the terms of the\r\n  policy, which cannot be divested by any act of the insured.'&quot; Â Waters\r\n    v. S. Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co., 365 S.C. 519, 523, 617 S.E.2d 385,\r\n  387&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (quoting Antley v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 139 S.C.\r\n  23, 27, 137 S.E. 199, 200 (1927)). Â South Carolina case law allows &quot;an\r\n  action for wrongful cancellation to be brought during the lifetime of the\r\n  insured by either the insured or beneficiary if the beneficiary's interest is\r\n  an absolute and indefeasible vested interest.&quot;Â  McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 382, 597 S.E.2d\r\n  181, 186&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).\r\nIn Babb v.\r\n  Paul Revere Life Insurance Co., 224 S.C. 1, 8, 77 S.E.2d 267,\r\n  270&nbsp;(1953), the South Carolina Supreme Court found a beneficiary's interest\r\n  was contingent during the insured's life because the insured had the right\r\n  under the policy to change the beneficiary, even though the option was not\r\n  exercised.Â  However, the supreme court further found that did not prevent the\r\n  beneficiary from maintaining an action that resulted from the alleged wrongful\r\n  cancellation of the policy after the insured had died.Â  Id.Â  The Babb court noted:\r\n\r\n  An action for damages for wrongful cancellation or repudiation\r\n    of an insurance policy may be maintained by either insured or the beneficiary\r\n    during the lifetime of insured, but the beneficiary cannot maintain the action\r\n    during insured's lifetime if he does not have a vested interest in the policy,\r\n    or if his interest is in the nature of a mere expectancy and does not become\r\n    absolute and indefeasible until the death of insured. . . . After the death of\r\n    insured, the action may be maintained by the beneficiary.\r\n\r\nId. at 9, 77 S.E.2d at 271(quoting 45 C.J.S. Insurance Â§ 465(b)).\r\nIn Rice v.\r\n  Palmetto State Life Insurance Co., 196 S.C. 410, 412, 13 S.E.2d 493, 494,\r\n  (1941), a mother obtained a policy on the life of her daughter, named herself\r\n  the beneficiary, and paid all the premiums.Â  The supreme court stated had the\r\n  insured &quot;undertaken to change the beneficiary, the court would be bound by\r\n  [its previous holdings that the beneficiary has\r\n  no vested right when the insured has reserved the right to change\r\n  beneficiaries] if any complaint were made by the mother.&quot; Â Id. at\r\n  421, 13 S.E.2d at 498. Â The court determined:\r\n\r\n  [T]he rights of the existing beneficiary are inchoate and may\r\n    be nullified by action on the part of the insured in strict accordance with the\r\n    terms of the policy. Â But so long as there is no change of beneficiary, the\r\n    rights of the beneficiary are tangible and are protected by the law.\r\n\r\nId. at 422, 13 S.E.2d at 498. Â In Horne,\r\n  the supreme court found even though a beneficiary paid most of the premiums,\r\n  the court was bound by previous rulings that stated that the beneficiary has no\r\n  vested right when the insured has reserved the right to change\r\n  beneficiaries.Â  277 S.C. at 339, 287 S.E.2d at 146.Â  \r\nPrince relies on Babb,\r\n  which found a beneficiary's interest vests once an insured dies, and the\r\n  beneficiary can then pursue action, even if the policy is no longer in\r\n  existence.Â  However, in that case only the insured had the right to change the\r\n  beneficiary.Â  Here, because only Prince had the right to change the\r\n  beneficiary, he had a vested interest in the insurance policy as a beneficiary\r\n  while his brother was still alive.Â  The statute of limitations applies to\r\n  beneficiaries and begins to run once both the cause of action accrues and the\r\n  interest is vested.Â  Therefore, when Prince filed the action in 2005, the\r\n  statute of limitations barred the claim.Â  Accordingly, the trial court's order\r\n  granting Liberty Life summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and\r\n  THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Because Prince was in prison, his sister obtained his\r\n  power of attorney and sent the payments on his behalf. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4742","title":"State v.

Upon the advice of his counsel, evidenced by counsel's co-signature, Wills entered into the agreement.  Later, Wills failed a State-administered polygraph examination.  Therefore, the State used his proffered statement against him at trial.  While South Carolina courts have applied general contract principles to immunity and plea agreements, the issue of whether an agreement can waive the application of the Rules of Evidence is novel.  Accordingly, this court adopted and applied the principles of United States v. Mezzanatto, 513 U.S. 196 (1995), and held the protections of Rule 410, SCRE, can be waived by a proffer agreement entered into knowingly and voluntarily.  Because Wills entered into the agreement with the advice of counsel, this court found the agreement was knowingly and voluntarily, and the trial court properly admitted Wills's statement into evidence.","date":"2010-09-22","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tThe State, Respondent,\r\n\t\t\t\tv.\r\n\t\t\t\tTheodore David\r\n      Wills, Jr., Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Horry County\r\nÂ Steven H.

Savitz, III, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney\r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all\r\n  of Columbia; and Solicitor J. Gregory Hembree, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â Theodore David Wills, Jr. appeals his murder\r\n  conviction and forty-year sentence, arguing the trial court erred in admitting\r\n  his statement in violation of Rule 410, SCRE.Â  We affirm. [1]\r\nFACTS\r\nWills\r\n  was charged with murdering Julian Lee.Â  Prior to his trial, Wills entered into\r\n  a proffer agreement with the State, reviewed and signed by his attorney,\r\n  whereby he agreed to truthfully divulge the events and circumstances\r\n  surrounding Lee's death in exchange for the State's consideration and a\r\n  recommended sentence.Â  The agreement contained several conditions, including\r\n  Wills's submission to a polygraph examination to test the veracity of his\r\n  statement. Â Additionally, the agreement provided:\r\n\r\n\t[U]pon\r\n  examination(s) by polygraph, if the responses given by Theodore David Wills Jr.\r\n  show deception, are inconsistent with information previously provided or\r\n  indicates he is the person or one of the persons that shot the victim, the\r\n  terms of this proffer are null and void and any statements made by Theodore\r\n  David Wills Jr. may be used against him by the State for any legal purpose,\r\n  including, but not limited to, considerations for charging, bond, disposition\r\n  of charges through plea or trial of Theodore David Wills Jr. and impeachment.\r\n\r\nAfter Wills gave a\r\n  video-taped proffer statement, the polygraph was administered and the State\r\n  determined Wills was untruthful.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Wills opposed the statement's introduction, and after a Jackson v.\r\n    Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), hearing, the trial court found the statement\r\n  was voluntary and admissible on the conditions both parties would refrain from\r\n  mentioning the polygraph, and the videotape would be redacted where Wills\r\n  referenced his previous incarceration and the polygraph.Â  Wills was convicted\r\n  as charged and sentenced to forty years' imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not\r\n  be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Pagan,\r\n  369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  when the trial court's conclusions either lack evidentiary support or are\r\n  controlled by an error of law.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n&quot;Rule\r\n  410[, SCRE,] provides . . . a statement made during plea negotiations with a\r\n  prosecuting authority, even if a guilty plea is not entered or is later\r\n  withdrawn, is not admissible.&quot;Â  State v. Compton, 366 S.C. 671,\r\n  679, 623 S.E.2d 661, 665 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nIn Compton,\r\n  this court addressed the admissibility of a defendant's statements procured\r\n  pursuant to an agreement with the State.Â  Id.Â  Otis James Compton was\r\n  questioned about an unsolved murder prior to pleading guilty to unrelated\r\n  counts of burglary.Â  Id. at 675, 623 S.E.2d at 663.Â  At all times,\r\n  Compton remained a person of interest in the murder investigation.Â  Id.Â \r\n  While incarcerated, Compton pled to additional charges unrelated to the murder\r\n  and was placed in a holding cell.Â  Id.Â  Compton initiated a conversation\r\n  with his holding cellmate regarding the unsolved murder, admitting his involvement.Â  Id.Â  Approximately two months later, the cellmate was transferred to\r\n  Compton's prison and asked by investigators to listen to Compton about the\r\n  unsolved murder.Â  Id. at 675-76, 623 S.E.2d at 663.Â  The cellmate\r\n  acquiesced and reported several conversations to investigators.Â  Id. at\r\n  676, 623 S.E.2d at 663.\r\nEight\r\n  months after his initial plea, Compton contacted investigators regarding the\r\n  unsolved murder and entered into a written agreement labeled &quot;Plea\r\n  Agreement&quot; whereby Compton agreed to fully and truthfully cooperate in the\r\n  murder investigation.Â  Id. at 676, 623 S.E.2d at 663-64.Â  In exchange\r\n  for his cooperation, the State agreed to reduce all sentences Compton was\r\n  serving for the unrelated burglary charges.Â  Id. at 676, 623 S.E.2d at\r\n  664.Â  As a result of his cooperation during the investigation, Compton was\r\n  indicted for murder.Â  Id.Â  Pretrial, Compton moved to suppress his\r\n  statements, arguing they were subject to an immunity agreement and precluded by\r\n  Rule 410, SCRE.Â  Id.Â  The trial court admitted the statements after\r\n  finding no reasonable expectation of immunity existed and the statements were\r\n  not procured during plea negotiations.Â  Id.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, this court examined the &quot;Plea Agreement,&quot; and determined the\r\n  agreement did not contain an immunity clause.Â  Id. at 676-78, 623 S.E.2d\r\n  664-65.Â  In construing the agreement, our court stated &quot;immunity\r\n  agreements and plea agreements are to be construed in accordance with general\r\n  contract principles.&quot;Â  Id. at 677, 623 S.E.2d at 664.Â  Thus,\r\n  &quot;[t]he court must enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms,\r\n  regardless of the contract's wisdom or folly, or the parties' failure to guard\r\n  their rights carefully.&quot;Â  Id. at 678, 623 S.E.2d at 665.Â  Likewise,\r\n  this court determined the admission of Compton's statements did not offend Rule\r\n  410, SCRE.Â  Id. at 679, 623 S.E.2d at 665.Â  This court held Rule 410,\r\n  SCRE, did not preclude the admission because the statements were not procured\r\n  in the course of plea negotiations when the negotiation &quot;related to the\r\n  reduction in sentence for the burglary&quot; convictions.Â  Id.Â  Specifically,\r\n  our court stated the discussions &quot;were not in furtherance of Compton\r\n  making a plea on any charges.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nApplying\r\n  the principles of Compton to the instant facts, an ambiguity in South\r\n  Carolina law seems to emerge.Â  Our case law unequivocally establishes\r\n  agreements between defendants and the State should be interpreted &quot;in\r\n  accordance with general contract principles.&quot;Â  Id. at 677, 623\r\n  S.E.2d at 664.Â  However, by examining the admissibility of Compton's statements[2] under Rule 410, SCRE, our court has left the precise question of whether an\r\n  agreement can waive the application of the Rules of Evidence unanswered.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  no South Carolina case law specifically discusses whether a defendant can waive\r\n  the exclusionary provisions of Rule 410, SCRE, the United States Supreme Court\r\n  addressed waiver of the exclusionary provisions of Rule 410, FRE, in United\r\n    States v. Mezzanatto, 513 U.S. 196, 200 (1995).[3]Â \r\n  Gary Mezzanatto was arrested and charged with possession with intent to\r\n  distribute methamphetamine after attempting to sell an undercover officer drugs.Â  Id. at 198.Â  The controlled buy was arranged by an informant who was\r\n  arrested a few hours before Mezzanatto for operating a methamphetamine\r\n  laboratory in his residence.Â  Id. at 197-98.Â  Pretrial, Mezzanatto and\r\n  his attorney contacted the prosecutor to discuss the possibility of cooperating\r\n  with the government.Â  Id. at 198.Â  The prosecutor informed Mezzanatto he\r\n  was under no obligation to talk; however, the prosecutor stated Mezzanatto\r\n  would have to be completely truthful if he wanted to cooperate with the\r\n  government.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, Mezzantto orally agreed, with advice of\r\n  his counsel, &quot;that any statements he made during the meeting could be used\r\n  to impeach any contradictory testimony he might give at trial if the case\r\n  proceeded that far.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the meeting, Mezzanatto attempted to minimize his involvement in distributing\r\n  methamphetamine and claimed he had not visited the methamphetamine laboratory\r\n  at the informant's residence for at least a week before his arrest.Â  Id. at 199.Â  After showing Mezzanatto video surveillance of his vehicle at the\r\n  methamphetamine laboratory the day before his arrest, the government terminated\r\n  the meeting due to Mezzanatto's deceit.Â  Id.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Mezzanatto was tried, and during his cross-examination, the prosecutor\r\n  impeached him using the statements procured during the cooperation meeting.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Mezzanatto was ultimately convicted.Â  Id.Â  On appeal to the Ninth\r\n  Circuit Court of Appeals, Mezzanatto's conviction was reversed.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The Ninth Circuit &quot;held [Mezzanatto's] agreement to allow admission of his\r\n  plea statements for purposes of impeachment was unenforceable.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed the Ninth\r\n  Circuit, stating:Â  &quot;The presumption of waivability has found specific\r\n  application in the context of evidentiary rules.Â  Absent some 'overriding\r\n  procedural consideration that prevents enforcement of the contract,' courts\r\n  have held that agreements to waive evidentiary rules are generally enforceable\r\n  even over a party's subsequent objections.&quot;Â  Id. at 202 (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  Furthermore, the Court held &quot;absent some affirmative indication\r\n  that the agreement was entered into unknowingly or involuntarily, an agreement\r\n  to waive the exclusionary provisions of the plea-statement Rules is valid and\r\n  enforceable.&quot; Â Id. at 210.\r\nHere,\r\n  the principles of Mezzanatto are instructive in determining whether\r\n  Wills's statements were properly admitted.Â  First, we note the proffer\r\n  agreement between Wills and the State constituted a plea negotiation and\r\n  triggered the exclusionary provisions of Rule 410, SCRE.Â  Likewise, any\r\n  statements procured in execution of the agreement were unequivocally in\r\n  furtherance of Wills entering a plea on his pending charges.Â  Second,\r\n  construing the proffer agreement in accordance with general contract\r\n  principles, regardless of the agreement's wisdom or lack thereof, the agreement\r\n  unambiguously provides Wills's statement can be used against him by the State for any legal purpose if the State determines Wills was\r\n  deceitful.Â  Thus, we hold the proffer agreement waived the protections of Rule\r\n  410, SCRE.Â  Next, we must determine whether an affirmative indication that\r\n  Wills entered the agreement unknowingly or involuntarily exists.Â  Because Wills\r\n  entered the proffer agreement with advice of counsel, evidenced by counsel's co-signature,\r\n  and the record lacks support for a finding to the contrary, we find the\r\n  agreement was knowingly and voluntarily entered.Â  Therefore, the trial court\r\n  properly admitted Wills's statements as evidence against him at trial.Â  \r\nAccordingly, Wills's conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  PIEPER, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Compton was also subjected to a polygraph, and the\r\n  State determined he was deceitful.Â  Compton, 336 S.C. at 676, 623 S.E.2d\r\n  at 664.Â  However, in his appeal, we declined to address whether Compton's\r\n  breach of the agreement contributed to his statements' admissibility because\r\n  the issue was not properly before this court.Â  Id. at 679 n.2, 623\r\n  S.E.2d at 665 n.2.\r\n[3] Rule 410, SCRE, is substantially similar to Rule 410,\r\n  FRE.Â  Compare Rule 410, FRE, and Mezzanatto, 513 U.S. at\r\n  197 (&quot;Federal Rule of Evidence 410 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure\r\n  11(e)(6) provide that statements made in the course of plea discussions between\r\n  a criminal defendant and a prosecutor are inadmissible against the\r\n  defendant.&quot;), with Rule 410, SCRE, and Compton, 366\r\n  S.C. at 679, 623 S.E.2d at 665 (&quot;Rule 410 provides that evidence of a\r\n  guilty plea that is later withdrawn or evidence of a plea of nolo contendere is\r\n  inadmissible against a defendant.Â  Furthermore, statements made in the course\r\n  of court proceedings related to such pleas are not admissible.Â  Likewise, a\r\n  statement made during plea negotiations with a prosecuting authority, even if a\r\n  guilty plea is not entered or is later withdrawn, is not admissible.&quot;).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4743","title":"State v.

Â He was released from prison on March 1,\r\n  2006, and entered the community supervision program as required by section\r\n  24-21-560(A) of the South Carolina Code (2007). Â He committed no violations of\r\n  the program's terms during 2006 and 2007.Â  On December 31, 2007, he helped his\r\n  brother move a washer and dryer for their mother.Â  In the course of doing this,\r\n  Garrard briefly stopped at his brother's workplace, approximately 750 feet from\r\n  Lexington High School.Â  The State[1] charged him with violating number five of the sex offender conditions for\r\n  community supervision which states: &quot;I will not enter into, loiter or work\r\n  within one thousand . . . feet of any area or event frequented by people under\r\n  the age of 18 including but not limited to: schools . . . .&quot;Â  Garrard\r\n  conceded he entered within one thousand feet of the school, and thus that he\r\n  violated the terms of condition five.Â  He denied the violation was willful.Â  The\r\n  trial judge initially ruled Garrard had committed a willful violation.Â  After\r\n  a motion to reconsider, however, she reversed her decision and ruled that the\r\n  violation was not willful.\r\nThe\r\n  State contends the trial judge abused her discretion in finding that Garrard\r\n  did not commit a willful violation. Â The State also contends the court violated\r\n  the Victim's Rights Act by not holding a hearing on Garrard's motion to reconsider.Â \r\n  We affirm.\r\nI. Community\r\n  Supervision Program\r\nA. Definition of &quot;Willfully&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  community supervision program is operated by the South Carolina Department of\r\n  Probation, Parole and Pardon Services. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(A) &amp; (B)\r\n  (2007).Â  When the department determines that a participant has committed a\r\n  violation warranting revocation, &quot;a probation agent must initiate a\r\n  proceeding in General Sessions Court.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 560(C).Â  A circuit\r\n  judge then &quot;shall determine whether . . . Â the prisoner has willfully\r\n  violated a term of the community supervision program.&quot;Â  Id. Â§ 560(C)(5).Â \r\n  In this appeal, we must determine what the Legislature meant in using the term &quot;willfully.&quot;Â \r\n  The State contends that simply because Garrard was physically located less than\r\n  one thousand feet from the school, he committed a willful violation.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nOur\r\n  appellate courts have defined &quot;willful&quot; in a variety of contexts.Â  In\r\n  each instance, the court has required a showing of a consciousness of\r\n  wrongdoing in order to prove willfulness.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 53, 413 S.E.2d 835, 839 (1992) (In the context of\r\n  termination of parental rights, &quot;[c]onduct\r\n  of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties may\r\n  fairly be characterized as 'willful' because it manifests a conscious\r\n  indifference to the rights of the child.&quot;); Kuznik v. Bees Ferry Assocs., 342\r\n  S.C. 579, 611, 538 S.E.2d 15, 32 (Ct. App. 2000) (In the context of punitive\r\n  damages, &quot;[w]illfulness has been defined as a conscious failure to exercise due care.&quot;).\r\n  Â In the context of contempt, our supreme court defined a willful act &quot;as\r\n  one 'done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do\r\n  something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something\r\n  the law requires to be done&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.'&quot; Â State v.\r\n    Sowell, 370 S.C. 330, 336, 635 S.E.2d 81, 83 (2006) (quoting Spartanburg\r\n      County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872,\r\n  874 (1988)).Â  In both Sowell and Padgett, the supreme court\r\n  quoted Black's Law Dictionary in defining &quot;willful.&quot;Â  See id. Â Black's Law Dictionary defines &quot;willful&quot; as &quot;[p]roceeding\r\n  from a conscious motion of the will; voluntary.Â  Intending the result which\r\n  actually comes to pass; designed; intentional; not accidental or involuntary.&quot;Â  Black's Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed. 1979).[2]\r\nThese\r\n  general definitions are appropriate to use in construing the term &quot;willfully&quot;\r\n  in section 24-21-560(C)(5).Â  We find support for this conclusion in this court's\r\n  opinion in State v. Spare, 374 S.C. 264, 647 S.E.2d 706 (Ct. App. 2007).Â \r\n  In the closely related context of an alleged violation of probation, the Spare court explained the requirements for proving &quot;willfulness&quot; to\r\n  establish a violation for failure to pay money.[3]Â \r\n  374 S.C. at 269-70, 647 S.E.2d at 708-09.Â  The court began by stating: &quot;'Willful failure to pay means a voluntary, conscious and\r\n  intentional failure.'&quot;Â  374 S.C. at 269, 647 S.E.2d at 708 (quoting People v. Davis, 576 N.E.2d 510, 513 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991)).Â  The\r\n  court then referenced Sowell, and quoted the passage from Sowell cited earlier in this opinion.Â  374 S.C. at 269, 647 S.E.2d at 708.Â  Following\r\n  these general definitions, we construe the term &quot;willfully&quot; as used\r\n  in this section to require that the State prove either: (1) a voluntary and\r\n  intentional act done with consciousness that the act is a violation of a term\r\n  of the community supervision program, or (2) the voluntary and intentional\r\n  failure to do something known to be required by a term of community\r\n  supervision.\r\nIn\r\n  his motion to reconsider, Garrard cited Spare in arguing that the judge\r\n  had applied the incorrect definition for &quot;willful.&quot;Â  The trial judge\r\n  relied on Spare in changing her ruling to conclude that the State had\r\n  failed to prove a willful violation.Â  We hold the trial judge used the correct\r\n  definition of &quot;willfully&quot; after reconsideration.Â  Depending on the\r\n  facts of a particular case and the nature of an alleged violation, the specific\r\n  facts the State must prove may vary.Â  In order to prove a willful violation in\r\n  this case, the State was required to prove that Garrard voluntarily and\r\n  intentionally went within one thousand feet of a school, and that he knew doing\r\n  so was a violation of a term of the community supervision program.[4]\r\nB. Trial Judge's\r\n  Discretion\r\nBoth\r\n  the decision of whether an alleged violation was willful and the decision of\r\n  whether to revoke community supervision are discretionary.Â  The trial court will\r\n  not be reversed unless the appellant has shown an abuse of that discretion.Â  See State v. Allen, 370 S.C. 88, 94, 634 S.E.2d 653, 655 (2006) (applying an abuse of\r\n  discretion standard of review to the related context of an appeal from an order\r\n  revoking probation).Â  Where there is any evidence to support the court's factual findings,\r\n  there is no abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  We find evidence to support the trial\r\n  court's factual determination that the violation was not willful. Â First, Garrard\r\n  described the incident as follows: &quot;I pulled into this business and got\r\n  out of my truck and got in his truck and I drove and got a washer and dryer and\r\n  came back to his business and got in my truck and drove off. . . . I was not\r\n  there a total of four minutes there and back.&quot;Â  Second, in response to the\r\n  judge's questions, Garrard testified that his violation was not willful. Â He\r\n  also testified he did not know that working at his brother's workplace was\r\n  impermissible. Â This testimony was supported by Garrard's treating therapist\r\n  for the previous two years, Dr. Lazarus, who suggested that Garrard had worked\r\n  hard to remain in compliance with the terms of community supervision.Â  Dr.\r\n  Lazarus testified that Garrard had &quot;been exemplary in following exactly my\r\n  directions, my recommendations,&quot; and that Garrard &quot;is at the lowest\r\n  level that is possible for reoffending.&quot; Â \r\nFinally,\r\n  the trial judge repeatedly asked the probation officer representing the State\r\n  at the hearing to address whether the violation was willful.Â  The officer never\r\n  gave a direct answer, stating at one point &quot;we are going to leave that to\r\n  the judge's discretion.&quot;Â  The trial judge finally asked &quot;you are\r\n  telling me you don't feel it was willful? . . . I need you to be honest with\r\n  me.&quot;Â  The officer replied merely that she felt a verbal reprimand was\r\n  sufficient to address Garrard's violation. Â The trial judge's finding that the\r\n  State had not proven a willful violation was within her discretion.\r\nII. Victim's\r\n  Rights Act\r\nIn\r\n  its return to Garrard's motion to reconsider, the State requested that the\r\n  trial judge hold a hearing.Â  The State now contends the decision not to conduct\r\n  a hearing violated the Victim's Rights Act.Â  We disagree.Â  The Act requires the\r\n  State to &quot;attempt to notify each victim, who has indicated a desire to be\r\n  notified, of post-conviction proceedings affecting the . . . release of the\r\n  offender, . . . and of the victim's right to attend and comment at these proceedings.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1560(A) (2003).Â  When an offender files a motion to\r\n  reconsider a decision to revoke community supervision, the section requires the\r\n  State to notify the victim that the motion has been filed.Â  See id.Â \r\n  If the trial judge chooses to hold a hearing on the motion, then the section\r\n  requires the State to notify the victim of her right to &quot;attend and\r\n  comment.&quot;Â  See id.Â  The section says nothing, however, about\r\n  whether the judge must choose to hold a hearing.Â  In fact, while the judge\r\n  should give a reasonable opportunity to allow the State to comply with section 16-3-1560(A),[5] the section imposes no requirement whatsoever on the judge.\r\nWe\r\n  hold the decision of whether to conduct a hearing on a motion to reconsider the\r\n  revocation of community supervision is within the discretion of the trial\r\n  court.Â  See Rule 29, SCRCrimP (A post-trial &quot;motion may, in the\r\n  discretion of the court, be determined on briefs filed by the parties without\r\n  oral argument.&quot;).Â  If there is any reasonable basis for the decision not\r\n  to hold a hearing, the decision will be affirmed on appeal.Â  In this case, no\r\n  additional evidence was offered in the motion to reconsider or in the State's\r\n  return.Â  Rather, the motion focused on the proper definition of &quot;willfulness,&quot;\r\n  and whether the evidence already offered was sufficient for the State to meet\r\n  its burden to prove the violation was willful.Â  Under these circumstances, the\r\n  trial judge's decision not to hold a hearing was within her discretion. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The State is\r\n  represented by the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon\r\n  Services at hearings on alleged violations of community supervision.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-560(A) &amp; (C) (2007).\r\n[2] Sowell and Padgett quote the fifth edition.Â  The definition of\r\n  &quot;willful&quot; in the current edition is shorter, but essentially the\r\n  same: &quot;[v]oluntary and intentional, but not necessarily malicious.&quot;Â  Black's\r\n    Law Dictionary 1737 (9th ed. 2009).Â  &quot;Willfulness&quot; is defined in\r\n  the ninth edition as &quot;[t]he voluntary, intentional violation or disregard of\r\n  a known legal duty.&quot; Id.\r\n[3] Willfulness is\r\n  not normally required in order to prove a violation of probation.Â  For alleged\r\n  violations based solely on a failure to pay money, however, as was the case in Spare,\r\n  the State must prove willfulness before a circuit judge may revoke probation. See State v. Hamilton, 333 S.C. 642, 649, 511\r\n  S.E.2d 94, 97 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n[4] In its brief,\r\n  the State argues the trial judge &quot;confuses the intent behind the actual\r\n  violation charged (to knowingly enter an area within one thousand feet of a\r\n  school) with the intent to commit a bad act once he entered the area.&quot;Â  We\r\n  do not believe the trial judge was confused at all. Rather, she used the\r\n  correct definition of willfully in finding &quot;[t]he evidence presented\r\n  demonstrated a lack of willfulness to violate the terms of his\r\n  supervision.&quot;Â  In the context of the violation of community\r\n  supervision alleged in this case, the definition of willfulness does not\r\n  require that the State prove Garrard intended to disobey or disregard the law\r\n  while within one thousand feet of the school.Â  Rather, proof that he intended\r\n  to go to the location, and that he knew doing so was a violation, would have\r\n  been sufficient to prove willfulness.\r\n[5] No section of\r\n  the Act specifically addresses a circuit judge's responsibilities regarding a\r\n  motion or proceeding after conviction.Â  However, two sections address a circuit\r\n  judge's responsibilities in hearings and proceedings conducted before\r\n  conviction.Â  See S.C. Code Â§Â§ 16-3-1525 &amp; 1550 (2003).Â  In both of\r\n  those sections, the circuit judge is generally required to verify the State's\r\n  compliance with the Act, and to allow reasonable time for the State to comply\r\n  if it has previously failed to do so. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4744","title":"SC Department of Social Services v.

L. (Father) tested positive for cocaine,\r\n  Child was removed from their home.[2]Â \r\n  Child was one year old at the time of removal.Â  Child was placed in a\r\n  pre-adoptive foster home with two of her sisters.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  a merits hearing on October 22, 2007, the family court ordered Mother and\r\n  Father to complete a treatment plan including mental health assessments, parent\r\n  evaluations, alcohol and drug assessments, and other recommendations.Â  In\r\n  addition, the family court ordered them to provide Child with safe and\r\n  appropriate housing,[3] report their legal income, pay child support, and complete &quot;an extensive\r\n  parenting course.&quot;Â  Mother and Father failed to complete the alcohol and\r\n  drug assessments, parenting classes, and home safety improvements necessary for\r\n  DSS to return Child to them.[4]Â \r\n  Although Father paid some child support from his Social Security disability\r\n  benefits, Mother, a homemaker, paid nothing.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  April 2008, DSS initiated termination of parental rights (TPR) proceedings.Â \r\n  The complaint for TPR alleged as statutory grounds meriting TPR (1) willful\r\n  failure to visit, (2) willful failure to support, (3) failure to remedy the\r\n  condition leading to removal, (4) a diagnosable condition that was unlikely to\r\n  change and that prevented Mother from providing Child with &quot;minimally\r\n  acceptable care,&quot; and (5) harm or neglect of Child from which the home\r\n  cannot likely be made safe within twelve months.Â  Moreover, the complaint\r\n  indicated Child had remained in foster care continuously since her removal from\r\n  Mother.Â  Both parents testified at the November 3, 2008 TPR hearing.Â  Mother stated\r\n  they lived in a two-bedroom trailer home.Â  According to Father, their income\r\n  consisted of his Social Security disability benefits of approximately $689 per\r\n  month and occasional income he earned by doing odd jobs and lawn care.Â  In\r\n  addition to everyday expenses, Father had recently purchased new cell phones\r\n  for himself and Mother at a cost of $100 each.Â  Their monthly expenses included\r\n  approximately $50 per month for food and healthcare for their ten dogs and $30\r\n  per month for cellular telephone service.[5]Â \r\n  An unspecified amount of Father's Social Security disability benefits went to\r\n  support Child.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  Mother last worked in April 2004, she held three jobs.Â  Mother suffered from\r\n  diabetes during her pregnancy with Child.Â  A degenerative disk disease\r\n  prevented her from doing jobs that included lifting heavy objects.Â  At the time\r\n  of the TPR hearing, Mother had applied unsuccessfully for approximately thirty\r\n  jobs.Â  She was on probation for assault on a child, and she admitted driving\r\n  while her driver's license was suspended.Â  However, Mother denied doing drugs,\r\n  including smoking crack cocaine.Â  \r\nMother\r\n  testified she visited Child in foster care fourteen times.Â  However, a court\r\n  order prevented her from visiting Child for two or three months during the\r\n  seventeen months between Child's removal and the TPR hearing.Â  According to\r\n  Kathleen Spell, the DSS case manager, Mother and Father took snacks, drinks,\r\n  toys, lotion for Child's skin issue, and antibiotics to Child.Â  Mother also testified\r\n  they provided toys, food, clothes, diapers, wipes, medication, and lotion.Â  In\r\n  anticipation of Child returning home, Mother redecorated the smaller bedroom\r\n  for Child by painting, installing curtains and carpet, and rearranging\r\n  furniture.Â  \r\nSpell\r\n  testified she attempted to evaluate improvements to the home on several\r\n  occasions, but Mother and Father prevented her from entering.Â  The last time\r\n  she visited, they permitted her to enter the house, but she left before\r\n  completing her evaluation because Father cursed at her, yelled, and slammed\r\n  doors.Â  \r\nWendy\r\n  May of South Carolina Vocational Rehabilitation (SCVR) testified she saw Mother\r\n  on June 12, 2007.Â  May offered Mother guidance counseling, GED preparation\r\n  classes, and job readiness training.Â  SCVR offered Mother van transportation to\r\n  its GED classes and job readiness training sessions, but she declined.Â  Mother\r\n  attended a few classes but did not complete any of the programs within the\r\n  first year.Â  On the date of the TPR hearing, Mother had been re-enrolled for\r\n  approximately one month.Â  \r\nMaria\r\n  Royle, Child's guardian ad litem (GAL), testified Child appeared reluctant to\r\n  spend time with Mother and Father, and they had to &quot;bribe&quot; her with\r\n  treats.Â  According to Royle, Child bonded with her foster family and called her\r\n  foster mother &quot;Mommy.&quot;Â  Royle believed it was in Child's best\r\n  interest to terminate Mother's and Father's parental rights so Child and her\r\n  siblings could be adopted by their foster family.Â  She expressed concern that\r\n  despite being &quot;in the system&quot; since 1991, Mother and Father had\r\n  failed to rehabilitate themselves from their history of drug use and arrests.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court terminated Mother's and Father's parental rights pursuant to sections 20-7-1572 (3) and (4) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2007) (willful failure to visit and willful failure to\r\n  support, respectively).Â  The family court\r\n  also found TPR was in Child's best interests.Â  Mother now appeals.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nÂ &quot;A\r\n  ground for [TPR] must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.&quot;Â  Richland\r\n    County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 868\r\n  (1998).Â  &quot;In reviewing a termination of parental rights, the appellate\r\n  court has the authority to review the record and make its own findings of\r\n  whether clear and convincing evidence supports the termination.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Willful\r\n  Failure to Visit\r\nMother\r\n  argues the family court erred in finding DSS proved by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence she willfully failed to visit Child.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nOne\r\n  ground for TPR is proven when:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months,\r\n    and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to visit the child.Â  The\r\n    court may attach little or no weight to incidental visitations, but it must be\r\n    shown that the parent was not prevented from visiting by the party having\r\n    custody or by court order.Â  The distance of the child's placement from the\r\n    parent's home must be taken into consideration when determining the ability to\r\n    visit. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(3)\r\n  (2010).Â  &quot;Willful conduct is conduct that evinces a settled purpose to\r\n  forego parental duties . . . because it manifests a conscious indifference to\r\n  the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.&quot;Â  Charleston County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 97, 627\r\n  S.E.2d 765, 771 (Ct. App. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).Â  Whether\r\n  the failure to visit is willful &quot;is a question of intent to be determined\r\n  from the facts and circumstances of each individual case.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't\r\n    of Soc. Servs. v. Headden, 354 S.C. 602, 610, 582 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2003).Â  \r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina courts have not quantified how many visits a parent may make while\r\n  legally failing to visit.Â  Rather, the family court and this court are required\r\n  to examine &quot;the facts and circumstances&quot; of this particular case to\r\n  determine whether Mother's failure was willful.Â  See id.Â  In the\r\n  instant case, the record is more deficient than informative.Â  It reflects that,\r\n  during the approximately fifteen months Mother was permitted to visit Child,\r\n  she made fourteen visits.Â  The visits were described as &quot;sporadic,&quot;\r\n  and the GAL testified three of them occurred during the month preceding the TPR\r\n  hearing.Â  However, no evidence indicated how many visits were scheduled, how\r\n  many scheduled visits Mother missed, or how much time elapsed between visits.Â \r\n  According to the GAL, during the last month, Mother's visitation required the\r\n  GAL to be present, but the record contained no evidence as to whether\r\n  additional limitations or requirements applied to her other visits.Â  The GAL\r\n  testified she had observed only Mother's last three visits with Child.Â \r\n  Although the GAL believed Mother and Child did not bond, no evidence indicated\r\n  how long the visits lasted or what activities, if any, took place besides the\r\n  presentation of toys and snacks.Â  The GAL testified that she personally visited\r\n  Child approximately two times per month, but no evidence indicated whether\r\n  Mother was invited to these visits.Â  Furthermore, the record contained no evidence\r\n  of the distance between Mother's home and either the foster home or the\r\n  visitation location.Â  Because Mother visited Child nearly once per month on\r\n  average, and because the record fails to provide details of the purported\r\n  failure to visit or clear indications of willfulness, the family court erred in\r\n  finding DSS proved by clear and convincing evidence Mother willfully failed to\r\n  visit Child.Â  \r\nII. Willful\r\n  Failure to Support\r\nMother\r\n  asserts the family court erred in finding she willfully failed to support\r\n  Child.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAnother\r\n  ground for TPR is met when:Â  \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months,\r\n    and during that time the parent has wilfully failed to support the child.Â \r\n    Failure to support means that the parent has failed to make a material\r\n    contribution to the child's care.Â  A material contribution consists of either\r\n    financial contributions according to the parent's means or contributions of\r\n    food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the care of the child\r\n    according to the parent's means.Â  The court may consider all relevant\r\n    circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully failed to\r\n    support the child, including requests for support by the custodian and the\r\n    ability of the parent to provide support. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(4)\r\n  (2010).Â  &quot;Willful conduct is conduct that evinces a settled purpose to\r\n  forego parental duties . . . because it manifests a conscious indifference to\r\n  the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.&quot;Â  Jackson, 368 S.C. at 97, 627 S.E.2d at 771.Â  Whether the failure to\r\n  support is willful &quot;is a question of intent to be determined in each case\r\n  from all the facts and circumstances.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Seegars, 367 S.C. 623, 630, 627 S.E.2d 718, 721 (2006).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record clearly reflects that Mother had no income of her own.Â  The statute\r\n  requires a &quot;material contribution&quot; of either money or necessities &quot;according\r\n  to the parent's means.&quot;Â  Â§ 63-7-2570(4).Â  The evidence adduced at the TPR\r\n  hearing indicates Mother's means were extremely limited but she provided some\r\n  necessities during her visits with Child.Â  Because of her inability to find\r\n  employment, Mother either had no means whatsoever or was entirely dependent\r\n  upon Father for means to support Child.Â  The family's only regular income came\r\n  from Father's Social Security disability benefits.Â  Although Child received\r\n  some amount of money from that source, the record does not indicate how much\r\n  money Child received or when she began receiving it.Â  The payments appear to\r\n  have started at the urging of the GAL, but aside from the entry of an order of\r\n  support against Mother, no evidence indicates the GAL made additional requests\r\n  for money from Mother.Â  More importantly, the record contains no evidence the\r\n  family court examined the relevant circumstances to determine what would have\r\n  constituted a material contribution according to Mother's means.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find unpersuasive Mother's argument that she was a housewife by choice.Â  Mother\r\n  applied to dozens of jobs and diligently followed up on her applications until\r\n  she received responses.Â  The record reflects she sought but failed to take full\r\n  advantage of vocational rehabilitation services from SCVR, but the SCVR\r\n  representative testified that SCVR was not a job placement agency.Â  Although\r\n  SCVR offered services to assist individuals in becoming more marketable, it did\r\n  not provide employment.Â  Consequently, even Mother's full, successful\r\n  completion of SCVR's programs would not have guaranteed her income.Â  \r\nMother\r\n  contends that, lack of income notwithstanding, she made material contributions\r\n  to Child.Â  Child's DSS case manager testified Mother and Father provided child\r\n  with snacks, drinks, toys, lotion for Child's skin issue, and antibiotics.Â \r\n  Mother testified they provided toys, food, clothes, diapers, wipes, medication,\r\n  and lotion.Â  Lastly, Mother testified that she had prepared the smaller bedroom\r\n  in their home for Child by painting, installing curtains and carpet, and\r\n  rearranging furniture.Â  Considering her extremely limited means, Mother's\r\n  efforts do not appear to &quot;evince[] a settled purpose to forego parental\r\n  duties.&quot;Â  See Jackson, 368 S.C. at 97, 627 S.E.2d at 771.Â \r\n  Therefore, the family court erred in finding DSS proved by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence that Mother willfully failed to support Child.Â  \r\nIII. Best Interests\r\nFinally,\r\n  Mother asserts the family court erred in conducting a best-interests analysis\r\n  despite DSS's failure to prove any statutory ground by clear and convincing\r\n  evidence.Â  Because we reverse the family court's grant of TPR on the statutory\r\n  grounds, we do not reach this issue.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing\r\n    of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling\r\n  an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue\r\n  is dispositive of the appeal). \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn\r\n  accordance with the foregoing, we reverse the family court's termination of\r\n  Mother's parental rights and remand for a permanency planning hearing.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2580(B) (2010) (&quot;If the court finds that no ground\r\n  for termination exists and the child is in the custody of [DSS], the order\r\n  denying termination must specify a new permanent plan for the child or order a\r\n  hearing on a new permanent plan.&quot;).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.Â  \r\nCURETON, A.J., concurs.Â  \r\nWILLIAMS, J., dissenting:Â  Â Â I respectfully dissent and\r\n  would affirm the grant of TPR in this case, finding the family court correctly\r\n  found clear and convincing evidence that Mother willfully failed to support\r\n  Child.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(4)\r\n  (2010) (stating a ground for TPR exists when &quot;[t]he child has lived\r\n  outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that\r\n  time the parent has wilfully failed to support the child&quot; either\r\n  financially or through material contributions to the child's care); see also Richland County Dep't of Soc.\r\n    Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1998) (&quot;A\r\n  ground for [TPR] must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.&quot;).&nbsp; Our courts have held that &quot;[c]onduct of the\r\n  parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties may fairly be\r\n  characterized as 'willful' because it manifests a conscious indifference to the\r\n  rights of the child to receive support and consortium from the parent.&quot;Â  Hooper\r\n    v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 297, 513 S.E.2d 358, 367 (1999).Â  \r\nI would find there is sufficient evidence in this record to\r\n  support the finding that Mother's failure to support Child was willful.Â  Mother admits that she paid no child\r\n  support, despite her proven ability to earn an income based on her testimony\r\n  that prior to April 2004 she held three jobs simultaneously.&nbsp; In her\r\n  brief, Mother argues she intentionally remained at home by agreement with her\r\n  husband, choosing to remain dependent upon Father's Social Security disability\r\n  income for all her needs rather than returning to work to help support this\r\n  child or any of her other six children.&nbsp; Her position is that is it is\r\n  unfair to consider that she prefers to remain in the home as a housewife\r\n  instead of working to support Child.Â  No evidence indicates Mother's presence\r\n  was required at home to care for Father.&nbsp; In fact, Father testified that\r\n  despite his disability, he performed lawn care and odd jobs for additional\r\n  money.&nbsp; With all seven children removed from the home, Mother was free to\r\n  seek gainful employment.&nbsp; However, evidence that she pursued employment is\r\n  scant and contradictory.Â  She testified that she submitted thirty job applications,\r\n  but on cross-examination she admitted this was different than the testimony\r\n  given one month earlier in another TPR action involving one of her other\r\n  children.Â  Mother does not argue on appeal that she is disabled and unable to\r\n  work.Â  In fact, Mother testified that during the month prior to the merits\r\n  hearing, she redecorated Child's room by repainting, installing carpet, and\r\n  moving furniture.Â  She testified she did take a day off from redecorating\r\n  because her back hurt.Â  However, she indicated she was still able to use that\r\n  time to grocery shop and to submit job applications.Â  \r\nEvidence is plentiful that she eschewed not only employment but\r\n  also any professional assistance that would have improved her ability to find\r\n  work.&nbsp; Although Mother initially sought assistance from SCVR, she failed\r\n  for over fifteen months to take advantage of any of the several programs they\r\n  offered that could have improved her workplace skills and her\r\n  employability.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, she even refused offers of\r\n  transportation to get her to these classes.Â  She attended so infrequently that\r\n  she was dropped from their rolls.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is clear the inability\r\n  of Mother to find employment was because Mother had neither the desire nor the\r\n  intention to provide financial support for Child.Â  Most importantly, Mother\r\n  testified that she and Father agreed she would not work outside the home even\r\n  though she had a responsibility to support Child.\r\nFinally, I believe any contributions Mother made to Child's\r\n  welfare were not material.&nbsp; Testimony indicated Mother provided a few\r\n  items for Child during her initial visits.&nbsp; The GAL testified that Mother\r\n  provided nothing during her last three visits, which occurred during the month\r\n  immediately preceding the TPR hearing.&nbsp; Consequently, Mother's efforts to\r\n  provide for Child were negligible. \r\nMoreover, the record demonstrates the best interest of Child would\r\n  be served by granting TPR.Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, I would find there is clear and convincing evidence\r\n  of her failure to support Child.Â  Mother's choices indicate a clear and settled\r\n  purpose to forego her parental responsibilities to support Child.Â  Therefore, I\r\n  would affirm the family court's decision to terminate Mother's parental rights.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS)\r\n  first became involved with Mother and Father in 1991.Â  Mother and Father had\r\n  seven children.Â  In April 2004, before Child's birth, DSS removed the other\r\n  children from Mother and Father's home. Â Mother's and Father's parental rights\r\n  to the other six children were terminated October 7, 2008, in a separate action.\r\n[3] The record does not make clear what improvements to\r\n  the home the family court ordered or why.Â  One month before Child's removal,\r\n  the home was inspected and found to be safe.Â  The sole reason for Child's\r\n  removal was her parents' positive cocaine tests, which occurred on May 16,\r\n  2007.Â  However, Mother tested negative for drugs on May 3, 2007; May 29, 2007;\r\n  November 1, 2007; April 21, 2008; and September 27, 2008.Â Â Â  \r\n[4] However, Dr. Lois Masouris testified she provided\r\n  Mother and Father with three sessions of &quot;Triple P&quot; parenting\r\n  training but could not complete the course without Child's attendance.Â  Dr.\r\n  Masouris wrote to DSS requesting Child's attendance at ten future sessions, but\r\n  DSS never responded. Â \r\n[5] Mother and Father do not have a landline telephone.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4745","title":"Moore v.

Benson and Thomas Lee Benson\r\n  seeking damages and equitable relief based on allegations of inter alia,\r\n  fraud, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty arising from the sale of real\r\n  property from Moore to the Bensons. Â The master ordered the Bensons to reconvey\r\n  the property to Moore, and awarded Moore actual and punitive damages. Â This\r\n  appeal followed. Â We affirm in part,\r\n  reverse in part, and remand.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nMoore was eighty-eight years old at the time of the trial in 2008.\r\n  Moore and Allean Moore were married in 1949. Â Throughout the marriage, Allean\r\n  handled the bills and personal business. Â Moore and Allean lived on seventeen\r\n  acres in Lyman, South Carolina, in the marital home. \r\nMoore's daughter, Jeannette, testified she began the caretaking of\r\n  her father as early as 1989. Â According to Jeannette, BB&amp;T sent Moore a\r\n  letter, dated January 14, 1999, stating that because Moore was to turn eighty,\r\n  his retirement account needed to be closed and the money transferred to another\r\n  account. Â The funds, $29,433.46, were transferred into account #471,\r\n  Jeannette's account. Jeannette testified Moore stated: &quot;Jeannette, you\r\n  have been taking care [of] me all of these years . . . . I am giving you all of\r\n  this money.&quot; According to her, she was to continue to take care of Moore\r\n  and pay his bills. Â On February 16, 1999, Moore signed a durable power of\r\n  attorney, appointing Jeannette as his attorney-in-fact.\r\nMoore and Allean were divorced by family court orders filed on\r\n  November 3, 2000, and January 8, 2001. Â The divorce decree awarded Moore the\r\n  marital home, valued by the family court at $154,000, and further provided:\r\n\r\n  9. Husband is to inform wife, within forty-five (45) days of the\r\n    date of this Order, relative to his election to buy her out; if he is able, or\r\n    elects to do so, this is to be done within ninety (90) days of the date of this\r\n    Order. \r\n  10. If husband is unable or unwilling to buy out wife's interest,\r\n    then within forty-five (45) days of the date of this Order, the home is to be\r\n    placed on the market for sale, under the control of the husband; upon the sale\r\n    of the home, wife's interest in the marital estate is to be paid forthwith; if\r\n    the home is not under contract for sale within six (6) months of being placed\r\n    on the market, wife has the election to petition the Court for a judicial\r\n    sale.Â  \r\n\r\nIn the order addressing Allean's motion to reconsider, the family\r\n  court ordered Moore to pay $52,851 to Allean to effectuate the order relative\r\n  to equitable distribution. \r\nOn March 8, 2001, account #471, with a balance of $30,338.35 was\r\n  closed, withdrawing $30,215.82 and incurring a $122.53 early withdrawal penalty.\r\n  Â The withdrawal check was made payable to Jeannette. On March 9, 2001, Moore\r\n  signed a purchase contract and HUD settlement statement, selling the marital\r\n  home to the Bensons.[2]Â \r\n  The price paid for the property, $56,294.41, was the amount necessary to pay costs,\r\n  a small mortgage remaining on the property, and the equitable distribution\r\n  amount due to Allean.Â Â  \r\nJohn H. Heckman, III, a real estate attorney, testified he knew\r\n  many of the Moore family members, including Moore, from a previous family land\r\n  dispute. Â Heckman testified Jeannette and her husband Thomas were purchasing\r\n  Moore's house to enable Moore to pay Allean her equitable distribution award. Â Heckman\r\n  stated he met with Jeannette and Moore in his conference room and explained\r\n  each document to Moore. Moore appeared to understand he was selling his\r\n  property. Â The proceeds check from the sale was made payable to Allean's\r\n  attorney. \r\nMoore testified he has a fifth-grade education and cannot read. Â He\r\n  also testified Jeannette took over paying his bills after his divorce. Â He\r\n  stated Jeannette would have him sign papers from time to time, but she did not\r\n  explain to him what he was signing. Â He denied gifting the funds from his\r\n  retirement account to Jeannette. Â He claimed he did not know he had signed a\r\n  power of attorney or closing documents to sell his property. Â Moore testified\r\n  he did not intend to sell the property to the Bensons, and he did not talk to\r\n  Heckman at the closing. Â He testified he was in the hall at Heckman's office\r\n  and Jeannette brought papers out for him to sign.\r\nJeannette testified Moore could read, stating he read the\r\n  newspaper, his driver's manual, and readings in church.Â  She testified she used\r\n  the money withdrawn from Moore's retirement account to pay his expenses, such\r\n  as his divorce attorney's fees of approximately $15,000, and medical bills. Â She\r\n  testified Moore asked her to obtain money to pay the equitable distribution\r\n  award from her siblings. Â She testified she could not get any of them to\r\n  provide financial help. \r\nJeannette took Moore to Heckman's office. Â According to her,\r\n  Heckman explained &quot;everything&quot; to Moore and he understood. Â She\r\n  agreed to pay all of the taxes and insurance on the house, and Moore could live\r\n  there for the remainder of his life. \r\nThomas, Jeannette's husband, testified he cashed in a $20,000\r\n  certificate of deposit, a savings bond worth more than $5,000, and borrowed\r\n  $20,000 to contribute to the purchase of the house. Â He stated Moore\r\n  contributed the remaining $10,000 from the funds transferred to Jeannette's\r\n  name. Â Thomas also testified he was at the closing, and Moore was present and\r\n  &quot;fine.&quot; \r\nThe master found Jeannette breached her fiduciary duty to Moore\r\n  and converted Moore's retirement account. Â He further found the Bensons paid\r\n  for the property partially with funds belonging to Moore. Â He also found the\r\n  Bensons intentionally concealed the truth from Moore and &quot;were not only\r\n  dishonest but in light of the facts of this case outrageous . . . .&quot; Â The\r\n  master ordered the Bensons to reconvey the property to Moore, pay actual\r\n  damages of $3,770.26, and pay punitive damages of $25,000. Â This appeal\r\n  followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;When legal and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, each retains its\r\n  own identity as legal or equitable for purposes of the applicable standard of review on appeal.&quot; Â Corley v. Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 92 n.1, 485 S.E.2d 97, 99 n.1 (1997). Â The reviewing court should &quot;view the actions separately for the purpose of determining the\r\n  appropriate standard of review.&quot; Â Jordan v. Holt, 362 S.C. 201, 205, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 129, 131 (2005). Â In an action in equity, tried by the judge alone, without a reference,\r\n  the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view\r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence. Â Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of\r\n    Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). Â On the other\r\n  hand, when reviewing an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a\r\n  jury, the appellate court's jurisdiction is limited to the correction of errors\r\n  at law, and the appellate court will not disturb the judge's findings of fact\r\n  as long as they are reasonably supported by the evidence. Â Epworth\r\n    Children's Home v. Beasley, 365 S.C. 157, 164, 616 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  \r\n\r\nI. Statute of Limitations\r\nThe\r\n  Bensons argue the master erred in denying their motion to dismiss based on the\r\n  statute of limitations. Â We disagree.\r\nThis\r\n  action is governed by a three-year statute of limitations period. S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (2005); see Mazloom v. Mazloom, 382 S.C. 307,\r\n  323, 675 S.E.2d 746, 755 (Ct. App. 2009) (citing three-year statute of\r\n  limitations in breach of fiduciary duty action); Turner v. Milliman, 381\r\n  S.C. 101, 109-10, 671 S.E.2d 636, 640 (Ct. App. 2009) (applying three-year\r\n  statute of limitations in fraud action). \r\nThe\r\n  discovery rule applies to this action. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (2005)\r\n  (applying the discovery rule to causes of action arising under section\r\n  15-3-530(5)); Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 394, 593 S.E.2d 183, 187&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004)\r\n  (stating &quot;[i]n determining when a\r\n  cause of action arose under\r\n  section 15-3-530, we apply the 'discovery rule'&quot;). Â According\r\n  to the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when a person\r\n  could or should have known, through the exercise of reasonable diligence that a\r\n  cause of action might exist. Â Abba Equip., Inc. v. Thomason, 335 S.C.\r\n  477, 485, 517 S.E.2d 235, 239 (Ct. App. 1999). Â The date on which discovery of the cause of action should have been\r\n  made is an objective question. Â Joubert v. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,\r\n  341 S.C. 176, 191, 534 S.E.2d 1, 9 (Ct. App. 2000). Â In Young v. South\r\n    Carolina Department of Corrections, this court stated:\r\n\r\n  In other words, whether the particular plaintiff actually knew he\r\n    had a claim is not the test. Rather, courts must decide whether the\r\n    circumstances of the case would put a person of common knowledge and experience\r\n    on notice that some right of his has been invaded, or that some claim against\r\n    another party might exist.\r\n\r\n333 S.C. 714,\r\n  719, 511 S.E.2d 413, 416 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nThe property transfer in this case was made on March 9, 2001. Â The\r\n  action was not filed until October 2006. Â Moore testified he first became aware\r\n  that something was amiss on December 25, 2005. When he was riding with the\r\n  Bensons to Christmas dinner at his son Robert's house, Thomas asked who had\r\n  permitted someone to park a truck on the subject property. Â Moore testified he had\r\n  concern about why Thomas was asking about his property. \r\nMoore's son, James Luther Moore, Jr., testified Moore rode home\r\n  with him from the Christmas dinner and Moore stated he heard Jeannette tell\r\n  Thomas to &quot;be quiet&quot; when Thomas asked about the vehicle parked on\r\n  the property. Â Moore allegedly explained to James that Thomas and Jeannette\r\n  acted like the property belonged to them. Â According to James, Moore was also\r\n  concerned that Thomas was picking up bottles and cans on the property and Moore\r\n  wanted James's son, Marcus, to check on it. \r\nMarcus testified Moore and his father asked him to look into\r\n  Moore's affairs a week or so after Christmas 2005. Â He found the property was\r\n  titled to the Bensons. Â He later took Moore to the bank and received the bank\r\n  records from 2000 to at least 2005. Â He explained the withdrawal of retirement funds\r\n  to Moore, who denied withdrawing any money. Â Marcus also took Moore to\r\n  Heckman's office to get copies of the closing documents on the property.\r\nIn this case, we look to when a person of common knowledge and\r\n  experience under the circumstances of the case would have known that he sold\r\n  his property to the Bensons. Â In light of the evidence that Jeannette handled\r\n  Moore's personal affairs, we affirm the master's finding that the statute of\r\n  limitations did not begin to run until Moore first had suspicions that\r\n  something was amiss in December 2005.\r\nII.&nbsp;Conversion\r\nThe\r\n  Bensons argue the master erred in finding Jeannette converted Moore's\r\n  retirement funds. Â We disagree.\r\n&quot;'Conversion'\r\n  is defined as the unauthorized\r\n  assumption and exercise of the rights of ownership over goods or personal\r\n  chattels belonging to another, to the alteration of their condition or to the\r\n  exclusion of the rights of the owner.&quot; Â Mullis v. Trident Emergency\r\n    Physicians, 351 S.C. 503, 506-07, 570 S.E.2d 549, 550-51&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).\r\n  Â An action for conversion is an action at law. Â Blackwell v. Blackwell,\r\n  289 S.C. 470, 471, 346 S.E.2d 731, 732&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986). Â Therefore, we\r\n  review the record to determine if any evidence supports the master's finding. Â See id. (finding in an action for conversion where the appeal is based on\r\n  alleged errors of fact, this court must affirm if there is any evidence reasonably\r\n  supporting the findings of the trial court).\r\nMoore presented evidence his retirement account was closed in\r\n  January 1999, and the retirement funds were deposited into Jeannette's account.\r\n  Â Moore testified he did not give the\r\n  retirement funds to Jeannette. Â During direct examination, Moore was asked:\r\n  &quot;Did you give that money to anybody? Did you make a gift of that\r\n  retirement money to anybody?&quot; Â Moore responded: &quot;No.&quot; Â We find evidence\r\n  to support the master's finding of conversion.\r\nIII. Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\nThe\r\n  Bensons next argue the master erred in finding Jeannette breached her fiduciary\r\n  duty to Moore. Â We disagree.\r\nOur\r\n  supreme court recently held that an action alleging a breach of fiduciary duty\r\n  is an action at law but &quot;may sound in equity if the relief sought is\r\n  equitable.&quot; Â Verenes v. Alvanos, 387 S.C. 11, 17, 690 S.E.2d 771,\r\n  773 (2010). Â The &quot;[c]haracterization\r\n  of an action as equitable or legal depends on the appellant's 'main purpose' in\r\n  bringing the action.'&quot; Â Id. at 16, 690 S.E.2d at 773 (quoting Ins.\r\n    Fin. Servs., Inc. v. S.C. Ins. Co., 271 S.C. 289, 293, 247 S.E.2d 315, 318\r\n  (1978)). Â We find the main purpose of the breach of fiduciary duty action in\r\n  this case was for the equitable remedy to rescind the contract and reconvey the\r\n  property to Moore. Â See Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388, 395, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 849, 852 (2005) (finding action to rescind contract and set aside deed\r\n  is in equity). Â Thus, we may find facts in accordance with our own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence. Â See Felts v. Richland County, 303\r\n  S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991) (stating appellate court may find\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence in\r\n  equitable actions).\r\n&quot;A\r\n  fiduciary relationship exists when one reposes special confidence in another,\r\n  so that the latter, in equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good\r\n  faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing\r\n  confidence.&quot; Â O'Shea v. Lesser, 308 S.C. 10, 15, 416 S.E.2d 629,\r\n  631 (1992). Â &quot;One standing in a fiduciary relationship with another is\r\n  subject to liability to the other for harm resulting from a breach of duty\r\n  imposed by the relation.&quot; Â Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 253, 599\r\n  S.E.2d 467, 473 (Ct. App. 2004); see In re Estate of Cumbee, 333\r\n  S.C. 664, 672, 511 S.E.2d 390, 394 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding fiduciary\r\n  relationship existed where a son had his mother's power of attorney and managed\r\n  her finances).\r\nLike\r\n  the master, we find the timing of the withdrawal to Jeannette on March 8, 2001,\r\n  of all funds in account #471, indicated the funds originally belonging to Moore\r\n  were used by the Bensons as part of the purchase price of the property. Â The\r\n  master further found Jeannette: \r\n\r\n  concocted\r\n    a scheme whereby the [Bensons] could purchase property of James Moore for\r\n    $56,294.41, which is approximately 37% of the value of the subject property . .\r\n    . . In addition, the purchase price paid was funded partially from the funds\r\n    that belonged to [Moore]. The [Bensons] through their intentional actions and\r\n    representations made to [Moore] concealed the truth of the transaction from\r\n    [Moore]. \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  master found Jeannette breached her fiduciary duty to Moore. Â After our own\r\n  review of the record, we likewise find Jeannette breached her fiduciary duty\r\n  owed to Moore and affirm the master's order directing the Bensons to reconvey\r\n  the property to Moore.\r\nIV. Property Taxes and\r\n  Insurance\r\nThe\r\n  Bensons argue the master erred in awarding damages by failing to credit them for property taxes and\r\n  insurance payments they allegedly made. Â We find no error. \r\nAlthough\r\n  Moore did not dispute the allegations and testimony that the Bensons paid these\r\n  items, the Bensons provided no documentary evidence in support of their claims.\r\n  Â The master, as the fact finder, was free to accept or reject the testimony. Â See S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. M&amp;T Enters. of Mt. Pleasant, LLC, 379 S.C.\r\n  645, 668 n.12, 667 S.E.2d 7, 20 n.12 (Ct. App. 2008) (finding the master in\r\n  equity, as the trier of fact, is free to accept or reject all of a witness's\r\n  testimony). Â We find no error by the master.\r\nV. Award of Damages to Moore\r\nThe Bensons argue the master\r\n  erred in finding Moore was entitled to damages because the master failed to\r\n  consider the equitable distribution award and the outstanding mortgage on the\r\n  property, paid on Moore's behalf from the proceeds of the sale.Â  We agree.\r\nThe Settlement Statement showed\r\n  that from the proceeds of the sale of the property, Allean Moore was paid\r\n  $52,851 and a mortgage on the property of $3,024.36 was paid in full, totaling\r\n  $55,875.36.Â  The master found Moore was entitled to damages of $3,770.26 by\r\n  subtracting the Bensons' contribution to the sales proceeds, $26,568.09, from\r\n  the amount in account #471 at the time of the closing, $30,338.35. Â However,\r\n  this fails to take into account Moore's debts of $55,875.36, which were paid\r\n  off at the closing. Â From this, we find Moore is entitled to a credit for his\r\n  retirement funds of $30,338.35, but must repay the Bensons for their\r\n  contribution to the payment of his debts of $25,537.01.[3]\r\nVI. Punitive Damages\r\nThe\r\n  Bensons argue the master erred in awarding punitive damages because there were\r\n  no actual damages. Â We agree. \r\nPunitive damages may only be awarded upon an underlying finding of actual damages. Â Keane v. Lowcounty Pediatrics, 372 S.C.\r\n  136, 148, 641 S.E.2d 53, 60 (Ct. App. 2007). Â In Keane, this court\r\n  reversed the actual damages award, on which an award of punitive damages was\r\n  based. Â Id. at 149, 641 S.E.2d at 60. Â Thus, this court likewise\r\n  reversed the punitive damages stating &quot;without a finding of actual damages\r\n  . . . the award of punitive damages is reversed.&quot; Â Id.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the master's award of actual damages failed to take into account\r\n  debts paid on Moore's behalf. Â As the final calculation of damages requires\r\n  Moore to reimburse the Bensons in the amount of $25,537.01, we find no actual\r\n  damages due to Moore, and reverse the award of punitive damages pursuant to Keane.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for entry\r\n  of judgment in accordance with this opinion.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT,\r\n  HUFF, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] The Purchase Contract is dated March 1, 2001.Â  The\r\n  HUD Settlement Statement and the Title to Real Estate are dated March 9, 2001.Â  \r\n[3] Moore argues this issue is not preserved for\r\n  appellate review.Â  The HUD-1 Settlement Statement, which included information\r\n  regarding the equitable distribution award and outstanding mortgage, was\r\n  introduced into evidence and considered by the master.Â  The master also ordered\r\n  a credit against Moore's award.Â  We find this issue was before the court and\r\n  preserved for our review.Â  See Spence v. Wingate, 381 S.C. 487,\r\n  489-90, 674 S.E.2d 169, 169 (2009) (finding an issue preserved despite the\r\n  failure to file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion where the issue was raised to and\r\n  ruled upon by the trial court). \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4746","title":"Crisp v.

Inc. (SouthCo.) argues the circuit court erred in its capacity\r\n  as an appellate court by reversing the Workers' Compensation Commission's\r\n  (Commission) finding that Michael Crisp (Crisp) did not sustain a physical\r\n  brain injury.Â  We agree and reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nCrisp was an\r\n  employee of SouthCo., a grassing and seeding company.Â  On March 10, 2004, Crisp\r\n  was assisting his coworkers in installing an erosion control fence.Â  The\r\n  installation of the fence required a Bobcat earthmover bucket to press poles\r\n  into the ground.Â  While Crisp was erecting a pole, the Bobcat bucket detached\r\n  and struck Crisp's head, neck, back, and right upper extremity.Â  Crisp was\r\n  admitted to Mary Black Memorial Hospital (the hospital) and was treated for\r\n  abrasions and bruises behind the back of his head and neck as well as injuries\r\n  to his back and right hand.Â  Additionally, Crisp sustained fractures to his\r\n  third and fourth metacarpal bones in his right hand.Â  On March 17, 2004, Dr.\r\n  James Essman performed surgery on the fractures.Â  Following surgery, Crisp\r\n  sought medical treatment from several physicians regarding his headaches and neck\r\n  and lower back pain.\r\nDr. J. Hunter\r\n  Leigh, a physician with Mountain View Family Practice, evaluated Crisp on March\r\n  26 and April 8, 2004 and diagnosed Crisp with cervical muscle strain and\r\n  fractures to his right hand.Â  Dr. John Klekamp, a physician with Piedmont\r\n  Orthopaedic Associates, evaluated Crisp on April 16, June 2, and July 7, 2004,\r\n  and diagnosed Crisp with cervical and lumbar strain and fractures to his\r\n  right hand.Â  \r\nDr. Kevin Kopera, a physician with the Center for\r\n  Health and Occupational Evaluation, evaluated Crisp on August 12, September 2,\r\n  September 23, and October 8, 2004.Â  Dr. Kopera concluded Crisp appeared to be\r\n  neurologically intact but ordered a MRI scan of Crisp's brain.Â  The MRI scan\r\n  did not reveal any abnormalities.\r\nDr. Robert Moss, a\r\n  psychologist, conducted a neuropsychological evaluation of Crisp on April\r\n  12-13, 2005.Â  Dr. Moss noted, \r\n\r\n\tOn the\r\n  basis of the current examination, there are clear indications of deficits in\r\n  verbal memory, attention, problem solving, and inhibition tied to his work\r\n  injury.Â  There are indications that he has likely experienced personality changes\r\n  as a result of his injury. . . . Mr. Crisp is experiencing psychological\r\n  distress from his injury as well.Â  The exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive\r\n  tendencies can also be associated with brain injuries involving the\r\n  orbito-frontal area.Â  This area is often affected in head injury cases due to\r\n  the irregular shape of the skull and olfaction is often affected since the\r\n  olfactory bulbs are there.Â  The current findings would be consistent with a\r\n  frontal lobe injury. \r\n\r\nDr. Moss diagnosed\r\n  Crisp with the following conditions: cognitive disorder not otherwise specified,\r\n  probable personality change due to head injury, exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive\r\n  tendencies, traumatic brain injury consistent with a frontal lobe injury, and poly-substance\r\n  abuse in full sustained remission.Â  Additionally, Dr. Moss concluded Crisp\r\n  could benefit from a brain injury program.\r\nOn May 24, 2005,\r\n  Dr. Thomas Collings, a neurologist, diagnosed Crisp with a closed head injury.Â \r\n  According to Dr. Collings, a closed head injury consists of &quot;trauma to the\r\n  brain in a global way as opposed to being a focal area of the brain and . . .\r\n  causes symptoms in . . . higher competent motions.&quot;Â  Dr. Collings asserted\r\n  Crisp's head injury appeared to be &quot;very minor,&quot; and Crisp did not\r\n  sustain a significant head injury based on his medical records and the low\r\n  frequency of headache complaints.Â  \r\nDr. Collings also\r\n  stated that he significantly relied on Dr. Moss' neuropsychological report,\r\n  even though there were some inconsistent findings compared to Crisp's medical\r\n  records and his personal observations.Â  However, Dr. Collings concluded Dr.\r\n  Moss' report should be followed to ascertain what happened to Crisp and to\r\n  monitor his underlying psychiatric and substance abuse problems.Â  \r\nDr. David Price, a\r\n  psychologist and adjunct associate professor with the Medical University of\r\n  South Carolina Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and the\r\n  University of South Carolina Upstate Department of Social and Behavioral\r\n  Sciences, concluded there was no credible evidence that Crisp sustained a brain\r\n  injury.Â  Dr. Price noted there was &quot;no objective medical evidence of a\r\n  brain injury such as an abnormal CT scan, MRI, or EEG&quot; and asserted Crisp\r\n  suffered from Substance-Induced Persisting Dementia.Â  Dr. Price diagnosed Crisp\r\n  with the following conditions: obsessive-compulsive disorder, antisocial\r\n  personality disorder, partner relational problem, adjustment disorder with\r\n  depressed mood, and phase of life problem.Â  The Commission concluded Dr. Moss'\r\n  expert report and opinions were more credible than Dr. Price's report.Â  \r\nThe Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commissioner (Commissioner) concluded Crisp sustained a head\r\n  injury resulting in cognitive disorders to his brain but not a physical brain\r\n  injury.Â  The Commission affirmed the Commissioner's order in its entirety.Â  The\r\n  circuit court reversed the Commission's ruling and concluded Crisp sustained a\r\n  physical brain injury.[1]Â \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the\r\n  standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306\r\n  (1981). The Commission is the ultimate fact finder in workers' compensation\r\n  cases and is not bound by the single commissioner's findings of fact.Â  Etheredge\r\n    v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 454, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The\r\n  findings of the Commission are presumed correct and will be set aside only if\r\n  unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Lark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d\r\n  at 306.Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the\r\n  evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence that,\r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Taylor\r\n    v. S.C. Dep't of Motor Vehicles, 368 S.C. 33, 36, 627 S.E.2d 751, 752 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSouthCo. argues the\r\n  circuit court erred in reversing the Commission's decision because substantial\r\n  evidence existed to support the Commission's finding that Crisp did not sustain\r\n  a physical brain injury.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n\r\n\tIn reversing the\r\n  Commission, the circuit court's order stated, \r\n\t\r\n\t\tFrom\r\n  the foregoing, it is apparent the Commission made findings consistent with all\r\n  of the symptoms and conditions on which Dr. Moss made his diagnosis of\r\n  traumatic brain injury and physical brain damage, including chronic headaches,\r\n  mild verbal memory problems, attention and concentration problems, problem\r\n  solving and inhibition problems, probable personality change due to head\r\n  injury, exacerbation of obsessive-compulsive tendencies, decrease in the sense\r\n  of smell, frontal lobe brain injury, traumatic closed head injury, and Cognitive\r\n  Disorder [not otherwise specified] . . . . Nevertheless, despite finding Dr.\r\n  Moss credible, adopting the findings of brain injury related symptoms and\r\n  conditions that he used to diagnose frontal lobe brain injury and physical\r\n  brain damage, and awarding treatment in a &quot;brain injury program&quot; he\r\n  recommended, the Commission determined that [Crisp] had not sustained physical\r\n  brain injury.Â  That conclusion contradicts the Commission's findings of brain\r\n  injury related conditions, such as Cognitive Disorder [not otherwise specified],\r\n  and is clearly erroneous.Â  The Commission rejected the other expert's report,\r\n  so there is no credible evidence on the record on which the Commission can base\r\n  its finding that claimant did not sustain physical brain damage.Â  \r\n\t\tTherefore,\r\n  because the only evidence on the record is that [Crisp] has sustained frontal\r\n  lobe brain injury and physical brain damage, it is the determination of this\r\n  Court that the Commission's finding to the contrary is erroneous, is not\r\n  supported by substantial evidence, and is reversed.Â  Furthermore, since the\r\n  only conclusion that can be reached on this evidence is that [Crisp] has\r\n  sustained frontal lobe brain injury and physical brain damage, this Court finds\r\n  as a matter of law that [Crisp] has sustained physical brain damage within the\r\n  meaning of the Act.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nTo the contrary, we\r\n  conclude the record is replete with substantial evidence to support the\r\n  Commission's finding that Crisp did not sustain a physical brain injury based\r\n  on Dr. Collings' testimony and the medical records of Crisp's physicians.Â  \r\nThe medical records\r\n  of the several physicians who treated Crisp following the accident support\r\n  reversal of the circuit court's decision.Â  The hospital's physicians did not\r\n  note any symptoms commonly attendant to a physical brain injury during Crisp's\r\n  treatment.Â  The physicians who evaluated Crisp following surgery did not\r\n  diagnose Crisp with a physical brain injury.Â  In fact, Dr. Kopera's MRI scan\r\n  did not reveal any abnormalities suggestive of a physical brain injury and\r\n  specifically opined Crisp was neurologically intact. \r\n\r\n\tFurthermore Dr. Collings testified, \r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhat's\r\n  missing to me and what was missing when I examined him myself and tried to\r\n  elicit this history is he doesn't seem to recall being hit in the head. He\r\n  wasn't complaining of head trauma or pain at the time.Â  He was not aware that\r\n  he had a cut on the head.Â  It was only when someone else was pointing out to\r\n  him and he was not immediately but very briefly able to get up and run after\r\n  the accident and was concerned about his hands.Â  All of those things stand in\r\n  contrast to someone who should've had a significant head injury.Â  Usually when\r\n  people have a significant head injury, closed head injury, they're knocked\r\n  out.Â  They're unconscious for a period of time and then they're confused when\r\n  they wake up from that and they're often unable to get up and would be ataxic\r\n  or have [no] control of their balance and so forth.Â  All of these things are\r\n  lacking in that report.Â  Did he have a head injury?Â  Yes, he had some type of\r\n  head injury but it appears from the records to be very minor. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nMoreover, Dr. Collings testified that Crisp's headaches were not a &quot;big part of the problem&quot;\r\n  during his evaluation and his headaches were &quot;out of character&quot; and\r\n  &quot;out of severity&quot; for a significant head injury stemming from the\r\n  accident.Â  Specifically, Dr. Collings stated,Â  \r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  fact that [the headaches are] missing in the record and only occasionally he\r\n  has chronic pain in his neck here but only occasional headaches implies that he\r\n  wasn't complaining a lot about headaches or seeking medication or seeking\r\n  treatment.Â  I find that all unusual if he has a significant head injury.Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Collings\r\n  further concluded he had &quot;great difficulty in finding any evidence to\r\n  support [a physical brain injury entitling Crisp to lifetime indemnity\r\n  benefits],&quot; in the absence of Dr. Moss' report and a vocational evaluation\r\n  which stated that Crisp was not employable.Â  \r\nEven though the\r\n  record presents conflicting evidence on the issue of whether Crisp suffered a\r\n  physical brain injury, we conclude the circuit court erred in reversing the\r\n  Commission.Â  See Pack v. State Dep't. of Transp.,&nbsp;381 S.C.\r\n  526, 536, 673 S.E.2d 461, 466&nbsp;(Ct.

Most of the witnesses testified that Jacques remained near his white\r\n  sedan, away from the fight, while Adams may have engaged in the melee.Â \r\n  However, Williams testified that Jacques was engaging in the fight and that she\r\n  saw Adams walk over to the white sedan, sit in the driver seat, reach under it,\r\n  pull out a gun, and fire what she recognized as a small caliber handgun, either\r\n  a .22 or .25.[2]Â \r\n  When the shots began, she retreated to the doorway of the bar to take cover.Â  Moments\r\n  later she claimed she heard another set of gunshots in the distance.Â  She\r\n  identified Adams as wearing jeans and a black tee shirt, although the other\r\n  witnesses and evidence presented at trial indicated it was Jacques in the black\r\n  tee shirt, and Adams was wearing a white tee shirt.Â  Many of the accounts point\r\n  to multiple sources of gunfire, but Williams maintains that Adams was the only\r\n  shooter.Â  During the melee, Dennis Irby was shot and killed by a single 9mm\r\n  shot to the back of the left shoulder.Â  \r\nAdams\r\n  spoke with the police twice.Â  He first stated that he was not in the white Ford\r\n  sedan with Jacques and did not see who did the shooting because he was in Lakisha Davis's car. Â He later admitted that after the altercation in\r\n  the parking lot began, he exited Lakisha's car, at her request, to retrieve her\r\n  cousin, Demetric.Â  Adams denied having or firing a gun that night.Â  \r\nJacques also gave two statements to the\r\n  police.Â  First he told the police that after he and his brother exited the bar,\r\n  Adams went to Lakisha Davis's car and he returned to his white Ford sedan.Â  He\r\n  said he noticed a man retrieve something from a nearby SUV and place it behind\r\n  his back, he suspected it was a gun but did not see it.Â  After the fight broke\r\n  out, Jacques stated Adams drove around in Lakisha's car, got out, and walked\r\n  over toward the fighting.Â  Although in his first statement Jacques denied he\r\n  had a gun, Jacques later admitted that upon suspecting Smith was going to hit\r\n  Adams, he pulled a gun and told Smith to &quot;back off.&quot; Â Jacques said he\r\n  then heard two shots and in response fired his 9mm three or four times &quot;into\r\n  the air&quot; as he got in his car and drove away.Â  He later disposed of his\r\n  gun by tossing it over a bridge.Â  \r\nAdams\r\n  and Jacques were both indicted for murder; Jacques was also indicted for\r\n  possession of a firearm by a person under the age of twenty-one.Â  The pair was\r\n  tried together.Â  At the close of the State's case, Adams unsuccessfully moved\r\n  for a directed verdict.Â  In addition, the trial court denied Adams's request to\r\n  instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter.Â  Both Adams and Jacques were\r\n  convicted of murder and sentenced to thirty years' imprisonment.Â  Adams appeals.\r\nISSUES\r\n  ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\tI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did\r\n  the trial court err in failing to direct a verdict on the charge of murder?\r\n\tII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did\r\n  the trial court err in failing to instruct the jury on involuntary\r\n  manslaughter?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases an appellate court\r\n  sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48,\r\n  625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Directed\r\n  Verdict\r\nAdams argues the trial court erred in\r\n  failing to direct a verdict on the charge of murder.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen ruling on a motion for a directed\r\n  verdict, the trial court is concerned only with the existence of evidence, not\r\n  the weight.Â  State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 411, 578 S.E.2d 32, 35 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2003).Â  When reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, an\r\n  appellate court must review the evidence, and all inferences therefrom, in the\r\n  light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292,\r\n  625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006).Â Â  The trial court's denial of a directed verdict will\r\n  not be reversed if supported by any direct evidence or substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence of the defendant's guilt.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the trial court denied Adams's motion for directed verdict, finding\r\n  sufficient evidence had been presented to allow the case to proceed to the jury\r\n  on the &quot;hand of one is the hand of all&quot; theory of liability.Â  Adams\r\n  argues the State presented insufficient evidence that he is responsible for the\r\n  victim's murder under an accomplice theory.Â  \r\n\r\n\tUnder the &quot;hand of one is the hand of\r\n  all&quot; theory of accomplice liability, one who joins with another to\r\n  accomplish an illegal purpose is liable\r\n  criminally for everything done by his confederate incidental\r\n  to the execution of the common design and purpose.Â  A defendant may be\r\n  convicted on a theory of accomplice liability pursuant to an indictment\r\n  charging him only with the principal offense.Â  [However,\r\n  m]ere presence and prior knowledge that a crime was going to be committed,\r\n  without more, is insufficient to constitute guilt.Â  [Rather,] presence at the\r\n  scene of a crime by pre-arrangement to aid, encourage, or abet in the\r\n  perpetration of the crime constitutes guilt as a principal.\r\n\r\nState\r\n  v. Thompson,\r\n  374 S.C. 257, 261-62, 647 S.E.2d 702, 704-05 (Ct. App. 2007) (internal\r\n  quotations and citations omitted).\r\n&quot;Under\r\n  an accomplice liability theory, 'a person must personally commit the crime or\r\n  be present at the scene of the crime and intentionally, or through a common\r\n  design, aid, abet, or assist in the commission of that crime through some overt\r\n  act.' &quot;Â  See State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 194, 562 S.E.2d\r\n  320, 325 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting State v. Langley, 334 S.C. 643,\r\n  648-49, 515 S.E.2d 98, 101 (1999)).Â  In order to establish the parties agreed\r\n  to achieve an illegal purpose, thereby establishing presence by\r\n  pre-arrangement, the State need not prove a formal expressed agreement, but\r\n  rather can prove the same by circumstantial evidence and the conduct of the\r\n  parties. Â Id. at 193, 562 S.E.2d at 324 (stating that under the hand of\r\n  one is the hand of all theory, &quot;[a] formally expressed agreement is not\r\n  necessary to establish the conspiracy&quot; which brings the accomplice to the\r\n  scene of the crime).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the State does not contend Adams fired the fatal shot.Â  Rather, the\r\n  State simply maintains there is sufficient circumstantial evidence that Adams agreed\r\n  to, and did, act in concert with Jacques to assault the Winnsboro group; thus,\r\n  sufficient evidence of Adams's guilt existed to submit the issue to the jury under\r\n  the hand of one is the hand of all theory.Â  In order to demonstrate that Adams\r\n  and Jacques intended to join together in a common design to achieve an illegal\r\n  purpose, the State maintains: (1) Adams called Jacques to the scene; (2) when\r\n  Jacques arrived he went inside the bar and Adams pointed out the group of\r\n  Winnsboro men, rather than leaving straight away; (3) Williams testified Adams\r\n  approached Jacques's white sedan in the parking lot and retrieved a gun moments\r\n  before the shooting; and (4) although separately, the two men fled the scene\r\n  after the shooting.Â  \r\nHere, at minimum, the evidence creates the\r\n  inferences that Adams informed Jacques of the situation, that the reason for\r\n  the call may not have been solely for the purpose of removing Adams from the scene,\r\n  and that Adams was aware a firearm was available for him to retrieve from\r\n  Jacques's white sedan.Â  When viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the\r\n  circumstantial evidence in this case infers Adams and Jacques may have acted in\r\n  concert in assaulting the men from Winnsboro. Â See State v. Ward,\r\n  374 S.C. 606, 615, 649 S.E.2d 145, 150 (Ct. App. 2007) (holding in a case with\r\n  similar facts, that evidence the defendant and his co-defendant together chased\r\n  after two men in the melee of a parking lot brawl and fired shots, killing a\r\n  bystander, was sufficient to overcome a directed verdict motion); see also Langley, 334 S.C. at 649, 515 S.E.2d at 101 (indicating evidence that the\r\n  defendant and co-defendant were seen together, circumstantial evidence placing\r\n  defendant at the scene of the crime, and eye-witness testimony, was sufficient\r\n  to warrant submitting the case to the jury on any theory of liability, including\r\n  the hand of one is the hand of all theory).Â  Accordingly, we find the trial\r\n  court did not abuse its discretion and affirm its denial of Adams's motion for\r\n  a directed verdict. \r\nII.&nbsp; Jury\r\n  Instruction\r\nAdams\r\n  next alleges the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on\r\n  involuntary manslaughter.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe evidence presented at trial\r\n  determines the law to be charged, and a trial court commits reversible error in\r\n  failing to give a requested charge on an issue raised by the evidence.Â  State\r\n    v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001).Â  In determining\r\n  whether to charge the lesser included offense of manslaughter the court must\r\n  view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Declining to charge the lesser included offense is warranted when it &quot;very\r\n  clearly appear[s] that . . . no evidence whatsoever [exists] tending to\r\n  reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter.&quot;Â  State v. Brayboy, 387\r\n  S.C. 174, 179, 691 S.E.2d 482, 485 (Ct. App. 2010); State v. Cole, 338\r\n  S.C. 97, 101, 525 S.E.2d 511, 513 (2000).Â  In order to amount to reversible\r\n  error, the failure to give a requested charge must be both erroneous and\r\n  prejudicial.Â  State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 232, 625 S.E.2d 239, 245\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).Â  \r\n\r\n\t&nbsp;Involuntary\r\n  manslaughter is:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1) the unintentional killing of another\r\n  without malice, but while engaged in an unlawful activity not naturally tending\r\n  to cause death or great bodily harm or (2) the unintentional killing of another\r\n  without malice, while engaged in a lawful activity with reckless disregard for\r\n  the safety of others. To constitute involuntary manslaughter, there must be a\r\n  finding of criminal negligence, statutorily defined as a reckless disregard of\r\n  the safety of others.Â  Recklessness is a state of mind in which the actor is\r\n  aware of his or her conduct, yet consciously disregards a risk which his or her\r\n  conduct is creating.Â  A person can be acting lawfully, even if he is in\r\n  unlawful possession of a weapon, if he was entitled to arm himself in\r\n  self-defense at the time of the shooting. The negligent handling of a loaded\r\n  gun will support a charge of involuntary manslaughter.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nBrayboy, 378 S.C. at\r\n  180, 691 S.E.2d at 485 (internal citations and quotations omitted). \r\nThe\r\n  State argues that under the hand of one is the hand of all theory, Adams is not\r\n  entitled to this charge because Jacques was either acting unlawfully or was not\r\n  lawfully armed in self-defense.Â  More specifically, the State argues\r\n  extensively that because Jacques was not acting in such a manner as to entitle\r\n  him to a self-defense instruction, he is thereby not lawfully armed in self-defense\r\n  for the purposes of an involuntary manslaughter charge.Â  However, our supreme\r\n  court has specifically pointed out there is a difference between being\r\n  &quot;armed in self-defense&quot; and &quot;acting in self-defense.&quot;[3]Â  State v. Light, 378 S.C. 641, 649, n.6, 664 S.E.2d 465, 469, n.6 (2008); State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 265, n.10, 513 S.E.2d 104, 109, n.10\r\n  (1999); see State v. Crosby, 355 S.C. 47, 52, 584 S.E.2d 110, 112\r\n  (2003)[4] (stating &quot;[a] person can be acting lawfully, even if he is in unlawful possession\r\n  of a weapon, if he was entitled to arm himself in self-defense at the time of\r\n  the shooting&quot;).Â  Thus, for the purposes of involuntary manslaughter, the\r\n  inquiries associated with whether or not to instruct on the defense of\r\n  self-defense are not applicable.Â  Light, 378 S.C. at 648-49, 664 S.E.2d 468-69.Â \r\n  Rather, the court is &quot;concerned only with whether [the defendant] had a\r\n  right to be armed for purposes of determining whether he was engaged in a\r\n  lawful act, i.e. was [he] lawfully armed, and not whether he actually acted in\r\n  self-defense when the shooting occurred.&quot; Â Id. at 649 n.6, 664\r\n  S.E.2d at 469 n.6. Â \r\nHowever, regardless of whether Jacques\r\n  was lawfully armed in self-defense, the essence of involuntary manslaughter is the\r\n  involuntary nature of the killing.Â  See Douglas v. State, 332\r\n  S.C. 67, 74, 504 S.E.2d 307, 310 (1998) (finding no involuntary manslaughter\r\n  charge warranted where defendant admitted he intentionally fired a gun into a\r\n  crowd in self-defense despite testimony that the defendant had been rushed by a\r\n  group of people during a fight); State v.

Nakatsu brought a\r\n  declaratory judgment action against Encompass Indemnity Company seeking to\r\n  stack underinsured (UIM) coverage from her sister's Encompass insurance policy\r\n  with her own UIM coverage from a different insurer.&nbsp; The trial court\r\n  granted summary judgment to Encompass finding the policy excluded UIM coverage\r\n  for resident relatives not operating covered vehicles.Â  Nakatsu appeals.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn December 16,\r\n  2007, Zunita Mattison ran a stop sign while driving and struck Nakatsu's\r\n  vehicle.Â  Mattison fled the scene in another vehicle and was apprehended at the\r\n  emergency room.Â  As a result of the collision, Nakatsu's car was totaled, and\r\n  she required surgery to repair a broken wrist and ankle.\r\nMattison's\r\n  insurance company paid Nakatsu $25,000, the limit on Mattison's policy.Â \r\n  Nakatsu also collected $25,000 in UIM coverage from the insurance policy she\r\n  maintained on her vehicle, which she was driving during the accident. At the\r\n  time of the accident, Nakatsu resided with Kellie and Kellie's husband, Adam\r\n  Buckner (collectively the Buckners).Â  The Buckners insured three vehicles under\r\n  a policy with Encompass; each vehicle had UIM limits of $50,000 per person and\r\n  $100,000 per accident. Â Their policy provided:\r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  consideration of an additional premium, if the Coverage Summary shows an amount\r\n  of &quot;Underinsured Motorists&quot; coverage, we will provide the coverage\r\n  described by the provisions of this endorsement.\r\n\tDEFINITIONS\r\n\tThe\r\n  following words and phrases are defined for this &quot;UNDERINSURED\r\n    MOTORISTS COVERAGE&quot; endorsement.Â  Only in regard to the coverage\r\n  provided by this endorsement, the following definitions replace any\r\n  corresponding definitions in the &quot;MOTOR VEHICLE&quot; Segment.\r\n\t1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Covered Person means:\r\n\t\r\n\t\ta.&nbsp; You for the ownership, maintenance\r\n  or use of any vehicle, except while occupying, or when struck by,\r\n  a vehicle owned by you which is not insured for by this coverage under this\r\n  policy;\r\n\t\tb.&nbsp; Any family member:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1) Who does not\r\n  own an automobile, for the maintenance or use of any vehicle;\r\n\t\t\t(2)Â  Who owns an automobile, but only for the use of an \r\n\t\t\tinsured motor\r\n  vehicle;\r\n\t\t\tExcept\r\n  while occupying, or when struck by, a vehicle owned by you or\r\n  that person which is not insured for this coverage under this policy;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tc.&nbsp; Any other person occupying an insured motor vehicle with your consent, except when struck by\r\n  a vehicle owned by you or that person which is not insured for this coverage\r\n  under this policy;\r\n\t\t. . . . \r\n\t\r\n\t2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insured Motor Vehicle means:\r\n\t\r\n\t\ta.&nbsp; An automobile, motorcycle or motorhome shown in the Coverage Summary if the Coverage Summary\r\n  indicates &quot;Underinsured Motorists&quot; coverage for that vehicle.Â  This\r\n  includes an automobile, motorcycle or motorhome that replaces one\r\n  shown in the Coverage Summary, if you ask us to insure the automobile, motorcycle or motorhome, and we agree.\r\n\t\tb.&nbsp; Additional automobiles, motorcycles or motorhomes for 30 days after you become the owner, provided all\r\n  the other automobiles, motorcycles and motorhomes owned by you are either covered\r\n  by us or excluded by endorsement.\r\n\t\tFor\r\n  coverage beyond the 30 days, you must ask us to insure the automobile, motorcycle or motorhome, and we must agree.\r\n\t\tc.&nbsp; An automobile, motorcycle, motorhome or trailer not owned by you or a\r\n\t\tfamily member if being temporarily used while an automobile, motorcycle or\r\n  motorhome shown in the Coverage Summary is out of its normal use because of its\r\n  breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction.Â  It must not be available or\r\n  furnished for the regular use of you or any family member.\r\n\t\td.&nbsp; An automobile, motorcycle, motorhome or trailer not owned by you or any\r\n\t\tfamily member if being operated by you.Â  This vehicle must not be furnished for the regular\r\n  use of you or any family member.\r\n\t\t. .\r\n  . .\r\n\t\r\n\r\nNakatsu brought a\r\n  declaratory judgment action against Encompass seeking to stack up to $74,999.99\r\n  in UIM coverage from the Buckners' policy, $25,000 for each of their three\r\n  cars, to the $25,000 in UIM coverage from her own policy.[1]Â \r\n  Nakatsu stipulated the policy does not allow her UIM coverage because she was\r\n  operating a vehicle not insured under the policy but argued that provision was\r\n  invalid.Â  Encompass moved for summary judgment, asserting the policy did\r\n  not allow UIM coverage for resident relatives not driving covered vehicles and\r\n  South Carolina case law allowed such a provision.Â  Nakatsu also moved for\r\n  summary judgment, arguing because she is a Class I insured, she was entitled to\r\n  stack UIM coverage and the policy's language to the contrary violates South\r\n  Carolina statutory law.Â  The trial court granted Encompass's motion, relying on Burgess v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 373 S.C. 37, 644 S.E.2d 40\r\n  (2007).Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe purpose of\r\n  summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases not requiring the\r\n  services of a fact finder.&nbsp; George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548\r\n  S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).&nbsp; When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment\r\n  motion, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under\r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as\r\n  to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter\r\n  of law.&nbsp; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860\r\n  (2002).&nbsp; In determining whether a genuine issue of fact exists, the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from it must be viewed in the\r\n  light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Sauner v. Pub. Serv.\r\n    Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).&nbsp; \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nNakatsu\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting Encompass summary judgment because the\r\n  policy excluded stacking of UIM coverage for resident relatives not driving\r\n  covered vehicles.Â  She contends that exclusion is invalid because it is inconsistent\r\n  with statutory provisions and Burgess v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.,\r\n  373 S.C. 37, 644 S.E.2d 40 (2007), is inapplicable to this case.Â  We agree.\r\n&quot;Stacking\r\n  refers to an insured's recovery of damages under more than one insurance policy\r\n  in succession until all of his damages are satisfied or until the total limits\r\n  of all policies have been exhausted.&quot;Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.\r\n    v. Moorer, 330 S.C. 46, 60, 496 S.E.2d 875, 883&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998).Â  &quot;The\r\n  critical question in determining whether an insured has the right to stack is\r\n  whether he is a Class I or Class II insured.&quot; Â Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v.\r\n    Hill,&nbsp;323 S.C. 208, 211, 473 S.E.2d 843, 845&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996).Â \r\n  &quot;The two classes of insureds are: (1) the named insured, his spouse and\r\n  relatives residing in his household; and (2) any person using, with the consent\r\n  of the named insured, the motor vehicle to which the policy applies and a guest\r\n  in the motor vehicle.&quot; Â Concrete Servs., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar.\r\n    Co., 331 S.C. 506, 509, 498 S.E.2d 865, 866&nbsp;(1998); see also Hill,&nbsp;323\r\n  S.C. at 211, 473 S.E.2d at 845&nbsp;(citation omitted) (&quot;A Class I insured\r\n  is an insured or named insured who has a vehicle involved in the accident. Â An\r\n  insured is a Class II insured if none of his vehicles are involved in the\r\n  accident.&quot;). Â Only a Class I insured may stack. Â Hill,&nbsp;323\r\n  S.C. at 211, 473 S.E.2d at 845.Â  \r\n&quot;Statutory\r\n  provisions relating to an insurance contract are part of the contract as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  To the extent a policy provision conflicts with an applicable\r\n  statutory provision, the statute prevails.&quot; Â State Farm Mut.\r\n    Auto. Ins. Co. v. Calcutt, 340 S.C. 231, 234, 530 S.E.2d 896, 897 (Ct. App.\r\n  2000) (citation omitted).Â  &quot;Generally, stacking of additional coverage for\r\n  which the insured has contracted is permitted unless limited by statute or a\r\n  valid policy provision.&quot;Â  Ruppe\r\n    v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 329 S.C. 402, 404, 496 S.E.2d 631,\r\n  631-32&nbsp;(1998).Â  &quot;[S]tacking may be prohibited by contract if such a\r\n  prohibition is consistent with statutory insurance requirements.&quot;Â  Id. at 406, 496 S.E.2d at 633.Â  &quot;[UIM] coverage is controlled by and subject\r\n  to our [UIM] act, and any insurance policy provisions inconsistent therewith\r\n  are void, and the relevant statutory provisions prevail as if embodied in the\r\n  policy.&quot;Â Kay v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 349 S.C. 446, 450,\r\n  562 S.E.2d 676, 678&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).\r\n&quot;Statutorily\r\n  required coverage is that which is required to\r\n  be offered or provided.&quot;Â  Ruppe,&nbsp;329 S.C. at 404-05, 496\r\n  S.E.2d at 632.Â  &quot;[A]n insurer must offer UIM coverage pursuant to\r\n  [section] 38-77-160 when the insurer extends statutorily required liability\r\n  coverage.&quot;Â  Howell v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Ins. Co., 370 S.C. 505,\r\n  510, 636 S.E.2d 626, 629&nbsp;(2006).Â  Stacking of UIM coverage, which is a\r\n  statutorily required coverage, is governed specifically by statute.Â  Ruppe,\r\n  329 S.C. at 405, 496 S.E.2d at 632 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002)).\r\n  &quot;Construing specific statutory language [found in section 38-77-160], we have held an insured is entitled\r\n  to stack [UIM] . . . coverage in an amount no greater than the amount of\r\n  coverage on the vehicle involved in the accident.&quot;Â  Id. (footnote\r\n  omitted). Â &quot;To this extent, stacking cannot be contractually prohibited.&quot;\r\n  Â Id.\r\n&quot;South\r\n  Carolina courts have interpreted [section 38-77-160] to allow Class I insureds\r\n  to stack UIM coverage from multiple automobile insurance policies.&quot;Â  Kay,\r\n  349 S.C. at 449, 562 S.E.2d at 678.Â  Section 38-77-160 (emphasis added) provides:\r\n\r\n\tAutomobile\r\n  insurance carriers . . . shall . . . offer, at the option of the insured, [UIM]\r\n  coverage up to the limits of the insured liability coverage to provide coverage\r\n  in the event that damages are sustained in excess of the liability limits\r\n  carried by an at-fault insured or underinsured motorist or in excess of any\r\n  damages cap or limitation imposed by statute. Â If, however, an insured or\r\n    named insured is protected by . . . [UIM] coverage in excess of the basic\r\n    limits, the policy shall provide that the insured or named insured is protected\r\n    only to the extent of the coverage he has on the vehicle involved in the\r\n    accident. Â If none of the insured's or named insured's vehicles is involved\r\n  in the accident, coverage is available only to the extent of coverage on any\r\n  one of the vehicles with the excess or underinsured coverage. Â \r\n\r\nIn Kay,\r\n  349 S.C. at 449-50, 562 S.E.2d at 678, this court determined a provision in a\r\n  policy that only allowed stacking equal to the amount of the minimum limits,\r\n  regardless of the amount of UIM coverage on the vehicle in the accident,\r\n  violated section 38-77-160.Â  The court found a &quot;provision limiting\r\n  stacking of UIM coverage to the minimum limits is invalid because it purports\r\n  to limit the amount of coverage to an amount less than that available on the\r\n  involved vehicle's policy.&quot;Â  Kay, 349 S.C. at 449, 562 S.E.2d at\r\n  678.\r\nIn Jackson\r\n  v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 288 S.C. 335, 337, 342 S.E.2d 603, 604 (1986), the\r\n  court held, &quot;A policy provision which purports to limit stacking of\r\n  statutorily-required coverage is invalid.&quot; But see Ruppe, 329\r\n  S.C. at 405, 496 S.E.2d at 632 (finding the rule that stacking of statutorily\r\n  required coverage cannot be contractually prohibited is an oversimplification\r\n  of our stacking law and declining to apply it to the stacking of liability\r\n  coverage).\r\nBoth\r\n  the trial court and Encompass relied on Burgess in support of finding\r\n  the policy does not violate statutory law.Â  In Burgess, 373 S.C. at 39,\r\n  644 S.E.2d at 41, the insured did not have UIM coverage on the vehicle in the\r\n  accident but had it on another vehicle he owned.Â  The insurance policy for the\r\n  vehicle in the accident did not allow UIM coverage when the insurance was\r\n  driving another vehicle he owned but that did not have UIM coverage.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The Burgess court noted the &quot;'[i]f, however' sentence in [section]\r\n  38-77-160, relied upon by Nationwide here, does not literally apply to these\r\n  facts since Burgess is not attempting to stack excess UIM coverage from his\r\n  Nationwide policy.&quot; Burgess, 373 S.C. at 41, 644\r\n  S.E.2d at 42.Â  The court further observed because &quot;Burgess seeks recovery\r\n  under only one policy, technically he is not seeking to stack coverage.&quot;Â  Id. at 41 n.1, 64 S.E.2d at 42 n.1.Â  The supreme court\r\n  posited:\r\n\r\n\t[T]his\r\n  statutory language does provide support for Nationwide's contention that its\r\n  policy provision does not violate public policy.Â  The &quot;[i]f, however&quot; sentence in\r\n  [section] 38-77-160 evinces the legislature's intent, in a stacking situation,\r\n  to bind the insured to the amount of UIM coverage he chose to purchase in the\r\n  policy covering the vehicle involved in the accident. Â Thus, the statute itself\r\n  contains a limit on the &quot;portability&quot; of UIM coverage.Â  \r\n\r\nBurgess, 373 S.C. at 41, 64 S.E.2d at 42-43.Â  The court held public policy is not offended by an\r\n  automobile insurance policy provision that limits the portability of basic UIM\r\n  coverage when the insured has a vehicle involved in the accident.Â  Id. at 42, 644 S.E.2d at 43.\r\nBecause\r\n  Nakatsu was living with her sister at the time of the accident, she is a\r\n  resident relative.Â  Therefore, Nakatsu is a Class I insured under her sister's\r\n  policy.Â  The issue in this case is whether Nakatsu can stack the Buckners' UIM\r\n  coverage.Â  Burgess, as the opinion notes, did not involve stacking; it\r\n  involved portability.Â  These are two distinct concepts.Â  Stacking is only allowed\r\n  if the insured has the specific type of coverage on the vehicle involved in the\r\n  accident.Â  On the other hand, portability refers to a person's ability to use\r\n  his coverage on a vehicle not involved in an accident as a basis for recovery of\r\n  damages sustained in the accident.Â  \r\nThe Burgess court found disallowing Burgess UIM coverage did not offend public policy\r\n  because he had declined UIM coverage.Â Â  That is not the case here.Â  Nakatsu has\r\n  UIM coverage on the car in the accident through a policy she obtained on that\r\n  car.Â  She is simply seeking to stack coverage from the Buckners' policy, under\r\n  which she is a Class I insured.Â  The policy provision conflicts with section\r\n  38-77-160 because it does not allow a Class I insured to stack UIM coverage up\r\n  to the limits of the vehicle in the accident in certain situations, such as the\r\n  one here.Â  Accordingly, that provision of the policy is void, and the trial\r\n  court erred in granting Encompass summary judgment.[2]Â \r\n  Therefore, the trial court's grant of summary judgment to Encompass is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nGEATHERS\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Although the Buckners' UIM limits were $50,000 per\r\n  car, Nakatsu acknowledged she would only be permitted to stack $25,000 per car\r\n  because that is the amount she carried on her vehicle. Â See S.C. Farm\r\n    Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mooneyham, 304 S.C. 442, 446, 405 S.E.2d 396, 398\r\n  (1991) (&quot;[T]he amount of coverage which may be stacked from policies on\r\n  vehicles not involved in an accident is limited to an amount no greater than\r\n  the coverage on the vehicle involved in the accident.&quot;). \r\n[2] Nakatsu argues Encompass should be estopped from\r\n  denying she is an insured under the policy because Encompass cited her driving\r\n  record including this accident as a reason for non-renewal.Â  Because our\r\n  determination of the prior issue is dispositive, we need not address this\r\n  issue.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n  613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review\r\n  remaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the\r\n  appeal).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4749","title":"SC Department of Consumer Affairs v.

Decell (Respondents) violated the Consumer Credit Counseling Act.[1]Â \r\n  The Department claimed Respondents engaged in &quot;credit\r\n  counseling service&quot; without having first obtained a license to do so.Â  The\r\n  ALC granted the petition in part, issued a &quot;cease and desist&quot; order,\r\n  and imposed an administrative fine.Â  However, the Department also requested an order requiring Respondents to &quot;refund\r\n  all monies collected under contracts entered into with South Carolina consumers\r\n  after December 1, 2005.&quot;Â  The administrative law judge ruled that\r\n  the ALC does not have the power to grant that relief. Â The Department appeals\r\n  this ruling.Â  We affirm.\r\nThe scope of the power of\r\n  the ALC is a question of law, which we review de novo.Â  See Town of Summerville v. City of N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40,\r\n  41 (2008) (&quot;Determining the proper interpretation of a\r\n  statute is a question of law, and this Court reviews questions of law de\r\n  novo.&quot;).\r\nWe\r\n  frame the issue before us by reviewing, first, the statutes Respondents\r\n  violated, and second, the statutory power of the Department to seek, and the\r\n  ALC to grant, various forms of relief. Â The Consumer Credit Counseling Act (the\r\n  Act) was enacted in 2005.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-7-101 (Supp. 2009).Â \r\n  Pursuant to the Act, no person may engage in credit counseling service[2] without a license. Â Id. Â§ 102.Â  The required license is issued by the\r\n  Department of Consumer Affairs.Â  See id. Â§Â§ 102, 104, 107(A).[3]Â \r\n  The ALC found that Respondents violated the Act by engaging in credit\r\n  counseling service without a license. \r\nThe\r\n  Act grants the Department administrative powers to address this type of\r\n  violation.Â  Id. Â§ 119. Â The South Carolina Consumer Protection Code (the\r\n  Code) also grants powers to the Department.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  37-6-101 to -113 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  The Code provides that the\r\n  Administrator of the Department may file a petition before the ALC to seek\r\n  enforcement of administrative orders issued pursuant to section 37-7-119, or\r\n  otherwise to seek compliance with the Act. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  37-6-108(A), (C) (Supp. 2009).Â  The ALC has exclusive jurisdiction over such an\r\n  action for enforcement. Â Id. Â§ 108(B).Â  In addition to these\r\n  administrative powers, the Code provides that the Administrator may bring a\r\n  &quot;civil action against . . . a person subject to this title to recover actual damages sustained and excess charges paid by\r\n  one or more consumers.&quot; Â Id. Â§ 113(A). \r\nThe\r\n  refund sought by the Department in this case is &quot;actual damages sustained\r\n  and excess charges paid by one or more consumers.&quot;Â  There is no statutory\r\n  authority to seek such relief except in a &quot;civil action&quot; under\r\n  section 37-6-113(A).Â  The Department may bring a civil action in circuit court.Â  This appeal requires us to determine whether the\r\n  Department may also bring a civil action in the ALC to recover the relief\r\n  provided for in section 37-6-113(A).Â  The answer to that question will\r\n  determine whether the ALC has the power to grant to the Department the refund\r\n  it seeks from these Respondents. We conclude the Department has no statutory\r\n  authority to bring a civil action in the ALC, and thus the ALC was correct in\r\n  finding it did not have the power to grant the Department the refund it\r\n  requested.\r\nThe\r\n  General Assembly amended the Consumer Protection Code in 2005.[4]Â \r\n  The former version of section 37-6-108 provided &quot;the Administrator may\r\n  obtain an order of the court for enforcement of its order in the court of\r\n  common pleas.&quot;[5]Â \r\n  The circuit court's jurisdiction over such actions was exclusive.[6]Â \r\n  The Administrator also had the right to bring a civil action before the 2005\r\n  amendments.Â  The former version of section 37-6-113 set forth three different\r\n  types of civil actions the Administrator could bring, including &quot;a civil\r\n  action against a creditor to recover actual damages sustained and excess\r\n  charges paid by one or more consumers . . . .&quot;[7]Â \r\n  Before 2005, there was no statutory authority for the Administrator to bring\r\n  any action in the ALC.Â  It is apparent, therefore, that before the 2005\r\n  amendments, a civil action could be brought only in circuit court. \r\nWith\r\n  the 2005 amendments, the Code now distinguishes between an &quot;administrative\r\n  action,&quot; which must be brought in the ALC, from a &quot;civil action.&quot;\r\n  Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 37-6-108(A); 37-6-113(C) (Supp. 2009). There is\r\n  nothing in the 2005 amendments that changes the procedure that a civil action\r\n  has to be brought in circuit court.Â  Because the relief sought by the\r\n  Department in this case is available only in a civil action pursuant to section\r\n  37-6-113(A), and because a civil action must still be brought in circuit court,\r\n  the ALC was correct in ruling that it did not have the power to grant the\r\n  relief.\r\nFurther,\r\n  when the General Assembly revised the Code in 2005 and created the administrative\r\n  action under section 37-6-108, it placed limitations on the power of the ALC. Â Under\r\n  subsection 37-6-108(F), &quot;the administrative law\r\n  judge may not award damage[s] . . . to affected customers in these hearings.&quot;\r\n  Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-6-108(F) (Supp. 2009).Â  This subsection precludes the ALC\r\n  from granting the type of relief the Department requested.\r\nThe\r\n  Department argues, however, that the ALC has inherent powers and equitable\r\n  powers through which it may grant the requested relief.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  Department argues that two provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act,\r\n  sections 1-23-600(F) and 1-23-630(A), provide the ALC authority to grant the\r\n  requested relief as an equitable remedy.Â  This argument fails for two reasons. Â First,\r\n  the refund sought by the Department in this case is legal, not equitable. Â Second,\r\n  the statutes do not provide what the Department contends.Â  Section 1-23-600(F)\r\n  provides &quot;a state agency authorized by law to\r\n  seek injunctive relief may apply to the Administrative Law Court for injunctive\r\n  or equitable relief pursuant to Section 1-23-630.&quot;\r\n  Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(F) (Supp. 2009).Â  Section 1-23-630(A)\r\n  provides that an administrative law judge &quot;has\r\n  the same power at chambers or in open hearing as do circuit court judges and to\r\n  issue those remedial writs as are necessary to give effect to its jurisdiction.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-630(A) (2005). Â We do not believe it is necessary\r\n  for us to decide exactly what effect these statutes have on the power of the\r\n  Department or the ALC.Â  The statutes do not grant the Department or the ALC\r\n  authority to exceed their statutorily granted powers.Â  See generally Responsible Econ. Dev. v. S.C. Dep't of Health\r\n    &amp; Envtl. Control, 371 S.C. 547, 553, 641 S.E.2d 425, 428 (2007) (&quot;[R]egulatory\r\n  bodies . . . have only the authority granted them by the legislature.&quot;); see\r\n    also Randolf R. Lowell, South Carolina Administrative Practice and\r\n      Procedure, 152 (2d ed. 2008) (&quot;The ALC has no authority to decide\r\n  civil matters or to award monetary damages in cases.&quot;).\r\nWe hold that the\r\n  Administrative Law Court does not have the power to grant the Department of\r\n  Consumer Affairs a refund of fees paid by consumers for credit counseling\r\n  service when the provider of those services has violated the Consumer Credit\r\n  Counseling Act.Â  An action for this relief is a civil action under section\r\n  37-6-113(A) of the South Carolina Code, and must be brought in circuit court.Â \r\n  The decision of the ALC is \r\naffirmed.\r\nTHOMAS and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 37-7-101 to -122 (Supp. 2009).\r\n[2] This term is defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-7-101(3)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).\r\n[3] The Consumer Credit Counseling Act is enforced by the Department of Consumer Affairs.Â  See also S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 37-7-101(9) (Supp. 2009).\r\n[4] Act No. 128, 2005 S.C. Acts 1507.\r\n[5] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-6-108(1) (2002) (former version).\r\n[6] Id. Â§ 108(4) (2002).Â  Any doubt that this\r\n  &quot;exclusive&quot; jurisdiction provision referred to circuit court is\r\n  resolved by the same subsection, which provided that a &quot;final judgment or\r\n  decree may be appealed in the manner provided by the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\n  Rules.&quot;Â  Appeals from the ALC filed before July 1, 2006, went to circuit\r\n  court. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610\r\n  (2005) (former version); Â§ 1-23-610 (Supp. 2009) (current version providing\r\n  appeal to court of appeals); Act No. 387, Â§ 57, 2006 S.C. Acts 3132 (providing\r\n  effective date of amendment to be July 1, 2006). Â The Appellate Court Rules do\r\n  not apply in circuit court. Â The only appeal that could be governed by the\r\n  Appellate Court Rules before July 1, 2006, was from circuit court to the court\r\n  of appeals.\r\n[7] S.C. Code Ann.
