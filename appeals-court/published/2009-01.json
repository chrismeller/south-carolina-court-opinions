Barr, of Mount Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKONDUROS,\r\n  J.:Â In this workerâ€™s compensation action, Sandra Bartley[1] appeals the Appellate Panelâ€™s failure to find her\r\n  totally and permanently disabled, arguing it failed to consider the combined\r\n  effects of a workplace injury and a pre-existing problem.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  September 26, 2002, Bartley was employed as a teacher at Fairfax Elementary School for the Allendale County School District (the District).Â  During recess, a\r\n  fifth-grade student with cerebral palsy ran towards Bartley to give her a hug.Â \r\n  The student inadvertently knocked Bartley down onto some tree roots and fell on\r\n  top of her.Â  Bartley did not go to an emergency room for treatment but had\r\n  cervical fusion surgery on May 14, 2003.Â  On July 18, 2003, Bartley filed a\r\n  Form 50, alleging injuries from the incident (the Allendale incident) to the\r\n  right shoulder, neck, right arm and hand, left knee, and migraine headaches.\r\nOn\r\n  July 24, 2003, her treating physician, Dr. Scott Strohmeyer, noted that Bartley\r\n  was doing great, her neck was great, and she was in no pain.Â  Because Bartleyâ€™s\r\n  husband had lost his job in Allendale, they moved to Columbia to live with his\r\n  parents.Â  Bartley was feeling better and in August 2003 she began\r\n  teaching special education in Richland County at Richland One.Â  She completed a\r\n  medical questionnaire indicating she did not have a problem with arthritis,\r\n  back pain, joint pain, or any other chronic illness.Â  While working at Richland\r\n  One, she began having new symptoms after lifting heavy books and working long\r\n  hours.Â  In October 2003, at Richland One, a student lifted a desk and threatened\r\n  to throw it at her.Â  The incident (the Richland incident) made Bartley\r\n  feel fearful again and brought back the memories of being physically hurt.Â  On\r\n  July 8, 2004, Dr. Strohmeyer noted â€œshe did very well from [the cervical fusion]\r\n  and then she went back to teaching school and had another incident with a\r\n  student and, since that time, she has had a lot of neck pain, right-sided arm\r\n  pain, lower back pain and pain down her leg.â€ Â In September 2004,\r\n  Bartley had fusion surgery in her lower back as a result of a large facet cyst.Â \r\n  On December 10, 2004, Bartley filed another Form 50, alleging injuries to the\r\n  buttocks, right leg, dizziness, ringing in the ears, and psychological overlay.\r\nOn August 8, 2005,\r\n  the single commissioner conducted a hearing.Â  At the hearing, Bartley testified\r\n  that about a week after the accident, she noticed she could not raise her right\r\n  arm to write on the blackboard.Â  As time progressed, she could not get\r\n  out of bed without assistance.Â  She further testified she had children\r\n  at school carry her books for her, had trouble walking, and stopped exercising.\r\nHowever,\r\n  Bartley testified that following the cervical fusion, she started doing better;\r\n  her headaches and ringing in her ear were better and she regained the range of\r\n  motion in her right arm.Â  She also testified she â€œhad initially done\r\n  well [after the surgery] but after doing a lot of the lifting and everything\r\n  the pain had began . . . .â€ Â Further, Bartley indicated she did not feel\r\n  fearful after her cervical fusion but the Richland incident â€œmade [her] feel\r\n  fearful again.â€Â  Additionally, she discussed her lower back fusion but\r\n  explained â€œI donâ€™t think my low back problem is related to [the Allendale\r\n  incident].â€\r\nAt\r\n  the time of the hearing, Bartley asserted she was having problems with her neck\r\n  hurting, back pain, lack of strength in her right arm, loss of balance, and\r\n  dizziness.Â  She also testified she was having problems with her memory;\r\n  she would pay bills more than once, get lost while driving, or forget to take\r\n  her medicine.\r\nThe\r\n  District presented evidence, including Bartleyâ€™s own testimony, she had\r\n  problems with depression dating back to 1987.Â  In March of 2001, she\r\n  visited a doctor because she had nausea and dizziness and blacked out.Â  At\r\n  the visit, she said she had three other episodes when she was nauseated and\r\n  almost blacked out.Â  Additionally, in January of 2002, she informed her\r\n  doctor her migraines had gotten worse.Â  In February 2002, it was noted\r\n  on her patient chart she â€œsuffers from fibromyalgia and also depression and\r\n  migraine headaches.Â  She comes in with multiple complaints. . . . She has an\r\n  increase in her migraines.Â  She states that she used to get a couple a year and\r\n  over the last four to five weeks she has had several.â€Â  She also\r\n  complained of ringing in her ears at that doctorâ€™s visit, which the doctor\r\n  believed was likely Eustachian tube dysfunction. Â The chart also\r\n  contained a notation that Bartley appeared to be more depressed.Â  Dr.\r\n  Mark Lencke believed a congenital Chiari-1 malformation at the base of her\r\n  skull might be causing her neck pain and depression as well as chronic\r\n  headaches.Â  Bartley also testified at the hearing she previously was in\r\n  abusive marriage and had been abused as a child.Â  Additionally, she\r\n  testified she had been taking Adderall beginning in 1999 after telling her\r\n  doctor she had â€œalways been disorganized and unfocused.â€\r\nThe\r\n  District also presented a letter from Dr. Strohmeyer, dated January 27, 2005,\r\n  in which he responded to the question: â€œ[I]is the condition of lumbar stenosis\r\n  related to the accident that happened in October 2003 at the patientâ€™s\r\n  employment[?]â€Â  He answered, â€œThat is difficult to assess.Â  She had a facet\r\n  disk that has caused severe stenosis.Â  These can be trauma related or just from\r\n  degenerative changes.Â  It is very difficult to rule out trauma as being a contributing\r\n  problem to that condition.â€\r\nBartley\r\n  presented opinions of doctors and a physical therapist that she suffers from\r\n  post-traumatic stress.Â  Additionally, at his deposition, Dr. Strohmeyer\r\n  explained Bartley was still having problems related to the Allendale incident\r\n  or the cervical fusion.Â  Dr. Strohmeyer stated he did not think she\r\n  could handle the physical demands of being a special needs school teacher.Â  He\r\n  also agreed Bartley was probably disabled from working full time and thought\r\n  that was due to the Allendale incident.\r\nThe\r\n  single commissioner found Bartley suffered an injury to her neck arising in and\r\n  out of the course of employment on September 26, 2002.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  commissioner determined Bartley had suffered a thirty percent permanent loss of\r\n  use of her back.Â  The commissioner gave the physical therapistâ€™s opinion that\r\n  Bartley suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder no weight because she was\r\n  not a medical doctor or psychiatrist.Â  The commissioner further noted Dr.\r\n  Drummond discussed post-traumatic stress disorder but did not link it to the\r\n  Allendale incident. Â The commissioner further found Bartley was not\r\n  disabled as a result of the injury because she began work with Richland One in\r\n  August 2003, and thus, was not entitled to temporary total disability.Â \r\n  Additionally, the commissioner determined she â€œfailed to carry the burden of\r\n  proof by competent medical evidence that she suffered an injury to any body\r\n  part other than her neck or that her psychological condition has worsened as a\r\n  result of this injury.â€Â  The commissioner also found Bartley did not file\r\n  claims for benefits for the buttocks, low back, right leg, dizziness, ringing\r\n  in the ears, or psychological disorder within two years of the date of injury,\r\n  and thus, those claims were barred by the statute of limitations.\r\nBartley appealed to the Appellate Panel arguing the\r\n  commissioner erred in ruling a substantial portion of her claims were barred by\r\n  the statute of limitations.Â  Bartley also asserted the commissioner\r\n  erred in failing to find her permanently and totally disabled or that she had\r\n  sustained a much greater degree of disability in failing to award\r\n  temporary-total benefits. Â She further contended the commissioner erred in failing\r\n  to award her additional medical benefits including past and future medical\r\n  expenses.Â  Following a hearing, the Appellate Panel affirmed the single\r\n  commissioner finding Bartley had suffered a thirty percent permanent loss of\r\n  her back from the incident but determined the claims for the buttocks, low\r\n  back, right leg, dizziness, ringing in the ears, and psychological disorders\r\n  were not barred by the statute of limitations.Â  However, the Appellate\r\n  Panel determined those problems were not caused by the Allendale incident.\r\nBartley appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed\r\n  the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision.Â  The circuit court found the Appellate\r\n  Panel properly considered Bartleyâ€™s pre-existing conditions and determined they\r\n  were not caused or aggravated by the Allendale incident.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions\r\n  by the Appellate Panel.Â  See Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130,\r\n  134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  This court may not substitute\r\n  its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence\r\n  on questions of fact, but may reverse when the decision is affected by an error\r\n  of law.Â  Stone v. Traylor Bros., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552\r\n(Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe\r\n  substantial evidence rule governs the standard of review in workersâ€™\r\n  compensation decisions.Â  Frame v. Resort Servs. Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 527, 593\r\n  S.E.2d 491, 494 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The Appellate Panelâ€™s\r\n  decision must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C. 435, 440, 622 S.E.2d 569, 571 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  An appellate court can reverse or modify the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s decision only if the decision is affected by an error of law\r\n  or is â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial\r\n  evidence on the whole record.â€Â  Liberty\r\nMut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 363 S.C. 612, 619, 611 S.E.2d 297, 300 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\r\n  â€œSubstantial\r\n    evidenceâ€ is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly\r\n    from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a\r\n    whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the\r\n    administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its\r\n    action.\r\n\r\nLark,\r\n276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306.\r\nâ€œ[T]he possibility of drawing two\r\n  inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\r\n  agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Palmetto\r\n    Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d\r\n  695, 696 (1984).Â  In workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the\r\n  ultimate finder of fact.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535\r\n  S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000Â  When the evidence is\r\n  conflicting over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate Panel are\r\n  conclusive.Â  Hargrove v. Titan\r\n    Textile Co.,360 S.C. 276,\r\n  290, 599 S.E.2d 604, 611 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The\r\n  final determination of witness credibility and weight of the\r\n  evidence is reserved for the Appellate Panel.Â  Bass\r\n    v. Kenco Group,366 S.C. 450,\r\n458, 622 S.E.2d 577, 581 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBartley\r\n  argues the single commissioner, Appellate Panel, and circuit court all erred in\r\n  failing to consider the combined effects of a workplace injury and preexisting\r\n  physical and/or emotional and mental problems.Â  Specifically, Bartley maintains\r\n  the Appellate Panel erred in relying on this courtâ€™s decision in Ellison v.\r\n    Frigidaire Home Products, 360 S.C. 236, 600 S.E.2d 120 (Ct. App. 2004) (Ellison\r\n      I), which the supreme court reversed, 371 S.C. 159, 638 S.E.2d 664 (2006) (Ellison\r\n        II).Â  Further, Bartley contends because substantial, reliable, competent,\r\n  and probative evidence in the record as a whole supports that she is totally\r\n  disabled and her psychological and physical problems affect more than just her\r\n  back and hinder her employment, she must be awarded additional benefits.Â  We\r\ndisagree.\r\nFor an injury to be compensable, it must arise out of\r\n  and in the course of employment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160(A) (Supp. 2007). Â An\r\n  injury arises out of employment if a causal relationship between the conditions\r\n  under which the work is to be performed and the resulting injury is apparent to\r\n  the rational mind, upon consideration of all the\r\n  circumstances.Â  Rodney v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 515, 518, 466\r\n  S.E.2d 357, 358 (1996).Â  â€œThe claimant has the burden of proving facts that will\r\n  bring the injury within the workersâ€™ compensation law, and such award must not\r\n  be based on surmise, conjecture or speculation.â€Â  Clade v. Champion Labs., 330 S.C. 8, 11, 496\r\n  S.E.2d 856, 857 (1998).\r\nUnder section 42-9-10 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2007), a claimant has three ways to obtain total disability.Â  First, a\r\n  claimant can be presumptively disabled.Â Â  \r\n\r\n  The list of injuries included in the presumptive total\r\n    disability category include: â€œ[t]he loss of both hands, arms, feet, legs, or\r\n    vision in both eyes, or any two thereof, constitutes total and permanent\r\n    disability to be compensated according to the provisions of this sectionâ€ or\r\n    that claimant â€œis a paraplegic, a quadriplegic, or who has suffered physical\r\n    brain damage. . . .â€\r\n\r\nWigfall\r\n  v. Tideland Utils., Inc., 354 S.C. 100, 105 n.4, 580 S.E.2d 100, 102 n.4 (2003)\r\n  (quoting Â§ 42-9-10) (alteration and omission by court).Â  For these\r\n  injuries, a claimant need not show a loss of earning capacity because the loss\r\n  is conclusively presumed.Â  Id. at 105, 580 S.E.2d at 102.Â  Second, a\r\n  claimant can show an injury that is not a scheduled injury under section\r\n  42-9-30 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) â€œcaused sufficient loss of\r\n  earning capacity to render him totally disabled.â€Â  Wigfall, 354\r\n  S.C. at 105, 580 S.E.2d at 102.Â  â€œThird, a claimant may establish total\r\n  disability through multiple physical injuries.â€Â  Id. at 106, 580 S.E.2d\r\n  at 103.\r\nWhen a mental injury is induced by physical injury, unlike\r\n  a purely mental injury, it is not necessary that it result from unusual or\r\n  extraordinary conditions of employment.Â  Bass v. Kenco Group, 366 S.C. 450, 464-65,\r\n  622 S.E.2d 577, 584 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Additionally, â€œ[a]ggravation of pre-existing\r\n  psychiatric problems is compensable if that aggravation is caused by a\r\n  work-related physical injury.â€ Â Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 493, 541\r\n  S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001).Â  Pre-existing\r\n  depression does not preclude workersâ€™ compensation benefits for a mental\r\n  injury. Â See Doe v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Disabilities &amp; Special Needs,&nbsp;377\r\n  S.C. 346, 351, 660 S.E.2d 260, 263&nbsp;(2008).Â  However, the right of\r\n  a claimant to compensation for aggravation of a pre-existing condition arises\r\n  only when the claimant has a dormant condition that has produced no disability\r\n  but becomes disabling because of the aggravating injury. Â Anderson, 343\r\n  S.C. at 493, 541 S.E.2d at 528.\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    language of [section] 42-9-400(a) and (d) indicates the legislature clearly\r\n    envisioned that a claimant may recover for greater disability than that\r\n    incurred from a single injury to a particular body part if the combination with\r\n    any pre-existing condition hinders reemployment. Â There is no requirement that\r\n    the pre-existing condition aggravated the injury, or that the injury aggravated\r\n    the pre-existing condition, so long as there is a greater disability simply\r\n    from the â€œcombined effectsâ€ of the injury and the pre-existing condition.FN4\r\n  FN4. In fact, the statute provides for the aggravation\r\n    of a pre-existing condition as an alternative to the combined effects\r\n    provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ellison II,&nbsp;371 S.C. at 164, 638 S.E.2d at 666. Â â€œ[A]n injured claimant is entitled to compensation and\r\n  medical benefits for disability arising from a permanent physical impairment in\r\n  combination with a pre-existing impairment if the combined effect results in a\r\n  substantially greater disability.â€ Â Curiel v. Envtl. Mgmt. Servs. (MS),\r\n  376 S.C. 23, 31, 655 S.E.2d 482, 486&nbsp;(2007) (citing Ellison v.\r\n    Frigidaire Home Prods., 371 S.C. 159, 638 S.E.2d 664 (2006)).\r\nSouth\r\n  Carolina has adopted the â€œlast injurious exposure rule,â€ which \r\n\r\n  places\r\n    full liability upon the carrier covering\r\n    the risk at the time of the most recent injury that bears a causal relation to\r\n    the disability. Â Consistent with the rule that an employer takes its employee\r\n    as it finds her, the last injurious exposure rule makes the insurer at risk at\r\n    the time of the second injury liable even if the second injury would have been\r\n    much less severe in the absence of the prior condition and even if the prior\r\n    injury significantly contributed to the final condition. Â However, if the\r\n    second injury is merely a recurrence of the first injury, then the insurer on\r\n    the risk at the time of the original injury remains liable for the second.\r\n\r\nGeathers v. 3V, Inc., 371 S.C. 570, 577-78, 641 S.E.2d 29, 33&nbsp;(2007)\r\n  (quotations and citations omitted).\r\nIn Gordon v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours and Co., 228 S.C. 67, 76, 88 S.E.2d 844, 848 (1955) (citations omitted), the\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court held when\r\n\r\n  a latent or quiescent weakened, but not disabling,\r\n    condition resulting from disease is by accidental injury in the course and\r\n    scope of employment aggravated or accelerated or activated, with resulting\r\n    disability, such disability is compensable. Â The same principle is equally\r\n    applicable whe[n] the latent, but not disabling, condition has resulted from a\r\n    prior accidental injury. Â If the disability is proximately caused by the\r\n    subsequent accidental injury,\r\n    compensability is referable to that, and not the earlier one.\r\n\r\nIn Geathers, 371 S.C. at 580, 641 S.E.2d at 34, the supreme court applied Gordon because â€œ(1) Claimant suffered a non-disabling back injury during\r\n  a workplace accident; (2) Claimantâ€™s disability was caused by the second accident;\r\n  and (3) the second injury â€˜aggravated or accelerated or activatedâ€™ the\r\n  pre-existing condition.â€Â  The court further held the Gordon rule â€œreflects the essence of the last\r\n  injurious exposure rule[,] which is to hold the insurer on the risk at the time\r\n  of the second injury solely liable when the second injury aggravates the first\r\n  injury.â€Â  Id.\r\nExpert medical testimony is designed to aid the\r\n  Appellate Panel in coming to the correct conclusion; therefore, the Appellate\r\n  Panel determines the weight and credit to be given to the expert testimony.Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr. of Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 340, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999).Â  Â Â â€œOnce admitted, expert testimony is to be considered just\r\n  like any other testimony.â€ Â Id.Â  Accordingly, in deciding whether\r\n  substantial evidence supports a finding of causation, we consider both the lay\r\n  and expert evidence.Â  Id. at 341, 513 S.E.2d at 847. Â While medical\r\n  testimony is entitled to great respect, it should not be held conclusive\r\n  irrespective of other evidence and the fact finder may disregard it if the record\r\n  includes other competent evidence.Â  Id. at 340, 513\r\n  S.E.2d at 846.Â  \r\n The record contains\r\n  substantial evidence supporting the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding Bartleyâ€™s\r\n  injuries for the buttocks, low back, right leg, dizziness, ringing in the ears,\r\n  and psychological disorder were not caused by the Allendale incident.Â  Bartley\r\n  was doing well and returned to work after the surgery for her injury from the\r\n  Allendale accident.Â  Dr. Strohmeyer indicated the symptoms for which she is\r\n  seeking to recover were likely related to the Richland incident or her unrelated\r\n  lower back problem.Â  Even Bartley testified she was no longer experiencing\r\n  problems until she lifted some books at Richland One.Â  Additionally, Bartley\r\n  underwent lumbar fusion surgery, ankle surgery, and a hysterectomy that were\r\n  all unrelated to the Allendale incident.Â  Further, Bartley has a long history\r\n  of suffering from depression and migraine headaches.\r\nAlthough\r\n  Bartley presented some evidence the Allendale incident aggravated Bartleyâ€™s\r\n  pre-existing conditions, the record also contains substantial evidence the\r\n  Allendale incident did not cause or aggravate her conditions.Â  Substantial\r\n  evidence may support finding either the Richland incident aggravated her\r\n  pre-existing conditions or that her pre-existing conditions were not aggravated\r\n  at all because she was experiencing the same problems before the accident.Â \r\n  Accordingly, Ellison II does not apply.Â  The Appellate Panel is the\r\n  ultimate fact finder and when the facts conflict, as they do here, its findings\r\n  are conclusive.Â  The record contains substantial evidence supporting the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s decision.Â  Therefore, the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON\r\nand WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Bartleyâ€™s son\r\n  accompanied her to oral arguments. Â Judge Williams believed he recognized the\r\n  young man, who identified himself as a member of the South Carolina Judicial\r\n  Departmentâ€™s information technology unit. Neither counsel for the case sub\r\n    judice objected to this panel hearing the matter. \r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4477","title":"Ex Parte: Mamie L.

Franklin, South Carolina\r\n          Commission on Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Peter M. Balthazor, Office of the City Attorney, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Mamie\r\n  Jackson (Jackson) appeals the trial courtâ€™s decision to hold her in contempt\r\n  and her imprisonment sentence of ninety days.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe City of Columbia (the City) commenced an action against Jackson seeking injunctive relief.Â  Among the grounds for relief, the City sought to enjoin\r\n  Jackson from accumulating rubbish and debris on her property as prohibited by\r\n  the Cityâ€™s Code.Â  The trial court granted the Cityâ€™s request and enjoined Jackson from accumulating junk, clutter, and debris on her property.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  trial court granted the Cityâ€™s request to abate the conditions that constituted\r\n  a violation of the Cityâ€™s Property Maintenance Code.Â  Subsequently, the City removed\r\n  and disposed of the junk, clutter, and debris on Jacksonâ€™s property.Â  \r\nApproximately two months after this hearing, the City brought a\r\n  petition for rule to show cause as to why Jackson should not be held in\r\n  contempt for violating the trial courtâ€™s order prohibiting her from\r\n  accumulating junk, clutter, and debris on her property.Â  The City argued that\r\n  less than a week after it removed the items on Jacksonâ€™s property, Jackson brought additional clutter, debris, and junk back onto her property.Â  \r\nThe trial court held a hearing to determine if Jackson was in\r\n  contempt.Â  Jackson appeared pro se and argued she did not violate the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s order because she did not bring additional items onto the property but\r\n  rather moved the items from inside the house to outside the house for storage\r\n  purposes.Â  The trial court rejected this argument and found Jackson in contempt\r\n  and sentenced her to ninety days imprisonment.Â  This appeal follows.[1]Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nCourts have inherent power to punish for contemptuous conduct.Â  Miller\r\n  v. Miller, 375 S.C. 443, 453-54, 652 S.E.2d 754, 759-60 (Ct. App. 2007) (internal\r\n  citations omitted).Â Â Â  Courts are vested by their very creation with the power\r\n  to preserve order in judicial proceedings and to enforce judgments and orders.Â  Id.Â  Contempt results from the willful disobedience of a courtâ€™s\r\n  order.Â  Id.Â  A willful act is defined as one which is done voluntarily\r\n  and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or\r\n  with specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done.Â  Id.Â  \r\nInitially, we must determine whether the contempt involved in this\r\n  case was civil or criminal.Â  The determination of whether contempt is civil or\r\n  criminal hinges on the underlying purpose of the contempt ruling.Â  Id. at 456-57, 652 S.E.2d at 761.Â  If the primary purpose of contempt is to coerce a\r\n  party to do the thing required by the court for the benefit of the complainant,\r\n  then the contempt is considered civil.Â  Id.Â  However, if the principal\r\n  function of the contempt is to preserve the courtâ€™s authority and to punish a\r\n  party for disobedience of the courtâ€™s order, then it is criminal.Â  Id.Â  Punishment for civil contempt is remedial in that sanctions are conditioned on\r\n  compliance with the courtâ€™s order, whereas an unconditional penalty is\r\n  considered criminal contempt because it is solely and exclusively punitive in\r\n  nature.Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, the contempt imposed was criminal because the\r\n  function of the sanctions imposed was to punish Jackson for disobedience of the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s order.Â  Namely, the trial court sought to punish Jackson because she violated the order prohibiting her from accumulating junk, clutter, and\r\n  debris on her property.Â  Furthermore, the punishment imposed, the ninety days\r\n  imprisonment, was unconditional in that Jackson did not have an opportunity to\r\n  purge herself of the sanctions if she complied with the court order.Â  Thus, the\r\n  trial court viewed the sanctions as criminal rather than civil.Â  See id. (holding a sentence of imprisonment is considered punitive, and therefore\r\n  criminal contempt, if it is limited to a definite period). \r\nThe distinction between civil and criminal\r\n  contempt is crucial because criminal contempt triggers additional\r\n  constitutional safeguards.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution ensure that\r\n  an individual be afforded the right to assistance of counsel before he or she\r\n  can be validly convicted and punished by imprisonment.Â  State v. Thompson,\r\n  355 S.C. 255, 261-62, 584 S.E.2d 131, 134-35 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The right to counsel is by far the most pervasive, for it\r\n  affects a personâ€™s ability to assert any other rights he or she may have.Â  Id. The erroneous deprivation of this right constitutes per se reversible error.Â  Id.Â  \r\n It is,\r\n  however, possible to waive the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.Â  Id.Â  To effectuate a valid waiver of the right to counsel, the accused must (1) be advised\r\n  of the right to counsel and (2) be adequately warned of the dangers of self-representation.Â  State v. McLauren, 349 S.C. 488, 493-94, 563 S.E.2d 346, 348-49 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002) (â€œFaretta[2] requires that a defendant be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of\r\n  self-representation so that the record will establish he knows what he is doing\r\n  and his choice is made with eyes open.â€) (internal citations and quotations\r\n  omitted).Â  It is the trial courtâ€™s responsibility to determine whether there\r\n  was a knowing and intelligent wavier by the accused.Â  Thompson,\r\n  355 S.C. at 261-62, 584 S.E.2d at 134-35. A specific\r\n  inquiry by the trial court expressly addressing the disadvantages of appearing\r\n  pro se is preferred.Â  Id. at 262-63, 584 S.E.2d at 134-35. \r\nIf the trial court\r\n  fails to address the disadvantages of appearing pro se, this Court will examine\r\n  the record to determine whether the accused had sufficient background or was\r\n  apprised of his rights by some other source.Â  McLauren, 349 S.C. at 494,\r\n  563 S.E.2d at 349. Consequently, when determining whether the accused knowingly\r\n  and voluntarily waived his or her right to counsel the â€œultimate test is not\r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s advice but rather the defendantâ€™s understanding.â€Â  Thompson,\r\n  355 S.C. at 262-63, 584 S.E.2d at 135.\r\nThe following factors are to be considered in determining if the\r\n  accused had a sufficient background to understand the disadvantages of\r\n  self-representation:\r\n\r\n  (1) the accusedâ€™s age, educational\r\n    background, and physical and mental health;\r\n  (2) whether the accused was previously\r\n    involved in criminal trials;\r\n  (3) whether he knew of the nature of the\r\n    charge and of the possible penalties;\r\n  (4) whether he was represented by counsel\r\n    before trial or whether an attorney indicated to him the difficulty of\r\n    self-representation in his particular case;\r\n  (5) whether he was attempting to delay or\r\n    manipulate the proceedings;\r\n  (6) whether the court appointed stand-by\r\n    counsel;\r\n  (7) whether the accused knew he would be\r\n    required to comply with the rules of procedure at trial;\r\n  (8) whether he knew of legal challenges he\r\n    could raise in defense to the charges against him;\r\n  (9) whether the exchange between the\r\n    accused and the court consisted merely of pro forma answers to pro\r\n      forma questions; and\r\n  (10) whether the accusedâ€™s waiver resulted\r\n    from either coercion or mistreatment.\r\n\r\nMcLauren, 349 S.C. at 494, 563 S.E.2d at 349.\r\nIn the present case, the trial court conducted a hearing to determine if Jackson was in contempt.Â \r\n  Jackson appeared pro se at this hearing.Â  At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court sentenced Jackson to ninety days imprisonment. The\r\n  record is completely devoid of any statements by the trial court informing Jackson of her right to counsel.Â  Additionally, the record does not reveal the trial court\r\n  warned Jackson in any way as to the dangers of self-representation.Â  Moreover,\r\n  the trial court did not\r\n  determine, as required, that Jackson knowingly and intelligently waived the\r\n  right to counsel.Â  \r\nOur examination of the record does not reveal Jackson had a sufficient\r\n  background or was apprised of her constitutional right to counsel by another\r\n  source.Â  Consequently, the trial courtâ€™s decision to sentence Jackson to ninety days imprisonment was reversible\r\n  error.Â  Thompson, 355 S.C. at 262-63, 584 S.E.2d at 134-35. (holding the erroneous deprivation of the right to counsel\r\n  constitutes per se reversible error).[3]\r\nWe\r\n  note that this opinion is limited to the issue of constructive contempt.Â \r\n  Constructive contempt is contemptuous conduct occurring outside the presence of\r\n  the court, whereas direct contempt is defined as contemptuous conduct that\r\n  occurs in the presence of the court.Â  Miller, 375 S.C. at 455, 652\r\n  S.E.2d at 760.Â  In the present case, the contemptuous conduct was Jacksonâ€™s failure to comply with the\r\n  court order prohibiting her from accumulating junk, clutter, and debris on her\r\n  property.Â  This conduct occurred outside the presence of the court and is\r\n  therefore constructive contempt.[4]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nREVERSED.[5]\r\nPIEPER,\r\nand GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Jackson was released from custody pending the appeal and appointed\r\n  counsel.\r\n[2] Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975).\r\n[3] The City argues the issue of whether Jackson was entitled to counsel is not preserved for review because the trial court did not\r\n  address it.Â  We disagree.Â  â€œA notable exception to this general rule requiring\r\n  a contemporaneous objection is found when the record does not reveal a knowing\r\n  and intelligent wavier of the right to counsel.Â  The pro se defendant cannot be\r\n  expected to raise this issue without the aid of counsel.â€Â  State v.\r\n    Rocheville, 310 S.C. 20, 25, 425 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1993).Â  Thus, Jackson was not required to preserve this issue for our review. \r\n[4] Jackson raises other issues on appeal.Â  Due to the disposition\r\n  of the right to counsel issue, we need not address these issues.Â  Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (â€œAn\r\n  appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior\r\n  issue is dispositive.â€).Â  \r\n[5] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4478","title":"Turner v.

Turnerâ€™s health insurance had recently\r\n  expired after he left his prior employment at an accounting firm.Â  At the time\r\n  that Turner sought Millimanâ€™s services, Turner was employed at the familyâ€™s radiator\r\n  service business.Â  Â \r\nThe\r\n  Turners and Milliman discussed Turnerâ€™s health insurance options, specifically\r\n  the option to purchase group health insurance.Â  Milliman represented to Turner\r\n  that a group policy with CBA would be a good option because the future premiums\r\n  would not increase dramatically or as dramatically as the premiums with\r\n  individual insurance plans.Â  Turner also alleged that Milliman stated group\r\n  health insurance would be beneficial because of the following: (1) Turner was\r\n  at an age when he could start developing medical problems and this policy would\r\n  allow him to keep his coverage; (2) companies writing individual insurance\r\n  policies were going out of business and the prices of those policies were skyrocketing;\r\n  and (3) the only way people could afford insurance was to purchase group\r\n  insurance.Â  Turner further stated that Milliman told him CBA acted as a\r\n  watchdog over the insurance industry for the benefit of its members and would\r\n  notify its members when better group coverage was available.Â  \r\nBased on these alleged representations, Turner\r\n  completed an application for group health insurance through CBA.Â  This group\r\n  insurance coverage was issued by MidAmerica, which was concurrently assumed and\r\n  reinsured by Provident Indemnity.[2] Â Turnerâ€™s first premium payment in November 1996 was $122.70, which represented\r\n  his monthly health insurance premium as well as CBA membership dues.[3]Â \r\n  From the following month until May 1997, $101.70 was drafted from Turnerâ€™s account\r\n  for his monthly health insurance premium.Â  In June 1997, Turnerâ€™s premium\r\n  increased to $109.70 and did not increase for eleven months.Â  In June 1998, his\r\n  premium increased to $143.38, and in December 1998, his premium again increased\r\n  to $194.50. Â During the following two years, his premiums increased every six\r\n  months (June 1999, $230.90; December 1999, $271.95; June 2000, $331.81; and December\r\n  2000, $456.21). Â Turner stated he always anticipated the premiums would\r\n  increase, but by the end of 1999 into 2000, he thought the increases were becoming\r\n  unreasonable and â€œjust getting completely out of hand.â€ \r\nOn\r\n  April 30, 2001, CBA informed Turner that his monthly premium would increase to\r\n  $646.19 on June 1, 2001 due to increased research and development healthcare\r\n  costs.Â  Then, on May 31, 2001, CBA again notified Turner that his\r\n  premium would increase to $799.61 on July 1, 2001, because of â€œrising\r\n  healthcare costs as well as the substantial and continued losses sustained by\r\n  Provident American. . . .â€Â  Â Â \r\nIn June 2001, as a result of the continued increases\r\n  in Turnerâ€™s premiums, Turner submitted a complaint to the South Carolina Department\r\n  of Insurance.Â  The Department of Insurance wrote Provident American inquiring\r\n  about its premium rate increases.Â  In response to the Department of Insuranceâ€™s\r\n  letter, Provident American told the Department that Turnerâ€™s insurance contract\r\n  permitted the company to increase rates with thirty-one days advance written\r\n  notice and that â€œit had no alternative but to increase premium rates.â€Â \r\n  Provident American also represented to the Department of Insurance that â€œ[its]\r\n  members were accustomed to receiving biannual premium rate adjustments,â€ and\r\n  the May 31, 2001 increase â€œaffect[ed] all current . . . certificate holders.â€Â \r\n  Thereafter, the Department of Insurance notified Turner that he was insured\r\n  under a â€œgroup association policy,â€ and as such, those rates were not subject\r\n  to approval by the Department.Â  Â \r\nOn\r\n  June 22, 2001, Provident American notified Turner that it would unilaterally terminate\r\n  the CBA group association policy, but Turner could reinsure under another group\r\n  policy for the same initial premium with substantially fewer benefits.Â  Turner\r\n  testified that he attempted to find alternate health care coverage, but due to\r\n  the onset of diabetes, no insurance company would insure him.Â  Turner paid his\r\n  premiums until Provident American terminated his policy in September 2001, and he\r\n  has been without health insurance since this time.Â  Â Â \r\nOn December 19,\r\n  2003, the Turners initiated suit against Respondents for fraud, negligent\r\n  misrepresentation, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices\r\n  Act (â€œSCUTPAâ€).[4]Â \r\n  In essence, the Turners alleged that Milliman, as an agent of Respondents, made\r\n  several false representations that induced Turner to sign the insurance application\r\n  and purchase the group policy from CBA.Â  The Turners stated that because\r\n  of the excessive premium increases, they were unable to maintain the policy,\r\n  which ultimately caused them to suffer damages.Â  In turn, each Respondent\r\n  filed a motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations, a lack\r\n  of material evidence to support the Turnersâ€™ causes of action, and Charlene Turnerâ€™s\r\n  (Mrs. Turner) lack of standing as a real party in interest. Â Â \r\nThe\r\n  trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motions, finding the Turners â€œshould have been\r\n  on notice of their alleged injury beginning with the premium increases in\r\n  1998.â€Â  Because the Turners did not file suit until December 19, 2003, and\r\n  because they â€œshould have been on notice of their alleged claims before\r\n  December 20, 2000,â€ the trial court found their claims were barred by the\r\n  three-year statute of limitations.Â  The trial court additionally held\r\n  Millimanâ€™s representations to the Turners were matters of opinion or representations\r\n  as to future events, which were not actionable in fraud or negligent\r\n  misrepresentation cases.Â  The trial court further held that the Turnersâ€™ claim\r\n  for a violation of SCUTPA was unsupported as SCUTPA contains an explicit\r\n  exemption for insurance-related practices.[5]Â \r\n  Finally, the trial court found Mrs. Turner was not a real party in interest\r\n  because she was not a co-insured under the group coverage policy.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Turners filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, which the trial court denied.Â \r\n  Respondents also filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment, asserting additional sustaining grounds for the trial courtâ€™s grant\r\n  of summary judgment.Â  The trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion and\r\n  amended its order to find that Millimanâ€™s representations were not attributable\r\n  to MidAmerica or CBA because he was not an employee or agent of the respective\r\n  insurers.Â  Further, because MidAmerica had ceded all of its rights and\r\n  responsibilities to Provident Indemnity, any alleged misrepresentations by\r\n  Milliman were not attributable to MidAmerica. Â This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard\r\n  applied by the trial court.Â  David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C.\r\n  242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3&nbsp;(2006).Â  The trial court should grant summary\r\n  judgment â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and\r\n  admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to\r\n  a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Russell v. Wachovia\r\n    Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d 329, 334&nbsp;(2003).Â  In\r\n  determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\n  non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 434, 629\r\n  S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006).Â  â€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite\r\n  the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.â€ Â George\r\n    v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). Â Summary judgment\r\n  is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of the case is\r\n  desirable to clarify the application of the law. Â Englert,\r\n    Inc. v. LeafGuard USA, Inc., 377\r\n  S.C. 129, 134, 659 S.E.2d 496, 498 (2008).Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nThe\r\n  Turners raise four issues on appeal:\r\n(1) The trial court erred in\r\n  finding their claims were barred by the statute of limitations because\r\n  conflicting evidence was presented as to when the Turners knew or should have\r\n  known they had colorable claims against Respondents.\r\n(2) The trial court erred in\r\n  finding Millimanâ€™s representations to the Turners did not support an action for\r\n  fraud or negligent misrepresentation because the statements were made as part\r\n  of a general scheme to induce the Turners to purchase group health insurance.Â  \r\n(3) The trial court erred in\r\n  holding Millimanâ€™s statements were not attributable to MidAmerica or CBA\r\n  because Milliman held himself out as an insurance agent of MidAmerica and CBA.\r\n(4) The trial court erred in\r\n  holding Mrs. Turner lacked standing because the contracting parties intended\r\n  for her to be a third-party beneficiary of the insurance contract.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â  The Statute of\r\n  Limitations as a Bar to Recovery \r\nThe Turners argue\r\n  the trial court erred in granting Respondentsâ€™ motions for summary judgment based\r\n  on the statute of limitations. Â We agree.\r\nThe statute of limitations for a tort\r\n  action is three years. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) (Supp. 2007) (stating the statute of limitations for â€œan action\r\n  for assault, battery, or any injury to the person or rights of another, not\r\n  arising on contract and not enumerated by lawâ€ is three years). Â The\r\n  limitations period begins to run when the facts and circumstances of an injury\r\n  would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some claim\r\n  against another party might exist.Â  Burgess v. Am. Cancer Socâ€™y, South\r\n    Carolina Div., Inc., 300 S.C. 182, 186, 386 S.E.2d 798, 800 (Ct. App. 1989); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (Supp. 2007) (â€œ[A]ll actions\r\n  initiated under Section 15-3-530(5) must be commenced within three years after\r\n  the person knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known\r\n  that he had a cause of action.â€); Epstein v. Brown, 363 S.C. 372, 376, 610\r\n  S.E.2d 816, 818 (2005) (noting that under the discovery rule, the statute of\r\n  limitations begins to run from the date the injured party either knows or\r\n  should know, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a cause of action exists\r\n  for the wrongful conduct).Â  The standard\r\n  as to when the limitations period begins to run is objective rather than\r\n  subjective.Â  Burgess, 300 S.C. at 186, 386 S.E.2d at 800. Â Moreover,\r\n  â€œ[t]he statute is not delayed until the injured party seeks advice of counsel\r\n  or develops a full-blown theory of recovery; instead, reasonable diligence\r\n  requires a plaintiff to â€˜act with some promptness.â€™â€Â  Maher v. Tietex Corp.,\r\n  331 S.C. 371, 377, 500 S.E.2d 204, 207 (Ct. App. 1998) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  burden of establishing the bar of the statute of limitations rests upon the one\r\n  interposing it, and when the testimony is conflicting upon the question, it\r\n  becomes an issue for the jury to decide.Â  Brown v. Finger, 240 S.C. 102,\r\n  113, 124 S.E.2d 781, 786 (1962).Â  However, when there is no conflicting\r\n  evidence or only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence, the\r\n  determination of when a party knew or should have known that he or she had a\r\n  claim becomes a matter of law to be decided by the trial court.Â  See Arant\r\n    v. Kressler, 327 S.C. 225, 229, 489 S.E.2d 206, 208 (1997) (finding the trial\r\n  court properly denied amendment of pleadings against defendant doctor in\r\n  medical malpractice case and properly directed a verdict for the defendants when\r\n  no conflicting testimony was presented regarding time of discovery of\r\n  additional cause of action such that the notice issue was one for the trial\r\n  court to decide); Johnston v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 61, 65, 437 S.E.2d 45, 47\r\n  (1993) (finding grant of summary judgment in medical malpractice case was\r\n  proper based on statute of limitations because even taking the facts in the\r\n  light most favorable to the plaintiff, only one reasonable inference existed as\r\n  to when the plaintiff knew or should have known she had a claim).Â  \r\nThe trial court\r\n  found that the initial premium level in November 1996 was $101.80 per month,\r\n  which had almost doubled to $194.50 by October 1998 and had increased over 250%\r\n  to $266.95 by October 1999.Â  The trial court held that these increases\r\n  â€œstanding alone were sufficient to put [the Turners] on notice that Mr. Millimanâ€™s statements about premium increases were wrong and that [the Turners]\r\n  were being injured financially.â€Â  Because the premiums only continued to\r\n  increase, the trial court reasoned the Turners should have been on notice\r\n  beginning with the premium increases in 1998 but no later than the cutoff date\r\n  of December 19, 2000.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\n  the Turners, there is more than one reasonable inference as to when the Turners\r\n  knew or should have known they had a claim against Respondents.Â  Although the\r\n  dates and amounts of the premium increases are undisputed, we believe a genuine\r\n  issue of material fact exists as to when the Turners were on notice that\r\n  Millimanâ€™s prior representations were inconsistent with the premium increases.Â \r\n  The premiums increased significantly between 1998 and 2000, but the Turners\r\n  argue that it was not until May 30, 2001, when they received notification that the\r\n  premium would increase to $799.61, that they were on notice of a potential\r\n  claim.Â  While Turner conceded he expected the premiums to increase, he stated that\r\n  by the end of June 2001, he was aware the premium increases were unreasonable. Â Upon\r\n  receiving the last premium increase notification, the Turners promptly\r\n  investigated the premium increases by corresponding with the South Carolina Department\r\n  of Insurance in an attempt to ascertain why the premiums were increasing so\r\n  drastically.Â  Further, Mrs. Turner stated in a 2003 letter to the Delaware\r\n  Department of Insurance that â€œsoaring premiumsâ€ were not a concern until 2001.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  Respondents allege only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the\r\n  evidence, based on the varying amounts of the premium increases and the timing\r\n  of those premium increases, we believe reasonable minds could differ on this\r\n  issue.Â  See Byerly v. Connor, 307 S.C. 441, 445, 415 S.E.2d 796,\r\n  799 (1992) (stating summary judgment is appropriate when â€œplain, palpable, and\r\n  indisputable facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differâ€). Â The\r\n  determination of when the Turners knew or should have known of any potential\r\n  claims was consequently a jury issue.Â  See Santee Portland Cement Co.\r\n    v. Daniel Intâ€™l Corp., 299 S.C. 269, 274, 384 S.E.2d 693, 696 (1989); overruled\r\n      on other grounds by Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Natâ€™l\r\n        Vendors Div. Of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 462 S.E.2d 858 (1995)\r\n  (finding that when all of the evidence goes to the reasonableness of a partyâ€™s\r\n  actions, the statute of limitations issue becomes one for the jury to decide). Â As\r\n  such, the trial court improperly granted Respondentsâ€™ motions for summary\r\n  judgment based on the expiration of the statute of limitations. \r\nII. Millimanâ€™s Statements\r\n  as a Basis for Fraud or Negligent Misrepresentation Claims\r\nThe Turners\r\n  next contend that the trial court erred in finding Millimanâ€™s representations\r\n  to the Turners did not support an action for fraud or negligent\r\n  misrepresentation because the statements were made as part of a general scheme\r\n  to induce the Turners to purchase group health insurance.Â  We disagree. \r\nA plaintiff\r\n  asserting a claim for fraud in the inducement to enter into a contract must\r\n  establish by clear and convincing evidence the following:\r\n\r\n\t(1) a\r\n  representation, (2) its falsity, (3) its materiality, (4) knowledge of its\r\n  falsity or reckless disregard of its truth or falsity, (5) intent that the\r\n  representation be acted upon, (6) the plaintiffâ€™s ignorance of its falsity, (7)\r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s reliance on its truth, (8) the plaintiffâ€™s right to rely\r\n  thereon, and (9) the plaintiffâ€™s consequent and proximate injury. \r\n\r\nM.B. Kahn Constr. Co. v. South Carolina Natâ€™l Bank of Charleston, 275 S.C. 381, 384, 271 S.E.2d 414, 415 (1980).Â  Clear\r\n  and convincing evidence is the â€œdegree of proof which will produce in the mind\r\n  of the trier of facts a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be\r\n  established.â€ Â Peeler v. Spartan Radiocasting, Inc., 324 S.C. 261, 265\r\n  n.4, 478 S.E.2d 282, 284 n.4 (1996).Â  In such a case as this, fraud â€œmust be established by evidence which is clear, definite,\r\n  unequivocal, and satisfactory, or such, as has been said, as to lead to but one\r\n  conclusion, or as to leave no reasonable doubtâ€ as to the conclusion to be\r\n  drawn.Â  All v. Prillaman, 200\r\n  S.C. 279, 304, 20 S.E.2d 741, 750 (1942)\r\n  (specifying the standard of proof to establish a constructive trust as a result\r\n  of partyâ€™s fraudulent actions). \r\nA plaintiff\r\n  in a negligent misrepresentation action must establish by a preponderance of\r\n  the evidence the following:\r\n\r\n\t(1) the\r\n  defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff, (2) the defendant had a\r\n  pecuniary interest in making the statement, (3) the defendant owed a duty of\r\n  care to see that he communicated truthful information to the plaintiff, (4) the\r\n  defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise due care, (5) the plaintiff\r\n  justifiably relied on the representation, and (6) the plaintiff suffered a\r\n  pecuniary loss as the proximate result of his reliance on the representation. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nMcLaughlin v. Williams, 379 S.C. 451, 456, 665 S.E.2d 667, 670 (Ct. App. 2008).Â \r\n  A key difference between fraud and negligent misrepresentation is that fraud\r\n  requires the conveyance of a known falsity, while negligent misrepresentation\r\n  is predicated upon transmission of a negligently made false statement. Â See Gruber v. Santee Frozen Foods, Inc., 309 S.C. 13, 20, 419 S.E.2d 795,\r\n  799 (Ct. App. 1992). \r\nUnder\r\n  either cause of action, the failure to prove any one of the required elements\r\n  is fatal to the claim. Â Brown v. Stewart, 348 S.C. 33, 41, 557 S.E.2d\r\n  676, 680 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Generally, for a representation to be actionable, it\r\n  must relate to a present or pre-existing fact rather than a statement of future\r\n  events or an unfulfilled promise. Â Id. at 41-42, 557 S.E.2d at 680.Â  Further,\r\n  sales talk or â€œpuffingâ€ ordinarily is not sufficient to establish a claim for\r\n  negligent misrepresentation or fraud.Â  Jones v. Cooper, 234 S.C. 477, 487,\r\n  109 S.E.2d 5, 10 (1959); Satcher v. Berry, 299 S.C. 381, 383, 385 S.E.2d\r\n  41, 42 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  An exception to the general rule is recognized for\r\n  unfulfilled promises which were made by a party who never intended to fulfill\r\n  the promise and only made the promise to induce the performance of another\r\n  party.Â  Brown, 348 S.C. at 42, 557 S.E.2d at 680.Â  \r\nViewing the facts\r\n  in the light most favorable to the Turners, even if Milliman made the alleged\r\n  statements to the Turners, these representations are not actionable as a matter\r\n  of law as they cannot be construed as more than Millimanâ€™s opinion as to future\r\n  events.Â  Turner acknowledged that Millimanâ€™s statements about the policy being\r\n  the â€œbest group insurance product he had ever seen or offered for saleâ€ was\r\n  only Millimanâ€™s opinion.Â  Further, when questioned as to whether Turner thought\r\n  Milliman was lying to him when Milliman told Turner the premiums would not\r\n  drastically increase, Turner responded â€œnoâ€ and agreed that he thought Milliman\r\n  was giving Turner his honest and informed belief at that time.Â  With respect to\r\n  the remaining representations by Milliman, Turner acknowledged that these\r\n  statements related to future events.Â  Because mere unfulfilled promises or\r\n  statements as to future events are not actionable, and because no evidence was\r\n  presented to show Milliman made those statements only to induce the Turners\r\n  into procuring the policy, the trial court properly granted Respondentsâ€™\r\n  summary judgment motions on this ground.[6] Â See Woods v. State, 314 S.C. 501, 506, 431 S.E.2d 260, 263 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1993) (stating the failure to observe a promise may support an inference\r\n  of fraud or a lack of intent to perform only when the failure is coupled with\r\n  other evidence). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nEven\r\n  though we disagree with the trial courtâ€™s finding that the statute of\r\n  limitations expired as a matter of law, we nevertheless affirm its decision to\r\n  grant summary judgment based on the nature of Millimanâ€™s statements to the\r\n  Turners.Â  Because the Turnersâ€™ action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation\r\n  against Respondents hinges on Millimanâ€™s representations, which are not\r\n  actionable as a matter of law, the trial court properly granted summary\r\n  judgment in favor of Respondents.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s order is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED. \r\nWILLIAMS\r\n  and PIEPER, JJ., concur. Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondents argue Milliman is a general insurance\r\n  broker rather than an insurance agent.Â  For purposes of this appeal, we\r\n  generally refer to Milliman as an â€œinsurance agentâ€ but express no opinion as\r\n  to whether Milliman is an agent or broker, as reaching a conclusion in this\r\n  regard is not necessary for the disposition of this case.\r\n[2] CBA notified Turner in April 1997 that Turnerâ€™s\r\n  policy with MidAmerica would be terminated and assumed in May 1997 by Provident\r\n  American.Â  \r\n[3] To obtain group health insurance through CBA, Turner\r\n  had to join CBA as a member.Â  \r\n[4] S.C.

McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General\r\n  Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Harold W. Gowdy, III, of\r\n  Spartanburg, for Respondent.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Yahya Muquit\r\n  (Muquit) was tried and found guilty of (1) two counts of armed robbery, (2) \r\ntwo counts of possession of a firearm during a violent crime, and (3) two counts \r\nof pointing and presenting a firearm.&nbsp; He was sentenced to thirty-five \r\nyearsâ€™ imprisonment.&nbsp; Muquit appeals his\r\n    convictions and sentences, arguing the circuit court erred in admitting into\r\n    evidence clothing seized from his personal effects following his arrest.Â \r\n  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nOn\r\n  October 6, 2005, two men robbed Daleâ€™s Quick Stop, a Spartanburg convenience\r\n  store, at gunpoint.Â  A woman assisted the men by acting as a lookout. Â The participants\r\n  absconded with approximately $1300.00.Â  Shortly after the robbery, two men and\r\n  a woman accosted a satellite dish installer and, pointing a gun at him,\r\n  demanded the keys to his company vehicle.Â  The keys were in the ignition, and\r\n  the trio took the van.Â  Both victims called the police.Â  A short time later,\r\n  the trio abandoned the van and ran away on foot.Â  After a brief chase, police\r\n  officers apprehended Tunisha Jeter (Jeter), Hardy Lassiter (Lassiter), and\r\n  Muquit.Â  Jeter later testified on behalf of the State and pled guilty to\r\n  accessory after the fact of armed robbery.\r\nFollowing Muquitâ€™s arrest, officers obtained a search warrant.Â  The warrant indicated in\r\n  its description Muquit was the person to be searched and the clothes he was\r\n  wearing during the commission of the robbery were to be seized if found.Â \r\n  However, at the time the warrant was issued and executed, Muquit was in a\r\n  detention center wearing jail-issued clothing.Â  The clothing sought in the\r\n  warrant had been removed and stored in a separate location at the jail.Â  The\r\n  officers seized the stored clothing from the detention center to use as\r\n  evidence.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Muquit and Lassiter sought to suppress the clothing seized from their\r\n  personal effects while they were in jail.Â  The circuit court denied their\r\n  motion and allowed the clothing into evidence over objections from both\r\n  defendants.Â  The trial judge instructed:Â  \r\n\r\n\tIn any event, I donâ€™t have any question\r\n  that these search warrants are invalid . . . .Â  It described the person to be searched\r\n  and that person was not searched.Â  Items that have been seized were seized from\r\n  some other location that was not described in this warrant.Â  \r\n\tSo any search or any seizure of property\r\n  canâ€™t be predicated upon the validity of these warrants because these warrants\r\n  donâ€™t authorize anybody to search the location where the property was taken.Â \r\n  But itâ€™s my view that in this particular case under the facts of it the search\r\n  warrant was unnecessary, that the seizure was appropriate; and so I am going to\r\n  deny each of the defendantsâ€™ motions to suppress based upon the invalidity of\r\n  the search warrant, and they are.Â  But they werenâ€™t necessary, I donâ€™t believe,\r\n  in order for the seizure to take place.Â  \r\n\r\nBoth\r\n  Muquit and his co-defendant were convicted on all charges.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial\r\n  judge err by refusing to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless search\r\n  of property in the custody of the detention center where the owner of the\r\n  property was being incarcerated?\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court\r\n  sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388,\r\n  577 S.E.2d 498, 500&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id., 577 S.E.2d at\r\n  500-501.Â  This same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings\r\n  in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  Id.Â  Our review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is limited to\r\n  determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding.Â  State\r\n    v. Bowman, 366 S.C. 485, 501, 623 S.E.2d 378, 386&nbsp;(2005); see also State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48-49, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220&nbsp;(2006)\r\n  (â€œThe trial judgeâ€™s factual findings on whether evidence should be suppressed\r\n  due to a Fourth Amendment violation are reviewed for clear error.â€).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMuquit contends the circuit court erred\r\n  in admitting into evidence clothing seized from his personal effects following\r\n  his arrest.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAlthough there is no South Carolina case\r\n  law directly on point, the federal courts view the issue of seizing property\r\n  already in custody as well-settled.Â  Authority to search an arrestee derives\r\n  not only from the need to disarm him, but also from â€œthe need to preserve\r\n  evidence on his person for later use at trial.â€ Â U.S. v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 234 (1973) (citing Agnello v. U.S., 269 U.S. 20 (1925); Abel v. U.S.,\r\n  362 U.S. 217 (1960)).Â  When an arresteeâ€™s property is already in the custody of\r\n  law enforcement as an incident of the arrest, the police may seize it at a\r\n  later time as evidence relating to his offense.Â  U.S. v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 806-807 (1974) (citing Cooper v. California, 386 U.S. 58, 61-62 (1967)) (holding\r\n  seizure of arresteeâ€™s car impounded incidental to arrest was proper even though\r\n  it occurred a week after arrest).Â  In Edwards, the United States Supreme\r\n  Court enunciated:Â  \r\n\r\n\t[O]nce the accused is lawfully arrested\r\n  and is in custody, the effects in his possession at the place of detention that\r\n  were subject to search at the time and place of his arrest may lawfully be\r\n  searched and seized without a warrant even though a substantial period of time\r\n  has elapsed between the arrest and subsequent administrative processing, on the\r\n  one hand, and the taking of the property for use as evidence, on the other. This\r\n    is true where the clothing or effects are immediately seized upon arrival at\r\n    the jail, held under the defendant's name in the â€˜property roomâ€™ of the jail,\r\n    and at a later time searched and taken for use at the subsequent criminal trial. Â The result is the same where the property is\r\n  not physically taken from the defendant until sometime after his incarceration.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 807-808 (emphasis added) (footnotes\r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nMuquit argues the seizure of his\r\n  clothing was not incident to his arrest, relying on Chimel v. California,\r\n  395 U.S. 752, 764 (1969).Â  However, Chimel did not contemplate a search\r\n  or seizure of property already in the custody of law enforcement.Â  Instead, Chimel restricts arresting officers from conducting a warrantless search of an\r\n  arresteeâ€™s home, rather than the immediate area around him where he may have hidden\r\n  a weapon or evidence against him, for evidence of a crime.Â  Id. at 768.Â \r\n  Muquit further argues he had a â€œreasonable expectation of privacy in the\r\n  contents of [his] personal effects secured by the jail.â€Â  However, a personâ€™s\r\n  expectation of privacy is either greatly diminished or nonexistent when he is\r\n  arrested and transfers custody of his property to the State.Â  See Edwards,\r\n  415 U.S. at 806-807.Â  Indeed, once the police acquired custody of Muquitâ€™s\r\n  personal effects, they had authority to search or seize that property for use\r\n  as evidence in prosecuting the crime for which he was arrested.Â  Consequently,\r\n  the seizure of Muquitâ€™s clothing was proper, and the circuit court did not err\r\n  in admitting the clothing into evidence.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nOn\r\n  this novel issue, we hold that the seizure of an incarcerated defendantâ€™s\r\n  personal effects in his possession or the possession of the detention center or\r\n  jail where he is being held is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the\r\n  United States Constitution.Â  Accordingly, we \r\nAFFIRM.\r\nHUFF and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4480","title":"Moore v.

Â \r\nKevin\r\n  Hollerman, vice-president of sales for Textron, testified Fleet golf cars were\r\n  generally designed for golf course use.Â  Approximately seventy percent of\r\n  Textronâ€™s customers leased the new Fleet golf cars as opposed to purchasing\r\n  them.Â  He further testified that when the leased golf cars were returned to\r\n  Textron upon expiration of the lease, the golf cars were generally purchased by\r\n  distributors for sale to the public, primarily for uses other than on golf\r\n  courses. \r\nHollerman testified\r\n  he did not know if ownerâ€™s manuals were provided to distributors upon resale of\r\n  the golf cars as the cars were often picked up directly from the course by the\r\n  purchasing distributor.Â  Gerald Powell, a Textron employee, testified prior to the\r\n  1990s Fleet golf cars were affixed with a dashboard label stating:Â  â€œCAR IS\r\n  RESTRICTED TO TWO OCCUPANTS AND OPERATION ONLY ON A GOLF COURSE BY AUTHORIZED\r\n  PERSONS.â€Â  In the early 1990s Textron changed the dashboard label to read:Â  â€œFOR\r\n  GOLF COURSE AND NON-HIGHWAY USE ONLY, AND TO BE OPERATED ONLY BY AUTHORIZED\r\n  DRIVERS IN DESIGNATED AREAS.â€ \r\nThe evidence at\r\n  trial showed golf cars generally are not required under the law or any\r\n  recognized safety standards to be equipped with lights or reflectors, and the\r\n  operation of a golf car on a public road at night is prohibited by South\r\n  Carolina law.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-3-115 (2006).Â  Â Â Additionally, testimony was\r\n  presented that Textron offered after-market lighting kits that can be added to its\r\n  golf cars.Â  \r\nThe trial court\r\n  granted summary judgment in Textronâ€™s favor with respect to strict liability\r\n  and negligence.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate court â€œreviews the grant of a\r\n  summary judgment motion under the same standard as the trial court pursuant to\r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving\r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Sloan v. Depâ€™t of\r\n    Transp., 379 S.C. 160, 167, 666 S.E.2d 236, 239 (2008).Â  All evidence, and inferences\r\n  which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most\r\n  favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Zurcher v. Bilton, 379 S.C. 132, 135,\r\n  666 S.E.2d 224, 226 (2008).Â  â€œHowever, when plain, palpable, and indisputable\r\n  facts exist on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be\r\n  granted.â€Â  Rife v. Hitachi Constr. Mach. Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 214, 609\r\n  S.E.2d 565, 568 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Strict Liability[1]\r\nAppellants argue\r\n  the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Textron\r\n  because they presented evidence the used golf car was defective and\r\n  unreasonably dangerous as sold because Textron could foresee purchasers may\r\n  misuse the golf car.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn order\r\n  to establish a products liability claim, a plaintiff must show (1) injury by\r\n  the product; (2) the injury occurred because the product was in a defective\r\n  condition, unreasonably dangerous to the user; and (3) the product was in\r\n  essentially the same condition as when it left the hands of the defendant.Â  Rife\r\n    v. Hitachi Constr. Mach. Ltd., 363 S.C. 209, 215, 609 S.E.2d 565, 568 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 (2005) (â€œOne who\r\n  sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user\r\n  or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm caused\r\n  to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property . . . .â€).\r\nIn\r\n  this instance, Appellants do not argue the golf car was defective in that it\r\n  was not functioning as intended.Â  Rather Appellants contend the golf car was defective\r\n  and unreasonably dangerous to the user because Textron marketed the used Fleet\r\n  golf cars for operation on public roads without affixing lights and reflective\r\n  devices or without providing adequate warnings.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhile\r\n  the mandatory addition of lights and reflectors to golf cars would no doubt add\r\n  an increased element of safety, products are not defective simply because they\r\n  do not have all the optional safety features that could be included.Â  Our supreme\r\n  court has said: â€œMost any product can be made more safe. . . . [A] bicycle is\r\n  more safe if equipped with lights and a bell, but the fact that one is not so\r\n  equipped does not create the inference that the bicycle is defective and\r\n  unreasonably dangerous.â€Â  Marchant v. Mitchell Distrib. Co., 270 S.C.\r\n  29, 35-36, 240 S.E.2d 511, 513 (1977).Â  Likewise, the failure to equip the golf\r\n  cars with lights and reflective equipment does not create the inference the\r\n  golf car was defective and unreasonably dangerous.\r\nAppellants also\r\n  contend the golf car was defective and unreasonably dangerous because Textron\r\n  failed to provide adequate warnings regarding operation at night and on public\r\n  roads.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œA\r\n  product may be deemed defective, although faultlessly made, if it is\r\n  unreasonably dangerous to place the product in the hands of the user without a\r\n  suitable warning.â€Â  Anderson v. Green Bull, Inc., 322 S.C. 268, 273, 471\r\n  S.E.2d 708, 712 (Ct. App. 1996) (Cureton, J., concurring) (citing Marchant\r\n    v. Lorain Div. of Koehring, 272 S.C. 243, 247, 251 S.E.2d 189, 192\r\n  (1979)).Â  However, a product is not defective for failure to warn of an open\r\n  and obvious danger.Â  Id. (Cureton, J., concurring) (citing Dema v.\r\n    Shore Enters., 312 S.C. 528, 530, 435 S.E.2d 875, 876 (Ct. App. 1993)).Â  â€œ[A]\r\n  seller is not required to warn of dangers or potential dangers that are\r\n  generally known and recognized.Â  It follows, then, that a product cannot be\r\n  deemed either defective or unreasonably dangerous if a danger associated with\r\n  the product is one that the productâ€™s users generally recognize.â€Â  Id. at 271-72, 471 S.E.2d at 710 (citations omitted). \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion the operation of an unlighted golf car\r\n  on a public highway at night presents an open and obvious risk.Â  The risks associated\r\n  with this activity seem apparent, particularly in light of other dangers found\r\n  by our court to be well-known.Â  See id. at 271, 471 S.E.2d at 712\r\n  (Cureton, J., concurring) (&quot;It is common knowledge that an aluminum ladder\r\n  will conduct electricity.&quot;); Dema, 312 S.C. at 530-31, 435 S.E.2d at\r\n  876 (finding danger of operating recreational water vehicle in proximity to\r\n  swimmers was a matter of common sense precluding necessity of warning).Â \r\n  Furthermore, Appellantsâ€™ expert conceded the danger posed should have been\r\n  obvious.Â  Consequently, the golf car was not rendered unreasonably dangerous by\r\n  Textronâ€™s failure to warn against nighttime operation on public roads.Â  \r\nII. Negligence[2]\r\nIn\r\n  this case, Appellants claim Textron was negligent in failing to adequately warn\r\n  of the dangers of nighttime operation of the golf car on public roads.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nTo prove a negligence claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) a\r\n  duty of care owed by the defendant; (2) a breach of that duty by a negligent\r\n  act or omission; and (3) damage proximately resulting from the breach.Â  Platt\r\n    v. CSX Transp., Inc., 379 S.C. 249, 258, 665 S.E.2d 631, 635 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008). â€œThe court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law\r\n  recognizes a particular duty.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  previously discussed, there is no duty to warn of dangers that are open and\r\n  obvious.Â  Anderson, 322 S.C. at\r\n  271-72, 471 S.E.2d at 710.Â  Although\r\n  questions of negligence are often for the jury, when the risk complained of is\r\n  open and obvious to consumers, there is no duty to warn of that risk as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  See Miller v. City of Camden, 317 S.C. 28, 31,\r\n  451 S.E.2d 401, 403 (Ct. App. 1994) (stating negligence is mixed question of\r\n  law and fact with existence and scope of duty being questions of law and breach\r\n  of duty being a question for the jury).Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we believe Stroudâ€™s negligence in driving the golf car would prohibit a\r\n  recovery under a negligence theory as a matter of law.Â  See Haley ex\r\n    rel. Haley v. Brown, 370 S.C. 240, 244 n.6, 634 S.E.2d 62, 64 n.6 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006) (â€œAlthough we agree comparative negligence\r\n  normally presents a jury question, where, after consideration of all the\r\n  relevant factors, the only reasonable inference is that the plaintiffâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent, it becomes a matter of\r\n  law for the trial court.â€).Â  Therefore, we cannot conclude any genuine\r\n  issue of material fact exists warranting the denial of summary judgment in Textronâ€™s\r\n  favor. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we believe\r\n  the risk of operating an unlighted golf car at night on a public highway was\r\n  open and obvious, as a matter of law, the car was not defective or unreasonably\r\n  dangerous.Â  Furthermore, because the risk was open and obvious, Textron had no\r\n  duty to warn against the hazards of the conduct that lead to Stroudâ€™s\r\n  accident.Â  Therefore, the ruling of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  SHORT, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Issues I, II, IV, and V are all related to the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s conclusion Textron was entitled to judgment as a matter of law with\r\n  regard to Appellantsâ€™ strict liability claims.Â  \r\n[2] This section addresses Appellantsâ€™ Issue III.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4481","title":"Time Warner Cable v.

(REI), failed\r\n  to pay Time Warner monies owed under the partiesâ€™ contract.Â  The circuit court subsequently\r\n  ordered REI to allow Time Warner to continue providing services to REIâ€™s\r\n  customers for the remaining term of the contract and required Time Warner to credit\r\n  twenty percent of its revenues for video services during this time toward the\r\n  balance owed by REI on the juryâ€™s damages award.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in\r\n  part, and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn a contract\r\n  effective July 2, 2003, Time Warner agreed to provide video and other services through\r\n  REIâ€™s existing cable system to 784 condominium units in the Myrtle Beach area.Â \r\n  The contract provided for an initial term of seven years and an unlimited\r\n  number of five-year extension terms.Â  The contract required Time Warner to\r\n  upgrade and maintain REIâ€™s cable system at REIâ€™s expense and gave Time Warner\r\n  the exclusive right to provide â€œbulk multi-channel video servicesâ€ and\r\n  additional services[1] through that system.Â  REI agreed to market Time Warnerâ€™s basic cable services\r\n  to its customers and to bill its customers for basic cable service.Â  Upon\r\n  commencement of services, REI was obligated to pay Time Warner $11.50 per month\r\n  for each condo unit, regardless of whether the unit was occupied.Â  This amount\r\n  did not include charges for equipment rental or any taxes and fees, all of\r\n  which REI agreed to pay as well.Â  Time Warner reserved the right to raise the\r\n  $11.50-per-unit fee by no more than six percent annually upon written notice.[2]Â \r\n  Time Warner was to bill REI for its services in advance, and payment was due\r\n  within thirty days of the date of each invoice.Â  \r\nThe contract\r\n  defined instances of default and provided remedies.Â  Events constituting\r\n  default included:Â  (1) either partyâ€™s failure to perform any material\r\n  obligation and subsequent failure to cure the problem within thirty days\r\n  following notice thereof; (2) REIâ€™s failure to pay any of Time Warnerâ€™s\r\n  invoices timely more than two times during any twelve-month period; and (3)\r\n  either partyâ€™s insolvency or participation in a bankruptcy proceeding as a\r\n  debtor.Â  Under section 7.2 of the contract, each party reserved the right to\r\n  terminate the contract upon thirty daysâ€™ notice if breached by the other party,\r\n  as well as the right:\r\n\r\n\t[T]o\r\n  seek all remedies available at law or in equity with respect to a breach or\r\n  default under this Agreement by the other (including injunctive relief and\r\n  specific performance, in cases where such breach or default is causing or would\r\n  cause irreparable damage or where no adequate remedy at law is available), and\r\n  such rights and remedies shall be cumulative.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if REI\r\n  defaulted by failing to pay invoices, section 7.2 permitted Time Warner to â€œelect\r\n  to provide its package of multi-channel video services on an\r\n  individually-billed basis directly to Residents during the remaining Term.â€Â  \r\nIn 2004, Time\r\n  Warner filed suit against REI for failure to pay invoices, alleging breach of\r\n  contract and seeking an injunction permitting it to serve REIâ€™s customers\r\n  directly.Â  On January 11, 2006, Time Warner notified REI it was terminating the\r\n  contract effective March 15, 2006.Â  Following a hearing on March 14, 2006, the\r\n  circuit court entered an order enjoining Time Warner from terminating cable\r\n  service.Â  In that order, the circuit court specifically found â€œallowing Time\r\n  Warner to terminate the contract and discontinue cable service during the pendency of this action would result in irreparable harm to REI and to the\r\n  owners at the condominium complexes.â€Â  Time Warner continued providing cable\r\n  service pursuant to the circuit courtâ€™s preliminary injunction entered March\r\n  14, 2006.Â  \r\nIn April\r\n  2006, a jury found in favor of Time Warner and awarded it $140,542.21 in money\r\n  damages on the breach of contract claim.Â  Following the verdict, Time Warner\r\n  sought injunctive relief enforcing section 7.2 of the contract and permitting\r\n  it to use REIâ€™s cable system to continue delivering cable services to customers\r\n  in the condominiums.Â  On October 6, 2006, the circuit court granted this\r\n  relief, subject to certain limitations.Â  The circuit court reasoned that\r\n  permitting Time Warner to continue providing these services would minimize any\r\n  interruption to the customersâ€™ cable service.Â  The circuit court imposed\r\n  limitations on Time Warnerâ€™s continued use of REIâ€™s cable system, including:Â \r\n  (1) Time Warner must credit twenty percent of the revenues it received from\r\n  video services to reduce the amount of judgment against REI and make\r\n  semi-annual reports to the circuit court and REI concerning these reductions;\r\n  (2) Time Warner must initially fund any additional upgrades to the system, with\r\n  REI annually becoming responsible for a greater percentage of upgrade costs;\r\n  and (3) Time Warner must post and maintain for the duration of the order a bond\r\n  equal to twice the amount of the judgment to ensure its compliance with the\r\n  order.Â  The order was to expire upon REIâ€™s satisfaction of the judgment or on\r\n  July 2, 2010, the end of the contractâ€™s initial seven-year term.Â Â Â  \r\nOn December\r\n  12, 2006, the circuit court denied REIâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen legal and equitable causes of action are maintained in one\r\n  suit, the court is presented with a divided scope of review.â€Â  Blackmon v.\r\n    Weaver, 366 S.C. 245, 248, 621 S.E.2d 42, 43-44 (Ct.

Kassel, 369 S.C. 631, 638, 632 S.E.2d 888, 892 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  A decision to grant specific performance likewise rests in the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial court.Â  Campbell v. Carr, 361 S.C. 258, 263,\r\n  603 S.E.2d 625, 627 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Time\r\n  Warnerâ€™s Use of REIâ€™s Cable System\r\nREI asserts the circuit court abused its discretion in ordering\r\n  the takeover of REIâ€™s cable system as a means of paying off Time Warnerâ€™s money\r\n  judgment.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  discretion to grant or refuse specific performance is a judicial discretion to\r\n  be exercised in accordance with special rules of equity and with regard to the\r\n  facts and circumstances of each case.â€ Â Guignard v. Atkins, 282 S.C. 61,\r\n  66, 317 S.E.2d 137, 140 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  A court may order specific\r\n  performance if:Â  (1) a valid contract exists between the parties; (2) no\r\n  adequate remedy at law exists for the breach; (3) specific performance is\r\n  equitable between the parties; and (4) no fraud, accident, or mistake infects\r\n  the contract.Â  King v. Oxford, 282 S.C. 307, 314, 318 S.E.2d 125, 129\r\n  (Ct. App. 1984).Â  However, specific performance is not an absolute right, and a\r\n  court granting it must follow established principles and carefully consider all\r\n  the circumstances of the particular case.Â  Bishop v. Tolbert, 249 S.C.\r\n  289, 298, 153 S.E.2d 912, 917 (1967).Â  Generally,\r\n  a court will not order specific performance that would require â€œcontinuous\r\n  direction and supervision of the court,â€ but an exception to this rule exists\r\n  for cases in which the public has an interest.Â  81A C.J.S. Specific\r\n    Performance Â§ 65 (2004).Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we note this appeal arrives in an unusual procedural posture.Â  Time Warner\r\n  included both legal and equitable causes of action in its complaint.Â  When REI\r\n  demanded a jury trial, the breach of contract cause of action became a matter\r\n  for the jury to decide, but the cause of action for injunctive relief remained within\r\n  the province of the judge.Â  See Rules 38 &amp; 39, SCRCP.Â  Ordinarily,\r\n  the circuit court would have followed the jury trial of the legal action with a\r\n  bench trial of the equitable action.Â  See Airfare, Inc. v. Greenville\r\n    Airport Commâ€™n, 249 S.C. 265, 269, 153 S.E.2d 846, 848 (1967) (holding when\r\n  legal and equitable issues exist in the same case and jury trial is\r\n  appropriate, â€œ[t]he legal and equitable issues should be separated and each\r\n  tried by the appropriate branch of the courtâ€).Â  However, in this matter, no\r\n  bench trial followed the jury trial.Â  Rather, Time Warner presented its request\r\n  for injunctive relief in the form of a motion to enforce the remedies section\r\n  of the contract.Â  The parties filed memoranda supporting or opposing this\r\n  motion, and on June 6, 2006, the circuit court heard arguments.Â  REI did not\r\n  oppose Time Warnerâ€™s presentation of its request for relief in the context of a\r\n  motion hearing rather than a trial.Â  However, it may have prevented the parties\r\n  from fully developing evidence that would have assisted the circuit court in\r\n  fashioning an order that gave effect to the partiesâ€™ intent as expressed in\r\n  their contract and subsequent actions.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Specific\r\n  Performance Generally\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court did not err in granting specific performance[3] because it is an appropriate remedy under the circumstances present in this\r\n  case.Â  See King, 282 S.C. at 314, 318 S.E.2d at 129.Â  REI argues on appeal that no valid contract existed\r\n  because Time Warner terminated the contract by notice given in January of\r\n  2006.Â  However, REI effectively blocked this attempt at termination by\r\n  procuring a temporary injunction requiring â€œthe parties [to] continue to\r\n  operate under the July 2, 2003, contractâ€ during the pendency of the lawsuit.Â \r\n  The circuit court specifically found â€œthat allowing Time Warner to terminate\r\n  the contract . . . would result in irreparable harm to REI and to the owners at\r\n  the condominium complexes.â€Â  By the time the jury found REI defaulted, giving\r\n  Time Warner cause to terminate the contract, Time Warner had reconsidered its\r\n  decision to terminate.Â  It made no further effort to terminate the contract.Â \r\n  Instead, it continued providing services and pursued enforcement of the\r\n  contract.Â  Therefore, a valid contract existed at the time the circuit court\r\n  granted the injunctive relief.Â  \r\nREI further\r\n  argues the circuit courtâ€™s order is inequitable because it redirects income\r\n  that would have been REIâ€™s to Time Warner and leaves REI with nothing.Â \r\n  However, REIâ€™s argument focuses on inequities born of the limitations imposed\r\n  by the order rather than on any inequity that would result from specific\r\n  performance under the terms of the contract.Â  Aside from these arguments, REI\r\n  does not challenge the other criteria for specific performance, and we find\r\n  specific performance to be an appropriate remedy.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Use\r\n  of Specific Performance to Enforce Money Judgment\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court erred in ordering REIâ€™s compensation from its court-ordered\r\n  performance under section 7.2 of the contract to be applied wholly to the\r\n  satisfaction of Time Warnerâ€™s money judgment because Time Warner had an\r\n  adequate remedy at law for its losses under the portions of the contract it had\r\n  already performed.Â  A party is not entitled to specific performance of a\r\n  contractual provision if an adequate remedy exists at law.Â  Id.Â  Time\r\n  Warner sought and received an award of damages for the financial losses it\r\n  suffered due to REIâ€™s inadequate payments prior to trial.Â  These damages were\r\n  retrospective, making Time Warner whole in light of the losses it suffered in\r\n  the past.Â  In addition, Time Warner sought injunctive relief to ensure it would\r\n  not continue to lose revenue by allowing REI to act as a â€œmiddle manâ€ in\r\n  collecting revenues from customers.Â  This relief was prospective.Â  The two\r\n  types of relief are distinct from one another:Â  the damages authorized by law\r\n  assuage Time Warnerâ€™s past losses, and the injunction or specific performance demanded\r\n  by equity protects Time Warnerâ€™s anticipated future income under the contract.Â \r\n  Because Time Warner has adequate remedies at law for enforcing and collecting\r\n  its money judgment, the circuit courtâ€™s use of the injunction or specific\r\n  performance to satisfy this judgment was improper.Â  Consequently, requiring\r\n  REIâ€™s compensation for its specific performance to be diverted to Time Warner\r\n  in payment of the judgment was error, and we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  decision diverting REIâ€™s compensation to Time Warner.[4]Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Fair\r\n  Compensation\r\nREI asserts the circuit court abused its discretion in finding\r\n  twenty percent of Time Warnerâ€™s video revenues derived from the takeover of\r\n  REIâ€™s cable system would be fair compensation to REI.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n\r\n\tâ€œCommon\r\n  sense and good faith are the leading touchstones of construction of the\r\n  provisions of a contract; where one construction makes the provisions unusual\r\n  or extraordinary and another construction which is equally consistent with the\r\n  language employed, would make it reasonable, fair, and just, the latter\r\n  construction must prevail.â€ . . . \r\n\t. . . Our\r\n  cases have long held that ambiguities must be construed against the party who\r\n  prepared the contract. . . . [W]e hold â€œa party to a written contract, where\r\n  there is no ambiguity or indefiniteness in the essentials, cannot say their\r\n  minds did not meet.â€ . . .Â  â€œThere exists in every contract an implied covenant\r\n  of good faith and fair dealing.â€Â  \r\n\r\nParker v. Byrd, 309 S.C. 189, 193-94, 420 S.E.2d 850, 853 (1992)\r\n  (internal citations omitted).Â  Furthermore:Â  \r\n\r\n\t[N]either\r\n  law nor equity requires every term or condition to be set forth in a contract. Â Where\r\n  an implied term is necessary to effectuate the intention of the parties, the\r\n  law will supply it. Â The unexpressed provision may be inferred from the\r\n  language of the contract itself, or by looking to the external facts and\r\n  circumstances surrounding the bargain, or by proving a general custom and usage\r\n  of including certain terms as part of similar contracts. \r\n\r\nMaccaro v. Andrick Dev.\r\n  Corp., 280 S.C. 96, 100, 311 S.E.2d\r\n  91, 94 (Ct. App. 1984) (internal citations omitted).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court erred in ordering a compensation rate entirely unrelated to the\r\n  contract between Time Warner and REI.Â  At REIâ€™s request, the circuit court\r\n  prohibited Time Warner from terminating the contract during the litigation.Â \r\n  With the contract intact, Time Warner sought specific performance of section\r\n  7.2.Â  In granting Time Warnerâ€™s motion for enforcement of section 7.2 and\r\n  outlining the obligations of the parties, the circuit court undertook to\r\n  construe the terms of section 7.2.Â  However, the circuit court effectively\r\n  rewrote a material provision of the contract, the rate of REIâ€™s compensation,\r\n  using as its model limited evidence of an unrelated and unfinalized agreement\r\n  between Time Warner and another cable system owner.[5]Â \r\n  The twenty-percent rate has no basis in the terms of the agreement between\r\n  these parties and, standing alone, provides insufficient guidance to determine\r\n  a fair rate based on other agreements in the cable industry.Â  Consequently,\r\n  imposing this rate was error.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court received evidence of each partyâ€™s income from revenues collected,\r\n  as well as evidence of each partyâ€™s obligations under the contract.Â  Determination\r\n  of a fair monthly compensation rate should reflect the intent of the parties as\r\n  memorialized by the terms of the contract.Â  See Id.Â  A fair\r\n  monthly compensation rate should derive from the income to which the contract\r\n  entitled each party prior to enforcement of section 7.2, reduced or increased\r\n  by the actual costs shifted from one party to another by the order of\r\n  enforcement.Â  The parties must identify for the circuit court the particular\r\n  burdens and benefits reallocated between them by the order for specific\r\n  performance and must submit evidence of the actual monthly costs incurred by this\r\n  shift.[6]Â \r\n  Therefore, we reverse and remand to the circuit court for the taking of\r\n  evidence concerning the costs shifted between the parties by requiring specific\r\n  performance under the terms of section 7.2 and for entry of an order\r\n  establishing a fair rate of compensation for REI consistent with the terms of\r\n  the contract.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs to Time Warnerâ€™s use of REIâ€™s cable system, we find while\r\n  specific performance is an appropriate remedy for prospective relief under the\r\n  facts of this case, diverting REIâ€™s compensation for this performance to Time\r\n  Warner to satisfy its judgment was error.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order diverting REIâ€™s compensation to Time Warner.Â  \r\nAs to the amount of fair compensation for Time Warnerâ€™s use of\r\n  REIâ€™s cable system, we find twenty percent of Time Warnerâ€™s income from video\r\n  services is an arbitrary amount unrelated to the compensation rate set by the\r\n  parties in the original contract.Â  Consequently, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  order setting REIâ€™s compensation at twenty percent of Time Warnerâ€™s income from\r\n  video services and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\r\n  opinion.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the order of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] â€œâ€˜Additional Servicesâ€™ means any services other than\r\n  the Bulk Multi-Channel Video Services that can be provided to the [residential\r\n  condominium complexes] over the System (including . . . video services billed\r\n  individually to any Residents after the Initial Term and any Extension Terms).â€\r\n  Presumably, services such as digital telephone and high-speed internet would\r\n  also qualify as â€œAdditional Services.â€Â  Customers who purchased additional\r\n  services received a separate bill from Time Warner for those services.Â  REI did\r\n  not market, bill for, or receive any income from the additional services. Â Â \r\n[2] At the time of trial, this amount had increased to\r\n  $12.69 per unit per month.Â  \r\n[3] While the circuit court makes no reference to this\r\n  remedy as â€œspecific performance,â€ the parties have characterized it as that.Â \r\n  Specific performance â€œrequires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual\r\n  obligation.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1407 (7th ed. 1999).Â  In this matter, Time\r\n  Warner asked the circuit court to enforce an ambitious contractual provision\r\n  that supplied few specific terms.Â  The circuit court fashioned an order that\r\n  ultimately exceeded the intent of the provision.Â  In this section, we concern\r\n  ourselves only with the propriety of specific performance as a remedy.Â  We\r\n  address the limiting terms added by the circuit court below.Â  \r\n[4] This requirement was also error because it created an\r\n  inequitable situation between the parties, in contravention of the test\r\n  enunciated in King.Â  Diverting one hundred percent of REIâ€™s income to\r\n  satisfy Time Warnerâ€™s money judgment created a draconian judgment-enforcement\r\n  mechanism that left REI bereft even of a subsistence income from its cable\r\n  system.Â  \r\n[5] Time Warner identified â€œone commercial arrangementâ€\r\n  in which it utilized the other partyâ€™s cable system in exchange for a\r\n  twenty-percent share of video revenues.Â  Time Warner stated the terms of that\r\n  arrangement were under renegotiation at the time of suit.Â  Without further\r\n  inquiry, the circuit court found this agreement sufficiently comparable to use\r\n  as a model for its decision in this matter.Â Â Â  \r\n[6] For instance, both the provision of installation\r\n  services and converter boxes directly to customers and the cost of billing or\r\n  maintaining the cable system during the remaining term of the contract have\r\n  shifted from REI to Time Warner.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4482","title":"Serowski v.

Pursuant to the divorce decree, the\r\n  marital estate was divided equally and Husband was ordered to pay Wife\r\n  permanent periodic alimony in the amount of $1,750.00 per month, approximately\r\n  one-half of Husband's gross monthly income.\r\nOn July\r\n  10, 2003, Husband filed the instant action seeking modification of the prior\r\n  alimony award as well as attorney's fees and costs.Â  Wife filed an answer and\r\n  counterclaim seeking an increase in alimony in addition to attorney's fees and\r\n  costs.Â  \r\nAt the\r\n  time of the final hearing, Husband was sixty-six years old and Wife was\r\n  sixty-two.Â  Husband testified his current expenses totaled $5,184.04 per month,\r\n  marking an increase in expenses by $2,695.48 since the divorce. Â Wife's\r\n  testimony revealed her expenses totaled $1,888.85, indicating a decrease by\r\n  $636.15. Â Since the time of the divorce, Husband's income had increased by\r\n  $2,657.42 and Wife's income had increased by $929.50, as a result of her social\r\n  security and annuity benefits.Â  Additionally, Husband testified his assets totaled\r\n  $62,993.93; however, the court did not find this evidence credible.[1]Â  \r\nAs to\r\n  the parties' health, Husband presented evidence and testimony regarding various\r\n  health problems including congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease\r\n  which led to open heart surgery in September 2004.Â  Wife testified her health\r\n  was '&quot;so-so'&quot; and that she continues to suffer from a medical\r\n  condition which existed at the time of the divorce.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  the hearing, the court instructed Husband's counsel to prepare a proposed order\r\n  reducing Husband's alimony obligation from $1,750.00 to $1,000.00. Â Upon\r\n  receipt of the proposed order, Wife's counsel wrote the trial judge voicing\r\n  some disagreement regarding the findings in the proposed order and allegedly\r\n  further arguing Wife's position in the matter. Â Husband's counsel objected to\r\n  the court's consideration of the letter and shortly thereafter Wife's counsel\r\n  wrote another letter to the court allegedly further arguing the case.Â  Copies\r\n  of the letters were sent to Husband's counsel on both occasions.Â  After\r\n  receiving the letters, the court issued a written response to both parties\r\n  indicating the letters were inappropriate and would not be considered. Â Thereafter,\r\n  the court permitted Wife's counsel to submit a proposed order within fifteen\r\n  days. Â \r\nOn\r\n  September 20, 2006, the court issued its final order finding Husband failed to\r\n  prove a material or substantial change in circumstances warranting a\r\n  termination of alimony, but that evidence was presented to support a request for\r\n  a reduction in alimony. The order reduced Husband's alimony obligation to\r\n  $1,500.00 and denied both parties' requests for attorney's fees and costs. Husband\r\n  timely filed a motion to alter or amend, which the court denied.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from\r\n  the family court, this court has the authority to find facts in accordance with\r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Wooten v. Wooten,\r\n  364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005).Â  However, despite this broad scope\r\n  of review, we are not required to disregard the findings of the family court\r\n  judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, and was in a better position to\r\n  evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Id.Â  Questions concerning the modification of alimony rest within the sound\r\n  discretion of the family court and will not be overturned absent an abuse of\r\n  that discretion.Â  Riggs v. Riggs, 353 S.C. 230, 236, 578 S.E.2d 3, 6\r\n  (2003).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs if the court's ruling is controlled by\r\n  an error of law or if the ruling is based upon findings of fact that are\r\n  without evidentiary support.Â  Sharps v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 79, 535\r\n  S.E.2d 913, 917 (2000). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband argues the\r\n  court erred in failing to eliminate Husband's alimony obligation on the ground\r\n  Wife's increase in income and assets constitutes a substantial or material\r\n  change in circumstances sufficient to warrant a termination of alimony.Â  We\r\n  disagree. \r\n&quot;The\r\n  purpose of alimony is to provide the ex-spouse a substitute for the support\r\n  which was incident to the former marital relationship.&quot; Love v. Love,\r\n  367 S.C. 493, 497, 626 S.E.2d 56, 58 (Ct. App. 2006) (internal citation\r\n  omitted).Â  Pursuant to Section 20-3-170 of the South Carolina Code, changed conditions\r\n  may warrant a modification or termination of alimony.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-170 (1985).Â Â  This section specifically provides:\r\n\r\n\tWhenever\r\n  any husband or wife . . . has been required to make his or her spouse any\r\n  periodic payments of alimony and the circumstances of the parties or the\r\n  financial ability of the spouse making the periodic payments shall have changed\r\n  since the rendition of such judgment, either party may apply to the court which\r\n  rendered the judgment for an order and judgment decreasing or increasing the\r\n  amount of such alimony payments or terminating such payments . . . \r\n\r\nId. Â \r\nTo\r\n  justify modification or termination of an alimony award, the change in\r\n  circumstances must be substantial or material.Â  Thornton v. Thornton,\r\n  328 S.C. 96, 111, 492 S.E.2d 86, 94 (1997); Pendergast v. Pendergast,\r\n  354 S.C. 32, 38, 579 S.E.2d 530, 533 (Ct. App. 2003). Â Changes in circumstances\r\n  within the contemplation of the parties at the time the divorce was entered\r\n  generally do not provide a basis for modifying alimony.Â  Calvert v. Calvert,\r\n  287 S.C. 130, 139, 336 S.E.2d 884, 889 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  &quot;As a general\r\n  rule, a court hearing an application for a change in alimony should look not\r\n  only to see if the substantial change was contemplated by the parties, but most\r\n  importantly whether the amount of alimony in the original decree reflects the\r\n  expectation of that future occurrence.&quot; Â Sharps, 342 S.C. at 78,\r\n  535 S.E.2d at 917. Â As such, the party seeking modification has the burden to\r\n  show by a preponderance of the evidence that the unforeseen change has\r\n  occurred.Â  Kelley v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 486, 477 S.E.2d 727, 729 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1996). \r\nHere, Husband\r\n  asserts that Wife's increase in monthly income as a result of her receipt of social\r\n  security and annuity benefits constitutes a substantial change in circumstances\r\n  warranting termination of his alimony obligation.Â  In support of this assertion,\r\n  Husband cites Eubank v. Eubank, 347 S.C. 367, 555 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001), wherein this court found the family court erred in failing to consider the\r\n  wife's post-decree increase in assets in determining whether to grant a\r\n  reduction or termination of alimony.Â  While Eubank addresses a situation\r\n  in which the wife's increase in assets may have warranted a modification or\r\n  termination of alimony, the Eubank court's reversal of the denial of\r\n  modification or termination was based on the family court's failure to consider\r\n  the wife's changes in circumstances in addition to those of the husband.Â  Id. at 375, 555 S.E.2d at 417.Â  In contrast to Eubank, the instant case\r\n  neither involves a substantial increase in assets on the part of Wife nor a\r\n  decrease in income on the part of Husband.Â  In fact, Husband actually increased\r\n  his income. Â While Husband asserts his expenses have also increased, the family\r\n  court did not find Husband's testimony regarding his expenses credible.Â \r\n  Moreover, in accordance with Eubank, the court properly considered both\r\n  parties' economic circumstances in reaching its finding.Â  See Eubank,\r\n  347 S.C. at 375, 555 S.E.2d at 417.Â  Eubank merely suggests an abuse of\r\n  discretion where the court fails to consider the appropriate factors and\r\n  circumstances.Â  \r\nWe find the\r\n  court in the instant matter properly considered both parties' alleged changes\r\n  in circumstances in concluding that Husband had not proven a material or\r\n  substantial change in circumstances warranting a termination of alimony.Â \r\n  Additionally, the court found Husband's testimony as to his earning potential,\r\n  expenses, or assets was not credible.Â  In light of the relatively small\r\n  percentage increase in Wife's monthly income, review of the evidence supports\r\n  the court's finding that termination of alimony is not appropriate. Â Accordingly,\r\n  the court's denial of the request to terminate alimony was not an abuse of\r\n  discretion. \r\nIn the\r\n  alternative, Husband asserts the court erred in concluding he failed to prove a\r\n  change in circumstances warranting a greater reduction of his alimony\r\n  obligation.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs\r\n  stated, the change in circumstances must be substantial or material to justify\r\n  a modification of an alimony award.Â  Pendergast, 354 S.C. at 38, 579\r\n  S.E.2d at 533. Â In determining whether the change in circumstances warrants a\r\n  modification, several considerations relevant to the initial determination of\r\n  an alimony award may be applied in the modification context as well, including\r\n  the parties' standard of living during the marriage, each party's earning\r\n  capacity, and the supporting spouse's ability to continue to support the payee\r\n  spouse. Â Penny v. Green, 357 S.C. 583, 589, 594 S.E.2d 171, 174 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).Â  \r\nIn the\r\n  instant case, after carefully reviewing and contrasting the parties' income,\r\n  expenses, and assets at the time of the divorce and at the time of the hearing,\r\n  the court found Wife's increase in income due to her receipt of social security\r\n  and annuity benefits had improved her ability to meet her needs.Â  In addition, the\r\n  court noted that Wife's net worth had also increased since the parties' divorce.Â \r\n  As to Husband's asserted change in circumstances, the court recognized that Husband\r\n  had suffered serious medical problems.Â  However, with regard to Husband's\r\n  assertion that his medical problems have limited his earning capacity, the\r\n  court found Husband's testimony as to his earning capacity was not credible.Â  The\r\n  evidence in the record supports the court's findings.Â  Therefore, the court's reduction\r\n  in alimony from $1,750.00 to $1,500.00 was appropriate. Â Accordingly, the court\r\n  did not abuse its discretion in failing to award a greater reduction of alimony. \r\nNext, Husband\r\n  contends the court erred in modifying its decision in the final order.Â  Husband\r\n  further contends the court's modification was the result of improper ex parte\r\n  communications from Wife's counsel.Â  We disagree.\r\nUntil written\r\n  and entered, a court has discretion to modify or amend a ruling.Â  Ford v.\r\n    State Ethics Comm'n, 344 S.C. 642, 646, 545 S.E.2d 821, 823 (2001) (&quot;The\r\n  written order is the trial judge's final order and as such constitutes the\r\n  final judgment of the court.&quot;) (citing Rule 58, SCRCP).Â  Moreover, &quot;[i]t\r\n  is well settled that a judge is not bound by a prior oral ruling and may issue\r\n  a written order which is in conflict with the oral ruling.&quot;Â  Corbin v.\r\n    Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 621, 571 S.E.2d 92, 97 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Badeaux\r\n      v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 204, 522 S.E.2d 835, 839 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â Â Â  Here,\r\n  the court's initial memorandum to counsel was not the final written order of\r\n  the court.Â  As such, the court had broad discretion to change or amend its\r\n  decision in the final written order.Â  \r\nAs to\r\n  Husband's assertion that the court's modification was influenced by the\r\n  improper ex parte communications of Wife's counsel, this issue is without\r\n  merit.Â  Here, the trial judge, in denying Husband's motion to alter or amend,\r\n  specifically stated she did not consider the letters submitted by Wife's\r\n  counsel.Â  The trial judge further indicated that once it was discovered that\r\n  the letters served to further argue the case, she set them aside and notified\r\n  counsel that the communications were improper and would not be given\r\n  consideration.[2]Â \r\n  Additionally, in an attempt to prepare the final written order, the trial judge\r\n  decided to further review the evidence after concluding the findings contained\r\n  in the proposed orders from counsel were insufficient.Â  Consequently, the trial\r\n  judge evaluated the evidence in greater detail and determined that a decrease\r\n  in alimony of $250.00, as opposed to $750.00, was more appropriate.Â  Although the\r\n  original award in the memorandum was modified from $750.00 to $250.00, the\r\n  court's final determination was influenced by nothing more than the facts in\r\n  the record.Â  Accordingly, we find the court did not engage in improper ex parte\r\n  communications and the modification of the alimony award from the instruction\r\n  in the initial memorandum was well within the discretion of the court.Â Â Â  \r\nTurning to the\r\n  next issue on appeal, Husband asserts the court erred in focusing on the findings\r\n  of the original divorce decree regarding Husband's earning capacity and marital\r\n  fault.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe factors relevant\r\n  to the initial determination of an alimony award as set out in Section\r\n  20-3-130(c) of the South Carolina Code include, among numerous other factors, employment\r\n  history and earning potential as well as marital misconduct.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2008). Â Among the factors relevant to a determination of alimony,\r\n  earning capacity has also been considered in the modification context.Â  Kelley,\r\n  324 S.C. at 486, 477 S.E.2d at 729-30 (citing Boney v. Boney, 289 S.C.\r\n  596, 599, 347 S.E.2d 890, 892 (Ct. App. 1986)). \r\nWhile\r\n  earning capacity can be considered as a factor in an action for modification of\r\n  an alimony award, there is no evidence the court relied on this factor in\r\n  arriving at its determination to reduce Husband's alimony obligation.Â  Additionally,\r\n  there is no indication the court relied on the initial court's findings regarding\r\n  Husband's marital fault.Â  Review of the order reveals the court balanced the\r\n  relevant considerations in making its own findings relative to the parties'\r\n  changes in circumstances.Â  Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion\r\n  in focusing its findings on the parties' changes in circumstances.\r\nLastly, Husband\r\n  asserts the court abused its discretion in failing to award attorney's fees and\r\n  costs.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  determination whether to award attorney's fees is within the sound discretion\r\n  of the family court and will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Stevenson\r\n    v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).Â  In\r\n  determining whether to award attorney's fees, the court should consider the\r\n  parties' ability to pay their own fees, the beneficial results obtained by the\r\n  attorney, the parties' respective financial conditions, and the effect of the\r\n  fee on each party's standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471,\r\n  476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).\r\nHere, the court\r\n  properly considered the appropriate factors and concluded each party should be\r\n  responsible for their own attorney's fees and costs.Â  Although Husband\r\n  successfully received a reduction in alimony, Husband was primarily seeking to\r\n  terminate his alimony obligation based on Wife's alleged change in need.Â \r\n  Husband was not successful on the termination claim.Â  Moreover, Husband's\r\n  income is sufficient to enable him to satisfy his attorney's fees and costs.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error in the family court's denial of attorney's fees\r\n  to Husband.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased upon the\r\n  foregoing, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The court did not find Husband's testimony credible as to his earning\r\n  potential, expenses, and assets.Â  Specifically, the court found Husband was\r\n  transferring his assets to his current wife so as to improve his position for\r\n  either termination or reduction of his alimony obligation.Â  \r\n[2] We remind the Bar of Rule 9(b), South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Family Court, which states &quot;[c]ounsel shall not attempt to further argue\r\n  any matter after he has been heard and the ruling of the court has been\r\n  pronounced.&quot;\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4483","title":"Carpenter v.

Hills,Â  of Myrtle Beach, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Randall K. Mullins, of N. Myrtle Beach,\r\n          for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: Â This is an appeal of a divorce decree.Â  Karen Dallis\r\n  Carpenter, the wife, argues the family court erred in (1) failing to grant her\r\n  a divorce on the ground of physical cruelty, (2) finding that certain dental\r\n  and medical expenses she incurred after filing this action were not incurred\r\n  for marital purposes, (3) declining to order James Edward Burr, the husband, to\r\n  reimburse her for certain dental bills, (4) finding the home where the parties\r\n  lived before they separated had not been transmuted and declining to award her\r\n  a special equity in the asset, (5) denying her alimony, and (6) ordering her to\r\n  pay a substantial portion of Burrâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThe parties married\r\n  on December 13, 2002, in Horry County and last resided together as husband and\r\n  wife on March 27, 2004.Â  At the time of the merits hearing, Carpenter was\r\n  sixty-one and Burr was sixty-five.\r\nBefore the\r\n  marriage, Carpenter had worked as an associate professor of nursing and\r\n  education at Coastal Carolina University from 1978 until 1999, when she retired\r\n  for medical reasons.Â  Burr had also retired when the parties married, but\r\n  considered himself an investor.\r\nThe parties resided in a home in Tidewater Plantation,\r\n  North Myrtle Beach.Â  Burr had acquired the home in 2000, before the marriage.Â \r\n  The property was titled in Burrâ€™s name, along with the names of his nieces and\r\n  nephew, who are the remaining respondents in this case.Â  With Burrâ€™s approval,\r\n  Carpenter was included in the wind, hail, and home insurance policies on the home\r\n  and contributed toward payment of the premiums.Â Â  Carpenter was not listed on\r\n  the mortgage; however, she paid one-half of each mortgage payment on the home.\r\nAfter an\r\n  altercation on March 27, 2004, about sixteen months after they married, the\r\n  parties separated.Â  According to Carpenter, a disagreement arose between the\r\n  parties regarding the watering of their plants, whereupon a struggle ensued for\r\n  the garden hose.Â  Carpenter alleged Burr threw her on the ground, dropped on\r\n  her with his knees and stuck a garden hose in her mouth, requiring her to seek\r\n  emergency room treatment.Â  According to Carpenter, the incident also resulted\r\n  in the need for extensive dental work and caused intense pain in her spine,\r\n  which was determined at the emergency room to be spondylolisthesis.Â  Although\r\n  Burr denied he was the aggressor, he admitted on direct examination that he\r\n  later pled â€œno contestâ€ to an assault and battery charge arising from the\r\n  incident. \r\nCarpenter filed\r\n  this action on June 11, 2004, requesting (1) a divorce on the ground of\r\n  physical cruelty or in the alternative an order of separate maintenance and\r\n  support, (2) alimony and separate maintenance and support, (3) exclusive\r\n  possession of the Tidewater Plantation home and its contents, (4) exclusive\r\n  rights to the vehicle she was currently driving, (5) payment by Burr of\r\n  insurance and medical expenses for both parties, (6) a favorable division of\r\n  the marital assets, (7) litigation expenses and attorneyâ€™s fees, and (8)\r\n  various restraining orders.Â  Simultaneously, she filed a motion for temporary\r\n  relief.Â  A temporary hearing took place on June 29, and July 8, 2004.Â  On July\r\n  8, 2004, Carpenter amended her complaint to add Respondents Frank C. Gavay,\r\n  Cynthia A. Gesauldi, and Susan S. Fisher, relatives of Burr whose names\r\n  appeared on the title to the Tidewater Plantation home, as defendants only in\r\n  regard to the issue of equitable division.Â  She also amended her motion for\r\n  temporary relief.Â  Respondents Burr, Gavay, Gesauldi, and Fisher answered and\r\n  counterclaimed on August 4 and 5, 2004.Â  Carpenter replied to Respondentsâ€™\r\n  responsive pleadings on August 23, 2004.\r\nOn August 23, 2004,\r\n  the family court issued an order from the temporary hearing, granting Carpenter,\r\n  among other relief, exclusive use and occupancy of the Tidewater Plantation\r\n  home pending further order of the court.Â  Carpenter and Burr were each ordered\r\n  to pay one half of the monthly mortgage payments. \r\nOn June 17, 2005,\r\n  Burr amended his answer and counterclaim to seek a divorce on the ground of a\r\n  one-year separation.Â  Although Carpenter, in her reply, admitted the parties\r\n  had been separated for one year, she denied Burr was entitled to a divorce on\r\n  this ground.\r\nAnother temporary hearing took place on June 27,\r\n  2005.Â  On June 30, 2005, the family court issued an order from this hearing\r\n  denying Burrâ€™s motion to repossess the Tidewater Plantation home, denying\r\n  Carpenterâ€™s request to take the deposition of a marriage counselor but allowing\r\n  her to subpoena the witness for the final hearing, and granting mutual restraining\r\n  orders.\r\nThe final hearing\r\n  in the matter took place on September 12 and 13, 2005, and on December 5, 6,\r\n  and 8, 2005.Â  On January 4, 2006, the family court issued an interim temporary\r\n  order that, inter alia, ordered Carpenter to vacate the Tidewater\r\n  Plantation home and granted Burr temporary possession of the home.\r\nIn the final order\r\n  and decree of divorce, signed February 14, 2006, and filed February 21, 2006,\r\n  the family court, inter alia, (1) denied Carpenterâ€™s request for\r\n  a divorce on the ground of physical cruelty; (2) granted Burr a divorce based\r\n  on a one-year separation, (3) reserved Carpenterâ€™s claim for alimony for\r\n  further disposition based on a material change in circumstances; (4) denied\r\n  Carpenterâ€™s claim for transmutation of the Tidewater Plantation home and awarded\r\n  Respondents full possession and ownership of the asset; (5) divided the\r\n  personal property; (6) required the partiesâ€™ to be responsible for their own\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees and costs; (7) issued mutual restraining orders to Carpenter\r\n  and Burr; and (8) directed the parties to be responsible for debts in their\r\n  names without contribution from each other. \r\nBoth\r\n  sides moved to alter or amend, and on May 11, 2006, the family court issued an\r\n  order (1) denying Carpenterâ€™s motions for a new trial and for attorneyâ€™s fees, (2)\r\n  awarding Burr $15,000.00 in attorneyâ€™s fees, and (3) denying Burrâ€™s motion to\r\n  delete the reservation of alimony.Â  Carpenter timely filed a notice of appeal\r\non June 9, 2006.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the family court err in\r\n  failing to find physical cruelty against Burr?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the family court err in\r\n  failing to find Carpenter&rsquo;s spondylolisthesis and other injuries were caused by\r\n  Burr during the incident on March 27, 2004?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.\r\n    Did the family court err in\r\n  failing to order Burr to pay certain medical and dental expenses that Carpenter\r\n  incurred?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.\r\n    Should the family court have found\r\n  the Tidewater Plantation home had been transmuted into marital property or, in\r\n  the alternative, awarded Carpenter a special equity interest in the asset?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    V.\r\n    Did the family court err in\r\n  declining to award Carpenter alimony?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    VI.\r\n    Did the family court err in\r\n  ordering Carpenter to pay a substantial portion of Burr&rsquo;s attorney fees?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from the family court, an\r\n  appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C.\r\n  532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005) (citing Rutherford v. Rutherford,\r\n  307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992) and Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543,\r\n  466 S.E.2d 373 (Ct. App. 1996)).Â  â€œThis broad scope of review does not,\r\n  however, require the appellate court to disregard the findings of the family\r\n  court.â€Â  Id. (citing Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 279\r\n  S.E.2d 616 (1981)).Â  â€œNeither is the appellate court required to ignore the\r\n  fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.â€Â  Id. (citing Cherry Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280\r\n  S.E.2d 541 (1981)).Â  Moreover, â€œwhen an\r\n  appellate court chooses to find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  evidence, the court must state distinctly its findings of fact and the reason\r\n  for its decision.â€Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278,\r\n  283, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002) (interpreting Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Physical Cruelty\r\nCarpenter\r\n  alleges several errors in the family courtâ€™s finding that she failed to prove\r\n  her claim for physical cruelty against Burr.Â  First, Carpenter argues the court\r\n  mistakenly refused to consider Burrâ€™s admission during direct examination that\r\n  he pled â€œno contestâ€ to an assault and battery charge arising from the incident\r\n  that led to the partiesâ€™ separation as a conclusive finding that he had\r\n  committed physical cruelty.Â  Second, she maintains information regarding Burrâ€™s\r\n  visits with a counselor proffered through the counselorâ€™s testimony or\r\n  cross-examination of Burr should have been admitted.Â  Finally, she takes issue\r\n  with the finding that the altercation leading to the partiesâ€™ estrangement was\r\n  the only incident of alleged physical cruelty and criticizes the courtâ€™s\r\n  consideration of an incident in which she allegedly was the aggressor.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Burrâ€™s nolo contendere plea\r\nAcknowledging\r\n  a nolo contendere plea is generally not admissible during a civil\r\n  proceeding, Carpenter suggests Burrâ€™s voluntary acknowledgment of his nolo contendere plea was tantamount to an admission that he had committed\r\n  physical cruelty against her.Â  In support of this argument, she cites section\r\n  17-23-40 of the South Carolina Code, under which such a plea, once entered,\r\n  authorizes the court to deal with the defendant â€œin like manner as if he had\r\n  entered a plea of guilty thereto.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-23-40 (2003).Â  She\r\n  further references Rule 609 of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence, which\r\n  allows the admission of a nolo contendere plea â€œfor the purpose\r\n  of attacking the credibility of a witness.â€ Â Rule 609, SCRE. Â Â These\r\n  authorities, however, address the legal significance of a nolo plea for\r\n  purposes of the criminal proceeding during which it is made and the admissibility\r\n  of such a plea for impeachment purposes.Â  We further hold that, although Burrâ€™s\r\n  voluntary discussion about the plea during his direct testimony rendered it\r\n  admissible, the family court properly declined to consider it as dispositive\r\n  evidence that he had committed physical cruelty against Carpenter on March 27,\r\n  2004. Â Our supreme court has recently noted the nature of a nolo contendere plea, in contrast to that of a guilty plea or an Alford plea, prevents its\r\n  use â€œas substantive evidence of guilt in a subsequent proceeding.â€Â  Zurcher\r\n    v. Bilton, 379 S.C. 132, 136-37 n.2, 666 S.E.2d 224, 227 n.2 (2008).Â \r\n  Furthermore, proof of physical violence does not necessarily establish physical\r\n  cruelty as a ground for divorce.Â  See Brown v. Brown, 215 S.C.\r\n  502, 508, 56 S.E.2d 330, 333 (1949) (stating physical cruelty, for purposes of\r\n  divorce litigation, â€œas generally been defined by our courts as actual personal\r\n  violence, or such a course of physical treatment as endangers life, limb or\r\n  health, and renders cohabitation unsafeâ€).Â  Here, as noted by the family court,\r\n  there was evidence in the record suggesting (1) the injuries Carpenter\r\n  sustained during the altercation were less serious than she alleged; and (2) after\r\n  the parties separated, Carpenter voluntarily initiated contact with Burr, thus\r\n  making questionable her claim that she was â€œdeathly afraidâ€ of him.Â  Burrâ€™s\r\n  voluntary admission of his nolo contendere plea, then, was not a\r\n  concession on his part that Carpenter was entitled to a divorce on the ground\r\n  of physical cruelty.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Evidence concerning Burrâ€™s\r\n  statements and conduct during counseling sessions\r\nCarpenter\r\n  also contends the family court erred in refusing to admit the proffered\r\n  testimony of a licensed professional counselor that, in Burrâ€™s presence, she\r\n  had told the counselor that Burr â€œthrew her down and jumped on herâ€ and â€œshoved\r\n  a garden hose in her mouthâ€ and Burr never attempted to refute her statements. Â She\r\n  also alleges error in the courtâ€™s refusal to allow her attorney to cross-examine\r\n  Burr about his communications with the counselor. Â The family court held the prohibition\r\n  in section 19-11-95(D)(1) against the use of â€œconfidences revealedâ€ during the\r\n  course of treatment from a mental health provider as â€œevidence of grounds for\r\n  divorceâ€ applied to the evidence at issue.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  19-11-95(D)(1) (Supp. 2007).Â  Carpenter, however, argues any communications\r\n  between Burr and the counselor during sessions when the counselor met with both\r\n  parties were not â€œconfidencesâ€ because her presence prevented them from being\r\n  â€œprivate.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  40-75-190 of the South Carolina Code provides that â€œ[a]ll communications\r\n  between clients and their licensed professional counselor or marriage and family\r\n  therapist are considered privileged as provided in Section 19-11-95 . . . .â€Â  Id. Â§ 40-75-190 (2001).Â  Under section 19-11-95, â€œconfidenceâ€ is defined as â€œa\r\n  private communication between a patient and a provider or information given to\r\n  a provider in the patient-provider relationship.â€ Â Â Id. Â§ 19-11-95 (A)(3)\r\n  (Supp. 2007). \r\nTo\r\n  date, we have found no decisions from the courts of this State addressing the\r\n  question of whether the â€œprivateâ€ nature of communications from a patient to\r\n  his or her mental health treatment provider is compromised by the presence of a\r\n  co-participant in the treatment when the communications at issue are made. Â Our research of case law from other jurisdictions, however,\r\n  indicates that, at least where marriage counseling is concerned, it would\r\n  defeat the purpose of the treatment to hold the confidential relationship between\r\n  a patient and a counselor and the privileged nature of a confidences communicated\r\n  during the course of such a relationship are compromised by the presence of the\r\n  patientâ€™s spouse during the particular counseling session when the confidence\r\n  is revealed.Â  See Mrozinski v. Pogue, 423 S.E.2d 405, 408\r\n  (Ga. Ct. App. 1992) (noting that â€œ[t]he object of the privilege is to encourage\r\n  the full trust of the patient so as to persuade him to reveal his innermost\r\n  feelings and private actsâ€ and suggesting the privilege is â€œessentialâ€ because\r\n  â€œnowhere is the patient more reluctant to reveal his true feelings and thoughts\r\n  than in family therapyâ€); Touma v. Touma, 357 A.2d 25, 30 (N.J. Super. Ct.\r\n  1976) (â€œSince marriage counseling often brings the two spouses together for\r\n  therapy, the factÂ  that client and counselor are in the presence of a thirdâ€”here\r\n  the marital partnerâ€”does not waive the privilege.â€).Â  Â Moreover, our decision\r\n  to apply the patient-provider privilege to all communications made by a\r\n  marriage counseling participant during treatment, regardless of whether the\r\n  other spouse was in attendance, is consistent with this Stateâ€™s policy of\r\n  supporting the marriage relationship and encouraging reconciliation of married\r\n  couples.Â  Cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-90 (1976) (mandating that a divorce\r\n  decree state that an attempt was made to reconcile the parties to such an\r\n  action and that the efforts were unavailing); Grant v. Grant, 233 S.C. 433,\r\n  437, 105 S.E.2d 523, 525 (1958) (â€œIn a controversy relating to marriage the\r\n  Court is concerned not only with the rights of the individuals involved but\r\n  also with the public interest.â€);Â  Hickum v. Hickum, 320 S.C. 97, 107,\r\n  463 S.E.2d 321, 326 (Ct. App. 1995) (Goolsby, J., concurring) (noting decisions\r\n  of the court should â€œfurther this stateâ€™s public policy of preserving marriages\r\n  and encouraging reconciliationsâ€). \r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Evidence about other incidents of\r\nalleged physical cruelty\r\nFinally,\r\n  Carpenter contends the family court erred in apparently disregarding evidence\r\n  concerning other incidents, one occurring before the partiesâ€™ marriage and the\r\n  other after their separation.Â  Carpenter maintains these other incidents\r\n  discredit the family courtâ€™s finding that the altercation giving rise to the\r\n  partiesâ€™ estrangement was the only incident of alleged physical cruelty.Â  She\r\n  also complains about a reference in the appealed order to an incident in which\r\n  she allegedly was the aggressor.Â  In her brief, however, Carpenter cites no\r\n  case law or other authority to support her position that a family court must\r\n  consider allegations of abuse occurring before a marriage or after a separation\r\n  in determining whether a spouse has established physical cruelty as a ground\r\n  for divorce.Â  Furthermore, she does not explain why the family court erred in\r\n  finding she was the aggressor in another physical altercation during the\r\n  marriage.Â  We therefore hold these arguments are conclusory and decline to\r\n  address them further.Â  See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C.\r\n  361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (holding an issue will be deemed abandoned\r\nwhen the appellant fails to provide arguments or supporting authority).\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding Regarding Carpenterâ€™s\r\nSpondylolisthesis and Other Problems\r\nCarpenter\r\n  alleges error in the family courtâ€™s refusal to find that her spondylolisthesis\r\n  and injuries to her teeth were caused by Burr during the altercation that led\r\n  to the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  There is evidence in the\r\n  record, however, supporting the family courtâ€™s findings that Burr was not\r\n  responsible for the afflictions that Carpenter claimed she suffered at his\r\n  hand, including (1) Carpenterâ€™s admission, only after being confronted with the\r\n  findings of the administrative law judge in her social security case, that she\r\n  had become disabled from spondylolisthesis in 1999; (2) records from the\r\n  radiologist who examined Carpenter during the March 2004 incident indicating\r\n  the spondylolisthesis with which she\r\n  was diagnosed at the time was consistent with degenerative disc change; and (3)\r\n  Carpenterâ€™s acknowledgment that, before the incident leading to the partiesâ€™\r\n  separation, she fell numerous times and had engaged in physical activities that\r\n  could have aggravated her condition.Â  In\r\n  our view, the family courtâ€™s findings on this issue were contingent on the\r\n  credibility of the witnesses, a determination we believe was appropriately made\r\n  in this case by the presiding family court judge.Â  See Gambrell v.\r\n    Gambrell, 295 S.C. 457, 460, 369 S.E.2d 662, 663 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œAlthough we have jurisdiction in domestic matters to find\r\n  facts based on our own view of the preponderance of the evidence, we are not\r\n  required to disregard the findings of the trial judge, who saw and heard the\r\nwitnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their testimony.â€).Â  \r\nIII. Â Payment of Medical and Dental Expenses\r\nCarpenter\r\n  next contends the family court incorrectly determined it did not have\r\n  jurisdiction to award her certain medical and dental expenses, contending they\r\n  were valid marital debts.Â  We agree with Carpenter that, notwithstanding the limited\r\n  jurisdiction of the family court, it can make an equitable distribution award\r\n  or a special equity award that serves a comparable purpose to money damages if\r\n  the parties frame the issue appropriately.Â  See Peake v. Peake,\r\n  284 S.C. 591, 593, 327 S.E.2d 375, 376 (Ct. App. 1985) (noting the parties were\r\n  bound by their stipulations that the issue was reimbursement rather than\r\n  equitable division).Â  Nevertheless, because the family courtâ€™s finding that\r\n  Carpenter did not establish her entitlement to a divorce on the ground of\r\n  physical cruelty was supported by the evidence, we likewise uphold the courtâ€™s\r\n  refusal to order Burr to pay her medical and dental bills, regardless of\r\nwhether the court erred in stating it lacked jurisdiction to award damages.\r\n\r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marital Nature of the Tidewater Plantation Residence\r\nCarpenter\r\n  argues the Tidewater Plantation residence was transmuted into marital property\r\n  and should have been included in the marital estate.Â  In the alternative, she contends\r\n  the family court should have awarded her a special equity in the asset.Â  We\r\ndisagree.\r\nBurr\r\n  acquired the house more than one year before the parties married and had it\r\n  titled in his own name and the names of several members of his extended family.\r\n  Â Although Carpenter was listed on numerous insurance policies on the house and\r\n  paid a share of the premiums, we concur in the family courtâ€™s finding that this\r\n  participation was not sufficient to infer that Burr intended to treat the home\r\n  as marital property; rather, it reflected Burrâ€™s concern that Carpenter be\r\n  protected because her personal effects were in the home.Â  Furthermore, contrary\r\n  to Carpenterâ€™s contention that she was unaware that she was not on the deed\r\n  until after the partiesâ€™ separation, the record contains an exhibit indicating\r\n  otherwise.Â  We further believe that the short duration of the marriage, the\r\n  lack of evidence that the parties took out any joint loans to improve the\r\n  property, and fact that Carpenterâ€™s contributions to the equity in the property\r\nwere not significant support a finding that the home had not been transmuted.\r\nIn the alternative, Carpenter alleges error in the finding by the\r\n  family court that she failed to provide evidence that she acquired a special\r\n  equity in the property. Â In support of this argument, Carpenter notes she gave\r\n  Burr a large sum of money to â€œinvest,â€ which she claims was used in the\r\n  construction of the home.Â  She further points out that she paid one half of the\r\n  monthly mortgage payments.Â  The family court, however, found that (1) prior to\r\n  the marital litigation the investment account was â€œliquidated and [her] funds restored\r\n  to her in fullâ€; and (2) Carpenterâ€™s contributions to the mortgage payments\r\n  during the partiesâ€™ brief marriage did not result in a material reduction in\r\n  the mortgage balance principal.Â  Carpenter does not specifically challenge\r\n  these findings on appeal, and we hold they constitute adequate evidence\r\n  supporting the determination by the family court that Carpenter is not entitled\r\n  to a special equity in the Tidewater Plantation residence. \r\nV.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Alimony\r\nCarpenter\r\n  argues the refusal by the family court to award her alimony was error because\r\n  she will have ongoing medical expenses based on the injuries she allegedly\r\n  sustained from Burrâ€™s actions.Â  We disagree.Â  The family court gave adequate\r\n  consideration to the statutory criteria for alimony, in particular, the\r\n  partiesâ€™ incomes and nonmarital assets.Â  We also note that the appealed order\r\n  did not foreclose Carpenterâ€™s right to seek alimony in the future based on a\r\n  substantial change of circumstances.\r\nVI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nFinally,\r\n  Carpenter contests the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Burr; however, the only\r\n  argument she makes regarding this issue is that the fees were improper given\r\n  the family courtâ€™s findings on the other issues she has appealed.Â  Because we\r\n  have affirmed these other issues, we likewise uphold the attorneyâ€™s fees award.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm the family court order in its entirety.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and\r\nHUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4484","title":"Chastain v.

order of the family court awarding custody of her three\r\n  children to Tyson Chastain (Husband) and requiring her to pay $2,500 in private\r\n  investigator fees.Â  Wife alleges, inter alia, that the family court\r\n  judge erred in holding she engaged in flagrant promiscuity.Â  We disagree with\r\n  the family courtâ€™s holding as to flagrant promiscuity but affirm the underlying\r\n  action.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife\r\n  married on March 9, 1996.Â  They lived in Columbia until the birth of their\r\n  first child, Cassidy, on July 15, 1997.Â  After Cassidy was born, they moved to\r\n  Johnsonville where they lived with Husbandâ€™s parents for several months before\r\n  they began renting their own home.Â  Later that same year, Husband and Wife\r\n  separated, and Husband moved back in with his parents while Wife, along with\r\n  Cassidy, moved into a double-wide trailer in Lake City.Â  After four or five\r\n  months of separation, Husband and Wife resolved their marital differences, and\r\n  Husband moved into the trailer in Lake City with his wife and daughter.Â \r\n  However, when Cassidy became old enough to attend school, Husband and Cassidy\r\n  stayed at Husbandâ€™s parentsâ€™ home in Johnsonville during the week so Cassidy\r\n  could attend school in the Johnsonville School District.Â  During the remainder\r\n  of their marriage, Husband and Wife had two children:Â  Dawson, born December 3,\r\n  2001, and Elizabeth Grace, born December 8, 2003.Â  \r\nDuring the time\r\n  they lived in Columbia, Husband played professional golf and worked as an\r\n  assistant golf professional.Â  After moving to Johnsonville in 1997, Husband\r\n  continued working as an assistant golf pro in Florence.Â  However, Husband was\r\n  fired for stealing $5,000 from the golf club.[1]Â \r\n  After losing his job, Husband began working as the office manager for a\r\n  construction company, ASI.Â  When Husband began working for ASI, the company was\r\n  owned by Wifeâ€™s uncle.Â  While ASI was owned by Wifeâ€™s uncle, Husband was\r\n  required to work long hours and commute to the companyâ€™s office in Florence.Â  In 2003, Husbandâ€™s father purchased ASI and moved the companyâ€™s office to a\r\n  spare room located in his home in Johnsonville.Â  Currently, Husband works for\r\n  ASI out of his parentsâ€™ home and enjoys a very flexible work schedule.Â \r\n  Meanwhile, Wife has maintained employment as an administrative assistant at Nan\r\n  Ya Plastics since she moved to the Johnsonville area.Â  \r\nEarly in 2005,\r\n  Husband suspected Wife was having an extramarital affair, and he hired a\r\n  private investigator, Alan Capps, to confirm his suspicions.[2]Â \r\n  Capps reported Wife was having an affair with a co-worker, Steve Vargas.Â \r\n  Thereafter, Husband commenced a divorce action on the grounds of adultery.Â \r\n  However, the family court dismissed the action based on condonation, finding\r\n  Husband and Wife engaged in sexual relations before the hearing.Â  According to\r\n  Husband, Wife offered him little help with the children during this time and\r\n  spent her nights talking on the telephone and away from the house.Â  On July 13,\r\n  2005, Husband left the marital home and took the children to his parentsâ€™\r\n  house.Â  The parties have been separated since that time, and, on August 1,\r\n  Husband commenced this action for divorce, custody, child support, and separate\r\n  support and maintenance.Â  In October 2005, Wife began an extramarital affair\r\n  with another co-worker, Lee Dotson.[3]Â  \r\nWhile the parties\r\n  were separated, Wife brought Dotson to Cassidyâ€™s dance recital.Â  After the\r\n  dance recital, Wife, along with Dotson, approached Husband and asked where the\r\n  children were.Â  Husband, who had already sent the children home with his\r\n  brother, responded by telling Dotson to step outside and that he was going â€œto\r\n  beat his tail.â€ Â Wife and Leeâ€™s parents followed the men outside.Â  While\r\n  outside, Husbandâ€™s mother attempted to take a picture of Wife and Dotson\r\n  together.Â  Wife pushed Husbandâ€™s mother away from her to prevent her from\r\n  taking the picture.Â  In turn, Husband grabbed Wife by the arm.Â  A physical\r\n  altercation ensued between Husband and Dotson, ending with the arrest of\r\n  Husband, his mother, Wife, and Dotson.Â  All eventually pled guilty to\r\n  disorderly conduct and paid fines.Â  \r\nThis would not be\r\n  the last incident between Husband, Wife, and Dotson.Â  After Husband and Wife\r\n  had been separated for eight months, Husband began having sexual relations with\r\n  Dotsonâ€™s wife, Beth.[4]Â \r\n  One night, Dotson and Wife followed Husband and Beth from Ruby Tuesdayâ€™s to\r\n  Bethâ€™s house.Â  When they arrived at Bethâ€™s house, Dotson peered in the window\r\n  and observed Husband and Beth kissing.Â  After a few moments of deliberation\r\n  with Wife, Dotson threw a brick through the bedroom window.Â  Then, Dotson and\r\n  Wife kicked the door of the residence open.Â  While inside, Dotson and Wife took\r\n  pictures of Husband as he put his clothes on and of Beth with the bed-covers\r\n  pulled over her.Â  \r\nIn spite of Wifeâ€™s\r\n  on-going relationship with Dotson, she claims he has had no interaction with\r\n  her children.Â  She admits he stayed at her house one night while the children\r\n  were in her care.Â  However, Wife maintains the children were asleep and did not\r\n  see Dotson.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Guardian ad Litem, Phillip Atkinson, visited both parents and prepared a report\r\n  prior to the court hearing.Â  At Wifeâ€™s home, the guardian found an exposed\r\n  light socket.Â  Furthermore, he noted Wife placed her four-year-old, Dawson, in\r\n  the front seat without a booster seat.Â  Generally, the Guardian acknowledged\r\n  Wife experienced difficulty controlling the children during his visit.Â  By\r\n  contrast, the Guardian observed â€œcompletely different childrenâ€ when he visited\r\n  Husbandâ€™s house.Â  In Husbandâ€™s home, the Guardian found the children to be\r\n  â€œquiet, respectful, and loving.â€Â  In addition, the Guardian found Husband took\r\n  every safety precaution imaginable in his home.Â  \r\nThe family court\r\n  found Husband was not entitled to a divorce based on the fault grounds of\r\n  adultery because he engaged in a sexual relationship with Dotsonâ€™s wife before\r\n  the grant of a divorce.Â  The court, however, granted the parties a divorce on\r\n  the grounds of living separate and apart for one year.Â  The court awarded Husband\r\n  custody of all three children, finding Wife engaged in â€œflagrant promiscuity.â€Â \r\n  However, the family court found Wifeâ€™s extra-marital affairs did not negatively\r\n  affect the welfare of her children.Â  Finally, the court directed Wife to pay\r\n  $2,500 of Husbandâ€™s $2,700 private investigator bill, stating her adulterous\r\n  conduct forced Husband to incur these expenses.Â  Wife did not make any\r\n  post-trial motions and timely served her notice of appeal.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the\r\n  family court, this court has jurisdiction to correct errors of law and find\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Â Mr.\r\n    T v. Ms. T, 378 S.C. 127, 131-32, 662 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  Although\r\n  this court may find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence, we are not required to ignore the fact that the trial judge,\r\n  who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Marquez v.\r\n    Caudill, 376 S.C. 229, 239, 656 S.E.2d 737, 742 (2008).Â  In particular, an\r\n  appellate court â€œshould be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the\r\n  evidence on child custody for that\r\n  of the [family] court.â€Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d\r\n  154, 157 (1996).Â Â Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife argues the family court erred in finding she\r\n  engaged in flagrant promiscuity and in considering her adulterous conduct in\r\n  determining the best interests of the children.Â  Initially, Wife notes the\r\n  family court found her adulterous affairs did not affect her children.Â  In\r\n  light of this finding, the only way her adulterous affairs could have been\r\n  relevant in the best interest analysis was if the court found she engaged in\r\n  flagrant promiscuity.Â  Wife alleges her conduct was not analogous to the\r\n  conduct of the mother in Boykin v. Boykin, and therefore, the trial\r\n  court committed an error of law in finding her conduct rose to the level of\r\n  flagrant promiscuity.Â  296 S.C. 100, 370 S.E.2d 884 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  Unlike\r\n  the mother in Boykin, who engaged in five extra-marital affairs, Wife\r\n  was only involved in two extra-marital affairs, while her Husband was involved\r\n  in one.Â  Id. at 102, 370 S.E.2d at 886.Â  Furthermore, the mother in Boykin regularly partied with friends until the early morning hours.Â  Id.Â  Wife asserts her conduct did not rise to this level; therefore, the family\r\n  court erred when it found she engaged in flagrant promiscuity.Â Â Â Â  \r\nA parentâ€™s morality, while a proper consideration in\r\n  custody disputes, is limited in its force and effect to the relevance it has,\r\n  either directly or indirectly, on the welfare of the child.Â  Clear v. Clear,\r\n  331 S.C. 186, 190, 500 S.E.2d 790, 792 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing Davenport v.\r\n    Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975)).Â  Thus, conduct that\r\n  is immoral must also be shown to be detrimental to the welfare of a child\r\n  before it is of legal significance in a custody dispute.Â  Stroman v.\r\n    Williams, 291 S.C. 376, 379, 353 S.E.2d 704, 705 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  However,\r\n  flagrant promiscuity inevitably affects the welfare of the child and\r\n  establishes â€œa watershed in the courtâ€™s quest to protect the best interests of\r\n  a minor child.â€Â  Boykin, 296 S.C. at 102, 370 S.E.2d at 886.Â Â  \r\nWe believe the\r\n  family court erred in finding Wifeâ€™s conduct rose to the level of flagrant\r\n  promiscuity.Â  Flagrant promiscuity serves only as an exception to the general\r\n  rule, which requires immoral conduct to have a detrimental affect on the\r\n  welfare of the child in order to have legal significance.Â  Id.Â  Because\r\n  it only exists as an exception, we believe it is meant to be invoked\r\n  sparinglyâ€”to embrace that rare situation of glaringly bad and outrageous\r\n  conduct not present in these facts.Â  Here, Wife engaged in two extra-marital\r\n  affairs, while Husband engaged in one extra-marital affair.Â  In addition, Wife\r\n  essentially lives with her current boyfriend, Dotson, when her children are not\r\n  in her care.Â  Also, Wife brought Dotson to her daughterâ€™s dance recital, and a physical\r\n  altercation between Dotson and Husband ensued.Â  In our view, these facts do not\r\n  fall within the ambit of flagrant promiscuity.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the family court erred in finding Wifeâ€™s conduct rose to the level of flagrant\r\n  promiscuity.Â  Because the family court found Wifeâ€™s immoral conduct did not\r\n  detrimentally affect the welfare of her children and because her conduct does\r\n  not fall within the flagrant promiscuity exception, the family court also erred\r\n  in considering her adulterous conduct in the best interests of the child\r\n  calculus.Â  We now turn to whether the family courtâ€™s award of custody to\r\n  Husband was in the best interests of the children.Â Â  \r\nWife contends the\r\n  family court erred in awarding custody to Husband.Â  Wife claims the best\r\n  interests of the children would have been served by granting custody to her.Â \r\n  Specifically, Wife asserts she, unlike Husband, regularly takes the children to\r\n  church.Â  Moreover, she served as the primary care-taker of the children during\r\n  their marriage while Husband spent his time playing golf.Â  \r\nâ€œThe\r\n  paramount and controlling factor in every custody dispute is the best interests\r\n  of the child.â€Â  Brown v. Brown, 362 S.C. 85, 90, 606 S.E.2d 785, 788\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The family court must consider the character, fitness,\r\n  attitude, and inclinations on the part of each parent as they impact on the\r\n  child.Â  Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 415, 440 S.E.2d 884, 886\r\n  (1994).Â  Psychological, physical, environmental, spiritual, educational,\r\n  medical, family, emotional, and recreational aspects of the childâ€™s life should\r\n  also be considered.Â  Wheeler v. Gill, 307 S.C. 94, 99, 413 S.E.2d 860,\r\n  863 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œIn other words, the totality of circumstances unique to\r\n  each particular case constitutes the only scale upon which the ultimate\r\n  decision can be weighed.â€Â  Paparella v. Paparella, 340 S.C. 186, 189,\r\n  531 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nThe best interests\r\n  of the children are served by awarding custody to Husband, without considering\r\n  Wifeâ€™s immoral conduct.Â  First, the family court found Wife exposed her\r\n  children to safety risks while they were in her care.Â  Specifically, Wife\r\n  transported her four-year-old, Dawson, in the front seat without a booster seat\r\n  and had an exposed electrical socket in her home.Â  Second, both Husband and\r\n  Wife agree Johnsonville School District, where Husband lives, offers a better\r\n  education for their children than Lake City School District, where Wife lives.Â \r\n  In fact, while the parties were married and living in Lake City, Husband and\r\n  Cassidy, the only child old enough to attend school, stayed at Husbandâ€™s\r\n  parentsâ€™ home during the week so she could attend school in Johnsonville.Â  By\r\n  awarding custody to Husband, the children can attend school in this more\r\n  desirable school district.Â  See Glanton v. Glanton, 314 S.C. 58,\r\n  60, 443 S.E.2d 810, 812 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œThe education of a child is something\r\n  that affects his best interest.â€).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Guardian found Wife experienced difficulty controlling the children while in\r\n  her care.Â  During the Guardianâ€™s visit to her home, only two childrenâ€”Elizabeth\r\n  Grace and Dawsonâ€”were present.Â  Elizabeth Grace repeatedly screamed and cried\r\n  when denied her way and refused to listen to Wifeâ€™s request to apologize to her\r\n  brother.Â  In spite of her refusal to listen to her mother, Wife allowed\r\n  Elizabeth Grace to continue playing without consequence.Â  By contrast, Wife\r\n  spanked Dawson and sent him to timeout for pushing Elizabeth Graceâ€™s bike.Â  The\r\n  inability of Wife to control her children, and the inconsistent manner in which\r\n  she disciplined her children greatly concerned the Guardian.Â  However, the\r\n  Guardian observed completely different children in the care of Husband.Â  While\r\n  in his care, the children were â€œquiet, respectful, and loving.â€Â  The fact\r\n  Husband exhibits more control over the children and instills discipline in\r\n  their lives impacts the best interests of the child analysis.Â  See Paparella,\r\n  340 S.C. at 189, 531 S.E.2d at 299 (noting the totality of the circumstances is\r\n  the only way to determine the best interests of the children).Â  Â Â Â \r\nIn addition, Husband\r\n  works from home and maintains a flexible work schedule, which allows him to\r\n  spend more time with the children and adjust his schedule to accommodate their\r\n  needs.Â  Also, Husband lives with his mother, who is retired and willing to do\r\n  whatever necessary to help in raising the children.Â  By contrast, Wifeâ€™s work\r\n  schedule is very inflexible, and she has no one living with her in the house to\r\n  help in raising the children.Â  Lastly, while Wife served as the primary\r\n  caretaker of the children for a large part of their marriage, Husband has\r\n  changed very much since this early stage of their marriage and now freely fills\r\n  these roles.Â  As Wife stated, â€œHe wants to be daddy of the year.â€Â  â€œHe doesnâ€™t\r\n  play golf anymore.Â  He doesnâ€™t do anything.â€Â  In addition, Wife acknowledged,\r\n  since the separation, Husband cooks, cleans, and bathes the children.Â  In\r\n  considering all of the factors in this case, the best interests of the children\r\n  are served by awarding custody to Husband.Â  \r\n For the final issue\r\n  on appeal, we must consider whether the family court abused its discretion in\r\n  ordering Wife to pay $2,500 in private investigator fees to Husband.Â  Wife\r\n  argues Husband sought a divorce on the grounds of adultery.Â  However, the\r\n  family court refused to grant a divorce on this basis because he also engaged\r\n  in an extra-marital affair.Â  Specifically, the family court found the\r\n  affirmative defense of recrimination barred the grant of a divorce based on\r\n  adultery in this case.Â  Ultimately, the court ordered Wife to pay the private\r\n  investigator fees because her flagrant adulterous conduct caused Husband to\r\n  incur these expenses.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  20-3-120 of the South Carolina Code (1976 &amp; Supp. 2007) authorizes the\r\n  family court to order payment of litigation expenses, including attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees, to either party in a divorce action.Â  An award of attorneyâ€™s fees rests\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court and should not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â Doe v. Doe, 319 S.C. 151, 157,\r\n  459 S.E.2d 892, 896 (Ct. App. 1995). Â The family court is given broad\r\n  discretion in this area. Â Id.Â  â€œThe same considerations that apply to\r\n  awarding attorneyâ€™s fees also apply to awarding litigation expenses.â€Â  Patel\r\n    v.

Nienow, 268 S.C. 161, 173, 232 S.E.2d 504, 510 (1977)).Â  Reimbursable\r\n  expenses include reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in obtaining\r\n  evidence of a spouseâ€™s infidelity.

(Oakwood) and Hickory Hill Landfill (Hickory Hill) appeal two\r\n  orders of the South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Control (the Board)\r\n  affirming a landfill permit issued to T &amp; T Disposal, LLC (T &amp; T) by the South Carolina Department of Health and\r\n  Environmental Control (DHEC).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nSections\r\n  44-96-10 to 44-96-470 of the South Carolina Code are known as the South\r\n  Carolina Solid Waste Policy and Management Act (SWPMA). Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  44-96-10 to -470 (2002).Â  Section 44-96-80(A) of the South Carolina Code requires\r\n  each county in the State to prepare a single county solid waste management plan\r\n  or participate in a regional solid waste management plan.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-96-80(A) (2002).Â  Jasper County, South Carolina, elected to participate in a\r\n  regional plan through the Low Country Council of Governments (LCCG), which\r\n  drafted the Low Country Regional Solid Waste Management Plan (Low Country Plan)\r\n  in 1994.Â  The Low Country Plan was endorsed by Beaufort, Colleton, Hampton, and Jasper Counties.Â  The Plan states that â€œ[b]ased on the amount of disposal\r\n  capacity available in and around the Lowcountry there is no apparent need to\r\n  construct new domestic or inert landfill facilities in the next 20 years.â€Â  The\r\n  Plan also provides the â€œrequired annual reports due September 1 of each year will\r\n  represent the extent of progress over a given year and set forth any necessary\r\nrevisions or amendments.â€\r\nThe SWPMA also provides â€œ[n]o person shall operate a solid waste\r\n  management facility without a permit from [DHEC].â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(A) (2002).Â  Pursuant to SWPMA, on June 30, 2003, T\r\n  &amp; T filed a permit application with DHEC requesting\r\n  a Construction and Demolition, and Land-Clearing Debris Landfill Permit (landfill\r\n  permit) to construct a landfill in Jasper County. Â DHEC conducted a public hearing for the\r\n  project on October 27, 2003, and staff notified the public the proposed\r\n  facility would have an estimated disposal capacity of 1,819,000 cubic yards.\r\nDHEC was required to review the application to determine, among\r\n  other things, if the proposed facility was consistent with the Low Country Plan.[1]Â \r\n  The SWPMA does not specify procedures for DHEC to follow in making need and\r\n  consistency determinations.Â  Jasper County Council notified DHEC it found the\r\n  proposed T &amp; T landfill to be consistent with the countyâ€™s solid waste\r\n  management plan in letters dated October 29, 1997; May 7, 2000; September 27,\r\n  2000; and December 16, 2003.[2]Â \r\n  DHEC considered the letters to be amendments to Jasper Countyâ€™s portion of the\r\n  plan and â€œpenciled inâ€ the changes.[3]Â \r\n  DHEC also had minutes from the Jasper County Council meeting at which the\r\n  county council voted favorably on the matter.Â  After examining the applicable\r\n  county requirements, in addition to the above-mentioned documents, DHEC\r\n  determined T &amp; T would be able to meet the land use requirements after\r\n  receiving the requested landfill permit.Â  Thus, on January 14, 2004, DHEC issued the landfill permit to T\r\n  &amp; T and stated in the permit the facility would have a final disposal\r\n  capacity of approximately 1,819,000\r\n  cubic yards.\r\nOn January 30, 2004, Oakwood and Hickory Hill requested a\r\n  contested case hearing, challenging DHECâ€™s decision to issue the T &amp; T permit.Â \r\n  Oakwood and Hickory Hill alleged DHECâ€™s consistency determination failed to\r\n  meet the requirements of Section 44-96-290(F) of the South Carolina Solid Waste\r\n  Policy and Management Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(F)\r\n  (2002).Â  In the alternative, Oakwood and Hickory Hill argued the permit should\r\n  be revised to limit the final disposal capacity to 2.2 million cubic feet rather\r\n  than the 1,819,000 cubic yards approved by DHEC because Jasper Countyâ€™s Letter of Consistency called for a final disposal capacity of only 2.2 million cubic\r\n  feet.\r\nOn March 15, 2005, the Administrative Law Court (ALC) reversed\r\n  DHECâ€™s decision, finding the landfill was inconsistent with the Low Country Plan because the Plan had not been amended\r\n  to allow for the T &amp; T landfill.Â  Specifically, the ALC determined section 44-96-80(O) of the South Carolina Code required any amendments\r\n  to the Low Country Plan to be adopted by a multi-party endorsement.[4]Â  The ALC did not make any findings on the\r\n  capacity issue because its ruling on the consistency determination was\r\n  dispositive.Â  \r\nOn April 14, 2005, DHEC and T &amp; T appealed the ALCâ€™s final\r\n  order to the Board.Â  The Board upheld DHECâ€™s issuance of the permit on March\r\n  30, 2006.Â  The Board\r\n  determined neither section 44-96-80(O) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code nor the Low Country Plan placed any limitations on a\r\n  countyâ€™s ability to amend the plan as it applied to that particular county.Â \r\n  The Board also remanded the\r\n  matter to the ALC to determine the allowable maximum capacity for the landfill because\r\n  the ALC had not made any findings on the capacity issue.\r\nOn August 28, 2006, the ALC held DHEC had properly set the permit disposal capacity at\r\n  1,819,000 cubic yards.[5]Â \r\n  Oakwood and Hickory Hill appealed and on July 9, 2007, the Board affirmed the ALCâ€™s August 28, 2006 Order and affirmed DHECâ€™s decision to\r\n  set the final disposal capacity at 1,819,000 cubic yards.Â  This appeal follows. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  ALC presides over all hearings of contested DHEC permitting cases and, in such\r\n  cases, serves as the fact-finder and is not restricted by the findings of the\r\n  administrative agency.Â  Dorman v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,\r\n  350 S.C. 159, 164-65, 565 S.E.2d 119, 122 (Ct. App. 2002); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-600(A)-(B) (Supp. 2007). Â â€œAn aggrieved party may appeal the ALCâ€™s\r\n  decision to the agencyâ€™s Appellate Panel [(the Board)]; however, the Panelâ€™s\r\n  review is confined to the record and is governed by South Carolina Code section\r\n  1-23-610(C).â€Â  Terry v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 377\r\n  S.C. 569, 573, 660 S.E.2d 291, 293 (Ct. App. 2008). Â â€œAccordingly, the [Board]\r\n  can reverse the ALCâ€™s decision if it determines the ALCâ€™s findings are not\r\n  supported by substantial evidence contained in the record or are affected by an\r\n  error of law.â€ Â Id. at 573-74, 660 S.E.2d at 293-94; see also Grant\r\n    v. S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 353, 461 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1995)\r\n  (stating the ALCâ€™s findings are supported by substantial evidence if, looking\r\n  at the record as a whole, there is evidence from which reasonable minds could\r\n  reach the same conclusion as the ALC).\r\nAfter\r\n  an aggrieved party has exhausted all administrative remedies, the party is\r\n  entitled to judicial review by the South Carolina Court of Appeals. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A) (Supp. 2007). Â Judicial review is confined to the\r\n  record and is governed by South Carolina Code section 1-23-380(A)(5), which\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the\r\n    weight of the evidence on questions of fact. Â The court may affirm the decision\r\n    of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.Â  The court may\r\n    reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been\r\n    prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or\r\n    decisions are: (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b)\r\n    in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful\r\n    procedure; (d) affected by other error of law; (e) clearly erroneous in view of\r\n    the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (f)\r\n    arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted\r\n    exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2007).Â  â€œUnder our standard of review, we may not\r\n  substitute our judgment for that of the [ALC] as to the weight of the evidence\r\n  on questions of fact unless the [ALCâ€™s] findings are clearly erroneous in view\r\n  of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence in the whole record.â€Â  Commâ€™rs\r\n    of Pub. Works v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 372 S.C. 351,\r\n  358, 641 S.E.2d 763, 766-67 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Substantial evidence is not a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence, but evidence which, considering the record as a whole,\r\n  would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.Â  Leventis\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 340 S.C. 118, 130, 530 S.E.2d\r\n  643, 650 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  â€œThis Court, although not bound by the decision,\r\n  will ordinarily defer to the opinion of a state agency as to the interpretation\r\n  of a statute it is charged with the duty of enforcing.â€Â  S.C. Coastal\r\n    Conservation League v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, Op. No.\r\n  4450 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Oct. 23, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 40 at 65).Â  â€œThe construction of a statute by the\r\n  agency charged with its administration will be accorded the most respectful\r\n  consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling reasons.â€ Â Brown\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d\r\n  410, 414 (2002) (quoting Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of Examiners in Optometry,\r\n  291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Â Timeliness of Appeal\r\nRespondents\r\n  argue Appellants failed to timely appeal from the March 30, 2006 Order;\r\n  therefore, the issues in that order are not preserved for our review.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œAn\r\n  appeal to [this] court will not lie from an interlocutory order of the [Board]\r\n  unless such order affects the merits or deprives the appellant of a substantial\r\n  right.â€Â  Green v. City of Columbia, 311 S.C. 78, 79-80, 427 S.E.2d 685,\r\n  687 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  â€œAn order involves the merits if it finally determines\r\n  some substantial matter forming the whole or part of some cause of action or\r\n  defense in the case.â€Â  Id.Â  However, the courts of this state have\r\n  â€œconsistently held that an order of the circuit court remanding a case for\r\n  additional proceedings before an administrative agency is not directly\r\n  appealable.â€Â  Montjoy v. Asten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 52, 446\r\n  S.E.2d 618, 618 (1994); see also S.C. Baptist Hosp. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of\r\n    Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 291 S.C. 267, 270, 353 S.E.2d 277, 279 (1987)\r\n  (noting an agency decision that does not decide the merits of a contested case,\r\n  but merely remands to DHEC for further action is not a final agency decision\r\n  subject to judicial review).Â  â€œAdditionally, piecemeal appeals are not favored\r\n  by the court and should be avoided.â€Â  Foggie v. General Electric, 376 S.C. 384, 390 n. 2, 656 S.E.2d 395, 399 n.2 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008).\r\nIn Brown\r\n  v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission awarded\r\n  benefits to Brown for an occupational lung disease.Â  366 S.C. 379, 382, 622\r\n  S.E.2d 546, 548 (Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied, January 31, 2007.Â  The\r\n  circuit court affirmed the Commission on compensability, but found the Commission\r\n  should have allocated a portion of Brownâ€™s disease to his long history of\r\n  smoking and remanded for allocation.Â  Id. at 382-83, 622 S.E.2d at 548-49.Â \r\n  The remand included â€œspecific direction to make the necessary findings as to\r\n  the apportionment. . . .â€Â  Id. at 386, 622 S.E.2d at 550.Â  This court\r\n  addressed the appealability of the order under section 1-23-390:\r\n\r\n  The question here is whether the circuit court order is a â€œfinal\r\n    judgmentâ€ under section 1-23-390.Â  Generally, an order is a final judgment on\r\n    one or more issues if it constitutes an ultimate decision on the merits. Â In Owens\r\n      v. Canal Wood Corp., 281 S.C. 491, 316 S.E.2d 385 (1984), one of the two\r\n    cases cited by the Montjoy court, the supreme court found â€œ[t]he order\r\n    of the circuit court does not involve the merits of the action. Â It is\r\n    therefore interlocutory and not reviewable by this Court for lack of finality.â€Â  Owens, 281 S.C. at 492, 316 S.E.2d at 385 (emphasis added) (citations\r\n    omitted). Â Similarly, in Hunt v. Whitt, 279 S.C. 343, 306 S.E.2d 621\r\n    (1983), the supreme court held that â€œ[b]ecause the interlocutory order of the\r\n    circuit court does not involve the merits of the action, it is not reviewable\r\n    by this Court for lack of finality.â€Â  Id. (emphasis added) (citations\r\n    omitted). Â Accordingly, in determining whether the courtâ€™s order constitutes a\r\n    final judgment, we must inquire whether the order finally decides an issue on\r\n    the merits.\r\n  â€œAn order involves the merits if it finally determines some\r\n    substantial matter forming the whole or part of some cause of action or defense\r\n    in the case.â€Â  Green v. City of Columbia, 311 S.C. 78, 427 S.E.2d 685\r\n    (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Henderson v. Wyatt, 8 S.C. 112 (1877)).Â  In the\r\n    case sub judice, the order of the circuit court finally determined an\r\n    issue on the merits â€“ that Brownâ€™s smoking, a non-compensable cause,\r\n    contributed to his disability. Â The court noted â€œthe employer does have the\r\n    burden of proving . . . the interplay of a non-compensable causeâ€ and found\r\n    â€œthe employer clearly met that burden[.]â€ Â Consequently, the circuit court\r\n    ruled that â€œthe employer was entitled to a determination of the proportion\r\n    allocable to the non-compensable cause[.]â€ Â The case was remanded, not for\r\n    evaluation whether apportionment was appropriate, but â€œwith specific direction to\r\n    make the necessary findings as to the apportionment between compensable versus\r\n    non-compensable causes, and a corresponding reduction in the Claimantâ€™s\r\n    disability award.â€\r\n  The courtâ€™s order mandates apportionment. Â This\r\n    ruling is a decision on the merits because it decides with finality whether Greenwood is required to reduce its compensation . . . . Although the judge left the percentage\r\n    of apportionment to the commission on remand, the panel would have no choice\r\n    but to allocate some part of Brownâ€™s disability to the non-compensable cause. Â Accordingly,\r\n    the circuit courtâ€™s order constitutes a final decision on the issue of apportionment\r\n    and is appealable.\r\n\r\nId. at 387-88, 622 S.E.2d at 551 (emphasis in original).\r\nIn\r\n  comparison, in Foggie v. General Electric, also a workersâ€™ compensation case, this court noted an order of the\r\n  circuit court remanding a case for additional proceedings before an\r\n  administrative agency is not directly appealable.Â  376 S.C. 384, 388, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 395, 398 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  However, we found â€œwhere the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order constitutes a final decision on the merits and the remand order\r\n  has no effect on the finality of the decision, the order is immediately\r\n  appealable.â€Â  Id. at 389, 656 S.E.2d at 398.Â  \r\nIn Foggie,\r\n  the circuit court affirmed the Commission on two issues; however, the court\r\n  remanded the case to the Commission to make determinations related to permanent\r\n  total disability and credit for veteranâ€™s disability.Â  Id. at 387, 656\r\n  S.E.2d at 397.Â  We distinguished Foggie from Brown v. Greenwood Mills because the order in Brown finally determined the issue on the merits â€“ that\r\n  the employeeâ€™s smoking contributed to his disability â€“ and the remand by the\r\n  circuit court determined with finality whether there would be a reduction in\r\n  compensation, leaving open only the determination of the percentage of\r\n  apportionment for the Commission.Â  Id. at 389, 656 S.E.2d at 398.Â  Whereas,\r\n  the order in the Foggie case was not a final decision on the merits\r\n  because the circuit court did not make a final determination regarding whether\r\n  or not the claimant was totally and permanently disabled and did not finally\r\n  determine the employerâ€™s entitlement to the veteranâ€™s disability credit.Â  Id.Â  We noted that both of the remanded issues were matters within the purview of\r\n  the Commission, not this court, and because the issues had not been properly\r\n  considered by the Commission, the circuit court was correct in remanding the\r\n  case.Â  Id. at 390, 656 S.E.2d at 398.Â  We also noted the Commission is\r\n  the ultimate fact finder, and for this court to review the record and make\r\n  factual findings on the remanded issues would violate the governing APA statues.Â  Id. at 390, 656 S.E.2d at 398-99.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we held the circuit court order remanding the two issues was not a final\r\n  decision on the merits and, thus, was not immediately appealable.Â  Id. \r\nRespondents\r\n  argue Appellants should have appealed from the March 30, 2006 Order of the\r\n  Board because the decision as to consistency was on the merits, and thus, was\r\n  immediately appealable.Â  Respondents further argue because Appellants failed to\r\n  appeal from the March 30, 2006 Order, the holdings of that order are now the\r\n  law of the case, and the only matter that remained after the March 30, 2006 Order\r\n  concerned the final disposal capacity of the landfill.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  this case also is distinguishable from Brown because the Board remanded\r\n  the case to the ALC not only for a determination on the capacity\r\n  of the landfill, but also for a determination as to whether DHEC\r\n  was bound by the landfill capacity stated in Jasper Countyâ€™s Letters of\r\n  Consistency, which the Board found to be a valid amendment of the Plan.Â  As a result,\r\n  this case is more similar to Foggie because only the ALC could determine\r\n  whether DHEC was bound by the capacity stated in the Letter of Consistency or\r\n  whether DHEC is the sole agency that can determine capacity.Â  Therefore, until\r\n  the ALC ruled on that issue, there was no final agency decision on the merits\r\n  in this case and Appellants had not exhausted all of their administrative\r\n  remedies.[6]Â \r\n  As a result, Appellants timely filed their appeal after the receipt of the July 9, 2007 Order.\r\nII. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-80(O)\r\nAppellants argue Jasper County lacked authority to unilaterally amend the 1994 Low Country Plan, meaning the\r\n  Countyâ€™s purported amendments to the plan were invalid and the ALC correctly\r\n  denied the permit to T &amp; T because the proposed landfill is inconsistent\r\n  with the 1994 Low Country Plan.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe primary rule of statutory construction is that the Court must\r\n  ascertain the intention of the legislature.â€Â  Cooper v. Moore, 351 S.C.\r\n  207, 212, 569 S.E.2d 330, 332 (2002).Â  â€œIn ascertaining the intent of the\r\n  legislature, a court should not focus on any single section or provision but\r\n  should consider the language of the statute as a whole.â€Â  Mid-State Auto\r\n    Auction of Lexington, Inc. v.

Â Southeast Res. Recovery, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of\r\n    Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 358 S.C. 402, 408, 595 S.E.2d 468, 471 (2004).\r\nSection\r\n  44-96-80(O) of the South Carolina Code states â€œ[a]ny amendments to a county or\r\n  regional solid waste management plan must be adopted and implemented in the\r\n  same manner as provided for in the initial plan.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-80(O)\r\n  (2002).Â  However, the Low Country Plan does not specifically state how the Plan\r\n  is to be amended.Â  The SWPMA does not suggest that merely by proceeding under a\r\n  regional plan, a county loses the power to make independent planning decisions\r\n  regarding solid waste facilities located within its borders, or that such\r\n  authority is then automatically ceded to a regional Council of Governments or\r\n  other organization.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition to getting approval for the landfill at county meetings, Jasper County approved and issued four Letters of Consistency to DHEC.Â  At that time,\r\n  accepting a letter of consistency from a county was a common DHEC practice.[7]Â \r\n  Â Â In the past, the counties included in the Low Country Plan acted\r\n  independently in modifying the plan as to their individual counties and making\r\n  solid waste planning decisions.Â  Oakwood had the Low Country Plan modified as\r\n  it pertains to its landfill in Jasper County by the same procedure as the one\r\n  in this case â€“ Oakwood had a letter of consistency issued by the County in\r\n  April 2001, allowing it to significantly expand its facility.Â  Also, Colleton County amended the plan as it relates to that county and Beaufort County filed its own plan. Â None of these actions were challenged by the LCCG.Â  Furthermore, Chris\r\n  Bickley, Executive Director of the LCCG, testified Jasper County was free to\r\n  amend its solid waste plan without obtaining approval from the LCCG and the Low\r\n  Country Plan does not state the LCCG has to approve any amendments made by county\r\n  government.Â  Also, no testimony or evidence in the record supports the\r\n  conclusion that either the LCCG or the member counties acting collectively were\r\n  required to approve any plan amendment as it applied to any one county member\r\n  through a â€œmulti-party endorsement.â€Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the Board correctly construed the statute to mean that counties\r\n  participating in a regional plan retain the planning authority granted to the\r\n  counties under section 44-96-80 of the South Carolina Code, unless the express\r\n  terms of the plan indicate the counties have chosen to delegate that planning\r\n  authority to a regional authority.Â  Therefore, Jasper County properly amended\r\n  the Low Country Plan as to Jasper County.Â  As a result, Jasper County properly approved the T &amp; T landfill and the landfill was consistent with the 1994\r\n  Low Country Plan.\r\nIII.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-80(F)(1)\r\nAppellants argue the ALC correctly\r\n  found the failure of the LCCG to include Jasper Countyâ€™s revisions in its\r\n  annual report to DHEC was evidence the revisions had not been recognized by the\r\n  LCCG as valid amendments to the 1994 Low Country Plan.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â \r\nSection 44-96-80(F)(1) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code states:\r\n\r\n  Each county or region submitting a solid waste management plan to\r\n    the department shall thereafter submit an annual progress report to the\r\n    department by a date to be determined by the department.Â  The annual report\r\n    shall contain information as may be requested by the department but must\r\n    contain, at a minimum, the following: (1) any revisions to the solid waste\r\n    management plan previously submitted by the county or region. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-96-80(F)(1) (2002).Â  \r\nSection\r\n  44-96-80(F)(1) is not a provision that makes inclusion of a revision in the\r\n  annual progress report mandatory for recognition and acceptance of an amendment\r\n  to a solid waste management plan.Â  The statute does not provide that revisions will\r\n  be rendered null and void unless they are contained in the annual progress\r\n  report.Â  Jasper County did not include its amendments to its local solid waste\r\n  management plan in the annual progress report to DHEC, but DHEC was made aware\r\n  of Jasper Countyâ€™s revisions in the Countyâ€™s Letters of Consistency, which was\r\n  an accepted method of notification to DHEC.Â  Therefore, the annual progress\r\n  report is not the only means by which DHEC may become aware of revisions to the\r\n  Low Country Plan.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIV.\r\n  Â Final Disposal Capacity\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue if Jasper Countyâ€™s Letters of Consistency are deemed effective to amend\r\n  the 1994 Low Country Plan, the amendment can only be effective for the maximum\r\n  capacity authorized in the letters.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 44-96-320(A) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code provides that DHEC â€œshall promulgate, in addition to regulations\r\n  generally applicable to all solid waste management facilities, regulations\r\n  governing the siting, design, construction, operation, closure, and postclosure\r\n  activities of all landfills that dispose of solid waste.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-320(A) (2002).Â  Also, Section 44-96-290(H) states that\r\n  â€œ[p]ermits issued under this section shall be effective for the design and\r\n  operational life of the facility, to be determined by [DHEC] . . . .â€Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(H) (2002).\r\nDHEC is\r\n  the sole agency with the authority to promulgate regulations governing the design\r\n  of landfill facilities; therefore, it is the only entity with the authority to\r\n  determine a landfillâ€™s final disposal capacity.Â  Also, the ALC found that setting\r\n  the final disposal capacity at 2.2 million cubic feet, as stated in the Letters\r\n  of Consistency, would allow the facility to operate for only four or five\r\n  months, which is an absurd result.Â  Therefore, the ALC correctly determined\r\n  DHEC properly set the disposal capacity at 1,819,000 cubic yards.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the Orders of the Board are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\nPIEPER, J.,\r\n  concurs in a separate opinion. \r\nPIEPER, J., concurring:\r\n I concur in the\r\n  conclusion reached by the majority, but I respectfully would utilize a\r\n  different analytical framework as to the timeliness of the appeal.\r\nI agree this\r\n  case is distinguishable from Brown v. Greenwood Mills, Inc.[8]Â \r\n  However, I would not rely on the analysis of Foggie v. General Electric as the beacon to navigate us to our final conclusion based on my dissent\r\n  therein noting the fact that part of the case was finally determined by a\r\n  circuit court.[9]Â \r\n  Instead, I would distinguish Brown simply on the basis that the remand\r\n  in Brown occurred by virtue of judicial review by the proper reviewing\r\n  court; the question in Brown was whether the circuit court's order of\r\n  remand subsequent to a final agency decision was a final order on the merits\r\n  and appealable.Â  On the other hand, in the case herein, Respondents contend\r\n  Appellants should have appealed from a decision within the administrative\r\n  agency itself upon issuance of the Board's order of remand on March 30, 2006;\r\n  thus, the question here is whether an agency ruling before completion of the\r\n  administrative process must be immediately appealed.Â  Because Section\r\n  1-23-380(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) requires exhaustion of\r\n  &quot;all&quot; administrative remedies available within the agency unless\r\n  review of the final agency decision would not provide an adequate remedy, I simply\r\n  would hold there had not been a final decision requiring judicial review since\r\n  the exhaustion of all administrative remedies had not been met as of the March\r\n  30, 2006, order of remand. Â I would further hold there had not been a\r\n  preliminary, procedural, or intermediate action or ruling appropriate for\r\n  judicial review since review of the final agency decision provides an adequate\r\n  remedy. Â This statutory interpretation will avoid piecemeal review of\r\n  administrative decisions prior to completion or exhaustion of the\r\nadministrative proceedings.\r\nMoreover, I believe\r\n  that the judicial review mechanism of Section 1-23-380[10] may be distinguished from the appellate review mechanism of Section 14-3-330 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code.[11]Â \r\n  I believe a distinction based upon the posture of the proceeding and the\r\n  reviewing tribunal is necessary and complements the entire realm of\r\n  administrative law.Â  The legislature specifically created different mechanisms\r\n  for review to effectuate the goals of the administrative system it established.\r\nHere,\r\n  in the context of the timeliness of the appeal, we are asked whether the\r\n  intermediate or incomplete decision of the agency required earlier judicial\r\n  review to preserve the claim.Â  Thus, unless an exception to exhaustion applies,\r\n  we must determine at what point exhaustion of remedies has occurred to warrant or\r\n  require judicial review.Â  Quite simply, we must squarely address whether the\r\n  law of this State encourages the administrative process to proceed to its\r\n  formal conclusion, or whether at some other point in the process judicial\r\n  review of a partial decision is required to preserve a claim.\r\nThe\r\n  general rule &quot;that administrative remedies must be exhausted absent\r\n  circumstances supporting an exception to the rule&quot; is well established in South Carolina.Â  Hyde v. S.C. Dept. of Mental Health, 314 S.C. 207, 208, 442 S.E.2d\r\n  582, 583 (1994).Â  At its core, the doctrine of exhaustion serves two main\r\n  purposes: (1) the protection of administrative agency authority; and (2) the\r\n  promotion of efficiency.Â  Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 89 (2006).Â  An administrative agency's authority is protected by exhaustion\r\n  because it gives the agency &quot;an opportunity to correct its own mistakes\r\n  with respect to the programs it administers before it is haled into . . .\r\n  court, and discourages disregard of the agency's procedures.&quot;Â  Id. (internal quotation omitted).Â  Efficiency is promoted by the exhaustion doctrine\r\n  because claims generally can be resolved more rapidly and economically by\r\n  agency hearings and procedures than by litigation in court.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Moreover, &quot;even where a controversy survives administrative review,\r\n  exhaustion of the administrative procedure may produce a useful record for\r\n  subsequent judicial consideration.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThus, when a\r\n  statute mandates the exhaustion of administrative remedies, the animating\r\n  principles of (1) protection of agency authority and (2) efficiency are\r\n  necessarily present.Â  As such, although parties to a case may decide that\r\n  exhaustion is not efficient in a particular case, &quot;administrative law\r\n  creates an incentive for these parties to do what they would otherwise prefer\r\n  not to do, namely, to give the agency a fair and full opportunity to adjudicate\r\n  their claims&quot;; this is achieved by &quot;requiring proper exhaustion of\r\n  remedies, which means using all steps that the agency holds out, and doing so properly&quot;Â  Id.Â  In short, absent an exception, so long as there is an opportunity for\r\n  completion and review of a matter, then the parties must avail themselves of\r\n  the entire administrative process prior to seeking judicial relief.[12]\r\n In South Carolina, the doctrine of exhaustion is statutorily mandated in the Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act (APA), which &quot;purports to provide uniform procedures before\r\n  State Boards and Commissions and for judicial review after the exhaustion of\r\n  administrative remedies.&quot; [13]Â  Bursey v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n    Control, 369 S.C. 176, 182, 631 S.E.2d 899, 903 (2006).Â  While the doctrine\r\n  of exhaustion is not without exceptions, no exception has been presented herein\r\n  nor has any reason been presented as to why review of the final agency decision\r\n  would not provide an adequate remedy.Â  When a matter is remanded within the\r\n  administrative process itself, that matter is essentially &quot;in house&quot;\r\n  and does not lend itself well to the judicial review process until a final\r\n  agency decision is made.Â  To some extent, the premature involvement by the\r\n  judicial branch could ultimately impact the decision-making process the\r\n  legislature intended to grant to the executive branch through the\r\n  administrative process in the first instance.Â  Accordingly, I would hold the\r\n  Appellants timely filed their appeal.\r\nHaving\r\n  determined the appeal herein timely based upon a different analysis as the\r\n  majority, I respectfully concur in the remainder of the majority opinion for\r\n  the reasons cited and would affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Section 44-96-290(F) of the South Carolina Code states â€œ[n]o permit to\r\n  construct a new solid waste management facility . . . within a county or\r\n  municipality may be issued by the department unless the proposed facility . . .\r\n  is consistent with local zoning, land use, and other applicable local\r\n  ordinances, if any; [and] the proposed facility . . . is consistent with the\r\n  local or regional solid waste management plan and the state solid waste\r\n  management plan.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(F)\r\n(2002).\r\n[2]Â  These letters are referred to as Letters of\r\nConsistency by the parties.\r\n[3] DHEC\r\n  often received such letters from counties and DHECâ€™s practice was to handwrite\r\n  the changes into the applicable plan.Â  The\r\n  LCCG has not amended the 1994 Low Country Plan since its adoption; however, at\r\n  the time of DHECâ€™s review, the LCCG had submitted to DHEC a December 2002 draft\r\n  plan to replace the 1994 plan.Â  DHEC did not consider the draft plan in its\r\nreview because at the time it had not been approved by the regional counties.\r\n[4] Section 44-96-80(O) of the South Carolina Code states â€œ[a]ny amendments to\r\n  a county or regional solid waste management plan must be adopted and\r\n  implemented in the same manner as provided for in the initial plan.â€Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-96-80(O) (2002).Â  The Low Country Plan\r\ndoes not specifically state how the plan is to be amended.Â  \r\n[5] The ALC found the application of a final disposal\r\n  capacity of 2.2 million cubic feet for the facility would create an absurd\r\n  result as it would allow the facility to operate for only four to five months,\r\n  well below the design life of the facility and contrary to section 44-96-290(H)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(H) (2002).Â  The ALC also concluded section 44-96-320(A) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  provides DHEC is the sole agency with the authority to promulgate regulations\r\n  governing the design of landfill facilities; therefore, it is the only entity\r\n  with the authority to determine a landfillâ€™s final disposal capacity.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-320(A) (2002).Â  South Carolina\r\n  Regulation 61-107.11 imposes final disposal capacity restrictions on landfills\r\n  based on a facilityâ€™s design, including its size, dimension, layout, setbacks,\r\n  buffers, and depth to groundwater.Â  25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-107.11 (Supp.\r\n2007).\r\n[6]Â  South Carolina Code section 1-23-380(A) states that\r\n  â€œ[a] party who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within the\r\n  agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled\r\n  to judicial review.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A) (Supp. 2007).Â  Thus, because\r\n  the March 30, 2006 Order was not a final decision, Appellantsâ€™ administrative\r\nremedies were not exhausted until after the July 9, 2007 Order.\r\n[7]Â  Rudy Curtis, of DHEC, testified that since 1994, the\r\n  low countryâ€™s process to modify the Low Country Plan was to take action by any\r\n  county council and notify DHEC of the activity.Â  Once DHEC was notified of the\r\n  activity, it became an attachment to the 1994 Plan and was a part of that Plan.Â \r\n  Also, Arthur Braswell, Manager of DHECâ€™s Division of Solid Waste Management,\r\n  testified DHEC considers Letters of Consistency as modifications to a plan, not\r\njust as letters.\r\n[8] 366 S.C. 379, 622 S.E.2d 546 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n[9] 376 S.C. 384, 656 S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\n[10] Section 1-23-380(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2007) states the following: &quot;A party who has exhausted all administrative\r\n  remedies available within the agency and who is aggrieved by a final decision\r\n  in a contested case is entitled to judicial review under this article, Article\r\n  1, and Article 5. Â This section does not limit utilization of or the scope of\r\n  judicial review available under other means of review, redress, relief, or\r\n  trial de novo provided by law. A preliminary, procedural, or intermediate\r\n  agency action or ruling is immediately reviewable if review of the final agency\r\n  decision would not provide an adequate remedy. Â Except as otherwise provided by\r\n  law, an appeal is to the court of appeals.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  We also note that this statute has been amended, effective as of\r\n  June 16, 2008, such that Article 5 is no longer referenced.Â  See Act No.\r\n  334, 2008 S.C. Acts 334.\r\n[11] Section 14-3-330(1) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2005), captioned &quot;Appellate jurisdiction in law cases,&quot; references\r\n  appealability; it includes: &quot;any intermediate judgment, order or decree in\r\n  a law case involving the merits in actions commenced in the court of common\r\n  pleas and general sessions, brought there by original process or removed there\r\n  from any inferior court or jurisdiction, and final judgments in such actions;\r\n  provided, that if no appeal be taken until final judgment is entered the court\r\n  may upon appeal from such final judgment review any intermediate order or\r\n  decree necessarily affecting the judgment not before appealed from.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(1) (2005).\r\n[12] The statute suggests that as long as an adequate\r\n  remedy is available upon review of the final agency decision, any preliminary,\r\n  procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling would be premature for\r\n  judicial review.Â  Â§ 1-23-380(A) S.C. Code Ann. (Supp. 2007).Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  statutory language of Section 1-23-380(A) establishes the distinction between a\r\n  final decision and a decision that is preliminary, procedural, or intermediate\r\n  in nature.Â  Id.Â  Even in the context of these preliminary or\r\n  intermediate decisions, the statute does not require a party to seek immediate judicial review.Â  Id.Â  Similarly, the language of Section 1-23-610 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) also requires a final decision when\r\n  judicial review is sought from an administrative law judge.Â  Â§ 1-23-610 S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. (Supp. 2007) (Amended in Act No. 334, 2008 S.C. Acts 334).\r\n[13] While a caption is not controlling, I note the\r\n  applicable statute here is captioned &quot;Judicial review upon exhaustion of\r\nadministrative remedies.&quot;Â  Â§ 1-23-380(A) S.C.

Goode, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4486\r\n  Submitted November 1, 2008 â€“ Filed January\r\n13, 2009Â Â  \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Paul Dezso de Holczer, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Creighton B. Coleman, of Winnsboro; and Robert J. Sheheen, of Camden, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, A.J.: In this condemnation action, the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Transportation (the Department) argues the circuit court\r\n  erred in admitting evidence of an option held by Fairfield County to purchase Gloria Hoodâ€™s property.Â  We reverse and remand.[1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn June 30, 2004,\r\n  the Department filed a notice of condemnation in Fairfield County to acquire a 3.5-acre portion of Gloria Hoodâ€™s 14.2-acre tract for a highway project.Â \r\n  The Department subsequently filed this action to determine the value of the\r\n  condemned property.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Department moved in limine to exclude evidence of prior\r\n  unaccepted offers and unexercised options to purchase the condemned property. Â At\r\n  trial, Hood introduced evidence of an expired unexercised option held by Fairfield County in 2001 to purchase the entire 14.2 acre tract for $426,000, amounting to\r\n  $30,000 per acre. Â The Department objected, but the circuit held the option\r\n  admissible. \r\nHoodâ€™s\r\n  son testified the property was worth $30,000 per acre at the time the option\r\n  was executed, and the property had appreciated in the amount of $10,000 per\r\n  acre. \r\nUltimately, the\r\n  jury awarded Hood a $100,000 verdict, roughly $28,500 per acre.Â  The Department\r\n  filed motions for JNOV, new trial nisi remittitur, and,\r\n  alternatively, for a new trial absolute and for reconsideration pursuant to\r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP. Â The circuit court denied all of the Departmentâ€™s post-trial\r\n  motions. Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission or exclusion\r\n  of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial\r\n  court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion. Â Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 467, 611\r\n  S.E.2d 905, 908 (2005). Â &quot;An abuse of discretion\r\n  occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support.&quot; Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. The\r\n  Department first argues the circuit court erred in admitting evidence of the\r\n  option held by Fairfield County because it was never exercised.Â  We agree.\r\n Section 28-2-340 of\r\n  the South Carolina Eminent Domain Procedure Act (the Act) sets forth the types\r\n  of evidence admissible in condemnation proceedings to determine the value of\r\n  the property sought to be condemned.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-340 (Supp. 2007).Â \r\n  &quot;Evidence of the price and other terms upon any sale . . . relating to\r\n  the property or to any similar property in the vicinity . . . within a\r\n  reasonable time of the hearing&quot; is admissible under the Act.Â  Id. (emphasis added).\r\nSale is defined as\r\n  &quot;[t]he transfer of property for title or price.&quot;Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1337 (7th ed. 1999).Â  Option contracts are &quot;continuing offers to sell,\r\n  irrevocable during the option period.&quot; S.C. Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Hartough,\r\n  375 S.C. 541, 547, 654 S.E.2d 87, 90 (Ct. App. 2007) (emphasis added).Â  &quot;[T]he\r\n  transition of an option into a contract of purchase and sale can only be\r\n  effected by an unqualified and unconditional acceptance of the offer in\r\n  accordance with the terms and within the time specified in the option contract.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nIn Baynham v.\r\n  State Highway Department of South Carolina, 181 S.C. 435, 187 S.E. 528\r\n  (1936), our supreme court held an oral offer to purchase a filling station was\r\n  not admissible as evidence of the value of the filling station.Â  The court\r\n  relied on Sharp v. United States, 191 U.S. 341 (1903), and quoted the\r\n  following from Sharp:\r\n\r\n  Oral\r\n    and not binding offers are so easily made and refused in a mere passing\r\n    conversation, and under circumstances involving no responsibility on either\r\n    side, as to cast no light upon the question of value.Â  It is frequently very\r\n    difficult to show precisely the situation under which these offers were made.Â \r\n    In our judgment they do not tend to show value, and they are unsatisfactory,\r\n    easy of fabrication, and even dangerous in their character as evidence upon\r\n    this subject. \r\n\r\nId. at 349.Â  The supreme court in Baynham also\r\n  relied on Hine v. Manhattan Railroad Company, 30 N.E. 985, 986 (N.Y.\r\n  Sup. 1892), holding testimony regarding unaccepted offers is inadmissible\r\n  &quot;because it places before the court or jury an absent personâ€™s declaration or\r\n  opinion as to value, while depriving the adverse party the benefit of\r\n  cross-examination.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe admissibility\r\n  of an expired and unexercised option contract to prove the value of property at\r\n  a condemnation proceeding has not been addressed in South Carolina.Â  At least\r\n  one court, however, has likened expired and unexercised option contracts to\r\n  unaccepted offers and concluded they are not admissible for valuation\r\n  purposes.Â  See City of Des Peres v. Persels Pâ€™ship, 831 S.W.2d\r\n  778, 781 (Mo. Ct. App. 1992) (excluding expired option contracts as proof of\r\n  value in condemnation cases and stating &quot;[a]n expired contract is effectively\r\n  an unaccepted offer&quot;).Â  In addition, several courts, without differentiating\r\n  between expired and unexpired option contracts, have held option contracts are\r\n  inadmissible to prove value in condemnation cases.Â  See Depâ€™t of\r\n    Transp. v. Cochran, 287 S.E.2d 599, 600 (Ga. Ct. App. 1981) (&quot;In\r\n  condemnation cases where comparable sales are offered in evidence to explain\r\n  the value testimony of expert witnesses, it is frequently held that mere\r\n  options and unaccepted offers to purchase or sell are inadmissible as having no\r\n  substantial probative value.&quot;); J. William Costello Profit Sharing Trust v.\r\n    State Roads Commâ€™n of the State Highway Admin., 556 A.2d 1102, 1104 (Md. 1989)\r\n  (citations omitted) (&quot;Unlike consummated and binding contracts, offers are\r\n  inadmissible to prove the value of land because the value of an offer depends\r\n  on too many considerations to allow it to be used as a test of the worth of\r\n  property.Â  The same reasoning ordinarily militates against the admissibility of\r\n  option contracts.&quot;); but see Tedesco v. Mun. Auth. of Hazle Township, 799 A.2d 931, 935 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2002) (allowing evidence of an option\r\n  contract to prove value in a condemnation case and noting the Pennsylvania\r\n  Eminent Domain Code allows evidence of the price and other terms of sale in any\r\n  &quot;contract to sell&quot; and an option contract is a unilateral contract to sell).Â Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  reverse the circuit court and hold an expired and unexercised option contract\r\n  is essentially an unaccepted offer; thus, the circuit court erred in admitting\r\n  evidence of Fairfield Countyâ€™s option.Â Â Â  \r\nII. The\r\n  Department also argues the option was not admissible because it was held by Fairfield County, an entity with the power of eminent domain.Â  We need not address this\r\n  issue because we are reversing and remanding this case on other grounds.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340,\r\n  428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (holding courts need not address remaining\r\n  exceptions when the resolution of a prior issue is dispositive of the case).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., and KONDUROS, J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\ncase without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4487","title":"Chastain v.

(Realtor) provides residential real estate services\r\n  throughout the Greenville area.Â  Joan Herlong (Agent) is an independent\r\n  contractor for Realtor who provides services to individuals seeking to purchase\r\n  or sell real estate.Â  In January 2003, John H. Hiltabidle and Talle G.\r\n  Hiltabidle (Sellers) engaged Agent in conjunction with the sale of Sellersâ€™\r\n  residence (the Property).\r\nAgent\r\n  listed the Property for sale in 2003.Â  Appellants John R. Chastain and\r\n  Katherine Chastain (Buyers) were interested in purchasing the property and\r\n  hired Agent.[1]Â \r\n  Buyers submitted an offer for the Property and Sellers accepted the offer that\r\n  same day.Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 27-50-10 to -110 (Supp. 2008), the contract\r\n  for sale was contingent on Sellersâ€™ completion of a form titled â€œState of South Carolina Residential Property Condition Disclosure Statementâ€ (the Disclosure).Â  According\r\n  to the express terms of the Disclosure, it was â€œnot a warranty,â€ and it was\r\n  â€œnot a substitute for any inspections [Buyers] may wish to obtain.â€Â  \r\nOn\r\n  the Disclosure, Sellers responded affirmatively to two inquiries.Â  First, they\r\n  responded â€œyesâ€ to a question that asked: â€œWater seepage, leakage, dampness or\r\n  standing water or water intrusion from any sources in any area of the\r\n  structure?â€Â  Sellers explained their affirmative response to this question in\r\n  the Comments section of the Disclosure, describing two past flooding events: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tEarly 1990â€™s:\r\n  Hurricane Hugo.Â  Some storm runoff in garage [and] laundry room due to blockage\r\n  of culvert under Wembley Rd.Â  Action [taken]: Re-landscape to allow water to\r\nflow toward creek.\r\n\tFall\r\n  2002: Major tropical storm caused major flooding [and] road damage (throughout Greenville) â€“ Very light water seepage into garage due to blockage of culvert under\r\n  Wembley.Â  Action taken: City improved swale along Wembley Rd.Â  Project started\r\n  to install a device to prevent blockage of culvert.\r\n\tThe\r\n  creek on [the Property] has never exceeded its banks.\r\n\r\nSecond, Sellers responded â€œyesâ€\r\n  to a question that asked, â€œFlood hazards or that the property is in a federally\r\n  designated flood plane [sic]?â€Â  In a handwritten note next to their â€œyesâ€\r\n  answer, Sellers wrote, â€œGround floor above 100 [year] flood level.â€Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  Buyersâ€™ purchase of the Property, two days of rain resulted in several inches\r\n  of water intrusion onto the Property, causing damage to Buyersâ€™ furniture and\r\n  to the Property itself. Â \r\nBuyers\r\n  filed an initial summons and complaint alleging causes of action for negligence\r\n  and fraud[2] against Sellers arising out of the statements in the Disclosure.Â  An amended\r\n  complaint added Realtor as a defendant.Â  A second amended complaint added Agent\r\n  as a defendant.Â  All defendants answered denying the allegations of the complaint.Â \r\n  The parties agreed to dismiss Agent as an individual defendant on the\r\n  stipulation that, at all times relevant to this action, she was acting within\r\n  the course and scope of her employment with Realtor.Â Â Â  \r\nRealtor\r\n  filed a motion for summary judgment on the negligence cause of action and\r\n  included a written memorandum in support.Â  In the memorandum in support, Realtor\r\n  asserted two arguments.Â  First, the Disclosure did not contain any\r\n  substantively inaccurate or misleading information.Â  Second, Realtor did not\r\n  have actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged inaccuracies in the\r\n  Disclosure.Â  Buyers filed a motion in opposition to Realtorâ€™s motion for\r\n  summary judgment and a hearing was held on Realtorâ€™s motion.Â  Following oral\r\n  arguments, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Realtor on the\r\n  basis that Realtor did not have a legal duty to investigate latent defects in\r\n  properties or to advise clients on matters outside the scope of its expertise.Â  \r\nA\r\n  Form 4 reflecting the trial courtâ€™s decision was entered on April 24, 2007.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  Buyers filed a Rule 59(e) motion in which they argued the trial court did not\r\n  issue a detailed order reflecting its findings of fact and conclusions of law, did\r\n  not rule on their Rule 7(a) Due Process argument, and did not comply with the\r\n  rule that novel issues should be decided with a full and complete record.Â  The\r\n  trial court issued a seven-page order in which it set forth the factual and\r\n  legal basis for finding in favor of Realtor.Â  Buyers responded by filing a\r\n  second Rule 59(e) motion, the substance of which was essentially identical to\r\n  their previous Rule 59(e) motion.Â  This motion was denied without a hearing.Â \r\n  This appeal follows.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn appellate court reviews the grant of summary\r\n  judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court.Â  David v.\r\n    McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3&nbsp;(2006).Â  The\r\n  trial court should grant summary judgment if the pleadings, depositions,\r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\r\n  affidavits, if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\r\n  that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP; Russell v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 353 S.C. 208, 217, 578 S.E.2d\r\n  329, 334&nbsp;(2003).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist,\r\n  the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the\r\n  light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Law v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corr.,\r\n  368 S.C. 424, 434, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648&nbsp;(2006).Â  A court considering\r\n  summary judgment makes neither factual determinations nor considers the merits\r\n  of competing testimony.Â  David, 367 S.C. at 250, 626 S.E.2d at 5.Â  However,\r\n  summary judgment is appropriate when a properly supported motion sets forth\r\n  facts that remain undisputed or are contested in a deficient manner.Â  Id.Â  To survive a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must offer some\r\n  evidence that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to each element of the\r\n  claim.Â  Steele v. Rogers, 306 S.C. 546, 552, 413 S.E.2d 329, 333 (Ct. App.\r\n  1992).\r\nLAW &amp; ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp; Due Process/Notice\r\nRealtor\r\n  first argues the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment should not be reversed\r\n  on procedural grounds because Buyers failed to present their current argument,\r\n  that Realtorâ€™s summary judgment motion did not comply with Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP,\r\n  and Rule 56, SCRCP, to the trial court at the motion hearing or in their motion\r\n  for reconsideration.Â  We disagree.\r\nIt\r\n  is well settled that, but for a very few exceptional circumstances, an\r\n  appellate court cannot address an issue unless it was raised to and ruled upon\r\n  by the trial court.Â  Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 510-511,\r\n  598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004).Â  When an issue is raised to but not ruled upon by\r\n  the trial court, the issue is preserved for appeal only if the party raises the\r\n  same issue in a Rule 59(e) motion.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,\r\n  330 S.C. 71, 77, 497 S.E.2d 731, 734 (1998) (noting that proper use of a Rule\r\n  59(e) motion is to preserve issues raised to but not ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court); Walsh v. Woods, 371 S.C. 319, 325, 638 S.E.2d 85, 88 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006) (finding issue on appeal was not preserved because the trial court did\r\n  not rule on the issue and it was not raised in a Rule 59(e) motion).Â  \r\nBuyers\r\n  argued in their motion in opposition that Realtorâ€™s motion for summary judgment\r\n  â€œshould be dismissed as violative of SCRCP 7(b) because it does not\r\n  particularize the grounds upon which the relief is sought and therefore fails\r\n  to provide notice to the adverse party in violation of due process\r\n  guarantees.â€Â  Thus, the issue of Rule 7(b) was timely raised to the trial\r\n  court.[3]Â \r\n  However, at no time thereafter did the trial court specifically rule on this\r\n  issue.Â  When the issue was raised but not ruled upon, it became incumbent upon Buyers\r\n  to raise the issue in a Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at\r\n  77, 497 S.E.2d at 734.Â  Buyers filed not one but two Rule 59(e) motions.Â  The\r\n  substance of these motions, which are essentially identical, is limited to the\r\n  following arguments:\r\n\r\n\tThis\r\n  motion is made pursuant to SCRCP, Rule 59(e).Â  The grounds for the motion are\r\n  that the courtâ€™s [order] . . . is incomplete and ambiguous, sets forth neither\r\n  findings of fact nor conclusions of law, fails to set forth the courtâ€™s\r\n  reasoning for its rulings, does not rule upon the plaintiffs [sic] SCRCP\r\n    7(a) Due Process argument, is impossible to review on appeal, violates the\r\n  rule that novel issues should be decided with a full complete record, and it\r\n  fails to fairly set forth facts in the record that contradict the assertions\r\n  made in the order.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nBuyers base their\r\n  argument to this court on Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP.[4]Â \r\n  In their Rule 59(e) motions to the trial court, however, Buyers asserted a\r\n  â€œRule 7(a) Due Process argument,â€ rather than a Rule 7(b)(1) argument.[5]Â \r\n  In light of this apparent scrivenerâ€™s error, Realtor argues Buyers failed to\r\n  properly present their Rule 7(b)(1) argument to the trial court and, therefore,\r\n  may not argue the issue now.Â  We disagree.\r\nAlthough Buyersâ€™\r\n  Rule 59(e) motion is technically insufficient to preserve the issue of Rule 7(b)(1),\r\n  this Court will not apply the rules of error preservation so rigidly as to bar\r\n  an otherwise properly presented issue.Â  See State v. Guillebeaux,\r\n  362 S.C. 270, 274 n.1, 607 S.E.2d 99, 101 n.1 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding although\r\n  Guillebeauxâ€™s issue on appeal referred to a motion for mistrial instead of a\r\n  motion for a new trial, the court treated the references to mistrial in his\r\n  appellate brief as a scrivenerâ€™s error because the substance of the appellate\r\n  argument focused on the failure of the trial judge to grant a new trial under\r\n  the circumstances); State v. James, 362 S.C. 557, 562, 608 S.E.2d 455,\r\n  458 (Ct. App. 2004) (holding although James did not use the term â€œsubstantial\r\n  circumstantial evidenceâ€ in his motion for a directed verdict, the argument was\r\n  properly before the court because he argued in his directed verdict motion there\r\n  was insufficient evidence to support the elements of the charge); State v.\r\n    Russell, 345 S.C. 128, 132, 546 S.E.2d 202, 204 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding although\r\n  Russell did not use the exact words â€œcorpus delictiâ€ in his request for\r\n  a directed verdict, it was clear from the argument presented in the record that\r\n  the motion was made on this ground).Â  \r\nIn this case, Buyersâ€™\r\n  Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP, due process argument was presented and is, therefore,\r\n  preserved for two reasons.Â  First, Buyers previously presented a Rule 7(b) due\r\n  process argument to the trial court in their memorandum in opposition to\r\n  summary judgment.Â  Thus, when Buyers referred to â€œthe plaintiffâ€™s Rule 7(a) Due\r\n  Process argumentâ€ in their Rule 59(e) motions, it appears they were referring\r\n  to their previous Rule 7(b)(1) due process argument that the trial court had\r\n  not ruled on.Â  Second, Buyers called their Rule 7(a) argument a â€œDue Process\r\n  argument.â€ Â Because Buyers have maintained only one due process argument in\r\n  this case, namely the â€œparticularityâ€ requirement in Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP, correcting\r\n  the scrivenerâ€™s error in this case is warranted.Â  Â See Holroyd v.\r\n    Requa, 361 S.C. 43, 60, 603 S.E.2d 417, 426 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œOur courts\r\n  have corrected scrivenersâ€™ errors when warranted.â€).Â  We, therefore, find this\r\n  issue was sufficiently raised in the Rule 59(e) motions and, thus, properly\r\n  preserved for review.\r\n2.&nbsp; Prejudice\r\nRealtor\r\n  next argues, even if the court finds Buyers properly preserved the question of\r\n  whether Realtor complied with Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP, summary judgment in favor of\r\n  Realtor should be not be reversed on procedural grounds because Buyers can show\r\n  no prejudice from the allegedly deficient notice.Â  We agree.\r\nAs a\r\n  general rule, a party must establish prejudice as the result of anotherâ€™s\r\n  failure to comply with Rule 7(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  See M&amp;M Group, Inc.\r\n    v. Holmes, 379 S.C. 468, 474, 666 S.E.2d 262, 265 (Ct. App. 2008)\r\n  (subjecting Rule 7, SCRCP, to a prejudice analysis).Â  To demonstrate prejudice\r\n  in a matter involving allegedly insufficient notice, an appellant must\r\n  establish if he or she had received appropriate notice, he or she would have\r\n  done something different, thereby affecting the decision of the trial court and\r\n  advancing his or her case.Â  Gardner, 353 S.C. at 14, 577 S.E.2d at 197.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  applied to this case, Buyers must demonstrate they were unable to marshal an\r\n  effective defense in opposition to Realtorâ€™s motion for summary judgment due to\r\n  Realtorâ€™s failure to provide sufficient notice of the particular grounds on\r\n  which its motion was based.Â  In other words, Buyers must show that had they received\r\n  adequate notice, they would have done something different.\r\nBuyers\r\n  have made no such showing.Â  A week before the hearing on Realtorâ€™s motion for\r\n  summary judgment, Buyers filed a memorandum in opposition to Realtorâ€™s motion\r\n  for summary judgment in which they set forth detailed legal arguments and\r\n  factual bases for their opposition to Realtorâ€™s motion for summary judgment and\r\n  supporting memorandum.Â  Although Buyers claim they were not put on notice of\r\n  the particular grounds upon which Realtor sought relief, their memorandum in\r\n  opposition addresses the very same issues upon which the trial court ultimately\r\n  granted summary judgment in favor of Realtor, namely, whether Realtor had a\r\n  duty to investigate latent defects or representations by a seller, and whether\r\n  there existed questions of fact as to whether Realtor had violated the statute.Â \r\n  Thus, the alleged lack of notice did not prevent Buyers from marshaling a\r\n  defense in opposition to Realtorâ€™s motion.Â  Furthermore, Buyers have failed to\r\n  articulate any new argument or factual issue that they were unable to present\r\n  to the trial court due to a lack of notice.Â  Their brief on appeal essentially\r\n  mirrors their motion in opposition.Â  As such, the Buyersâ€™ argument that but for\r\n  the lack of notice, they would have done something different, is unconvincing\r\n  in light of the fact that they put forth the same arguments now that they did\r\n  at the motion hearing.Â  We, therefore, hold Buyersâ€™ procedural Due Process argument\r\n  is without merit. Â \r\n3.&nbsp; Merits\r\nBuyers\r\n  argue the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because Realtor owed\r\n  them a duty of reasonable care and disclosure and because questions of fact\r\n  remain as to what Realtor knew or should have known about the flooding history\r\n  of the Property.Â  We disagree for two reasons.Â  First, to the extent that Realtor,\r\n  as a real estate licensee, owes Buyers a legal duty, this duty does not include\r\n  investigating the veracity or adequacy of statements made on the Disclosure.Â \r\n  Second, Buyers have presented no evidence that Realtor had actual or\r\n  constructive knowledge that the statements on the Disclosure were inaccurate or\r\n  incomplete.\r\ni.&nbsp; Existence of a Duty\r\nAn\r\n  essential element in a cause of action for negligence is the existence of a\r\n  legal duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, and absent such a\r\n  duty, no actionable negligence exists.Â  Bishop v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Mental\r\n    Health, 331 S.C. 79, 86, 502 S.E.2d 78, 81 (1998).Â  The determination of\r\n  whether a duty exists in regard to the wrong alleged is a question of law for\r\n  the court.Â  Huggins v. Citibank, N.A., 355 S.C. 329, 332, 585 S.E.2d\r\n  275, 276 (2003).Â  If no duty exists, the defendant is entitled to judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  Id.\r\nA\r\n  real estate licensee is â€œnot obligated to discover latent defects in property\r\n  or to advise the agentâ€™s clients on matters outside the scope of the agentâ€™s\r\n  real estate expertise.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-57-137(F) (Supp. 2007); see also S.C. Code Ann Â§ 27-50-80 (Supp. 2007) (stating a real estate\r\n  licensee has no duty to inspect the onsite or offsite conditions of the\r\n  property and any improvements).Â  Additionally, a real estate licensee is not\r\n  liable to a purchaser if: (1) the owner provides the purchaser with a\r\n  disclosure form that contains false, incomplete, or misleading information, and\r\n  (2) the real estate licensee did not know or have reasonable cause to suspect\r\n  the information was false, incomplete, or misleading.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  27-50-70 (Supp. 2007); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-57-137(F) (stating\r\n  a real estate company is â€œnot liable to a buyer for providing the buyer with\r\n  false or misleading information if that information was provided to the\r\n  licensee by his client and the licensee did not know or have reasonable cause\r\n  to suspect the information was false or incompleteâ€).Â  Taken together, these sections\r\n  provide that a real estate licensee does not have a duty to inspect or\r\n  investigate the physical condition of a piece of property for the purpose of\r\n  confirming or denying statements made by a seller in a disclosure statement.Â \r\n  Rather, the Legislature places the duty of performing such an inspection or\r\n  investigation squarely on the shoulders of the buyer.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 27-50-80 (â€œThis article does not limit the obligation of the purchaser\r\n  to inspect the physical condition of the property and improvements that are the\r\n  subject of a contract covered by this article.â€).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Buyers were put on notice by Sellersâ€™ statements in the Disclosure that the\r\n  Property had some history of flooding.Â  To place on Realtor and other real\r\n  estate licensees the burden of further investigating the accuracy of such\r\n  statements would require them to have expertise in plumbing, electrical and\r\n  construction codes.Â  Because we do not believe this was the intent of the Legislature,\r\n  we affirm the trial court. \r\nii.&nbsp; Evidence of Actual or\r\n  Constructive Knowledge\r\nIn their brief, Buyers\r\n  present evidence from which it could be inferred that Realtor knew there was a\r\n  history of flooding in the neighborhood of the Property prior to 2003.Â  For\r\n  instance, Realtor represented Sellers in their purchase of the Property in\r\n  1985, at which time the Property had already experienced roughly $10,000 worth\r\n  of flood damage due to a 1982 flood.Â  Additionally, numerous individuals\r\n  associated with Realtor live in the same neighborhood where the Property is\r\n  located.Â  As such, Buyers argue because this evidence is sufficient to raise a\r\n  question of fact as to whether Realtor knew or should have known the Property\r\n  was prone to flooding, summary judgment was improper.\r\nHowever,\r\n  even assuming the substantive information about flooding in the Disclosure was\r\n  inaccurate or incomplete, and further assuming Realtor knew the Property had\r\n  flooded in the past, it would not necessarily follow that Realtor knew Sellersâ€™\r\n  statements in the Disclosure about the Propertyâ€™s flooding history were\r\n  inaccurate or incomplete.Â  As stated above, if the owner of a property provides\r\n  the purchaser with a disclosure form that contains false, incomplete, or\r\n  misleading information, the real estate licensee is not liable unless he or she\r\n  knew or had reasonable cause to suspect the information in the disclosure form was\r\n  false, incomplete, or misleading.Â  S.C Code Ann. Â§ 27-50-70.Â  The statute is\r\n  concerned with whether a real estate licensee knows the statements in a\r\n  disclosure form are false, not simply whether the licensee knows of a defect in\r\n  the property.Â  Therefore, to survive summary judgment, Buyers must present\r\n  evidence that raises a question of fact as to whether Realtor knew or should\r\n  have known that the statements in the Disclosure were inaccurate.Â  See Steele,\r\n  306 S.C. at 552, 413 S.E.2d at 333 (holding to survive a motion for summary\r\n  judgment, the non-moving party must offer some evidence that a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact existed as to each element of the claim).Â  \r\nBuyers\r\n  have not presented such evidence.Â  First, Buyers have not provided any evidence\r\n  that Realtor knew of any inaccuracies in the Disclosure.Â  Second, Buyers stated\r\n  under oath they were unaware of any evidence that Agent had knowledge of any\r\n  false, incomplete or misleading information in the Disclosure.Â  John Chastain\r\n  testified as follows:\r\n\r\n\tQ: Do\r\n  you have any knowledge that [Agent] had any knowledge of any of these events\r\n  described to you by your neighbors?\r\n\tA: I\r\n  have no knowledge, no.\r\n\tQ: Do\r\n  you have any knowledge that [Agent] had any knowledge of these alleged water\r\n  problems which she did not disclose to you?\r\n\tA: I do\r\n  not.\r\n\tQ: Do\r\n  you have any knowledge that [Agent] withheld any knowledge she may have had\r\n  regarding these water problems which she did not disclose to you?\r\n\tA: I do\r\n  not.\r\n\r\nLikewise,\r\n  Katharine Chastain testified as follows:\r\n\r\n\tQ:\r\n  Other than this conversation that you had with [Agent] regarding the Disclosure\r\n  Statement and the trampoline that was apparently caught in a culvert, do you\r\n  have any other evidence relating to [Agentâ€™s] alleged knowledge of flooding at\r\n  the residence?\r\n\tA: No.\r\n\tQ:\r\n  Sitting here today, do you have any reason to believe that [Agent] was aware at\r\n  the time she had the conversation with you about the Disclosure Statement that\r\n  anything other than the trampoline had caused potential flooding at the\r\n  [Property]?\r\n\tA: No.\r\n\r\nAgent\r\n  also testified under oath that she had no knowledge of flooding problems within\r\n  the neighborhood, no knowledge of water intrusion within the home purchased by Buyers\r\n  other than the information provided by Sellers to both her and Buyers, and no\r\n  reason to suspect or believe the information in the Disclosure completed by Sellers\r\n  was either false, misleading, or incomplete.Â  Because Buyers presented no\r\n  evidence Realtor or Agent knew or had reasonable cause to suspect Sellersâ€™\r\n  statements in the Disclosure about flooding were false, misleading or\r\n  inaccurate, the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment was proper.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER,\r\nJ. and GEATHERS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Sellers and Buyers\r\n  each executed a â€œConsent to Dual Agencyâ€ agreement on January 30, 2003, thereby\r\n  allowing Realtor to be the agent for both the buyer and the seller of the\r\nProperty.Â  \r\n[2] Buyersâ€™ action\r\n  for fraud was eventually dismissed on October 10, 2006.Â  Only the action for\r\nnegligence remains.\r\n[3] Buyers did not\r\n  allege non-compliance with Rule 56, SCRCP, in their motion in opposition or in\r\n  their Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Accordingly, we do not address this argument on\r\n  appeal.Â  See Lucas, 359 S.C. at 510-511, 598 S.E.2d at 715\r\n  (holding an appellate court will not address issues raised for the first time\r\non appeal).\r\n[4] Rule 7(b)(1),\r\n  SCRCP, states: â€œAn application to the court for an order shall be by motion\r\n  which, unless made during a hearing or trial in open court with a court\r\n  reporter present, shall be made in writing, shall state with particularity the\r\n  grounds therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order sought. The\r\n  requirement of writing is fulfilled if the motion is stated in a written notice\r\nof the hearing of the motion.â€\r\n[5] Rule 7(a),\r\n  SCRCP, states: â€œThere shall be a complaint and an answer; and a reply to a\r\n  counterclaim denominated as such; an answer to a cross-claim, if the answer\r\n  contains a cross-claim; a third-party complaint, if a person who was not an\r\n  original party is summoned under Rule 14, and there shall be a third-party\r\n  answer, if a third-party complaint is served. No other pleadings shall be\r\n  allowed, except that the court may order a reply to an answer or a third-party\r\n  answer; and there may be a reply to affirmative defenses as provided in Rule\r\n8(c).â€\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4488","title":"Pack v.

Randolph Waid, Ph.D., a neuropsychologlist, in May 2003.Â  \r\nÂ On\r\n  January 26, 2005, Appellants filed a WCC Form No. 21 Stop Payment application.Â \r\n  After a hearing was scheduled and the parties exchanged documents for\r\n  admission, however, Appellants withdrew their Stop Payment application.Â  Immediately\r\n  after this withdrawal, Pack filed a WCC Form 50, seeking either an award of\r\n  permanency for her brain, respiratory, and psychological injuries or, in the\r\n  alternative, an award finding she had not reached maximum medical improvement\r\n  and was entitled to reimbursement for and additional treatment by Dr. Lieberman\r\n  and Dr. Waid.Â  Pack alleged injury to her â€œwhole body, respiratory [system],\r\n  brain[,] allergen, [and] chemical sensitivityâ€ in connection with the August\r\n  18, 2002 incident.Â  Appellants filed a WCC Form 51, in which they admitted Pack\r\n  was exposed to herbicide and may have suffered transient effects but denied any\r\n  permanent injury.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Single Commissioner ruled Pack had not reached maximum medical improvement,\r\n  that she had injury â€œto her respiratory system, brain with psychological\r\n  overlay . . . when she was exposed multiple times to pesticides and herbicides,â€\r\n  and that Appellants should pay for continued treatment. The Appellate Panel of\r\n  the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (the Commission), in a 2-1 decision filed\r\n  June 19, 2006, affirmed the Single Commissionerâ€™s decision with amendments.Â  The\r\n  majority held Packâ€™s injuries were limited to â€œher respiratory system with\r\n  psychological overlayâ€ but did not include the brain.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  dissenting commissioner, Commissioner Barden, held: there was no evidence of\r\n  any respiratory injury, there was no objective evidence of any brain or â€œtoxic\r\n  exposureâ€ injury, Pack had reached maximum medical improvement shortly after\r\n  exposure to herbicide, and Pack had no residual permanency.Â  In support of her\r\n  position, Commissioner Barden noted: \r\n\r\n  (a)\r\n    [Packâ€™s] discharge summary from 2002 notes that her â€œrenal and hepatic\r\n    functions were normal,â€ her â€œneurological symptoms cleared within 24-48 hours,â€\r\n    and â€œthere was no slurring of speech;â€ (b) [Packâ€™s] claim appears to have as\r\n    its basis her Internet research dealing with acephate; however [Packâ€™s] plasma\r\n    and blood levels showed no signs of insecticide exposure; further, certified\r\n    toxicologists state that any symptoms from which [Pack] suffered were not\r\n    related to acephate; (c) Dr. Waid is not a medical doctor, and based his\r\n    findings on tests which show that [Pack] acts as if she has a toxic\r\n    exposure injury; (d) Dr. Lieberman simply recites the purported exposure to\r\n    organophosphates which no objective test has shown; (e) at most, [Pack] has had\r\n    a psychosomatic experience from her Internet research; at worst, [Pack] is\r\n    using the workerâ€™s compensation system for purposes of secondary gain; (f) all\r\n    the objective medical evidence, . . . which describes [Pack] as very\r\n    articulate and organized; that she has brought in a book with multiple tabs,\r\n    and which summarizes medical opinions from various physicians; and that she\r\n    speaks with fluency regarding the chemicals to which she was reportedly\r\n    exposed.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  in original).\r\nBoth\r\n  parties timely appealed to the circuit court.Â  Pack argued the Commission erred\r\n  in denying compensability for her physical brain injury, but the Commission did\r\n  not err in affirming compensability for respiratory and psychological injuries.Â \r\n  Appellants argued the denial as to Packâ€™s brain injury was proper because it\r\n  was supported by substantial evidence.Â  Appellants further contended the\r\n  dissenting opinion was correct and the majority opinion awarding compensability\r\n  for respiratory and psychological injuries was not supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to the brain injury, the circuit court reversed the Commission, holding â€œthe\r\n  only evidence contained in the record supports the original finding that [Pack]\r\n  sustained an injury to her brainâ€ and â€œ[t]he exclusion of the brain without\r\n  explanation is inconsistent with the medical treatment and evaluation the\r\n  Commission ordered.â€Â  As to respiratory and psychological injury, the circuit\r\n  court affirmed.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act applies to appeals from decisions of the Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  The\r\n  Commission is the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases and is\r\n  not bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Etheredge v.\r\n    Monsanto Co.,Â  349 S.C. 451, 454, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The\r\n  findings of the Commission are presumed correct and will be set aside only if\r\n  unsupported by substantial evidence.Â  Lark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d\r\n  at 306.Â  â€œSubstantial evidenceâ€ is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the\r\n  evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence that,\r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the\r\n  conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Taylor v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Motor Vehicles, 368 S.C. 33, 36, 627 S.E.2d 751, 752\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).Â  \r\nLAW &amp; ANALYSIS\r\n1. Packâ€™s Estoppel Argument\r\nAs\r\n  an initial matter, Pack argues Appellants should be estopped from denying that\r\n  she has suffered a brain injury because in their Form 51, Appellants â€œadmit\r\n  [Pack] was exposed to herbicide and may have suffered transient effects.â€Â \r\n  However, Pack has cited no legal authority to support the argument that this\r\n  amounts to a judicially binding admission of Packâ€™s alleged injury.Â  As such,\r\n  this argument is conclusory, and such arguments are deemed abandoned on\r\n  appeal.Â  See Mulherin-Howell v. Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 587, 593-94 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding party abandoned an issue on appeal\r\n  due to failure to cite any supporting authority and making only conclusory\r\n  arguments).\r\n2. Brain Injury\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the circuit court erred in reversing the Commissionâ€™s decision that Pack\r\n  has not suffered a brain injury because (a) the circuit court improperly made\r\n  its own factual determination regarding the brain injury, and (b) substantial\r\n  evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s denial of the brain injury claim.Â  Because we\r\n  agree with Appellants on the first point, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s ruling\r\n  as to the brain injury.Â  However, we do not affirm the Commissionâ€™s original\r\n  ruling because the Commissionâ€™s finding that Pack suffered injuries to the\r\n  respiratory system with psychological overlay, standing alone, does not\r\n  constitute a sufficient finding to warrant denial of the brain injury.Â \r\n  Instead, we remand the issue to the Commission to make further findings of fact\r\n  as to the brain injury.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the Commission disagreed with the Single Commissionerâ€™s finding that\r\n  Pack had suffered a brain injury.Â  Specifically, the Commission held Packâ€™s\r\n  only injuries were â€œto her respiratory system, with psychological overlay,â€\r\n  whereas the Single Commissioner included the brain.Â  The circuit court noted\r\n  this difference of opinion between the Single Commissioner and the Commission\r\n  and characterized it as a failure by the Commission to make an essential\r\n  finding of fact, such that remand would normally be appropriate.Â  The circuit\r\n  court found:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    Decision and Order of the [Commission] included neither a finding of fact nor\r\n    conclusion of law explaining why the brain was removed as an affected body\r\n    part.Â  Remand is proper where the Commission has failed to make essential\r\n    findings of fact, or the findings are so indefinite or general as to afford no\r\n    reasonable basis upon which the appellate court can determine whether the\r\n    findings are supported by the evidence and whether the law has been properly\r\n    applied to the findings.Â  \r\n\r\n(internal\r\n  citations omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court went on, however, to hold that remand was not appropriate in this\r\n  case because the evidence in the record would only support a finding in\r\n  favor of Pack on the issue of brain injury.Â  The circuit court stated:\r\n\r\n  [H]owever,\r\n    where the evidence is susceptible of but one reasonable inference, the question\r\n    becomes a matter of law for the appellate court rather than the [Commission].Â  The only medical evidence contained in the record supports the\r\n    [Single Commissionerâ€™s] original finding that [Pack] sustained an injury to the\r\n    brain.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  added) (internal citations omitted).\r\nThis\r\n  was error for two reasons.Â  First, the latter holding was erroneous because\r\n  questions of fact are decided solely by the Commission, and the court reviewing\r\n  the Commissionâ€™s decision lacks authority to determine factual issues, except\r\n  in jurisdictional matters.Â  Fox v. Newberry County Memâ€™l Hosp., 319 S.C.\r\n  278, 280, 461 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1995).Â  Although the circuit court correctly\r\n  stated that when the evidence is susceptible of but one reasonable inference,\r\n  the question becomes a matter of law, Mullinax v. Winn Dixie Stores, Inc.,\r\n  318 S.C. 431, 437, 458 S.E.2d 76, 80 (Ct. App. 1995), the circuit court erred\r\n  in concluding there was no medical evidence in the record that would negate\r\n  Packâ€™s claim of a brain injury.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record is replete with such evidence.Â  Dr. Bill Simpson, a family medicine specialist\r\n  at the Medical University of South Carolina, stated, â€œ[Packâ€™s] neurological\r\n  examination is grossly intact.â€Â  Dr. Waid stated Pack was â€œ[q]uite talkative\r\n  during the evaluation process,â€ that her â€œ[c]onversational speech was prosodic,\r\n  fluent, of normal rate and toneâ€ and she â€œdid not demonstrate any word finding\r\n  difficulties in conversational speech.â€Â  Dr. Gordon Early, a specialist in\r\n  occupational medicine, noted blood tests conducted soon after Packâ€™s last alleged\r\n  exposure revealed no evidence of any exposure to insecticide.Â  Two board\r\n  certified toxicologists offered their opinions that there was no evidence of\r\n  any toxic exposure to insecticide and that, at most, Pack had transient\r\n  symptoms from herbicide exposure.Â  Dr. Robert M. Bennett, a forensic\r\n  toxicologist, reported that any biochemical changes that occur due to the\r\n  toxicity of acephate are relatively short-lived, typically clearing in a matter\r\n  of days.Â  Dr. Bennet further stated, â€œNo chronic, permanent or lasting organic\r\n  biochemical somatic or neurological changes have been shown in the medical\r\n  literatureâ€ and thatÂ  â€œthere are no reported cases of long term health effects\r\n  in humans due to acephate or its formulations.â€Â  Because the record contains\r\n  conflicting evidence on the question of whether Pack suffered a brain injury,\r\n  it was error for the circuit court to hold that the only medical evidence in\r\n  the record supports the Single Commissionerâ€™s original finding that Pack\r\n  sustained an injury to the brain.Â  For this reason, the circuit courtâ€™s holding\r\n  is reversed.\r\nSecond,\r\n  the circuit court erred to the extent that it held it was improper for the\r\n  Commission to disagree with the findings of the Single Commissioner.Â  The\r\n  Commission is the ultimate fact finder in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases and is\r\n  not bound by the Single Commissionerâ€™s findings of fact. Â Gadson v. Mikasa\r\n    Corp., 368 S.C. 214, 221, 628 S.E.2d 262, 266 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Pursuant to\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-50 (Supp. 2007), the Commission shall weigh the evidence\r\n  as presented at the initial hearing and, if good grounds are shown, make its\r\n  own findings of fact and reach its own conclusions of law consistent or\r\n  inconsistent with those of the Single Commissioner.Â  Lowe v. Am-Can Transp.\r\n    Servs. Inc., 283 S.C. 534, 537, 324 S.E.2d 87, 89 (Ct. App. 1984); see also Green v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 250 S.C. 58, 64, 156\r\n  S.E.2d 318, 321 (1967) (holding although it is logical for the Commission to\r\n  give weight to the Single Commissionerâ€™s opinion, the Commission may disagree\r\n  with his findings based on the credibility of witnesses).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, the mere fact that the Commission disagreed with the Single\r\n  Commissioner did not, by itself, constitute a failure to make an essential\r\n  finding of fact.Â  See Lowe, 283 S.C. at 537, 324 S.E.2d at 89 (holding\r\n  the Commission had the power to make its own findings consistent with or\r\n  inconsistent with those of the Single Commissioner whether or not the Single Commissionerâ€™s\r\n  holdings were based on competent substantial evidence and whether or not they\r\n  were based on credibility of witnesses he had personally observed).Â  Rather,\r\n  the Commissionâ€™s error was in its failure to explain its disagreement â€“ i.e.,\r\n  its failure to explain exactly why it denied Packâ€™s claim of brain injury.Â  The\r\n  absence of any findings to support the Commissionâ€™s denial leaves this Court no\r\n  way of evaluating the reasoning behind the Commissionâ€™s decision.Â  We,\r\n  therefore, remand the issue to the Commission to make further findings to\r\n  support its decision as to Packâ€™s claim of brain injury.[2]Â  See Fox, 319 S.C. at 280, 461 S.E.2d at 394 (holding when an\r\n  administrative agency acts without first making the proper factual findings\r\n  required by law, the proper procedure is to remand the case and allow the\r\n  agency the opportunity to make those findings).\r\n3. Respiratory and\r\nPsychological Overlay\r\nThe\r\n  Commission ruled, and the circuit court affirmed, that Pack suffered both\r\n  respiratory and psychological injuries.Â  Appellants argue the circuit court\r\n  erred in affirming the Commission because (a) substantial evidence does not\r\n  support the respiratory injury claim, and (b) the psychological injury claim\r\n  does not meet the legal standard for compensability.Â  We agree with the circuit\r\n  court and the Commission that Packâ€™s claim of injury to her respiratory system\r\n  is supported by substantial evidence. Â Therefore, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  holding as to that issue. Â However, we remand the issue of psychological injury\r\n  to the Commission for more definite factual findings of a causal connection\r\n  between Packâ€™s physical injuries, either brain or respiratory, and her\r\n  psychological injuries.\r\n\r\n  a) Respiratory Injury\r\n\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the circuit court erred in affirming the Commissionâ€™s decision that Pack\r\n  suffered an injury to her respiratory system because substantial evidence does\r\n  not support a finding of a continuing respiratory injury.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œSubstantial\r\n  evidenceâ€ is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence viewed blindly\r\n  from one side of the case, but is evidence that, considering the record as a\r\n  whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion as the Commission.Â  Taylor, 368 S.C. at 36, 627 S.E.2d at 752.Â  Where there are conflicts\r\n  in the evidence over a factual issue, the findings of the Commission are conclusive.\r\n  Â Rogers v. Kunja Knitting Mills, Inc., 312 S.C. 377, 380, 440\r\n  S.E.2d 401, 403 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The Commission need not accept or believe\r\n  medical or other expert testimony, even when it is unanimous, uncontroverted,\r\n  or uncontradicted.Â  100A C.J.S. Workersâ€™ Compensation Â§1023 (2000). Â Thus, even\r\n  sharply contradicted evidence of injury can constitute substantial evidence for\r\n  purposes of review.Â  See, e.g., Williams v. S.C. Depâ€™t. of\r\n    Mental Retardation, 308 S.C. 438, 439-40, 418 S.E.2d 555, 556 (Ct. App.\r\n  1992) (holding substantial evidence supported Commissionâ€™s finding that claimant\r\n  suffered a permanent ten percent impairment to her back, despite the fact that\r\n  all of the experts, except claimantâ€™s family physician, agreed after close\r\n  physical examinations that claimant had no permanent partial impairment).\r\nWhile\r\n  the evidence in the record tending to support Packâ€™s alleged respiratory injury\r\n  is far from overwhelming,[3] the record does contain substantial evidence to support the Commissionâ€™s\r\n  conclusion Pack has suffered a respiratory injury.Â  Dr. Lieberman listed among\r\n  his diagnoses â€œexcessive bronchial secretions[,] . . . wheezing[,] . . . [and]\r\n  bronco spasms.â€Â  Dr. Stewart, a rehabilitation counselor, concluded Pack\r\n  â€œsustained significant work-related injuries to her brain (cognitive\r\n  dysfunction) and lungs/breathing passages.â€Â  Dr. Brian S. Dantzler, an\r\n  allergist, diagnosed Pack with asthma â€œbased upon a combination of clinical\r\n  history of coughing, wheezing, or episodic difficulty breathing.â€Â  Considering\r\n  the record as a whole, this evidence could allow reasonable minds to conclude Pack\r\n  suffered respiratory injury.Â  See Taylor, 368 S.C. at 36, 627\r\n  S.E.2d at 752 (holding evidence is substantial if, considering the record as a\r\n  whole, it â€œwould allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the\r\n  administrative agency reached in order to justify its action[]â€).Â  Because the\r\n  evidence is conflicting on this issue, the circuit court did not err in\r\n  affirming the Commissionâ€™s holding.Â  See Rogers, 312 S.C. at 381,\r\n  440 S.E.2d at 403 (holding the circuit courtâ€™s reversal of the Commission was\r\n  error because although the evidence conflicted, the Commissionâ€™s findings were\r\n  supported by substantial evidence).\r\n\r\n  b) Psychological Injury\r\n\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the circuit court erred in affirming the Commissionâ€™s decision that Pack\r\n  suffered a psychological injury because Packâ€™s claim for psychological injury\r\n  does not meet the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2007).Â \r\n  Although we agree with Pack that substantial evidence supports the Commissionâ€™s\r\n  finding that she suffered an injury to her respiratory system, we do not\r\n  believe the Commission made adequate findings of fact establishing a causal\r\n  connection between Packâ€™s physical injuries and her psychological injuries.Â  We,\r\n  therefore, remand the issue to the Commission for more specific findings of a\r\n  causal connection.\r\nClaims\r\n  for psychological injury are compensable only if the claimant proves by a\r\n  preponderance of evidence they are caused by physical injury or by extraordinary\r\n  and unusual conditions of employment.Â  Frame v. Resort Servs. Inc.,Â  357\r\n  S.C. 520, 528, 593 S.E.2d 491, 495 (Ct. App. 2004).[4]Â \r\n  In this case, there is no contention Pack suffered extraordinary and unusual\r\n  conditions of employment.Â  Therefore, for Packâ€™s psychological injuries to be\r\n  compensable, Pack must prove a physical injury caused her psychological\r\n  injury.Â  Estridge v. Joslyn Clark Controls, Inc., 325 S.C. 532, 538, 482\r\n  S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nThere\r\n  are two alleged physical injuries in this case: brain and respiratory.Â  From\r\n  the record, Packâ€™s position appears to be her alleged brain injury, not her\r\n  respiratory injury, is what caused her psychological injuries.[5]Â \r\n  Indeed, the Single Commissioner grouped the psychological injuries with the brain\r\n  injuries, describing Packâ€™s injuries as â€œrespiratory [and] brain with\r\n  psychological overlay,â€ and â€œbrain accompanied with psychological overlay[]â€).Â \r\n  Thus, a finding that Pack has psychological injuries would seem to be\r\n  contingent upon the Commission finding she had brain injuries.Â  It was,\r\n  therefore, puzzling that the Commission found psychological injuries while\r\n  denying the brain injury.Â  In doing so, the circuit court implicitly held that\r\n  Packâ€™s respiratory injuries caused the psychological injuries.Â  However, the circuit\r\n  court made no findings of fact to support this.\r\nThe\r\n  task of an appellate court is to inquire whether the Commissionâ€™s findings are\r\n  supported by substantial evidence.Â  Lark, 276 S.C. at 136, 276 S.E.2d at\r\n  307.Â  However, without clear findings of fact, this Court cannot evaluate the\r\n  decision of the Commission under the substantial evidence standard.Â  See Drake v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 241 S.C. 116, 123, 127 S.E.2d 288,\r\n  292 (1962) (holding remand is proper where Commissionâ€™s order affords no\r\n  reasonable basis upon which the appellate court can determine whether the\r\n  findings of fact are supported by the evidence and whether the law has been\r\n  properly applied to those findings).Â  Here, there are inadequate findings as to\r\n  what caused Packâ€™s psychological injuries.Â  We, therefore, remand this issue to\r\n  the Commission to make further findings as to the causal link between Packâ€™s\r\nphysical injuries, either brain or respiratory, and her psychological injuries.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs\r\n  to the brain injury, the circuit courtâ€™s reversal of the Commission is\r\n  reversed, and the issue is remanded to the Commission for further findings on\r\n  brain injury.\r\nAs\r\n  to the respiratory injury, the circuit courtâ€™s ruling is affirmed.\r\nAs\r\n  to psychological injuries, the issue is remanded to the Commission for more\r\n  specific fact-finding on the causal link between Packâ€™s physical injuries and\r\n  her psychological injuries.\r\nPIEPER and\r\n  GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Dr. Lieberman\r\n  is a Fellow in the American Academy of Environmental Medicine and a Diplomat in\r\n  American Board of Environmental Medicine, a member of the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, and a member of the Carolinas Occupational\r\nMedical Association.Â  \r\n[2] Regardless of\r\n  whether the Commission denies or awards brain injury on remand, this Court\r\nsimply requests that the Commission explain its reasoning thoroughly.\r\n[3] Except for a\r\n  few places in the record, the only context in which Packâ€™s respiratory system\r\n  is even mentioned is in the discussion of her alleged inhalation of the\r\n  chemical fumes that caused an injury to her brain.Â  The various evaluations in\r\n  the record from physicians and medical professionals focus almost exclusively\r\n  on her â€œneurocognitive dysfunction.â€Â  Few discuss her respiratory system at all.Â \r\n  Moreover, many (if not most) of the evaluations that do discuss her respiratory\r\n  system suggest that it is healthy.Â  For example, Dr. Waid stated Packâ€™s\r\n  â€œ[c]onversational speech was prosodic, fluent, or normal rate and tone.â€Â  Dr.\r\n  Early stated â€œ[Pack] has a broad affect and laughs frequently. . . . The lungs\r\n  are clear.â€Â  Dr. Dantzler stated Pack showed â€œno significant airflow\r\n  obstruction in either large or small airways.â€Â  Pack even reported to one\r\n  physician, Dr. Patrick Harm, that she is â€œactive, working out on a Bowflex\r\n  machine three times a week, occasionally biking.â€Â  It is also worth noting that\r\n  Pack did not even address the sufficiency of the evidence of the respiratory\r\ninjury in her brief.Â  \r\n[4] Section\r\n  42-1-160(B) states that mental injuries are not compensable unless the employee\r\nestablishes, by a preponderance of the evidence:\r\nâ€œ(1) that the\r\n  employeeâ€™s employment conditions causing the stress, mental injury, or mental\r\n  illness were extraordinary and unusual in comparison to the normal conditions of\r\nthe particular employment; and\r\n(2) the medical\r\n  causation between the stress, mental injury, or mental illness, and the\r\nstressful employment conditions by medical evidence.â€\r\n[5] For example,\r\n  Dr. Waid states, â€œ[s]lowed mental/cognition, difficulty sustaining\r\n  attention/concentration, and reduced capacity for immediate learning . . . are\r\nconsistent with that expected when there is toxic injury to the brain.â€).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4489","title":"Skipper v.

Perrone and Carol Repec Perrone, as Personal\r\n  Representative of the Estate of Joel E. Perrone appeal the order of the special\r\n  referee setting aside a deed on the ground of undue influence.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  October 25, 1993, a deed from C. D. Nixon to his sister, Gloria Perrone, and\r\n  nephew, Joel E. Perrone, was filed in the Horry County Register of Deeds\r\n  Office.Â  The deed was subsequently re-recorded on May 29, 1994. It was\r\n  witnessed by Margaret S. Mullinax and Beverly A. Bell.Â  The stated consideration\r\n  was $10.00.Â Â  The deed purported to convey:\r\n\r\n\tALL AND\r\n  SINGULAR, the properties located in the County of Horry, State of South\r\n  Carolina, in the Little River Township now owned by the Grantor, and being the\r\n  remaining property conveyed to the Grantor by deed of East Cherry Grove Realty\r\n  Company, a corporation, dated June 9, 1997, and recorded in the records of\r\n  Horry County in Deed Book 584, page 617.Â  The description in said deeds being\r\n  included as if fully set out herein.Â  \r\n\tALSO,\r\n  All reservations, rights, interest in and rights of enforcing the same, which\r\n  have not been sold, deeded, or transferred, including but not exclusiveÂ  of\r\n  those in any roads, avenues, attests, parks, lanes or beaches, together with\r\n  all rights which have been reserved by the Grantor in prior conveyances as\r\n  contained in the official Cherry Grove Beach Deed as restrictions and\r\n  conditions.Â  \r\n\r\nNixon passed away\r\n  on December 13, 1995.Â  Under the terms of his will, the bulk of his estate\r\n  passed to a corporation to be formed and owned by John W. Ray, his long time\r\n  accountant, and Dr. N.F. Nixon, Jr., his nephew and personal physician.Â \r\n  Neither Gloria nor Joel Perrone was a beneficiary under the will.[1]Â  \r\nWindle E. Skipper,\r\n  the personal representative of Nixonâ€™s estate, brought the present action on\r\n  October 1, 2003 seeking to have the deed set aside on the grounds of lack of\r\n  consideration, undue influence, lack of competency, that the deed was executed\r\n  in blank, and lack of required witnesses.Â  The circuit court dismissed the\r\n  grounds of lack of consideration and lack of required witnesses.Â  The remaining\r\n  grounds were tried before the special referee.Â Â  \r\nThe special referee\r\n  found that during the latter part of 1993 Nixon was either incompetent or\r\n  substantially impaired due to his advanced age and physical and mental\r\n  condition.Â  In addition, the referee held the consideration for the deed was\r\n  grossly inadequate.Â  Accordingly, the referee concluded the deed should be set\r\n  aside on the grounds of undue influence.Â  He rejected Appellantsâ€™ defenses of laches, estoppel, and waiver. Â Appellants filed a motion to reconsider, alter,\r\n  or amend, which the referee denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  action to set aside a deed on the basis of undue influence is an action in\r\n  equity.Â  Donnan v. Mariner, 339 S.C. 621, 626, 529 S.E.2d 754, 757 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2000).Â  When reviewing an action in equity, this court may review the\r\n  evidence to determine facts in accordance with our own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301\r\n  S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1989).Â  â€œWhile this permits us a broad\r\n  scope of review, we do not disregard the findings of the [referee], who saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility.â€Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Undue influence\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the referee erred in finding the deed was the product of undue\r\n  influence.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nGenerally,\r\n  the party attacking a deed has the burden of proof.Â  Middleton v. Suber,\r\n  300 S.C. 402, 405, 388 S.E.2d 639, 641 (1990).Â  However, the supreme court held\r\n  an inference of undue influence will arise upon a showing of great mental\r\n  weakness of the grantor and gross inadequacy of consideration.Â  Brooks v.\r\n    Kay, 339 S.C. 479, 490, 530 S.E.2d 120, 125-26 (2000).Â  The court\r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\tIt is\r\n  not necessary, in order to secure the aid of equity, to prove that the deceased\r\n  (grantor) was at the time insane, or in such a state of mental imbecility as to\r\n  render her entirely incapable of executing a valid deed. It is sufficient to\r\n  show that from her sickness and infirmities she was at the time in a condition\r\n  of great mental weakness, and that there was gross inadequacy of consideration\r\n  for the conveyance. From these circumstances imposition of undue influence will\r\n  be inferred.\r\n\r\nId. at 490, 530 S.E.2d at 125-26.Â  The court recognized\r\n  this inference applies even absent a confidential relationship.Â  Id. at 490, 530 S.E.2d at 126.\r\nThe\r\n  referee held that Nixon was either incompetent or substantially impaired due to\r\n  his advanced age and physical and mental condition at the time of the execution\r\n  of the deed.Â  Dr. N.F. Nixon, who was Nixonâ€™s nephew, treating physician, and\r\n  one of the remainder beneficiaries of his estate, testified that in late 1990\r\n  or early 1991, Gloria Perroneâ€™s daughter, Melinda Floyd, spoke to him about her\r\n  concerns that the people who were supposed to be looking after Nixon were in\r\n  fact looking out for their own interests and were getting him to sign deeds.Â \r\n  On July 10, 1991, Gloria Perrone, Â Floyd, and Dr. Nixon met with the probate\r\n  judge.Â  However, at that time they were not ready to have Nixon declared\r\n  incompetent and no action was taken.Â  \r\nDr.\r\n  Nixon stated that by the early 1990â€™s, Nixon had undergone senile dementia and\r\n  was not capable of protecting himself from people who were taking advantage of\r\n  him.Â  He described Nixonâ€™s living conditions as squalid and stated Nixon was\r\n  always on the couch reeking of urine and was unable to toilet himself.Â  Dr.\r\n  Nixon asserted Nixon would â€œsign just about anything that anyone would bring to\r\n  him, just to get away from the stress of it.â€Â  Dr. Nixon related that in 1992,\r\n  he had Nixon grant him a deed to a tract adjoining property he already owned.Â \r\n  Dr. Nixon acknowledged that although he believed C.D. Nixon knew him and agreed\r\n  to the sign the deed, he did not have the ability to not sign and that Nixon\r\n  would sign anything anyone brought him.Â  \r\nMargaret\r\n  Mullinax, who lived with Nixon from August of 1993 until his death, testified\r\n  that when she came to live with him, his entire house smelled of urine and he\r\n  had not been well taken care of by his previous caretaker.Â  She and other\r\n  family members decided to have the county nurses come to Nixonâ€™s house to check\r\n  on him regularly. Â She stated the previous caretaker took advantage of Nixon\r\n  and had him sign deeds giving her property.Â  She recalled Nixon often signed\r\n  deeds in blank and left them lying around.Â Â Â Â  \r\nCarlton\r\n  Bell, Nixonâ€™s longtime attorney, stated that after Nixon broke his arm in 1991\r\n  or 1992, his dementia progressed.Â  On December 16, 1993, when Nixon came to Bellâ€™s office to execute a deed, Bell had great concerns about Nixonâ€™s competency to\r\n  execute the deed.Â  Bell allowed Nixon to execute the deed because he believed\r\n  that if Nixon had not executed the deed, he and Nixonâ€™s other attorney in fact\r\n  could have executed it on his behalf.[2]Â  He stated he did not\r\n  want to have to tell Nixon he was incompetent when the transaction would have\r\n  happened anyway.Â Â  That was the last deed Bell helped Nixon execute. \r\nNot\r\n  long after Nixon executed the deed in the present case, he executed a deed on\r\n  November 17, 1993 reserving a life estate to himself in all of his property in Horry County and conveying the remainder to Gloria Perroneâ€™s daughters Debbie Perrone\r\n  Fowler and Melinda Perrone Fowler, a great niece Sue Nye Watson, and Margaret Mullinax.Â \r\n  This deed was subsequently set aside on the basis of undue influence.Â  Although\r\n  Bell executed several deeds during this time period that have not been set aside,\r\n  there is no evidence Skipper or Bell himself sought to set aside those deeds.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  May or June of 1994, Bell visited Nixon after receiving a call from his\r\n  caretaker, Olea Ward.Â  Bell found Nixon in an almost comatose state.Â  Bell\r\n  called Dr. Nixon and another friend of Nixon to help them. Â In September of\r\n  1994, Dr. Nixon, Gloria Perrone and other family members filed a petition for a\r\n  conservator for Nixon.Â  The probate court appointed temporary joint conservators\r\n  in October of 1994. \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the referee that Bell was in substantially weakened mental state at\r\n  the time of the execution of the deed. \r\nIn\r\n  addition, the referee held the compensation listed in the deed was grossly\r\n  inadequate.Â  There is no evidence in the record as to the exact value of the\r\n  property.Â  However, Bell testified the deed conveyed the marsh and whatever\r\n  else the East Cherry Grove Realty Company may have owned at the time of its\r\n  dissolution.Â  This included a channel lot, which Bell stated was extremely\r\n  valuable at the time of the execution of the deed.[3]Â \r\n  Â In addition, the property conveyed by the deed included land between the front\r\n  line of lots previously conveyed and the Atlantic Ocean.Â  Bell explained that\r\n  the mean high water mark had changed since the original deeds leaving up to 300\r\n  feet between the lots.Â  Nixon had seen the property as having some value and\r\n  had contacted lot owners inquiring if they wanted to expand their lots and most\r\n  of them did at some price.Â  Bell testified that according to the State of South\r\n  Carolina, the marshland was worth approximately eight hundred to a million\r\n  dollars per acre.Â  It would also be worth something to an adjoining landowner\r\n  who needed access to the channel across the property.Â  However, to someone who\r\n  does not own property there, it has no value.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  receiving the deed, the Perrones brought several actions against DHEC, the City\r\n  of North Myrtle Beach, and private parties asserting their exclusive rights to\r\n  the properties and seeking damages.Â  In an order approving plans for pursuing\r\n  real property claims by the estate of Joel Perrone, the probate court noted the\r\n  Perronesâ€™ attorney informed the court that the claims â€œcould amount to millions\r\n  of dollars in recoveries.â€Â  Thus the evidence in the record is that the\r\n  property was extremely valuable and potentially worth millions.Â  We find the\r\n  evidence supports the refereeâ€™s determination that the consideration for the\r\n  deed of $10.00 was grossly inadequate.Â  Accordingly, we hold the referee did\r\n  not err in inferring the deed was the product of undue influence.Â Â Â Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; Laches\r\nThe\r\n  Perrones argue the referee erred in failing to apply the doctrine of laches to\r\n  bar Skipperâ€™s claims.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œUnder\r\n  the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his rights, does not seasonably\r\n  assert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his adversary to incur expenses\r\n  or enter into obligations or otherwise detrimentally change his position, then\r\n  equity will ordinarily refuse to enforce those rights.â€ Chambers of S. C.,\r\n    Inc. v. County Council for Lee County, 315 S.C. 418, 421, 434 S.E.2d 279,\r\n  280 (1993). Â â€œLaches connotes not only an undue lapse of time, but also\r\n  negligence and opportunity to have acted sooner.â€ Â Id. at 421, 434 at\r\n  281. The party seeking to establish laches must show (1) delay, (2)\r\n  unreasonable delay, and (3) prejudice. Â Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C.\r\n  195, 199, 371 S.E.2d 525, 528 (1988).\r\nThe\r\n  Perrones assert the doctrine of laches should apply because this action was not\r\n  filed until almost ten years after the date of the deed.Â  They assert they were\r\n  prejudiced by the delay because by the date of the trial, Joel Perrone had\r\n  passed away, and Gloria Perrone was in such poor health that she could not testify\r\n  at trial.Â  In addition, deed witness Beverly Bell was unable to testify at\r\n  trial because of her health problems, Olea Ward passed away before the trial,\r\n  and Margaret Mullinax could not be located to testify at trial.Â  \r\nFrom the time Nixon\r\n  executed the deed until his death, he suffered from diminished mental capacity\r\n  and may not have been able to bring an action to set aside the deed.Â  Skipper\r\n  testified that he was not familiar with the deed before Nixon died and after\r\n  Nixonâ€™s death he concentrated on having another deed set aside.Â  He stated he\r\n  did not really concentrate on the present deed until he was about to close the\r\n  estate and it was brought to his attention that he should look at the deed.Â  By\r\n  then, Joel Perrone had passed away and Gloria Perrone was bedridden. We find\r\n  Skipper did not exercise unreasonable delay in bringing this action once he was\r\n  aware of the circumstances of the deed.Â  In addition, the prejudice to the\r\n  Perrones was not as great as they claim.Â Â  Although Ward, Mullinax, and Beverly\r\n  Bell were not able to testify at trial, they had previously testified in\r\n  depositions, which were presented at trial.Â Â Â  \r\nThe referee held,\r\n  â€œI see nothing in the facts of the case at bar to indicate that here, where\r\n  undue influence was used to obtain valuable property from an old, sick,\r\n  mentally weak man, the Court should exercise its discretion in favor of [the Perronesâ€™] laches defense.â€Â  This court recognized, â€œLaches is a defense in\r\n  equity, and one who comes to the court seeking equity must come with clean\r\n  hands.â€ Â Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 220, 603 S.E.2d 598, 605 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004).\r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling on this issue.Â  \r\n3.&nbsp; Waiver\r\nThe\r\n  Perrones argue the referee erred in failing to apply the doctrine of waiver to\r\n  bar Skipperâ€™s claim.Â  They assert that Nixon intentionally abandoned and waived\r\n  a claim to set aside the deed by taking no action after telling Bell that he\r\n  wanted to have the deed set aside.Â  We disagree.\r\nWaiver\r\n  is a voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a known right.Â  Strickland v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 85, 650 S.E.2d 465, 470 (2007).Â \r\n  It may be expressed or implied by a partyâ€™s conduct.Â  Parker v. Parker,\r\n  313 S.C. 482, 487, 443 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1994).\r\nAt\r\n  the time Nixon discussed setting aside the deed with Bell, he was greatly\r\n  infirmed.Â  Bell, who was his long-time attorney, advised him that he would have\r\n  to seek another attorney to represent him as Bell would most likely have to\r\n  appear as a witness in an action to set aside the deed.Â  We find Nixon did not\r\n  intentionally abandon the claim by not trying to find another attorney, given\r\n  his mental condition.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the\r\n  foregoing reasons, the decision of the master is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON,\r\n  HUFF, and THOMAS, JJ. concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Nixon left an unwitnessed memorandum to his will\r\n  dated September 27, 1993 which provided:\r\n\r\n\tRecent\r\n  events and statements made by several of my family members wherein they\r\n  indicated that they might contest my Will or bring other actions against my\r\n  Estate or Personal Representatives prompts me to issue this memorandum and ask\r\n  that any court deny and reject such claims and that they receive no share of my\r\n  Estate.\r\n\r\n[2] Unknown to Bell, the power of attorney naming Bell and Olea Ward as attorneys in fact was revoked on October 27, 1993.Â  \r\n[3] Bell had handled transactions for similar lots and\r\n  was familiar with their value. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4490","title":"Widener v.

Jackson Kimball, III, Master In Equity\r\nOpinion No. 4490\r\nHeard December 3, 2008 â€“ Filed January 27,\r\n  2009Â Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tMitchell K. Byrd, Sr., of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tRonald J. Tryon and J. Drayton Hastie,\r\n  III, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, A.J.: David J. Widener brought this action against Fort\r\n  Mill Ford and WFS Financial (WFS) alleging violations of the South Carolina\r\n  Regulation of Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers Act, sections 56-15-10\r\n  to -600 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) (the Dealers Act), and the\r\n  Unfair Trade Practices Act, sections 39-5-10 to -560 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  In response, Fort Mill Ford moved to dismiss or stay the\r\n  proceedings and to compel arbitration.Â  After a hearing, the trial court\r\n  dismissed the action, holding â€œ[t]he arbitration agreement is enforceable by\r\n  [Fort Mill Ford and WFS] pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act as to the\r\n  claims asserted by [Widener] in this litigation.â€Â  Widener appeals.Â  We reverse\r\n  and remand. \r\nI.&nbsp; APPEALABILITY\r\nWidener argues the trial courtâ€™s order dismissing his\r\n  action is immediately appealable.Â  Fort Mill Ford contends the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  order is not appealable, citing section 15-48-200 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2007) and Carolina Care Plan, Inc. v. United HealthCare Services,\r\n    Inc., 361 S.C. 544, 558, 606 S.E.2d 752, 759&nbsp;(2004).\r\nSouth Carolina courts\r\n  have not specifically addressed the issue of whether an order dismissing an\r\n  action without prejudice and allowing the parties to pursue arbitration is\r\n  immediately appealable.Â  The United States Supreme Court addressed a similar\r\n  issue in Green Tree Financial Corp.-Alabama v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79\r\n  (2000).Â  The court held an order dismissing an action with prejudice and directing\r\n  that the dispute be resolved by arbitration is final and immediately\r\n  appealable.Â  Id. at 86-87.Â  The court added, â€œHad the District Court\r\n  entered a stay instead of a dismissal in this case, that order would not be\r\n  appealable.â€Â  Id. at 87 n.2.Â  Further, both the Second Circuit and the\r\n  Ninth Circuit have held that orders dismissing actions without prejudice and\r\n  compelling arbitration are immediately appealable.Â  See Salim\r\n    Oleochemicals v. M/V Shropshire, 278 F.3d 90, 93&nbsp;(2d Cir. 2002); Interactive\r\n      Flight Techs., Inc. v. Swissair Swiss Air Transport Co., Ltd., 249 F.3d\r\n  1177, 1179 (9th Cir. 2001).\r\nWe therefore hold the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\n  immediately appealable.Â  \r\nFort Mill Fordâ€™s reliance on section 15-48-200 is misplaced.Â \r\n  Although section 15-48-200 does not include an order dismissing an action among\r\n  a list of orders from which an appeal may be taken in arbitration cases, this\r\n  section does not preclude the order in this case from being immediately\r\n  appealable.Â  By dismissing Widenerâ€™s action, the court finally determined the\r\n  rights of the parties; therefore, we have jurisdiction pursuant to section\r\n  14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nFurther, this case is distinguishable from Carolina\r\n  Care Plan.Â  In Carolina Care Plan, our supreme court held an order\r\n  compelling arbitration and staying the remaining claims is not immediately\r\n  appealable.Â  361 S.C. at 558, 606 S.E.2d at 759.&nbsp; Here, however, the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s order did not stay the action pending arbitration.Â  Instead, trial\r\n  court dismissed the action, stating, â€œIt is further ordered that this\r\n  action be dismissed without prejudice to the right of any party to seek such\r\n  relief as may be available to enforce, modify, or vacate any arbitration\r\n  decision as permitted by statute.â€ \r\nII.&nbsp; DISMISSALÂ \r\n  Â Â Â Â \r\nWidener argues the trial court erred in dismissing his\r\n  action.Â  He asserts the dismissal prejudices him because any future action will\r\n  be barred by the statute of limitations.Â  We agree.\r\nAlthough South Carolina courts have not addressed this\r\n  issue, the Alabama Supreme Court dealt with a similar situation in Johnson\r\n    v. Jefferson County Racing Assâ€™n, 2008 WL 2554013, 7 (Ala. 2008).Â  The Johnson court pointed to the following discussion, which appears in Porter v.\r\n      Colonial Life &amp; Accident Insurance Co., 828 So. 2d 907, 908 (Ala. 2002):\r\n\r\n\tâ€œWe note a potential for injustice. If a plaintiffâ€™s\r\n  court action be dismissed to enforce an arbitration agreement, but, through no\r\n  fault of the plaintiffâ€™s, the arbitration be not concluded or some of the\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s claims be not arbitrated, a statute of limitations could bar a\r\n  refiling of the unarbitrated claims in court.Â  Sometimes, for instance, an\r\n  arbitratorâ€™s first duty under an arbitration agreement is to determine the\r\n  arbitrability of a plaintiffâ€™s claims. In such a case, the arbitrator could\r\n  rule that some or all of the plaintiffâ€™s claims should be litigated and not\r\n  arbitrated. Moreover, a stay, as distinguished from a dismissal, would likely\r\n  better conserve the time and resources of the parties and the trial court even\r\n  in the event of a successful arbitration, inasmuch as the winner commonly wants\r\n  the arbitration award reduced to a judgment.â€ \r\n\r\nHere, as in Johnson, there is a potential the\r\n  statute of limitations could bar refiling of any unarbitrated claims in court.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-5-150 &amp; 56-15-120 (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the decision of the trial\r\n  court and remand this case for the trial court to vacate its dismissal of\r\n  Widenerâ€™s claims and to enter an order staying his action pending the outcome\r\n  of the arbitration proceedings.\r\nIII.&nbsp; ARBITRATION\r\nWidener argues the trial court erred in concluding his\r\n  causes of action are subject to arbitration.Â  We do not reach this issue\r\n  because we are reversing and remanding this case for the trial court to stay\r\n  this action pending arbitration.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nSHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4491","title":"Payne v.

Fender, Family Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4491\r\nHeard November 6, 2008 â€“ Filed January 27,\r\n  2009Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDouglas Kosta Kotti, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tPamela Michele Pearson, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Sherry Ann Payne (Mother) appeals from a family court\r\n  order transferring custody of her minor son, Joshua Michael Payne, to William\r\n  John Payne (Father).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMother\r\n  and Father separated in 1996 after four years of marriage; however, they did\r\n  not divorce until 2001.Â  The coupleâ€™s son, Joshua, was one year old at the\r\n  time.Â  During the separation and following the divorce proceedings, Mother was\r\n  awarded primary custody of Joshua.Â  Father was given supervised visitation\r\n  until Joshuaâ€™s sixth birthday, at which point Father began a two-year gradual\r\n  introduction to â€œstandard [unsupervised] visitation.â€Â  This phased-in custody\r\n  arrangement was the result of Fatherâ€™s status as a convicted sex offender, per\r\n  a 1989 Criminal Sexual Conduct (CSC) conviction, and Motherâ€™s allegations of\r\n  domestic violence by Father directed toward herself and Joshua during the\r\n  separation and pendency of the divorce proceedings.Â  Father remarried later in\r\n  2001, and ultimately began having unsupervised visitation.Â  \r\nIn October of 2004, both parents were named as\r\n  defendants in a South Carolina Department of Social Services action stemming\r\n  from allegations made by Joshuaâ€™s pediatrician, Dr. Deanna Threatt.Â  Threatt\r\n  expressed concern that Joshuaâ€™s frequent hospitalization and illnesses may be a\r\n  form of child abuse, and after consulting with other doctors in her practice\r\n  group, diagnosed Mother with Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy.Â  DSS was notified\r\n  and the police were called.Â  At the probable cause hearing, temporary custody\r\n  was initially given to maternal grandmother.Â  Following DSS in-home evaluations\r\n  of both Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s homes, temporary custody was awarded to Father\r\n  for the pendency of the DSS case.Â  Ultimately, the court found Joshua was not\r\n  abused and returned custody to Mother.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  2005, Father filed an action seeking modification of the family courtâ€™s custody\r\n  order in light of the DSS incident.Â  In her answer and counterclaim, Mother\r\n  requested that:Â  (1) Fatherâ€™s visitation be reduced to supervised or restricted\r\n  visits; (2) the action be dismissed; (3) the parties be permitted to engage in\r\n  discovery; and (4) Father pay her attorney fees and costs.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  a trial, the family court issued a final order that, in relevant part,\r\n  transferred custody of Joshua to Father as well as set a visitation schedule\r\n  for Mother.Â  At the same time, Motherâ€™s counsel withdrew his representation.Â Â Â  \r\nShortly thereafter, Motherâ€™s new attorney filed a\r\n  â€œmotion to reconsider with exceptions,â€ which was denied.Â  Because no one had\r\n  notified the clerk of courtâ€™s office that Motherâ€™s previous attorney no longer\r\n  represented her, neither Mother, nor her new attorney, received the written\r\n  order until January 29, 2007.Â Mother filed a pro se notice of\r\n  appeal on February 26, 2007.Â  \r\nOn March 14, 2007 Fatherâ€™s attorney moved to dismiss\r\n  the appeal as untimely.Â  Following Fatherâ€™s motion, both Motherâ€™s former\r\n  attorney and Motherâ€™s attorney for the post-trial motion petitioned this court\r\n  to be relieved as counsel of record for Mother.Â  Mother consented to the\r\n  motions, and on the same day, Motherâ€™s current attorney filed a notice of representation.Â \r\n  Fatherâ€™s motion to dismiss the appeal was denied, but the parties were directed\r\n  to address the issue of timeliness in their briefs.Â  Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from the family\r\n  court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi,\r\n  364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Emery v.\r\n    Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 213, 603 S.E.2d 598, 601 (Ct. App. 2004)).Â  However,\r\n  this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s\r\n  findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Neither is the appellate court required to ignore the fact\r\n  that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position\r\n  to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\n  testimony.Â  Latimer v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 380, 602 S.E.2d 32,\r\n  34&nbsp;(2004); Holler v. Holler, 364 S.C. 256, 261, 612 S.E.2d 469,\r\n  472&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  Because the family court is in a superior position\r\n  to judge the witness demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad\r\n  discretion.Â  Durlach v. Durlach, 359 S.C. 64, 70, 596 S.E.2d 908,\r\n  912&nbsp;(2004); Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 211-12, 634 S.E.2d 51, 54\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; The Modification Order\r\nâ€œ[W]hen a non-custodial parent seeks a change in\r\n  custody, the non-custodial parent must establish the following: (1) there has\r\n  been a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child\r\n  and (2) a change in custody is in the overall best interests of the child.â€Â  Latimer\r\n    v. Farmer, 360 S.C. 375, 381, 602 S.E.2d 32, 35 (2004).Â  At trial, Father\r\n  successfully argued both prongs of Latimer and asks this court to affirm\r\n  the family courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nOn appeal, Mother argues the family court erred in\r\n  granting Fatherâ€™s request for modification of the custody order for the\r\n  following reasons:Â  (1) failure to properly consider Fatherâ€™s status as a\r\n  convicted sex offender; (2) failure to properly apply the doctrine of issue\r\n  preclusion; (3) failure to comply with the childâ€™s preference regarding\r\n  custody; and (4) failure to comply with the Private Guardian Ad Litem Reform\r\n  Act barring the guardian from making a custody recommendation unless requested\r\n  by the court for reasons specified in the record.Â  She also asserts the family\r\n  court erred in requiring her to pay one-half of the GAL fees.Â  We disagree and\r\n  affirm. \r\nA.&nbsp; Fatherâ€™s Status as a Convicted\r\n  Sex Offender\r\nMother argues the family court erred by failing to\r\n  give adequate consideration to Fatherâ€™s sex offender status.Â  Mother points to\r\n  section 20-7-1530(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007) as requiring the\r\n  family court to consider Fatherâ€™s sex offender status with respect to custody.Â \r\n  While Mother is correct insofar as Â§ 20-7-1530(A) requires the court to give\r\n  weight to â€œsexual abuseâ€ in determining the best interest of the child, other\r\n  relevant factors must also be considered.Â  See Pountain v. Pountain,\r\n  332 S.C. 130, 136, 503 S.E.2d 757, 760 (Ct. App. 1998) (stating that when\r\n  determining the best interests of the child, the family court should consider\r\n  how the custody decision will impact all areas of the childâ€™s life, including physical,\r\n  psychological, spiritual, educational, familial, emotional, and recreational\r\n  aspects).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  the family court was well aware of Fatherâ€™s sex offender status but simply\r\n  declined to give it the weight desired by Mother.Â  On direct examination,\r\n  Father was questioned by his counsel regarding the circumstances of his CSC\r\n  conviction.Â  Father testified concerning the counseling and other remedial\r\n  measures required of him as a result of his CSC conviction.Â  During Fatherâ€™s\r\n  cross examination on this issue, the family court stated, â€œI want to know the\r\n  relevance of this . . . theyâ€™ve been in court many, many times and I know\r\n  thatâ€™s a fact; Iâ€™ve got all this in evidence, and . . . I just donâ€™t think\r\n  thatâ€™s very relevant to this case.â€Â  Thus, there is no question the family\r\n  court judge was aware of Fatherâ€™s 1989 CSC conviction.Â Â Â  \r\nThe family court based its custody decision primarily\r\n  upon Motherâ€™s emotional and physical abuse of Joshua as testified to by Dr.\r\n  Threatt, including, â€œnumerous unnecessary [medical] procedures and\r\n  hospitalizations.â€Â  The court also relied on the testimony of Dr. Robert\r\n  Noelker, who, in addition to expressing concerns over Motherâ€™s serious\r\n  personality disorder and its effect on Motherâ€™s ability to parent, believed\r\n  Father would provide Joshua a better home environment.Â  Dr. Noelker also noted\r\n  that due to the nature of Motherâ€™s personality disorder, extensive, long-term\r\n  treatment, including the use of psychotropic medications, would be required to\r\n  effectively treat her.Â  Noelker additionally found Father was, â€œan excellent\r\n  role model,â€ and there were no current issues which would affect his ability to\r\n  parent.Â Â  \r\nThe Guardian ad Litem (GAL), Dr. Jane Rankin, echoed\r\n  Noelkerâ€™s statements regarding custody and testified Father was an involved\r\n  parent who spent much time with Joshua.Â  Rankin found Joshua to be â€œmore\r\n  relaxedâ€ and â€œmore independentâ€ while in Fatherâ€™s custody during the DSS\r\n  action.Â  Additionally, Rankin reported Joshua was â€œtenseâ€ and â€œshyâ€ upon\r\n  returning to Motherâ€™s custody following termination of the DSS action. \r\nThe family courtâ€™s custody decision was further\r\n  supported by Joshuaâ€™s principal, who testified Joshua missed approximately\r\n  thirty days of school from the beginning of school until late October, while in\r\n  Motherâ€™s custody, and only one day of school after custody was transferred to\r\n  Father during the DSS action.Â  She further noted that Joshua seemed â€œmore\r\n  relaxed and outgoingâ€ when Father had primary custody.\r\nB.&nbsp; Issue Preclusion/ Collateral Estoppel\r\nMother also argues Fatherâ€™s custody modification\r\n  action was precluded by the ruling in the prior DSS case, and therefore,\r\n  maintains the family court erred in not dismissing the action.Â  We disagree.\r\nAccording to our supreme court, issue preclusion, also\r\n  known as collateral estoppel, occurs when the party in a second action is\r\n  precluded from re-litigating an issue which was decided in a previous action.Â  Zurcher\r\n    v. Bilton, 379 S.C. 132, 135-36, 666 S.E.2d 224, 226 (2008) (stating an issue litigated and determined by a valid and final\r\n  judgment is conclusive in a subsequent action whether on the same or a\r\n  different claim).Â  In order to successfully\r\n  assert issue preclusion, a party must show the issue was actually litigated and\r\n  directly determined in the prior action, and that the matter or fact directly\r\n  in issue was necessary to support the first judgment.Â  Plott v.\r\n    Justin Enters., 374 S.C. 504, 513, 649 S.E.2d 92, 96 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (citing Town of Sullivanâ€™s Island v. Felger, 318 S.C. 340, 344, 457\r\n  S.E.2d 626, 628 (1995)).\r\nMother mischaracterizes the issue before the family\r\n  court in the DSS action as a custody action.Â  While it is true that custody was\r\n  transferred to Father during the pendency of the DSS hearings, the issue in the\r\n  DSS action was whether Mother abused or neglected Joshua.Â  By comparison, the\r\n  issue before the family court in the custody modification action was whether a\r\n  substantial change affecting the welfare of the child had occurred and whether\r\n  a change in custody would serve the best interests of the child.Â  As the issue\r\n  of custody between Mother and Father was neither litigated nor directly\r\n  determined in the DSS action, we affirm as to this issue.Â  \r\nC.Â  Consideration of Joshuaâ€™s\r\n  Preference Regarding Custody\r\nMother further argues Joshuaâ€™s preference was not\r\n  given sufficient weight by the family court.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen determining issues of custody, â€œthe court should\r\n  consider all the circumstances of the particular case and all relevant factors\r\n  must be taken into consideration.â€Â  Pirayesh v. Pirayesh, 359 S.C. 284,\r\n  296, 596 S.E.2d 505, 512 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  While the childâ€™s reasonable\r\n  preference is a factor in considering the best interest of the child, it is not\r\n  controlling.Â  Brown v. Brown, 362 S.C. 85, 96, 606 S.E.2d 785, 791 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2004). Â Additionally, the trial court is required to, â€œplace weight upon\r\n  the preference based upon the childâ€™s age, experience, maturity, judgment, and\r\n  ability to express a preference.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1515 (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  not expressing an outright preference, Joshua stated that â€œhe wanted things to\r\n  stay the way they were.â€Â  The family court acknowledged Joshuaâ€™s preference in\r\n  the final order, but clearly took other factors, such as Motherâ€™s emotional\r\n  condition and its impact upon Joshua, into consideration in its decision to\r\n  modify the custody arrangement.Â  Accordingly, we do not believe the family\r\n  court erred in failing to give Joshuaâ€™s preference controlling weight.\r\nD.Â  The Private Guardian Ad Litem\r\n  Reform Act\r\nMother next asserts the family court erred by failing\r\n  to set forth in the record the specific grounds for requesting the GALâ€™s\r\n  custody recommendation, as required by the Private Guardian Ad Litem Reform\r\n  Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1549(6) (Supp. 2007).Â \r\n  Mother argues that, as a result of failing to give reasons for accepting the\r\n  GAL custody recommendation, the GAL usurped the trial courtâ€™s role as a\r\n  decision maker.Â  Here, Mother did not object when the GAL gave her\r\n  recommendation; therefore, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â \r\n  To be preserved for appellate review, an issue must have been raised to and\r\n  ruled upon by the trial judge.Â  Issues not raised and ruled upon in the trial\r\n  court will not be considered on appeal.Â  S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp. v. First\r\n    Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 301-02, 641 S.E.2d 903, 907 (2007).Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; The GAL Fees\r\nFinally, Mother argues the family court erred in its\r\n  division of the GAL fees.Â  Additionally, Mother argues, â€œthere is no recorded\r\n  order appointing the [GAL] and no recorded order setting her fee rate or an\r\n  initial authorization of her fees.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina law provides that the family court should review the\r\n  following factors when awarding GAL fees:\r\n\r\n\t(1) the complexity of the issues before\r\n  the court; (2) the contentiousness of the litigation; (3) the time expended by\r\n  the guardian; (4) the expenses reasonably incurred by the guardian; (5) the\r\n  financial ability of each party to pay fees and costs; and (6) any other\r\n  factors the court considers necessary.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1553(B) (Supp. 2007).\r\nâ€œAn award of GAL fees lies within the\r\n  sound discretion of the [family court] and will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 341,\r\n  536 S.E.2d 427, 436 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The trial court abuses its discretion\r\n  when a decision is based upon an error of law or upon factual findings that are\r\n  without evidentiary support.Â  State v. Morris, 376 S.C. 189, 206, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 359, 368 (2008).Â  \r\nAfter reviewing the GALâ€™s time expenditure\r\n  and her hourly rate, the family court found the GAL competently\r\n  performed her services and was entitled to payment of her fees and expenses in\r\n  the amount of $3,773.Â  This was consistent with a July 29, 2005, order that\r\n  appointed Dr. Rankin, set her hourly rate, and determined that each party would\r\n  share equal responsibility for the balance of the fees owed to the guardian.Â \r\n  Consequently, the family court did not abuse its discretion by splitting the\r\n  guardian fees between the parties. \r\nThe ruling of the family court is\r\n  accordingly \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4492","title":"State v.

trial for murder before Judge Hayes.Â  The jury\r\n  twice reported to Judge Hayes its inability to reach a unanimous verdict.Â \r\n  Judge Hayes granted Parkerâ€™s motion for a mistrial.Â  When Parker was tried\r\n  again in 2005 before Judge Few, he moved to dismiss based on double jeopardy.Â \r\n  Judge Few denied the motion and the jury convicted Parker of murder.Â  Parker\r\n  appeals his murder conviction arguing Judge Few erred in denying his motion to\r\n  dismiss based on double jeopardy.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nParker shot and killed Robert Lee Stewart.Â  Stewart had an\r\n  extensive violent criminal background and a history of abusive behavior toward\r\n  Parkerâ€™s sister, Angela.Â  The police and emergency medical technicians\r\n  responded to a call to Angelaâ€™s motherâ€™s house after Angela was beaten by\r\n  Stewart.Â  The following day, Stewart and four or five others arrived at\r\n  Angelaâ€™s motherâ€™s house.Â  Parker lived next door to Angelaâ€™s mother.Â  Parker\r\n  shot Stewart multiple times in the driveway.Â  At trial, Parker claimed\r\n  self-defense, testifying he feared for his life as Stewart was pulling\r\n  something from his back pocket and from the back of the truck.Â  Police officer\r\n  Wayne Campbell testified an open knife was found in the victimâ€™s back pocket at\r\n  the scene.Â  \r\nDuring the first trial, there was a significant amount of\r\n  animosity between the solicitor and defense counsel, appearing in the record as\r\n  early as pre-trial motions and continuing throughout the proceedings.Â  Prior to\r\n  questioning the first police witness, the solicitor explained to the court that\r\n  there was a videotape made of the crime scene that included graphic footage of\r\n  the victimâ€™s body.Â  The solicitor redacted that footage and presented defense\r\n  counsel with the redacted copy on the day of trial.Â  The original videotape,\r\n  however, was shown to the jury.Â  The solicitor claimed it was unintentional.Â \r\n  Defense counsel moved for a mistrial and dismissal with prejudice based on\r\n  prosecutorial misconduct.Â  He argued the solicitorâ€™s case was not going well\r\n  and the State was now privy to his defense tactics.Â  The solicitor argued she\r\n  did not know how the tapes were switched and there was no intention on her part\r\n  to force a mistrial.Â  The court admonished the solicitor, but denied the motion\r\n  for a mistrial.Â  \r\nAt the end of the Stateâ€™s case, Parker moved for a directed\r\n  verdict.Â  The court denied the motion finding that although the Stateâ€™s case\r\n  had many lapses in evidence, there was sufficient evidence to present the case\r\n  to the jury.Â  Parker testified he acted in self-defense.Â  The trial court\r\n  denied Parkerâ€™s renewed motions for directed verdict and mistrial.Â  The court\r\n  also prohibited the State from sending the videotape and a diagram of the body\r\n  depicting the victimâ€™s wounds to the jury room. \r\nAfter the solicitorâ€™s closing argument, Parker again moved for a\r\n  mistrial.Â  The court charged the jury and then heard arguments on the motion.Â \r\n  Parkerâ€™s counsel argued that many times during the trial, the solicitor accused\r\n  him of unethical conduct, badgered witnesses to concede they were merely\r\n  testifying as directed to by Parkerâ€™s counsel, and stated several times in\r\n  closing arguments that Parkerâ€™s counsel had coached the defense witnesses.Â  He\r\n  further argued the solicitor improperly relied on numerous facts that were not\r\n  in the record and implied to the jury it was their community duty to convict\r\n  Parker of murder.Â  He finally argued the cumulative effect of the prosecutorial\r\n  misconduct warranted a mistrial.Â  \r\nPrior to a ruling on the motion, the jury reported to the judge it\r\n  was deadlocked.Â  The judge gave an Allen charge.Â  After further\r\n  deliberation, the jury again reported it was deadlocked.Â  The judge considered\r\n  the motion for a mistrial.Â  The judge stated he had reviewed the motion for a\r\n  mistrial, the solicitorâ€™s closing argument, and his notes from the testimony.Â \r\n  The judge found the solicitorâ€™s comments during closing argument were improper,\r\n  constituted prosecutorial misconduct, and were alone sufficient to warrant a\r\n  mistrial.Â  The judge also found the attacks on Parkerâ€™s counsel, the imposition\r\n  of the burden on the jury to convict in order to protect the community, and the\r\n  videotape warranted a mistrial.Â  The court stated:Â  â€œIn my readings of those\r\n  opinions itâ€™s almost as if . . . this court can infer that the defendant was\r\n  almost goaded into the position of asking for the mistrial.Â  So based on the\r\n  totality of the circumstances that [have] occurred in this trial . . . I will\r\n  declare a mistrial.â€\r\nThe court ultimately based the mistrial on the cumulative effects\r\n  of the misconduct.Â  The State moved for a clarification of Judge Hayesâ€™ order,\r\n  requesting a finding as to whether the mistrial was granted based on\r\n  prosecutorial misconduct that was intended to: â€œ(a) subvert the protections\r\n  afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause, (b) goad or provoke the defense into\r\n  moving for a mistrial or (c) terminate the trial.â€Â  By letter, Judge Hayes\r\n  responded he had reviewed the transcript and his notes and concluded:Â  â€œNowhere\r\n  do I find that this Court was ever asked to rule on the granting of a new trial\r\n  nor asked about the issue of jeopardy.â€Â  The State appealed and this court\r\n  dismissed it as not immediately appealable.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The\r\n  State tried Parker again. Â Parker moved to dismiss based on double\r\n  jeopardy arguing the solicitor at the first trial intentionally goaded him into\r\n  moving for a mistrial.Â  Judge Few denied the motion to dismiss stating: Â â€œ[R]egardless\r\n  of my analysis of what happened in the first trial, this motion to dismiss is\r\n  denied because it was the juryâ€™s being deadlocked that [led] to the manifest\r\n  necessity that [led] to the mistrial.â€Â  Judge Few then stated he had analyzed\r\n  the case and reviewed the transcript.Â  Judge Few concluded the solicitor had\r\n  not intentionally goaded the defense into moving for a mistrial.Â  The second\r\n  trial proceeded and the jury convicted Parker of murder.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nParker argues the trial court in the second trial\r\n  erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy.Â  Parker argues\r\n  the solicitorâ€™s conduct, including showing the jury the videotape of the\r\n  victimâ€™s body and implying the defense counsel coached the witnesses during her\r\n  closing arguments, was intended to goad him into moving for a mistrial.Â  We\r\n  find no reversible error.\r\nThe\r\n  Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions\r\n  protect citizens from being twice placed in jeopardy of life or liberty.Â  See U.S. Const. amend. V (â€œNo person shall be . . . subject for the same offen[s]e\r\n  to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .â€); S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 12\r\n  (â€œNo person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy\r\n  of life or liberty . . . .â€).Â  â€œUnder the law of double jeopardy, a defendant\r\n  may not be prosecuted for the same offense after an acquittal, a conviction, or\r\n  an improvidently granted mistrial.â€Â  State v. Coleman, 365 S.C. 258,\r\n  262-63, 616 S.E.2d 444, 446-47&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).\r\nA\r\n  defendant who has moved for and been granted a mistrial based on prosecutorial\r\n  misconduct may successfully invoke the Double Jeopardy Clause to prevent a\r\n  second prosecution when the prosecutorâ€™s conduct giving rise to the mistrial was\r\n  intended to â€œgoadâ€ or provoke the defendant into moving for the mistrial.Â  Oregon\r\n    v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 676 (1982); State v. Mathis, 359 S.C. 450,\r\n  460, 597 S.E.2d 872, 877 (Ct. App. 2004) (applying same standard in South Carolina).\r\nThus,\r\n  the determination of whether double jeopardy attaches depends upon whether the\r\n  prosecutorial misconduct was undertaken with the intent to subvert the rights\r\n  protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.Â  Coleman, 365 S.C. at 263, 616\r\n  S.E.2d at 447.Â  â€œThe trial courtâ€™s finding concerning the prosecutorâ€™s intent\r\n  is a factual one and will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly\r\n  erroneous.â€Â  Id.; see also Mathis, 359 S.C. at 460-61, 597\r\n  S.E.2d at 877-78 (stating deference should be given to the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  determination of the existence of the prosecutorâ€™s intent). \r\nWe first must pay\r\n  deference to Judge Hayesâ€™ letter indicating he did not rule on the jeopardy\r\n  issue in granting the motion for a mistrial at the end of the first trial.Â  At\r\n  the second trial, Judge Few first denied the motion to dismiss based on the\r\n  jury deadlock.Â  We need not address this issue as we are restricted in our\r\n  review of his further factual finding that the\r\n  solicitor had not intentionally goaded the defense into moving for a mistrial.Â \r\n  We find support in the record to affirm the finding that the solicitor did not\r\n  intentionally goad Parker into moving for a mistrial.Â  Accordingly, the trial\r\n  court did not err in denying the motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy. \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\n  KONDUROS, J., concur. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4493","title":"Mazloom v.

Secretary-Treasurer.[1]Â Â Â  \r\nIraj\r\n  worked as an employee of AMBI from 1980 until 1996.Â  In October 1996, Ahmad\r\n  sent a letter to Iraj informing him of an upcoming corporate meeting.Â  During\r\n  the meeting, a majority of the shareholders voted to remove Iraj from his\r\n  position as Secretary-Treasurer of AMBI.Â  His employment was also terminated\r\n  immediately.Â  Iraj was thereafter excluded from participating in the business.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  July 13, 2000, Articles of Dissolution were filed for AMBI.Â  Iraj did not know\r\n  about or participate in the vote for dissolution, and only the names of Ahmad,\r\n  Manooch, and Aboli appeared on the papers as directors and officers of AMBI.Â \r\n  On this same day, Ahmad, Manooch, and Aboli filed Articles of Organization for AMA.Â \r\n  AMBI's real estate was eventually transferred to AMA for the sum of five\r\n  dollars.Â  Iraj, likewise, did not know about or participate in this transfer.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  September 2002, Iraj contacted an attorney, Franchot Brown (Brown), to help him\r\n  clarify his interest in AMA.Â  Brown prepared Articles of Amendment for AMA,\r\n  which were signed by Manooch and Aboli and filed with the Secretary of State in\r\n  November 2002.[2]Â \r\n  The Articles of Amendment stated that upon AMBI's dissolution, AMA received all\r\n  of AMBI's assets and good will and that AMBI shareholders were to retain their\r\n  respective shares of stock in AMA as they had in AMBI.Â  The Articles went on to\r\n  state:\r\n\r\n  That in\r\n    the organization of AMA, LLC through inadvertence or mistake, Iraj Mazloom was\r\n    not transferred over as a shareholder of stock from AMBI, Inc. to AMA, LLC\r\n    which would have been correct, proper and was the intent of the original\r\n    shareholders.Â  \r\n  That\r\n    this amendment is to correct this error and respectfully acknowledge that Iraj\r\n    Mazloom owns 25% (or 1/4) shares of stock in AMA, LLC.Â  That Iraj Mazloom shall\r\n    be acknowledged by [AMA] as a 25% holder of shares in [AMA] and that this\r\n    amendment shall be filed with the South Carolina Secretary of State as evidence\r\n    that Iraj Mazloom . . . owns 25% of all shares issued by AMA, LLC.\r\n\r\nIn January 2003,\r\n  after the Articles of Amendment were filed, Ahmad sold his interest in AMA to\r\n  Manooch and Aboli for $120,000.Â  The bill of sale stated Ahmad held a 1/3\r\n  interest in AMA while Manooch and Aboli owned equal parts of the remaining 2/3\r\n  interest.Â  Iraj was not given notice of this sale or an opportunity to\r\n  participate and purchase any of Ahmad's interest.Â  \r\nIn May 2003,\r\n  Manooch and Aboli, on behalf of AMA, entered into a contract with Ganesh Mini\r\n  Mart, LLC (Ganesh) to sell all of AMA's assets, including the Mini Mart, the\r\n  ABC liquor store, and the one-bedroom apartment, as well as any inventory,\r\n  furniture, fixtures, and equipment located therein.Â  The purchase price was\r\n  $345,000.Â  Again, Iraj did not know about or participate in this transfer, and\r\n  he did not receive any share of the sale proceeds.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIraj originally\r\n  filed a summons and complaint against Manooch and Aboli (hereinafter\r\n  collectively referred to as &quot;the brothers&quot;) in July 2004.Â  The\r\n  complaint was subsequently amended and filed in August 2005, asserting claims\r\n  for an accounting, judicial dissolution or repurchase due to oppression, breach\r\n  of fiduciary duty of care and loyalty, and breach of good faith and fair\r\n  dealing.Â  The brothers answered the complaint with defenses and counterclaims.Â \r\n  As part of their defense of equitable estoppel, the brothers alleged that at\r\n  the time AMBI transferred its assets to AMA, Iraj did not have any shares in\r\n  AMBI because he had assigned his shares and interest to a third party nearly\r\n  twenty years prior.Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  matter was referred to the Master-in-Equity in January 2006 and came to trial\r\n  in September of that year.Â  The master found Iraj owned a 25% interest in AMA\r\n  and awarded him $91,031.28 from the sale of AMA's assets and $70,200.75 from\r\n  unpaid cash distributions.Â  Additionally, the master awarded Iraj punitive\r\n  damages of $25,000 against each brother, for a total of $50,000.Â  A motion to\r\n  alter, amend, and reconsider was filed by the brothers, but the master denied\r\n  the motion.Â  This appeal follows.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;When legal\r\n  and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, each retains its own identity\r\n  as legal or equitable for purposes of the applicable standard of review on\r\n  appeal.&quot;Â  Corley v. Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 92 n.1, 485 S.E.2d 97, 99 n.1\r\n  (1997).Â  The reviewing court should &quot;view the actions separately for the\r\n  purpose of determining the appropriate standard of review.&quot;Â  Jordan v. Holt, 362 S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d 129, 131 (2005).Â  In an action\r\n  in equity, tried by the judge alone, without a reference, the appellate court\r\n  has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C.\r\n  81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  On the other hand, when reviewing an\r\n  action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the appellate court's\r\n  jurisdiction is limited to correction of errors at law, and the appellate court\r\n  will not disturb the judge's findings of fact as long as they are reasonably\r\n  supported by the evidence.Â  Epworth Children's Home v. Beasley, 365 S.C.\r\n  157, 164, 616 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Actions for Corporate\r\n  Dissolution and an Accounting\r\nThe brothers first\r\n  argue the master erred in finding Iraj held a 25% ownership interest in AMA.Â \r\n  Specifically, the brothers argue all the probative evidence of record\r\n  establishes Iraj transferred his 25% interest in AMBI to Shahin Mazloom (Niece),\r\n  a niece of Iraj, Ahmad, Manooch, and Aboli, in 1985, and therefore, he had no\r\n  claim to any ownership interest in AMA, the successor in interest to AMBI.Â  We\r\n  disagree, finding the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates Iraj retained\r\n  his 25% ownership interest in AMBI. \r\nAn\r\n  action for corporate dissolution is an action in equity, as is an action for an\r\n  accounting.Â  Keane v. Lowcountry Pediatrics, P.A., 372 S.C. 136, 142,\r\n  641 S.E.2d 53, 57 (Ct. App. 2007); see Lee v. Lee, 251 S.C. 533,\r\n  535, 164 S.E.2d 308, 308-09 (1968) (holding an action for an accounting is\r\n  equitable).Â  This Court may, therefore, find facts in accordance with its own\r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Keane, 372 S.C. at 143, 641\r\n  S.E.2d at 57.Â  We need not, however, &quot;disregard the findings of the master\r\n  who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility.&quot;Â  Peoples Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Myrtle Beach Golf\r\n    &amp; Yacht Club, 310 S.C. 132, 140, 425 S.E.2d 764, 769 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nIt is undisputed\r\n  that when AMBI was incorporated, Iraj held a 25% ownership interest in the\r\n  corporation.Â  The brothers alleged, however, that in October 1985, Iraj\r\n  conveyed his interest in AMBI to Niece in order to protect his interests prior\r\n  to his upcoming marriage.Â  The brothers claimed Niece later transferred this\r\n  interest to Aboli.Â  While Iraj acknowledged that his intention at the time was\r\n  to transfer his interest to Niece,[3] he testified that he did not believe he ever signed the papers to make that\r\n  transfer.Â Â Â  \r\nNo\r\n  document purporting to transfer any ownership interest was entered into\r\n  evidence with Iraj's signature on it.Â  In fact, the only document involving Niece\r\n  transferring an interest in AMBI states, &quot;[Niece] . . . conveys, transfers,\r\n  and assigns unto [Aboli] any and all of the interest [Niece] previously\r\n  acquired from [Aboli] in AMBI . . . .&quot;Â  Moreover, AMBI's tax returns\r\n  continued to list Iraj as late as 1997.Â  \r\nAdditionally, in\r\n  October 1996, Iraj received a letter from Ahmad informing him a corporate\r\n  meeting was being called.Â  Following that meeting, Iraj received another letter\r\n  confirming what had been decided at the meeting.Â  The letter stated, &quot;It\r\n  was decided that [Iraj], by majority of the vote, should be and was removed\r\n  from his position as Secretary-Treasurer of AMBI, Inc.Â  It was also decided\r\n  that his employment with AMBI, Inc., be terminated effective immediately.&quot;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhile we\r\n  acknowledge there is a conflict between the two parties' accounts as to whether\r\n  Iraj actually transferred his 25% ownership interest in AMBI to Niece, we find\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates Iraj retained his interest in\r\n  AMBI and, therefore, also held a 25% ownership interest in the successor\r\n  business, AMA.Â  As further support that Iraj held a 25% ownership interest in\r\n  the business, in October 2002, the brothers signed a document recognizing Iraj's\r\n  25% ownership interest in AMA.Â  The document, which was filed with the\r\n  Secretary of State, acknowledged that Iraj always held a 25% ownership interest\r\n  in AMA and that it was merely through inadvertence or mistake that Iraj was not\r\n  transferred over as a shareholder of stock from AMBI to AMA.Â  Although the\r\n  document was titled &quot;Amendments to the Articles of Organization for AMA,\r\n  LLC,&quot; the document was merely a confirmation of Iraj's ownership interest.[4]Â  \r\nFurther, we find\r\n  the brothers are estopped from denying the facts set forth in the document.Â  &quot;The\r\n  doctrine of estoppel applies if a person, by his actions, conduct, words, or\r\n  silence which amounts to a representation, or a concealment of material facts,\r\n  causes another to alter his position to his prejudice or injury.&quot;Â  Rushing\r\n    v. McKinney, 370 S.C. 280, 293, 633 S.E.2d 917, 924 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  As to\r\n  the party being estopped, the essential elements are (1) conduct amounting to a\r\n  false representation or concealment of material facts, or conduct calculated to\r\n  convey the impression that the facts are different or inconsistent with those\r\n  that the party subsequently attempts to assert; (2) intention or expectation\r\n  that the conduct will be acted upon by the other party; and (3) knowledge, actual\r\n  or constructive, of the real facts.Â  Brading v. County of Georgetown, 327 S.C. 107, 114, 490 S.E.2d 4, 7 (1997).Â  As to the party claiming estoppel, &quot;the\r\n  essential elements are (1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of\r\n  the truth as to the facts in question, (2) reliance upon the conduct of the\r\n  party estopped, and (3) prejudicial change in position.&quot;Â  Id. at 114, 490 S.E.2d at 7-8.Â Â Â  \r\nThese elements have\r\n  been met in the present case.Â  By signing the document, the brothers\r\n  represented to Iraj that he held an undisputed 25% ownership interest in AMA.Â \r\n  The brothers made this representation with knowledge that Iraj would rely on it\r\n  and, therefore, not seek the help of an attorney to secure his interest in the\r\n  business.Â  Iraj did in fact rely on this representation and took no further\r\n  legal actions.Â  Thus, the brothers are estopped to deny Iraj held a 25%\r\n  ownership interest in AMA. \r\nII. Timeliness of the Actions\r\nFinding\r\n  Iraj owned a 25% interest in AMA, we must address the timeliness of this\r\n  action.Â  The brothers claim Iraj's actions for corporate dissolution and an\r\n  accounting are barred as untimely by the equitable doctrine of laches.Â  The\r\n  brothers also argue the action for breach of fiduciary duty is untimely due to\r\n  the statute of limitations.Â  We disagree that the equitable actions are\r\n  untimely, and we will address the timeliness of the legal action in a subsequent\r\n  section.Â  \r\nThis action\r\n  involves both equitable and legal causes of action. Â As stated earlier, actions\r\n  seeking corporate dissolution or an accounting are both actions in equity.Â  Keane,\r\n  372 S.C. at 142, 641 S.E.2d at 57; see Lee, 251 S.C. at 535, 164\r\n  S.E.2d at 308-09 (holding an action for an accounting is equitable).Â  &quot;[The\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court] has held that the statute of limitations does not\r\n  apply to actions in equity.&quot;Â  Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388,\r\n  400, 608 S.E.2d 849, 855 (2005).Â  Equitable causes of action may be barred as\r\n  untimely, however, by the doctrine of laches.Â  Chambers of S.C., Inc. v.\r\n    County Council for Lee County, 315 S.C. 418, 421, 434 S.E.2d 279, 280\r\n  (1993).Â  \r\n&quot;Under\r\n  the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his rights, does not seasonably\r\n  assert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his adversary to incur expenses\r\n  or to enter into obligations or otherwise detrimentally change his position,\r\n  then equity will ordinarily refuse to enforce those rights.&quot;Â  Id. Â &quot;The party asserting laches has the burden of showing negligence, the\r\n  opportunity to act sooner, and material prejudice.&quot;Â  Richey v.\r\n    Dickinson, 359 S.C. 609, 612, 598 S.E.2d 307, 309 (Ct. App. 2004). This\r\n  Court has wide discretion to determine what constitutes an unreasonable delay.Â  Chambers of S.C., Inc., 315 S.C. at 421, 434 S.E.2d at 280.Â  However, &quot;[d]elay\r\n  alone in the assertion of a right, without injury to the adversary, does not\r\n  constitute laches.&quot;Â  Gibbs v. Kimbrell, 311 S.C. 261, 269, 428\r\n  S.E.2d 725, 730 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nAs\r\n  noted above, we find Iraj always held a 25% ownership interest in AMA.Â  Thus,\r\n  there was no need for him to bring an action against the brothers seeking an\r\n  accounting or a corporate dissolution until all of the assets of AMA were\r\n  transferred to a third party without his knowledge or consent, which occurred\r\n  in May 2003.Â  Iraj initially filed his claim in July 2004, and following\r\n  further discovery, an amended complaint was filed in August 2005.Â  While we do\r\n  not find this time period demonstrates an unreasonable delay by Iraj, we\r\n  further note the brothers have failed to demonstrate how they have been\r\n  prejudiced by any delay on Iraj's behalf.Â  Consequently, the doctrine of laches\r\n  is inapplicable.Â  We find the equitable actions seeking an accounting and\r\n  dissolution were not barred by the doctrine of laches.\r\nIII. Damages\r\n\r\n  a. Actual Damages\r\n\r\nThe brothers argue\r\n  the master erred in its award of actual damages.Â  Specifically, the brothers\r\n  argue (1) the evidence does not support a finding that Iraj is entitled to\r\n  $91,031.28 for his 25% interest in the proceeds of the sale of AMA; and (2) the\r\n  evidence does not support an award of lost cash distributions to Iraj.Â  We agree\r\n  in part.Â  Â \r\nThe master has\r\n  considerable discretion regarding the amount of damages, both actual and\r\n  punitive.Â  Collins Entm't Corp. v. Coats &amp; Coats Rental Amusement,\r\n  355 S.C. 125, 138, 584 S.E.2d 120, 127 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If evidence in the\r\n  record supports the award for actual damages, this Court will only review the\r\n  award for errors of law.Â  Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc.,\r\n  358 S.C. 298, 310-11, 594 S.E.2d 867, 873 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nA\r\n  business should be valued at its fair market value as a going business.Â  Brandi\r\n    v. Brandi, 302 S.C. 353, 357, 396 S.E.2d 124, 126 (Ct. App. 1990). Â &quot;Determination\r\n  of fair market value is a question of fact.&quot;Â  Payne v. Holiday Towers,\r\n    Inc., 283 S.C. 210, 215, 321 S.E.2d 179, 182 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Each case\r\n  must be decided on its own facts and circumstances; thus, the court is not\r\n  restricted to one method of valuation.Â  Belk of Spartanburg, S.C., Inc. v. Thompson, 337 S.C. 109, 116, 522 S.E.2d 357, 360 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nFair\r\n  market value has been defined as &quot;[t]he price that a seller is willing to\r\n  accept and a buyer is willing to pay on the open market and in an arm's[]length\r\n  transaction.&quot; Â Black's Law Dictionary 1256 (7th ed. 2000); see Hous.\r\n    Auth. of Charleston v. Olasov, 282 S.C. 603, 608, 320 S.E.2d 478, 481 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1984) (&quot;Fair market value is the price which a willing buyer will pay\r\n  a willing seller, neither being under compulsion to buy or sell . . . .&quot;); Reid v. Reid, 280 S.C. 367, 373, 312 S.E.2d 724, 727 (Ct. App. 1984)\r\n  (stating the generally accepted definition of fair market value is the amount a\r\n  willing but not obligated buyer would pay to a willing but not obligated\r\n  seller).Â  As to a business interest, &quot;[t]he fair market value . . . can\r\n  often be determined simply by examining its market price.&quot;Â  Estate of\r\n    Godley v. C.I.R., 286 F.3d 210, 214 (4th Cir. 2002).Â  When a business does\r\n  not have a ready market for its shares or a sale has yet to take place, courts\r\n  will generally consider and weigh multiple factors such as &quot;inventory,\r\n  accounts payable and receivable, and other legitimate assets or liabilities.&quot;Â  Brandi, 302 S.C. at 357, 396 S.E.2d at 126.Â  In the current case,\r\n  however, the business has already been sold in an arm's length transaction.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, different values of AMA were presented.Â  It was shown that the brothers\r\n  purchased a 1/3 interest in AMA from Ahmad for $120,000.Â  Prior to selling AMA's\r\n  assets to Ganesh, the property was listed for $447,500.Â  Ganesh later purchased\r\n  the property for $345,000.Â  From these various values, the master determined\r\n  AMA's fair market value to be $396,250, which was the average between the\r\n  listing price and the sale price.Â  We find this valuation improper.Â  \r\nWayne Corley, a\r\n  certified public accountant, testified the sale of AMA to Ganesh appeared to be\r\n  an arm's length transaction.Â  Corley further stated $345,000 represented the\r\n  fair market value of the business.Â  Additionally, the master made no\r\n  findings that the sale was not an arm's length transaction.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFinding the business was sold to a third party in an\r\n  arm's length transaction, we find AMA's fair market value is reflected by the\r\n  sales price, which was $345,000.Â  Cf. Rutledge v. St. Paul Fire &amp;\r\n    Marine Ins. Co., 286 S.C. 360, 368, 334 S.E.2d 131, 136 (Ct. App. 1985) (&quot;The\r\n  price paid for property at an actual, voluntary, and bona fide sale\r\n  thereof is presumptive evidence of the property's value.&quot;) (emphasis in\r\n  original).Â  Iraj's 25% interest, therefore, amounts to $86,250.Â  This value,\r\n  however, is subject to a deduction.Â Â Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Iraj admitted to a deduction that should be taken from AMA's valuation\r\n  because of a loan payoff.Â  The master found the value of this loan to be\r\n  $32,124.89.Â  While the brothers argue their personal loans and contributions to\r\n  AMA should also be deducted from the business' value, there was insubstantial\r\n  evidence presented to support this claim.Â  In fact, the master noted that there\r\n  were no promissory notes, receipts, or cancelled checks showing loans by the\r\n  brothers to AMA.Â  Therefore, the master found the only deduction to be taken\r\n  amounted to $32,124.89, of which $8,031.22 was allocated to Iraj for his 25%\r\n  interest in the business.Â  This deduction brings Iraj's interest to\r\n  $78,218.78.Â  Because we find only the master's valuation of AMA to be improper,\r\n  we affirm the master's award of damages but modify the amount to reflect the\r\n  fair market value of Iraj's ownership interest as $78,218.78.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the\r\n  brothers argue the evidence does not support the master's award of lost cash\r\n  distributions.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;Any\r\n  distributions made by a limited liability company before its dissolution and\r\n  winding up must be in equal shares.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-405(a)\r\n  (2006).Â  Further, a member who assents to an unlawful distribution will be held\r\n  personally liable for the unlawful distribution.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-407(a)\r\n  (2006).Â Â Â  \r\nAt trial, William\r\n  Rawl, a certified public accountant, testified that after reviewing AMA's tax\r\n  returns he noticed substantial increases, ranging from $10,000 to $20,000, in\r\n  inventory year after year.Â  From this, he concluded AMA's sales were underreported\r\n  while purchases were reported at full value, resulting in unreported sales of\r\n  roughly $280,000.Â  Rawl supported this argument by comparing an independent\r\n  inventory of AMA's assets as of September 30, 2002, with the inventory figure\r\n  listed on AMA's tax return.Â  The independent inventory showed assets worth\r\n  $34,257, while the tax returns showed assets worth $225,268.Â  Based on these\r\n  two figures, Rawl calculated AMA's unreported sales to be $280,803.Â  The master\r\n  then found Iraj was entitled to 25% of these unreported sales, which amounted\r\n  to $70,200.75.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Iraj\r\n  testified it had been the business practice of AMBI for each shareholder to\r\n  take approximately $180 per day from the business as &quot;pick-up&quot;\r\n  money.Â  To support the contention that this practice continued with AMA, Rawl\r\n  examined AMA's sales and expense summaries from 2003.Â  Rawl noted that while\r\n  sales and purchases were similar to past years, in 2003 AMA had an increase of\r\n  over $10,000 in cash deposits.Â  Iraj stated this increase in cash was due to\r\n  the brothers not taking their usual &quot;pick-up&quot; money from the\r\n  business, because they were grooming the business for sale.Â  Based on the\r\n  foregoing, we find substantial evidence in the record supports an award for\r\n  lost cash distributions and, thus, affirm the master's award.Â  \r\n\r\n  b. Punitive Damages\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  brothers also argue the master erred in awarding Iraj punitive damages based on\r\n  the brothers' alleged breach of fiduciary duties.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we must address the timeliness of this action.Â  Iraj's claim for breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty is subject to a three-year statute of limitations. Â S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (2005); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-44-410(b) (2006).Â  The brothers\r\n  sold AMA to a third party without Iraj's knowledge or consent in May 2003.Â \r\n  Iraj then filed his initial complaint in July 2004 and his amended complaint in\r\n  August 2005.Â  Because the act of selling the business to a third party was the\r\n  main basis for the master's finding of a breach of fiduciary duty, we find the\r\n  claim was filed in a timely manner.\r\nAn\r\n  action for breach of fiduciary duty is an action at law.Â  Jordan, 362 S.C. at 205, 608 S.E.2d at 131.Â  Consequently, this Court must uphold the master's\r\n  findings unless they are without evidentiary support.Â  Id.Â  An award of\r\n  punitive damages is left almost completely to the discretion of the jury and\r\n  trial judge because the trial judge was able to hear all of the evidence and\r\n  was more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial.Â  Id. at 207,\r\n  608 S.E.2d at 132 (citations omitted).Â  An award of punitive damages can serve\r\n  two purposes: (1) punishing the wrongdoers and deterring them and others from\r\n  engaging in similar reckless, willful, wanton, or malicious conduct; and (2)\r\n  vindicating a private right of the injured party by requiring the wrongdoers to\r\n  pay money to that party.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369,\r\n  378-79, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000).\r\nIf\r\n  punitive damages are awarded, the master should review the amount awarded by\r\n  considering the factors set forth in Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104,\r\n  111-12, 406 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991).Â  These factors include the following: \r\n\r\n  (1) defendant's\r\n    degree of culpability; (2) duration of the conduct; (3) defendant's awareness\r\n    or concealment; (4) the existence of similar past conduct; (5) likelihood the\r\n    award will deter the defendant or others from like conduct; (6) whether the\r\n    award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; (7)\r\n    defendant's ability to pay; and finally, (8) . . . other factors deemed\r\n    appropriate.Â  \r\n\r\nId. (internal quotations and citations omitted).Â  The\r\n  master's findings on these factors must be set forth in the record.Â  Id. at 112, 406 S.E.2d at 354.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the master's award of punitive damages for breach of fiduciary duty is\r\n  supported by the evidence in the record.Â Â  The master found the misconduct of\r\n  the brothers warranted an award of punitive damages to Iraj.Â  This conduct\r\n  included selling all of AMA's assets to a third party without Iraj's knowledge\r\n  or consent, filing an official document stating Iraj held a 25% interest in AMA\r\n  and then taking an opposite position after the business' assets were sold,[5] failing to hold the sales proceeds in trust and to provide Iraj with his share,\r\n  and filing Articles of Termination for AMA without Iraj's knowledge or\r\n  consent.Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the master properly considered the Gamble factors when determining the\r\n  appropriate amount to be awarded, and the master set forth the findings in the\r\n  record.Â  The master found the brothers were completely culpable for the\r\n  misconduct leading to the award of punitive damages and that the brothers were\r\n  fully aware of this misconduct which they engaged in repeatedly.Â  The master also\r\n  found the award was likely to deter the brothers from similar conduct in the\r\n  future, the brothers had the ability to pay the award &quot;based on their note\r\n  with Ganesh and ownership interests in houses in Lexington County,&quot; and the award was reasonably related to the harm.Â Â Â  \r\nThere\r\n  is ample evidence in the record to support the master's findings.Â  For example,\r\n  Iraj testified he was not told about the sale of AMA's assets and was not given\r\n  any of the proceeds.Â  Iraj stated that after the sale he repeatedly asked the\r\n  brothers to provide him with his 25% share which they had acknowledged he owned\r\n  in the document signed and filed in November 2002, but the brothers refused to\r\n  acknowledge his interest.Â  Iraj also testified he was not consulted or included\r\n  in the filing of the Articles of Termination for AMA.Â  Â Â \r\nWe\r\n  find the master's findings are supported by evidence in the record, and\r\n  therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the master's award of punitive\r\n  damages.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  light of our decision on these issues, we need not address the remaining\r\n  arguments on appeal.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (finding when a\r\n  decision of one issue is dispositive, it is not necessary to decide remaining issues\r\n  on appeal).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the master's order is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED.\r\nPIEPER\r\nand GEATHERS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] It is unclear exactly what position Iraj held.Â  While\r\n  Iraj is named Secretary on many of AMBI's documents, a corporate letter from\r\n  1996 states Iraj's position was Secretary-Treasurer.Â  This distinction,\r\nhowever, does not change our analysis.Â  \r\n[2] Manooch and Aboli signed the Articles of Amendment\r\ntwice because the first draft was defective in form.Â  \r\n[3] In lieu of a prenuptial agreement, Iraj testified\r\n  that he planned to transfer &quot;everything in [his] name&quot; to members of\r\n  his family.Â  This included his interest in his mother's home and the\r\n  surrounding land as well as his interest in AMBI.Â  Iraj testified that while he\r\n  did transfer his interest in the home and land, his attorney told him it was\r\n  unnecessary to transfer his interest in the corporation, so those documents\r\nwere never signed.Â Â Â  \r\n[4] We additionally note that it is a crime for a person\r\n  to &quot;sign[] a document he knows is false in any material respect . . . with\r\n  intent that the document be delivered to the Secretary of State for\r\nfiling.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-1-290(a) (2006).Â Â  \r\n[5] We additionally note a party may be personally liable\r\n  for false statements made in filed records pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  33-44-209 (2006) which states: &quot;If a record authorized . . . to be filed\r\n  under this chapter contains a false statement, one who suffers loss by reliance\r\n  on the statement may recover damages for the loss from a person who signed the\r\n  record . . . and knew the statement to be false at the time the record was\r\nsigned.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4495","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM: In this case, James W.\r\n    Bodenstedt, Jr., appeals the plea judgeâ€™s decision to increase his sentence\r\n    from six to eight yearsâ€™ imprisonment.Â  Bodenstedt contends the plea judge\r\n    erred by increasing his sentence, instead of finding him in contempt of court\r\n    for his disruptive behavior after sentencing. Â We reverse.[1]\r\nBodenstedt\r\n  worked for a traveling carnival based out of Florida.Â  In October 2005, he telephoned\r\n  the victim, Donald McCarter, the father of a fellow carnival worker, at his\r\n  home in Easley, South Carolina, and made false representations to him.Â \r\n  Specifically, Bodenstedt informed McCarter that his son was in the hospital and\r\n  he needed money to pay his sonâ€™s medical bills.Â  Based upon these false\r\n  representations, McCarter sent more than $2,000 to Bodenstedt.Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  indictment, Bodenstedt pled guilty to obtaining money by false pretenses.Â  The State\r\n  recommended a sentence of â€œone year active time with a probationary sentence to\r\n  followâ€ and restitution.Â  Bodenstedt informed the plea judge that he contrived\r\n  to deceive McCarter because he and his wife, who was diagnosed with terminal\r\n  cancer, were in financial trouble.Â  Thereafter, the plea judge sentenced\r\n  Bodenstedt to six yearsâ€™ imprisonment and required him to pay restitution of\r\n  $2,383.11.Â  The plea judge informed Bodenstedt that he had ten days after\r\n  imposing a sentence to reconsider the matter, and if full restitution was made\r\n  within ten days, the sentence would be reconsidered.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  sentencing, the plea judge realized that Bodenstedt was being disruptive\r\n  outside of the courtroom and requested that an officer return Bodenstedt to the\r\n  courtroom.Â  The plea judge again stated to Bodenstedt that he had â€œthe\r\n  authority to amend this sentence within ten days at any time itâ€™s given.â€Â  Subsequently,\r\n  the plea judge increased Bodenstedtâ€™s sentence to seven yearsâ€™ imprisonment.Â  Bodenstedt\r\n  left the courtroom and again became disruptive.Â  The plea judge requested that\r\n  an officer return Bodenstedt to the courtroom for a second time, and the plea\r\n  judge increased Bodenstedtâ€™s sentence to eight years. \r\nAs to\r\n  whether it was proper for the plea judge to increase Bodenstedtâ€™s sentence\r\n  instead of punishing him for contempt of court, we find that the contempt power\r\n  was the proper mechanism for punishing disruptive behavior that occurred after sentencing.Â  See Miller v.Miller, 375 S.C. 443, 453-54, 652 S.E.2d 754, 759-60\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007) (internal citations omitted) (stating that courts have inherent\r\n  power to punish for contemptuous conduct, to preserve order in judicial\r\n  proceedings, and to enforce judgments and orders).Â  Â Â â€˜Contemptuous behaviorâ€™\r\n  is conduct which tends to bring the authority and the administration of the law\r\n  into disrespect.Â  Burns v. Universal Health Servs. Inc., 340 S.C. 509, 515,\r\n  532 S.E.2d 6, 10 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295\r\n  S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840, 840 (1988)).Â  In addition, direct contempt\r\n  involves contemptuous conduct in the presence of the court.Â  State v.\r\n    Kennerly, 337 S.C. 617, 620, 524 S.E.2d 837, 838 (1999). Â Â A person may be\r\n  found guilty of direct contempt if the conduct interferes with judicial\r\n  proceedings, exhibits disrespect for the court, or hampers the parties or\r\n  witnesses. Â State v. Havelka, 285 S.C. 388, 389, 330 S.E.2d 288, 288\r\n  (1985).Â  Direct contempt that occurs in the courtâ€™s presence may be immediately\r\n  adjudged and sanctioned summarily.Â  Intâ€™l Union, United Mine Workers of Am.\r\n    v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 827 (1994). \r\nIn the\r\n  instant case, the plea judge had already imposed Bodenstedtâ€™s sentence prior to\r\n  his disrespectful and contemptuous behavior in the presence of the court.Â  While\r\n  it is certainly within the plea judgeâ€™s power to punish a defendant for\r\n  disruptive behavior, the plea judge should have held Bodenstedt in contempt of\r\n  court, as is authorized by law.Â  Therefore, we reverse the plea judgeâ€™s\r\n  two-year increase of appellantâ€™s sentence and remand to the trial court for\r\n  reinstatement of the original sentence of six yearsâ€™ imprisonment. \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J., PIEPER, J., and GEATHERS, J. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4496","title":"Blackburn v.

Rene Josey, of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Minority shareholders, Kent Blackburn and Allison\r\n  Minnich, appeal an order denying their objections to a court-ordered appraisal\r\n  of common stock of Respondent, TKT and Associates, Inc., (TKT) for the purpose\r\n  of a shareholder buyout.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn late 2002, TKT\r\n  was formed by Blackburn, Tina Carver, and Tony Windham to sell durable medical equipment\r\n  (DME).[1]Â  The corporation was\r\n  funded by a loan for $50,000, which each incorporator co-signed. Â Upon\r\n  receiving the necessary authorization to provide DME through Medicaid, the\r\n  business began operations under the name Carolina Mobility.Â  Shortly\r\n  thereafter, Carolina Mobility hired Minnich, a sales representative with\r\n  experience in the DME field.Â  Under the terms of Minnich's employment, she\r\n  received ten percent of the shares of TKT.[2]Â  \r\nBoth Blackburn and\r\n  Minnich worked for Carolina Mobility full-time from its inception; Blackburn\r\n  working closely with Minnich in order to learn the DME business.Â  While Minnich\r\n  received a salary, Blackburn was only paid when distributions were made to the\r\n  other majority shareholders.Â  Consequently, in August of 2003, Blackburn left\r\n  Carolina Mobility to work with Darlington EMS so he could receive a regular\r\n  paycheck.Â  \r\nAfter Blackburn\r\n  left, Minnich assumed nearly all the responsibilities of running the company.Â \r\n  In early 2004, both Carver and Windham announced their intention to work for\r\n  the company on a full-time basis and receive a salary from Carolina Mobility in\r\n  the amount of $60,000 a year, respectively.Â  Additionally, Minnich's salary was\r\n  raised to $60,000.Â  Despite Carver and Windham's promise to work for Carolina\r\n  Mobility on a full-time basis, both split time working for Carolina Mobility\r\n  and another corporation they owned.Â  \r\nIn July 2004,\r\n  Carolina Mobility began experiencing cash flow issues, which resulted in\r\n  Minnich receiving only seven of the twelve pay checks due to her for the months\r\n  of July to December.Â  Thus, in spite of Carver and Windham's promise to pay\r\n  Minnich a $60,000 salary, Minnich received only $39,000 of actual compensation\r\n  in 2004, while Carver and Windham each received approximately $34,000.Â  \r\nIn January of 2005,\r\n  Minnich's salary was lowered to $40,000, while Carver and Windham each lowered\r\n  their salary to $30,000.Â  Minnich, who believed Carver and Windham's salaries\r\n  were still too high, called Blackburn and set up a shareholders meeting to\r\n  discuss the matter with Carver and Windham.Â  Shortly after the meeting, Minnich\r\n  left Carolina Mobility, and, in July of 2005, both Blackburn and Minnich sought\r\n  judicial dissolution of the corporation.Â  \r\nFollowing a one-day\r\n  bench trial, the trial court issued an order stating Carver and Windham engaged\r\n  in self-dealing, which deprived Blackburn and Minnich of â€œthe economic benefit\r\n  of the value of the [c]orporation's stock by excluding the minority shareholder\r\n  from the profits of the corporation.â€Â  Furthermore, the trial court found: Â (1)\r\n  Carver and Windham paid themselves in excess of their respective contributions\r\n  to the corporation; (2) Carver and Windham improperly drained the corporations\r\n  assets through claims of services as employees of the corporation; and (3) the\r\n  corporation was devalued by paying Minnich her salary and then splitting the\r\n  remaining earnings as individual salaries rather than profit. \r\nDespite finding for\r\n  Blackburn and Minnich, the trial court declined to dissolve the corporation.Â \r\n  Instead, it ordered Carver and Windham to purchase Blackburn and Minnich's\r\n  shares at their fair market value pursuant to section 33-14-310(d)(4) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2006).[3]Â  In its order, the trial\r\n  court sought to determine fair market value of the corporation's stock by\r\n  having an appraiser, agreed upon by both parties, determine the value of\r\n  Blackburn's and Minnich's respective shares.Â  Once chosen, the appraiser was\r\n  given access to the documents introduced at trial by Blackburn and Minnich\r\n  regarding the value of the services performed by Carver and Windham, in order\r\n  to make any adjustments to their respective salaries and to the value of the\r\n  corporation.Â  The appraiser also asked the parties to agree upon an adjustment\r\n  figure regarding Carver and Windham's salaries, but no agreement was made.Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  receiving the appraisal, Blackburn and Minnich filed an objection to the report\r\n  arguing the appraiser failed to comply with the trial court's order by not\r\n  adjusting Carver and Windham's salaries.Â  Blackburn and Minnich's motion was\r\n  denied and judgment was entered.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Blackburn and Minnich argue the trial court erred in admitting the\r\n  appraiser's report because the appraiser failed to adjust the salaries of\r\n  Carver and Windham as required by the trial court's order.Â  We disagree.\r\nSimply put, the\r\n  trial court's order commands Carver and Windham to buy Blackburn's and Minnich's\r\n  individual shares at fair market value.Â  Specifically, the trial court ordered,\r\n  â€œthe parties are to agree upon an impartial corporate appraiser . . .who will\r\n  compute the [c]orporation's value, and assign a dollar value per share of the\r\n  corporate stock.â€Â  While Blackburn and Minnich argue the trial court's order\r\n  implies an adjustment must be made in determining fair market value of the\r\n  corporation, the order does not expressly require such an adjustment.Â  Assuming\r\n  arguendo that this was the implication of the trial court's order, there was\r\n  neither a finding regarding the amount of any adjustment, nor did Blackburn and\r\n  Minnich make a post-trial motion requesting the trial court issue such a\r\n  finding.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  as stated in the trial court's second order denying Blackburn and Minnich's\r\n  objections to the appraisal, no evidence or information was proffered showing\r\n  the report was prepared improperly.Â  This was also the case at trial, where\r\n  Blackburn and Minnich offered minimal evidence to the trial court regarding the\r\n  actual value of the services Carver and Windham provided to the corporation.Â \r\n  With respect to this issue, the only evidence of note came from Minnich's\r\n  testimony and deposition.Â  Minnich testified to the hourly rate she paid her\r\n  own employees in her current job in the DME field.Â  Moreover in her deposition,\r\n  Minnich speculated about the going rate for technicians and secretaries,\r\n  positions with duties similar to those services provided by Carver and\r\n  Windham.Â  Yet despite Minnich's estimates concerning the comparable hourly rate\r\n  of the services provided by Carver and Windham, Minnich agreed she could not\r\n  determine, or create a formula for determining, the amount Carver and Windham\r\n  were overpaid.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  Blackburn and Minnich failed to present evidence indicating the appraisal was\r\n  conducted in an improper manner, or contrary to the trial court's order.Â  Consequently,\r\n  the trial court did not err in denying Blackburn and Minnich's objections to\r\n  the admission of the appraisal.Â  The decision of the trial court isÂ Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] DME includes walkers, wheelchairs, medical beds,\r\n  canes, shower seats, bed pans, sponges, sock aides, and other adaptive\r\n  equipment. Â \r\n[2] Blackburn, Carver, and Windham collectively retained\r\n  ninety percent ownership interest in the corporation, with each party holding a\r\n  thirty percent ownership interest.\r\n[3] Section 33-14-310(d) provides:Â  &quot;In any action filed by a shareholder to dissolve the corporation\r\n  on the grounds enumerated in Section 33-14-300, the court may make such order\r\n  or grant such relief, other than dissolution, as in its discretion is appropriate, including, without limitation, an\r\n  order: . . . (4) providing\r\n  for the purchase at their fair value of shares of any shareholder, either by\r\n  the corporation or by other shareholders.&quot; \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4494","title":"Ex Parte: Janice S.

Â On appeal, the\r\n  circuit court reversed the probate court and approved the petition for\r\n  Corbetts' contract.Â  Appellants appeal the circuit court's reversal.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAppeals from the\r\n  probate court are governed by the provisions of the Probate Code.Â  Matter of\r\n    Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 360, 434 S.E.2d 254, 256&nbsp;(1993).Â  The circuit\r\n  court must hear and determine an appeal from the probate court &quot;according\r\n  to the rules of law.&quot; Â Id. (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-308(d) (Supp.\r\n  2008)).Â  &quot;As used in [section 62-1-308], the phrase 'according to the\r\n  rules of law' means according to the rules governing appeals.&quot;Â  Id.Â  On appeal from the final order of the probate court, the circuit court must\r\n  apply the same rules of law as an appellate court would apply on appeal.Â  In\r\n    re Estate of Pallister, 363 S.C. 437, 447, 611 S.E.2d 250, 256&nbsp;(2005).Â \r\n  Consequently, if the proceeding in the probate court is in the nature of an\r\n  action at law, &quot;the circuit court and the appellate court may not disturb\r\n  the probate court's findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses\r\n  there is no evidence to support them.&quot;Â  Neely v. Thomasson, 365\r\n  S.C. 345, 349-50, 618 S.E.2d 884, 886&nbsp;(2005).Â  &quot;On the other hand, if the probate proceeding is\r\n  equitable in nature, [an appellate court] may make factual findings according\r\n  to its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  Matter of\r\n    Howard, 315 S.C. 356, 361-62, 434 S.E.2d 254, 257-58&nbsp;(1993).\r\n&quot;To determine\r\n  whether this suit is legal or equitable, we must look to the 'main purpose' of\r\n  the action as reflected by the nature of the pleadings and proof, and the\r\n  character of relief sought under them.&quot;Â  Gordon v. Drews, 358 S.C.\r\n  598, 604, 595 S.E.2d 864, 867&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  A claim of breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty is an action at law and the trial judge's findings will be\r\n  upheld unless without evidentiary support.Â  Jordan v. Holt, 362\r\n  S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d 129, 131&nbsp;(2005).Â  However, a &quot;breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty [claim] may sound in equity if the relief sought is\r\n  equitable.&quot;Â  Bivens v. Watkins, 313 S.C. 228, 230 n.3, 437 S.E.2d\r\n  132, 133 n.3 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Wheeler's Alleged\r\n  Breach of Her Fiduciary Duty as PR \r\nAppellants\r\n  contend the circuit court erred in reversing the probate court's finding that\r\n  Wheeler breached her fiduciary duty to Beneficiaries by failing to consider\r\n  other offers for the purchase of the property.Â  Appellants maintain Wheeler failed\r\n  to act in the best interest of the estate by not inquiring into or entertaining\r\n  an offer from Powers that Wheeler knew to be forthcoming as soon as an\r\n  appraisal had been conducted.Â  We disagree.\r\nAssuming\r\n  without deciding that Wheeler's petition to consummate the Corbetts' contract\r\n  to purchase the property sounded in equity, a claim of breach of fiduciary duty\r\n  is an action at law.Â  Clearwater Trust v. Bunting, 367 S.C. 340, 351\r\n  n.4, 626 S.E.2d 334, 340&nbsp;n.4 (2006).Â  Additionally, the circuit court stated\r\n  it was reviewing the decision of the probate court under the more stringent\r\n  standard at law.Â  A case may involve both equitable and legal issues.Â  See Blackmon v. Weaver, 366 S.C. 245, 248-49, 621 S.E.2d 42, 43-44&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  However, an appellate court must look to the main purpose of the\r\n  proceeding in order to determine the standard of review to exact.Â  Gordon v.\r\n    Drews, 358 S.C. 598, 604, 595 S.E.2d 864, 867&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004). \r\nAlthough this\r\n  action was filed by Wheeler solely in an attempt to approve the contract she\r\n  had accepted from the Corbetts as PR of Green's estate, Appellants' answer and\r\n  allegation of a breach of fiduciary duty in Wheeler's handling of the sale of\r\n  the property became the determinative issue in the hearing before the probate\r\n  court.Â  Nevertheless, the relief requested in the claim for breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty was for the Corbetts' contract to be set aside, and the Powers' proffered\r\n  contract to be approved.Â  See Bivens v. Watkins, 313 S.C. 228,\r\n  230 n.3, 437 S.E.2d 132, 133 n.3 (Ct. App. 1993) (noting a breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty claim may sound in equity if the relief sought is equitable).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  essence, Appellants' counterclaim and request to accept Powers' contract can be\r\n  construed as requesting two kinds of relief:Â  first, it took the form of a\r\n  motion for injunctive relief to disapprove the Corbetts' contract; and second,\r\n  it was accompanied by a request for specific performance of a separate\r\n  contract.Â  Because there was no acceptance of Powers' offer, a contract between\r\n  the estate and Powers never existed; therefore, specific performance on Powers'\r\n  offer could not be granted.Â  See Rushing v. McKinney, 370 S.C.\r\n  280, 290, 633 S.E.2d 917, 922 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding for a contract to exist,\r\n  there must be a meeting of the minds consisting of an offer and an acceptance)\r\n  (citation omitted); Ingram v. Kasey's Assocs, 340 S.C. 98, 106, 531\r\n  S.E.2d 287, 291 (2000) (&quot;In order to compel specific performance, a court\r\n  of equity must find: (1) there is clear evidence of a valid agreement . . .\r\n  .&quot;).Â  However, the power of the court to grant an injunction is in equity.Â  Strategic Res. Co. v.\r\n    BCS Life Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 540, 544, 627 S.E.2d 687, 689&nbsp;(2006).Â Â  As\r\n  decided by the circuit court, had the probate court not found Wheeler\r\n  breached her duties as a fiduciary to the estate, then the approval of the sale\r\n  to the Corbetts would presumably have followed accordingly.Â  Because the\r\n  injunctive relief requested in Appellants' breach of fiduciary duty claim took\r\n  an equitable form, it follows that the circuit court should have applied an\r\n  equitable standard of review, as will this court, and made factual findings\r\n  according to its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  \r\nA personal\r\n  representative is a fiduciary under this state's probate code.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 62-3-703 (Supp. 2008); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-201 (Supp. 2008). Â &quot;That a\r\n  fiduciary relationship exists between each heir or beneficiary of an estate and\r\n  the administratrix thereof is fundamental.&quot; Witherspoon v. Stogner,\r\n  182 S.C. 413, 414, 189 S.E. 758, 759 (1937). Â &quot;A fiduciary relationship\r\n  exists when one reposes special confidence in another, so that the latter, in\r\n  equity and good conscience, is bound to act in good faith and with due regard\r\n  to the interests of the one reposing confidence.&quot; O'Shea v. Lesser,\r\n  308 S.C. 10, 15, 416 S.E.2d 629, 631 (1992).Â  &quot;One standing in a fiduciary relationship with another is subject to liability\r\n  to the other for harm resulting from a breach of duty\r\n  imposed by the relation.&quot;Â  Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 253, 599\r\n  S.E.2d 467, 473 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nAccording to the\r\n  will, the PR of Green's estate was to sell any property Green owned at her\r\n  death in a manner that was &quot;most advantageous financially to [Green's]\r\n  estate, regardless of whether it takes a year or more to do so.&quot;Â  The\r\n  probate court found, and Wheeler even admitted, that she was aware of Powers'\r\n  interest in purchasing the property before she was even appointed at PR of the\r\n  estate.Â  Wheeler met with Powers, at which time Powers expressed her interest\r\n  in the property, and Wheeler indicated she would forward a forthcoming\r\n  appraisal to her when it became available.Â  However, despite Powers' repeated\r\n  phone calls, letters, and obvious interest in the status of the property,\r\n  Powers did not make a formal offer on the property in the four-plus months\r\n  following Green's death.Â  \r\nFaced\r\n  with the prospect of waiting on a speculative written offer to materialize, or\r\n  accepting an in-hand, written offer that was for more than the estate's own\r\n  appraisal, Wheeler decided it was in the best interest of the Beneficiaries to\r\n  accept the Corbetts' contract.Â  Moreover, when Powers did finally present a\r\n  written offer as a part of her answer and counterclaim, the offer contained\r\n  several contingencies that were not present in the Corbetts' offer, namely:Â  it\r\n  required the estate to issue a general warranty deed on the property; an\r\n  inspection clause to determine if the property would be suitable for Powers' use;\r\n  and the offer required Wheeler to warrant there was no litigation pending that\r\n  involved the property. \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  found that Wheeler, as a fiduciary of the estate, had to conform to the prudent\r\n  investor rule, codified under section 62-7-933 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  Specifically, the court concluded &quot;compliance with the\r\n  prudent investor rule is determined in light of the facts and circumstances\r\n  existing at the time of a trustee's decision or action and not by\r\n  hindsight.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-7-933(G) (Supp. 2008).Â  We agree.Â  At the\r\n  time Wheeler petitioned the probate court for approval, she knew of Powers'\r\n  interest, but had only received an offer from the Corbetts that was for more\r\n  than the appraisal and contained no unreasonable contingencies.Â  Given the\r\n  circumstances, Wheeler would have most likely breached her fiduciary duties had\r\n  she not accepted the Corbetts' offer.\r\nCONCLUSION[1]\r\nIn our view under\r\n  the preponderance of the evidence, Wheeler did not breach her fiduciary duty in\r\n  accepting the sole written contract the estate had received.Â  Consequently, the\r\n  circuit court did not err in reversing the probate court and approving the\r\n  Corbetts' contract. The decision of the circuit court is therefore \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, J., and\r\n  KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wheeler and the Corbetts also contend Appellants have\r\n  not preserved our review any argument suggesting the standard for approval of\r\n  the Corbettsâ€™ contract to purchase the property, analyzed separately from any\r\n  alleged breach of fiduciary duty by Wheeler, is whether the contract is in the\r\n  best interests of the beneficiaries.Â  Because we find the circuit court did not\r\n  err in its analysis of the preponderance of the evidence, we need not view the\r\n  disapproval of the Corbettsâ€™ contract separate and apart from an allegation of Wheelerâ€™s\r\n  breach.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an\r\n    appellate court need not review remaining issues when its\r\n  determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
