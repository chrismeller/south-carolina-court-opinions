We affirm. \r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 14, 1989, Eagle Creek Construction Co., Inc., a subsidiary of L-J, Inc. contracted with\r\nDunes West Joint Venture to develop the site and construct the roads for the Dunes West\r\nsubdivision at a cost of $3,632,458.75.  Eagle Creek hired subcontractor, U.S. Construction\r\nCo., Inc., to clear, grub, rough grade, fine grade, and construct the sub-base and base for roads\r\nwithin the project.  U.S. Construction, in turn,  hired Site Prep, Inc., and Destiny Construction,\r\nInc., to perform some of these tasks.  Eagle Creek also subcontracted for Tidelands Utilities\r\nCo., Inc., to construct and install a water drainage system.  Another subcontractor, Sanders\r\nBrothers Construction, Inc., paved the roads.\r\n\r\nThe subcontractors completed the roads in 1990.  By 1994, the road surfaces had deteriorated\r\nand failed.  Testimony indicated drainage problems and an inadequate subgrade due primarily\r\nto tree stumps left in the roadbed.  The stumps prevented the soil from being adequately\r\ncompacted and allowed surface water and moisture to seep into the road base, deteriorating\r\nthe pavement.\r\n\r\nDunes West filed an action in 1994 against Eagle Creek and \r\n  L-J alleging inter alia breach of contract, breach of warranty, and negligence. \r\n  L-J and Eagle Creek filed a third-party complaint against several of the project \r\n  designers and subcontractors engaged to work on the Dunes West construction.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, L-J settled with Dunes West and agreed to pay $750,000.00.  L-J requested that its\r\nfour insurers from 1989 until 1996 indemnify it for the settlement amount.  During the time\r\nperiod in which Dunes West alleged the damage to the roads occurred, L-J was insured by\r\nseveral different commercial insurers: Transcontinental Insurance Company, Bituminous Fire\r\nand Marine Insurance Company, The Home Indemnity Company, and The Maryland\r\nCommercial Insurance Group.  All insurance companies except Bituminous agreed to\r\nindemnify L-J for a portion of the settlement amount.  The insurers paid $362,500.00, and the\r\nproject designers and subcontractors paid $387,500.00.\r\n\r\nL-J, Eagle Creek, Transcontinental Insurance, The Home Indemnity, and The Maryland\r\nCommercial Insurance brought a declaratory judgment action against Bituminous.  L-J and\r\nEagle Creek sought indemnification for all defense costs and settlement payments.  The three\r\ninsurance carriers also sought contribution from Bituminous for defense costs and any\r\nsettlement payment made in the Dunes West litigation.  The matter was referred to a special\r\nmaster with finality, and a hearing was held on April 27, 2000.\r\n\r\nThe special master found the allegations of negligence set forth in Dunes West's complaint\r\nmet the definition of \"occurrence\" under Bituminous's policy with L-J.  The special master\r\nfurther found the failure of the road did not constitute damage \"expected or intended\" by\r\nEagle Creek.  The special master noted Bituminous's argument at the hearing that Dunes\r\nWest's complaint alleged property damage to Eagle Creek's work \"arising out of it and\r\nincluded in the products completed operations hazard,\" which is excluded from coverage\r\nunder exclusion (l) of the policy.  The special master, however, found the policy exclusion\r\nwas inapplicable because the exclusion specifically provides it does not apply to damages\r\nresulting from work performed by a subcontractor and all the parties agreed the work to the\r\nroads was exclusively performed by subcontractors. \r\n\r\nThe special master awarded the other carriers a proportionate \r\n  contribution from Bituminous. The special master found that the years 1989 to \r\n  1996 represented a total of seven \"policy years,\" and that Bituminous provided \r\n  coverage to L-J for two years. Taking the total $362,500.00 paid by the other \r\n  three carriers and dividing it by seven years of coverage, the special master \r\n  determined that each carrier owed $51,785.71 per policy year. Thus, Bituminous \r\n  owed the other carriers $103,571.42 for two years of coverage.\r\n\r\nBituminous appeals.  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nBituminous argues the master erred in finding it had a duty to indemnify L-J because: (1)\r\nfaulty workmanship cannot constitute an \"occurrence\" under the policy; (2) the policy\r\nexcludes claims for faulty workmanship; and (3) exclusion  (l) did not \"extend\" coverage for\r\nfaulty workmanship. \r\n\r\n\"Questions of coverage and the duty of a liability insurance \r\n  company to defend a claim brought against its insured are determined by the \r\n  allegations of the third-party's complaint.\" (1) \r\n  The underlying complaint alleged inter alia negligence, breach \r\n  of contract, and breach of warranty.\r\n\r\nL-J seeks a declaratory judgment to compel indemnification under an insurance policy.  A\r\ndeclaratory judgment action to determine coverage under an insurance contract is an action at\r\nlaw. (2)  In an action at law, referred to a master for entry of final judgment, the appellate court\r\nwill not disturb the findings of fact unless there is no evidence that reasonably supports\r\nthem. (3)  Our scope of review in this case is therefore limited to correcting errors of law. (4)\r\n\r\nBituminous first contends the master erred in finding there was an \"occurrence\" under the\r\npolicy because faulty workmanship can never constitute an \"occurrence.\"  \r\n\r\n\r\nInsurance policies are subject to the general rules of contract construction. The Court must\r\ngive policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. When a contract is\r\nunambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be construed according to the terms the parties have\r\nused. Furthermore, exclusions in an insurance policy are always construed most strongly\r\nagainst the insurer. (5)      \r\n\r\n\r\nWe thus look to the language of the policy to determine whether the deterioration and failure\r\nof the roads from repeated water runoff is an \"occurrence.\"  The policy provides coverage for\r\nproperty damage caused by an \"occurrence\" and defines \"property damage\" as:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All\r\nsuch loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n  Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss shall be deemed\r\nto occur at the time of the \"occurrence\" that caused it. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThere is no coverage for property damage that is \"expected or intended from the standpoint of\r\nthe insured.\"  The policy defines \"occurrence\" as \"an accident, including continuous or\r\nrepeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\"  In this case, it is\r\nundisputed that  repeated exposure to surface water runoff caused the pavement to fail. The\r\npavement is  tangible property.  The policy provides coverage for continuous and repeated\r\nexposure to harmful conditions causing damage to tangible property.  Under the clear\r\nlanguage of the policy, the repeated exposure to water is an \"accident\" and therefore an\r\n\"occurrence.\"\r\nIt is further undisputed L-J did not perform the work on the sub-road. The work was\r\nperformed by subcontractors. There is no evidence L-J knew of the problems with the sub-road until the surface pavement damage became apparent years later.  Because L-J did not\r\nimproperly construct the sub-road or have knowledge of the improper construction, there is no\r\nevidence that L-J expected or intended that the pavement would fail. Under the plain and\r\nunambiguous language of the policy, there is an \"occurrence.\" (6)\r\n\r\nBituminous argues, however, that the policy language regarding the definition of \"occurrence\"\r\nshould be construed in light of the business risk doctrine. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe business risk doctrine is the expression of a public policy applied to the insurance\r\ncoverage provided under commercial general liability policies.  Reduced to its simplest terms,\r\nthe risk that an insured's product will not meet contractual standards is a business risk not\r\ncovered by a general liability policy. \r\n\r\n\r\n* * * \r\n\r\nSignificantly, under the business risk doctrine, harm to the property of a third party caused by\r\nthe insured's defective work is not excluded from coverage. (7)\r\n\r\n  Relying on this doctrine, Bituminous disregards the damage to the pavement and contends\r\nthat faulty workmanship alone is at issue and that there was therefore no \"occurrence.\" (8) \r\nBituminous also argues that faulty workmanship can never be an \"occurrence\" under a\r\ncomprehensive general liability (CGL) policy. \r\n\r\nWe agree that faulty workmanship, standing alone, does not \r\n  constitute an \"accident\" and cannot therefore be an \"occurrence.\" In Isle \r\n  of Palms Pest Control Co., (9) this court \r\n  construed identical policy definitions and found that faulty workmanship alone \r\n  is not covered but faulty workmanship that causes an accident is covered. \r\n  In that case, the court found that later termite damage to property caused by \r\n  Isle of Palms's negligent failure to identify the presence of termites during \r\n  its inspection was an \"accident.\" The court noted \"[h]ad there been preexisting \r\n  termite damage, but no active termite infestation, the Purchaser's claim against \r\n  Isle of Palms would have been one for faulty workmanship resulting in only economic \r\n  losses.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in this case, had the pavement not failed and Dunes West brought an action to\r\nrecover the cost of removing the tree stumps from the roadbed, the defective work, standing\r\nalone, would not have been \"property damage\" or an \"occurrence\" under the policy. The\r\ndamages, however, extend beyond the cost of removing the tree stumps because the failure to\r\nproperly compact the roadbed led to property damage, namely, the failure of the road surfaces. \r\nThese remote damages were an \"accident\" not expected or intended by the insured.\r\n\r\nHaving found there was an \"occurrence\" under the policy, we look to the policy exclusions. \r\nExclusion j(6) states the insurance does not cover \"[t]hat particular part of any property that\r\nmust be restored, repaired or replaced because 'your work' (10) was incorrectly performed on\r\nit.\"  This is a standard CGL business risk exclusion (11) and would appear to bar coverage in\r\nthis case.  But the policy further states, \"[p]aragraph (6) of this exclusion does not apply to\r\n'property damage' included in the 'products-completed operations hazard.'\"\r\nThe products-completed operations hazard provision includes:\r\n\r\n\r\n  all \"bodily injury\" and \"property damage\" occurring away \r\n    from premises you own or rent and arising out of \"your product\" or \"your work\" \r\n    except:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      (1)\r\n      Products that are still in your physical possession; or\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (2)\r\n             Work that has not yet been completed or abandoned.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    b.\r\n    &quot;Your work&quot; will be deemed\r\n      completed at the earliest of the following times:\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      (1)\r\n        When all of the work called for in your contract has been completed.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (2)\r\n      When all of the work to be done at the site has been completed if your  contract calls for\r\nwork at more than one site.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      (3)\r\n      When that part of the work done at a\r\n        job site has been put to its intended use by any person or organization\r\n        other than another contractor or subcontractor working on the same\r\n        project.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWork that may need service, maintenance, correction, repair or replacement, but which is\r\notherwise complete, will be treated as completed. (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe roads were competed in July 1990.  Bituminous insured L-J from May of 1990 to May of\r\n1992.  The special master found there was property damage during this time.  The \"products-completed operations hazard\" provision is therefore applicable.\r\n\r\nResuming our examination of the policy, we come to exclusion (l). This exclusion bars\r\ncoverage for \"Property damage\" to \"your work\" arising out of it or any part of it and included\r\nin the \"products-completed operations hazard\". (sic).\r\n\r\n  Once again an exclusion appears to bar coverage, but reading further we see the \"your work\"\r\nexclusion \"does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises\r\nwas performed on your behalf by a subcontractor.\"  It is undisputed in this case that the\r\ndefective work was performed by a subcontractor.  This clear and unambiguous policy\r\nlanguage restores coverage.\r\n\r\nThe exception to the \"your work\" exclusion did not appear \r\n  in CGL policies prior to 1986. (12) The effect \r\n  of this exception on a CGL policy is a novel question in this state. Bituminous \r\n  argues this provision cannot \"extend\" coverage. Because the same CGL policies \r\n  are found throughout the country, we look to other jurisdictions for guidance. \r\n  The Wisconsin Court of Appeals in Kalchthaler v. Keller Construction Company \r\n  (13) concluded:\r\n\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, the industry chose to add the new exception to the business risk\r\nexclusion in 1986.  We may not ignore that language when interpreting case law decided\r\nbefore and after the addition.  To do so would render the new language superfluous.  We\r\nrealize that under our holding a general contractor who contracts all the work to\r\nsubcontractors, remaining on the job in a merely supervisory capacity, can insure complete\r\ncoverage for faulty workmanship.  However, it is not our holding that creates this result: it is\r\nthe addition of the new language to the policy.  We have not made the policy closer to a\r\nperformance bond for general contractors, the insurance industry has. (14)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another case construing an identical provision, O'Shaugnessy \r\n  v. Smuckler Corp., (15) the court held:\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, we are faced not with an omission, but an affirmative statement on the part of those who\r\ndrafted the policy language, asserting that the exclusion does not apply to damages arising out\r\nof the work of a subcontractor.  It would be willful and perverse for this court simply to ignore\r\nthe exception that has now been added to the exclusion.\r\n\r\nWe cannot conclude that the exception to exclusion (l) has no meaning or effect. The CGL\r\npolicy already covers damage to the property of others.  The exception to the exclusion, which\r\naddresses \"'property damage' to 'your work,'\" must therefore apply to damages to the\r\ninsured's own work that arise out of the work of a subcontractor.  Thus, we conclude that the\r\nexception at issue was intended to narrow the Business Risk Doctrine. (16)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe O'Shaugnessy court cautioned, however, that its \r\n  holding did not obviate the necessity that the subcontractor's faulty workmanship \r\n  cause property damage. (17)\r\n\r\nWe find the above reasoning persuasive and conclude in this \r\n  case that the products-completed operations hazard provision and the exception \r\n  to exclusion (l) restore coverage. This is not, as Bituminous argues, an \"extension\" \r\n  of coverage. In reaching this conclusion, we follow the analysis laid out by \r\n  our supreme court in Century Indemnity. In that case the court looked \r\n  to the policy language to determine whether the products-completed operations \r\n  hazard provision \"restored\" coverage. We note the Century case did not \r\n  involve an exception to the business risk exclusion for work performed by a \r\n  subcontractor. Nonetheless, we employ the same approach to policy language as \r\n  our supreme court in that case.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe affirm the master's finding that there was an \"occurrence\" under the policy and that\r\nBituminous is liable for water damage to roads in the Dunes West subdivision occurring\r\nduring its policy period.  We note that Bituminous does not appeal the master's factual finding\r\nof property damage during this time. As such, that finding is the law of the case. (18)\r\n\r\nWe further find that the products-completed operations hazard and subcontractor exception\r\nprovisions restore coverage that would otherwise have been excluded by the \"your work\"\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n\r\nHOWARD, J., concurs.  HEARN, C.J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:  I respectfully dissent.  Although I agree with the majority that exclusion (l)\r\ndoes not bar coverage here, I would not reach that question because I believe there was no\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nUnder the policy, there must be an occurrence to trigger \r\n  insurance coverage. The policy defines occurrence as \"an accident, including \r\n  continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" \r\n  Here, faulty construction resulted in the collapse of the construction project \r\n  itself. Under our case law, faulty workmanship alone is not an occurrence; there \r\n  must also be an accident. Isle of Palms Pest Control Co. v. Monticello Ins. \r\n  Co., 319 S.C. 12, 16, 459 S.E.2d 318, 320 (Ct. App. 1994), aff'd 321 S.C.310, \r\n  468 S.E.2d 304 (1996).\r\n\r\nWith respect to whether ordinary negligence of the insured \r\n  or his agent is an accident, there is a decided split of authority among the \r\n  states. See generally J.P. Ludington, Annotation, Liability Insurance: \"Accident\" \r\n  or Accidental\" as Including Loss Resulting from Ordinary Negligence of Insured \r\n  or His Agent 7 A.L.R.3d 1262 (1966 &amp; Supp. 2000). Some jurisdictions \r\n  have found that injury caused by the insured's negligence is not an accident \r\n  if the loss is a natural and probable consequence of the negligence. Id. \r\n  at Â§ 6. Other jurisdictions have found that the term accident is broad enough \r\n  to cover negligence if the injury or damage was not intentional. Id. \r\n  at Â§ 5. I would hold that South Carolina falls into the first group.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Circuit, construing South Carolina law, has found:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our case, neither the means nor the result was accidental, since the acts which caused the\r\ndamage were persistently and continuously done and the results were the normal\r\nconsequences of the acts.  We do not mean to say that there may not be an accident as a result\r\nof negligence, but there was no such result in this case and it cannot be held that negligence is\r\nsynonymous with accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Y. Thomason Co. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 183 \r\n  F.2d 729, 732-33 (4th Cir. 1950) (citations omitted) (finding no coverage for \r\n  negligent excavation of a ditch resulting in flooding and debris build-up in \r\n  garage or for creating bump which damaged cars entering garage). In another \r\n  case applying our law, the Fourth Circuit found that there was no accident for \r\n  purposes of coverage where negligence was followed by a foreseeable consequence \r\n  \"for then neither the cause nor the effect is unexpectable. [sic]\" Baker \r\n  v. Am. Ins. Co. of Newark, NJ, 324 F.2d 748, 750 (4th Cir. 1963) (finding \r\n  coverage in case of negligently built retaining wall because century high rainfall \r\n  exacerbated damage). These interpretations are consistent with South Carolina \r\n  case law's definition of accident. See Ducker v. Cent. Sur. &amp; \r\n  Ins. Corp., 234 S.C. 228, 230-31, 107 S.E.2d 342, 343 (1959) (adopting the \r\n  following definition: \"An effect which does not ordinarily follow and cannot \r\n  be reasonably anticipated from the use of those means, an effect which the actor \r\n  did not intend to produce and cannot be charged with the design of producing, \r\n  . . . is produced by accidental means.\"); Mfrs. &amp; Merchants Mut. Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Harvey, 330 S.C. 152, 159, 498 S.E.2d 222, 225 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\nI disagree with the majority's characterization of the damages \r\n  here as remote and unexpected. The only damages in this case were the natural \r\n  and proximate result of the faulty work. See  Stroup Sheet Metal Works, \r\n  Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 268 S.C. 203, 213, 232 S.E.2d 885, 888-89 \r\n  (1977 ) (finding no coverage for faulty workmanship because the damage could \r\n  not be considered \"neither expected nor intended. . . .\"). The record contains \r\n  no allegations of an intervening and superseding cause that might be classified \r\n  as accidental.\r\n\r\nThe majority contends that under Isle of Palms the \r\n  damage here was caused by an occurrence. However, the facts and the focus of \r\n  the inquiry there differ markedly from the instant case. In Isle of Palms, \r\n  a termite inspector negligently failed to discover existing termite damage. \r\n  The analysis centered on how that failure resulted in property damage as opposed \r\n  to purely economic loss. In this case, there is no question about whether there \r\n  was property damage; we are instead called to determine whether there was an \r\n  occurrence. Moreover, the consequences and expectations in a negligent inspection \r\n  scenario are not the same as those in a negligent construction case. I find \r\n  the case of Indiana Insurance Co. v. Hydra Corp., 615 N.E.2d 70 (Ill. \r\n  App. Ct. 1993) instructive because, unlike many of the other cases interpreting \r\n  whether damage was caused by an accident, all of the damages were directly tied \r\n  to the construction project. There, the court found no occurrence and thus no \r\n  coverage because \"the cracks in the floor and the loose paint on the exterior \r\n  of the building are the natural and ordinary consequences of installing defective \r\n  concrete flooring and applying the wrong type of paint.\" Id. at 73. The \r\n  same reasoning applies here because neither the cause of the problem nor the \r\n  damage that followed was unforeseeable. (19)\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I would reverse.\r\n\r\n1.

As noted in a recent article:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CGL policy expressly states that it is the \"property damage\" for which the plaintiff seeks\r\nrecovery that must not be expected or intended - not the construction activity that causes that\r\nproperty damage. \r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe [insurance] industry has now taken to arguing that whenever a claim of defective\r\nconstruction is alleged against an insured, the claim is automatically barred from coverage as\r\nnot constituting an \"occurrence.\"  The position is nothing more than a rehash of the \"business\r\nrisk\" doctrine, whose success depends entirely on courts ignoring the actual language of the\r\nCGL policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Duffy O'Connor, What Every Construction Lawyer \r\n  Should Know About CGL Coverage for Defective Construction, 21-WTR Constr. \r\n  Law. 15, 17 (2001) (citation omitted). \r\n9.  319 S.C. 12, 459 S.E.2d 318 (Ct.

Code Ann. Â§ 16-21-80 (Supp. 2000). (1)  He contends the\r\ntrial judge should have directed a verdict in his favor because the evidence was insufficient to\r\nshow that he knew the motorcycle was stolen.   We affirm. (2)\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a directed verdict motion, this court must view the evidence in\r\nthe light most favorable to the State and uphold the denial of the motion if there is any\r\nevidence, direct or circumstantial, that reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused. (3)\r\n\r\nOn July 17, 2001, in the early morning, Larry Hamilton saw four males get out of a white\r\nOldsmobile with shiny hubcaps and run toward a neighbor's house.  Later that morning he\r\ndiscovered the two motorcycles that he owned and kept stored in an open garage were\r\nmissing.  Before contacting the sheriff's office, he and his wife found one motorcycle in a\r\nfield behind their house.  He could not find the other, a Suzuki for which Hamilton paid over\r\n$5,900.\r\n\r\nThe next day, July 18, 2001, Hamilton received a page on his beeper from his niece, telling\r\nhim that his Suzuki had been spotted on Alva Street in Orangeburg.  After calling the sheriff's\r\noffice, Hamilton and his wife drove to Alva Street.  As they came down the street, a\r\nmotorcycle and a rider emerged from a side street.  Hamilton immediately recognized the\r\nmotorcycle as his Suzuki.\r\n\r\nThe Hamiltons followed the motorcycle down the street. Hamilton's wife recognized the rider\r\nas Thorn Williams after he turned around and faced the Hamiltons' car.  When Williams saw\r\nthe Hamiltons, he \"reared the bike up\" and \"took off,\" with its \"wheels spinning.\"  The\r\nHamiltons, in a Ford Explorer, gave pursuit, but Williams soon \"lost\" them.\r\n\r\nAfter again calling the sheriff's office, the Hamiltons circled back and drove to where\r\nWilliams lived on Alva Street with a woman who patronized the beauty shop owned by\r\nHamilton's wife.   Williams frequently visited the beauty shop.  The Hamiltons saw parked in\r\nWilliams's yard a white Oldsmobile with shiny hubcaps.  Hamilton's wife had seen Williams\r\ndriving it.  Motor vehicle records showed the car registered to Rhoda Williams, who lived\r\nwith Williams at the Alva Street address.\r\n\r\nWilliams came out of the residence, wearing a cap and a different shirt.  He had a large scrape\r\non his right forearm and had been bleeding.  It appeared to be a \"road rash,\" a type of wound\r\nthat could be caused by gravel damage suffered by one involved in a motorcycle wreck.\r\n\r\nFollowing his arrest a few days later, Williams gave a written statement in which he told of\r\ndriving three friends out to the Hamiltons' neighborhood and dropping them off.  He said he\r\nthought they were going to the house of one of his friend's mother.  Thirty minutes to an hour\r\nlater, however, they returned to his place on Alva Street with a motorcycle.  After his friends\r\nhad the motorcycle for, Williams said, \"about three days\" and no one came looking for it,\r\nWilliams \"figured it was a legal bike.\"  He admitted riding the motorcycle the day the deputy\r\nsheriff and the Hamiltons met him at his residence.\r\n\r\nThe Suzuki was not recovered. \r\n\r\nThere are five elements to the offense of possession of a stolen vehicle: (1) there must be a\r\nvehicle; (2) it must be stolen; (3) a person must possess the vehicle; (4) the person must not be\r\none entitled to its possession; and (5) the person possessing the vehicle must know it was\r\nstolen. (4)  Only the last element is at issue here.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence, albeit circumstantial, from which a jury could reasonably infer that\r\nWilliams knew the motorcycle was stolen. (5)   Soon after the Suzuki was stolen, he was seen\r\nwith it in his possession. (6)  Additionally, Williams took flight when he chanced upon the\r\nowner and his wife and realized they had spotted him riding it.  Indeed, he was in such a hurry\r\nto flee from the Hamiltons that he might have injured himself in the process. (7)  Under these\r\ncircumstances, it is little wonder that the jury, which it was free to do, (8) did not buy\r\nWilliams's statement that he did not think the motorcycle was stolen because no one came\r\ninquiring about it after a while.  Particularly is this so when one also considers that the friends\r\nwhom Williams drove in the early morning hours to the neighborhood in which the\r\nmotorcycle was stolen returned to his house within the hour with the motorcycle and that any\r\nexplanation as to how his friends came to have it that morning was notably absent from\r\nWilliams's statement.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n1.

Watson, Jr., of Greenwood, for respondents.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:  The Arnotis and the Campbells (collectively,  \"Neighbors\") brought this\r\naction against the Lukies to enforce a restrictive covenant prohibiting modular homes in their\r\nsubdivision.  The trial judge granted Neighbors an injunction, and the Lukies appeal.  We\r\naffirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties to this action all own lots in the Baywood Subdivision of Greenwood County. \r\nLots in the subdivision are subject to restrictive covenants, which provide in pertinent part: \r\n\"No modular homes or mobile homes are permitted in the subdivision.\"\r\n\r\nThe restrictive covenants were recorded in the office of the Clerk of Court for Greenwood\r\nCounty on May 31, 1991 at Deed Book 360, page 634.  The covenants contain a provision\r\nstating they are to remain in force \"unless an instrument signed by the then owners of three-fourths (3/4) of the lots is recorded, agreeing to change said covenants and restrictions in\r\nwhole or in part.\"  The covenants further provide all lot owners in the subdivision have the\r\nright to enforce compliance with the restrictions by seeking an injunction.\r\n\r\nIn May 1999, the Lukies purchased two adjacent lots in the Baywood Subdivision for\r\n$36,000.  The Lukies admittedly were given a copy of the restrictive covenants at the time\r\nthey purchased the lots, and they were aware of the prohibition on modular homes.\r\n\r\nThe Lukies considered having a \"stick built\" or \"site built\" home constructed on the larger of\r\nthe two lots, but discovered the price would be anywhere from $120,000 to $150,000. \r\nHowever, they found they could have a comparably-sized modular home (1) installed for around\r\n$75,000.  The Lukies decided to proceed with installing a modular home due to its lower cost.\r\n\r\nThe Lukies obtained a building permit on July 22, 1999.  Shortly  thereafter, the foundation\r\nwas poured and the home was delivered to the site for installation.  When Neighbors became\r\naware of the Lukies' plan to install a modular home, they brought this action for an injunction\r\nin August 1999. (2)  The day after the action was filed, Mr. Campbell personally delivered to\r\nMr. Lukie an envelope containing a copy of the complaint.  Mr. Lukie admits receiving the\r\nenvelope and taking it to his attorney, but states he never opened it.  The Lukies continued\r\ntheir work on the home although they knew this lawsuit was pending.\r\n\r\nAfter a bench trial, the judge concluded the Lukies' modular home violated the restrictive\r\ncovenants of the Baywood Subdivision.  The judge granted Neighbors' request for a\r\npermanent injunction and ordered the Lukies to remove the modular home by October 18,\r\n2001.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\nA suit seeking an injunction to enforce restrictive covenants is an action in equity. (3)  On\r\nappeal of an equitable action tried by the judge alone, this Court may take its own view of the\r\npreponderance of the evidence. (4) \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Lukies contend the trial judge erred in concluding their home was constructed\r\nin violation of the restrictive covenants, and that \"the balance of the equities\" requires reversal\r\nof the trial judge's ruling.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nAt the bench trial, Neighbors Ben Campbell and Peter Arnoti testified  they had purchased\r\nhomes in the Baywood subdivision valued in excess of $200,000.  Each stated that, although\r\nthey have no grievance personally against the Lukies, they seek enforcement of the restrictive\r\ncovenants in order to protect their investments as there are other persons desiring to install\r\nmodular homes and mobile homes on lots in the subdivision, and they will proceed if the\r\nrestrictive covenants are not enforced.  Arnoti, in particular, testified that he was \"more\r\nconcerned about more than one mobile home being out there than just one\" and that the\r\nprohibition on modular and mobile homes was a \"[v]ery important\" factor in his decision to\r\npurchase a lot in the Baywood Subdivision.  Both Campbell and Arnoti testified there are no\r\nother modular homes in the subdivision. \r\n\r\nMr. Lukie admitted that he was aware of the restrictive covenants at the time he purchased the\r\nlots, and he was aware of the prohibition on modular homes.   Mr. Lukie also acknowledged\r\nthat he continued with the installation of the home even though he had actual knowledge of\r\nthis lawsuit. \r\n\r\nMr. Lukie testified that he checked with the original developer of the subdivision, Abney\r\nWallace, who told him he personally had no objection to modular homes, but he had sold his\r\ninterest to \"Brothers and Harrison,\" a real estate company in Greenwood County.  After\r\nspeaking to Wallace, Mr. Lukie spoke to \"Dewey Brothers,\" which owned an interest, and\r\nthey purportedly had no objections to the modular home.  Mr. Lukie acknowledged at trial,\r\nhowever, that amendment of the restrictive covenants required the vote of three-fourths of the\r\nproperty owners, and conceded there was nothing in the covenants that gave the developers\r\nthe right to change the provisions of the restrictive covenants. \r\n\r\nThe trial judge concluded the injunction should be granted.  The judge found Neighbors built\r\ntheir homes in reliance upon the restriction that no modular homes or mobile homes would be\r\npermitted, and noted their concern that other individuals would proceed with plans to install\r\nsuch homes if the covenants were not enforced.  Although the judge acknowledged the Lukies\r\nwill suffer a severe hardship if they are required to remove their modular home, the judge\r\ndetermined Neighbors do not have an adequate remedy at law.  Further, the judge found the\r\nLukies had actual knowledge of the prohibition on modular homes at the time they purchased\r\ntheir lots and they proceeded with the installation of the modular home even though they knew\r\nNeighbors had filed this lawsuit seeking an injunction. \r\n\r\nThe judge additionally observed that Mr. Lukie is a member of the Board of Zoning Appeals\r\nin Greenwood County and, based on his position and experience on the Board, \"Mr. Lukie is\r\nwell aware that he has to comply with applicable rules and that he has to follow proper\r\nprocedures to obtain permission to vary from those rules.\"  The judge stated although the\r\nsubdivision developers apparently did not object to the Lukies' modular home, \"there is\r\nnothing in the restrictions which allows amendments or variances by a developer.  For that\r\nmatter, neither developer even owns a lot in the subdivision.\"  The judge observed,\r\n\"Amendments to the restrictions require the signed, written approval of the owners of three-fourths (3/4) of the lots.  The Defendants had no right to rely on any statements by the\r\ndevelopers concerning the installation of a modular home in violation of the restrictions.\"  The\r\njudge rejected Mr. Lukie's argument that the property values of Neighbors had not decreased\r\nafter the installation of his modular home, finding this fact was not determinative of whether\r\nNeighbors were entitled to relief because it was possible that Neighbors did not obtain the full\r\nincrease in value they would have otherwise received.  \r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Lukies assert the trial judge erred in finding their modular home violated the\r\nrestrictive covenants \"because under section 23-43-130 of the South  Carolina Code of Laws\r\n(Supp. 2000), their home is, in fact, a 'site-built' structure - a structure that is not expressly or\r\nimpliedly prohibited by the Restrictions.\"  The Lukies acknowledge this argument was never\r\nruled on by the trial judge, but maintain it was argued at trial and raised in their motion to alter\r\nor amend the judgment. \r\n\r\nInitially, we question whether this issue was preserved for review as Mr. Lukie admitted in his\r\ndeposition and at trial that the home was a modular home.  Although the Lukies did briefly\r\nassert at trial that section 23-43-130 required modular homes and mobile homes to be treated\r\nthe same as site-built homes, they never argued the home was, in fact, a site-built home.  \r\n\r\nIn any event, we find no merit to this assertion.  Section 23-43-130, part of the South Carolina\r\nModular Buildings Construction Act, provides in relevant part:  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Modular building units bearing evidence of approval must \r\n    be acceptable in all localities as meeting the requirements of this chapter \r\n    and must be considered and accepted equivalent to a site-built structure as \r\n    meeting the requirements of safety to life, health, and property imposed by \r\n    any ordinance of any local government if the units are erected or installed \r\n    in accordance with all conditions of the approval. (5)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude section 23-43-130 applies to the requirements imposed by local governments,\r\nprimarily for the purpose of ensuring compliance with safety requirements, and the statute\r\ndoes not prohibit homeowners from agreeing on private restrictive covenants.  Just as\r\nhomeowners can agree to be bound by certain design requirements that would never be\r\nimposed by governmental authorities, they may also, for reasons of aesthetics or the\r\nmaintenance of similar property values, contractually agree to restrict the installation of\r\nmodular homes that would otherwise comply with local building requirements.  Thus, the\r\nrestrictive covenants of Baywood Subdivision are not invalidated by section 23-43-130.  \r\n\r\nWe likewise reject the Lukies' contention that the restrictive covenants are ambiguous.  This\r\nargument is without merit as the covenants expressly state that modular homes and mobile\r\nhomes are prohibited, and the Lukies clearly understood this prohibition at the time they\r\npurchased their lots. (6) \r\n\r\nFinally, to the extent the Lukies argue \"the balance of the equities\" requires reversal, we agree\r\nwith the trial judge that, while removal of the completed home unfortunately will result in a\r\nhardship to the Lukies, it was caused by the Lukies' own actions in knowingly failing to either\r\ncomply with the restrictions of the subdivision or seek, through proper means, an amendment\r\nof the restrictions.  Accordingly, we affirm the trial judge's determination that the modular\r\nhome violates the restrictive covenants of the Baywood Subdivision and that Neighbors are\r\nentitled to a permanent injunction requiring removal of the modular home. \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n1.   According to Mr. Lukie, a modular home is built elsewhere and then transported to the\r\nowner's lot, where it is installed on top of a foundation that is poured at the home site. \r\n2.   Neighbors' complaint initially sought an injunction and damages, but they subsequently\r\nlimited their request to an injunction only. \r\n3.  Taylor v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nSellers suffered an admitted injury by accident on December \r\n  12, 1992, when he was involved in an automobile accident while working for Employer. \r\n  At the time of the accident, Sellers was sixteen years old and a high school \r\n  student. As a result of the accident, Sellers suffered injuries to his spine \r\n  and spinal cord which rendered him a paraplegic.\r\n\r\nOn March 15, 1993, Sellers signed a Form 15, which estimated \r\n  his average weekly wage at $100.00 and his compensation rate at the minimum \r\n  compensation rate of $75.00 pending further determination by the Commission. \r\n  Subsequently, on March 29, 1993, Ninkie Mack, a claims examiner with the Workers' \r\n  Compensation Commission calculated Sellers' average weekly wage from his employment \r\n  at Bojangles to be $40.74. On April 7, 1993, Mack calculated Sellers' average \r\n  weekly wage from his employment with Employer to be $92.24 resulting in a combined \r\n  average weekly wage from both part-time jobs of $132.98, giving Sellers a combined \r\n  compensation rate of $88.66.\r\n\r\nOn April 13, 1993, Sellers filed a Form 50 Request for a \r\n  Hearing alleging that Employer had failed to pay the proper compensation rate \r\n  and Sellers' average weekly wage had not been calculated. On May 11, 1993, Employer \r\n  filed a Form 51, Employer's Answer to Request for a Hearing, denying that Sellers' \r\n  average weekly wage had not been properly calculated. On May 15, 1993, Sellers \r\n  filed an Amended Form 50 also alleging that he was entitled to home renovations \r\n  to accommodate his paraplegia.\r\n\r\nThe hearing of these matters was set for August 2, 1993. \r\n  The parties appeared on that date and agreed to a continuance. Sellers also \r\n  submitted additional wage information from another part-time job with Winn-Dixie \r\n  Supermarket. On September 21, 1993, Mack calculated Sellers' average weekly \r\n  wage based on all three jobs Sellers had held during the year prior to his accident \r\n  and found the average weekly wage to be $136.55 with a compensation rate of \r\n  $91.04. Subsequent to this determination, Sellers signed another Form 15 Agreement \r\n  for Compensation providing for a compensation rate of $91.04. \r\n\r\nA hearing was held on Sellers' Form 50 and Employer's Form \r\n  51 on February 1, 1994. In his order, from which no appeal was taken, the single \r\n  commissioner noted that \"[t]he matters as to the Claimant[']s weekly compensation \r\n  benefits have been resolved.\" The only issue before the single commissioner \r\n  was that of renovations to Sellers' home.\r\n\r\nIn May of 1997, Sellers filed an additional Form 50 alleging \r\n  that exceptional reasons existed warranting an adjustment of his average weekly \r\n  wage and compensation rate to reflect the probable future wages he would be \r\n  earning but for his injuries. In response, Employer filed a Form 51 contending \r\n  that Sellers' compensation rate had been properly calculated and pleading res \r\n  judicata, collateral estoppel, laches and the statute of limitations as affirmative \r\n  defenses.\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner heard this matter in November of \r\n  1997. He rejected Employer's arguments that Sellers' claim for an adjustment \r\n  to his compensation rate was barred by the statute of limitations, res judicata, \r\n  estoppel or laches. The commissioner issued an order adjusting Sellers' average \r\n  weekly wage and compensation rate based on his future earning capacity as an \r\n  apprentice, journeyman, and master electrician. He provided for compensation \r\n  on the following graduated scale: from July 1, 1994 to December 31, 1994 compensation \r\n  at the rate of $148.87; from January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1995 compensation at \r\n  the rate of $182.75; from July 1, 1995 to December 31, 1995 compensation at \r\n  the rate of $184.09; from January 1, 1996 to June 30, 1996 compensation at the \r\n  rate of $220.11; from July 1, 1996 to December 30, 1996 compensation at the \r\n  rate of $235.31; from January 1, 1997 to June 30, 1997 compensation at the rate \r\n  of $249.99; from July 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997 compensation at the rate \r\n  of $264.66; from January 1, 1998 to June 30, 1998 compensation at the rate of \r\n  $292.67; from July 1, 1998 to June 30, 2002 compensation at the rate of $294.01; \r\n  and after June 20, 2002, compensation at the maximum rate for the year 1992 \r\n  at $379.82 continuing until further order of the commission.\r\n\r\nEmployer appealed this order to the full commission. On \r\n  June 8, 1998, the full commission affirmed the single commissioner with the \r\n  exception of the single commissioner's above ruling with regard to future earning \r\n  capacity. The full commission held there is no legal basis for speculation as \r\n  to the future earning capacity of Sellers. It then calculated Sellers' average \r\n  weekly wage based on a forty-hour work week, which he most likely would have \r\n  worked had he not been a full time student. The full commission further found \r\n  that Sellers was earning $4.35 per hour at the time of his accident and calculated \r\n  his average weekly wage at $174.00 with a compensation rate of $116.00.\r\n\r\nBoth parties appealed the full commission's decision to \r\n  the circuit court. The Honorable Paul Burch reversed the full commission and \r\n  remanded the case to the full commission. Employer appealed this order to the \r\n  Supreme Court. That appeal was assigned to this court. By order dated September \r\n  24, 1999, this court dismissed the appeal without prejudice so that the matter \r\n  could go to the full commission as ordered by Judge Burch.\r\n\r\nOn remand, the full commission reinstated the findings and \r\n  decision of the single commissioner. Employer appealed to the \r\n  circuit court. The Honorable Howard King found that he did not have the authority \r\n  to review the order of Judge Burch and, therefore, affirmed the order of the \r\n  full commission without prejudice to Employer's right to seek appellate review. \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn reviewing a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission, \r\n  this court will not set aside its findings unless they are not supported by \r\n  substantial evidence or they are controlled by error of law. See Lark \r\n  v. Bi-Lo, 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); Lyles v. Quantum Chem. \r\n  Co., 315 S.C. 440, 434 S.E.2d 292 (Ct. App. 1993); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) \r\n  (Supp. 2001). Substantial evidence is evidence that, in viewing the record as \r\n  a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion that the \r\n  full commission reached. Lark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306. The \r\n  possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \r\n  prevent the commission's findings from being supported by substantial evidence. \r\n  Tiller v. National Health Care Ctr., 334 S.C. 333, 513 S.E.2d 843 (1999).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nEmployer contends that the commission and the circuit court \r\n  erred in finding Sellers' request for an adjustment of his average weekly wage \r\n  and compensation rate to reflect his probable future wages was not barred by \r\n  the doctrines of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel. \r\n  (1) We disagree.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated Â§ 42-17-10 (1985) provides \r\n  in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  All such agreements shall be subject to adjustment and correction \r\n    as to the compensable rate if subsequent to filing with the Commission it \r\n    is determined that such rate does not reflect the correct average weekly wage \r\n    of the claimant. If approved by the Commission, the memorandum shall for all \r\n    purposes be enforceable by a court's decree as specified in this title.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commission promulgated a regulation preserving the right \r\n  of either the claimant or the employer to seek an adjustment of a temporary \r\n  total compensation rate. This regulation, in effect at the time of Sellers' \r\n  injury, provided:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A. The temporary total compensation rate recorded on a Form \r\n    15 or temporary partial compensation rate on a Form 16 entered into consent \r\n    is subject to adjustment and correction.\r\n\r\n  B. If it is determined that the compensation rate does not \r\n    reflect the claimant's correct average weekly wage, the employer's representative \r\n    may prepare an amended form reflecting the correct compensation rate. . . \r\n    .\r\n\r\n  C. If the employer's representative does not agree as in \r\n    section B above, the claimant may request a hearing. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-508 (1990) (repealed 21 S.C. Reg. \r\n  No. 6, pt. 2, eff. June 27, 1997).\r\n\r\n Regulation 67-508 clearly authorizes an adjustment in Sellers' \r\n  temporary total compensation rate as set forth in the Form 15. The commission \r\n  found Sellers' average weekly wage and temporary total compensation rate have \r\n  not been previously adjudicated in this claim. Although a hearing was scheduled \r\n  on this issue to be heard before the single commissioner on August 2, 1993, \r\n  the hearing was continued. The parties then resolved the issue and Sellers signed \r\n  another Form 15. The only issue before the single commissioner at the reconvened \r\n  hearing was that of the renovations to Sellers' home. We agree with the Commission \r\n  that Sellers' average weekly wage and temporary total compensation rate have \r\n  never been adjudicated. Accordingly, we find the doctrines of res judicata and \r\n  collateral estoppel do not bar an adjustment. \r\n\r\nEmployer argues there is no statutory authority for the \r\n  Commission to adjust Sellers' wages to provide for progressively higher wages \r\n  based upon probable future earnings. It asserts the average weekly wage must \r\n  be based upon prior earnings. We disagree. \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Annotated Â§ 42-1-40 sets forth several \r\n  different methods for calculating the average weekly wage. \r\n  (2) In the second paragraph of the statute, the legislature recognized \r\n  that these methods of calculation may not always be adequate. Accordingly, the \r\n  statute provides: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  When for exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair, \r\n    either to the employer or employee, such other method of computing average \r\n    weekly wages may be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the amount \r\n    which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-40 (1985).\r\n\r\nThe statute provides an elasticity or flexibility with a \r\n  view toward always achieving the ultimate objective of reflecting fairly a claimant's \r\n  probable future earning loss. Bennett v. Gary Smith Builders, 271 S.C. \r\n  94, 98, 245 S.E.2d 129, 131 (1978). \"The objective of wage calculation is to \r\n  arrive at a fair approximation of the claimant's probable future earning capacity. \r\n  His disability reaches into the future, not the past; his loss as a result of \r\n  injury must be thought of in terms of its impact on probable future earnings.\" \r\n  Id. at 98-99, 245 S.E.2d at 131; see Stokes v. First Nat'l Bank, \r\n  306 S.C. 46, 410 S.E.2d 248 (1991) (upholding an award where an employee's future \r\n  earning capacity was one of the factors the commissioner in deciding upon an \r\n  award).\r\n\r\nThe full commission committed an error of law in its original \r\n  order when it held there was no legal basis for speculating as to the future \r\n  earning capacity of the claimant. In its amended order, the full commission \r\n  adopted the single commissioner's order finding exceptional circumstance. Sellers' \r\n  age and the extent of his injury warrant this finding. The commission was clearly \r\n  authorized to consider Sellers' probable future earning capacity in determining \r\n  an average weekly wage that is \"nearly approximate the amount which [Sellers] \r\n  would be earning were it not for the injury.\"\r\n\r\nEmployer also argues that the commission should not have \r\n  considered any evidence of Sellers' future earnings because it was too speculative. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n\r\nAs the commission found, \"[b]ut for the severe injury, [Sellers] \r\n  clearly demonstrated the interest, aptitude, and ability to become an electrician. \r\n  At the time of his injury, Sellers was a full-time student and was working several \r\n  part-time jobs. He had worked with his father, who is an electrician, since \r\n  he was twelve years old. After the accident, he graduated from high school. \r\n  He attended technical college for two semesters but was unable to complete his \r\n  studies due to a lack a concentration caused by his head injury. Sellers testified \r\n  that his career plan before the accident was to become an electrician like his \r\n  father and uncles. He stated his goal was to become a master electrician. Larry \r\n  Bellamy, Sellers' father's former employer, testified that Sellers would accompany \r\n  his father to work and help. He stated, \"Sellers was very energetic. He wanted \r\n  to learn, unlike most kids these days. He had a very determined approach that \r\n  he wanted to learn the electrical trade, and follow pretty much and do the same \r\n  thing his dad was doing.\" \r\n\r\nThe Commission based the pay scale on the testimony of a \r\n  vocational expert. Employer offered no evidence to contradict this testimony.\r\n\r\nWe find substantial evidence in the record to support the \r\n  commission's determination that Sellers most probably would have been earning \r\n  and was thus entitled to a compensation rate of an electrician were it not for \r\n  his spinal cord injury. \r\n\r\n  AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.  Employer also argues in its statement \r\n  of the issues that the adjustment of the average weekly wage and compensation \r\n  rate is barred by the doctrine of laches. However, it does not argue this issue. \r\n  Accordingly, the argument is abandoned. See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, \r\n  314 S.C. 361, 444 S.E.2d 513 (1994) (issues not argued in the brief are deemed \r\n  abandoned and will not be considered on appeal).\r\n\r\n 2.  At the time of Sellers' injury, \r\n  this section provided,\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Average weekly wages\" means the earnings of the injured \r\n    employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury \r\n    during the period of fifty-two weeks immediately preceding the date of the \r\n    injury . . . divided by fifty-two. If the injured employee lost more than \r\n    seven consecutive calendar days at one or more times during such period, although \r\n    not in the same week, then the earnings for the remainder of such fifty-two \r\n    weeks shall be divided by the number of weeks remaining after the time so \r\n    lost has been deducted. When the employment prior to the injury extended over \r\n    a period of less than fifty-two weeks, the method of dividing the earnings \r\n    during that period by the number of weeks and parts thereof during which the \r\n    employee earned wages shall be followed, so long as results fair and just \r\n    to both parties will be obtained. Where, by reason of shortness of time during \r\n    which the employee has been in the employment of his employer or the casual \r\n    nature and terms of his employment, it is impracticable to compute the average \r\n    weekly wages as defined in this section, regard is to be had to the average \r\n    weekly amount which during the fifty-two weeks previous to the injury was \r\n    being earned by a person of the same grade and character employed in the same \r\n    class of employment in the same locality or community. \r\n\r\n\r\nS.C.

Carpenter and S. Elizabeth Brosnan, of Richardson, \r\n          Plowden, Carpenter &amp; Robinson, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.: \r\n  James Stewart brought this negligence action against Richland Memorial Hospital \r\n  (RMH) alleging the nurse on duty breached the professional standard of care \r\n  by removing his restraints and failing to monitor him, thereby providing substandard \r\n  care. Stewart appeals the jury verdict for RMH, asserting the trial court erred \r\n  in ruling that Stewart had to prove gross negligence in order to prevail and \r\n  therefore improperly charged the jury. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nWhile Stewart was in the hospital recovering from surgery, \r\n  a respiratory therapist went to his room to administer a breathing treatment \r\n  at approximately 12:15 a.m. Stewart was uncooperative and wanted to get out \r\n  of bed. As a result of his combative and agitated behavior, the nurse who was \r\n  assigned to care for Stewart that night placed him in four point restraints. \r\n  At 12:30 a.m., the nurse contacted Stewart's doctor, who ordered medication \r\n  changes and instructed her to continue the restraints. At 1:45 a.m., the nurse \r\n  noted Stewart was resting quietly and she continued to monitor him. At 2:45 \r\n  a.m., she noted Stewart was alert and responsive and released him from the restraints. \r\n  At some point between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., Stewart fell from his bed and \r\n  was discovered on the floor of his room around 7:00 a.m. \r\n\r\nLater that day, Stewart's doctor ordered an x-ray of his \r\n  knee and hip, which did not indicate any fractures or dislocation. Over a month \r\n  later, Stewart was diagnosed with a left hip fracture. His expert testified \r\n  that his hip fracture was likely caused by his fall at RMH. The trial judge \r\n  ruled that section 15-78-60(25) provided RMH with immunity unless gross negligence \r\n  was proven, and accordingly charged the jury that Stewart had to prove RMH was \r\n  grossly negligent in breaching the professional nursing standard of care. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Application of Tort Claims Act\r\n\r\nStewart argues the trial court erred in charging the jury \r\n  that the gross negligence standard under section 15-78-60(25) of the South Carolina \r\n  Tort Claims Act applied. Stewart contends this exception to sovereign immunity \r\n  does not apply because the nurse had a duty to render services consistent with \r\n  the professional standard of care and was not exercising a duty involving only \r\n  supervision, custody, control, or protection. We disagree. \r\n\r\nThe Tort Claims Act provides that the State, its agencies, \r\n  political subdivisions, and other governmental entities \"are liable for their \r\n  torts in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under \r\n  like circumstances,\" subject to certain limitations and exemptions within the \r\n  Act. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. 2001). Section 15-78-60 sets out exceptions \r\n  to this waiver of sovereign immunity, which act as limitations on the liability \r\n  of a governmental entity. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60 (Supp. 2001). Section 15-78-60 \r\n  (25) provides that a governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting \r\n  from the \"responsibility or duty including but not limited to supervision, \r\n  protection, control, confinement, or custody of any student, patient, prisoner, \r\n  inmate, or client of any governmental entity, except when the responsibility \r\n  or duty is exercised in a grossly negligent manner.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60(25) \r\n  (Supp. 2001) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain \r\n    and effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible.\" Strother v. Lexington \r\n    County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998). \r\n    \"If a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and \r\n    definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules of statutory interpretation \r\n    and the court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.\" Paschal \r\n    v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 436, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 15-78-60(25) specifically limits government liability \r\n  regarding the supervision, protection, and control of a patient. Stewart's complaint \r\n  alleges that the nurse violated the applicable standard of care by not properly \r\n  restraining Stewart and failing to adequately supervise him while \r\n  he was under her care at RMH. Clearly, RMH was exercising a duty involving the \r\n  supervision and control of Stewart when he fell out of his hospital bed. Because \r\n  the pleadings place the case squarely within the statutory language, the standard \r\n  of care was properly a question of law for the judge rather than a question \r\n  of fact for the jury. \"[T]he issue of interpretation of the statute is a question \r\n  of law for the court.\" Gorman v. S.C. Reinsurance Facility, 333 S.C. \r\n  696, 699, 511 S.E.2d 98, 100 (Ct. App. 1999). Therefore, the judge correctly \r\n  charged the jury under the gross negligence standard.\r\n\r\nBoth below and on appeal, Stewart urges that whether a hospital \r\n  is a private or governmental entity should not produce such a disparity in medical \r\n  malpractice cases, especially with the prevalence of public hospitals which \r\n  would then be subject to a lesser standard of care. Stewart cites Gardner \r\n  v. Biggart for the proposition that where an independent professional standard \r\n  of care applies, section 15-78-60(25) should be construed narrowly to apply \r\n  only to policies and procedures, lest an unrestricted interpretation swallow \r\n  all claims and absolve such entities of any liability. Gardner v. Biggart, \r\n  308 S.C. 331, 333-34, 417 S.E.2d 858, 859-60 (1992). The plain language of the \r\n  statute contains no such limitation, and we find Gardner's holding clearly \r\n  distinguishable from the present facts. Gardner injured his knee when the school \r\n  bus on which he was riding lurched forward. Our supreme court distinguished \r\n  an earlier case, Richardson, which applied the gross negligence standard \r\n  to the school's supervision, control, and protection of students in failing \r\n  to conduct random ID checks. Gardner at 334, 417 S.E.2d at 860; Richardson \r\n  v. Hambright, 296 S.C. 504, 374 S.E.2d 296 (1988). The supreme court set \r\n  forth the lynchpin for distinguishing when the higher standard will apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Here, the school bus driver was not exercising any \r\n    duty involving supervision, custody, control or protection at the time \r\n    of the accident. The mere fact that Gardner was in \"custody\" of the driver \r\n    as a passenger on the bus is insufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nGardner at 334, 417 S.E.2d at 860 (emphasis in original). \r\n  Here, the nurse was alleged to have improperly supervised, protected, controlled, \r\n  or confined Stewart, bringing this case squarely within the terms of the statute. \r\n  Contrary to Stewart's claims, this does not absolve the hospital of all liability \r\n  for any acts, only those coming within the terms of the statute. \r\n\r\nSection 15-78-70 (b) &amp; (c) specifically states the liability \r\n  of licensed physicians and dentists is not affected by the South Carolina Tort \r\n  Claims Act. The omission of any reference to a licensed nurse's standard of \r\n  care indicates that their liability is affected and, in this case, determined \r\n  by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act. \"'\"The enumeration of exclusions from \r\n  the operation of a statute indicates that the statute should apply to all cases \r\n  not specifically excluded. Exceptions strengthen the force of the general law \r\n  and enumeration weakens it as to things not expressed.\"'\" Riverwoods, LLC \r\n  v. County of Charleston, Op. No. 25462 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May&nbsp;6, \r\n  2002) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 14 at 58, 64) (quoting Hodges v. Rainey, \r\n  341 S.C. 79, 87, 533 S.E.2d 578, 582 (2000)).\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Burden of Proof  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nStewart also argues the trial court erred in failing to \r\n  instruct the jury that RMH bore the burden of proving it did not exercise its \r\n  duty to protect Stewart in a grossly negligent manner. We disagree. \r\n\r\nIn a negligence action, the plaintiff must establish a duty \r\n  of care, breach, and resulting damages. Arthurs ex rel. Munn v. Aiken, \r\n  346 S.C. 97,103, 551 S.E.2d 579, 582 (2001). As such, a plaintiff in a negligence \r\n  cause of action must prove all elements of that action, including the standard \r\n  of care. Although a governmental entity has the initial \"burden of establishing \r\n  a limitation upon liability or an exception to the waiver of immunity\" applies, \r\n  the plaintiff must still prove that the governmental entity has waived immunity. \r\n  Niver v. S.C. Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 302 S.C. 461, 463, \r\n  395 S.E.2d 728, 730 (Ct. App.1990). Thus, it was RMH's burden to establish that \r\n  the limitation on liability applied, and Stewart's burden to establish that \r\n  RMH exercised its responsibilities or duties in a grossly negligent manner. \r\n  Therefore, once RMH prevailed in asserting its affirmative defense, the judge \r\n  correctly charged the jury that the burden of proving gross negligence remained \r\n  on the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n\r\n    III. Strict Liability Charge  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, Stewart argues the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to instruct the jury that RMH had a duty to protect Stewart as a matter of law. \r\n  We disagree.\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, an appellate \r\n  court must consider the \"charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues \r\n  presented at trial.\" Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., \r\n  334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999). \"A jury charge is correct if \r\n  '[w]hen the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and \r\n  adequately covers the law.'\" Id. at 496, 514 S.E.2d at 574 (quoting State \r\n  v. Johnson, 315 S.C. 485, 487 n.1, 445 S.E.2d 637, 638 n.1 (1994)). A jury \r\n  charge which is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal. \r\n  Id. at 496-98, 514 S.E.2d at 575. The judge correctly and substantially \r\n  charged the professional nursing standard of care as well as charging plaintiff's \r\n  burden to prove gross negligence by defendant under the South Carolina Tort \r\n  Claims Act in breach of that standard. The trial court's instructions to the \r\n  jury adequately conveyed to the jury RMH's duty to protect Stewart.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3510","title":"State v.

Green appeals, arguing \r\n  the trial judge erred in denying his motions for directed verdict and judgment \r\n  notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV). We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of December 1, 1998, Alan Horton and Johnny \r\n  Goebel of the Beaufort County Narcotics Enforcement Team were patrolling undercover \r\n  on Lady's Island in an unmarked pickup truck. On Gumwood Drive, a small dirt \r\n  road, the officers observed two cars parked in opposite directions in the middle \r\n  of the road. Julius Green was driving one of the vehicles, a rented Chrysler \r\n  convertible. As Horton and Goebel approached, Green turned his car around and \r\n  began following the other vehicle. Both vehicles soon drove into a grassy area \r\n  between two homes; the officers pulled in behind.\r\n\r\nHorton exited the pickup and started walking toward the \r\n  two vehicles. According to Horton, by the time he reached the cars, \"Green is \r\n  running. He's at a full-out sprint, running to a clear-cut field right behind \r\n  where these two houses are where the car's [sic] parked.\" Horton did not identify \r\n  himself as a law enforcement officer at that point. Green continued to flee \r\n  but eventually stopped at a trash pile. As Horton later testified:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Green] stopped and he looked around on the ground. He was \r\n    right near a trash pile and he placed an object that I couldn't tell at that \r\n    time what it is, but he placed an object on the ground right next to that \r\n    trash pile and it was placed down on the ground very carefully. \r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing a short pause, Green fled again. Horton stopped \r\n  at the trash pile long enough to view a plastic bag containing a \"white powder \r\n  substance and white rock type substance,\" then resumed his chase and eventually \r\n  lost sight of Green. \r\n\r\nSeveral minutes later Goebel discovered Green, shirtless, \r\n  hiding in a garage. Horton placed him under arrest. Nearby, they found the clothes \r\n  Green had been wearing, a cellular telephone, $330.00 in cash, and a set of \r\n  car keys. The officers also seized a set of digital scales Green had thrown \r\n  on the ground by the convertible. Upon a search of the vehicle, Goebel and Horton \r\n  recovered small metallic hand scales and two Midland radios.\r\n\r\nThe police retrieved the bag that Green left at the trash \r\n  pile. Inside were eleven \"smoke-colored ziploc bags\" of what was later determined \r\n  to be powder cocaine weighing a total of 11.52 grams, a plastic bag containing \r\n  a 16.09-gram rock of crack cocaine, and thirty \"tiny ziploc bags,\" each containing \r\n  \"crack cocaine in the amount of 4.38 grams.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 11, 1999, a Beaufort County grand jury indicted \r\n  Green for trafficking in cocaine and crack cocaine and distribution of both \r\n  within one half-mile of a school. Following a trial on August 21, 2000, a jury \r\n  convicted Green on all charges, and the trial court sentenced him to four concurrent \r\n  ten-year terms of imprisonment. This appeal followed. \r\n   (1)\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict \r\n  in a criminal case, this Court views the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the State. State v. Huggins, 325 S.C. 103, 481 S.E.2d 114 (1997); \r\n  State v. Green, 327 S.C. 581, 491 S.E.2d 263 (Ct. App. 1997). The issue \r\n  is the existence or non-existence of evidence, not its weight. State v. Kelsey, \r\n  331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998); Green, 327 S.C. at 586, 491 S.E.2d at 265. \r\n  Accordingly, if there exists any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence \r\n  reasonably tending to prove guilt, the Court must find the motion was properly \r\n  denied. Kelsey, 331 S.C. at 62, 502 S.E.2d at 69; Huggins, 325 \r\n  S.C. at 110, 481 S.E.2d at 118.\r\n\r\nI. Fourth Amendment Violation\r\n\r\nGreen first argues the trial court erred in denying his \r\n  motions on all charges because the State obtained the evidence against him in \r\n  violation of the state and federal constitutions. This argument is not preserved, \r\n  as the record reflects no attempt by Green at trial to suppress any evidence \r\n  on constitutional grounds. Instead, Green attempted to raise the propriety of \r\n  the police actions in a motion for directed verdict, which was clearly improper.\r\n\r\n\"A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the \r\n  State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.\" State v. McHoney, \r\n  344 S.C. 85, 97, 544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001); see Rule 19(a), SCRE (\"[T]he court \r\n  shall direct a verdict in the defendant's favor on any offense charged in the \r\n  indictment after the evidence on either side is closed, if there is a failure \r\n  of competent evidence tending to prove the charge in the indictment.\"). A motion \r\n  for directed verdict, therefore, contests the sufficiency of the State's \r\n  properly admitted evidence. On the other hand, the appropriate vehicle \r\n  for challenging the admissibility of evidence based on an alleged search and \r\n  seizure violation is a motion to suppress. See generally Mapp v. Ohio, \r\n  367 U.S. 643 (1961) (holding the exclusionary rule barring admission of evidence \r\n  procured in violation of the Fourth Amendment applicable to the states).\r\n\r\nAt trial, Green did not move, either in limine or during \r\n  an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Blassingame, \r\n  (2) to suppress the evidence recovered by Horton and Goebel. Moreover, \r\n  he failed to object at any time to its admissibility; save for the evidence \r\n  pertaining to the Midland radios, the State's evidence, including the cocaine, \r\n  was introduced without objection. As a result, Green failed to preserve anything \r\n  for this Court to review. See State v. Brannon, 347 S.C. 85, 552 \r\n  S.E.2d 773 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding Fourth Amendment issue not preserved where \r\n  defendant failed to join in a motion to suppress); State v. Primus, 341 \r\n  S.C. 592, 603, 535 S.E.2d 152, 158 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"It is a fundamental principle \r\n  that a contemporaneous objection is required at trial to properly preserve an \r\n  error for appellate review.\").\r\n\r\nII. Sufficiency of Evidence Under \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445\r\n\r\nGreen next argues the trial court erred in refusing to direct \r\n  a verdict on the two counts of distribution of a controlled substance within \r\n  the proximity of a school. We disagree. \r\n\r\nAt the close of the State's case, Green moved for a directed \r\n  verdict on the ground that the State failed to prove Beaufort Academy was a \r\n  school. When all agreed the proof was lacking, the trial court permitted the \r\n  State to re-open its case and present testimony that Beaufort Academy is a school \r\n  offering education from kindergarten through twelfth grade. Green asserts this \r\n  was error. \r\n\r\nThe decision to permit the State to re-open its case and \r\n  present evidence lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. State \r\n  v. Humphery, 276 S.C. 42, 274 S.E.2d 918 (1981); State v. Hammond, \r\n  270 S.C. 347, 242 S.E.2d 411 (1978). Because proof that Beaufort Academy is \r\n  a school was an essential fact\r\n\r\nrelated to an element of each offense under Â§ 44-53-445, \r\n  the trial court did not err in allowing the State to re-open the evidence. See \r\n  Humphery, 276 S.C. at 43, 274 S.E.2d at 918 (\"The trial court did not \r\n  abuse its discretion in allowing the State to reopen and prove value - an essential \r\n  element of grand larceny.\"); State v. Harrison, 236 S.C. 246, 113 S.E.2d \r\n  783 (1960) (finding it within the trial court's discretion to permit reopening \r\n  and allow the State to offer evidence on an essential fact it was required to \r\n  prove).\r\n\r\nGreen further asserts the trial court should have directed \r\n  a verdict on the proximity charges because the State failed to prove he possessed \r\n  any controlled substances within one-half mile of any portion of Beaufort Academy \r\n  property actually used for school purposes. Section 44-53-445(A) provides in \r\n  pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is a separate criminal offense for a person to distribute, \r\n    sell, purchase, manufacture, or to unlawfully possess with intent to distribute, \r\n    a controlled substance while in, on, or within a one-half mile radius of the \r\n    grounds of a public or private elementary, middle, or secondary school \r\n    . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445(A) (2002) (emphasis added). \r\n\r\nAt trial, Scott Luallin, an employee of the Beaufort County \r\n  Emergency Management Department trained in the use of global positioning systems, \r\n  testified the distance from the trash pile to the property line of Beaufort \r\n  Academy was 300 feet. He also stated the distance from a spot 20 feet from the \r\n  front door of Beaufort Academy to the trash pile was 2,743 feet, and that a \r\n  half mile equals 2,640 feet.\r\n\r\nTo prove Green committed the offenses, the State was required \r\n  to establish that he possessed the powder and crack cocaine with an intent to \r\n  distribute while he was within a one-half mile radius of the grounds of an elementary, \r\n  middle, secondary or vocational school. See id.; Brown v. State, \r\n  343 S.C. 342, 540 S.E.2d 846 (2001). Green argues that because the State's evidence \r\n  failed to show he was within a one-half mile distance from the Beaufort Academy \r\n  school buildings, he was entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal. \r\n  According to Green, \"the clear intent of the [L]egislature in enacting Â§ 44-53-445(A) \r\n  was to prohibit the distribution of drugs within one-half mile of that portion \r\n  of the school regularly - or at least occasionally - used for school activities \r\n  and where it could reasonably be assumed students would be present.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\nA penal statute is construed strictly in favor of the defendant \r\n  and against the State. Brown, 343 S.C. at 348, 540 S.E.2d at 849. This \r\n  Court's primary purpose in construing a statute, however, is to ascertain the \r\n  intent of the Legislature. Id.; State v. Johnson, 347 S.C. 67, \r\n  552 S.E.2d 339 (Ct. App. 2001). In so doing, \"words must be given their plain \r\n  and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit \r\n  or expand the statute's operation.\" State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, \r\n  273, 403 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1991). When a statute's terms are clear and unambiguous, \r\n  they must be applied according to their literal meaning. Id.; Brown, \r\n  343 S.C. at 348, 540 S.E.2d at 850.\r\n\r\nSection 44-53-445 clearly and unambiguously prohibits distribution \r\n  of a controlled substance within a one-half mile radius of school grounds. \r\n  The term \"grounds,\" in common and ordinary usage, means the \"land surrounding \r\n  or attached to a house or other building.\" Webster's New World College Dictionary \r\n  627 (4th ed. 1999). We therefore find the term as used in Â§ 44-53-445(A) includes \r\n  all school-owned property contiguous to or surrounding the school's physical \r\n  plant. To hold otherwise would impermissibly expand the meaning of the statute's \r\n  clear terms. See Brown, 343 S.C. at 349, 540 S.E.2d at 850. \r\n  (3) \r\n\r\nMoreover, this construction is consistent with the purpose \r\n  and policy underlying drug-free \"safety zone\" statutes. See generally \r\n  28A C.J.S. Drugs &amp; Narcotics Â§ 275 (1996) (\"The purpose of such a \r\n  statute is not only to create a drug-free atmosphere on school grounds, but \r\n  also to create a permanent drug free buffer zone around these areas.\"). As the \r\n  New Jersey supreme court has noted:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Although the Legislature surely intended to prevent people \r\n    from selling drugs to and around school children, it also meant to ensure \r\n    \"that areas surrounding schools must be kept drug free if they are to serve \r\n    as the primary medium for educating young people as to the dangers of drug \r\n    use.\" The insulation of those children was to be complete and total. [I]t \r\n    is no defense that children were not present, school was not in session, or \r\n    that [the] defendant was unaware of his/her proximity to school property. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nState v. Ivory, 592 A.2d 205, 211 (N.J. 1991) (internal \r\n  citations omitted).\r\n\r\nBecause Green admits the evidence established the trash \r\n  pile was within one-half mile of the Beaufort Academy property line, the trial \r\n  court did not err in denying his motion for directed verdict on the proximity \r\n  charges. \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CONNOR, J., concur. \r\n\r\n1.  Although Green asserts eight separate \r\n  issues on appeal, they may be stated essentially as two arguments, i.e., whether \r\n  the trial court erred in refusing his motions for directed verdict because 1) \r\n  the evidence was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment and/or state \r\n  constitution and 2) the State failed to prove the necessary elements of S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445 (2002) regarding distribution within one-half mile of \r\n  a school. In addition, we note that Green's reference to his motions for JNOV, \r\n  a civil post-trial motion, is misplaced; in a criminal case, a new trial motion \r\n  \"is the only available post-trial motion addressing the sufficiency of evidence.\" \r\n  State v. Miller, 287 S.C. 280, 287 n.2, 337 S.E.2d 883, 887 n.2 (1985). \r\n  We address Green's arguments, however, because he also properly moved for a \r\n  new trial.  \r\n2.  See State v. Blassingame, \r\n  271 S.C. 44, 47-48, 244 S.E.2d 528, 530 (1978) (\"Whenever evidence is introduced \r\n  that was allegedly obtained by conduct violative of the defendant's constitutional \r\n  rights, the defendant is entitled to have the trial judge conduct an evidentiary \r\n  hearing out of the presence of the jury at this threshold point to \r\n  establish the circumstances under which it was seized.\") (emphasis added), modified \r\n  by State v.

Mahaffee, of Grimball &amp; Cabaniss, of \r\n  Charleston, for respondent Joe Doe.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: ReDonna Maxwell and her husband \r\n  appeal from an order of the Circuit Court denying their motion to restore their \r\n  case to the Circuit Court docket. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn March 17, 1995, ReDonna Maxwell was involved in an automobile \r\n  accident with Beverly Genez and John Doe. In April 1997, Maxwell and her husband \r\n  filed a complaint against Genez asserting various causes of action against her \r\n  arising from the accident. In February 1998, the complaint was amended to include \r\n  defendant Doe. Pursuant to Rule 40(j), SCRCP, the Maxwells moved to strike the \r\n  matter from the docket to allow for further discovery and additional time to \r\n  fully develop the issues of the case. On April 12, 1999, the Honorable A. Victor \r\n  Rawl signed an order granting the motion to strike the matter, which provided:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If the claim is restored upon motion made within one (1) \r\n    year of the date stricken, the statute of limitations shall be tolled as to \r\n    all parties during the time the case is stricken, and any unexpired portion \r\n    of the statute of limitations on the date the case was stricken shall remain \r\n    and begin to run on the date that the claim is restored. Upon motion to restore \r\n    this case, the moving party shall provide all parties with notice of the motion \r\n    to restore at least (10) days before it is heard. Upon being restored, this \r\n    case shall be placed on the General Docket and proceed from that date as provided \r\n    in Rule 40, SCRCP. \r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing issuance of this order, the parties engaged in \r\n  limited discovery and correspondence regarding ReDonna Maxwell's medical records \r\n  and injuries. The Maxwells, however, did not file a motion to restore the case \r\n  until May 1, 2000, more than a year from the date the case was stricken. On \r\n  May 15, 2000, the Maxwells filed a \"Notice of Motion and Motion for Enlargement \r\n  of Time\" pursuant to Rule 6(b), SCRCP. In a supporting memorandum, the Maxwells \r\n  argued Rule 6(b) authorized the Circuit Court to extend the time to restore \r\n  a case to the roster for \"good cause,\" which the Maxwells \r\n  maintained existed. The Maxwells' counsel submitted an affidavit stating that \r\n  because of changes in paralegals in her office, the due date of April 12, 2000, \r\n  for the motion to restore was not calendared and that she filed a motion to \r\n  restore immediately after discovering the omission by her staff.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Maxwells argued the defendants waived \r\n  the defense of the statute of limitations and were estopped from opposing the \r\n  motion to enlarge and restore because the defendants' conduct induced them to \r\n  believe that the motion to restore was merely an \"administrative/procedural \r\n  step\" to facilitate the parties' intention to continue the case until trial. \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe presiding circuit judge, the Honorable R. Markley Dennis, \r\n  Jr., denied the Maxwells' motion, finding the Maxwells failed to move to restore \r\n  the case within the one-year period as provided by Rule 40(j). Judge Dennis \r\n  further found he did not have the authority or discretion to enlarge the period \r\n  of time for filing because \"it is the long-standing rule in this State that \r\n  a Circuit Judge cannot modify or reverse an order of another Circuit Judge.\" \r\n  As a result of Judge Dennis' ruling, the applicable statue of limitations for \r\n  this action was not tolled.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Rule 6(b)/Rule 40(j)\r\n\r\nThe Maxwells contend Rule 6(b) allows the Circuit Court \r\n  to enlarge the time to file a motion to restore beyond the one year limitation \r\n  of Rule 40(j) for \"good cause,\" and that they established \"good cause\" for their \r\n  failure to timely file a motion to restore. \r\n\r\nRule 6(b), SCRCP states:\r\n\r\n\r\n  When by these rules or by notice given thereunder or by \r\n    order of court an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified \r\n    time, the time may be extended by written agreement of counsel for an additional \r\n    period not exceeding the original time provided in these rules, or the court \r\n    for cause shown may at any time in its discretion (1) with or without written \r\n    motion or notice order the period enlarged if request therefor is made before \r\n    the expiration of the period as originally prescribed or extended or (2) upon \r\n    motion made after the expiration of the specified period, for good cause shown, \r\n    permit the act to be done. The time for taking any action under \r\n    rules 50(b), 52(b), 59, and 60(b) may not be extended except to the extent \r\n    and under the conditions stated in them. The time for filing notice of intent \r\n    to appeal is jurisdictional and may not be extended by consent or order.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\"In interpreting the language of a court rule, we apply \r\n  the same rules of construction used in interpreting statutes. Therefore, the \r\n  words of [the rule] must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort \r\n  to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the rule.\" State v. Brown, \r\n  344 S.C. 302, 307, 543 S.E.2d 568, 571 (Ct. App. 2001) (quoting Green v. \r\n  Lewis Truck Lines, Inc., 314 S.C. 303, 304, 443 S.E.2d 906, 907 (1994)).\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no specific case in South Carolina addressing \r\n  the applicability of Rule 6(b) to a Rule 40(j) situation, this Court has ruled \r\n  that Rule 6(b) does apply in situations pertaining to extensions of time for \r\n  answering a complaint. Beckham v. Durant, 300 S.C. 329, 387 S.E.2d 701 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1989). Rule 6(b) authorizes the court to enlarge the period of time \r\n  in which an act is required to be performed under the rules of civil procedure \r\n  for \"good cause.\" Rules 50(b), 52(b), 59, and 60(b) are specified exceptions \r\n  listed in Rule 6(b). Rule 40(j) is not included in that list. Therefore under \r\n  the plain and ordinary meaning of Rule 6(b), the Circuit Court has the discretion \r\n  to enlarge the period of time for filing a motion to restore beyond one year \r\n  and to toll the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\nII. \"Good Cause\"\r\n\r\nWe agree with the Maxwells that Rule 6(b) is applicable \r\n  to motions filed pursuant to Rule 40(j). The appellants assert that \"good cause\" \r\n  is shown as to justify the restoration of their case to the docket. The official \r\n  notes to Rule 6(b) state that the \"good cause\" standard for enlargement is the \r\n  same standard applied in setting aside an entry of default pursuant to Rule \r\n  55(c), SCRCP. The seminal case articulating the application of \"good cause\" \r\n  under Rule 55(c) to a factual scenario is Wham v. Shearson Lehman Brothers, \r\n  Inc., 298 S.C. 462, 381 S.E.2d 499 (Ct. App. 1989). Wham provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Under S.C.R.Civ.P. 55(c), as under F.R.CIV.P. 55(c), the \r\n    standard for granting relief from an entry of default is \"good cause.\" \r\n    The decision of whether to grant relief from an entry of default is solely \r\n    within the sound discretion of the trial court. An order based on \r\n    an exercise of that discretion, however, will be set aside if it is controlled \r\n    by some error of law or lacks evidentiary support.\r\n\r\n  . . . . \r\n\r\n  In deciding the question of whether to grant the motion \r\n    by Shearson Lehman for relief from the entry of default, the master did not \r\n    employ the \"good cause\" standard. Instead, the master erroneously applied \r\n    the more rigorous standard of \"excusable neglect,\" a standard used under Rule \r\n    60(b). He did this even though he recognized the \"good cause\" standard \r\n    was applicable.\r\n\r\n  We therefore remand for redetermination by the master \r\n    the issue of whether Shearson Lehman should be relieved from the entry of \r\n    default. In determining this issue, the master, exercising a broader, more \r\n    liberal discretion than he otherwise would under Rule 60(b), shall consider \r\n    the following factors: (1) the timing of Shearson Lehman's \r\n    motion for relief; (2) whether Shearson Lehman has \r\n    a meritorious defense; and (3) the degree of prejudice to Wham if relief is \r\n    granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 465, 381 S.E.2d at 501-02 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nRule 55(c) should be liberally construed so as to promote \r\n  justice and dispose of cases on the merits. In re Estate of Weeks, 329 \r\n  S.C. 251, 495 S.E.2d 454 (Ct. App. 1997). The decision of whether to grant relief \r\n  from an entry of default is solely within the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  court. Wham, 298 S.C. at 465, 381 S.E.2d at 501; see  also \r\n  Pilgrim v. Miller, Op. No. 3435 (S.C.Ct.App. filed January 14, 2002) \r\n  (Shearouse Adv.Sh. No. 1 at 76); Ammons v. Hood, 288 S.C. 278, 341 S.E.2d \r\n  816 (Ct. App. 1986). An order based on this discretion will not be set aside \r\n  absent an error of law or lack of evidentiary support. Wham, 298 S.C. \r\n  at 465, 381 S.E.2d at 501; see also Stanton v. Town of Pawley's Island, \r\n  309 S.C. 126, 420 S.E.2d 502 (1992) (stating the appellate court will not disturb \r\n  a discretionary ruling unless the ruling is without evidentiary support or is \r\n  controlled by an error of law); Ricks v. Weinrauch, 293 S.C. 372, 360 \r\n  S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding abuse of discretion in setting aside a default \r\n  judgment occurs when order was controlled by some error of law or, based upon \r\n  factual -- as distinguished from legal conclusions -- was without evidentiary \r\n  support); New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Bey Corp., 312 S.C. 47, 435 S.E.2d \r\n  377 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\n\r\nWilliams v. Vanvolkenburg, 312 S.C. 373, 440 S.E.2d \r\n  408 (Ct. App. 1994), holds that the appellate court reviews an evidentiary record \r\n  under the \"good cause\" standard by determining whether the trial judge's determination \r\n  is supportable by the evidence and not controlled by an error of law. \r\n\r\nIndubitably, a \"good cause\" analysis under Rule 55(c) ordinarily \r\n  is made by the trial judge. In this case, the attorneys in oral argument consented \r\n  to a \"good cause\" analysis by this Court because the affidavit filed by the \r\n  Maxwells' attorney presented the evidentiary basis for \"good cause.\"\r\n\r\nAdverting to the merits, a \"good cause\" review of the evidentiary \r\n  record is necessary and essential. The Wham factors are addressed:\r\n\r\nA. Timing of the Moving Party's Motion \r\n  for Relief\r\n\r\nThe Maxwells' attorney filed the motion to restore the case \r\n  nineteen days late under the terms of the Rule 40(j) consent order. This brief \r\n  period reveals the action and response of the attorney was significant and prompt \r\n  upon discovering the failure to file the motion to restore within the proper \r\n  time. The reaction by the Maxwells' attorney to the consent order imbroglio \r\n  is imbued with alacrity and urgency. \r\n\r\nB. Whether the Moving Party has a \r\n  Meritorious Claim\r\n\r\nIt is apodictic that the Maxwells have a meritorious claim \r\n  because the record is convincing that discovery activities were substantial \r\n  and the medical condition of the injured plaintiff is well documented.\r\n\r\nC. Degree of Prejudice to the Other \r\n  party if Relief is Granted\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no prejudice suffered or sustained by \r\n  the two defendants in regard to the restoration of the case to the trial docket. \r\n  Extensive preparation activities for trial had been undertaken by the defendants. \r\n  There is no showing by the defendants that evidence is not available or has \r\n  been impaired by this brief delay or hiatus from the trial docket.\r\n\r\nIn her brief, Genez cites Dixon v. Besco Engineering, \r\n  Inc., 320 S.C. 174, 463 S.E.2d 636 (Ct. App. 1995), for the general proposition \r\n  that \"good cause\" does not exist to excuse a plaintiff's failure to timely move \r\n  to restore the case to the trial docket. Dixon is inapposite to the factual \r\n  scenario depicted in this record. In Dixon, a former employee of an engineering \r\n  company brought an action against the company, alleging the company's negligence \r\n  as a bailee caused the theft of the employee's machinist tools. The judge entered \r\n  a default against the company because it failed to answer the employee's complaint \r\n  until over seventy-five days after the extended time \r\n  agreed upon by the parties. The company attributed its delay to problems relating \r\n  to the retention of counsel willing to take the case. In the instant case, the \r\n  record demonstrates a markedly more expedited response on the part of the Maxwells' \r\n  attorney upon discovering the lapse in timely moving to restore the case.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Dixon does not address a motion to restore \r\n  a case to the docket under a Rule 40(j) consent order. There is no case in this \r\n  state relating to a \"good cause\" analysis under Rule 55(c) to a Rule 40(j) consent \r\n  order.\r\n\r\nIII. Waiver\r\n\r\nThe Maxwells argue Genez and Doe waived any opposition to \r\n  the motion to enlarge and restore the case, as well as asserting the statute \r\n  of limitations because of conduct the parties engaged in during the period the \r\n  case was stricken. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"Waiver is a voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment \r\n  of a known right.\" Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 333, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  241, 247 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Parker v. Parker, 313 S.C. 482, 443 \r\n  S.E.2d 388 (1994) and Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Property \r\n  Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 415 S.E.2d 384 (1992). \"Generally, the party claiming \r\n  waiver must show that the party against whom waiver is asserted possessed, at \r\n  the time, actual or constructive knowledge of his rights or of all the material \r\n  facts upon which they depended.\" Id. (quoting Janasik, 307 S.C. \r\n  at 344, 415 S.E.2d at 387-88).\r\n\r\nThe Maxwells contend the letters written by the attorneys \r\n  for Genez and Doe relating to discovery matters induced them to believe that \r\n  a motion to restore the case was merely a technicality and that all of the parties \r\n  intended to continue the case until trial. The correspondence of the parties, \r\n  however, involved routine discovery issues relating to medical records. We find \r\n  no evidence that either Genez or Doe indicated an intention to waive their rights \r\n  to assert the statute of limitations nor do we find any evidence the defendants \r\n  induced the Maxwells not to file a timely motion to restore.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold that Rule 6(b) is applicable to motions filed pursuant \r\n  to Rule 40(j). Rule 6(b) authorizes the court to enlarge the period of time \r\n  in which an act is required to be performed under the Rules of Civil Procedure \r\n  for \"good cause.\" The \"good cause\" standard for enlargement \r\n  of time is the same standard applied in setting aside an entry of default under \r\n  Rule 55(c), SCRCP. Here, the Maxwells' showing did constitute \"good \r\n  cause.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we REVERSE Judge Dennis' \r\n  denial of the Maxwells' Motion to Restore and Motion for an Enlargement of Time \r\n  and REMAND to the Circuit Court with instructions to \r\n  restore their case to the trial docket.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nCURETON, J., and THOMAS, Acting Judge, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3512","title":"Cheapo's v.

Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:  Chris Cloyd, United Oil Marketers, Inc., United Gaming (collectively\r\n\"appellants\") entered into an alleged settlement agreement with Cheap-O's Truck Stop, Inc.,\r\nand Midlands Gaming, Inc. (collectively \"respondents\").  The appellants appeal the circuit\r\ncourt's order enforcing the settlement agreement, finding Chris Cloyd in contempt, and\r\nawarding attorney's fees in the amount of $1,050.00.  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and\r\nremand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nCheap-O's Truck Stop, Inc. and Midland's Gaming, Inc., entered into various business\r\narrangements with Chris Cloyd, United Oil Marketers, Inc., and United Gaming.  Midlands\r\nGaming filed a complaint against Cloyd, United Oil Marketers, and United Gaming.  Cheap-O's filed a complaint against Cloyd and United Oil Marketers.\r\n\r\nThe Midlands Gaming case was called for trial on July 17, 2000 in Lexington County before\r\nJudge Kenneth Goode.  The Cheap O's case was scheduled to be heard the following week. \r\nThe attorneys struck the jury in preparation for trial.  Before the jury was sworn or opening\r\nstatements delivered, both cases were settled.  The parties put the settlement on the record and\r\nannounced to the court that the defendants would pay the plaintiffs $80,000.00, of which\r\n$60,000.00 would be paid immediately, and $20,000.00 would be paid within two weeks.  No\r\norder was signed in connection with this matter until August 15, 2000, when Judge Marc\r\nWestbrook signed a form order dismissing the case pursuant to Rule 43(k), SCRCP.\r\n\r\nCheap-O's and Midlands Gaming filed a petition to enforce the settlement.  In connection\r\nwith the petition, Judge Goode issued a rule to show cause on August 14, 2000, directing the\r\nappellants to show cause why the petition should not be granted.  On August 24, 2000, the\r\nSupreme Court issued an order vesting Judge Goode with concurrent jurisdiction in Lexington\r\nand Fairfield counties on August 24, 2000.  Judge Goode held the rule to show cause hearing\r\non that date in Fairfield County.\r\n\r\nJudge Goode subsequently entered an order on September 18, 2000, finding the settlement\r\nagreement complied with Rule 43(k) and enforcing it.  Judge Goode held Chris Cloyd in\r\ncontempt for refusing to comply with the settlement agreement, willfully disobeying a\r\nsubpoena, and willfully disregarding the court's order approving the settlement.  He also\r\nawarded attorney's fees in the amount of $1,050.00.  Cloyd, United Oil Marketers, and United\r\nGaming appeal.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION\r\n\r\nThe appellants argue the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to issue the rule to\r\nshow cause, conduct the rule to show cause hearing, and issue the order in connection with the\r\nrule to show cause.  They contend the circuit judge was required to exercise his judicial\r\npowers within the geographical boundaries of Lexington County.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court issued the following order in connection with the rule to show cause\r\nhearing:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pursuant to the provisions of S.C. CONST. Art. V, Â§ 4, IT \r\n    IS ORDERED that the Honorable Kenneth G. Goode be vested with jurisdiction \r\n    to hear and dispose of common pleas matters for Lexington County for the day \r\n    of August 24, 2000. The jurisdiction is concurrent with his previously scheduled \r\n    assignment to the term of the Court of Common Pleas for Fairfield County which \r\n    is otherwise unaffected by this Order.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nJEAN HOEFER TOAL, CHIEF JUSTICE\r\nBy: s/ Motte Talley\r\nMotte Talley, Assistant Director\r\nS.C. Court Administration\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\"The Chief Justice shall set the terms of any court and shall have the power to assign any\r\njudge to sit in any court within the unified judicial system.\"  S.C. Const. Art. V, Â§ 4.  Thus,\r\nthe order vests Judge Goode with jurisdiction for Lexington and Fairfield counties pursuant to\r\nthe power of the Chief Justice under article V of the South Carolina Constitution.\r\n\r\nJudge Goode heard this Lexington County matter on August 24, 2000, in Fairfield County. \r\nWe find the order does not require Judge Goode to travel to Lexington to hear the Lexington\r\nCounty matter.  He had jurisdiction in both counties concurrently.  Further, in its order the\r\ncircuit court stated, \"once the court recognized Mr. Quinn was raising a jurisdictional\r\nobjection it contacted the South Carolina Court Administration and received a directive to\r\nproceed with the Rule to Show Cause Hearing.\"\r\n\r\nII.  ATTORNEY CONFLICT OF INTEREST\r\n\r\nAppellants declare the respondents' attorney should have been disqualified from representing\r\nthe respondents in this suit.  They claim the attorney's law firm previously represented\r\nappellant United Oil Marketers, Inc., in a substantially similar matter.  We find this issue is\r\nmoot.\r\n\r\n\"An appellate court will not pass on moot and academic questions \r\n  or make an adjudication where there remains no actual controversy.\" Curtis \r\n  v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 567, 549 S.E.2d 591, 596 (2001) (citing Jackson \r\n  v. State, 331 S.C. 486, 489 S.E.2d 915 (1997)). \"Mootness has been defined \r\n  as follows: 'A case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical \r\n  legal effect upon existing controversy. This is true when some event occurs \r\n  making it impossible for the reviewing Court to grant effectual relief.'\" Byrd \r\n  v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 431, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1996) (quoting \r\n  Mathis v. S.C. State Highway Dep't, 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, \r\n  715 (1973)).\r\n\r\nBecause we find the present case was settled and the settlement \r\n  is enforceable, the issue is moot. See S. C. State Highway Dep't v. \r\n  McKeown Food Store No. 9, 254 S.C. 180, 183, 174 S.E.2d 342, 343 (1970) \r\n  (holding a settlement ended the litigation and rendered moot the issue on appeal); \r\n  Stevens v. Stevens, 272 S.C. 130, 130, 249 S.E.2d 744, 744 (1978) (holding \r\n  that as the result of a settlement entered into between the parties, all issues \r\n  were moot in the case except that involving attorney fees).\r\n\r\nIII.  ENFORCEABILITY OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in finding the agreement was enforceable under Rule\r\n43(k), SCRCP.  They aver the purported settlement agreement was not reduced to writing and\r\nthe agreement that is on the record does not contain material terms.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"No agreement between counsel affecting the proceedings \r\n  in an action shall be binding unless reduced to the form of a consent order \r\n  or written stipulation signed by counsel and entered in the record, or unless \r\n  made in open court and noted upon the record.\" Rule 43(k), SCRCP. Rule 43(k) \r\n  is applicable to settlement agreements. Ashfort Corp. v. Palmetto Constr. \r\n  Group, Inc., 318 S.C. 492, 494, 458 S.E.2d 533, 534 (1995). The purpose \r\n  of rules such as Rule 43(k) is to prevent fraudulent claims of oral stipulations, \r\n  to prevent disputes as to the existence and terms of agreements, and to relieve \r\n  the court of the necessity of determining such disputes. Reed v. Associated \r\n  Invs. of Edisto Island, Inc., 339 S.C. 148, 152, 528 S.E.2d 94, 96 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000) (citing Ashfort, 318 S.C. at 495, 458 S.E.2d at 535; 83 C.J.S. Stipulations \r\n  Â§ 4 (1953)). \r\n\r\nEven though the settlement agreement was not in writing, it complied with Rule 43(k) because\r\nit was made in open court and noted upon the record.  In announcing the settlement, the\r\nrespondents' attorney stated the following:\r\n\r\nYes, Sir.  The terms are as follows:  The defendants in those cases will pay to the plaintiffs in\r\nthose cases the sum of Eighty-Thousand Dollars ($80,000.00).  Sixty-Thousand Dollars\r\n($60,000.00) of that eighty will be paid immediately; twenty thousand will be paid within the\r\nnext two weeks.  So this week, we'll have sixty, the balance will be within the next two\r\nweeks.  There will be mutual releases, mutual orders for dismissals.  Neither party will - after\r\nthe payment of the eighty-thousand dollars, neither party owes anybody any money.  They are\r\ncompletely released from any liability to each other.  And the court can go ahead, if it would,\r\nand do a form order. \r\n\r\nThe dissent latches on to the fact that the administrative judge, not the trial judge, signed the\r\nForm 4 order.  However, the Form 4 order identified the settlement agreement by rule number. \r\nIt is purely a technical, legalistic review to conclude the settlement agreement is not\r\nencapsulated into the Form 4 order.  There is a direct correlation of the Form 4 order and the\r\nsettlement agreement placed on the record in open court.\r\n\r\nWe find the material terms of the settlement were read into the record and complied with Rule\r\n43(k).  Concomitantly, the settlement agreement is enforceable and binding.\r\n\r\nIV.  FORM 4 ORDER\r\n\r\nThe appellants maintain the circuit court erred in holding Chris Cloyd in contempt because\r\nthere was no final order.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nWe hold there is a final order in this case.  The appellants misconstrue and misperceive the\r\npotency of a Form 4 order.  In effect, the argument of the appellants negates practicality and\r\nplaces form over substance.\r\n\r\nFacially, factually and legally, the Form 4 order issued \r\n  by Judge Marc H. Westbrook is a FINAL ORDER. Absolutely nothing \r\n  remained to be done by the circuit judge after the signing of the order.\r\n\r\nThe Form 4 order provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHECK ONE:\r\n\r\n[  ] JURY VERDICT.  This action came before the court for a trial by jury.  The issues have\r\nbeen tried and a verdict rendered.\r\n\r\n[  ] DECISION BY THE COURT.  This action came to trial or hearing before the court. \r\nThe issues have been tried or heard and a decision rendered.\r\n\r\n  [X] ACTION DISMISSED. (CHECK \r\n    REASON): [ ]Rule 12(b), SCRCP; [ ] Rule 41(a), SCRCP (Vol. Nonsuit) [X] \r\n    Rule 43(k), SCRCP (Settled); [ ]Other_______________.\r\n\r\n  [ ] ACTION STRICKEN (CHECK REASON): \r\n    [ ] Rule 40(j) SCRCP; [ ] Bankruptcy; [ ]Binding arbitration, subject to right \r\n    to restore to confirm, vacate or modify arbitration award; [ ] Other________________.\r\n\r\nIT IS ORDERED AND ADJUDGED: [ ] See attached order;\r\n[ ] Statement of\r\nJudgment by the\r\nCourt:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDated at Lexington, South Carolina, this 15th day of August, 2000.\r\nThe diagonal line penned by the circuit judge through the space for additional writing or\r\nremarks denotes that no further action is forthcoming or contemplated.  There is no indicia or\r\ninference whatsoever to indicate that another order is necessary.  The dismissal under Rule\r\n43(k), SCRCP, is nexed directly to the settlement agreement placed on the record in open\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of practice and convenience, a Form 4 order \r\n  is used on a plethora of occasions as a FINAL ORDER. \r\n  IF the Form 4 order is NOT efficacious \r\n  as a final order, the circuit court will specifically and with certitude signify:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) a more formal order will be filed; OR\r\n\r\n  (2) the final order will be prepared by Attorney ___________; \r\n    OR\r\n\r\n(3) through the use of words and phrases what action will follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.  CONTEMPT\r\n\r\n\r\nContempt is historically and academically bifurcated by \r\n  courts. The case of Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 287 S.E.2d 915 (1982), \r\n  is a paradigm of an academic and scholarly review of the law of contempt. Curlee \r\n  edifies:\r\n\r\n\r\n  . . . The power to punish for contempt is inherent in \r\n    all courts. Its existence is essential to the preservation of order in judicial \r\n    proceedings, and to the enforcement of the judgments, orders and writs of \r\n    the courts, and consequently to the due administration of justice. McLeod \r\n    v. Hite, 272 S.C. 303, 251 S.E.2d 746 (1979); State v. Goff, 228 \r\n    S.C. 17, 88 S.E.2d 788 (1955). . . . Contempt results from the willful disobedience \r\n    of an order of the court, and before a person may be held in contempt, the \r\n    record must be clear and specific as to the acts or conduct upon which such \r\n    finding is based. Edwards v. Edwards, 254 S.C. 466, 176 S.E.2d 123 (1970); \r\n    Bigham v. Bigham, 264 S.C. 101, 212 S.E.2d 594 (1975).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . .     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Compensatory contempt is a money award for the plaintiff when the defendant has injured\r\nthe plaintiff by violating a previous court order.  The goal is to indemnify the plaintiff directly\r\nfor harm the contemnor caused by breaching the injunction.  Rendleman, Compensatory\r\nContempt: Plaintiff's Remedy When A Defendant Violates An Injunction, 1980 Ill.L.F. 971. \r\nCourts utilize compensatory contempt to restore the plaintiff as nearly as possible to his\r\noriginal position.  Therefore it is remedial.\r\n\r\n    We have recognized compensatory contempt in at least two \r\n    cases. In Ex Parte Thurmond, I Bailey 605 (1830), we stated that when an individual \r\n    right is directly involved in a contempt proceeding, the court has the power \r\n    to order the contemnor to place the injured party in as good a situation as \r\n    he would have been if the contempt had not been committed, or to suffer imprisonment. \r\n    In Lorick &amp; Lowrance v. Motley, 69 S.C. 567, 48 S.E. 614 (1904), \r\n    we held that a contemnor may be required to pay damages suffered by reason \r\n    of his contemptuous action or suffer imprisonment. The defendant was ordered \r\n    to pay to the plaintiff the value of the trees he had destroyed in disregard \r\n    of the court's order.\r\n\r\n        When . . . property of an individual is taken or destroyed in contempt of the court's order,\r\nthose interested have a right to ask of the court its restoration or payment of its value at the\r\nhands of the offender, and the court requires such restoration as part of the punishment.  49\r\nS.E. at page 615.\r\n\r\n          Compensatory contempt awards have been affirmed also by the United States Supreme\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n    Judicial sanctions in civil contempt proceedings may, \r\n    in a proper case, be employed for either or both of two purposes: to coerce \r\n    the defendant into compliance with the court's order, and to compensate the \r\n    complainant for losses sustained. Where compensation is extended, a fine is \r\n    imposed, payable to the complainant. Such fine must of course be based upon \r\n    evidence of complainant's actual loss. . . United States v. United Mine \r\n    Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 304-305, 67 S.Ct. 677, 701-702, 91 L.Ed. \r\n    884 (1947).\r\n\r\n            Therefore, the compensatory award should be limited to the complainant's actual loss. \r\nIncluded in the actual loss are the costs in defending and enforcing the court's order, including\r\nlitigation costs and attorney's fees.  The burden of showing what amount, if anything, the\r\ncomplainant is entitled to recover by way of compensation should be on the complainant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A determination of contempt ordinarily resides in the sound \r\n  discretion of the trial judge.\" State v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 129, \r\n  447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994)(citing Whetstone v. Whetstone, 309 \r\n  S.C. 227, 420 S.E.2d 877 (Ct. App. 1992)). \"It is well settled that contempt \r\n  results from willful disobedience of a court order; and before a person may \r\n  be held in contempt, the record must be clear and specific as to acts or conduct \r\n  upon which the contempt is based.\" Id. (citing State v. Harper, \r\n  297 S.C. 257, 376 S.E.2d 272; Spartanburg County Dep't of Social Services \r\n  v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 370 S.E.2d 872 (1988); Curlee v. Howle, \r\n  277 S.C. 377, 287 S.E.2d 915 (1982)). \"A willful act is defined as one done \r\n  voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law \r\n  forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires \r\n  to be done; that is to say with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the \r\n  law.\" Id. (citing Padgett, 296 S.C. at 82-3, 370 S.E.2d at 874).\r\n\r\nThe dissent attacks the basis for the order of contempt \r\n  by stating the \"fraudulent behavior\" is not included in the petition for contempt. \r\n  A cardinal rule of law in South Carolina edifies: \"When issues not raised in \r\n  the pleadings are tried by consent, they will be treated as if they had been \r\n  raised in the pleadings.\" McCurry v. Keith, 325 S.C. 441, 447, 481 S.E.2d \r\n  166, 169 (Ct. App. 1997). Unquestionably, the issue of the fraudulent conduct \r\n  of Cloyd was tried by consent.\r\n\r\nThe order of Judge Kenneth G. Goode states:\r\n\r\n\r\n  . . .  Mr. Cloyd acknowledged on the record the validity of the settlement amount.  He simply\r\nhas made no legitimate efforts to comply even though he admittedly had the power to comply\r\nat least in part.\r\n\r\n    I find and conclude that the Defendants have breached the settlement agreement.  In\r\naddition, they have . . .  willfully disregarded the Court's Orders approving the settlement. \r\nFurther, Mr. Cloyd's telephone call to Mrs. Worrell is an act of bad faith and I find and\r\nconclude it was simply an attempt to evade a lawful obligation at the expense at [sic] either\r\nthe IRS or Attorney Moore.\r\n\r\nI find and conclude that the excuses provided by Mr. Cloyd for his noncompliance are\r\nbaseless.  Further, there is no legitimate explanation as to the proposals made in the telephone\r\ncall he placed to Mrs. Worrell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are convinced of the validity of the ruling of the circuit judge holding Cloyd in contempt. \r\nThe evidentiary record justifies the contempt finding.  Clearly, Cloyd is in contempt of court.\r\n\r\nVI.  SANCTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Attorney's Fees\r\n\r\nIn Harris-Jenkins v. Nissan Car Mart, Inc., 348 S.C. \r\n  171, 557 S..E.2d 708 (Ct. App. 2001), our Court analyzed civil contempt as juxtaposed \r\n  to the award of attorney's fees. Harris-Jenkins explicates:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Courts, by exercising their contempt power, can award \r\n    attorney's fees under a compensatory contempt theory. Compensatory contempt \r\n    seeks to reimburse the party for the costs it incurs in forcing the non-complying \r\n    party to obey the court's orders. See Poston v. Poston, 331 \r\n    S.C. 106, 114, 502 S.E.2d 86, 90, (1998) (\"In a civil contempt proceeding, \r\n    a contemnor may be required to reimburse a complainant for the costs he incurred \r\n    in enforcing the court's prior order, including reasonable attorney's fees. \r\n    The award of attorney's fees is not a punishment but an indemnification to \r\n    the party who instituted the contempt proceeding.\") Lindsay v. Lindsay, \r\n    328 S.C. 329, 345, 491 S.E.2d 583, 592 (Ct. App. 1997)(\"A compensatory contempt \r\n    award may include attorney fees.\") (citation omitted); Curlee v. Howle, \r\n    277 S.C. 377, 386-87, 287 S.E.2d 915, 919-20 (1982)(\"Compensatory contempt \r\n    is a money award for the plaintiff when the defendant has injured the plaintiff \r\n    by violating a previous court order. .... Included in the actual loss are \r\n    the costs of defending and enforcing the court's order, including litigation \r\n    costs and attorney's fees.\").\r\n\r\n\r\nThe award of attorney's fees in this case is proper and justified.  The amount of the attorney's\r\nfees, if anything, is extremely low.\r\n\r\nB.  Fine\r\n\r\nThe fine imposed by the circuit judge is Twenty Five Thousand and No/100 ($25,000.00)\r\nDollars.  Any component of a sanction must be directly related to the contemptuous conduct\r\nand the loss incurred by the offended party.  There is no reasonable relationship to the\r\ncontempt of the defendants and the imposition of a Twenty Five Thousand and No/100\r\n($25,000.00) Dollar fine.  We reverse the fine imposed.\r\n\r\nC.  Incarceration\r\n\r\nIncarceration under certain factual circumstances may be \r\n  included as a component of civil contempt. Strict parameters should be placed \r\n  on the use of incarceration as a part of civil contempt. In Harris-Jenkins \r\n  v. Nissan Car Mart, Inc., 348 S.C. 171, 557 S.E.2d 708 (Ct. App. 2001), \r\n  this Court enunciated the constitutional concernment of the use of imprisonment \r\n  under the aegis and ambit of civil contempt. Harris-Jenkins annunciates:\r\n\r\n\r\n  We note and emphasize that South Carolina law does not \r\n    permit a person to be held in contempt for failure to pay a civil debt, which \r\n    has arisen solely out of a contractual obligation. Sanders v. Sanders, \r\n    30 S.C. 229, 9 S.E. 97 (1889). Furthermore, the Constitution of South Carolina \r\n    provides \"[n]o person shall be imprisoned for debt except in cases of fraud.\" \r\n    S.C. Const. art. I Â§19; see also Carter v. Lynch, 429 F.2d 154 (4th \r\n    Cir. 1970); Stidham v. DuBose, 128 S.C. 318, 121 S.E. 791 (1924).\r\n\r\n\r\nIncarceration should never be imposed due to the simplistic failure of an individual to pay a\r\ncivil debt.  Additionally, imprisonment is not authorized for the failure to comply with a\r\nsettlement agreement in the absence of fraud or bad faith.\r\n\r\nVII.  REMAND\r\n\r\n\r\nWe affirm the award of attorney's fees.  However, the severity of the sanctions imposed by\r\nway of fine or possible incarceration is troubling.  Consequently, we reverse the imposition of\r\nthe fine and possible incarceration.  Because we conclude the circuit judge may impose a fine\r\nand incarceration in this scenario, we remand to the circuit judge for the purpose of reviewing\r\nthe imposition of reasonable sanctions for contempt as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) ascertain with exactitude the financial condition of the defendants; and\r\n\r\n  (2) evaluate defendants' contumacious conduct under the \r\n    general principles of Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 287 S.E.2d 915 \r\n    (1982), and Shillitani v. U.S., 384 U.S. 364, 86 S.Ct. 1531, 16 L.Ed.2d \r\n    622 (1966); and\r\n\r\n(3) impose sanctions that are directly and proximately connected to Cloyd's contemptuous\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrrefutably, sanctions should be imposed upon Cloyd.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the circuit court judge is AFFIRMED IN PART and\r\nREVERSED IN PART.  We REMAND for consideration of an appropriate contempt\r\nsanction.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, Acting Judge, concurs.\r\n\r\nCURETON, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCURETON, J., Dissenting:  I respectfully dissent.  I would reverse the finding of contempt\r\nand the award of attorney fees.\r\n\r\nI do not dispute that the Form 4 order is a final order of the court; however, I find the Form 4\r\norder did not incorporate the terms of the settlement, thereby making the settlement agreement\r\nan enforceable order of the court.  The settlement was announced in open court and noted\r\nupon the record.  In announcing the settlement, the respondents' attorney stated the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, Sir.  The terms are as follows:  The defendants in those cases will pay to the plaintiffs in\r\nthose cases the sum of Eighty-Thousand Dollars ($80,000.00).  Sixty-Thousand Dollars\r\n($60,000.00) of that eighty will be paid immediately; twenty thousand will be paid within the\r\nnext two weeks.  So this week, we'll have sixty, the balance will be within the next two\r\nweeks.  There will be mutual releases, mutual orders for dismissals.  Neither party will - after\r\nthe payment of the eighty-thousand dollars, neither party owes anybody any money.  They are\r\ncompletely released from any liability to each other.  And the court can go ahead, if it would,\r\nand do a form order.\r\n\r\n\r\nA review of the exchange between the attorneys and the circuit \r\n  court indicates that no one contemplated that the settlement agreement would \r\n  be incorporated into the court's order and made an order of the court. There \r\n  was no request by the attorneys that the court approve the agreement, nor was \r\n  there a request for the terms of the settlement to be made into a final order \r\n  of the court. In fact the Form 4 order dismissing the case from the roster was \r\n  not even signed by the judge who presided over court the day the settlement \r\n  was read into the record. Instead, the Form 4 order was prepared by the chief \r\n  administrative judge as a ministerial function- the effect of which was to dismiss \r\n  the case. \r\n\r\nIn the present case, Cloyd violated no court order inasmuch \r\n  as the form order signed by the court on August 15, 2000, merely served to remove \r\n  the case from the docket. While Cloyd may have failed to comply with the terms \r\n  of an enforceable settlement agreement, he was not in violation of any specific \r\n  court order. Therefore, the court did not have authority to hold him in contempt. \r\n  \"A determination of contempt ordinarily resides in the sound discretion of the \r\n  trial judge.\" State v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, \r\n  217 (Ct. App. 1994) (citing Whetstone v. Whetstone, 309 S.C. 227, 420 \r\n  S.E.2d 877 (Ct. App. 1992)). \"It is well settled that contempt results from \r\n  willful disobedience of a court order; and before a person may be held in contempt, \r\n  the record must be clear and specific as to acts or conduct upon which the contempt \r\n  is based.\" Id. (citations omitted). \"A willful act is defined as one \r\n  done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something \r\n  the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law \r\n  requires to be done; that is to say with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard \r\n  the law.\" Id. (citing Spartanburg Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, \r\n  296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874).\r\n\r\nThe circuit court also included language in its order for \r\n  contempt regarding appellants' possible fraudulent behavior in attempting to \r\n  circumvent the settlement agreement. I note the language of the petition for \r\n  contempt and the rule to show cause did not encompass an allegation of fraud. \r\n  Accordingly, I find notice was not given to the appellants that they would be \r\n  called upon to defend this allegation, and therefore, this matter was not properly \r\n  before the circuit court. See Abbott v. Gore, 304 S.C. 116, 119, \r\n  403 S.E.2d 154, 156 (Ct. App. 1991) (due process requires that a litigant be \r\n  placed on notice of the issues which the court will consider to afford the litigant \r\n  an opportunity to be heard); Bass v. Bass, 272 S.C. 177, 180, 249 S.E.2d \r\n  905, 906 (1978) (footnote omitted) (requiring a litigant be placed on notice \r\n  of the issues which the court is to consider). Moreover, because I find that \r\n  the Form 4 order does not make a violation of the terms of the settlement agreement \r\n  enforceable by contempt, the appellants behavior toward the respondents is irrelevant \r\n  as it pertains to the ability of the court to punish for such behavior. The \r\n  appellants' alleged behavior can not constitute a basis for contempt.\r\n\r\nI would also reverse the circuit court's award of attorney \r\n  fees to the respondents. I recognize that in a civil contempt proceeding, a \r\n  contemnor may be required to reimburse a complainant for the costs he incurred \r\n  in enforcing the court's prior order, including reasonable attorney's fees. \r\n  See Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 114, 502 S.E.2d 86, 90 (1998). \r\n  However, having concluded the court erred in finding Cloyd in contempt, I find \r\n  no support for the award of attorney's fees. See Harris-Jenkins v. \r\n  Nissan Car Mart, 348 S.C. 171, 176-79, 557 S.E.2d 708, 710-12 (Ct.

Nichols, of Bluestein &amp; Nichols, of Columbia, \r\n  for respondents.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: The Newberry County Tax Assessor \r\n  (Assessor) appeals from a circuit court order affirming the Administrative Law \r\n  Judge's (ALJ) valuation of property at $269 per waterfront foot. We affirm. \r\n  (1)\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn 1996 Howitt and Hazeleen Smith, purchased a lot and two \r\n  thirds of an adjoining lot located in Summerset Bay development on Lake Greenwood \r\n  for $76,000. The Smiths testified that they knew $76,000 was higher than the \r\n  amount paid for the most attractive lot in the development, but they were not \r\n  concerned because they purchased their property for sentimental reasons and \r\n  were not interested in resale.\r\n\r\nFor the 1999 tax year, Assessor valued the Smiths' property \r\n  at $85,800. To reach this figure, she conducted a mass appraisal analyzing the \r\n  resale information for lots contained within Summerset Bay during 1997 and 1998. \r\n  (2) After reviewing the resale values, she determined that the information \r\n  showed an annual 4% upward trend in lakefront property values and arrived at \r\n  a value of $350 per waterfront foot. The $350 valuation fell within the Department \r\n  of Revenue standards and the Department of Revenue approved the valuation. Assessor \r\n  then multiplied the Smith's 258 feet (3) of waterfront \r\n  by $350 per foot to arrive at $85,800.\r\n\r\nThe Smiths appealed Assessor's valuation to the Newberry County Tax\r\nAppeals and Review Board.  The Board accepted the value offered by\r\nAssessor and denied any change to the valuation of the property.  The\r\nSmiths then sought review of the Board's decision in front of an ALJ.\r\n\r\n   The Smiths' independent appraiser, Scott Wishart, testified at the ALJ\r\nhearing that he assessed the value of the property by using the fee appraisal\r\nmethod and conducting a market sales comparison approach. (4) Wishart\r\nstated that he identified properties comparable to the Smiths' property\r\nwithin the Summerset Bay development.  The properties had similar deed\r\nrestrictions, they had over 200 feet of waterfront property, and the\r\nproperties had been sold within 6 to 12 months of the date of his appraisal. \r\nThree lots met this criteria.\r\n\r\nWishart testified that the most important component in using a market\r\nsales comparison approach is making adjustments to the value of the \r\ncomparable properties to approximate the value of the property appraised.\r\nWishart stated Comparables 1 and 2 did not require any adjustments and\r\nComparable 3 required a $100 per foot upward adjustment to compensate\r\nfor its inferior view.  After reviewing the sales of the three comparable\r\nproperties, Wishart valued the Smiths' property at $61,000 based upon a\r\n$246 per waterfront foot figure multiplied by 248 feet of waterfront\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nWishart also performed a regression analysis and found that when a\r\nproperty has more than 200 feet of waterfront, the price per foot decreases\r\nto the $240 to $250 range.  Wishart offered the regression analysis at the\r\nALJ hearing as additional evidence to support his $246 per waterfront foot\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nThe ALJ rejected Assessor's value and found that the Smiths' market sales\r\nappraisal was the most accurate evidence of the property's market value\r\nbecause \"no individual evaluation was made of the Taxpayers' property,\"\r\nand \"[t]he taxpayers' property was not among the lots evaluated for the\r\nmass appraisal.\"  The ALJ found that Wishart's Comparable 3 was the best\r\nreflection of the value of the Smiths' property; however, he rejected\r\nWishart's $100 per square foot adjustment and used a $120 upward\r\nadjustment from Comparable 3.  This resulted in a finding of the value for\r\nthe Smiths' property of $269 per waterfront foot.  The ALJ's assessment of\r\nthe value of the Smiths' property was $66,712 (248 waterfront feet times\r\n$269 per waterfront foot).\r\n\r\nThe Newberry County Tax Assessor appealed the ALJ's findings to the\r\ncircuit court.  The circuit court affirmed the ALJ's decision and dismissed\r\nthe case.  Assessor appeals.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\n\r\nAssessor argues the ALJ lacked the ability to decide the case at the time of\r\nthe hearing because the Smiths failed to present all of their evidence\r\nsupporting their appraisal value before the county board.  We disagree.  A\r\ntaxpayer who is aggrieved by the Assessor's valuation of his property may\r\nappeal the assessment value to the County Board of Assessment Appeals\r\nand then to the ALJ Division.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-60-2530 through 12-60-2540 (2000).  Section 12-60-2540(B) reads in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (B) . . . . If the taxpayer failed to provide the county \r\n    board with the facts, law, and other authority supporting his position, he \r\n    shall provide the representative of the county at the hearing with the facts, \r\n    law, and other authority he failed to present to the county board earlier. \r\n    The [ALJ] shall then remand the case to the county board for reconsideration \r\n    in light of the new facts or issues unless the representative of the county \r\n    at the hearing elects to forego the remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAssessor argues that when the Smiths presented Wishart's \r\n  regression analysis as evidence supporting his $246 appraisal value for the \r\n  first time at the hearing in front of the ALJ, the ALJ should have remanded \r\n  the matter back to the County Board of Appeals. After reviewing the record, \r\n  we find that Assessor failed to object to the admission of evidence or ask the \r\n  ALJ to remand the matter back to the County Board. Thus, we believe Assessor \r\n  elected to forgo the remand. Moreover, because there was no objection to the \r\n  admission of this testimony, we find this issue is not properly preserved. Holy \r\n  Loch Distribs., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 \r\n  (2000) (\"In order to preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must \r\n  have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.\").\r\n\r\nII.  ALJ's Valuation of the Property\r\n\r\nAssessor next challenges the circuit court's order affirming the ALJ's\r\ndecision on three grounds.  First, Assessor argues the ALJ lacked the\r\nability to select $269 per waterfront foot as the proper value because\r\nneither expert testified that the value of the property should be assessed at\r\n$269 and, if the ALJ chose to ignore the expert's proposed values, he\r\nshould have used the purchase price of the property as the fair market\r\nvalue.  Second, she claims there was no substantial evidence in the record\r\nto support the ALJ's $269 figure.  Lastly, Assessor argues that the ALJ\r\nerred when he ruled the market sales comparison approach was the proper\r\nvaluation method.\r\n\r\nA.  Standard of Review\r\n\r\nThe case reached the ALJ as a request for judicial review \r\n  of the County Board of Assessment Appeals decision upholding Assessor's valuation. \r\n  When a tax assessment case reaches the ALJ in this posture, the proceeding in \r\n  front of the ALJ is a de novo hearing. See Reliance Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Smith, 327 S.C. 528, 534, 489 S.E.2d 674, 677 (Ct. App. 1997) (\"[A]lthough \r\n  a case involving a property tax assessment reaches the ALJ in the posture of \r\n  an appeal, the ALJ is not sitting in an appellate capacity and is not restricted \r\n  to a review of the decision below. Instead, the proceeding before the ALJ is \r\n  in the nature of a de novo hearing.\").\r\n\r\nThis court must affirm an administrative agency's decision \r\n  if the decision is supported by substantial evidence and we may not substitute \r\n  our judgment for that of the agency upon questions for which there is room for \r\n  difference of intelligent opinion. Byerly Hosp. v. South Carolina State Health \r\n  &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Comm'n, 319 S.C. 225, 229, 460 S.E.2d 383, 385-86 \r\n  (1995). \"Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, but evidence \r\n  which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach \r\n  the conclusion the agency reached.\" Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture, \r\n  317 S.C. 306, 309, 454 S.E.2d 320, 321 (1995).\r\n\r\nB.  ALJ's Authority to Select Value of Property\r\n\r\n   Assessor first argues that the ALJ should have selected either her $350\r\nfigure as the correct value per waterfront foot, or Wishart's $246 value\r\nbecause they are the only experts in this matter.  Alternatively, if the ALJ\r\nfailed to accept the experts' valuations, he should have used the purchase\r\nprice as the fair market value for the property.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nIn City of Folly Beach v. Atlantic House Props., Ltd., \r\n  318 S.C. 450, 458 S.E.2d 426 (1995), the City's appraiser testified the value \r\n  of Atlantic House's interest in the property was $31,000 while Atlantic House's \r\n  appraiser testified the value was $642,000. The jury selected $250,000 as the \r\n  proper value. The supreme court held the jury was free to determine the value \r\n  of the property within the range of the evidence presented at trial. Id. at \r\n  452-53, 458 S.E.2d at 427. \"The record reflects both appraisers encountered \r\n  difficulty in determining the value of the property because of the unique nature \r\n  of Atlantic House's [property]. We find no error in the jury finding the value \r\n  to be $250,000. The unique nature of the property coupled with expert testimony \r\n  as to its value allowed the jury to determine the fair market value of the property \r\n  within the range of the evidence presented at trial.\" Id. \r\n\r\nAlthough the present case does not involve condemnation, \r\n  we find the analysis of City of Folly Beach instructive. When the Smiths \r\n  purchased all of lot 46 and two-thirds of lot 47 and combined them into one \r\n  property, they created a new piece of property which had never before been valued \r\n  in the market. Both appraisers testified regarding the difficulty of assessing \r\n  the value of an individual piece of property. The ALJ functioned as the finder \r\n  of fact and his value fell within the range of values presented by the experts. \r\n  Therefore, we find no error in the ALJ's valuation.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we find no merit to Assessor's argument that \r\n  the ALJ should have used the purchase price paid by the Smiths as the fair market \r\n  value when he rejected the experts' values. While the purchase price of the \r\n  property is some evidence of the fair market value, it is not conclusive. Belk \r\n  Dep't Stores v. Taylor, 259 S.C. 174, 179, 191 S.E.2d 144, 146 (1972). Therefore, \r\n  the ALJ was not bound by the price paid by the Smiths. The Smiths testified \r\n  they paid more for their property because of sentimental reasons, and also made \r\n  decisions regarding the property which would not be normal in the marketplace \r\n  because they were not concerned with the investment value of the property.\r\n\r\nC.  Substantial Evidence in the Record to Support ALJ's Findings\r\n\r\n   Assessor next argues the circuit court erred in affirming the ALJ's\r\nvaluation because there was no substantial evidence to support his\r\ndecision.  We disagree.  The ALJ based his valuation on the price per\r\nwaterfront foot value from Comparable 3.  He added $120 to the price as\r\nan upward adjustment to compensate for Comparable 3's inferior sight line,\r\nwhile Wishart adjusted its price upward only $100 per waterfront foot. \r\nAssessor argues the ALJ had no basis to independently consider the value\r\nof Comparable 3 or to adjust upward by $120.\r\n\r\nAssessor's and Wishart's respective values of $350 and $246 formed the\r\nrange of values.  Comparable 3 was the only one of Wishart's three\r\ncomparable properties involving a sale between two parties which was\r\nclearly an arm's length transaction.  Wishart's adjustment of the value of\r\nComparable 3 by $100 to compensate for the inferior sight line provided\r\nthe basis for the ALJ to adjust the value of the property.  We find\r\nsubstantial evidence existed in the record to support the ALJ's finding. \r\nThe adjustment fell within the range of values presented by the experts. \r\nSince Comparable 3 was the only property sold which was unquestionably\r\nan arm's length transaction, the ALJ did not err by basing the  Smiths'\r\nproperty value upon its adjusted value.  Wishart provided the basis for the\r\nALJ to make his upward adjustment to compensate for the inferior sight\r\nline of Comparable 3.\r\n\r\nD.  Use of Market Sales Comparison Approach\r\n\r\nAssessor lastly argues the ALJ lacked substantial evidence in the record to\r\nuse a market sales comparison approach as opposed to the mass appraisal\r\napproach and the circuit court erred when it affirmed the ALJ's decision. \r\nWe disagree.  Wishart testified that the only way to assess the fair market\r\nvalue at that particular time was using a market sales comparison\r\napproach.  Mrs. Smith, also a licensed appraiser, testified that to accurately\r\nassess the fair market value of the subject property, an assessor must use\r\ncomparable properties and make adjustments to compensate for the\r\ndifferences in the land.  Even Assessor acknowledged that property could\r\nbe valued using a fee appraisal approach.  Considering that all three\r\nappraisers who testified during the hearing acknowledged the validity of\r\nusing the market sales comparison approach, we find there was substantial\r\nevidence in the record to support the ALJ's decision to value the Smiths'\r\nproperty using that approach.  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err\r\nwhen it affirmed the ALJ's findings.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and HOWARD, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n1. We affirm this case without oral argument \r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2. A mass appraisal method is one that \r\n  looks at the sales from a region to determine the value per square foot and \r\n  applies that value to the square footage of the assessed property. \r\n3. A later appraisal revealed that the \r\n  Smith's actually had 248 feet of waterfront instead of 258 feet. \r\n4. A fee appraisal is a method that looks \r\n  at the resale value of the individual parcel alone to determine its fair market \r\n  value. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3514","title":"BB&amp;T v.

Branch Banking \r\n  and Trust Company of South Carolina (\"BB&amp;T\") appeals the master-in-equity's \r\n  order finding John H. Franklin's recorded mortgage constitutes a first lien \r\n  on certain commercial property, which Brian and Lisa Kidwell (collectively \"the \r\n  Kidwells\") purchased from Franklin, and awarding Franklin prejudgment interest. \r\n  BB&amp;T also appeals the master's failure to award it attorney fees. We affirm \r\n  in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1999, the Kidwells applied for a loan with BB&amp;T to \r\n  finance the purchase of commercial property which the Kidwells had contracted \r\n  to buy from Franklin for $135,000. The Kidwells executed a Buy and Sell Agreement \r\n  (\"Agreement\") with Franklin, which listed the selling agent, David Allen, and \r\n  indicated the only financing for the property would be \"conventional.\" Following \r\n  an appraisal of the property, BB&amp;T approved a $100,000 loan. The Kidwells \r\n  selected the closing attorney. BB&amp;T then sent a letter to the closing attorney \r\n  stating it required a first lien on the property as a precondition of the loan.\r\n\r\nPrior to closing and without informing BB&amp;T, Lisa Kidwell \r\n  and Franklin executed an Addendum to the Agreement in which Franklin agreed \r\n  to finance $85,000 of the $135,000 purchase price. Allen acquired a copy of \r\n  the HUD Settlement Statement (\"the Statement\"), prepared in connection with \r\n  the sale, several days prior to the closing and reviewed it for errors. The \r\n  Statement denominated the Kidwells as \"Borrowers\" and BB&amp;T as \"Lender\" and \r\n  reflected BB&amp;T's $100,000 mortgage on the property. In addition, the Statement \r\n  showed an $85,000 balance due to Franklin as \"Seller.\" BB&amp;T did not receive \r\n  a copy of the Statement until pretrial discovery was conducted.\r\n\r\nThe closing occurred on November 5, 1999, with Franklin, \r\n  Allen, and the Kidwells present. No one from BB&amp;T attended. The Kidwells \r\n  executed two mortgages, one to BB&amp;T for $100,000 and one to Franklin for \r\n  $85,000. According to the Statement, signed by Franklin and the Kidwells, Franklin \r\n  received $45,102.65 in cash from the closing, in addition to a note and mortgage \r\n  from the Kidwells for $85,000, and the Kidwells received $42,325.84 in cash \r\n  from the BB&amp;T loan proceeds. The Kidwells also purchased other property \r\n  from Franklin.\r\n\r\nFollowing the closing, the closing attorney provided BB&amp;T \r\n  with a Preliminary Title Opinion dated November 8, 1999. The opinion indicated \r\n  the Kidwells now owned the property, listed no unexpected exceptions, and did \r\n  not mention any other mortgage liens or judgments.\r\n\r\nBoth BB&amp;T's mortgage and Franklin's mortgage were recorded \r\n  in Spartanburg County at 1:07 p.m. on November 9, 1999, in REM Book 2277. However, \r\n  BB&amp;T's mortgage was indexed beginning at page 321, and Franklin's mortgage \r\n  was indexed beginning at page 326.\r\n\r\nIn January 2000, the Kidwells procured a $25,000 business \r\n  credit line from BB&amp;T. Before approving the loan, BB&amp;T required an update \r\n  on the status of the property's title. The same closing attorney prepared a \r\n  Preliminary Title Opinion dated January 28, 2000. The letter noted the property \r\n  was encumbered by Franklin's $85,000 mortgage. The attorney subsequently provided \r\n  BB&amp;T with a Final Title Opinion dated March 15, 2000, certifying that BB&amp;T's \r\n  mortgage constituted a valid first lien on the property, subject only to the \r\n  exceptions listed in the Preliminary Title Opinion dated November 8, 1999. Ultimately, \r\n  BB&amp;T issued the $25,000 credit line, obtaining a second mortgage on the \r\n  commercial property as collateral.\r\n\r\nThe Kidwells did not make payments as required on either \r\n  BB&amp;T mortgage. In June 2000, BB&amp;T accelerated both mortgages, demanding \r\n  payment, and then filed suit seeking foreclosure of its mortgages, claiming \r\n  first and second lien positions.\r\n\r\nBB&amp;T named Franklin as a party-defendant. Franklin answered \r\n  and counterclaimed, alleging his $85,000 mortgage constituted a first lien on \r\n  the property. He also sought foreclosure, an award of attorney fees, and a deficiency \r\n  judgment against the Kidwells. In reply, BB&amp;T raised several equitable defenses \r\n  including waiver, estoppel, and unjust enrichment.\r\n\r\nFollowing a trial, the master concluded the Kidwells were \r\n  liable to both BB&amp;T and Franklin. The master found the Kidwells owed BB&amp;T \r\n  $106,065.24 for the purchase mortgage and $26,285.44 for the credit line mortgage, \r\n  plus accruing interest, costs, and $3,500.00 in attorney fees. The master further \r\n  determined the Kidwells owed Franklin $85,000 on his mortgage, an advance for \r\n  taxes, plus $4,000 in attorney fees and costs. The master also held Franklin \r\n  was entitled to prejudgment interest at the legal rate, beginning on August \r\n  1, 2000.\r\n\r\nAlthough the master determined both BB&amp;T and Franklin \r\n  had properly secured their loans by executing mortgages on the Kidwells' property, \r\n  he held Franklin's mortgage constituted the first priority lien. In reaching \r\n  his decision, the master held the mortgage statute was \"of no assistance in \r\n  determining the priority\" of the liens because both mortgages bore the identical \r\n  time and date of recording. Therefore, he considered whether BB&amp;T or Franklin \r\n  had notice of the other's intent to obtain a first priority lien on the Kidwell's \r\n  property.\r\n\r\nThe master held none of the documents executed by any of \r\n  the parties provided Franklin with notice of BB&amp;T's intent to obtain a first \r\n  priority mortgage. He concluded the only persons involved in the transaction \r\n  aware that both BB&amp;T and Franklin sought first priority mortgages on the \r\n  property were the Kidwells and the closing attorney. The master imputed the \r\n  closing attorney's knowledge of Franklin's mortgage to BB&amp;T on the theory \r\n  that the closing attorney acted as BB&amp;T's agent in the closing because the \r\n  closing attorney prepared mortgage documents and rendered a title opinion for \r\n  BB&amp;T.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the master concluded BB&amp;T had notice of Franklin's \r\n  lien, but Franklin did not have notice of BB&amp;T's lien. Based on this conclusion, \r\n  the master ruled Franklin's mortgage priority was superior to BB&amp;T's. This \r\n  appeal followed. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAn action to foreclose a real estate mortgage is an action \r\n  in equity. Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 248, 489 \r\n  S.E.2d 472, 475 (1997). In an action in equity, this Court is not required to \r\n  disregard the findings of the master or referee. However, this Court may take \r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Taylor v.

Furthermore, \r\n  this Court is not bound by the trial court's legal conclusions. I'On, L.L.C. \r\n  v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 718-19 (2000); \r\n  see also S.C.

Priority Lien Status\r\n\r\nOn appeal, BB&amp;T argues the master erred by finding Franklin's \r\n  mortgage lien priority was superior to its own. We agree.\r\n\r\nWe note this is a novel issue in this State. This Court \r\n  has not discovered, nor has either party to this appeal cited, any case in which \r\n  the appellate courts of this State have been asked to determine the priority \r\n  of multiple mortgages, secured with the same property, at the same time, by \r\n  different parties. Furthermore, although South Carolina Code Annotated section \r\n  30-7-10 (Supp. 2001) does not expressly address the particular facts and circumstances \r\n  of this case, we do not agree with the master's conclusion that it is useless \r\n  in determining priority between mortgages.\r\n\r\nSection 30-7-10 provides, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  All . . . mortgages . . . are valid so as to affect the \r\n    rights of subsequent creditors . . . without notice, only from the day and \r\n    hour when they are recorded in the office of the register of deeds [for the \r\n    county] . . . in which the real property affected is situated. In the case \r\n    of a . . . subsequent lien creditor . . . without notice . . . the priority \r\n    is determined by the time of filing for record.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, South Carolina Code Annotated section 30-9-40 \r\n  (Supp. 2001), governing the indexing of instruments filed for recording, provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The register of deeds . . . shall immediately upon the filing \r\n    for record of any deed, mortgage, or other written instrument of the character \r\n    mentioned in Section 30-7-10 or Chapter 9 of Title 36 enter it upon the proper \r\n    indexes in his office, which constitute an integral, necessary, and inseparable \r\n    part of the recordation of the deed, mortgage, or other written instrument \r\n    for any and all purposes whatsoever . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of proper recording practices as an integral \r\n  part of providing notice to subsequent creditors has been previously addressed \r\n  by our supreme court. In National Bank of Newberry v. Livingston, our \r\n  supreme court held:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The rule supported by the best authority is that the record \r\n    [of a mortgage] is constructive notice to creditors . . . [as to] such facts \r\n    as they would have learned from the record, if examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    . . . \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A mortgage duly recorded is notice not only of the existence \r\n    of the mortgage, but of all its contents . . . . It is notice not only to \r\n    purchasers but to the subsequent creditors as well . . . . The record imparts \r\n    notice of all the facts which could have been ascertained by an actual examination \r\n    thereof, including not only those recited in the record, but also material \r\n    matters suggested thereby, which might be disclosed by reasonable inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n155 S.C. 264, 284, 152 S.E. 410, 417-19 (1930) (citations \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\nThe indexing of recorded mortgages is intended to provide \r\n  notice to persons making subsequent inquiries. There is no evidence the register \r\n  of deeds has not complied with the mandates of section 30-9-40 in recording \r\n  these two mortgages. Therefore, the later indexing of Franklin's mortgage, established \r\n  by the later page entry, is evidence that BB&amp;T's mortgage was presented \r\n  first for recordation and is entitled to priority as the first to be recorded. \r\n  See Atlas Supply Co. v. Davis, 273 S.C. 392, 395, 256 S.E.2d 859, \r\n  860 (1979) (Littlejohn, J., concurring) (indicating lien priority is based on \r\n  the time at which an instrument is recorded and that recording is accomplished \r\n  when an instrument is indexed). This inference is especially proper where the \r\n  same closing attorney controlled both documents and presented them for recordation.\r\n\r\nThe master held BB&amp;T, through the closing attorney, \r\n  had constructive notice of Franklin's mortgage. Conversely, the master concluded \r\n  the attorney was not Franklin's agent, and Franklin had no such notice of BB&amp;T's \r\n  mortgage. We disagree with the conclusion that Franklin had no notice of BB&amp;T's \r\n  lien.\r\n\r\nWhile the documents prepared and executed by or on behalf \r\n  of BB&amp;T do not expressly note its expectation of a first lien on the property, \r\n  the record before us belies any assumption Franklin issued his mortgage without \r\n  prior notice of BB&amp;T's mortgage. The Agreement executed by Franklin and \r\n  the Kidwells specifically conditioned the transaction on the Kidwells' ability \r\n  to obtain \"conventional\" financing for the purchase. Both the Addendum executed \r\n  by Lisa Kidwell and Franklin, as well as the HUD Statement signed by Franklin, \r\n  indicated \"Seller\" financing.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the closing statement fully informed Franklin \r\n  that BB&amp;T was extending a loan to the Kidwells in the amount of $100,000 \r\n  to purchase property with a contractually established value of $135,000. The \r\n  subsequent contract modification provided in excess of $42,000 to the Kidwells \r\n  to facilitate their purchase of other property from Franklin, but in doing so, \r\n  placed a combined indebtedness encumbering the property of $50,000 in excess \r\n  of the value of the property. Under these circumstances, we do not share the \r\n  master's belief that the bank was as informed as Franklin of this transaction. \r\n  Thus, we deem any constructive notice BB&amp;T may have had regarding Franklin's \r\n  mortgage was no greater than Franklin's actual notice of BB&amp;T's mortgage.\r\n\r\nIn light of the expressed gravity of the requirement that \r\n  recorded documents be properly indexed and absent proof to the contrary, we \r\n  presume the filing authority complied with the mandates set forth in section \r\n  30-9-40. Reading the requirements of section 30-7-10 in conjunction with the \r\n  mandates of section 30-9-40 establishes that, in the case of documents recorded \r\n  on the same date and at the same time, legal priority be given to document indexed \r\n  first. We conclude from the contract, the Addendum, the closing documents, and \r\n  the remaining transactions with the Kidwells, that Franklin was fully aware \r\n  of BB&amp;T's mortgage lien. Accordingly, we hold the master erred in giving \r\n  Franklin's mortgage first lien priority.\r\n\r\nII. Prejudgment Interest\r\n\r\nBB&amp;T next argues the trial court erred in awarding Franklin \r\n  prejudgment interest on his mortgage because the mortgage agreement itself indicates \r\n  a zero percent interest rate. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"Prejudgment interest is allowed on obligations to pay money \r\n  from the time when payment is demandable, either by agreement of the parties \r\n  or by operation of law, if the sum is certain or capable of being reduced to \r\n  certainty.\" Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 101, 478 S.E.2d \r\n  45, 51 (1996). The record clearly reveals Franklin's mortgage was for a sum \r\n  certain and payable on August 1, 2000. These facts alone, irrespective of any \r\n  interest rate chargeable prior to the demand date, entitle Franklin to prejudgment \r\n  interest at the legal rate. Therefore, we find the master did not err in awarding \r\n  prejudgment interest to Franklin.\r\n\r\nIII. Order Of Payment\r\n\r\nBecause we find BB&amp;T has a first lien priority, its \r\n  $100,000 mortgage and all associated costs and fees, including attorney fees \r\n  according to the terms of the mortgage agreement, must be paid first from the \r\n  proceeds of the property's sale. See Dedes v. Strickland, 307 \r\n  S.C. 155, 160, 414 S.E.2d 134, 137 (1992) (\"[W]here there is a contract providing \r\n  for such, the amount of attorneys fees is governed by the contract.\"). Following \r\n  the satisfaction of BB&amp;T's mortgage, fees and costs, Franklin is entitled \r\n  to any surplus funds sufficient to satisfy his mortgage, fees, and associated \r\n  costs.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe remand this case to the master for recalculation of the \r\n  total sums due BB&amp;T and Franklin. Furthermore, we direct both BB&amp;T's \r\n  and Franklin's mortgages be foreclosed in accordance with this opinion. For \r\n  the foregoing reasons, the master's order is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\n  (2)\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concurring. \r\n1.  After the master's order was filed, \r\n  BB&amp;T obtained an order staying the public sale of the property. Thus, the \r\n  sale remains stayed and the debts remain unliquidated. \r\n2.  Because oral argument would not aid \r\n  the Court in resolving any issue on appeal, we decide this case without oral \r\n  argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3515","title":"State v.

Davis was convicted of two counts ABHAN, possession of a weapon, \r\n  and conspiracy. After reading the verdicts and hearing arguments, the trial \r\n  judge granted Garrett's new trial motion. We reverse and remand for sentencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn April 1997, Paul Anthony France and Joseph Michael Chiappone \r\n  were stationed together at Shaw Air Force Base. One evening, they went to a \r\n  car wash to install fog lights on France's car. While working \r\n  on the car, Chiappone noticed a \"blue or dark colored Bronco or Blazer\" slowly \r\n  passing the car wash. Shortly after that, a man appeared and pointed a gun at \r\n  Chiappone, then pushed him to the ground. Chiappone's attacker went through \r\n  his pockets and took several items, including his wallet. Chiappone did not \r\n  see his attacker's face, but he noticed another set of feet on the other side \r\n  of the car. As Chiappone was attacked, France was pulled from the car and pushed \r\n  to the ground. An assailant placed his foot on France's neck and another rifled \r\n  through his pockets, taking his wallet among other items.\r\n\r\nAfter robbing Chiappone and France, the assailants forced \r\n  them into the trunk of France's car. One of the assailants drove France's car \r\n  away from the car wash, and the other got into a different vehicle. From inside \r\n  the trunk, France used a lighter to manipulate his tail lights in an attempt \r\n  to signal for help. Unbeknownst to France, the car behind them was the second \r\n  assailant. The second vehicle then rammed into the back of France's car.\r\n\r\nThe individual driving France's car stopped in a field along \r\n  with two other vehicles. The assailants questioned Chiappone and France about \r\n  the tail lights. When neither of them responded to the questioning, they were \r\n  forcibly removed from the trunk, separated, beaten by at least two assailants \r\n  each, forced to remove their clothing, and then forced back into the trunk.\r\n\r\nAs they drove, the victims could feel France's car colliding \r\n  with the other vehicles. France's car became disabled. The victims were again \r\n  taken out of the trunk and forced to the ground. France heard several voices, \r\n  and he guessed from the assailants' conversation that two of them wanted to \r\n  leave immediately and one wanted to shoot them. The assailants urinated on the \r\n  victims, then shot them in the buttocks. One of them threatened to return in \r\n  five minutes to \"finish off\" the victims, and the assailants drove away in the \r\n  sports utility vehicle. France and Chiappone found the keys to France's car \r\n  and drove to a nearby home where a resident called the police and an ambulance.\r\n\r\nAlthough neither victim could identify their assailants, \r\n  police began an investigation and eventually identified Garrett as a suspect. \r\n  (1) Garrett was tried with Davis as a co-defendant. \r\n\r\nAt trial, Desmond Cunningham testified he was with Garrett, Davis, and\r\nAndre China on the night of the crime.  The four men were at Garrett's\r\nhome and decided go out.  Cunningham and Davis rode in a black Blazer. \r\nGarrett and China left in Garrett's car.  Cunningham saw Garrett and China\r\napproach the victims and force them into France's trunk.  As they left the\r\ncar wash, China drove the sedan, Garrett drove France's car, and\r\nCunningham and Davis followed in the Blazer.  After Cunningham noticed\r\nthe tail lights of France's car go out, he signaled Garrett who pulled over\r\nand got out.  China, who had driven ahead, returned and exited the car. \r\nGarrett and China then pulled the victims from the trunk and \"started\r\nbeating them.\"  Cunningham testified Garrett had a gun in his hand.  Davis\r\ngot out of the Blazer and went into a field with Garrett, China, and the\r\nvictims.  The three assailants continued beating the victims, made them\r\nundress, then forced them back into the trunk.  \r\n\r\nAs the group continued driving the three vehicles, Garrett began causing\r\nFrance's car to hit the Blazer.  When France's car began smoking heavily,\r\nGarrett and the other assailants pulled over and stopped.  Garrett got out of\r\nFrance's car carrying a handgun.  Davis told Cunningham he was going to\r\nshoot the victims and exited the sports utility vehicle with a rifle. \r\nCunningham drove away before any shots were fired.\r\n\r\nDavis did not testify at trial; however, his redacted statement to law\r\nenforcement officials was offered into evidence.  The statement, which\r\nimplicated Davis, China, Cunningham, and \"another guy\" in the crime,\r\nwas admitted over Davis's objection.  Garrett did not initially object to the\r\nadmission of the statement; however, he unsuccessfully moved for\r\nseverance before the statement's publication to the jury.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the statement was published to the jury, Garrett renewed\r\nhis motion for severance and moved for a mistrial, asserting \"it is readily\r\napparent that we have conflicting defenses\" and arguing the statement was\r\ninherently prejudicial because of the testimony implicating Garrett as the\r\n\"other guy.\"  Davis also sought a severance and joined in Garrett's motion\r\nfor mistrial.  The trial judge took the matter under advisement, but\r\nultimately denied the motions.\r\n\r\nAfter the verdicts, Davis moved for a new trial, arguing that the evidence\r\nwas insufficient to sustain the jury's verdict and Davis was prejudiced by\r\nthe court's failure to sever the trials because the testimony at trial\r\nimplicated Garrett more strongly than Davis.  Garrett adopted Davis's\r\nmotion, stating that his most compelling argument was the refusal of the\r\ntrial judge to grant the prior motion for severance and adding that the\r\nverdicts were \"truly and ridiculously inconsistent.\"  The trial judge denied\r\nDavis's motion for a new trial, but granted Garrett's motion, reasoning in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's almost like [the jury] used the hand of one is the hand of all on Mr.\r\nGarrett, but they didn't use the same theory with Mr. Davis. . . . I think\r\nwith Mr. Garrett, I don't have any choice but to give him the opportunity\r\nto have a new trial on the case because of the disparity of the results of the\r\ntwo defendants.  As I indicated, Mr. Davis was convicted of matters facing\r\nas much as 30 years.  And again, in essence, the jury did not convict him of\r\nmatters of the two shootings, which would have been 40 years between\r\nthose.  And yet they did convict Mr. Garrett of offenses that would have\r\nbeen at least 70 or 80 or maybe 90 years.  With that in mind, there's too\r\nmuch disparity between the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge also found that although the solicitor was \"correct legally\"\r\non the motion to sever, the joint trial \"caused Mr. Garrett to be prejudiced\r\nby some of the things the way they worked out.\"  The State now appeals.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the State argues the trial judge erred in granting Garrett's\r\nmotion for a new trial because he relied on an incorrect legal theory.  We\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the grant or refusal of a new trial is within \r\n  the trial judge's discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal without a clear \r\n  abuse of that discretion. State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 55, 447 S.E.2d \r\n  175, 176 (1993). \"An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court's decision \r\n  is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.\" State v. \r\n  Hughes, 346 S.C. 339, 342, 552 S.E.2d 35, 36 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\n\r\nHere, the trial judge granted Garrett a new trial because \r\n  \"too much disparity\" existed between the verdicts against Garrett and Davis. \r\n  In so finding, he ostensibly assumed a legal prohibition against inconsistent \r\n  verdicts in criminal cases. Our supreme court has abolished the rule prohibiting \r\n  inconsistent verdicts in criminal cases. State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. \r\n  377, 383, 401 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1991). Moreover, these verdicts are not inconsistent. \r\n  The jury simply found Garrett guilty of more offenses than his co-defendant \r\n  Davis. The logic applied in Alexander contemplates inconsistent verdicts \r\n  when multiple offenses are submitted to the jury, not when the jury returns \r\n  disparate results for co-defendants. Because the grant of a new trial was controlled \r\n  by an error of law, we reverse.\r\n\r\nEven assuming, as Garrett urges in his brief, that the trial \r\n  judge based the grant of a new trial not on a theory of inconsistent verdicts, \r\n  but on a lack of evidence to support the verdicts, the ruling is nevertheless \r\n  an abuse of discretion. If there is no evidence to support a conviction, we \r\n  should uphold an order granting a new trial. State v. Smith, 316 S.C. \r\n  at 55, 447 S.E.2d at 176. However, if competent evidence supports the jury's \r\n  verdict, the trial judge may not substitute his own judgment for that of the \r\n  jury and overturn that verdict. State v. Miller, 287 S.C. 280, 283, 337 \r\n  S.E.2d 883, 885 (1985).\r\n\r\nHere, the testimony of France, Chiappone, and Cunningham, considered\r\nwith Davis's redacted statement and the evidence police gathered from\r\nGarrett's apartment, presented ample evidence to support the jury's guilty\r\nverdicts.  That the jury could have convicted Davis on all of these charges\r\nunder the \"hand of one is the hand of all\" doctrine does not affect the\r\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict against Garrett.  \r\n\r\nWe also reject Garrett's contention that the trial judge's grant of a new trial\r\nshould be affirmed because it was partially based on the earlier failure to\r\ngrant a severance.  He asserts the motion for severance should have been\r\ngranted due to the prejudice created by Davis's statement and that a new\r\ntrial was necessary to correct that prejudice.  We disagree. \r\n\r\nMotions for severance are addressed to the trial judge's \r\n  discretion. State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 122, 481 S.E.2d 118, 124 \r\n  (1997). As co-defendants, Garrett and Davis were not entitled to separate trials \r\n  as a matter of right. State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 281, 523 S.E.2d \r\n  173, 176 (1999). \"A severance should be granted only when there is a serious \r\n  risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of a co-defendant \r\n  or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about a co-defendant's guilt.\" \r\n  Hughes v. State, 346 S.C. 554, 559, 552 S.E.2d 315, 317 (2001). \r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, admission of a statement made by a non-testifying \r\n  co-defendant and implicating the defendant violates the Confrontation Clause \r\n  and is inadmissible. State v. Holmes, 342 S.C. 113, 118, 536 S.E.2d 671, \r\n  673 (2000). However, such a statement is admissible against the confessor in \r\n  a joint trial if references to the co-defendant are redacted so as not to implicate \r\n  the co-defendants. Id. at 119, 536 S.E.3d at 674. Davis's statement was \r\n  redacted to omit specific mention of Garrett and was limited in scope to events \r\n  occurring the night of the crime in question. Moreover, the trial judge issued \r\n  a curative instruction in his charge that Davis's statement should only be considered \r\n  against Davis. Because the statement was redacted and a curative instruction \r\n  given, we find there was no violation of the Confrontation Clause even given \r\n  the State's other evidence indicating Garrett was the \"other guy\". See  \r\n  State v. Evans, 316 S.C. 303, 307, 450 S.E.2d 47, 50 (1994) (holding \r\n  co-defendant's statement admissible because \"the statement did not 'on its face' \r\n  incriminate [defendant], although its incriminating import was certainly inferable \r\n  from other evidence that was properly admitted against him\").\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial judge's grant of a new trial\r\nand remand for sentencing. \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n1.

The trial court reformed the policy to provide Antley up to $1,000,000 in\r\ncoverage, offset by any recovery from workers' compensation, and Nobel appeals.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe trial court decided this case on the following stipulated facts.  On February 7, 1995, Francis\r\nAntley, while operating a truck owned by his employer, Southern Bulk Haulers, Inc., was\r\nseriously injured in an accident caused by an unidentified vehicle in Savannah, Georgia.  As a\r\nresult, Antley filed a \"John Doe\" action in Georgia seeking coverage under the UM provision of\r\nhis personal automobile insurance policy.  Since the accident occurred during the course and\r\nscope of his employment, Antley also sought benefits under the UM provision contained in\r\nSouthern's commercial policy issued by Nobel Insurance Company.  On its face, this policy\r\nprovided only the mandatory limit of $15,000 for bodily injury caused by an uninsured driver.  \r\n\r\nAntley subsequently filed a complaint for declaratory judgment asking the court to reform the\r\npolicy's UM coverage limit because Nobel failed to make a meaningful offer of additional UM\r\ncoverage to Southern. (1)  In its answer, Nobel claimed Antley's exclusive remedy was workers'\r\ncompensation, but in the event the trial court found otherwise, UM benefits should be limited to\r\n$15,000.  On March 13, 2000 the parties specifically agreed:  1) that Nobel insured the vehicle\r\ndriven by Antley under Policy # TAL 1002822, a renewal of Southern's original policy, which\r\nprovided liability coverage up to $1,000,000; 2) that Nobel offered optional UM coverage via an\r\ninternally-generated form, (2) which Southern rejected, leaving the UM coverage limit at $15,000;\r\nand 3) that Antley eventually received $101,901.55, in workers' compensation benefits, including\r\n$13,201.53 for medical expenses. \r\n\r\nOn June 30, 2000, the trial court issued an order finding Antley was not excluded from pursuing\r\ncoverage under the UM provision of the policy.  The court further held that because Nobel failed\r\nto make a meaningful offer of additional UM insurance, Antley was entitled to recover up to the\r\nlimits of Southern's liability coverage, or $1,000,000.  Lastly, the court determined Nobel was\r\nentitled to a setoff against such coverage in the amount actually received by Antley from workers'\r\ncompensation.  This appeal followed.  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nStandard of Review  \r\n\r\nA suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable per se; the nature of the suit,\r\ntherefore, is determined by the underlying issue.  See \r\nFelts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 400\r\nS.E.2d 781 (1991); Horry County v. Ins. Reserve Fund, 344 S.C. 493, 544 S.E.2d 637 (Ct. App.\r\n2001).  As the issue  below involved a determination of uninsured motorist coverage, the action is\r\nat law. Horry County, 344 S.C. at 497, 544 S.E.2d at 640;\r\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.\r\nCalcutt, 340 S.C. 231, 530 S.E.2d 896 (Ct. App. 2000).  Furthermore, because stipulated or\r\nundisputed facts leave only a question of law for the trial court, on appeal this Court reviews\r\n\"whether the trial court properly applied the law to those facts.\" WDW Props. v. City of Sumter,\r\n342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d 631, 632 (2000); see \r\nJ.K. Constr., Inc. v. W. Carolina Reg'l Sewer\r\nAuth., 336 S.C. 162, 519 S.E.2d 561 (1999).\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nNobel asserts two grounds of error in challenging the trial court's ruling.  First, Nobel claims\r\nAntley is not entitled to recover any UM benefits under Southern's policy, arguing workers'\r\ncompensation is his sole remedy under both the relevant statutory provision and policy exclusions. \r\nSecond, Nobel contends that even if Antley is entitled to benefits under the policy's UM\r\nprovision, his recovery should be limited to $15,000 because Nobel made, and Southern rejected,\r\na meaningful offer of coverage.  We address each ground in turn.  \r\n\r\nI.  Workers' Compensation as Exclusive Remedy\r\n\r\nNobel initially argues Antley's recovery of UM benefits is barred by Â§ 42-1-540 of the South\r\nCarolina workers' compensation scheme.  In relevant part, this section states that the redress\r\navailable to an injured employee \"shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee . . .\r\nas against his employer, at common law or otherwise . . . .\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-540 (1985)\r\n(emphasis added).  Our supreme court previously has rejected the same argument now advanced\r\nby Nobel, finding that workers' compensation gives an employee \"'the right to swift and sure\r\ncompensation,'\" while an employer in turn \"'receives immunity from tort actions by the\r\nemployee.'\" Wright v. Smallwood, 308 S.C. 471, 475, 419 S.E.2d 219, 221 (1992) (quoting\r\nParker v. Williams &amp; Madjanik, Inc., 275 S.C. 65, 70, 267 S.E.2d 524, 526 (1980)).  In\r\nWright,\r\nthe court went on to reiterate that because UM coverage sounds in contract, not tort, \"the\r\nexclusivity provision of [Â§ 42-1-540] does not operate to bar [a] contractual claim for UM\r\nbenefits.\" Id.  (footnote citation omitted).\r\n\r\nNobel further contends applicable language in Southern's policy limits Antley's recovery to\r\nworkers' compensation.  Specifically, Nobel points to exclusionary language in the \"Truckers\r\nCoverage Form,\" which, as the parties stipulated, provides in relevant part:    \r\n\r\n\r\nThis insurance does not apply to [any of] the following: \r\n\r\n. . . .  \r\n\r\n3. WORKERS' COMPENSATION\r\n\r\n  \r\nAny obligation for which the \"insured\" or the \"insured's\" insurer may be held liable under any\r\nworkers' compensation, disability benefits or unemployment compensation law or any similar law. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, although not referenced in the stipulation, the ensuing paragraph titled \"EMPLOYEE\r\nINDEMNIFICATION AND EMPLOYER'S LIABILITY\" clearly indicates an intention to\r\nexclude:  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\"Bodily injury\" to:     \r\n\r\na. An employee of the \"insured\" arising out of and in the course of employment by the \"insured\" .\r\n. . .  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nThese exclusions purport to eliminate all coverage when the insured employer is liable to pay\r\nworkers' compensation to an injured employee.  Hence, Nobel argues Antley's prior receipt of\r\nworkers' compensation benefits bars any attempt to recover under the Southern policy's UM\r\nprovision.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nIt is well settled that uninsured motorist coverage in specified minimum limits is mandatory in\r\nSouth Carolina. (3)  Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 331 S.C. 437, 503 S.E.2d 211 (Ct. App. 1998),\r\nrev'd on other grounds, 339 S.C. 362, 529 S.E.2d 280 (2000); White v. Allstate Ins. Co., 314 S.C.\r\n167, 442 S.E.2d 195 (Ct. App. 1994).  The governing statute expressly states:  \r\n\r\n\r\n(A)  No automobile insurance policy or contract may be issued or delivered unless it contains . . .\r\n[an] uninsured motorist provision undertaking to pay the insured all sums which he is legally\r\nentitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle . . . .   \r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-150 (2002) (emphasis added).  Thus, \"[t]he obligation of the insurer\r\nunder the terms of the statute is to pay an insured all sums which he is legally entitled to recover\r\nfrom the [uninsured] tortfeasor up to the limit of insurance provided.\"  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.\r\nv. Howard, 288 S.C. 5, 12, 339 S.E.2d 501, 504 (1985).  \r\n\r\n\"The uninsured motorist endorsement is the contract which the insurance company makes with the\r\ninsured to protect him against the uninsured motorist.\" Ferguson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\r\nCo., 261 S.C. 96, 100, 198 S.E.2d 522, 524 (1973).  Although insurance policies are subject to the\r\nnormal rules governing contracts, including the parties' right to agree to such terms as they deem\r\nappropriate,  see B.L.G. Enters., Inc. v. First Fin. Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 529, 514 S.E.2d 327 (1999),\r\nthe freedom to contract \"is not absolute and coverage required by law may not be omitted.\" \r\nJordan v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 264 S.C. 294, 297, 214 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1975).  Since statutes\r\nmandating UM coverage are part of an insurance contract as a matter of law, to the extent policy\r\nlanguage conflicts with an applicable statute, the statute prevails.   See Ferguson, 261 S.C. at 101,\r\n198 S.E.2d at 524 (\"[T]he pertinent provisions of the [UM] statutes prevail as much as if expressly\r\nincorporated in the policy\"); Schmidt, 331 S.C. at 440, 503 S.E.2d at 213 (\"When the language of\r\nthe policy conflicts with the mandate of the [UM] statute, the statutory language prevails.\").  \r\n\r\nApplying this settled law, we find that to the extent Nobel's policy exclusions purport to bar\r\nAntley from pursuing UM coverage, they are void as against public policy and of no effect.  As\r\nthe supreme court stated in Ferguson:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public policy declared by our uninsured motorist statute imposes an obligation on insurers to\r\nprovide protection to their insureds against loss caused by wrongful conduct of an uninsured\r\nmotorist, and any limiting language in an insurance contract which ha[s] the effect of providing\r\nless protection than made obligatory by the statutes is contrary to public policy and is of no force\r\nand effect.  \r\n\r\n. . . To permit [an insurer] . . . to exclude coverage where the insured is entitled to workmen's\r\ncompensation for his injury or death would be a limitation upon the statutory coverage required by\r\nour uninsured motorist statutes.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFerguson, 261 S.C. at 100-01, 198 S.E.2d at 524.  \r\n\r\n  Nobel correctly asserts Â§ 38-77-220 (regulating automobile insurance in general) and Â§ 56-9-20(5) (the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act) each appear to permit such exclusions. \r\nSection 38-77-220 provides in pertinent part:  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe automobile policy need not insure any liability under the Workers' Compensation Law nor\r\nany liability on account of bodily injury to an employee of the insured while engaged in the\r\nemployment, other than domestic, of the insured, or while engaged in the operation, maintenance,\r\nor repair of the motor vehicle . . . .    \r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-220 (2002).  Similarly, Â§ 56-9-20 defines a \"motor vehicle liability\r\npolicy\" in relevant part as \"[a]n owner's or an operator's policy of liability insurance . . . issued . .\r\n. to or for the benefit of the person or persons named therein as insured . . . .\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n56-9-20(5) (Supp. 2001).  This definition is subject to several \"special conditions,\" one of which\r\ncontains language identical to that found in Â§ 38-77-220.   See id.  at Â§ 56-9-20(5)(c) (describing\r\nwhat an insurance policy need not cover in complying with the Financial Responsibility Act).\r\n\r\nOur supreme court, however, has construed Â§ 38-77-220 as permitting offsets for duplicate\r\ncoverage, not outright exclusions of otherwise available coverage. (4)  In Williamson v. U.S. Fire\r\nIns. Co., 314 S.C. 215, 442 S.E.2d 587 (1994), an employee injured in the course of employment\r\nsought underinsured motorist coverage from his employer's policy.  Pursuant to an offset\r\nprovision in the policy, the insurer reduced the employee's benefits by an amount equal to his\r\nrecovery under workers' compensation, and thereafter sought a judgment declaring it had fully\r\nsatisfied its obligations under the policy.  The trial court ruled the insurer was not entitled to a\r\nsetoff as a matter of public policy and the supreme court reversed, interpreting Â§ 38-77-220 to\r\npermit the reduction because \"South Carolina law provides that automobile insurance policies\r\nneed not cover liability under the worker's [sic] compensation law nor liability for bodily injury to\r\nan insured's employee.\"  Id. at 219, 442 S.E.2d at 589.  \r\n\r\nIn so holding, the court adopted the public policy-based reasoning of Manning v. Fletcher, 379\r\nS.E.2d 854 (N.C. 1989), a North Carolina case interpreting \"an almost identical statute,\" which\r\nheld the N.C. Legislature intended to permit offsets to relieve an employer \"of the burden of\r\npaying double premiums\" and to deny \"the windfall of a double recovery to the employee.\"  Id. at\r\n218, 442 S.E.2d at 588 (quoting Manning, 379 S.E.2d at 856).  Quite significantly, we think, the\r\ncourt concluded:  \r\n\r\n\r\nAs long as the employee is able to fully recover the damages sustained, we believe the better\r\npublic policy is to encourage employer voluntary coverage by not exposing employers to\r\nmandatory duplicative insurance premiums and by not allowing duplicative recoveries by\r\nemployees.  We therefore hold that [Â§ 38-77-220] allows an employer's automobile insurance\r\ncarrier to offset workers' compensation benefits received by an employee.  The offset shall be\r\napplied against the total of damages sustained once the employee has been fully compensated for\r\nthe injuries.  \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 219, 442 S.E.2d at 589. (5)   \r\n\r\nLastly, Nobel claims workers' compensation is Antley's only remedy based on the following\r\nadditional policy exclusion, found in the UM endorsement and titled \"LIMIT OF INSURANCE\":  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe will not make a duplicate payment under this Coverage for any element of \"loss\" for which\r\npayment has been made by or for anyone who is legally responsible.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn our view, this provision maximally prohibits Antley from recovering both workers'\r\ncompensation and UM benefits for the same loss, and in no way dictates workers' compensation\r\nas an exclusive remedy where other elements of loss are recoverable.  \r\n\r\nThe parties stipulated Antley was injured by an at-fault unidentified driver, thereby bringing the\r\naccident within the ambit of UM coverage.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(14) (Supp. 2001) (\"A\r\nmotor vehicle is considered uninsured if the owner or operator is unknown.\").  As discussed\r\nabove, the exclusions in Southern's policy at most only entitle Nobel to offset Antley's workers'\r\ncompensation award against any benefits obtained in the John Doe action and cannot operate to\r\nforeclose his UM claim. (6)  To hold otherwise would permit an employer/insured to enter into an\r\ninsurance contract excluding uninsured motorist coverage for its employees as a matter of course\r\nin violation of well-established public policy.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we believe our decision comports with the underlying purpose and policies of both the\r\nuninsured motorist statutes and the law of workers' compensation.  UM benefits substitute for\r\nthose benefits Antley would have received from the motorist who caused his injuries, if known.\r\nFerguson, 261 S.C. at 101-02, 198 S.E.2d at 525 (\"'The general rule is that an insurer may not\r\nlimit its liability under uninsured motorist coverage . . . because the insured is entitled to recover\r\nthe same amount he would have recovered if the offending motorist had maintained liability\r\ninsurance.'\") (citations omitted).  On the other hand, workers' compensation is intended to\r\nprovide, without consideration as to fault, sure and swift reimbursement to injured employees for\r\nmedical expenses and lost wages while immunizing employers from direct tort liability arising\r\nfrom a workplace accident. See \r\nWright, 308 S.C. at 475, 419 S.E.2d at 221.  Moreover, under our\r\nworkers' compensation scheme, an injured employee may sue a non-employer third-party\r\ntortfeasor for negligence, thereby obtaining additional monies for damages such as pain and\r\nsuffering, loss of consortium, etc., subject only to an offsetting lien retained by the compensation\r\ncarrier. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(a) &amp; (b) (1985).\r\n\r\nWe therefore find Antley is not precluded from pursuing a claim for uninsured motorist benefits\r\nunder Southern's policy.  \r\n\r\nII.  Meaningful Offer of Uninsured Motorist Coverage\r\n\r\nNoble next argues that even if Antley is entitled to recover UM benefits under Southern's policy,\r\ncoverage should be limited to $15,000.  We disagree.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to coverage mandated by law, automobile insurance carriers must offer the insured\r\noptional uninsured motorist coverage up to the liability limits of the insured's policy.  S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002).  This offer must be effective and \"meaningful to the insured.\"  Todd v.\r\nFederated Mut. Ins. Co., 305 S.C. 395, 398, 409 S.E.2d 361, 364 (1991);\r\nsee  State Farm Mut.\r\nAuto. Ins. Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 521, 354 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1987) (holding the\r\ninsured must \"be provided with adequate information, and in such a manner, as to allow [him] to\r\nmake an intelligent decision of whether to accept or reject the coverage\").  The sufficiency of the\r\noffer is a question of law for the court. See, e.g.,\r\nHanover Ins. Co. v. Horace Mann Ins. Co., 301\r\nS.C. 55, 389 S.E.2d 657 (1990); Bower v. Nat'l Gen. Ins. Co., 342 S.C. 315, 536 S.E.2d 693 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2000).  When an insurer fails to make a meaningful offer, the insured is entitled to reform\r\nthe policy to reflect optional coverage in an amount equal the insured's policy liability limits.\r\nTodd, 305 S.C. at 399, 409 S.E.2d at 364.\r\n\r\nOur supreme court adopted the test used to determine whether an offer of optional insurance\r\ncoverage is meaningful in Wannamaker:  (1) the insurer's notification process, either oral or\r\nwritten, \"must be commercially reasonable,\" (2) the insurer \"must specify the limits of optional\r\ncoverage and not merely offer additional coverage in general terms,\" (3) the insurer \"must\r\nintelligibly advise the insured of the nature of the optional coverage,\" and (4) the insured \"must be\r\ntold that optional coverages are available for an additional premium.\" 291 S.C. at 521, 354 S.E.2d\r\nat 556.  An insurer must meet all four elements of the test to render an offer meaningful.\r\nAckerman v. Travelers Indem. Co., 318 S.C. 137, 144, 456 S.E.2d 408, 411 (Ct. App. 1995) (\"The\r\ninsurer must satisfy all four prongs [of Wannamaker] to prove there was an effective offer . . . and\r\nfailure of any one . . . vitiates the offer and requires reformation of the policy . . . .\").\r\n\r\nThe burden of proving a meaningful offer of optional coverage was made rests with the insurer. \r\nSee  Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d 758 (1996);\r\nTodd, 305 S.C. at 398, 409\r\nS.E.2d at 364.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350 (2002) grants an insurer who utilizes a properly\r\nexecuted and approved offer form that minimally complies with the statute a conclusive\r\npresumption \"that there was an informed, knowing selection of coverage.\" Id. at Â§ 38-77-350(B);\r\nsee Â§ 38-77-350(A) (\"The form, at a minimum, must provide for each optional coverage required\r\nto be offered:  (1) a brief and concise explanation of the coverage, (2) a list of available limits and\r\nthe range of premiums for the limits, (3) a space for the insured to mark whether the insured\r\nchooses to accept or reject the coverage and a space for the insured to select the limits of coverage\r\nhe desires, (4) a space for the insured to sign the form which acknowledges that he has been\r\noffered the optional coverages, [and] (5) the mailing address and telephone number of the\r\nInsurance Department which the applicant may contact if the applicant has any questions that the\r\ninsurance agent is unable to answer.\").  Here, Nobel does not dispute it is not entitled to this \r\npresumption because its form does not minimally comply with Â§ 38-77-350(A).  The question,\r\nthen, is whether Nobel met its burden of showing it made a meaningful offer to Antley's\r\nemployer, Southern Bulk Haulers, Inc.\r\n\r\nThe record indicates Nobel's sole evidence of a meaningful offer was its \"Rejection - Selection\"\r\nform for UM and UIM coverage.  Although Southern's representative did sign a form purporting\r\nto reject additional uninsured coverage above the $15,000 required by South Carolina law, this\r\nfact is not dispositive as \"a noncomplying offer has the legal effect of no offer at all.\"  Hanover,\r\n301 S.C. at 57, 389 S.E.2d at 659.  In our view, the form provided by Nobel decidedly fails the\r\n\"meaningful offer\" test set forth in Wannamaker.  Although Nobel's form states Southern was\r\ngiven the opportunity to purchase UM/UIM coverage \"in amounts up to the automobile liability\r\nlimits,\" the form reflects Southern was then limited to the following choices:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      _____   1.  \r\n       I hereby reject the property damage feature of the Uninsured/ Underinsured Motorists\r\nCoverage only.  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      _____   2.  \r\n       I hereby reject Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists Coverage for limits in excess of the\r\nfollowing specified limits:  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      Bodily Injury \r\n           $15,000/$30,000   \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      Property Damage&nbsp;  \r\n         $5,000                   \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      Combined Single Limit\r\n       ________________\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      _____   3.  \r\n       I hereby accept Uninsured/Underinsured Motorists Coverage in its entirety, realizing that\r\ncoverage will apply only for the motor vehicles which meet the definition of \"owned automobiles\"\r\nas provided in this policy.  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nClearly Nobel, by limiting the insured to the three choices listed above, did not effectively offer\r\nany additional coverage, as it failed to list a single coverage amount accompanied by a\r\ncorresponding premium.  Nobel's form, which at most offers such coverage only in general terms,\r\nand neither apprises the insured of the nature of UM/UIM coverage nor relates that optional\r\ncoverages are available for an additional premium, does not satisfy Wannamaker.\r\nSee  Ackerman,\r\n318 S.C. at 144-45, 456 S.E.2d at 412 (\"To be effective, the insurer must specify the limits of\r\noptional coverage and not merely offer it in general terms. . . .  [Insurer] also failed to provide\r\n[insured] with a separately stated premium amount for optional coverage at the specified limits. . .\r\n.

Co., 331 S.C.\r\n506, 498 S.E.2d 865 (1998).\r\n\r\nNobel correctly contends it is not required to make a new offer of UM coverage where the policy\r\nrenews an existing policy.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§38-77-350(C)(2002) (\"An automobile insurer is\r\nnot required to make a new offer of coverage on any automobile insurance policy which renews,\r\nextends, changes, supercedes, or replaces an existing policy.\").  However, Nobel's contention\r\noverlooks the fact that it did make a new offer in this instance, although not required.  In so doing,\r\nNobel rendered application of Â§38-77-350(C) moot.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Nobel's argument regarding renewal fails to recognize that it still bears the burden of\r\ndemonstrating a meaningful offer of UM coverage was  made at some point in the past.  See \r\nMcDonald v. S. C. Farm Bur. Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 120, 125, 518\r\nS.E.2d 624, 626 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"Where [Â§] 38-77-350(C) states the insured is not required to\r\nmake a 'new' offer, it clearly envisions the circumstances where the insurer has already made an\r\n'old' offer.\"); Ackerman, 318 S.C. at 142, 456 S.E.2d at 411 (\"[T]he only reasonable way to\r\ninterpret the language in Â§ 38-77-350(C) is to recognize that the insurer may rely on the\r\neffective\r\npast offers it has given to its insureds when these insureds continue coverage with the same\r\ninsurer.\") (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nHere, the only evidence introduced by Nobel in support of its argument that Southern's policy had\r\nbeen renewed was the deposition testimony of Trudy Pearce Payne, Vice President of Lancer\r\nInsurance Company, which recently had purchased Nobel's Commercial Casualty Division. \r\nPayne stated she did not have a copy of the original policy, but that \"[t]here would have been\r\nsome type of uninsured, underinsured rejection form in each of those policies in the situation\r\nwhere they rejected coverage.\"  She further testified she could not tell whether the UM/UIM\r\nrejection/selection form employed in this instance was the same form Nobel used when the policy\r\ninitially was issued \"[w]ithout looking at the [original] policy.\"  Thus, as Nobel failed to offer any\r\nevidence tending to show it previously made a meaningful offer of UM coverage to Southern, it\r\nmay not rely on Â§ 38-77-350(C) to avoid reformation.\r\n\r\nBecause the record reveals Nobel failed to make a meaningful offer of UM coverage, the policy is\r\nreformed as a matter of law to include such coverage up to the liability limits of Southern's policy.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.    \r\n\r\nCURETON, J., concurs.  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J., dissents in a separate opinion.  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J. (dissenting):  I respectfully dissent.  While I agree with the reasoning and result\r\nof issue I, I disagree with the analysis and conclusion of issue II.\r\n\r\nThe stipulation of facts entered into by the parties and by which they and this court are bound\r\nclearly indicates that this was a renewal of an existing policy.  Section 38-77-350(A) mandates the\r\nform required to \"be used by insurers for all new  applicants.\"  This is the form which Nobel is\r\nfaulted for not using.  However, the named insured of this policy was not a new applicant. \r\nSubsection (A) therefore does not apply, and subsection (C) is invoked.  My disagreement with\r\nthe majority centers on the meaning and application of S.C. Code Ann. Section 38-77-350(C). (7)  \r\n\r\nTo avoid the consequences of the application of the plain language of this subsection, the majority\r\ntakes two tacks.  First, the majority contends that even though Nobel does not have to make a new\r\noffer, it did so, thereby rendering the application of section 38-77-350(C) moot.  However, that\r\nreasoning is faulty because the majority had already determined that since Nobel failed to make a\r\nmeaningful offer, it had the legal effect of no offer at all.  Second, the majority contends that\r\nsubsection (C) may be invoked only if Nobel proves that a meaningful offer was made at some\r\ntime in the past.  This is a novel issue in this state.\r\n\r\nThe majority cites the case of McDonald v. S.C. Farm Bureau Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 120, 518 S.E.2d\r\n624 (Ct. App. 1999), for the proposition that when an insured is not required to make a \"new\r\noffer\", it clearly envisions a circumstance where the insured has already made an \"old\" offer. \r\nHowever, the facts involved and the issue raised in that case differ substantially from the\r\ncircumstances here.  In McDonald, a new named insured replaced the original insured and no offer\r\nof optional coverage was ever made to the new insured.  The McDonald court ruled that under\r\nthose circumstances a new policy was created with a new named insured who had never had the\r\nopportunity to accept or reject the optional coverage.  Here, we have the same named insured in a\r\nrenewal policy.  Had the legislature intended the result reached by the majority, the statute easily\r\ncould have been worded to accomplish that objective by prefacing the section with \"where a\r\ncomplying offer was originally made.\"  The statute, however, contains no such condition when an\r\ninsurance policy is being renewed.\r\n\r\n  To hold in this case and on these facts that the policy must be reformed to provide $1,000,000\r\nuninsured motorist coverage renders section 38-77-350(C) meaningless.  While I agree Antley is\r\nentitled to uninsured motorist coverage, he is limited to the minimum required by law, that is\r\n$15,000.\r\n\r\n1.   As the outcome of this action will determine the extent of Nobel's liability in the Georgia \"John\r\nDoe\" proceeding, that action has been stayed pending a final decision in the instant case.    \r\n2.     Nobel further stipulated its form was neither \"identical to the format outlined in\" the Code nor\r\n\"generated with any reference to\" S.C. Department of Insurance Form 2006.   \r\n3.     Although it is now possible to register an uninsured\r\nvehicle in South Carolina, see S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 56-10-510 (Supp. 2001), there has been no change in the law requiring minimum limits of\r\nuninsured motorist coverage to be included in every automobile insurance policy issued in the\r\nstate. See Â§ 38-77-150.  \r\n 4.      Because Â§ 56-9-20(5)(c) contains language identical to that found in Â§ 38-77-220, the analysis\r\napplies equally to that section.  \r\n 5.     Although Nobel also cites\r\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. N. River Ins. Co., 288 S.C. 374,\r\n342 S.E.2d 627 (Ct. App. 1986) as authority for the argument that Â§Â§ 38-77-220 and 56-9-20(5)(c)\r\nare controlling, that case is inapposite.  In North River,\r\nthis Court upheld a policy provision\r\nexcluding liability coverage for \"any employee of an insured arising out of his or her\r\nemployment,\" finding such language was \"not inconsonant with\" the nearly identical predecessor\r\nstatutes to Â§Â§ 38-77-220 and 56-9-20(5). Id. at 374, 342 S.E.2d at 627.\r\nHowever, in a crucial\r\ndistinction from the case at bar, North River \r\nconcerned a negligence claim alleging wrongful death\r\ndirectly against the employer/insured, clearly prohibited by Â§ 42-1-540, whereas here Antley seeks\r\ncoverage for injuries caused by an uninsured motorist. \r\n  6.      The trial court in fact granted Nobel an offset equal to Antley's workers' compensation award. \r\nThis may have been error, as such a limitation on UM benefits arguably is invalid as a matter of\r\nlaw. See, e.g., Williamson, 314 S.C. at 219, 442 S.E.2d at 588 (\"In [Ferguson] we held that an\r\ninsurer cannot offset workers' compensation benefits received by an employee, notwithstanding\r\npolicy provisions to the contrary.\"); Ferguson,\r\n261 S.C. at 101, 198 S.E.2d at 525 (\"The general\r\nrule supported by the majority of the decided cases is that an uninsured motorist endorsement\r\nprovision for the reduction of payments by amounts received by the insured under any workmen's\r\ncompensation law has been held void or invalid and unenforceable, on the ground that such\r\nprovision reduced the effective coverage below that required by the statute and was contrary to\r\npublic policy.\"); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Calcutt, 340 S.C. 231, 235, 530 S.E.2d 896,\r\n897 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating Williamson permitted an offset \"because the coverage was\r\nvoluntarily provided by the employer; court noted \"the linchpin of Ferguson is the mandatory\r\nnature of UM coverage\" as opposed to the optional nature of UIM) (emphasis added).\r\nHowever,\r\nbecause Antley did not appeal the trial court's ruling in this regard, the holding is the law of the\r\ncase and the issue may not be considered on appeal. See \r\nUnisun Ins. v. Hawkins, 342 S.C. 537,\r\n537 S.E.2d 559 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating an unappealed ruling is the law of the case which the\r\nappellate court must assume was correct). \r\n7.

We reverse \r\n  and remand.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn February 1974, the City of Newberry annexed approximately \r\n  21.37 acres near state Highway 219 into its corporate limits. The area had been \r\n  assigned in 1971 to the Newberry Electric Cooperative exclusively by the Public \r\n  Service Commission (PSC) pursuant to the Territorial Assignment Act. Prior to \r\n  1991, however, the Cooperative never provided electric service to any customers \r\n  in the area. \r\n\r\nIn 1999, construction began on a Burger King located in \r\n  the annexed area. During construction, the City provided temporary electric \r\n  service. As the restaurant neared completion, Roger Skeen, a co-owner, requested \r\n  electric service from the Cooperative. Skeen, who previously had operated a \r\n  Burger King within the city limits, knew the City's electric rates were approximately \r\n  40% higher than the Cooperative's.\r\n\r\nIn August 1999, a line supervisor informed Charles Guerry, \r\n  the City's Utilities Director, that the Cooperative was attempting to connect \r\n  service. Guerry visited the construction site and advised the Cooperative to \r\n  stop the connection because the area was inside municipal limits. The Cooperative \r\n  ignored Guerry's instruction and continued to connect service by dropping a \r\n  line from one of its distribution poles that had been on the site for more than \r\n  forty years.\r\n\r\nThe City brought this action in November 1999 seeking an \r\n  order enjoining the Cooperative from furnishing electric power to the Burger \r\n  King. The Cooperative answered and counterclaimed for, inter alia, a judgment \r\n  declaring it legally entitled to provide service. On November 30, 2000, the \r\n  trial court held a hearing. Relying on stipulated facts, \r\n  (1) documentary evidence, and oral testimony, the court denied the \r\n  City's request for an injunction and instead issued a declaratory judgment finding \r\n  the Cooperative had a legal right to supply electric service to the Burger King. \r\n  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe material facts of this case, agreed to by written stipulation, \r\n  are undisputed. As a result, this Court will review \"whether the trial court \r\n  properly applied the law to those facts.\" WDW Props. v. City of Sumter, \r\n  342 S.C. 6, 10, 535 S.E.2d 631, 632 (2000); see Duke Power Co. v. \r\n  Laurens Elec. Co-op., Inc.,\r\n\r\n344 S.C. 101, 543 S.E.2d 560 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\n\r\nThe City argues the trial court erred in finding the Cooperative \r\n  could lawfully provide electric service to Burger King without the City's consent. \r\n  We agree. \r\n\r\nThe Legislature enacted the Rural Electric Cooperative Act \r\n  (RECA) \"for the purpose of supplying electric energy and promoting and extending \r\n  the use thereof in rural areas.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-210 (1990). As creatures \r\n  of statute, rural electric cooperatives \"only have such authority as the [L]egislature \r\n  has given them.\" Duke Power, 344 S.C. at 104, 543 S.E.2d at 562. The \r\n  RECA grants cooperatives the authority to supply electric energy only in rural \r\n  areas, i.e., areas with populations less than 2,500 persons. See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250(1) (1990); Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Town of \r\n  Pageland, 321 S.C. 538, 471 S.E.2d 137 (1996). The City of Newberry, with \r\n  a population over 10,000 residents, is nonrural.\r\n\r\nThe RECA, however, also \"provides two exceptions permitting \r\n  a rural co-op to serve customers within a nonrural area . . . .\" Duke Power, \r\n  344 S.C. at 105, 543 S.E.2d at 562; see Carolina Power, 321 S.C. at 542, 471 \r\n  S.E.2d at 139 (stating Â§ 33-49-250(1) was amended in 1963 to provide \"two exceptions\" \r\n  to the requirement that cooperatives serve only rural areas). These exceptions, \r\n  the annexation exception and the principal supplier exception, are found in \r\n  the following language from the RECA:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [T]he act of incorporating or annexing into a city \r\n    or town an area in which the cooperative is serving shall constitute the consent \r\n    of the governing body of such city or town for the cooperative to continue \r\n    serving all premises then being served and to serve additional premises within \r\n    such area until such time as the governing body of the city or town shall \r\n    direct otherwise  and such cooperative is empowered to so serve, but \r\n    it shall not extend service to any premises in any other part of such city \r\n    or town unless the cooperative was the principal supplier of electricity \r\n    in such city or town . . . . \r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 33-49-250(1) (emphasis added); see Duke Power, \r\n  344 S.C. at 105, 543 S.E.2d at 562.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the exceptions is to \"prevent the ouster \r\n  of co-ops from areas they have historically served due to population growth \r\n  or annexation.\" Duke Power, 344 S.C. at 105, 543 S.E.2d at 562. The statutory \r\n  language, therefore, \"contemplate[s] [a] co-op's continued service\" in an area \r\n  to which an exception applies. Id. Neither party herein contends the \r\n  Cooperative was the principal supplier of electricity in the annexed area. Accordingly, \r\n  our sole concern is the application of the annexation exception.\r\n\r\nThe trial court found Burger King had the option to choose \r\n  either the City or the Cooperative as its electric service provider. The court \r\n  based the finding on its interpretation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-670 (Supp. \r\n  2001) because, in supplying power to the Burger King, the Cooperative merely \r\n  \"dropped a line\" and did not use the City's \"streets, alleys or other public \r\n  ways.\" (2) Section 58-27-670 provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The furnishing of electric service in any area which becomes \r\n    a part of any municipality after the effective date of this section, either \r\n    by annexation or incorporation, whether or not the area, or any portion of \r\n    the area has been assigned pursuant to Â§ 58-27-640, is subject to the provisions \r\n    of Â§Â§ 58-27-1360 and 33-49-250, and any provisions of this article. No \r\n    poles, wires, or other facilities of electric suppliers using the streets, \r\n    alleys, or other public ways within the corporate limits of a municipality \r\n    may be constructed by an electric supplier unless the consent of the municipal \r\n    governing body is first obtained. Annexation may not be construed to \r\n    increase, decrease, or affect any other right or responsibility a municipality, \r\n    rural electric cooperative, or electrical utility may have with regard to \r\n    supplying electric service in areas assigned by the Public Service Commission \r\n    in accordance with Chapter 27 of Title 58.\r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 58-27-670 (emphasis added). \r\n   (3) \r\n\r\nThe statute, therefore, declares that any electric service \r\n  provider annexed or incorporated into a municipality after June 6, 1984, the \r\n  date of enactment, must obtain the municipality's consent before using the \"streets, \r\n  alleys, or other public ways\" to erect poles, wires or other business facilities. \r\n  In reaching its conclusion, the trial court apparently employed reverse logic \r\n  to find that the statute also inferentially permitted an annexed electric service \r\n  supplier to provide new service without consent if it refrained from using the \r\n  municipality's public property. This was error.\r\n\r\nInitially, we note Â§ 58-27-670 by its own terms is inapplicable \r\n  under the facts of this case because the City annexed the area in question in \r\n  1974, a full ten years prior to the date of enactment. See City of \r\n  Westminster v. Blue Ridge Elec. Coop., 295 S.C. 93, 97, 366 S.E.2d 611, \r\n  613 (Ct. App. 1988) (\"[T]he Legislature intended the amended provisions of Sections \r\n  58-27-670 and 58-27-1360 to apply to areas annexed or incorporated after the \r\n  effective date of the amendments (i.e. June 6, 1984).\"). Moreover, our supreme \r\n  court has interpreted Â§ 58-27-670 to mean that a rural electric cooperative \r\n  possessing a valid PSC territorial assignment to serve an area subsequently \r\n  annexed is \"permitted to continue service in that area to those premises \r\n  being served as of the date of the annexation or incorporation,\" but \"prohibited, \r\n  without prior consent of the municipality, from extending or expanding \r\n  service in that area by the use of any streets, alleys, public property or public \r\n  ways after the date of annexation or incorporation.\" City of Abbeville v. \r\n  Aiken Elec. Coop., 287 S.C. 361, 370-71, 338 S.E.2d 831, 836 (1985) (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\n\r\nFinally, Â§ 58-27-670 expressly states it is subject to the \r\n  terms of Â§ 33-49-250, which clearly limit a cooperative's ability to provide \r\n  service in an annexed or incorporated area without the municipality's express \r\n  consent. The plain language of the annexation exception contained in Â§ 33-49-250(1) \r\n  provides that the act of annexation or incorporation by a municipality constitutes \r\n  its implied consent for a cooperative \"to continue serving all premises then \r\n  being served . . . .\" Thus, if a cooperative is serving existing customers, \r\n  it has a statutory right to continue serving them even after annexation. See \r\n  Â§ 33-49-250(1); Carolina Power, 321 S.C. at 543, 471 S.E.2d at 140 (\"[T]he \r\n  intent of the [L]egislature in adopting the annexation exception was to permit \r\n  co-ops to continue to serve existing customers and not require ouster of a co-op \r\n  due solely to a city's annexation.\"). The Cooperative admits it had no customers \r\n  in the annexed area prior to Burger King; hence, it does not fall within the \r\n  category of cooperatives afforded the City's implied consent. See Â§ 33-49-250(1); \r\n  Duke Power, 344 S.C. at 106, 543 S.E.2d at 563 (noting that where a cooperative \r\n  is not serving any customers at the time of annexation a decision barring it \r\n  from serving the annexed area does not result in an impermissible ouster).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, although the annexation exception also implies \r\n  consent for cooperatives to serve \"additional premises,\" i.e., new customers, \r\n  within an annexed area, the statute expressly limits a cooperative's authority \r\n  to provide new or increased service by allowing it only \"until such time as \r\n  the governing body of the city or town shall direct otherwise . . . .\" Â§ 33-49-250(1). \r\n  As the parties stipulated the City never consented to service by the Cooperative, \r\n  and the record reflects the City in fact \"direct[ed] otherwise\" when Charles \r\n  Guerry informed the Cooperative it needed to stop the installation of new service, \r\n  this aspect of the annexation exception is similarly unavailing to the Cooperative. \r\n  For the foregoing reasons, we hold Â§ 58-27-670 was an inappropriate basis for \r\n  the trial court's ruling. The trial court erred in finding the Cooperative was \r\n  authorized to provide electric service to the Burger King in the absence of \r\n  the City's consent. Accordingly, we reverse the court's declaratory judgment \r\n  in the Cooperative's favor, and remand for entry of an order enjoining the Cooperative \r\n  from providing such service.\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.  \r\n\r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n1.   The relevant stipulated facts include:  1) the City annexed the area in\r\n1974, 2) the PSC assigned the area to the Cooperative prior to annexation,\r\n3) the City population estimate at the time was 10,542, \r\n  4) the Cooperative served no customers within the area prior to Burger King, \r\n  5) the City never consented to service by the Cooperative, 6) the Cooperative \r\n  moved no poles prior to beginning service, and 7) the Cooperative maintained \r\n  the poles and lines used to provide service both before and after annexation.\r\n\r\n2.  The parties agreed the Cooperative \r\n  did not use the streets, alleys, or public ways of the City in providing electric \r\n  service to Burger King.  \r\n3.  S.C. Code Ann.

Dayton Riddle, both of Lexington, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSHULER, J.: Malcolm Jeffcoat appeals his \r\n  convictions on four counts each of criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the \r\n  first degree and committing a lewd act upon a minor, arguing the trial court \r\n  erred in admitting into evidence prior consistent statements of the victim. \r\n  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe victim in this case is Malcolm Jeffcoat's step-granddaughter \r\n  by virtue of his marriage to her paternal grandmother. Victim visited the Jeffcoats \r\n  often, spending two or three Saturdays a month at their home and occasionally \r\n  accompanying them on camping trips. \r\n\r\nAt some point in early 1997, Victim's mother noticed that \r\n  when Victim returned from visiting the Jeffcoats she was irritable and \"sassy,\" \r\n  which did not reflect the child's normal personality. Victim also began exhibiting \r\n  odd behavior, such as licking herself and the walls and windows of the family's \r\n  home. According to Mother, one evening she discovered Victim, then just three \r\n  years old, \"masturbating with [her] baby doll.\" Concerned, Mother asked Victim \r\n  about the incident and Victim eventually told her Jeffcoat had \"put his weenie \r\n  on her toodie.&quot; \r\n\r\nMother contacted Victim's pediatrician the next day, and \r\n  two days later the family went to a local center for sexually abused children. \r\n  The center's staff notified authorities and scheduled appointments for Victim \r\n  with Margaret Taylor, a post-trauma therapist, and Dr. Dwight Reynolds, a pediatrician. \r\n  Among other things, Victim told Taylor Jeffcoat had \"hurt [her] hiney with his \r\n  weenie\" and \"put his weenie in [her] mouth.\" Upon examination of Victim, Reynolds \r\n  noted an unusual lack of a gag reflex and both anal and vaginal physical abnormalities \r\n  \"indicative of recurrent penetration.\" \r\n\r\nIn March 1999, a Lexington County grand jury indicted Jeffcoat \r\n  on five counts of criminal sexual conduct with a minor, first degree, and five \r\n  counts of committing a lewd act on a minor. At the time of trial in September \r\n  1999, Victim was five years old. She testified, describing the incidents of \r\n  abuse and naming Jeffcoat as the perpetrator. Following Victim's testimony, \r\n  Mother and then Taylor, Victim's therapist, testified. Over defense objections \r\n  and pursuant to Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE, both repeated Victim's statements describing \r\n  the abuse by Jeffcoat. \r\n\r\nA jury convicted Jeffcoat on four counts of each offense, \r\n  and the trial court sentenced him to twenty years imprisonment on each criminal \r\n  sexual conduct charge and ten years on each charge of committing a lewd act \r\n  upon a minor. This appeal followed. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred \r\n  in permitting Mother and Taylor to testify in detail about Victim's out-of-court \r\n  statements regarding the alleged abuse, thereby improperly bolstering Victim's \r\n  credibility with inadmissible hearsay testimony. \r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, a sexual assault victim's prior consistent \r\n  statements limited to the time and place of the alleged incident are not hearsay \r\n  if the victim testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination. Rule 801(d)(1)(D), \r\n  SCRE. This rule incorporates our state's previously recognized hearsay exception \r\n  for \"limited corroborative testimony in a sexual conduct case.\" State v. \r\n  Whisonant, 335 S.C. 148, 154, 515 S.E.2d 768, 771 (Ct. App. 1999); see \r\n  Simpkins v. State, 303 S.C. 364, 401 S.E.2d 142 (1991) (recognizing corroborative \r\n  statements of alleged criminal sexual conduct victims that are limited to time \r\n  and place of the alleged assault as a well-settled exception to the rule against \r\n  admitting hearsay testimony).\r\n\r\nThe rule expressly allows other witnesses to testify the \r\n  victim complained of the assault, but only as to \"time and place\"; it specifically \r\n  circumscribes such testimony by \"excluding details or particulars.\" State \r\n  v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 506, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993). Among the details \r\n  which must be excluded under the rule is the identity of the alleged perpetrator. \r\n  See Jolly v. State, 314 S.C. 17, 443 S.E.2d 566 (1994). The record \r\n  clearly reflects the testimony offered by Mother and Taylor encompassed detailed \r\n  aspects of Victim's statements, including naming Jeffcoat as her abuser. By \r\n  going beyond mere time and place, neither Mother's nor Taylor's testimony relating \r\n  the statements falls within the scope of admissibility under Rule 801(d)(1)(D). \r\n  See Whisonant, 335 S.C. at 155, 515 S.E.2d at 771 (finding testimony \r\n  containing detail exceeding the parameters of the rule constitutes hearsay).\r\n\r\nThe trial court, however, admitted the testimony of both \r\n  witnesses under rule of evidence 801(d)(1)(B). This rule renders a hearsay statement \r\n  potentially admissible if it is consistent with the declarant's trial testimony \r\n  and \"is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant \r\n  of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive.\" Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE; \r\n  see State v. Fulton, 333 S.C. 359, 509 S.E.2d 819 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  When all requirements of the rule are met, the whole of the prior statement, \r\n  including specific details, is admissible in evidence. Fulton, 333 S.C. \r\n  at 364, 509 S.E.2d at 821 (\"Pursuant to Rule 801, the prior consistent statement \r\n  is nonhearsay and comes in as substantive evidence, i.e., it is admissible for \r\n  the truth of the matter asserted.\").\r\n\r\nJeffcoat contends the trial court erred in allowing Mother \r\n  and Taylor's testimony because defense counsel conducted \"just normal cross-examination\" \r\n  that neither attacked Victim's character nor implied fabrication. In response, \r\n  the State asserts counsel \"clearly and repeatedly implied\" Victim had been \"coached,\" \r\n  thereby alleging an improper influence such that her prior statements to both \r\n  Mother and Taylor fell within the ambit of Rule 801(d)(1)(B). \r\n\r\nWe agree with the State that defense counsel raised the \r\n  issue of improper influence or \"coaching\" by asking Victim whether she \"practiced\" \r\n  before testifying and whether anyone had told her what to say. Counsel specifically \r\n  inquired whether Victim had talked to Mother about what she was going to say \r\n  in court and whether the solicitor told Victim \"what things to say in the courtroom.\" \r\n  These questions impliedly charged improper influences by Mother and the prosecution. \r\n  See State v. Wells, 522 N.W.2d 304, 309 (Iowa Ct. App. 1994) (finding \r\n  alleged victim's prior consistent statements admissible where defense counsel \r\n  asked \"whether others had suggested his testimony\"); State v. Mensing, \r\n  991 P.2d 950 (Mont. 1999) (noting prosecutor's alleged coaching of a sexual \r\n  assault victim could constitute an assertion of improper influence if the victim \r\n  was asked about the substance of her conversations with the prosecutor or whether \r\n  she had discussed the content of her trial testimony with anyone).\r\n\r\nJeffcoat's allegation of improper influence, however, does \r\n  not end our inquiry. As a prerequisite to admissibility under 801(d)(1)(B), \r\n  the party offering a prior consistent statement must demonstrate the statement \r\n  was made \"before the alleged fabrication, or before the alleged improper influence \r\n  or motive arose.\" Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE; see Fulton, 333 S.C. \r\n  at 374, 509 S.E.2d at 827 (\"[W]hen a prior consistent statement is offered for \r\n  the purpose of rebutting an express or implied charge that the witness's testimony \r\n  is the result of a recent fabrication or improper influence or motive, the statement \r\n  must predate any alleged improper influence or motive.\"); State v. Phillipo, \r\n  623 A.2d 1265, 1268 (Me. 1993) (\"As the party offering the prior consistent \r\n  statements, it is the State's burden to establish that the statements were made \r\n  before the motive arose.\"); State v. Carlson, 392 N.W.2d 89, 91 (S.D. \r\n  1986) (\"Before a prior consistent statement will qualify as nonhearsay under \r\n  [801(d)(1)(B)], the proponent must demonstrate . . . the prior consistent \r\n  statement was made prior to the time the proposed motive to falsify arose.\") \r\n  (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nThis requirement modifies federal rule 801(d)(1)(B) in light \r\n  of the Supreme Court's decision in Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150 \r\n  (1995). See Note, Rule 801(d)(1)(B), SCRE. In Tome, the Court \r\n  found the temporal requirement expressed in our rule implicitly \"imbedded\" in \r\n  the federal rule, and therefore held prior consistent statements could be introduced \r\n  to rebut an allegation of improper influence or motive \"only when those statements \r\n  were made before the charged . . . improper influence or motive.\" Tome, \r\n  513 U.S. at 166, 167. In so doing, the Court reasoned a prior consistent statement \r\n  \"has no relevancy to refute the charge\" of improper influence unless the statement \r\n  \"was made before the source of the bias, interest, influence or incapacity originated.\" \r\n  Id. at 156 (citation omitted). As the Court explained: \"A consistent \r\n  statement that predates the [influence] is a square rebuttal of the charge that \r\n  the testimony was contrived as a result of that [influence].\" Id. at \r\n  158.\r\n\r\nHere, the trial court properly admitted the statement made \r\n  by Victim to Mother that Jeffcoat \"put his weenie on her toodie.\" Since this \r\n  statement constituted Victim's initial disclosure of Jeffcoat's abuse, it obviously \r\n  was made prior to any contact with the judicial system and thus could not have \r\n  been the result of either Mother or the solicitor's alleged coaching of her \r\n  court testimony. Similarly, Victim's prior consistent statements related in \r\n  Taylor's testimony predate the family's exposure to the judicial branch; Mother \r\n  testified the family only became involved with the solicitor's office and subsequent \r\n  prosecution after Victim stopped seeing Taylor for therapy. Accordingly, the \r\n  trial court properly found Victim's statements to Taylor admissible to rebut \r\n  the charges of improper influence. See Fulton, 333 S.C. at 364, \r\n  509 S.E.2d at 821; State v. Street, 551 N.W.2d 830, 839 (Wis. Ct. App. \r\n  1996) (\"[C]onsistent statements made prior to the alleged coaching of the children \r\n  are admissible.\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3520","title":"Pilgrim v.

Davis, of The Ward Law Firm, of Spartanburg, for appellant.\r\n\r\nAndrew N. Poliakoff, of Spartanburg, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.: Alice Mae Pilgrim sued Yvonne \r\n  Wardlaw Miller to recover for injuries she allegedly sustained in an automobile \r\n  accident. Miller defaulted and, after a damages hearing, Pilgrim was awarded \r\n  a judgment of $50,000. Miller appeals the trial court's denial of her motion \r\n  to set aside the default. We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis action arises out of an automobile accident that occurred \r\n  on April 11, 1997. Pilgrim was stopped at a red light when the YMCA van she \r\n  was driving was rear-ended by Miller. Pilgrim served a summons and complaint \r\n  on Miller almost three years later on March 24, 2000. The next day, Miller took \r\n  the suit papers to an attorney, who instructed her to take them to her insurance \r\n  company. Miller promptly delivered the summons and complaint to an agent for \r\n  Allstate Insurance Company. \r\n\r\nAllstate failed to timely file an answer on behalf of Miller, \r\n  and Pilgrim obtained an entry of default on May 17, 2000. Miller moved for relief \r\n  from the default pursuant to Rule 55(c), SCRCP. Pilgrim opposed the motion on \r\n  the basis that it stated no grounds in support of the request and \"good cause\" \r\n  did not exist to set aside the entry of default. Pilgrim asserted her attorney \r\n  had been in \"continuous contact\" with Allstate adjusters since the day after \r\n  the accident and they had been fully apprised of the pending claim for almost \r\n  three years. \r\n\r\nAt the hearing to set aside the entry of default, Miller's \r\n  counsel advised the court that Miller would admit liability, but contested the \r\n  extent of damages that Pilgrim allegedly suffered as a proximate result of the \r\n  accident. \r\n\r\nThe trial court denied Miller's motion to lift the entry \r\n  of default. The court stated, \"No specific reason was offered for the lack of \r\n  response to the Summons and Complaint\" and \"[i]t is the finding of this Court \r\n  that the Court has been presented with no reason to set aside this Default.\" \r\n    (1)  \r\n\r\nThe matter proceeded to a hearing on damages, after which \r\n  the trial court awarded Pilgrim actual damages of $50,000. The court denied \r\n  Miller's motion to set aside the default judgment under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP \r\n  or, alternatively, to grant her a new trial, finding there had been no showing \r\n  of excusable neglect. \r\n\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. Default \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller first contends the trial court erred by not finding \r\n  \"good cause\" existed to lift the entry of default where she gave the summons \r\n  and complaint to Allstate, which did not file a timely answer. We disagree.\r\n\r\nRule 55(c), SCRCP provides: \"For good cause shown the court \r\n  may set aside an entry of default and, if a judgment by default has been entered, \r\n  may likewise set it aside in accordance with Rule 60(b).\"\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether good cause exists, the trial court should \r\n  consider the following factors: (1) the timing of the defendant's motion for \r\n  relief, (2)&nbsp;whether the defendant has a meritorious defense, and (3) the \r\n  degree of prejudice to the plaintiff if relief is granted. \r\n   (2)\r\n\r\n\"The decision of whether to grant relief from an entry of \r\n  default is solely within the sound discretion of the trial court.\" \r\n  (3) \"An order based on an exercise of that discretion, however, will \r\n  be set aside if it is controlled by some error of law or lacks evidentiary support.\" \r\n  (4) \"The issue before this Court, therefore, is not whether we believe \r\n  good cause existed to set aside the default, but rather, whether the [trial \r\n  judge's] determination is supportable by the evidence and not controlled by \r\n  an error of law.\"  (5)\r\n\r\nAt the hearing on Miller's motion to lift the entry of default, \r\n  Miller testified she turned the summons and complaint over to her attorney the \r\n  day after she received them, and upon her attorney's instruction, took the suit \r\n  papers to Allstate. Miller testified her agent, Ken Kirkland, told her Allstate \r\n  would \"handle it from there.\" \r\n\r\nMiller did not offer any testimony from Allstate representatives \r\n  at the hearing; however, Miller's attorney advised the trial judge: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Your Honor, I've got no excuse and I'm not trying to \r\n    make an excuse for what happened. The ball was dropped by Allstate at some \r\n    point. Whether it was the adjuster that didn't do something when they \r\n    received the complaint or whether it was the agent who didn't send it to the \r\n    adjuster, I have no idea and I have no way of telling because no one knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Emphasis added.] \r\n\r\nCounsel for Pilgrim submitted seventeen exhibits detailing \r\n  the fact that Pilgrim had been in \"constant contact\" with Allstate for the nearly \r\n  three years that elapsed before this action was filed. \r\n\r\nThe trial court noted during the hearing that, \"[i]f the \r\n  complaint was taken to Allstate Insurance Company, they had an obligation to \r\n  defend. They had an obligation to act diligently, they had an obligation to \r\n  take up this matter. The default is on their side . . . .\" In its order denying \r\n  Miller's motion to set aside the entry of default, the court observed that, \r\n  although Miller had turned the pleadings over to Allstate, \"[n]o specific reason \r\n  was offered for the lack of response to the Summons and Complaint.\" \r\n\r\nThe dispositive issue here is whether the trial court abused \r\n  its discretion in refusing to set aside the entry of default. We hold it did \r\n  not. As noted by the trial court, Allstate undertook the defense of this case \r\n  on Miller's behalf and was responsible for answering the complaint and presenting \r\n  any and all available defenses to the claim. \r\n\r\n\"The courts of this state have consistently held that the \r\n  negligence of an attorney or insurance company is imputable to a defaulting \r\n  litigant.\" (6) In this case, Allstate's failure \r\n  to answer the complaint is imputed to Miller. (7) \r\n  Accordingly, because no explanation was offered for Allstate's failure to respond \r\n  to the complaint, we find no abuse of discretion here and affirm the trial court's \r\n  refusal to set aside the default. (8) \r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Damages Hearing \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller next contends the trial court committed reversible \r\n  error \"by refusing to strike medical bills\" that she alleges Pilgrim's doctors \r\n  did not relate to the April 11, 1997 accident. Miller argues the bills occurred \r\n  after Pilgrim was involved in a second automobile accident in March 1998, and \r\n  the last date for which Pilgrim sought treatment for injuries caused by the \r\n  1997 accident was on July 16, 1997. Consequently, all bills after that date \r\n  should have been \"struck.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter within \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial court and absent clear abuse, will not be \r\n  disturbed on appeal.\" (9) \"Proof that an error \r\n  caused the appellant prejudice is a prerequisite to reversal based on error \r\n  where the trial court's discretion is involved.\" (10)\r\n\r\nWe find no clear abuse of discretion by the trial court.  Pilgrim testified\r\nthat, from the date of the first accident in April 1997 until the second\r\naccident in March 1998, the medical problems she was experiencing with\r\nher neck and left shoulder never cleared up and she missed eight or nine\r\nweeks of work.  Pilgrim had experienced no neck or shoulder problems\r\nprior to the first accident.  Pilgrim maintained the second accident involved\r\nonly a slight \"tap\" from behind by another vehicle, which resulted in no\r\nbodily injury and approximately $200 in property damage.  Pilgrim\r\nsubmitted a chart listing total medical bills of $9,452.10, but did not seek\r\nrecovery for two bills of $150 and $55 out of that total.  There was also\r\ntestimony from at least one of the doctors who treated Pilgrim that she was\r\nstill having pain in her back and shoulder after July 1997.\r\n\r\nMiller cross-examined Pilgrim about her injuries and the relevancy of her\r\nmedical bills.  In addition, Miller extensively questioned her doctors\r\nregarding their treatment as well as perceived flaws in the evidence.  The\r\nquestion of whether the medical bills were, in fact, sufficiently related to\r\nthe injuries Pilgrim allegedly sustained in the April 11, 1997 motor vehicle\r\naccident was for the fact finder to consider in determining the amount of\r\nrecoverable damages.  Under these circumstances, Miller's arguments go\r\nto the weight and credibility of the evidence, rather than its\r\nadmissibility. (11)  Accordingly, we find no reversible error in this regard.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n1.

Initially, David C. Poole (\"Poole\"), along with the other named Defendants, \r\n  filed a declaratory judgment action against a plethora of individuals and entities, \r\n  including the named Respondents. The Poole group challenged an amendment to \r\n  the restrictive covenants on the subject property, which reduced the minimum \r\n  lot size restriction from 5 acres to 1 acre lots. The Poole group concurrently \r\n  filed a lis pendens covering the property. The Respondents, et. al, answered \r\n  and counterclaimed, alleging causes of action for slander of title and violation \r\n  of the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act. The trial court \r\n  granted Pond Place's motion for summary judgment on Poole's declaratory judgment \r\n  action. The court found the modification to the restrictive covenants was valid. \r\n  We subsequently affirmed the trial court in our unpublished opinion Poole, \r\n  et. al v. Pond Place Partners, Inc., et. al, Op. No. 1997-UP-129 (S.C. Sup. \r\n  Ct. App. filed Feb. 12, 1997), cert. denied (Jan. 12, 1998). Thereafter, \r\n  the Pond Place group prosecuted their actions for slander of title and violation \r\n  of the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act. After a multi-day \r\n  trial, the jury found only Poole liable for slander of title and awarded actual \r\n  and punitive damages to Pond Place Partners and Edwin P. Collins. Poole appeals. \r\n  We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. Underlying Grant of Summary Judgment \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his order filed January 16, 1995, the circuit judge explains:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The controlling facts in this case are not in dispute. \r\n    In January 1954, a subdivision known as \"Parkins Lake Development\" was created. \r\n    Originally, this development consisted of 15 lots in differing amounts of \r\n    acreage. On March 30, 1954, the owners of the property in the Development \r\n    agreed to restrict the property such that no tract would be divided in lots \r\n    of less that five acres. By agreement these Restrictive Covenants continued \r\n    unabated until April 1, 1974. Thereafter, the Covenants would automatically \r\n    be extended for successive ten (10) year periods unless the property owners \r\n    agreed to change the Covenants by a \"vote of a majority of the then owners \r\n    of the tracts.\" The property owners abided by these restrictions until March \r\n    31, 1994. At that time, a majority of the then property \r\n    owners entered into the \"Amendment to Subdivision Restrictions.\" Effective \r\n    April 1, 1994, the Restrictive Covenants were amended permitting lots to be \r\n    subdivided into tracts of not less than one acre. The signatures on the Amendment \r\n    to the Subdivision Restrictions were witnessed and properly probated. The \r\n    Amendment was duly filed with the Greenville County RMC Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original, internal footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\nOn July 19, 1994, Poole (1) \r\n  brought an action pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act \r\n  (2) to have the court determine if the \"Amendment to the Subdivision \r\n  Restrictions\" was valid and enforceable. On the same day, Poole filed a lis \r\n  pendens \"pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act to affirm and validate restrictive \r\n  covenants and enforcement thereof.\" The then defendants answered and counterclaimed, \r\n  alleging violation of the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions \r\n  Act (3) and an action for slander of title.\r\n\r\nOn November 15, 1994, the original defendants filed their \r\n  notice and motion for summary judgment \"on the basis that there is no genuine \r\n  dispute as to any material fact, in that it is undisputed that a majority of \r\n  the property owners voted to amend the Deed Restrictions to allow development \r\n  of the property on one (1) acre tracts.\" The Circuit Court granted the motion \r\n  for summary judgment. Concurrently, the court ordered the lis pendens filed \r\n  by Poole dissolved. (4)  \r\nThe circuit judge granted summary judgment primarily upon \r\n  a finding that the signed and probated document purporting to amend the covenants \r\n  constituted a proper \"vote\" to change the covenants. He noted that Poole failed \r\n  to cite any authority to support his contention that a secret ballot \"vote\" \r\n  was required and that, even if the restrictive covenants could be so read, they \r\n  must be construed in favor of the construction that will least restrict the \r\n  property:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The facts to which the parties agree are controlling in \r\n    this instance. The Restrictive Covenants at issue dated March 30, 1954 were \r\n    effective until April 1, 1974. Thereafter, the Covenants were extended for \r\n    successive ten year periods \"unless by vote of a majority of the then owners \r\n    of the tracts agreed to change the Covenants either in whole or in part.\" \r\n    The current owners of the tracts of land are a matter of public record. The \r\n    document known as \"Amendment to Subdivision Restrictions\" dated March 31, \r\n    1994, is equally clear and unambiguous in its terms. The Amendment modifies \r\n    Paragraph 3 of the original restrictive covenants dated March 30, 1954, such \r\n    that the land within the Subdivision can be subdivided into lots of no less \r\n    than one acre. The signatures appearing on the Amendment represents a majority \r\n    of the present owners of the tracts within the subdivision. Despite these \r\n    undisputed facts, Plaintiffs urge this Court to find the word \"vote\" ambiguous \r\n    because the methodology of how the vote is to be taken is not defined in the \r\n    document. The Court declines to accept this offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoole petitioned the court to vacate, reconsider, alter \r\n  and/or amend his order. The judge declined, finding in an order filed April \r\n  5, 1995, that it was clear the majority of property owners had voted to amend \r\n  the covenants. The circuit judge explained: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Despite tallying the votes by four alternative methods (by \r\n    assigning votes to each of the twenty-two lots, by assigning votes only to \r\n    owners with five acres or more, by assigning votes to the original remaining \r\n    fourteen lots, and by assigning votes to each individual owner), the Court \r\n    arrived at the same result: the majority of land owners voted to change the \r\n    property restrictions from a five acre minimum to a one acre minimum. \r\n\r\n\r\nPoole appealed. While this appeal was still pending, Pond \r\n  Place applied to the Circuit Court to have the automatic stay lifted, which \r\n  would \"allow[ ] them to freely alienate their property during the pendency of \r\n  the appeal, subject to the restrictions found in the AMENDMENT TO SUBDIVISION \r\n  RESTRICTIONS, filed with the Greenville County RMC, and dated March 31, 1995,\" \r\n  or, alternatively, \"require the appellants to post sufficient bond to compensate \r\n  defendants for any economic damages which they might suffer if they cannot sell \r\n  the property during the automatic stay, yet ultimately prevail on the appeal.\" \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe circuit judge declined to grant this relief because \r\n  neither of the counterclaims had yet been addressed by the court and, in his \r\n  discretion, the judge did not \"find bond appropriate in this case.\" Pond Place \r\n  moved for reconsideration of this order because the \"[s]tay imposed by the Appeal \r\n  [of Poole to the Court of Appeals] effectively enjoins these Defendants from \r\n  freely selling their land.\" The court disagreed and denied Pond Place's motion \r\n  for reconsideration; however, it granted leave to petition the appellate court \r\n  for supersedeas. On October 13, 1995, the South Carolina Supreme Court filed \r\n  its order refusing to lift the automatic stay or require a bond. The Court stated: \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Because there appears to be a legitimate dispute as to whether \r\n    appellants were misled by respondents into believing that they would be able \r\n    to vote on any changes in the subdivision restrictions at a subsequent meeting, \r\n    we deny respondents' request to lift the automatic stay and their request \r\n    to require the posting of a bond. \r\n\r\n\r\nThereafter, in our unpublished opinion of Poole, et. \r\n  al v. Pond Place Partners, Inc., et. al, Op. No. 1997-UP-129 (S.C. Ct. App. \r\n  filed Feb. 12, 1997), cert. denied (Jan. 12, 1998), we affirmed the grant \r\n  of summary judgment in favor of Pond Place. We concluded our opinion, stating: \r\n  \"We find no evidence to refute the methods used by the trial judge. Clearly, \r\n  the trial judge thoroughly reviewed the evidence. We note that none of the property \r\n  owners wish to remove their signatures from the Amendment. Therefore, the order \r\n  of the trial judge is affirmed.\" \r\n\r\nBy order dated January 12, 1998, the Supreme Court denied \r\n  Poole's petition for writ of certiorari. In the appeal now before this Court, \r\n  Poole acknowledges the covenant amendments were deemed properly adopted. In \r\n  fact, Poole writes at length in his brief that he is not attempting to re-litigate \r\n  the resolution of the vote amending the covenants. \r\n\r\nII. Present Litigation\r\n\r\nAfter Poole's declaratory judgment action was dismissed \r\n  by summary judgment, Pond Place Partners, et. al, prosecuted their actions \r\n  for slander of title and violation of the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings \r\n  Sanctions Act. On April 9, 1999, the circuit judge merely denied both Pond Place's \r\n  motions for summary judgment on its two causes of action, as well as Poole's \r\n  motion to dismiss the counterclaims. However, in a subsequent order filed on \r\n  October 4, 1999, denying Pond Place's motion for reconsideration, the circuit \r\n  judge wrote: \r\n\r\n\r\n  After carefully reviewing the Motion and the case file including \r\n    appellate briefs to the South Carolina Court of Appeals, this Court finds \r\n    that counterclaiming Defendants have not proven by a preponderance of the \r\n    evidence that Plaintiffs' initiation and continuation of this lawsuit is being \r\n    done so primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the proper discovery, \r\n    joinder of parties, or adjudication of the claim upon which the proceedings \r\n    are based. \r\n\r\n\r\nThereafter, during pre-trial motions, Poole argued the October \r\n  order effectively dismissed the counterclaim for violation of the South Carolina \r\n  Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act. The court disagreed. However, the \r\n  trial judge removed the claim from jury consideration. Essentially, the judge \r\n  found that a ruling on the frivolous proceedings depended on the resolution \r\n  of the underlying legal cause of action for slander of title. \"I couldn't grant \r\n  [Pond Place's summary judgment] motion under the frivolous proceedings act â€¦ \r\n  because I considered this slander of title action still being alive.\" Apparently, \r\n  therefore, the frivolous proceedings claim is still pending. \r\n\r\nThe slander of title action was tried before a jury. There, \r\n  Pond Place presented testimony attempting to show that, as the trial court and \r\n  this Court eventually found, there was never an issue regarding the clear outcome \r\n  and propriety of the vote amending the restrictive covenants in the Parkins \r\n  Lake Subdivision. Also, Pond Place elicited testimony that the lis pendens interfered \r\n  with the marketability of the lots in the subdivision which caused substantial \r\n  damages to those parties attempting to dispose of or develop their property \r\n  under the amended version of the covenants. \r\n\r\nPoole, on the other hand, tried to demonstrate that, in \r\n  1994 when he heard of the covenant amendments, he was justified in testing these \r\n  amendments with his declaratory judgment action. He essentially defended his \r\n  actions by showing he prosecuted the case upon the advice of competent attorneys. \r\n  For example, Poole submitted affidavits from his past and present legal counsel. \r\n  James R. Gilreath, in a July 27, 1998, affidavit, averred that he has advised \r\n  Poole \"with regard to various aspects of [the underlying declaratory judgement \r\n  action.\" Gilreath stated: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Prior to this case being filed I advised Mr. Poole that \r\n    in my opinion there was a serious issue regarding the manner in which the \r\n    subdivision restrictions had been amended. Prior to this opinion I had done \r\n    some research, reviewed the public records and plats relating to the subdivision \r\n    restrictions and discussed these issues with several attorneys in Greenville \r\n    who are experienced real estate attorneys. In short, I believe this was a \r\n    meritorious action which needed to be brought in order to clear up numerous \r\n    issues which were raised by the method and manner in which the subdivision \r\n    restrictions were amended. \r\n\r\n\r\nDana C. Mitchell, III, who was initial counsel to Poole \r\n  until a conflict of interest arose, avowed in an affidavit dated July 28, 1998, \r\n  that he researched the law and also met with experienced attorneys regarding \r\n  the case: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Based on the above, I advised the Plaintiffs (prior to the \r\n    initiation of this litigation) that there was a serious legal issue regarding \r\n    the manner in which the subdivision restrictions have been amended which could, \r\n    in good faith, be the subject of litigation to resolve the disputed issues \r\n    which were involved. Further, I advised the Plaintiffs that I believed their \r\n    position had legal merit, at least sufficient to warrant it being submitted \r\n    to a court or jury for determination.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, John G. Cheros, an attorney who was consulted by \r\n  Gilreath before the underlying declaratory judgment action was filed, declared \r\n  in an affidavit dated August 4, 1998, that he reviewed the public records of \r\n  the Park Lake Development:\r\n\r\n\r\n  After reviewing these records I advised Mr. Gilreath that \r\n    in my opinion there was a significant issue regarding the manner in which \r\n    the subdivision restrictions had been amended. From my review of these records \r\n    it appeared there was a serious question involved in the manner in which the \r\n    owners of the property voted and that short of a declaratory action, there \r\n    was, in my opinion, a cloud on the title of Mr. Poole's property. While I \r\n    am not familiar with the issues raised in this particular action, I believe \r\n    that an action for declaratory judgment to determine the validity of the amendments \r\n    to the Parkins Lake Subdivision restrictions was meritorious, involved real \r\n    issues, and was necessary to clear up questions raised by the method and manner \r\n    in which these restrictions were amended. \r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of Pond Place's case, among other motions, \r\n  Poole moved for a directed verdict. He argued the lis pendens was authorized \r\n  by law, was properly filed, and was absolutely privileged. The motion was denied. \r\n  Then, at the close of his own case, Poole renewed his motion for directed verdict. \r\n  The trial judge likewise denied this motion, finding that the filing of a lis \r\n  pendens is not absolutely privileged, but is qualifiedly privileged. \r\n\r\nIn its closing arguments, Pond Place argued the trial was \r\n  essentially about \"Mr. Poole.\" Pond Place effectively dismissed all but \"Mr. \r\n  Poole\" as a defendant to the slander of title action and requested a full judgment \r\n  against only him. The jury rendered its verdict in favor of Pond Place and Edwin \r\n  Collins against Poole alone. The verdict reads: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Verdict for Pond Place Partners, Inc for $157,584.00/100 \r\n    special damages and $75,000.00/100 punitive damages \r\n    against David C. Poole. \r\n\r\n  Verdict for Edwin P. Collins for $220,416.00/100 \r\n    special damages and $75,000.00/100 punitive damages \r\n    against David C. Poole. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the jury was excused, Poole moved for a JNOV, a new \r\n  trial, and a new trial nisi. Poole's attorney argued there was no evidence in \r\n  the record to support the jury's finding of malice and the filing of the lis \r\n  pendens was absolutely privileged. The court denied the motions for JNOV and \r\n  new trial absolute and scheduled a hearing to consider remittitur arguments. \r\n  At the later hearing, the circuit judge commented he \"[thought Poole] could \r\n  have filed a lawsuit without filing a lis pendensâ€¦. and there wouldn't be any \r\n  slander of title action.\" He declined to adjust the jury's verdict. Poole appeals. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPoole argues he was entitled to a directed verdict because: \r\n  (1) the elements of slander of title were not established; and (2) because the \r\n  filing of his lis pendens was absolutely privileged. Alternately, Poole argues \r\n  he is entitled to a new trial based on various evidentiary errors and the denial \r\n  of some requested charges. We determine the action \r\n  on the former arguments; thus, we need not address Poole's arguments for a new \r\n  trial.\r\n\r\n\"When reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict \r\n  or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, this Court must view the evidence and \r\n  all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" \r\n  Wintersteen v.

Declaratory Judgment Action and \r\n  Lis Pendens\r\n\r\nPoole filed the underlying action attempting to invalidate \r\n  the amendments to the covenants pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments \r\n  Act. (5) \"The Declaratory Judgment Act should \r\n  be liberally construed to accomplish its intended purpose of affording a speedy \r\n  and inexpensive method of deciding legal disputes and of settling legal rights \r\n  and relationships, without awaiting a violation of the rights or a disturbance \r\n  of the relationships.\" Graham v.

McNair, 255 S.C. 150, 177 S.E.2d 551 (1970)). \r\n  This requirement is satisfied by \"[a]ny person interested under a deed . . . \r\n  written contract or other writings constituting a contract or whose rights, \r\n  status or other legal relations are affected by a â€¦ contract or franchise may \r\n  have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument, \r\n  â€¦ contract or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status or other \r\n  legal relations thereunder.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-53-30 (1977); see also \r\n  Rule 57, SCRCP. \r\n\r\nPoole concurrently filed a lis pendens on the property of \r\n  the Parkins Lake Subdivision. It is undisputed that Poole, as well as every \r\n  other party listed in the caption sub judice, has some ownership interest \r\n  in the subdivision. The purpose of a notice of pendency of an action is to inform \r\n  a purchaser or encumbrancer that a particular piece of real property is subject \r\n  to litigation. Shelley Constr. Co. v. Sea Garden Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. \r\n  24, 336 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1985); Wooten v. Seanch, 187 S.C. 219, 196 \r\n  S.E. 877 (1938). \"A properly filed lis pendens binds subsequent purchasers or \r\n  encumbrancers to all proceedings evolving from the litigation.\" South Carolina \r\n  Nat'l Bank v. Cook, 291 S.C. 530, 532, 354 S.E.2d 562, 562 (1987). Generally, \r\n  the filing of a lis pendens places a cloud on title which prevents the owner \r\n  from freely disposing of the property before the litigation is resolved. Shelley \r\n  Constr., 287 S.C. at 24, 336 S.E.2d at 491-492. \r\n\r\nA lis pendens may be filed \"[i]n an action affecting the \r\n  title to real property â€¦ not more than twenty days before filing the complaint \r\n  or at any time afterwards â€¦ with the clerk of each county in which the property \r\n  is situated a notice of the pendency of the action, containing the names of \r\n  the parties, the object of the action and the description of the property in \r\n  that county affected thereby.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-11-10 (1977). Since the filing \r\n  of a lis pendens is an extraordinary privilege granted by statute, strict compliance \r\n  with the statutory provisions is required. See Cook, 291 S.C. \r\n  at 532, 354 S.E.2d at 563 (1987) (finding a complaint filed more than twenty \r\n  days after the filing of the lis pendens renders the lis pendens invalid). \r\n\r\n\r\n  Moreover, \r\n\r\n  The lis pendens mechanism is not designed to aid either \r\n    side in a dispute between private parties. Rather, lis pendens is designed \r\n    primarily to protect unidentified third parties by alerting prospective purchasers \r\n    of property as to what is already on public record, i.e., the fact of a suit \r\n    involving property. Thus, it notifies potential purchasers that there is pending \r\n    litigation that may affect their title to real property and that the purchaser \r\n    will take subject to the judgment, without any substantive rights. \r\n\r\n\r\n51 Am. Jur. 2d Lis Pendens Â§ 2 (2000). \r\n\r\nTherefore, an action \"affecting the title to real property\" \r\n  clearly allows the filing of a lis pendens by an interested party in order to \r\n  protect their ownership interest in the property subject to the litigation. \r\n  Such actions include actions attempting to set aside a fraudulent conveyance \r\n  of real property, see Lebovitz v. Mudd, 293 S.C. 49, 358 S.E.2d \r\n  698 (1987); Dickerson v. Oliphant, 160 S.C. 288, 158 S.E. 546 (1931); \r\n  Berger v. Shea, 258 S.E.2d 621 (Ga. Ct. App. 1979); and actions to establish \r\n  a constructive trust over real estate, see  Finley v. Hughes, \r\n  106 F.Supp. 355 (E.D.S.C. 1952); Kelly v. Perry, 531 P.2d 139 (Ariz. \r\n  1975). They also include actions to quiet title, see Stewart v. Fahey, \r\n  481 P.2d 519 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1971); actions to establish the existence of an \r\n  easement, see Procacci v. Zacco, 402 So.2d 425 (Fla. Dist. Ct. \r\n  App. 1981); actions to reform deeds to resolve a boundary dispute, see \r\n  Houska v. Frederick, 447 S.W.2d 514 (Mo. 1969); actions for specific \r\n  performance, see Panfel v. Boyd, 371 S.E.2d 222 (Ga. Ct. App. \r\n  1988); Haupman v. Edwards, Inc., 553 P.2d 975 (Mont. 1976); Wendy's \r\n  of South Jersey v. Blanchard Mgmt. Corp. of N.J., 406 A.2d 1337 (N.J. Super. \r\n  Ct. Ch. Div. 1979); and actions for mortgage foreclosures, see Palmer \r\n  v. Shelby Plaza Motel, Inc., 443 So.2d 285 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983). Where \r\n  no real property is implicated, however, like when the enforcement of a lien \r\n  is against the substitute security under the \"bonding out\" procedure of the \r\n  mechanic's lien statute rather than against the original real property itself, \r\n  a notice of pendency of action need not be filed. Shelley Constr. Co. v. \r\n  Sea Garden Homes, Inc., 287 S.C. 24, 336 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1985); see \r\n  also Hansen v. Kohler, 550 P.2d 186 (Utah 1976) (distinguishing the \r\n  case of Birch v. Fuller, 337 P.2d 964 (Utah 1959), in which the court \r\n  found no privilege for filing a lis pendens because no court action was filed \r\n  in conjunction with the lis pendens making it not filed in accordance with the \r\n  law and, therefore, not actionable under slander of title); Atkinson v. Fundaro, \r\n  400 So.2d 1324 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981) (finding no privilege for the filing \r\n  of a lis pendens on property that had absolutely no involvement in the underlying \r\n  litigation); Ex parte Boykin, 656 So.2d 821, 826 n.4 (Ala. Civ. App. \r\n  1994) (Noting that \"[o]ne who places a lis pendens notice on property without \r\n  a 'colorable claim' of right to or interest in the property subjects themselves \r\n  to a claim for slander of title.\"). \r\n\r\nII. Slander of Title\r\n\r\n\"The term 'slander of title' is defined as a false and malicious \r\n  statement, oral or written, made in disparagement of a person's title to real \r\n  or personal property, causing him injury.\" 50 Am. Jur. 2d Libel &amp; Slander \r\n  Â§ 548 (1995). Generally, an action under slander of title may only be maintained \r\n  by one who possesses an estate or interest in the affected property. See \r\n  generally Jeffrey F. Ghent, Slander of Title: Sufficiency of Plaintiff's \r\n  Interest in Real Property to Maintain Action, 86 A.L.R.4th 738 (1991). \"The \r\n  tort of slander of title is almost identical to the tort of product disparagement, \r\n  the only difference being that the former tort involves aspersing the quality \r\n  of one's title to property and the latter tort involves aspersing the quality \r\n  of one's property.\" Wendy's of South Jersey, Inc. v. Blanchard Mgmt. Corp. \r\n  of N.J., 406 A.2d 1337, 1338 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 1979). \r\n\r\nSlander of title is grounded in the tort of injurious falsehood. \r\n  See id. (\"Both torts are specific examples of the general tort \r\n  of injurious falsehood and the same privileges which apply to the torts of personal \r\n  defamation apply to the tort of injurious falsehood.\"); Zamarello v. Yale, \r\n  514 P.2d 228 (Alaska 1973); Procacci v. Zacco, 402 So.2d 425 (Fla. Dist. \r\n  Ct. App. 1981). In this light, the first comment of section 624 of the Restatement \r\n  (Second) of Torts explains: \r\n\r\n\r\n  The particular form of injurious falsehood that involves \r\n    disparagement of the property in land, chattels, or intangible things, is \r\n    commonly called \"slander of title.\" The earliest cases in which it arose involved \r\n    oral aspersions cast upon the plaintiff's ownership of land, as a result of \r\n    which he was prevented from selling or leasing it; and the decisions went \r\n    upon an analogy to the kind of oral defamation of the person that is actionable \r\n    only upon proof of special harm. (See Â§ 569). The extension of the \r\n    liability to other kinds of injurious falsehood has left the terms \"slander \r\n    of title,\" and \"disparagement,\" merely as special names given to this particular \r\n    form of the tort. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe association with personal defamation through the word \r\n  \"slander\" has unfortunately tended to lead the courts to regard the plaintiff's \r\n  property interest as somehow personified, and so defamed, and thus to look to \r\n  the law of defamation. \"Slander of title,\" however, differs from personal defamation \r\n  in at least three important respects. One \r\n  is that proof of special harm is required in all cases. (See Â§ 633). Another \r\n  is that there must be proof of a greater amount of fault than negligence on \r\n  the part of the defendant regarding the falsity of the statement. (See Â§ 623A, \r\n  especially Comment d). The third is that because of the economic interest involved \r\n  the disparagement of property may in a proper case be enjoined, whereas defamation \r\n  normally cannot. \r\n\r\nId. at cmt. a, quoted in Lone v. Brown, 489 \r\n  A.2d 1192, 1195 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1985). The Supreme Court of Rhode \r\n  Island explained the history of the action slander of title in its state: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Shortly before the turn of the century our predecessors \r\n    in Hopkins v. Drowne, 21 R.I. 20, 23, 41 A. 567 (1898), recognized \r\n    the common-law action of slander of title. The court emphasized that damages \r\n    could be recovered in an action for slander \r\n    of title upon a showing that the defendant maliciously uttered false statements \r\n    about the plaintiff's ownership of real estate which resulted in the plaintiff \r\n    sustaining an actual pecuniary loss.\r\n\r\n  The court in Hopkins emphasized that in \r\n    using the term malice it was not using the term in its 'worst sense,' but \r\n    described malice as an intent to deceive or injure and emphasized that in \r\n    order to establish malice, the record must present evidence of the making \r\n    of a false statement that is made with full knowledge of its falsity, and \r\n    for the specific purpose of injuring the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrough v. Foley, 572 A.2d 63, 67 (R.I. 1990). \r\n\r\nBy contrast, our modern history with the tort for slander \r\n  of title is relatively brief. The case of Huff v. Jennings, 319 S.C. \r\n  142, 459 S.E.2d 886 (Ct. App. 1995), sets forth for the first time in South \r\n  Carolina the specific elements of the common law action for slander of title. \r\n  The action itself, through our reception statute, has always been a part of \r\n  the law of South Carolina. Section 15-1-50 provides that &quot;[a]ll, and every \r\n  part, of the common law of England, where it is not altered by the Code or inconsistent \r\n  with the Constitution or laws of this State, is hereby continued in full force \r\n  and effect in the same manner as before the adoption of this section.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 14-1-50 (1976); see also State v. Charleston Bridge Co., \r\n  113 S.C. 116, 126, 101 S.E. 657, 660 (1919) (the reception statute is \"merely \r\n  declaratory in its nature\" in stating that South Carolina courts are guided \r\n  by the principles of the settled common law from England). Slander of title \r\n  has long been considered a common law action in England. See  TXO \r\n  Prod. Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp., 419 S.E.2d 870, 877-879 (W. Va. \r\n  1992), aff'd, 509 U.S. 443, 113 S. Ct. 2711, 125 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1993) (citing \r\n  authority from the Queen's Bench and King's Bench from the sixteenth and seventeenth \r\n  centuries). Therefore, it is the common law of South Carolina as well. See \r\n  Huff, 319 S.C. at 148, 459 S.E.2d at 890. In Huff, we merely clarified \r\n  its position in our jurisprudence. \r\n  \r\n  Huff noted that the second Restatement of Torts provides the general guidelines \r\n  \"which modern courts generally follow in identifying the elements of slander \r\n  of title.\" Id. at 149, 459 S.E.2d at 891. Restatement (Second) of Torts \r\n  Â§ 623A (1977) provides: \r\n\r\n\r\n  One who publishes a false statement harmful to the interests \r\n    of another is subject to liability for pecuniary loss resulting to the other \r\n    if\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (a) he intends for publication of the statement to result \r\n      in harm to interests of the other having a pecuniary value, or either recognizes \r\n      or should recognize that it is likely to do so, and\r\n\r\n    (b) he knows that the statement is false or acts in reckless \r\n      disregard to its truth or falsity\r\n\r\n  \r\n  Additionally, Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 624 (1977) \r\n    annunciates:\r\n\r\n  The rules on liability for the publication of an injurious \r\n    falsehood stated in Â§ 623A apply to the publication of a false statement disparaging \r\n    another's property rights in land, chattels or intangible things, that the \r\n    publisher should recognize as likely to result in pecuniary harm to the other \r\n    through the conduct of third persons in respect to the other's interests in \r\n    the property.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn light of these Restatement provisions, the Supreme Court \r\n  of Appeals of West Virginia, in TXO Production Corporation v. Alliance Resources \r\n  Corporation, 419 S.E.2d 870 (W. Va. 1992), aff'd, 509 U.S. 443, 113 \r\n  S. Ct. 2711, 125 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1993), (6) devised \r\n  a six point test that a plaintiff must establish to prove an action for slander \r\n  of title. We adopted this test. Huff, 319 S.C. at 149, 459 S.E.2d at \r\n  891. Therefore, to maintain an action for slander of title in South Carolina, \r\n  the plaintiff must establish: \"(1) the publication (2) with malice (3) of a \r\n  false statement (4) that is derogatory to plaintiff's title and (5) causes special \r\n  damages (6) as a result of diminished value of the property in the eyes of third \r\n  parties.\" Id. (citing TXO, 419 S.E.2d at 879). \r\n\r\nIn Huff, Husband asserted a cause of action for slander \r\n  of title against Wife's divorce attorney. Wife's attorney had filed a lien for \r\n  attorney's fees against property that Husband had elected to buy out Wife's \r\n  interest in, as was provided for in the divorce decree. Wife's attorney filed \r\n  her lien pursuant to a statutory provision this Court found was not applicable \r\n  to the facts of the case. That is, Â§ 20-3-145 stated that only attorney fees \r\n  awarded by the court, which these fees were not, constitute an lien on the debtor \r\n  spouse's property. Id. at 145 n.1, 459 S.E.2d at 888 n.1. Husband satisfied \r\n  Wife's debt to remove the cloud on the property so that he could have it refinanced. \r\n  We found this was an adequate example of slander of title. The \"[w]rongfully \r\n  recording an unfounded claim against the property of another generally is actionable \r\n  as slander of title.\" Id. at 149, 459 S.E.2d at 891. \r\n\r\nIII.  Pleadings are Privileged \r\n\r\nPrivileged communications are either absolute or qualified. \r\n  \"When a communication is absolutely privileged, no action lies for its publication, \r\n  no matter what the circumstances under which it is published, i.e., an \r\n  action will not lie even if the report is made with malice.\" Hainer v. American \r\n  Med. Intern, Inc., 328 S.C. 128, 135, 492 S.E.2d 103, 106 (1997) (citations \r\n  omitted). A statement is made with actual malice when the speaker acts with \r\n  knowledge that the statement is false or with reckless disregard of whether \r\n  it was false or not. Fleming v. Rose, 338 S.C. 524, 526 S.E.2d 732 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000), cert. granted; Huff  , 319 S.C. at 150, 459 S.E.2d \r\n  at 891; accord Hainer, 328 S.C. at 135, 492 S.E.2d at 107 (\"Actual malice can \r\n  mean the defendant acted recklessly or wantonly, or with conscious disregard \r\n  of the plaintiff's rights.\"). \r\n\r\n\"The [absolute] privilege covers anything that may be said \r\n  in relation to the matter at issue, whether it be in the pleadings, in affidavits, \r\n  or in open court.\" W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, The Law of Torts, Â§ 114, \r\n  at 817 (5th ed. 1984). \"At common law, parties to judicial proceedings were \r\n  granted an absolute privilege to use defamatory language because of the overriding \r\n  public interest that persons should speak \r\n  freely and fearlessly in litigation, 'uninfluenced by the possibility of being \r\n  brought to account in an action for defamation.'\" Stewart v. Fahey, 481 \r\n  P.2d 519, 520-521 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1971). Nearly three score years ago, the New \r\n  York Supreme Court explained: \r\n\r\n\r\n  The interest of society requires that whenever men seek \r\n    the aid of courts of justice, either to assert or to defend rights, of person, \r\n    property or liberty, speech and writing therein must be untrammelled and free. \r\n    The good of all must prevail over the incidental harm to the individual. So \r\n    the law offers a shield to the one who in a legal proceeding publishes a libel, \r\n    not because it wishes to encourage libel, but because if men were \r\n    afraid to set forth their rights in legal proceedings for fear of liability \r\n    to libel suits greater harm would result, in the suppression of the truth. \r\n    The law gives to all who take part in judicial proceedings, judge, attorney, \r\n    counsel, printer, witness, litigant, a right to speak and to write, subject \r\n    only to one limitation, that what is said or \r\n    written bears upon the subject of litigation, that is, is pertinent, relevant, \r\n    germane thereto. \r\n\r\n\r\nKraushaar v. LaVin, 39 N.Y.S.2d 880, 883 (N.Y. Sup. \r\n  Ct. 1943) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has long recognized that relevant pleadings, \r\n  even if defamatory, are absolutely privileged. McKesson &amp; Robbins v. \r\n  Newsome, 206 S.C. 269, 33 S.E.2d 585 (1945); Texas Co. v. C.W. Brewer \r\n  &amp; Co., 180 S.C. 325, 185 S.E.2d 623 (1936); Rogers v. Wise, 193 \r\n  S.C. 5, 7 S.E.2d 517 (1940); Sanders v. Rollinson, 33 S.C. Law (2 Strob.) \r\n  447 (1848) (stating an action for slander based on a defamatory affidavit was \r\n  a non-suit; the proper attack is under malicious prosecution);  accord Lone \r\n  v. Brown, 489 A.2d 1192, 1195 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1985) (\"It is well \r\n  established that statements, written or oral, made by judges, attorneys, witnesses, \r\n  parties or jurors in the course of judicial proceedings, which have some relation \r\n  thereto, are absolutely privileged from slander or defamation actions, even \r\n  if the statements are made with malice.\"); Kropp v. Prather, 526 S.W.2d \r\n  283, 286 (Tex. Civ. App. 1975) (\"Any communication, oral or written, uttered \r\n  or published in the due course of a judicial proceeding is absolutely privileged \r\n  and cannot form the basis for a cause of action in libel or slander.\"). \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn Texas Company v. C.W. Brewer &amp; Company, 180 \r\n  S.C. 325, 185 S.E.2d 623 (1936), the Supreme Court established that pleadings, \r\n  although they may constitute libel on their own, are absolutely privileged if \r\n  they are relevant and legitimately related to the issues and inquiry at trial. \r\n  That is, \r\n\r\n\r\nDefamatory matter contained in pleadings filed according to law in a court\r\nhaving jurisdiction, if relevant and pertinent to the issues in the case, is\r\nabsolutely privileged; and it is immaterial that the allegations are false and\r\nmalicious and are made under a cover and pretense of a wrongful or\r\ngroundless suitâ€¦. The weight of American authority is that the privilege is\r\nabsolute when, and only when, the matter tendered is pertinent or material\r\nor relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 327, 185 S.E. at 623.\r\n\r\nThe Court later confirmed in the case of McKesson &amp; \r\n  Robbins v. Newsome, 206 S.C. 269, 33 S.E.2d 585 (1945), that pleadings, \r\n  even if defamatory, are absolutely privileged. \"Libelous or defamatory statements \r\n  in pleadings, when pertinent or material or relevant to real issues involved, \r\n  are privileged, that the pertinency or materiality or relevancy of such statements \r\n  is for the determination of the Court and not a jury, and that in determining \r\n  this issue pleadings must be liberally interpreted and all doubt resolved in \r\n  favor of relevancy.\" Id. at 275, 33 S.E.2d at 587. \r\n\r\nThe above authority accords with the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 587\r\n(1977), which provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nA party to a private litigation â€¦ is absolutely privileged to publish\r\ndefamatory matter concerning another in communications preliminary to a\r\nproposed judicial proceeding, or in the institution of or during the course\r\nand as a part of, a judicial proceeding in which he participates, if the matter\r\nhas some relation to the proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently, this Court reiterated that the \"common law rule \r\n  protecting statements of judges, parties and witnesses offered in the course \r\n  of judicial proceedings from a cause of action in defamation is well recognized \r\n  in this jurisdiction.\" Crowell v. Herring, 301 S.C. 424, 429, 392 S.E.2d \r\n  464, 467 (Ct. App. 1990) (citations omitted). That is, an \"absolute privilege \r\n  exists as to any utterance arising out of the judicial proceeding and having \r\n  any reasonable relation to it, including preliminary steps leading to judicial \r\n  action of any official nature provided those steps bear reasonable relationship \r\n  to it.\" Id. at 430, 392 S.E.2d at 467 (citing Restatement (Second) of \r\n  Torts Â§ 587, cmt e). \r\n\r\nIV. Other Jurisdictions\r\n\r\n\"[T]he majority of cases from other jurisdictions that have \r\n  dealt with the question have held that such filing [of a lis pendens] enjoys \r\n  the absolute privilege that is accorded to judicial proceedings.\" Superior \r\n  Constr. Inc. v. Linnerooth, 712 P.2d 1378, 1380 (N.M. 1986) (citing Albertson \r\n  v. Raboff, 295 P.2d 405 (Ca. 1956); Stewart v. Fahey, 481 P.2d 519 \r\n  (Ariz. 1971); Haupman v. Edwards, Inc., 553 P.2d 975 (Mont. 1976); Hansen \r\n  v. Kohler, 550 P.2d 186 (Utah 1976); Wendy's of South Jersey, Inc. v. \r\n  Blanchard Mgmt. Corp. of N.J., 406 A.2d 1337 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 1979); \r\n  Zamarello v. Yale, 514 P.2d 228 (Alaska 1973); Procacci v. Zacco, \r\n  402 So.2d 425 (Fla. App. 1981)). The rationale set forth by these jurisdictions \r\n  is: \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  With few exceptions, any publication made in a judicial proceeding\r\nenjoys absolute privilege from later charges of defamation.\r\n\r\n    &nbsp;  The sole purpose of recording a notice of lis pendens is to give to\r\nprospective buyers constructive notice of the pendency of the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n    &nbsp;  The notice of lis pendens is purely incidental to the action wherein it is\r\nfiled, and refers specifically to such action and has no existence apart\r\nfrom that action.\r\n\r\n    &nbsp;  The recording of a notice of lis pendens is in effect a republication of the\r\nproceedings in the action and therefore, it is accorded the same absolute\r\nprivilege as any other publication incident to the action.\r\n  \r\n\r\nLinnerooth, 712 P.2d at 1381;  see also Brough \r\n  v. Foley, 572 A.2d 63 (R.I. 1990) (holding that since the filing of a lis \r\n  pendens is incident to the filing of the complaint, if the plaintiff had probable \r\n  cause to bring the action, then neither of these actions can be considered slander \r\n  of title.); Kropp v. Prather, 526 S.W.2d 283, 287 (Tex. Civ. App. 1975) \r\n  (\"Because the recording of a lis pendens is specifically authorized by statute \r\n  and has no existence separate and apart from the litigation of which it gives \r\n  notice â€¦ the filing of a notice of lis pendens â€¦ is a part of [a] 'judicial \r\n  proceeding'\" and thus forms no basis for an action for libel or slander.);  \r\n  Dethlefs v. Beau Maison Dev. Corp., 511 So.2d 112, 117 (Miss. 1987) (\"The \r\n  lis pendens notice was a privileged communication and therefore not actionable \r\n  for slander of title.\"); Louis v. Blalock, 543 S.W.2d 715, 718 (Tex. \r\n  Civ. App. 1976) (\"[A] claim, either oral or written, asserted in the course \r\n  of a judicial proceeding, cannot be made the basis of a civil action for slander \r\n  of title.\"); Manders v. Manders, 897 F.Supp. 972 (S.D.Tex. 1995) (finding \r\n  no basis for a slander of title action arising out of the filing of a lis pendens); \r\n  Palmer v. Shelby Plaza Motel, Inc., 443 So.2d 285 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. \r\n  1983) (lis pendens describing only the property covered by the mortgage which \r\n  is being foreclosed is absolutely privileged); Pryor v. Findley, 949 \r\n  P.2d 1218 (Okla. Civ. App. 1997) (ruling the filing of a divorce petition, which \r\n  purportedly caused a cloud on title, was protected by absolute privilege for \r\n  slander of title claim); Lone v. Brown, 489 A.2d 1192 (N.J. 1985) (stating \r\n  the filing of a lis pendens is merely a republication of the complaint and is, \r\n  therefore, absolutely privileged). \r\n\r\nSeveral courts cite the seminal California case of Albertson \r\n  v. Raboff, 295 P.2d 405 (Ca. 1956), for the proposition that the filing \r\n  of a lis pendens is absolutely privileged. Berger v. Shea, 258 S.E.2d \r\n  621 (Ga. Ct. App. 1979); Houska v. Frederick, 447 S.W.2d 514 (Mo. 1969); \r\n  Stewart v. Fahey, 481 P.2d 519 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1971);  see also Kelly \r\n  v. Perry, 531 P.2d 139 (Ariz. 1975) (citing Stewart v. Fahey). Generally, \r\n  however, where courts do not find that an absolute privilege applies to the \r\n  filing of a lis pendens in a slander of title action, they find a qualified \r\n  privilege subject to a finding of malice. Westfield Dev. Co. v. Rifle Inv. \r\n  Assocs., 786 P.2d 1112, 1116-1118 (Colo. 1990) (finding that \"a party has \r\n  only a qualified privilege to interfere with an existing contract by means of \r\n  initiating litigation and filing pleadings and notice of lis pendens\" because \r\n  the need to restrict lawsuits brought in bad faith outweighs the policy of encouraging \r\n  free access to the courts under an absolute privilege); Kensington Dev. Corp. \r\n  v. Israel, 419 N.W.2d 241, 244 (Wis. 1988) (declaring the filing of a lis \r\n  pendens is only conditionally privileged; \"[i]f the absolute privilege rule \r\n  is applied, the slander of title statute â€¦ would be nullified because it would \r\n  be virtually impossible to assert a claim if all communications in judicial \r\n  proceedings relating to property were absolutely privileged\"); see also \r\n  Annotation, Recording of instrument purporting to affect title as slander \r\n  of title 39 A.L.R.2d 840 (1955). \r\n\r\nIn Superior Construction, Inc. v. Linnerooth, 712 \r\n  P.2d 1378 (N.M. 1986), Superior Construction filed a lis pendens in conjunction \r\n  with an action brought to have a deed of property from a third party to the \r\n  Linnerooths declared null and void. This action was ultimately dismissed and \r\n  the Linnerooths were subsequently awarded damages on their counterclaim for \r\n  slander of title. After discussing the law of privilege from other jurisdictions, \r\n  the court noted it is \"only in extreme cases that a publication made in connection \r\n  with a judicial proceeding will serve as the basis for a defamatory action.\" \r\n  Id. at 1382 (citation omitted). These cases include judicial proceedings \r\n  \"in which the defamatory material is irrelevant or immaterial to the cause or \r\n  subject of inquiry.\" Id. However, since a lis pendens \"may be properly \r\n  filed only if plaintiff pleads a cause of action which involves or affects the \r\n  title to, or any interest in or a lien upon, specifically described real property,\" \r\n  the filing of the lis pendens in conjunction with the underlying complaint, \r\n  \"no matter how malicious or false, was relevant and material to the claim by \r\n  Superior â€¦ of an ownership interest in the land.\" Id. at 1381-82. \r\n\r\nLikewise, in Wendy's of South Jersey, Inc. v. Blanchard \r\n  Management Corporation of New Jersey, 406 A.2d 1337 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. \r\n  Div. 1979), the court identified the public policy reasons why the filing of \r\n  a lis pendens should be privileged. \"[T]he notice of Lis pendens exists â€¦ for \r\n  the proper administration of justice â€¦. [and it] has no existence apart from \r\n  a judicial proceeding since an action [brought in New Jersey] must be pending \r\n  for the notice to be filed.\" Id. at 1340. The court explained that the \r\n  underlying requirement that the privileged statements must be made in the course \r\n  of the proceeding and have some relation thereto; moreover, the statement must \r\n  be given a \"liberal construction\": \r\n\r\n\r\n  \"[F]or otherwise the speaker or writer would have to decide \r\n    the question of jurisdiction at his peril, and the sweep of the privilege \r\n    would be inhibited at the cost of the policy considerations which give it \r\n    life.\" The relation to the proceeding \"thus required is not a technical legal \r\n    relevancy, such as would, necessarily, justify insertion of the matter in \r\n    a pleading or its admission into evidence, but rather a general frame of reference \r\n    and relationship to the subject matter of the action.\" There is no doubt that \r\n    a notice of Lis pendens satisfies this requirement of the privilege. Under \r\n    our Lis pendens statute â€¦ a notice of Lis pendens Can be filed in any action \r\n    affecting real estate. This written notice shall contain the title of the \r\n    action, the general object of the action and the description of the real estate \r\n    involved. The notice is in effect a republication of some of [the] \r\n    essential information contained in the complaint filed in the action. \r\n     Thus, since all of the information contained in the notice of Lis pendens \r\n    directly relates to the action, this requirement of the privilege is met. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 1339 (emphasis added, citations omitted).\r\n\r\nIn Albertson v. Raboff, 295 P.2d 405 (Ca. 1956), \r\n  the Supreme Court of California expanded the analysis, stating \"[t]he publication \r\n  of the pleadings is unquestionably clothed with absolute privilege, and we have \r\n  concluded that the republication thereof by recording a notice of lis pendens \r\n  is similarly privileged.\" Id. at 408;  see also Zamarello v. Yale, \r\n  514 P.2d 228, 230 (Alaska 1973) (citing Albertson). Raboff brought an \r\n  action against Albertson in which he sought a money judgment and either a lien \r\n  on real property owned by Albertson or a judgment declaring that her title in \r\n  the property was obtained by fraud to avoid creditors. Raboff also filed a lis \r\n  pendens in conjunction with his action. At trial, although Raboff won a money \r\n  judgment, the actions involving an interest in the property were resolved in \r\n  Albertson's favor. In addressing Albertson's action for slander of title, the \r\n  court found that a recorded notice of lis pendens was expressly authorized by \r\n  statute. Id. at 408. Moreover, the court explained, \"[i]t would be anomalous \r\n  to hold that a litigant is privileged to make a publication necessary to bring \r\n  an action but that he can be sued for defamation if he lets any one know that \r\n  he has brought it, particularly when he is expressly authorized by statute to \r\n  let all the world know that he has brought it.\" Id. at 409 (citation \r\n  omitted);  accord Hansen v. Kohler, 550 P.2d 186 (Utah 1976), and Houska \r\n  v. Frederick, 447 S.W.2d 514 (Mo. 1969) (both quoting this proposition). \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Superior Court of New Jersey agreed. \"It would be incongruous \r\n  indeed to say that the complaint and notice of appeal are privileged but the \r\n  notice of lis pendens filed in the same pending judicial proceeding, designed \r\n  to give notice and preserve the status quo, would not also be privileged.\" Lone \r\n  v. Brown, 489 A.2d 1192, 1196 (N.J. 1985). \r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, the Supreme Court of California summarized:\r\n\r\n  It is our opinion that the privilege applies to any publication, \r\n    such as the recordation of a notice of lis pendens, that is required â€¦ or \r\n    permitted â€¦ by law in the course of a judicial proceeding to achieve the objects \r\n    of the litigation, even though the publication is made outside the courtroom \r\n    and no function of the court or its officers is invoked. Thus, \r\n    it is not limited to the pleadings, the oral or written evidence, to publications \r\n    in open court or in briefs or affidavits. If the \r\n    publication has a reasonable relation to the action and is permitted by law, \r\n    the absolute privilege attaches.   It therefore attaches to the \r\n    recordation of a notice of lis pendens, for such a publication is permitted \r\n    by law, and like other documents that may be filed in an action, it has a \r\n    reasonable relation thereto and it is immaterial that it is recorded with \r\n    the County Recorder instead of being filed with the County Clerk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbertson, 295 P.2d at 409 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nIn the case sub judice, it is undisputed that all \r\n  of the litigants involved in this and its underlying declaratory judgment action \r\n  had some ownership interest in the Park Lake Subdivision. In fact, the action \r\n  is itself only between the various property owners within the subdivision. Restrictive \r\n  covenants, by their very nature, clearly affect a property owner's ownership \r\n  of their subject land. Here, Poole testified at length about the amendment to \r\n  the covenants and the feared change to the neighborhood it will bring in the \r\n  future. Thus, under the statutory authority alone, we find the filing of a lis \r\n  pendens in this case was authorized. We note our Supreme Court inherently agrees \r\n  with this holding in that it refused to dissolve the lis pendens before a full \r\n  adjudication of the declaratory judgment action was completed. \r\n\r\nGenerally, in South Carolina, an unqualified privilege does \r\n  not depend on the rigid requirement of a strictly legislative or judicial proceeding; \r\n  its limits are fixed rather by considerations of public policy.  See Corbin \r\n  v. Washington Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 278 F.Supp. 393 (D.S.C. 1968) \r\n  (stating this proposition after a brief review of privilege in South Carolina). \r\n  Corbin involved an action for libel brought against a party to an arbitration \r\n  proceeding for statements in a letter which were submitted to the board of arbitrators. \r\n  The court, however, ultimately found these statements privileged, explaining \r\n  if \"arbitration is to be safely utilized as an effective means of resolving \r\n  controversy, the absolute immunity attaching to its proceedings must extend \r\n  beyond the arbitrators themselves; it must extend to all 'indispensable proceedings, \r\n  such as the receipt of evidence and argument thereon.\" Id. at 398. The \r\n  Court continued: \"The absolute privilege attaching to judicial proceedings embraces \r\n  communications between counsel, statements made by counsel to a prospective \r\n  witness, arguments or statements by counsel in course of proceeding, any statements \r\n  made by witnesses in the course of proceedings, and even statements in the course \r\n  of negotiation of a settlement.\" Id. \r\n\r\nWe find a lis pendens filed in conjunction with an action \r\n  involving the same real estate is merely another form of pleading. It is premised \r\n  upon and must be filed in time in conjunction with an underlying complaint involving \r\n  an issue of property.  See South Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Cook, 291 S.C. \r\n  530, 354 S.E.2d 562 (1987) (finding a complaint filed more than twenty days \r\n  after the filing of the lis pendens renders the lis pendens invalid). In Rogers \r\n  v. Wise, 193 S.C. 5, 7 S.E.2d 517 (1940), the South Carolina Supreme Court \r\n  found that an attorney's allegedly libelous and slanderous statements which \r\n  were first dictated to his stenographer and then included in a letter sent to \r\n  another attorney were absolutely privileged.  See  id. at 6-7, \r\n  7 S.E.2d at 516-517 (\"If attorneys cannot freely and frankly discuss their client's \r\n  business between themselves, by word of mouth when they are face to face, or \r\n  by letter when separated, and thereby evaluate and determine the client's rights, \r\n  then, it seems to me, that the rights of all clients before the Courts are seriously \r\n  endangered and the administration of justice is handicapped.\"). \r\n\r\nV. Alternative Relief\r\n\r\nLastly, we are not unmindful of the fact that our holding \r\n  above may limit the prosecution of actions for slander of title in South Carolina. \r\n  However, it does not extinguish every form of relief when a party files a lis \r\n  pendens which is motivated by some malicious intent. The jurisdictions are in \r\n  agreement that the proper action against a maliciously filed lis pendens is \r\n  under abuse of process or malicious prosecution.  See Sanders v. Rollinson, \r\n  33 S.C. Law (2 Strob.) 447 (1848) (stating an action for slander based on a \r\n  defamatory affidavit was a non-suit; the proper attack is under malicious prosecution); \r\n  Superior Constr. Inc. v. Linnerooth, 712 P.2d 1378, 1382 (N.M. 1986) \r\n  (\"[A]lthough slander of title may not provide a remedy to persons in the Linnerooths' \r\n  position who have been wronged by a filing of a notice of lis pendens, such \r\n  wrongful filing may support an action for abuse of process.\"); Wendy's of \r\n  South Jersey, Inc. v. Blanchard Mgmt. Corp. of New Jersey, 406 A.2d 1337, \r\n  1340 (N.J. Super. Ct. Ch. Div. 1979) (\"[T]here is authority to indicate that \r\n  while one may not be able to recover damages for the filing of a notice of Lis \r\n  pendens in a slander of title action, he may be able to recover the same in \r\n  an action for malicious prosecution if the elements of that tort are \r\n  satisfied.\"); Albertson v. Raboff, 295 P.2d 405 (Cal. 1956) (reversing \r\n  the decision below for further proceedings regarding an action for malicious \r\n  prosecution; \"a defendant cannot escape liability for a malicious prosecution \r\n  of an unjustified charge by joining with it a justified charge.\"); Brough \r\n  v. Foley, 572 A.2d 63 (R.I. 1990) (although filing of lis pendens is not \r\n  actionable under slander of title, the case is remanded for further proceedings \r\n  regarding the parties alternative counterclaim for abuse-of-process.); Houska \r\n  v. Frederick, 447 S.W.2d 514 (Mo. 1969) (although no action for slander \r\n  of title follows the filing of a lis pendens, the same elements, if presented \r\n  to the court below and preserved, may prove a cause of action for malicious \r\n  prosecution); Palmer v. Shelby Plaza Motel, Inc., 443 So.2d 285 (Fla. \r\n  Dist. Ct. App. 1983) (although appellees were not entitled to damages for slander \r\n  of title after successfully defending a mortgage foreclosure action, nothing \r\n  precludes the appellees from filing a suit for malicious prosecution);  but \r\n  see Asarki v. R &amp; R Land Co., 225 Cal.Rptr. 285, 291 n.3 (noting that, \r\n  although the recording of a lis pendens, which is privileged, cannot be the \r\n  basis of an action for slander of title, but may, in some cases be the subject \r\n  of an action for malicious prosecution, \"no reported decision â€¦ has upheld an \r\n  award of damages for malicious prosecution for recording a notice of lis pendens.\"). \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the filing of a lis pendens is ABSOLUTELY \r\n  privileged in South Carolina. The filing of a lis pendens enjoys the absolute \r\n  privilege accorded to judicial proceedings. Because the recording of a lis pendens \r\n  is specifically authorized by statute and has no existence separate and apart \r\n  from the litigation of which it gives notice, the filing of a lis pendens CANNOT \r\n  form the basis of an action for slander of title. \r\n\r\nTo hold otherwise would clearly endanger an untold number of\r\ntransactions in this state that require the filing of a lis pendens for its\r\nintended purpose of providing notice to the world of a potential conflict\r\ninvolving the subject property.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial judge should have granted Poole's\r\nmotion for directed verdict as to the cause of action for slander of title.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n1.

This automatic stay continues in effect for the duration \r\n    of the appeal unless lifted by order of the trial judge, appellate court, \r\n    or judge or justice thereof.

Crumly, both of Charleston, \r\n  for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.: Darlene Shaw was injured \r\n  when she tripped on the sidewalk in front of Marianna Hanckel's house on Tradd \r\n  Street in Charleston. Shaw sued Hanckel and the City of Charleston alleging \r\n  they were both negligent and jointly and severally liable for her injuries. \r\n  The trial court granted Hanckel's motion for summary judgment over City's objection. \r\n  We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShaw alleges she tripped and injured herself when she accidentally \r\n  inserted her foot into a hole where the sidewalk abuts an old coal grate appurtenant \r\n  to Hanckel's house. The grate is a textured piece of sheet metal covering an \r\n  opening in the sidewalk which historically was a chute for coal to be delivered \r\n  into the basement of the house. The opening is reinforced with brick, and the \r\n  sidewalk is concrete.\r\n\r\nIn support of her motion for summary judgment, Hanckel argued \r\n  the evidence showed only that the sidewalk, not the coal grate, caused Shaw's \r\n  fall. She noted as a matter of law that City is responsible for maintaining \r\n  the public sidewalk, and in fact, \"[t]he City of Charleston has admitted this \r\n  responsibility. . . .\" In opposition, City asserted it does not own the steel \r\n  grate or the brick shaft and is not the responsible party. City summarizes its \r\n  position:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hanckel has moved for summary judgment on the ground that \r\n    \"it is the duty of the City of Charleston, not hers, to maintain city sidewalks. \r\n    . . (quoting from page one of the text of Hanckel's motion).\" There is no \r\n    dispute regarding this assertion. However, Hanckel's reliance on this assertion \r\n    as the basis for her motion for summary judgment is wholly misplaced. The \r\n    issue here is not whether each defendant has a duty to maintain its own property. \r\n    Rather, the central issue regarding Hanckel's motion is a question of location. \r\n    Specifically: was the defect involved in the plaintiff's fall located on property \r\n    owned and maintained by Hanckel or, rather, by the City? We submit that a \r\n    genuine issue of fact exists regarding whether the defect is located on Hanckel's \r\n    property or on the City's.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court granted Hanckel summary judgment and clearly \r\n  found that the hole in which Shaw tripped was part of the sidewalk. It found: \r\n  \"No evidence was presented that the hole in the sidewalk was caused by the grate. \r\n  . . . In dispute here was whether homeowner Hanckel also owed a duty to inspect \r\n  and maintain the sidewalk.\" In its conclusions of law, the trial court continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n  There is no evidence in the record which would create \r\n    a material question of fact that Hanckel owed a duty to inspect and maintain \r\n    public sidewalks outside her house. The evidence in the record, taken in the \r\n    light most favorable to the Plaintiff, establishes that even if Hanckel had \r\n    some ownership rights in the air shaft cover and its surrounding stone, such \r\n     structures were squarely upon the public sidewalk and subject to the City \r\n    of Charleston's control. (Emphasis added.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ISSUES \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally, the City's argument was limited to whether the \r\n  trial judge erred in her finding that \"the defect that caused this accident \r\n  was a part of the sidewalk and not a part of the shaft owned by. . . Hanckel\" \r\n  where an issue of material fact exists regarding whether the defect was located \r\n  on Hanckel's property or the sidewalk maintained by the City. Thereafter, this \r\n  court directed the parties to brief \"the issue of whether a co-defendant in \r\n  an action based on negligence is an 'aggrieved party' within the contemplation \r\n  of Rule 201(b), SCACR, thereby vesting it with the right to appeal a grant of \r\n  summary judgment to its co-defendant when the plaintiff in the action, against \r\n  whom the summary judgment is awarded, does not file an appeal.\" Understandably, \r\n  City argues it is an aggrieved party and Hanckel argues it is not. Therefore, \r\n  the two issues before us are: \r\n\r\n\r\n  1. Is City an \"aggrieved party\" with standing to challenge \r\n    the grant of summary judgment to its co-defendant? \r\n\r\n  2. If so, was summary judgment properly granted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. Standing to Appeal \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCity argues it is an \"aggrieved party\" within the contemplation \r\n  of the rule, and may therefore appeal the grant of summary judgment to its co-defendant. \r\n  We agree.\r\n\r\nRule 201(b), SCACR, provides that \"[o]nly a party aggrieved \r\n  by an order, judgment, or sentence may appeal.\" We recently reiterated that \r\n  \"[a] party is aggrieved by a judgment or decree when it operates on his or her \r\n  rights of property or bears directly on his or her interest.\" Beaufort Realty \r\n  Co. v. Beaufort County, 346 S.C. 298, 301, 551 S.E.2d 588, 589 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001). \"The word 'aggrieved' refers to a substantial grievance, a denial of \r\n  some personal or property right, or the imposition on a party of a burden or \r\n  obligation.\" Id.; see Parker v. Brown, 195 S.C. 35, 44-45, \r\n  10 S.E.2d 625, 629 (1940) (\"An aggrieved party or person is one who is injured \r\n  in a legal sense; one who has suffered an injury to person or property.\"). \"A \r\n  party cannot appeal from a decision which does not affect his or her interest, \r\n  however erroneous and prejudicial it may be to some other person's rights and \r\n  interests.\" Beaufort Realty, 346 S.C. at 301, 551 S.E.2d at 589-590; \r\n  First Union Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 565, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  372, 378 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n\r\nUnder the peculiar facts of this case, we find City is an \r\n  aggrieved party with standing to challenge its co-defendant's dismissal from \r\n  the underlying cause of action. Shaw filed her complaint against City and Hanckel \r\n  alleging negligence and joint and several liability between these co-defendants. \r\n  \"The Tort Claims Act governs all tort claims against governmental entities and \r\n  is the exclusive civil remedy available in an action against the government.\" \r\n  Washington v. Lexington County Jail, 337 S.C. 400, 404, 523 S.E.2d 204, \r\n  206 (Ct. App. 1999). City, being a \"governmental entity\" as defined in section \r\n  15-78-30(d), is liable for its torts \"in the same manner and to the same extent \r\n  as a private individual under like circumstances, subject to the limitations \r\n  . . . contained herein.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. 2001). However, City's \r\n  liability in damages to Shaw are capped for each occurrence and claim. S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-120 (Supp. 2001). Moreover,\r\n\r\n\r\n  [i]n all actions brought pursuant to [the Tort Claims \r\n    Act] when an alleged joint tortfeasor is named as [a] party defendant in addition \r\n    to the governmental entity, the trier of fact must return a special verdict \r\n    specifying the proportion of monetary liability of each defendant against \r\n    whom liability is determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-100(c) (Supp. 2001) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n\r\nHanckel argues City can never be an aggrieved party under \r\n  the present facts because the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (UCATA) \r\n  states it \"shall not apply to governmental entities.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-65 \r\n  (Supp. 2001). She argues this section essentially places City in the position \r\n  of a joint tortfeasor under the common law. The intention behind UCATA is to \r\n  provide some relief to \"a tortfeasor who has paid more than his pro rata \r\n  share of the common liability.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-20(B) (Supp. 2001) \r\n  (emphasis added). Because the Tort Claims Act applies and clearly provides that \r\n  liability among or between tortfeasors shall be apportioned by the jury, this \r\n  argument lacks merit.\r\n\r\nClearly the inclusion or exclusion of Hanckel, who may be \r\n  deemed partially liable to Shaw, drastically affects City's potential exposure \r\n  in this tort action. If Hanckel remains a party, the verdict may apportion the \r\n  damages between Hanckel and City. Without Hanckel, however, City could only \r\n  be apportioned 100% of any potential liability. Such a result under the Tort \r\n  Claims Act clearly bears directly on its pecuniary interests. \r\n\r\nOur sister state, Georgia, has drawn a similar distinction \r\n  regarding appealability and standing turning on whether the co-defendant's rights \r\n  are affected. In the case of Hussey, Gay &amp; Bell v. Ga. Ports Auth., \r\n  the Georgia Court of Appeals held:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (A) co-defendant does not have any standing to appeal an \r\n    order granting summary judgment in favor of another defendant when (his) right \r\n    has not been adversely affected thereby. Only if the co-defendants are sued \r\n    as joint tort-feasors does the grant of summary judgment as to one potentially \r\n    affect the other's right of contribution. Therefore, it is only in this situation \r\n    that the co-defendant is deemed a losing party and therefore has standing \r\n    to appeal the grant of summary judgment to another co-defendant.\r\n\r\n\r\nHussey, 420 S.E.2d 50, 53 (Ga. Ct. App. 1992) (quotations \r\n  and citations omitted). See generally 5 Am. Jur. 2d Appellate Review \r\n  Â§ 275 (1995 &amp; Supp. 2002). In the seminal case, Georgia held a co-defendant \r\n  had standing to appeal the grant of summary judgment to another co-defendant \r\n  against whom a contribution claim was asserted. R.E. Thomas Erectors, Inc. \r\n  v. Brunswick Pulp&nbsp;&amp; Paper Co., 321 S.E.2d 412 (Ga. Ct. App. 1984). \r\n  Later, the court clarified that relaxation of standing requirements for co-defendants \r\n  was limited to those sued as joint tortfeasors. C.W. Matthews Contracting \r\n  Co. v. Studard, 412 S.E.2d 539, 540 (Ga. Ct. App. 1991); see also \r\n  Johnson &amp; Harber Constr. Co., 469 S.E.2d 697, 699 (Ga. Ct. App. 1996); \r\n  Shackelford v. Green, 349 S.E.2d 781 (Ga. Ct. App. 1986). Under similar \r\n  circumstances, the Illinois Court of Appeals held that a co-defendant had standing \r\n  to appeal the grant of summary judgment to another who would otherwise share \r\n  liability where their interests were adverse because dismissal was premised \r\n  on determination of contractual assumption of co-defendant's liability to plaintiff, \r\n  though no cross-claim for contribution had been filed. Hammond v. N. Am. \r\n  Asbestos Corp., 565 N.E.2d 1343 (Ill. Ct. App. 1991).\r\n\r\nWe agree that the circumstances where a co-defendant will \r\n  be an aggrieved party permitted to appeal a grant of summary judgment to another \r\n  defendant are very narrowly circumscribed. This holding should not be read to \r\n  confer such a right in all cases. Much will depend on the scope of summary judgment \r\n  and the practical and preclusive effects on the relative rights of the parties \r\n  which, of necessity, must be a fact-specific determination. As the Florida court \r\n  has explained:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Inherent in the right to oppose a grant of summary judgment \r\n    to a co-defendant is the right of the non-moving co-defendant to demonstrate \r\n    the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with regard to the plaintiff's \r\n    claims against the moving co-defendant.\r\n\r\n\r\nU-Haul Co. of E. Bay v. Meyer, 586 So.2d 1327, 1331 \r\n  (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1991), cited with approval in Benton Inv. Co. v. Wal-Mart \r\n  Stores, Inc., 704 So.2d 130, 132 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997).\r\n\r\nHowever, where the grant of summary judgment is not determinative \r\n  of the co-defendant's rights or does not impact potential liability, a co-defendant \r\n  has been held not to have standing to appeal. See, e.g. Aguirre v. \r\n  Phillips Properties, Inc., 2001 WL 961337, ___ S.W.3d ___ (Tex. Ct. App. \r\n  2001) (Because co-defendant could not show prejudice by grant of summary judgment \r\n  and had not filed cross-claim, it had no standing since relative liability was \r\n  not affected.); Tinker v. Kent Gypsum Supply, Inc., 977 P.2d 627 (Wash. \r\n  Ct. App. 1999) (where no cross-claim was filed, co-defendant could not appeal \r\n  grant of summary judgment); Clay v. Pepper Constr. Co., 563 N.E.2d 937 \r\n  (Ill. Ct. App. 1990) (co-defendants who did not cross-claim for contribution \r\n  lacked standing to appeal summary judgment).\r\n\r\nThus, in this case, City is an aggrieved party within the \r\n  contemplation of the rule and may appeal the grant of summary judgment to its \r\n  co-defendant.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Summary Judgment  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCity argues genuine issues of material fact preclude granting \r\n  summary judgment in favor of its co-defendant, Hanckel. We agree.\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is a drastic remedy that should be cautiously \r\n  invoked so no person will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed \r\n  factual issues. Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 112, \r\n  410 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1991). \"Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear \r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.\" Toomer v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 344 S.C. \r\n  486, 489, 544 S.E.2d 634, 635 (Ct. App. 2001); Rule 56(c), SCRCP. \"It is not \r\n  appropriate[, however,] where further inquiry into the facts of the case is \r\n  desirable to clarify the application of the law.\" Carolina Alliance for Fair \r\n  Employment v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, \r\n  484, 523 S.E.2d 795, 799 (Ct. App. 1999). \"In determining whether any triable \r\n  issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably \r\n  drawn [therefrom] must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving \r\n  party.\" Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, \r\n  61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998);  Vermeer Carolina's, Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper \r\n  Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d 301, 304 (Ct. App. 1999). \"If triable \r\n  issues exist, those issues must go to the jury.\" Rothrock v. Copeland, \r\n  305 S.C. 402, 405, 409 S.E.2d 366, 367 (1991); Young v. S.C. Dep't of Corrections, \r\n  333 S.C. 714, 718, 511 S.E.2d 413, 415 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\nTo establish a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff \r\n  must prove the following three elements: (1) a duty owed by defendant to plaintiff; \r\n  (2) breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damages proximately \r\n  resulting from the breach. Hubbard v. Taylor, 339 S.C. 582, 588, 529 \r\n  S.E.2d 549, 552 (Ct. App. 2000). \"An essential element in a cause of action \r\n  for negligence is the existence of a legal duty of care owed by the defendant \r\n  to the plaintiff.\" Bishop v. S.C. Dep't of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, \r\n  86, 502 S.E.2d 78, 81 (1998). The trial court found \"no evidence in the record \r\n  which would create a material question of fact that Hanckel owed a duty to inspect \r\n  and maintain public sidewalks outside her house.\" (Emphasis added.) We \r\n  agree with this statement. We find nothing in the record to support a finding \r\n  that Hanckel has accepted the duty to maintain the public sidewalks. See \r\n  Miller v. City of Camden, 329 S.C. 310, 314, 494 S.E.2d 813, 815 (1997) \r\n  (Generally, \"[o]ne who controls the use of property has a duty of care not to \r\n  harm others by its use.\"). However, this finding does not resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nThe record reflects that Shaw's fall was caused by a hole \r\n  located somewhere adjacent to the coal grate next to Hanckel's house. Shaw avers \r\n  that she tripped when her \"foot became trapped in a hole between the concrete \r\n  of the sidewalk and a metal grate/cover which extended from Defendant Hanckel's \r\n  property into and upon the sidewalk. The hole in which Plaintiff's foot became \r\n  caught was located on the sidewalk owned and maintained by the Defendants.\" \r\n  (Emphasis added.) This hole was located \"adjacent to and extended beneath \r\n  an old coal grate/cover which extended out into the sidewalk, beside 6 Tradd \r\n  Street.\" (Emphasis added.) Shaw described the hole as approximately four to \r\n  six inches deep and six to seven inches wide and partially covered by the grate \r\n  itself. She restated that her \"fall was caused by a hole which was on property \r\n  owned by, or appurtenant property owned by Marianna Hanckel. . . .\" Shaw testified \r\n  that she was unsure who actually owns the coal grate.\r\n\r\nCity's Superintendent of Streets and Sidewalks opined that \r\n  the boundary between the private property owned by Hanckel and the sidewalk \r\n  maintained by City would be the brick area. \"Based on my experience, the boundary \r\n  line, if I had gained access to that area, would be on this outside brick wall. \r\n  Because one would have to build that brick wall to put whatever had existed \r\n  at that point in time, and not at the opening.\" He later reiterated: \"the edge \r\n  of the metal would not be the boundary line, it would be at the end of the bricks, \r\n  because they would build some form, some uniform form to support what that access \r\n  roofing might have been.\" Similarly, the City Engineer and Director of the Department \r\n  of Public Service stated the hole that caused Shaw's fall was located entirely \r\n  within the area owned and controlled by the adjacent homeowner, Hanckel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he area which encompasses this air shaft includes the \r\n  block apron or foundation which extend beyond the metal grate/cover of the shaft. \r\n  . . . The metal grate covers only a portion of the entire area of the air shaft \r\n  attached to the house; the grate does not cover the entire area of the air shaft. \r\n  That is, the outer edges of this shaft on the eastern and western sides of the \r\n  metal cover, which are made of block or stone material, are part of the shaft \r\n  itself and are not part of the City's sidewalk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCity has not filed a cross-claim against Hanckel. City answered \r\n  Hanckel's interrogatory that it believed she, not City, was responsible for \r\n  maintaining the grate. However, City admitted responsibility for maintaining \r\n  the sidewalk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City is generally responsible for the maintenance, repairs \r\n  and upkeep of its sidewalks, but landowners owning property or residences appurtenant \r\n  to the sidewalks are responsible for their grates, or air shafts, which encroach \r\n  upon the sidewalks and are also responsible for the physical parts of same and \r\n  any and all damages the structures cause to the sidewalks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent corroborated the general duty City has \r\n  accepted regarding sidewalks in its corporate limits. \"[I]f one [of the grates] \r\n  is broken and open, I'll put a barricade over it. . . .\" Assuming the pictures \r\n  accurately depicted the condition of the area, he stated he would have placed \r\n  a barricade over it. Nevertheless, City argues an issue of fact over the actual \r\n  ownership of this hole is still in dispute. We agree. \r\n\r\nA dispute over ownership is ordinarily a mixed question \r\n  of law and fact. Cannon v. Motors Ins. Corp., 224 S.C. 368, 372, 79 S.E.2d \r\n  369, 371 (1953). We find the trial court erred in finding as a matter of law, \r\n  \"that even if Hanckel had some ownership rights in the air shaft cover and its \r\n  surrounding stone, such structures were squarely upon the public sidewalk and \r\n  subject to the City of Charleston's control.\" Ordinarily, the law imposes no \r\n  duty on City to maintain private property. We disagree with the trial court's \r\n  conclusion that the grate being located on the sidewalk renders it subject to \r\n  City's control and legal duty to maintain the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nWhether City accepted the duty to maintain the offending \r\n  area merely goes to the issue of apportionment of fault. As such, it is an issue \r\n  for the jury. See Bryant v. City of N. Charleston, 304 S.C. 123, \r\n  127, 403 S.E.2d 159, 161 (Ct. App. 1991) (The fact that the Department of Highways \r\n  and Public Transportation owns and maintains the subject sidewalk in the city \r\n  of North Charleston does not prevent the City from undertaking its maintenance.). \r\n  City's admitted duty to maintain public sidewalks is not dispositive of the \r\n  location of the dangerous portion where the incident occurred, nor is it dispositive \r\n  of ownership. The jury might find Hanckel has a similar duty of care if it found \r\n  that she owned the portion with the hole. See Miller, 329 S.C. \r\n  at 314, 494 S.E.2d at 815-16; Epps v. United States, 862 F.Supp. 1460, \r\n  1464 (D.S.C. 1994) (Legal duty of municipality to maintain sidewalk does not \r\n  absolve landowner with abutting property from similar duty to traveling public. \r\n  \"The general rule appears to be that an abutting landowner or occupier normally \r\n  does not have a duty of care with respect to the safety of the sidewalk unless \r\n  such a duty is imposed by legislation, the abutter created an unsafe condition \r\n  on the sidewalk, or the abutter has a special property interest in the sidewalk.\") \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court's dismissal of Hanckel at the summary judgment \r\n  stage prejudices City. Genuine issues of fact exist regarding whether City or \r\n  Hanckel owns the coal grate and its adjoining foundation and where precisely \r\n  the hole is located that caused Shaw to trip. The record at this stage of the \r\n  proceeding does not resolve precisely how the accident occurred. The hole itself \r\n  clearly contributed, but it is unclear whether the grate likewise contributed \r\n  to Shaw's fall. Whether either or both of the co-defendants has accepted the \r\n  duty to maintain this portion of the sidewalk is not before this court. Rather, \r\n  this appeal is concerned only with whether a genuine issue of fact exists regarding \r\n  the ownership of the subject portion of the sidewalk and the duty of care appurtenant \r\n  thereto. Without factual proof that Hanckel does not own the hole and did not \r\n  undertake a duty to maintain it, the trial court's order dismissing Hanckel \r\n  as a co-defendant was premature.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n\r\nCURETON and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3523","title":"State v.

Arnold raises several \r\n  issues on appeal, including the assertion that the circuit court erred in denying \r\n  his motion for a directed verdict. We agree that the evidence is insufficient \r\n  to support the conviction and, therefore, we reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 18, 1997, Dr. Jennings Cox \r\n  (\"the victim\") left his office for a dental appointment. Because the victim's \r\n  car was being repaired, he borrowed a co-worker's car. The victim did not return \r\n  from his dental appointment or answer his pager that afternoon, and his wife \r\n  subsequently filed a missing person's report with the Savannah, Georgia, Police \r\n  Department. Three days later, his body was located on the side of an access \r\n  road in a wooded area in Colleton County, South Carolina. \r\n\r\nTwo days after the victim disappeared, the borrowed \r\n  car was located in a parking lot in Johnson City, Tennessee. In a search of \r\n  the vehicle, Tennessee police discovered a plastic tab from a coffee cup lid \r\n  in the center console. In the meantime, Colleton County detectives learned that \r\n  the victim had recently been involved in a sexual relationship with Arnold. \r\n  Arnold's fingerprints were compared with the fingerprint on the coffee cup lid, \r\n  and they matched. Arnold was then charged with murdering the victim. Arnold \r\n  was later tried and convicted of murder. He appeals from the jury verdict.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nArnold argues the trial judge erred in failing \r\n  to grant a directed verdict. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe State's case is entirely circumstantial. When \r\n  the State relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence and a motion for directed \r\n  verdict is made, the circuit court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence \r\n  of evidence, not with its weight. State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 409, \r\n  535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000). The circuit court should not refuse to grant the \r\n  directed verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the \r\n  accused is guilty. Mitchell, 341 S.C. at 409, 535 S.E.2d at 127. \"The \r\n  trial judge is required to submit the case to the jury if there is 'any substantial \r\n  evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which \r\n  his guilt may fairly and logically be deduced.'\" Id.  (quoting State \r\n  v. Edwards, 298 S.C. 272, 275, 379 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1989)). In reviewing \r\n  a denial of a directed verdict motion, this Court must view the evidence in \r\n  a light most favorable to the State. State v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 477, \r\n  385 S.E.2d 839, 843 (1989).\r\n\r\nConsidering the evidence in a light most favorable \r\n  to the State, the following facts were established. Bobby Ray Ware, a long-distance \r\n  truck driver, had an ongoing, sexual relationship with the victim. Ware also \r\n  knew Arnold, and on June 13, 1997, Arnold asked Ware to drive him from Jacksonville, \r\n  Florida, to Savannah, Georgia. Upon arriving in Savannah, Arnold stayed at Ware's \r\n  apartment where he later met the victim. During this encounter, Arnold and the \r\n  victim engaged in sexual acts. According to Ware, Arnold also displayed a handgun \r\n  during his stay at Ware's apartment. \r\n\r\nOn the morning of June 18, the victim's wife drove \r\n  him to his office where he borrowed a co-worker's new automobile. The victim \r\n  left his office between 10:30 and 11:00 a.m. for a dental appointment. At 1:20 \r\n  p.m., the victim called his secretary, and as a result of this call, she cancelled \r\n  his afternoon appointments. During the afternoon, both the victim's wife and \r\n  his secretary unsuccessfully tried to contact him by calling his pager. On the \r\n  evening of June 18, the victim's wife filed a missing persons report with the \r\n  police.\r\n\r\nOn June 21, the victim's body was discovered in \r\n  a wooded area approximately one-quarter mile down a dirt road in Colleton County, \r\n  South Carolina. The victim had been shot, once in the heart and once in the \r\n  head. No tissue, blood, shell casings, bullets, fragments or other evidence \r\n  was found at the scene. No blood spatters were found on any plants or groundcovering, \r\n  and there was no evidence of a struggle. In short, no evidence indicated whether \r\n  the victim had been murdered in the woods where he was found or at a different \r\n  location. An autopsy performed on June 22, 1997, indicated that the time of \r\n  death was approximately three and one-half days before the examination. \r\n\r\nThe borrowed automobile was found in Johnson City, \r\n  Tennessee, on June 20. (1) The only fingerprint \r\n  capable of analysis inside the car was on the tab of a plastic coffee cup lid \r\n  and was later identified as belonging to Arnold. (2) \r\n  No evidence of the homicide, such as blood or bullet holes, was discovered in \r\n  the vehicle.\r\n\r\nOn June 17, the day before the homicide, Ware left \r\n  Savannah to pick up a shipment, heading for Chicago, Illinois. He was supposed \r\n  to deliver the shipment the following afternoon. However, according to Ware, \r\n  when he arrived in Chicago, the dispatcher made him wait until the morning of \r\n  June 19 to unload. Ware testified that while he was in Chicago he received a \r\n  message from his dispatcher to call a number in Tennessee. Ware stated he called \r\n  the number and spoke with Arnold by telephone on June 19. During this call, \r\n  Arnold stated he was back in Tennessee.  \r\n  (3)\r\n\r\nOther than the bullet wounds, there is no evidence \r\n  of the circumstances under which the victim met his death. The State did not \r\n  establish the scene of the murder, although in a light most favorable to the \r\n  State, the lack of blood or other evidence in the woods did not exclude the \r\n  possibility that Cox was shot where he was found. Arnold's gun was not connected \r\n  to the crime, and no evidence placed Arnold at any crime scene, in the woods \r\n  or otherwise. Nor is there any evidence of the circumstances by which Arnold \r\n  obtained possession of the borrowed vehicle, if at all, \r\n  (4) or that the vehicle was involved in the murder. At most, the State's \r\n  testimony established that the borrowed car was capable of traversing the dirt \r\n  road leading to the victim's body.  \r\n  (5)\r\n\r\nThe above evidence supports the conclusion that \r\n  Arnold knew the victim, had access to him, and was in the area on the day of \r\n  the homicide. The State's evidence also reasonably tends to prove that Arnold \r\n  did have some contact with the victim on June 18, in view of the fact that his \r\n  fingerprint was found in the borrowed car. (6) \r\n  Furthermore, the evidence provides a reasonable basis for concluding that Arnold \r\n  drove the car to Tennessee. Indeed, in a light most favorable to the State, \r\n  Arnold had a gun which could possibly have been used to kill the victim. However, \r\n  even viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, the State \r\n  has failed to meet the \"any substantial evidence\" standard. \r\n\r\nIn State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d 450 \r\n  (1984), the defendant was convicted of two murders. At trial, the State attempted \r\n  to link Schrock to the murders by presenting evidence Schrock was in the area \r\n  of the murders and that a footprint at the scene was similar to footprints found \r\n  in an area in which the defendant admitted he had been walking. However, our \r\n  supreme court reversed the convictions, ruling Schrock was entitled to a directed \r\n  verdict because the evidence was exclusively circumstantial and nothing placed \r\n  Schrock at the scene of the crime. The court concluded the circumstances were \r\n  suspicious, but were insufficient to establish a basis for the conviction.\r\n\r\nIn the more recent case of State v. Martin, \r\n  340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000), our supreme court again reversed a murder \r\n  conviction when the State's case was purely circumstantial and the evidence \r\n  was insufficient to establish the defendant's presence at the scene of the crime \r\n  at the time of the murder. Although the State presented evidence that a car \r\n  resembling the one in the possession of the defendant was at the victim's apartment \r\n  complex the night of the murder, there was no evidence that this car was actually \r\n  the car in the defendant's possession. In reversing the conviction, our supreme \r\n  court stated, \"[l]ike the footprints in Schrock, the possibility that \r\n  it was the same car, without any other evidence placing the defendants at the \r\n  scene, is not enough evidence to place [the defendant] inside the Victim's apartment.\" \r\n  Id.  at 603, 533 S.E.2d at 575.\r\n\r\nExcept in cases where the crime is alleged to be \r\n  procured or caused indirectly, our supreme court has clearly stated that \"[b]y \r\n  bringing the case, the State assumes the burden of proving that the accused \r\n  was at the scene of the crime when it happened and that he committed the criminal \r\n  act.\" Schrock, 283 S.C. at 133, 322 S.E.2d at 452. The evidence in this \r\n  case, as in Shrock and Martin, established only that the circumstances \r\n  were strongly suspicious, but falls short of providing a basis upon which the \r\n  jury could have reasonably and logically determined Arnold's guilt. \r\n  (7)\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find that the evidence presented by the State \r\n  does not rise to the level of substantial evidence which reasonably tended to \r\n  prove Arnold's guilt or from which his guilt may fairly and logically be deduced. \r\n  Therefore, Arnold's murder conviction is \r\n\r\nREVERSED.  \r\n  (8)\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (dissenting): I respectfully \r\n  dissent and would hold the evidence, albeit entirely circumstantial, is sufficient \r\n  to withstand a motion for directed verdict. (9)\r\n\r\nThe defendant and the victim had engaged in sexual \r\n  relations. The victim, a child psychologist, lived and worked in Savannah, Georgia. \r\n  On June 18, 1997, he borrowed an almost new BMW Z-3 from another doctor \r\n  to keep a dental appointment; however, he never arrived at the dentist's office. \r\n  The last time his office heard from him was at 1:20 that afternoon. Two days \r\n  later, on June 20, 1997, the BMW was found abandoned in a parking lot in Johnson \r\n  City, Tennessee. The next day, June 21, 1997, the victim's body was discovered \r\n  by the side of a dirt road in a wooded area near State Highway 61 and Interstate \r\n  95 in Colleton County, South Carolina. He had been shot twice, having apparently \r\n  died sometime on June 18, 1997. His wallet was missing. Just a few hours before, \r\n  the victim had withdrawn $300.00 from an ATM.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, an examination of the BMW uncovered \r\n  a coffee cup lid that bore the defendant's fingerprints. There was neither any \r\n  evidence that the defendant ever had access to the automobile before the victim \r\n  borrowed it nor any explanation regarding how an article with the defendant's \r\n  fingerprint on it wound up inside the car. Further examination of the BMW revealed \r\n  scratches on its exterior that suggested, according to the lead investigator, \r\n  it had been driven down \"something rough.\"\r\n\r\nInvestigators also learned that the defendant's \r\n  father lived in Gray, Tennessee, not far from Johnson City where the BMW was \r\n  found. On June 19, 1997, Bobby Ray Ware spoke to the defendant from Chicago \r\n  and learned the defendant \"was back in Tennessee.\" Ware, a long-distance truck \r\n  driver, had days before the victim's murder introduced the victim to the defendant. \r\n  Ware knew the defendant to carry a gun and had last seen him in Savannah on \r\n  June 17, 1997.\r\n\r\nFrom this evidence, the jury could have found, \r\n  as it obviously did, that the victim and the defendant had a sexual relationship, \r\n  that they met in Savannah sometime after 1:20 p.m. on June 18, 1997, that they \r\n  drove to Colleton County, where the defendant killed the victim, stole his wallet, \r\n  the money, and the BMW, and that the defendant then drove the BMW to Tennessee, \r\n  where he abandoned the vehicle, went to his father's house, and spoke by telephone \r\n  to Ware the following day. Because no other plausible explanation was offered \r\n  for how the car could have ended up some distance from where the victim's body \r\n  was found, the jury could have reasonably concluded that the defendant had absconded \r\n  with the car, which in turn would have led to the inference that he killed the \r\n  victim in order to take possession of it.  \r\n  (10)\r\n\r\nI view it as more than a mere coincidence that \r\n  the defendant's fingerprints were found on a coffee cup lid inside an automobile \r\n  that the victim had borrowed on the day he was murdered and that the automobile \r\n  was found abandoned not far from where the defendant's father lived. Indeed, \r\n  the defendant concedes in his brief that these facts could lead to the reasonable \r\n  inference that he had \"had contact with\" the BMW at some point prior to its \r\n  discovery.\r\n\r\nThe majority relies on State v. Schrock \r\n  (11) and State v. Martin (12) \r\n  to support its decision to reverse the defendant's conviction.\r\n\r\nBut this is not a case, as was Schrock, \r\n  where the only evidence linking the defendant to the crime was footprints at \r\n  the scene of a murder that were similar to known footprints of the \r\n  defendant. There, the experts could not definitely testify that the footprints \r\n  at the scene were made by the defendant's shoes.\r\n\r\nNeither is this a case, as was Martin, where \r\n  the defendant's car was not definitely identified as the car seen at the victim's \r\n  apartment complex the night she was murdered. There, the State could show only \r\n  that the latter car resembled the defendant's car.\r\n\r\nHere, there is no question but that the fingerprint \r\n  on the coffee cup lid belonged to the defendant. (13) \r\n  Moreover, in addition to the unexplained presence of the defendant's fingerprint \r\n  in the BMW, there was, as was mentioned above, evidence of a prior sexual relationship \r\n  between the defendant and the victim, evidence that the defendant possessed \r\n  a gun, and evidence from which the jury could infer that the defendant drove \r\n  from Georgia or South Carolina to Tennessee in an automobile that he had no \r\n  right to possess. \r\n\r\nI do not overlook the cases cited by the defendant, \r\n  State v. Mitchell, 341 S.C. 406, 535 S.E.2d 126 (2000), and State \r\n  v. Jones, 241 S.C. 271, 128 S.E.2d 114 (1962). They, too, may be distinguished \r\n  from the one here.\r\n\r\nIn Mitchell, the supreme court held the \r\n  State's proof that the defendant entered the house was insufficient where the \r\n  only evidence the State offered was a fingerprint of the defendant lifted from \r\n  a screen propped up against the house, a house that he had been in and around \r\n  on at least three occasions prior to the burglary. Here, there is no evidence \r\n  that the defendant was ever in or around the BMW before the victim disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn Jones, which the supreme court has cited \r\n  only once--and that in a concurring and dissenting opinion--the supreme court \r\n  held the State failed to prove that the defendants broke and entered an office \r\n  building where the State did not connect the defendants to the evidence found \r\n  at or near the scene, evidence that included a monogrammed towel from the hotel \r\n  where the defendants were staying. (14) Here, \r\n  fingerprint evidence together with the evidence that the defendant and the victim \r\n  intimately knew each other and that the BMW was found near the home of the defendant's \r\n  father before the discovery of the victim's body is sufficient in my mind to \r\n  connect the defendant to the murder.\r\n\r\nI would affirm the trial court's denial of the \r\n  defendant's motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.\r\n   \r\n\r\n1.  The dissent repeatedly contends \r\n  that Johnson City, Tennessee, is near the home of Arnold's father in Gray, Tennessee, \r\n  but there is no evidence in the record to support this contention.  \r\n2.  Latent fingerprints not \r\n  matching Arnold's were also recovered from the exterior of the vehicle. Although \r\n  they were forwarded for analysis, they were not compared to other known suspects. \r\n   \r\n3.  The State also introduced \r\n  evidence that additional phone calls were placed on the day the victim disappeared. \r\n  These calls were made from Arnold's father's phone in Tennessee to Ware's apartment. \r\n   \r\n4.  The dissent provides citations \r\n  standing for the proposition that possession, soon after a murder, of property \r\n  belonging to the victim may be the foundation of an inference of guilt. See \r\n  40A Am. Jur. 2d Homicide Â§ 252 (1999); 41 C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 245 \r\n  (1991). However, cases cited under these sections involved defendants with no \r\n  prior relationship to the victim or, at best, a casual relationship with the \r\n  victim. See Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S. 613 (1896) (noting \r\n  defendant, who was recently introduced to the deceased by a third party, was \r\n  in possession of the victim's belongings); Gibson v. State, 174 S.E. \r\n  354 (Ga. 1934) (indicating accused was in possession of the deceased's watch, \r\n  but not indicating any prior relationship between the accused and the deceased); \r\n  State v. Grissom, 298 P. 666 (N.M. 1930) (noting dentist, convicted of \r\n  second degree murder for producing an abortion after which the mother died, \r\n  had the deceased woman's recently missing ring); People v. Mitchell, \r\n  176 A.D.2d 897 (N.Y. App. Div. 1991) (noting defendant, who had assisted performing \r\n  renovation work for the deceased, was found in possession of the victim's credit \r\n  card); McKay v. State, 707 S.W.2d 23 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985) (affirming \r\n  capital murder conviction and noting at the time of arrest defendant was found \r\n  driving a car belonging to the victim's father when he had no previous relationship \r\n  with either person). Unlike those cases, Arnold and the victim had an intimate \r\n  relationship.  \r\n5.  The dissent notes an \"examination \r\n  of the [car] revealed scratches on its exterior that suggested, according to \r\n  the lead investigator, it had been driven down 'something rough.'\" However, \r\n  read as a whole, the investigator's testimony makes it clear that this conclusion \r\n  is purely speculative.  \r\n6.  The dissent points out the \r\n  proposition that fingerprint evidence may be sufficient to support a conviction \r\n  if the prints are \"found at the scene of the crime under such circumstances \r\n  that they could only have been made at the time of commission of the crime.\" \r\n  29A Am. Jur. 2d Evidence Â§ 1482 (1994). However, Arnold's prints were \r\n  not found at any place established as the scene of the crime. Arnold's fingerprint \r\n  was located only on a coffee cup lid in the car. The car was never connected \r\n  to the crime in any way.  \r\n7.  The dissent argues that \r\n  in Schrock and Martin the evidence was only similar or resembled \r\n  the defendants' shoes or car, whereas in this case there is no question but \r\n  that the fingerprint on the coffee cup lid belonged to Arnold. However, this \r\n  overlooks the fact that the evidence in Schrock and Martin was \r\n  discovered or viewed at the scene of the crime. Arnold's fingerprint \r\n  was not found at any place established as the scene of the crime, but was only \r\n  found on a coffee cup lid in a vehicle which had been in the possession of the \r\n  victim at some time before he was killed.  \r\n8.  In light of our decision \r\n  to reverse Arnold's murder conviction, we need not address the other issues \r\n  on appeal.  \r\n9.  Because the majority did \r\n  not address the other issues that the defendant raises on appeal, I will not \r\n  do so either.  \r\n10.  See 40A Am. Jur. \r\n  2d Homicide Â§ 252, at 91 (1999) (\"Possession, soon after a murder, of \r\n  articles apparently taken from the murder at the time of death, if not satisfactorily \r\n  accounted for, may be the foundation of . . . [an] inference of guilt.\"); 41 \r\n  C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 245, at 96 (1991) (\"It is competent to introduce in \r\n  evidence the fact that, after the killing, accused had possession of property \r\n  belonging to deceased . . . .\"); cf. 29A Am. Jur. 2d Evidence \r\n  Â§ 1482, at 864 (1994) (\"Evidence of fingerprint . . . identification may be \r\n  sufficient to support a conviction in a criminal prosecution [and] is sufficient \r\n  to establish identity if the prints are found at the scene of the crime under \r\n  such circumstances that they could only have been made at the time of commission \r\n  of the crime.\").  \r\n11.  283 S.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d \r\n  450 (1984).  \r\n12.  340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  572 (2000).  \r\n13.  The majority misapprehends \r\n  the point made in this dissent, i.e., that the failure in Schrock and \r\n  Martin was in connecting the evidence at the scene of the crime to the \r\n  particular defendant on trial. In the current appeal, that connection was made--no \r\n  one disputed the accuracy of the fingerprint evidence.  \r\n14.  This is the way the supreme \r\n  court characterized the evidence in Jones:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The presence of the hand towel of the St. John \r\n    Hotel at the scene of the crime is strongly relied upon by the State. The \r\n    defendants, with Joe Roughton, had registered at the St. John Hotel on the \r\n    day before the commission of the crime. An employee of the hotel testified \r\n    that it was customary to place in rooms, such as rented by the defendants, \r\n    two hand towels but could not testify as to whether two had been placed in \r\n    the room of the defendants. The officers testified that there was only one \r\n    hand towel in their room when they were arrested. There was testimony that \r\n    quite a number of hand towels are taken from the rooms of the hotel by guests \r\n    without the knowledge of the management. The record shows that the hand towel \r\n    came from the St. John Hotel, but fails to sufficiently connect its appearance \r\n    at the scene of the crime with these defendants to form the basis of a conviction. \r\n    The State did not show that the towel had ever been in the possession of the \r\n    defendants, but only that it was a towel belonging to the hotel where the \r\n    defendants were staying.\r\n\r\n  The tools found some distance from the Moody Oil \r\n    Company were not connected with the defendants, nor does the testimony show \r\n    their connection with the alleged crime. The tracks found in the vicinity \r\n    of the scene of the crime were not compared with those of the defendants and \r\n    the officers testified that they could not identify the tracks as having been \r\n    made by any particular person. The fact that the defendants were seen, approximately \r\n    six miles from the scene of the crime, walking along the railroad toward Charleston, \r\n    and the conflicting statements as to their whereabouts on the night of the \r\n    crime affords basis for disbelief of their statements as to where they were \r\n    at the time and their activities during the night, but does not prove their \r\n    presence at the scene in the absence of some substantial testimony connecting \r\n    them with the crime. Likewise, the presence of the automobile of Roughton \r\n    near the scene of the crime and the admissions by these defendants to the \r\n    officers that they were with Roughton earlier in the night afford[ ] no sufficient \r\n    basis for the presumption that they continued together until the crime was \r\n    committed, in the absence of other connecting circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nJones, 241 S.C. at 277-78, 128 S.E.2d at \r\n  117-18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3524","title":"Macauley v.

Isabel M. Dusenberry \r\n  executed a revocable trust (\"the First Trust\") and an irrevocable trust (\"the \r\n  Second Trust\"). The Second Trust was funded by a newly acquired life insurance \r\n  policy which had a single premium almost as great as the face amount of the \r\n  policy due to her age and health. Several beneficiaries of the First Trust (collectively \r\n  \"Respondents\") brought this action against Wachovia Bank, as Trustee, and the \r\n  other named defendants, as beneficiaries of the Second Trust, to set aside the \r\n  Second Trust and insurance policy. After a full hearing, the probate court concluded \r\n  Dusenberry was incompetent and subject to undue influence when she executed \r\n  the Second Trust and purchased the insurance policy. The court ordered the beneficiaries \r\n  of the Second Trust to return the proceeds of the Second Trust for distribution \r\n  to Dusenberry's heirs. Beneficiaries of the Second Trust (collectively, \"Appellants\") \r\n  appeal.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nDusenberry, one of ten children, was born in July \r\n  1899. She was an astute businesswoman, and though she could be generous with \r\n  others, she was known to be frugal with her own expenses. Dusenberry had no \r\n  children. \r\n\r\nIn October 1981, Dusenberry and her husband executed \r\n  wills and revocable trusts leaving the bulk of their estates to each other in \r\n  the event of death. Soon thereafter, Dusenberry's husband passed away and she \r\n  began receiving income from her husband's marital trust, for which she held \r\n  a power of appointment.\r\n\r\nIn 1987, Dusenberry became unhappy with the bank \r\n  then administering her trust and moved it and its assets to South Carolina National \r\n  Bank (\"SCN\"), which later merged into Wachovia. SCN did not want to hold a power \r\n  of attorney for Dusenberry as the prior bank had; therefore, Dusenberry executed \r\n  a durable power of attorney in December 1987 in favor of her sister Sara McLeod \r\n  and her nephew James MacLeod.  \r\n  (1)\r\n\r\nOn April 5, 1988, Dusenberry executed a will and the First Trust, a revocable trust agreement with SCN as the named trustee.  At\r\nthis time, Sara McLeod and Kathryn DePass were Dusenberry's only living siblings.  However, Dusenberry had over twenty\r\nnieces and nephews.  The First Trust had assets of nearly two million dollars, with an estimated annual income of $131,000. \r\nUnder the First Trust, 75% of the trust assets (Share A) was divided among numerous relatives and a few former employees.  The\r\nremaining 25% (Share B) was apportioned among a dozen charities.  Among the beneficiaries of Share A, Sara McLeod was to\r\nreceive 15%, Kathryn DePass 5%, James MacLeod 4%, and William McLeod 3%.\r\n\r\nIn the will, Dusenberry exercised her power of \r\n  appointment over the marital trust, giving 25% to Kathryn DePass and 75% to \r\n  Sara McLeod or her heirs. On August 2, 1988, Dusenberry executed a codicil to \r\n  her will which altered the power of appointment over the marital trust. The \r\n  codicil gave 75% of the income of the marital trust to Sara McLeod. Upon \r\n  Sara's death or upon Dusenberry's if Sara predeceased her, the income was to \r\n  go to James MacLeod. Upon the death of the survivor of Sara and James, the trust \r\n  was to be paid out 50% each to the heirs of James MacLeod and his brother William \r\n  McLeod.\r\n\r\nBy August 1988, Sara McLeod, the sister Dusenberry \r\n  had favored under her existing estate plan, was very ill with cancer. On August \r\n  18, 1988, Dusenberry filled out an application for a single premium whole life \r\n  insurance policy with a face value of $250,000. Grady Jenkins, the insurance \r\n  agent who assisted Dusenberry in obtaining the policy, testified that he had \r\n  discussed purchasing the insurance with Dusenberry several times before the \r\n  application was signed. According to Jenkins, Dusenberry was concerned that \r\n  her estate would be tied up for some time and was interested in insurance because \r\n  the proceeds would be distributed to the beneficiaries quickly, which would \r\n  ensure that Sara McLeod's needs were funded. By the time the insurance company \r\n  received all of Dusenberry's health information, several months had elapsed \r\n  since the original application had been signed. Dusenberry therefore signed \r\n  a second application at the request of the company on March 30, 1989. Because \r\n  of Dusenberry's health and age, the premium for the life insurance policy was \r\n  $238,750.\r\n\r\nOn April 29, 1989, Dusenberry executed the Second \r\n  Trust, funded by the life insurance policy. Other than an initial ten dollar \r\n  contribution, the insurance policy was the sole asset of the Second Trust. The \r\n  Second Trust provided for payment of the anticipated $250,000 in proceeds as \r\n  follows: (1) $150,000 to Sara McLeod, and if she did not survive Dusenberry, \r\n  then to her descendants; (2)&nbsp;$50,000 to James MacLeod; and (3)&nbsp;$50,000 \r\n  to Kathryn DePass. \r\n\r\nDusenberry had a series of strokes and was placed \r\n  in a nursing home in December 1989. Appellants concede she was incompetent after \r\n  that time until her death in April 1991. According to Appellants, the proceeds \r\n  of the life insurance policies were paid in June 1991 as provided by the Second \r\n  Trust. Because Sara McLeod died a few months before Dusenberry, James MacLeod \r\n  received half of Sara's share of the proceeds, or $75,000, plus his own share \r\n  of $50,000, for a total of $125,000. \r\n\r\nRespondents brought this action seeking to set \r\n  aside the Second Trust and insurance policy on the grounds that Dusenberry was \r\n  incompetent when she executed the documents and that she was unduly influenced \r\n  by James MacLeod and Sara McLeod. The probate court agreed, ruling Appellants \r\n  must return the proceeds of the Second Trust for distribution to Dusenberry's \r\n  heirs. Appellants, beneficiaries of the Second Trust, appeal.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"If the proceeding in the probate court is in the \r\n  nature of an action at law, the [appellate] court may not disturb the probate \r\n  court's findings of fact unless a review of the record discloses there is no \r\n  evidence to support them.\" Howard v. Mutz, 315 S.C. 356, 361, 434 S.E.2d \r\n  254, 257 (1993). \"On the other hand, if the probate proceeding is equitable \r\n  in nature, the [appellate] court, on appeal, may make factual findings according \r\n  to its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.\" Id. at 361-62, 434 S.E.2d \r\n  at 257-58.\r\n\r\nThe parties agree that Respondents principally \r\n  sought, and the probate court awarded, equitable relief in the form of a constructive \r\n  trust on the proceeds of the life insurance policy distributed from the Second \r\n  Trust. An action to declare a constructive trust is one in equity and this Court \r\n  may find facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence. Lollis v. \r\n  Lollis, 291 S.C. 525, 530, 354 S.E.2d 559, 561 (1987). The evidence must \r\n  be clear, definite and unequivocal to establish a constructive trust. Id. A \r\n  constructive trust results \"when circumstances under which property was acquired \r\n  make it inequitable that it be retained by the one holding legal title. These \r\n  circumstances include fraud, bad faith, abuse of confidence, or violation of \r\n  a fiduciary duty which gives rise to an obligation in equity to make restitution.\" \r\n  Hendrix v. Hendrix, 299 S.C. 233, 235, 383 S.E.2d 468, 469 (Ct. App. \r\n  1989).\r\n\r\nAlthough this Court is not bound by the probate \r\n  court's credibility determinations, deference to the probate court's findings \r\n  is appropriate in circumstances where it is apparent from the record that the \r\n  credibility of the witnesses was a key consideration in weighing the evidence. \r\n  Weathers v. Bolt, 293 S.C. 486, 488, 361 S.E.2d 773, 774 (Ct. App. 1987) \r\n  (\"It is axiomatic that the probate court was in the best position to judge credibility.\").\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI. Mental Capacity\r\n\r\nFirst, Appellants contend the probate court erred \r\n  in finding Dusenberry lacked the requisite mental capacity to execute the Second \r\n  Trust and insurance policy. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe parties agree that the relevant standard for \r\n  capacity is a contractual standard. Therefore, in order to have the mental capacity \r\n  required to execute the Second Trust and life insurance contract, Dusenberry \r\n  must have had the mental capacity to understand or comprehend the subject of \r\n  the contract, its nature, and its probable consequences. See Cathcart \r\n  v. Stewart, 144 S.C. 252, 261, 142 S.E. 498, 500-02 (1928); Du Bose v. \r\n  Kell, 90 S.C. 196, 207-08, 71 S.E. 371, 376 (1911).\r\n\r\n\"[A] 'transaction may be so improvident and unreasonable \r\n  as in itself to justify the inference of mental incapacity or undue influence \r\n  or both.'\" Avant v. Johnson, 231 S.C. 119, 123-24, 97 S.E.2d 396, 398 \r\n  (1957) (quoting Page v. Lewis, 209 S.C. 212, 240, 39 S.E.2d 787, 799(1946)). \r\n  However, \"[i]t is also equally true that 'an important element of the ownership \r\n  of property is the right of the owner to convey it on any terms within [her] \r\n  intention.'\" Id. (quoting Brock v. Brock, 218 S.C. 174, 180, 61 \r\n  S.E.2d 885, 888 (1950)). The party alleging incompetence bears the burden of \r\n  proving incapacity at the time of the transaction by a preponderance of the \r\n  evidence. Grapner v. Atl. Land Title Co., 307 S.C. 549, 551, 416 S.E.2d \r\n  617, 618 (1992).\r\n\r\nBoth Appellants and Respondents presented copious \r\n  testimony regarding Dusenberry's capacity. The probate court explained that \r\n  its ruling turned largely on its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. \r\n  Specifically, the probate court stated:\r\n\r\nIt was striking to the Court the obvious inconsistencies \r\n  between the spoken words utilized by the witnesses and . . \r\n  . other subtle non-verbal cues communicated as a part of each witnesses' [sic] \r\n  testimony . . . not reflected in the transcribed record. It was clear that these \r\n  highly educated individuals were more adept than average witnesses in carefully \r\n  orchestrating their responses to questions in an attempt to promote their position \r\n  in the litigation. . . . The Court finds these tactics and subtle nuances in \r\n  the case lessened the credibility of the family witnesses on both sides of the \r\n  case. The Court concludes that even the non-family witnesses who testified had \r\n  bias or motive (i.e., financial gain, loyalty to the family, etc.) with the \r\n  exception of Sara Drawdy . . . . The Court finds that Drawdy was the only witness \r\n  whose testimony is one hundred percent consistent with the time line of events \r\n  and voluminous exhibits that were presented to the Court over the course of \r\n  the lengthy trial. Further her testimony is compelling and completely believable. \r\n  Her testimony is consistent and uncontradicted by her actions.\r\n\r\nGenerally this Court defers to the probate court's \r\n  findings regarding credibility of the witnesses. See Weathers, \r\n  293 S.C. at 488, 361 S.E.2d at 774. However, Drawdy's testimony at trial was \r\n  presented through video deposition, which places us in an equal position to \r\n  judge Drawdy's credibility. Nevertheless, though we agree that Drawdy was a \r\n  credible witness, we do not find that her testimony supports a conclusion of \r\n  incompetency. To the contrary, we conclude that the Respondents have failed \r\n  to prove Dusenberry was incompetent.\r\n\r\nDrawdy described her observations of Dusenberry's \r\n  behavior during the times they spoke. However, Drawdy admitted she had little \r\n  knowledge of Dusenberry and little contact with her. Drawdy met with Dusenberry \r\n  between eight and twelve times during her administration of the First Trust. \r\n  Drawdy testified that much of what she knew about Dusenberry had been told to \r\n  her by either James MacLeod or William \"Rusty\" DePass and that she was unsure \r\n  what she actually remembered and what she had been told. Drawdy acknowledged \r\n  that the events in dispute had occurred a long time ago and that they were no \r\n  longer clear in her mind. She stated that she noticed a change in Dusenberry's \r\n  demeanor during the time she knew Dusenberry; however, she further stated, \"I \r\n  don't know how much of this can be ascribed to a change in her or my just being \r\n  around her more and observing her interaction with others.\"\r\n\r\nDrawdy's main concerns regarding Dusenberry's competence \r\n  relate to her belief that the Second Trust was not a wise estate planning measure \r\n  and that it deviated from Dusenberry's previous estate plans. \r\n  (2) Drawdy asserted, and the probate court agreed, that no estate \r\n  planning benefit was gained through the creation of the Second Trust.\r\n\r\nIt is undisputed that the funds from the Second \r\n  Trust reached the intended beneficiaries within sixty days, while settlement \r\n  of the First Trust took considerably longer. Jenkins, the insurance agent, testified \r\n  that Dusenberry was concerned that settlement of her estate would take some \r\n  time, while life insurance would be distributed to the beneficiaries quickly. \r\n  Essie Arnold, Dusenberry's second cousin and a frequent visitor, echoed this \r\n  testimony in her deposition. James MacLeod also testified that Dusenberry had \r\n  been concerned regarding the length of time before beneficiaries would receive \r\n  payment and that it indeed took several years for him to receive money from \r\n  the First Trust. If Dusenberry's purpose was to supply her ill sister with funds \r\n  as soon as possible after her death, such a strategy makes sense. In our view, \r\n  the transaction is not so improvident or unreasonable in itself as to support \r\n  an inference of incompetency. See Avant, 231 S.C. at 123-24, 97 S.E.2d at 398.\r\n\r\nThe probate court found further support for its \r\n  decision in Drawdy's concern that the beneficiaries or beneficial interests \r\n  of the Second Trust were different from those of the First Trust. Again, we \r\n  disagree with this conclusion. Dusenberry was entitled to alter her estate plan \r\n  in any way she saw fit. (3)  \r\n As stated in Avant, \"[A]n important element of \r\n  ownership of property is the right of the owner to convey it on any terms within \r\n  [her] intention.\" 231 S.C. at 123-24, 97 S.E.2d at 398. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, though the forms of the trusts are \r\n  different, the disposition of the property bears a strong resemblance to Dusenberry's \r\n  previous estate planning. All of the beneficiaries of the Second Trust were \r\n  beneficiaries under the First Trust. The shares of Dusenberry's sisters Sara \r\n  McLeod and Katherine DePass under the 1981 will and trust, the First Trust, \r\n  and the Second Trust are proportionally the same. James MacLeod took a larger \r\n  share under the First Trust than several other relatives and friends, which \r\n  is consistent with the Second Trust. In Dusenberry's exercise of her power of \r\n  appointment in her will and the subsequent alteration in her codicil, she further \r\n  demonstrated a consistent pattern of giving a larger portion of her assets or \r\n  income to Sara McLeod and her children over other relatives. \r\n\r\nAlthough the probate judge discounted the credibility \r\n  of the other witnesses on both sides of this dispute, we note that the witnesses \r\n  who had the most contact with Dusenberry testified that they believed she was \r\n  competent, including those witnesses outside of the family who did not stand \r\n  to gain from the Second Trust. Sara Cox, a friend and former employee, spent \r\n  every Wednesday with Dusenberry until she was admitted to the nursing home in \r\n  December 1989. Cox witnessed the signing of the Second Trust. She stated that \r\n  Dusenberry had good days and bad days, but that she would not have witnessed \r\n  Dusenberry's signature unless Dusenberry understood what she was doing. Pat \r\n  Lara was hired to take care of Dusenberry at night before Dusenberry suffered \r\n  her strokes. She stated that Dusenberry \"was a lady of her own mind\" and \"took \r\n  care of her own things.\" Essie Arnold, a distant relative and friend, saw Dusenberry \r\n  approximately twice a week and stated that Dusenberry's mind was still \"sharp\" \r\n  before her strokes. Helen Dixon, also a friend and frequent visitor, stated \r\n  that Dusenberry was still \"sharp\" and alert at ninety, although she occasionally \r\n  had bad days. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to this testimony, the witnesses who \r\n  testified Dusenberry was incompetent had considerably less contact with her. \r\n  Hugh Macaulay, Jr., Dusenberry's nephew, saw her once a month. Rusty Depass, \r\n  another of Dusenberry's nephews, saw her once every few months. \r\n  (4) Kathryn DePass, Dusenberry's niece, saw Dusenberry only two or \r\n  three times a year. \r\n\r\nWe conclude that Drawdy's testimony does not support \r\n  a determination Dusenberry was incompetent, and we conclude that the Respondents \r\n  failed to carry the burden of proof on this issue.\r\n\r\nII. Undue Influence\r\n\r\nAppellants assert the trial court erred in ruling \r\n  that the Second Trust and life insurance were procured through undue influence. \r\n  We agree.\r\n\r\n\"[W]here a declaration of a trust is procured by \r\n  undue influence it is invalid and unenforceable, but the influence exerted must \r\n  be undue and operate to such a degree as to amount to coercion.\" Alexander \r\n  v. Walden, 287 S.C. 126, 128, 337 S.E.2d 241, 243 (Ct. App. 1985). The coercion \r\n  must be \"the kind of mental coercion which destroys the free agency of the creator \r\n  of the trust and constrains him or her to do that which is against his or her \r\n  will and what he or she would not have done if he or she had been left to his \r\n  or her own judgment and volition.\" Id. at 128-29, 337 S.E.2d at 243; \r\n  see 17A Am. Jur. 2d. Contracts Â§ 237 (1991) (stating that undue \r\n  influence is \"unfair persuasion of a party who is under the domination of the \r\n  person exercising the persuasion or who by virtue of the relation between them \r\n  is justified in assuming that that person will not act in a manner inconsistent \r\n  with his welfare.\"). &quot;[B]y the very nature of the case, the evidence of \r\n  undue influence will be mainly circumstantial. It is not usually exercised openly \r\n  so it can be directly proved.\" Byrd v. Byrd, 279 S.C. 425, 427, 308 S.E.2d \r\n  788, 789 (1983). \r\n\r\nGenerally, the party challenging an instrument \r\n  on the basis of undue influence must present evidence which \"'unmistakenly and \r\n  convincingly' shows the [party's] will was overborne by the [defendant] or someone \r\n  acting on his behalf.\" Bullard v. Crawley, 294 S.C. 276, 280-81, 363 \r\n  S.E.2d 897, 900 (1987) (quoting In re Will of Smoak, \r\n  286 S.C. 419, 424, 334 S.E.2d 806, 809 (1985).). However, the existence of a \r\n  confidential relationship creates a presumption that the instrument is invalid, \r\n  and the burden then shifts to the proponent of the instrument to affirmatively \r\n  show the absence of undue influence. Id. at 280, 363 S.E.2d at 900; see \r\n  Hembree v. Estate of Hembree, 311 S.C. 192, 196, 428 S.E.2d 3, 5 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1993) (\"In cases where allegations of undue influence have been successful, \r\n  there has been evidence of threats, force, restricted visitation, or an existing \r\n  fiduciary relationship.\") \r\n\r\nThe probate court found that James MacLeod and \r\n  Sara McLeod had a fiduciary relationship with Dusenberry through the power of \r\n  attorney, and Appellants do not challenge this finding. However, there is strong \r\n  evidence to show Dusenberry did exactly as she wanted with respect to her financial \r\n  affairs and that Sara McLeod and James MacLeod lacked the ability to influence \r\n  her when they wanted to do so. Under our view of the testimony, Appellants presented \r\n  sufficient evidence to rebut a presumption of undue influence. \r\n\r\nDrawdy testified and the probate court found that \r\n  the McLeods were present whenever finances were discussed. However, neither \r\n  Drawdy nor any of the Respondents were present when the life insurance policy \r\n  was obtained or when the Second Trust was created and none of the Respondents \r\n  had any personal knowledge concerning who was present during those occasions. \r\n  In fact, Drawdy admittedly had very little contact with Dusenberry.\r\n\r\nJenkins, the insurance agent who obtained the policy, \r\n  was a practicing attorney and magistrate for the State of Georgia at the time \r\n  of trial. Jenkins denied witnessing any undue influence and stated that, to \r\n  the contrary, he believed the policy was Dusenberry's idea. He noted she called \r\n  him several times to check on his progress in procuring the policy. James MacLeod \r\n  testified that he left Dusenberry alone to speak with Jenkins concerning the \r\n  insurance policy. Jenkins also testified that he was alone with Dusenberry while \r\n  discussing the life insurance policy and when she signed the application. \r\n\r\nNone of the Respondents alleged that they witnessed \r\n  any instance of undue influence. Indeed, Hugh Macaulay, Jr. stated he was not \r\n  asserting any undue influence, merely that Dusenberry was incompetent. Rusty \r\n  DePass stated that he had no evidence of threats or coercion used by Appellants \r\n  and that he was not accusing them of threatening her. He deduced that undue \r\n  influence had occurred because he reasoned Dusenberry would have never come \r\n  up with the idea of establishing the Second Trust in that manner. Dusenberry's \r\n  niece Kathryn DePass testified similarly. \r\n\r\nWitnesses who saw Dusenberry on a frequent basis \r\n  prior to her strokes stated that she was not mentally incapacitated and was \r\n  not subject to undue influence. Sara Cox stated she never witnessed Sara McLeod \r\n  or James MacLeod threaten or coerce Dusenberry and that Dusenberry was not someone \r\n  who would respond to threats. Pat Lara painted Dusenberry as a very strong-willed \r\n  woman who \"was a woman of her own mind.\" She also stated that she never saw \r\n  Sara McLeod or James MacLeod threaten or coerce Dusenberry and that \"[y]ou couldn't \r\n  make [Dusenberry] do something she didn't want to do.\" Essie Arnold concurred, \r\n  testifying that she had never witnessed any coercion and that Dusenberry would \r\n  not have responded to it. \r\n\r\nThe Appellants' inability to influence Dusenberry \r\n  is further corroborated by Dusenberry's codicil executed in early August of \r\n  the same year, close to the time when Dusenberry applied for the life insurance \r\n  policy. The codicil altered her exercise of her power of appointment so as to \r\n  give Sara McLeod or James MacLeod only the income from the marital trust, rather \r\n  than 75% of the corpus. We think this change disproves any exertion of undue \r\n  influence over Dusenberry. \r\n\r\nThe handling of the sale of Dusenberry's two hundred \r\n  acre tract of land referred to as the Glassy Mountain property also weighs heavily \r\n  in favor of the Appellants. The transaction took place, with the aid of Respondent \r\n  Rusty DePass, after Dusenberry planned for the insurance policy and Second Trust. \r\n  Appellants were not in favor of the sale because Dusenberry would incur a capital \r\n  gains tax and the family would not receive the property at the stepped-up basis \r\n  after Dusenberry's death. They refused Depass's request to execute the deed \r\n  as attorneys in fact for Dusenberry, forcing the closing attorney to rely upon \r\n  the efficacy of Dusenberry's signature. But the reticence of Sara McLeod and \r\n  James MacLeod did not dissuade Dusenberry from consummating the transaction. \r\n  Despite James MacLeod's and Sara McLeod's objections, Dusenberry proceeded with \r\n  the sale. \r\n\r\nBased upon the evidence, we conclude the Appellants \r\n  rebutted any presumption or evidence of undue influence.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the probate \r\n  court is \r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Although James MacLeod is \r\n  the son of the late Sara McLeod and the brother of William McLeod, he spells \r\n  his last name differently.  \r\n2.  Drawdy had further expressed \r\n  concern over the fact that Dusenberry had insufficient liquid funds to cover \r\n  the check she wrote to pay the insurance premium. However, Drawdy admitted that \r\n  the bank had been copied with several letters concerning the transaction prior \r\n  to the check being written. One such letter, dated March 30, 1989, almost a \r\n  month prior to Dusenberry's check, refers to a conversation attorney Frank Holleman \r\n  had with the \"trust officer\" wherein he was informed that the First Trust would \r\n  not possess enough liquid funds to pay the premium until the following month. \r\n  According to this letter, Drawdy was aware of the need for liquid funds to pay \r\n  the insurance premium almost a month in advance and the letter indicates an \r\n  understanding that the funds would be ready \"sometime next month.\" \r\n3.  We note that the First Trust \r\n  was not a long established estate plan. Dusenberry's will and the First Trust \r\n  were executed only a few months before she first applied for the life insurance \r\n  policy. Dusenberry's only other will and trust in the record are documents executed \r\n  in 1981 leaving the bulk of Dusenberry's estate to her husband.\r\n\r\n4.  Rusty DePass's assertion that Dusenberry was incompetent at the time she initiated the irrevocable insurance trust is inconsistent with his actions in the ensuing\r\nmonths.  DePass, a real estate broker, listed and sold a tract of land owned by Dusenberry known as the Glassy Mountain property, making a commission on the\r\nsale.  Sara McLeod and James MacLeod had Dusenberry's power of attorney at the time.  The closing attorney requested that DePass ask the McLeods to sign the\r\ndeed, in addition to obtaining the signature of Dusenberry, simply to avoid any questions of competence. However, they declined to sign the deed, claiming the\r\ntransaction was not financially sound because it created a capital gain for Dusenberry, lost the estate tax advantage of a stepped-up basis for her heirs, and served\r\nno useful purpose. Despite their refusal to sign the deed, DePass defended Dusenberry's competence, the closing took place, and DePass collected his\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3525","title":"Arscott v.

We conclude Bacon's consent \r\n  was not required and accordingly reverse the family court.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nAlthough the relevant facts are largely undisputed, \r\n  the parties do dispute the legal significance to be accorded those facts. In \r\n  May 1999, Bacon and Ford began what the family court characterized as an \"uncommitted\" \r\n  sexual relationship. From May until November, they engaged in sexual relations \r\n  several times a week, usually at Bacon's home. Each maintained a separate residence. \r\n  Bacon lived at his home on the lake, and Ford lived with another man, Shawn \r\n  Harrell. According to Bacon's testimony, Ford told him that Harrell was homosexual \r\n  and consistently denied an intimate relationship with Harrell. Apparently, however, \r\n  Bacon had suspicions regarding Ford's relationship with Harrell. During that \r\n  time, Bacon and Ford exchanged token gifts but did not provide monetary support \r\n  to each other. \r\n\r\nIn October 1999, Ford took a home pregnancy test \r\n  during a visit to Bacon's house and informed him the test was positive. There \r\n  is no indication in the record that Bacon initiated any discussion with Ford \r\n  at that time about marriage or having the child. Rather, Bacon testified that \r\n  approximately two weeks after the pregnancy test, Ford told him she had had \r\n  an abortion. There is no testimony from Bacon that he objected. In the first \r\n  week of November, Bacon ended his relationship with Ford, ostensibly because \r\n  of Harrell. Bacon maintained he did not really know if Ford was initially or \r\n  still pregnant because her credibility with him was \"very slim.\" He also did \r\n  not know if she actually had an abortion because she never provided him with \r\n  any paperwork concerning the abortion as she had promised. \r\n\r\nIn early November 1999, Ford and others were arrested \r\n  in connection with a robbery at Bacon's home. Ford was incarcerated at the local \r\n  jail until January&nbsp;8, 2000. According to Bacon, he inquired at the jail \r\n  about whether Ford was pregnant and was advised she had indicated to jail authorities \r\n  that she was. Bacon also inquired of police authorities if Ford could be forced \r\n  to take a pregnancy test at the jail but was advised she could not. When Ford \r\n  was released on bond in January, she went to live at a local women's shelter. \r\n  In the ensuing months, Bacon asked a number of people if Ford appeared to be \r\n  pregnant. He also repeatedly drove by the women's clinic, a local health care \r\n  facility, in attempts to observe Ford entering or leaving. \r\n\r\nOn May 22, 2000, Ford gave birth to a son weighing \r\n  four pounds, thirteen ounces. When the child was born, Ford indicated to hospital \r\n  personnel that she wanted to place him for adoption. The Arscotts, who had been \r\n  trying to have a family for several years, were contacted by a family member \r\n  who was on staff at the hospital and met with Ford and their attorney. Ford \r\n  executed a consent to adoption, and on May 25, 2000, the Arscotts took the child \r\n  home from the hospital. He has lived with them since that date and is now just \r\n  over two years old.\r\n\r\nOn July 17, 2000, Ford appeared in criminal court \r\n  on the burglary charge. Bacon was present and Ford told him at that time that \r\n  she had given birth. She had a picture with her, but Bacon stated she would \r\n  not let him see it. Even with this direct information from Ford, Bacon still \r\n  did not believe that she had ever been pregnant and had given birth. On August \r\n  16, 2000, Bacon was served with this adoption action which had been filed by \r\n  the Arscotts in July. According to him, this was the first time he actually \r\n  believed Ford had given birth. Even so, Bacon testified he was not sure the \r\n  child was his, although admittedly he was sexually involved with Ford during \r\n  the relevant time period for conception. Bacon filed an answer and counterclaim \r\n  opposing the adoption and seeking custody and paternity testing. Bacon alleged \r\n  \"the natural mother concealed her pregnancy from [him] and service of the Complaint \r\n  was the first notice of the alleged paternal relationship. . . .\" The family \r\n  court ordered paternity testing which established Bacon as the biological father. \r\n  At a temporary hearing on November 17, 2000, the family court ordered physical \r\n  and legal custody of the child to remain with the Arscotts. At his request, \r\n  Bacon was ordered to pay child support of $75 per week and was permitted to \r\n  have supervised visitation with the child. \r\n\r\nFord did not testify at the merits hearing which \r\n  was held in July 2001. The court's order states she was served with pleadings \r\n  but did not respond. Apparently, she appeared at the courthouse on the day of \r\n  the hearing but left before it began. Therefore, Bacon's testimony was the only \r\n  direct evidence regarding his relationship with Ford. \r\n\r\nThe family court found that, up until July 17, \r\n  2000, Bacon \"made a sufficient prompt good faith effort to determine whether \r\n  he was a father, and that the efforts did not reasonably answer the question.\" \r\n  In making this finding, the judge stated he \"[did] not observe that [Bacon] \r\n  did all that he could have done, or approached an answer in the most effective \r\n  manner possible. . . however, . . .a good faith effort does not so demand.\" \r\n  The court found Bacon had sufficient information to \"move into action after \r\n  July 17th,\" when Ford told him she had given birth. Specifically, \r\n  the court noted Bacon could have instituted court action. However, in reaching \r\n  its conclusion that Bacon's consent to the adoption was necessary, the court \r\n  observed:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whether Bacon knew that if Ford had a child it \r\n    was given up for adoption and who had the child is not known to the Court. \r\n    Bacon contends it was only clear to him upon being served that Ford did have \r\n    a child on May 22, 2000; that he was being charged as the father, and that \r\n    the child was in the care of the [Arscotts] in Laurens County. I am unable \r\n    to conclude that because Bacon did not take any known affirmative steps to \r\n    answer the question of paternity and otherwise assume his parental responsibilities \r\n    between July 17, 2000, and August 16, 2000, his good faith efforts failed. \r\n    From a purely practical point of view, it would have taken him at least as \r\n    long after July 17th to get the matter before the Court as it actually \r\n    did. What he might have done had the [Arscotts] not filed [the complaint] \r\n    on July 5th will never be known. What is abundantly clear is that \r\n    upon his being served and the paternity test results having been returned \r\n    positive, [Bacon] has been aggressive and timely in taking the steps and pursuing \r\n    relief indicative of a desire to exercise the responsibilities and opportunities \r\n    on behalf of the minor child in issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nThe primary legal issue in this appeal is whether \r\n  Bacon's consent to the adoption of Infant Baby Boy was required. Resolution \r\n  of this issue involves an analysis of the facts of this case in light of prior \r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court precedents interpreting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1690 \r\n  (Supp. 2001). Specifically, we must examine the facts of this case in light \r\n  of Abernathy v. Baby Boy, 313 S.C. 27, 437 S.E.2d 25 (1993), and Doe \r\n  v. Queen, 347 S.C. 4, 552 S.E.2d 761 (2001). In both of those cases, the \r\n  supreme court found the father's consent to adoption was required. The importance \r\n  of analyzing the facts of each specific case cannot be overstated. In Abernathy, \r\n  the supreme court noted the \"unusual facts before us.\" 313 S.C. at 32, 437 S.E.2d \r\n  at 29. In Queen, the supreme court narrowed its holding to \"the very \r\n  limited facts of this case.\" 347 S.C. at 10, 552 S.E.2d at 764.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1690 (Supp. 2001) addresses \r\n  the issue of consent for a child's adoption. The consent of the unmarried mother \r\n  is required under section 20-7-1690(A)(3). If the father of the child is not \r\n  married to the mother at birth and the child is placed with the prospective \r\n  adoptive parents six months or less after the child's birth, the father's consent \r\n  is required only if :\r\n\r\n\r\n  (a) the father openly lived with the child or the \r\n    child's mother for a continuous period of six months immediately preceding \r\n    the placement of the child for adoption, and the father openly held himself \r\n    out to be the father of the child during the six months period; or\r\n\r\n  (b) the father paid a fair and reasonable sum, \r\n    based on the father's financial ability, for the support of the child or for \r\n    expenses incurred in connection with the mother's pregnancy or with the birth \r\n    of the child, including, but not limited to, medical, hospital, and nursing \r\n    expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1690(A)(5)(a) &amp; (b) (Supp. \r\n  2001). In interpreting section 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b), our supreme court has held \r\n  that literal compliance with the statute is not necessary in order for the father \r\n  to possess a relationship with his child which is entitled to constitutional \r\n  protection. Abernathy at 32, 437 S.E.2d at 29. Rather, an unwed father \r\n  is entitled to constitutional protection not only when he meets the literal \r\n  requirements of the statute \"but also when he undertakes sufficient prompt and \r\n  good-faith efforts to assume parental responsibility and to comply with the \r\n  statute.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn Abernathy, the father and mother were \r\n  in the military when they began a casual sexual relationship. A few months later, \r\n  mother informed father she was pregnant. He begged her not to consider an abortion \r\n  and offered to support her and the child. Although he left shortly thereafter \r\n  on naval sea duty, father turned over his automobile to mother and gave her \r\n  access to his checking account. In correspondence to mother, he offered to send \r\n  her to college and to stay home with the baby if she would work part-time. Id. \r\n  at 29, 437 S.E.2d at 27. While father was on naval duty, mother informed him \r\n  she no longer wanted to be involved with him. When he returned, mother informed \r\n  him she intended to keep the child but rejected his offer of marriage. She also \r\n  avoided contact with him and refused his telephone calls. When the child was \r\n  born, mother gave her consent for adoption to the prospective adoptive parents. \r\n  Father had been stationed elsewhere, but when he learned of the birth and pending \r\n  adoption, he immediately sought to contest it. Id. at 29-30, 437 S.E.2d \r\n  at 27. In concluding father's conduct constituted sufficient and good faith \r\n  efforts to undertake parental responsibility, the supreme court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is undisputed that [father] attempted to provide \r\n    monetary support to [mother] during her pregnancy, but his efforts were rejected \r\n    by her. In addition, [father] endeavored to keep apprised of [mother's] progress \r\n    during the pregnancy, but she shielded herself from contact with him, even \r\n    to the point of complaining to her superiors that [father] was harassing her \r\n    by his numerous telephone calls. [Father] appeared at the hospital after learning \r\n    that the child had been born and offered to pay medical expenses related to \r\n    the birth, but was told there were no expenses because he and [mother] were \r\n    in the Navy. Although [father] sought no legal advice regarding the means \r\n    available for him to protect his parental interest in the child, his lack \r\n    of action was engendered by [mother's] assurance to him that she would not \r\n    place the child for adoption. Further, [father] immediately manifested his \r\n    willingness to assume sole custody of the child once he discovered that adoption \r\n    proceedings had commenced. \r\n\r\n\r\nId.  at 33, 437 S.E.2d at 29. \r\n\r\nIn Queen, the father and mother lived together \r\n  for several months during which mother informed father that she was pregnant \r\n  and wanted an abortion. Father objected and the parties severed their relationship \r\n  shortly thereafter due to the abortion issue. Mother later told father she had \r\n  had the abortion in another state. 347 S.C. at 6, 552 S.E.2d at 762. Several \r\n  months later, mother signed a criminal warrant against father for assault with \r\n  a deadly weapon. A condition of father's bond was that he have no contact with \r\n  mother. A consent order subsequently prohibited father from going near mother \r\n  for one year. Id. \r\n\r\nThe child was born a few months later. Mother did \r\n  not disclose father's address on the consent for adoption form. He was not notified \r\n  of the birth until three months later when he was contacted by the prospective \r\n  adoptive parents' attorney and asked to sign a consent for adoption. He advised \r\n  the attorney he needed to consult with counsel, obtained counsel, and opposed \r\n  the adoption. Between the time of his notification and the final hearing, father \r\n  prepared a nursery and arranged medical insurance for the child. He testified \r\n  that he had a bank account which contained savings for the child and had been \r\n  putting money away since learning of the child's birth. Although the father \r\n  did not make any contribution to the prospective adoptive parents for the child's \r\n  support, father testified he was always willing to do so but they had obtained \r\n  an order preventing disclosure of their names to either father or his counsel. \r\n  He also testified he would reimburse them for their expenses. Id. \r\n\r\nIn concluding father had made sufficient prompt \r\n  and good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility, the supreme court \r\n  noted several facts: (1) mother represented she had obtained an abortion; (2) \r\n  mother undertook extraordinary efforts to conceal her pregnancy from father; \r\n  (3) the prospective adoptive parents prevented disclosure of their identity \r\n  to father or his counsel by court order; (4) father offered to reimburse the \r\n  prospective adoptive parents' expenses; and (5) father undertook steps to prepare \r\n  a nursery, put money in a bank account, and arranged health insurance for the \r\n  child. Id. at 9-10, 552 S.E.2d at 764.\r\n\r\nWe conclude the facts of this case, in contrast \r\n  to the compelling facts of Abernathy and Queen, do not establish \r\n  that Bacon undertook \"sufficient prompt and good faith efforts to assume parental \r\n  responsibility.\" Rather, the facts of this case bear striking similarities to \r\n  Ex Parte Black, 330 S.C. 431, 499 S.E.2d 229 (Ct. App. 1998), and Parag \r\n  v. Baby Boy Lovin, 333 S.C. 221, 508 S.E.2d 590 (Ct. App. 1998), where no \r\n  constitutional right was found to attach. It is not for this court to expand \r\n  the parameters set by our supreme court in interpreting section 20-7-1690 beyond \r\n  the narrow facts of Abernathy and Queen. We decline to inject \r\n  such an element of uncertainty into adoption proceedings beyond that intended \r\n  by the legislation and those constitutional protections deemed necessary by \r\n  the courts.\r\n\r\nIn Parag, this court held that the father's consent \r\n  was not required under Â§ 20-7-1690(A)(5)(b). Mother and father were both teenagers, \r\n  and mother informed father she might be pregnant. He asked her on several occasions, \r\n  asked her sister, and attempted to ascertain whether she was gaining weight \r\n  and had a round shape, but mother never would confirm or deny that she was pregnant. \r\n  She had the baby on vacation and consented to the adoption. Four months later, \r\n  she told him about the birth. Id. at 223-24, 508 S.E.2d at 591. The adoptive \r\n  parents filed an action for adoption and, pursuant to court order, an investigator \r\n  contacted father. He initially indicated he was not interested in the child \r\n  but seven days later, after talking with his father and grandmother, changed \r\n  his mind and stated the child would stay with them until he was given a permanent \r\n  posting in the Army and could raise the child himself. Upon being served, he \r\n  asserted paternity and requested a DNA test. Father testified he offered to \r\n  \"pay for anything\" or take mother to the doctor, but because she refused to \r\n  tell him, could not affirmatively determine she was pregnant. Id.  at \r\n  224-25, 508 S.E.2d at 592.\r\n\r\nIn finding father failed to \"demonstrate a full \r\n  commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood,\" this court held father \"failed \r\n  to demonstrate sufficient prompt and good faith efforts to assume parental responsibility \r\n  and comply with the statute.\" Id. at 227-28, 508 S.E.2d at 593-94. Specifically, \r\n  despite father's claims he was thwarted, (1) father was aware mother might be \r\n  pregnant at an early stage, (2) mother informed father of the pregnancy and \r\n  birth, (3) father was aware that the child was placed for adoption and correctly \r\n  assumed the area where the child was born and remained, (4) father had information \r\n  allowing him to ascertain the child's exact location and cultivate a relationship. \r\n  Id. Importantly, this court noted father's only actions, like Bacon's, \r\n  were paternity testing and participation in the adoption proceeding. Unlike \r\n  Bacon, father in Parag made no offer of financial support. Thus, there was no \r\n  evidence father was thwarted in any way from demonstrating good faith efforts \r\n  once he knew of the child's birth.\r\n\r\nIn Ex Parte Black, the mother was sexually \r\n  active with two men and did not disclose Black as the father on the consent \r\n  form. Black admitted he heard that mother might be pregnant but never tried \r\n  to contact her. Id. at 432-33, 499 S.E.2d at 230. The family court relied \r\n  primarily on father's lack of diligence in inquiring about the pregnancy. This \r\n  court found no evidence father assumed any responsibility prior to the adoption \r\n  action or attempted to help mother or the adoption agency with pregnancy or \r\n  childbirth expenses. Rather, only after he was served with the adoption action \r\n  did Black seek paternity testing and contest the adoption. Id. at 435-36, \r\n  499 S.E.2d at 231-32. Unlike Bacon, father never offered to support to the child \r\n  after receiving the paternity test results five months before the hearing. However, \r\n  as in Ex Parte Black, Bacon's response appears to be judicially motivated. \r\n  Id. Bacon only asked his brother, an attorney, what steps he should take \r\n  after he was served with the adoption action. His efforts came too late.\r\n\r\nThis is not a \"thwarted birth father\" case. In \r\n  his answer, Bacon alleged Ford concealed the pregnancy from him and the first \r\n  notice he had of the parental relationship was service of the complaint. The \r\n  facts indicate otherwise. Ford told Bacon in October 1999 that she was pregnant. \r\n  Although she told him she was going to have an abortion, Bacon stated he did \r\n  not believe her, and she never produced the written proof which Bacon requested. \r\n  Bacon asked authorities if Ford was pregnant and was advised she had completed \r\n  a jail form indicating she was. Bacon continually asked people if Ford appeared \r\n  pregnant. He drove past a local health care facility to see if he could observe \r\n  her entering or leaving. He knew Ford was living in the community and staying \r\n  at a local women's shelter. Although she could not contact him due to the conditions \r\n  of her criminal bond, Bacon was not legally prohibited from contacting her or \r\n  having someone else contact her. Most importantly, from July 17 to August 16, \r\n  Bacon did nothing, despite knowing that Ford had a child and he could be the \r\n  father.\r\n\r\nThe critical question is not whether Bacon believed \r\n  Ford was pregnant but whether he was on notice of sufficient facts to pursue \r\n  his legal rights and whether he was thwarted by the birth mother from doing \r\n  so. Generally, courts rely on parties to be proactive in protecting their own \r\n  rights. Bacon was on notice of sufficient facts to create an affirmative duty \r\n  to investigate whether Ford was carrying or had delivered his child if he wished \r\n  to claim constitutional protection. Under the provisions of the statute relating \r\n  to unmarried fathers, paternity may frequently be in doubt. However, doubt as \r\n  to paternity does not totally absolve a putative father of his responsibility \r\n  to take steps to protect his rights. Most cases focus on pre-placement conduct \r\n  except where there is no evidence the natural father knew of the birth. In light \r\n  of the information Bacon had, and particularly given his personal distrust of \r\n  Ford's credibility, his lack of initiative calls into question his concern about \r\n  protecting his rights as a father. His actions fall short of the sufficient \r\n  prompt and good faith efforts necessary for constitutional protection to attach. \r\n  Thus, we conclude Bacon's consent to the adoption was not necessary.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the ultimate analysis, this court's \r\n  lodestar is always the best interests of the child. See, e.g. Patel \r\n  v. Patel, 347 S.C. 281, 285, 555 S.E.2d 386, 388 (2001) (\"In a custody case, \r\n  the best interest of the child is the controlling factor.\"); S.C. Dep't of \r\n  Soc. Servs. v. Cummings, 345 S.C. 288, 298, 547 S.E.2d 506, 511 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001) (\"The best interests of the child are paramount when adjudicating a TPR \r\n  case.\"). Our supreme court recently overruled a long line of cases holding that \r\n  the termination of parental rights statute should be strictly construed and \r\n  determined that it should be liberally construed consistent with the purpose \r\n  of facilitating prompt adoption and the best interests of the child. See \r\n  Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000). Likewise, \r\n  we consider the child's best interests as a factor here. In Abernathy, \r\n  the supreme court stated that the father's constitutional window is a limited \r\n  one, balanced against the child's interest in stability. Abernathy at \r\n  32, 437 S.E.2d at 28. The record is clear that both the natural father and the \r\n  adoptive parents would be fit parents and provide loving homes. However, the \r\n  evaluating psychologist's testimony is also clear that taking the child out \r\n  of the home he has known from birth until two years old would result in significant \r\n  long-term trauma and possibly severe attachment issues. Thus, the best interests \r\n  of Infant Baby Boy warrant reversal of the family court in this instance.\r\n\r\nDue to its finding that Bacon's consent was required, \r\n  the family court held the adoption by the Arscotts could not proceed. Given \r\n  that Ford gave her consent to the adoption specifically to the Arscotts, the \r\n  family court held that Ford could possibly initiate an action seeking to withdraw \r\n  her consent for adoption. The court therefore declined to terminate her parental \r\n  rights. No specific issue was raised by the appellants to the court's ruling \r\n  regarding Ford. However, due to the role of the courts in protecting minors, \r\n  this court may raise ex mero motu issues not raised by the parties. See \r\n  Joiner at 107, 536 S.E.2d at 374. As in Parag, because Ford consented \r\n  to the adoption and defaulted below, the family court erred in not terminating \r\n  her parental rights. Parag at 229, 508 S.E.2d at 594. The record discloses no \r\n  indication that Ford's consent to adoption of the child by the Arscotts was \r\n  involuntary. Since we conclude Bacon's consent is not required, there is no \r\n  reason to vitiate Ford's consent. Rather, it is in the best interests of the \r\n  minor child to resolve this matter as expeditiously as possible. Therefore, \r\n  we reverse the family court's decision not to terminate Ford's parental rights. \r\n  Ford's parental rights are terminated, and the adoption may proceed without \r\n  Bacon's consent.\r\n\r\nREVERSED. \r\n  (1)\r\n\r\nCURETON, STILWELL, and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Based on our disposition, \r\n  we need not address the additional issues on appeal of termination of the natural \r\n  father's parental rights and the family court's alleged improper reliance on \r\n  the guardian ad litem's recommendation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3526","title":"Joyner v.

Glimcher appeals. \r\n  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThomas C. Joyner was an invitee driving his van across the public parking lot at Cross Creek Shopping Center in Beaufort\r\nCounty.  A tree limb fell on his van, destroying the vehicle and causing him personal injuries.  He sued Glimcher Properties,\r\nthe owner/manager of the commercial property, and Smith Land Resources, Inc., the landscaping/maintenance contractor for\r\nthe property.  The case was tried before a jury in magistrate's court on November 18, 1999.  The jury returned a verdict in\r\nfavor of Joyner in the amount of $2,500.00 against each of the two defendants.\r\n\r\nGlimcher appealed to the circuit court on December 20, 1999. The magistrate who heard the case did not file a return within\r\n30 days, as required by Rule 75, SCRCP.  In fact, he never filed one. (1)  Glimcher never requested the circuit court to issue a\r\nwrit of mandamus to force the magistrate to do so.\r\n\r\nOn March 23, 2000, Joyner wrote the Chief Administrative Judge for the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit, requesting a court date on\r\nApril 12, 2000, copying Glimcher with this letter.  Glimcher made no response to this letter.  On June 2, 2000, Joyner filed a\r\nmotion to dismiss the appeal for failure to prosecute. The circuit court granted the motion and awarded interest on the\r\njudgment and attorney fees in the amount of $500.00. Glimcher appeals.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nHaving timely appealed, Glimcher argues that the circuit court erred when it dismissed his appeal because the magistrate failed\r\nto issue a return.  He argues that \"the appellant from magistrate's court is under no duty to act once the notice of appeal has\r\nbeen filed,\" and that the duty to act rests solely with the magistrate.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the magistrate has a duty to complete the return.  After the notice of appeal has been filed, \"[t]he court below shall\r\nthereupon, after ten days and within thirty days after service of the notice of appeal, make a return to the appellate court of the\r\ntestimony, proceedings and judgment and file it in the appellate court.\" (2) \r\n\r\nSince the magistrate has no duty to provide a copy of the return to the parties, Glimcher argues there was no reasonable means\r\nfor him to ensure that the return was timely filed.  We disagree.  Glimcher was on notice that a return had not been timely filed\r\nwhen he did not receive a notice in writing from the clerk of the circuit court. (3)  Having received no such notice, he should\r\nhave presumed no return had been filed and acted accordingly.\r\n\r\n  Citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-80 (1985), (4) Glimcher argues the circuit court, by its own order, may compel that a return be\r\nmade.  When an inadequate or defective return has been filed, the burden is on the circuit court to direct the magistrate to file\r\nan amended return. (5)\r\n\r\nNo return, however, was filed in this case.  When there is no return, the appellant from the magistrate's court must act with due\r\ndiligence and seek a writ of mandamus if necessary to compel the return. (6)\r\n\r\n  Although some may view the result we reach as harsh, we feel compelled under \r\n  the current case law to uphold the circuit court's decision to dismiss the appeal \r\n  for failure to prosecute. The motion to dismiss was the only motion in front \r\n  of the court, and the court was under no obligation to sua sponte direct the \r\n  magistrate to file a return. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., concurs.  \r\n\r\nHOWARD, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J. (dissenting).\r\n\r\nI disagree with the majority's conclusion that the failure of Appellant to seek a Writ of Mandamus against the magistrate's\r\ncourt provides a basis for dismissal of the appeal under the circumstances of this case.  I, therefore, respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court dismissed the appeal on the grounds \r\n  that Appellant failed to diligently prosecute the appeal. Dismissal by the circuit \r\n  court based upon a failure to prosecute an appeal is a discretionary action.  \r\n  See  Small v. Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 442, 175 S.E.2d 802, 804 (1970). Therefore, \r\n  we should reverse only if there is a manifest injustice resulting from that \r\n  decision.  Id.\r\n\r\nThe majority affirms the dismissal, concluding the failure to act with due diligence to seek a Writ of Mandamus against the\r\nmagistrate is fatal to Appellant's position.  In so holding, the majority concedes the result they have reached may be viewed as\r\n\"harsh.\"  I conclude dismissal is only warranted when there is at least some evidence of unreasonable neglect, which I find\r\ntotally lacking in this case.  Therefore, I would rule that dismissal is unduly harsh, resulting in a manifest injustice to Appellant.\r\n\r\nAs the majority points out, our supreme court has \r\n  stated that the appellant has a burden to obtain the magistrate's compliance \r\n  by mandamus, if necessary.  See  State v. Barbee, 280 S.C. 328, 329, 313 S.E.2d \r\n  297, 298 (1984);  State v. Eaves, 260 S.C. 523, 524-25, 197 S.E.2d 282, 283 (1973);\r\n \r\n  State v. Adams, 244 S.C. 323, 326, 137 S.E.2d 100, 101 (1964). However, in each \r\n  case cited by the majority as the underpinning for its decision, the party appealing \r\n  from the magistrate's court convinced the circuit court to reverse a criminal \r\n  conviction because the magistrate failed to file a return.  See Barbee, 280 S.C. \r\n  at 329, 313 S.E.2d at 298; Eaves, 260 S.C. at 524-25, 197 S.E.2d at 283;\r\nAdams, \r\n  244 S.C. at 326, 137 S.E.2d at 101. Our supreme court held in each case that \r\n  the failure of the magistrate to file a return is not a ground for the circuit \r\n  court to reverse the magistrate's court judgment.  See Barbee, 280 S.C. at 329, \r\n  313 S.E.2d at 298; Eaves, 260 S.C. at 524-25, 197 S.E.2d at 283; Adams, 244 \r\n  S.C. at 326, 137 S.E.2d at 101. Without a return, the circuit court has no basis \r\n  for reviewing the merits of the appeal. Barbee, 280 S.C. at 329, 313 S.E.2d \r\n  at 298. In those circumstances, the burden falls to the litigant to force the \r\n  magistrate to fulfill the ministerial duty of filing a return by seeking a Writ \r\n  of Mandamus, if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn Adams, the appellant was convicted of Driving \r\n  Under the Influence of Intoxicants, first offense, in magistrate's court.  Id. \r\n  at 323, 137 S.E.2d at 100. He appealed to the circuit court and moved to reverse \r\n  the conviction and dismiss the charges because the magistrate failed to file \r\n  a return. No notice of the motion was provided to the State, the Solicitor, \r\n  or the Attorney General. The circuit court granted the requested relief, and \r\n  the State appealed. On appeal, our supreme court reiterated the obligation of \r\n  the moving party to \"prosecute [the appeal] with due diligence and have it promptly \r\n  disposed of.\"  Id. at 326, 137 S.E.2d at 101. The court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent is charged with knowledge of the time limit imposed on the Magistrate for filing the record and of the 60 day\r\nsupersedeas provided by Section 46-189 of the Code.  Having failed to take any step toward effecting a prompt disposition of\r\nhis appeal, Respondent was not entitled to have his conviction set aside and the charges against him dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. The Court then reversed the order of the circuit \r\n  court setting aside the conviction.\r\n\r\nThis language and the action taken by our supreme \r\n  court in  Adams is the basis for the majority's conclusion that dismissal is \r\n  warranted under these circumstances. However, I conclude exclusive reliance \r\n  upon this language is misplaced. In the later case of Eaves, our supreme court \r\n  made it clear that under the same circumstances, even though reversal of the \r\n  conviction was not proper, the appellant below was still entitled to a remand \r\n  of the appeal to require that the magistrate comply with the statute so that \r\n  the matter could be heard on the merits.  Id. at 523, 197 S.E.2d at 282;\r\n see \r\n  also Barbee, 280 S.C. at 329, 313 S.E.2d at 298 (ruling \"[t]he order of the \r\n  circuit court is reversed. Respondent has ten days from issuance of this opinion \r\n  to require the magistrate to file his record with the circuit court in compliance \r\n  with section 18-3-40.\").\r\n\r\nThe Writ of Mandamus is an extraordinary writ.  \r\n  Fort Sumter Hotel v. S.C. Tax Comm., 201 S.C. 50, 61, 21 S.E.2d 393, 398 (1942). \r\n  From the earliest days of jurisprudence in this country to the present, it has \r\n  been limited to those situations in which there is no other legal remedy.  See\r\n \r\n  Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 169 (1803);  see also  Willimon v. City of\r\nGreenville, \r\n  243 S.C. 82, 86, 132 S.E.2d 169, 170 (1963) (\"The writ of mandamus is the highest \r\n  judicial writ known to the law and according to long approved and well established \r\n  authorities, only issues in cases where there is a specific legal right to be \r\n  enforced or where there is a positive duty to be performed, and there is no \r\n  other specific remedy. When the legal right is doubtful, or when the performance \r\n  of the duty rests in discretion, or when there is other adequate remedy, a writ \r\n  of mandamus cannot rightfully issue.\"). Essentially, it is a refuge of last \r\n  resort within the legal system, called upon infrequently, and lying beyond the \r\n  normal procedures.  See  Ehrlich v. Jennings, 78 S.C. 269, 277, 58 S.E. 922, 926 \r\n  (1907) (\"[I]n the extreme caution with which this remedy is applied by the courts, \r\n  there are cases when the writ will not be issued to compel the performance of \r\n  even a purely ministerial act.\").\r\n\r\nAn action for a Writ of Mandamus is a separate \r\n  proceeding.  See  Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 38-39, 512 \r\n  S.E.2d 106, 111 (1999). It is recognized as coercive in nature.  See  id. (finding \r\n  primary purpose of mandamus is to enforce an established legal right and corresponding \r\n  imperative duty imposed by law);  Godwin v. Carrigan, 227 S.C. 216, 222, 87 S.E.2d \r\n  471, 473 (1955) (noting mandamus is employed to compel performance, when refused, \r\n  of a ministerial duty); 55 C.J.S.  Mandamus Â§ 3 (1998) (indicating \"mandamus \r\n  is used to compel action and to coerce the performance of an existing duty\"); \r\n  52 Am. Jur. 2d Mandamus Â§ 1 (2000) (stating mandamus is essentially a coercive \r\n  writ). As our supreme court noted in  Plum Creek, \"[b]y issuing a writ of mandamus, \r\n  the trial judge orders a public official to perform a ministerial duty.\"  Id. \r\n  at 39, 512 S.E.2d at 111. Furthermore, \"If the public official fails to comply \r\n  with the writ, the plaintiff can petition the court for an order holding the \r\n  official in contempt.\"  Id.\r\n\r\nI do not agree that a litigant's failure to take these extraordinary steps can reasonably be viewed as a failure to diligently\r\nprosecute the appeal, especially in the absence of some directive from the circuit court to do so.  This is especially true where,\r\nas here, the litigant has complied with all statutorily imposed obligations in a timely fashion and the appeal has only been\r\npending for five months.\r\n\r\nIn similar settings, our supreme court has been \r\n  reluctant to affirm the drastic action of dismissing a suit unless the party's \r\n  misconduct was intentional. For example, where the litigant failed to comply \r\n  with a discovery order, and the exclusion of the witness eviscerated the party's \r\n  case, our supreme court found the exclusion of the witness by the circuit court \r\n  to be an abuse of discretion. In  Orlando v. Boyd, 320 S.C. 509, 466 S.E.2d 353 \r\n  (1996), the court noted:\r\n\r\n\r\n[w]here the effect will be the same as granting judgment by default or dismissal, a preclusion order may be made only if there\r\nis some showing of wilful disobedience or gross indifference to the rights of the adverse party.\r\n\r\nWhatever sanction is imposed should serve to protect the rights of discovery provided by the rules.  A sanction of dismissal is\r\ntoo severe if there is no evidence of any intentional misconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 511, 466 S.E.2d at 355 (alteration in original).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in those instances in which our supreme \r\n  court has affirmed dismissal of the action based upon the failure to prosecute, \r\n  the dismissal has been imposed to maintain the orderly disposition of cases \r\n  in the face of repeated warnings to the offending party or multiple opportunities \r\n  to proceed with trial, and only then, with a finding of unreasonable neglect. \r\n  See Small, 254 S.C. at 438, 175 S.E.2d at 802 (finding no abuse in a dismissal \r\n  where counsel was apparently in his office and plaintiff and witnesses were \r\n  at work when case was called for trial, and counsel informed the court that \r\n  he could not appear for several hours);  Don Shevey &amp; Spires, Inc. v. Am. \r\n  Motors Realty Corp., 279 S.C. 58, 60-61, 301 S.E.2d 757, 758-59 (1983) (\"The \r\n  plaintiff has the burden of prosecuting his action, and the trial court may \r\n  properly dismiss an action for plaintiff's unreasonable neglect in proceeding \r\n  with his cause.\");  Bond v. Corbin, 68 S.C. 294, 294-95, 47 S.E. 374, 374 (1904) \r\n  (finding where first case on trial docket is set on the first day of jury cases, \r\n  and, when it is called, plaintiff is absent, and in the afternoon is also absent, \r\n  and again when called the next morning, a dismissal for failure to prosecute \r\n  is proper).\r\n\r\nThe ruling of the majority in this case accomplishes exactly the result condemned by our supreme court in each of its previous\r\ndecisions on the subject.  Here Respondent sought and received an advantage from the failure of a judicial officer to fulfill his\r\nstatutorily assigned duty.  Respondent did not apply for a Writ of Mandamus against the magistrate, a procedure equally\r\navailable to him as to Appellant.  Appellant did not refuse to comply with a mandate, or even a suggestion, from the circuit\r\ncourt to file a Writ of Mandamus.  In fact, in Appellant's response to the motion to dismiss, Appellant offered to join in an\r\naction to compel the magistrate's compliance.  Respondent sought dismissal in the first instance, and the circuit court granted it\r\nwithout giving Appellant an opportunity to undertake this extraordinary action.  Under these circumstances, I would reverse the\r\ncircuit court's order dismissing the appeal and remand to the circuit court for entry of an order requiring Appellant to file an\r\naction seeking a Writ of Mandamus within ten days.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The magistrate resigned \r\n  on February 2, 2000, forty-three days after the Notice to Appeal was given.  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-70 (1985) (\"When a magistrate by whom a judgment appealed \r\n  from was rendered shall have gone out of office before a return is ordered, \r\n  he shall, nevertheless, make a return in the same manner and with the like effect \r\n  as if he were still in office.\"). \r\n2.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-60 \r\n  (1985);  see also Rule 75, SCRCP (record must be transmitted within 30 days to \r\n  the clerk of the court to which the appeal is taken). \r\n3. See Rule 75, SCRCP (\"Upon \r\n  receipt of the certified record, the clerk of the circuit court shall give notice \r\n  in writing to the parties that the record has been filed.\"). \r\n4. S.C. Code Ann. section 18-7-80 (1985)\r\nreads, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the return be defective the appellate court may direct a further or amended return as often as may be necessary and may\r\ncompel a compliance with its order.\r\n\r\n5.

(Griffin) brought this action seeking to recover money damages from Jordan, \r\n  Jones &amp; Goulding, Inc. (JJ&amp;G) for professional negligence and breach \r\n  of implied warranty.Â  The circuit court granted JJ&amp;G's motion for \r\n  summary judgment. Griffin appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThis case has a long and involved procedural \r\n  history.Â  In the spring of 1987, Griffin entered into a contract with the Commissioners \r\n  of Public Works for the City of Charleston (CPW) to construct the second phase \r\n  of the Peninsula Water Trunk Main project (PEN II).Â  CPW hired JJ&amp;G to serve \r\n  as the design engineer for the project and to administer and supervise the PEN \r\n  II contract between Griffin and CPW.Â  In 1992, Griffin filed a complaint alleging \r\n  it was damaged by JJ&amp;G's actions relating to its administration of \r\n  the contract and sought to recover damages from JJ&amp;G under several different \r\n  causes of action.Â  JJ&amp;G moved for summary judgment on all of Griffin's \r\n  causes of action.Â  The circuit court granted JJ&amp;G's summary judgment \r\n  motion and Griffin appealed to the supreme court which reinstated two of Griffin's \r\n  causes of actions: malpractice based on professional negligence, andÂ  breach \r\n  of implied warranty.Â  Griffin Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Jordan, Jones \r\n  &amp; Goulding, 320 S.C. 49, 57, 463 S.E.2d 85, 89 (1995).\r\nGriffin filed its second amended complaint on \r\n  June 20, 1996, and a third amended complaint on Apri1 21, 1998.Â  Griffin's \r\n  third amended complaint alleged it was entitled to recover damages based upon \r\n  JJ&amp;G's negligence in the supervision, design, and administration \r\n  of the contract and/or from a breach of implied warranty to provide suitable \r\n  design plans. Griffin stated nine instances where JJ&amp;G harmed it.Â  JJ&amp;G \r\n  moved for summary judgment on seven of the nine claims.Â  The circuit court granted \r\n  JJ&amp;G's motion for partial summary judgment on August 17, 1999.\r\nGriffin's seven claims, dismissed pursuant \r\n  to JJ&amp;G's summary judgment motion, are as follows: (1) damages based \r\n  on JJ&amp;G's interference with Griffin's ability to bid on future \r\n  projects resulting from a derogatory letter JJ&amp;G mailed to Griffin's \r\n  bonding company, which allegedly resulted in a restriction of Griffin's \r\n  bonding capability; (2) costs incurred due to a negligent design that failed \r\n  to show a conflict with an existing sewer line at the McMillan Avenue Tunnel, \r\n  which caused a delay in redesigning plans, resulting in additional dewatering \r\n  costs; (3) damages due to the delayed awarding of the contract to Griffin, because \r\n  of JJ&amp;G's failure to become aware of an asbestos fill in the water \r\n  tunnels at the Fiddler Creek crossing; (4) costs incurred by Griffin because \r\n  JJ&amp;G took one year to redesign around the asbestos fill area at Fiddler \r\n  Creek Crossing; (5) costs incurred when JJ&amp;G required incremental pipe testing, \r\n  instead of testing the entire pipeline at one time; (6) costs incurred when \r\n  JJ&amp;G stopped Griffin from working for thirty-four days due to safety concerns \r\n  at the St. Johns Avenue site; and (7) damages incurred in consultant costs because \r\n  Griffin was required to get assistance in the collection of funds from CPW because \r\n  of delays caused, and unsuitable design plans submitted, by JJ&amp;G.\r\nThe circuit court denied Griffin's motion \r\n  for reconsideration on March 28, 2000.Â  The two parties entered into a consent \r\n  order disposing of the two remaining claims on May 30, 2000.Â  Griffin appeals \r\n  the circuit court's grant of partial summary judgment.\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I.Â  Timeliness of Appeal\r\nJJ&amp;G contends Griffin's appeal should \r\n  be dismissed because the notice of appeal was untimely served.Â  We disagree.\r\nGriffin's complaint alleged nine causes \r\n  of actions against JJ&amp;G.Â  JJ&amp;G moved for summary judgment on seven of \r\n  the nine claims.Â  After a hearing, the trial court granted JJ&amp;G's \r\n  motion for partial summary judgment.Â  The order states, in part:\r\nTHEREFORE, the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment of \r\n  Defendant Jordan, Jones &amp; Goulding, Inc. as to the seven enumerated claims \r\n  is hereby GRANTED.Â  The Court finds that there is no just reason for delay, \r\n  and directs entry of judgment as to Plaintiff's seven claims, identified \r\n  above.\r\nGriffin's motion for reconsideration \r\n  was denied and Griffin did not immediately appeal.Â  Several months later, after \r\n  the remaining two claims were dismissed without prejudice, Griffin served a \r\n  notice of appeal challenging the partial summary judgment order.\r\nJJ&amp;G argues the appeal should be dismissed \r\n  because the trial court essentially certified the order pursuant to Rule 54(b), \r\n  SCRCP, and Griffin did not timely serve a notice of appeal pursuant to Rule \r\n  203(b)(1), SCACR.Â  JJ&amp;G cites federal law interpreting the federal counterpart \r\n  to Rule 54, and Link v. School District of Pickens County, 302 S.C. 1, \r\n  393 S.E.2d 176 (1990) in support of its position.\r\nGriffin argues JJ&amp;G did not move for certification \r\n  under Rule 54(b), and the trial court's order does not cite the rule.Â  \r\n  Griffin also contends even if the language in the order constitutes certification \r\n  under Rule 54(b), the appeal is timely pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. ' 14-3-330 \r\n  (1976).\r\nRule 54(b), SCRCP, provides:\r\nWhen more than one claim for relief is presented in an \r\n  action, . . . the court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or \r\n  more but fewer than all of the claims . . . only upon an express determination \r\n  that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the \r\n  entry of judgment.Â  In the absence of such determination and direction, any \r\n  order . . . however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims \r\n  . . . shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties, and \r\n  the order . . . is subject to revision at any time before the entry of judgment \r\n  adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.\r\nAn appeal following a Rule 54(b) certification \r\n  is the exception rather than the rule.Â  10 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \r\n  Practice and ProcedureÂ  2654 (3d ed. 1998).Â  The rule does not require certification \r\n  and if the trial court chooses to certify the judgment, it must do so in a definite, \r\n  unmistakable manner.Â  Id. \r\nA certification under the federal rule, Rule \r\n  54(b), FRCP, which is virtually identical to our rule, must satisfy three prerequisites \r\n  for the appellate court to obtain jurisdiction prior to adjudication of all \r\n  claims in the action.Â  There must be multiple claims for relief or multiple \r\n  parties; the judgment entered on the certified claim must be a final judgment; \r\n  and the district court must expressly determine that there is no just reason \r\n  for delay. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure at ' 2656.Â  \r\n  A federal appellate court reviews the first two prerequisites using a de novo \r\n  standard, but reviews the determination regarding no just reason for delay using \r\n  an abuse of discretion standard.Â  Stearns v. Consol. Mgmt., Inc., 747 \r\n  F.2d 1105, 1108 (7th Cir. 1984).\r\nThe federal courts define multiple claims as \r\n  separate claims with a view to avoiding double appellate review of the same \r\n  issues.Â  Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Elefant, 790 F.2d 661, 664 (7th Cir. \r\n  1986).Â  In determining whether a claim is separate, the court must consider \r\n  whether separate recovery is possible on the claims; mere variations of legal \r\n  theories do not constitute separate claims.Â  Stearns, 747 F.2d at 1108&#8209;09.Â  \r\n  Where there is a substantial factual overlap between the claim adjudged and \r\n  the remaining claims, A[t]o take jurisdiction . . . would vitiate the most important \r\n  purpose behind Rule 54(b)'s limitations&#8209;&#8209;to spare the court \r\n  of appeals from relearning the facts of a case on successive appeals.\"Â  Jack Walters &amp; Sons Corp. v. Morton Bldg., Inc., 737 F.2d 698, 702 \r\n  (7th Cir. 1984).Â  Because the adjudged claim must be separate and unrelated \r\n  to the remaining claims, Rule 54(b) does not represent a departure from the \r\n  fundamental principle limiting piecemeal appeals.Â  Wright, Federal Practice \r\n  and Procedure at ' 2654.\r\nNor does Rule 54(b) alter the definition of \r\n  a final judgment for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.Â  Id. at '' \r\n  2653, 2656.Â  Under the South Carolina Constitution, appellate jurisdiction is \r\n  to be established by such regulations as the General Assembly may prescribe.Â  \r\n  S.C.

Baltimore City \r\n  Police Dep't, 201 F.3d 526, 531 (4th Cir. 2000).Â  \r\n  In Braswell Shipyards v. Beazer East, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals \r\n  stated in part:\r\nWhere the district court is persuaded that Rule 54(b) \r\n  certification is appropriate, the district court should state those findings \r\n  on the record or in its order.Â  The expression of clear and cogent findings \r\n  of fact is crucial.Â  In fact, numerous courts have held that where the district \r\n  court's Rule 54(b) certification is devoid of findings or reasoning in \r\n  support thereof, the deference normally accorded such a certification is nullified.\r\n2 F.3d 1331, 1336 (4th Cir. 1993) (internal \r\n  citations omitted).\r\nIn this case, we find the circuit court abused \r\n  its discretion in certifying the partial summary judgment.Â  The language in \r\n  the order purporting to certify the partial summary judgment was not in response \r\n  to a motion by either party.Â  The circuit court did not cite Rule 54(b), and \r\n  failed to make any findings in support of certification.Â \r\nWe find further support for our conclusion the \r\n  circuit court erred in certifying the partial summary judgment as we find substantial \r\n  factual overlap between the two remaining claims and the seven adjudicated claims.Â  \r\n  A number of the claims, including the two remaining claims, alleged JJ&amp;G \r\n  knew of existing conditions and knowingly interpreted the contract to frustrate \r\n  Griffin, thereby breaching duties of professional responsibilities owed to Griffin.Â  \r\n  Most of the claims, including the two remaining claims, arose from continuous \r\n  problems in the interaction between Griffin &amp; JJ&amp;G under the PEN II \r\n  project.Â  Accordingly, we find the adjudicated claims were not sufficiently \r\n  separate to warrant certification under Rule 54(b).\r\nAs we find the circuit court erred in certifying \r\n  the partial summary judgment without making findings, we need not address the \r\n  remaining prerequisite of Rule 54(b) certification.Â  Accordingly, we find the \r\n  order on appeal was timely appealed.Â Â Â \r\nII.Â  Summary judgment motion on \r\n  Griffin's PEN II claims\r\nGriffin contends the circuit court erred when \r\n  it granted JJ&amp;G's summary judgment motion on its PEN II claims and \r\n  Griffin advances three arguments in support of its contention.Â  First, Griffin \r\n  argues JJ&amp;G failed to meet its initial burden as the moving party.Â  Second, \r\n  Griffin contends its PEN II claims were within the fact finder's common \r\n  knowledge, and therefore, expert testimony was not required to prove the claims. \r\n  Third, Griffin asserts that even if expert testimony was required, expert affidavits \r\n  and the equivalent of expert affidavits were in the record and created a genuine \r\n  issue of material fact, precluding a grant of summary judgment.\r\nSummary judgment is proper only when it is clear \r\n  that Athere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving \r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"Â  Koester v. Carolina \r\n  Rental Ctr., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994).Â  In determining \r\n  whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and inferences which \r\n  can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  McNair v.

AT&amp;T, 306 S.C. 101, \r\n  410 S.E.2d 537 (1991), the supreme court discussed the moving party's \r\n  burden to support a summary judgment motion:\r\nUnder Rule 56(c), the party seeking summary judgment has \r\n  the initial responsibility of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of \r\n  material fact.Â  With respect to an issue upon which the nonmoving party bears \r\n  the burden of proof, this initial responsibility Amay be discharged by &gt;showing' - that is, pointing out to the [trial] court - that \r\n  there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.\"Â  \r\n  The moving party need not Asupport its motion with affidavits or other \r\n  similar materials negating the opponent's claim.\"\r\nId. at 115, 410 S.E.2d at 545 \r\n  (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986)).Â  Once a moving \r\n  party sustains its initial burden, the opposing party cannot rest upon the allegations \r\n  made in its pleadings, but must set forth specific facts showing that there \r\n  is a genuine issue for trial.Â  Midland Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Harrell, \r\n  331 S.C. 394, 397-98, 503 S.E.2d 189, 190-91 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nGriffin initially contends JJ&amp;G's \r\n  affidavits in support of its summary judgment motion were legally insufficient \r\n  to sustain JJ&amp;G's burden as the party moving for summary judgment.Â  \r\n  Griffin argues that JJ&amp;G's affidavits contained conclusory, non-probative \r\n  statements, which inadequately addressed deficiencies in JJ&amp;G's plans \r\n  and specifications for, and administration and supervision of, the PEN II project.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nJJ&amp;G, as the moving party, who in the posture \r\n  of this case does not have the burden of proof, was not required to present \r\n  affidavits to negate Griffin's claims.Â  JJ&amp;G can sustain its burden \r\n  by simply pointing to the lack of evidence presented by Griffin to support its \r\n  case.Â  Baughman,Â  306 S.C. at 115, 410 S.E.2d at 545.Â  JJ&amp;G's \r\n  motion and affidavit adequately pointed out the absence of evidence in the record \r\n  to support Griffin's claims, and therefore met its burden as the moving \r\n  party.Â  Humana Hosp.-Bayside v. Lightle, 305 S.C. 214, 216, 407 S.E.2d \r\n  637, 638 (1991) (AWhere a plaintiff relies solely upon the pleadings, \r\n  files no counter-affidavits, and makes no factual showing in opposition to a \r\n  motion for summary judgment, the lower court is required under Rule 56, to grant \r\n  summary judgment, if, under the facts presented by the defendant, he was entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.\").\r\nGriffin also contends he met the proof requirements \r\n  by filing a verified complaint.Â  The facts contained in a verified complaint \r\n  operate as a substitute for an opposing affidavit for summary judgment when \r\n  the facts contained in the verified complaint are based on personal knowledge.Â  \r\n  Dawkins v. Fields, 345 S.C. 23, 35, 545 S.E.2d 515, 519 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\n  The record reflects Griffin filed its initial verified complaint on September \r\n  2, 1992. Griffin then filed an amended verified complaint on October 15, 1992.Â  \r\n  After the supreme court allowed Griffin to proceed with the two causes of action \r\n  currently before this court, Griffin filed its second amended complaint on June \r\n  20, 1996.Â  The second amended complaint was not a verified complaint, nor did \r\n  it incorporate by reference the earlier verified complaints.Â  Griffin filed \r\n  its third amended complaint on March 31, 1998.Â  The third amended complaint \r\n  also was not verified, and although it incorporated the facts of the second \r\n  amended complaint, it did not incorporate the earlier verified complaints.Â  \r\n  Therefore, Griffin's argument that its complaint constituted an affidavit \r\n  in opposition to JJ&amp;G's motion for summary judgment is without merit.\r\nGriffin next contends the circuit court erred \r\n  in finding that expert testimony was required to establish the breaches outlined \r\n  in its complaint.Â  Griffin argues that several of its claims fit into the exception \r\n  to the requirement for expert testimony, as they raise issues within the common \r\n  knowledge or experience of the jury. Â \r\nIn South Carolina, a plaintiff in a professional \r\n  malpractice action is required to introduce expert testimony to establish the \r\n  defendant's standard of care. However, where the subject matter is of \r\n  common knowledge or experience so that no special training is required to evaluate \r\n  the defendant's conduct, expert testimony is not required.Â Â  Smith \r\n  v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay, &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 435, 472 S.E.2d \r\n  612, 613 (1996) (stating that expert witness testimony is generally required \r\n  to establish the standard of care in legal malpractice cases);Â  see Gooding \r\n  v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 254, 487 S.E.2d 596, 599 (1996) \r\n  (stating that unless the subject is a matter of common knowledge, expert witness \r\n  testimony is required to establish both the standard of care and defendant's \r\n  failure to conform to the standard in medical malpractice cases).Â \r\nIn Gilliland v. Elmwood Properties, 301 \r\n  S.C. 295, 391 S.E.2d 577 (1990), Gilliland, an architect, sued Elmwood Properties \r\n  for breach of contract to recover monies due under a construction contract.Â  \r\n  Elmwood Properties filed a counterclaim against Gilliland asserting that Gilliland \r\n  was professionally negligent by failing to design the project in such a way \r\n  to fulfill the terms of the contract.Â  The supreme court stated:\r\nThe well known rule still exists that generally, in a \r\n  malpractice case, Athere can be no finding of negligence in the absence \r\n  of expert testimony to support it.\"Â  The claimant in a malpractice claim \r\n  must, through expert testimony, establish both the standard of care and the \r\n  deviation by the defendant from such standard.Â  Here, Elmwood presented no evidence \r\n  from an expert that Gilliand had committed malpractice.Â  Thus, summary judgment \r\n  was, in this respect, proper.\r\nId. at 300-01, 391 S.E.2d at 580 \r\n  (citations omitted).\r\nThe same rule exists for breach of implied warranty \r\n  for negligent design claims.Â  Cf. Republic Contracting Corp. v. S.C. \r\n  Dep't of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp., 332 S.C. \r\n  197, 209, 503 S.E.2d 761, 767 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  Thus, both the professional \r\n  negligence and breach of implied warranty claims require Griffin to present \r\n  expert testimony to establish the standard of care, and JJ&amp;G's deviation \r\n  from the standard of care, unless proof of the claims fall within the common \r\n  knowledge exception.Â \r\nIn this case, Griffin failed to timely present \r\n  expert affidavits or other sworn-to pleadings in support of its response to \r\n  JJ&amp;G's motion for partial summary judgment.Â  The trial court found \r\n  Griffin also failed to properly move, pursuant to Rule 56(f), SCRCP, for additional \r\n  time to supply affidavits.Â  Consequently, there is no expert witness testimony \r\n  in the record.Â  Therefore, Griffin's PEN II claims must fall within the \r\n  common knowledge exception in order to overcome the failure to provide affidavits \r\n  or testimony from an expert.Â  We now examine those claims individually.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â  A.Â  Griffin's Claims\r\nMcMillan Avenue Tunnel/Fiddler Creek Crossing\r\nGriffin argues it was injured by JJ&amp;G's \r\n  original design plan, which instructed Griffin to build a pipeline through an \r\n  asbestos fill area, and to place a water pipeline in a location where sewer \r\n  lines already existed, and Griffin additionally contends it was harmed by JJ&amp;G's \r\n  delays in providing it with redesigned plans for these areas. [1] \r\nJJ&amp;G argues it relied upon soil sample reports \r\n  provided by CPW to design the plans for the Fiddler Creek Crossing site and \r\n  the reports did not indicate the presence of asbestos.Â  Additionally, JJ&amp;G \r\n  argues it relied upon utility studies conducted by CPW when it created the design \r\n  for placement of the water pipeline, and the CPW studies did not show an existing \r\n  sewer line.Â  JJ&amp;G contends that it had no duty to survey the underground \r\n  utilities, as the PEN II contract specifically states that the owner supplied \r\n  the utility locations and that the Adrawings indicate underground utilities \r\n  or obstructions that are known to exist according to the best information available \r\n  to the owner.\"\r\nRegardless of JJ&amp;G's duty to investigate \r\n  the information furnished it by CPW, we find that under the circumstances of \r\n  this case, expert testimony was required to establish the standard of care and \r\n  a breach of that standard by JJ&amp;G.Â  Without expert testimony, a jury cannot \r\n  determine whether JJ&amp;G was negligent when it relied on CPW's studies \r\n  in designing the project, because there is no way for a jury to compare JJ&amp;G's \r\n  actions with the actions other similarly situated engineering firms would have \r\n  taken when confronted with the situation JJ&amp;G faced. As to Griffin's \r\n  claim for damages based on the length of time taken to redesign the plans, we \r\n  again find that expert testimony is needed to evaluate what period of time is \r\n  reasonable for the redesign of the plans.Â \r\nPipe Testing Requirement\r\nGriffin argues it was damaged when JJ&amp;G \r\n  required it to test the pipeline from valve to valve, rather than testing the \r\n  entire pipeline at one time after it was completed.Â  The contract between Griffin \r\n  and CPW instructed Griffin, A[w]hen a length of pipe approved by the \r\n  Engineer is ready for testing, fill the line with water, bleed out all of the \r\n  air and make a leakage test.\"Â  The contract also provided that Griffin \r\n  comply with the testing requirements of the American Water Works Association.Â  \r\n  The Association guidelines provide, A[a]fter the pipe has been laid, \r\n  all newly laid pipe, or any valved section thereof shall be subjected to a hydrostatic \r\n  pressure of at least 1.5 times the working pressure at the point of testing.\"Â  \r\n  Griffin argues these provisions are ambiguous, and are therefore for the trier \r\n  of fact to determine if JJ&amp;G erred by requiring the testing from valve to \r\n  valve.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe find as a matter of law the contract provisions \r\n  are unambiguous.Â  Inasmuch as the construction of the subject contract can be \r\n  determined by consideration of the plain and unambiguous language of the contract, \r\n  it becomes a question of law to be resolved by the court and is thus no bar \r\n  to the grant of summary judgment.Â  See Lyles v. BMI, Inc., 292 \r\n  S.C. 153, 157, 355 S.E.2d 282, 284 (Ct. App. 1987) (finding where a question \r\n  as to the construction of a contract that is determined by the plain language \r\n  of the contract, the question is one of law).\r\nWork Stoppage on St. Johns AvenueÂ  \r\nJJ&amp;G required Griffin to stop construction \r\n  at the St. Johns location for safety concerns.Â  In addition, JJ&amp;G imposed \r\n  conditions upon Griffin before it would allow Griffin to continue construction \r\n  at the site.Â  The site was closed for thirty-four days.Â  Griffin argues JJ&amp;G \r\n  was professionally negligent in its supervision of the contract in two ways:Â  \r\n  (1) in shutting down the site, and (2) by keeping the site closed for thirty-four \r\n  days.Â  The contract between CPW and Griffin required Griffin comply with all \r\n  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) safety regulations.Â  John \r\n  Bell, the JJ&amp;G engineer supervising the site, noted the trench Griffin dug \r\n  at the excavation site had no safety measures in place to prevent cave-ins.Â  \r\n  OSHA regulations require such safety precautions to be implemented when the \r\n  trench exceeds a certain depth.Â  As a result, Bell closed down the site until \r\n  Griffin complied with OSHA regulations.\r\nGriffin argues OSHA requirements are matters \r\n  of common knowledge and do not require expert testimony.Â  We disagree.Â  Expert \r\n  testimony respecting the standard of care for the professional engineering industry \r\n  for such a situation is necessary to determine whether JJ&amp;G behaved negligently \r\n  by closing down the site for thirty-four days.\r\nConsultant's \r\n  Costs\r\nGriffin contends it was required to hire consultants \r\n  because of the negligent supervision and unsuitable design plans provided by \r\n  JJ&amp;G.Â  ItÂ  argues these costs constitute damages resulting from JJ&amp;G's \r\n  negligence and breach of implied warranties.Â  Since we find that the grant of \r\n  summary judgment was appropriate on all causes of action, the circuit court \r\n  did not err when it granted summary judgment on Griffin's claim to recover \r\n  consultant costs.\r\nIII.Â  Summary Judgment on Griffin's \r\n  PEN III Claim\r\nGriffin argues that a letter sent by JJ&amp;G \r\n  to Griffin's bonding company, USF&amp;G, on November 6, 1987, resulted \r\n  in USF&amp;G restricting Griffin's bonding capacity. Griffin contends \r\n  the restriction limited its ability to bid on other contracts during this period.Â  \r\n  The letter reads in pertinent part as follows:\r\nWe [JJ&amp;G] have noted that you [Griffin] have now completed \r\n  approximately 45% of the project and have been paid 41.5% of the funds.Â  This \r\n  would normally be an acceptable ratio of work completed versus funds paid but \r\n  in this case, we are concerned.Â  Our reasons are that we feel that you have \r\n  completed the less complicated portions of the work and that the remaining portions \r\n  of the work would appear to be far more difficult and costly.\r\nAs examples, you have not grouted any of the tunnels and \r\n  you must still complete very difficult areas such as [t]he Filbin Creek Crossing, \r\n  [t]he Fiddler Creek Crossing, Eubank Street, [t]he Meeting Street Crossing, \r\n  Carver Street and Rexton Street to name a few.\r\nFor all the above reasons [CPW] and its Engineer [JJ&amp;G] \r\n  require your advice as to your ability, intent, and financial capability to \r\n  complete the [PEN II] project within the plans and specifications and contract \r\n  completion time.\r\nHarold Pruitt, USF&amp;G's agent, stated \r\n  in an affidavit, A[a]s a direct result of the receipt of JJ&amp;G's \r\n  status report and subsequent November 6, 1987 letter, [Griffin's] bonding \r\n  capacity was completely restricted for approximately a month and a half, and \r\n  restricted to small projects through March of 1988.Â  USF&amp;G did not extend \r\n  authority to bond a substantial project until May 31, 1988, when it bonded a \r\n  $2,000,000 project.\"\r\nGriffin argues JJ&amp;G was professionally negligent \r\n  in its contract supervision role when it sent this letter to USF&amp;G.Â  Griffin \r\n  however does not offer any expert testimony regarding the standard of care by \r\n  professional engineering firms faced with the same facts confronting JJ&amp;G.Â  \r\n  The appropriate behavior for a professional engineering firm in its supervisory \r\n  role is not a matter of common knowledge.Â  JJ&amp;G met its burden as the moving \r\n  party on summary judgment by showing Griffin failed to present expert testimony \r\n  to prove this claim.Â  Once the moving party has met its burden, the nonmoving \r\n  party may not rest solely on the allegations raised in its pleadings.Â  Midland \r\n  Mut.

Robinson, of Robinson Law Firm, of Easley, \r\n          for appellant.\r\n\r\n        Herman E. Cox, of Greenville, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Buddy Darnell Tipton \r\n  (Husband) commenced this action against Teresa Ann Tipton (Wife), seeking a \r\n  divorce and equitable distribution of marital property. The family court found \r\n  no valid common law marriage existed; ordered Husband to comply with the provisions \r\n  of a prior divorce decree requiring him to convey to Wife his interest in the \r\n  marital home; and granted Wife certain affirmative relief. We affirm in part \r\n  and vacate in part.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThe parties were divorced on March 15, 1994. In \r\n  the divorce decree, the family court ordered Husband to convey his interest \r\n  in the parties' home to Wife. This was never done by Husband.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months after the divorce, the \r\n  parties resumed cohabitation. They lived together until June 29, 1998, at which \r\n  time Husband moved from the home. After Husband left the home, Wife placed his \r\n  personal possessions in storage. \r\n\r\nHusband commenced this action in July 1998. Wife \r\n  answered, denying the existence of a common law marriage between the parties, \r\n  and seeking judicial enforcement of the family court's prior order requiring \r\n  Husband to convey to her his interest in the formal marital residence. \r\n\r\nAfter a hearing, the family court issued an order \r\n  finding (1) the parties were not married at common law and, therefore, Husband \r\n  was not entitled to a divorce or equitable division; (2) Husband failed to convey \r\n  his interest in the marital home to Wife pursuant to the 1994 divorce decree \r\n  and must do so within 15 days; (3) Husband must pay Wife $770 for the cost of \r\n  storing his personal property after he moved out of the residence; and (4) Husband \r\n  must pay Wife $2,833.75 in attorney's fees and costs. This appeal follows. \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n  Marital Home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHusband contends he is entitled to an interest \r\n  in the residence whether or not there was a common law marriage between the \r\n  parties because he contributed to the mortgage following their divorce. In support \r\n  of this position, he directs our attention to a line of cases holding that if \r\n  spouses enter an agreement and then resume cohabitation, executory provisions \r\n  of the separation agreement terminate while executed provisions are not affected. \r\n  See Machado v. Machado, 220 S.C. 90, 66 S.E.2d 1049 (1910); Crawford \r\n  v. Crawford, 301 S.C. 476, 392 S.E.2d 675 (Ct. App. 1990); Bourne v. \r\n  Bourne, 336 S.C. 642, 646-47, 521-22 (Ct. App. 1990). His reliance on these \r\n  cases is misplaced because the cited cases dealt with parties who were married \r\n  at the time the agreements were made. Therefore, the family court had jurisdiction \r\n  to determine whether and to what degree their separation agreements should be \r\n  applied.\r\n\r\nHere the parties entered into a separation agreement \r\n  that was adopted by the family court and incorporated into a divorce decree. \r\n  Once the parties were divorced, there no longer existed any \"marital property\" \r\n  over which the family court could assume jurisdiction unless jurisdiction was \r\n  reserved in the decree. See S.C. Code Ann. Section 20-7-473 (Supp. 2001) \r\n  (\"The [family] court does not have jurisdiction or authority to apportion nonmarital \r\n  property.\"); Hayes v. Hayes, 312 S.C. 141, 144, 439 S.E.2d 305, 307 (holding \r\n  family court lacks jurisdiction to modify equitable division unless specifically \r\n  reserved in decree or authorized by statute). Further, Husband has not appealed \r\n  the family court's determination that no common law marriage existed between \r\n  the parties; therefore, that ruling is the law of the case. See Buckner \r\n  v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., 255 S.C. 159, 161, 177 S.E.2d 544, 544 (1970) \r\n  (finding an unchallenged ruling, \"right or wrong, is the law of this case and \r\n  requires affirmance\"). Thus, we hold the family court correctly determined it \r\n  lacked jurisdiction to award Husband any interest in the former marital home. \r\n  Rather, the family court's authority was limited to enforcing the provisions \r\n  of its prior order. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Storage Expenses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the parties resumed cohabitation without \r\n  the benefit of marriage or remarriage, and there has been no appeal from the \r\n  family court's finding of no common law marriage, the court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to determine the parties' property rights in any way. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2001) (defining jurisdiction of family court \r\n  in domestic matters). Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the family court's \r\n  order awarding Wife her storage costs.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court is\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART.\r\n\r\nHUFF and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Given our disposition of \r\n  this issue, we need not address Husband's argument that should the family court's \r\n  order as to the home be reversed the award of attorney's fees should also be \r\n  reversed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3529","title":"Pustaver v.

Case, both of Butler, Means, Evins &amp; Browne, of Spartanburg, for appellant.\r\n\r\nJohnny F. Driggers, of North Charleston, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.:   Theressa Pustaver obtained a judgment against Darrell Gooden arising from injuries sustained in an automobile\r\naccident. This judgment exceeded Gooden's liability insurance coverage limits, and Gooden attempted to claim a set-off in the\r\namount of Pustaver's underinsured motorist (&quot;UIM&quot;) benefits.  The trial court determined the UIM coverage was subject to the\r\ncollateral source rule and, therefore, Gooden was not entitled to a set-off.  Gooden appeals.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nPustaver and Gooden were involved in an automobile accident in Spartanburg County, South Carolina.  Pustaver brought this\r\naction against Gooden for damages.  A jury trial resulted in a verdict for Pustaver in the amount of $290,000.14.  However, the\r\njury also determined that Pustaver was fifty percent at fault, and the award was therefore reduced to $145,000.07.\r\n\r\nGooden maintained $50,000 in liability insurance coverage, and Pustaver had $100,000 in UIM coverage.  Pustaver's UIM\r\ncarrier filed a notice of intent to appeal the jury verdict.  Pustaver then settled her UIM claim for $70,000, executing a policy\r\nrelease to her UIM carrier, in return for which the appeal was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nGooden tendered his liability limits in full satisfaction of the judgment, claiming the $50,000 in combination with the $100,000\r\nUIM coverage available to Pustaver exceeded the amount of the judgment.  Pustaver twice refused this tender.  Pustaver filed an\r\nexecution against Gooden's property in an attempt to satisfy the full judgment.  Gooden responded with a motion requesting that\r\nthe circuit court compel Pustaver to accept the $50,000.00 policy limits in full satisfaction of the judgment.\r\nThe circuit court\r\ndenied the motion, ruling that the UIM insurance proceeds constituted a collateral source and Gooden was not entitled to set off\r\nthis benefit against the judgment. Gooden appeals.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nGooden argues the circuit court erred in ruling that UIM proceeds are subject to the collateral source rule.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"South Carolina has long followed the collateral \r\n  source rule that compensation received by an injured party from a source wholly \r\n  independent of the wrongdoer should not be deducted from the amount of \r\n  the damages owed by the wrongdoer to the injured party.\" Rattenni v. Grainger, \r\n  298 S.C. 276, 277, 379 S.E.2d 890, 890 (1989) (emphasis added); see Mount \r\n  v. Sea Pines Co., 337 S.C. 355, 357, 523 S.E.2d 464, 465 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\n  This rule has been applied liberally in South Carolina to preclude the reduction \r\n  of damages. Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank v. Gregory, 320 S.C. 90, 92, \r\n  463 S.E.2d 317, 318 (1995).\r\n\r\n\"The only requirement for qualification as a collateral \r\n  source is that the source be wholly independent of the wrongdoer.\" Id. \r\n  A source is wholly independent and therefore collateral when the wrongdoer has \r\n  not contributed to it and when payments to the injured party were not made on \r\n  behalf of the wrongdoer. Mount, 337 S.C. at 357, 523 S.E.2d at 465. The \r\n  collateral source rule applies to insurance proceeds. Rattenni, 298 S.C. \r\n  at 278, 379 S.E.2d at 890.\r\n\r\nThe collateral source rule acts to prevent a benefit \r\n  directed to the injured party from resulting in a windfall for the tortfeasor. \r\n  Dixon v. Besco Eng'g, Inc., 320 S.C. 174, 182, 463 S.E.2d 636, 640 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995). A tortfeasor cannot take advantage of a contract between an injured \r\n  party and a third person, no matter whether the source of the funds received \r\n  is \"an insurance company, an employer, a family member, or other source.\" Johnston \r\n  v. Aiken Auto Parts, 311 S.C. 285, 287, 428 S.E.2d 737, 738 (Ct. App. 1993); \r\n  see Dixon, 320 S.C. at 181, 463 S.E.2d at 640. \"It is the tortfeasor's \r\n  responsibility to compensate the injured party for all the harm that he causes, \r\n  not the net loss the injured party receives.\" Dixon, 320 S.C. at 182, \r\n  428 S.E.2d at 640. \"At times, then, 'while a Plaintiff's recovery under the \r\n  ordinary negligence rule is limited to damages which will make him whole, the \r\n  collateral source rule allows a Plaintiff further recovery under certain circumstances \r\n  even though he has suffered no loss.'\" Haselden v. Davis, 341 S.C. \r\n  486, 502-03, 534 S.E.2d 295, 304 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting 22 Am. Jur. 2d Damages \r\n  Â§ 566 at 640 (1988) (emphasis added)), cert. granted (Jan. 1, 2001).\r\n\r\nIn Rattenni, the identical question presented \r\n  in this case was decided by our supreme court. In that case, the decedent was \r\n  killed in an automobile collision proximately caused by the defendant driver. \r\n  Prior to trial, the plaintiff settled with the UIM carrier for the full amount \r\n  of the UIM coverage available, and the UIM carrier waived any right of subrogation \r\n  it might have possessed. Following a jury verdict against the at-fault driver \r\n  which greatly exceeded his liability insurance coverage, the at-fault driver \r\n  asked the court for a set-off of the amount paid in UIM benefits against the \r\n  verdict. The circuit court declined, ruling that the decedent's UIM coverage \r\n  was a collateral source. Our supreme court agreed, concluding, \"We find no persuasive \r\n  reason to distinguish underinsurance proceeds from other insurance proceeds \r\n  that are subject to the collateral source rule.\" Id. at 278, 379 S.E.2d \r\n  at 890.\r\n\r\nGooden contends Rattenni is legally and \r\n  factually distinguishable, and is therefore not controlling. He argues Rattenni \r\n  and McMillan v. John M. Hughes Seafood Co., 328 S.C. 157, 493 S.E.2d \r\n  91 (1997), support his argument that the Legislature has adopted a statutory \r\n  insurance scheme which contemplates that damage awards will be paid from the \r\n  combined limits of the liability and the underinsured motorist coverages. We \r\n  disagree.\r\n\r\nNeither Rattenni nor McMillan is \r\n  based upon the recognition of an overall statutory insurance scheme to prevent \r\n  double recovery or to pay claims out of the combined insurance coverages available. \r\n  In Rattenni, our supreme court ruled that UIM benefits are subject to the collateral \r\n  source rule. In McMillan, the Court applied the clear language of the \r\n  statute prohibiting subrogation and assignment of UIM benefits.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we see no practical difference between \r\n  the waiver of subrogation, as in Rattenni, and the circumstances presented \r\n  here, where subrogation is legislatively prohibited. (1) \r\n  We decline to carve out an exception to the collateral source rule for UIM coverage \r\n  by implication based upon the amendment forbidding subrogation or assignment. \r\n  As our supreme court said in Rattenni, \"Had the General Assembly intended to \r\n  abrogate the collateral source rule in regard to this particular class of insurance \r\n  proceeds, it would have done so.\" 298 S.C. at 278, 379 S.E.2d at 891.\r\n\r\nWe find no reason to distinguish the Rattenni \r\n  case from the facts of this case. Subsequent opinions by our appellate courts \r\n  have clearly affirmed the collateral source rule. See Citizens &amp; \r\n  S. Nat'l Bank, 320 S.C. at 92, 463 S.E.2d at 318; Haselden, 341 S.C. at \r\n  502-03, 534 S.E.2d at 304; Mount, 337 S.C. at 357, 523 S.E.2d at 465; \r\n  Collins v. Bisson Moving &amp; Storage, Inc., 332 S.C. 290, 304-06, 504 \r\n  S.E.2d 347, 355-56 (Ct. App. 1998); Dixon, 320 S.C. at 181-82, 463 S.E.2d \r\n  at 640; Johnston, 311 S.C. at 286-87, 428 S.E.2d at 738.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial judge is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

SCDOR argues \r\n  the master did not have personal jurisdiction to enter the order. We agree and \r\n  vacate.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn November 1998, Sandra McClure brought suit against \r\n  Elliott, seeking to foreclose a mortgage McClure held against Elliott's property. \r\n  Elliott failed to answer McClure's summons and complaint and a default judgment \r\n  was entered against Elliott. The master ordered a public sale of the mortgaged \r\n  property which was finalized in August, 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the sale, McClure discovered SCDOR also \r\n  held a lien against the foreclosed property. SCDOR was not named as a party \r\n  in the initial suit. In March 2001, McClure filed a motion for a rule to show \r\n  cause, which the master issued. The rule instructed SCDOR to appear on April \r\n  25, 2001, and show cause why it should not be required to protect its lien by \r\n  paying McClure the amount due or have its lien extinguished pursuant to the \r\n  master's initial Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale.\r\n\r\nOn April 4, 2001, SCDOR was served with the rule \r\n  to show cause and an order binding it to the master's initial Judgment of Foreclosure \r\n  and Sale, neither of which was accompanied by a summons and complaint. The order \r\n  was recorded, and the Berkeley County Clerk of Court was ordered \"to annotate \r\n  the judgment roll so as to reflect that SC Dept. of Revenue and Taxation . . \r\n  . [is] bound by the aforedescribed Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale.\" SCDOR \r\n  appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over \r\n  a party \"will not be disturbed on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence \r\n  or manifestly influenced or controlled by error of law.\" Indus. Equip. Co. \r\n  v. Frank G. Hough Co., 218 S.C. 169, 173, 61 S.E.2d 884, 885 (1950); see \r\n  also Bargesser v. Coleman Co., 230 S.C. 562, 567, 96 S.E.2d 825, \r\n  827 (1957) (holding the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a party will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal unless unsupported by the evidence or influenced \r\n  by error of law).\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, SCDOR argues the master's rule to show \r\n  cause did not contain the essential elements of a summons and, therefore, the \r\n  master did not have personal jurisdiction over it. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"[A] judgment is void . . . if a court acts without \r\n  [personal] jurisdiction.\" Thomas &amp; Howard Co. v. T.W. Graham &amp; Co., \r\n  318 S.C. 286, 291, 457 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1995); see also Coogler v. \r\n  Cal. Ins. Co. of San Francisco, Cal., 192 S.C. 54, 58-59, 5 S.E.2d 459, \r\n  461 (1939) (\"[N]o order or judgment affecting the rights of a party . . . should \r\n  be made or rendered without [proper] notice to the party whose rights are to \r\n  be thus affected . . . .\"). A court ordinarily obtains personal jurisdiction \r\n  by the service of a summons. See State v. Sanders, 118 S.C. 498, \r\n  502, 110 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1920) (\"The purpose of the summons is to acquire jurisdiction \r\n  of the person of the defendant . . . .\"); cf. Rule 3(a), SCRCP (\"A civil action \r\n  is commenced by filing and service of a summons and complaint.\"). However, our \r\n  supreme court has \"previously excused the use of the Rule to Show Cause [in \r\n  place of a summons] to obtain jurisdiction when it contained the essential elements \r\n  of a valid Summons.\" Citizens &amp; S. Nat'l Bank of S.C. v. First Palmetto \r\n  State Bank &amp; Trust Co., 279 S.C. 252, 254, 305 S.E.2d 80, 80 (1983).\r\n\r\n&quot;[O]ne of the most important elements of a \r\n  Summons is the time it allots for the defendant to appear.\" Id. at 254, 305 \r\n  S.E.2d at 80-81. In Citizens &amp; Southern, the rule to show cause provided \r\n  it was returnable in twelve days, \"rather than the twenty days then required \r\n  of a Summons.\" Id. at 254, 305 S.E.2d at 81. Therefore, the court held \r\n  the rule to show cause did not contain the essential elements of a summons. \r\n  Thus, the circuit court did not properly have personal jurisdiction over the \r\n  defendant. Id.\r\n\r\nA defendant must be given thirty days in which \r\n  to answer a summons. Rule 12(a), SCRCP. In the present case, SCDOR was served \r\n  with a copy of the rule to show cause on April 4, 2001, and ordered to appear \r\n  on April 25, 2001. SCDOR had only twenty-one days in which to respond, not thirty \r\n  as required by Rule 12(a), SCRCP. According to our supreme court's holding in \r\n  Citizen &amp; Southern, the master's rule to show cause lacked an essential \r\n  element of a summons. (1)\r\n\r\nTherefore, the master lacked personal jurisdiction \r\n  over SCDOR, and the order binding it to the master's initial Judgment of Foreclosure \r\n  and Sale is void and must be vacated. See Thomas &amp; Howard Co., \r\n  318 S.C. at 291, 457 S.E.2d at 343; Coogler, 192 S.C. at 58-59, 5 S.E.2d at \r\n  461.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  (2)\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find the master did \r\n  not have personal jurisdiction over SCDOR and, therefore, his order extinguishing \r\n  its lien is\r\n\r\nVACATED.  \r\n  (3)\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concurring.\r\n   \r\n\r\n1.  Furthermore, in the present \r\n  case, McClure based her motion for the rule to show cause on Rule 60 of the \r\n  South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. This is an improper legal basis on \r\n  which to grant the requested relief. \"While a court may correct mistakes or \r\n  clerical errors by its own process to make it conform to the record, it cannot \r\n  change the scope of the judgment.\" Dion v. Ravenel, Eiserhardt Assocs., \r\n  316 S.C. 226, 230, 449 S.E.2d 251, 253 (Ct. App. 1994); see also Ex \r\n  parte Strom, 343 S.C. 257, 264, 539 S.E.2d 699, 702 (2000) (indicating Rule \r\n  60 cannot be used to expand the scope of a judgment). In addition, Rule 60 specifically \r\n  provides for a party's relief from a judgment, not the enforcement \r\n  of that judgment against non-parties. See Rule 60(a)-(b), SCRCP. Thus, \r\n  attempting to bind a non-party to a judgment extinguishing its lien changes \r\n  the scope of the original judgment and extends beyond the relief contemplated \r\n  by Rule 60, SCRCP. \r\n2.    \r\n  Because we find the master lacked personal jurisdiction to issue the rule to \r\n  show cause, we need not address SCDOR's other assertions of error. \r\n3.    \r\n  Because oral argument would not aid the Court in resolving any issue on appeal, \r\n  we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3531","title":"Ness v.

First, \r\n  he appeals an order setting aside an entry of default against Eckerd Corporation. \r\n  Secondly, he appeals from an earlier order in which the circuit court judge \r\n  sua sponte vacated his prior order denying Eckerd relief from entry \r\n  of default. He contends there was no good cause shown to set aside the entry \r\n  of default or, in the alternative, that the first circuit judge should not have \r\n  vacated his order. We vacate both the order setting aside the entry of default \r\n  and the decision vacating the original order and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nVan Ness filed a complaint against Eckerd asserting \r\n  claims for false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and slander. Eckerd was \r\n  served on December 4, 1997. On January 6, 1998, Van Ness filed an affidavit \r\n  of default indicating Eckerd had not answered or filed any other responsive \r\n  pleading. The clerk of court entered default the same day.\r\n\r\nOn January 8, 1998, Eckerd mailed an answer and \r\n  moved to set aside the entry of default pursuant to Rule 55(c), SCRCP. Judge \r\n  B. Hicks Harwell denied Eckerd's motion to set aside default in an order filed \r\n  May 28. Eckerd then filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, requesting that Judge \r\n  Harwell reconsider his determination that Eckerd had not shown good cause for \r\n  the default.\r\n\r\nIn an order dated July 13, 1998, Judge Harwell \r\n  stated \"[he] discovered that one of the [his] brothers has a relationship to \r\n  the corporate defendant which was unknown [to me] at the time this Court heard \r\n  the Motions in question and entered the Order of May 28, 1998.\" He then vacated \r\n  his earlier order and recused himself from the case.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Judge Gerald C. Smoak heard the Rule \r\n  55(c) motion de novo and granted Eckerd's request for relief. Van Ness \r\n  appeals.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nVan Ness appeals Judge Harwell's decision to vacate \r\n  his own order and recuse himself and Judge Smoak's later decision lifting the \r\n  entry of default. We agree that Judge Harwell could not vacate his own order \r\n  more than ten days after it was issued.\r\n\r\nInitially, we note that \"[i]ssues relating to subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time . . . and should be taken notice \r\n  of by this court on our own motion.\" Bunkum v. Manor Props., 321 S.C. \r\n  95, 99-100, 467 S.E.2d 758, 761 (Ct. App. 1996). In Heins v. Heins, 344 \r\n  S.C. 146, 543 S.E.2d 224 (Ct. App. 2001), this court held that a family court \r\n  judge lacked jurisdiction to sua sponte alter a judgment more than \r\n  ten days after it was issued. Although trial judges retain jurisdiction to alter \r\n  judgments on their own initiative for ten days if a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion \r\n  is filed, after ten days that jurisdiction is lost. (1) \r\n  Id. at 157, 543 S.E.2d at 229-30. In this case, as in Heins, the trial \r\n  judge modified an order not as requested in a Rule 59(e) motion, but rather \r\n  on his own initiative and after more than ten days had passed. He therefore \r\n  lacked jurisdiction to vacate the original order.\r\n\r\nAlthough Judge Harwell lacked the jurisdiction \r\n  to sua sponte vacate his earlier order, we find that he had the inherent \r\n  power to recuse himself with respect to Eckerd's Rule 59(e) motion. A trial \r\n  judge must recuse himself if \"the judge or the judge's spouse or a person within \r\n  the third degree of relationship to either of them, or the spouse of such a \r\n  person: . . . is known by the judge to have more than a de minimis interest \r\n  that could be substantially affected by the proceeding.\" Canon 3(E)(1)(d)(iii), \r\n  Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR. In this case, Judge Harwell did not \r\n  know there was a potential conflict until nearly two months after he issued \r\n  his original order. On realizing there might be a problem, Judge Harwell properly \r\n  declined to take any further action in the case, but he should not have vacated \r\n  his earlier order. Rule 63, SCRCP, directs as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If by reason of death, sickness, or other disability, \r\n    a judge before whom an action has been tried is unable to perform the duties \r\n    to be performed by the court under these rules after a verdict is returned \r\n    or findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed, then the resident judge \r\n    of the circuit or any other judge having jurisdiction in the court in which \r\n    the action was tried may perform those duties . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nWe construe the language \"other disability\" to \r\n  include disqualification of the trial judge. Therefore, the Rule 59(e) motion \r\n  should have been heard by another circuit judge. \r\n   (2)\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Van Ness argues that Judge Harwell erred \r\n  in recusing himself. Initially we note that this issue is not preserved for \r\n  our review because Van Ness did not make a Rule 59(e) motion regarding Judge \r\n  Harwell's recusal. To be preserved for appeal, an issue must have been raised \r\n  to and ruled on by the trial judge. Holy Loch Distribs., Inc. v. Hitchcock, \r\n  340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000). If a trial judge grants \"relief \r\n  not previously contemplated or presented to the trial court, the aggrieved party \r\n  must move, pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment in \r\n  order to preserve the issue for appeal.\" In re Estate of Timmerman, \r\n  331, S.C. 455, 460, 502 S.E.2d 920, 923 (Ct. App. 1998). Moreover, this argument \r\n  is unavailing on its merits. The decision to recuse is within the discretion \r\n  of the trial judge. Christy v. Christy, 317 S.C. 145, 149, 452 S.E.2d \r\n  1, 3 (Ct. App. 1994). \"We will not second guess his determination, for whether \r\n  or not he was able to exercise impartiality, he judiciously chose to avoid the \r\n  appearance of impropriety.\" Id. \r\n\r\nBecause we vacate Judge Harwell's decision vacating \r\n  his original order, we must also vacate Judge Smoak's de novo consideration \r\n  of Eckerd's Rule 55(c) motion. (3) We remand \r\n  this matter for consideration of Eckerd's Rule 59(e) motion and further proceedings \r\n  consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\nVACATED IN PART AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\n\r\nHUFF and HOWARD, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. We note that the question \r\n  of whether the trial court retains jurisdiction for ten days if no Rule 59(e) \r\n  motion is filed remains an open question in South Carolina. See Doran \r\n  v. Doran, 288 S.C. 477, 478, 343 S.E.2d 618, 619 (1986) (holding trial court \r\n  loses jurisdiction to modify order after the term in which the order was issued \r\n  has expired); Pitman v. Republic Leasing Co., -- S.C. --, --, -- S.E.2d \r\n  --, -- (Ct. App. 2002) (noting that before the adoption of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure, it was well-settled that a trial judge could modify \r\n  his own judgments only until the expiration of the term of court and \"[w]hether \r\n  or not Rule 59(e), SCRCP, supersedes this rule entirely or is merely an exception \r\n  to it has not been decided by our supreme court.\") \r\n2. This approach is consistent \r\n  with that applied by the Texas Court of Appeals in Bourgeois v. Collier, \r\n  959 S.W.2d 241 (Tex. App. 1997). There, the court vacated the trial judge's \r\n  decision to grant a motion to modify a final order because it appeared that \r\n  recusal was required. \r\n 3. In light of our decision \r\n  vacating Judge Smoak's order, we decline to reach Van Ness's argument that there \r\n  was no good cause shown for purposes of relief from entry of default. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
