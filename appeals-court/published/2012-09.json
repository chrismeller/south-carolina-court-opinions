Connor, IV, of Kelaher Connell & Connor,\r\n            PC, of Surfside Beach, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: On appeal, Howard Jacobson (Jacobson) contends there is no\r\nevidence in the record to support the jury's finding he was personally liable on\r\nbehalf of Paradise Grande, LLC (Paradise Grande). Additionally, Jacobson argues\r\n\nthere is no evidence in the record to support a jury's finding that Jacobson\r\ntortiously interfered with James Broach's (Broach) and Mark Loomis's (Loomis)\r\ncontracts with Advantage Real Estate, Inc. (Advantage). Finally, Jacobson argues\r\nthe record does not support the jury's award of punitive damages. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThis case concerns two real estate agents who sued to collect unpaid real estate\r\ncommissions. Broach and Loomis worked as independent contractors for\r\nAdvantage to obtain sales of various properties, including condominium units,\r\nknown as Horizon 77th (Horizon), to be built by Paradise Grande.\r\n\r\nBroach and Loomis separately entered into identical contracts with Advantage.\r\nThe contracts' provisions, contained in the Independent Contractor and Broker\r\nAgreements (Independent Contractor Agreements), provided the general terms and\r\nconditions of Broach's and Loomis's working relationship with Advantage. The\r\nIndependent Contractor Agreements also outlined the fee agreement, which\r\nprovided that Broach's and Loomis's commissions would be paid after Advantage\r\nreceived payment from the buyer. Both Broach and Loomis acknowledged at trial\r\ntheir understanding was they would be paid their share of the commissions after\r\nAdvantage received payment upon closing. Broach and Loomis worked for\r\nseveral years obtaining presales, sales, and closings of condominium units at\r\nHorizon. Accordingly, Broach and Loomis claim they are owed sales commissions\r\narising from the sale of condominiums at Horizon. This case turns on the various\r\nagreements between the parties, which are discussed below.\r\n\r\nA. The First Agreement\r\n\r\nParadise Grande entered into an Exclusive Sales and Marketing Agreement (First\r\nAgreement) with Advantage on February 24, 2006. Jacobson, the manager of\r\nSilverDeer Management, LLC (SilverDeer), which manages Paradise Grande,\r\nsigned the First Agreement on behalf of Paradise Grande. Advantage's broker-in-\r\ncharge, Eugene Carter (Carter), signed the First Agreement on behalf of\r\nAdvantage. The First Agreement provided, \"Paradise Grande could terminate the\r\nagreement for cause if Advantage failed to have all units presold by August 31,\r\n2006.\" (emphasis added). Further, the First Agreement stated Paradise Grande\r\nwould pay Advantage a sales commission of 6% of the closing price when the final\r\nsale was closed or after repayment of the construction loan, whichever event\r\noccurred first. Advantage failed to presell all units by August 31, 2006. As a\r\nresult, Paradise Grande terminated the First Agreement.\r\n\nB. Construction Loan\r\n\r\nParadise Grande entered into a Second Exclusive Sales and Marketing Agreement\r\n(Second Agreement) with Advantage based on negotiations between Paradise\r\nGrande and Wachovia Bank (Wachovia) concerning a construction loan.\r\nPursuant to its agreement with Wachovia, Paradise Grande was required to have at\r\nleast 80% of the condominium units at Horizon presold to obtain a construction\r\nloan. Because only 75% or 76% of the condominiums were presold, Paradise\r\nGrande renegotiated its construction loan agreement with Wachovia to provide\r\nadditional security. As a part of this renegotiation, Paradise Grande agreed to\r\nprovide a $500,000 letter of credit. Paradise Grande also agreed to pay furniture\r\ncosts in excess of two million dollars instead of including those costs into the\r\nconstruction loan. In addition, Wachovia required deferment of real estate\r\ncommissions that would be paid to Advantage until the construction loan was paid\r\nin full. Jacobson testified Paradise Grande pursued several other options to obtain\r\na construction loan before finally agreeing to subordinate the real estate\r\ncommissions. Further, Jacobson testified that had the letter of credit and the\r\ncommission subordination not been made to Wachovia, Horizon would not have\r\nbeen built.\r\n\r\nC. The Second Agreement\r\n\r\nBecause Advantage failed to comply with the First Agreement by failing to presell\r\nall the condominium units, Advantage entered into the Second Agreement with\r\nParadise Grande. Carter, acting on behalf of Advantage, testified that entering into\r\nthe Second Agreement was a \"no-brainer\" decision. He further testified:\r\n\r\n            The second marketing agreement . . . there was\r\n            essentially no discussion about this, I mean, none. There\r\n            was no deliberation. Some decisions are so clear-cut\r\n            there's just no deliberation. If the project doesn't get built\r\n            everybody is out of two years of work, nobody gets paid,\r\n            or you—they want you to subordinate your sale—I mean,\r\n            subordinate your commission, and you already have\r\n            enough sales to cover it. It's a no brainer. We were all\r\n            trying to get the project built . . . . [T]his is one of the\r\n            things we need to do to get the construction loan, and it\r\n\n             doesn't matter anyway because we've got enough sales to\r\n             cover it.\r\n\r\nCarter recognized that if Advantage refused to agree to the subordination,\r\nWachovia would not have executed the construction loan with Paradise Grande\r\nand the Horizon project would have been cancelled. Carter did not initially tell\r\nBroach and Loomis about the subordination provision in the Second Agreement\r\nbecause he stated that \"at the time it did not appear significant.\" In fact, Carter\r\ntestified that when Paradise Grande entered into the Second Agreement, no one\r\nimagined Broach and Loomis would not be paid their commissions. Carter also\r\ntestified, the collapse of the real estate market was not anticipated at the time. He\r\nstated at trial, \"[I]t was inconceivable that that many people would walk away from\r\ntheir money, and—but they did . . . . Nobody in our industry, in our area had seen\r\nanything like that happen. It just wasn't in the realm of—considered to be in the\r\nrealm of possibility.\"\r\n\r\nParadise Grande lost in excess of six million dollars, it defaulted on its\r\nconstruction loan, and Wachovia foreclosed on the property. As a result of the\r\nSecond Agreement, all sales commissions were subordinated to the construction\r\nloan, and Advantage was never paid any commissions. Additionally, Broach and\r\nLoomis never received commissions for the Horizon condominium units they\r\nsuccessfully sold and closed. Broach received $73,000 as a result of a sales contest\r\ncreated by Paradise Grande to sell the Horizon units, but he testified he is owed an\r\nadditional $135,741.39 in commissions. Loomis testified he is owed $21,917.98 in\r\nunpaid commissions.\r\n\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nOn November 19, 2008, Broach and Loomis filed their original complaint against\r\nCarter, Advantage, and Paradise Grande seeking payment of their commissions.1\r\nCarter, Advantage, and Paradise Grande all filed Answers. Broach and Loomis\r\nsubsequently filed an Amended Summons and Complaint on September 14, 2009,\r\nto include Jacobson.2 Carter, Advantage, Paradise Grande, and Jacobson all filed\r\nan Answer to the Amended Complaint.\r\n\r\n                                                                                         \r\n1 SilverDeer and Wachovia were originally named as parties in the lawsuit but\r\nwere subsequently dismissed from the lawsuit.\r\n2 The Amended Summons and Complaint also included other defendants, but they\r\nwere subsequently dismissed from the lawsuit.\r\n\nA jury trial took place on November 29, 2010. The jury found Advantage and\r\nCarter breached the Independent Contractor Agreement with Broach and Loomis.\r\nIn addition, the jury found Paradise Grande was not liable for tortious interference\r\nwith a contract, but found Jacobson was individually liable for tortious interference\r\nwith the Independent Contractor Agreements between Broach, Loomis, and\r\nAdvantage. The jury awarded Broach and Loomis a total of $50,000 in actual\r\ndamages and a total of $50,000 in punitive damages. Jacobson appeals.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In an action at law, on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of this court\r\nextends merely to the correction of errors of law, and a factual finding of the jury\r\nwill not be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses that there is no\r\nevidence which reasonably supports the jury's findings.\" Townes Assocs., Ltd. v.\r\nCity of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nJacobson argues there is no evidence in the record to support the jury's finding that\r\nJacobson tortiously interfered with Broach's and Loomis's Independent Contractor\r\nAgreements with Advantage. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe elements of a cause of action for tortious interference with a contract include\r\nthe following: (1) a valid contract exists; (2) the defendant has knowledge of the\r\ncontract; (3) the defendant intentionally procures its breach; (4) the defendant acted\r\nwithout justification; and (5) the plaintiff suffers prejudice. Vortex Sports &\r\nEntm't, Inc. v. Ware, 378 S.C. 197, 205, 662 S.E.2d 444, 449 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\n\r\na. Existence of a Contract\r\n\r\nHere, there is no dispute that Broach and Loomis both had contracts with\r\nAdvantage. Even if there was a dispute, the Independent Contractor Agreement\r\nbetween Advantage and Broach was presented at trial without objection. Although\r\nthe Independent Contractor Agreement between Advantage and Loomis was not\r\nadmitted as evidence at trial, there is testimony in the record supporting the\r\nexistence of a contract between Advantage and Loomis. Therefore, we find there is\r\nevidence to support the existence of contracts between Advantage and Broach and\r\nAdvantage and Loomis.\r\n\nb. Knowledge of the Contracts\r\n\r\nJacobson argues no evidence shows Jacobson had knowledge of the contracts\r\nAdvantage entered into with Broach and Loomis. We disagree and find there is at\r\nleast some evidence in the record to support the jury's finding Jacobson had\r\nknowledge of these Independent Contractor Agreements.\r\n\r\nAn email sent by Jacobson indicated he knew Advantage's Independent Contractor\r\nAgreements with Broach and Loomis provided for payment of commissions upon\r\nclosing and the Second Agreement would interfere with Broach's and Loomis's\r\ncontracts with Advantage. The email from Jacobson to Carter discussing the\r\ndecision to enter into the Second Agreement states, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n            Note that all commissions to [Advantage] must be\r\n            subordinated to Bank loan, but this should not matter\r\n            because we have nearly sold enough units to make the\r\n            subordination of no risk to you. I must say that this\r\n            [second] agreement does not address my biggest\r\n            concern— that your team stops pushing Paradise Grande\r\n            . . . . I need to know that your team (I don't really worry\r\n            about you) will ensure not just they are compensated but\r\n            that I and my investors get some profit out of this deal.\r\n\r\nWe find a reasonable juror could infer this email evinces Jacobson's concern that\r\nAdvantage's agents, including Broach and Loomis, would stop selling Horizon\r\nunits because the Second Agreement interfered with their understanding that they\r\nwould receive payment of commissions upon closing. If Jacobson lacked\r\nknowledge that Broach and Loomis contracted with Advantage to be paid upon\r\nclosing, he would have no reason to be concerned that they would discontinue their\r\nefforts to sell the Horizon units. Accordingly, we find there is evidence to support\r\na jury's conclusion that Jacobson had knowledge of the contractual terms between\r\nBroach, Loomis, and Advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nc. Intentional Procurement of the Contract Breach\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we find there is evidence in the record showing Jacobson intended to\r\nprocure the breach of the contracts between Broach, Loomis, and Advantage.\r\n\nAt trial, Jacobson testified he never had any intention of injuring Broach and\r\nLoomis by entering into the Second Agreement. However, intent to injure is not\r\nan element of tortious interference. In Eldeco, Inc. v. Charleston County School\r\nDistrict, 372 S.C. 470, 481, 642 S.E.2d 726, 732 (2007), our supreme court held:\r\n\r\n             None of the elements required for [tortious interference\r\n             with a contract] . . . include \"intent to harm.\" Although it\r\n             is true that harm may result from an intentional inference\r\n             with . . . contractual relations, it is not necessary that the\r\n             interfering party intend such harm. Instead, it is only\r\n             necessary that they intended to interfere with . . . an\r\n             existing contract . . . .\r\n\r\nWhile the issue of whether Jacobson intentionally procured the breach of contract\r\nis a close call, we find that based on our supreme court's decision in Eldeco, there\r\nis some evidence Jacobson intentionally interfered with Broach's and Loomis's\r\ncontracts with Advantage. Even if the purpose of the subordination clause was to\r\nsave the Horizon project, Jacobson directly interfered with Broach's and Loomis's\r\nIndependent Contractor Agreements by negotiating the subordination clause with\r\nWachovia while knowing the subordination would necessitate the alteration of\r\nBroach's and Loomis's rights to immediate payment at closing.\r\n\r\nd. Absence of Justification\r\n\r\nJacobson argues that even if he intentionally procured the breach of the\r\nIndependent Contractor Agreements, he was justified in executing the Second\r\nAgreement. We agree.\r\n\r\nHere, the evidence in the record establishes only that Jacobson was justified in\r\nentering the Second Agreement. Advantage breached the First Agreement. As a\r\nresult, Jacobson remained free to enter into a subsequent contract with Advantage\r\non different terms. See S.C. Dep't. of Consumer Affairs v. Rent-A-Center, Inc., 345\r\nS.C. 251, 255, 547 S.E.2d 881, 883 (Ct. App. 2001) (\"Generally, parties are free to\r\ncontract for terms upon which they agree.\"); Huckaby v. Confederate Motor\r\nSpeedway, Inc., 276 S.C. 629, 630, 281 S.E.2d 223, 224 (1981) (\"[P]eople should\r\nbe free to contract as they choose.\"). Moreover, Jacobson testified the sole purpose\r\nfor the Second Agreement was to save the Horizon project so that everyone,\r\nincluding Broach and Loomis, could get paid. Accordingly, there is no evidence to\r\nrefute Jacobson acted in good faith when exercising his legal right to contract, and\r\n\nwe find Jacobson was justified in entering into the Second Agreement, which\r\nsubordinated Broach's and Loomis's commissions.\r\n\r\nAs we find Jacobson justified in interfering with Broach's and Loomis's contracts,\r\nwe find the requisite elements to establish tortious interference with a contract are\r\nnot present. See Eldeco, 372 S.C. at 480, 642 S.E.2d at 731 (holding a plaintiff\r\nmust show absence of justification to establish a cause of action for tortious\r\ninterference with a contract). As a result, we conclude the jury's finding that\r\nJacobson is liable for tortious interference with a contract is unsupported by the\r\nevidence, and we reverse on this ground.3\r\n\r\nB. Punitive Damages\r\n\r\nJacobson argues the record does not support the jury's award of punitive damages.\r\nWe agree.\r\n\r\nBased on our decision to reverse the jury's finding that Jacobson was liable for\r\ntortious interference with a contract, we must also reverse the jury's award of\r\npunitive damages. Punitive damages are predicated on the existence of actual\r\ndamages, and Broach and Loomis have no other causes of action on which an\r\nactual damages award could be based. See O'Neal v. Carolina Farm Supply of\r\nJohnston, Inc., 279 S.C. 490, 497, 309 S.E.2d 776, 780 (Ct. App. 1983) (\"Punitive\r\ndamages may be recovered only if the plaintiff proves his entitlement to actual\r\ndamages.\").                                                                               \r\n3 Because we find Jacobson's conduct was justified, we decline to address the\r\nremaining elements of tortious interference with a contract and decline to address\r\nJacobson's argument that he cannot be held personally liable for the tort. See Futch\r\nv. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598\r\n(1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its\r\ndetermination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal); S.

Specifically, the Moores argue the trial court\r\nerred in: (1) basing its decision on the incorrect survey; (2) denying the Moores'\r\nmotion for directed verdict based upon standing; (3) allowing inadmissible,\r\nunreliable hearsay testimony into the record; (4) basing its order upon findings of\r\nfact not reflected in the record; and (5) revealing bias in favor of the Respondents.\r\nWe affirm the trial court.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn 1905, William E. Danley purchased approximately eight and one-half acres near\r\nthe town of Lincolnville.1 A plat of that property was prepared by J. Hamilton\r\nKnight (Knight plat) at the time of the conveyance and depicted an \"old wagon\r\nroad\" running across the northern portion of the property before turning north\r\nacross railroad tracks to the town of Ladson. Railroad tracks also ran along the\r\nnorthern boundary of the property.\r\n\r\nDanley subsequently conveyed two and one-half acres of his property to William\r\nM. Richardson in 1910. He also conveyed a strip of land measuring 29 feet by 232\r\n\r\n1 The Danley tract and Lot No. 13, which will be discussed below, were formerly\r\nsituated in Berkeley County but are now located in Charleston County.\r\n\nfeet (the \"boot\") to Central Realty Company (Central) in 1912. Everyone agreed\r\nthe original purpose of the boot was to connect a planned subdivision to the old\r\nwagon road shown on the Knight plat to provide ingress and egress to Ladson.\r\nTitle to the remaining acreage (Danley property) remained in the Danley family\r\nuntil the property was sold for non-payment of taxes to Charles Ross in 1959, who\r\nreconveyed the property to Harriet Durrant and Elizabeth Staggers by deed in\r\n1960.2 Since that time, Durrant and Staggers have paid the taxes on the Danley\r\nproperty still shown as containing eight and one-half acres.\r\n\r\nThe two and one-half acre parcel and boot that Danley sold to Richardson and\r\nCentral, respectively, were conveyed to Union Corporation (Union) in April of\r\n1913. The deed for that conveyance referenced a plat prepared by James O'Hear\r\ndated February 1912 (O'Hear Plat). In preparation of the planned subdivision\r\n(Ladson Farms), Union had McCrady Brothers and Cheves, Inc. do a tracing\r\n(McCrady Tracing), dated September 20, 1917. The tracing was prepared using\r\nthe O'Hear Plat. Lot No. 13 of Ladson Farms was sold to Patrick Hanley in 1917,\r\nand that conveyance references the McCrady Tracing.\r\n\r\nElgie Moore (Elgie), originally purchased fifty-seven acres to the south of the\r\ndisputed property from Elaine Harrell Finklea in 1976. Thereafter, Elgie filed a\r\nplat prepared by James O'Hear Sanders (Sanders Plat) purporting to show the\r\npurchase of sixty-nine acres instead of fifty-seven acres. The additional acreage\r\nconsisted of a large portion of Lot No. 13, then owned by the heirs of Hanley. The\r\nheirs of Hanley filed a boundary dispute action against Elgie. The boundary\r\ndispute between the heirs of Hanley and Elgie was settled with Elgie purchasing\r\nLot No. 13 by quitclaim and special warranty deeds in 1999.3 A plat prepared by\r\nGeorge A.Z. Johnson (Johnson Plat) depicted Lot No. 13 as it was conveyed in the\r\nquitclaim deed. All parties concede the Johnson Plat is incorrect.\r\n\r\nRespondents initially commenced this action on July 30, 2007, to quiet title to and\r\ndetermine the boundary of their property. Respondents also moved to refer the\r\naction to the Master in Equity, but the Moores objected and requested a trial by\r\njury for the boundary dispute. The trial court ruled the boundary dispute would be\r\ntried by a jury, but the presiding trial court would determine how to handle the\r\nequitable issues. Upon the call of the case, all parties agreed to a bench trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n2Durant and Staggers were the daughters of Danley. \n\r\n3The resulting piece of property from this settlement will be referred to as the \n\r\nMoore property. \n\r\n\nThe granddaughters of Danley, Sylvia H. Durant Cotton and Janie Durant Ancrum,\r\ntestified at the trial. Cotton was 79 years old and Ancrum was 69 years old.\r\nCotton lived on the Danley property at some point during her childhood and both\r\nwomen visited the Danley property as children. They testified that they would take\r\na train to the Lincolnville Station and walk the mile to the Danley property along\r\nwhat was then a dirt road known as the old Lincolnville Road. Both remembered\r\ncrossing over a small wooden bridge Danley built over a ditch on the side of old\r\nLincolnville Road to get to his property. Cotton recalled that in the 1930's there\r\nwas an old wagon road on the other side of the wooden bridge that connected to\r\nthe adjoining subdivision.4 Cotton also testified that in the early 1960's,\r\nLincolnville Road was widened and paved. In order to widen the road, Cotton\r\nstated that a certain amount of land was taken from all the property along it,\r\nincluding the Danley property. Furthermore, she stated the Highway Department\r\npaved over the old wagon road as part of the widening of the highway. Cotton\r\ncontinued to visit the Danley property even after the family home collapsed. She\r\nstated that Elgie stopped her a few times while she was visiting the Danley\r\nproperty to ask her who she was and what she was doing there.\r\n\r\nAncrum was born after her grandfather passed away in 1939 and did not remember\r\nan old wagon road. She did remember a sandy path that led from the wooden\r\nbridge to her grandmother's fenced front yard. Ancrum testified that the Highway\r\nDepartment paved and widened Lincolnville Road to make it a highway. The\r\nwidening included creating shoulders on the side of the highway and a ditch on at\r\nleast one side. Due to the widening, Ancrum stated the sandy path she used to\r\nwalk along had to be paved.\r\n\r\nRespondents also offered the testimony of Ben Coker. Coker had been a land\r\nsurveyor for 36 years.5 He started his own business with a partner and performed\r\nland surveying for South Carolina Electric and Gas, Mead Westvaco, and Dupont,\r\nas well as others. He had been appointed as a land surveyor by the Master in\r\nEquity in Dorchester County and qualified as an expert witness in other cases.\r\nHere, Coker was qualified as an expert land surveyor by the trial court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 After a review of the plats and testimony, it appears this portion of the old wagon\r\nroad ran parallel to Lincolnville Road.\r\n5 Coker is an unlicensed surveyor. However, he stated the only difference between\r\nan unlicensed and a licensed surveyor is that an unlicensed surveyor cannot sign a\r\nplat.\r\n\nCoker began by discussing the Knight Plat and testified it was not drawn to scale,\r\ncontained only limited measurements, and did not show where the old wagon road\r\nwas located on the property, how wide it was, or how far it was from the railroad\r\ntracks. Coker explained a Mead Westvaco plat, which depicted the boundary of an\r\nadjacent property, showed that an oak tree marked the northwestern corner of its\r\nproperty, which was also the southwestern corner of the Moore property. Coker\r\nwas able to locate an oak tree that matched the description given in the Mead\r\nWestvaco plat. The oak tree was also referenced on the O'Hear Plat. He testified\r\nthat while the actual tree had blown over, the stump was still standing and a rebar\r\nwas found in it. After plotting the southern boundary from the oak tree to a square\r\niron at the southeastern corner of the Danley property, Coker testified that his plat\r\n(Coker Plat), the Sanders Plat, and the Knight Plat all agreed on at least the\r\nsouthern boundary line. Coker continued to describe his procedure for surveying\r\nthe disputed property. Coker stated that after looking at the Highway Department's\r\ncondemnation plans, it was apparent the Highway Department was attempting to\r\nlay the new highway as best they could right on top of the existing old Lincolnville\r\nRoad. Furthermore, he stated the boot is now located within the confines of the\r\nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) right-of-way as well as the railroad right-of­\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe Moores cross-examined Coker on his use or non-use of the railroad right-of­\r\nway as a boundary, but the full record of that line of questioning was not provided.\r\nAfter being given a hypothetical where the northern boundary is assumed to be the\r\nrailroad right-of-way, Coker agreed six feet would be left in the boot property after\r\nsubtracting the land taken by the DOT right-of-way.\r\n\r\nThe Moores' expert surveyor, Ronnie L. Tyler, explained his method for preparing\r\nhis plat (Tyler Plat). Tyler testified the oak tree Coker used as a boundary marker\r\ndid not exist any longer because the tree was laying on its side with the root system\r\nattached to the end of the trunk. He stated the iron pin that was found in the oak\r\ntree's place was set by a surveying company in 2002, but was not accurate because\r\nthere was a possible six and one-half foot variance due to the tree's uprooted\r\nposition. Further, he testified he would have started with the railroad right-of-way\r\nas the constant and not the oak tree in order to line the property. Tyler stated he\r\nhad not had an opportunity to finish his survey work, including the measuring of\r\nthe remaining boot. The trial court granted the Moores forty-five days to allow\r\nTyler to complete his survey and agreed to hold the case in abeyance until that\r\ntime.\r\n\nWhen the trial court reconvened, a settlement offer was placed on the record,\r\nwhich the Moores had refused. Thereafter, Respondents offered rebuttal expert\r\ntestimony from Frank McAuley to confirm Coker's testimony and survey.\r\nMcAuley testified he became involved through an attorney in Columbia that\r\ninquired about information concerning a title claim against Old Republic Title\r\nCompany. He was asked to go with Coker and review all the work that had been\r\ndone to prepare the Coker Plat. McAuley confirmed that the oak tree used in the\r\nCoker Plat would have been an accurate point to use. He also stated the boot\r\nwould have existed underneath the pavement of what was a highway. When\r\nquestioned about the differing placement of the boot on the older plats, he\r\nanswered that[s]ome of [the old plats] had it on the north side of the\r\n             railroad right of way. Some had it on the north side of\r\n             the highway right of way and so forth and they just\r\n             couldn't agree. I don't think they actually knew where it\r\n             was or worried about it because they were trying to get\r\n             connection to the crossing road.\r\n\r\nMcAuley concluded after reviewing all the documents and measurements that the\r\nCoker Plat was an accurate representation.\r\n\r\nThe trial court found \"[t]here was no separate conveyance of the two and a half (2\r\n½) acres or the boot into the [Respondents'] predecessor in title.\" Further, the trial\r\ncourt stated \"[b]oth parcels were included in the conveyance of the larger five\r\nhundred and thirty-six (536) acres to Central Realty which was later conveyed to\r\nthe Union Corporation.\" It found the Coker Plat was prepared in accordance with\r\nthe O'Hear plat and the McCrady Tracing of Ladson Farms which was \"specifically\r\nreferenced in the conveyance of Lot No. 13 to Hanley from whom the [Moores]\r\ntook title.\" The trial court stated \"[t]he [Moores'] claim of ownership to Lot No. 13\r\n[was] limited as to what was conveyed to Mr. Hanley, their predecessor in title,\r\nand they are entitled to nothing more and to nothing less.\" Furthermore, it found\r\nthe boot was taken by the Highway Department during the construction of the clay\r\nsurfaced Old Ladson Road in the early 1940's and \"when the Highway Department\r\nwidened, paved [the highway] in 1951 and 1964.\" The trial court proceeded to\r\nexplain that its finding was based on: (1) measurements shown of the property line\r\n\"between the Danley property and Lot No. 13 being four hundred and forty-four\r\n(444) feet to the point where it connected to the boot as shown on the O'Hear plat\r\nand the tracing of Ladson Farms\"; (2) \"the testimony of [Cotton] and [Ancrum]\r\nthat no wagon road existed on the northern boundary of their grandfather's property\r\n\nafter the Old Ladson Road was constructed in the early 1940's\" and (3) \"the\r\nHighway Department drawing for the improvement of Van Oshen Road in 1951\r\nand further improvements in 1964, neither of which showed any road existing on\r\nthe south side of Old Ladson Road or Lincolnville Road.\"\r\n\r\nThe trial court enjoined the Moores from entering Appellants' property or\r\ninterfering with their use or enjoyment of it. Further, the trial court authorized\r\nCoker to enter the Moores' and the Appellants' property for the sole purpose of\r\nplacing survey stakes or markers on each of the corners of the properties.\r\n\r\nAlso, on January 8, 2010, the trial court ordered the equitable issues be tried by a\r\nMaster in Equity. The Moores' motion to reconsider was denied, and this appeal\r\nwas filed on February 8, 2010. Elgie passed away on March 21, 2010, but Larry\r\nMoore (Larry), Elgie's son and heir to the property in dispute, remains a party.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n   1. Did the trial court err in its decision to rely upon the Coker Plat over the\r\n      Tyler Plat?\r\n\r\n   2. Did the trial court err in denying the Moores' motion for a directed verdict\r\n      on the issue of Respondents' standing?\r\n\r\n   3. Did the trial court err in allowing impermissible hearsay testimony on \n\r\n      several occasions? \n\r\n\r\n   4. Did the trial court err by basing its decision on findings of fact that were not\r\n      supported by the testimony in the record?\r\n\r\n   5.

Surveys\r\n\r\nThe Moores contend the trial court was presented with conflicting expert testimony\r\nand surveys, and its choice to rely on Coker and the Coker Plat was unreasonable\r\nand warrants a reversal by this court. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe Moores seem to imply Coker's status as an unlicensed surveyor undermines\r\nhis credibility, although they do not specifically raise an issue regarding the trial\r\ncourt's qualification of Coker as an expert. While Coker was not a licensed land\r\nsurveyor, the trial court found his training and experience qualified him as an\r\nexpert as to the boundary line in this case, and we do not see any reason to doubt\r\nthat qualification. See Pope v. Heritage Cmtys., Inc., 395 S.C. 404, 423-24, 717\r\nS.E.2d 765, 775 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"The qualification of an expert witness and the\r\nadmissibility of his or her opinion are matters within the sound discretion of the\r\ntrial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion\r\nand a showing of prejudice. . . . As a gatekeeper, the trial court must examine the\r\nsubstance of the testimony to determine if it is reliable, regardless of whether the\r\nexpert evidence is scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.\" (internal\r\ncitations and quotations omitted)).\r\n\r\nReaching the issues that were specifically raised regarding the trial court's reliance\r\non the Coker Plat, the Moores contend: (1) the trial court failed to recognize and\r\nfollow established law that natural boundaries and monuments, when present,\r\nestablish the intent of earlier surveys and grantors rather than artificial monuments;\r\n(2) the trial court failed to recognize and follow the metes and bounds of the deed\r\nby which the two and one-half acre parcel was conveyed by Danley to Richardson;\r\n(3) the trial court erred in ruling that Coker's work, even though it was certified by\r\nPaul Lawson, was accurate; (4) the trial court failed to consider a deed and plat\r\n\nfrom Emerson and Richardson conveying property to the south of the two and one-\r\nhalf acre parcel; (5) the trial court erred in relying upon deeds and plats to\r\ndetermine the boundaries of the boot, the two and one-half acre parcel, and what\r\nremains of the Danley property, which were subsequent to the Respondents'\r\npredecessor in title's conveyance out of their ownership and which are inconsistent\r\nwith those senior deeds and plats; (6) the trial court erred in finding the boot was in\r\nthe railroad right-of-way; (7) the trial court erred in finding Coker correctly\r\nidentified the location of the oak tree believed to mark the southwest corner; (8)\r\nthe trial court failed to hold the Respondents to the existing property law requiring\r\nthem to have constructive notice of all deeds and plats in their own chain of title;\r\n(9) the trial court erred in finding that the two and one-half acres and the boot were\r\nconveyed at the same time; (10) the trial court erred in accepting the Coker Plat as\r\naccurate when it was inconsistent with prior plats drawn by Coker as well as\r\nRespondents' pleadings; and (11) the trial court erred in finding that any part of the\r\nDanley property conveyed by the 1905 plat could have been within the railroad\r\nright-of-way. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The rules for determining disputed boundaries are not inflexible, but are subject to\r\nmodification depending upon the particular facts of each case.\" Bodiford, 317 S.C.\r\nat 543 n.1, 455 S.E.2d at 197 n.1 (citing Garrett v. Locke, 309 S.C. 94, 98, 419\r\nS.E.2d 842, 845 (Ct. App. 1992)). \"When determining boundaries, resort is\r\ngenerally had first to natural boundaries, next to artificial monuments, then to\r\nadjacent boundaries, and last to courses and distances.\" Id. (citing Garrett, 309\r\nS.C. at 98, 419 S.E.2d at 845). \"This rule, however, merely indicates the weight\r\ngenerally given to each type of evidence of location.\" Id. (citing Southern Realty\r\n& Investment Co. v. Keenan, 99 S.C. 200, 207-09, 83 S.E. 39, 41-42 (1914)). \"The\r\nrule does not provide an order of admissibility, such that evidence of artificial\r\nboundaries is admissible only if there is no evidence of natural boundaries.\" Id.\r\n\"The facts of a case may therefore require that an inferior means of location be\r\npreferred over a higher means of location.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThe rule does not provide an order of admissibility; thus, the fact that Coker used\r\nartificial monuments to challenge the accuracy of the Tyler Plat does not render his\r\ntestimony incompetent or inadmissible. We reject the Moores' challenges to Coker\r\nand McAuley's testimony and the Coker Plat. See Madden v. Cox, 284 S.C. 574,\r\n583, 328 S.E.2d 108, 114 (Ct. App. 1985) (appellate court cannot judge the weight\r\nor credibility of expert testimony on appeal); Hibernian Soc'y v. Thomas, 282 S.C.\r\n465, 470, 319 S.E.2d 339, 342 (Ct. App. 1984) (appellate court has no power to\r\nweigh conflicting evidence in a law case). We believe there is evidence in the\r\nrecord to support the trial court's decision.\r\n\nWhile the Moores raise many other evidentiary arguments, these arguments relate\r\nto the weight the trial court assigned to the Respondents' witnesses and exhibits.\r\nWe believe it's clear the trial court weighed the conflicting expert testimony and\r\nfound the Coker and McAuley's testimony as well as the Coker Plat to be more\r\ncredible. There is ample evidence in the record regarding both experts' methods of\r\nsurveying the properties and determining the boundaries. Further, the parties were\r\nable to present all the relevant plats for the properties at issue. Again, while the\r\nMoores may disagree with the weight the trial court accorded the Respondents'\r\nexhibits and witnesses' testimony, we find there is reasonable evidence to support\r\nthe trial court's findings. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court.\r\n\r\n   II.   Directed Verdict\r\n\r\nThe Moores maintain the trial court erred in denying their motion for a directed\r\nverdict on the issue of Respondents' standing. We find this issue unpreserved.\r\n\r\nDespite the Moores' assertions, neither a motion for a directed verdict or judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) on the basis of the Respondents' standing is in\r\nthe record on appeal. See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406,\r\n422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (finding that an issue must be raised to and ruled\r\nupon by the lower court to be preserved for appellate review); see also In re\r\nMcCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 92-93, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001) (only issues raised in\r\na directed verdict motion can properly be raised in a JNOV motion). \"The record\r\nmust show that the issue was raised in the trial court.\" Solley v. Navy Fed. Credit\r\nUnion, Inc., 397 S.C. 192, 213, 723 S.E.2d 597, 608 (Ct. App. 2012) (citing Zaman\r\nv. S.C. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 305 S.C. 281, 285, 408 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991);\r\nReid v. Kelly, 274 S.C. 171, 174, 262 S.E.2d 24, 26 (1980)). \"[T]he appellant has\r\nthe burden of providing an adequate record on appeal.\" Id. at 214, 723 S.E.2d at\r\n608 (citing Harkins v. Greenville Cnty., 340 S.C. 606, 616, 533 S.E.2d 886, 891\r\n(2000)); see also Rule 210(h), SCACR (\"Except as provided by Rule 212 and Rule\r\n208(b)(1)(C) and (2), the appellate court will not consider any fact which does not\r\nappear in the Record on Appeal.\").\r\n\r\nThere is no motion for a directed verdict or JNOV in the record on appeal.\r\nMoreover, there is no objection to Cotton or Ancrum's testimony. Because the\r\nMoores did not meet their burden of providing an adequate record on appeal, we\r\nfind this issue unpreserved.\r\n\n   III.   Hearsay\r\n\r\nThe Moores contend the court allowed impermissible hearsay testimony during\r\nJohnson's testimony regarding: (1) the Moores purportedly moving a survey stake\r\nand ejecting people from the property and (2) the contents of another attorney's\r\nfile, which included a letter. We find that even if this testimony was hearsay, the\r\nMoores failed to prove any prejudice stemming from its admission.\r\n\r\nThere was testimony from Johnson, Cotton, and Coker regarding the Moores\r\nquestioning their presence on the property and then removing them from the\r\nproperty, all without contemporaneous objections. See Burke v. AnMed Health,\r\n393 S.C. 48, 55, 710 S.E.2d 84, 87 (Ct. App. 2011) (finding a contemporaneous\r\nobjection is typically required to preserve issues for appellate review). Johnson\r\nalso spoke of the removal of survey markers by Moore without a contemporaneous\r\nobjection. The Moores only objection occurred when Johnson was questioned\r\nabout Frances Cantwell's file and letters contained within that file. Respondents\r\nasked, \"In this Frances Cantwell file there were letters to Mr. Hanley that said that\r\nwhen he tried to go out on his property he had been chased off by guns?\" Johnson\r\nresponded that the letters indicated Hanley had been chased off the property by\r\nMoore with guns. The Moores objected on the basis of hearsay but were overruled\r\nby the trial court. We do not believe the Moores suffered any prejudice from the\r\nadmission of the testimony. See Starkey v. Bell, 281 S.C. 308, 315-16, 315 S.E.2d\r\n153, 157 (Ct. App. 1984) (though testimony may constitute inadmissible hearsay\r\nevidence, no prejudice is shown when it merely corroborates other evidence\r\nadmitted in the case).\r\n\r\nFurther undermining the Moores' claim of prejudice is the fact that the court did\r\nnot rely on the alleged hearsay to determine the pertinent issue at trial, the\r\nboundary dispute. We find the trial court thoroughly explained its basis for\r\ndetermining the boundary, and there is reasonable evidence in the record consisting\r\nof numerous plats and expert testimony to support its decision. Additionally, the\r\nMoores fail to establish prejudice stemming from the trial court's injunction. The\r\nMoores were determined to have no ownership rights in the Danley property, and\r\ntherefore, they are not prejudiced by the trial court enjoining them from entering or\r\ninterfering with the property. Thus, even if the trial court erred in admitting the\r\nalleged hearsay, we find it was harmless error. See Roche v. Young Bros., Inc., of\r\nFlorence, 332 S.C. 75, 85-86, 504 S.E.2d 311, 316 (1998) (finding the admission\r\nand rejection of testimony is largely within the trial court's discretion, \"the exercise\r\nof which will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion or the\r\ncommission of a legal error that results in prejudice for appellant\") (citing Baber v.\r\n\nGreenville Cnty., 327 S.C. 31, 41, 488 S.E.2d 314, 319 (1997)). Accordingly, we\r\naffirm the trial court.\r\n\r\n   IV.    Findings of Fact Not Supported by the Evidence\r\n\r\nThe Moores contend the following findings of fact were not supported by\r\ntestimony in the record: (1) no remnant of the old wagon road exists today; (2) the\r\ntwo and one-half acre parcel sale to Richardson and the sale of the boot occurred at\r\nthe same time; (3) Cotton was born and raised on the Danley property and\r\nremained on the property until a young adult; (4) no wagon road existed on their\r\ngrandfather's property during Cotton's and Ancrum's lifetime; and (5) there was no\r\nseparate conveyance of the two and one-half acre parcel or the boot into Moore's\r\npredecessor in title. We find that even if any of these statements were in error, the\r\nerror was harmless.\r\n\r\n   1. Old Wagon Road\r\n\r\nThe trial court stated \"[n]o remnant of the road exists today,\" in reference to the old\r\nwagon road. The Moores introduced the Tyler Plat that showed the old wagon\r\nroad drawn in a location that would place it under the power line maintenance\r\nroad. On the Tyler Plat, there is a road titled \"old public road to Ladson,\" and then\r\nit states, \"remnants under power lines.\" Tyler testified he knew where parts of the\r\nold wagon road remain, \"because portions of it, the remnants of it are underneath\r\nthe power lines that are along the northern boundary of the Danley property and\r\nstill being used today as a service road by South Carolina Electric and Gas to\r\nservice their poles on that side.\" Tyler stated he used the Knight Plat as a reference\r\nin preparing the Tyler Plat.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to Tyler's testimony, Respondents introduced testimony stating the old\r\nwagon road was taken when the Highway Department widened and paved Old\r\nLadson Road in 1951. Furthermore, it was stated that the location of the old\r\nwagon road at the point it crossed the railroad tracks did not correspond to the\r\nlocation of the old wagon road depicted in the Tyler Plat.\r\n\r\nThe trial court stated that while the Knight Plat depicted the old wagon road\r\nrunning \"across the northern boundary of [the] Danley property before turning\r\nnorth across the railroad tracks and continuing on to the town of Ladson,\" that plat\r\ndid not contain \"measurements showing the location or width\" of the road. The\r\ntrial court based its decision that no wagon road existed today on Cotton's and\r\nAncrum's testimony that no road existed on the northern boundary of their\r\n\ngrandfather's property after the Old Ladson Road was constructed in the early\r\n1940's, and on Highway Department drawings. Ultimately, the trial court chose to\r\ngive more weight to the Respondents' experts and testimony, and we find there is\r\nreasonable evidence to support the trial court's decision.\r\n\r\n   2. Two and one-half acres and the boot\r\n\r\nThe trial court found Danley conveyed the two and one-half acre parcel to\r\nRichardson at the same time he conveyed the boot to Central, on February 29,\r\n1912. After reviewing the exhibits in the record, it appears that on May 2, 1910,\r\nDanley executed the deed to Richardson. However, the deed was not recorded\r\nuntil February 24, 1912. On February 29, 1912, Danley executed the deed to\r\nCentral. While it is not clearly legible, the deed regarding Central appears to have\r\nbeen recorded on March 6, 2012.\r\n\r\nWe find that despite these discrepancies, the date of the two deeds' conveyances\r\ndid not affect the trial court's decision. The trial court noted Central conveyed the\r\ntwo and one-half acre Richardson property and the boot as part of the five hundred\r\nand thirty-six acre conveyance to Union which the O'Hear Plat depicts. The trial\r\ncourt agrees that eventually, Elgie was conveyed both the boot and the two and\r\none-half acres as part of Lot No. 13. Any mistaken dates by the trial court\r\nregarding the deed conveyances did not affect the substantive outcome. Thus, we\r\naffirm the trial court.\r\n\r\n   3. Cotton and Ancrum\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondents concede Cotton did not testify she was born on the Danley property,\r\nbut point out she did live on the property at times during her childhood. Under\r\nthese facts, we believe whether Cotton was born on the Danley property is\r\ninsignificant, and any mistake by the trial court was harmless. As to Cotton and\r\nAncrum's memory of the old wagon road, they did testify regarding their\r\nknowledge of its existence. The Moores merely disagree with the weight the trial\r\ncourt gave their testimony. See Madden v. Cox, 284 S.C. 574, 583, 328 S.E.2d\r\n108, 114 (Ct. App. 1985) (appellate court cannot judge the weight or credibility of\r\ntestimony on appeal). Accordingly, we affirm the trial court.\r\n\n   4. Confrontation Involving Larry Moore\r\n\r\nRespondents concede the use of \"confrontation\" may be too strong in its\r\nimplication. However, there is testimony that one of the Moores approached\r\nJohnson and Cotton on separate occasions questioning who they were and asking\r\nthem to leave the property. Despite the word usage, we find the trial court did not\r\nbase its decision on whether there was a confrontation or merely a conversation\r\nbetween the parties. We find there was reasonable evidence in the record to\r\nsupport the trial court's finding of interaction between the parties. Thus, we affirm\r\nthe trial court.\r\n\r\n   V.     Abuse of Discretion and Bias in Favor of Respondents\r\n\r\nWhile the Moores list many of their appellate arguments as the basis for this court\r\nto find that the trial court was biased in favor of Respondents, we find this issue is\r\nnot preserved for our review.\r\n\r\nThe record is devoid of any motion by the Moores for recusal; if they felt the trial\r\ncourt was exhibiting bias, a motion would have been the proper procedure by\r\nwhich to preserve this argument on appeal. See Butler v. Sea Pines Plantation Co.,\r\n282 S.C. 113, 122-123, 317 S.E.2d 464, 470 (Ct. App. 1984) (stating that\r\n\"[g]enerally, where bias and prejudice of a trial judge is claimed, the issue must be\r\nraised when the facts first become known and, in any event, before the matter is\r\nsubmitted for decision\"); see also Burke, 393 S.C. at 55, 710 S.E.2d at 87 (finding\r\na contemporaneous objection is typically required to preserve issues for appellate\r\nreview).\r\n\r\nWhile this rule is flexible in a situation where \"the tone and tenor of the trial\r\njudge's remarks are such that any objection would have been futile,\" we do not\r\nbelieve the record supports such a conclusion here. State v. Thomason, 355 S.C.\r\n278, 288-89, 584 S.E.2d 143, 148 (Ct. App. 2003). After reading through the\r\nrecord on appeal, it appears both sides were allowed to present their arguments and\r\nthe trial court's determination of the boundary lines was based on reasonable\r\nevidence presented at the trial. Thus, we find the Moores did not preserve this\r\nissue for our review.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court.\r\n\nAFFIRMED. \n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS AND THOMAS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5030","title":"Wyndham Enterprises v.

Zier, of Zier Law Firm, LLC, of North\r\n            Augusta, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY, J.: Wyndham Enterprises, LLC and Rodney Wyndham (Appellants)\r\nappeal the circuit court's affirmation of The City of North Augusta Board of\r\nZoning Appeals' (the BZA) denial of Appellants' special exception request to sell\r\nfireworks. Appellants argue the BZA acted outside the scope of its authority, and\r\n\nits decision was arbitrary, capricious, and violated Appellants' right to equal\r\nprotection. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn September 1, 2009, Appellants purchased a 0.91 acre parcel of land (the\r\nproperty) in the City of North Augusta (the City). The property is located in Aiken\r\nCounty (the County) off Exit 1 of I-20 near the Georgia and South Carolina border.\r\nAppellants intended to build a 5,000 square foot structure on the property to house\r\na Halloween Express retail store which would sell costumes, decorations, and\r\nnovelty items. The property was zoned General Commercial under the North\r\nAugusta Development Code (the Code). Pursuant to the Code, the sale of\r\nfireworks is designated as a special exception use in General Commercial zoning\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nOn September 23, 2009, Appellants submitted an application to the BZA\r\nrequesting a special exception to sell fireworks on the property. In an October 30,\r\n2009 memorandum, Skip Grkovic, the City's Director of the Department of\r\nEconomic and Community Development (DECD), recommended the BZA approve\r\nthe special exception request subject to certain conditions which Appellant agreed\r\nto meet. In its minor site plan, the DECD stated Appellants' application met the\r\ndevelopment and zoning standards of the Code for a retail sales use in a General\r\nCommercial District. However, the DECD noted the sale of fireworks must be\r\napproved as a special exception by the BZA.\r\n\r\nOn November 5, 2009, the BZA held a public hearing on Appellants' request for a\r\nspecial exception. At the hearing, Mr. Wyndham testified the business would\r\noperate as the Halloween Express store for approximately twelve weeks per year\r\nand a fireworks retail store from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Mr. Wyndham\r\nindicated the fireworks store would not necessarily be open every day during the\r\nperiod of time the business was not operating as the Halloween Express. Also at\r\nthe hearing, fourteen residents of nearby residential neighborhoods testified against\r\nthe special exception. Residents' concerns included increased traffic, decreased\r\nproperty values, and a negative image of the community due to multiple fireworks\r\nretailers in the same area.1\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n1An existing fireworks store is located adjacent to the property. While this\r\nexisting store is located within City limits, it was permitted and approved for\r\ndevelopment before the land was annexed by the City from the County. A second\r\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the BZA unanimously voted to deny Appellants'\r\nspecial exception request. Pursuant to section 18.4.5.4.3(b) of the Code, the BZA\r\nmust evaluate permits for special exceptions on the basis of the following criteria:\r\n\r\n       1. That the special exception complies with all applicable development \n\r\n          standards contained elsewhere in this Chapter and with the policies \n\r\n          contained in the Comprehensive Plan. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18) \n\r\n\r\n       2. That the special exception will be in substantial harmony with the area in\r\n          which it is to be located.\r\n\r\n       3. That the special exception will not discourage or negate the use of \n\r\n          surrounding property for use(s) permitted by right. \n\r\n\r\nPursuant to the minutes of the November 5, 2009 BZA meeting, the BZA\r\ndetermined the special exception did not comply with the second and third criteria.\r\nThe BZA found the special exception was \"not in harmony with nearby residential\r\ndevelopments\" and would have \"a detrimental impact on existing and proposed\r\nresidential development in the area.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Appellants appealed the BZA's decision to the circuit court, arguing\r\nthe BZA's decision was arbitrary and capricious, a violation of the Equal Protection\r\nClause, and a contravention of statutory law. A hearing was held before the circuit\r\ncourt on May 26, 2010. In a July 1, 2010 order, the circuit court affirmed the\r\nBZA's denial of Appellants' special exception request. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the findings of fact by the Board shall be treated in the same manner as\r\nfindings of fact by a jury, and the court may not take additional evidence. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 6-29-840(A) (Supp. 2011). \"In reviewing the questions presented by\r\nthe appeal, the court shall determine only whether the decision of the Board is\r\ncorrect as a matter of law.\" Austin v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 362 S.C. 29, 33, 606\r\nS.E.2d 209, 211 (Ct. App. 2004). Furthermore, \"[a] court will refrain from\r\nsubstituting its judgment for that of the reviewing body, even if it disagrees with\r\nthe decision.\" Restaurant Row Assocs. v. Horry Cnty., 335 S.C. 209, 216, 516\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nfireworks store is located nearby, but is located in the County and not within the\r\nCity limits.\r\n\nS.E.2d 442, 446 (1999). \"However, a decision of a municipal zoning board will be\r\noverturned if it is arbitrary, capricious, has no reasonable relation to a lawful\r\npurpose, or if the board has abused its discretion.\" Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nArbitrary and Capricious\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in affirming the BZA's decision to deny\r\nAppellants' special exception request because the BZA's decision was arbitrary and\r\ncapricious. We agree.\r\n\r\nPursuant to section 18.4.5.4.3(b) of the Code, the BZA must evaluate permits for\r\nspecial exceptions on the basis of the following criteria:\r\n\r\n   1. That the special exception complies with all applicable development \n\r\n      standards contained elsewhere in this Chapter and with the policies \n\r\n      contained in the Comprehensive Plan. (Rev. 12-1-08; Ord. 2008-18) \n\r\n\r\n   2. That the special exception will be in substantial harmony with the area in\r\n      which it is to be located.\r\n\r\n   3. That the special exception will not discourage or negate the use of \n\r\n      surrounding property for use(s) permitted by right. \n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the BZA, \"[i]n making quasi-judicial decisions, . . . must ascertain\r\nthe existence of facts, investigate the facts, hold hearings, weigh evidence and\r\ndraw conclusions from them, as a basis for official action, and exercise discretion\r\nof judicial nature.\" North Augusta Development Code § 5.1.4.5(a). Decisions of\r\nthe BZA must be supported by \"competent, substantial, and material evidence.\" Id.\r\n\r\nHere, the BZA determined the special exception did not comply with the second\r\nand third criteria. Although the hearing transcript indicates the BZA voted to deny\r\nthe special exception request based on the third criterion, the minutes of the\r\nmeeting state the BZA found both the second and third criteria were not satisfied.\r\nThe minutes normally constitute the BZA's final findings. S.C. Code Ann. § 6-29-\r\n800(F) (\"All final decisions and orders of the board must be in writing and be\r\npermanently filed in the office of the board as a public record. All findings of fact\r\nand conclusions of law must be separately stated in final decisions or orders of the\r\nboard which must be delivered to parties of interest by certified mail.\"). But the\r\n\ntranscript can constitute the final findings if the minutes are found invalid. See\r\nVulcan Materials Co. v. Greenville County Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 342 S.C. 480,\r\n493-94, 536 S.E.2d 892, 899 (Ct. App. 2000). Here, the circuit court considered\r\nthe minutes to constitute the BZA's findings, and those findings included a denial\r\nbased upon the second and third criteria.\r\n\r\nAppellants contend the BZA's decision to deny their special exception was based\r\nsolely on opinion and conjecture. Appellants point out the memorandum prepared\r\nby the DECD, which recommended the BZA grant the special exception, explained\r\nthat DECD staff discussed the proposed fireworks use with the City's traffic\r\nconsultant and determined the proposed use would not generate a significant\r\namount of traffic. Respondents contend the BZA's decision was supported by the\r\nevidence, complied with the Code's requirements for granting a special exception,\r\nand was neither arbitrary nor capricious. Respondents argue the residents' sworn\r\ntestimony regarding the detrimental change in character to the neighborhood by the\r\nproliferation of fireworks stores, the decreased property values of the residential\r\nhomes in the area, and the negative impact on future residential growth was ample\r\nevidence to the support the BZA's decision.\r\n\r\nWe find the BZA's decision was arbitrary and capricious. Regarding the third\r\ncriterion, the BZA determined the special exception would not discourage or\r\nnegate the use of the commercially zoned property immediately surrounding the\r\nproperty, but would have a detrimental impact on existing and proposed residential\r\ndevelopment. At the hearing, residents testified as to their concerns regarding the\r\nproposed fireworks business. These concerns included an increase in traffic, a\r\ndecline in property values, and a detrimental impact on the character of the\r\nsurrounding area. The testimony proffered was based on speculation and opinion.\r\nAlthough property owners can generally testify as to the value of and damage to\r\ntheir own property, here only one of numerous witnesses addressed the special\r\nexception's effect on property value. Moreover, the property owner did not testify\r\nabout his specific parcel but rather testified broadly about the undesired fireworks\r\nstore's possible effect on the neighborhood's home values as a whole. This\r\ntestimony was not competent to support the denial of the special exception.\r\nCompare Olson v. South Carolina Dept. of Health & Entl. Control, 379 S.C. 57,\r\n67, 663 S.E.2d 497, 502-03 (Ct. App. 2008) (affirming an administrative law\r\ncourt's finding that the effect on the value of adjacent landowners' property\r\nwarranted the denial of a dock permit because those adjacent landowners testified\r\nthe desired permit would diminish the value of their respective properties); Myrtle\r\nBeach Farms Co. v. Hirsch, 304 S.C. 94, 96-97, 401 S.E.2d 196, 198 (Ct. App.\r\n1991) (reversing the denial of an injunction based upon a restrictive covenant and\r\n\nstating \"Myrtle Beach Farms based its decision to withhold approval mainly on its\r\nopinion, which it was competent to make as the owner of the surrounding\r\nproperty, that the use of the subject property as a site for a helicopter ride service\r\nwould have an adverse impact on the future marketability or desirability of the\r\nsurrounding property\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, none of the residents properly explained why Appellants' business\r\nwould cause a decrease in property values when one fireworks store is located\r\nacross the street from the property and another store is located nearby. The\r\nresidents' testimony also failed to relate how their concerns about a fireworks\r\nbusiness would be different from their concerns regarding commercial enterprises\r\nwhich would be allowed as a matter of right without the need to seek a special\r\nexception. No competent testimony was presented differentiating the effect of a\r\nfireworks store on property values from the effect of a fast food restaurant or\r\nconvenience store on property values. Both of these types of business would be\r\nentitled to open in the same commercial location as a matter of right.\r\n\r\nRegarding the residents' traffic concerns, we note that although there was\r\ntestimony that residents felt the fireworks business would increase traffic, they\r\nfailed to offer any competent evidence to support their opinions. See Bannum, Inc.\r\nv. City of Columbia, 335 S.C. 202, 206, 516 S.E.2d 439, 441 (1999) (reversing a\r\nzoning board's denial of a special exception permit and holding that although\r\nneighboring residents testified they felt a proposed halfway house would increase\r\ntraffic, there was no factual evidence presented to support that allegation).\r\nMultiple neighborhood residents provided accounts of problems exiting and\r\nentering the neighborhood at the location of the proposed fireworks business.\r\nHowever, this testimony failed to establish how adding the fireworks store would\r\nincrease traffic problems in any way but a conjectural manner. Additionally, the\r\nCity's own traffic consultant determined the proposed fireworks business would\r\nnot generate a significant amount of traffic.\r\n\r\nAs to the second criterion, the BZA determined the special exception was not in\r\nsubstantial harmony with the surrounding area. The record reflects the property is\r\nlocated within a commercial district near another fireworks business, a Circle K\r\nconvenience store, and a Waffle House. Although the BZA determined the\r\nproposed fireworks business was in substantial harmony with these commercial\r\nuses, the BZA found the fireworks business was not in substantial harmony with\r\nnearby residential developments. We find the BZA's decision to give deference to\r\nresidential neighborhoods outside the commercial zoning district in which the\r\nbusiness would be located was arbitrary and capricious. Furthermore, as stated\r\n\nabove, the record is void of any factual evidence to support the testimony that this\r\nparticular fireworks business would have a detrimental impact on the character of\r\nthe surrounding area.\r\n\r\nThus, because the BZA's decision was not supported by competent, substantial,\r\nand material evidence, and was based on opinion and speculation testimony, we\r\nreverse the circuit court's decision to affirm the BZA.\r\n\r\nRemaining Issues\r\n\r\nAppellants also argue the circuit court erred in affirming the BZA because the\r\nBZA acted outside the scope of its authority and its decision violated Appellants'\r\nright to equal protection. Based upon our decision to reverse the circuit court as to\r\nAppellants' first issue on appeal, we need not address these issues. See Futch v.\r\nMcAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598\r\n(1999) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when\r\ndisposition of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit court's decision is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5031","title":"State v.

He argues the trial court erred in instructing the jury it\r\ncould infer malice from the use of a deadly weapon. We affirm.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\nDeon Cannick was shot in the neck at close range. The bullet exited through his\r\nback, leaving his spinal cord exposed. He was instantly paralyzed, but survived.\r\nThere was no evidence the shooting was unintentional.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the shooting, Price and Lucius Simuel went to the apartment Deon\r\nshared with his brother, Deverol. The men asked Deon if he wanted to buy some\r\ndrugs. When Deon declined, they asked him to go get Deverol so they could see if\r\nhe wanted to make a purchase. Deon went upstairs and told Deverol the men\r\nwanted to see him. Deverol walked downstairs and outside to speak with Price and\r\nSimuel. Price offered to sell him pills and cocaine. When Deverol said \"no,\" the\r\nmen forced him back into the apartment and pulled out guns. They asked him,\r\n\"where is the iron at?\", which Deverol understood to mean, \"where are the guns?\"1\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Deon was upstairs playing a video game. His dog got out of the room,\r\nand he chased after her. When he caught the dog on the stairs, he looked up and\r\nsaw Price pointing a gun at him from below. He also saw that Simuel had a gun\r\naimed at Deverol's chest. Deon put his hands up and said, \"please don't shoot me.\r\nYou can have anything you want.\" Price and Simuel instructed Deon to come to\r\nthem. With his hands still up, Deon began walking towards them. Price ran up the\r\nstairs, moved his gun to the left side of Deon's neck, and shot him. Deon tumbled\r\ndown the stairs. As Deon lay bleeding at the foot of the staircase, Price and Simuel\r\nagain asked, \"where's the iron at?\" and then ran away. Deverol went outside to\r\nlook for Price and Simuel's car, and he was shot in his hand and abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Urban Dictionary defines \"iron\" as \"[a] gat, peice, heat, or any kind of handgun.\"\r\nSee Iron, Urban Dictionary (Apr. 13, 2004),\r\nhttp://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=iron. Time Magazine rated\r\nUrban Dictionary as one of its \"50 Best Websites\" in 2008, the year Price shot\r\nDeon, and described it as follows: \"To stay hip, visit Urban Dictionary, which has\r\nmillions of user-submitted words and definitions. Visitors can vote on the best\r\nentries . . . .\" Anita Hamilton, Urban Dictionary - 50 Best Websites 2008, Time\r\n(Jun. 17, 2008),\r\nhttp://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1809858_1809955_18115\r\n27,00.html. On the date of publication of this opinion, the cited definition had 164\r\n\"up\" votes and 48 \"down\" votes. \"Peice,\" according to Urban Dictionary, is not a\r\nmisspelling. However, that entry has more down votes than up.\r\n\nPrice was indicted and tried for ABWIK, first degree burglary, possession of a\r\nfirearm during the commission of a violent crime, and unlawful possession of a\r\nfirearm under section 16-23-30(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011). In its\r\njury charge, the trial court instructed the jury that malice was an element of\r\nABWIK and that \"malice may be inferred from the conduct of a person if that\r\nconduct shows a total disregard for human life. Inferred malice may arise when\r\nthe deed is done with a deadly weapon.\" The court also charged ABHAN as a\r\nlesser-included offense. During deliberations, the jury asked the court for a\r\n\"summary of the conditions for ABWIK.\" The trial court recharged the jury on\r\nABWIK and ABHAN, including the instruction that malice may be inferred from\r\nthe use of a deadly weapon. The jury found Price guilty of all charges, and the\r\ncourt sentenced him to life without the possibility of parole on both the ABWIK\r\nand burglary convictions.2 Price appeals only the conviction for ABWIK.\r\n\r\n      II.    Charge on Inferring Malice from Use of a Deadly Weapon\r\n\r\nPrice argues the trial court erred in instructing the jury that malice could be\r\ninferred from the use of a deadly weapon. See State v. Belcher, 385 S.C. 597, 685\r\nS.E.2d 802 (2009).\r\n\r\n             A.     Issue Preservation\r\n\r\nThe State claims this issue is not preserved because Price did not object to the\r\ninstruction in the charge conference or when the court initially charged the jury,\r\nbut only after the court recharged the jury. The State argues Price was required to\r\nobject before the jury began deliberating, and by failing to do so, he waived any\r\nobjection to the charge. See Rule 20(b), SCRCrimP (\"[T]he parties shall be given\r\nthe opportunity to object to the giving or failure to give an instruction before the\r\njury retires, but out of the hearing of the jury. . . . Failure to object in accordance\r\nwith this rule shall constitute a waiver of objection.\").3 Price argues, however, that\r\n\r\n2 The trial court sentenced Price to life for ABWIK pursuant to section 17-25-45 of\r\nthe South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011) because Price had prior convictions from\r\nGeorgia for armed robbery and burglary in the first degree.\r\n3 The State makes the interesting argument that it is not possible for a trial court to\r\ncorrect an erroneously given charge that malice may be inferred from the use of a\r\ndeadly weapon. The State points out that even under Belcher, malice may be\r\ninferred from the use of a deadly weapon. See Belcher, 385 S.C. at 612 n.9, 685\r\n\nthe jury's question on the \"conditions of ABWIK\" demonstrates its deliberations\r\nwere controlled by the recharge, not the initial charge. By objecting to the\r\ninstruction that actually affected the jury's decision, Price argues, he preserved the\r\nissue. We recognize there is a substantial question as to whether Price preserved\r\nthis issue for appeal. However, we choose to address the merits of the issue. Cf.\r\nAtl. Coast Builders & Contractors, LLC v. Lewis, Op. No. 27044 (S.C. Sup. Ct.\r\nfiled May 16, 2012) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 17 at 15, 21) (stating \"we . . . resolve\r\nthe issue on preservation grounds when it clearly is unpreserved\").\r\n\r\n             B.     The Inferred Malice Charge\r\n\r\nWhether a trial court will be reversed for instructing the jury that malice may be\r\ninferred from the use of a deadly weapon depends on whether the jury was\r\npresented with evidence that, if the jury believed it, would reduce, mitigate,\r\nexcuse, or justify the offense. Belcher, 385 S.C. at 610, 685 S.E.2d at 809 (holding\r\n\"the 'use of a deadly weapon' implied malice instruction has no place in a[n] . . .\r\nassault and battery with intent to kill[] prosecution where evidence is presented\r\nthat would reduce, mitigate, excuse or justify the . . . assault and battery with intent\r\nto kill\"). We agree with the trial court that there was no evidence of self-defense or\r\nanything else which could excuse or justify ABWIK. We disagree, however, with\r\nthe court's conclusion that there was evidence of an absence of malice, which\r\nwould reduce or mitigate the offense. In deciding to give the ABHAN charge, the\r\ncourt stated:[S]ome of the testimony has indicated, indirectly though\r\n             it might be, that this was something perhaps other than\r\n             just a knocking down the door and going in there and\r\n             shooting up everybody. And so there may be something\r\n             there that is sufficient to indicate the absence of malice in\r\n             this particular case.\r\n\r\nS.E.2d at 810 n.9 (\"[W]e [do not] restrict the State from arguing to the jury for a\r\nfinding of malice from the use of a deadly weapon . . . . 'Do jurors need the court's\r\npermission to infer something? The answer is, of course not.'\" (citation omitted)).\r\nBelcher simply prohibits the trial court from telling that to the jury under the\r\ncircumstances described in the opinion. Because the inference is permitted, the\r\ntrial court has no way of correcting itself when it improperly gives the charge, as a\r\ncorrective statement about the charge may give the jury the incorrect impression it\r\nis not allowed to draw the inference.\r\n\nWe find no such evidence in the record. Our review of the record reveals no\r\nevidence that could reduce, mitigate, excuse, or justify this crime.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Price points to testimony indicating that Deon and Deverol were drug-\r\ndealing gang members and that Deon's shooting may have been part of a drug deal\r\ngone wrong. We disagree that these facts would reduce, mitigate, excuse, or\r\njustify the crime. It is undisputed that someone shot Deon in the neck, causing him\r\nserious injury. The shooter raised the gun, pointed it at Deon, approached him, and\r\nshot him at close range as he stood with his hands up. There was no evidence to\r\nthe contrary. There may have been conflicting evidence as to who did these things,\r\nbut it is not possible to interpret the evidence to support any conclusion other than\r\nthat the person who shot Deon committed ABWIK. Therefore, if the jury believed\r\nPrice is the person who shot Deon, Price is necessarily guilty of ABWIK. See\r\nState v. Coleman, 342 S.C. 172, 177, 536 S.E.2d 387, 389-90 (Ct. App. 2000)\r\n(affirming trial court's decision to not charge ABHAN as lesser-included offense of\r\nABWIK, where \"Coleman's manner in using the weapon—pointing the gun at\r\nVictim and then deliberately raising the gun to aim at Victim's head just before he\r\nfired—could have only been reasonably calculated to kill or cause great bodily\r\nharm to Victim. Moreover, the resulting wound was near-fatal.\" (footnote\r\nomitted)).\r\n\r\nBelcher does not prohibit the trial court from instructing the jury that it may infer\r\nmalice from the use of a deadly weapon where the only jury question created by\r\nthe evidence is whether the defendant is the person who committed ABWIK. See\r\nBelcher, 385 S.C. at 612, 685 S.E.2d at 810 (stating \"the permissive inference\r\ncharge concerning the use of a deadly weapon remains a correct statement of the\r\nlaw where the only issue presented to the jury is whether the defendant has\r\ncommitted . . . assault and battery with intent to kill\"). On the facts of this case, we\r\nfind no error.\r\n\r\nPrice's ABWIK conviction is AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., concurs in result only.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., dissents.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., dissenting:\r\n\nBecause I believe the issue raised on appeal is properly preserved and the trial\r\ncourt committed reversible error in charging the jury that malice could be inferred\r\nfrom the use of a deadly weapon under the facts of this case, I respectfully dissent.\r\nI disagree with the majority's conclusion that the only jury question created by the\r\nevidence is whether the defendant is the person who committed assault and battery\r\nwith intent to kill (ABWIK). Rather, I would find there is evidence that would\r\nreduce or mitigate the alleged ABWIK, such that the charge on inferred malice\r\nfrom the use of a deadly weapon was reversible error.\r\n\r\nDemetrius Price was convicted of first degree burglary, ABWIK, possession of a\r\nweapon during the commission of a violent crime, and possession of a handgun by\r\na prohibited person. The trial court sentenced Price to life without the possibility\r\nof parole on both the burglary and ABWIK charges, and five years each on the\r\nweapon charges. Price appeals only his conviction and sentence for ABWIK,\r\nasserting the trial court committed reversible error in charging the jury that malice\r\ncould be inferred when the deed was done with a deadly weapon, because evidence\r\nwas presented that would reduce the ABWIK charge to assault and battery of a\r\nhigh and aggravated nature (ABHAN). I would reverse Price's ABWIK\r\nconviction, and remand for a new trial on this charge.4\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nPrice was tried for and convicted of the above charges along with his co-defendant,\r\nLucius Simuel. The charges stem from an incident which resulted in severe\r\ninjuries to two brothers, the younger being left paralyzed. The State's theory was\r\nthat Price and Simuel intended to rob the drug-dealing brothers, but shot them\r\ninstead. The record reveals the following:\r\n\r\nDuring the day on July 28, 2008, eighteen year old Deon Cannick and his older\r\nbrother, Deverol Cannick,5 were shot at the apartment the brothers shared with\r\ntheir two brothers, Malik Campbell and Marcus Campbell, and with Deverol's\r\ngirlfriend, Sharita Willingham. According to Deon, he was in his upstairs\r\napartment when he received a phone call from his friend, Martin Guzman. He\r\n\r\n4 It should be noted that our legislature has abolished the common-law offense of\r\nABWIK for offenses occurring on or after June 2, 2010. S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-\r\n620 (Supp. 2011).\r\n5 Deverol also uses the name Devin Cannick, and goes by the nickname \"Reese\" as\r\nwell.\r\n\nwent downstairs to talk to Martin and Jesse Reese, who wanted a $5 bag of\r\nmarijuana. After Deon returned with the marijuana, Martin and Jesse informed\r\nDeon that two men were looking for him. Deon noticed two men walking up to\r\nhim, recognizing one of the men as Lucius Simuel, who was the uncle of his ex-\r\ngirlfriend, Tiah Frazier. The men asked Deon if he wanted some drugs, and when\r\nhe replied he did not, they asked him to go get his brother, Deverol. Deon went\r\nupstairs and told Deverol that Tiah's uncle was down there looking for him, and\r\nDeverol then went downstairs. Deon remained upstairs playing video games until\r\nSharita opened a door, letting one of their pit bulls out of a room. When the dog\r\nstarted running downstairs, Deon ran after her and grabbed her harness. As Deon\r\nlooked up, he saw two men with guns, one of the men pointing his gun at Deon.\r\nDeon did not know the person pointing the gun at him, but recognized him as the\r\nsame man who had accompanied Simuel that day. The men instructed Deon to\r\ncome to them. Deon put his hands in the air and started walking toward them, and\r\nthe man then waived the gun to the left of Deon's neck and shot Deon. Deon rolled\r\nto the bottom of the stairs, where he saw Simuel and Price, along with his brother.\r\nDeverol exclaimed, \"you shot my brother,\" at which point Simuel and Price asked,\r\n\"where's the iron at?\" Deon understood this to mean they were asking about guns.\r\nDeon thought the men wanted to go upstairs, but they turned and ran outside\r\ninstead because the dog was still on the steps. Deverol ran outside, after which\r\nDeon heard the sounds of gunshots, and Deverol then ran back inside bleeding.\r\nDeon stated he never gave any money or marijuana to the people who came in his\r\nhome, and to his knowledge, they did not take anything.\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Deon admitted that he was a marijuana dealer at the time of\r\nthe incident, he and Deverol were both members of a gang, and that Deverol was\r\nalso a drug dealer who sold drugs besides marijuana, including cocaine, hydrocone\r\nand ecstasy pills. Deon further acknowledged that he had a conversation with\r\nSimuel previously concerning the purchase of ecstasy pills involving his brother,\r\nthat Deverol had asked about buying the pills from Simuel, and Deon had asked\r\nSimuel for the pills on behalf of Deverol. When Simuel came to his door that day,\r\nSimuel asked Deon if he wanted to buy marijuana, ecstasy pills, and cocaine.\r\nDeon reiterated that the men had said \"where the iron at,\" and denied they asked,\r\n\"any more iron, any more iron up there?\" He initially acknowledged that he told\r\none of the detectives the men said, \"any more iron, any more iron up there,\" but\r\ntestified they actually asked \"where's the iron at?\" He later testified the detective\r\nmight have made a mistake in writing up the interview.\r\n\nDeverol testified that on the day of the incident, there was a knock at the door and\r\nhis brother then told him that Tiah's uncle was at the door. Deverol went\r\ndownstairs and opened the door and shut it behind him. He saw Tiah's uncle,\r\nSimuel, and another man. Simuel pointed to Price and told Deverol that this was\r\nthe guy Simuel had told him about, but Deverol did not know what Simuel was\r\ntalking about. Price asked Deverol if he wanted to buy any pills, and Deverol said\r\nhe did not. The man then pulled out a bag of what appeared to be cocaine and\r\nasked Deverol if he wanted some of that, which Deverol again declined. Deverol\r\nsaw two bags being pulled out, and he was then pushed back toward the door\r\ninside his apartment. Both men had guns, but Deverol denied that he had a gun on\r\nhim at that time. Once they had pushed Deverol back into the house, the men said\r\n\"'where is the iron at,' meaning, where are the guns.\" Deon had run downstairs\r\nonce he heard the commotion, and grabbed the dog by her collar as she ran past\r\nhim. Before Deverol knew it, Price reached up and shot Deon. Deon fell down the\r\nstairs, and Deverol ran around inside the home a little while, going up the stairs,\r\nbefore going outside to try to look for the men's car. Once outside, he saw the men\r\narguing, at which point he dropped to the ground. Both men had a gun. Deverol\r\nwas shot in the hand and, after that, the men shot him in his side. Deverol admitted\r\nhe was selling drugs while living at the apartment, including cocaine, marijuana\r\nand pills, and these drugs were in his apartment at the time of the incident. He also\r\nadmitted to owning guns, but denied having them on his person at the time he went\r\nto answer the door.\r\n\r\nSharita Willingham testified she was in the apartment living room on the day in\r\nquestion when there was a knock at the door, and Deverol and Deon went\r\ndownstairs to see who was there. She let her dog out of a room, and the dog ended\r\nup running downstairs. Sharita stated she looked over the bannister to where Deon\r\nand Deverol stood, observed Simuel holding a long gun and trying to force open\r\nthe door, and saw Deverol attempting to close the door. Simuel pushed the door\r\nopen and entered the apartment. When Sharita ran to find her phone, she heard a\r\ngunshot, and then heard two more shots. Sharita testified there were two people at\r\nthe door other than Deverol. Sharita agreed that in her statement to law\r\nenforcement she indicated that \"the guy outpowered Deverol and they began to\r\nargue.\"\r\n\r\nInvestigation of the matter lead authorities to Price and Simuel. Simuel eventually\r\nturned himself in to the authorities and gave statements to them. The State\r\nintroduced Simuel's redacted statements into evidence. In the first statement,\r\nSimuel told authorities he went to Deon and Deverol's house and he was not\r\n\nexpecting anyone to get shot. He stated he was \"being greedy and wanted money,\"\r\nand that he had set the whole thing up and would have to deal with the\r\nconsequences. Simuel stated he had been to Deon's home before, smoking a joint\r\nand having a conversation with Deon's brother. Deon's brother asked Simuel about\r\ngetting some pills. On the morning of the shooting, Simuel received a call from his\r\nnephew advising Simuel that \"he was looking for some pills.\" Simuel went to\r\nDeon's house, where he saw \"a white kid and a Mexican standing outside of Deon's\r\nhouse and thought this was strange as no one ever is just hanging out in front of\r\ntheir house.\" Simuel saw Deon outside with them, and Deon was acting strangely.\r\nDeon went inside to get his brother. Deon's brother then came out, and a few\r\nminutes later Deon came out with a gun, \"stating where is it at.\" Simuel said\r\n\"the Mexican\" then pulled a gun. Simuel heard a shot and saw Deon go down.\r\nSimuel started running and heard another three gunshots. Simuel stated he was\r\nafraid because of the large amount of pills in the car. Thereafter, Simuel called his\r\nniece, Tiah, and told her that her boyfriend tried to set him up. Simuel denied\r\nshooting anyone. On another occasion, Simuel told authorities that he was\r\ninvolved in the incident, but denied having a gun or shooting anyone. He stated he\r\ntold the authorities eighty percent of the truth in the first interview, and after\r\nleading them that far, they would have to do the rest of the work. Finally, Simuel\r\nmet with authorities one more time and gave another statement. He denied\r\nbreaking into anyone's residence or having a weapon while at Deon's, but indicated\r\nhe originally lied about the incident. When asked how he became involved,\r\nSimuel stated he received a call from his niece, Tiah Frazier, and his nephew, Chris\r\nBattle, concerning pills for Tiah's boyfriend, Deon.\r\n\r\nThe investigator who interviewed Deon acknowledged that Deon, in describing the\r\nincident, stated he heard the two men ask, \"any more iron, any more iron up there.\"\r\nDeon also told the investigator that he talked about getting some pills so he could\r\nmake some extra money weeks before the shooting, and when referring to the\r\nincident, Deon stated he \"was overcome with a crazy feeling\" as the two men\r\napproached. The investigator agreed he found no evidence of forced entry to the\r\ndoor, such as a dent or the door being broken. The same investigator interviewed\r\nMalik on the day of the shooting, at which time Malik stated that he went to the top\r\nof the stairs during the incident to see what was wrong, and observed two subjects\r\nat the bottom of the stairs fighting with his brothers. Malik also testified, admitting\r\nhe talked to the investigator, but denied telling him he saw his brothers fighting\r\nwith the suspects, explaining he must have been misunderstood on that point. A\r\nsearch of the victims' apartment led to the discovery of four guns in the bedrooms.\r\nAlso found throughout the apartment were various suspected drugs, including\r\n\ncocaine and marijuana, as well as marijuana plants and two bundles of\r\nhydrocodone tablets.\r\n\r\nTiah Frazier testified that on July 28, 2008, Deon called her and asked to talk to\r\nher uncle, but Simuel was not there, so Tiah gave Deon a contact number for\r\nSimuel. Deon indicated to Tiah in the call that he wanted to buy some pills. Later\r\nin the day, on the afternoon of the shooting, Simuel called Tiah and told her that\r\nDeon had tried to rob him and that Deon had been shot. Chris Battle, Tiah's\r\nbrother and Simuel's nephew, also testified to events he recalled from July 28.\r\nChris stated that Deon called Tiah that day and asked if Simuel was home and\r\nasked for a number, which Tiah gave Deon. Deon asked for the number because\r\nhe wanted some pills. They called Simuel and told him Deon was asking for some\r\npills. Hours went by before they heard from their uncle, and when he finally\r\ncalled, he told them that \"the deal went bad\" and Deon and his brother were shot.\r\n\r\nAfter both the State and Defenses rested, the trial court noted it was inclined to\r\ncharge ABHAN to the jury, noting there was \"some evidence in the record from\r\nwhich some of the testimony has indicated, indirectly though it may be, that this\r\nwas something perhaps other than just a knocking down the door and going in\r\nthere and shooting up everybody,\" such that there may be evidence \"sufficient to\r\nindicate the absence of malice in this particular case.\" Counsel for both Price and\r\nSimuel requested the court give an ABHAN charge, and the solicitor stated he had\r\nno objection, because the jury could find there was an absence of malice from the\r\nevidence. The two defense attorneys also requested a self-defense charge, arguing\r\nthere was evidence from Simuel's statement that Deon pulled a gun out and asked\r\n\"where is it at,\" and there was evidence concerning the deal having \"gone bad,\"\r\nand the victims were trying to rob the defendants. The trial court declined,\r\nhowever, to charge self-defense.\r\n\r\nThe court thereafter charged ABWIK and ABHAN to the jury. During the court's\r\ncharge on ABWIK, it instructed the jury that malice could be inferred from the use\r\nof a deadly weapon. Neither counsel for the defendants objected to the court's\r\ninference charge at that time. After deliberations began, however, the jury\r\nrequested a written summary \"of the conditions of ABWIK.\" In response, the trial\r\ncourt instructed the jury on virtually the same law it had previously charged on\r\nboth ABWIK and ABHAN, including a charge on malice and that malice could be\r\ninferred from the use of a deadly weapon. In particular, the trial court recharged\r\nthe jury as follows:\r\n\n             Malice can be inferred from conduct which shows a total\r\n             disregard for human life. Inferred malice can arise when\r\n             the deed is done with a deadly weapon. A deadly\r\n             weapon obviously is any article or instrument which is\r\n             likely to cause death or bodily harm.\r\n\r\n             And so if facts are proven beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n             sufficient to raise an inference of malice to your\r\n             satisfaction, that's an inference that is simply an\r\n             evidentiary fact. And you can consider that, along with\r\n             all of the other evidence in the case, and give it the\r\n             weight that you think it should receive.\r\n\r\nThis time, trial counsel for Price excepted to the court's charge based upon the\r\ncourt's inclusion of language that was excluded by State v. Belcher, 385 S.C. 597,\r\n685 S.E.2d 802 (2009). The trial court noted its instruction did include the\r\nlanguage excluded by Belcher. It concluded, however, that Belcher was\r\ninapplicable, because Belcher was limited to situations involving self-defense and\r\n\"things of that nature,\" and the court had found self-defense did not lie in this case.\r\nPrice was thereafter convicted as charged.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the trial court committed reversible error, based on Belcher, by instructing\r\nthe jury during its charge on the law of ABWIK that \"inferred malice may arise\r\nwhen the deed is done with a deadly weapon,\" where evidence was presented that\r\nwould reduce the ABWIK to ABHAN, and the court instructed the jury on\r\nABHAN.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nPrice contends the trial court committed reversible error by instructing the jury that\r\nmalice could be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon, as there was evidence\r\npresented that would reduce the ABWIK charge to ABHAN, and the inferred\r\nmalice charge was thus erroneous pursuant to Belcher. Price further argues the\r\ntrial court erred in finding Belcher is limited to cases in which a defendant is\r\nentitled to a self-defense instruction. I agree.\r\n\nFirst, I disagree with the State's contention that the issue is not properly preserved,\r\nor that Price somehow waived it because he failed to object to the inferred malice\r\ninstruction when initially charged by the trial court. \"In order for an issue to be\r\npreserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the\r\ntrial judge.\" State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 693 (2003). As\r\nrecently noted by our supreme court, \"[i]ssue preservation rules are designed to\r\ngive the trial court a fair opportunity to rule on the issues, and thus provide us with\r\na platform for meaningful appellate review.\" Atl. Coast Builders & Contractors,\r\nLLC v. Lewis, Op. No 27044 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 16, 2012) (Shearouse Adv.\r\nSh. No. 17 at 15) (quoting Queen's Grant II Horizontal Prop. Regime v.\r\nGreenwood Dev. Corp., 368 S.C. 342, 373, 628 S.E.2d 902, 919 (Ct. App. 2006)).\r\nHere, Price specifically excepted to the inferred malice charge immediately after\r\nthe trial judge recharged the jury the allegedly offending language. The trial judge\r\nproceeded to address Price's concerns pursuant to Belcher, ultimately finding\r\nBelcher inapplicable. Thus, the matter was clearly raised to the trial judge, and the\r\ntrial judge clearly ruled upon the matter. Additionally, I find Price did not waive\r\nany objection to the charge by failing to object when the matter was initially\r\ncharged by the court. This matter involves two separate charges. While Price may\r\nvery well have waived his objection to the initial inferred malice charge by failing\r\nto contemporaneously object, he specifically objected to the recharge and did not\r\nwaive his subsequent objection to this allegedly erroneous instruction. Hence, a\r\ncontemporaneous objection was made to the second charge that malice could be\r\ninferred from the use of a deadly weapon, and this issue is therefore preserved as to\r\nthe second charge. Neither do I find Price's failure to object after the initial charge\r\nand prior to the jury initially retiring for deliberations constitutes waiver of his\r\nright to subsequently challenge the recharge pursuant to Rule 20(b), SCRCrimP.\r\nThis rule provides in part as follows: \"Notwithstanding any request for legal\r\ninstructions, the parties shall be given the opportunity to object to the giving or\r\nfailure to give an instruction before the jury retires. . . . Failure to object in\r\naccordance with this rule shall constitute a waiver of objection.\" Rule 20(b),\r\nSCRCrimP. Our supreme court has specifically declined to give a strident\r\ninterpretation to Rule 20(b), instead finding an objection to a jury charge preserved\r\nunder the rule where an on-the-record ruling was made after an opportunity for\r\ndiscussion, in spite of the fact that the objection to the charge was not renewed\r\nafter the conclusion of the charge. See State v. Johnson, 333 S.C. 62, 64 n.1, 508\r\nS.E.2d 29, 30 n.1 (1998) (holding, where appellant's request to charge was denied\r\non-the-record after an opportunity for discussion, Rule 20(b), SCRCrimP did not\r\nrequire appellant to renew his request at the conclusion of the charge in order to\r\npreserve the issue on appeal). Further, I disagree with the State's assertion that\r\n\nPrice could have suffered no prejudice from the alleged error because the charge\r\nhad previously been presented to the jury without objection. Once Price objected\r\nto the recharge, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to correct any error in his\r\ncharge. Thus, assuming the charge was erroneous pursuant to Belcher and\r\nrequired correction, it cannot be said Price suffered no prejudice when the trial\r\njudge failed to give a corrected charge.6\r\n\r\nOn the merits, I believe the trial court erred in charging the jury that malice could\r\nbe inferred from the use of a deadly weapon under the facts of this case. The trial\r\ncourt is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina, and\r\nthe law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.\r\nState v. Brandt, 393 S.C. 526, 549, 713 S.E.2d 591, 603 (2011). \"An instruction\r\nshould not be given unless justified by the evidence.\" State v. Cooney, 320 S.C.\r\n107, 110, 463 S.E.2d 597, 599 (1995).\r\n\r\nIn Belcher, decided one month prior to the trial in the case at hand, our supreme\r\ncourt addressed and overruled a long line of cases pertaining to jury instructions\r\nregarding the permissive inference of malice from the use of a deadly weapon.\r\nThere, the court noted, while it had long been the sanctioned practice for trial\r\ncourts in South Carolina to charge juries in any murder prosecution that the jury\r\nmay infer malice from the use of a deadly weapon, after \"carefully scrutinize[ing]\r\nthe historical antecedents to this permissive inference,\" from there forward, a jury\r\ncharge instructing that malice may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon is\r\n\r\n6 I disagree with the State's contention that it is not possible for a trial court to\r\ncorrect an erroneously given charge that malice may be inferred from the use of a\r\ndeadly weapon because a corrective statement about the charge may give the jury\r\nthe incorrect impression it is not allowed to draw the inference. This would be true\r\neven in situations where an initial objection is made to the charge, and Belcher\r\nmakes clear that such an erroneous charge will not be tolerated. The court could\r\nhave instructed the jury to disregard its previous charge concerning inferred malice\r\nand the use of a deadly weapon and then properly charged the jury, or perhaps\r\nfashioned some other instruction to correct the matter. Because the trial court\r\noverruled the objection to the charge, no corrective charge possibilities were ever\r\nbroached. At any rate, regardless of whether the objection was raised at the initial\r\ncharge or the subsequent charge, I do not believe that an erroneous jury charge\r\nunder Belcher is excusable simply because the trial court would have had difficulty\r\ncorrecting the charge, or that such difficulty would result in a determination that a\r\ndefendant in such a situation would not have been prejudiced.\r\n\nno longer good law in South Carolina where evidence is presented that would\r\nreduce, mitigate, excuse or justify the homicide. 385 S.C. at 600, 685 S.E.2d at\r\n803-04. Unable to harmonize more recent jurisprudence (which sanctioned an\r\ninference of malice based upon the use of a deadly weapon charge regardless of\r\nwhether evidence was presented that would reduce, mitigate, excuse or justify a\r\nkilling) with earlier writings of the court that placed a qualification on such a\r\ncharge, our supreme court found that malice includes the absence of justification,\r\nexcuse and mitigation such that, when viewing malice in light of these component\r\nparts, \"inferring malice from the use of a deadly weapon is indeed only a 'half-\r\ntruth.'\" Id. at 609-10, 685 S.E.2d at 808. Thus, \"[t]he absence of justification,\r\nexcuse or mitigation cannot be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon standing\r\nalone,\" and \"[o]ther facts and evidence (or the absence of other facts and evidence)\r\nare required for the fulfillment of these component parts.\" Id. at 610, 685 S.E.2d at\r\n808-09. Based upon this analysis, the court in Belcher stated:\r\n\r\n             Under our policy-making role in the common law, we\r\n             hold that the \"use of a deadly weapon\" implied malice\r\n             instruction has no place in a murder (or assault and\r\n             battery with intent to kill) prosecution where evidence is\r\n             presented that would reduce, mitigate, excuse or justify\r\n             the killing (or the alleged assault and battery with intent\r\n             to kill).\r\n\r\nId. at 610, 685 S.E.2d at 809. The court further particularly noted in a footnote to\r\nthis holding that, because the crime of assault and battery with intent to kill\r\nrequires malice, its holding in this regard also applied to ABWIK. Id. at 610 n.6,\r\n685 S.E.2d at 809 n.6.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the court in Belcher recognized the trial court had charged the jury\r\nthat the killing had to be unlawful and that there \"ha[d] to be a deliberate and\r\nintentional design to use or employ or handle a deadly weapon so as to endanger\r\nthe life of another without just cause or excuse.\" Nevertheless, it determined that\r\n\"instructing a jury that 'malice may be inferred by the use of a deadly weapon' is\r\nconfusing and prejudicial where evidence is presented that would reduce, mitigate,\r\nexcuse or justify the homicide,\" noting that \"[a] jury charge is no place for\r\npurposeful ambiguity.\" Id. at 611, 685 S.E.2d at 809.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Belcher court agreed that erroneous jury instructions are subject to a\r\nharmless error analysis, and acknowledged that in many murder prosecutions there\r\n\nmay be overwhelming evidence of malice apart from the use of a deadly weapon.\r\nHowever, the court held the error in charging that malice could be inferred by the\r\nuse of a deadly weapon could not be considered harmless beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt in that case, as evidence of self-defense was presented, thereby highlighting\r\nthe prejudice resulting from the charge. Id. at 611-12, 685 S.E.2d at 809-10.\r\n\r\nThe Belcher court therefore concluded, \"where evidence is presented that would\r\nreduce, mitigate, excuse or justify a homicide (or assault and battery with intent to\r\nkill) caused by the use of a deadly weapon, juries shall not be charged that malice\r\nmay be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon.\" Id. at 612, 685 S.E.2d at 810.\r\n\r\nTurning to the case at hand, I find the trial court committed reversible error in\r\ncharging the jury that malice could be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon.\r\nFirst, contrary to the trial court's position, Belcher is not limited to situations\r\ninvolving self-defense such that the mandates of Belcher are not transgressed if\r\nself-defense does not lie. Belcher makes absolutely clear that where evidence is\r\npresented that would reduce, mitigate, excuse or justify the killing or the alleged\r\nassault and battery with intent to kill, a jury charge that malice may be inferred\r\nfrom the use of a deadly weapon is improper. Here, evidence was presented from\r\nwhich the jury could conclude Price and his co-defendant did not simply shoot\r\nDeon and Deverol while carrying out their plan to rob the two brothers.\r\nSpecifically, evidence was presented that Deon had previously discussed with\r\nSimuel obtaining ecstasy pills from Simuel on Deverol's behalf, and Simuel had\r\nappeared at Deon and Deverol's home that day with Price after Deon had attempted\r\nto contact Simuel that day for the purpose of obtaining the pills. Significantly,\r\nevidence was presented that Deon pulled a gun out as Price and Simuel attempted\r\nto conduct a drug transaction with Deverol and stated \"where is it at,\" thereby\r\nshowing Price and Simuel may have, in fact, been the target of an armed robbery.\r\nAdditionally, there is evidence Deon, in describing the incident to an investigator,\r\nstated he heard the two men ask if there was \"any more iron up there,\" referring to\r\nguns, and indicating the victims may have, in fact, previously pulled a gun on the\r\ndefendants while in the downstairs area. The investigator testified he found no\r\nevidence of forced entry to the apartment door, and Malik told the investigator that\r\nhe observed two subjects at the bottom of the stairs fighting with his brothers\r\nduring the incident. Also, Simuel's niece, Tiah, testified that on the day of the\r\nshooting, Deon had called her and asked to talk to her uncle, indicating he wanted\r\nto talk to Simuel about buying some pills, and later that day Simuel called Tiah and\r\ntold her that Deon had tried to rob him. Chris Battle, Simuel's nephew,\r\ncorroborated that Deon called Tiah that day and asked for Simuel because he\r\n\nwanted some pills, Tiah and Chris called Simuel and told him Deon was asking for\r\nsome pills, and hours later, Simuel called and told them that \"the deal went bad.\"7\r\nThus, evidence was presented that would reduce or mitigate the alleged ABWIK,\r\nmaking the charge on inferred malice from the use of a deadly weapon improper. I\r\nfind very telling the fact that the trial court recognized the presence of such\r\nevidence, specifically noting the appropriateness of a charge on ABHAN based on\r\nevidence that the incident was something \"other than just a knocking down the\r\ndoor and going in there and shooting up everybody\" but, rather, was \"sufficient to\r\nindicate the absence of malice in this particular case.\" As well, the State\r\nspecifically conceded during the trial that the jury could find there was an absence\r\nof malice from the evidence.\r\n\r\nThe supreme court in Belcher made a thorough analysis in its well-reasoned\r\nopinion, clearly elucidating, based upon historical antecedents, that because malice\r\nincludes the absence of justification, excuse and mitigation, an inference of malice\r\nbased upon the use of a deadly weapon charge is no longer proper where evidence\r\nis presented that would reduce, mitigate, excuse or justify the killing or the alleged\r\nABWIK. Because I believe there was evidence presented that would, at a\r\nminimum, reduce or mitigate the alleged ABWIK, thereby showing a possible\r\nabsence of malice, I believe the trial court erred in charging that jury that malice\r\ncould be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon.\r\n\r\nSecond, the fact that the trial court may have charged the jury that the unlawful act\r\nhad to be an intentional one and had to be done without just cause or excuse did\r\nnot cure the error in charging that malice could be inferred from the use of a deadly\r\nweapon in this instance. See id. at 611, 685 S.E.2d at 809 (holding, though the trial\r\ncourt had charged the jury that the killing had to be unlawful and that there had to\r\nbe a deliberate and intentional design to use or employ or handle a deadly weapon\r\n\r\n7 I do not agree with the majority's position that the only conflicting evidence was\r\nas to who shot Deon, and the only possible interpretation of the evidence was that\r\nthe person who shot Deon committed ABWIK. Though Deon did testify the\r\nshooter pointed a gun at him and, while Deon's hands were in the air, the man\r\nwaived the gun to the left of Deon's neck and shot him, there was evidence\r\npresented from which the jury could conclude that the defendants were actually\r\ntargeted for a robbery by the victims, and the defendants managed to gain the\r\nupper hand in the situation. In other words, given the conflicting evidence on why\r\nthe shooting came about, the jury was free to believe or disbelieve Deon's version\r\nof the events.\r\n\nso as to endanger the life of another without just cause or excuse, instructing the\r\njury that malice could be inferred by the use of a deadly weapon was nonetheless\r\nconfusing and prejudicial where evidence was presented that would reduce,\r\nmitigate, excuse or justify the homicide).\r\n\r\nLastly, I disagree with the State's contention that any error in charging the jury on\r\ninferred malice was harmless in light of overwhelming evidence of malice\r\npresented at trial. Here, as noted, evidence was presented that would reduce or\r\nmitigate the ABWIK charge. In fact, both the trial court and the State\r\nacknowledged at trial that there was evidence presented from which the jury could\r\ndetermine there was an absence of malice. I cannot conclude, beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt, that the trial court's error in charging that malice could be inferred from the\r\nuse of a deadly weapon did not contribute to the jury's guilty verdict on the charge\r\nof ABWIK. Accordingly, I cannot find that the trial court's error in so charging the\r\njury was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See id. at 611-12, 685 S.E.2d at\r\n809-10 (noting, though the court agreed that erroneous jury instructions are subject\r\nto a harmless error analysis and acknowledged that in many murder prosecutions\r\nthere may be overwhelming evidence of malice apart from the use of a deadly\r\nweapon, the error in charging that malice could be inferred by the use of a deadly\r\nweapon could not be considered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in that case,\r\nas evidence of self-defense was presented, thereby highlighting the prejudice\r\nresulting from the charge); see also State v. Tapp, Op. No. 27129 (S.C. Sup. Ct.\r\nfiled June 6, 2012) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 19 at 28) (holding error is considered\r\nharmless when it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial, and\r\nnoting our jurisprudence requires the appellate court, when engaging in a harmless\r\nerror analysis, not to question whether the State proved its case beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt, but to question whether beyond a reasonable doubt the trial error\r\ndid not contribute to the guilty verdict).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI would find the issue was raised and ruled upon below such that it is preserved for\r\nour review, and Price did not waive consideration of the issue when he objected to\r\nonly the recharge. Further, pursuant to Belcher, I would hold the trial court erred\r\nin charging the jury that malice could be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon\r\nunder the facts of this case, and such error was not harmless. Accordingly, I would\r\nreverse and remand Price's ABWIK conviction.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5032","title":"Lewis v. L.B.

Glover, the South Carolina Uninsured Employers'\r\n            Fund, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: LeAndra Lewis worked as a dancer in various \"exotic dance clubs\"\r\nthroughout North and South Carolina. On June 23, 2008, she was shot while\r\n\ndancing at the Boom Boom Room Studio 54 on Two Notch Road in Columbia,\r\nSouth Carolina. The workers' compensation commission held that she was not an\r\nemployee of the club and therefore not entitled to benefits under the Workers'\r\nCompensation Act. We agree.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts and Procedural History\r\n\r\nLewis was nineteen years old and living in Charlotte, North Carolina at the time of\r\nher injury. She danced three or four nights a week at a place called Club Nikki's in\r\nCharlotte. On two or three other nights a week, Lewis travelled around the\r\nCarolinas to dance in other clubs. She typically earned between $250.00 and\r\n$350.00 a night in cash. When the single commissioner asked about her total\r\nincome dancing \"five to six nights a week, fifty weeks,\"1 Lewis responded, \"the\r\nmoney is actually addictive honestly, so you want to strive to get more, you know,\r\nso you work even harder.\" Lewis worked several years in this business before she\r\nwas shot, and she never filed a tax return.2 The clubs where Lewis worked are\r\ncommonly referred to as strip clubs. Lewis's role as a dancer in these clubs is what\r\nmost people would call being a stripper.\r\n\r\nThe night Lewis was shot was the second or third night she danced at the Boom\r\nBoom Room. She had not danced there the night before, and she could not\r\nremember the previous time or times she was there. Lewis presented several\r\nfellow exotic dancers as witnesses to explain that dancers often choose a city and a\r\nclub to dance in on a particular night and travel there uninvited and unannounced.\r\nIn keeping with this practice, Lewis showed up at the Boom Boom Room on this\r\nparticular night, showed her identification to prove she was at least eighteen years\r\nold, and paid the required \"tip-out\" fee in cash to the club. She did not fill out an\r\nemployment application and did not sign an employment agreement. The club\r\ngave her a \"rules sheet,\" she went to the dressing room to put on her outfit, and she\r\ndanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n1Using the numbers testified to by Lewis, which average five and a half nights a\r\nweek for fifty weeks earning $300.00 per night, her annual taxable income would\r\nhave been $82,500.00.\r\n2In response to a follow-up question about filing tax returns, Lewis testified, \"I\r\ndon't have enough money. I want to talk to somebody, but they're just too\r\nexpensive for me to afford.\"\r\n\nAt some point during the night, an altercation broke out in the club. There was\r\ngunfire, and a stray bullet hit Lewis in the abdomen. She suffered serious injuries\r\nto her intestines, liver, pancreas, kidney, and uterus. Surgeons removed one\r\nkidney, and doctors informed her she may never be able to have children due to the\r\ninjuries to her uterus. According to her testimony, extensive scarring from the\r\ngunshot wound left her unemployable as an exotic dancer.\r\n\r\nLewis filed a claim for benefits with the workers' compensation commission.\r\nBecause the club had no insurance, the South Carolina Uninsured Employers' Fund\r\nwas forced to defend. Both the single commissioner and the appellate panel denied\r\nLewis's claim based on the finding that she was not an employee. Her appeal came\r\ndirectly to this court pursuant to section 42-17-60 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(Supp. 2011).\r\n\r\n      II.    The Independent Contractor/Employee Analysis\r\n\r\n\"[T]he determination of whether a claimant is an employee or independent\r\ncontractor focuses on the issue of control, specifically whether the purported\r\nemployer had the right to control the claimant in the performance of [her] work.\"\r\nWilkinson ex rel. Wilkinson v. Palmetto State Transp. Co., 382 S.C. 295, 299, 676\r\nS.E.2d 700, 702 (2009). The test requires us to \"examine[] four factors which\r\nserve as a means of analyzing the work relationship as a whole: (1) direct evidence\r\nof the right or exercise of control; (2) furnishing of equipment; (3) method of\r\npayment; [and] (4) right to fire.\" Id. The question is a jurisdictional one as to\r\nwhich the appellate court \"may take its own view of the preponderance of the facts\r\nupon which jurisdiction is dependent.\" Pikaart v. A & A Taxi, Inc., 393 S.C. 312,\r\n317, 713 S.E.2d 267, 270 (2011). Applying the Wilkinson \"control\" test to the\r\nfacts of this case, we find that Lewis was not an employee of the club.\r\n\r\nLewis claims that the club's managers \"controlled\" her by searching her when she\r\narrived that night, requiring her to pay the \"tip-out\" fee, and directing her to the\r\nmanager's office and then the dressing room. She argues in her brief the club's\r\ncontrol over her is demonstrated by these facts:\r\n\r\n             She danced when the club told her to dance; the club\r\n             selected the music; the club set her hours; the club\r\n             required her to perform on demand; the club required her\r\n             to strive to get V.I.P. dances; the club set her tip-out and\r\n\n             the floor rate for V.I.P. dances; and the club required her\r\n             to bring drinks from the bar.\r\n\r\nShe argues that the club furnished equipment, such as the stage for dancing; poles\r\nto assist the dancers; private rooms for V.I.P. dances; tables, chairs, and couches\r\nfor the customers; and even glasses in which the bartenders poured their drinks. In\r\nher brief, Lewis states, \"The club provided the dancers with cleaning solution,\r\ntowels, and a basket for collecting money while on stage, and the club provided the\r\ndancers with lockers for their belongings.\"\r\n\r\nLewis discounts the method of payment factor on these facts since the club paid\r\nher nothing, but simply took a cut of her tips. As to the right to fire factor, Lewis\r\nargues the club's right to \"fine\" her or refuse her readmission to dance at the club\r\nfor violating club rules weighs in favor of an employment relationship.\r\n\r\nWe compliment Lewis's counsel for this creative presentation, framing questions to\r\nthe witnesses and presenting evidence to the commission in such a fashion as to\r\ncreate the appearance that the facts of this case fit the words of the Wilkinson test.\r\nHowever, we find that none of this supports the argument that Lewis met the test\r\nfor an employment relationship under Wilkinson. Rather, the facts of this case\r\ndemonstrate that Lewis was not an employee, and therefore that she is not entitled\r\nto workers' compensation benefits.\r\n\r\nWe decide this appeal using the test articulated by the supreme court in Wilkinson.\r\nSee Pikaart, 393 S.C. at 318-19, 713 S.E.2d at 270-71 (explaining that Wilkinson\r\nrequires a court to \"evaluate[] the four factors with equal force in both directions to\r\nprovide an even-handed and balanced approach\"); Paschal v. Price, 392 S.C. 128,\r\n133-34, 708 S.E.2d 771, 773-74 (2011) (applying Wilkinson test). As Lewis's\r\ncounsel candidly acknowledged at oral argument, however, this case presents an\r\n\"unorthodox\" situation. Given these unusual facts, we initially stand back from the\r\nWilkinson analysis and note that Lewis was an itinerant artistic performer. Other\r\nthan to perform within the physical limitations of the Boom Boom Room and to\r\ncomply with its basic rules and procedures, most of which simply required her to\r\nobey the law, she did as she pleased. One of her witnesses testified, \"Sometimes\r\nyou just jump up some days and say, 'let's go down here, I think.' Or a rapper\r\nmight be here, you know, that's another reason that girls travel, is a rapper might be\r\nhere or an actor or somebody and you just want to come down here for that.\"\r\nLewis was asked at the hearing before the single commissioner, \"You could go to\r\nten different clubs in ten different days if you wanted to?\" to which she responded,\r\n\n\"Right.\" Lewis was never invited to dance at the Boom Boom Room. She showed\r\nup unannounced, paid the club for the right to dance and receive tips from its\r\ncustomers, and kept almost all the money she received without paying any\r\nemployment taxes. This arrangement left her free to walk out of the club at a\r\nmoment's notice without any employment-related consequences other than to lose\r\nincome. As one of Lewis's witnesses testified, \"You're not free to leave, but you\r\ncan leave. You have to pay to leave.\" These circumstances and others we will\r\ndiscuss weigh heavily against finding an employment relationship.\r\n\r\nFocusing back on the Wilkinson test, we find Lewis was not an employee.\r\n\r\n             1.    The right or exercise of control\r\n\r\nDespite all the circumstances cited by Lewis under which the club required her to\r\nwork, the work she travelled from Charlotte to perform, and the performance the\r\ncustomers of the club paid to see, was that of an exotic dancer. As Lewis states in\r\nher brief, \"The record does not indicate that the club told [her] how to dance.\"3 As\r\ncounsel conceded at oral argument, \"There is not any evidence of the club telling\r\n[her] how specifically to dance\" and, \"While the dance is going on she has\r\ncomplete discretion.\" The extent to which an exotic dancer in the Boom Boom\r\nRoom decides the manner in which she performs her dance to satisfy the club's\r\ncustomers, according to the record in this case, is not subject to any limitation or\r\ncontrol by the club. The \"right or exercise of control\" factor weighs against\r\nfinding an employment relationship.\r\n\r\n             2.    Furnishing of equipment\r\n\r\nThe \"equipment\" Lewis argues the club furnished her is insignificant to the\r\nWilkinson analysis. With respect to furnishing equipment, the club did nothing\r\nmore than allow her onto its premises. There is no practical possibility that an\r\nexotic dancer might bring her own stage, poles, chairs, couches, or bar glasses.\r\nFrom the standpoint of both the Boom Boom Room and its customers, Lewis\r\n\r\n\r\n3 In fairness, Lewis continued the sentence with \"but the record does reflect that the\r\nclub exerted so much control over [her] that if the club had told [her] how to dance,\r\nshe would have been required to follow the club's instructions.\" We find no\r\nevidentiary support for the portion of the sentence quoted in this footnote. Rather,\r\nthe record indicates the club had nothing to say as to how Lewis should dance.\r\n\nbrought her own \"equipment\" for her work. This factor weighs against finding an\r\nemployment relationship.\r\n\r\n             3.    Method of payment\r\n\r\nAs Lewis points out in her brief, \"The club paid Ms. Lewis nothing—zero.\" She\r\ncollected her payment in the form of cash tips from the club's customers. The\r\nclub's only involvement in the customers paying money to the dancers was to keep\r\na large quantity of one dollar bills on hand so that a customer could \"make it rain.\"\r\nThis procedure allowed a customer who was particularly happy with a dancer's\r\nperformance or who wanted to encourage a more enthusiastic performance to pay\r\nthe club $100.00 or more and get the same amount back in one dollar bills. When\r\nthe customer threw the ones in the air, he was said to \"make it rain.\" As Lewis\r\ntestified, however, even in this instance the money comes from the customer.\r\nTherefore, the club did not pay Lewis. Rather, she paid the club for the right to\r\nperform. As she testified, \"they . . . told me to pay my [$70.00] tip-out\" as a\r\ncondition of entering the club. She also paid the club a share of her V.I.P. fees and\r\ntipped the disk jockey and bartender. This factor weighs against finding an\r\nemployment relationship.\r\n\r\n             4.    Right to fire\r\n\r\nLewis argues the club had the right to fire her if she did not comply with its rules.\r\nWe find, however, that the \"rules\" the club imposed on exotic dancers like Lewis\r\ndo not indicate an employment relationship. Any business has a right to impose\r\nconditions on those to whom it pays money for work, regardless of whether the\r\nworker is an independent contractor or an employee. The business's right to\r\nterminate the relationship for a violation of its conditions does not make the worker\r\nan employee. See Wilkinson, 382 S.C. at 304, 676 S.E.2d at 704 (stating \"a right of\r\ntermination, in some form, exists in an independent contractor arrangement\"). In\r\nthis case, the employment \"relationship\" Lewis claims existed was never\r\ncontemplated to last more than one night in the club. Therefore, terminating the\r\nrelationship would involve nothing more than kicking her out of the club and not\r\nallowing her back in on a subsequent night. Lewis was asked by her attorney, \"In\r\nyour own words, explain to the commissioner how their rules and controls dictate\r\nwhat you have to do when you get there and if you don't do what they say, what\r\nhappens.\" She responded:\r\n\n             Well, if you don't do what they say, then you get fined.\r\n             If you don't pay the fine, then you are fired. Or if—it\r\n             depends on to what extreme the—what you did, you\r\n             know. . . . Like if you get caught having sex in the club,\r\n             then you're automatically fired. Like fighting, you're\r\n             automatically fired, can't work back at the club.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions do not distinguish Lewis's relationship with the Boom Boom\r\nRoom from any independent contractor relationship. Any business that pays for\r\nwork to be performed on its premises is free to terminate the relationship for the\r\ntype of conduct Lewis described, even when the work is being performed by an\r\nindependent contractor. The \"rules\" imposed on Lewis are not in the record, and\r\nLewis has cited no significant restriction on her conduct from these rules or\r\notherwise that is not simply a requirement that Lewis obey the law. See 382 S.C.\r\nat 302, 676 S.E.2d at 703 (stating \"requiring a worker to comply with the law is not\r\nevidence of control by the putative employer\"). The \"right to fire\" factor weighs\r\nagainst finding an employment relationship.\r\n\r\n      III.   Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe agree with the workers' compensation commission's finding that Lewis is not\r\nan employee. Thus, the commission correctly concluded it had no jurisdiction to\r\naward benefits. This ruling makes it unnecessary to address the other issues raised\r\non appeal. See Price v. Peachtree Elec. Servs., Inc., 396 S.C. 403, 410, 721 S.E.2d\r\n461, 464 (Ct. App. 2011) (declining to address other issues when \"our\r\ndetermination as to the jurisdiction of the Commission is dispositive of the case\").\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT, J., dissenting: The majority finds the Appellate Panel of the South\r\nCarolina Workers' Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel) was correct in\r\nfinding Lewis was an independent contractor of the Boom Boom Room Studio 54\r\n\n(the Club) in Columbia. However, I would find that Lewis was an employee of the\r\nClub; therefore, I respectfully dissent.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The existence of an employment relationship is a jurisdictional issue for purposes\r\nof workers' compensation benefits and is reviewable under a preponderance of the\r\nevidence standard.\" Shatto v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 394 S.C. 552, 557, 716\r\nS.E.2d 446, 449 (Ct. App. 2011). Because the issue of Lewis's employment status\r\nis jurisdictional, this court makes findings based on its view of the preponderance\r\nof the evidence. See Brayboy v. WorkForce, 383 S.C. 463, 464, 681 S.E.2d 567,\r\n567 (2009) (making its findings based on its view of the preponderance of the\r\nevidence because the issue of Brayboy's employment status was jurisdictional).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Under South Carolina law, the primary consideration in determining whether an\r\nemployer/employee relationship exists is whether the alleged employer has the\r\nright to control the employee in the performance of the work and the manner in\r\nwhich it is done.\" Paschal v. Price, 392 S.C. 128, 132, 708 S.E.2d 771, 773\r\n(2011). \"The test is not the actual control exercised, but whether there exists the\r\nright and authority to control and direct the particular work or undertaking.\"\r\nKilgore Group, Inc. v. S.C. Emp't Sec. Comm'n, 313 S.C. 65, 68, 437 S.E.2d 48, 49\r\n(1993). \"'An independent contractor is one who, exercising an independent\r\nemployment, contracts to do a piece of work according to his own methods,\r\nwithout being subject to the control of his employer except as to the result of his\r\nwork.'\" Bates v. Legette, 239 S.C. 25, 34-35, 121 S.E.2d 289, 293 (1961) (quoting\r\n\r\n4 The Club did not have workers' compensation insurance; therefore, the South\r\nCarolina Uninsured Employer's Fund (the Fund) became involved in the case. The\r\nFund filed an initial brief on appeal; however, it did not file a final brief. Rule\r\n208(a)(4), SCACR, provides that if a respondent does not file an initial brief, this\r\ncourt is permitted to take whatever action the court deems proper. Respondent's\r\nfailure to file a brief alone can justify reversal. See Turner v. Santee Cement\r\nCarriers, Inc., 277 S.C. 91, 96, 282 S.E.2d 858, 860 (1981) (noting that respondent\r\ndid not file a brief with the court and her failure to do so allowed the court to take\r\nsuch action upon the appeal as it deemed proper, and stating this failure alone\r\nwould justify reversal; however, it simply considered it as an additional ground).\r\nDespite the Fund's failure to file a final brief, this court permitted the Fund to\r\nappear and argue the case at oral argument.\r\n\n56 C.J.S. Master and Servant § 3(1)). \"The four principal factors indicating the\r\nright of control are (1) direct evidence of the right to, or exercise of, control; (2)\r\nthe method of payment; (3) the furnishing of equipment; and (4) the right to fire.\"\r\nPaschal, 392 S.C. at 132, 708 S.E.2d at 773. This court evaluates the four factors\r\nwith equal force in both directions. Wilkinson v. Palmetto State Transp. Co., 382\r\nS.C. 295, 300, 676 S.E.2d 700, 702 (2009).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I could not find any South Carolina appellate court cases that have\r\naddressed whether an exotic dancer is classified as an employee or independent\r\ncontractor, other courts in various jurisdictions have analyzed the same or similar\r\narrangements between exotic dancers and clubs and found an employment\r\nrelationship existed. See Club Paradise, Inc. v. Oklahoma Emp't Sec. Comm'n, 213\r\nP.3d 1157, 1161 (Okla. Civ. App. 2008) (finding the exotic dancers were\r\nemployees of Club Paradise based on the club's control over its dancers'\r\nperformance, and noting the workers performed on the club's premises, the club\r\ncould dismiss its workers at any time, and either party could terminate their\r\nrelationship without liability); Yard Bird, Inc. v. Va. Emp't Comm'n, 503 S.E.2d\r\n246, 224-25 (Va. Ct. App. 1998) (finding exotic dancers were employees based on\r\nthe amount of control the Yard Bird had over its dancers, and noting the club\r\nattempted to enforce its rule that dancers not leave the premises between sets,\r\ndancers could choose times they worked, but only in conformity with the club's\r\nschedule, and the club required dancers to comply with liquor control laws and\r\nregulations that governed its licensing status). While these jurisdictions do not\r\napply an identical test to that utilized by the courts in South Carolina for\r\ndetermining whether an employment relationship exists, they are to some degree\r\nsimilar and consider the degree of control the alleged employer exerts over the\r\nworker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case before us, Lewis presented evidence that the Club exercised the right to\r\ncontrol her and the other exotic dancers in the performance of their work. When\r\nhired, Lewis was required to present her identification and sign a form agreeing to\r\ncomply with the Club's rules. The Club provided virtually all of the necessary\r\ntools for the dancers to perform, including towels, lockers, alcohol, music, chairs,\r\ntables, a stage, poles, a \"V.I.P.\" area, and customers. Although dancers could\r\nchoose their own costumes, they could not remove the bottom portion of their\r\ncostume or choose when they performed on stage. The Club set the fees for V.I.P.\r\n\ndances and required the dancers to remit a portion of the fees they collected to the\r\nClub. The Club fined or fired dancers if they missed their turn in the rotation or\r\naltered the V.I.P. dance price. Once the dancers reported to work, the Club fined\r\nor fired them if they left before a certain time. In addition, the Club fined or fired\r\ndancers for failure to comply with the Club's rules. Thus, under the totality of the\r\ncircumstances, I find the Club exercised the sufficient amount of control over\r\nLewis in the performance of her work to establish an employment relationship, and\r\nthe Appellate Panel erred in finding Lewis was an independent contractor.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5033","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nJosh Zoch died from multiple blunt force trauma to his head after being beaten\r\nwith a baseball bat the night of December 12, 2006. Zoch, McDonald, Christopher\r\nWhitehead, and Robert Cannon all worked at the same Sonic Restaurant at one\r\ntime. McDonald and Cannon both gave statements to police admitting their and\r\nWhitehead's involvement in the murder. Cannon told the police they had beaten\r\nZoch to punish him for being a \"snitch.\"1 Whitehead told the police he did not\r\nknow a \"damn thing\" about Zoch's murder.\r\n\r\nMcDonald, Whitehead, and Cannon were tried together as co-defendants in May\r\n2008. None of the three co-defendants testified at trial. The jury found all three\r\nguilty, and the trial court sentenced Cannon and McDonald each to two concurrent\r\nterms of thirty-five years imprisonment for murder and first-degree burglary. The\r\ncourt sentenced Whitehead to two concurrent sentences of life without parole for\r\nmurder and first-degree burglary.2 This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nMcDonald argues the trial court erred in allowing Cannon's written statement into\r\nevidence without adequately redacting the portions of the co-defendant's statement\r\nimplicating McDonald because it denied him his right to confront and cross-\r\nexamine the witness. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which was extended to the\r\nstates by the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees the right of a criminal defendant\r\n\r\n1 Throughout the trial, it was mentioned that Zoch was a police informant who had\r\ncommitted at least one first-degree burglary.\r\n2 The trial court sentenced him to life without parole pursuant to section 17-25-45\r\nof the South Carolina Code because of his 2005 guilty plea to attempted armed\r\nrobbery. S.C. Code Ann. § 17-25-45 (Supp. 2011).\r\n\nto confront witnesses against him, and this includes the right to cross-examine\r\nwitnesses.\" State v. Holder, 382 S.C. 278, 283, 676 S.E.2d 690, 693 (2009); see\r\nU.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV. In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 50-51\r\n(2004), the Supreme Court held that testimonial out-of-court statements are not\r\nadmissible under the Confrontation Clause unless the witness is unavailable and\r\nthe defendant had prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness.\r\n\r\nIn Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 126-137 (1968), the United States\r\nSupreme Court held a non-testifying co-defendant's confession that inculpates\r\nanother defendant is inadmissible at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed\r\nthat the confession can only be used as evidence against the confessor, because of\r\nthe substantial risk that the jury would look to the incriminating extrajudicial\r\nstatements in determining the other's guilt. In Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200,\r\n207-08 (1987), the Supreme Court clarified the rule announced in Bruton is a\r\n\"narrow\" one that applies only when the statement implicates the defendant \"on its\r\nface,\" and the rule does not apply to statements that only become incriminating\r\nwhen linked to other evidence introduced at trial, such as the defendant's own\r\ntestimony. In State v. Evans, 316 S.C. 303, 307, 450 S.E.2d 47, 50 (1994), our\r\nsupreme court held Bruton did not bar a statement that \"on its face\" did not\r\nincriminate Evans even though its incriminating import was certainly inferable\r\nfrom other evidence that was properly admitted against him.\r\n\r\nThe Richardson court also noted Bruton can be complied with by the use of\r\nredaction:   Even more significantly, evidence requiring linkage\r\n             differs from evidence incriminating on its face in the\r\n             practical effects which application of the Bruton\r\n             exception would produce. If limited to facially\r\n             incriminating confessions, Bruton can be complied with\r\n             by redaction – a possibility suggested in that opinion\r\n             itself. If extended to confessions incriminating by\r\n             connection, not only is that not possible, but it is not even\r\n             possible to predict the admissibility of a confession in\r\n             advance of trial.\r\n\r\nRichardson, 481 U.S. at 208-09 (citation omitted); see State v. Page, 378 S.C. 476,\r\n482, 663 S.E.2d 357, 359 (Ct. App. 2008) (stating redaction has come into play as\r\na tool to allow admission of a co-defendant's confession against the confessor in a\r\n\njoint trial because it permits the confession to be used against the non-testifying\r\nconfessor, while avoiding implicating the co-defendant). However, in Gray v.\r\nMaryland, 523 U.S. 185, 192 (1998), the Supreme Court noted the Richardson\r\ndecision limited the scope of Bruton to instances where the reference to the\r\ndefendant was on the face of the statement; therefore, a statement that substituted\r\nblanks and the word 'delete' for the petitioner's proper name falls within the class of\r\nstatements to which Bruton's protections apply. The court explained:\r\n\r\n             Redactions that simply replace a name with an obvious\r\n             blank space or a word such as \"deleted\" or a symbol or\r\n             other similarly obvious indications of alteration,\r\n             however, leave statements that, considered as a class, so\r\n             closely resemble Bruton's unredacted statements that, in\r\n             our view, the law must require the same result.\r\n\r\nId. at 192. Further, this court has held the \"Confrontation Clause is not violated\r\nwhen a defendant's name is redacted but other evidence links the statement's\r\napplication to the defendant, if a proper limiting instruction is given.\" Page, 378\r\nS.C. at 482, 663 S.E.2d at 359.\r\n\r\nAt trial, the State argued replacing the co-defendants' names in Cannon's written\r\nstatement with \"another person\" would resolve any confrontation problem.3\r\nCannon's attorney objected on behalf of all three co-defendants, arguing the limited\r\nredaction would not satisfy Bruton and State v. LaBarge, 275 S.C. 168, 268 S.E.2d\r\n278 (1980), \"because the statement clearly implicates someone else and it's\r\nobviously prejudicial to the people who are sitting right here.\" Further, he stated\r\n\"there's an easier way to do it, which is simply to not put a reference to what\r\nsomeone else did.\" The following colloquy occurred between Cannon's attorney\r\nand the judge:\r\n\r\n             The Court: But that's not the law. . . . We've been over\r\n             this. I mean, I've been over this many times. And the\r\n             courts have said when replacing the offensive language\r\n             with \"the other person,\" \"the other guy\" or \"we\" or \"they\"\r\n             when there's no reference, specific reference to a co-\r\n             defendant, it satisfies Bruton.\r\n\r\n3Following a Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368 (1964), hearing, the judge ruled\r\nCannon's statement was admissible.\r\n\n            Mr. Kendrick: Your Honor, and I understand that. I am\r\n            just arguing my position for this record, is that that [sic]\r\n            does not satisfy Bruton. I know you're ruling I'm wrong,\r\n            but I have to put it on the record.\r\n\r\nThe judge ruled in favor of the State. Counsel renewed their objections when the\r\nState introduced Cannon's statement into evidence.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Cannon stated he and at least two others decided to \"beat [Zoch's] ass\r\nbecause he is a snitch.\" The group arrived at Zoch's house at approximately 11:30\r\np.m. on December 12, 2006, and \"busted\" the side door in, finding Zoch asleep on\r\nthe couch. Cannon's statement, when redacted, read:\r\n\r\n            [W]e went to Sonic. I had on a ski mask . . . We then left\r\n            Sonic and went to the Two Notch Walmart [sic] and\r\n            another person got a ski mask. So we went riding and\r\n            another person said [']you know we need to do something\r\n            with these ski mask[s'], and I ask, and another person ask\r\n            [']like what?'] and another person said [']like beat\r\n            [Zoch's] ass because he's a snitch['] and I told another\r\n            person I didn't think he was a snitch. Another person\r\n            then ask if me and another person wanted to ride and we\r\n            said whatever. . . . That was about 11 pm. . . . We pulled\r\n            up to [Zoch's] about 11:30 pm. . . . Another person went\r\n            to the side door and another person busted it in. . . .\r\n            [Zoch] was asleep on the couch and another person\r\n            yelled [']hey Bitch,['] and when [Zoch] looked up,\r\n            another person hit [Zoch] with a glass lamp. Right after\r\n            that . . . another person drag[ged] him off the couch part\r\n            of the way. Then another person started pressuring\r\n            another person to hit [Zoch] with the bat that was in the\r\n            house and another person then hit [Zoch] in the back of\r\n            [his] head. After that [Zoch] was basicly [sic] crawling\r\n            trying to get up . . . At that time another person kicked\r\n            [Zoch] in the ribs and ask[ed] [Zoch] where the weed\r\n            was and [Zoch] was just grunting. That[s] when another\r\n            person ask[ed] me to check the room and we started\r\n            pulling draws [sic] and another person flipped the\r\n\n            mattress . . . Then [Zoch] went unconscious and I got\r\n            [Zoch] a towel and put it to his head. Another person\r\n            said, [']fuck, we don't have anything['] and pushed the\r\n            Christmas tree over on [Zoch]. Another person then got\r\n            mad again and took the house phone. But before another\r\n            person left, he got some frozen chicken from the freezer\r\n            and put it on [Zoch]'s head to try and stop the bleeding.\r\n            After that we went back out the same way we came in.\r\n\r\nCannon also answered some questions in his statement:\r\n\r\n            Q. Did you[,] another person[,] and another person have\r\n            on gloves?\r\n            A. Yes.\r\n            Q. What kind of gloves?\r\n            A. Purple latex and I had on 2 pair WHT [sic] and purple\r\n            ones on top.\r\n            Q. Where was the bat from that was used to hit [Zoch]?\r\n            A. It was in [Zoch's] house. I just looked over their [sic]\r\n            and another person picked it up.\r\n            Q. What were you[,] another person[,] and another\r\n            person wearing that night?\r\n            A. Black pants and shirts and ski mask.\r\n            Q. What color was the ski mask?\r\n            A. Mine was black and theirs was [sic] black or dark\r\n            blue.\r\n\r\n      The court also gave the jury a limiting instruction:\r\n\r\n            Now, some of the evidence in this case may have been\r\n            admitted solely because of its relationship to the case\r\n            against one of the defendants. This evidence cannot be\r\n            considered in the case of any of the other defendants.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, McDonald argues that given the context of the record, Cannon's written\r\nstatement clearly implicated him as a person involved in the burglary and murder\r\nof Zoch. Therefore, its admission violated his rights under the Confrontation\r\nClause. He argues this case is similar to LaBarge, 275 S.C. 168, 268 S.E.2d 278.\r\nIn LaBarge, the State presented a confession given by his co-defendant that\r\n\nimplicated LaBarge in the crimes and, in accordance with Bruton, the statement\r\nwas redacted in an attempt to exclude all direct references to LaBarge. Id. at 170,\r\n268 S.E.2d at 279-80. Where the name \"LaBarge\" appeared, \"Mister X\" was\r\nsubstituted; however, in light of other testimony, \"Mister X\" pointed directly to\r\nLaBarge. Id. at 170, 268 S.E.2d at 280. Regardless, the court did not specifically\r\nhold the redaction would not have satisfied Bruton, but simply stated, \"It can be\r\nforcefully argued that the method of redacting was ineffective.\" Id. Similarly, in\r\nState v. Holder, 382 S.C. 278, 285-86, 676 S.E.2d 690, 694 (2009), our supreme\r\ncourt found the substitution of Holder's name with the pronoun \"she\" was\r\ninsufficient to obscure her identity because the jury could readily determine the\r\nstatement referred to her as she was the only female defendant. The court held the\r\nredaction was analogous to that in Gray because, despite the redaction, it was\r\napparent the co-defendant was referring to Holder, and the inference was one that\r\ncould be made even without reliance on the other testimony developed at trial. Id.\r\nTherefore, the court found the admission of the redacted statement violated\r\nHolder's rights under the Confrontation Clause because her co-defendant did not\r\ntestify and was not subject to cross-examination. Id. at 286, 676 S.E.2d at 694.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, in United States v. Akinkoye, 185 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir. 1999), the\r\nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals held the defendants were not prejudiced because\r\nthe confessions were retyped to replace the defendants' respective names with the\r\nneutral phrases \"another person\" or \"another individual.\" Also, in United States v.\r\nVogt, 910 F.2d 1184, 1191-92 (4th Cir. 1990), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals\r\nheld that a redacted statement, in which the co-defendant's name was replaced with\r\nthe word \"client,\" did not on its face impermissibly incriminate the co-defendant\r\neven though the incriminating import was inferable from other evidence. The\r\ncourt further stated that even though it may not be easy for a jury to obey the\r\ncautionary instruction, \"'there does not exist the overwhelming probability of their\r\ninability to do so that is the foundation of Bruton's [rule].'\" Id. at 1192 (quoting\r\nRichardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. at 208).\r\n\r\nWe find that the neutral phrase \"another person\" inserted into Cannon's statement\r\navoided any Bruton violation. The redacted statement only implicates the\r\nstatement's maker, and it does not limit the participants to three, which would\r\nimplicate the three defendants on trial. Further, the court gave the jury a limiting\r\ninstruction. Therefore, we find the trial court properly allowed Cannon's redacted\r\nstatement into evidence.\r\n\nMcDonald also argues Cannon's written statement was a violation of Crawford v.\r\nWashington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), because the statement was given during the\r\ncourse of an investigation, and McDonald did not have an opportunity to confront\r\nand cross-examine Cannon.\r\n\r\nCounsel for Cannon argued for all three co-defendants concerning redacting\r\nCannon's written statement to the police. Counsel's argument was based on Bruton\r\nand did not mention Crawford v. Washington. Counsel did not raise a Crawford\r\nviolation until hundreds of pages later in the transcript in regard to an oral\r\nstatement made by Cannon during a polygraph exam. The judge noted this was the\r\nfirst time Crawford was mentioned, and Cannon's previous redacted statement had\r\nalready been admitted. Counsel stated, \"[F]or the record, I'm going to go ahead\r\nand put on the record that the other statements should have been suppressed due to\r\nCrawford, too.\" Because the Crawford issue was not raised when Cannon's written\r\nstatement was redacted and admitted, this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nSee State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (\"A\r\ncontemporaneous objection is required to properly preserve an error for appellate\r\nreview.\"); State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 609, 486 S.E.2d 762, 764 (Ct. App. 1997)\r\n(\"Failure to object when the evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to\r\nobject.\"); Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"It\r\nis axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must\r\nhave been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\nreview.\"); State v. Freiburger, 366 S.C. 125, 134, 620 S.E.2d 737, 741 (2005)\r\n(holding an issue is not preserved for appeal where one ground is raised below and\r\nanother ground is raised on appeal).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, McDonald's convictions for murder and burglary in the first degree\r\nare\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\n\nFEW, C.J., concurring: I concur in the majority opinion insofar as it holds that\r\nthe use of the term \"another person\" satisfied the requirements of Bruton v. United\r\nStates, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). However, I disagree with the majority's treatment of\r\nCrawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004). Crawford relates to the question of\r\nwhether the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation is implicated by a particular\r\nstatement. See State v. Ladner, 373 S.C. 103, 111, 644 S.E.2d 684, 688 (2007)\r\n(recognizing that Crawford held the confrontation clause is implicated if the\r\nstatement is testimonial). The State agrees Cannon's statement is testimonial, and\r\ntherefore McDonald had the right to confront Cannon. In my opinion, therefore,\r\nthe Crawford issue the majority holds is unpreserved was never an issue at all, and\r\nthere is no need to discuss Crawford. The question is properly analyzed under\r\nBruton.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5035","title":"Martin v.

Martin, pro se, of Edisto\r\n            Island, for Respondents/Appellants.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY J.: In this direct appeal, Appellants/Respondents Ann P. Bay and\r\nHarvie Goddin argue the Master-In-Equity (Master) erred in admitting evidence to\r\ninterpret the extent of the easement at issue when the Master had found the\r\n\ncovenant language determining the boundaries of the easement was unambiguous.\r\nFurther, Bay and Goddin contend the Master erred in taking judicial notice of the\r\npropensity of the critical line to migrate and then imposing a setback in excess of\r\nthe setback established by the county. On cross-appeal, the Patricia and David\r\nMartin argue the Master erred in reconsidering his decision to award attorney's\r\nfees. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThe Martins initiated this action on June 9, 2008, seeking a declaration of the\r\nrights of the owners of four lots (Lots A, B, C, and D) to an easement for use of a\r\ngazebo, dock, and boat ramp constructed on Lot C. Specifically, the Martins\r\nsought a declaratory judgment that the covenants in a Declaration of Covenants,\r\nConditions and Restrictions (Covenants) were binding on the owners of Lots\r\nA,B,C, and D and that they hold an easement permitting them full use of an\r\neasement allowing access to the community gazebo, dock, and boat ramp located\r\non Lot C. The easement is shown on a recorded plat and traverses the length of the\r\nproperty line between Lots C and D. While the width of the easement at one end,\r\nwhere it is bounded by a cul de sac, is fifteen feet, as the easement continues\r\ntowards the marsh, it expands to over one hundred feet at the water. The Martins\r\nown Lots B and D, while Lot C is owned by Bay and Lot A is owned by Tony and\r\nDiann Hannon. Goddin is Bay's husband. Before the trial, the parties stipulated\r\nthat the Covenants were binding on all four lots in the subdivision.\r\n\r\nThe grant of the perpetual easement and indemnification agreement was properly\r\nexecuted on May 31, 1996 between the original developer, John L. Gramling, and\r\nthe Martins. The easement's description is as follows:\r\n\r\n            A pedestrian/vehicular easement for ingress and egress\r\n            from Jumbo Lane, across Tract C to the community dock,\r\n            gazebo and boat landing, said route shall be the route\r\n            shown on the plat by David W. Spell, RLS dated January\r\n            31, 1996 a copy of which is attached hereto and\r\n            specifically incorporated herein by reference; said\r\n            easement is for the mutual benefit of the property being\r\n            simultaneously conveyed to David Martin and Patricia F.\r\n            Martin and property of the Grantor as shown on the\r\n            above Plat and is a perpetual non-exclusive, appendant,\r\n            appurtenant easement which shall run with the land and\r\n            is essentially necessary to the enjoyment of the property\r\n\n             conveyed above, and such property of the prior Grantor\r\n             as is shown on the above referred to Plat, and shall be\r\n             transmissible by deed or otherwise upon conveyance or\r\n             transfer of the above conveyed property.\r\n\r\nThe referenced plat shows the easement as fifteen feet wide at its access point from\r\nthe cul de sac on Jumbo Lane joining a triangular shaped area approximately one\r\nhundred and fifty feet from Jumbo Lane. The southern boundary of the easement\r\nis also the boundary between Lots C and D. The Martins testified that when they\r\nacquired the easement, it was their understanding the easement entitled them to\r\naccess the easement by entering from any point along the boundary, including\r\npedestrian access across the property line directly to the dock.\r\n\r\nBay purchased Lot C on October 10, 2003. Title of the property was held by her\r\nalone. In late 2007, a disagreement arose between Bay and the Martins about the\r\nMartins' access to the easement. Bay argued at trial the Martins do not have the\r\nright to cross the easement line at any point, but must access the easement at\r\nJumbo Lane and traverse the easement to the community area. While the walk\r\nfrom the Martins' back porch across the property line between Lot C and D to the\r\ncommunity area is approximately 150 feet, the route Bay suggested creates a\r\ndistance of approximately 400 feet. Patricia testified she suffers from a condition\r\nthat makes it difficult for her to walk. She stated if she could no longer use their\r\nnormal route across the property line, she would have to drive her car and park it in\r\nthe easement while using the community area. Bay stated a car parked in the\r\neasement would create a greater burden than if the Martins used the route crossing\r\nthe property line. However, Bay also stated she wished to build a fence along the\r\nproperty line of Lots C and D, which the Martins argued would interfere with their\r\nright to access the easement.\r\n\r\nThe Master took judicial notice that Lot C, due to its Agricultural Residential\r\n(AGR) zoning, had restrictions placed on it, specifically that a party was prohibited\r\nfrom constructing a fence in the buffer zone defined to be thirty-five feet back\r\nfrom the critical line, pursuant to the Charleston County Zoning and Land\r\nDevelopment Regulations (ZLDR).1 S.C. Code Ann. § 6-29-720 (Rev. 2004 &\r\n\r\n1The ZLDR states these buffer zones are intended to \"provide a natural\r\nvegetated area between the furthermost projection of a structure, parking or\r\ndriveway area, or any other building elements, and all saltwater wetlands,\r\nwaterways and OCRM (saltwater) critical lines.\" ZLDR § 9.7.1(A).\r\n\nSupp. 2011) (\"[T]he governing body of a municipality or county may adopt a\r\nzoning ordinance to help implement the comprehensive plan.\"); ZLDR §\r\n9.7.1(B)(1). The Master also took judicial notice of the fact \"that the [c]ritical\r\n[l]ine is not a permanently fixed line, but tends to move further inland with ocean\r\nlevel rise and/or erosion.\" Further, the Master noted that because of this buffer, it\r\nwould \"not be permissible for Bay to place a fence of a sufficient length to prevent\r\naccess by the Martins by both vehicle and foot along the end of such a fence near\r\nthe marsh.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the extent of the easement, the Master concluded the \"language of the\r\ngrant of easement is not ambiguous.\" The Master found the language of the\r\neasement similar to that in Plott v. Justin Enterprises, 374 S.C. 504, 649 S.E.2d 92\r\n(Ct. App. 2007). Moreover, in addition to the thirty-five foot buffer zone, the court\r\nordered an additional five feet to allow for the acknowledged inland migration of\r\nthe critical line. The Master noted that because Bay and Goddin were prohibited\r\nfrom erecting a fence in the forty feet2 above the critical line, the Martins would be\r\nallowed to access the easement at any point in the unobstructed portion of the\r\nproperty line between Lots C and D at the marsh end. The Master held \"no fence\r\nconstructed by the owner of Lot C may be extended to the edge of the marsh so as\r\nto deny access to the easement by the owners of Lot D.\"\r\n\r\nAlso at issue in the trial stage were Bay and Goddin's violations of the Covenants.\r\nAlleged incidents between Bay and Goddin and the Martins were ongoing from\r\n2006 to 2008. At trial, the Master inquired of the Martins' counsel: \"As I read\r\nthese restrictions they talk as an either or injunctive relief or damages. Do you\r\nagree with that?\" The Martins' counsel answered in the affirmative and stated they\r\nsought injunctive relief, because it was \"[m]uch more important.\" At the trial's\r\nconclusion, the Master stated,\r\n\r\n             But in response to my request about the injunctive relief\r\n             is it looked like a question of damages. I don't know if it\r\n             covered this question of attorney's fees; haven't looked\r\n             that far. I think the prevailing party can get those\r\n             attorney's fees. I'll look that up when the time comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 The forty feet of unobstructed property line consists of the thirty-five foot buffer\r\nzone required by the ZLDR and the additional five feet added to the buffer zone by\r\nthe Master.\r\n\nIn his order, the Master noted the Martins elected the remedy of injunction and not\r\ndamages, and then found Bay and Goddin violated several of the Covenants. Bay\r\nand Goddin were enjoined from any further violations of the Covenants. In\r\naddressing attorney's fees, the Master acknowledged that Paragraph 2 of the\r\nCovenants provided for an award of reasonable attorney's fees to any party\r\nrequired to file an action to enforce the Covenants. The Master awarded attorney's\r\nfees and costs incurred in filing this action to the extent that the fees and costs were\r\nincurred to enforce the Covenants and to establish the above violations of the\r\nCovenants by Bay and Goddin.\r\n\r\nBay and Goddin filed a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the trial court's\r\njudgment on February 26, 2010. At the Rule 59(e) hearing, Bay and Goddin\r\ncontended that because the Master found the description of the easement was\r\nunambiguous, the Master must construe the easement from only the plat and deed\r\nthemselves, and not from any further testimony. The Master responded:\r\n\r\n             There wasn't a movement or a change in the location of\r\n             the easement. There was only a determination as to\r\n             when, where and how they could utilize the easement . . .\r\n             Use of the easement by the Martins and their access\r\n             which had been continuous, that they would walk out of\r\n             their house, across their property line, directly to the\r\n             gazebo and dock rather than walking the half mile route\r\n             or whatever it would take . . . I just don't agree with your\r\n             premise that they could only access it from the entrance\r\n             on Jumbo Lane. I just don't agree with that. And I think\r\n             that that's both the practicality of the situation as well as\r\n             the use that it's been put to for all those years. So the\r\n             easement itself I don't find to be ambiguous; the location\r\n             of the easement. The issue of access to the easement, if\r\n             that's the word we want to use, was what the case was\r\n             tried over and I find that common sense should prevail\r\n             over any literal meaning which, if that's what you're\r\n             getting at, I would find that the access to this easement\r\n             should be anywhere along the line.\r\n\r\nAddressing the issue of attorney's fees during the Rule 59(e) hearing, the Master\r\nfound that while the Martins adequately pled their request and the amount was\r\nreasonable and fair, the language of the Covenants required a party to choose\r\nbetween damages suffered by reason of violation of the Covenants or an injunction\r\n\nrequiring the Covenants be followed. Because the Martins sought to enforce the\r\nCovenants through an injunction, the Master decided the Covenants did not\r\nprovide for an award of fees; thus, the Master modified the original order to\r\neliminate the award of attorney's fees and costs to the Martins.\r\n\r\nThis direct appeal and cross appeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n   A. Bay and Goddin's Direct Appeal\r\n\r\n   1. Did the Master err in admitting evidence beyond the easement conveyance\r\n      documents to interpret the extent of the easement?\r\n\r\n   2. Did the Master err in imposing a setback line of an additional five feet in\r\n      excess of the setback line established by the county for construction of Bay's\r\n      fence?\r\n\r\n   B. The Martins' Cross Appeal\r\n\r\n   1. Did the Master err in failing to allow the Martins to request relief in both law\r\n      and equity?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"Although the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law action, the\r\ndetermination of the extent of an easement is an equitable matter.\" Plott, 374 S.C.\r\nat 510, 649 S.E.2d at 95 (citing Jowers v.

We find that even if portions of the testimony were admitted in error, it\r\nwas harmless.\r\n\r\n\"'The language of an easement determines its extent.'\" Plott, 374 S.C. at 513, 649\r\nS.E.2d at 96 (quoting Binkley v.

We must \"construe\r\nunambiguous language in the grant of an easement according to the terms the\r\nparties have used,\" and thus, we find it is not within our authority to alter the\r\nlocation or boundaries of the easement. However, despite the unambiguous\r\ndescription of the easement's location and boundaries, there is no mention of access\r\nto the easement.\r\n\r\nDue to the absence of language regarding access to the easement, the Master was\r\npermitted to consider all surrounding circumstances in determining the access that\r\nwas intended by the conveyance. The Martins testified to having travelled to the\r\ncommunity area by passing over their property line onto the easement from when\r\nthe developer, also the grantor, first finished constructing the dock. Because Bay\r\ncannot construct a fence or any other obstruction within a certain distance from the\r\nmarsh due to the setback requirements and buffer zone provided in the ZLDR,\r\nthere would not be an obstacle to vehicular or pedestrian access by the Martins to\r\nthe community dock along a portion of their shared property line with Bay. The\r\nsole purpose of the easement as stated in the conveyance was for\r\n\"pedestrian/vehicular\" use by the Martins. The Master's ruling simply allows the\r\nMartins to step over their property line, directly onto their express easement, for\r\nthe very purpose for which the easement was intended. This is a reasonable\r\ndetermination of access to the easement, and one that fits within the intent of the\r\n\noriginal parties to the easement. Based on the foregoing, we hold the Master\r\ncorrectly admitted testimony regarding access to the easement.\r\n\r\nRegarding the potential of a fence along the easement, the Martins argued the\r\nMaster ordered a fence could not be constructed along any portion of Lot C and D's\r\nproperty line, but could be placed on the outside of the easement on Bay's side.\r\nHowever, the Master's original order stated:\r\n\r\n             Erection of a fence by Bay will not interfere with the\r\n             easement rights of the owners of Lots A and B to any\r\n             degree so long as it is constructed close enough to the\r\n             boundary of the easement so as not to narrow the\r\n             easement and diminish its utility. Such a fence will of\r\n             necessity block the Martins from accessing the easement\r\n             along the length of the fence . . . A fence which ends a\r\n             sufficient distance from the edge of the marsh to permit\r\n             vehicular access from Lot D onto Lot C will not interfere\r\n             with the use the Martins have made of the easement for\r\n             eleven years.\r\n\r\nThe Master's ruling regarding this decision was not altered in his Rule 59(e) order.\r\nThe order, as written, allows for a fence to be built on the property line. Thus, we\r\ndisagree with the Martins' contention. However, because there is a setback\r\nrequirement in the ZLDR, there will be a portion of the property line that cannot\r\nhave a fence constructed upon it.\r\n\r\nEstablishing Setback Line By Judicial Notice\r\n\r\nBay and Goddin argue the Master erred in taking judicial notice of the migration of\r\nthe critical line, which led to the Master imposing an additional five foot setback in\r\nexcess of the mandatory buffer zone required by the ZLDR. We disagree.\r\n\r\nRule 201, SCRE governs judicial notice. The pertinent portion states:\r\n\r\n             (a) Scope of Rule. This rule governs only judicial notice\r\n             of adjudicative facts.\r\n\r\n             (b) Kinds of Facts. A judicially noticed fact must be one\r\n             not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1)\r\n             generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the\r\n\n             trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready\r\n             determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot\r\n             reasonably be questioned.\r\n\r\nRule 201(a)-(b), SCRE.\r\n\r\n\"'A trial court may take judicial notice of a fact only if sufficient notoriety attaches\r\nto the fact involved as to make it proper to assume its existence without proof.'\"\r\nBowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 94, 561 S.E.2d 610, 615 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting\r\nEadie v. H.A. Sack Co., 322 S.C. 164, 171-72, 470 S.E.2d 397, 401 (Ct. App.\r\n1996)). \"A fact is not subject to judicial notice unless the fact is either of such\r\ncommon knowledge that it is accepted by the general public without qualification\r\nor contention, or its accuracy may be ascertained by reference to readily available\r\nsources of indisputable reliability.\" Id. (quoting Eadie, 322 S.C. at 172, 470\r\nS.E.2d at 401).\r\n\r\nHere, the Master explained the basis for its judicial notice at the Rule 59(e) hearing\r\nby stating:  [T]his is based on personal observation and, therefore,\r\n             that's why I think judicial notice should be sufficient.\r\n             There is both, in this county, erosion of property and\r\n             accretion of property, and I believe that, based upon my\r\n             experience on the Planning Board, that every five years\r\n             the requirement is that the critical line be readjusted on\r\n             properties in the event of future development. So that's\r\n             one notice that [this court has] had.\r\n\r\n             Two will be my personal observation in my own yard . . .\r\n             .\r\n\r\nWe find the Master properly took judicial notice of the critical line as stated in §\r\n9.7 of the ZLDR. See Massey v. War Emergency Co-op. Ass'n., 209 S.C. 292, 299,\r\n39 S.E.2d 907, 912 (1946) (finding the trial court took proper notice of the rules\r\nand regulations promulgated by an agency pursuant to applicable statutes). We\r\nalso find the Master properly took judicial notice of the setback from the critical\r\nline, as stated in §§ 9.7.1, 9.7.2 of the ZLDR. However, we are not convinced it\r\nwas proper for the Master to take judicial notice of the migration of the critical\r\nline. The Master inaccurately stated his personal knowledge of the critical line's\r\nmigration created a basis for judicial notice. We do not believe that fact is one of\r\n\ncommon knowledge accepted by the general public without qualification or\r\ncontention. The Master does not cite any readily available source in reference to\r\nthis fact, nor does a review of the ZLDR establish this fact to be true either.\r\n\r\nWhile it might have been improper to take judicial notice of the migration of the\r\ncritical line based upon personal experience, we believe there is evidence on the\r\nrecord for the Master to determine there can be a migration of the critical line. The\r\ndialogue between the Master and the expert surveyor was as follows:\r\n\r\n             The Court: Before you go, what would be the length of\r\n             that easement along the waterfront? 76 ten plus --\r\n             The Witness: 76 ten, L-4 would be 32.05 and L-3 would\r\n             be 8.34. That would be the DHEC critical line.\r\n             The Court: Which does move from time to time, but\r\n             that's the dimension you found?\r\n             The Witness: Yes.\r\n\r\nBecause the Master was provided with this expert surveyor's testimony, we find it\r\nwas within his discretion to order an additional five feet to the setback line.\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the Master.\r\n\r\nThe Martins' Cross Appeal\r\n\r\nThe Martins contend the Master erred in failing to allow them to request relief in\r\nboth law and equity. Specifically, they argue the denial of their request for\r\nattorney's fees places the burden of enforcing Covenants upon the enforcer and\r\nfavors the violator. We disagree.\r\n\r\nAs a threshold issue, Bay and Goddin claim that because the Martins did not\r\nrequest attorney's fees in their pleadings, they are not entitled to such relief. Bay\r\nand Goddin did not raise this issue as a ground for their appeal. Thus, as\r\nrespondents in this cross-appeal, they have failed to preserve the issue; the ruling\r\nof the Master that the Martins adequately pled attorney's fees is the law of the case.\r\nSee Commercial Credit Loans, Inc. v. Riddle, 334 S.C. 176, 187, 512 S.E.2d 123,\r\n129 (Ct. App. 1999) (providing that a holding contested by a respondent is the law\r\nof the case where the respondent failed to cross-appeal that holding). However,\r\ndespite the Martins' assertions, we find the Master was correct in reversing his\r\ndecision to award attorney's fees.\r\n\nAfter reviewing the terms of the Covenants that all parties stipulated to, we find the\r\nMartins had two alternative remedies. Paragraph 2 of the Covenants states:\r\n\r\n             Upon violation of any covenant or restriction, or upon the\r\n             attempted violation of any of said covenants, it shall be\r\n             lawful for any person or persons, firm, corporation or\r\n             corporations, owning any lot or other property situated in\r\n             said Subdivision to prosecute any proceeding at law or in\r\n             equity against such violator and either to prevent him or\r\n             them from so doing or to recover damages, including\r\n             attorneys fees and costs incurred in enforcing these\r\n             covenants and restrictions for such violation.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). In light of the document's plain language, we think the parties\r\nintended the word \"or\" in accordance with its common, disjunctive usage. See\r\nHarris v. Anderson Cnty. Sheriff's Office, 381 S.C. 357, 362, 673 S.E.2d 423, 425\r\n(2009) (citing Brewer v. Brewer, 242 S.C. 9, 14, 129 S.E.2d 736, 738 (1963)\r\n(noting that the use of the word \"or\" in a statute \"is a disjunctive particle that marks\r\nan alternative\")). While the Martins contend a decision that they must choose\r\nbetween injunctive relief or damages creates a situation where the burden of\r\nenforcing the Covenants falls solely on the enforcer, we disagree. By choosing\r\ndamages as their relief, they may get costs and attorney's fees, which may in turn\r\nprevent the violator from violating again. With injunctive relief, they may enforce\r\nthe court ordered injunction and the violators will be found in contempt if the order\r\nis violated. We also note that previously, in response to the Master's question of\r\nwhether the Martins sought damages or injunctive relief, the Martins' counsel\r\nstated injunctive, as it was much more important. Therefore, we affirm the Master\r\non this issue.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, we affirm the Master.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS AND THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"}]
