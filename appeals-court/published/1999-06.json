Grady, the Personal Representative of the estate\r\nof Harrell's mother, Irene Dennis Blankenship. We reverse and remand. \r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Blankenship, Sr. and Irene Dennis Blankenship (together \"the Blankenships\") executed a joint\r\nwill on October 12, 1989. In the will, they made provisions for burial and directed their funeral expenses\r\nand just debts be paid from their estates. They then devised their entire estates to the survivor. The will\r\nalso provided, \r\n\r\n\r\nIn the event we should die simultaneously or within a short time of each other, we hereby give, devise, and\r\nbequeath all of the property of every kind or nature, real, personal, or real or personal mixed, of which\r\neither of us may die seized and possessed, to our beloved children, Jean Blankenship Grady, Charles Clyde\r\nBlankenship, Jr. and Karl D. Blankenship. We have intentionally not given, devised or bequeath[ed] unto\r\nour daughter, Anne B. Harrell, anything for we have amply provided for her during our lifetimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Blankenship died on October 30, 1992. Mrs. Blankenship died on January 18, 1996.\r\n\r\n\r\n The joint will was admitted to probate. Harrell filed a petition, asserting that the will should be construed\r\nas making no provision in the event the Blankenships failed to die simultaneously or within a short time\r\nof each other. She sought distribution of the estate among Mrs. Blankenship's intestate heirs. Upon\r\nHarrell's motion, the case was transferred to circuit court.\r\n\r\n In its order, the trial court held that the language of the will as a whole clearly demonstrated an intent of\r\nMrs. Blankenship to dispose of her entire estate. In addition, the court found clear and unambiguous the\r\nlanguage setting forth the Blankenships' intent not to make a devise to Harrell. Although the court found\r\nthe Blankenships did not die simultaneously or within a short time of each other, the court held that the\r\nconditional clause was not important in the interpretation of the intent of the testator to disinherit\r\nHarrell.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine issue of material fact and\r\nthat the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Caf&eacute; Assocs., Ltd. v. Gerngross, 305\r\nS.C. 6, 9, 406 S.E.2d 162, 164 (1991).\r\n\r\n\r\nHarrell argues the trial court erred in giving effect to the provisions of Mrs. Blankenship's will that were\r\nconditioned upon the happening of simultaneous or common death. We agree. \r\n\r\n\r\nA conditional or contingent will is a will that conditions its validity upon the occurrence of a specific event.\r\nIf the event does not take place, the will is void and the decedent's estate passes under the laws of\r\nintestacy. See Capps v. Richardson, 215 S.C. 34, 38, 53 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1949). Although the law engages a\r\npresumption against intestacy, this presumption may be overcome by the \"facts and plain language of the\r\nwill.\" Albergotti v. Summers, 203 S.C. 137, 147, 26 S.E.2d 395, 400 (1943).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether a will is conditional depends upon the facts of each case. See Capps, 215 S.C. at 38, 53 S.E.2d at\r\n877. \"[T]he 'courts will not regard a will as conditional or contingent unless the intention of the testator to\r\nmake it so clearly appears, either expressly or by necessary implication, from the language of the will as a\r\nwhole.'\" Id. at 39, 53 S.E.2d at 878 (quoting 57 Am. Jur. Wills Â§ 672). \"In searching for [the testator's]\r\nintention, however, [the court] may not conjecture how the testator might have chosen to express himself\r\nhad his mind adverted to the particular contingency. . . . [The court] may not redraft the [w]ill, nor . . .\r\ndoctor a crucial part.\" Limehouse v. Limehouse, 256 S.C. 255, 257, 182 S.E.2d 58, 59 (1971). \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Blankenships' will is clearly and unambiguously conditional. It provides for disposition of the\r\nBlankenships' estate to the survivor if one predeceases the other or, in the alternative, to their children\r\nother than Harrell if the Blankenships die simultaneously or within a short time of each other. Any\r\npresumption against intestacy is overcome by the clarity of the language indicating that the gift of the\r\nproperty to anyone other than the surviving spouse is expressly conditional on the simultaneous or near\r\nsimultaneous death of both spouses. The conditional language is in every donative clause in the will except\r\nfor the provision giving the surviving spouse all the property of the other spouse. Even the denomination of\r\nGrady as the executrix of the estate is conditional on the Blankenships' simultaneous death. The will\r\nsimply does not make any provision for disposition of the estate upon the death of the survivor unless that\r\ndeath occurs within a short time of the other spouse's death. To the contrary, that the will contemplates\r\ndeath of the surviving spouse very close in time to the other spouse indicates that the Blankenships\r\nconsidered the contingency of one spouse's surviving the other yet chose to do nothing about it unless their\r\ndeaths were nearly simultaneous. \r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, that the will contains an explicit disinheritance of Harrell does not change our position. The\r\nprovision disinheriting Harrell is in the same paragraph as the alternate disposition to the children in the\r\nevent of a simultaneous death. This location shows that the Blankenships intended to leave the decision of\r\nhow to distribute the surviving spouse's property to the surviving spouse. Thus, reading the will as a\r\nwhole, we conclude that the disinheritance provision was dependent on the Blankenships' simultaneous\r\ndeaths. See Citizens &amp; Southern Nat'l Bank v. Roach, 239 S.C. 291, 296, 122 S.E.2d 644, 647 (1961) (\"[I]n\r\ndetermining the meaning of words in a will, they must be construed in their context and not in isolation,\r\napart from other portions of the will.\"); Schultz v. Barr, 186 S.C. 498, 502, 196 S.E. 177, 179 (1938) (\"The\r\nmeaning which the testator intended to convey, by the use of particular words and expressions, will be\r\ndetermined from their relationship to other words and expressions used, and, when his intention is\r\ndiscovered, it will be enforced, notwithstanding that a meaning broader or narrower than is usual be given\r\nto particular words and phrases.\").(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we can find no evidence from the will itself that the Blankenships intended the bequests to\r\nthird parties to operate even if one spouse survived the other for a significant period. As described above,\r\nour duty is to interpret the will from the language the testator used to determine the testator's intent. We\r\ncannot re-write the will in order to eliminate the contingency of simultaneous death from the alternative\r\ndisposition to the children other than Harrell. Neither party disputes the trial court's finding that this\r\ncontingency did not occur. Accordingly, because Mrs. Blankenship failed to make a disposition of her estate\r\nin her will, her estate must pass under the rules of intestacy. See Jackson v. Estate of Jackson, 460 S.W.2d\r\n799 (Ark. 1970) (holding that unambiguous language of joint will indicated the will was conditional\r\nbecause the will only provided for a distribution of property to the surviving spouse or to others in the\r\nevent that the testator and her husband died simultaneously or that their deaths occurred within thirty\r\ndays of each other); Glover v. Reynolds, 37 A.2d 90, 91 (N.J. Ch. 1944) (In a case where the will only\r\ndisposed of property to the surviving spouse or, in the alternative, to others if the couple died\r\nsimultaneously, the testator \"completely overlooked the contingency which did occur. Her failure to\r\nanticipate this, or, in the alternative to execute a new will in the four months which intervened between\r\nthe death of her husband and her death, cannot now be cured. This court, under the guise of construing\r\nthe will, will not write a new one.\"), aff'd, 40 A.2d 624 (1945).\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial court's order is \r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNOR, J., concurs. GOOLSBY, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J. (dissenting):\r\n\r\n\r\nI respectfully dissent with my fine colleagues's conclusion that Anne Harrell may take a portion of Irene\r\nBlankenship's estate under the intestacy statute. Rather, I would affirm the decision of the circuit court\r\nbecause giving effect to the disinheritance clause in Mrs. Blankenship's will (\"Item IV\") is the only way to\r\nfulfill her clearly expressed testamentary intent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most basic tenet of will construction is that the court should strive to give effect to the intent\r\nof the testator. May v. Riley, 279 S.C. 248, 305 S.E.2d 77 (1983); In re Estate of Fabian, 326 S.C. 349, 483\r\nS.E.2d 474 (Ct.App.1997). The intent of the testator is to be gleaned from the entire written instrument.\r\nEchols v. Graham, 256 S.C. 202, 182 S.E.2d 69 (1971). Similarly, the court should \"indulge in every\r\npresumption\" to validate a will and thereby avoid intestacy. See Meier v. Meier, 208 S.C. 520, 526, 38\r\nS.E.2d 762, 765 (1946) (\"The law strongly favors the sustaining of a will as opposed to its invalidation and\r\nwill indulge in every presumption against intestacy.\"); Abrams v. Templeton, 320 S.C. 325, 330, 465 S.E.2d\r\n117, 121 (Ct. App. 1995) (\"The law abhors intestacy and will indulge every presumption in favor of the\r\nvalidity of the will.\"). Finally, it is a long-standing rule in this state that a will speaks at the time of death.\r\nShelley v. Shelley, 244 S.C. 598, 137 S.E.2d 851 (1964); Sciafe v. Thomson, 15 S.C. 337 (1880). \r\n\r\n\r\nHere, the obvious intent of Mrs. Blankenship was to prevent Harrell from taking from the estate because\r\nher share had already been given her through inter vivos transfers. Mrs. Blankenship executed a will\r\nclearly expressing this intent and the record contains no evidence indicating she ever revoked or otherwise\r\ntried to invalidate this will. We should make every effort, therefore, to construe the will so as to give effect\r\nto the clearly expressed testementary intent and to avoid intestacy. \r\n\r\n\r\nViewing the will in its entirety, \"Item IV\" appears to be a default plan to avoid intestacy through an\r\nalternative testamentary scheme meant to apply when both spouses die without making a substitute will.\r\nThis situation could occur either when both spouses die simultaneously or when the surviving spouse is\r\nunable or does not desire to make a substitute will. Consequently, I would construe \"Item IV\" to be\r\napplicable in any circumstance where there is not a surviving spouse to take the estate of the spouse\r\nwhose estate is in probate. As such, \"Item IV\" should take effect where, as here, one spouse survives the\r\nother by a substantial period without making a new will just as it would if both spouses died\r\nsimultaneously. Cf. In re Rentall's Will, 60 N.Y.S.2d 646 (Surr. Ct., Queens County 1945) (construing a\r\nprovision in a joint will to be effective when one spouse predeceased the other by eleven months, even\r\nthough provision purported to take effect when spouses died \"at or about the same time,\" in order to give\r\neffect to the intent of the testator and to avoid intestacy); In re Trager's Estate, 108 N.E.2d 908, 914 (Ill.\r\n1952) (giving effect to a will codicil purporting to apply when spouses died within a short time of each\r\nother, even though husband survived wife by over three years, because the \"well-considered plan\" set forth\r\nin the codicil and the \"care with which the instrument was preserved\" indicated that there was no intent\r\nfor the codicil to be contingent on near simultaneous death of the spouses).\r\n\r\n\r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Grady requests that this court find In re Trager's Estate, 108 N.E.2d 908 (Ill. 1952) and In re Rentall's Will, 60 N.Y.S.2d\r\n646 (N.Y. Surr. Ct. 1945) persuasive. These cases hold wills unconditional in similar circumstances to those at bar.\r\nHowever, in light of our discussion above, we decline to follow these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3003","title":"Lela Peterson v.

Lela \r\n  Peterson's son, Steve Tarver, was killed while riding in a car driven by E.&nbsp;Michael \r\n  Galloway. The car belonged to Margaret Webb Walker. Peterson sought actual and \r\n  punitive damages from West American Insurance Company, Walker's insurance carrier. \r\n  The circuit court granted West American summary judgment, finding Walker had \r\n  voluntarily cancelled the insurance policy prior to the date of the automobile \r\n  accident. Peterson appeals, arguing the cancellation was not effective in the \r\n  absence of notice to the Highway Department. We affirm.(1) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\nBACKGROUND \r\nWalker obtained an automobile insurance \r\n  policy on November 23, 1990 from West American through the Abercrombie Insurance \r\n  Agency. The policy was for the stated six-month term of November 23, 1990 to \r\n  May 23, 1991. \r\n  \r\nOn or about November 27, 1990, Walker \r\n  gave her car to Galloway, a neighbor, so that he could repair the car. Galloway \r\n  took possession of the car and never returned. On December 12, 1990, Walker \r\n  reported her car stolen to the Simpsonville Police Department. Walker spoke \r\n  with an Abercrombie agent on February 15, 1991 and sought to cancel her policy. \r\n  West American issued a cancellation notice and sent Walker a refund check on \r\n  February 25, 1991. West American designated November 28, 1990 as the policy \r\n  termination date on the notice. However, the Highway Department never received \r\n  a Form FR-4, Notice of Cancellation of Policy. \r\n  \r\nOn April 14, 1991, Galloway wrecked \r\n  Walker's car in a single-car accident in Mississippi. Galloway, who had been \r\n  drinking, lost control of the car and hit a tree. Steve Tarver, a passenger \r\n  in the back seat of the car, died as a result of his injuries in the wreck. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nPeterson, Tarver's mother, was appointed \r\n  administratrix of Tarver's estate. Prior to the appointment, Peterson's attorney \r\n  informed Walker of the wreck and sought information on Walker's insurance company. \r\n  Walker referred the letter to West American. West American declined coverage, \r\n  asserting Walker cancelled her policy prior to the accident. Thereafter, on \r\n  several occasions West American suggested Walker retain personal counsel and \r\n  advised her they would not provide her with a defense. \r\n  \r\nPeterson's attorney sought the limits \r\n  of the policy from West American. West American continued to refuse liability, \r\n  claiming Galloway stole the car and Walker cancelled the policy prior to the \r\n  accident. \r\n  \r\nPeterson brought a wrongful death \r\n  action against Galloway, alleging he drove the car in excess of 100 m.p.h. while \r\n  intoxicated before crashing, and a negligent entrustment action against Walker. \r\n  In 1993, the Mississippi circuit court awarded a default judgment against Walker \r\n  and Galloway for $544,350. South Carolina circuit court Judge McKellar enrolled \r\n  the foreign judgment in South Carolina for the principal amount plus post-judgment \r\n  interest of $105,231.07. \r\n  \r\nWalker assigned her claims against \r\n  West American to Peterson on July 5, 1995. Peterson then sued West American \r\n  for bad faith refusal to pay benefits. Peterson alleged West American failed \r\n  to perform its duty to defend Walker under the terms of the policy, resulting \r\n  in the default judgment; failed to properly cancel the policy under the law; \r\n  and failed to pay benefits due under the policy. West American continued to \r\n  refute liability, contending, among numerous defenses, that Walker properly \r\n  cancelled the insurance policy prior to the accident. \r\n  \r\nWest American and Peterson filed \r\n  motions for summary judgment, which were heard by Judge Pyle. The circuit court \r\n  granted summary judgment in favor of Peterson. The court found West American \r\n  validly cancelled the insurance policy pursuant to Walker's request, and Peterson, \r\n  who stood in the shoes of Walker, failed to establish the existence of a mutually \r\n  binding contract. The circuit court subsequently denied Peterson's Rule 59, \r\n  SCRCP motion. Peterson appeals. \r\n  \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\nI. Did the court err in failing to \r\n  find the insurance policy remained in effect because West American did not notify \r\n  the Highway Department that Walker's policy had been cancelled? \r\n  \r\nII. Did the court err in finding \r\n  West American properly cancelled the policy in accordance with the relevant \r\n  policy and statutory provisions? \r\n  \r\nIII. Did the court err \r\n  in finding the insurance policy was not in effect at the time of the automobile \r\n  accident since the alleged negligent entrustment occurred while the policy remained \r\n  in effect? \r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA trial court should grant a motion \r\n  for summary judgment when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, \r\n  and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there \r\n  is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled \r\n  to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. See also Tupper \r\n  v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997). \r\n  \r\nAn appellate court reviews the granting \r\n  of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant \r\n  to Rule 56(c), SCRCP: Summary judgment is properly upheld when there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law. Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. \r\n  101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991). See also 5 Am. Jur. 2d Appellate Review \r\n  Â§ 700 (1995) (\"In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the appellate court \r\n  is limited to the evidence that was before the trial court and applies the same \r\n  standard of review as did the trial court.\"). \r\n  \r\nUnder Rule 56(c), SCRCP, \r\n  the party seeking summary judgment has the initial burden of demonstrating the \r\n  absence of a genuine issue of material fact. Baughman, 306 S.C. 101, \r\n  410 S.E.2d 537. Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial \r\n  burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponent's case, \r\n  the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in \r\n  the pleadings. Rather, the non-moving party must come forward with specific \r\n  facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Rule 56(e), SCRCP; SSI \r\n  Med. Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 392 S.E.2d 789 (1990); NationsBank \r\n  v. Scott Farm, 320 S.C. 299, 465 S.E.2d 98 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\n  \r\nIn determining whether \r\n  any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. \r\n  Summer v. Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997); City of Columbia \r\n  v. American Civil Liberties Union, 323 S.C. 384, 475 S.E.2d 747 (1996). \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\nI. Did the insurance policy remain \r\n  in effect because West American failed to notify the Highway Department that \r\n  Walker's policy was cancelled? \r\n  \r\nPeterson's first argument is two-fold: \r\n  (a) whether Â§\r\nÂ§ 56-10-240 and 56-10-40 of the South \r\nCarolina Code required West American to notify the Highway Department when Walker's \r\npolicy was cancelled; and (b) if so, whether West American's failure to notify \r\nthe Highway Department continued the policy in effect. \r\n \r\nA. Failure to notify Highway Department \r\n  of voluntary cancellation. \r\n  \r\nWe hold Walker's voluntary cancellation \r\n  of her insurance policy absolved West American's responsibilities under Â§Â§ 56-10-240 \r\n  and 56-10-40 because these provisions apply when the insurer cancels or refuses \r\n  to renew a policy, not when the insured voluntarily cancels(2) \r\n  a policy. \r\n  \r\nSection 56-10-240 provides in pertinent \r\n  part: \r\n  \r\n(A) If, during the period for which \r\n  it is licensed, a motor vehicle is or becomes an uninsured motor vehicle, then \r\n  the vehicle owner immediately shall obtain insurance on the vehicle or within \r\n  five days after the effective date of cancellation or expiration of his liability \r\n  insurance policy surrender the motor vehicle license plates and registration \r\n  certificates issued for the motor vehicle. If five working days after the last \r\n  day to pay an automobile liability insurance premium . . . a motor vehicle is \r\n  an uninsured motor vehicle, the insurer shall give written notice . . \r\n  . within ten days after the five-day period ends . . . to the department of \r\n  the cancellation or refusal to renew under the following circumstances: \r\n  \r\n(1) the lapse or termination of such \r\n  insurance or security occurs within three months of issuance, provided that \r\n  this subsection only applies to new policies, and not renewal or replacement \r\n  policies; or \r\n  \r\n(2) the lapse or termination occurs \r\n  after three months for a resident who fails one or more of the objective standards \r\n  prescribed in Section 38-73-455. \r\n  \r\n(B) The department, in its discretion, \r\n  may authorize insurers to utilize alternative methods of providing notice \r\n  of cancellation of or refusal to renew to the department. The department \r\n  may not reissue registration certificates and license plates for that vehicle \r\n  until satisfactory evidence has been filed by the owner or by the insurer \r\n  who gave the cancellation or refusal to renew notice to the department that \r\n  the vehicle is insured. . . . The department shall give notice by first class \r\n  mail of the cancellation or suspension of registration privileges to the vehicle \r\n  owner at his last known address. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-10-240 (Supp. \r\n1998) (emphasis added).\r\n \r\nThis provision explicitly references \r\n  only an insurer's cancellation notice. The emphasized portion illustrates how \r\n  the provision focuses on instances where the insurer cancels or refuses to renew \r\n  a policy and provides no specific reference to an insured's decision to cancel. \r\n  Thus, we find Â§ 56-10-240 applicable when an insurer cancels or refuses to renew \r\n  a policy, but not applicable where the insured voluntarily seeks to cancel an \r\n  insurance policy. \r\n  \r\n\r\nSection 56-10-40 permits a similar inference. \r\nSection 56-10-40 provides in relevant part: \r\n \r\nEvery insurer writing automobile \r\n  liability insurance in this State and every provider of other security approved \r\n  and accepted by the director or his designee in lieu of such insurance shall \r\n  immediately notify the department of the lapse or termination of any such insurance \r\n  or security issued to or provided for a resident of this State in the following \r\n  circumstances: \r\n  \r\n(1) the lapse or termination of such \r\n  insurance or security occurs within three months of issuance provided that this \r\n  subsection only applies to new policies, and not renewal or replacement policies; \r\n  or \r\n  \r\n(2) the lapse or termination occurs \r\n  after three months for a resident who fails one or more of the objective standards \r\n  prescribed in Section 38-73-455. \r\n  \r\nThis notification must be in writing \r\n  or magnetic media in a manner considered satisfactory to the department. Upon \r\n  receipt of any such notice the department shall make a reasonable effort to \r\n  notify the person that his certificate of registration has been suspended and \r\n  shall recover the certificate from such person and the motor vehicle registration \r\n  plates from the vehicles concerned. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-10-40 (Supp. \r\n  1998) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nThe provision's first sentence explicitly \r\n  limits its scope to insurers. The provision's emphasized portion implicitly \r\n  assumes the insured lacks notice of a policy's cancellation until the Highway \r\n  Department notifies the insured, thus implying the insurer, rather than the \r\n  insured, cancelled the policy. Therefore, we find this provision's applicability \r\n  also is limited to instances where the insurer, rather than the insured, cancels \r\n  the policy. \r\n  \r\n\r\nOther statutory provisions imposing \r\nnotice requirements when the insurer cancels a policy, but not where the insured \r\ncancels the policy, buttress our conclusion. See, e.g., Fidelity &amp; Cas. \r\nIns. Co. v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 278 S.C. 332, 335, 295 S.E.2d 783, 785 (1982) \r\n(noting that \"[i]n construing a statute, it is proper to consider legislation \r\ndealing with the same subject matter\"). For example, Â§ 38-77-120 provides: \r\n \r\n\r\n(a) No cancellation or refusal to renew \r\nby an insurer of a policy of automobile insurance is effective unless the insurer \r\ndelivers or mails, to the named insured at the address shown in the policy, a \r\nwritten notice of the cancellation or refusal to renew. \r\n \r\n* * * * \r\n  \r\n(b) Subsection (a) of this section \r\n  does not apply if the: \r\n  \r\n* * * * \r\n  \r\n(2) named insured has demonstrated \r\n  by some overt action to the insurer or its agent that he expressly intends that \r\n  the policy be canceled or that it not be renewed. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-120 (Supp \r\n  1998).(3) \r\n  \r\nThis provision absolves an insurer's \r\n  responsibility to issue notice when the insured cancels or refuses to renew \r\n  a policy, in contrast to when the insurer takes such action and, thus, illustrates \r\n  the different duties arising when the insured cancels a policy as opposed to \r\n  when the insurer cancels the policy. \r\n  \r\nTherefore, we hold Walker's voluntary \r\n  cancellation of her policy absolved West American's notice responsibilities \r\n  under Â§Â§ 56-10-40 and 56-10-240.(4) Because Peterson, \r\n  as Walker's assignee, assumes the same position as Walker, Peterson is also \r\n  precluded from claiming West American failed to give proper notice. Singletary \r\n  v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 316 S.C. 199, 201-02, 447 S.E.2d 869, 870 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1994) (holding an assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor and \r\n  can claim no higher rights than the assignor possessed at the time of the assignment). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nB. No continuation of policy in the \r\n  absence of notice of cancellation. \r\n  \r\n\r\nEven assuming Â§Â§ 56-10-40 and 56-10-240 \r\napplied, Peterson's claim is without merit because West American's failure to \r\ncomply with the notice requirements does not effectively continue the policy. \r\n\r\n \r\nIf Â§ 56-10-40 or Â§ 56-10-240 do apply, \r\n  West American violated these provisions by failing to properly notify the Highway \r\n  Department that Walker's policy terminated. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 56-10-40 \r\n  &amp; -240 (Supp. 1998); United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. v. Security \r\n  Fire &amp; Indem. Co. 248 S.C. 307, 313-14, 149 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1966) (\"Statutory \r\n  provisions requiring notice for cancellation or termination of compulsory motor \r\n  vehicle insurance are mandatory, must be strictly followed to effect a cancellation \r\n  or termination of the policy, and must be construed so as to effect the statutory \r\n  purpose of providing protection to the general public.\"). \r\n  \r\nHowever, even if required, West American's \r\n  failure to properly notify the Highway Department would not continue the policy \r\n  in effect. See Fidelity &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 278 \r\n  S.C. 332, 295 S.E.2d 783 (1982). In Fidelity, the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court analyzed prior versions of Â§ 56-10-40 [formerly Â§ 56-11-220] and Â§&nbsp;56-10-240 \r\n  [formerly Â§ 56-11-740]. The court held Â§ 56-11-740 required the insured, rather \r\n  than the insurer, to serve notice of the cancellation to the Highway Department \r\n  because at the time the cause of action arose the statute required notice from \r\n  the insured. The court noted the statute had since been amended to provide the \r\n  insurer was to give notice to the Highway Department in the event of a cancellation \r\n  of coverage. Next, the court held Â§ 56-11-220 required notice of a cancellation, \r\n  but did not continue the policy in effect when the insurer failed to properly \r\n  notify the Highway Department absent an explicit statement providing for such \r\n  effect. Fidelity, 278 S.C. at 334-35, 295 S.E.2d at 784-85 (\"Nothing \r\n  in this statute specifically states that failure to notify as required continues \r\n  the policy in effect.\"). Neither of the current statutes, Â§ 56-10-40 and Â§ 56-10-240, \r\n  provide for a policy's continuation if an insurer fails to give notice under \r\n  the provisions. \r\n  \r\nAlthough Peterson contends Fidelity \r\n  did not require notice under the former Â§ 56-11-740 only because the statute \r\n  then referenced notice by the \"insured\" rather than the \"insurer,\" we hold the \r\n  court's subsequent discussion regarding Â§ 56-11-220, with nearly identical provisions \r\n  to our current Â§ 56-10-40, governs the case sub judice. Therefore, we \r\n  hold that even if the statutory provisions applied to West American, failure \r\n  to properly notify the Highway Department of the cancellation of Walker's insurance \r\n  policy did not continue the policy in effect. \r\n  \r\nII. Did the court err in finding \r\n  the policy was properly cancelled in accordance with the relevant policy and \r\n  statutory provisions? \r\n  \r\nPeterson further contends Walker's \r\n  attempt to cancel her policy was invalid because the policy and the corresponding \r\n  statutory provision prevent cancellation within sixty days of the policy's issuance. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n  \r\nThe relevant provision in Walker's \r\n  insurance policy concerning cancellation of the policy states as follows: \r\n  \r\nDuring the first 60 days this policy \r\n  is in effect, the policy may be cancelled only if: \r\n  \r\na. a check or bank draft tendered \r\n  for payment of premium is returned unpaid for insufficient funds or other reason \r\n  by the financial institution; or \r\nb. You furnish proof from the Department \r\n  of Highways and Public Transportation that: \r\n(1) the \"your covered auto\" shown \r\n  in the Declarations has been sold or otherwise disposed of; or \r\n(2) you have surrendered the tags \r\n  and registration of the \"your covered auto\" shown in the Declarations. \r\n  \r\nThe corresponding statutory provision, \r\n  Â§ 56-10-280, states: \r\n  \r\n[A] contract or policy may be canceled \r\n  within the first sixty days only under one or more of the following circumstances: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(1) A check or bank draft tendered \r\n  by the insured for payment of premium is returned unpaid for insufficient funds \r\n  or other reason by the insured's financial institution. \r\n(2) The insured produces satisfactory \r\n  proof from the department that he has sold or otherwise disposed of the insured \r\n  vehicle or surrendered its tags and registration. \r\n(3) The insured has secured another \r\n  policy that meets the financial responsibility requirements prescribed in this \r\n  chapter. \r\n  \r\n S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-10-280 (Supp. \r\n  1998). \r\n  \r\nPeterson contends Walker's failure \r\n  to produce proof from the Highway Department that she sold or otherwise disposed \r\n  of her vehicle or surrendered her tags and registration renders any attempted \r\n  cancellation of the policy within sixty days of issuance invalid. While Peterson's \r\n  assertions may be true, Peterson's argument ultimately fails because we find \r\n  Walker cancelled the policy more than sixty days after its issuance. \r\n  \r\nWest American issued Walker's policy \r\n  on November 23, 1990. On February 15, 1991, Walker sought to cancel the policy \r\n  retroactive to November 23, 1990, the date of issuance. On February 25, 1991, \r\n  West American issued Walker a cancellation notice and a premium refund. We hold \r\n  Walker's policy effectively terminated on February 25, 1991, the date West American \r\n  issued the premium refund and cancellation notice. Although the cancellation \r\n  notice lists November 28, 1990, as the termination date, West American did not \r\n  actually terminate the policy until it refunded Walker's unearned premium and \r\n  issued the cancellation notice on February 25, 1991. Back-dating the termination \r\n  date only afforded Walker a larger premium refund and did not absolve West American \r\n  of any liability until the cancellation notice was issued on February 25, 1991. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFurthermore, Walker's policy permits \r\n  cancellation by returning the policy to West American. Walker returned the policy \r\n  to West American on February 15, 1991, more than sixty days after West American \r\n  issued the policy. Therefore, the policy and corresponding statutory provision \r\n  did not preclude Walker from effectively canceling her policy prior to the date \r\n  of the accident. \r\n  \r\nIII. Did coverage apply because the \r\n  alleged negligent entrustment occurred when the policy was in effect? \r\n  \r\nPeterson lastly argues Walker negligently \r\n  entrusted her car to Galloway on November 27, 1990, which is before the purported \r\n  cancellation date of November 28, 1990 used by West American. Peterson contends \r\n  the date of negligent entrustment as alleged in the underlying complaint was \r\n  therefore within the period the policy was in effect. Consequently, Peterson \r\n  contends West American should have provided a defense to Walker and essentially \r\n  asserts that West American acted in bad faith by refusing to perform its duty \r\n  to defend as required by the terms of the policy. \r\n  \r\n\"Where an insurer refuses to undertake \r\n  the defense of an action against the insured based upon a claim within the coverage \r\n  of the insurance policy, it thereby breaches the contract of insurance and is \r\n  liable to the insured for all damages resulting to such insured as a direct \r\n  result of such refusal and breach.\" Fuller v. Eastern Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. \r\n  Co., 240 S.C. 75, 89, 124 S.E.2d 602, 610 (1962) (holding automobile insurance \r\n  carrier liable for damages resulting from refusal to defend an action within \r\n  the coverage of the policy). Liability is predicated on the existence of a valid \r\n  contract of insurance coverage. Id.  \r\n  \r\nIn addition, every contract carries \r\n  with it a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the processing of a claim \r\n  under a mutually binding insurance contract. Tadlock Painting Co. v. Maryland \r\n  Cas. Co., 322 S.C. 498, 473 S.E.2d 52 (1996) (recognizing a cause of action \r\n  for an insurance company's bad faith handling of third party benefits and holding \r\n  that a bad faith claim may exist even in the absence of the breach of an express \r\n  contractual provision). See also Nichols v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \r\n  279 S.C. 336, 340, 306 S.E.2d 616, 619 (1983) (court recognized bad faith action \r\n  in processing of first party benefits, holding \"if an insured can demonstrate \r\n  bad faith or unreasonable action by the insurer in processing a claim under \r\n  their mutually binding insurance contract, he can recover consequential damages \r\n  in a tort action\"). \r\n  \r\nTo establish a bad faith claim against \r\n  an insurance company, the plaintiff must show: (1) the existence of a mutually \r\n  binding contract of insurance between plaintiff and defendant; (2) an insurer's \r\n  refusal to provide benefits due under the contract; (3) resulting from the insurer's \r\n  bad faith or unreasonable action and breach of an implied covenant of good faith \r\n  and fair dealing arising out of the contract; and (4) causing damage to the \r\n  insured. See, e.g., Brown v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 284 S.C. 47, 55, \r\n  324 S.E.2d 641, 646 (Ct. App. 1984) (\"[I]f a mutually binding contract exists \r\n  and the denial is found to be in bad faith or unreasonable, the insurer is liable \r\n  for consequential losses caused by its breach of the express and implied obligations \r\n  of the contract . . . .\"), overruled on other grounds by Charleston County \r\n  Sch. Dist. v. State Budget &amp; Control Bd., 313 S.C. 1, 437 S.E.2d 6 (1993) \r\n  (holding bad faith is in tort, not contract). See also Cock-N-Bull Steakhouse, \r\n  Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 6, 466 S.E.2d 727, 730 (1996). \r\n  \r\n\r\nAs discussed in Part II above, Walker \r\n  and West American properly cancelled Walker's policy on February 25, 1991, before \r\n  the accident of April 14, 1991. Accordingly, no valid insurance contract existed \r\n  at the time of the automobile accident. Therefore, Peterson failed to establish \r\n  the first prong necessary to prove West American acted in bad faith by refusing \r\n  to represent Walker, i.e., the existence of a mutually binding contract of insurance. \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing reasons, we \r\n  conclude Walker cancelled her automobile insurance policy prior to the accident \r\n  involving her car on April 14, 1991. Accordingly, the decision of the trial \r\n  court to grant summary judgment in favor of the insurer, West American, is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1.  We decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.  \"While both \r\n  terms refer to the end of coverage under the policy, Cancellation refers to \r\n  the termination of the policy prior to the end of the policy period, and Termination \r\n  refers to the expiration of the policy by the lapse of the policy period.\" United \r\n  States Fidelity &amp; Guar.

The Commission found the \r\n  statute of limitations barred his action. We reverse and remand. \r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\nBACKGROUND \r\nHamilton was employed as an auto \r\n  mechanic. He sustained an admitted injury on September 9, 1992, while working \r\n  at Bob Bennett Ford when he fell as he stepped off a hydraulic lift hitting \r\n  his back and his hip. After the accident, Hamilton was treated by Dr. Walter \r\n  Connor, his family doctor, who diagnosed bursitis of the right hip. \r\n  \r\nThe Form 12A, Employer's First Report \r\n  of Injury, identified the date and circumstances of the accident and the employees \r\n  who knew of the accident. It described Hamilton's injuries as pulled ligaments \r\n  on the hip and right leg. \r\n  \r\nOn November 24, 1992, Hamilton and \r\n  Bob Bennett executed an Agreement for Compensation and a Receipt of Compensation. \r\n  Under the rules and regulations of the Workers' Compensation Commission, an \r\n  Agreement for Compensation is a Form 15 and a Receipt of Compensation is a Form \r\n  17. The Form 15 listed the date of the accident, the part of the body injured, \r\n  the compensation rate, and the date Hamilton began receiving temporary total \r\n  disability, which was September 16, 1992. The Workers' Compensation Commission \r\n  approved the Form 15 on December 23, 1992. The Form 17 stated Hamilton received \r\n  temporary compensation from September 16, 1992, to September 20, 1992, and returned \r\n  to work without restriction on September 21, 1992. The Form 17 provided: \r\n  \r\nI agree that I was disabled for the \r\n  period indicated and I was paid compensation as shown above. I UNDERSTAND THAT \r\n  I GIVE UP NO RIGHTS TO COMPENSATION FOR FUTURE DISABILITY, FOR PERMANENT DISABILITY, \r\n  DISFIGUREMENT, OR MEDICAL CARE. \r\n  \r\nHamilton returned to work on September \r\n  21, 1992, and continued his employment with Bob Bennett for approximately two \r\n  years. In April of 1994, Hamilton began seeing Dr. Gregory Konduros, a general \r\n  practitioner, who referred him to Dr. Ralph Owings, an orthopaedic surgeon. \r\n  Dr. Owings saw Hamilton on April 27, 1994. Dr. Owings diagnosed Hamilton as \r\n  having a herniated disc and spinal stenosis. After treating Hamilton with steroid \r\n  injections, Dr. Owings operated on his back on July 28, 1994. Hamilton has not \r\n  worked since April, 1994. \r\n  \r\nHamilton's wife contacted Bob Bennett's \r\n  insurance carrier in either late 1993 or June of 1994 requesting additional \r\n  benefits. Dr. Owings advised the insurance representative in writing that the \r\n  herniated disc was causally related to the September, 1992, accident. By letter \r\n  dated November 1, 1994, the carrier informed Hamilton that it was denying his \r\n  claim for any future Workers' Compensation benefits. \r\n  \r\nOn December 9, 1996, Hamilton filed \r\n  a Form 50 alleging he was entitled to total disability or, in the alternative, \r\n  permanent partial disability, payment of medical treatment for herniated disc, \r\n  and temporary total disability benefits arising out of the admitted injury. \r\n  In its Form 51, Bob Bennett denied the claim asserting the \"[s]tatute of limitations \r\n  ha[d] run for filing [a] claim.\" The Single Commissioner found Hamilton's claim \r\n  was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The Full Commission and \r\n  the Circuit Court affirmed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\nI. Did the Circuit Court err in affirming \r\n  the Full Commission's finding the statute of limitations barred Hamilton's claim? \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII. Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n  affirming the Full Commission's ruling allowing the admission of certain hearsay \r\n  testimony? \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\nREVIEW \r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act \r\n  establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workers' \r\n  Compensation Commission.

In an appeal from the Commission, this Court may not substitute \r\n  its judgment for that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on \r\n  questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error \r\n  of law.

Union Bleachery/Cone Mills, 276 S.C. \r\n  454, 456, 280 S.E.2d 52, 53 (1981)(court may reverse or modify agency's decision \r\n  \"'if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative \r\n  findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are . . . affected by other error \r\n  of law.'\"); Lyles v. Quantum Chem. Co. (Emery), 315 S.C. 440, 434 S.E.2d \r\n  292 (Ct. App. 1993)(in reviewing decision of Workers' Compensation Commission, \r\n  Court of Appeals will not set aside its findings unless they are not supported \r\n  by substantial evidence or they are controlled by error of law). The appellate \r\n  court's review is limited to deciding whether the Commission's decision is unsupported \r\n  by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law. See Lark \r\n  v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981). \r\n  \r\nIn this case, the issue of whether \r\n  the statute of limitations bars Hamilton's claim is a question of law, rather \r\n  than of fact. See Mize v. Sangamo Elec. Co., 251 S.C. 250, 161 \r\n  S.E.2d 846 (1968); Lesley v. Lesley, 53 S.C. 44, 30 S.E. 635 (1898). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Statute of Limitations \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHamilton contends the Full Commission \r\n  erred in concluding his Workers' Compensation claim was time barred. He argues \r\n  the approved Form 15 satisfied the statute of limitations. We agree. \r\n  \r\n\"The right to compensation under \r\n  [the Workers' Compensation act] is barred unless a claim is filed with the [C]ommission \r\n  within two years after an accident.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. 1998). \r\n  In statutorily debarring stale claims filed by delinquent claimants, the General \r\n  Assembly established a bright line, time-oriented, all-encompassing defense. \r\n  The sometimes harsh and onerous statute of limitations defense has been ameliorated \r\n  by a commonsensical and practical approach emanating from our Supreme Court. \r\n  In a line of concatenated rulings beginning with Gold v. Moragne, 202 \r\n  S.C. 281, 24 S.E.2d 491 (1943), a doctrine has emerged which satisfies the mandate \r\n  of Â§ 42-15-40. \r\n  \r\nIn Gold, the employee fractured \r\n  his neck in a work related accident on May 27, 1938. Immediately after the accident, \r\n  the employee was given medical and hospital treatment by his employer and the \r\n  insurance carrier. No written instrument specifically designated as a claim \r\n  was filed with the Industrial Commission within the one year statute of limitations \r\n  in effect at the time. Instead, an agreement, which was dated July 20, 1938, \r\n  and signed by all the parties, was filed with and approved by the Industrial \r\n  Commission on July 22, 1938, less than sixty days after the accident occurred. \r\n  Pursuant to the agreement, the employee would receive weekly compensation until \r\n  terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Workmens' Compensation Act. \r\n  The agreement stated the date of the injury, the place and cause of the accident, \r\n  and the nature of the injury. \r\n  \r\nWeekly installments were paid up \r\n  to and including June 9, 1939, a little over a year after the accident, but \r\n  were then discontinued by the employer and insurance carrier. The employee hired \r\n  an attorney who scheduled a hearing. At the hearing, the employee moved to amend \r\n  the notice of hearing to include a claim for reasonable compensation for serious \r\n  bodily disfigurement. The motion was overruled on the ground that the employee \r\n  could call for another hearing on disfigurement at a later date. In an order \r\n  dated May 9, 1942, the employee was awarded a lump sum settlement for partial \r\n  disability. \r\n  \r\nOn August 7, 1940, the employee gave \r\n  written notice to the Commission requesting a hearing with reference to compensation \r\n  for disfigurement. For the first time, the employer and the insurance carrier \r\n  took the position that any claim for disfigurement was barred by the statute \r\n  of limitations. The Single Commissioner held the claim for compensation for \r\n  disfigurement was not barred by the statute of limitations. The Full Commission \r\n  affirmed. The Circuit Court, however, reversed finding the claim had not been \r\n  filed with the Commission within one year after the accident and was, thus, \r\n  barred by the statute of limitations. In reversing the decision of the Circuit \r\n  Court, the Supreme Court declared: \r\n  \r\nWhile it was unquestionably the purpose \r\n  of the limitations written in the Act to protect employers and insurance carriers \r\n  against \"long delayed demands,\" as stated in our case of Wallace v. Campbell \r\n  Limestone Company, 198 S.C. 196, 17 S.E.2d 309, 311, it is also evident \r\n  that this Section should be given a liberal construction, especially in view \r\n  of the fact that in all bona fide cases (except death cases) the claimant is \r\n  an injured person, and frequently must be confined in a hospital, as was the \r\n  claimant in this case. And moreover, many of the claimants are without counsel, \r\n  as was the claimant in this case until after the expiration of the one-year \r\n  period. Furthermore, the extent of the injury is not always immediately apparent; \r\n  nor was it in this case. \r\n  \r\nHence the Courts construing similar \r\n  statutory provisions are practically in accord in holding that these statutes \r\n  do not contemplate the filing of a claim having the same particularity as a \r\n  formal pleading or stating \"all the elements of a cause of action\"; and that \r\n  the law would be sufficiently complied with if the claim in whatsoever form \r\n  sets forth enough facts to apprise the employer of the time, place, and character \r\n  of the accident, and the general nature of the injury, so that it may be understood \r\n  that the claimant expects to receive the benefits provided by the Act. \r\nAnd it appears to have been held \r\n  in a number of jurisdictions that an agreement to pay compensation, \"filed with \r\n  and approved by the Commission, answers the statutory requirement that the claim \r\n  for compensation be made within a specified time, and the same has been held \r\n  to be so as regards an agreement filed with the board but not yet acted upon \r\n  by it.\" \r\n  \r\nWe think the sound principle just \r\n  announced applies with special force to the instant case, because the agreement \r\n  for compensation for temporary total disability, timely filed and approved as \r\n  hereinbefore stated, gives all the information that could reasonably be required \r\n  to be contained in a claim to be filed by or in behalf of an employee. . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGold, 202 S.C. at 288-89, \r\n  24 S.E.2d at 493-94 (citations omitted). \r\n  \r\nGold's employer argued the agreement \r\n  made no reference to any claim for disfigurement and, hence, could not be considered \r\n  as covering such a claim. The Gold Court rejected the Circuit Court's \r\n  conclusion Gold's claims for disability and disfigurement were separate and \r\n  distinct. Ruling the claim \"need not state all of the deleterious effects arising \r\n  out of the accident,\" the Court explained: \"[W]hen the Industrial Commission \r\n  has jurisdiction to pass on any element of compensation, all elements are included; \r\n  and it was not contemplated by the Act that different parts of the total result \r\n  of one accident should be regarded as separate claims.\" Gold, 202 S.C. \r\n  at 291, 24 S.E.2d at 494-95. \r\n  \r\nTwo years after Gold, the \r\n  Supreme Court decided Lowther v. Standard Oil Co., 206 S.C. 286, 33 S.E.2d \r\n  889 (1945). In Lowther, the employee, a sales agent for Standard Oil, \r\n  was injured in an admitted employment related accident on January 24, 1939. \r\n  The employer was immediately notified of the accident and provided a physician \r\n  to treat the employee. A written report of the accident was furnished to the \r\n  employer. On March 9, 1939, the parties executed an agreement titled \"Standard \r\n  Form No. 15 for Agreement as to Compensation\" which was provided by the Industrial \r\n  Commission. Id. at 288, 33 S.E.2d at 889. The agreement set out the facts \r\n  of the accident and provided the employee would receive a weekly compensation \r\n  rate \"'until terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation \r\n  Law of the State of South Carolina.'\" Id. The Form 15 was in the Industrial \r\n  Commission's file, although there was no notation thereon that it had been filed \r\n  nor was there any explanation of how it came into the possession of the Commission. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe employee, with the assistance \r\n  of his wife and son, continued to sell and distribute Standard Oil products \r\n  under the employee's sales agent contract. His gross earnings remained the same \r\n  as prior to his injury. Since there was no material difference in the employee's \r\n  gross earnings prior to and following his accident, the employer did not pay \r\n  out any amount under the Workmen's Compensation Act by reason of the employee's \r\n  disability. In September, 1939, the employer refused to renew the employee's \r\n  sales agent contract. One month later, the employer advised the employee that \r\n  it denied his entitlement to Workers' Compensation benefits. On February 6, \r\n  1940, the employee filed a claim for compensation. The employer asserted the \r\n  claim was barred because the employee had failed to file his claim with the \r\n  Commission within one year from the date of the accident. The Single Commissioner \r\n  agreed with the employer. The Full Commission and Circuit Court affirmed. On \r\n  appeal, the Supreme Court addressed whether the employee's claim was barred \r\n  by the \"Workmen's Compensation Act, the [employee] not having himself formally \r\n  filed claim with the Industrial Commission within one year from the date of \r\n  his injury.\" Lowther, 206 S.C. at 291, 33 S.E.2d at 890. \r\n  \r\nThe Lowther Court found: \r\n  \r\nHere, the employer (respondent) had \r\n  notice that [the employee] was claiming and would claim benefits under the Workmen's \r\n  Compensation Act; and information concerning the accident suffered by [the employee] \r\n  was forwarded to the Industrial Commission by [the employer], but it did not \r\n  \"file\" a claim on behalf of [the employee] with the Commission; and acting upon \r\n  information furnished by [the employer] in a letter to the Industrial Commission \r\n  on May 9, 1939, the Commission closed its \"file\" in respect to this accident. \r\n  So, it would appear that the [employer] had presumed to act for and on behalf \r\n  of the [employee] in the filing with the Industrial Commission of information \r\n  concerning his accident and injury; and the only source from which the Industrial \r\n  Commission could have received the Standard Form 15 for \"Agreement as to Compensation\" \r\n  was the [employer], and not the [employee]. \r\n  \r\nIf the \"Agreement as to Compensation\" \r\n  entered into by and between [the employee] and [the employer] is to be considered \r\n  as a \"Settlement\" (although no amount was paid thereunder as compensation, the \r\n  [employee's] earnings until his sales contract with [the employer] expired having \r\n  remained approximately the same), then Section 18 of the Workmen's Compensation \r\n  Act made it the duty of the [employer] to file a copy of this settlement agreement \r\n  with the Industrial Commission, and this provision of the Act was not complied \r\n  with by the [employer]. \r\n  \r\nUnder the circumstances of this case, \r\n  it seems to us that the [employer] is estopped from being advantaged by reason \r\n  of the fact that the [employee] did not formally file his claim with the Industrial \r\n  Commission within one year from the date of the accident, especially when this \r\n  Court has recognized the weight of authority to be that, under certain circumstances, \r\n  an employer may waive the filing by an employee of a claim in any form whatever. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLowther, 206 S.C. at 291-92, \r\n  33 S.E.2d at 891. \r\n  \r\nThe issue was revisited in Halks \r\n  v. Rust Eng'g Co., 208 S.C. 39, 36 S.E.2d 852 (1946). Halks, an employee \r\n  of Rust Engineering Company, suffered an admitted work related accident on April \r\n  21, 1941, when the scaffold on which he was working collapsed and he fell about \r\n  twenty feet to the concrete below. Halks spent over a month in the hospital. \r\n  The insurance carrier's claims adjuster visited Halks in the hospital and the \r\n  parties entered into an agreement \"in the usual form which provided for the \r\n  payment of compensation from the date of the injury 'until terminated in accordance \r\n  with the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Law.'\" Id. at 42, 36 \r\n  S.E.2d at 853. The Industrial Commission approved the agreement and awarded \r\n  compensation for temporary total disability. \r\n  \r\nOn May 29, 1941, one day before Halks \r\n  left the hospital, the employee's attorney requested the case be docketed and \r\n  set \"'for an early hearing.'\" Id. at 42, 36 S.E.2d at 853. The Commission, \r\n  noting Halks was drawing temporary total disability, responded a hearing would \r\n  be premature because Halks was still in the hospital. The carrier discontinued \r\n  the payments on October 6, 1941, based on Halks's doctor's statement that Halks \r\n  could return to work. Although Halks refused to sign a final settlement receipt, \r\n  the carrier closed the case. In a letter dated October 3, 1942, the carrier \r\n  informed the Commission that all compensation due had been paid. On August 12, \r\n  1943, Halks wrote the Commission requesting further compensation. \r\n  \r\nAt the hearing before the Commissioner, \r\n  the employer and carrier objected to the jurisdiction of the Commission on the \r\n  ground any further claim by Halks was barred because more than a year had elapsed \r\n  since the date of the last payment of compensation. The Commissioner overruled \r\n  the objection and awarded Halks compensation. The Full Commission and the Circuit \r\n  Court affirmed the award. \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, the employer argued that, \r\n  because it had closed the employee's file when it made the last payment of compensation \r\n  in January of 1942, any further claim for compensation was barred except on \r\n  the ground of a change in condition under Section 46 of the Workmen's Compensation \r\n  Act, which provided \"'no such review shall be made after twelve months from \r\n  the date of the last payment of compensation.'\" Id. at 44, 36 S.E.2d \r\n  at 854. The employer made no contention there was a failure to comply with Section \r\n  24(a) of the Act, which required a claim for compensation to be filed within \r\n  one year after the accident. Halks asserted he was not seeking review of an \r\n  award on the ground of a change in condition, but was seeking compensation on \r\n  his original claim. The Court held: \r\n  \r\n[Halks's] claim in the instant case \r\n  included not only compensation for temporary total disability, but also for \r\n  any permanent disability or disfigurement. This claim has never reached a final \r\n  hearing. There has been only an agreement as to compensation for temporary total \r\n  disability. Neither permanent disability nor disfigurement has ever been considered. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n. . . [W]e do not think the right \r\n  of a claimant to further compensation can be adjudicated without notice to him \r\n  and an opportunity afforded for a hearing, if he desires to contest the issue. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\n. . . \"A Claim for compensation lawfully \r\n  constituted and pending before the commission may not be dismissed without a \r\n  hearing and without some proper form of final adjudication. No statute of limitations \r\n  runs against a litigant while his case is pending in court.\" . . . [C]ases before \r\n  the Industrial Commission \"should be disposed of by some award, order, or judgment \r\n  final in its effect, terminating the litigation.\" \r\n  \r\nWe conclude that [Halks's] claim \r\n  for compensation was still pending before the Industrial Commission when it \r\n  made the award in question. Viewing the matter in this light, we think it is \r\n  clear that Section 46 is not applicable. [Halks] is not seeking to increase \r\n  or modify a previous award on the ground of a change in condition, but is asking \r\n  for a final determination of his original claim. . . . The situation is analogous \r\n  to that of a case pending in court which is allowed to remain on the calendar \r\n  for a long period of time without either party making any effort to secure a \r\n  final determination. The result of this conclusion is not, as suggested by [the \r\n  employer's] counsel, to permit a claim to remain pending indefinitely. . . . \r\n  \"[I]t was at all times open to the defendant (employer and carrier) to move \r\n  for a hearing, or to the Commission of its own motion, upon notice, to order \r\n  a hearing. But this was not done.\" \r\n  \r\nHalks, 208 S.C. at 45-47, \r\n  36 S.E.2d at 854-55. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn Gilliard v. Victor Monaghan \r\n  Co., 211 S.C. 68, 44 S.E.2d 109 (1947), the employee was injured in a work \r\n  related accident on February 14, 1941, a few days before his eighteenth birthday. \r\n  Ten days after the accident, the employee's father entered into an agreement \r\n  for the payment of compensation for temporary total disability. The Commission \r\n  approved the agreement. The employee turned eighteen on February 26, 1941. Payments \r\n  were made to the father who endorsed them over to the employee. In August of \r\n  1941, the Commission approved an agreement signed by the father regarding compensation \r\n  for specific loss. Additionally, the Commission made an award for disfigurement. \r\n  The checks for specific loss and disfigurement, each for more than $300, were \r\n  made payable to the father, who had not qualified as a guardian. The father \r\n  converted the proceeds of the checks to his own use, except for the amount of \r\n  the attorney's fee. \r\n  \r\nThe applicable provision of the Workmen's \r\n  Compensation Act in effect at the time allowed a parent or natural guardian \r\n  to receive up to $300 as compensation for injuries to minors and to acquit the \r\n  employer. Any amounts exceeding $300 were required to be paid to a guardian. \r\n  On July 5, 1945, the employee wrote the Commission requesting a hearing to fix \r\n  the amount of compensation for the February 14, 1941, accident. After a hearing, \r\n  the Commissioner held the employee \"was barred from recovery by the one year \r\n  limitation in that he had not filed his claim within twelve (12) months after \r\n  becoming eighteen (18) years of age, and that having elected to repudiate the \r\n  1941 proceedings was forever barred thereby, and dismissed the claim.\" Id. \r\n  at 70, 44 S.E.2d at 110. The Full Commission and the Circuit Court affirmed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, the employee argued the \r\n  lump sum payments for specific loss and disfigurement were void. He further \r\n  maintained all prior acts, such as the filing and acceptance of the claim and \r\n  payment thereunder for temporary total disability of amounts aggregating less \r\n  than $300, were valid. \r\n  \r\nIn reversing the Circuit Court, the \r\n  Gilliard Court relied on the Halks rule that \"[a] claim for compensation \r\n  lawfully constituted and pending before the commission may not be dismissed \r\n  without a hearing and without some proper form of final adjudication.\" Id. \r\n  at 75, 44 S.E.2d at 112. The Court found the employee's claim was properly filed \r\n  with the Commission, thereby vesting the Commission with subject matter jurisdiction. \r\n  The Court further ruled (1) the award and resulting payments for temporary total \r\n  disability were in order and binding upon all parties; (2) the August, 1941, \r\n  proceedings whereby an award and payments were attempted for specific loss and \r\n  disfigurement were voided at the election of the claimant because a guardian \r\n  had not been appointed as required by the Act; (3) the statute was tolled and \r\n  it was unnecessary for a new claim to be filed; and (4) the employee was entitled \r\n  to a hearing before the Commission for the purpose of ascertaining what award, \r\n  if any, he was entitled to as damages for specific loss and disfigurement arising \r\n  out of his work related injury. \r\n  \r\nMore recently, in Rogers v. Spartanburg \r\n  Regional Medical Center, 328 S.C. 415, 491 S.E.2d 708 (Ct. App. 1997), cert. \r\n  granted, January 22, 1998, this Court discussed the statute of limitations \r\n  issue. Rogers, an employee of Spartanburg Regional Medical Center (SRMC), injured \r\n  her back in an accident arising out of and in the course of her employment on \r\n  July 28, 1986. The employer voluntarily paid the employee's medical bills and \r\n  her salary for the two weeks she missed from work because of her injury. The \r\n  employee admitted she was paid Workers' Compensation benefits in 1986 and 1987. \r\n  She had continued medical problems requiring several surgeries. The employee \r\n  did not file a Workers' Compensation claim until July, 1993. \r\n  \r\nThe Single Commissioner found Rogers \r\n  did not sustain an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of her \r\n  employment. The Full Commission reversed the Single Commissioner, as SRMC conceded \r\n  the accident arose from Rogers' employment. SRMC challenged Rogers' claim arguing \r\n  it was barred by Â§ 42-15-40. The Commission found (1) Rogers was paid temporary \r\n  total disability in 1986; (2) the payment thereof constituted the filing of \r\n  the claim under Halks, supra; and (3) the claim was not barred \r\n  by the statute of limitations imposed by Â§ 42-15-40. The Circuit Court affirmed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, SRMC alleged Rogers' claim \r\n  was barred by the statute of limitations, Â§ 42-15-40. This Court enunciated: \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRogers' reliance on [Halks v. \r\n  Rust Eng'g Co., 208 S.C. 39, 36 S.E.2d 852 (1946), and Gold v. Moragne, \r\n  202 S.C. 281, 24 S.E.2d 491 (1943),] is misplaced. In both Halks and \r\n  Gold, the parties entered into written agreements which provided that \r\n  the employer would pay the employee benefits due to an injury. The Court in \r\n  each case held that the payment of workers' compensation benefits pursuant to \r\n  the terms of the agreements constituted \"filing\" even though no written instrument \r\n  specifically designated as a claim for the particular form of compensation sought \r\n  was filed with the commission within the one year statute of limitations applicable \r\n  at that time. Here, however, there exists no written agreement between the parties \r\n  providing for the payment of workers' compensation benefits. Thus, neither Halks \r\n  nor Gold is availing under the facts of this case. \r\n  \r\nRogers also refers this court to \r\n  the holding of Hopkins v. Floyd's Wholesale, 299 S.C. 127, 382 S.E.2d \r\n  907 (1989) for the proposition that an employer may be estopped from asserting \r\n  the statute of limitations if the employer induces a claimant to believe the \r\n  claim is compensable and will be taken care of without its being filed within \r\n  the period required by statute. In Hopkins, the Supreme Court affirmed \r\n  this court's holding that the statute of limitations was tolled during the period \r\n  of the employee's reliance. . . . Because Hopkins only provides that \r\n  the statute is tolled during the time of the employee's reliance, Rogers was \r\n  required to file a workers' compensation claim within two years of the date \r\n  of the last payment of benefits to her. Because there is no evidence that Rogers \r\n  filed a workers' compensation claim within two years after the date of the last \r\n  payment of benefits to her, we hold the trial court erred in failing to find \r\n  that her claim is barred by the statute of limitations. \r\n  \r\nRogers, 328 S.C. at 418-19, \r\n  491 S.E.2d at 710-11. \r\n  \r\nThe lead commentator in this country \r\n  on Workers' Compensation law posits the general rule: \"Even under a statute \r\n  that specifically requires the filing of a claim, most courts will accept as \r\n  the equivalent of a statutory claim any paper that contains the substance usually \r\n  supplied by a formal claim, although the form may be defective.\" 3 Arthur Larson \r\n  &amp; Lex K. Larson, Workers' Compensation Law Â§ 77A.31 (1998). A Form \r\n  15 gives all of the information that could reasonably be required to be contained \r\n  in a claim. \r\n  \r\nBob Bennett contends Gold \r\n  and its progeny are not applicable to this case because Hamilton signed a Form \r\n  17 stating he had returned to work without restriction on September 21, 1992. \r\n  It maintains the only issue before the Commission was the issue of temporary \r\n  total disability, with final adjudication pursuant to the Form 17. An employer \r\n  can submit a Form 17 to a claimant for signature \"[w]hen the claimant completes \r\n  fifteen calendar days of work, or fifteen days after the claimant agrees he \r\n  or she could have returned to work.\" 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-505(E) (Supp. \r\n  1998). Temporary compensation is terminated by the filing of the signed Form \r\n  17. Id. However, a signed Form 17 does not terminate an employee's \r\n  claim or affect his right to apply for future benefits. Id. Specific \r\n  language in Form 17 expressly preserves any right to future benefits by a claimant. \r\n  Here, the Form 17 was not approved by the Commission. Moreover, it was not, \r\n  as advanced by Bob Bennett, an order or judgment final in its effect terminating \r\n  litigation. \r\n  \r\nIn the case sub judice, \r\n  Hamilton and Bob Bennett executed a Form 15 agreement that was approved by the \r\n  Commission within four months of Hamilton's accident. The agreement contained \r\n  all of the information necessary for the filing of a claim. Furthermore, the \r\n  Form 17 did not have the effect of terminating Hamilton's claim. The Form 17 \r\n  clearly stated Hamilton had not given up the right to further compensation. \r\n  Once the Form 15 was timely filed and approved, the claim was established and \r\n  the statute of limitations could no longer pose a bar. \r\n  \r\nBob Bennett argues Henderson v. \r\n  West Point Pepperell, Inc., 279 S.C. 171, 303 S.E.2d 859 (1983), controls \r\n  in statute of limitations cases where a Workers' Compensation claimant signs \r\n  a Form 17 and returns to work. This reliance is misplaced. There is no reference \r\n  to a Form 17 in Henderson. Any contention otherwise is mere speculation. \r\n  Further, no other writing is mentioned in Henderson. There is no indication \r\n  of any agreement approved by the Commission. Henderson does not imply \r\n  that Form 17 changes anything. \r\n  \r\nAs an alternative ground for affirming \r\n  the Commission's decision to deny Hamilton's claim based on the statute of limitations, \r\n  Bob Bennett claims Hopkins v. Floyd's Wholesale, 299 S.C. 127, 382 S.E.2d \r\n  907 (1989),(1) governs because there was no Form \r\n  15 between the parties regarding a back injury so that \"the cases relied \r\n  on by [Hamilton] for the proposition that the filing of a Form 15 constitutes \r\n  the filing of a claim do not apply to the case at bar.\" This assertion is erroneous. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAccording to Hopkins, where \r\n  a claimant fails to file a claim within the limitations period and the employer \r\n  makes voluntary compensation payments that lead the claimant to believe his \r\n  claim will be honored, the two year statute of limitations period applicable \r\n  to Workers' Compensation claims is tolled during the period of the claimant's \r\n  reliance. The sole issue before the Hopkins Court was the appropriate \r\n  rule governing the period for timely filing of Workers' Compensation claims \r\n  following a reliance period. Here, it is unnecessary to apply tolling rules \r\n  because Hamilton satisfied the statute of limitations by means of the Form 15 \r\n  before the reliance period even began. \r\n  \r\nHopkins does not overrule \r\n  Gold. The two cases address different issues. In Hopkins, the \r\n  Supreme Court noted an employer may be estopped from asserting the statute \r\n  of limitations as a bar to subsequently filed Workers' Compensation suits if \r\n  by his conduct he has induced the claimant to believe the claim is compensable \r\n  and will be taken care of without its being filed with the Commission within \r\n  the limitations period. Neither this case nor Gold involves estoppel. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBob Bennett argues Hamilton's disability \r\n  to the back is not included in his claim because the Commission-approved Form \r\n  15 refers only to a hip and leg injury. Yet, when a claim is filed, all \r\n  elements of compensation are included. It was not contemplated by the Act that \r\n  different parts of the total result of one accident should be regarded as separate \r\n  claims. Gold v. Moragne, 202 S.C. 281, 24 S.E.2d 491 (1943). A compensation \r\n  claim embraces all of the eventual effects of a single accident. A claimant \r\n  may not know the full extent of his injury when the claim is filed. It is not \r\n  necessary that the claim state all of the injurious effects arising out of the \r\n  accident. Limiting the scope of the claim to the narrow injury listed in the \r\n  Form 15 would encourage gross overreaching. Although the Form 15 listed Hamilton's \r\n  injury as to his hip and leg only, the Form 15 is sufficient to initiate a claim \r\n  for injuries to his back, if the injuries to his back arose out of the same \r\n  accident.(2) \r\n  \r\nII. Hearsay \r\n  \r\nHamilton claims the Single Commissioner \r\n  erred in allowing a defense witness to testify a manager with Bob Bennett told \r\n  her in a 1994 telephone conference that he had not been notified of Hamilton's \r\n  continuing back problems. Because the issue will arise again on remand, we address \r\n  it for the guidance of the Commission. See Creech v. Ducane Co., \r\n  320 S.C. 559, 467 S.E.2d 114, 116 (Ct. App. 1995); American Security Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Howard, 315 S.C. 47, 431 S.E.2d 604, 609 (Ct. App. 1993). \r\n  \r\n\"'Hearsay' is a statement, other \r\n  than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered \r\n  in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Rule 801(c), SCRE; Hawkins \r\n  v. Pathology Assocs., 330 S.C. 92, 498 S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 1998). Hearsay \r\n  is generally inadmissible. Rule 802, SCRE. \r\n  \r\nBecause the testimony does not fall \r\n  within one of the established exceptions to the general rule that hearsay is \r\n  inadmissible, the evidence was not properly admitted. The testimony should not \r\n  be admitted at the hearing on remand. \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe hold a Form 15, filed with and \r\n  approved by the Commission, satisfies the statutory requirement of Â§ 42-15-40 \r\n  that a claim for compensation be filed within two years after the accident. \r\n  The Commission erred as a matter of law in holding this claim was barred. Accordingly, \r\n  we reverse the decision of the Circuit Court affirming the Full Commission's \r\n  order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED. \r\n  \r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1. Bob Bennett \r\n  relies on the case of Hopkins v. Floyd's Wholesale, 295 S.C. 154, 367 \r\n  S.E.2d 447 (Ct. App. 1988), which was decided by the Court of Appeals. In 1989, \r\n  the Supreme Court affirmed Hopkins. \r\n2. We take no \r\n  position on whether Hamilton will be able to prove his current ailments arose \r\n  out of the September, 1992 accident. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3005","title":"Vermeer Carolina's Inc. v.

The trial court granted Wood/Chuck's motion for summary \r\n  judgment. Vermeer appeals. We affirm. \r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\nWood/Chuck manufactured a machine \r\n  called a Model Series V Heavy Duty Chipper. On January 31, 1991, Causey purchased \r\n  a used chipper from Vermeer. Causey was using the machine to chip logs and branches \r\n  on August 21, 1992. At some point, Causey turned the machine off, but the rotor \r\n  blade continued to turn. As Causey brushed away the wood chips that were concealing \r\n  the rotor, the rotor amputated his right hand. \r\n  \r\nIn his complaint, Causey alleged \r\n  against Vermeer causes of action for breach of express and implied warranties, \r\n  strict liability, and negligence. Causey pleaded strict liability and negligent \r\n  design against Wood/Chuck. \r\n  \r\nOn June 26, 1995, the day the trial \r\n  was to begin, Causey requested a \"nonsuit with prejudice for all claims contained \r\n  in the complaint against Wood/Chuck Chipper Corporation.\" Over Vermeer's objection, \r\n  the court issued an order granting Causey's motion. Vermeer did not appeal this \r\n  order. \r\n  \r\nInstead of proceeding with the trial, \r\n  Vermeer and Causey settled the case. Under the terms of the settlement, Vermeer \r\n  made a lump sum payment to Causey of $200,000 and agreed to make monthly payments \r\n  of $926 to Causey for the next five years. The settlement check, which was dated \r\n  July 5, 1995, was posted to Causey's attorney's account on August 19, 1995. \r\n  Yet, the agreement was not fully executed until September 5, 1995. The settlement \r\n  agreement provided: \"This Agreement and Release shall be come [sic] effective \r\n  following execution by all parties.\" Causey, his wife, and his attorney signed \r\n  the agreement on August 14, 1995. Vermeer's counsel signed it on August 21, \r\n  1995. A representative of Vermeer's insurance carrier signed the agreement on \r\n  September 5, 1995. \r\n  \r\nVermeer instituted this action seeking \r\n  either indemnification or contribution from Wood/Chuck for the monies paid under \r\n  the Causey settlement agreement. Wood/Chuck answered averring a general denial, \r\n  various defenses, and a counterclaim under the South Carolina Frivolous Civil \r\n  Proceedings Sanctions Act. Wood/Chuck filed a motion for summary judgment, which \r\n  the trial court granted. \r\n  \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\nI. Did the trial court err in finding \r\n  Vermeer was not entitled to indemnification from Wood/Chuck? \r\n  \r\nII. Did the trial court err in holding \r\n  Causey's dismissal of Wood/Chuck with prejudice extinguished any right of contribution \r\n  Vermeer may have had against Wood/Chuck? \r\n  \r\nIII. Did the trial court err in ruling \r\n  Vermeer was not entitled to seek contribution or indemnification for its settlement \r\n  of the claim of Mrs. Causey? \r\n  \r\nIV. Did the trial court err in finding \r\n  Vermeer's action was barred by the statute of limitations? \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n  \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Baird v. Charleston County, \r\n  333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999); Young v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, \r\n  333 S.C. 714, 511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999); Rule 56(c), SCRCP. See also \r\n  Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 501 S.E.2d 746 (Ct. App. 1998)(trial \r\n  court should grant motion for summary judgment when pleadings, depositions, \r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with affidavits, \r\n  if any, show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as matter of law). In determining whether any triable \r\n  issue of fact exists, as will preclude summary judgment, the evidence and all \r\n  inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party. Strother v. Lexington County Recreation \r\n  Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998); Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. \r\n  426, 480 S.E.2d 455 (Ct. App. 1997). If triable issues exist, those issues must \r\n  go to the jury. Rothrock v. Copeland, 305 S.C. 402, 409 S.E.2d 366 (1991); \r\n  Young, supra. \r\n  \r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate \r\n  where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the \r\n  application of the law. Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 \r\n  S.E.2d 187 (1997); Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 334 S.C. \r\n  150, 511 S.E.2d 699 (Ct. App. 1999). All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences \r\n  arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving \r\n  party. Young, supra; Truck South, Inc. v. Patel, 332 S.C. \r\n  222, 503 S.E.2d 774 (Ct. App. 1998). Even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary \r\n  facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them, summary \r\n  judgment should be denied. Young, supra; Moriarty, supra. \r\n  However, when plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable \r\n  minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted. Young, supra; \r\n  Pye, supra. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Equitable Indemnification \r\n  \r\n  \r\nVermeer contends the trial court \r\n  erred in finding Vermeer was not entitled to indemnification from Wood/Chuck. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n  \r\nSouth Carolina has long recognized \r\n  the principle of equitable indemnification. See Stuck v. Pioneer Logging \r\n  Machinery, Inc., 279 S.C. 22, 301 S.E.2d 552 (1983); Addy v. Bolton, \r\n  257 S.C. 28, 183 S.E.2d 708 (1971). \"Indemnity is that form of compensation \r\n  in which a first party is liable to pay a second party for a loss or damage \r\n  the second party incurs to a third party. A right to indemnity may arise by \r\n  contract (express or implied) or by operation of law as a matter of equity between \r\n  the first and second party.\" Town of Winnsboro v. Wiedeman-Singleton, Inc. \r\n  (Winnsboro I), 303 S.C. 52, 56, 398 S.E.2d 500, 502 (Ct. App. 1990), \r\n  aff'd, 307 S.C. 128, 414 S.E.2d 118 (1992) (Winnsboro II)(citation \r\n  omitted). \r\n  \r\nTraditionally, courts have allowed \r\n  equitable indemnity in cases of imputed fault or where some special relationship \r\n  exists between the first and second parties. See Winnsboro I; \r\n  First General Servs. v. Miller, 314 S.C. 439, 445 S.E.2d 446 (1994). \r\n  Ordinarily, if one person is compelled to pay damages because of negligence \r\n  imputed to him as the result of a tort committed by another, he may maintain \r\n  an action over for indemnity against the person whose wrong has thus been imputed \r\n  to him. Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. Whetstone, 243 S.C. 61, 132 S.E.2d \r\n  172 (1963). This is subject to the proviso that no personal negligence of his \r\n  own has joined in causing the injury. Id. In Stuck v. Pioneer Logging \r\n  Machinery, Inc., 279 S.C. 22, 301 S.E.2d 552 (1983), our Supreme Court explained: \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe note that the modern trend concerning \r\n  the right to indemnity is to look to principles of equity. According to equitable \r\n  principles, a right of indemnity exists whenever the relation between the parties \r\n  is such that either in law or in equity there is an obligation on one party \r\n  to indemnify the other, as where one person is exposed to liability by the wrongful \r\n  act of another in which he does not join. \r\n  \r\nStuck, 279 S.C. at 24, 301 \r\n  S.E.2d at 553. \r\n  \r\nThe law of equitable indemnification \r\n  allows recovery of expenses when the act of the wrongdoer involves the innocent \r\n  defendant in litigation or places him in such relation with others as makes \r\n  it necessary to incur expenses to protect his interest. See Addy v. \r\n  Bolton, 257 S.C. 28, 183 S.E.2d 708 (1971). \"Expenses\" under the Addy \r\n  rule include any costs which are reasonably necessary to defend litigation or \r\n  otherwise protect the innocent party's interest. This Court, in Griffin v. \r\n  Van Norman, 302 S.C. 520, 397 S.E.2d 378 (Ct. App. 1990), determined settlement \r\n  costs were recoverable in a cause of action for indemnity. In Griffin, \r\n  Van Norman (home seller) employed an exterminator to provide a Wood Infestation \r\n  Report required by the Griffins (home buyers) before the sale of the house could \r\n  be complete. After the sale was consummated, the Griffins discovered the report \r\n  was false. The Griffins initiated an action alleging fraudulent representation \r\n  against Van Norman and the exterminating company. Van Norman filed a cross-claim \r\n  averring \"'any damage suffered by the Plaintiffs in this matter is due to the \r\n  negligence or misrepresentation of the [exterminator].'\" Each defendant separately \r\n  settled with the Griffins. The cross-claim proceeded to a trial before the judge \r\n  without a jury. The judge ruled in favor of Van Norman against the exterminator, \r\n  awarding judgment in the amount paid to the Griffins as settlement. This Court, \r\n  in affirming the trial court's award of indemnification to Van Norman, instructed: \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIt was the contention of the Exterminator \r\n  in the court below and here that the Exterminator and the Home Seller were joint \r\n  tortfeasors. The trial judge found that the Home Seller \"does not base her claim \r\n  against [the Exterminator] upon an alleged right of indemnification from joint \r\n  tortfeasors. Rather, she claims that any damages suffered by the Griffins were \r\n  the result of [the Exterminator's] sole negligence or misrepresentation.\" The \r\n  judge further found \"that the loss suffered by the Griffins [Home Buyers] was \r\n  occasioned solely by the wrong of the defendant [Exterminator].\" Furthermore, \r\n  he found \"there is no evidence that Van Norman [Home Seller] took an active \r\n  role in the alleged fraud perpetuated [sic] upon the Griffins.\" The evidence \r\n  proves conclusively that she had no knowledge that the certification was false. \r\n  The Exterminator submits no proof to the contrary. The findings and conclusion \r\nof the judge are amply supported by the evidence. \r\nWe hold that the cost of settling \r\n  a case is recoverable under the rule [of equitable indemnification] (1) if the \r\n  settlement is bona fide, with no fraud or collusion by the parties; (2) if, \r\n  in the circumstances, the decision to settle is a reasonable means of protecting \r\n  the innocent party's interest; and (3) if the amount of the settlement is reasonable \r\n  in light of the third party's estimated damages and the risk and extent of defendant's \r\n  exposure if the case is tried. \r\n  \r\nIn this case, all three elements \r\n  are satisfied. The settlement of Home Buyers' action was bona fide. The decision \r\n  to settle was reasonable in the circumstances, because it \"bought peace\" and \r\n  avoided a costly trial which might possibly result in a verdict adverse to the \r\n  Home Seller. Finally, the amount of settlement was reasonable. In all likelihood, \r\n  it was less than the costs and attorney's fees Home Seller would have incurred \r\n  in a defense at trial--even a successful defense. \r\n  \r\nGriffin, 302 S.C. at 522-24, \r\n  397 S.E.2d at 379-80. \r\n  \r\nThe case of Otis Elevator, Inc. \r\n  v. Hardin Constr. Co. Group, 316 S.C. 292, 450 S.E.2d 41 (1994), edifies \r\n  in regard to averments against parties and voluntary settlement activities: \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHardin Construction also argues Otis \r\n  Elevator was not entitled to indemnity because Smith sued Otis Elevator \"solely \r\n  in [Otis Elevator's] capacity as a manufacturer/seller of a defective product \r\n  rather than in its capacity as [Hardin Construction's] sub-contractor.\" In light \r\n  of Smith's allegation that Otis Elevator was negligent in \"failing to provide \r\n  an attendant or someone to oversee the use of the elevator,\" we find this argument \r\n  is without merit. \r\n  \r\nHardin Construction argues Otis Elevator \r\n  was not entitled to indemnity because Otis Elevator voluntarily paid Smith an \r\n  unreasonable settlement amount. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nAn innocent indemnitee who has been \r\n  sued by a third party may recover the cost of settling a case: \r\n  \r\n(1) if the settlement is bona fide, \r\n  with no fraud or collusion by the parties; (2) if, in the circumstances, the \r\n  decision to settle is a reasonable means of protecting the innocent party's \r\n  interest; and (3) if the amount of the settlement is reasonable in light of \r\n  the third party's estimated damages and the risk and extent of defendant's exposure \r\n  if the case is tried. \r\n  \r\nId. at 523, 397 S.E.2d at \r\n  380. \r\n  \r\nWhere, as here, the indemnitee gave \r\n  the indemnitor notice and an opportunity to participate in the litigation, the \r\n  indemnitee is not \"required to prove the plaintiff's actual liability \r\n  to recover the amount paid in settlement so long as the indemnitee proves that \r\n  he was potentially liable to the plaintiff.\" 42 C.J.S. Indemnity \r\n  Â§ 24, at 113-14 (1991)(emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nOtis Elevator, 316 S.C. at \r\n  296-97, 450 S.E.2d at 44. \r\n  \r\nWith certitude, we note this case \r\n  does not involve any application or analysis of contractual indemnity. Our review \r\n  of the South Carolina precedent extant on the law of equitable indemnification \r\n  reveals a trifurcated elemental analysis by the fact finder. For a party to \r\n  recover under a theory of equitable indemnification, three things must be proven: \r\n  (1) the indemnitor was liable for causing the Plaintiff's damages; (2) the indemnitee \r\n  was exonerated from any liability for those damages; and (3) the indemnitee \r\n  suffered damages as a result of the Plaintiff's claims against it which were \r\n  eventually proven to be the fault of the indemnitor. \r\n  \r\nEquitable indemnity cases involve \r\n  a fact pattern in which the first party is at fault, but the second party is \r\n  not. Town of Winnsboro v. Wiedeman-Singleton, Inc. (Winnsboro I), \r\n  303 S.C. 52, 398 S.E.2d 500 (Ct. App. 1990), aff'd, 307 S.C. 128, 414 \r\n  S.E.2d 118 (1992) (Winnsboro II). If the second party is also at fault, \r\n  he comes to court without equity and has no right to indemnity. Id. The \r\n  most important requirement for the finding of equitable indemnity is that the \r\n  party seeking to be indemnified is adjudged without fault and the indemnifying \r\n  party is the one at fault. See Addy v. Bolton, 257 S.C. 28, 183 \r\n  S.E.2d 708 (1971); Winnsboro I, supra. \r\n  \r\nUnder South Carolina law, there can \r\n  be no indemnity among mere joint tortfeasors. Scott v. Fruehauf Corp., \r\n  302 S.C. 364, 396 S.E.2d 354 (1990); Stuck v. Pioneer Logging Machinery, \r\n  Inc., 279 S.C. 22, 301 S.E.2d 552 (1983); Atlantic Coast Line R.R. v. \r\n  Whetstone, 243 S.C. 61, 132 S.E.2d 172 (1963). Parties that have no legal \r\n  relation to one another and who owe the same duty of care to the injured party \r\n  share a common liability and are joint tortfeasors without a right of indemnity \r\n  between them. Scott, supra. \r\n  \r\nTherefore, if Vermeer and Wood/Chuck \r\n  are joint tortfeasors, there is no right of indemnity. \"Joint tortfeasor\" refers \r\n  to \"[t]hose who act together in committing wrong, or whose acts if independent \r\n  of each other, unite in causing single injury\"; \"two or more persons jointly \r\n  or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property.\" Black's \r\n  Law Dictionary 839 (6th ed. 1990). To determine whether Vermeer and Wood/Chuck \r\n  are joint tortfeasors, we factually analyze the record. \r\n  \r\nThe trial court concluded the parties \r\n  were joint tortfeasors based solely on Causey's pleadings. The allegations of \r\n  the complaint are not determinative of whether a party has the right to indemnity. \r\n  See Griffin v. Van Norman, 302 S.C. 520, 522, 397 S.E.2d 378, \r\n  379 (Ct. App. 1990)(\"The Complaint serves merely as a background to this [indemnification] \r\n  litigation. Allegations in a Complaint denied in answer are evidence of nothing.\"). \r\n  See also First General Servs. v. Miller, 314 S.C. 439, 445 S.E.2d \r\n  446 (1994)(defendant's mere allegations in counterclaim as to negligence of \r\n  plaintiff may not defeat plaintiff's right to claim derivative liability); Jourdan \r\n  v. Boggs/Vaughn Contracting, Inc., 324 S.C. 309, 476 S.E.2d 708 (Ct. App. \r\n  1996)(allegations of complaint are not determinative of right to indemnity; \r\n  rather, such determination is based on evidence and facts found by fact finder). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA party opposing a summary judgment \r\n  motion on an indemnification claim, even though the motion is based primarily \r\n  upon the complaint, has the two-fold burden of demonstrating a genuine issue \r\n  of material fact regarding the opposing party's lack of liability and a genuine \r\n  issue of material fact regarding the moving party's liability. See Rule \r\n  56, SCRCP. See also Griffin, supra (where party seeking \r\n  indemnity was exonerated at trial from all liability and codefendant is found \r\n  liable, indemnity is allowed). The failure to meet this two-fold burden is fatal \r\n  to the indemnification claim. We find Vermeer did not meet this burden. \r\n  \r\nVermeer sold to Causey the used Wood/Chuck \r\n  Chipper which amputated his right hand. A seller's strict liability for a defective \r\n  product is set out in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 (1977): \r\n  \r\n(1) One who sells any product in \r\n  a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his \r\n  property is subject to liability for physical harm caused to the ultimate user \r\n  or consumer, or to his property, if \r\n  \r\n(a) The seller is engaged in the \r\n  business of selling such a product, and \r\n  \r\n(b) It is expected to and does reach \r\n  the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it \r\n  is sold. \r\n  \r\n(2) The rule stated in subsection \r\n  (1) shall apply although \r\n  \r\n(a) The seller has exercised all \r\n  possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and \r\n  \r\n(b) The user or consumer has not \r\n  bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court \r\n  addressed the issue of indemnification in a strict liability scenario in Stuck \r\n  v. Pioneer Logging Machinery, Inc., 279 S.C. 22, 301 S.E.2d 552 (1983). \r\n  In that case, Stuck, who was in the pulpwood business, purchased from Pioneer \r\n  Logging Machinery, Inc., a mechanical harvesting machine which was mounted on \r\n  a used International truck. In buying the piece of equipment, Stuck relied on \r\n  the assurances of Pioneer's agent that the truck was suitable for Stuck's intended \r\n  use, which included harvesting timber and moving upon highways from one timber \r\n  site to the next. When Stuck's agent attempted to drive the equipment to a job \r\n  site for the first time, the truck's rear axle shifted when the driver put on \r\n  the brakes, causing him to lose control and collide head on with an approaching \r\n  vehicle. The resulting collision killed the driver of the oncoming vehicle, \r\n  Mr. Hastings, and seriously injured the passenger, Mr. Woods. \r\n  \r\nHastings' administratrix (the third \r\n  party) brought a wrongful death action against Stuck (the second party) and \r\n  his driver. After a jury verdict for actual damages, Stuck gave Notice of Intent \r\n  to Appeal. Pending appeal, however, Stuck settled the suit for $97,000, an amount \r\n  less than the verdict. Additionally, Stuck settled Woods' claim for $47,000. \r\n  In both cases, Stuck requested Pioneer (the first party) to participate in the \r\n  suits, but Pioneer refused. Stuck \r\nthen initiated an action for indemnification \r\n  based on strict liability and breach of implied and express warranties. The \r\n  Supreme Court concluded: \r\n  \r\n[Stuck's] action is not based on \r\n  negligence. He asserts that [Pioneer] is liable on grounds separate from any \r\n  purported fault of his: [Pioneer] sold a defective product in an unreasonably \r\n  dangerous condition, and it breached its warranty that the truck was roadworthy. \r\n  This action is not based upon any claimed right of indemnity from a joint tortfeasor. \r\n  Rather, it is an action to recover damages sustained by [Stuck] from [Pioneer's] \r\n  failure to ensure the safe condition of the equipment it sold [Stuck]. Under \r\n  the facts of this case, [Stuck's] failure to discover and correct the latent \r\n  defects and correct [Pioneer's] breach of warranties cannot excuse the breach \r\n  and defeat [Stuck's] claim. \r\n  \r\nStuck, 279 S.C. at 24-25, \r\n  301 S.E.2d at 553. \r\n  \r\nThe legal relationship inter \r\n  sese of parties under a strict liability theory is explicated with exactitude \r\n  in Scott v. Fruehauf Corp., 302 S.C. 364, 396 S.E.2d 354 (1990), a products \r\n  liability case. Scott was injured when he attempted to place a mounted wheel \r\n  assembly on the axle of a trailer. The wheel rim and side ring explosively separated, \r\n  striking Scott in the head. \r\n  \r\nThe defective wheel assembly consisted \r\n  of a multipiece rim and a side ring both manufactured by Firestone Tire and \r\n  Rubber Company and sold to a trailer manufacturer. The rim and ring were not \r\n  designed to be used together. The trailer manufacturer sold Fruehauf the trailer \r\n  in question in a used condition. Fruehauf repaired and reconditioned the trailer, \r\n  including the tires, but did not break down the wheel assemblies for inspection. \r\n  Evidence indicates Fruehauf knew at the time that such wheel assemblies are \r\n  dangerous if assembled from mismatched parts. Fruehauf sold the trailer to Piedmont, \r\n  who then leased it to Scott's employer, a cement company. The incident in which \r\n  Scott was injured occurred two years later. \r\n  \r\nScott settled his claim against Firestone \r\n  for $675,000 with a guarantee of an additional $200,000 if he did not recover \r\n  against other parties. He commenced this action and received a verdict based \r\n  on strict liability and negligence against Fruehauf and strict liability only \r\n  against Piedmont. On appeal, Fruehauf contended the trial court erred in submitting \r\n  Piedmont's cross-claim for indemnification to the jury because there is no right \r\n  of indemnity between joint tortfeasors. Citing the rule there can be no indemnity \r\n  among mere joint tortfeasors, the Court enunciated: \r\n  \r\nParties that have no legal relation \r\n  to one another and who owe the same duty of care to the injured party share \r\n  a common liability and are joint tortfeasors without a right of indemnity between \r\n  them. Here, Fruehauf and Piedmont shared a common liability to the ultimate \r\n  consumer, Scott, under our strict liability law. Fruehauf and Piedmont each \r\n  contributed to the consumer's injury by selling a defective product. We hold \r\n  common law indemnification does not apply among joint tortfeasors in strict \r\n  liability. \r\n  \r\nScott, 302 S.C. at 371, 396 \r\n  S.E.2d at 358 (citations omitted)(footnote omitted). \r\n  \r\nAbsent a contractual provision whereby \r\n  the upstream manufacturer agreed to indemnify the downstream retailer, the retailer \r\n  cannot escape liability and, at the same time, prove the manufacturer negligently \r\n  designed or manufactured a product. Vermeer did not show there was a genuine \r\n  issue of material fact that Vermeer was not a joint tortfeasor, but was \r\n  the innocent defendant entitled to indemnification from Wood/Chuck. \r\n  \r\nClearly, if a seller of a product \r\n  is strictly liable simply by virtue of selling a defective product, then if \r\n  Vermeer is not strictly liable, neither is Wood/Chuck. See Scott, \r\n  supra. Applying Stuck and Scott to the facts of this case, \r\n  we hold Vermeer has no right of indemnification against Wood/Chuck as to the \r\n  strict liability cause of action. \r\n  \r\nII. Contribution \r\n  \r\nVermeer argues the trial court erred \r\n  in holding Causey's dismissal with prejudice of Wood/Chuck extinguished any \r\n  right of contribution Vermeer may have had against Wood/Chuck. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe common law rule against contribution \r\n  was abrogated in 1988 when our General Assembly enacted the South Carolina Uniform \r\n  Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-38-10 to -70 (Supp. \r\n  1998). Where two or more persons become jointly or severally liable in tort \r\n  for the same injury to person or property or for the same wrongful death, there \r\n  is a right of contribution among them even though judgment has not been recovered \r\n  against all or any of them. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-20(A) (Supp. 1998). The right \r\n  of contribution exists only in favor of a tortfeasor who has paid more than \r\n  his pro rata share of the common liability and his total recovery is limited \r\n  to the amount paid by him in excess of his pro rata share. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  15-38-20(B) (Supp. 1998). Section 15-38-40(D)(2) provides: \"If there is no judgment \r\n  for the injury or wrongful death against the tortfeasor seeking contribution, \r\n  his right of contribution is barred unless he has . . . agreed while action \r\n  is pending against him to discharge the common liability and has within one \r\n  year after the agreement paid the liability and commenced his action for contribution.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe basic premise of contribution \r\n  is commonality. Under the statute, \"common liability,\" rather than joint negligence, \r\n  determines the right to contribution. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-40(D) \r\n  (Supp. 1998). \"A tortfeasor who enters into a settlement with a claimant is \r\n  not entitled to recover contribution from another tortfeasor whose liability \r\n  for the injury or wrongful death is not extinguished by the settlement nor in \r\n  respect to any amount paid in a settlement which is in excess of what was reasonable.\" \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. 15-38-20(D) (Supp. 1998). \r\n  \r\nHere, Causey dismissed with prejudice \r\n  all causes of action against Wood/Chuck. The dismissal operates as an adjudication \r\n  on the merits terminating the action and concluding the rights of the parties. \r\n  See Freeman v. McBee, 280 S.C. 490, 313 S.E.2d 325 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\n  Because Wood/Chuck had been dismissed with prejudice, it could not be liable \r\n  to Causey for his injury. Vermeer did not extinguish any liability of Wood/Chuck \r\n  to Causey because no liability of Wood/Chuck to Causey existed to be extinguished. \r\n  In the same vein, there was no \"common liability\" that could have been discharged \r\n  by the settlement agreement. The only liability that could have been discharged \r\n  by the agreement was the potential liability of Vermeer to Causey. Vermeer could \r\n  not discharge what did not exist. \r\n  \r\nIII. Mrs. Causey's Potential Claim \r\n  \r\n  \r\nVermeer maintains the release of \r\n  Mrs. Causey's potential loss of consortium claim constitutes the \"discharge\" \r\n  of a \"common liability\" and, thus, the trial court erred in holding Vermeer \r\n  was not entitled to seek contribution or, in the alternative, indemnification \r\n  for its settlement of Mrs. Causey's claim. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nMrs. Causey never sued either Vermeer \r\n  or Wood/Chuck. She was not a party to the action brought by her husband. There \r\n  was no admission of liability concerning Mrs. Causey. Neither company was compelled \r\n  to pay anything to Mrs. Causey. When asked through Wood/Chuck's interrogatories \r\n  to set forth an itemized statement of all damages claimed to have been sustained, \r\n  Vermeer answered: \"The Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of the settlement \r\n  paid to Elbert Causey, Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00) and \r\n  Nine Hundred Twenty Six Dollars ($926.00) per month for five years, plus costs \r\n  and attorneys fees incurred in bringing this action.\" There is no claim for \r\n  and no mention in the Answers to Interrogatories of any payment having been \r\n  made to Mrs. Causey. Vermeer did not \"discharge\" any \"common liability\" as to \r\n  Mrs. Causey because there was no \"common liability.\" As a result, Vermeer was \r\n  not entitled to contribution from Wood/Chuck as to any potential claim by Mrs. \r\n  Causey. Further, regarding the alternative claim, Vermeer was not entitled to \r\n  indemnification as to Mrs. Causey. \r\n  \r\nThe South Carolina Uniform Contribution \r\n  Among Tortfeasors Act \"provides that a right of contribution exists in favor \r\n  of a tortfeasor who has paid more than his pro rata share of the common liability.\" \r\n  Wood/Chuck relies upon the lack of allocation of any payment from Vermeer's \r\n  insurance carrier to Mrs. Causey. The parties cite no South Carolina case involving \r\n  a settlement agreement among several parties with no allocation of damages. \r\n  On this point, the case of Houser v. Witt, 443 N.E.2d 725 (Ill. App. \r\n  Ct. 1982), is enlightening: \r\n  \r\nThe basis of the trial court's directed \r\n  verdict was that Witt could not prove his damages. The settlement agreement \r\n  between Witt, Dennis and Judith did not allocate the amount of the settlement \r\n  attributable to Judith's claim. Consequently, since Witt could not establish \r\n  the amount he paid in settlement of Judith's claim, there was no way to determine \r\n  the amount he paid on Judith's claim in excess of his pro rata share. . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn order for a party to be entitled \r\n  to contribution, he must allege and the evidence must show the amount he has \r\n  paid in excess of his just proportion of the joint indebtedness.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n. . . There is nothing in the Contribution \r\n  Act, nor in subsequent case law, to negate the proposition that one seeking \r\n  contribution must be able to establish the amount to which he is entitled. . \r\n  . . \r\n  \r\nWitt argues that the release provides \r\n  \"very good evidence\" of the amount paid to Judith, but he does not explain how \r\n  this amount may be deduced. It is evident from the record that Judith's immediate \r\n  injuries were much more severe than Dennis's, but this is no indication per \r\n  se that Dennis's injuries were negligible. The release provides that it covers \r\n  not only existing injuries, but also \"any and all known and unknown, foreseen \r\n  and unforeseen injuries\" for both Dennis and Judith. . . . In short, the open-end, \r\n  blanket, joint release gives no indication as to how the amount paid for the \r\n  release relates to any present or future damage to either party. In this case \r\n  lack of apportionment may work a hardship on Witt, but it is one which he could \r\n  have avoided by a properly drawn release. \r\n  \r\nHouser, 443 N.E.2d at 726-28. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe settlement agreement does not \r\n  place a specific value on any potential claim by Mrs. Causey. Under the agreement, \r\n  no portion of the settlement is allocated to her for any potential loss of consortium \r\n  claim. We cannot, therefore, determine whether Vermeer paid more than its pro \r\n  rata share of liability to Mrs. Causey. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-20(B) \r\n  (Supp. 1998)(right of contribution exists only in favor of tortfeasor who has \r\n  paid more than his pro rata share of common liability, and his total recovery \r\n  is limited to amount paid by him in excess of his pro rata share). \r\n  \r\nIV. Statute of Limitations \r\n  \r\nVermeer avers the trial court erred \r\n  in holding Vermeer's action was barred by the statute of limitations. As a supposed \r\n  basis for this contention, Vermeer references the following portion of the trial \r\n  court's order: \r\n  \r\nVermeer's settlement agreement with \r\n  the Causeys includes monthly payments extending into the year 2000. Vermeer \r\n  will not \"discharge\" this liability within one year of its agreement. Vermeer \r\n  will not discharge this liability within the period of limitations applicable \r\n  to the Causeys' right of action against it. The settlement agreement was not \r\n  even effective until the period of limitations had run. \r\n  \r\nVermeer's appellate brief questions \r\n  whether the trial court actually ruled on this issue: \"In granting summary judgment \r\n  . . ., the Court appeared to somehow reach the conclusion that Vermeer's claims \r\n  were barred by the statute of limitations.\" \r\n  \r\nAlthough the trial court mentioned \r\n  Vermeer did not \"'discharge' this liability within one year of its agreement,\" \r\n  apparently based on the five year monthly payments,(1) \r\n  the trial court did not rule Vermeer did not bring this action against Wood/Chuck \r\n  within the applicable one year period for seeking contribution under the Act. \r\n  No one disputes the claim against Wood/Chuck was brought within one year after \r\n  settling the case. We find no error. \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe hold Vermeer is not entitled to \r\n  indemnification. Further, we rule there is no contribution available to Vermeer \r\n  under the South Carolina Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act. Accordingly, \r\n  the order of the trial court granting summary judgment to Wood/Chuck is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1. We express \r\n  no opinion on whether an annuity provision affects the determination of whether \r\n  a tortfeasor discharged a common liability within one year. This issue was not \r\n  presented to the trial court. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3006","title":"State v.

We affirm. \r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\nFrederick Beasley, an employee of \r\n  the Motion Picture Association's film security office received a complaint that \r\n  Video Review of Myrtle Beach was selling or renting pirated video tapes. Thereafter, \r\n  on September 21, 1995, Beasley rented three videos from Video Review. Trained \r\n  to differentiate between legitimate and pirated videos through visual inspection \r\n  of their cassettes, Beasley determined each video he rented was pirated. Beasley \r\n  took the tapes to the Myrtle Beach Police Department. \r\n  \r\nOn October 5, Beasley returned the \r\n  three tapes to Video Review and rented three more tapes and purchased one tape. \r\n  Using the same visual inspection methods, he determined each of the four tapes \r\n  he obtained that day were also pirated. Beasley then took the tapes to Detective \r\n  John King of the Myrtle Beach Police Department. \r\n  \r\nOn October 25, Beasley accompanied \r\n  police officers to Video Review as they executed a search warrant. Beasley and \r\n  Ray Bowley, a contract employee of the Motion Picture Association, visually \r\n  examined the tapes in the inventory and found more than two hundred counterfeit \r\n  tapes. The majority of the counterfeit tapes were located in the new release \r\n  section. The Horry County Grand jury indicted Beam, the owner of Video Review, \r\n  with one felony count and two misdemeanor counts of transfer of recorded sounds.(1) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe judge qualified Beasley as an \r\n  expert in identifying the validity of video tapes. Beasley testified that a \r\n  legitimate film can be removed from its original cassette, placed in another \r\n  cassette, and still be a legitimate video. This might be done if the cassette \r\n  is damaged. If a cassette were changed, a visual examination of the cassette \r\n  could no longer determine whether the video was legitimate. During cross-examination, \r\n  Beam's counsel asked Beasley about a switch point test. Beasley stated that \r\n  a switch point test could be used to determine whether the film in a cassette \r\n  was legal or pirated. He stated that the test could be performed with a cross \r\n  pulse monitor, but that he had no expertise with that machine. \r\n  \r\nThe judge qualified Bowley as an \r\n  expert in trademark, copyright, and piracy issues. During cross-examination, \r\n  Beam's counsel also asked Bowley about the switch point test. Bowley was familiar \r\n  with the test and the machine used to conduct it. He stated an experienced technician \r\n  could determine absolutely whether the film was genuine or counterfeit. Beam's \r\n  counsel then asked whether Bowley performed a switch point test on the tapes \r\n  from Video Review. Bowley admitted not performing the test on any of the tapes. \r\n  The transcript then reflects the following: \r\n  \r\nQ: Okay. Well, this jury's got a \r\n  tough decision to make today. Don't you think that it would require you to do \r\n  that test if that's available to shut the door on whether or not you've got \r\n  a counterfeit tape or not when you've got that - - \r\n  \r\nA: Would you like for me to do it \r\n  now? \r\n\r\n  Have you got that technology available \r\n    to you?\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n  That can be done.\r\n    \r\n\r\nThe court: Right now? \r\n  \r\n[Defense Counsel]: Nothing further, \r\n  your honor. \r\n  \r\nThe court: It can be done right now? \r\n  With the equipment that's in the courtroom? \r\n  \r\nThe witness: It can be arranged to \r\n  be done this afternoon. \r\n  \r\n The assistant solicitor then asked \r\n  Bowley if he had the equipment to perform the test. Bowley stated that he did \r\n  and would be willing to perform the test. Bowley was permitted to perform the \r\n  test over defense objections. Additionally, the judge denied Beam's motion for \r\n  a mistrial. Bowley tested two tapes and determined both contained counterfeit \r\n  films. \r\n  \r\nThe jury returned guilty verdicts \r\n  on all three counts. The trial judge fined Beam $1,000 each for both of his \r\n  misdemeanor convictions. For the felony conviction, the judge sentenced Beam \r\n  to five years imprisonment and fined him $100,000, suspended upon service of \r\n  six months and payment of a $25,000 fine. He also ordered Beam to pay $6,197.97 \r\n  in restitution to the Motion Picture Association. This appeal follows.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. The Indictment \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBeam first argues on appeal that \r\n  the indictment against him did not provide the court with subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to convict him of the transfer of recorded sounds because the indictment did \r\n  not allege Beam acted with knowledge, which is an element of the charged offenses. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n  \r\nAn indictment is sufficient if the \r\n  offense is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the \r\n  court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he \r\n  is called upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction \r\n  thereon. The true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it \r\n  could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary \r\n  elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the \r\n  defendant of what he must be prepared to meet. \r\n  \r\nBrowning v. State, 320 S.C. \r\n  366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995) (citations omitted). An indictment phrased \r\n  substantially in the language of the statute which creates and defines the offense \r\n  is ordinarily sufficient. State v. Shoemaker, 276 S.C. 86, 275 S.E.2d \r\n  878 (1981). Further, the sufficiency of an indictment \"must be viewed with a \r\n  practical eye; all the surrounding circumstances must be weighed before an accurate \r\n  determination of whether a defendant was or was not prejudiced can be reached.\" \r\n  State v. Adams, 277 S.C. 115, 125, 283 S.E.2d 582, 588 (1981), overruled \r\n  on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn this case, the indictment names \r\n  the offense charged, lists the code sections Beam allegedly violated, alleges \r\n  that he rented, sold or caused to be rented or sold, seven counterfeit video \r\n  tapes, three on September 21, 1995, and four on October 5, 1995. This portion \r\n  of the indictment, which consists of the first and second counts, lists the \r\n  movies allegedly rented or sold. The third count of the indictment alleges Beam \r\n  possessed for the purpose of selling, renting, or causing to be sold or rented, \r\n  more than one hundred counterfeit video tapes. We believe the indictment stated \r\n  the offenses with sufficient certainty and particularity to allow both the judge \r\n  and Beam to know what offenses were alleged. The indictment was sufficient to \r\n  enable the court to know what judgment could be pronounced and to put Beam on \r\n  notice of what he was being called to answer. Despite Beam's claim that the \r\n  mens rea element was omitted from the indictment, we find the indictment \r\n  was sufficient, particularly in light of the fact the statutory citations were \r\n  included, thereby incorporating the knowledge element. In weighing the surrounding \r\n  circumstances with a \"practical eye,\" we find Beam had the requisite notice \r\n  for which indictments are intended, and he suffered no prejudice. However, we \r\n  caution it is indeed the better drafting practice to specifically allege each \r\n  element of the offense and include statutory or common law citations. Under \r\n  the facts of this case we decline to hold the circuit court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction. \r\n  \r\nII. The Switch \r\n  Point Test \r\n  \r\nBeam also argues several exceptions \r\n  claiming the trial judge abused his discretion in allowing Bowley to perform \r\n  the switch point test. Specifically he complains the trial judge improperly \r\n  questioned Bowley, that allowing Bowley to perform the test was error, and that \r\n  Beam was denied both the opportunity to effectively cross-examine Bowley and \r\n  to present an expert witness on the switch point test. We find no error. \r\n  \r\nA. Denial of Effective \r\n  Cross-Examination \r\n  \r\nBeam first contends that, by allowing \r\n  the test to be conducted, the trial judge denied him the opportunity to effectively \r\n  cross-examine Bowley. He asserts that the only way he could have avoided the \r\n  test being conducted would have been to avoid questioning Bowley regarding his \r\n  failure to use the test, thus depriving him of meaningful cross-examination \r\n  of the witness. We find absolutely no merit to this argument. Counsel clearly \r\n  made a tactical decision to question the State's expert regarding the available \r\n  technology. Counsel simply asked that proverbial \"one question too many\" and \r\n  is dissatisfied with the result from taking that risk. \r\n  \r\nB. Beam's Opportunity \r\n  to Present an Expert Witness \r\n  \r\nBeam also complains he was denied \r\n  the opportunity to present his own expert witness. He notes he learned of the \r\n  switch point test the morning of the commencement of the trial and, had he been \r\n  aware of the test before trial, he would have obtained his own expert witness \r\n  on the test. \r\n  \r\nBeam never asked for a continuance \r\n  or requested he be given the opportunity to present his own expert witness. \r\n  This issue is therefore not preserved for appellate review. See State \r\n  v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 498 S.E.2d 642 (1998) (issue of whether trial \r\n  judge committed error in not allowing recess procedurally barred where counsel \r\n  never actually requested recess). \r\n  \r\nC. Judge's Questions \r\n  to Bowley \r\n  \r\nBeam next complains the trial judge \r\n  improperly questioned Bowley, interfering with his right to meaningfully cross-examine \r\n  the witness. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nGenerally, the conduct of a criminal \r\n  trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the presiding judge and the \r\n  appellate court will not interfere unless it clearly appears that the rights \r\n  of the complaining party were abused or prejudiced in some way. State v. \r\n  Bridges, 278 S.C. 447, 298 S.E.2d 212 (1982). \r\n  \r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in \r\n  the judge's questions to Bowley. When Bowley indicated he could perform the \r\n  switch point test, the judge asked, \"Right now? . . . It can be done right now? \r\n  With the equipment that's in the courtroom?\" The judge simply wanted to clarify \r\n  Bowley's answer. There is no indication these questions in any way deprived \r\nBeam of meaningful cross-examination.\r\nD. Unfair Surprise \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFinally, Beam complains by allowing \r\n  Bowley to perform the test, Beam was unfairly surprised and denied the opportunity \r\n  to adequately prepare for and conduct cross-examination. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nBeam cannot complain about the admission \r\n  of evidence where he opened the door to the evidence. See State v. Robinson, \r\n  305 S.C. 469, 409 S.E.2d 404 (1991) (where appellant opened door to evidence, \r\n  he cannot complain of prejudice from its admission); State v. Sullivan, \r\n  277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981) (appellant cannot complain of prejudice from \r\n  admission of evidence if he opened the door to its admission). Further, when \r\n  a party introduces evidence about a particular matter, the other party is entitled \r\n  to explain it or rebut it, even if the latter evidence would have been incompetent \r\n  or irrelevant had it been offered initially. State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. \r\n  508, 316 S.E.2d 395 (1984). A party may not complain of error caused by his \r\n  own conduct. Id. \r\n  \r\nOnce Beam's counsel questioned Bowley \r\n  about the existence of the switch point test, its superiority over visual inspection \r\n  in the detection of counterfeit videos, and whether the State should have been \r\n  required to perform the test on the seized videotapes, the State was free on \r\n  redirect to ask whether the test could be performed. Beam's counsel's questions \r\n  directly attacked the expert's testimony that the seized videos were counterfeit. \r\n  The State asked Bowley to perform the test, in part, to rehabilitate him. The \r\n  scope of redirect is a matter of the trial court's discretion. Stroman, \r\n  281 S.C. at 513, 316 S.E.2d at 399. Because Beam opened the door to this evidence, \r\n  the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing Bowley to perform the \r\n  test. \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Beam's \r\n  convictions for the transfer of recorded sounds are \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nHEARN and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1.  The number \r\n  of items containing transferred recorded sounds that a person possesses, rents, \r\n  or sells controls whether it is a misdemeanor or a felony. For audio-visual \r\n  items, if more than 64 items are involved, the crime is a felony. S.C. Code \r\n  Ann.

Pope, of York, for respondent. \r\n________ \r\n  \r\nHUFF, J: Otis Smith appeals \r\n  his convictions for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute and \r\n  possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute within the proximity of \r\n  a park. We remand for an in camera hearing. \r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\nJ.C. Hall testified Smith sold him \r\n  some crack cocaine on the morning of February 26, 1996. Hall became sick that \r\n  afternoon and called the Rock Hill Police Department to report he knew someone \r\n  who was selling cocaine. \r\n \r\nThe police arranged for Hall to make \r\n  a controlled buy of crack cocaine later that day. Officers searched Hall and \r\n  gave him forty dollars to make a purchase. Hall returned and gave officers what \r\n  he believed to be crack cocaine. He testified he made the purchase from Smith. \r\n  Officers sent the substance Hall purchased to SLED, where an expert in chemical \r\n  analysis found it to be crack cocaine. \r\n  \r\nThe grand jury indicted Smith on \r\n  one count each of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute and \r\n  possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute within the proximity of \r\n  a park. The case was first called to trial on August 27, 1996. At that trial, \r\n  the judge held an in camera hearing at which time Hall identified Smith \r\n  as the person from whom he purchased crack cocaine on February 26, 1996. The \r\n  judge permitted Hall to identify Smith in the jury's presence. That proceeding, \r\n  however, ended in a mistrial because of the admission of other evidence. \r\n  \r\nSmith appeared for retrial before \r\n  the same judge on September 12, 1996. Smith requested what the judge perceived \r\n  as a hearing on the in-court identification.(1) \r\n  He claimed Hall's identification was tainted on the first day of retrial when \r\n  Hall saw Smith in a holding cell, wearing civilian clothes \"in plain view in \r\n  the midst of people wearing jail coveralls.\" The trial judge asked, \"Is there \r\n  some reason after that mistrial was granted that his mind was wiped clean, that \r\n  the identification is out of the window? I'm not sure I follow you. He has already \r\n  identified him.\" After Smith argued Hall made only a hesitant identification \r\n  in the first trial, the judge ruled Smith was not entitled \"to have another \r\n  hearing\" because Hall identified Smith in the prior proceeding. \r\n  \r\nDuring his cross-examination, Smith's \r\n  counsel asked Hall about Hall's history of buying and selling drugs. Smith's \r\n  counsel asked Hall, \"Sometimes you would buy a thousand dollars worth at once?\" \r\n  Hall responded, \"I was getting about three hundred from him.\" Smith's counsel \r\n  then requested Hall's response be stricken as non-responsive to the question \r\n  asked. The court overruled the objection. \r\n  \r\nThe jury found Smith guilty on both \r\n  counts. The judge sentenced Smith to two concurrent twelve year terms and fined \r\n  him $10,000. This appeal follows. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Identification \r\n  Hearing \r\n  \r\nSmith first argues the trial judge \r\n  erred by refusing to allow Smith to present new evidence that Hall's identification \r\n  was tainted. He argues Hall's identification testimony during the first trial \r\n  was nugatory because of the mistrial and the trial judge should have held a \r\n  new hearing. We agree. \r\n  \r\n\"A mistrial is the equivalent of \r\n  no trial and leaves the cause pending in the circuit court.\"  Grooms v. Zander, \r\n  246 S.C. 512, 514, 144 S.E.2d 909, 910 (1965). A mistrial leaves the parties \r\n  \"as though no trial had taken place.\" Id.; see also Floyd v. \r\n  Page, 124 S.C. 400, 117 S.E. 409 (1923) (holding rulings of trial judge \r\n  in proceeding ending in mistrial are not appealable because they represent no \r\n  binding adjudication upon the parties as the mistrial leaves the parties in \r\n  statu quo ante). A court ruling as to admissibility and competency of \r\n  testimony during a trial which is later declared a mistrial results \"in no binding \r\n  adjudication of the rights of the parties.\" Keels v. Powell, 213 S.C. \r\n  570, 572, 50 S.E.2d 704, 705 (1948). \r\n  \r\nWhere there is an issue as to whether \r\n  or not an in-court identification by a witness is of independent origin and \r\n  based upon observations of a suspect other than in the course of any improper \r\n  confrontation or line-up, the defendant is entitled to an in camera hearing. \r\n  State v. Williams, 258 S.C. 482, 485, 189 S.E.2d 299, 300 (1972). Thus, \r\n  our supreme court has \"adopted a per se rule requiring the court to hold \r\n  an in camera hearing when the state offers witnesses whose testimony \r\n  identifies the defendant as the person who committed the crime and the defendant \r\n  challenges the in-court identification as being tainted by a previous illegal \r\n  identification.\"  State v. Simmons, 308 S.C. 80, 82-83, 417 S.E.2d 92, \r\n  93 (1992) (citing State v. Cash, 257 S.C. 249, 185 S.E.2d 525 (1971)). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBecause a mistrial is the equivalent \r\n  of no trial, the trial judge could not rely on any evidentiary rulings from \r\n  the nugatory proceeding. Smith was entitled to an in camera hearing on \r\n  the in-court identification, and the trial judge erred in denying such. It does \r\n  not necessarily follow, however, that Smith is entitled to a new trial. Rather, \r\n  the proper remedy is a remand for an in camera hearing to determine whether, \r\n  under the circumstances of this case, Hall's identification was so tainted that \r\n  it should be suppressed. State v. Simmons, supra; State v. Williams, \r\n  supra. \r\n  \r\nII. Non-Responsive \r\n  Testimony \r\n  \r\nSmith also argues the trial judge \r\n  erred in refusing to strike Hall's non-responsive answer to a question about \r\n  Hall's history as a drug dealer. He contends Hall's testimony was inadmissible \r\n  evidence of a prior bad act by appellant, and he is entitled to a new trial \r\n  on the basis of this erroneous admission. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nThe decision whether to strike a \r\n  witness' answer as non-responsive is within the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  judge. Anders v. Nash, 256 S.C. 102, 180 S.E.2d 878 (1971). Absent an \r\n  abuse of discretion, the judge's refusal to strike a response that might have \r\n  been properly stricken is not error. Id. \r\n  \r\nIn response to the question of whether \r\n  Hall would sometimes buy as much as one thousand dollars worth of crack cocaine \r\n  at one time, Hall stated he \"was getting about three hundred from him.\" A reading \r\n  of the record does not disclose that Hall was necessarily referring to Smith \r\n  when he said he was buying the drugs \"from him.\" Assuming, however, that Hall \r\n  was referring to Smith, we find no prejudice. See State v. Mizell, \r\n  332 S.C. 273, 504 S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 1998) (in order to obtain new trial based \r\n  upon erroneous admission of evidence, appellant must demonstrate both error \r\n  and prejudice). The reference to Smith as the seller was vague, at best. Further, \r\n  cumulative evidence of Smith's selling drugs was elicited from Smith's girlfriend, \r\n  who testified she observed Smith selling drugs from the house on the day in \r\n  question. While the trial judge may have properly stricken Hall's response, \r\n  we find no abuse of discretion in his refusal to strike it. \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we remand \r\n  the case to the circuit court for an in camera hearing to determine whether \r\n  Hall's identification of Smith should be suppressed. \r\n  \r\nREMANDED. \r\n  \r\nHEARN and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1.  Smith's counsel \r\n  stated \"I did want to re-open number 9 and the new grounds for that being . \r\n  . .\" The reference to number 9 is not clear from the record; however, the judge \r\n  interpreted it as a request for an identification hearing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3008","title":"Ballenger v.

The matter was referred to \r\n  the master-in-equity with direct appeal to the South Carolina Supreme Court. \r\n  The master held the annexation was valid and effective. Ballenger appeals. We \r\n  affirm. \r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\nIn 1995, the City sought to annex \r\n  property, including that owned by Ballenger, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-3-150. \r\n  To annex the property, the Town needed at least 75% of the freeholders within \r\n  the area to be annexed, who owned at least 75% of the assessed valuation of \r\n  the property in the area, to petition the City for annexation. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-3-150(1) (Supp. 1998). The tax records indicated one parcel \r\n  of property in the area to be annexed was owned by Vester and Clara Kelly. Vester \r\n  Kelly, however, had passed away in 1991, before the annexation attempt. He left \r\n  as his intestate heirs his wife, Clara Kelly, his daughter, Florine Rookard, \r\n  and his grandson, Douglas Wright. His estate had not been probated. Larry Bagwell, \r\n  an employee of the City of Inman, brought the petition to the house of Florine \r\n  Rookard, where Clara Kelly resided. \r\n  \r\n At the time of the attempted annexation, \r\n  Kelly was in her late nineties and was bedridden.(1) \r\n  Rookard took the petition to her mother in the bedroom, while Bagwell waited \r\n  in the living room. Bagwell knew Kelly was too feeble to come to the living \r\n  room, but he did not know her state of mind that day. Rookard explained the \r\n  petition to her mother. Kelly placed an \"X\" on the signature line. Rookard returned \r\n  to the living room and signed Kelly's name beside the \"X.\" Rookard and her nephew, \r\n  Douglas Wright, then signed the petition. Although Rookard and Wright's names \r\n  were not listed on the tax records, they owned a greater than one-tenth undivided \r\n  possessory interest in the property with Kelly. \r\n  \r\nThere were ten freeholders whose \r\n  names appeared on the tax records as owning property in the area to be annexed. \r\n  Ten people, including Rookard and Wright, signed the petition. The City accepted \r\n  the petition and annexed the area in an ordinance ratified September 25, 1995. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn her challenge to the annexation, \r\n  Ballenger asserted, because Rookard and Wright's names were not included in \r\n  the tax records, they did not qualify as freeholders under the statute. She \r\n  further asserted Kelly lacked mental capacity, making her signature invalid. \r\n  Ballenger argued, if Kelly's signature were invalid, the petition would contain \r\n  only seven of the ten freeholders and would not meet the seventy-five percent \r\n  criteria of the statute. The City argued that Rookard and Wright should be considered \r\n  freeholders. Accordingly, even if the court determined Kelly's signature should \r\n  be excluded, the petition met the requirements of Â§ 5-3-150(1). The master found \r\n  the evidence presented was insufficient to establish that Kelly was incompetent, \r\n  and held the annexation ordinance was valid. He declined to address the City's \r\n  argument on Rookard and Wright's status as freeholders. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. Standard of Review \r\n  \r\nSection 5-3-150(1)(5) provides in \r\n  part that a person owning property or residing in the area to be annexed, such \r\n  as Ballenger, \"may institute and maintain a suit in the court of common pleas, \r\n  and in that suit the person may challenge and have adjudicated any issue raised \r\n  in connection with the proposed or completed annexation.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-3-150 \r\n  (Supp. 1998). The characterization of a declaratory judgment suit as either \r\n  equitable or legal depends on the nature of the underlying controversy. Felts \r\n  v. Richland County, 299 S.C. 214, 383 S.E.2d 261 (Ct. App. 1989), aff'd \r\n  303 S.C. 354, 400 S.E.2d 781 (1991). In order to determine the standard of review \r\n  to apply, we must look to the kind of action in which the issue involved would \r\n  have been decided if there were no declaratory judgment procedure. Id.; \r\n  see also Pinckney v. City of Beaufort, 296 S.C. 142, 370 S.E.2d 909 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1988) (where relief sought was invalidation of an ordinance based \r\n  on boundary line, court must determine boundary line, an issue at law; accordingly, \r\n  action was reviewed as one at law). \r\n  \r\nBallenger seeks a determination that \r\n  Kelly lacked mental capacity when she signed the petition. It is a well-settled \r\n  doctrine in this state that the courts of equity take special charge of persons \r\n  non compos mentis. Shepard v. First American Mortgage Company, 289 \r\n  S.C. 516, 347 S.E.2d 118 (Ct. App. 1986). \"Persons of unsound mind, like infants, \r\n  are under the special protection of the courts of equity with respect to their \r\n  persons, property, and legal transactions.\" Id. at 518, 347 S.E.2d \r\n  at 119; see, e.g., Vereen v. Bell, 256 S.C. 249, 182 S.E.2d \r\n  296 (1971) (action to rescind and cancel a deed on the ground of mental incapacity \r\n  of grantor is equitable); Atkinson v. Belser, 273 S.C. 296, 255 S.E.2d \r\n  852 (1979) (action to set aside conveyances alleging fraud, undue influence \r\n  and inadequate consideration reviewed as action in equity); but see In re \r\n  Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. 251, 495 S.E.2d 454 (Ct. App. 1997) (action to \r\n  set aside will on ground of testator's incapacity is at law). \r\n  \r\nThe dispositive question in this \r\n  case concerns whether Kelly was competent to sign the petition for annexation. \r\n  We thus find this action sounds in equity. Accordingly, we may find facts in \r\n  accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Townes \r\n  Assoc., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976). \r\n  However, we will not disregard the findings of the master who saw and heard \r\n  the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility. Tiger, \r\n  Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301 S.C. 229, 391 S.E.2d 538 (1989). \r\n  \r\n2. Validity of Kelly's Signature \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA municipal corporation's annexation \r\n  of land is a legislative function with which the courts rarely interfere. Bryant \r\n  v. City of Charleston, 295 S.C. 408, 368 S.E.2d 899 (1988). A proceeding \r\n  resulting in annexation is presumptively valid. Elwood Construction Co. \r\n  v. Richards, 265 S.C. 228, 217 S.E.2d 769 (1975). The burden is upon the \r\n  party attacking the annexation to show that there has not been a compliance \r\n  with the law. \r\n  \r\nIn addition, as the party challenging \r\n  Kelly's capacity, Ballenger has the burden of proving Kelly lacked capacity \r\n  at the time she signed the annexation petition. Eagles v. South Carolina \r\n  National Bank, 301 S.C. 402, 392 S.E.2d 187 (Ct. App. 1990); Rogers \r\n  v. Nation, 284 S.C. 330, 326 S.E.2d 182 (Ct. App. 1985). The concept of \r\n  mental incapacity is one of degree. A person may have sufficient mental capacity \r\n  to transact some types of business and not others. Lewis v. Lewis, \r\n  199 S.C. 490, 20 S.E.2d 107 (1942). The mere fact that a person's mind has been \r\n  weakened by old age, accident, or disease is not sufficient to show that he \r\n  or she lacks mental capacity. Id.; see also Vereen, 256 S.C. \r\n  at 251-252, 182 S.E.2d at 297 (\"Mere infirmity of mind or body, not amounting \r\n  to incapacity to understand the nature of the act, is insufficient to render \r\n  a deed void.\"). In order to warrant the cancellation of a legal transaction \r\n  on the basis of the grantor's mental incapacity, it must appear that the grantor \r\n  was so incompetent as to fail to comprehend the nature of his act. Atkinson \r\n  v. Belser, supra. \r\n  \r\nRookard's testimony was the only \r\n  evidence of Kelly's capacity at the time she placed her mark on the annexation \r\n  petition.

Rookard testified that she explained the petition to her mother \r\n  and her mother \"[sat] there and listened.\" Kelly nodded at the explanation, \r\n  but did not comment on the petition. When asked if her mother understood the \r\n  explanation, Rookard responded, \"Well I thought that she did. I explained it \r\n  to her real good.\" Rookard later testified that she did not know if her mother \r\n  understood her explanation. Ms. Rookard was 79 years old at the time of the \r\n  hearing and admitted to having a hard time remembering. \r\n  \r\nWe agree with the master that Rookard's \r\n  testimony was inconclusive regarding her mother's capacity to understand the \r\n  petition for annexation.

Food Lion appeals. We reverse. \r\n  \r\nI. \r\n  \r\nAt approximately 10:30 a.m. on December \r\n  24, 1994, Wintersteen slipped and fell on a puddle of clear liquid in a Food \r\n  Lion grocery store. Wintersteen was walking near a self-service soda fountain \r\n  equipped with an ice dispenser when the fall occurred. As a result of the fall, \r\n  Wintersteen suffered a back injury and eventually underwent surgery for herniated \r\n  disks. \r\n  \r\nAt trial, Wintersteen testified that \r\n  she did not know what she had fallen in and that she did not know how the liquid \r\n  had gotten on the floor or how long it had been there. Although two Food Lion \r\n  employees testified that they had in the past seen ice bounce from the ice machine \r\n  onto the floor, there was no testimony establishing that any Food Lion employee \r\n  saw anything on the floor before Wintersteen's fall, nor was there any other \r\n  evidence establishing how long the liquid had been on the floor. \r\n  \r\nBryan Durig, a mechanical engineer, \r\n  testified on Wintersteen's behalf. Durig testified that, based on his investigation \r\n  and review of various depositions, interrogatories, and photographs, the liquid \r\n  upon which Wintersteen slipped \"was most likely or most probabl[y] ice from \r\n  the drink machine that spilled on the floor in this area.\" According to Durig, \r\n  ice from self-service dispensers frequently bounces off the grate over the dispenser's \r\n  drain and onto the floor, where \"it will sit on the floor and melt and leave \r\n  puddles of water in that area in front of the drink machine.\" Durig described \r\n  the self-service drink and ice machine as a \"hazard,\" and testified that easiest \r\n  way to eliminate the hazard was by putting a mat in front of the machine. Durig \r\n  also recommended more frequent inspections of the area by Food Lion employees. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt the close of Wintersteen's case, \r\n  Food Lion moved for a directed verdict on the issue of liability. Food Lion \r\n  contended that Wintersteen presented no evidence establishing that any Food \r\n  Lion employee had actual or constructive notice of the presence of water or \r\n  ice on the floor prior to the accident. The trial court denied the motion, concluding \r\n  that Food Lion, by providing its customers with a self-service soda fountain \r\n  equipped with an ice dispenser, created a foreseeable risk that ice would fall \r\n  onto the floor and create a dangerous condition. After the jury returned its \r\n  verdict, Food Lion moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, \r\n  for a new trial due to excessiveness of the verdict. The trial court denied \r\n  the motions. \r\n  \r\nII. \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Food Lion argues the trial \r\n  court erred in failing to direct a verdict against Wintersteen on the issue \r\n  of negligence. We agree. \r\n  \r\nIt is well-established in South Carolina \r\n  that a merchant is not an insurer of the \r\n  safety of his customer[s] but owes them only the duty of exercising ordinary \r\n  care to keep the premises in reasonably safe condition. The negligence which \r\n  must therefore be proved by the plaintiff may be proved under our cases by showing \r\n  (1) that the material causing the fall was placed on the floor through an agency \r\n  of the store, or (2) that the merchant had actual or constructive notice of \r\n  the presence of the material on the floor and failed to remove it. \r\n  \r\nPennington v. Zayre Corp., \r\n  252 S.C. 176, 178, 165 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1969). The storekeeper's constructive \r\n  knowledge of the foreign substance can be established \"by showing that the foreign \r\n  substance had been on the floor for a sufficient time and that the storekeeper \r\n  would have discovered and removed it had the storekeeper used ordinary care.\" \r\n  Cook v. Food Lion, Inc., 328 S.C. 324, 327, 491 S.E.2d 690, 691 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997), cert. denied (May 15, 1998); accord Gillespie v. \r\n  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 302 S.C. 90, 394 S.E.2d 24 (Ct. App. 1990). \"The \r\n  mere fact the substance was on the floor is insufficient standing alone to charge \r\n  the storekeeper with negligence.\" Calvert v. House Beautiful Paint &amp; \r\n  Decorating Center, Inc., 313 S.C. 494, 496, 443 S.E.2d 398, 399 (1994). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn this case, there is no evidence \r\n  that a Food Lion employee put ice or water on the floor. Wintersteen, therefore, \r\n  was required to establish that Food Lion had actual or constructive knowledge \r\n  of the presence of the water on the floor and failed to remove it. We agree \r\n  with Food Lion that Wintersteen failed to carry this burden. \r\n  \r\nAs noted above, Wintersteen offered \r\n  no evidence establishing that the Food Lion employees knew that the water was \r\n  on the floor, nor did she present any evidence showing how long the water had \r\n  been on the floor. Wintersteen's expert testified that ice falling from the \r\n  drink machine could melt in as fast as one minute. Thus, while the liquid could \r\n  have been on the floor for an extended period of time, it is just as possible \r\n  that it had been on the floor for only moments before Wintersteen fell. Based \r\n  on the evidence presented at trial, it is apparent that any determination of \r\n  how long the water had been on the floor would be pure speculation. Wintersteen's \r\n  evidence, therefore, was insufficient to establish constructive notice. See \r\n  Wimberly v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., 252 S.C. 117, 122, 165 S.E.2d \r\n  627, 629 (1969) (concluding that trial court should have directed a verdict \r\n  in favor of the defendant because \"[n]o evidence is pointed out which reasonably \r\n  tends to prove that the rice was on the floor at any particular time prior to \r\n  the actual fall. The jury should not be permitted to speculate that it was on \r\n  the floor for such a length of time as to infer that defendant was negligent \r\n  in failing to detect and remove it.\"); Pennington, 252 S.C. at 179, 165 \r\n  S.E.2d at 696 (affirming grant of involuntary nonsuit in case where plaintiff \r\n  slipped on plastic bags on the floor: \"The plastic bags were obviously on the \r\n  floor at the time of the fall. There is no evidence in the record that the bags \r\n  were on the floor at any time prior thereto. To hold that the bags had been \r\n  there sufficiently long that they should have been discovered by the merchant \r\n  would be pure speculation.\"). \r\n  \r\nWintersteen, however, contends that \r\n  Food Lion created the hazard by installing the self-service drink and ice machine. \r\n  Wintersteen contends that because the \"drink machine constituted a permanent, \r\n  on-going hazard,\" this case is not a \"foreign substance\" case and she was not \r\n  required to prove Food Lion's actual or constructive notice. In essence, Wintersteen \r\n  contends that because the drink and ice machine created a foreseeable risk of \r\n  harm, Food Lion should be held liable for failing to exercise due care in reducing \r\n  or eliminating the risk of harm. While this argument has some appeal, we are \r\n  constrained to reject it. \r\n  \r\nIf the defendant in this case were \r\n  a typical landowner, Wintersteen's argument might well prevail. See, e.g., \r\n  Landry v. Hilton Head Plantation Property Owners Ass'n, Inc., 317 S.C. \r\n  200,203, 452 S.E.2d 619, 621 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"A landowner owes an invitee a \r\n  duty of due care to discover risks and to warn of or eliminate foreseeable unreasonable \r\n  risks.\"). In foreign substance cases involving storekeepers, however, the theory \r\n  of liability urged by Wintersteen has been expressly rejected. \r\n  \r\nIn Simmons v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, \r\n  Inc., 318 S.C. 310, 457 S.E.2d 608 (1995), a plaintiff who fell on a grape \r\n  contended that she should not be required to establish that the defendant had \r\n  actual or constructive notice of the presence of the grape on the floor. Instead, \r\n  the plaintiff argued that, because of the number of slip and fall incidents \r\n  involving grapes in Winn-Dixie's retail stores, a question of liability was \r\n  created \"based upon an inherently dangerous condition and foreseeable risk of \r\n  harm.\" Id. at 311, 457 S.E.2d 609. The Supreme Court rejected this argument \r\n  with little discussion, stating only that \"[w]e decline to expand the established \r\n  standard requiring notice, either actual or constructive, by a store owner in \r\n  slip and fall cases.\" Id. \r\n  \r\nIn Bessinger v. Bi-Lo, Inc., \r\n  329 S.C. 617, 496 S.E.2d 33 (Ct. App. 1998), this Court also rejected a theory \r\n  of liability quite similar to the theory urged by Wintersteen. In Bessinger, \r\n  the plaintiff slipped and fell on grapes near the checkout line. The plaintiff \r\n  contended that the grapes had fallen out of a vented bag in a grocery cart. \r\n  Id. at 619, 496 S.E.2d at 34. Although the plaintiff did not present \r\n  any evidence that the grocery store had actual or constructive knowledge of \r\n  the grapes on the floor, she argued that the grocery store should nonetheless \r\n  be held liable because the store's \"method of displaying grapes in vented bags \r\n  was negligent and created a dangerous condition.\" Id. Relying on Simmons, \r\n  this Court rejected the plaintiff's theory of liability and affirmed the grant \r\n  of summary judgment in favor of the defendant. Id. at 620, 496 S.E.2d \r\n  at 34-35. \r\n  \r\nIn light of Simmons and Bessinger, \r\n  we conclude that a storekeeper cannot be held liable for injuries caused by \r\n  falling on a foreign substance absent proof of the storekeeper's actual or constructive \r\n  knowledge of the presence of the foreign substance, even if the storekeeper's \r\n  own actions increased the likelihood that a foreign substance would fall on \r\n  the floor. In this case, Food Lion's actions in positioning the drink machine \r\n  and failing to put a mat in front of the machine may well have increased the \r\n  likelihood that ice or liquids would fall on the floor. Nevertheless, because \r\n  Wintersteen failed to present any evidence that Food Lion had actual or constructive \r\n  notice of the presence of the liquid in which she fell, the trial court erred \r\n  by denying Food Lion's motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict. See, e.g., Strange v. South Carolina Dep't of Highways \r\n  &amp; Public Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 429-30, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (S.C. 1994) \r\n  (\"In ruling on motions for directed verdict and JNOV, the trial court is required \r\n  to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom \r\n  in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions and to deny the \r\n  motions where either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference \r\n  is in doubt. The trial court can only be reversed by this Court when there is \r\n  no evidence to support the ruling below.\") (citation omitted).(1) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, \r\n  the jury's verdict in favor of Wintersteen is hereby \r\n  \r\nREVERSED.(2) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n1.  Wintersteen \r\n  contends that the verdict against Food Lion can be sustained under Henderson \r\n  v. St. Francis Community Hosp., 303 S.C. 177, 399 S.E.2d 767 (1990) and \r\n  Pinckney v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 311 S.C. 1, 426 S.E.2d 327 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1992), cert. denied (June 9, 1993). We disagree. First, we note \r\n  that Henderson involved a patient slipping on balls from sweet gum trees \r\n  in a hospital parking lot, not a customer slipping on a foreign substance in \r\n  a self-service store. Moreover, to the extent that these cases can be read as \r\n  imposing liability on a storekeeper for negligence in allowing a foreign substance \r\n  to fall on the floor even in the absence of evidence establishing the storekeeper's \r\n  actual or constructive knowledge of the foreign substance, we believe that such \r\n  a reading of the cases is no longer viable after the Supreme Court's decision \r\n  in Simmons v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., 318 S.C. 310, 457 S.E.2d 608 \r\n  (1995). \r\n2.  Given our \r\n  decision on this issue, it is unnecessary to address the other issues raised \r\n  by Food Lion. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3010","title":"Michael Ray McDonald, et al. v.

The trial \r\n  court held Farm Bureau failed to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to \r\n  McDonald as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (Supp. 1998). The court reformed \r\n  the policy to include UIM coverage in an amount equal to the liability limits. \r\n  Farm Bureau appeals. We affirm. \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMartha Wells originally owned a Mercury \r\n  Tracer. In 1993, she submitted an application to Farm Bureau for automobile \r\n  insurance on the Mercury with liability and uninsured motorist coverage limits \r\n  of 25/50/25. On the application, Wells indicated she rejected UIM coverage. \r\n  However, she also specified the limits of UIM coverage she desired as 25/50/25. \r\n  The number for her policy was 0117550. \r\n  \r\nIn 1996, Wells called Farm Bureau \r\n  and informed an employee she had sold the Mercury to her son, McDonald, and \r\n  wanted the insurance put in his name. At that time, McDonald had never been \r\n  a named insured on any policy with Farm Bureau. The employee told her to have \r\n  McDonald come to the office and pay a membership fee. Wells signed a change \r\n  form to change the name on the policy from her own to McDonald's. McDonald paid \r\n  the membership fee at the Farm Bureau office, but did not complete an application \r\n  or sign any document indicating he had become a named insured. McDonald did \r\n  not live with his mother at the time he purchased the Mercury. \r\n  \r\nAfter McDonald paid the membership \r\n  fee, Farm Bureau issued a policy on the Mercury listing McDonald as the named \r\n  insured. McDonald's policy was assigned the same number as his mother's policy \r\n  on the Mercury, 0117550. In addition, the liability and uninsured motorist coverage \r\n  was the same as it had been under Wells's policy. The policy did not provide \r\n  for UIM coverage. Farm Bureau's agent admitted McDonald was never offered UIM \r\n  coverage. According to the agent, his office just changes the name on the existing \r\n  policy when a child purchases an automobile from a parent, so the child does \r\n  not have to pay a new premium. \r\n  \r\nOn June 30, 1996, McDonald was seriously \r\n  injured when a car coming from the opposite direction crossed the center line \r\n  and collided with the Mercury being driven by McDonald. His daughter, Amber \r\n  McDonald, was killed in the accident. McDonald's other passenger, Sharon Tice, \r\n  was also injured in the accident. \r\n  \r\nThe at-fault driver's liability insurer \r\n  paid McDonald and Tice $50,000, the limits of its policy. McDonald and Tice \r\n  reserved the right to bring any claims they may have for UIM coverage. \r\n  \r\nMcDonald and Tice brought a declaratory \r\n  judgment action against Farm Bureau regarding the availability of UIM coverage \r\n  to McDonald. The trial court held Farm Bureau failed to make a meaningful offer \r\n  of UIM coverage to McDonald as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 and reformed \r\n  the policy to include UIM coverage in an amount equal to the liability limits. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Strother v. Lexington County \r\n  Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998). Farm Bureau argues \r\n  it was not required as a matter of law to make an offer of UIM coverage to McDonald \r\n  because McDonald was not a \"new applicant\" pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350 \r\n  (Supp. 1998). We disagree. \r\n  \r\nAutomobile insurance carriers must \r\n  offer \"at the option of the insured, UIM coverage up to the limits of the insured \r\n  liability coverage . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160. If the insurer fails \r\n  to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to the insured, the policy will be \r\n  reformed, by operation of law, to include UIM coverage up to the limits of liability \r\n  insurance carried by the insured. Butler v. Unisun, 323 S.C. 402, 475 \r\n  S.E.2d 758 (1996). \r\n  \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350 \r\n  specifies the form insurers must use when offering optional coverages, such \r\n  as UIM coverage. Insurers must use this form for all \"new applicants.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(A). If this form is properly completed by the \"named insured,\" \r\n  there is a presumption of the insured's informed coverage selection. S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B). Farm Bureau argues Section 38-77-350(A), which specifies \r\n  the form a carrier must use for all \"new applicants,\" conflicts with Section \r\n  38-77-160, which requires a carrier to offer UIM coverage to all \"insureds.\" \r\n  Relying on the fact that McDonald did not fill out an application for insurance, \r\n  Farm Bureau contends it did not have to offer McDonald UIM coverage because \r\n  he was not a \"new applicant.\" \r\n  \r\n This court's primary function in \r\n  interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly. Busby \r\n  v. Moore, 330 S.C. 201, 498 S.E.2d 883 (1998). A statute must receive a \r\n  practical and reasonable interpretation consonant with the \"design\" of the legislature. \r\n  Id. \"Sections 38-77-160 and 38-77-350 cover the same subject matter, \r\n  i.e., the offer of optional insurance coverages for automobiles, and, therefore, \r\n  must be construed together and as explanatory of each other.\" Osborne v. \r\n  Allstate Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 479, 484, 462 S.E.2d 291, 294 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\n  \r\n \r\nWe see no inconsistency in the term \r\n  \"new applicant\" in Section 38-77-350(A) and \"insured\" in Section 38-77-160. \r\n  Clearly, the legislature intended for insurers to afford all named insured the \r\n  opportunity to accept or reject UIM coverage. In using the term \"new applicant,\" \r\n  the legislature simply distinguished between those who had never had an opportunity \r\n  to reject UIM coverage and others, such as insureds renewing policies, who previously \r\n  had made informed decisions about UIM coverage. \r\n  \r\nMcDonald had never been a named insured \r\n  with Farm Bureau prior to the insurance on the Mercury. He had never been given \r\n  the opportunity to accept or reject UIM coverage. Although McDonald did not \r\n  fill out an application, he paid a membership fee to become a named insured \r\n  of Farm Bureau. Regardless of the manner in which Farm Bureau processed McDonald's \r\n  request for his own insurance policy, McDonald was a new named insured with \r\n  the carrier, entitled to an offer of UIM coverage. Any other construction of \r\n  the statute would defeat the legislature's intent that all named insured be \r\n  offered UIM coverage. \r\n  \r\nFarm Bureau next argues it was not \r\n  required to offer McDonald UIM coverage because the insurance policy merely \r\n  substituted McDonald's name for Wells's as the named insured on the policy. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n  \r\nSection 38-77-350(C) provides, \"An \r\n  automobile insurer is not required to make a new offer of coverage on any automobile \r\n  insurance policy which renews, extends, changes, supersedes, or replaces an \r\n  existing policy.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(C) (Supp. 1998).(1) \r\n  In Ackerman v. Travelers Indem. Company, 318 S.C. 137, 456 S.E.2d 408 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995), the insurer argued it was not required to offer UIM coverage \r\n  because the insured replaced existing policies issued by another carrier with \r\n  the insurer's policy. We rejected that argument finding, \r\n  \r\n If Â§ 38-77-350(C) were interpreted \r\n  to relieve [carrier] of the general requirement of offering [the insured] underinsured \r\n  motorist coverage up to the liability limits of the policy, it would amount \r\n  to an absolute repeal of Â§ 38-77-160, which mandates that an automobile insurer \r\n  offer underinsured motorist coverage up to the limits of the insured's liability \r\n  coverage. \r\n  \r\nId. at 142, 456 S.E.2d at \r\n  411. Where Section 38-77-350(C) states the insured is not required to make a \r\n  \"new\" offer, it clearly envisions the circumstances where the insurer has already \r\n  made an \"old\" offer. Id. \r\n  \r\nWe find this reasoning applicable \r\n  to the present case. Removing Wells from the policy and substituting McDonald \r\n  as the named insured was not a mere policy change. It was the creation of a \r\n  new insurance policy with a new named insured. Before McDonald became the named \r\n  insured, he had never been given the opportunity to accept or reject UIM coverage. \r\n  Therefore, an offer of UIM coverage to McDonald was required under Section 38-77-160. \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, we find the trial court \r\n  did not err in reforming McDonald's policy to include UIM coverage. \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1.

Jones, brought this \r\n  negligence action against Julia T. Carter. The action seeks payment for personal \r\n  injuries suffered when Jones's bicycle and Carter's vehicle crashed into each \r\n  other. Castor appeals from a jury verdict for Carter. We affirm. \r\n  \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn July 8, 1992, Carter was driving \r\n  in her automobile on Schoolhouse Road. She had seen a \"Watch Out For Children\" \r\n  sign and was traveling at approximately 20 to 25 miles per hour. Meanwhile, \r\n  Jones, then six years old, and her cousin were riding their bicycles along Mercer \r\n  Street on their way to Pinehurst Park. There is a stop sign on Mercer Street \r\n  where it intersects with Schoolhouse Road near the park. Although several people \r\n  had warned Jones about riding her bike too fast and not stopping at the stop \r\n  sign, neither Jones nor her cousin, who was riding in front of Jones, stopped \r\n  there. Jones's cousin crossed the intersection without incident, but Jones did \r\n  not. She collided with Carter's car when both arrived at the intersection simultaneously. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Castor contends that, \r\n  in instructing the jury, the trial judge erroneously juxtaposed the standard \r\n  of care applicable to adults to the standard of care involving minors. We find \r\n  no reversible error. \r\n  \r\nThe trial court is required to charge \r\n  the current and correct law. See McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. \r\n  301, 306, 457 S.E.2d 603, 606 (1995). \"A confusing charge alone is insufficient \r\n  to warrant reversal. Jury instructions must be considered as a whole, and if, \r\n  as a whole, they are reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might \r\n  be misleading do not constitute reversible error.\" Keaton v. Greenville Hosp. \r\n  Sys., Op. No. 24912 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 1, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. \r\n  Sh. No. 9 at 31, 40) (quoting State v. Kerr, 330 S.C. 132, 144, 498 S.E.2d \r\n  212, 218 (Ct. App. 1998)) (internal citations omitted). \r\n  \r\nHere, the judge charged the jury \r\n  that \r\n  \r\n[t]o determine whether a particular \r\n  act . . . on the part of Ms. Carter is negligent, you should compare that act \r\n  with the manner in which a person of ordinary reason and prudence would have \r\n  acted in the same or similar circumstances. \r\n  \r\nSo that's the standard. That's the \r\n  standard you apply in judging the actions of the parties in this case. Did that \r\n  person act as a reasonable, prudent person would have acted under the same or \r\n  similar circumstances? That's the question you ask yourself in deciding whether \r\n  . . . that person was negligent . . . . Compare the way that person acted with \r\n  the way . . . an ordinary, prudent and reasonable person would have acted under \r\n  the same or similar circumstances. \r\n  \r\nTo recover in this case, as I said, \r\n  Ms. Jones must establish that Ms. Carter was negligent in at least one way, \r\n  and that that negligent act was a direct [and] proximate cause of her damages. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe judge then began to explain the \r\n  various common law and statutory duties involved. The portions relevant to the \r\n  appeal follow: \r\n  \r\n. . . Except when directed by a police \r\n  officer, every driver of a vehicle--of course that would include a bicycle--approaching \r\n  a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering \r\n  the cross walk or on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at \r\n  the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching \r\n  traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering it. \r\n  \r\nThat just simply means you're supposed \r\n  to stop when you see a stop sign. \r\n  \r\nAnd another provision of the law \r\n  that may be relevant: the erection by the Highway Department of a stop sign \r\n  at an intersection has the effect of making the intersection a stop intersection. \r\n  A motorist approaching a stop intersection on a servient highway has the duty \r\n  to yield the right-of-way as required to exercise due care for approaching traffic \r\n  on the dominant highway. \r\n  \r\nI instruct you further that a motorist \r\n  on a preferred highway is entitled to assume a vehicle approaching on a secondary \r\n  highway will stop [at] the intersection unless the driver has knowledge of the \r\n  absence of a stop sign or he is otherwise . . . put on notice that the vehicle \r\n  at the intersecting street is not going to stop. \r\n  \r\nThere has also been reference by \r\n  the attorneys in their arguments to how the law views the actions of a child. \r\n  And they've been . . . basically correct in their statements in regard to that. \r\n  But I need to tell you exactly what that is. \r\n  \r\nAnd the law is that a child under \r\n  the age of fourteen is not required to conform to an adult standard of care. \r\n  A child under the age of fourteen, that child's conduct should be judged by \r\n  you by the standard of behavior to be expected of a child of like age, intelligence, \r\n  and experience under the same circumstances. A child may be so young as to be \r\n  manifestly and utterly incapable of exercising any of those qualities of attention, \r\n  perception, knowledge, experience, intelligence, and judgment which are necessary \r\n  to enable the child to perceive a risk and to realize its unreasonable character. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn the other hand[,] it is obvious \r\n  that a child who has not yet attained majority may be quite as capable as an \r\n  adult of exercising such qualities of care. \r\n  \r\nI tell you that when the driver of \r\n  a vehicle knows or should [know] that children may reasonably be expected to \r\n  be in, near, or adjacent to a street or highway, the driver is under a duty \r\n  to anticipate the likelihood of the child running into or across the street \r\n  in obedience to childish impulses and to exercise due care under these circumstances \r\n  for the safety of the child or children. The law recognizes that children act \r\n  upon childish impulses. There is imposed upon the motorist in order to reach \r\n  the standard of care with respect to children, the duty to exercise more vigilance \r\n  and caution than might be sufficient in the case of an adult. \r\nHowever, a motorist is not an insurer \r\n  against all accidents with a child. This is especially true when the child's \r\n  presence is both unexpected and unforeseeable. \r\n  \r\nNow, a violation of one of the statutes \r\n  that I mentioned to you is, if you found there to be a violation of one of those \r\n  statutes, that would be, in and of itself, negligence. A violation of a statute \r\n  or of one of the common law rules of the road is, itself, negligence. \r\n  \r\nCastor asserts that Jones's status \r\n  as a minor should prevent Carter from being entitled to the charge that \"a motorist \r\n  on a preferred highway is entitled to assume that a vehicle approaching on a \r\n  secondary highway will stop [at] the intersection unless the driver has knowledge \r\n  of the absence of a stop sign or he is otherwise . . . put on notice that the \r\n  vehicle at the intersection is not going to stop\" (the \"assumption charge\"). \r\n  We disagree. \r\n  \r\nCarter was entitled to the assumption \r\n  charge. On cross-examination, Jones testified that she and her cousin had been \r\n  racing their bicycles when the accident occurred. The day before the accident, \r\n  Castor warned Jones against riding her bike in the street. In fact, several \r\n  people at the park had warned Jones about riding her bicycle too fast and about \r\n  not stopping at the stop sign at the corner of Mercer Street and Schoolhouse \r\n  Road. Upon being asked, \"[W]hen you see a stop sign, what does that mean?\" Jones \r\n  responded, \"Stop.\" Given these facts, there is evidence in the record that Jones \r\n  knew to stop at the stop sign, yet intentionally failed to do so. Thus, Carter \r\n  was entitled to the assumption charge and the trial judge did not err in instructing \r\n  the jury with it. See Chesser v. Tyger River Pine Co., 155 S.C. \r\n  356, 366, 152 S.E. 646, 650 (1930) (Where there was evidence to support the \r\n  respondent's legal theory of the case, \"[i]t was the duty of the presiding judge, \r\n  in charging the jury, to instruct them as to the law applicable to the case, \r\n  not only from the theories of the appellant, but from the contentions of the \r\n  respondent as well.\"). \r\n  \r\nAs support for her argument, Castor \r\n  refers us to Herring v. Boyd, 245 S.C. 284, 140 S.E.2d 246 (1965) and \r\n  Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. 547, 481 S.E.2d 444 (Ct. App. 1997). Neither \r\n  of these cases requires reversal in the case at bar. \r\n  \r\nIn Herring, our Supreme Court \r\n  affirmed the trial court's refusal to charge a statute regarding the right of \r\n  an individual to act upon the assumption that others will obey the law. There, \r\n  the Court held that the facts of the case did not support the charge because \r\n  the plaintiff was a four-year-old child and the defendant knew, or should have \r\n  known, that the presence of children in the area was likely. In reaching this \r\n  determination, the Court reasoned that where a motorist has notice of the presence \r\n  of children in or near the line of travel, the motorist is charged with \"reasonably \r\n  anticipating that a child might, in obedience to childish impulses, cross the \r\n  road without yielding.\" 245 S.C. at 294-95, 140 S.E.2d at 251. However, this \r\n  reasoning assumed that a four-year-old child, pursuant to the law at that time, \r\n  was incapable of contributory negligence. See Herring, 245 S.C. \r\n  at 294, 140 S.E.2d at 251 (\"We are here dealing with a four year old child who \r\n  was incapable of contributory negligence.\"); Chitwood v. Chitwood, 159 \r\n  S.C. 109, 112, 156 S.E. 179, 180 (1930) (\"[I]t is held in this state, by analogy \r\n  to the criminal law, that an infant under 7 years of age is conclusively presumed \r\n  to be incapable of contributory negligence; that between the ages of 7 and 14 \r\n  there is a prima facie presumption of such incapacity, which, however, may be \r\n  overcome by evidence showing capacity; and, by clear implication, that an infant \r\n  of the age of 14 years or over will be presumed capable of contributory negligence \r\n  in the absence of proof to the contrary.\" (citations omitted)). Thus, instructing \r\n  the jury that the reasonableness of a defendant's conduct could be judged in \r\n  light of an assumption that others will obey the law would have effectively \r\n  abrogated the law's protection, at that time, of small children through modification \r\n  of the contributory negligence standard. \r\n  \r\nSubsequently, in Standard v. Shine, \r\n  278 S.C. 337, 295 S.E.2d 786 (1982), the Supreme Court abandoned the age-based \r\n  presumptions that supported the rule in Herring. In Standard, \r\n  a six-year-old boy and his parents (collectively \"the tenants\") lived in an \r\n  apartment. Their landlord sued them, alleging that the child negligently set \r\n  fire to the apartment. The tenants demurred to the complaint, contending that \r\n  case law presumed the son incapable of negligence. The trial court overruled \r\n  the demurrer and the tenants appealed. The Supreme Court affirmed. 278 S.C. \r\n  at 338, 295 S.E.2d at 786-87. It noted that there were no South Carolina cases \r\n  addressing the primary, as opposed to contributory, negligence of minors. In \r\n  analyzing this issue, the Court found persuasive the prevailing view that there \r\n  should be no arbitrary limits as to when a child could be either contributorily \r\n  or primarily negligent. Id. at 338-39, 295 S.E.2d at 787. The Court then \r\n  eliminated the aged-based presumptions previously used in contributory negligence \r\n  cases and declared, \r\n  \r\nThe capacities of children vary greatly, \r\n  not only with age, but also with individuals of the same age. Therefore, no \r\n  very definite statement can be made as to just what standard is to be applied \r\n  to them. Of course, a child of tender years is not required to conform to an \r\n  adult standard of care. . . . [A] minor's conduct should be judged by the standard \r\n  of behavior to be expected of a child of like age, intelligence, and experience \r\n  under like circumstances. \r\n  \r\n Id. (citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nUnder the holding in Standard, \r\n  what specific behavior is legally expected of a minor under fourteen becomes \r\n  a question of fact decided on the circumstances of each case. Even though one \r\n  child of a given age may be completely incapable of acting in accordance with \r\n  a given adult standard of care, another child of the same age may have sufficient \r\n  maturity and knowledge such that a jury could reasonably expect that child to \r\n  act as an adult should under the same circumstances. See Brown, \r\n  325 S.C. at 556, 481 S.E.2d at 449. Thus, in the wake of Standard, where \r\n  there is evidence that a minor should be expected to exhibit a certain level \r\n  of care, Herring can no longer operate to prevent a jury, in determining \r\n  the child's negligence or comparative negligence, from considering the child's \r\n  failure to exercise that level of care.(1) A \r\n  child under fourteen therefore may be, but is not necessarily, negligent for \r\n  failure to obey an adult standard of care. \r\n \r\nIn Brown, a three-year-old \r\n  child, while crossing the street, was hit by a motorist. The child, through \r\n  his Guardian ad Litem, sued the motorist for injuries incurred in the accident. \r\n  The motorist generally denied the allegations and asserted comparative negligence \r\n  as an affirmative defense. 325 S.C. at 549, 481 S.E.2d at 446. The Guardian \r\n  ad Litem appealed the jury's verdict holding the child 75% negligent and the \r\n  motorist 25% negligent and asserted that the judge's charge on the standard \r\n  of care applicable to minors was erroneous. Id. at 549, 553, 481 S.E.2d \r\n  at 446-47. The trial judge had charged the jury that \"[a] child below the age \r\n  of fourteen is held to the standard of a reasonable child his same age.\" Id. \r\n  at 554, 481 S.E.2d at 448. On appeal, this Court held the judge's instruction \r\n  was contrary to the Supreme Court's holding in Standard because the instruction \r\n  did not take into account the potential for variance of intelligence and experience \r\n  within a single age group and was erroneous. See 325 S.C. at 554, 560, \r\n  481 S.E.2d at 448, 451. Unlike the trial judge in Brown, the trial judge \r\n  in the instant case did not give an erroneous instruction as to arbitrary age \r\n  presumptions. Rather, the judge instructed the jury by using the language suggested \r\n  in Brown.(2) \r\n Thus, Brown does not require \r\n  reversal in the case at bar. \r\n  \r\nCastor also asserts that the trial \r\n  judge failed to adequately distinguish between the standard of care applicable \r\n  to adults and the standard of care applicable to children under the age of fourteen. \r\n  Specifically, Castor claims that the trial judge improperly charged that Jones's \r\n  actions were to be judged by an adult standard of care. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nIn our view, the trial judge's charge \r\n  to the jury, when read as a whole, sufficiently explains the differences between \r\n  the standards of care applicable to adults and the standards applicable to children. \r\n  Immediately after finishing his explanation of the adult standards of care, \r\n  the trial judge expressly brought the jury's attention to the different standard \r\n  of care for children. The judge then instructed the jury on this standard, using \r\n  the language suggested in Brown. Thus, we conclude that the judge's instructions \r\n  were reasonably free from error. \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the trial court is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1.  Even if, under \r\n  Herring, the trial judge should not have given the assumption charge, \r\n  this error would not require reversal. After giving the charge suggested in \r\n  Brown, the judge explained to the jury that, when a driver is traveling \r\n  in an area where children may be reasonably expected to be playing, the driver \r\n  is under a duty \"to anticipate the likelihood of the child running into or across \r\n  the street in obedience to childish impulses and to exercise due care under \r\n  these circumstances for the safety of the child or children.\" Hence, any error \r\n  was appropriately mitigated and the judge's instructions were reasonably free \r\n  from error. See Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 547, 462 \r\n  S.E.2d 321, 330 (Ct. App. 1995) (\"If, as a whole, the charges are reasonably \r\n  free from error, isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute \r\n  reversible error.\"). \r\n2.  In Brown, \r\n  325 S.C. at 556, 481 S.E.2d at 449, we suggested, and in the case at bar continue \r\n  to suggest, that trial judges use the following charge in cases involving the \r\n  negligence or comparative negligence of minors under the age of fourteen: \r\n  \r\nA child under the age of fourteen \r\n  is not required to conform to an adult standard of care. A minor's conduct should \r\n  be judged by the standard of behavior to be expected of a child of like age, \r\n  intelligence, and experience under like circumstances. A child may be so young \r\n  as to be manifestly and utterly incapable of exercising any of those qualities \r\n  of attention, perception, knowledge, experience, intelligence, and judgment \r\n  which are necessary to enable the child to perceive a risk and to realize its \r\n  unreasonable character. On the other hand, it is obvious that a minor who has \r\n  not attained majority may be quite as capable as an adult of exercising such \r\n  qualities. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3012","title":"Muir v.

Bard, Inc. (Bard). The Single Commissioner found Muir's illnesses \r\n  compensable as occupational diseases. In addition, the Single Commissioner refused \r\n  to allow Bard a credit for payments of short term and long term disability. \r\n  The Full Commission and the Circuit Court affirmed. Bard appeals. We affirm. \r\n  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\nThe Single Commissioner, Full Commission, \r\n  and Circuit Court treated Muir's claim as one for occupational disease. Accordingly, \r\n  we address his claim as one for occupational disease, rather than accidental \r\n  injury. \r\nIn 1977, Muir began working with \r\n  Davol as a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer in its Moncks Corner facility. \r\n  Bard purchased Davol in the fall of 1980. Muir continued working for Bard in \r\n  the same capacity as he had with Davol. As part of his job, Muir inspected failed \r\n  foley catheters to determine the cause of the problem. He made visual inspections \r\n  and tried to duplicate the problems. For some catheters, he had to inflate and \r\n  deflate the balloon. If the balloon did not deflate, Muir would use a syringe \r\n  with a needle to remove the water. For approximately thirty percent of the catheters, \r\n  Muir had to dissect them using scissors or exacto knives. He would then microscopically \r\n  examine the catheter to find the defect. Muir estimated he examined 12,000 to \r\n  15,000 failed catheters during his years with Bard. \r\nInitially, the failed catheters were \r\n  sent to a Bard facility in either Covington, Georgia, or Murray Hill, New Jersey. \r\n  The failed catheters arrived at the customer complaint department of the Covington \r\n  facility. The department packaged each catheter, gave it a number, placed it \r\n  in a corrugated box, and sent it to the sterilization department to be processed. \r\n  It took approximately two days for a catheter to get from the customer complaint \r\n  department to the sterilization department. \r\nThe sterilization process took a \r\n  minimum of three days. First, the catheter went to a preconditioning area to \r\n  prehumidify it for sterilization. Then, it went through a sterilizer of ethylene \r\n  oxide gas (EtO). During the first twelve years Muir worked for Bard, the catheters \r\n  were processed with a blend of EtO and freon. In late 1992, Bard began using \r\n  100 percent EtO. After sterilization, the department postconditioned the catheter \r\n  to allow for off-gassing of the EtO. The catheter remained in postcondition \r\n  for a minimum of 24 hours. According to Elizabeth Bruette, who is the Operations \r\n  Manager in charge of EtO sterilization at the Covington facility, the minimum \r\n  amount of time the catheters are kept in her department is four days. \r\nBruette testified EtO is labeled \r\n  a toxic chemical and is possibly carcinogenic. EtO is not approved by the Federal \r\n  Food and Drug Administration to sterilize used and contaminated medical products. \r\n  Vivian Stephens, the Field Assurance Manager at Covington, stated there were \r\n  no guarantees of sterility and no way to validate sterilization. The catheter \r\n  is bagged without any capability of maintaining sterility. She said they did \r\n  no decontamination of the samples for fear of alleviating the defective condition. \r\n  Stephens insisted no other Bard employee has contracted hepatitis C or aplastic \r\n  anemia. \r\nApproximately one to two days after \r\n  the sterilization process was completed, the customer complaint department sent \r\n  the repackaged catheters to the manufacturer. The Covington facility usually \r\n  sent the catheters to the Moncks Corner facility where Muir worked through regular \r\n  mail, taking three to four days. Occasionally, the supervisor of the Field Assurance \r\n  Department in Covington needed expeditious evaluation. Under these circumstances, \r\n  as soon as the catheter was out of sterilization, it was dispensed through overnight \r\n  delivery. \r\nWhen the catheters arrived at the \r\n  Moncks Corner facility, Muir's assistant would log them in. Muir, at that point, \r\n  took the catheters to his office for evaluation. The failed catheters were packaged \r\n  in a plastic bag which was folded over and stapled shut. A complaint number \r\n  was written on the plastic bag. A complaint form identifying the complaining \r\n  hospital, the number of the complaint, and the date of issuance was attached \r\n  to the bag. A sticker was affixed to the bag indicating the catheter had been \r\n  processed with EtO sterilization. \r\nMuir described the appearance of \r\n  the catheters when he received them: \"[F]or the most part, considering how they've \r\n  been used in the hospital, they were relatively clean, they may have some of \r\n  the lubricant on them.\" However, approximately twenty-five percent of the catheters \r\n  had blood on them. Some of the blood was dried on the outside. In catheters \r\n  where the balloon was ruptured, there was blood underneath the soft, pliable \r\n  parts of the balloon. In addition, the blood was sometimes covered with the \r\n  lubricant. In some catheters, the drained lumen was full of crystals which had \r\n  a \"very strong urinary odor.\" Other catheters had types of odors Muir could \r\n  not identify. Gloria Jean Kemmerer, the Quality Assurance Secretary assisting \r\n  Muir, stated the used catheters were damp and some had dried blood on them. \r\n  They were malodorous and \"very nasty.\" \r\nAt the beginning of Muir's employment \r\n  with Davol, his supervisor told him he could handle the catheters with his bare \r\n  hands because they had been EtO sterilized. At first, Muir did not use any type \r\n  of gloves. However, in 1978, once he saw the condition of some of the catheters, \r\n  he began using gloves. \r\nThe only type of gloves Muir used \r\n  in his examinations were latex exam gloves. At times, water would migrate inside \r\n  the gloves. Occasionally, the gloves would rip and tear. The catheters were \r\n  sometimes wet and slippery from the lubricant. About once a month, Muir stuck \r\n  himself with the scissors or a needle when the catheter he was examining slipped. \r\n  Muir would simply place an adhesive bandage over the wound, put on another glove, \r\n  and continue his examination. Sometimes the balloon of the catheter was inflated \r\n  with water and would not deflate. If Muir touched the outside of the balloon, \r\n  it would explode and \"blow\" its contents all over him. He learned by trial and \r\n  error how to deflate the balloon to avoid such an explosion. Muir was not concerned \r\n  about his exposure to the catheters and his wounds because he believed the catheters \r\n  were sterilized. \r\nA blood test in 1986 revealed abnormalities \r\n  in Muir's liver function and in his white blood cell count. Muir did not have \r\n  another abnormal blood test until January 25, 1990. That test indicated slightly \r\n  high liver enzymes, slightly low white blood cell count and a reverse in the \r\n  percentage of granulocytes to lymph/monos. Muir's family physician, Dr. Jeanne \r\n  Campbell, described this condition as lymphocytosis. Another test taken January \r\n  29, 1990, indicated Muir's white blood cell count was borderline low and showed \r\n  continued lymphocytosis. Dr. Campbell sent Muir a letter on April 30, 1990, \r\n  asking him to return to the office for a follow-up on the abnormal tests. Muir \r\n  did not return to the office until October 26, 1990. The blood test taken that \r\n  day indicated a slightly low white blood cell count and lymphocytosis. \r\nIn 1991, Muir was diagnosed with \r\n  non-insulin dependent diabetes. On October 17, 1991, he was given a blood test \r\n  which revealed abnormalities in his enzymes, low white blood cell and red blood \r\n  cell counts, low hematocrit, high mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and continued \r\n  lymphocytosis. Dr. Campbell testified the nature of Muir's problem was not clear, \r\n  but that \"[a]t this point [she] would have expressed a low level of concern.\" \r\n  \r\nMuir returned to Dr. Campbell on \r\n  March 12, 1992, complaining of a three week episode of fatigue. Blood work was \r\n  repeated. His white blood cell count and red blood cell count were both low. \r\n  Muir's hemoglobin and hematocrit were markedly low and the persistent lymphocytosis \r\n  was more marked than it had been before. His red blood cells were unusually \r\n  large and he had an unusually great amount of hemoglobin per cell. That abnormality \r\n  occurs in individuals with vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies, \r\n  and certain types of bone marrow and liver disorders. Dr. Campbell became extremely \r\n  concerned. She consulted another doctor and tested Muir's B12 level, \r\n  which was normal. She repeated the hematocrit four days later and found it had \r\n  dropped significantly. Dr. Campbell then referred Muir to Dr. Elizabeth Christian \r\n  on March 19, 1992, for a bone marrow biopsy. \r\nDr. Christian stated Muir's bone \r\n  marrow test was hard to read. He presented with pancytopenia, a depression of \r\n  the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, indicative of either \r\n  aplastic anemia or myelodysplasia. According to Dr. Christian, myelodysplasia \r\n  and aplastic anemia are bone marrow disorders. She later determined Muir suffers \r\n  from myelodysplasia. To treat anemia, Muir was given two units of packed red \r\n  blood cells at the end of March. The blood donors for these transfusions tested \r\n  negative for hepatitis C. \r\nIn an antibody test taken April 10, \r\n  1992, Muir tested positive for the hepatitis C antibody. Dr. Christian discussed \r\n  this diagnosis with Muir on April 21, 1992. At the time of Muir's diagnosis, \r\n  she was of the opinion that the hepatitis C was causing the pancytopenia. A \r\n  percutaneous liver biopsy taken in November of 1992 indicated Muir had chronic \r\n  active hepatitis consistent with hepatitis C. In a report dated February 25, \r\n  1993, Dr. Christian indicated Muir's \"initially positive Hepatitis C antibodies \r\n  [were] now negative.\" \r\nAfter Muir was diagnosed with hepatitis \r\n  C, he asked the plant nurse if she had any literature on hepatitis C. She provided \r\n  him with an article on the disease. Muir did research at different libraries \r\n  and contacted various organizations, including the National Disease Center and \r\n  the Hepatitis Foundation. \r\nEach time Muir returned from the \r\n  doctor, he talked to his plant manager, Tom Clark. Initially, he told Clark \r\n  that he did not know the cause of the hepatitis. After Muir gathered some research, \r\n  he told Clark the hepatitis C was related to his employment. Muir advised his \r\n  bosses, Chris Ganser and Joe Diaz, that the hepatitis C was related to his employment. \r\n  When John Dillinger, the Corporate Director of Quality Control for Bard, visited \r\n  the Moncks Corner facility in May, 1992, Muir informed Dillinger that he had \r\n  been diagnosed with hepatitis C. Additionally, Muir advised Dillinger that he \r\n  believed he had contracted the disease from handling the corporate complaints. \r\n  Muir subsequently received a letter of reprimand for having the conversation \r\n  with Dillinger. \r\nAround June of 1992, Muir served \r\n  on a committee at Bard discussing ways of improving the handling of catheters, \r\n  such as using surgeon's gloves, face masks, and tieback clothing. Muir stopped \r\n  working at Bard in August, 1992, before any of these changes were implemented. \r\n  The person who replaced Muir suits up in a special room in the laboratory with \r\n  rubber gloves, a hat, and a mask. \r\nAs treatment, Muir receives transfusions \r\n  with packed red blood cells every three weeks. He takes medications as bone \r\n  marrow stimulants and has to wear a pump that releases a drug to control the \r\n  iron overload caused by the blood transfusions. As a result of the hepatitis \r\n  C, Muir's liver is enlarged and painful. In addition, Muir experiences chronic \r\n  fatigue. \r\nMuir received his full salary for \r\n  twenty-two weeks under Bard's short term disability policy. Thereafter, he was \r\n  paid long term disability under the company's plan, to which he had contributed. \r\n  Muir receives Social Security benefits and long term disability payments comprising \r\n  sixty percent of his salary. \r\nOn March 30, 1993, Muir filed a Form \r\n  50 alleging he sustained an occupational disease resulting in injury to the \r\n  total body that was diagnosed on April 21, 1992. On the form, Muir alleged he \r\n  \"handled unsanitary catheters without gloves and contracted Hepatitis C and \r\n  Aplastic Anemia.\" He did not request a hearing with this form. Bard filed a \r\n  Form 51 in response denying liability under the Workers' Compensation Act and \r\n  asserting various defenses. On July 25, 1995, Muir filed a second Form 50 with \r\n  similar allegations to request a hearing. Again, Bard denied liability. The \r\n  hearing date was set for December 6, 1995. On November 28, 1995, Muir withdrew \r\n  his request for a hearing alleging he needed time to conduct further discovery. \r\n  \r\nOn June 6, 1996, Muir filed another \r\n  Form 50 requesting a hearing. In this form, he asserted he had sustained \"an \r\n  accidental injury to the total body; blood disorder affecting the entire body\" \r\n  on April 21, 1992. He averred he had \"handled unsanitary catheters without gloves \r\n  and contracted Hepatitis C and Aplastic Anemia and/or Myelodysplasia (accident \r\n  and/or occupational disease).\" Bard relied on its previous Form 51 as an answer. \r\n  A hearing was set for September 30, 1996. On September 30, 1996, Bard requested \r\n  a continuance to allow for further discovery. A hearing was held March 17, 1997. \r\n  \r\nIn a lengthy order, the Single Commissioner \r\n  detailed the evidence in the case. She held Muir contracted hepatitis C as a \r\n  direct result of his exposure to contaminated blood and body fluids while examining \r\n  and testing failed catheters in his employment with Bard. The Commissioner ruled \r\n  Muir's aplastic anemia and myelodysplasia were caused by his chronic hepatitis \r\n  C infection. The Commissioner concluded the hepatitis C, aplastic anemia, and \r\n  myelodysplasia met the requirements of compensable occupational diseases. She \r\n  found no probative evidence in the record to support a finding that Muir contracted \r\n  hepatitis C prior to 1980. She determined he contracted the disease within a \r\n  year of his last exposure. The Commissioner decided Muir had been totally disabled \r\n  since August 25, 1992. She held he timely gave notice of having contracted an \r\n  occupational disease to his employer and that he timely filed a claim for an \r\n  occupational disease. The Commissioner decreed: \r\nThe probative evidence in the record \r\n  does not support a finding of fact or ruling of law [that Muir] committed fraud \r\n  in his employment application, fraud in the inducement to sign a Form 15, fraud \r\n  in the initiation of the claim, suffered from a pre-existing disability to affected \r\n  members, elected remedies, suffered any intervening cause for his conditions, \r\n  or is equitably barred from bringing his claim by reason of laches as plead[ed] \r\n  in [Bard's] Form 51. \r\nShe refused to allow Bard an offset \r\n  or credit for amounts paid to Muir for short and long term disability. The Commissioner \r\n  ordered Bard to pay Muir five hundred weeks of compensation for his occupationally \r\n  related total and permanent disability commencing on August 25, 1992. She adjudged \r\n  that Bard should pay all causally related past and future medical bills and \r\n  expenses for the treatment of Muir's occupational diseases. The Full Commission \r\n  and the Circuit Court affirmed. \r\nISSUES \r\nI. Did the Circuit Court err in affirming \r\n  the Full Commission's decision Muir contracted an occupational disease, hepatitis \r\n  C, as a direct result of his employment with C.R. Bard? \r\nII. Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n  affirming the Full Commission's conclusion Muir's aplastic anemia and myelodysplasia \r\n  were caused by his hepatitis C? \r\nIII. Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n  refusing to find the Commission violated C.R. Bard's due process rights? \r\nIV. Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n  failing to rule the Commission should have added Davol as a defendant? \r\nV. Did the Circuit Court err in affirming \r\n  the Commission's conclusion Muir's claim complied with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-70 \r\n  (1985)? \r\nVI. Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n  refusing to reverse the Commission's decision Muir gave timely notice of his \r\n  claim pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985)? \r\nVII. Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n  failing to reverse the Commission's ruling Muir's claim was not barred by the \r\n  statute of limitations, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. 1998)? \r\nVIII. Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n  refusing to reverse the Commission's holding Muir's claim was not barred by \r\n  the doctrine of laches? \r\nIX. Did the Circuit Court err in \r\n  failing to award C.R. Bard a credit for short and long term disability payments \r\n  it made to Muir? \r\nX. Did the Circuit Court \r\n  err in failing to find the Commission made prejudicial and erroneous evidentiary \r\n  rulings warranting reversal of its decision? \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\nThe Full Commission is the ultimate \r\n  fact finder in Workers' Compensation cases and is not bound by the Single Commissioner's \r\n  findings of fact. Ross v. American Red Cross, 298 S.C. 490, 381 S.E.2d \r\n  728 (1989). See also Hoxit v. Michelin Tire Corp., 304 S.C. 461, \r\n  405 S.E.2d 407 (1991)(Full Commission is fact finder and it is not within Supreme \r\n  Court's province to reverse Commission's findings if they are supported by substantial \r\n  evidence). Although it is logical for the Full Commission, which did not have \r\n  the benefit of observing the witnesses, to give weight to the Single Commissioner's \r\n  opinion, the Full Commission is empowered to make its own findings of fact and \r\n  to reach its own conclusions of law consistent or inconsistent with those of \r\n  the Single Commissioner. McGuffin v. Schlumberger-Sangamo, 307 S.C. 184, \r\n  414 S.E.2d 162 (1992). The final determination of witness credibility and the \r\n  weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Full Commission. Ross, \r\n  supra. \r\nThe findings of the Commission are \r\n  presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence. \r\n  Medlin v. Upstate Plaster Serv., 329 S.C. 92, 495 S.E.2d 447 (1998). \r\n  See also Smith v. Squires Timber Co., 311 S.C. 321, 428 S.E.2d \r\n  878 (1993)(under Supreme Court's scope of review, Commission's denial of Workers' \r\n  Compensation benefits must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence \r\n  in record). It is not within our province to reverse findings of the Commission \r\n  which are supported by substantial evidence. Hunter v. Patrick Constr. Co., \r\n  289 S.C. 46, 344 S.E.2d 613 (1986). \r\nA court may not substitute its judgment \r\n  for that of an agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact \r\n  unless the agency's findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, \r\n  probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. Tiller v. National \r\n  Health Care Ctr., Op. No. 24915 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 8, 1999)(Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 10 at 23); Clade v. Champion Laboratories, 330 S.C. 8, 496 \r\n  S.E.2d 856 (1998). Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, \r\n  nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, \r\n  considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the \r\n  conclusion the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action. \r\n  Miller v. State Roofing Co., 312 S.C. 452, 441 S.E.2d 323 (1994); Stokes \r\n  v. First Nat'l Bank, 306 S.C. 46, 410 S.E.2d 248 (1991). Where there is \r\n  a conflict in the evidence, either by different witnesses or in the testimony \r\n  of the same witness, the findings of fact of the Commission are conclusive. \r\n  Tiller, supra. Indeed, the possibility of drawing two inconsistent \r\n  conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's findings \r\n  from being supported by substantial evidence. Id.; Clade, supra. \r\n  Worker's Compensation awards must not be based on surmise, conjecture or speculation. \r\n  Tiller, supra. A court may reverse or modify the Commission's \r\n  decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because \r\n  the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are affected \r\n  by other error of law. Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 \r\n  S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\nI. Hepatitis C \r\n  as Occupational Disease Contracted \r\n  Through Employment with Bard \r\nBard argues the Circuit Court erred \r\n  in affirming the Full Commission's decision that Muir contracted an occupational \r\n  disease, hepatitis C, as a direct result of his employment with Bard. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nA claimant must prove the following \r\n  six elements in order to receive Workers' Compensation benefits for having contracted \r\n  an occupational disease: \r\n1. A disease; \r\n2. The disease must arise out of \r\n  and in the course of the claimant's employment; \r\n3. The disease must be due to hazards \r\n  in excess of those hazards that are ordinarily incident to employment; \r\n4. The disease must be peculiar to \r\n  the occupation in which the claimant was engaged; \r\n5. The hazard causing the disease \r\n  must be one recognized as peculiar to a particular trade, process, occupation, \r\n  or employment; and \r\n6. The disease must directly result \r\n  from the claimant's continuous exposure to the normal working conditions of \r\n  the particular trade, process, occupation, or employment. \r\nFox v. Newberry County Memorial \r\n  Hosp., 319 S.C. 278, 281, 461 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1995). \r\nBard contends the Commission failed \r\n  to make sufficient findings of fact on each of the Fox elements. In Fox, \r\n  the Supreme Court found the Single Commissioner made insufficient findings of \r\n  fact on the elements of an occupational disease. The Court explained: \r\n[T]he Commissioner never acknowledged \r\n  that there were six elements that a claimant must prove to recover benefits \r\n  for contraction of an occupational disease. It can be assumed that he found \r\n  that herpetic whitlow is a disease, although that was never specifically stated. \r\n  It can also be assumed that the Commissioner's statement \"[respondent's] condition \r\n  of herpetic whitlow is found to be work related . . .\" is sufficient to meet \r\n  element two, which is that the disease must arise out of and in the course of \r\n  the claimant's employment. However, the remaining four elements are not addressed \r\n  at all. While the Commissioner defines the term \"peculiar to the occupation,\" \r\n  he never made any factual findings regarding that element. Nor did he address \r\n  the conflicting testimony provided by two experts as to whether herpetic whitlow \r\n  is peculiar to the medical profession. Therefore, even if it is assumed that \r\n  he found that herpetic whitlow is peculiar to the medical profession, it is \r\n  impossible to know what facts he relied upon. \r\nFox, 319 S.C. at 282, 461 \r\n  S.E.2d at 394-95. See also Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. \r\n  63, 456 S.E.2d 366 (1995)(findings of fact of administrative body must be sufficiently \r\n  detailed to enable reviewing court to determine whether findings are supported \r\n  by evidence). \r\nThe Single Commissioner, in her order, \r\n  which the Full Commission adopted, made a specific finding on each of the elements \r\n  of an occupational disease in the \"Rulings of Law\" section. In addition, the \r\n  Commissioner meticulously recited the evidence in the case, including the contradictory \r\n  medical testimony. She also made detailed findings of fact to support her conclusion \r\n  that Muir contracted hepatitis C as a result of his exposure to contaminated \r\n  blood and body fluids while examining the catheters as an employee of Bard. \r\n  \r\nBard particularly challenges the \r\n  Commissioner's finding that \"[t]he hazard or risk of contracting hepatitis C \r\n  is recognized as peculiar to any trade, process, occupation, or employment where \r\n  workers are exposed to blood or bodily fluids.\" The Commissioner noted Dr. Edwin \r\n  A. Brown stated transmission from needle sticks had been documented. She further \r\n  cited the testimony of Dr. Christian, who stated the most probable origin of \r\n  the hepatitis C was contamination through bodily fluid on the catheters, and \r\n  the testimony of Dr. Paul Yantis, who stated Muir most probably contracted the \r\n  hepatitis C from a catheter contaminated with the blood of an infected person.  \r\nWe find the Single Commissioner made \r\n  sufficient findings of fact as to each of the elements of an occupational disease. \r\n  \r\nB. Substantial \r\n  Evidence as to Causation \r\nBard claims Muir presented insufficient \r\n  expert evidence to establish the hepatitis C arose out of his employment. Therefore, \r\n  Bard asserts the substantial evidence in the record fails to support the Commission's \r\n  conclusion there was a causal link between Muir's employment with Bard and his \r\n  contraction of hepatitis C. \r\nIn an illuminating academic analysis, \r\n  our Supreme Court in Tiller v. National Health Care Ctr., Op. No. 24915 \r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 8, 1999)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 10 at 23), departed \r\n  from the inexorable and inflexible parameters structured by the \"most probable\" \r\n  evidentiary rule. Tiller inculcates the Bench and Bar: \r\nNational Health argues in this medically \r\n  complex case respondent failed to provide expert medical testimony about causation \r\n  as required by Smith v. Michelin Tire Corp., 320 S.C. 296, 465 S.E.2d \r\n  96 (Ct. App. 1995), and thus did not carry her burden of proof.  \r\n  \r\nIn Smith, the Court of Appeals \r\n  held \"if the claimant is attempting to establish causation of a medically complex \r\n  condition, however, expert testimony is required.\" Id. at 298, 465 S.E.2d \r\n  at 97. \r\nHowever, our case law does not support \r\n  application of this rule in workers' compensation cases. See Lorick, \r\n  supra (the Court found neither the expert testimony nor the lay testimony \r\n  provided evidentiary support of a causal connection); Dennis, supra \r\n  (viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to claimant, there was no \r\n  competent evidence to support an award). Instead, the Commission is given discretion \r\n  to weigh and consider all the evidence, both lay and expert, when deciding whether \r\n  causation has been established. See Ballenger v. Southern Worsted \r\n  Corp., 209 S.C. 463, 40 S.E.2d 681 (1946)(despite doctor's testimony that \r\n  there was not a connection with the accident that caused almost boiling dye \r\n  to fall in claimant's face and eyes and his subsequent eye problems, lay testimony \r\n  of claimant's good vision before the accident was sufficient to support an award); \r\n  Poston v. Southeastern Construction Co., 208 S.C. 35, 36 S.E.2d 858 (1946)(lay \r\n  testimony that claimant's eyes became runny and inflamed after some construction \r\n  material blew into them and that claimant lost vision in eyes subsequent to \r\n  the accident was sufficient to support an award, even though doctor testified \r\n  vision loss was not related to job injuries). Thus, while medical testimony \r\n  is entitled to great respect, the fact finder may disregard it if there is other \r\n  competent evidence in the record. Ballenger, supra. Indeed, \"medical \r\n  testimony should not be held conclusive irrespective of other evidence.\" Ballenger, \r\n  209 at 467, 40 S.E.2d at 682-83. \r\nIf a medical expert is unwilling \r\n  to state with certainty a connection between an accident and an injury, the \r\n  \"expression of a cautious opinion\" may support an award if there are facts outside \r\n  the medical testimony that also support an award. Grice v. Dickerson, Inc., \r\n  241 S.C. 225, 127 S.E.2d 722 (1962)(where medical testimony definitely recognized \r\n  the possibility of a causal connection between the accident and the rheumatoid \r\n  arthritis but no medical testimony stated a connection to a reasonable degree \r\n  of medical certainty, the Commission had to weigh the facts in light of the \r\n  medical possibilities and draw inferences consistent with the medical testimony \r\n  in the record); Brewer v. Charleston Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co., \r\n  212 S.C. 43, 46 S.E.2d 173 (1948)(doctor's testimony indicating a connection \r\n  between claimant's accident and his subsequent fungal infection, though not \r\n  stated to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, was sufficient to support \r\n  an award when combined with lay testimony about claimant's health before and \r\n  after the accident, despite the testimony of another doctor that stated there \r\n  was no connection). Thus, if medical expert testimony is not solely relied upon \r\n  to establish causation, the fact finder must look to the facts and circumstances \r\n  of the case. Grice, supra. Proof that a claimant sustained an \r\n  injury may be established by circumstantial and direct evidence where circumstances \r\n  lead an unprejudiced mind to reasonably infer the injury was caused by the accident. \r\n  Grice, supra; Hewitt v. Cheraw Cotton Mills, 217 S.C. 90, \r\n  59 S.E.2d 712 (1950). However, such evidence need not reach such a degree of \r\n  certainty as to exclude every reasonable or possible conclusion other than that \r\n  reached by the Commission. Grice, supra. \r\nUnlike the Court of Appeals, we decline \r\n  to apply the standard set out in Smith. Instead, in deciding whether \r\n  substantial evidence supports a finding of causation, we consider both the lay \r\n  and expert evidence. \r\nTiller at 25-28 (footnotes \r\n  omitted). \r\nDr. Jeanne Campbell was Muir's family \r\n  physician. She has a specialty in internal medicine and a Ph.D. in biochemistry. \r\n  Dr. Campbell has seen patients with hepatitis C in her practice and has a general \r\n  medical background regarding the disease. According to Dr. Campbell, the main \r\n  risks for hepatitis C are \"[t]ransfusions with contaminated blood; needle sharing \r\n  such as drug addicts do; sexual intercourse with an infected person; transfer \r\n  of body fluids from an infected person by any means, whether it's a health care \r\n  worker or somebody that somebody is involved in an altercation with.\" \r\nShe stated Muir had no risk factors \r\n  other than the exposure he received at his job. Muir testified he: (1) is not \r\n  an intravenous drug user; (2) did not use needles to control his diabetes; (3) \r\n  does not have any tattoos or body piercings; (4) has been in a stable, monogamous \r\n  marriage for forty-two years; (5) has traveled to Malaysia to visit Bard's plant \r\n  there; (6) is not a homosexual; (7) had not received any blood transfusions \r\n  prior to the transfusions to treat the aplastic anemia; (8) had no exposure \r\n  to blood, blood products, or bodily fluids except in his employment with Bard; \r\n  and (9) used paint thinners occasionally, but only in well ventilated areas. \r\n  Muir's wife did not have hepatitis. She was responsible for yard work, including \r\n  application of herbicides and fertilizers. \r\nDr. Campbell admitted she would defer \r\n  to a hepatitis C expert on whether blood transfusions are the major cause of \r\n  hepatitis C and on whether Muir, in fact, has hepatitis C, if she thought the \r\n  expert was reputable. She said: \"I feel comfortable enough with hepatitis to \r\n  sit down and have a discussion about it with my patients; but in a deposition \r\n  if somebody is going to try to pin me down to a fact, no, I don't feel comfortable \r\n  enough to swear by it unless I have the open volumes in front of me.\" However, \r\n  she opined \"the most probable origin [of Muir's hepatitis C] is contamination \r\n  via bodily fluids with which he came into contact while working with the catheters \r\n  at C.R. Bard.\" \r\nDr. Elizabeth Christian is a specialist \r\n  in internal medicine, hematology, and oncology. She admitted she is not an authority \r\n  in hepatology. Nonetheless, she gave her opinion that Muir most likely contracted \r\n  hepatitis C from the catheters. Dr. Christian testified: \"I feel that the \r\n  most likely area [for Muir contracting hepatitis C] is going to be from the \r\n  catheters.\" See Madison v. Brantley, 302 S.C. 282, 395 S.E.2d \r\n  190 (Ct. App. 1990)(testimony of medical malpractice plaintiff's expert using \r\n  phrase \"more likely than not\" satisfied \"most probably\" standard required for \r\n  finding of causation). \r\nDr. Paul Yantis is board certified \r\n  in internal medicine with a subspecialty in gastroenterology. Dr. Yantis testified: \r\n  \r\nAccording to records, the only risk \r\n  factor I can see for Mr. Muir developing hepatitis C would be the exposure he \r\n  had at work to the catheters that he inspected on a regular basis. All it would \r\n  take would be one catheter that had blood on it from a person who was infected \r\n  with the hepatitis C virus. \r\nMr. Muir coming into contact directly \r\n  with this catheter and having any kind of open cuts or sores on his hands would \r\n  certainly have had enough exposure in order to contract the disease. \r\nAccording to the records provided \r\n  me, Mr. Muir had no other known risk factors for contracting hepatitis C virus, \r\n  that is, IV drug abuse, multiple sexual partners, either heterosexual or homosexual, \r\n  or previous blood transfusions. . . . \r\nIt is my opinion, to a reasonable \r\n  degree of medical certainty, that Mr. Muir has chronic hepatitis C and most \r\n  probably contracted this disease from an infected urinary catheter that \r\n  was contaminated with the blood of a person infected with the hepatitis C virus. \r\n  \r\nWhen asked if he would defer to a \r\n  hepatitis C expert, Dr. Yantis responded: \"I am not saying there are not some \r\n  out there that, like you say, specialize only in--they don't see any patients \r\n  that don't have hepatitis or hepatitis C. Yeah, they may see more than I do, \r\n  but I don't think that makes their opinion any different than mine, or them \r\n  any more of an expert than myself.\" \r\nDr. Roger Russell is certified in \r\n  clinical pathology. He considers his areas of expertise to be clinical chemistry, \r\n  a subspecialty in toxicology, and clinical pathology, including all aspects \r\n  such as transfusion medicine, microbiology, immunology, clinical chemistry, \r\n  and hematology. \r\nDr. Russell reported \"EtO sterilization \r\n  was never intended to be used to 'sterilize' soiled medical devices. Bodily \r\n  fluids and other substances absorb the gas and prevent its penetration to the \r\n  viruses and bacteria it is intended to kill. Furthermore, its use with soiled \r\n  medical devices will result in increased EtO absorption requiring substantially \r\n  longer off gassing intervals to prevent harmful exposure to residual toxic gas.\" \r\n  Dr. Russell noted Muir did not have any of the risk factors. He reported that \r\n  the blood utilized in the transfusions Muir received prior to his hepatitis \r\n  C diagnosis was screened for hepatitis C with negative results and that the \r\n  donors remained free from hepatitis C. Dr. Russell declared: \"Having eliminated \r\n  these risk factors, I can state to a reasonable degree of medical certainty \r\n  that Mr. Muir most probably contracted Hepatitis C from his occupational exposure \r\n  to contaminated medical devices.\" In addition, Dr. Russell related: \"The \r\n  risk of contracting infectious diseases, including Hepatitis C, is well documented \r\n  and recognized in persons exposed to medical devices contaminated with bodily \r\n  fluids.\" He stated Muir was certainly exposed to a greater risk of hepatitis \r\n  C infection than the ordinary public. \r\nBard's expert witness, Dr. Edwin \r\n  Brown, has a specialty in internal medicine with a subspecialty in infectious \r\n  diseases. He found the transmission of hepatitis C to Muir through the catheters \r\n  \"unlikely because of the small amount or the absence of virus in urine, the \r\n  rapid inactivation of virus outside of the body or a carefully controlled environment, \r\n  and the lack of transmission [of hepatitis C] by skin contact alone.\" He declared: \r\n  \"Although health care workers are not at increased risk of hepatitis C infection, \r\n  transmission of HCV has been documented by needle injury in health care workers \r\n  when a needle, recently contaminated with blood from an HCV infected individual, \r\n  is inadvertently inserted into the health care worker.\" \r\nWhile Bard's expert witness, Dr. \r\n  Brown, is a qualified expert, he was not Muir's treating physician. His opinion \r\n  appears to be based on an incomplete knowledge of the facts of Muir's case. \r\n  He does not take into consideration in his report that Muir cut himself while \r\n  dissecting the catheters or that in some catheters the blood was soft and pliant \r\n  where it had been protected by a burst balloon or lubricant. \r\nWith linguistic eloquence and nonpareil \r\n  clarity, we are guided by Tiller into a meticulous review of the evidence. \r\n  Cognizant of the conflicting evidence, we give all-encompassing efficacy to \r\n  Tiller and come to the adamantine conclusion that substantial evidence: \r\n  (1) demonstrates hepatitis C is an occupational disease and the Commission made \r\n  sufficient findings of fact on each of the elements of an occupational disease; \r\n  (2) supports the Commission's decision that Muir's hepatitis C is an occupational \r\n  disease; and (3) reveals Muir's hepatitis C resulted from his contact with catheters \r\n  while employed with C.R. Bard. \r\nII. Connection \r\n  of Hepatitis C to Aplastic Anemia and Myelodysplasia \r\nBard maintains the Circuit Court \r\n  erred in affirming the Full Commission's conclusion that Muir's aplastic anemia \r\n  and myelodysplasia were caused by his hepatitis C. We disagree. \r\nDr. Christian identified the most \r\n  common causes of aplastic anemia as: (1) viral etiologies; (2) possibly due \r\n  to toxic drugs, usually not antibiotics; and (3) exposure to toxic chemicals, \r\n  such as herbicides, pesticides, and benzene, which is used in lab chemicals. \r\n  In addition, she related hepatitis C is known to be a cause of aplastic anemia. \r\n  This fact is documented in a plethora of hematology books and in multiple papers. \r\n  Dr. Christian reported: \"Since myelodysplasia is related to aplastic anemia, \r\n  in my opinion, it seems likely that the Hepatitis C virus could also be the \r\n  cause of myelodysplasia.\" \r\nDuring Dr. Christian's deposition, \r\n  Bard's counsel questioned: \"Are you sitting here today willing to give an opinion \r\n  to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that hepatitis C is the most probable \r\n  cause of Dale Muir's aplastic anemia and/or myelodysplasia?\" Dr. Christian replied, \r\n  \"I think it's the most common cause, in my opinion.\" She explained her \r\n  opinion was \"[d]ue to the fact that he presented with pancytopenia, he had \r\n  positive hepatitis C antibodies, and he had a liver biopsy that was positive \r\n  for hepatitis.\" \r\nIn Dr. Russell's report dated September \r\n  19, 1996, he wrote: \r\nThere is medical literature associating \r\n  Hepatitis C with bone marrow suppression, anemia, and aplastic anemia. Initial \r\n  laboratory studies and the clinical diagnosis in Mr. Muir's case were consistent \r\n  with aplastic anemia. He has subsequently been diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy \r\n  as having myelodysplasia. There is also medical literature associating aplastic \r\n  anemia with progression to myelodysplasia and subsequently to leukemia, especially \r\n  in patients who are treated with stimulating medications such as erythropoietin \r\n  and Neupogen (G-CSF) like Mr. Muir has been (and currently is being) treated \r\n  with. \r\nOn the other hand, Bard's expert, \r\n  Dr. Brown, related: \"Hepatitis C specialists do not believe that HCV infection \r\n  causes aplastic anemia. Evidence is available that a non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis \r\n  virus (a virus that is not hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C) may cause \r\n  aplastic anemia.\" In a pamphlet, the Aplastic Anemia Foundation Association \r\n  reported the National Institute of Health had determined the type of hepatitis \r\n  associated with aplastic anemia is \"non-A non-B non-C.\" The pamphlet further \r\n  provides: \"It is thought that patientswith the hepatitis/aplasia syndrome \r\n  may have been infected with a novel, as yet uncharacterized virus that causes \r\n  damage to both liver and bone marrow.\" \r\nSubstantial evidence exists to buttress \r\n  the Commission's conclusion that Muir's hepatitis C infection caused the aplastic \r\n  anemia and myelodysplasia. \r\nIII. Due Process \r\n  \r\nBard avers the Circuit Court erred \r\n  in refusing to find the Full Commission violated its statutory and constitutional \r\n  due process rights. We disagree. \r\nFirst, Bard argues the Commission \r\n  lacked familiarity with the claim when it decided the case. Bard bases this \r\n  complaint on the fact that each Commissioner voted on the case the same day \r\n  they heard oral argument. We find this argument meritless. \r\nIn its order, the Commission stated: \r\n  \"Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-50 (1985), we, the Full Commission, have \r\n  reviewed the Award and weighed the evidence as presented at the initial hearing. \r\n  We have also considered all issues raised in the briefs of the appellant(s) \r\n  and the respondent(s).\" This Court finds the questions the Commissioners asked \r\n  during the hearing were attempts to have the parties narrow the issues, rather \r\n  than admissions that the Commissioners were unfamiliar with the record. We have \r\n  no reason to doubt the Commissioners thoroughly reviewed the records and briefs \r\n  of the parties before making their decision. \r\nSecond, Bard contends it was denied \r\n  due process because the Single Commissioner did not allow it to call Dr. Russell \r\n  and other live witnesses. Bard wrote the Commissioner informing her that it \r\n  considered calling Dr. Russell as a live witness at the hearing. The Commissioner \r\n  responded: \"I strongly advise against calling an expert witness. Generally this \r\n  is not allowed in administrative hearings.\" Bard did not call Dr. Russell to \r\n  testify at the hearing. Although the Commissioner strongly recommended \r\n  against calling an expert witness, she never ruled Bard could not call Dr. Russell \r\n  at the trial. \r\nWe find Bard waived its right to \r\n  have Dr. Russell testify at the hearing by failing to call him to testify. In \r\n  addition, Bard did not attempt to depose Dr. Russell after he wrote his March \r\n  7, 1997, report. As a result, Bard waived its right to cross examine Dr. Russell \r\n  on the report. \r\nIV. Addition of \r\n  Davol as a Party \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBard claims the Circuit Court erred \r\n  in failing to rule the Full Commission should have added Davol as a defendant. \r\n  We disagree. \r\nIn its Form 51, Bard asserted it \r\n  reserved the right to add additional parties as more information became available. \r\n  In its grounds for review to the Commission, Bard listed as an issue: \"Did the \r\n  Hearing Commissioner err as a matter of law in failing to add Davol and its \r\n  workers' compensation carrier from 1977 to 1980 as an indespensable [sic] and \r\n  necessary party based upon the testimony at the Hearing?\" Bard never moved before \r\n  the Single Commissioner to add Davol as a party. Instead, the issue before the \r\n  Single Commissioner was whether Bard was Muir's employer when he contracted \r\n  hepatitis C. \r\nIn Glenn v. Columbia Silica Sand \r\n  Co., 236 S.C. 13, 112 S.E.2d 711 (1960), our Supreme Court noted: \r\n\"In the case of occupational disease, \r\n  liability is most frequently assigned to the carrier who was on the risk when \r\n  the disease resulted in disability, if the employment at the time of disability \r\n  was of a kind contributing to the disease . . . . Occupational disease cases \r\n  typically show a long history of exposure without actual disability, culminating \r\n  in the enforced cessation of work on a definite date. In the search for an identifiable \r\n  instant in time which can . . . fix the employer and insurer liable for compensation \r\n  [for an occupational disease], the date of disability has been found the most \r\n  satisfactory.\" \r\nGlenn, 236 S.C. at 19-20, \r\n  112 S.E.2d at 714. This Court, in Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 S.C. \r\n  378, 386, 335 S.E.2d 91, 96 (Ct. App. 1985), refused to adopt the apportionment \r\n  rule \"under which liability is apportioned among all the employee's employers, \r\n  and their carriers, whose conditions of employment were of the type contributing \r\n  to the disease.\" We found it would place an unduly harsh burden on an employee \r\n  to notify, file a claim, and prove a compensable injury against the many employers \r\n  whose conditions of employment may have contributed to his injury. Id. \r\n  See also Reese v. CCI Constr. Co., Op. No. 2948 (S.C. Ct. App. \r\n  filed February 22, 1999)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 8 at 1)(finding that although \r\n  carpenter had only worked for employer for three days at time of diagnosis of \r\n  occupational disease, employer may be liable under act). \r\nAccording to Dr. Yantis, it takes \r\n  three to six months from the time of exposure until hepatitis C causes problems \r\n  with the liver. He noted a person can have hepatitis \"for awhile [sic] and have \r\n  very little indication of damage.\" He said \"the average time, from the time \r\n  of exposure until the time of severe liver damage leading to cirrhosis, is about \r\n  16 years.\" He opined Muir had hepatitis C as early as 1986. \r\nMuir's work with Bard was the type \r\n  that could lead to exposure to hepatitis. Nothing in the evidence indicates \r\n  Muir had hepatitis prior to Bard's purchase of Davol. Although Muir pleaded \r\n  in his Form 50 that his hepatitis was caused by \"handl[ing] unsanitary catheters \r\n  without gloves,\" the evidence demonstrates Muir was also exposed when the gloves \r\n  he wore tore or leaked and when he punctured himself with the scissors, knives \r\n  or needles he was using to dissect the catheters. Bard's own witness, Dr. Brown, \r\n  further minimized the significance of Muir's failure to use gloves while working \r\n  for Davol. According to Dr. Brown: \"Transmission of HCV has not been documented \r\n  from contact of intact skin with HCV infected blood or body fluids.\" Following \r\n  Hanks, we find no error in the Commission's failure to add Davol as a \r\n  party. \r\nV. Compliance with \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-70 (1985) \r\nBard maintains the Circuit Court \r\n  erred in affirming the Commission's conclusion Muir's claim complied with S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-70 (1985). We disagree. \r\nSection 42-11-70 provides: \r\nNeither an employee nor his dependents \r\n  shall be entitled to compensation for disability or death from an occupational \r\n  disease, except that due to exposure to ionizing radiation, unless such disease \r\n  was contracted within one year after the last exposure to the hazard peculiar \r\n  to his employment which caused the disease, save that in the case of a pulmonary \r\n  disease arising out of the inhalation of organic or inorganic dusts the period \r\n  shall be two years. \r\nThe hazard peculiar to Muir's employment \r\n  was exposure to the hepatitis C virus through the used catheters. The evidence \r\n  indicates that, in addition to the time period he did not wear gloves, Muir \r\n  was exposed to the virus when the gloves he wore tore or leaked and when he \r\n  punctured himself while dissecting the catheters. Muir was last exposed to the \r\n  catheters in August, 1992. We find Muir's claim meets the requirements of Â§ \r\n  42-11-70. \r\nVI. Notice Requirement, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985) \r\nBard avers the Circuit Court erred \r\n  in refusing to reverse the Commission's decision that Muir gave timely notice \r\n  of his claim pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985). \r\nSection 42-15-20 requires an injured \r\n  employee to \"immediately on the occurrence of an accident, or as soon thereafter \r\n  as practicable, give or cause to be given to the employer a notice of the accident.\" \r\n  Generally, the injury is not compensable unless notice is given within ninety \r\n  days. Id. With an occupational disease, the \"accident\" occurs when the \r\n  employee becomes disabled and could, through reasonable diligence, discover \r\n  that his condition is compensable. Bailey v. Covil Corp., 291 S.C. 417, \r\n  354 S.E.2d 35 (1987); Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 S.C. 378, 335 S.E.2d \r\n  91 (Ct. App. 1985). In occupational disease cases, compensability accrues at \r\n  the time of death or disability. See Glenn v. Columbia Silica Sand \r\n  Co., 236 S.C. 13, 112 S.E.2d 711 (1960). \r\nBard argues Muir did not give timely \r\n  notice of injury because he was not reasonable in discovering the nature of \r\n  his medical problems. It does not dispute Muir's testimony that he \r\ninformed his superiors at Bard in \r\n  the spring of 1992 of his diagnosis and belief that he had contracted the hepatitis \r\n  through handling the catheters. \r\nNotice begins to run when the employee \r\n  becomes disabled and could discover with reasonable diligence his condition \r\n  is compensable. Muir did not become disabled by his condition until August, \r\n  1992. Therefore, Muir had actually given notice of the nature of his disease \r\n  before he became disabled. \r\nWe find Muir was not unreasonable \r\n  in his discovery that his condition was compensable. Although Muir's blood work \r\n  indicated abnormalities, his treating physician, Dr. Campbell, was not overly \r\n  concerned until March of 1992 when his white blood cell, red blood cell, and \r\n  platelet count dropped precipitously. Muir was diagnosed with hepatitis C in \r\n  April, 1992, and had given notice to several of his superiors in May, 1992. \r\n  \r\nVII. Statute of \r\n  Limitations, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. 1998) \r\nBard contends Muir's claim was barred \r\n  by the statute of limitations prescribed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. \r\n  1998). We find this argument manifestly without merit. \r\nPursuant to Â§ 42-15-40, \"[t]he right \r\n  to compensation . . . is barred unless a claim is filed with the commission \r\n  within two years after an accident . . . . However, for occupational disease \r\n  claims the two-year period does not begin to run until the employee concerned \r\n  has been diagnosed definitively as having an occupational disease and has been \r\n  notified of the diagnosis.\" Muir was diagnosed with hepatitis C on April 21, \r\n  1992. He filed his original Form 50 to initiate the claim on March 30, 1993, \r\n  not July 25, 1995, as Bard asserts in its brief. Accordingly, we find Muir's \r\n  claim is not barred by the statute of limitations. \r\nVIII. Laches \r\nBard maintains Muir's claim is barred \r\n  by the doctrine of laches. We disagree. \r\nLaches is neglect for an unreasonable \r\n  and unexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for \r\n  diligence, to do what in law should have been done. Mid-State Trust, II v. \r\n  Wright, 323 S.C. 303, 474 S.E.2d 421 (1996). See also Provident \r\n  Life and Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 451 S.E.2d 924 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994)(laches is negligent failure to act for unreasonable period of time). \r\n  Under the doctrine of laches, if a party, knowing his rights, does not timely \r\n  assert them, but by unreasonable delay causes his adversary to incur expenses \r\n  or otherwise detrimentally change his position, then equity will ordinarily \r\n  refuse to enforce these rights. Id. Importantly, delay in the assertion \r\n  of a right does not, in and of itself, constitute laches. Mid-State Trust, \r\n  supra. Rather, so long as there is no knowledge of the wrong committed \r\n  and no refusal to embrace opportunity to ascertain facts, there can be no laches. \r\n  Id.; Archambault v. Sprouse, 218 S.C. 500, 63 S.E.2d 459 (1951). \r\n  The failure to assert a right does not come into existence until there is a \r\n  reason or situation that demands assertion. Mid-State Trust, supra. \r\n  The party asserting laches must satisfactorily show negligence, the opportunity \r\n  to have acted sooner, and material prejudice. Provident Life and Accident, \r\n  supra. See also Mid-State, supra (party asserting \r\n  laches must show it has been materially prejudiced by other party's delay). \r\n  The burden of proof is upon the person claiming laches. Provident Life and \r\n  Accident, supra. Finally, whether laches applies in a particular \r\n  situation is highly fact-specific, so each case must be judged on its own merits. \r\n  Mid-State, supra. \r\nBard argues it was prejudiced by \r\n  Muir's failure to timely pursue his claim. It asserts Muir did not mention the \r\n  individuals he allegedly notified about his problems until the hearing. However, \r\n  in a deposition taken August 23, 1993, Muir testified he told Tom Clark and \r\n  Joe Diaz of his problems soon after reading a report the plant nurse provided \r\n  him on April 22, 1992. At the hearing, Muir stated he told John Dillinger about \r\n  his diagnosis of hepatitis and his belief the illness was work related. Muir's \r\n  failure to mention Dillinger earlier is harmless as his discussions with Clark \r\n  and Diaz fulfilled the notice requirements of Â§ 42-15-20. Although Muir did \r\n  not call Clark or Diaz as witnesses, there is no evidence in the record that \r\n  Bard was prevented from calling them. \r\nFurthermore, this case involved a \r\n  medically complex issue that necessitated extensive discovery. Muir withdrew \r\n  his request for a hearing once to allow for additional discovery. Thereafter, \r\n  Bard asked for a continuance of a scheduled hearing to allow for discovery. \r\n  We do not find Muir was unreasonable in pursuing his claim. \r\nIX. Credit for \r\n  Short and Long Term Disability Payments \r\nBard avers it is entitled to a credit \r\n  for short term and long term disability payments made to Muir under its group \r\n  benefits plan. We disagree. \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-210 \r\n  (1985) reads: \r\nAny payments made by an employer \r\n  to an injured employee during the period of his disability, or to his dependents, \r\n  which by the terms of this Title were not due and payable when made may, subject \r\n  to the approval of the Commission, be deducted from the amount to be paid as \r\n  compensation; provided, that in the case of disability such deductions \r\n  shall be made by shortening the period during which compensation must be paid \r\n  and not by reducing the amount of the weekly payment (emphasis in original). \r\n  \r\nThe approval of the Commission for \r\n  such deduction is required by Â§ 42-9-210. The Commission's conclusions are binding \r\n  on appeal unless there is an absence of competent evidence to support them. \r\n  Brittle v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 241 S.C. 255, 127 S.E.2d 884 (1962). \r\n  In order for payments to be deductible, they must have been made with reference \r\n  to liability under the provisions of the Act and intended to be in lieu of compensation. \r\n  Id. \"Since only those payments are deductible which are made in contemplation \r\n  of the legal obligation of the employer to pay compensation to a disabled employee, \r\n  the intent with which such payments are made becomes important.\" Brittle, \r\n  241 S.C. at 258, 127 S.E.2d at 885. \r\nThe payments Muir received were from \r\n  a benefits plan to which Muir had contributed premiums. Bard denied Muir's injuries \r\n  were compensable. We find no evidence in the record that the payments were made \r\n  with reference to liability under the Act and in lieu of compensation. We rule \r\n  Bard was not entitled to a credit for the payments.(1) \r\n  \r\nX. Evidentiary \r\n  Rulings \r\nFinally, Bard argues the Commission \r\n  made several prejudicial and erroneous evidentiary rulings warranting reversal \r\n  of its decision. We disagree. \r\nFirst, we note Bard's arguments are \r\n  so conclusory that they may be deemed abandoned. Solomon v. City Realty Co., \r\n  262 S.C. 198, 203 S.E.2d 435 (1974) (conclusory argument is deemed abandoned); \r\n  Fields v. Melrose Limited Partnership, 312 S.C. 102, 439 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1993)(issue is deemed abandoned on appeal and, therefore, not presented \r\n  for review, if it is argued in a short, conclusory statement without supporting \r\n  authority). Nonetheless, we will review each argument in turn. \r\nBard contends the Commissioner erred \r\n  in admitting Dr. Russell's report dated March 7, 1997. As found above, Bard \r\n  waived its right to cross-examine Dr. Russell by failing to depose him or call \r\n  him as a witness to testify. We find no error in the admission of the report. \r\n  Furthermore, the report is cumulative to Dr. Russell's first report and the \r\n  other evidence in the record. We, therefore, find its admission harmless. See \r\n  Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996)(admission of improper \r\n  evidence is harmless where it is merely cumulative to other evidence). \r\nBard next challenges the admission \r\n  of letters from Dr. Lyle L. Sensenbrenner, Dr. Elaine K. Jeter, and Dr. G. F. \r\n  Worsham asserting Muir failed to lay a sufficient foundation for the letters, \r\n  which contained hearsay. \r\n  \r\nDr. Jeter of the American Red Cross \r\n  stated in her letter that the donors for Muir's transfusions had tested nonreactive \r\n  for all hepatitis related tests. Dr. Worsham of Roper Hospital wrote in his \r\n  letter that all units of blood provided to the hospital \"had been tested negative\" for the hepatitis C antibody during the period Muir was transfused. Dr. Campbell \r\n  testified in her deposition that the donors for the prediagnosis transfusions \r\n  tested negative for hepatitis C. This testimony was admitted without objection. \r\n  In addition, Dr. Russell stated in his first report that the transfusions were \r\n  not contaminated with hepatitis C virus. We find the letters from Dr. Jeter \r\n  and Dr. Worsham were cumulative to Dr. Campbell's testimony. Therefore, any \r\n  error in the admission of the letters was harmless. See Taylor, \r\n  supra (admission of improper evidence is harmless where it is merely \r\n  cumulative to other evidence). \r\nIn a letter dated October 20, 1994, \r\n  Dr. Sensenbrenner, Director of the Bone Marrow Transplantation Program at Harper \r\n  Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, stated myelodysplasia frequently follows aplastic \r\n  anemia, \"myelodysplasia presents looking like aplastic anemia,\" and the two \r\n  are \"very hard to tell apart in about 15% of myelodysplasia cases.\" Dr. Campbell \r\n  testified myelodysplasia is related to aplastic anemia. Further, in Dr. Russell's \r\n  report dated September 19, 1996, he wrote there is medical literature associating \r\n  aplastic anemia with progression to myelodysplasia. We conclude the letter from \r\n  Dr. Sensenbrenner was cumulative to Dr. Campbell's testimony and Dr. Russell's \r\n  report. Concomitantly, any error in the admission of the letter was harmless. \r\n  See Taylor, supra (admission of improper evidence is harmless \r\n  where it is merely cumulative to other evidence). \r\nBard claims Muir failed to lay a \r\n  proper foundation for the EtO label. The efficacy of EtO sterilization was discussed \r\n  with specificity by Dr. Roger Russell and Elizabeth Bruette. The label is cumulative \r\n  to the testimony of Dr. Russell and Bruette. Thus, any error in the admission \r\n  of the label is harmless. Id. \r\nLastly, Bard maintains the admission \r\n  of Rivers Reams's deposition was error. In the one page of the deposition in \r\n  the record, Reams discusses the condition of the catheters. His testimony is \r\n  cumulative to Muir's and his assistant's descriptions of the catheters. Accordingly, \r\n  we find any error in its admission harmless. Id. \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\nWe hold the trial court did not err \r\n  in (1) affirming the Full Commission's decision Muir contracted an occupational \r\n  disease, hepatitis C, as a direct result of his employment with Bard; (2) affirming \r\n  the Full Commission's conclusion Muir's aplastic anemia and myelodysplasia were \r\n  caused by hepatitis C; (3) refusing to find the Commission violated Bard's due \r\n  process rights; (4) failing to rule the Commission should have added Davol as \r\n  a defendant; (5) affirming the Commission's conclusion Muir's claim complied \r\n  with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-70; (6) refusing to reverse the Commission's decision \r\n  Muir gave timely notice of his claim pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20; \r\n  (7) failing to reverse the Commission's ruling Muir's claim was not barred by \r\n  the statute of limitations, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40; (8) refusing to reverse \r\n  the Commission's holding Muir's claim was not barred by the doctrine of laches; \r\n  (9) failing to award Bard a credit for short and long term disability payments \r\n  it made to Muir; and (10) failing to find the Commission made prejudicial and \r\n  erroneous evidentiary rulings warranting reversal of its decision. Accordingly, \r\n  the order of the Circuit Court is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1. We \r\n  take no position on Bard's subrogation rights. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3013","title":"Dixon v.

We affirm. \r\nBACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nThe parties married in 1991, and \r\n  their only child, Steven, was born in November of that year. The parties separated \r\n  in 1993 and entered into an agreement providing for joint custody of the child. \r\n  While the custody arrangement was labeled joint, it more nearly approximated \r\n  divided custody, as they alternated physical custody of the child every two \r\n  weeks. The agreement was incorporated into a decree of divorce dated October \r\n  3, 1994. \r\nA year later, Father brought this \r\n  action seeking full custody of the minor child, alleging a substantial change \r\n  of circumstances. Mother counterclaimed, also alleging a substantial change \r\n  of circumstances justifying a change in custody in her favor. \r\nAfter a hearing on the merits, the \r\n  family court granted primary custody to Mother and secondary custody to Father. \r\n  Mother's primary custody, however, was conditioned upon her moving to Kershaw \r\n  County where Father resides. Both parties filed post-trial motions seeking to \r\n  amend the order. The family court denied Father's post-trial motion to alter \r\n  custody and granted Mother's request to amend the visitation schedule. This \r\n  appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\nOn appeal from the family court, \r\n  this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of \r\n  the preponderance of the evidence. Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, \r\n  440 S.E.2d 884 (1994). This broad scope of review, however, does not relieve \r\n  the appellant of the burden of convincing us that the family court committed \r\n  error. Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 252 S.E.2d 891 (1979). Nor are \r\n  we required to ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, \r\n  was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative \r\n  weight to their testimonies. Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280 S.E.2d \r\n  541 (1981). Because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation \r\n  of witnesses, it should accord great deference to trial court findings where \r\n  matters of credibility are involved. See Aiken County Dep't of Soc. \r\n  Servs.&nbsp;v. Wilcox, 304 S.C. 90, 403 S.E.2d 142 (Ct. App. 1991). \"This \r\n  is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best interests of children.\" \r\n  Id. at 93, 403 S.E.2d at 144. \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Father argues the family \r\n  court erred in granting primary custody of the child to Mother. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nIn any child custody controversy, \r\n  the controlling considerations are the child's welfare and best interests. Cook \r\n  v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 245 S.E.2d 612 (1978). The family court should consider \r\n  how the custody decision will impact all areas of the child's life, including \r\n  physical, psychological, spiritual, educational, familial, emotional, and recreational \r\n  aspects. Pountain v. Pountain, 332 S.C. 130, 503 S.E.2d 757 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998). Additionally, the court must assess each party's character, fitness, \r\n  and attitude as they impact the child. Id. at 136, 503 S.E.2d at 760. \r\n  \"[T]he totality of circumstances peculiar to each case constitutes the only \r\n  scale upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.\" Davenport v. Davenport, \r\n  265 S.C. 524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975). \r\nWhen a party seeks to alter a joint \r\n  custody arrangement, the party has the burden of establishing a material change \r\n  of circumstances substantially affecting the child's welfare. Allison v. \r\n  Eudy, 330 S.C. 427, 499 S.E.2d 227 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing Pinckney v. \r\n  Hudson, 294 S.C. 332, 364 S.E.2d 462 (1988)); see Pitt v. Olds, \r\n  333 S.C. 478, 511 S.E.2d 60 (1999). Such a change in circumstances simply means \r\n  that sufficient facts have been shown to conclude that the best interests of \r\n  the child would be served by the change. Pitt, 333 S.C. at 481, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  at 61. \r\nIn the instant case, both parties \r\n  acknowledge that the previous joint custody arrangement is no longer viable. \r\n  Furthermore, the family court found \"that substantial changes in circumstances \r\n  exist requiring a change in the custody of the minor child.\" Neither party appealed \r\n  this finding and thus, it becomes the law of the case. See Lindsay \r\n  v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. 329, 491 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1997), cert. denied \r\n  (June 18, 1998) (explaining that an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is \r\n  the law of the case). Our review, therefore, is limited to whether the family \r\n  court erred in awarding primary custody to Mother instead of Father. \r\nWe note that both parties remarried \r\n  during the pendency of this litigation. The record reveals that the child has \r\n  adapted well to both step-parents and both step-parents are capable and willing \r\n  to assist with parenting the child. \r\nAlthough Mother has changed jobs \r\n  numerous times since the date of the divorce while Father has maintained the \r\n  same employment, all but Mother's current job represented a lateral career move \r\n  or an opportunity for career advancement. The family court expressed concern \r\n  over Mother's \"apparent lack of perseverance in her employment opportunities,\" \r\n  but noted Mother's current employment permits her flexibility such that she \r\n  is readily available for the child. As well, the family court observed that \r\n  Mother's current position affords her the potential to increase her salary and \r\n  her spouse earns a substantial income. While we understand the family court's \r\n  concern over Mother's frequent employment changes, we agree that Mother's current \r\nemployment is beneficial to the child.\r\nBoth Mother and Father have relocated \r\n  since the time of the divorce. Although Father lives in the same mobile home, \r\n  he has relocated the home within Kershaw County. Mother, on the other hand has \r\n  made numerous moves, living in an apartment in Kershaw County for approximately \r\n  one year, in the home of a female friend in Columbia for one month, and in the \r\n  home of another female friend in Kershaw County for about one and one-half years. \r\n  Currently, Mother lives with her husband in his Pontiac home, together with \r\n  his two children. The family court found no indication the child was negatively \r\n  impacted by Mother's relocations. We specifically note that Mother's relocations \r\n  did not interfere with the parties' joint custody arrangement and the child \r\nremained in the same day care center.\r\nThe family court determined that \r\n  Mother had developed a more appropriate parental relationship with the child \r\n  than Father. This conclusion was supported by the testimony of Dr. Paul E. Van \r\n  Wyke who conducted psychological evaluations at the request of the Guardian \r\n  ad Litem. After assessing both parties and the child, Dr. Van Wyke recommended \r\n  that custody be granted to Mother. Doctor Van Wyke based his recommendation, \r\n  in part, on his conclusion that Mother would more likely promote the individuation \r\n  of the child and foster a healthy sense of his independence. Doctor Van Wyke \r\n  noted that after Father remarried, he and the child still slept in the same \r\n  bed while the new wife slept in a different bed. Furthermore, Dr. Van&nbsp;Wyke \r\n  observed that Mother seems to be more willing to appropriately discipline the \r\n  child when needed. Although Dr. Van Wyke acknowledged that Father would make \r\n  a suitable primary custodian, he noted Father has developed a competitive rather \r\n  than cooperative relationship with Mother. \r\nAs to Father's implication that the \r\n  family court failed to adequately consider the child's close relationships with \r\n  his nearby family, we note the court specifically conditioned the award of primary \r\n  custody to Mother upon Mother moving to Kershaw County. Thus, we find no merit \r\n  in Father's contention. \r\nWe recognize that custody determinations \r\n  are difficult, especially in a case such as this where both parties appear to \r\n  be capable and loving parents. However, based upon the record before us and \r\n  the granting of appropriate deference to the family court that had the opportunity \r\n  to view the witnesses and observe their demeanor, we find no abuse of discretion \r\n  on the part of the family court in awarding primary custody to Mother. See \r\n  Pountain, 332 S.C. at 136, 503 S.E.2d at 760 (\"Custody decisions are \r\n  matters left largely to the discretion of the trial court.\"); Wilcox, \r\n  304 S.C. at 93, 403 S.E.2d at 144 (indicating that an appellate court should \r\n  accord due deference to trial court findings when matters of credibility are \r\n  involved). \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the \r\n  family court is \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3014","title":"SC Department of Social Services v.

On April 12, 1993, the Richland County Department \r\n  of Social Services (DSS) received a report that Rodricuv tested positive for \r\n  syphilis and marijuana at birth. The report was substantiated. DSS referred \r\n  Mother to the Lexington/Richland Alcohol and Drug Abuse Council (LRADAC) for \r\n  treatment services, but Mother failed to follow through with the referral. Subsequently, \r\n  DSS was informed that Deborah tested positive for syphilis at birth. DSS continued \r\n  to offer Mother rehabilitative services, including drug abuse counseling at \r\n  LRADAC. \r\n  \r\nOn July 1, 1994, DSS was notified \r\n  Mother was staying at a local motel and was using cocaine in the presence of \r\n  the minor children. Although Mother tested positive for cocaine on the same \r\n  day, DSS elected not to take Deborah and Rodricuv into emergency protective \r\n  custody. On August 9, 1994, DSS received a report alleging: (1) Mother had failed \r\n  to seek necessary medical care for the children; (2) she was not providing proper \r\n  infant care for the children; and (3) the family apartment and the children \r\n  were in a dirty and unsanitary condition. The report was verified upon investigation. \r\n  The Columbia Police Department took the children into protective services. By \r\n  order dated September 14, 1994, the Family Court granted DSS custody of the \r\n  children. \r\n  \r\nA merits hearing was held October \r\n  6, 1994. The Family Court found Mother had medically and physically neglected \r\n  the children. The Court granted custody of the children to one of Mother's relatives. \r\n  However, Mother's relative voluntarily relinquished custody to DSS on December \r\n  30, 1994. According to the relative, Mother was involved with drugs and was \r\n  disrupting the relative's household. The children were thereafter returned to \r\n  foster care and remain in that status. DSS had no contact with Mother from December \r\n  30,1994 until February 8, 1995, when Mother called the DSS caseworker and reported \r\n  she was still using drugs but wanted help. The next day, the DSS caseworker \r\n  attempted to visit Mother at her last known address, but the home was vacant. \r\n  As a result of a review hearing held March 2, 1995, the Court (1) relieved DSS \r\n  of its obligation to offer Mother treatment services and (2) approved a termination \r\n  of parental rights (TPR) and adoption plan. \r\n  \r\nOn June 1, 1995, Mother visited the \r\n  DSS caseworker at her office. The caseworker informed Mother about the TPR and \r\n  adoption plan. Additional rehabilitative services were offered and Mother was \r\n  notified that a Foster Care Review Board hearing was scheduled for June 7, 1995. \r\n  During the meeting, Mother told the caseworker that Rico Taylor was Deborah's \r\n  father, and he was incarcerated at the Richland County Detention Center on charges \r\n  of drug trafficking. On the same day, the caseworker contacted the Richland \r\n  County Detention Center to obtain information as to Father. She was informed \r\n  Father was indeed incarcerated at the Richland County Detention Center. \r\n  \r\nOn June 6, 1995, the DSS caseworker \r\n  mailed a letter to Father at the Richland County Detention Center informing \r\n  him DSS was involved with Deborah and Mother had named him as Deborah's father. \r\n  The letter included the caseworker's name and office number. The June 6, 1995, \r\n  letter was not returned to the caseworker. On October 28, 1995, the caseworker \r\n  sent a second letter to Father, inviting him to appear before the Foster Care \r\n  Review Board. The October 28, 1995, letter was returned to the caseworker with \r\n  a notation that Father was no longer at the Richland County Detention Center. \r\n  The caseworker never spoke with Father. She received no correspondence from \r\n  him. \r\n  \r\n DSS filed a summons and complaint \r\n  on March 13, 1996, seeking TPR as to, among others, Father. He was personally \r\n  served with the summons and complaint on March 22, 1996, at the federal penitentiary \r\n  in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was incarcerated. In response, Father drafted \r\n  a letter, dated March 23, 1996, opposing the termination. Although Father mailed \r\n  the letter to the address provided on the summons, the letter was returned to \r\n  him marked \"Address Unknown.\" By order dated March 3, 1997, the Family Court \r\n  appointed a guardian ad litem and an attorney for Father. On May 12, 1997, Father \r\n  filed an answer denying his parental rights should be terminated. \r\n  \r\nThe Family Court terminated the parental \r\n  rights of both Mother(2) and Father after a TPR \r\n  hearing on August 11, 1997. In support of its decision to grant TPR, the Court \r\n  found Father had failed to visit or support Deborah. Specifically, the Court \r\n  determined Father (1) had seen Deborah only once, when she was two months old; \r\n  (2) had neither provided Deborah with financial support nor made any material \r\n  contribution to her care; and (3) was arrested in July of 1994 on drug charges \r\n  and incarcerated continuously since that time. Father contended he was unable, \r\n  due to his incarceration, to perform his parental duties, and he had made efforts \r\n  to rehabilitate himself during his incarceration. However, the Court concluded \r\n  any difficulties Father experienced due to being incarcerated resulted directly \r\n  from his voluntary course of lawlessness. In holding TPR was in Deborah's best \r\n  interest, the Court noted, absent a successful appeal, Father's anticipated \r\n  date of release is 2004. The Family Court terminated Father's parental rights. \r\n  This appeal followed. \r\n  \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Is incarceration a reasonable \r\n  excuse for failure to visit and support a child? \r\n  \r\nII. Was there clear and convincing \r\n  evidence to support the termination of Father's parental rights ? \r\n  \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\nA ground for termination of parental \r\n  rights must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Greenville County \r\n  Dep't of Social Services v. Bowes, 313 S.C. 188, 194, 437 S.E.2d 107, 110 \r\n  (1993) (\"This Court cannot sanction the precipitous termination of parental \r\n  rights based on emotionally charged complaints not proved to the level of this \r\n  objective standard\");  see also South Carolina Dep't of Social \r\n  Servs v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 52, 413 S.E.2d 835, 838 (1992) (citing Santosky \r\n  v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982) (U.S. Supreme \r\n  Court held that \"[b]efore a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights \r\n  of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support \r\n  its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence\")). \r\n  \r\n In a termination of parental rights \r\n  case, the appellate court has jurisdiction to review the entire record to determine \r\n  the facts in accordance with its view of the evidence. Richland County Dep't \r\n  of Social Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 496 S.E.2d 864 (1998). This Court \r\n  may review the record and make its own findings as to whether clear and convincing \r\n  evidence supports termination. Broome, supra. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Consideration of \r\n  Incarceration \r\n  \r\nFather argues the Court erred in \r\n  terminating his parental rights on the basis of his criminal misconduct and \r\n  consequent incarceration, which he asserts are not statutory grounds for termination. \r\n  We reject this contention inasmuch as it stems from Father's misapprehension \r\n  of the Family Court's order. Regarding Father's incarceration, the Family Court \r\n  found: \r\n  \r\nAlthough [Father] contends he has \r\n  been unable to perform his parental responsibilities due to his incarceration \r\n  and that he has made efforts to rehabilitate himself during this time, he overlooks \r\n  the important fact that his criminal conduct was voluntary and the true cause \r\n  of his being unable to fulfill his parental responsibility. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHowever, a careful reading of the \r\n  order leads to the ineluctable conclusion that Father's parental rights were \r\n  terminated pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (3) &amp; (4) (Supp. 1998). \r\n  That section provides for termination where: \r\n  \r\n(3) The child has lived outside the \r\n  home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent \r\n  has wilfully failed to visit the child. The court may attach little or no weight \r\n  to incidental visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was not prevented \r\n  from visiting by the party having custody or by court order. The distance of \r\n  the child's placement from the parent's home must be taken into consideration \r\n  when determining the ability to visit; \r\n  \r\n(4) The child has lived outside the \r\n  home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent \r\n  has wilfully failed to support the child. Failure to support means that the \r\n  parent has failed to make a material contribution to the child's care. A material \r\n  contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parent's \r\n  means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for \r\n  the care of the child according to the parent's means. The court may consider \r\n  all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully \r\n  failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian \r\n  and the ability of the parent to provide support. \r\n  \r\nThe Family Court properly considered \r\n  Father's criminal misconduct and incarceration in determining whether or not \r\n  Father had established a reasonable excuse for failing to visit or support Deborah. \r\n  See Hamby v. Hamby, 264 S.C. 614, 216 S.E.2d 536 (1975) (wherein \r\n  our Supreme Court affirmed a finding of abandonment where Father voluntarily \r\n  pursued a course of lawlessness resulting in his imprisonment and inability \r\n  to perform parental duties); See also South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Soc. Servs. v. Phillips, 301 S.C. 308, 391 S.E.2d 584 (Ct. App. 1990). \r\n  We find no error. \r\n  \r\nII. Wilful Failure \r\n  to Visit and Support \r\n  \r\nNext, Father asserts clear and convincing \r\n  evidence does not support the Family Court's finding that he wilfully failed \r\n  to visit and support Deborah. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nWhether a parent's failure to visit \r\n  or support a child is \"willful\" within the meaning of Â§20-7-1572 is a question \r\n  of intent to be determined from all the facts and circumstances in each case. \r\n  South Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 52, 413 S.E.2d \r\n  835, 838 (1992). The trial judge is given wide discretion in making this determination. \r\n  Id.; Bevis v. Bevis, 254 S.C. 345, 175 S.E.2d 398 (1970). However, \r\n  the element of wilfulness must be established by clear and convincing evidence. \r\n  Broome, supra; Richberg v. Dawson, 278 S.C. 356, 296 S.E.2d \r\n  338 (1982). A parent's conduct which evinces a settled purpose to forego parental \r\n  duties may fairly be characterized as \"willful\" because it manifests a conscious \r\n  indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from \r\n  the parent. Hamby 264 S.C. 614, 216 S.E.2d 536. \r\n  \r\nFather, who remained incarcerated \r\n  at the time of trial, testified by way of deposition taken on August 8, 1997. \r\n  In his deposition, Father admitted: (1) he had never contributed financially \r\n  to Deborah's support and (2) he had not visited with her since she was approximately \r\n  two months old. Father denied his actions were wilful in nature. \r\n  \r\nRegarding his failure to visit with \r\n  Deborah, Father averred he had \"the chance to hold her a couple of times after \r\n  she was brought home.\" Father had no other contact with Deborah prior to his \r\n  incarceration in July of 1994. According to Father, he was not aware Deborah \r\n  had been taken into DSS custody until March of 1996, when he received the summons \r\n  and complaint seeking termination of his parental rights. \r\n  \r\nInitially, we note the record indicates \r\n  Father made no attempt to locate Deborah during the interim between his incarceration \r\n  in July of 1994 and his receipt of the summons and complaint in March of 1996. \r\n  Although Deborah was taken into protective custody in August of 1994, the DSS \r\n  caseworker was not informed of Father's identity and location until June of \r\n  1995. Immediately upon obtaining this information, the caseworker confirmed \r\n  Father's whereabouts and mailed Father a letter informing him of Deborah's status \r\n  at DSS. The caseworker admitted difficulty in corresponding with Father due \r\n  to the fact he was frequently transferred from prison to prison. However, the \r\n  June, 1995, letter was not returned to the caseworker as undelivered. The record \r\n  is devoid of any evidence, save Father's own denial, that the June, 1995, letter \r\n  did not reach its proper destination. \r\n  \r\nFather maintains he attempted to \r\n  respond to the summons and complaint and obtain information about Deborah via \r\n  a letter that was returned to him marked \"Address Unknown.\" However, Father \r\n  did not thereafter attempt to contact the attorney for DSS listed on the complaint. \r\n  Further, though Father avers he enlisted the help of his mother and sister in \r\n  determining Deborah's location after he received the summons and complaint in \r\n  March of 1996, Father's sister testified he did not discuss his daughter until \r\n  January or February, 1997. While Father's mother claimed she called DSS and \r\n  was refused any information, her testimony indicates her inquiry was geared \r\n  toward locating Deborah's mother, rather than obtaining information about whether \r\n  Father could visit with Deborah. Father's mother arranged a meeting with Father's \r\n  guardian ad litem, but forgot to attend the meeting and misplaced the guardian's \r\n  number. The guardian ad litem was asked for an address where Deborah could be \r\n  located, but the guardian was unable to obtain such information. Father failed \r\n  to make any inquiry as to the name of Deborah's DSS caseworker or the correct \r\n  address for the Richland County Department of Social Services. \r\n  \r\nMost tellingly, Father confirmed \r\n  he was appointed a guardian and an attorney in March of 1997, but never requested \r\n  either contact DSS on his behalf and arrange a visit with \r\nDeborah. Moreover, Father conceded \r\n  DSS did nothing to prevent him from visiting with Deborah. \r\n  \r\nSpecifically regarding his failure \r\n  to support Deborah prior to his incarceration and the commencement of these \r\n  proceedings, Father explained he was afraid to give Mother money or contribute \r\n  materially because of her drug problem. Concerning his failure to pay child \r\n  support during the pendency of these proceedings, Father insists he did not \r\n  know the site of Deborah until March of 1996. He further says DSS never notified \r\n  him of his obligation to pay child support. However, Father was employed while \r\n  incarcerated and earned between $30 and $35 per month. He spent the money he \r\n  earned on cigarettes, personal hygiene products, and phone calls. The Court \r\n  of Appeals addressed this issue in South Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. \r\n  Phillips, 301 S.C. 308, 391 S.E.2d 584 (Ct. App. 1990): \r\n  \r\nThe record supports the trial judge's \r\n  finding that the purchase of canteen food and cigarettes while in prison were \r\n  unnecessary expenses and Johnson's wages could not have been significantly depleted \r\n  by the occasional purchase of soap and personal grooming supplies. We further \r\n  find that Johnson's incarceration for an undisclosed offense did not relieve \r\n  him of his duty to support his child. \r\n  \r\nPhillips, 301 S.C. at 310, \r\n  391 S.E.2d at 585. \r\n  \r\nWhile we recognize Father made limited \r\n  efforts to find Deborah once he learned DSS intended to pursue termination of \r\n  his parental rights, there is no evidence he or anyone acting on his behalf \r\n  ever attempted to arrange for him to visit with Deborah during the course of \r\n  these proceedings. To the extent Father experienced difficulty in corresponding \r\n  with DSS due to his status as an inmate, we find his circumstances stemmed from \r\n  his own actions. In addition, nothing in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (3) &amp; \r\n  (4), as amended, requires a parent be \"notified\" of his duty to support or visit \r\n  Deborah before failure to discharge those duties may serve as grounds for termination \r\n  of parental rights. \r\n  \r\nIII. Best Interest \r\n  of the Child \r\n  \r\nFather maintains the Family Court \r\n  TPR order is not supported by clear and convincing evidence. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nIn a termination of parental rights \r\n  case, the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration. South \r\n  Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Vanderhorst, 287 S.C. 554, 340 S.E.2d 149 \r\n  (1986). Termination of parental rights statutes \"must be liberally construed \r\n  in order to ensure prompt judicial procedures for freeing minor children from \r\n  the custody and control of their parents by terminating the parent-child relationship. \r\n  The interests of the child shall prevail if the child's interest and the parental \r\n  rights conflict.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 1998). In Caban v. Mohammed, \r\n  441 U.S. 380, 99 S.Ct. 1760, 60 L.Ed.2d 297 (1979), the Supreme Court noted: \r\n  \"[p]arental rights do not spring full-blown from the biological connection between \r\n  parent and child. They require relationships more enduring.\" 441 U.S. at 397, \r\n  99 S.Ct. at 1770. \r\n  \r\nAn enduring relationship is not present \r\n  between Father and Deborah. Father has seen his daughter only once, when she \r\n  was 2 months old. He will not see her again until she is ten years old. Had \r\n  Father made a recognizable effort to visit with his daughter, or to provide \r\n  support for her, there may have been evidence of an \"enduring relationship.\" \r\n  However, because he has wilfully failed to visit or support her, the Family \r\n  Court is correct in finding termination of Father's parental rights in the best \r\n  interest of Deborah. \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe hold the record supports the Family \r\n  Court's determination Father wilfully failed to visit with and support Deborah. \r\n  We do not view Father's voluntary pursuit of lawless conduct, which resulted \r\n  in his incarceration and limited ability to personally correspond with DSS officials, \r\n  as a reasonable explanation of his failure to visit with and support Deborah. \r\n  See Hamby v. Hamby, 264 S.C. 614, 216 S.E.2d 536 (1975) (affirming \r\n  a finding of abandonment where Father voluntarily pursued a course of lawlessness \r\n  resulting in his imprisonment and inability to perform parental duties); see \r\n  also Department of Soc. Servs. v. Henry, 296 S.C. 507, 374 S.E.2d \r\n  298 (1988); South Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Phillips, 301 S.C. \r\n  308, 391 S.E.2d 584 (Ct. App. 1984). Our own review of the record convinces \r\n  us the Family Court correctly determined termination of Father's parental rights \r\n  is in Deborah's best interest. To date, Deborah has been in DSS custody for \r\n  nearly six years. As noted by the Family Court, her chances of being adopted \r\n  continue to decrease as she grows older. We fully agree with the Family Court \r\n  that Deborah's life \"must not be put on hold until her father is released from \r\n  prison and thereafter becomes able to care for her.\" There is clear and convincing \r\n  evidence in the record to support the order of the Family Court. \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the \r\n  Family Court is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1. Because oral \r\n  argument would not aid the Court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.

Code Ann. Â§ 17-24-40. \r\n  We affirm in part and vacate in part. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\nIn a 1995 bench trial, a Circuit \r\n  Court judge found Hudson not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) on four counts \r\n  of assault and battery with intent to kill. The parties have stipulated to the \r\n  following underlying facts: \r\n  \r\nAt approximately 3:30 p.m. on April \r\n  1, 1995 in Northwoods Mall, . . . Charleston County, Linda Derbyshire was walking \r\n  her two (2) children in a double stroller near the Easter Bunny display in the \r\n  center of the Mall. Her sixteen (16) month old baby girl, Nikki was asleep in \r\n  the back seat and her three (3) year old son Dane was riding in the front. \r\n  \r\nAs she passed by [Hudson], Mrs. Derbyshire \r\n  noticed [Hudson] staring fiercely at her son, Dane. Suddenly, [Hudson] lunged \r\n  at Dane with a pair of scissors in her hand. [Hudson] attempted to stab Dane \r\n  in his eyes and face and was able to inflict a serious wound to Dane's left \r\n  cheek before Mrs. Derbyshire could stop [Hudson]. And although Mrs. Derbyshire \r\n  was able to position herself between [Hudson] and her children, [Hudson] overpowered \r\n  and reached around Mrs. Derbyshire and stabbed Nikki in the left eye. Doctors \r\n  at the Medical University of South Carolina were able to save Nikki's left eye; \r\n  but she will never be able to see out of it, and there is only a fifty (50%) \r\n  percent chance she will be able to keep it. Mrs. Derbyshire received severe \r\n  lacerations to her arm during the assault. \r\n  \r\nAndrew Imholt and his 7 year old \r\n  son, Isaac, were passing by at the time of the attack. At first, Mr. Imholt \r\n  thought the two women were fighting about disciplining the children, but when \r\n  Mr. Imholt saw [Hudson] stab Nikki in the eye, he grabbed [Hudson] and attempted \r\n  to pull her back. [Hudson] spun away from Mr. Imholt's grasp and went after \r\n  his son. Mr. Imholt saw [Hudson] grab his son Isaac by the shoulder and attempt \r\n  to stab Isaac in the eye, but Mr. Imholt deflected [Hudson's] blow and Isaac \r\n  turned his head in time to receive only a cut to his right cheek. Mr. Imholt, \r\n  who was also cut on his hand during the assault, was again able to grab [Hudson] \r\n  from behind, and John Hurt was able to pry the scissors from her hand. Mr. Hurt, \r\n  Mr. Imholt, and others were able to subdue [Hudson] until Mall security and \r\n  the police arrived. \r\n  \r\nThe trial judge ordered Hudson committed \r\n  to the State Hospital for a mental evaluation. The court's order mandated the \r\n  evaluation be completed within one hundred twenty days so the Chief Administrative \r\n  Judge could hold a hearing to determine whether Hudson required hospitalization. \r\n  The mental health authorities charged with completing the evaluation and reporting \r\n  its results to the court failed to timely comply. \r\n  \r\nWhile committed to the state hospital \r\n  for her mental evaluation, Hudson participated in the Allan Project, an NGRI \r\n  treatment program operated by the Department of Mental Health. The program allows \r\n  an NGRI defendant to progress through a series of seven levels, each affording \r\n  the defendant an increasing degree of independence while decreasing the level \r\n  of supervision. A defendant who reaches level seven is deemed ready for discharge. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn April 25, 1997, the court held \r\n  a hearing to review Hudson's status. At the time of the hearing, Hudson, a diagnosed \r\n  paranoid schizophrenic, had achieved a level four status and could travel unsupervised \r\n  on public transportation to and from a state-sponsored work site. She also could \r\n  request passes to spend unsupervised periods of time in the community while \r\n  accompanied by another NGRI defendant or \"buddy.\" Hudson was allowed to take \r\n  money she earned with her during her unsupervised excursions from the hospital. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFollowing the hearing, the Chief \r\n  Administrative Judge issued an order finding Hudson \"in need of further hospitalization.\" \r\n  The judge ruled the South Carolina State Hospital violated S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  17-24-40 (1985) by allowing unsupervised leave by Hudson without prior notice \r\n  to and approval from the Chief Administrative Judge. He concluded, however, \r\n  that Hudson's participation in the Allan Project proved beneficial. The court \r\n  held the state hospital could continue to release Hudson unsupervised into the \r\n  community in accordance with her level four status. The judge further ordered \r\n  that, prior to Hudson's advance to level five and the concomitant privileges, \r\n  the state hospital must follow the statutory procedures and obtain approval \r\n  from the Chief Administrative Judge. Finally, the judge instructed the state \r\n  hospital to review the privileges granted to an NGRI defendant at level four \r\n  \"as prior court approval is required before patients are released into the community \r\n  unsupervised.\" \r\n  \r\nThe state's Attorney General, Charles \r\n  M. Condon, brought a declaratory and injunctive action to prohibit the Department \r\n  of Mental Health's release of NGRI defendants through \"buddy\" passes, work passes, \r\n  and community living passes until the Chief Administrative Judge ordered the \r\n  release of these defendants pursuant to the procedures of Â§ 17-24-40. This action \r\n  resulted in a consent order requiring the Department of Mental Health to obtain \r\n  approval from the appropriate Chief Administrative judge prior to allowing NGRI \r\n  defendants to take unsupervised leave in any form from hospital grounds. The \r\n  order prohibited the Allan Project's use of \"buddy passes.\" The consent order \r\n  provided that settlement of the declaratory and injunctive action did not affect \r\n  the State's appeal in the present case.  \r\n  \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\nDid the trial court err in authorizing \r\n  unsupervised leave from the state hospital by Hudson where the judge found Hudson \r\n  in need of \"continued\" hospitalization? \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Effect \r\n  of the 1997 Consent Order in State ex rel. Condon v. South \r\nCarolina \r\n  Department of Mental Health \r\n  \r\nHudson contends the State's consent \r\n  order with the Department of Mental Health renders the issue in this appeal \r\n  moot. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nA close reading of the consent order \r\n  in State ex rel. Condon v. South Carolina Department of Mental Healthreveals \r\n  the issue in the case sub judice was specifically preserved for this \r\n  appeal. The language of the order is instructive and edifying: \r\n  \r\n[T]he parties in this case disagree \r\n  as to the interpretation and requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-24-40 (Law. \r\n  Co-op. 1976) dealing with NGRI defendants and adamantly defend their positions \r\n  on the legal requirements of this statute . . . . \r\n  \r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\nThe settlement of this case does \r\n  not prohibit the State from taking a position in future litigation on the meaning \r\n  of the words confinement, hospitalization, and commitment \r\n  contained in section 17-24-40 with regard to NGRI defendants and does not affect \r\n  the State's appeal of State of South Carolina v. Ui Sun Hudson (emphasis \r\n  added). \r\n  \r\nThe consent order did not, nor could \r\n  it, resolve the issue on appeal in this case: whether a Circuit Court Chief \r\n  Administrative Judge can authorize the unsupervised leave of an NGRI defendant \r\n  the judge finds is in need of \"continued\" hospitalization under S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 17-24-40 (1985). While the consent order mandates the Department of Mental \r\n  Health receive prior court approval before releasing NGRI defendants on unsupervised \r\n  leave, it does not determine whether the court can actually approve such leave. \r\n  Even with the approval of a judge, the parties to a lawsuit cannot determine \r\n  the extent of judicial power under a statute. \r\n  \r\nII. Power of Chief \r\n  Administrative Judge to Authorize Unsupervised Leave By NGRI Defendant Judge \r\n  Finds in Need of \"Continued\" Hospitalization \r\n  \r\nThe State claims the trial court \r\n  erred in authorizing unsupervised leave from the state hospital by Hudson where \r\n  the judge found Hudson in need of \"continued\" hospitalization pursuant to Â§ \r\n  17-24-40. We agree. \r\n  \r\nAccording to the State, the Chief \r\n  Administrative Judge exceeded the powers granted him by the General Assembly \r\n  under Â§ 17-24-40, which vests the Chief Administrative Judge \"with the discretion \r\n  to determine whether [an NGRI] defendant is in need of hospitalization.\" State \r\n  v. Huiett, 302 S.C. 169, 173, 394 S.E.2d 486, 488 (1990). Section 17-24-40 \r\n  provides: \r\n  \r\n(A) In the event a verdict of \"not \r\n  guilty by reason of insanity\" is returned, the trial judge shall order the defendant \r\n  committed to the South Carolina State Hospital for a period not to exceed one \r\n  hundred twenty days. During that time an examination shall be made of the defendant \r\n  to determine the need for hospitalization of the defendant pursuant to the standards \r\n  set forth in Â§ 44-17-580 of the 1976 Code. \r\n  \r\n(B) A report of the findings shall \r\n  be made to the chief administrative judge of the circuit in which the trial \r\n  was held, the solicitor, the defendant, and the defendant's attorney. \r\n  \r\n(C)(1) Within fifteen days after \r\n  receipt of this report by the court, the chief administrative judge of the circuit \r\n  in which the trial was held shall hold a hearing to decide whether the defendant \r\n  should be hospitalized pursuant to the standard of Â§ 44-17-580 of the 1976 Code. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(2)(a) If the chief administrative \r\n  judge finds the defendant not to be in need of hospitalization, he may \r\n  order the defendant released upon such terms or conditions, if any, as he shall \r\n  deem appropriate for the safety of the community and the well-being of the defendant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(b) In the event the chief administrative \r\n  judge finds the defendant to be in need of hospitalization, he shall \r\n  order him committed to the South Carolina State Hospital. \r\n  \r\n(c) If at a later date it is determined \r\n  by officials of the State Hospital that the defendant is no longer in need of \r\n  hospitalization, they shall notify the chief administrative judge, the solicitor, \r\n  the defendant, and the defendant's attorney. Within twenty-one days after the \r\n  receipt of this notice the chief administrative judge, upon notice to all parties, \r\n  shall hold a hearing to determine whether the defendant is in need of continued \r\n  hospitalization pursuant to the standard of Â§ 44-17-580 of the 1976 Code. If \r\n  the finding of the court is that the defendant is in need of continued hospitalization, \r\n  it shall order his continued confinement. If its finding is that the defendant \r\n  is not in need of continued hospitalization, it may order the defendant released \r\n  upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the chief administrative judge shall \r\n  deem appropriate for the safety of the community and the well-being of the defendant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(D) Any terms and conditions imposed \r\n  by the chief administrative judge shall be therapeutic in nature, not punitive. \r\n  Therapeutic terms shall include, but not be limited to, requirements that the \r\n  defendant: \r\n  \r\n(1) continue taking medication for \r\n  an indefinite time and verify in writing the use of medication; \r\n(2) receive periodic examinations \r\n  and reviews by psychiatric personnel; \r\n(3) report periodically to the probation \r\n  office for an evaluation of his reaction to his environment and his general \r\n  welfare. \r\n  \r\n(E) The chief administrative judge \r\n  of the circuit in which the trial was held shall at all times have jurisdiction \r\n  over the defendant for the purposes of this chapter. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-24-40 (1985)(emphasis \r\n  added). \r\n  \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction \r\n  is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible. Strother \r\n  v. Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998); \r\n  City of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 486 S.E.2d 492 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n  All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative \r\n  intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, \r\n  and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of \r\n  the statute. Ray Bell Constr. Co. \r\nv. School Dist. of Greenville \r\n  County, 331 S.C. 19, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1998). The determination of legislative \r\n  intent is a matter of law. City of Sumter Police Dep't v. One (1) 1992 Blue \r\n  Mazda Truck, 330 S.C. 371, 498 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  \r\nThe legislature's intent should be \r\n  ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute. Stephen v. \r\n  Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996). Words must \r\n  be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced \r\n  construction which limits or expands the statute's operation. Rowe v. Hyatt, \r\n  321 S.C. 366, 468 S.E.2d 649 (1996); City of Sumter Police Dep't, supra. \r\n  When faced with an undefined statutory term, the court must interpret the term \r\n  in accord with its usual and customary meaning. Strother, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe terms must be construed in context \r\n  and their meaning determined by looking at the other terms used in the statute. \r\n  Southern Mut. Church Ins. Co. v. South Carolina Windstorm and Hail Underwriting \r\n  Ass'n, 306 S.C. 339, 412 S.E.2d 377 (1991). Courts should consider not merely \r\n  the language of the particular clause being construed, but the word and its \r\n  meaning in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy \r\n  of the law. Whitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1997). See \r\n  also Stephen, supra (statutory provisions should be given \r\n  reasonable and practical construction consistent with purpose and policy of \r\n  entire act). In interpreting a statute, the language of the statute must be \r\n  read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its \r\n  general purpose. Hitachi Data Systems Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, \r\n  420 S.E.2d 843 (1992); State v. Baucom, ___S.C.___, 513 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999). \r\n  \r\n If a statute's language is plain \r\n  and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no need \r\n  to employ rules of statutory interpretation and the court has no right to look \r\n  for or impose another meaning. Paschal v. State Election Comm'n, 317 \r\n  S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995); Brassell, supra. When the terms \r\n  of a statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their \r\n  literal meaning. Holley v. Mount Vernon Mills, Inc., 312 S.C. 320, 440 \r\n  S.E.2d 373 (1994). However, if the language of an act gives rise to doubt or \r\n  uncertainty as to legislative intent, the construing court may search for that \r\n  intent beyond the borders of the act itself. Baucom, supra. Any \r\n  ambiguity in a statute should be resolved in favor of a just, equitable, and \r\n  beneficial operation of the law. City of Sumter Police Dep't, supra. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe language of Â§ 17-24-40 is plain \r\n  and conveys a clear, definite meaning. After the initial evaluation, the Chief \r\n  Administrative Judge must choose the NGRI defendant's status. Either the defendant \r\n  is in need of hospitalization and must be committed to the state hospital \r\n  or the defendant is not in need of hospitalization and may be released \r\n  pursuant to any therapeutic conditions the judge elects. See Â§ 17-24-40. \r\n  The statute does not grant the Chief Administrative Judge the power to \r\n  authorize unsupervised leave by an NGRI defendant the judge finds in need of \r\n  \"continued\" hospitalization. Thus, the Chief Administrative Judge possesses \r\n  no discretion in this regard. \r\n  \r\nAlthough the General Assembly did \r\n  not define \"commitment,\" the plain meaning of this term, especially when juxtaposed \r\n  with the other statutory possibility, \"release,\" directs the defendant be confined \r\n  to the supervision of the state hospital. If state hospital officials request \r\n  a hearing upon their belief the NGRI defendant is no longer in need of hospitalization \r\n  and the court disagrees with this position, the court \"shall order [the NGRI \r\n  defendant's] continued confinement.\" Â§ 17-24-40(C)(2)(c) (emphasis added). \r\n  A defendant with unsupervised leave privileges could not, within the plain meaning \r\n  of the statute, be considered committed. Indubitably, the statute demonstrates \r\n  the legislature never envisioned that a committed NGRI patient could be released \r\n  to societal freedom on unsupervised, albeit temporary, leave from the state \r\n  hospital. \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe hold Â§ 17-24-40 does not empower \r\n  the Chief Administrative Judge to authorize unsupervised leave by an NGRI defendant \r\n  the judge determines needs \"continued\" hospitalization. Because the Chief Administrative \r\n  Judge found Hudson in need of \"continued\" hospitalization, Â§ 17-24-40 mandated \r\n  the judge commit Hudson to the state hospital. We rule Â§ 17-24-40 requires an \r\n  NGRI defendant who is in need of \"continued\" hospitalization be subject to \"continued \r\n  confinement.\" \"Confinement\" means the NGRI defendant is housed within the confines \r\n  of the state hospital. Unsupervised leave of any nature is prohibited while \r\n  an NGRI defendant is hospitalized. To the extent the Chief Administrative Judge's \r\n  order permits Hudson to take unsupervised leave from the hospital where she \r\n  is committed, it is VACATED. Accordingly, the judge's order is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and VACATED IN \r\n  PART. \r\n  \r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3016","title":"Richardson v.

The trial \r\n  court found Tamara was not a resident of her father's household at the time \r\n  of the accident, and therefore, was not entitled to stack. Tamara appeals. We \r\n  affirm. \r\n  \r\nOn May 8, 1993, Tamara, a twenty-five \r\n  year old graduate student, was driving an Isuzu Trooper owned by Burrows Transfer, \r\n  when Ellis Ernest Woodard crossed over the center line of the highway and hit \r\n  her. Woodward was killed in the accident and Tamara suffered serious injuries. \r\n  Woodard was driving an uninsured vehicle at the time. \r\n  \r\nOn January 3, 1994, Tamara filed \r\n  this action seeking a declaration that she was entitled to uninsured motorist \r\n  coverage under three policies.(1) In May 1994, \r\n  Farm Bureau paid $100,000.00, the policy limits, to Tamara under the policy \r\n  covering the Isuzu. Farm Bureau refused to tender the policy limits on the other \r\n  policies because Tamara did not live with her parents, and thus, was not a resident \r\n  relative for stacking purposes. \r\n \r\nBy agreement, the parties submitted \r\n  briefs to the trial court on the legal issue of whether Tamara was entitled \r\n  to stack. The trial court found as a matter of law that Tamara was not entitled \r\n  to stack and entered judgment in favor of Farm Bureau. \r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n  \r\nIn a non-jury action at law, the \r\n  judge's findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless they are without \r\n  evidentiary support. Rickborn v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 291, \r\n  468 S.E.2d 292 (1996). The trial court's findings of fact have the same force \r\n  and effect as a jury verdict unless it committed some error of law leading to \r\n  an erroneous conclusion or unless the evidence is reasonably susceptible of \r\n  the opposite conclusion only. Noisette v. Ismail, 299 S.C. 243, 384 S.E.2d \r\n  310 (Ct. App. 1989), rev'd on other grounds, 304 S.C. 56, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  122 (1991). We must affirm the trial court if there is any evidence that reasonably \r\n  supports its decision. Id. In reviewing the findings, we must view the \r\n  evidence and all its reasonable inferences in the light least favorable to the \r\n  losing party below. Id. \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe pivotal question in determining \r\n  whether an insured has the right to stack is whether he is a Class I or Class \r\n  II insured. Fireman's Ins. Co. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 295 \r\n  S.C. 538, 370 S.E.2d 85 (1988). The right to stack is available only to a Class \r\n  I insured. Id. A Class I insured is a named insured, his spouse, and \r\n  relatives residing in his household. Concrete Services, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity \r\n  &amp; Guar. Co., 331 S.C. 506, 498 S.E.2d 865 (1998). \r\n  \r\nAs a preliminary issue, Tamara must \r\n  establish that she is an insured under the Mercedes policy.(3) \r\n  Id. Tamara relies on Buddin v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., 250 \r\n  S.C. 332, 157 S.E.2d 633 (1967). In Buddin, the supreme court said a \r\n  \"resident of the same household is one, other than a temporary or transient \r\n  visitor, who lives together with others in the same house for a period of some \r\n  duration, although he may not intend to remain there permanently.\" Id. \r\n  at 339, 157 S.E.2d at 636. (citation omitted). \r\n  \r\nTamara contends she should be entitled \r\n  to stack because a clause of inclusion in an insurance policy should be broadly \r\n  construed. \r\n  \r\nIt is true that clauses of inclusion \r\n  in a policy of insurance are to be broadly construed in favor of coverage, and \r\n  that where there are doubts about the existence or extent of coverage the language \r\n  of the policy is to be \"understood in its most inclusive sense.\" We should not, \r\n  however, torture the meaning of policy language in order to extend or defeat \r\n  coverage that was never intended by the parties. \r\n  \r\nAuto Owners Ins. Co. v. Langford, \r\n  330 S.C. 578, 584, 500 S.E.2d 496, 499 (Ct. App. 1998) (citations omitted). \r\n  In Langford, policy provided for coverage, under certain conditions, \r\n  for relatives \"living with\" the insured. Although the granddaughter was staying \r\n  with her grandmother at the time of the accident, we held the trial court's \r\n  finding that Langford was a transient visitor was supported by the record. \r\n  \r\nIn this case, the father's policy \r\n  reads: \r\n  \r\nWe will pay damages for bodily injury \r\n  or property damage a covered person is legally entitled to collect from the \r\n  owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle. . . . Covered person means: \r\n  1. you and any family member . . . . \r\n  \r\n\"Family member\" is previously defined \r\n  in the policy as \"a person related to you by blood, marriage or adoption who \r\n  is a resident of your household.\" \r\n  \r\nThe trial court found Tamara \"did \r\n  not have enough contact with the Myrtle Beach residence to qualify as a member \r\n  of that household.\" While acknowledging Tamara's connections to her parents' \r\n  household and her parents' financial support, the trial court essentially determined \r\n  Tamara was a transitory visitor. We agree. \r\n  \r\nThe record fully supports the trial \r\n  court's finding that Tamara was not a resident of her father's household. She \r\n  kept an exercise machine, some furniture, and seasonal clothes in Myrtle Beach. \r\n  Tamara acknowledges she lived in various apartments in the Charleston area from \r\n  1987 until the time of the accident in 1993. Tamara visited Myrtle Beach \"usually \r\n  once a month\" for three to four days at a time. According to her discovery responses, \r\n  from August 1989 until the accident in May of 1993, she only spent a portion \r\n  of the summers with her parents twice, and the remaining time was spent in Charleston. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n Further, she filed her own tax returns \r\n  and claimed herself as a dependent. She did not have her tax refund sent to \r\n  Myrtle Beach. In deposition she stated \"I want [the tax refund] to come right \r\n  back to where I'm living [Charleston], not to have to go to Myrtle Beach to \r\n  pick it up.\" Her drivers' licence listed her Charleston address. Tamara was \r\n  registered to vote in Charleston. She worked regularly claiming an income of \r\n$10,322.00 in 1991 and $10,326 in 1992.\r\nFinding evidence to reasonably support \r\nthe trial court's order, the order is AFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n  \r\n1.  The father \r\n  was the named insured on a 1988 Mercedes 420 SL with the mother \"listed on the \r\n  vehicle.\" Burrows Transfer(2) \r\n2.  Tamara's father, \r\n  retired military, (R.331) had owned a business in Beaufort \r\n  called Burrows Transfer Inc.. (R.82) He bought Aamco Transmission \r\n  in Myrtle Beach and worked there. (R.82, 298) \" \" \" \" \r\n3.  Because the \r\n  supreme court has determined that a corporation cannot have a spouse or family \r\n  members, Tamara cannot be a Class I insured under the policy issued to Burrows \r\n  Transport for the 1985 GMC pickup.

Grant and Celle filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal \r\n  jurisdiction. The trial court judge upheld jurisdiction as to Grant, but denied \r\n  jurisdiction as to Celle. Mariculture appeals the trial court's dismissal of \r\n  its claims against Celle. We affirm. \r\nI. \r\nMariculture was a shareholder in \r\n  a British corporation called SeaPerfect PLC (SeaPerfect). SeaPerfect was comprised \r\n  of two subsidiaries: Atlantic LittleNeck Clam Farms, Inc. (ALC), a South Carolina \r\n  corporation that owned property and did business in South Carolina, and Cultivos \r\n  Marinos Internacionales S.A. (CMI), a Chilean company. During most of the time \r\n  of the commission of the alleged causes of action, both Grant and Celle were \r\n  on the Board of Directors of SeaPerfect. Grant was also SeaPerfect's operations \r\n  director. According to the allegations in the complaint, Celle was a resident \r\n  of Chile and Grant was a resident of South Carolina. \r\n  \r\nAfter the purchase of ALC and CMI, \r\n  SeaPerfect needed working capital. The complaint alleges that, at some point, \r\n  Celle and Grant devised a plan to purchase the assets of SeaPerfect at a significantly \r\n  and unlawfully depressed price. Pursuant to their plan, Celle falsely told the \r\n  Board of Directors of SeaPerfect that he could obtain favorable financing in \r\n  Chile. As a result of this representation, the Board of Directors put Celle \r\n  in charge of finding finances. The Board of Directors relied on Celle to obtain \r\n  the financing. \r\n  \r\nMariculture alleges in its complaint \r\n  that, pursuant to the plan, Celle continued to falsely represent to the Board \r\n  his attempts to find financing until SeaPerfect was financially vulnerable. \r\n  Once SeaPerfect's available working capital was nearly consumed, Celle told \r\n  the Board that his attempts at financing had been unsuccessful. He then offered \r\n  to personally buy the assets of SeaPerfect for 3.6 million pounds. These assets \r\n  previously had been valued at thirty million pounds, with liabilities of five \r\n  million pounds. Faced with no other choice but liquidation, the shareholders \r\n  of SeaPerfect accepted Celle's offer. \r\n  \r\nII. \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Mariculture argues that \r\n  personal jurisdiction over Celle is proper. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nThe party invoking personal jurisdiction \r\n  over a nonresident bears the burden of proving the existence of personal jurisdiction. \r\n  See Southern Plastics Co. v. Southern Commerce Bank, 310 S.C. \r\n  256, 259, 423 S.E.2d 128, 130 (1992). At the pretrial stage, this burden is \r\n  met by a prima facie showing of jurisdiction either in the complaint \r\n  or in affidavits. See Mid-State Distrib., Inc. v. Century Importers, \r\n  Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 332, 426 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1993); Springmasters, Inc. \r\n  v. D &amp; M Mfg., 303 S.C. 528, 531, 402 S.E.2d 192, 193 (Ct. App. 1991). \r\n  If the complaint supplies sufficient evidence of jurisdiction, this Court need \r\n  not look at any affidavits. See Mid-State Distrib., 310 S.C. at \r\n  332, 426 S.E.2d at 779; Springmasters, 303 S.C. at 531-32, 402 S.E.2d \r\n  at 193-94. \"It is only when the complaint does not demonstrate jurisdiction \r\n  that the plaintiff must supply other evidence of jurisdiction.\" Springmasters, \r\n  303 S.C. 528, 531, 402 S.E.2d at 193. \r\n  \r\nThe determination of whether a court \r\n  may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident involves a two-step analysis. \r\n  First, the trial judge must determine that the South Carolina long-arm statute \r\n  applies. Second, the trial judge must determine that the nonresident's contacts \r\n  with South Carolina are sufficient to satisfy due process requirements. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSouthern Plastics Co., 310 \r\n  S.C. at 259, 423 S.E.2d at 130.  \r\n  \r\nUnder South Carolina's long-arm statute, \r\n  \"[a] court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who acts directly \r\n  or by an agent as to a cause of action arising from the person's . . . commission \r\n  of a tortious act in whole or in part in this State.\"(1) \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803(1)(c) (1976). \"[T]he commission of a 'tortious act \r\n  in whole or in part in this State' applies to in-state injuries resulting from \r\n  out-of-state acts or omissions.\" Parker v. Williams &amp; Madjanik, Inc., \r\n  270 S.C. 570, 574, 243 S.E.2d 451, 454 (1978).  \r\n  \r\nThe only connections between South \r\n  Carolina and the torts alleged in the complaint are that ALC was a South Carolina \r\n  subsidiary of Sea Perfect and that Grant was simultaneously a co-conspirator \r\n  and a resident of South Carolina. Neither connection permits service of process \r\n  on Celle under the facts of this case. \r\n  \r\nFirst, even if tortious injury to \r\n  ALC could support service of process on Celle, which we decline to decide, Mariculture \r\n  failed to show, through the pleadings or other evidence, that ALC was injured. \r\n  Mariculture, as a representative shareholder of Sea Perfect, brought this action \r\n  claiming injury to Sea Perfect. Sea Perfect is a \"publicly held British \r\n  corporation with shares listed on the London Stock Exchange.\" Sea Perfect's \r\n  only connection to South Carolina was its subsidiary, ALC, a South Carolina \r\n  corporation that did business in South Carolina. The complaint merely states \r\n  that ALC was a subsidiary of Sea Perfect and that Celle intentionally devalued \r\n  the assets of Sea Perfect. Mariculture never averred any other specific facts \r\n  connecting Celle's torts to an injury to ALC in South Carolina. Without these \r\n  averments, inferring tortious injury in South Carolina through injury to ALC \r\n  would require this Court to engage in impermissible speculation. See \r\n  Yarborough &amp; Co. v. Schoolfield Furniture Ind., 275 S.C. 151, 153, \r\n  268 S.E.2d 42, 43 (1980) (\"When jurisdiction is challenged, the plaintiff has \r\n  the burden of presenting facts sufficient to support jurisdiction.\") \r\n  (emphasis added). Moreover, although Mariculture attached to the complaint a \r\n  letter from Sea Perfect's board of directors to its shareholders, this letter \r\n  simply details the financial situation of Sea Perfect when Celle bought its \r\n  assets. The letter does not mention any connection between any injury to ALC \r\n  in South Carolina and Celle's alleged torts. Consequently, because neither the \r\n  complaint nor any other evidence in the record on appeal indicates injury to \r\n  ALC from Celle's alleged torts, Mariculture has failed to bring its complaint \r\n  within the scope of the long-arm statute.  \r\n  \r\nSecond, Grant's contacts with South \r\n  Carolina also do not support personal jurisdiction over Celle. As support for \r\n  its claim to the contrary, Mariculture refers us to Hammond v. Butler, Means, \r\n  Evins &amp; Brown, 300 S.C. 458, 388 S.E.2d 796 (1990). In Hammond, \r\n  the Supreme Court held that, \"[i]n certain instances, an out-of-state defendant \r\n  may be subject to jurisdiction under a long-arm statute on the theory that his \r\n  co-conspirator conducted activities in a particular state pursuant to the conspiracy.\" \r\n  Id. at 463, 388 S.E.2d at 798. However, the Court also noted that this \r\n  holding was consistent with Allen v. Columbia Fin. Management, 297 S.C. \r\n  481, 377 S.E.2d 352 (Ct. App. 1988). See Hammond, 300 S.C. at \r\n  464, 388 S.E.2d at 799. In Allen, this Court explained, \"It is not enough \r\n  that other members of the alleged conspiracy have numerous contacts with South \r\n  Carolina. Due Process requires us to examine each appellant's own contacts with \r\n  South Carolina. We decline to attribute the contacts of one alleged conspirator \r\n  to another alleged conspirator.\" 297 S.C. at 490, 377 S.E.2d at 357 (citations \r\n  omitted). \r\n  \r\nAs a result, even though Mariculture \r\n  alleged that Grant was a resident of South Carolina during the conspiracy and \r\n  a co-conspirator, his connections with South Carolina do not extend to Celle. \r\n  Furthermore, Mariculture never alleged in its complaint, nor does any other \r\n  evidence in the record show, that any of the actions in furtherance of the conspiracy \r\n  were done in South Carolina.  \r\n  \r\nIn conclusion, the allegations in \r\n  the complaint and the facts in the record are insufficient to bring Mariculture's \r\n  claims within the scope of the long-arm statute. Because we conclude that the \r\n  long-arm statute was improperly invoked, we do not reach Mariculture's other \r\n  arguments. Thus, the circuit court's order concluding that South Carolina lacked \r\n  personal jurisdiction over Celle is \r\n  \r\n  AFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., \r\n  concur.  \r\n1.  Mariculture \r\n  makes no argument under any other part of the long-arm statute. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3017","title":"Stevens v.

Colleen \r\n  Stevens and Gerald Stevens as Personal Representatives of the Estate of Kevin \r\n  Marc Stevens (the Personal Representatives) brought the claim against Edgar \r\n  Daniel Allen, the alleged driver, and Betty D. Allen, the car's owner, after \r\n  Stevens was killed in the accident. The jury found Stevens and Allen both 50% \r\n  responsible for Stevens' death and awarded zero damages. The Personal Representatives \r\n  claimed this award was inconsistent and inadequate, and requested the trial \r\n  judge (1) instruct the jury to continue deliberations and return with an award \r\n  of damages; (2) grant a new trial absolute; or (3) grant a new trial nisi \r\n  additur. The trial judge refused. The Personal Representatives made post-trial \r\n  motions for a new trial as to damages, a new trial nisi additur, \r\n  and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The trial judge denied all motions. \r\n  The Personal Representatives appeal. We reverse and remand for a new trial.(1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nStevens and Allen were involved in \r\n  a single car accident in the early morning of August 14, 1993. The teenagers \r\n  had been out partying. A party attendee testified Allen had been drinking and \r\n  smoking marijuana. Stevens and Allen left the party in Betty Allen's car. The \r\n  car struck a bridge sign and the bridge before falling down the embankment into \r\n  a creek. Stevens was killed, and Allen survived with injuries. According to \r\n  one of the county pathologists, Stevens died from drowning. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Personal Representatives filed \r\n  an amended complaint on March 13, 1995, seeking damages for wrongful death and \r\n  pain and suffering due to Allen's negligence. Liability was contested at trial. \r\n  Allen denied (1) he was driving the car at the time of the accident and (2) \r\n  the Personal Representatives suffered damages to the extent claimed. He averred \r\n  Stevens' conduct was contributorily negligent. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, the Personal Representatives \r\n  attempted to offer medical records pursuant to Rule 803(6), SCRE, the Business \r\n  Records Exception. The records consisted of the urinalysis performed on a sample \r\n  from Allen collected after the crash. The judge refused to admit the evidence, \r\n  finding a proper chain of custody could not be established and therefore it \r\n  lacked sufficient trustworthiness.\r\n As evidence of actual damages, the \r\n  Personal Representatives offered funeral bills. They testified about the pain \r\n  and suffering caused by the loss of their son. Allen introduced evidence that \r\n  Stevens had been living with him for a period of time and there was a rift between \r\n  Stevens and his family.  \r\n   \r\nThe jury concluded each party 50% \r\n  liable on both the survival action and the wrongful death action. However, the \r\n  jury found the Personal Representatives were entitled to \"Zero Dollars\" in damages \r\n  on both actions. The Personal Representatives asked the court to instruct the \r\n  jurors to return to deliberations and render a verdict with damages or to find \r\n  for the defendant. The trial judge accepted the verdict as presented. The Personal \r\n  Representatives made post-trial motions for a new trial nisi additur \r\n  or for a new trial absolute. After a discussion about the amount of the additur \r\n  requested, the trial judge denied the motion. The Personal Representatives filed \r\n  a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to damages, a motion for \r\n  additur, and a motion for a new trial as to damages. The trial judge \r\n  denied all three motions.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n  ON APPEAL  \r\n\r\nI. Did the trial judge err in accepting \r\n  a verdict finding the defendant 50% liable for negligence, but awarding the \r\n  plaintiff \"Zero Dollars\" in damages? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Did the trial judge err in not \r\n  allowing the medical records into evidence under the Business Records Exception \r\n  of Rule 803(6), SCRE? \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n   \r\nI. New Trial Absolute \r\n  \r\n   \r\n The grant or denial of new trial \r\n  motions rests within the discretion of the trial judge and his decision will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings are wholly unsupported by the \r\n  evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by error of law. Vinson \r\n  v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 477 S.E.2d 715 (Ct. App. 1996).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA trial court may grant a new trial \r\n  absolute on the ground that the verdict is excessive or inadequate. The jury's \r\n  determination of damages, however, is entitled to substantial deference. The \r\n  trial judge must grant a new trial absolute if the amount of the verdict is \r\n  grossly inadequate or excessive so as to shock the conscience of the court and \r\n  clearly indicates the figure reached was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, \r\n  partiality, corruption or some other improper motives. The failure of the trial \r\n  judge to grant a new trial absolute in this situation amounts to an abuse of \r\n  discretion and on appeal this Court will grant a new trial absolute. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nVinson, 324 S.C. at 404-05, \r\n  477 S.E.2d at 723 (citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. New Trial \r\n  Nisi Additur \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe trial judge alone has the power \r\n  to grant a new trial nisi when he finds the amount of the verdict to \r\n  be merely inadequate or excessive. McCourt by and Through McCourt v. Abernathy, \r\n  318 S.C. 301, 457 S.E.2d 603 (1995). Compelling reasons, however, must be given \r\n  to justify invading the jury's province in this manner. Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. \r\n  v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 427 S.E.2d 673 (1993). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhile the trial judge may not impose \r\n  his will on a party by substituting his judgment for that of the jury, he may \r\n  give the party an option in the way of additur or remittitur, \r\n  or, in the alternative, a new trial. The consideration of a motion for a new \r\n  trial nisi additur requires the trial judge to consider the adequacy \r\n  of the verdict in light of the evidence presented. The trial judge who heard \r\n  the evidence and is more familiar with the evidentiary atmosphere at trial possesses \r\n  a better-informed view of the damages than this Court. Accordingly, great deference \r\n  is given to the trial judge.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe denial of a motion for a new \r\n  trial nisi is within the trial judge's discretion and will not be reversed \r\n  on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. This Court has the duty to review the \r\n  record and determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion amounting \r\n  to an error of law.  \r\n   \r\nVinson, 324 S.C. at 405-06, \r\n  477 S.E.2d at 723-24.\r\n III. Admission \r\n  of Evidence \r\n   \r\n The admission of evidence is a matter \r\n  left to the discretion of the trial judge and, absent clear abuse, will not \r\n  be disturbed on appeal. Carlyle v. Tuomey Hosp., 305 S.C. 187, 407 S.E.2d \r\n  630 (1991); Hofer v. St. Clair, 298 S.C. 503, 381 S.E.2d 736 (1989). \r\n  For this Court to reverse a case based on the admission of evidence, both error \r\n  and prejudice must be shown. Timmons v. South Carolina Tricentennial Comm'n, \r\n  254 S.C. 378, 175 S.E.2d 805 (1970), app. dismissed, cert. \r\n  denied, 400 U.S. 986, 91 S.Ct. 460, 27 L.Ed.2d 435 (1971), reh. \r\n  denied, 401 U.S. 949, 91 S.Ct. 922, 28 L.Ed.2d 233 (1971).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Zero Damages \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Facially Inconsistent \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Personal Representatives argue \r\n  the trial court erred in failing to require the jury to return to deliberations \r\n  to consider the issue of damages, and in refusing to grant one of their post-trial \r\n  motions for (1) a new trial nisi additur, (2) a new trial as to \r\n  damages, or (3) a new trial absolute, based on the inconsistency of the verdict. \r\n  The Personal Representatives contend they are entitled to a new trial as to \r\n  damages or a new trial absolute as a result of the abuse of discretion by the \r\n  trial judge in accepting a facially inconsistent verdict. We find the Personal \r\n  Representatives are entitled to a new trial absolute. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Personal Representatives brought \r\n  this action alleging negligence on the part of Allen resulting in Stevens' death. \r\n  To prevail in an action founded in negligence, the plaintiff must establish \r\n  three essential elements: (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; \r\n  (2) a breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage \r\n  proximately caused by a breach of duty. Reiland v. Southland Equip. Serv., \r\n  Inc., 330 S.C. 617, 500 S.E.2d 145 (Ct. App. 1998)(Emphasis added.); Rickborn \r\n  v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 291, 468 S.E.2d 292 (1996).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe judge charged the jury on both \r\n  negligence and comparative negligence. The jury's verdict was on a seven question \r\n  special verdict form. The relevant questions and jury's answers are: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n  QDo you find that the defendant, \r\n    Edgar Daniel Allen, was negligent and that such negligence proximately caused \r\n    Kevin Marc Stevens' injuries?\r\n   \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n  Yes.\r\n   \r\n   \r\n\r\nQ3. Do you find that Kevin Marc Stevens \r\n  was negligent and \r\nthat such negligence proximately \r\n  caused his injuries? \r\n   \r\n\r\n  Yes.\r\n   \r\n   \r\n\r\nQ4. If your answers to both question \r\n  number 1 and question number 3 are yes then answer this question.\r\nTaking the combined negligence that \r\n  proximately caused Kevin Marc Stevens' injuries as one hundred percent (100%), \r\n  what percentage of that negligence is attributable to Kevin Marc Stevens and \r\n  what percentage is attributable to Edgar Daniel Allen? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Kevin Marc Stevens 50%\r\nEdgar Daniel Allen 50% \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ5. Please state the total amount \r\n  of damages (conscious pain and suffering), if any sustained by Kevin Marc Stevens. \r\n   \r\n   \r\n\r\n  Zero Dollars ($0)\r\n   \r\n   \r\n\r\nQ6. Please state the total amount \r\n  of damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiffs. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Zero Dollars ($0) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe jury found the negligence of \r\n  the defendant proximately caused Steven's injuries, but failed to award any \r\n  damages. This is facially inconsistent. Once a plaintiff proves damages proximately \r\n  caused by the defendant, the verdict of zero damages is inconsistent or incomplete \r\n  as a matter of law. In Johnson v. Phillips, 315 S.C. 407, 433 S.E.2d \r\n  895 (Ct. App. 1993), rev'd in part on other \r\n  grounds, 318 S.C. 453, 458 S.E.2d 427 (1995), this Court held: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, the jury returned a \r\n  verdict in nuisance of \"no dollars\" actual damages for the plaintiff. As a matter \r\n  of law, this was either an inconsistent or incomplete verdict. If the jury found \r\n  the defendant did not unlawfully interfere with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment \r\n  of his land, even though the diversion of surface water was annoying or harmful \r\n  to him, the verdict was legally inconsistent. On that view of the evidence, \r\n  the verdict should have been for the defendant. If the jury found an unlawful \r\n  interference amounting to a private nuisance, but no actual damages resulting \r\n  to the plaintiff, it should have returned a verdict for the plaintiff and awarded \r\n  nominal damages (i.e., one dollar). If it found unlawful interference resulting \r\n  in actual damage to the plaintiff, even if the amount of the damages was difficult \r\n  to ascertain, the jury had a duty to return a verdict for the plaintiff and \r\n  to award damages in a specific dollar amount that, in its best judgment, based \r\n  on the evidence before it, would compensate the plaintiff for his actual loss. \r\n  Having found the fact of damage, the jury was required to find the amount of \r\n  damage. In either of these latter cases, a verdict of \"no dollars\" for the plaintiff \r\n  is legally incomplete. Since the defendant is liable for violating the plaintiff's \r\n  substantive right, the plaintiff is entitled by law to an award of damages. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nJohnson, 315 S.C. at 415-16, \r\n  433 S.E.2d at 900-01. \r\n   \r\nIn the case sub judice, \r\n  assuming the jury was correct in finding Allen proximately caused the injuries \r\n  of Stevens, the jury should have calculated some amount of damages, either actual \r\n  or nominal. If there was little or no damage, but there was fault on Allen's \r\n  part then nominal damages (i.e., one dollar) would be appropriate. If the jury \r\n  determined the negligence resulted in some amount of actual damage, such as \r\n  the cost of the funeral bill, then it should have established a specific amount \r\n  that would best compensate the plaintiff. Id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA jury finding of injuries suffered \r\n  by a plaintiff that were proximately caused by the defendant negates a verdict \r\n  for the defendant. The interrogatory in this instance encapsulated a finding \r\n  of negligence and proximate cause on the part of Allen which caused Stevens' \r\n  injuries. Interrogatory number 1 posited to the jury: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDo you find that the defendant, Edgar \r\n  Daniel Allen, was negligent and that such negligence proximately caused \r\n  Kevin Marc Stevens' injuries? (Emphasis added.) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe jury responded: \"Yes.\" The plaintiff \r\n  in this case is entitled to damages as a matter of law since the jury found \r\n  the defendant liable.  \r\n   \r\n\"The court cannot lawfully enter \r\n  judgment on an inconsistent or incomplete verdict. When the jury returns a verdict \r\n  of 'no damages' for the plaintiff, the judge should inform the jury that he \r\n  cannot legally accept the verdict.\" Krepps by Krepps v. Ausen, 324 S.C. \r\n  597, 479 S.E.2d 290 (Ct. App. 1996)(citation omitted). South Carolina law requires \r\n  a jury determine all issues of fact including the proper amount of damages. \r\n  See Johnson, supra; Collier v. Green, 244 S.C. 367, \r\n  137 S.E.2d 277 (1964); Gwathmey v. Foor Hotel Co., 121 S.C. 237, 113 \r\n  S.E. 688 (1922); Krepps, supra. The court is faced with what procedure \r\n  to use to cure a facially inconsistent and ambiguous verdict. The court cannot \r\n  construe the verdict of the jury, nor can it \"correct\" the verdict. See \r\n  Johnson, supra. As stated in footnote 7 to Johnson:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder our law, where the case is \r\n  tried to a jury, the judge cannot perform the jury's function for it. If the \r\n  jury renders an ambiguous verdict, the court must resubmit the case to the jury, \r\n  not act as a substitute for the jury. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nJohnson, 315 S.C. at 417, \r\n  n.7, 433 S.E.2d 902, n.7. \r\n   \r\nB. Procedure for the \r\n  Judge \r\n   \r\nIf a verdict of \"no damages\" or \"zero \r\n  dollars\" is rendered, after finding the defendant liable, the judge should inform \r\n  the jury that he cannot accept their verdict and he has a duty to send them \r\n  back for further deliberations. He should instruct the jury with explanations \r\n  of nominal and compensatory, or actual, damages. The jury should be charged \r\n  to assess a definite dollar amount in damages, either nominal or actual, for \r\n  the plaintiff or find in favor of the defendant. Krepps, supra. \r\n  The judge cannot cure this inconsistent and ambiguous verdict sua sponte. \r\n  \"Further, we hold there is no duty imposed on the trial judge to question a \r\n  jury's verdict of liability, but no damages, unless requested to by a party.\" \r\n  Smith v. Phillips, 318 S.C. 453, 455, 458 S.E.2d 427, 429 (1995). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court has the remedy of granting \r\n  a new trial if the jury renders an inadequate or excessive verdict. A new trial \r\n  is also warranted if the verdict is inconsistent. See Rush v. Blanchard, \r\n  310 S.C. 375, 426 S.E.2d 802 (1993); Krepps, supra. The trial \r\n  judge is required to grant a motion for a new trial if the amount of the verdict \r\n  is so grossly inadequate or excessive that it shocks the conscience of the court \r\n  and clearly indicates the amount was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, \r\n  partiality, corruption or some other improper motives. See Cock-N-Bull \r\n  Steak House, Inc. v. Generali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 466 S.E.2d 727 (1996); \r\n  Krepps, supra. If a verdict of this type is reached, and the trial \r\n  judge denies the motion for a new trial, it is an abuse of discretion and this \r\n  Court will grant a new trial absolute. Weir v. Citicorp Nat'l Servs., Inc., \r\n  312 S.C. 511, 435 S.E.2d 864 (1993); Krepps, supra. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA new trial nisi is one in \r\n  which a new trial will be granted unless the party opposing it complies with \r\n  conditions set by the court. Elliott v. Black River Elec. Coop., 233 \r\n  S.C. 233, 104 S.E.2d 357 (1958). The trial judge has the sole power to grant \r\n  a new trial nisi when he finds the verdict is merely inadequate or excessive. \r\n  \"[T]he trial judge must distinguish between awards that are merely unduly liberal \r\n  or conservative and awards that are actuated by passion, caprice or prejudice.\" \r\n  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Durham, 314 S.C. 529, 530, 431 S.E.2d 557, 558 (1993). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA verdict of \"no damages\" or \"zero \r\n  dollars\" after a finding of liability against the defendant is grossly inadequate \r\n  and facially inconsistent. If the verdict is not changed by the jury, the trial \r\n  judge has a duty to grant a party's motion for a new trial. See Krepps \r\n  by Krepps v. Ausen, 324 S.C. 597, 479 S.E.2d 290 (Ct. App. 1996). The Personal \r\n  Representatives moved for a new trial absolute and a new trial nisi additur \r\n  after the judge refused to return the jury to further deliberations on damages. \r\n  The motion for a new trial nisi additur is inappropriate because \r\n  the verdict was more than merely inadequate. A new trial absolute should have \r\n  been granted and its denial was an abuse of the judge's discretion.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA verdict for the plaintiff for zero \r\n  dollars cannot stand. As stated in Johnson, supra, the court cannot \r\n  lawfully accept an inconsistent or incomplete verdict. Therefore, under Johnson, \r\n  the trial court was required to either resubmit the case to the jury or grant \r\n  a new trial absolute. \r\n Krepps, 324 S.C. at 610, \r\n  479 S.E.2d at 297. \r\n   \r\nThe Personal Representatives made \r\n  a post-trial motion for a new trial as to damages only. South Carolina Code \r\n  Ann. Â§15-33-125 (Supp. 1998) states: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA new trial may be granted to the \r\n  plaintiff on the issue of damages only and not liability when the only reasonable \r\n  inference to be drawn from all the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the defendant, is that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict in his favor \r\n  on the issue of liability as a matter of law. Unless the plaintiff is entitled \r\n  to a directed verdict on the issue of liability, any new trial must include \r\n  both issues of liability and damages. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSince liability was contested in \r\n  this case, a new trial as to damages only would be inappropriate. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nC. Effect of High/Low \r\n  Agreement \r\n   \r\nThis case had a \"high/low\" agreement, \r\n  in which there was a minimum recovery of $10,000.00 for the plaintiff regardless \r\n  of the outcome of the case. It also established a high of $25,000.00 on the \r\n  liability insurance, but left open recovery under the underinsured protection. \r\n  The trial judge found that due to this agreement, even if he were to send the \r\n  case back to the jury, they would have to find damages in excess of $20,000.00 \r\n  before it would be above the minimum guaranteed, due to the finding of 50/50 \r\n  liability.  \r\n   \r\nThis agreement should have played \r\n  no part in the trial judge's determination of whether to send the jury back \r\n  for further deliberations, or to grant the motion for a new trial. The judge \r\n  was usurping the province of the jury by deciding that damages would not be \r\n  above that amount, instead of allowing the jury to perform its duty to find \r\n  the amount of damages or render a verdict for the defendant. See Johnson, \r\n  supra. Whether the agreement existed or not, it was the duty of the trial \r\n  judge to send the case back to the jury, or to grant a new trial absolute. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nD. Preservation \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAllen argues the motion for a new \r\n  trial was not preserved because the trial judge never ruled upon it. We disagree. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe Personal Representatives moved \r\n  for a new trial absolute and a new trial nisi additur immediately \r\n  after the verdict was read and accepted. The court then became involved in a \r\n  discussion as to whether it could grant the new trial nisi additur, \r\n  and how much the plaintiff was requesting. The trial judge asked for a suggested \r\n  figure for the additur. Plaintiffs' attorney responded with $100,000.00. \r\n  The judge said \"I would deny that. All right anything else?\" At which time plaintiffs' \r\n  attorney asked for ten days to file written motions, which was granted. The \r\n  trial judge, in his order regarding the written motions, commented: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDefendants took the position that \r\n  the verdicts were not inconsistent and that no further instruction was warranted. \r\n  The Court agreed with the Defendant and discharged the jury without further \r\n  instruction. The Plaintiffs then moved for JNOV, a new trial or a new trial \r\n  nisi. The Court denied these motions but granted Plaintiffs' request \r\n  for permission to file post-trial motions in writing within 10 days from the \r\n  conclusion of trial. \r\n   \r\nWe find the motion for a new trial \r\n  absolute is certainly preserved for review by this Court, as the trial judge \r\n  stated he denied the motion.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn view of our conclusion that the \r\n  Personal Representatives are entitled to a new trial absolute, we need not address \r\n  any issues under the umbrella of the motion for judgment notwithstanding the \r\n  verdict. \r\n   \r\nII. Chain \r\n  of Custody \r\n   \r\nBecause we reverse and remand for \r\n  a new trial, we discuss the chain of custody issue as it may arise again. At \r\n  trial, the Personal Representatives attempted to admit medical reports under \r\n  the Business Records Exception to hearsay under Rule 803(6), SCRE, in an effort \r\n  to show Allen had marijuana and cocaine in his system at the time of the accident. \r\n  The reports showed the results of the urinalysis performed on Allen after the \r\n  accident. Allen objected on the grounds that a chain of custody could not be \r\n  properly established. The Personal Representatives maintain that a chain of \r\n  custody is not required under the rule. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Even under Rule 803(6), SCRE, a \r\n  proper foundation must be laid for admittance of the evidence, and this includes \r\n  a chain of custody. In Benton v. Pellum, 232 S.C. 26, 100 S.E.2d 534, \r\n  537 (1957), the Supreme Court explained:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe problem of showing that the specimen \r\n  analyzed actually was taken from the subject person is frequently a difficult \r\n  one, for ordinarily the specimen is passed through several hands before being \r\n  analyzed and it is not possible to establish identity by a single witness. . \r\n  . . While proof need not negate all possibility of tampering, it is generally \r\n  held that the party offering such specimen is required to establish, at least \r\n  as far as practicable, a complete chain of evidence, tracing possession from \r\n  the time the specimen is taken from the human body to the final custodian by \r\n  whom it is analyzed. Where the substance analyzed has passed through several \r\n  hands the evidence must not leave it to conjecture as to who had it and what \r\n  was done with it between the taking and the analysis.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBenton, 232 S.C. at 33-34, \r\n  100 S.E.2d at 537 (citations omitted.).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, the sample was taken at Piedmont \r\n  Medical Center and sent to a laboratory in New Jersey. The Personal Representatives \r\n  failed to provide the testimony of any of the technicians that handled the sample \r\n  once it reached the lab in New Jersey. Dr. Orthman could not provide the names \r\n  of the individuals that handled the sample. According to Dr. Orthman, the specimen \r\n  was shipped in a bottle with a screw top, but it was probably not sealed. Dr. \r\n  Orthman said \"a few people\" would have handled the specimen once it was at the \r\n  lab. In Raino v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., 309 S.C. 255, 422 S.E.2d \r\n  98 (1992), the Supreme Court noted: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAppellants contend that this case \r\n  is distinguishable [from Benton] because here the sample was tested within twenty \r\n  minutes in a lab two hundred feet from the trauma room and \"all of the persons \r\n  who handled the blood in the trauma protocol are medically qualified....\" Regardless \r\n  of the distance to the lab, appellants do not know who handled the blood. There \r\n  are not mere gaps in the chain. Appellants failed to establish the proper chain \r\n  of custody. \r\n   \r\nRaino, 309 S.C. at 258, 422 \r\n  S.E.2d at 100. \r\n   \r\nThe Personal Representatives have \r\n  failed to provide a sufficient chain of custody for admittance of the medical \r\n  report. The admissibility of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the \r\n  judge, and the refusal to admit the urinalysis report in this case was not an \r\n  abuse of discretion. See State v. Cribb, 310 S.C. 518, 426 S.E.2d \r\n  306 (1992); Raino, supra; State v. Williams, 297 S.C. 290, \r\n  376 S.E.2d 773 (1989); Benton v. Pellum; 232 S.C. 26, 100 S.E.2d 534 \r\n  (1957). \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold the Personal Representatives \r\n  are entitled to a new trial absolute. A verdict finding a defendant liable for \r\n  proximately causing a plaintiff's injuries, but awarding \"Zero Dollars\" in damages \r\n  is facially inconsistent. We conclude the Personal Representatives have failed \r\n  to establish a proper chain of custody in regard to the urinalysis results encapsulated \r\n  in the laboratory report. \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCURETON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n1. Because \r\n  oral argument would not aid the Court in resolving the issues on appeal, we \r\n  decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3018","title":"Douglass v.

Louthian, Esquire, appeals the circuit court's granting of Motions \r\n  to Dismiss in favor of Robert Brown, Donna Seegars Givens, Sandra Dooley Parker, \r\n  and Jonas and Wiggins, Attorneys at Law. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nThe facts, as asserted by appellant, \r\n  are as follows. William David Douglass was born to Melodye Shampine on July \r\n  20, 1990. At the time of William's birth, Melodye was lawfully married to Robert \r\n  Douglass. William's birth certificate lists Robert Douglass as his father. Melodye \r\n  and William now claim that Christopher Boyce is, in fact, William's father. \r\n  Christopher was, at the time, a minor and a special needs student in a class \r\n  in which Melodye was the teacher's aide.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSubsequent to Melodye's pregnancy, \r\n  but prior to William's birth, Robert Douglass initiated an action for divorce \r\n  against Melodye on the ground of adultery. During the divorce action, Robert \r\n  was represented by Sandra Dooley Parker, and Melodye was represented by Lynn \r\n  Wiggins of Jonas and Wiggins. William alleges, although both Parker and Wiggins \r\n  knew that William was not Robert's child, the divorce action did not address \r\n  his paternity. Neither the child nor Christopher was joined as a party to determine \r\n  paternity and no Guardian ad Litem was appointed to represent William.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn April of 1991, Christopher Boyce, \r\n  the alleged father of William, died in a motor vehicle accident. In May of 1991, \r\n  Daniel and Yvonne Boyce, Christopher's parents, filed an Application for Appointment \r\n  as Personal Representatives of the Estate of their son. The Application made \r\n  no mention of William, and he was not included as an heir. Daniel and Yvonne \r\n  were subsequently appointed as Personal Representatives by the Probate Court.\r\nThe Boyces initiated a Wrongful Death \r\n  Action as Personal Representatives for Christopher's Estate. The action failed \r\n  to name William Douglass as a beneficiary. The Boyces were represented in the \r\n  action by Robert Brown and Donna Seegars Givens of the firm Brown and Woods. \r\n  No notice of the proceedings was given to William, and no Guardian ad Litem \r\n  was appointed to represent him. The action was settled, and the proceeds were \r\n  distributed as attorney's fees and to the Boyces.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWilliam claims that the Boyces knew \r\n  he was the biological son of Christopher and they have recognized him as their \r\n  grandchild. He also asserts that attorneys Brown and Givens were informed by \r\n  the Boyces that he was the biological son of Christopher.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn 1995, Melodye, as Next Friend \r\n  of William, brought a claim in the Court of Common Pleas against Daniel and \r\n  Yvonne Boyce. A subsequent claim was brought in Probate Court to reopen the \r\n  Estate of Christopher Boyce. The case in Probate Court was transferred to Circuit \r\n  Court, and the cases were consolidated. Herbert Louthian was substituted as \r\n  Next Friend for William, and Steve Fitzer was appointed as Personal Representative \r\n  of Christopher's Estate.  \r\n   \r\nIn April of 1997, a second amended \r\n  complaint was filed adding Robert Brown, Donna Seegars Givens, Sandra Dooley \r\n  Parker, and Jonas and Wiggins as defendants. This complaint asserted causes \r\n  of action of conspiracy and intentional interference with inheritance rights \r\n  against Brown and Givens. The complaint asserted a cause of action against Parker \r\n  and Jonas and Wiggins for professional negligence. Attorneys Brown and Givens \r\n  and the firm of Jonas and Wiggins filed motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b), \r\n  SCRCP. Parker filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule \r\n  12(c), SCRCP. By order dated August 29, 1997, the motions were granted, and \r\n  the actions against Brown, Givens, Parker, and Jonas and Wiggins were dismissed \r\n  with prejudice.  \r\nISSUES ON \r\n  APPEAL \r\n   \r\nWhether the trial judge erred in \r\n  (1) dismissing the action against Parker and Jonas and Wiggins because Â§ 20-7-952 \r\n  mandated they take action to protect him in the divorce action between Melodye \r\n  and Robert and (2) dismissing the action against Brown and Givens because the \r\n  complaint sufficiently stated causes of action for conspiracy and intentional \r\n  interference of inheritance rights. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA judgment on the pleadings against \r\n  the plaintiff is not proper if there is an issue of fact raised by the complaint \r\n  which, if resolved in favor of the plaintiff, would entitle him to judgment. \r\n  Russell v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 86, 406 S.E.2d 338 (1991). A \r\n  judgment on the pleadings is in the nature of a demurrer, and all properly pleaded \r\n  factual allegations are deemed admitted for purposes of the consideration of \r\n  a demurrer. Id. When a fact is well pleaded, any inferences of law \r\n  or conclusions of fact that may properly arise therefrom are to be regarded \r\n  as embraced in the averment. Id. A complaint is sufficient if it states \r\n  any cause of action or it appears that the plaintiff is entitled to any relief \r\n  whatsoever. Id.\r\n1. Dismissal as to Attorneys Involved \r\n  in Divorce Action  \r\n   \r\nWilliam first argues the trial judge \r\n  erred in finding S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-952 (1985), did not apply to the divorce \r\n  proceedings involving Robert and Melodye. He further argues that Sandra Parker, \r\n  as attorney for Robert, and Jonas and Wiggins, representing Melodye, were negligent \r\n  in not following the procedures set forth in Â§ 20-7-952(E).(1) \r\n  William asserts that the attorneys breached their duty to him created by the \r\n  statute, and this breach caused him to be declared a child of the marriage of \r\n  Robert and Melodye, resulting in William being omitted as a beneficiary in the \r\n  wrongful death action. \r\n   \r\nThe trial judge held Â§ 20-7-952, \r\n  by its clear language, did not apply to the Douglass divorce proceedings and, \r\n  assuming that it did apply, would not support a malpractice cause of action \r\n  because the essential purpose of the statute was not to protect from the kind \r\n  of harm alleged by William.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSection 20-7-952 (1985), provides \r\n  in pertinent part: \r\n   \r\nA. The purpose of this subarticle \r\n  is to establish a procedure to aid in the determination of the paternity of \r\n  an individual. \r\n   \r\n* * * \r\n  \r\n   \r\nE. Whenever an action threatens to \r\n  make a child illegitimate, the presumed legal father and the putative natural \r\n  father must be made parties respondents to the action. A child under the age \r\n  of eighteen years must be represented by a guardian ad litem appointed by the \r\n  court .  \r\n   \r\nWilliam contends this code section \r\n  mandated the appointment of a guardian ad litem and the joining of the putative \r\n  father to the Douglass divorce proceedings. He asserts the attorneys' failure \r\n  to follow the dictates of the statute amounted to a breach of this statutorily \r\n  created duty owed to him. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBy the plain language of the statute, \r\n  it only applies in an action which \"threatens to make a child illegitimate.\" \r\n  William would have the statute apply in a divorce proceeding in which paternity \r\n  was not an issue. The child is presumed to be a legitimate child of the marriage, \r\n  unless a paternity action proves otherwise. See Lewter v. Thompson, \r\n  281 S.C. 397, 315 S.E.2d 821 (Ct. App. 1984) (presumption that child born in \r\n  wedlock is legitimate, although rebuttable, is one of strongest known in law). \r\n  In effect William argues that the issue of paternity should have been addressed \r\n  in the divorce proceedings and that the attorneys breached their duty to him \r\n  by not going against the presumption of legitimacy to make him illegitimate. \r\n  We do not believe the law imposes a burden on attorneys in every divorce matter \r\n  to determine paternity of the children of the parties where the parties themselves \r\n  do not request such action. The statute certainly does not require the attorneys \r\n  to force the issue of the legitimacy of children if that is not the wishes of \r\n  the parties to the divorce. Accordingly, we find the trial judge properly concluded \r\n  Â§ 20-7-952 did not apply and dismissal of the action against Parker and Jonas \r\n  and Wiggins was proper. \r\n   \r\nWe further find an additional basis \r\n  for affirmance of dismissal against these attorneys. The trial judge found as \r\n  an additional ground that, assuming Â§ 20-7-952 did apply, William failed to \r\n  show a duty of care arising from the statute. \"In order to show that the defendant \r\n  owes him a duty of care arising from a statute, the plaintiff must show two \r\n  things: (1) that the essential purpose of the statute is to protect from the \r\n  kind of harm the plaintiff has suffered; and (2) that he is a member of the \r\n  class of persons the statute is intended to protect.\" Rayfield v. South \r\n  Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 297 S.C. 95, 374 S.E.2d 910 (Ct. App. 1988), \r\n  cert. denied, 298 S.C. 204, 379 S.E.2d 133 (1989). Because he found \r\n  William failed to meet the first element in Rayfield, the trial judge \r\n  found the complaint failed to raise a legally cognizable claim for professional \r\n  negligence. William has failed to argue against this finding, and thus, it is \r\n  the law of the case. See Hall v. Clarendon Outdoor Advertising, Inc., \r\n  311 S.C. 185, 428 S.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1993) (failure to argue against trial judge's \r\n  ruling renders it the law of the case); Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. \r\n  329, 491 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1997) (appellate court will affirm ruling by lower \r\n  court if offended party does not challenge that ruling; failure to challenge \r\n  ruling is abandonment of the issue and precludes consideration on appeal; unchallenged \r\n  ruling is law of the case and requires affirmance). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n2. Dismissal as to Attorneys Involved \r\n  in Wrongful Death Action  \r\n   \r\nWilliam also contends the dismissal \r\n  of his claims against Brown and Givens was inappropriate. The complaint asserted \r\n  two causes of action against Brown and Givens: civil conspiracy and intentional \r\n  interference with inheritance rights. William asserts his complaint sufficiently \r\n  stated factual allegations which would entitle him to relief. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe trial judge held the conspiracy \r\n  and intentional interference with inheritance rights claims were fatally deficient \r\n  and should be dismissed. He found Brown and Givens were acting at all times \r\n  in their professional capacities as attorneys for the Boyces and they could \r\n  not be subject to the claims of third parties arising out of the performance \r\n  of professional activities on behalf of their clients.\r\nOrdinarily, an attorney is immune \r\n  from liability to third persons arising out of the performance of his professional \r\n  activities on behalf of and with the knowledge of his client. Gaar v. North \r\n  Myrtle Beach Realty Co., Inc., 287 S.C. 525, 528, 339 S.E.2d 887, 889 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1986). \"Accordingly, an attorney who acts in good faith with the \r\n  authority of his client is not liable to a third party in an action for malicious \r\n  prosecution.\" (emphasis added). Id. at 528-529, 339 S.E.2d at 889. \r\n  In Stiles v. Onorato, 318 S.C. 297, 457 S.E.2d 601 (1995), our Supreme \r\n  Court noted a number of jurisdictions recognize that an attorney may be held \r\n  liable where he acts in bad faith or for his own personal motivations. Stiles, \r\n  318 S.C. at 298, 457 S.E.2d at 602. Citing cases from other jurisdictions \r\n  that recognized an attorney may be held liable for acts of conspiracy with his \r\n  client, as well as for fraud and conversion in conjunction with representation \r\n  of clients, the court held \"[a]n attorney may be held liable for conspiracy \r\n  where, in addition to representing his client, he breaches some independent \r\n  duty to a third person or acts in his own personal interest, outside the scope \r\n  of his representation of the client.\" Id. at 299-300, 318 S.E.2d at \r\n  602. \r\n   \r\nNowhere in the amended complaint \r\n  does William allege that Brown and Givens acted to further their personal interests. \r\n  Additionally, Brown and Givens owed no independent duty to William. Although \r\n  it is true that the wrongful death action was brought on behalf of the statutory \r\n  beneficiaries, William was not a statutory beneficiary because he had never \r\n  been adjudicated the biological child of Christopher. Accepting the facts as \r\n  pled to be true, even if Brown and Givens were aware that William was the biological \r\n  son of the deceased, William was the putative son of Robert Douglass, not Christopher \r\n  Boyce. William's birth certificate lists Robert Douglass as William's father, \r\n  and Robert Douglass was married to William's mother at the time of his birth, \r\n  thus rendering William legitimate. The Douglass divorce decree did not alter \r\n  William's legitimate status. Brown and Givens, as counsel for Christopher Boyce's \r\n  statutory beneficiaries, had no duty to challenge the presumptively valid evidence \r\n  that William was Robert's legitimate son. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWith respect to William's second \r\n  cause of action against Brown and Givens, South Carolina has apparently never \r\n  recognized a claim for interference with inheritance rights. Even if such a \r\n  claim were cognizable, it also fails under Gaar and Stiles \r\n  because there is no allegation that these attorneys were acting for their own \r\n  personal benefit outside the scope of their representation of their clients, \r\n  or that they had any independent duty to William. William cannot claim that \r\n  Brown and Givens interfered with his inheritance rights by not disregarding \r\n  his legitimacy and thus stigmatizing him as the illegitimate child of Christopher \r\n  Boyce. \r\n   \r\nThe trial judge properly resolved \r\n  the Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion to dismiss as to all defendants. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHEARN and STILWELL, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n   \r\n1.  At the motions \r\n  hearing, counsel for William agreed William was relying solely on this statute \r\n  as the basis for the professional negligence claim against Parker and Jonas \r\n  and Wiggins. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3019","title":"State v.

Over the State's objection, the trial court \r\n  imposed a sentence of five years, suspended upon five years probation, and a \r\n  fine of five thousand dollars. The trial court ordered that probation could \r\n  be terminated upon payment of the fine. The State appeals, arguing the trial \r\n  court had no authority to deviate below the minimum sentence of three years \r\n  imprisonment and a twenty-five thousand dollar fine as prescribed by S.C. Code \r\n  Annotated Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2) (Supp. 1998). We reverse and remand. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQUESTIONS \r\n  PRESENTED \r\n \r\nI. Does \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1), which provides, for first offense trafficking \r\n  in cocaine in an amount less than twenty-eight grams, a penalty of \"not less \r\n  than three years nor more than ten years, no part of which may be suspended \r\n  nor probation granted,\" mandate a minimum term of imprisonment of three years?\r\nII. Does S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-410 allow a judge sentencing an offender under Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) \r\n  to suspend the sentence and place the offender on probation, notwithstanding \r\n  the language prohibiting suspension or probation?\r\n  \r\n   III. \r\n  Does S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) prescribe a mandatory fine of twenty-five \r\n  thousand dollars?\r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Section 44-53-370(e)(2) provides \r\n  that any person knowingly in actual possession of ten grams or more of cocaine \r\n  is guilty of a felony known as \"trafficking in cocaine.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370 \r\n  (Supp. 1998). A conviction for trafficking in a quantity of cocaine less than \r\n  28 grams \"must be punished\" as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1. for a first offense, a term of \r\n  imprisonment of not less than three years nor more than ten years, no \r\n  part of which may be suspended nor probation granted, and a fine of twenty-five \r\n  thousand dollars; \r\n  \r\n   \r\n2. for a second offense, a term of \r\n  imprisonment of not less than five years nor more than thirty years, no \r\n  part of which may be suspended nor probation granted, and a fine of fifty thousand \r\n  dollars; \r\n   \r\n3. for a third or subsequent offense, \r\n  a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of not less \r\n  than twenty-five years nor more than thirty years, no part of which may be suspended \r\n  nor probation granted, and a fine of fifty thousand dollars;  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a) \r\n  (Supp. 1998)(emphasis added).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe State argues that part (1), in \r\n  plain language, requires a minimum sentence for Taub of not less than three \r\n  years imprisonment and a fine of twenty-five thousand dollars because it specifies \r\n  a minimum sentence of imprisonment and clearly instructs the trial judge that \r\n  no part of the minimum sentence may be suspended nor probation granted. Taub, \r\n  on the other hand, asserts that only in part (3) does the word \"mandatory\" appear. \r\n  Taub further argues that S.C. Code Â§ 24-21-410 (Supp. 1998), which gives the \r\n  trial court the general authority to suspend any sentence other than one involving \r\n  death or life in prison, provides the statutory basis to allow the suspension \r\n  of both the term of imprisonment and the fine. Section 24-21-410 reads as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter conviction or plea for any \r\n  offense, except a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment, the judge \r\n  of a court of record with criminal jurisdiction at the time of sentence may \r\n  suspend the imposition or the execution of a sentence and place the defendant \r\n  on probation or may impose a fine and also place the defendant on probation. \r\n  Probation is a form of clemency. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-410 (Supp. \r\n  1998). This section was amended in 1996 to include the last sentence. Thus, \r\n  Taub asserts the legislature has most recently provided clear authority for \r\n  the trial court to suspend a sentence and place a defendant on probation except \r\n  where the sentence involves death or life imprisonment, and, to the extent there \r\n  is a conflict with the provisions of Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1), the latest enactment \r\n  should prevail.  \r\n   \r\n I. Does S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1), which provides, for first offense trafficking in cocaine \r\n  in an amount less than twenty-eight grams, a penalty of \"not less than three \r\n  years nor more than ten years, no part of which may be suspended nor probation \r\n  granted,\" mandate a minimum term of imprisonment of three years? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe first question presented is whether \r\n  Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) mandates a sentence of at least three years imprisonment. \r\n  We begin our analysis with the recognition that \"[t]he penalty assessed for \r\n  a particular offense is, except in the rarest of cases, 'purely a matter of \r\n  legislative prerogative,' and the legislature's judgment will not be disturbed.\" \r\n  State v. De La Cruz, 302 S.C. 13, 16, 393 S.E.2d 184, 186 (1990) (quoting \r\n  Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 274 (1980)). \"Judicial discretion in \r\n  sentencing, in suspending sentences, and in designating that sentences run concurrent \r\n  or consecutive is subject to statutory restriction.\" Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction \r\n  is to ascertain and effectuate the legislature's intent. State v. Smith, \r\n  330 S.C. 237, 498 S.E.2d 648 (Ct. App. 1998). In construing a statute, words \r\n  must be given their plain and ordinary meaning, without resort to subtle or \r\n  forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation. Id. If \r\n  a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite \r\n  meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules of statutory interpretation \r\n  and this court has no right to look for or impose another meaning. Id. \r\n  Where a statute is complete and unambiguous, legislative intent must be determined \r\n  from the plain language of the statute. Id. Penal statutes are to be \r\n  construed strictly against the State and in favor of the defendant. State \r\n  v. Burton, 301 S.C. 305, 391 S.E.2d 583 (1990). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe conclude that the mandatory nature \r\n  of Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) is clear under the plain meaning of the words employed, \r\n  notwithstanding the fact that the word \"mandatory\" is only used to describe \r\n  the sentence for a third and subsequent offense. See State v. Wilson, \r\n  315 S.C. 289, 294, 433 S.E.2d 864, 867 (1993) (stating the precise quantity \r\n  of drugs involved in trafficking in cocaine in violation of Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2), \r\n  \"is pertinent, not to the classification of trafficking, but to the minimum \r\n  penalty proscribed (sic)\"); cf. State v. De La Cruz, 302 S.C. \r\n  13, 16, n.4, 393 S.E.2d 184, 186, n.4 (1990) (noting Johnson case \"dealt \r\n  with a mandatory minimum sentence\"); State v. Johnson, 276 S.C. 444, \r\n  446, 279 S.E.2d 606, 607 (1981) (finding statute describing possible prison \r\n  term as \"not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years\" prescribes \r\n  a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn describing the applicable punishment, \r\n  the statute proclaims that \"no part of [the term of imprisonment] may be suspended \r\n  nor probation granted.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) (Supp. 1998). \r\n  It is true the legislature only used the term \"mandatory\" in stating the sentence \r\n  for a third and subsequent offense. However, a review of the overall sentencing \r\n  scheme reveals that this is not inconsistent. See State v. Alls, \r\n  330 S.C. 528, 531, 500 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1998) (\"In construing statutory language, \r\n  the statute must be read as a whole, and sections which are part of the same \r\n  general statutory law must be construed together and each one given effect, \r\n  if it can be done by any reasonable construction.\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSubsection (e) of Â§ 44-53-370 provides \r\n  a statutory scheme of sentencing for trafficking offenses. See State \r\n  v. De La Cruz, 302 S.C. 13, 15, 393 S.E.2d 184 (1990). Sentences become \r\n  progressively greater, based upon the type and quantity of controlled substance \r\n  involved and the number of the offense. In addition to outlining the sentencing \r\n  parameters for specific trafficking offenses, subsection (e) contains the following \r\n  pertinent language:  \r\n   \r\nA person convicted and sentenced \r\n  under this subsection to a mandatory term of imprisonment of twenty-five years, \r\n  a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of twenty-five years, or a mandatory \r\n  minimum term of imprisonment of not less than twenty-five years nor more than \r\n  thirty years is not eligible for parole, extended work release, as provided \r\n  in Section 24-13-610, or supervised furlough, as provided in Section 24-13-710. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e) (Supp. \r\n  1998). \r\n   \r\nIt thus becomes clear the legislature \r\n  assigned an additional meaning within subsection (e) to any sentence described \r\n  as \"mandatory\" or as a \"mandatory minimum.\" In addition to requiring a mandatory \r\n  minimum term of imprisonment, a person sentenced as a third or subsequent offender \r\n  under the \"mandatory\" provisions is not eligible for parole, extended work release, \r\n  or supervised furlough. See State v. Johnson, 276 S.C. 444, 279 \r\n  S.E.2d 606 (1981) (legislature's decision to mandate a minimum sentencing term \r\n  and deny the offender parole eligibility for a portion thereof is an appropriate \r\n  exercise of its power). In contrast, a person sentenced as a first or second \r\n  offender, though subjected to a required minimum term of imprisonment, is not \r\n  precluded under the statute from receiving parole, extended work release, or \r\n  supervised furlough.  \r\n   \r\nII. Does S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  24-21-410 allow a judge sentencing an offender under Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) \r\n  to suspend the sentence and place the offender on probation, notwithstanding \r\n  the language prohibiting suspension or probation? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe second question presented is \r\n  whether the trial court's discretionary power found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-410 \r\n  (Supp. 1998) allows the trial court to suspend the sentence and grant probation \r\n  to Taub, notwithstanding the mandatory language of the trafficking statute. \r\n  Taub points out that the court's discretionary authority to grant probation \r\n  and suspend the sentence is excluded by the statute only for those offenses \r\n  involving the death sentence or life imprisonment. He argues that we should \r\n  infer from the specific exclusion of death penalty and life imprisonment offenses \r\n  that the legislature intended to include every other offense under the general \r\n  provisions of Â§ 24-21-410. See State v. Burton, 301 S.C. 305, \r\n  307, 391 S.E.2d 583, 584 (1990) (\"In determining the meaning of a statute, it \r\n  must be inferred that statutes specifically excluding certain things evidence \r\n  the intent of the legislature to include all other things not mentioned.\"). \r\n  This, Taub argues, further supports his contention that the legislature did \r\n  not intend to make the minimum stated terms of imprisonment for first and second \r\n  offense trafficking mandatory. Taub further argues that Â§ 24-21-410 was recently \r\n  amended, thereby making the statute a later enactment than Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1). \r\n  Taub asserts that, as the later statute, it now prevails over the former. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe reject these contentions, for \r\n  the following reasons. The general rule of statutory construction is that a \r\n  specific statute prevails over a more general one. Wooten v. South Carolina \r\n  Dep't of Transp., 333 S.C. 464, 511 S.E.2d 355 (1999); Atlas Food Sys. \r\n  &amp; Serv., Inc. v. Crane, 319 S.C. 556, 462 S.E.2d 858 (1995). Furthermore, \r\n  \"[t]he enactment of a later general statute does not repeal an earlier more \r\n  specific statute.\" Atlas, 319 S.C. at 558, 462 S.E.2d at 859 (citing \r\n  Mims v. Alston, 312 S.C. 311, 440 S.E.2d 357 (1994)). Our supreme court \r\n  has likewise rejected the proposition that the amendment of a general statute \r\n  impliedly affects an earlier specific statute, recognizing that repeal by implication \r\n  is disfavored, and is found only when two statutes are incapable of any reasonable \r\n  reconcilement. Id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis court previously addressed this \r\n  issue in State v. Tisdale, 321 S.C. 153, 467 S.E.2d 270 (Ct. App. 1996), \r\n  which involved the offense of driving under the influence. In that case we held \r\n  that, to the extent they conflicted, the specific DUI statute prevailed over \r\n  the more general provisions of Â§ 24-21-410. We find that analysis applicable \r\n  here and hold that the more specific trafficking statute prevails. Id. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nSection 24-21-410 provides the general \r\n  statutory authority to a court of record to suspend a portion of a criminal \r\n  sentence and grant probation as a part of sentencing. This provision is the \r\n  first section of the chapter regarding probation, parole, and pardon, and was \r\n  first enacted by the General Assembly in 1942. It has remained substantively \r\n  unchanged, except to specifically label probation as a form of clemency by the \r\n  1996 amendment.(1) We think it clear that the \r\n  legislature intended to restrict this general grant of authority by stating \r\n  in Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) that the required sentence included a minimum term \r\n  of imprisonment, which cannot be suspended nor probation granted. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Does S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) prescribe a mandatory fine of twenty-five thousand dollars? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe last issue presented is whether \r\n  the fine of twenty-five thousand dollars is mandatory and, therefore, cannot \r\n  be reduced or suspended. Employing the same rules of statutory construction, \r\n  we conclude that the twenty-five thousand dollar fine is not mandatory. The \r\n  phrase \"no part of which may be suspended nor probation granted\" precedes the \r\n  stated fine, and therefore modifies only the phrase \"a term of imprisonment \r\n  of not less than three years nor more than ten years.\" See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) (Supp. 1998). Consequently, the authority of the \r\n  court in its discretion to suspend the imposition or execution of the fine pursuant \r\n  to Â§ 24-21-410 is not limited by the restrictive wording of Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause we find the specific sentencing \r\n  provisions of Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) require that Taub be sentenced to a term \r\n  of imprisonment of at least three years, and that this requirement prevails \r\n  over the general sentencing authority to grant probation outlined in Â§ 24-21-410, \r\n  we reverse the sentence of the trial court and remand for re-sentencing in accordance \r\n  with the express statutory language of Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nHOWELL, C.J. and HUFF, J., \r\n  concur. \r\n   \r\n1.

At trial, Smalls used nine of ten peremptory \r\n  strikes to remove white jurors from the venire. The State objected pursuant \r\n  to Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), \r\n  alleging the defense utilized the strikes in an intentionally discriminatory \r\n  manner. The trial court then asked defense counsel to give race-neutral reasons \r\n  for the strikes, to which she responded, \"A lot of this was just looking at \r\n  the potential jurors and seeing -- if they don't look at me or if they look \r\n  with a mean, stern look.\" She further explained that she believed those persons \r\n  who tended to look away or glare were not open-minded, and stated that such \r\n  veniremen \"have already made their minds up, and I don't want them on the jury.\"(1) \r\n  While the trial judge admitted counsel's stated explanation \"possibly could \r\n  be reasonable,\" he determined it was not sufficiently race-neutral. As a result, \r\n  the court returned the jury panel to the pool, and a new jury was drawn and \r\n  sworn. The new panel contained four members originally struck by the defense. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nAt the close of the State's case, \r\n  Smalls moved to set aside the burglary charge because the indictment failed \r\n  to allege the garage broken into was within 200 yards of the victim's house. \r\n  The trial court denied the motion, finding the indictment sufficiently charged \r\n  the offense of burglary in the first degree. Smalls subsequently was convicted \r\n  of both offenses, and the trial court sentenced him to fifteen years on the \r\n  first degree burglary and five years on the attempted grand larceny, to be served \r\n  concurrently.  \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n   \r\n   \r\nSmalls argues the trial court erred \r\n  in (1) granting the State's motion pursuant to Batson, where four of \r\n  the jurors originally struck by the defense were subsequently seated on the \r\n  jury, and (2) refusing to dismiss the burglary indictment for lack of subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction because the indictment failed to state an essential element \r\n  of the offense. \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause Smalls' second argument concerns \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction, we consider it first.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1. Refusal to Dismiss Indictment \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn objection to a defect appearing \r\n  on the face of an indictment usually must be raised before the jury is sworn. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-90 (1985); State v. Warren, 330 S.C. 584, 500 \r\n  S.E.2d 128 (Ct. App. 1998). Issues related to subject matter jurisdiction, however, \r\n  may be raised at any time. Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  773 (1998); Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 465 S.E.2d 358 (1995). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSmalls was indicted for burglary \r\n  in the first degree pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311. The indictment at \r\n  issue alleged that Smalls did: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n. . . wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously \r\n  enter the dwelling of Marion Puckhaber . . . in the nighttime, without the consent \r\n  of the owner and with the intent to commit a crime therein. . . . in violation \r\n  of Â§ 16-11-311 of the South Carolina Code of Laws (1976) as amended.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSmalls, however, asserts the State's \r\n  proof showed the building actually broken into was in fact Puckhaber's garage, \r\n  located approximately fifty-three feet behind her \"dwelling.\" Smalls argues \r\n  the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the indictment failed to \r\n  allege the essential element that the Puckhaber garage was within 200 yards \r\n  of the residence. We disagree.\r\nA person is guilty of first degree \r\n  burglary if the person \"enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to \r\n  commit a crime in the dwelling, and . . . (3) the entering or remaining occurs \r\n  in the nighttime.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A) (Supp. 1998). For purposes \r\n  of this statute, \"'dwelling' means its definition found in Â§ 16-11-10 and also \r\n  means the living quarters of a building which is used or normally used for sleeping, \r\n  living, or lodging by a person.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-310(2) (Supp. 1998). \r\n  With respect to burglary, Â§ 16-11-10 defines \"dwelling house\" as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n. . . any house, outhouse, apartment, \r\n  building, erection, shed or box in which there sleeps a proprietor, tenant, \r\n  watchman, clerk, laborer or person who lodges there with a view to the protection \r\n  of property shall be deemed a dwelling house, and of such a dwelling house or \r\n  of any other dwelling house all houses, outhouses, buildings, sheds and erections \r\n  which are within two hundred yards of it and are appurtenant to it or to the \r\n  same establishment of which it is an appurtenance shall be deemed parcels. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-10 (1985). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nSmalls contends State v. Evans, \r\n  18 S.C. 137 (1882), and State v. Langford, 55 S.C. 322, 33 S.E. 370 \r\n  (1899), neither of which have been expressly overruled, stand for the proposition \r\n  that an indictment for burglary of a building that is not the actual dwelling \r\n  house itself must allege that it was within 200 yards of the dwelling house. \r\n  In Evans, the supreme court, interpreting the same statutory language \r\n  as that in Â§ 16-11-10, held an indictment insufficient where it alleged a burglary \r\n  in a \"gin house, situate within the curtilage of the said dwelling-house,\" because \r\n  it failed to allege the gin house was within 200 yards of the dwelling house \r\n  and appurtenant to it, two elements the statute required. Evans, 18 \r\n  S.C. at 138-139. Similarly, Langford held an indictment for compound \r\n  larceny of items in a dog house must allege that the dog house was appurtenant \r\n  to, and within two hundred yards of, the dwelling house. Langford, \r\n  33 S.E. at 372. \r\n   \r\nThe State, on the other hand, argues \r\n  that Â§ 16-11-10 is now a definitional statute referenced in the burglary statute \r\n  of Â§ 16-11-310, and maintains that \"dwelling,\" as referenced in Â§ 16-11-310 \r\n  and defined in Â§ 16-11-10, incorporates all outbuildings within 200 yards of \r\n  the actual \"dwelling house.\"(2) We agree. See \r\n  Padgett v. State, 324 S.C. 22, 29 n.2, 484 S.E.2d 101, 104 n.2 (1997) \r\n  (noting, under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-10, \"dwelling\" is defined as \r\n  \"any building in which a person sleeps or lodges and all other buildings \r\n  within two hundred yards of it.\") (emphasis added). Furthermore, the true \r\n  test of an indictment's validity is not whether it could be made more definite \r\n  and certain, but whether it contains the necessary elements of the offense intended \r\n  to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared \r\n  to meet. Browning v. State, supra. The indictment at hand \r\n  charges that Smalls entered the victim's dwelling without consent, with the \r\n  intent to commit a crime, and that the incident occurred in the nighttime. We \r\n  therefore find the indictment for first degree burglary sufficient. See \r\n  State v. Shoemaker, 276 S.C. 86, 275 S.E.2d 878 (1981) (stating an \r\n  indictment phrased substantially in the language of the statute which creates \r\n  and defines the offense is ordinarily sufficient). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n2. Batson \r\n  Challenge \r\n   \r\nSmalls argues the trial court also \r\n  erred in granting the State's Batson motion. We agree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nInitially, we address the State's \r\n  assertion that Smalls' Batson argument is not preserved for appellate \r\n  review because he did not object to the impanelment of the second jury. Our \r\n  supreme court, however, recently addressed this question in State v. Ford, \r\n  Op. No. 24899 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed February 8, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. \r\n  6 at 31). There, as here, the defendant failed to object to the composition \r\n  of a second jury drawn immediately after the first was quashed on Batson \r\n  grounds. The court stated that, because defense counsel's argument and the judge's \r\n  ruling on the issue were contained in the record, \"[f]urther objection would \r\n  have been useless and unnecessary.\" Id. at 34. We therefore find this \r\n  argument is preserved for our review. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn the merits, Smalls contends the \r\n  trial court erred in failing to accept the reason stated as race-neutral. We \r\n  agree. It is incumbent upon the trial court to follow the procedure for Batson \r\n  hearings outlined in State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996) \r\n  and Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 \r\n  (1995). Thus, after a party objects to a peremptory strike of a member of a \r\n  cognizable racial group or gender (step one), a hearing is convened and the \r\n  strike's proponent must tender an explanation for it that is racially neutral \r\n  on its face (step two). Id. Once a race-neutral reason is stated, the \r\n  trial court must decide (step three) whether the opponent of the strike has \r\n  proved purposeful racial discrimination. Id. At this third step, the \r\n  burden returns to the party challenging the strike to establish that the explanation \r\n  is mere pretext. Id.; Ford at 35. An opponent may meet this \r\n  burden either by showing similarly situated members of another race or gender \r\n  were seated on the jury, or by demonstrating the reason advanced for the strike \r\n  is so fundamentally implausible as to constitute mere pretext despite the lack \r\n  of disparate treatment. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn determining whether a party exercised \r\n  strikes in violation of Batson, a reviewing court must examine the \r\n  totality of facts and circumstances in the record surrounding the strikes. Ford \r\n  at 35. While the composition of the jury panel is a factor that may be considered \r\n  in evaluating purposeful discrimination,(3) the \r\n  mere fact that a defendant used most of his peremptory strikes against a particular \r\n  race or gender is not by itself sufficient to establish it. Ford at \r\n  36. Moreover, unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the proponent's \r\n  explanation at the second step of the analysis, the reason offered will be deemed \r\n  race-neutral. State v. Tucker, Op. No. 24864 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. \r\n  25, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 4 at 2); Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. \r\n  51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998). The explanation given at this step is not required \r\n  to be persuasive or even plausible. Ford at 35. In Purkett, the \r\n  Court stated as follows:\r\n The second step of this process \r\n  does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible. 'At this \r\n  [second] step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the [proponent's] \r\n  explanation.' \r\n   \r\n* * * \r\n   \r\nIt is not until the third step that \r\n  the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant--the step in which \r\n  the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his \r\n  burden of proving purposeful discrimination. At that stage, implausible or fantastic \r\n  justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful \r\n  discrimination. But to say that a trial judge may choose to disbelieve a silly \r\n  or superstitious reason at step three is quite different from saying that a \r\n  trial judge must terminate the inquiry at step two when the race-neutral reason \r\n  is silly or superstitious. The latter violates the principle that the ultimate \r\n  burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts \r\n  from, the opponent of the strike.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPurkett, 514 U.S. at 767-768, \r\n  115 S.Ct. at 1771 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe discern no discriminatory intent \r\n  inherent in the defendant's explanation. We therefore find the reason asserted \r\n  by Smalls for his peremptory strikes, that the jurors were either refusing to \r\n  look or looking in a \"mean,\" \"stern\" or \"accusatory\" manner, was facially race-neutral, \r\n  even if perhaps suspect. See State v. Tucker, supra; State \r\n  v. Wilder, 306 S.C. 535, 413 S.E.2d 323 (1991) (counsel may strike venire \r\n  persons based on their demeanor and disposition). The trial court erred, therefore, \r\n  in failing to require the State to carry its burden to present evidence of pretext \r\n  as prescribed by step three of the Adams/Purkett analysis. See \r\n  Ford at 36 (finding opponent of strikes failed to offer evidence of pretext \r\n  as required by step three of the analysis); Adams, 322 S.C. at 124, \r\n  470 S.E.2d at 372 (stating that \"[u]nder some circumstances, the race-neutral \r\n  explanation given by the proponent may be so fundamentally implausible that \r\n  the judge may determine, at the third step of the analysis, that the \r\n  explanation was mere pretext\") (emphasis added); Purkett, 514 U.S. \r\n  at 768, 115 S.Ct. at 1771 (opponent of strike bears ultimate burden of persuasion \r\n  regarding racial motivation); cf. Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. \r\n  at 55-56, 495 S.E.2d at 208 (\"redneck\" is not race-neutral on its face so there \r\n  is no need to reach the third step of the analysis). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, no showing of actual \r\n  prejudice is required to find reversible error for the denial or impairment \r\n  of the right to a peremptory challenge. Ford at 36; State v. Short, \r\n  Op. No. 24879 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 18, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 3 \r\n  at 9). Accordingly, Smalls' convictions for first degree burglary and attempted \r\n  grand larceny are  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHOWELL, C.J., and HOWARD, \r\n  J., concur.\r\n1.  Defense counsel \r\n  also stated she struck two jurors for other reasons, specifically, one who had \r\n  relatives with law enforcement and another who was the victim of a burglary. \r\n  The trial court accepted these reasons as race-neutral. \r\n 2.  We note, \r\n  of course, that the definitional statute also requires that the outbuilding \r\n  be appurtenant to the actual \"dwelling house\" as well. The appurtenance of the \r\n  building is not an issue in this case.\r\n3.
